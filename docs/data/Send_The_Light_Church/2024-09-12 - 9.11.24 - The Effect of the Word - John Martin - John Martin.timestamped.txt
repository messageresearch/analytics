[32:46] we thank you for that desire that you
[32:49] placed

[32:55] literally leaving the people for you
[32:59] said there's a great
[33:01] apostasy uh taking place in this late
[33:05] hour where people would just draw back
[33:09] from you so Lord we're we counted a
[33:12] blessing this evening just to have the
[33:15] desire to be in your house today that
[33:17] we're Lord we're we're part of that that
[33:23] chosen uh elected seed that you placed
[33:27] inside of us before the foundation of

[33:32] true to you we thank you for that and we
[33:36] pray that you would come in the the
[33:38] ministry of the word at this time to
[33:41] each of us that have that that have come
[33:43] and that we've gathered those that are
[33:45] live streaming perhaps those that would
[33:48] be maybe looking at the uh the archive
[33:52] in the future Lord I pray that the word
[33:55] would become a a quickened to them that
[33:59] they may be able to be benefited from
[34:02] your word because your word you sent

[34:08] meet all the needs that we could
[34:09] possibly have in our life and we just

[34:16] real Awakening in in US Lord that we may
[34:19] press on un into the rapture we thank
[34:22] you for these things we we're believing
[34:25] them now for we ask them in the name of
[34:27] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:30] amen amen turn with me if you would to
[34:32] the book of First uh
[34:35] Thessalonians chapter 2 and we're going
[34:38] to read uh a few verses there 11 12 and
[34:43] 13 the Bible says we're the Jesus said
[34:46] we're the carcasses there where the
[34:48] Eagles be gathered together and
[34:53] um you know back in the day there was a
[34:57] a lot of people that flocked around this
[35:00] message or flocked around
[35:02] Jesus because of all the
[35:04] Miracles but then as he said the word
[35:08] needs to be preeminent the Miracles was
[35:11] just to get your attention now what's
[35:14] really important to me God what's really
[35:16] important to Jesus was the word and and
[35:20] and and it's no different with the the
[35:22] message in this age it just it just
[35:24] seems that um we we we've just got to
[35:28] know where we're standing with the word
[35:30] amen this this today is is in one sense
[35:34] it may be looked at church but I want us
[35:36] to look at it as a spiritual Gathering
[35:38] amen of eagles to hear from the Lord
[35:42] amen first Thessalonians chapter 2
[35:44] starting with verse number 11 as you
[35:47] know how we exhorted and comforted and
[35:52] charged every one of you as a father
[35:55] doth his children so this is is real
[35:58] important that you walk worthy of God
[36:00] who have called you unto his kingdom and
[36:03] glory for this cause also thank we god
[36:07] without ceasing because when you
[36:09] received the word of God which he heard
[36:12] of us you received it not as the word of
[36:16] men but as it is in truth the word of
[36:21] God which effectually worketh also in
[36:26] you that believe
[36:28] God bless you you may be seated we want
[36:29] to title this message the effect of the
[36:33] word the word of God is the only thing
[36:36] that can transform the nature of
[36:39] man I mean we can go to seminars we can
[36:42] we can do a lot of things to kind of
[36:45] help our lives but there's only one
[36:48] thing that can really change our old
[36:50] nature into the nature of God and that's
[36:53] the word of
[36:54] God the word of God is powerful
[36:58] it can it can heal our bodies it can
[37:02] speak to the
[37:04] storms uh it can speak to
[37:07] situations the word of God is ex is
[37:10] powerful if if we realize how powerful
[37:14] this really
[37:15] was
[37:18] um so many things that we could do but
[37:22] we've got to have faith in this word for
[37:25] us
[37:27] and and and and faith is is is a seed in
[37:31] itself but that is what activates the
[37:34] word and the scripture tells us here
[37:37] that when we believe the word that's
[37:40] being preached whether you're listening
[37:42] to a tape you're coming to church um
[37:44] you're reading the scriptures you must
[37:47] believe that it is God may not
[37:50] understand it may not know how it works
[37:53] but you must believe it's God and that
[37:55] if you believe it with all your heart
[37:57] it'll work in you it'll work but if you
[38:01] don't it'll actually condemn
[38:04] you it'll actually condemn you
[38:07] so this is this is the dividing line
[38:10] right here this is this is what
[38:13] separates the goat from the Sheep this
[38:16] is what's going to be used at the day of
[38:18] judgment and this is what God uses to
[38:21] save man is the word of God Amen and and
[38:24] we don't we don't want any anything else
[38:28] now I want to talk just a little bit
[38:30] about the Mana in the Old Testament
[38:32] everybody knows a little bit about the
[38:33] Mana right the children of
[38:36] Israel they they they really murmured
[38:40] because they weren't getting all their
[38:41] needs met like they were back in Egypt
[38:44] and they thought well hey look we're
[38:45] we're starving out here if we were back
[38:48] in Egypt at least they fed
[38:50] us and so God provided a food for them
[38:53] to eat and it was called Mana in Exodus
[38:56] 16 ver verse 14 it's described and when
[39:00] the Dew that laid was gone up behold
[39:04] upon the face of the Wilderness there
[39:05] was a small round thing as small as
[39:09] frost on the ground and when the
[39:13] children of Israel saw it they said one
[39:15] to another it is Mana for they wish not
[39:20] what it was in other words what is it
[39:24] and Moses said unto them this is the
[39:27] bread which the Lord have given you to
[39:31] eat and in verse 31 and the house of
[39:35] Israel called the name thereof mana and
[39:38] it was like a coridor a corridor seed
[39:42] that's about a eigh inch
[39:44] diameter that you know how big that is
[39:47] white and it taste of it was like Wafers
[39:50] made with honey and
[39:54] and this food was called man it was like
[39:57] what is they never like seen it before
[40:00] but it
[40:01] was everything that they needed was in
[40:05] that little seed every vitamin every
[40:08] mineral everything that they needed to
[40:11] sustain them for 40 years until they
[40:13] made it to the promised land was in that
[40:20] seed and it's the type of the Bride
[40:23] eating the word of God every day until
[40:26] what until they be become the word you
[40:29] eat the word to become the word because
[40:31] the word is the promised
[40:35] land it's it's it's our nature becoming
[40:38] just like
[40:40] God and you know God's working through a
[40:45] a heart with desires and free more
[40:48] agencies and we're constantly making
[40:50] decisions everybody makes a decision
[40:52] what you're going to eat every day what
[40:55] you're going to do every day how long
[40:57] you're going to sleep in when you're
[41:00] going to get up what you're going to do
[41:01] what you're going to accomplish and this
[41:04] is the same thing with becoming the word
[41:08] we can be satisfied with just coming to
[41:10] church be satisfied with just being
[41:13] baptized just um I'm in the message I'm
[41:17] I'm part of the group I I recognized the
[41:20] prophet I I I see
[41:22] Malachi and and we can
[41:24] become secure in those things
[41:27] but I am telling you that is not the
[41:30] promised
[41:31] land the the Mana was given to us to
[41:36] become
[41:38] it okay so why was it that the Catholic
[41:41] Church did not want to allow the Bible
[41:43] to get into the hands of the people back
[41:45] in the
[41:48] day because Satan does not want you to
[41:51] know who you are and he doesn't want you
[41:54] to know what you're to
[41:56] become
[41:58] amen if we don't read the Bible we're
[42:01] not if we don't get into it if we don't
[42:04] come to church and really get into the
[42:06] word then the word cannot come into us
[42:09] because it can only come through love I
[42:11] want this I want this for my life my
[42:14] flesh don't want it my flesh don't want
[42:16] it your flesh don't want it we don't
[42:18] want to sit here and and and and and and
[42:21] come subject to to correction and
[42:23] direction for our lives we'd rather just
[42:25] do what we want to do
[42:27] but it all comes down to us there's only
[42:30] one thing that makes it to the other
[42:31] side you must be born again what does
[42:34] that mean that means we must become the
[42:36] word right we become the word that's
[42:38] what the new birth is it's not some
[42:41] experience that we say we had it is
[42:43] something where our nature changed and
[42:45] that's why we see so many people come
[42:47] and go you know one day they're on fire
[42:49] the next day you don't see them they
[42:52] they come to church for 6 months then
[42:53] they're not here and they they put other
[42:55] things in priorities and and and it's
[42:58] just a a trick of Satan to get them away
[43:01] from what they need to become the
[43:07] word we need to eat the word every
[43:10] day you know we are what we eat
[43:15] right our promised land is to become
[43:17] like
[43:18] Christ so I I I believe it every every
[43:21] day we get up and we all look in the
[43:23] mirror right we all look in the mirror
[43:26] and when we look in the the mirror we
[43:28] usually say Lord help us right now it's
[43:32] not looking too good and we we we wash
[43:36] we shower we do whatever we do we we we
[43:39] comb we brush we we put on better
[43:41] clothes right we put on better clothes
[43:43] we we put in clothes and then we look
[43:45] you know
[43:48] better one day we're going to become
[43:51] like
[43:52] Christ and John said in 1 John 3:1
[43:57] behold what manner of love the father
[44:01] has given us has put upon us that we
[44:04] should be called the sons of God and the
[44:08] world doesn't know who who we are
[44:10] because it didn't know who he
[44:13] was beloved now are we the sons of
[44:18] God if we all if we if we are Son of God
[44:21] we always were a Son of God we just
[44:23] didn't know it then but now we do know
[44:25] it but the scripture says it doesn't it
[44:28] doesn't
[44:30] appear it it it does not yet appear what
[44:33] we shall
[44:34] be but we know that when he shall appear
[44:38] because the Bible tells us that when he
[44:40] shall appear we shall be like
[44:44] him we're going to see him as he
[44:47] is now this word will take an effect in
[44:51] our life if we believe it and if we
[44:54] believe it the Bible says every man that
[44:57] has this hope inside of him what does he
[45:01] do he purifies
[45:03] himself he says I want to do what I need
[45:07] to do to become Christ and if you don't
[45:10] have that hope if you think no no no no
[45:14] well then you're not going to purify
[45:16] yourself you're you're just how many
[45:18] people just come to church one way and
[45:21] they leave they leave church where
[45:23] brother Ram says you never leave the
[45:24] same
[45:27] says you're either closer or further so
[45:29] in other words when you hear the truth
[45:31] and you don't take it then you actually
[45:34] become worse off and how many how many's
[45:37] ever been in a spot where you thought
[45:40] wow I feel like I'm in a worse shape
[45:44] than I was before we've all we've all
[45:47] we've all battled that we've all had
[45:49] that and I I'll just say it like this it
[45:52] is possible for that to happen
[45:57] you know if if brother Brandon says we
[45:58] backslide 100 times a day just in our
[46:00] thoughts and in different ways you know
[46:03] brother Brandon would rededicate his
[46:05] life he was a prophet and yet he said I
[46:07] I I would rededicate my life at night
[46:10] just get down on my knees and because
[46:13] this flesh is at gravity pulling us away
[46:17] from the promised
[46:19] land and we've got to fight it Romans
[46:22] 8:29 says from whom God did for for no
[46:28] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[46:33] to the image of his son so there it is
[46:35] again that we might be the firstborn
[46:38] that he might be the firstborn among
[46:40] many Brethren another scripture telling
[46:42] us that our promised land is to be like
[46:45] God our
[46:47] nature and and and this is where our
[46:49] Nature's changed it's not on the other
[46:51] side because Jesus said you must be born
[46:53] again to get to the other side so the
[46:55] nature changes Happening Here we must be
[46:58] serious about letting the word take an
[47:00] effect in our
[47:02] life Philippians 3:14 Paul's saying I
[47:05] press towards the mark for the prize of
[47:08] the High Calling of God in Christ he
[47:11] pressed towards it and other words I am
[47:13] going to purify myself I'm going to
[47:16] press in I'm going to do more than
[47:18] barely make it to church once in a
[47:22] while I just you know as much as I I
[47:25] know this this m message
[47:28] honestly is the cream of the
[47:31] crop it is the cream of the
[47:35] crop and and though people know it is
[47:39] the cream of the crop just being in a
[47:42] church where the message is honored it's
[47:45] preached it doesn't make the word live
[47:48] in
[47:53] us we we need to treasure the message we
[47:57] need to treasure the word that's being
[47:59] preached and we've got to say God if
[48:02] this is really what you're calling me
[48:04] John Martin to do then I must do
[48:08] it Romans 8:18 says for I reckon that
[48:12] the sufferings of this present time are
[48:15] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[48:17] that shall be revealed in us so yes you
[48:20] know to go ahead and purify yourself and
[48:23] pray and and and and and and and and try
[48:26] to get rid of the carnality and spend
[48:28] time with God it is
[48:31] suffering but that that little bit of
[48:33] suffering that we're that we really have
[48:35] to do is is not you can't compare it
[48:37] with eternity you can't compare it with
[48:39] the glory that God's going to give
[48:41] us for the earnest
[48:44] expectation of the of the creation is
[48:48] waiting for the manifestation of you and
[48:52] me there's actually something waiting on
[48:55] us
[48:56] all of creation is waiting on
[49:02] us
[49:05] Mana is a type of Jesus Christ the
[49:09] word and Jesus said I am the bread of
[49:12] life that cometh down from heaven and he
[49:15] that eateth this bread shall have
[49:18] everlasting life so we literally have to
[49:21] partake of the word of course we know
[49:23] that there were those that thought he
[49:25] was they were teaching some sort of
[49:28] doctrine that you have to be a cannibal
[49:30] and eat the flesh right and but the word
[49:34] that he was speaking his his words were
[49:38] spirit and they were life he was the
[49:42] manifestation of the word the word
[49:44] became flesh and he was living among the
[49:49] people and he was he was trying to show
[49:51] that you you need to listen to the words
[49:55] that I'm saying and believe them because
[49:58] if you don't the word will not have an
[50:00] effect so even though we're in the
[50:02] message we we believe it's true it it
[50:05] doesn't mean we're going to become it we
[50:07] we have to start activating the word in
[50:10] our life we have to activate the only
[50:13] way we can activate the word is to
[50:15] believe
[50:16] it and the belief that I'm talking about
[50:19] is not a belief of of of a mental belief
[50:24] because the Devils have that they
[50:25] believe and and they tremble and and
[50:28] their nature is not
[50:30] changed but a
[50:34] sinner who
[50:36] recognizes God is my only hope my only
[50:41] answer faith in the word of God can
[50:45] change his very
[50:48] nature God made it so simple that we all
[50:51] can be
[50:54] Overcomers the self- religious of that
[50:56] day said our fathers ate Mana in the
[51:00] wilderness they partook of the
[51:02] supernatural experience God supplied
[51:05] their their needs their shoes didn't
[51:07] wear out and God was with them every day
[51:09] the pillar of cloud was there they could
[51:11] testify that God was with them but they
[51:14] did not testify that God was not pleased
[51:17] with
[51:18] them and we've got to come to grips with
[51:22] this word needs to be life to us people
[51:27] people are are are are coming to the
[51:29] church and they're leaving and they're
[51:31] not taking the word
[51:33] serious we're because we're living in in
[51:35] such a terrible hour such a terrible
[51:38] hour but Jesus said to every one of
[51:41] those that they were in their testified
[51:43] he said they are everyone
[51:46] dead so it wasn't good enough that God
[51:49] just brought him out of the
[51:51] world it wasn't good enough to just be
[51:53] brought out of the world and and and
[51:55] recognize that this is the way to the
[51:58] promised land the message is the way to
[51:59] the promised land it is the way to a
[52:02] nature change because the message breaks
[52:04] down what the words really
[52:07] saying the Mana became common to the
[52:10] children of
[52:15] Israel they died because they
[52:19] murmured at eating the man in other
[52:21] words they got tired of
[52:24] it they got tired of it they murmured
[52:26] they
[52:28] complain they had everything it it had
[52:31] everything they needed to make it but
[52:33] when you complain against the word of
[52:36] God then the very vehicle that's
[52:38] supposed to take you to a nature change
[52:40] doesn't take you there because you're
[52:42] resisting what it's what it's telling
[52:45] you you're not eating it I'd rather go
[52:48] home and eat
[52:51] this right why why make a sacrifice why
[52:55] suffer and and and and and and and do
[52:58] these things when there's an easier way
[53:01] well that's just that's just the
[53:03] devil and and people I'm not saying you
[53:06] now but I'm saying that people get
[53:08] caught up in this this this murmuring uh
[53:12] and this complaining and they want
[53:14] something more and this this is I I so
[53:16] believe in bringing a fivefold ministry
[53:18] here and I'll tell you why because if we
[53:21] don't make it with a five-fold Ministry
[53:23] we weren't going to make
[53:24] it that's all there is to
[53:28] it I I'm not going to be the reason some
[53:32] of you don't make it I am not going to
[53:33] be the
[53:35] reason I may be the reason I'm not
[53:37] popular and I'm okay with that because I
[53:40] really don't care about being popular
[53:42] but I'm not going to be the reason that
[53:43] we don't make it I'd rather I'd rather
[53:46] tell you the
[53:49] truth see when you murmur and you're
[53:52] complaining what happens is your faith
[53:53] doesn't got a chance to
[53:55] grow if your faith doesn't got a chance
[53:58] to grow then all you can do is believe
[54:00] the word like the
[54:02] devils in other words it can't work in
[54:07] you our whole goal is to get the word to
[54:09] work in us if we're sick we want healing
[54:11] we want that word to work in
[54:14] us if we need deliverance we want that
[54:16] word to work in us we're we're looking
[54:20] for the word to take an effect inside of
[54:23] us and the only thing that can activate
[54:25] the word is
[54:27] Faith and and the faith has to be not
[54:32] well I I know that's not brother John
[54:34] that I know that's the word of God he's
[54:35] saying it he's preaching the prophet
[54:37] said it it it it can't be that what does
[54:40] it have to be it has to be that God is
[54:42] speaking to
[54:45] me God is speaking to me not brother
[54:51] John not brother
[54:53] brandom God is speaking to me
[54:59] when you know that it's God then you you
[55:04] you have that Faith to say it's
[55:08] mine until then you just have
[55:13] hope and and God does want us to get
[55:15] desperate you know brother B preach that
[55:17] message is
[55:18] desperation I mean you're not going to
[55:20] purify yourself unless you're
[55:23] desperate I mean because the devil can
[55:24] really he can paint a good picture you
[55:26] you know well you're always human you're
[55:27] always going to make mistakes you know
[55:28] you're always going to be you're always
[55:29] going to be so why Try right so it it
[55:32] just takes you away from trying to press
[55:35] into Christ and look we're all battl on
[55:38] a leoan spirit very
[55:44] strong but too many message
[55:49] Believers today they come to church they
[55:52] listen to the word of God but they never
[55:55] fall in love with the
[55:58] word they hear it but they don't fall in
[56:00] love with it they can even say Amen but
[56:03] they don't fall in love with it you we
[56:07] need to fall in love with the word it's
[56:09] the only thing that can save us and what
[56:12] happens to the message Believers today
[56:14] who don't fall in love with their Bible
[56:16] their faith doesn't grow enough to go
[56:18] into the promised land and what is the
[56:20] promised land that my nature can really
[56:22] be
[56:23] changed people start coming to church
[56:26] because they want their natural needs
[56:30] met that's all that's that's all they're
[56:33] interested in I got this issue I got
[56:35] this problem I got this i got this and
[56:39] really that was just to get our
[56:41] attention and I do believe that the word
[56:43] of God is powerful to meet every need I
[56:46] do believe
[56:48] that but you don't just belittle the
[56:51] power that it has to change our nature
[56:54] which really causes the majority of our
[56:55] needs
[56:57] which really causes the majority of our
[56:59] problems is our own nature right you
[57:01] step on my toe and I'm going to really
[57:03] step on
[57:04] yours right and that starts something
[57:07] where if I had the nature changed I
[57:09] would say it's okay it's okay and then
[57:12] the problem isn't is
[57:14] bad but when we're sitting here as a
[57:16] judge like we're we're like we're some
[57:17] sort of what's right or wrong when God
[57:21] has ordained those things to happen
[57:22] brother brand said that it's not the
[57:24] action that happens around us but it's
[57:27] how we react to that that is what God is
[57:30] looking
[57:32] at you notice that there's some some
[57:35] people they're just God put them in your
[57:40] life to perfect
[57:44] you they may never humble themselves to
[57:48] say I'm sorry I need to do
[57:51] better they the only thing they may say
[57:54] is you shouldn't have done what you
[57:56] did causing you to say I am sorry for
[58:01] how I
[58:03] reacted and you sit there and you may
[58:05] wonder is this not going to go any
[58:07] further this isn't fair this isn't right
[58:09] my neighbor I cannot believe but in
[58:13] reality God is perfecting a few bride a
[58:17] few
[58:19] bride and that bride is what he's coming
[58:23] back for I mean he would that all would
[58:25] be saved right but they're not I would
[58:27] say he would that all would be bride but
[58:29] they're not somebody's got to fulfill
[58:33] the foolish and the the the you know not
[58:37] watching you know Jesus said watch and
[58:39] pray and there's little to see is
[58:43] about I'm I'm I'm I feel like I'm
[58:47] okay I feel like I'm okay the time you
[58:50] feel okay is the time you know you're
[58:53] not okay
[58:56] because we we need to be pressing we
[59:00] need to be
[59:03] pressing I want Faith to become like
[59:06] Jesus turn with me if you would to
[59:07] Galatians Chapter 5 Verse
[59:11] 6 well this is this is um I only I had a
[59:17] few pages but already I can't even get
[59:19] there I'm not going to get to the end
[59:20] that's how slow this is going but I hope
[59:25] I hope it's a it' be a help to somebody
[59:28] lay it's kind of like a a little bit of
[59:30] a lengthy Foundation but Galatians 5:6
[59:33] for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision
[59:36] availeth anything or uncircumcision
[59:38] whether you're you know go by the law or
[59:40] go by what you say I don't need to do
[59:43] that he says but Faith which worketh by
[59:49] love that's I'm saying when we come to
[59:51] church and we hear the word of God we've
[59:53] got to fall in love with the word
[59:55] because if we don't fall in love with it
[59:57] how are we going to believe
[1:00:01] it it it it's it's a love affair yes God
[1:00:05] God will truly heal many people that
[1:00:07] never get saved he
[1:00:11] will he will literally save many people
[1:00:14] that don't make it
[1:00:19] whoa look if you do the first step he'll
[1:00:22] go there but the time that you say I'm
[1:00:25] not walking anymore that's your choice
[1:00:28] God ain't going to say well I saved you
[1:00:30] no matter
[1:00:31] what and see this this this concept of
[1:00:35] all these doctrines that are made up I
[1:00:38] call them doctrines of devils what they
[1:00:41] do is they take the fear of God out of
[1:00:43] people
[1:00:44] right that you know I don't need to
[1:00:47] worry about this and I don't need to
[1:00:48] worry about that and I got such security
[1:00:51] it's a false sense of
[1:00:53] security because if you really were cure
[1:00:56] you would still be pressing in to that
[1:01:00] image you would still be you you that
[1:01:03] would be God in you in
[1:01:06] control taking you to the promised
[1:01:09] land and so the these Spirits are just
[1:01:12] you know they're looking to seek who
[1:01:14] they can who can who they can get and
[1:01:17] you know you may be talking to them and
[1:01:21] and someday you may be sitting by them
[1:01:22] and shaking their hands and and and
[1:01:25] texting them
[1:01:29] the scripture says you did run well like
[1:01:32] we got to get these scripture we you did
[1:01:34] run well who did hinder
[1:01:39] you that you
[1:01:41] stopped in other words they should not
[1:01:44] obey the truth at one time you were
[1:01:46] obeying the
[1:01:48] truth you were coming to church you're
[1:01:50] trying to do the right thing I'm going
[1:01:52] to put this into action thank God he
[1:01:54] showed me this and you you went out
[1:01:57] rejoicing and and trusting and and
[1:01:59] believing and then all of a sudden you
[1:02:01] got
[1:02:05] hindered who did hinder
[1:02:08] you that you
[1:02:11] should back away from following the
[1:02:15] whole
[1:02:18] word well I still do this and I but look
[1:02:22] what about the rest of the word well God
[1:02:25] knows God understands God sees God told
[1:02:27] me
[1:02:30] really see it's a
[1:02:33] trick but I love it you did run well but
[1:02:38] something stopped
[1:02:40] you and he said that this
[1:02:43] persuasion cometh not of him that
[1:02:46] originally called you out of the
[1:02:50] world this persuasion that you're
[1:02:52] dealing with right now where that hunger
[1:02:54] and that thirst from more of
[1:02:58] God that persuasion didn't come from
[1:03:01] what you think it is from God well God
[1:03:03] understands that I got to deal with this
[1:03:05] and I got to deal with
[1:03:11] that you I remember as clear as
[1:03:15] day when I was putting the offices on at
[1:03:19] at trusted tool and I was in the office
[1:03:24] you know basically myself and
[1:03:26] uh putting the the floor in and I was
[1:03:29] just sitting there and I was listening
[1:03:31] to the war that was going on in in the
[1:03:35] in the
[1:03:36] golf and I I remember hearing that they
[1:03:40] they took out their
[1:03:42] communication like the first
[1:03:46] thing and and I'm just trying to think
[1:03:48] you know what you know why are they
[1:03:49] doing this and you're thinking well they
[1:03:51] they weren't able to communicate to one
[1:03:53] another if you notice the first thing
[1:03:56] that the devil does is he takes people
[1:03:58] away from the
[1:04:00] church he takes them away from God being
[1:04:03] able to communicate with them and you
[1:04:06] know what they do they're so proud that
[1:04:08] they think they don't need church
[1:04:10] anymore that God can still speak to them
[1:04:12] that they don't need that and you know
[1:04:15] when we start to think like that then
[1:04:17] we're disrespecting God's order and how
[1:04:20] is God G to give you faith for anything
[1:04:23] when you're not humble yourself to to to
[1:04:26] follow the word the word says forsaking
[1:04:28] not well it's it's it's it's it's my job
[1:04:33] it's it's it's this it's
[1:04:37] that give me some give me some quotes
[1:04:40] give me some scripture give me something
[1:04:42] to where I can say okay I can't say okay
[1:04:44] as a pastor we need to be in
[1:04:47] church the devil is
[1:04:50] trying to stop the
[1:04:53] communication so you don't feel the
[1:04:55] conviction
[1:04:56] and I know I'm not I'm not speaking so
[1:04:59] much you Faithful
[1:05:03] Saints it's true we can say Amen to it
[1:05:06] and we can say thank you God for showing
[1:05:08] me
[1:05:09] but we got to rest the part of the body
[1:05:12] that Satan is hindering them they at one
[1:05:15] time they did run well they were coming
[1:05:18] faithfully and I I'm not just talking
[1:05:20] about one or two families I'm talking
[1:05:22] about quite a few
[1:05:28] A little leaven leaveneth the whole
[1:05:34] lump I want us to remember that who who
[1:05:38] hindered you who hindered you that you
[1:05:42] should not obey the truth we're living
[1:05:45] in the worst time in history lukewarm is
[1:05:50] so powerful that people don't even know
[1:05:52] it's on
[1:05:54] them I mean I mean if I was pushing
[1:05:57] against your body real strong you would
[1:06:00] feel that pressure but this lukewarm
[1:06:03] Spirit you do not feel
[1:06:05] it but it is yet so powerful that it
[1:06:09] just pushes you away from pressing into
[1:06:13] God Paul told Timothy to preach the word
[1:06:16] to be instant inseason out of season to
[1:06:18] re reprove rebuke exhort with all
[1:06:22] longsuffering and Doctrine
[1:06:26] for the time will come that they will
[1:06:29] not endure sound Doctrine but after
[1:06:33] their own desires their own lust they
[1:06:36] shall Heap to thems teachers having
[1:06:39] itching ears just wanting to hear what
[1:06:43] they want to hear if I don't get what I
[1:06:44] want hear I'm going to go somewhere else
[1:06:47] oh I was told of a
[1:06:51] uh some things that are going on and and
[1:06:53] and and the people are just church
[1:06:55] happen
[1:06:58] again we we we we need we need God the
[1:07:03] realness of God in their
[1:07:04] life and they shall turn away their ears
[1:07:08] from the truth and shall be turned unto
[1:07:11] fables now everybody knows what a fable
[1:07:13] is a fable is a partial
[1:07:17] truth there's partial truth enough to
[1:07:20] say oh yeah it it what and then all a
[1:07:23] sudden
[1:07:27] just enough to get you
[1:07:32] away the thing is a fable can't put us
[1:07:34] into the promised land it can't get the
[1:07:36] nature change the word of God is the
[1:07:39] only thing that can bring the nature
[1:07:40] change we we just got to come to grips
[1:07:43] with God your word needs to become king
[1:07:45] in my life it needs to become Supreme
[1:07:49] priority it needs to become preeminent
[1:07:51] in my life 1 Timothy 4:1 says now the
[1:07:55] spirit IR speaketh expressly that in the
[1:07:57] latter times some shall depart from the
[1:07:59] faith given heed to seducing Spirits
[1:08:02] doctrines of devils speaking lies and
[1:08:04] hypocrisy having their conscience seared
[1:08:06] with a hot iron in other words when you
[1:08:08] try to talk to them about the word they
[1:08:11] won't even listen to
[1:08:16] you and all you're doing is speaking the
[1:08:18] word it's not your word it's God's
[1:08:22] word but they don't want to honor God's
[1:08:25] word word and the spirit that's in them
[1:08:28] will come against
[1:08:34] you uh and how do you get to a place
[1:08:38] where your your conscience isn't
[1:08:40] bothered you just resist God
[1:08:45] enough resist God enough how do our
[1:08:48] hearts become Harden resist God enough
[1:08:52] it's all through fre more agency that's
[1:08:54] why it's important
[1:08:57] that we allow the word to become real to
[1:09:00] us the
[1:09:02] word that this is important it's not how
[1:09:06] I feel it's what God
[1:09:08] wants this know also that in the last
[1:09:12] days perilous time shall come now as I
[1:09:14] speak these words I want you to just
[1:09:16] think about if you see these things in
[1:09:18] the church for men shall become lovers
[1:09:21] of their own self Covetous bolsters
[1:09:24] proud blasphemers
[1:09:27] disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy
[1:09:31] without natural affection truth Breakers
[1:09:35] false accusers incontinent Fierce and
[1:09:39] even despisers of those that are good
[1:09:42] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[1:09:45] pleasure more than lovers of God having
[1:09:47] a form of God having a form of godliness
[1:09:51] but denying the power thereof from such
[1:09:55] you we've been instructed to turn away
[1:09:59] from that type of
[1:10:01] spirit ever learning but never able to
[1:10:04] come to a full maturity as brother Aaron
[1:10:06] was sharing with us what a wonderful uh
[1:10:09] services that we had about uh about
[1:10:13] becoming a mature Christian and not
[1:10:15] being satisfied with just saying I'm I'm
[1:10:18] saved I'm I'm I'm born again but but but
[1:10:22] um get up from that place of complacency
[1:10:25] and say I want to be more than what I am
[1:10:27] I want to be all that God's called me to
[1:10:29] be the word has got to become preeminent
[1:10:32] in our life amen we don't want to play
[1:10:35] church we don't want to live in lukewarm
[1:10:38] leoda Peter said I stir up your minds by
[1:10:41] a way of remembrance that you be mindful
[1:10:44] of The Words which were spoken before by
[1:10:46] the holy prophets and of the Commandment
[1:10:49] of us the Apostles of our Lord and
[1:10:52] savior knowing this first that there
[1:10:55] shall come in the last days the first
[1:10:58] thing
[1:10:59] scoffers and how do you know them
[1:11:02] they're walking after their own desires
[1:11:05] they're doing what they're doing because
[1:11:07] they want to do instead of just saying
[1:11:09] you know the word says that and I need
[1:11:10] to do
[1:11:12] that so you know these are people that
[1:11:15] are in the message these are people that
[1:11:17] are called message
[1:11:19] Believers and saying where is the
[1:11:22] promise of his coming if they felt the
[1:11:25] coming to the Lord was
[1:11:27] now in a week in a month the church
[1:11:30] would be filled I don't care what their
[1:11:31] jobs I don't care what their boss said I
[1:11:33] don't care what's happening in the
[1:11:34] sports I don't care about anything they
[1:11:36] would be here but because there's that
[1:11:39] Spirit of well you know it ain't going
[1:11:42] to happen for a
[1:11:45] while see it opens the door we don't
[1:11:47] realize that these Spirits can get on us
[1:11:49] get on the message
[1:11:53] Believers for since the the fathers fell
[1:11:55] asleep all things continue as they were
[1:11:57] from the beginning of the creation and
[1:11:59] for this they willingly are
[1:12:03] ignorant in other words I'm okay with
[1:12:06] this I'm okay with the way I'm
[1:12:10] thinking but the day of the Lord is
[1:12:12] going to come as a thief in the
[1:12:14] night the Mana became common to the
[1:12:18] children of Israel and we can't let the
[1:12:21] word become common to us we just can't
[1:12:24] we've got got to fight against that
[1:12:26] Hebrews 2:1 says therefore we ought to
[1:12:28] give the more Earnest heed to the things
[1:12:31] which we have heard give heed to it less
[1:12:34] at any time it should slip how many
[1:12:36] times have we heard something and we
[1:12:38] said amen that's the truth I need that
[1:12:40] and then we completely forgot it it is
[1:12:43] our
[1:12:46] responsibility to not let things slip
[1:12:49] the important
[1:12:50] things the family altar amen prayer
[1:12:56] reading the
[1:12:58] Bible telling the family we are going to
[1:13:01] serve
[1:13:02] God taking a
[1:13:05] stand you we we just we we can't keep
[1:13:08] saying well you know how so and so is
[1:13:10] and you know this and you know that just
[1:13:13] take a stand I don't care if you stand
[1:13:15] by yourself you take a stand and you say
[1:13:18] me in my house We Shall Serve the
[1:13:21] Lord because if you don't do that
[1:13:24] Satan's going to keep work working his
[1:13:25] way and bringing everything
[1:13:28] down for unto us the Bible says was the
[1:13:31] Gospel preached as Wells unto
[1:13:35] them but the word preached did not
[1:13:37] profit them because it was not mixed
[1:13:40] with faith in them that Heard It In
[1:13:42] other words they came to church but they
[1:13:44] just heard it as the word of
[1:13:49] man they said that's just Brother John
[1:13:56] that's just a man speaking or reading
[1:14:01] the Bible or given his thoughts and
[1:14:05] that's why it's you know for people that
[1:14:07] just maybe come for like maybe four or
[1:14:09] five Services we've had a number of
[1:14:11] people that have done
[1:14:13] that they're looking for
[1:14:16] something that fits
[1:14:18] them right instead of
[1:14:22] like is this where the truth is at
[1:14:25] because the truth is the only thing that
[1:14:27] sets us free from our old nature to the
[1:14:30] nature of God truth is the only thing
[1:14:33] that can set us free and if we get if we
[1:14:36] get complacent we get tired we we don't
[1:14:38] want the truth we murmur We complain we
[1:14:41] thought we had things easier when we can
[1:14:42] do what we want to do then yes God will
[1:14:45] let us go back in the world he'll let us
[1:14:47] go get another
[1:14:49] church but I'm telling you the bride is
[1:14:52] going to stay with the word
[1:14:55] no matter what she'll stay with the
[1:14:59] word and we need to
[1:15:02] fear we need to fear
[1:15:06] that we don't miss what this word can do
[1:15:10] for our life don't come
[1:15:13] complacent the Bible says faith which
[1:15:16] worketh by
[1:15:19] love Faith which worketh by love fall in
[1:15:24] love with the word of God fall in love
[1:15:27] with the word
[1:15:29] because you're not going to get hindered
[1:15:31] if you're in love with the word if you
[1:15:33] don't love the word then any little
[1:15:35] persuasion comes by it's going to take
[1:15:37] you away from your responsibility
[1:15:39] brother baham said you need to be at
[1:15:41] your post of Duty every time the doors
[1:15:43] are open but you know what people say
[1:15:45] they're in the message but they're
[1:15:52] not the message has to be in you
[1:15:56] Amen in other words that word needs to
[1:15:58] be real to
[1:16:02] you Jude reminds us of our
[1:16:04] responsibility in Jude the very first
[1:16:08] chapter of Jude and it's also the very
[1:16:10] last chapter of
[1:16:12] Jude Jude 1 I want to start with verse
[1:16:15] 17 but beloved remember ye The Words
[1:16:18] which were spoken before by the Apostles
[1:16:20] of our Lord Jesus Christ and he's
[1:16:22] basically speaking of the same things
[1:16:24] that we just just heard he said how that
[1:16:27] they told you that there should be
[1:16:28] mockers in the last
[1:16:30] [Music]
[1:16:32] time I don't need to
[1:16:38] go who should walk after their own Godly
[1:16:48] lust these be they who separate
[1:16:52] themselves from the body of Christ
[1:16:56] sensual what that means is natural
[1:16:59] carnal having not the Holy Ghost but you
[1:17:04] tell them they don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:17:07] and they're
[1:17:08] offended but you know
[1:17:10] what I'm here at this ppet to say if
[1:17:13] you're not walking with the word you
[1:17:15] need to be checking out what ghost you
[1:17:18] got brother bandam said the Holy Ghost
[1:17:21] feeds on the word if you got it why
[1:17:24] ain't the Holy Ghost feeding on the word
[1:17:30] here but ye beloved verse 20 these two
[1:17:34] verses I want to get to but ye beloved
[1:17:37] building up
[1:17:39] yourself on the Most Holy Faith praying
[1:17:42] in the Holy Ghost keeping yourself in
[1:17:44] the love of God looking for the mercy of
[1:17:46] our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life
[1:17:49] this is not the pastor's
[1:17:52] job the pastor's job is not to build you
[1:17:57] up you're supposed to build yourself up
[1:18:00] because you need to use your time to do
[1:18:02] it not my
[1:18:05] time it's your faith not my faith you
[1:18:09] need to pray in the Holy Ghost not
[1:18:12] somebody for you you need to pray you
[1:18:14] need to keep yourself in love with
[1:18:17] God I can't keep in love I can't keep
[1:18:21] you in love with God if you don't want
[1:18:23] to hang out out and get serious with
[1:18:26] real Believers and you just want to use
[1:18:27] them for what you can get out of them
[1:18:29] you're going to fall in love with
[1:18:31] God we ought to be looking for the
[1:18:34] mercies of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:36] Christ the just look at your life and
[1:18:40] you can tell whether the word of God has
[1:18:43] taken effect inside or you've lost your
[1:18:46] love for the
[1:18:51] Bible an awesome responsibility that's
[1:18:54] been
[1:18:55] been given to us turn with me in our
[1:18:57] opening scripture now in first
[1:19:00] Thessalonians chapter 2 but I want to
[1:19:01] start with verse with verse um uh um
[1:19:07] seven verse number seven an if we could
[1:19:09] get that up there it wasn't even in my
[1:19:11] notes for you 1 Thessalonians chapter 2
[1:19:14] verse number s so notice here but we but
[1:19:19] we were gentle among you even as a nurse
[1:19:25] cheth her
[1:19:28] children now that's pretty gentle isn't
[1:19:31] it and this is talking about the the
[1:19:33] ministry now right this is Paul among
[1:19:36] the Thessalonian
[1:19:38] church so being affectionately desires
[1:19:41] of
[1:19:42] you he he goes on to
[1:19:45] express the very heart of a pastor here
[1:19:50] he says we were willing to have imparted
[1:19:52] unto you not the gospel of God only but
[1:19:58] also our own Souls because you were dear
[1:20:02] unto us so we're setting this this
[1:20:05] Foundation here that Paul really had a
[1:20:09] burden when he preached the
[1:20:11] gospel it was preaching out of love it
[1:20:14] wasn't I'm upset I'm at I'm angry at you
[1:20:18] I am bothered at you look there is one
[1:20:21] man I'm very bothered with and that's
[1:20:24] the devil
[1:20:26] because he is the one that tricks
[1:20:30] people and he needs to be called out you
[1:20:33] know the thing is we can only call him
[1:20:36] out in our
[1:20:38] life and and if we do that we can get
[1:20:41] you know we can
[1:20:42] get down to business with
[1:20:45] God and look so he goes on to to express
[1:20:49] this great love he says for you remember
[1:20:51] Brethren our labor and we travailed all
[1:20:53] the time that we spent with you for we
[1:20:56] labored day and night because you would
[1:20:58] not be chargeable unto any of you we
[1:21:01] preached unto you the gospel of God and
[1:21:04] you are
[1:21:05] witnesses and God also how holy and
[1:21:08] justly and unblamable we behaved
[1:21:10] ourselves among you that
[1:21:16] believed and you know how we exhorted
[1:21:19] and we comforted and charged every one
[1:21:21] of you as a father doth his
[1:21:26] children so you can see there's just a
[1:21:28] real
[1:21:30] heart of of
[1:21:32] love that that Paul is is having here as
[1:21:36] a father does for his children that you
[1:21:38] would walk according to what the word of
[1:21:41] God says walk
[1:21:42] worthy who have called you into the new
[1:21:45] light walk in the light as he gives you
[1:21:47] the light and for this cause also thank
[1:21:51] we god without ceasing because when you
[1:21:54] receive Reed the word of God which he
[1:21:56] heard of us you received it not as it as
[1:22:00] the word of men but as it is in truth
[1:22:04] the word of God which effectually
[1:22:06] worketh also in you that believe the
[1:22:11] word of God cannot work if we don't
[1:22:14] believe the word cannot work out our
[1:22:16] problems if we're not trusting the word
[1:22:19] if we're not having confidence in the
[1:22:21] word if we're not relying on the word if
[1:22:23] we're if we're not believing the word
[1:22:25] that word cannot help us it can't help
[1:22:28] our problems we'll sit in our
[1:22:30] misery why sit here till we die the
[1:22:34] problem isn't the the the the Bible it
[1:22:38] isn't God it isn't the church it isn't
[1:22:40] the
[1:22:41] people it's our faith in the word of God
[1:22:44] this is a personal relationship between
[1:22:46] us and
[1:22:49] God the word can only be active made Al
[1:22:55] alive made
[1:22:57] powerful when we believe otherwise it's
[1:23:01] just like a brand new car sitting out
[1:23:05] there you you
[1:23:07] can't if there's no
[1:23:09] spark if there's no
[1:23:13] gas the thing will not do is potential
[1:23:17] but you put the spark you put the gas
[1:23:19] you turn that baby it starts you can get
[1:23:21] it you can drive anywhere this word will
[1:23:25] take us anywhere we want to go it'll
[1:23:28] take us to Joy it'll take us to peace
[1:23:30] it'll take us to love it'll take us to
[1:23:33] the promised land it'll take us to the
[1:23:35] Holy Ghost but we've got to believe it
[1:23:39] Saints we got to recognize the spirits
[1:23:41] are attacking our homes they're
[1:23:42] attacking our church they're attacking
[1:23:44] our minds and we need to take a
[1:23:47] stand stand for the
[1:23:50] word because it's the only thing that
[1:23:52] can save us
[1:23:55] the word preached did not profit them
[1:23:57] not being mixed with faith in them that
[1:24:00] heard
[1:24:02] it we got to mix it we got to say Amen
[1:24:05] to it we got to say Lord I want this for
[1:24:08] my life I want this for my family I want
[1:24:11] this for my children I want this at work
[1:24:13] I want this with my friends I want this
[1:24:16] Lord love the
[1:24:19] word I want this for my life I want this
[1:24:21] for my
[1:24:23] heart we don't do that it's just a dead
[1:24:26] letter we have a form of
[1:24:29] godliness we have just enough of God to
[1:24:33] to be
[1:24:35] miserable God's supposed to be a god of
[1:24:38] joy in his presence is fullness of joy
[1:24:41] but we can get to a place where we only
[1:24:44] have enough of God to be
[1:24:46] miserable right because God has an
[1:24:50] expectation that we would walk in more
[1:24:52] light than what our flesh wants to
[1:24:55] turn with me if you would to Romans
[1:24:57] chapter 10 Romans chapter 10 starting
[1:25:00] with verse number
[1:25:04] 13 For Whom Shall for whosoever shall
[1:25:08] call upon the name of the Lord shall be
[1:25:10] saved I love this scripture it's a
[1:25:11] beautiful scripture this is the promise
[1:25:15] if we don't call on upon the name of the
[1:25:17] Lord with faith how shall God save us
[1:25:19] from any
[1:25:21] situation not just salvation but I'm
[1:25:24] talking about Deliverance I'm talking
[1:25:26] about overcoming I'm talking about
[1:25:28] anything from from problems we've got to
[1:25:32] literally we talked about a little bit
[1:25:34] this um earlier today in our men's
[1:25:38] meeting but you know this altar used to
[1:25:41] be flooded with
[1:25:44] people yes I'm a witness this altar used
[1:25:46] to often be filled with people who would
[1:25:50] come and call upon the name of the Lord
[1:25:55] who hindered you because if you don't
[1:25:58] call upon the name of the Lord with
[1:26:00] faith not just say God you know I need
[1:26:03] I'm going to believe no call call
[1:26:09] seek God is looking for us to reach out
[1:26:12] with a a
[1:26:14] hunger I need you
[1:26:16] Lord and with the promisees you shall be
[1:26:21] saved and don't be satisfied with
[1:26:23] salvation
[1:26:25] be satisfied with seeing the holy ghost
[1:26:27] in your in your home in your
[1:26:30] life verse 14 how then shall they call
[1:26:34] on him in whom they have not believed
[1:26:38] and how shall they believe in him of
[1:26:40] whom they have not heard and how shall
[1:26:42] they hear without a
[1:26:48] Preacher Brother Dennis is a pretty good
[1:26:50] preacher out there
[1:26:55] he goes and he shares the word giving
[1:26:59] them a chance to call upon the name of
[1:27:02] the
[1:27:04] Lord how are we going to call on God if
[1:27:07] we're entertaining thoughts well we're
[1:27:10] just that's just brother John talking
[1:27:11] right now he's just like you know
[1:27:14] talking directly to me really the other
[1:27:16] people they shouldn't even came to
[1:27:17] church because he's just talking so much
[1:27:19] to
[1:27:20] me they're entertaining thoughts
[1:27:24] that is Brother John and not the word of
[1:27:27] God right we must believe that we're
[1:27:30] hearing from God through the office that
[1:27:33] God has ordained and and we don't we
[1:27:36] shouldn't be leaving the church and
[1:27:38] sitting in the in the
[1:27:41] couches amen we shouldn't be getting up
[1:27:44] and going in other Church 15 times and I
[1:27:47] know I understand I I praise God for the
[1:27:50] faithful examples but here if we want to
[1:27:53] really see
[1:27:54] things changed in life we need to get in
[1:27:57] love with the word come as close as you
[1:28:00] can to the word and say God I want to
[1:28:02] leave here change because I'm telling
[1:28:04] you God has not changed his love toward
[1:28:08] you he has not changed the word has not
[1:28:13] changed I'll say it like this the church
[1:28:15] has not changed it still has that
[1:28:19] Vision but something has hindered you
[1:28:23] that you should not OB obey the truth
[1:28:25] there's a persuasion out there trying to
[1:28:28] get us
[1:28:30] lukewarm all right verse 15 how shall
[1:28:32] they preach except they be
[1:28:35] sent as it is written how beautiful are
[1:28:38] the free are the are the feet of them
[1:28:40] that preach the gospel of peace isn't
[1:28:43] that beautiful of peace and bring Glad
[1:28:47] Tidings of good child you ever come to
[1:28:49] church and feel like you didn't hear
[1:28:52] peace and you didn't hear any Glad
[1:28:54] Tidings of good
[1:28:56] things right you ever you ever do
[1:29:00] that well I believe that verse 15 is not
[1:29:05] speaking the gospel is not the scripture
[1:29:08] is not always talking about a Feelgood
[1:29:11] Prosperity message and I'm going to try
[1:29:13] to prove that right now when the Angels
[1:29:16] appeared to the Shepherds and said fear
[1:29:17] not for behold I bring you good tidings
[1:29:20] of great joy which shall be to all
[1:29:23] people For unto you unto you is Born
[1:29:27] This Day in the city of David a
[1:29:30] savior which is Christ the
[1:29:34] lord now it was
[1:29:37] a it was Christ to the mass but it
[1:29:40] wasn't like a Christmas present for
[1:29:43] everybody and what I mean by that is
[1:29:46] when the Savior came to age the very
[1:29:49] savior that they announced the Good
[1:29:51] Tidings when he came to age and he
[1:29:53] brought the gospel he said you must be
[1:29:56] born again or you can't enter in so the
[1:29:59] very savior told us how to be
[1:30:05] saved and and if we follow the word we
[1:30:10] got
[1:30:11] peace that's that's good
[1:30:14] tidings but see the world wants peace
[1:30:17] and good tidings without
[1:30:21] sacrifice they want to feel good message
[1:30:24] they want to feel that they're not you
[1:30:26] know being challenged
[1:30:29] basically and and that's that's that's
[1:30:32] in the world that's in the worldly
[1:30:33] church that's not
[1:30:35] here we've we've got to take the word
[1:30:38] all the word we we just can't act in way
[1:30:42] we want and say I'm born again don't try
[1:30:44] to tell me
[1:30:45] different I want your life to speak to
[1:30:48] me that is born again I want to hear of
[1:30:51] your affairs
[1:30:54] that you're born again you understand
[1:30:56] what I'm
[1:30:58] saying verse 16 now but they have not
[1:31:03] all obeyed see there it
[1:31:05] is so when the when the when the gospel
[1:31:08] of peace and and the Good
[1:31:10] Tidings of good things Glad Tidings of
[1:31:12] good things when it was preached they
[1:31:14] didn't obey it for they have not all
[1:31:17] obeyed the gospel for Isaiah says Lord
[1:31:21] who have believed our report we come to
[1:31:23] church church we preach the word but I
[1:31:26] say to us how many in this church is
[1:31:29] actually believing
[1:31:35] it who has believed the
[1:31:41] report because the report says press
[1:31:48] in the report is say be faithful
[1:31:54] the report says we need to become like
[1:31:56] Christ we're predestinated to that
[1:31:59] Direction that's what the report
[1:32:01] says but our lives are the report
[1:32:05] card they show they show and look I I
[1:32:10] don't I don't I I really don't want to
[1:32:13] be in this spot of
[1:32:16] well you know I just I just believe you
[1:32:18] know everybody's
[1:32:20] saved look
[1:32:24] that may or not be true and it's not for
[1:32:27] me to
[1:32:29] say but what we should be saying to one
[1:32:32] another is when we think that the others
[1:32:35] are not doing what they should be doing
[1:32:37] we should stand up and say the gospel
[1:32:39] says we should do
[1:32:42] this that's giving them a chance and if
[1:32:46] they say nope don't want it okay okay
[1:32:51] all the more you be faithful all the
[1:32:53] more you be faith faithful
[1:32:55] because God is definitely not going to
[1:32:57] Rapture everybody that's ever stepped
[1:32:59] into this
[1:33:01] church it's not going to but you've got
[1:33:04] to believe your
[1:33:05] bride you've got to believe you are one
[1:33:07] of the few you've got to believe that
[1:33:10] you're going to be the one that's going
[1:33:11] to be faithful to the end and I love
[1:33:14] this 17th verse so then faith comes by
[1:33:19] hearing and the hearing comes from
[1:33:23] hearing from God by the word of God not
[1:33:27] brother soul and
[1:33:29] soul but I say unto you have they not
[1:33:31] all heard Verse 18 yes they all
[1:33:35] heard their sound went out the preaching
[1:33:38] went out the word went out to the ends
[1:33:40] of the word but they have not obeyed so
[1:33:42] I say it like this you've got to mix the
[1:33:45] the word that's being preached in our
[1:33:47] church you got to mix it with faith you
[1:33:49] got to say you got to believe that
[1:33:51] you're going to become it
[1:33:55] this this this this message is to bring
[1:33:58] us into Christlike image it's not to
[1:34:00] make us feel better be better people
[1:34:03] it's to bring us into an image of Christ
[1:34:05] to where we want to do what he does and
[1:34:08] and be be be what he wants us to be the
[1:34:12] calling is so much higher than
[1:34:17] just sometimes I think what we think it
[1:34:20] is Faith is a seed it's the only thing
[1:34:24] that can make the word of God alive in
[1:34:27] our life and that's why it's so
[1:34:28] important to build ourselves up take
[1:34:32] time to build ourselves up in believing
[1:34:36] that this is God in other words there's
[1:34:38] no doubt if we took a test right now
[1:34:40] brother Mar if I had you pass out the
[1:34:41] papers and I had uh brother Luke pass
[1:34:45] out all the
[1:34:46] pens well we would and I asked the
[1:34:48] question how many believe this is the
[1:34:50] word of God we would all say yes Ace the
[1:34:55] test but the real question is which when
[1:34:59] when are you desirous to hear God speak
[1:35:02] this word to
[1:35:06] you because unless he speaks it to you
[1:35:10] how can it be Faith because faith is the
[1:35:13] voice of God spoken to you
[1:35:15] personally so it's not good enough to
[1:35:18] say I believe that's God's word I
[1:35:20] believe it that's not the test the test
[1:35:22] is what has he spoken to you what has he
[1:35:26] spoken to you because when he speaks to
[1:35:28] you it don't matter if everybody's
[1:35:31] against you you know the truth can you
[1:35:32] say Amen to that amen Jesus said my
[1:35:35] words they are spirit and they are
[1:35:40] life so if we perceive them as just
[1:35:42] letters on the paper just words in the
[1:35:44] book or historical facts or stories or
[1:35:47] or things like that then we really can't
[1:35:49] get Faith out of it we've got to believe
[1:35:52] that I'm going to hear from God
[1:35:54] personally Faith cometh by hearing God
[1:35:59] speak this word to us personally when he
[1:36:04] speaks it just understand when he speaks
[1:36:06] to you personally nobody else hears
[1:36:10] it nobody else hears
[1:36:13] it but if we're just hearing the word by
[1:36:17] these natural ears and our natural
[1:36:19] understanding we're all hearing that
[1:36:21] we're all hearing that but that that is
[1:36:24] not enough to believe the
[1:36:27] report the real faith comes when God
[1:36:30] spoke to me
[1:36:34] personally this is how
[1:36:36] much it's important to believe God's
[1:36:40] word Isaiah 5510 says for as the rain
[1:36:42] cometh down and the snow from heaven and
[1:36:45] returneth not thither but but WTH the
[1:36:48] Earth and maketh bring forth uh Bud that
[1:36:51] it may give seed to the so bread to the
[1:36:54] eater so shall my word be that goeth
[1:36:58] forth out of my
[1:36:59] mouth it shall not return unto me void
[1:37:03] but sh it shall
[1:37:05] accomplish that which I please and it
[1:37:08] shall prosper in the thing where unto I
[1:37:11] sent
[1:37:13] it and I love verse 12 here for you
[1:37:16] shall go out with
[1:37:19] joy when you
[1:37:21] truly hear the word of of God and it
[1:37:25] sinks down in your heart it will prosper
[1:37:29] the in your life for you shall go out
[1:37:32] with joy and be led forth with peace and
[1:37:36] the mountains and the hills shall Break
[1:37:38] Forth before you into singing and the
[1:37:40] Trees of the field shall clap their
[1:37:43] hands because the word is real to you no
[1:37:47] wonder David said one thing if I desired
[1:37:49] of the Lord and that I seek after all
[1:37:51] the days of my life that I would Dell
[1:37:55] well I want to be where God is
[1:38:01] at I want to be where God is
[1:38:06] at Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[1:38:11] light unto my
[1:38:14] path I want us to start coming to church
[1:38:16] I want us to start talking to others in
[1:38:18] our
[1:38:19] church those of you that are live
[1:38:21] streaming those of you that watching the
[1:38:23] archive I want us to talk about the
[1:38:26] power of the word that the word is
[1:38:28] really a light it's not a dos and don'ts
[1:38:32] it's a light to our
[1:38:34] path it shows us where to
[1:38:38] walk it shows us it shows us do we go to
[1:38:42] church every time the doors are open or
[1:38:44] don't we see it's a
[1:38:47] light does it say we can just you know
[1:38:50] uh treat people bad no it's a light it
[1:38:52] tells us how to treat Jesus said that to
[1:38:55] do unto others as we'd had them to do
[1:38:57] unto us see the word is a lamp to our
[1:39:00] feet
[1:39:03] spiritually but we got to fall in love
[1:39:05] with the word I want to please the
[1:39:08] Lord that that if that's not
[1:39:10] priority coming to church is probably
[1:39:13] not a real big interest to to
[1:39:16] people it's the truth look look the the
[1:39:20] gospel is not made to change your
[1:39:28] will if that's true then that God would
[1:39:31] have nothing but
[1:39:33] robots the word is presented to show
[1:39:36] this is God's love for you he loves you
[1:39:40] as a father does his children he he he
[1:39:43] cherish you he he nurtures you he
[1:39:46] cares but God is not going to come out
[1:39:48] of his word to have a personal
[1:39:50] relationship with you he is not going to
[1:39:52] step out out of his word go into your
[1:39:55] life to have a personal relationship
[1:39:56] with
[1:39:57] you God wants us in love with who he is
[1:40:02] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:40:04] forever he never is going to change all
[1:40:08] right it is time is filled with um lots
[1:40:14] of minutes you know that's all I'm going
[1:40:15] to say about that remember the
[1:40:19] Centurion remember the Centurion came to
[1:40:21] the Lord
[1:40:23] and he
[1:40:24] [Music]
[1:40:25] said I I I have a servant if you would
[1:40:28] just if you would heal him and Jesus
[1:40:31] said I'm I'm coming and and he said no
[1:40:33] not needed just speak the word only the
[1:40:37] faith was in the
[1:40:39] word we've got to take this because what
[1:40:42] what did Jesus say he said go thy
[1:40:46] way as thou H has believed so it be done
[1:40:50] to thee and his servant was healed in
[1:40:52] the self same hour he said verily I say
[1:40:55] to you I have not found so great a
[1:41:00] faith because he recognized that the
[1:41:02] word of God is Authority in the
[1:41:05] spiritual realm over
[1:41:07] demons and we've got to believe that
[1:41:10] this word is real if Satan can get us to
[1:41:12] just think that this is just
[1:41:15] church he's taken the effect of the word
[1:41:17] out of
[1:41:18] us we've got to believe that that that
[1:41:22] God sent me to this Church to build my
[1:41:24] relationship with
[1:41:26] God and I I'm I'm I'm going to stay the
[1:41:29] course I'm going to stay in line I'm
[1:41:31] gonna I'm going to stay right there
[1:41:33] because there's an expected end that God
[1:41:36] has faith is a substance it's a real
[1:41:41] substance and it will make the word
[1:41:45] live because God used the same thing
[1:41:49] that we need to change our life he used
[1:41:51] that same substance of faith to to
[1:41:54] create worlds to create the world we
[1:41:56] live
[1:41:57] in to create everything he used Faith
[1:42:01] the the elders obtained a good report
[1:42:04] through faith the Bible tells us that uh
[1:42:08] um that that not only the elders but but
[1:42:13] look at Enoch uh
[1:42:16] Enoch he had a testimony he he he was he
[1:42:21] was he had a testimony that he he
[1:42:23] pleased God he walked with God by by
[1:42:26] faith Noah he was a
[1:42:29] witness uh Abel was was a was a witness
[1:42:34] that that that that his Revelation was
[1:42:37] was a witness that that he truly
[1:42:40] received from God what to
[1:42:42] do and when we come to church I
[1:42:45] understand there's lots of spirits lots
[1:42:46] of things going on lots of things going
[1:42:48] on in our lives in our world we got to
[1:42:50] come to church and we got to get real
[1:42:51] serious about one thing I got to hear
[1:42:53] from God I've got to hear from God
[1:42:56] because things are going to go They're
[1:42:59] not they're not going to we don't have
[1:43:02] what we need to defeat the
[1:43:06] Devil we need God to do that in
[1:43:11] us that's that's why we got to come to
[1:43:14] church with a desperation God I humble
[1:43:17] myself before you because honestly the
[1:43:19] Rapture is going to take place brother
[1:43:21] bam said people are still going to come
[1:43:24] to the altar thinking they're getting
[1:43:26] saved this this
[1:43:27] mentality so we we just I'm so glad that
[1:43:31] we got the word that we just gota we
[1:43:34] gotta pinch our conscience brother B
[1:43:37] said you know I think we got to pinch
[1:43:39] our conscious more now than back then
[1:43:42] right because Le to see us so much
[1:43:43] stronger let's Stand Together God bless
[1:43:49] you build keep building
[1:43:53] keep building yourself keep praying in
[1:43:56] the Holy Ghost keep yourself in love
[1:43:58] with
[1:44:00] God and encourage others encourage
[1:44:04] others as you talk to them as they come
[1:44:07] to church encourage them to press in I
[1:44:11] believe that when you do that you're
[1:44:14] doing exactly what God has want you to
[1:44:16] do I believe that because
[1:44:23] God wants us all to make
[1:44:24] it and we we we need one
[1:44:27] another
[1:44:29] amen let's sing
[1:44:35] um I I love him let's just sing I love
[1:44:38] him fall love with the
[1:44:41] word
