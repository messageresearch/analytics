[35:45] Lord. We love you this evening. Pray
[35:48] that you would come in the breaking of
[35:50] the bread of life now, Lord. that as
[35:53] your word is ministered that there'd be
[35:54] something in here that would cause us to
[35:56] draw closer to you
[35:59] and that would just strengthen us and
[36:02] fortify us for the uh hour that we're
[36:04] living in the days that are laying
[36:06] before us. Lord, for you
[36:10] you are you gave these words when you
[36:13] walked the earth before and they were he
[36:17] that endureth to the end. The same shall
[36:20] be saved. And Lord, we're looking for
[36:22] strength to endure to the end. May you
[36:26] strengthen all of us here through thy
[36:28] word. Lord, pray that you'd be with
[36:31] those that are are are not with us today
[36:36] that your spirit would go before them
[36:38] and draw them by your spirit.
[36:41] Lord, give them what they have need of
[36:44] that they could serve you with all their
[36:47] heart and might as you would desire them
[36:50] to do. We also pray, Lord, that you'd be
[36:52] with those that could not be here
[36:54] tonight for one reason or another. Those
[36:57] that are live streaming, may your
[36:59] presence be with them in their homes.
[37:02] Lord, we thank you for these things in
[37:04] advance now. For we pray in Jesus
[37:06] Christ's name. Amen.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hebrews chapter 2, starting with
[37:12] verse number 1 through 4. Therefore, we
[37:16] ought to give the more earnest heed to
[37:18] the things which we have heard, lest at
[37:21] any time we should let them slip. For if
[37:26] the word spoken by angels was steadfast,
[37:29] and every transgression and disobedience
[37:33] uh received a just res recompense of
[37:36] reward,
[37:37] how shall we escape if we neglect so
[37:40] great a salvation,
[37:43] which at first began to be spoken by the
[37:46] Lord and confirmed unto us by them that
[37:48] heard him. God also bearing witness both
[37:52] with signs and wonders and with diver
[37:54] miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost
[37:56] according to his own will. And God bless
[38:00] you. May be seated. Well, we see here in
[38:03] the scriptures this the comment is
[38:06] coming out that that we ought to give
[38:10] the more earnest heed to the things that
[38:13] we have heard lest at any time we should
[38:15] let them slip. and then given us an
[38:19] example of how powerful this statement
[38:21] is at the angels in heaven left their
[38:25] first estate and there was given a
[38:30] recompense of reward. The Bible says
[38:33] that that uh hell was created for the
[38:36] devil and his angels. It wasn't really
[38:38] created for us, but it was created for
[38:41] those angels. And they're they're
[38:43] they're receiving
[38:45] a recompense of reward. And if they're
[38:48] going to receive that reward, how shall
[38:50] we escape if we just neglect
[38:54] so great a salvation?
[38:57] And
[38:59] that word um ought um therefore we ought
[39:04] almost seems like we have an option.
[39:06] Like we can but we really don't need to.
[39:10] But what that word ought means, if you
[39:13] look it up, it means we need to. It's
[39:16] necessary and we must.
[39:20] So it's not an option. It's important
[39:23] that we take heed to the word of God.
[39:26] Amen.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Give the more earnest heed doesn't mean,
[39:31] "Oh, I already know. I've heard that
[39:33] before. I know that scriptures already."
[39:37] That's not what it means to give them
[39:38] more earnest heed. What that means is to
[39:41] hold your mind towards, to pay
[39:44] attention, to be cautious about, to
[39:47] apply oneself, to adhere, to give
[39:50] attendance
[39:51] or or uh be given to. So, it's pretty
[39:56] strong. It's more It means super
[39:59] abundantly, more exceedingly, and more
[40:03] frequently. That's what it means to give
[40:05] the more earnest heed to.
[40:08] That's pretty powerful, right? You you
[40:11] think when you read the Bible, it can
[40:12] kind of mean one thing, but I think it's
[40:15] it's a very strong meaning,
[40:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:19] &gt;&gt; How shall we escape if we neglect so
[40:22] great a salvation? That word neglect
[40:25] means to be careless.
[40:28] It means to to make light of to be
[40:32] negligent or to disregard.
[40:36] If we are careless or disregard or make
[40:39] light of the salvation that God has
[40:41] given us, we shall not escape judgment.
[40:46] Now, this this is just the scriptures
[40:48] here. In other words, to neglect the
[40:50] word of God is equivalent to reject the
[40:54] word of God. Now, I know that's pretty
[40:55] powerful, but that is the scripture.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; It sends the same message to God that
[41:02] we're not caring enough.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; We want to entitle this message caring,
[41:06] but not enough.
[41:09] God has this great harbor of salvation
[41:12] for us to dwell in. But if we're not
[41:16] sober and vigilant and watching, the the
[41:18] currents of this world are going to suck
[41:20] us back into the world. So, we must pay
[41:23] attention to the word of God when it's
[41:26] being ministered to us. We may not think
[41:28] we need what's being preached on, but we
[41:31] must believe that we need the word of
[41:33] God. We need all the word of God. Amen.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; And if I could say it like this, if
[41:36] you're just a super super super strong
[41:38] Christian, well, maybe you need this
[41:40] word to help someone that is not
[41:44] &gt;&gt; a strong Christian. Either way, we need
[41:47] the word of God. Therefore, we must
[41:49] exceedingly, super abundantly adhere
[41:51] ourselves to the word of God with
[41:53] superglue.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Don't let it slip.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Super glue like
[42:03] &gt;&gt; adheres. Another scripture just laying a
[42:06] foundation here. 1 Corinthians 15:es 1
[42:09] and 2. 1 Corinthians 15:1 and2 if you
[42:11] want to write it down. Moreover,
[42:12] brethren, I declare unto you the gospel
[42:16] which I preached unto you, which also
[42:19] you have received and were in you stand
[42:22] by the which
[42:24] you are saved if you keep in memory what
[42:28] I preached unto you, unless you have
[42:30] believed in vain. In other words, you
[42:33] can receive the gospel that was preached
[42:35] unto you at one time. You can stand in
[42:38] it
[42:40] and you're saved by it. But if you
[42:43] forget what was preached unto you,
[42:47] your faith can be in vain.
[42:52] In other words, we are not of the church
[42:54] that believes once saved, always saved.
[42:57] It doesn't matter what you do. Just
[42:58] because I repented, I got baptized.
[43:03] I I can pretty much live any kind of
[43:06] life I want to. And I know that I'm
[43:08] saved because I believed.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; We are a church that believes in the
[43:14] full word of God.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; That we go, we continue to believe. We
[43:19] continue to walk with the Lord. We
[43:21] continue to grow in the things of God.
[43:24] And we don't want to forget that because
[43:29] there are those is it there in in Jude
[43:32] if you want to pull it up. I think Jude
[43:34] maybe verse five. Let me pull that up
[43:36] real quick. Um
[43:41] and you know we just can't always stick
[43:42] these in there. I can almost quote it.
[43:44] Um I will therefore put you in
[43:46] remembrance though ye once knew this.
[43:49] how that the Lord having saved the
[43:51] people out of the land of Egypt were
[43:53] after E out of the land of Egypt
[43:55] afterwards destroyed them that believe
[43:58] not. In other words, they forgot that
[44:01] God gave them a mighty deliverance out
[44:03] of Egypt when they facing uh the
[44:06] promised land.
[44:08] He said, "If you're not going to
[44:10] continue to walk with me, then I'm going
[44:13] to destroy you." And this is the God
[44:16] that for God so loved the world. This is
[44:20] that God of love that loves us, wants us
[44:24] to not forget what he's trying to do for
[44:27] us and lead us to and the word that that
[44:31] he said that I'm going to give you a
[44:33] promised land. Now, that's what he told
[44:35] the children of Israel when they were
[44:37] yet in Egypt.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; So, they came out and they were happy.
[44:43] But God said this is not good enough. We
[44:45] got to go into a a complete nature
[44:47] change and we don't want to forget that.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; So if we give the more earnest heed, if
[44:54] if we keep in memory, we give them more
[44:57] earnest heed, if we exceedingly super
[44:59] abundantly adhere ourselves to the word
[45:01] of God with superglue, we're going to be
[45:03] saved. We're going to be fine. We're
[45:05] going to endure to the end. How many
[45:07] people do we know, do we see, have we
[45:09] seen over the years, they went back into
[45:11] the world? they slip back. So, this this
[45:14] service is is is a real message. It's
[45:17] it's it's a real time message. It's it
[45:20] it's it's not something of something of
[45:22] the days gone by, but it is something
[45:25] for us to to make sure that this is
[45:28] real. The devil does not stop trying to
[45:31] drag us back in the world. That's right.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; So to hear and say amen to the truth and
[45:38] let it slip away through neglect is the
[45:41] same as rejecting the word of God. And
[45:45] this is the scariest thing. I think this
[45:46] is why people so many people miss it
[45:49] because they think if I just kind of
[45:52] slide back a little bit, it doesn't mean
[45:54] I'm saying no to God. It does mean
[45:56] you're saying no to God. It's the evil
[45:58] heart of unbelief and departing from a
[46:00] living God because we serve a living
[46:02] God. We don't serve a God that just died
[46:04] at Calvary. We serve a God who gave us
[46:06] the breath of life today, who blessed us
[46:09] today, who's answered our prayers today.
[46:11] We serve a living God. And he does not
[46:14] want us to back off from that.
[46:17] For if the word spoken by the angels was
[46:20] steadfast, and every transgression and
[46:22] disobedience received a just
[46:24] recoccupants reward, how shall we escape
[46:27] if we neglect so great a salvation?
[46:32] So if we neglect to pay attention in
[46:35] class,
[46:36] those of us that go to school,
[46:39] we'll probably end up flunking.
[46:42] If we're careless while we're cooking
[46:44] the pancakes on the stove, they're
[46:47] probably going to turn burnt.
[46:50] If we neglect to brush our teeth, we'll
[46:53] probably get more cavities.
[46:56] If we make light of our customers, we'll
[46:59] eventually lose them. If we disregard
[47:02] our body, our body will suffer for it.
[47:04] How many times have we heard, "Oh, I
[47:06] wish I would have known I was doing this
[47:09] to my body. I wanted I would have
[47:11] stopped years ago.
[47:13] And if we neglect our soul, our soul
[47:16] will suffer for it. So, we don't want to
[47:19] neglect the word of God. Amen. Turn with
[47:22] me if you would to James chapter 1.
[47:25] We were in James chapter 1 in our men's
[47:27] meeting. We kind of ended near there, I
[47:29] think, but we want to hop down to verse
[47:32] number 19. James chapter 1 verse 19.
[47:36] But this remembering now our theme is
[47:38] caring but we but we we want to care
[47:42] enough.
[47:44] Caring but we want to care enough.
[47:46] Wherefore my beloved brethren let every
[47:48] man be swift to hear, slow to speak and
[47:52] slow to wrath. For the wrath of man
[47:54] workketh not the righteousness of God.
[47:57] Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[48:00] superfluity of naughtiness, and receive
[48:02] with meekness the engrafted word which
[48:05] is able to save your souls.
[48:09] But be ye doers of the word and not
[48:11] hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
[48:15] For if any man be a hearer of the word
[48:17] and not a doer, he's like unto a man
[48:20] beholding his natural face in the glass.
[48:23] For he beholdeth himself and goeth his
[48:25] way, and straightway forgetth what
[48:26] manner of man he was. But whosoever
[48:28] lookth into the word of God, called the
[48:31] perfect law of liberty, and continueth
[48:34] therein, he being not a forgetful
[48:37] hearer, but a doer of the work. This is
[48:39] the man that's going to be blessed in
[48:42] his deed.
[48:44] So if any man among you seem to be
[48:46] religious, and bright not his tongue,
[48:48] but deceiveth his own heart, this man's
[48:51] religion is vain. Pure religion
[48:53] undevoured of God and the father is this
[48:55] to visit the fatherless and the widows
[48:56] and their affliction and to keep himself
[48:59] unspotted from the world. If I could say
[49:00] it like this um real religion is living
[49:03] the life.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; It's not saying I believe this and not
[49:08] living that. We have to go out and be we
[49:12] have to be the gospel.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; We have to we have to be the gospel to
[49:16] those that are around us. it it's not
[49:18] something that we we have privately
[49:20] inside our home or privately inside the
[49:23] church. It's something that we go and we
[49:26] display. We let the world know this is
[49:29] what we believe.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; And uh if we're a doer of the word, the
[49:34] Bible says that we're going to be
[49:36] blessed.
[49:37] And I if I want to be more blessed, it
[49:40] isn't about me saying, "God, bless me
[49:42] more." It's about be about me being more
[49:44] of a doer
[49:46] &gt;&gt; because I'm going to automatically be
[49:48] blessed if I if I do the word of God
[49:51] because that's what the word says that
[49:52] it cannot lie.
[49:55] So what causes someone to neglect
[49:59] or what causes someone to be neglectful?
[50:02] This is a good question.
[50:04] What is it? What causes someone to be
[50:06] careless or to make light of something
[50:09] or to be
[50:12] negligent or to disregard something?
[50:16] What would what would cause this?
[50:20] Or say it again. Pride. Okay.
[50:25] Definitely pride is there because
[50:29] they don't need to do it.
[50:33] But we've all dealt with somebody either
[50:36] co-workers or or children or or people
[50:39] just trying to help and they're just not
[50:41] putting their heart into what they're
[50:42] doing.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; They just they just this is all they're
[50:45] going to do and that's it.
[50:50] But to to be but if you ask them do you
[50:54] care?
[50:55] They would say of course I care.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; They are not going to say I don't care.
[51:07] So at work there's a tendency that if
[51:11] there's a lot of um distractions or
[51:14] talking that jobs will become more
[51:18] scrapped.
[51:21] I mean this is a real thing that brother
[51:22] Ron can relate to.
[51:26] And so dealing with the after fact, the
[51:28] question could be asked, um,
[51:32] what happened here? You're paying
[51:34] attention.
[51:36] I mean, I mean, you you scrapped the
[51:39] job. We got 30 hours and you just
[51:41] grabbed it. Do you care?
[51:45] Of course I care. I wouldn't be working
[51:47] here if I didn't care.
[51:50] Everybody cares. But the question is,
[51:53] how much do you care?
[51:56] you care, but do you care enough to make
[51:58] sure you're double-checking, you're
[52:00] triplechecking, you're making sure that
[52:03] everything is okay?
[52:06] And that's really what the theme of this
[52:08] is because God does not have
[52:12] halfhearted, caring people as a bride.
[52:15] He has a bride that cares about him,
[52:17] cares about what he thinks about him,
[52:19] cares about his word.
[52:23] So it isn't that people don't care. It's
[52:26] all about they don't care enough.
[52:29] They caring but not caring. This all
[52:33] started in heaven when Lucifer who was
[52:35] full wisdom full he was perfect in
[52:38] beauty uh who got lifted up by the
[52:40] reason of his brightness. The Bible says
[52:42] and he drew a third of the angels with
[52:45] him and left their first estate which
[52:47] was heaven. We don't know the length of
[52:50] time uh that Lucifer
[52:53] was there before this happened. But in
[52:57] this state of
[53:01] of doing good, I'll say in the state of
[53:04] caring,
[53:06] Lucifer remained the anointed cherub and
[53:10] he led the worship. We we don't know if
[53:12] it was hundreds of thousands of years.
[53:16] We really don't know how long it was
[53:19] that he actually cared.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; It it it the Bible says he was perfect
[53:25] in all his ways.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; So he didn't he didn't come out of the
[53:29] creation and be a devil.
[53:32] He was actually doing good. He was the
[53:34] one in church and said, "Look at me. We
[53:37] love Jesus. Let's let's all look to
[53:40] Jesus and worship him."
[53:42] He cared about getting the people to
[53:45] look to Jesus.
[53:47] And they were worshiping Jesus, all the
[53:50] angels.
[53:53] And you know what?
[53:55] Lucifer says, "You know what? I would
[53:57] like a little bit of that attention up
[53:58] here.
[54:00] I want a little bit of attention."
[54:04] and he become blind because of pride
[54:10] because he wanted attention. Something
[54:13] happened that triggered
[54:15] him from wanting
[54:18] to give the his own creator glory. He
[54:22] said, "You know what? I think I should
[54:24] get some glory.
[54:26] You know, look at me. I can do things
[54:28] that the other angels can't do."
[54:31] So in his mind he had it set, but we
[54:34] don't know how long that he actually
[54:36] cared.
[54:38] It could have been hundreds of thousands
[54:40] of years. We don't know. But one thing
[54:43] is for sure, he stopped caring.
[54:48] He cared, but not enough.
[54:52] And this is where it all started. Isaiah
[54:55] 14:13. In his heart,
[54:58] he said, "I will ascend into heaven. I
[55:02] will exalt my throne above the stars of
[55:04] God. I will sit also upon the mountain
[55:06] of the congregation in the sides of the
[55:09] north. I will ascend above the heights
[55:11] of the clouds, and I will be like the
[55:14] most high."
[55:17] He cared, but not enough.
[55:23] When someone neglects to do what they
[55:26] know they should be doing, that is
[55:29] really what iniquity is.
[55:32] Knowing what you should be doing and you
[55:34] decide not to do that. Lucifer cared but
[55:38] not enough. Now, I know that's hard to
[55:40] imagine that Lucifer actually cared
[55:43] because we only know him as someone who
[55:46] doesn't who doesn't care,
[55:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:50] &gt;&gt; We know him as a thief, as a liar. We we
[55:53] know him as someone that's trying to
[55:54] take souls from God because we were born
[55:56] and this is where he was. But there was
[55:58] a time that he did care.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; And this is important to understand
[56:03] because we see people at times they seem
[56:05] to care.
[56:07] But then they leave that state of caring
[56:10] and they don't care. They stop caring.
[56:15] Let's take a look at the rich young
[56:17] ruler.
[56:18] Mark chapter 10 verse 17. Are you
[56:22] getting something out of this? Okay.
[56:29] I think this rich young ruler was a man
[56:31] who cared.
[56:35] But we he was also a man who didn't care
[56:38] enough.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Cared but not enough. And when Jesus in
[56:43] verse 17, and when Jesus was gone forth
[56:45] into the way, there came one running
[56:49] and kneelled to him and asked him, "Good
[56:53] master, what shall I do
[56:57] that I may inherit eternal life?" And
[56:59] Jesus said unto him, "Why callst thou me
[57:02] good? There's none good but one, and
[57:04] that is God. And thou knowest the
[57:05] commandments. Do not commit adultery. Do
[57:07] not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear
[57:08] false witness. fraud, not un thy father
[57:11] and mother. And he answered and said
[57:12] unto him, Master, all these have I
[57:15] observed from my youth. Now with that
[57:18] statement, it's obvious that this man
[57:20] cared.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; He cared. He actually came running to
[57:26] Jesus looking for an answer for eternal
[57:30] life.
[57:32] And he gave a reverence and he kneel
[57:34] down before him.
[57:37] There's no doubt if anybody was watching
[57:40] this movie or this play out, they would
[57:43] say that this man cared.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; And and you know, I would be looking at
[57:50] him and say, you know what, I can't go
[57:53] to Jesus and say, I've kept all these
[57:56] commandments from my youth.
[57:58] You know, I I couldn't do that.
[58:02] So, he really had one up on us.
[58:08] And then Jesus beholding him loved him.
[58:11] Oh, I I just love that. In other words,
[58:14] Jesus cared about this man's soul.
[58:18] He loved him and said unto him in this
[58:22] love that he had for him, "One thing
[58:26] thou lackest,
[58:27] go thy way, sell whatsoever thou house,
[58:30] and give it to the poor, and thou shalt
[58:32] have treasures in heaven. come and take
[58:34] up thy cross and follow me.
[58:38] And he and the rich young ruler was sad
[58:42] at this saying and went away grieved
[58:46] for he had great possessions.
[58:48] The rich young ruler cared, but he
[58:51] didn't care enough.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; And he walked away from church grieved.
[58:58] He walked away from his visitation with
[59:02] Jesus Christ
[59:04] sad
[59:07] because what was being asked of him
[59:11] was too much.
[59:14] Bottom line,
[59:16] he's a perfect example of someone who
[59:19] cares but doesn't care enough.
[59:23] And this is this is a real thing that
[59:25] Satan wants to get everybody with is
[59:29] to care, but don't care. You know, don't
[59:32] get sold out. Don't love the Lord thy
[59:34] God with all thy heart, with all thy
[59:36] soul, with all thy might, with all No,
[59:38] just be careful.
[59:42] Just like Pharaoh told Moses, "Well, you
[59:46] can go out there, but you know, don't
[59:48] take the women and children, right?
[59:51] care, but not all the way. And Jesus
[59:57] looked around here in verse 23. And
[59:59] Jesus looked round about and saith unto
[1:00:02] his disciples, how hardly shall they
[1:00:05] that have riches enter into the kingdom
[1:00:09] of God. How hardly I mean, he's making a
[1:00:12] statement that riches make a difference
[1:00:15] in people's life.
[1:00:17] But it isn't just riches because riches
[1:00:20] is a distraction.
[1:00:23] If I have money, I have power to do
[1:00:26] whatever I want to do. And once I have
[1:00:28] that power, you know, maybe I don't need
[1:00:32] what I thought I needed.
[1:00:36] So it it would be better not to be rich
[1:00:39] than you don't have to worry about it.
[1:00:41] Honestly,
[1:00:46] this man, like a lot of people today,
[1:00:48] care about going to heaven, but they
[1:00:50] don't care enough. And they've decided
[1:00:52] to rely on their past to get them there.
[1:00:58] Master, all these I've observed from my
[1:01:00] youth.
[1:01:02] You know, I I I still believe that when
[1:01:04] he walked away from Jesus, he was still
[1:01:07] quoting that scripture because there was
[1:01:10] a battle going on inside of him. I'm not
[1:01:12] going to accept I'm going to hell just
[1:01:14] because I'm not selling everything. If
[1:01:17] I'm lacking one thing,
[1:01:20] either I'm going to agree with the word
[1:01:23] or I'm going to say no.
[1:01:25] But the problem is with a lot of people,
[1:01:27] they walk away from church and they
[1:01:29] still think they're okay in the position
[1:01:31] that they're in.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; And I believe this rich young ruler was
[1:01:35] in the same spot.
[1:01:37] Matthew 7 21, Jesus speaking, "Not
[1:01:40] everyone that saith unto me,"Lord, Lord,
[1:01:42] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven,
[1:01:44] but he that doeth the will of my father
[1:01:46] which is in heaven." So if he says,
[1:01:48] "Sell what you got, then sell it." Many
[1:01:51] will say unto me in that day, Lord,
[1:01:52] Lord, have we not prophesied thy name?
[1:01:55] And in thy name cast out devils, in thy
[1:01:57] name done many wonderful works, and then
[1:02:00] why profess unto them, I never knew you.
[1:02:02] Depart from me that work iniquity.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; So we cannot rely on our past to make it
[1:02:10] when God is asking us to do more. That's
[1:02:13] right.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Perfect examples of people, believers
[1:02:19] that God used. They actually cared. You
[1:02:22] know, if you're going to cast out the
[1:02:23] devil, you actually got to care about
[1:02:24] that person.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; If you're going to do a lot of works for
[1:02:28] the kingdom of God, you actually are
[1:02:30] caring.
[1:02:33] If you're going to let God use your
[1:02:35] vessel to prophesy and speak in tongues
[1:02:37] and interpret tongues, you actually
[1:02:39] care.
[1:02:41] But the bottom line is they don't care
[1:02:44] enough.
[1:02:48] You've got to care enough to do
[1:02:50] everything that God wants you to do. And
[1:02:53] and this is this is hard. But this is
[1:02:57] what we must teach our children. This is
[1:02:59] what we must talk about. This is what we
[1:03:02] must remember that God is a God that
[1:03:05] requires all of our heart.
[1:03:09] Jesus were to ask you today,
[1:03:16] what are you relying on to make it? What
[1:03:18] would your answer be?
[1:03:22] I think it's a good question.
[1:03:24] You're you're you're here today with the
[1:03:27] mindset, how do you know you're where
[1:03:29] you you need to be?
[1:03:33] And
[1:03:36] I think the deeper we dig into that
[1:03:38] question, uh, the closer we can get to
[1:03:40] God,
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; right? Because if if the further we get
[1:03:45] away from that question, the more the
[1:03:47] devil can have his way.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; All right, turn with me to Ezekiel
[1:03:52] chapter 18. We got this is definitely a
[1:03:54] a Bible study tonight.
[1:03:57] I'm gonna have to um speedy up in the
[1:04:02] second half of the service because we
[1:04:04] don't want to get behind.
[1:04:07] Ezekiel 18 verse 20. The soul that
[1:04:10] sinnth it shall die.
[1:04:14] The son shall not bear the iniquity of
[1:04:16] the father, neither shall the father
[1:04:18] bear the iniquity of the son.
[1:04:21] The righteousness of the righteous shall
[1:04:22] be upon him, and the wickedness of the
[1:04:25] wicked shall be upon him. In other
[1:04:26] words, God is not going to blame you for
[1:04:32] your dad's deeds.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; You have a decision to make.
[1:04:38] You choose the right thing, you're going
[1:04:40] to be blessed.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; I know. I I I remember just having
[1:04:46] thoughts, well, I wish my dad would have
[1:04:48] brought me up in the truth. But that was
[1:04:50] about as far as my thoughts ever went
[1:04:55] because I knew
[1:04:58] that I have a decision to make with my
[1:05:00] life. Am I going to serve God on my own
[1:05:03] or am I going to make excuses of why I'm
[1:05:06] not serving God?
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Because that's what we have. We have so
[1:05:09] many people talking about their past and
[1:05:12] what things have happened. And you to
[1:05:14] me, I'm going to tell you like this. Uh
[1:05:16] God is a God that can say from the
[1:05:19] guttermost and and and and bring you to
[1:05:22] a place that Satan can't touch you.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Verse 21. But if the wicked will turn
[1:05:30] from all his sins that he hath committed
[1:05:34] and keep all my statutes and do that
[1:05:37] which is lawful and right,
[1:05:40] he shall surely live, he shall not die.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; How beautiful that is.
[1:05:48] All his transgressions that he have
[1:05:49] committed, they shall not be mentioned
[1:05:52] unto him. In his righteousness that he
[1:05:55] that he have done, he shall live. I want
[1:05:59] us to bring uh something. Well, let me
[1:06:07] Yeah, I'm gonna say it right now.
[1:06:10] You do understand
[1:06:12] that um
[1:06:16] Esau after he had
[1:06:20] gave up from caring enough, I mean he he
[1:06:23] he cared but then he didn't care.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; And when he sold his birthright to
[1:06:29] Jacob, the Bible teaches us
[1:06:34] that he found no place for repentance.
[1:06:38] Even though he repented, even though he
[1:06:40] turned from that way,
[1:06:43] it was too late. And the Bible talks
[1:06:46] about those who are dead while they
[1:06:49] live.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; In other words, they're just playing out
[1:06:51] their time until they're to die.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; So, it isn't a matter of
[1:06:58] always
[1:07:00] that they're alive.
[1:07:03] You can cross the line with God way
[1:07:05] before you're dead.
[1:07:09] And so God knows when you've turned it
[1:07:12] down for the last time.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; And did we hear the prophecy that, you
[1:07:16] know, if God speaks to us, he's not
[1:07:18] obligated to keep asking us.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; So th this this is a it's a serious, you
[1:07:23] know, God is serious.
[1:07:27] All right. Where are we at? Verse 20.
[1:07:32] Verse 23.
[1:07:35] Have I any pleasure at all that the
[1:07:37] wicked should die, sayeth the Lord God,
[1:07:41] and not that he should return from his
[1:07:44] ways and live? So God is expressing that
[1:07:46] he's he wants to do everything he can to
[1:07:48] get everybody a chance to make it.
[1:07:52] But when the righteous turneth away from
[1:07:55] his righteousness,
[1:07:56] and committh iniquity,
[1:07:59] and doth according to all the
[1:08:01] abominations that the wicked man doeth,
[1:08:04] shall he live? Question mark. Shall he
[1:08:06] live?
[1:08:07] All his righteousness that he have done
[1:08:10] shall not even be mentioned. In his
[1:08:13] trespass that he have trespassed, and in
[1:08:15] his sin that he have sinned, in them
[1:08:18] shall he die.
[1:08:22] Yet ye say, "The way of the Lord is not
[1:08:25] equal."
[1:08:27] Here now, oh house of Israel, is not my
[1:08:30] way equal.
[1:08:32] Are your ways unequal?
[1:08:34] Are not your ways unequal? It just
[1:08:36] depends how you want to look at. You
[1:08:38] want to look at it your way or God's
[1:08:39] way?
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; And when a righteous man turneth away
[1:08:42] from his righteousness, and committh
[1:08:44] iniquity, and and dieth in them for his
[1:08:48] iniquity that he have done, shall he
[1:08:50] die? And again, when the wicked man
[1:08:52] turneth away from his wickedness, and
[1:08:54] that he have committed, and doeth that
[1:08:56] which is lawful and right, he shall save
[1:08:59] his soul alive, because he considerth
[1:09:02] and turneth away from all his
[1:09:04] transgressions he have committed, he
[1:09:05] shall surely live. He shall not die. Yet
[1:09:08] ye saith, House of Israel, the Lord, the
[1:09:11] way of the Lord is not equal, oh house
[1:09:13] of Israel, are not my ways equal. Are
[1:09:17] not your ways
[1:09:19] are not my ways equal and not and not
[1:09:22] your ways unequal. So the Lord has a
[1:09:25] different opinion and
[1:09:29] I mean there were two thiefs on the
[1:09:31] cross right? One was remembered at the
[1:09:34] end but if you think about it he never
[1:09:38] had a chance to think about it prior.
[1:09:43] You understand what I'm saying? So
[1:09:45] people who are relying on waiting to the
[1:09:48] end
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; to get saved is not the people that God
[1:09:52] is looking for.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; It it's it's not. And and what I'm
[1:10:00] trying to do here is encourage us to
[1:10:04] make sure we're doing everything we can
[1:10:06] to help people while they have a chance.
[1:10:08] Amen.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Therefore, I will judge you, oh house of
[1:10:14] Israel, everyone according to his ways.
[1:10:16] Verse 30, sayeth the Lord God, repent
[1:10:19] and turn yourself from all your
[1:10:21] transgressions, so iniquity shall not be
[1:10:23] your ruin. Cast away from all your
[1:10:25] transgressions, whereby you have
[1:10:27] transgressed, and make you a new heart
[1:10:29] and a new spirit. For why will you die,
[1:10:31] oh house of Israel? For I have no
[1:10:33] pleasure in the death of him that dieth,
[1:10:35] sayeth the Lord God. Wherefore turn
[1:10:37] yourselves and live ye. Now this is to
[1:10:41] me what the gospel does. When we come to
[1:10:44] church and we hear the word of God being
[1:10:46] preached, we are we are hearing God say,
[1:10:49] "Turn from your will to my will.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Do more of my will." This is what we're
[1:10:56] hearing God speak to us. James 4:1 17,
[1:10:59] I'm just going to quote it. Therefore,
[1:11:01] to him that knoweth to do good and doeth
[1:11:04] it not, to him it is sin. And that's the
[1:11:06] way that God looks at it.
[1:11:11] Wouldn't it be nice if we could just
[1:11:13] say, "Hey, church attendance makes you a
[1:11:14] saint."
[1:11:18] All right, we're going to spend some a
[1:11:19] little bit more time here in Ezekiel
[1:11:21] 33:12. We're going to read verses 12-1
[1:11:25] 17.
[1:11:28] We can see through these scriptures that
[1:11:30] God doesn't want us to care, but he
[1:11:32] wants us to care enough to follow
[1:11:35] through. Right? Just don't don't live,
[1:11:38] you know, 30 years of caring and decide
[1:11:41] not to care.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; All right. Ezekiel 33:12. Therefore,
[1:11:46] thou son of man, say unto the children
[1:11:48] of thy people, the righteousness of the
[1:11:50] righteous shall not deliver him in the
[1:11:52] day of transgression of his trans of his
[1:11:54] transgression. That is such a powerful
[1:11:56] statement. The righteousness of the
[1:11:58] righteous shall not deliver him in the
[1:12:02] day of his transgression.
[1:12:07] Isn't that like scary?
[1:12:12] As for the wicked of the wic as for the
[1:12:14] wickedness of the wicked,
[1:12:17] he shall not fall thereby in the day
[1:12:19] that he turneth from his wickedness.
[1:12:22] Neither shall the righteous be able to
[1:12:24] live. for his righteousness in the day
[1:12:26] that he sinnth. When I shall say to the
[1:12:30] righteous that he shall surely live, if
[1:12:33] he trusts in his own uh righteousness
[1:12:38] and commit iniquity, and all his and all
[1:12:41] his righteousness shall not be
[1:12:43] remembered, for his iniquity that he
[1:12:45] have committed, he shall die for it. And
[1:12:49] again, when I say unto the wicked, thou
[1:12:51] shalt surely die, if he turn from his
[1:12:55] sin, and do that which is lawful and
[1:12:57] right, if the wicked restore the pledge,
[1:13:00] and again uh give again that he had
[1:13:03] robbed and walk in the statutes of life
[1:13:05] without committing iniquity, he shall
[1:13:08] surely live, and shall not die. None of
[1:13:11] his sins that he have committed shall be
[1:13:13] mentioned unto him, and he shall uh he
[1:13:16] uh he have done that which is lawful and
[1:13:18] right, he shall surely live. Yet the
[1:13:21] children of thy people say the way of
[1:13:22] the Lord is not equal. But as for them,
[1:13:25] their way is not equal. So this is just
[1:13:29] the way it is. God is looking for what
[1:13:32] happens at the end.
[1:13:36] That's why Jesus said, "He that endureth
[1:13:38] to the end,
[1:13:40] the same's going to be saved." And it's
[1:13:42] not, "Well, many will come to me in that
[1:13:45] day and say,"Lord, what about these when
[1:13:47] I did good here? What about that?"
[1:13:50] That has nothing to do with where your
[1:13:52] heart is at at the end.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Right? When we when we came to Christ,
[1:13:58] we gave our heart to the Lord when we
[1:14:00] were young
[1:14:02] or whatever age we did, and we said,
[1:14:04] "God, I'm going to serve you. save me.
[1:14:07] Well, that heart needs to be there at
[1:14:08] the end of the journey.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; And really, I'll say to the bride, that
[1:14:14] needs to be there during the journey.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; It needs to be there during the journey.
[1:14:22] Don't rely on anything in your past. The
[1:14:26] Bible says, "Today is the day of
[1:14:28] salvation." Brother quoted that in our
[1:14:30] men's meeting.
[1:14:33] The God that we serve is an I am God.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; He's a God that's the same yesterday,
[1:14:39] today, and forever. He's a present God
[1:14:42] that helps us in our present troubles.
[1:14:45] So if God is a God of today, he wants us
[1:14:49] to serve him today and not rely on what
[1:14:53] I did over here. So it doesn't matter
[1:14:56] what I'm doing now. So we got to finish
[1:14:59] the race. We've got to fight the good
[1:15:01] fight of faith. We got to lay hold of
[1:15:03] eternal life and we got to march forward
[1:15:05] to the finish line. 1 Corinthians
[1:15:08] chapter 9 24 says, "Know ye not that
[1:15:11] they which run in a race run all, but
[1:15:14] one receiveth the prize. So run that you
[1:15:17] may obtain." In other words, Paul is
[1:15:19] saying to us that we are in a race and
[1:15:23] we're not racing against one another.
[1:15:27] We're racing against this carnal man
[1:15:30] that doesn't want to die out every day,
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; that that doesn't want to submit to the
[1:15:36] things of God.
[1:15:38] And we're in that race with him. We
[1:15:40] can't Wouldn't it be nice if we could
[1:15:42] just take him out and
[1:15:44] and not be there? How wonderful that
[1:15:48] would be. But he's there and we got to
[1:15:52] deal with him every day. We get up. We
[1:15:53] look in the mirror
[1:15:56] and we say, "Hate the way you look.
[1:16:02] I hate that you don't want to pray this
[1:16:04] morning.
[1:16:06] I hate that you don't want to you don't
[1:16:08] want to live for others. We hate the old
[1:16:11] man. It's why we crucify him. Die
[1:16:14] daily."
[1:16:17] And every man that striveth for the
[1:16:20] mastery is temperant on all things. Now
[1:16:23] they do it to obtain a corruptible
[1:16:24] crown, but we we do it to obtain an
[1:16:28] incorruptible crown. I therefore so run
[1:16:31] not as uncertainty.
[1:16:34] Like I'm not sure about this. I'm not
[1:16:36] sure.
[1:16:39] I therefore so run. I so fight as one,
[1:16:44] not as one that beatth the air. So he
[1:16:48] doesn't run as uncertainty, doesn't
[1:16:49] fight as if he's not fighting against
[1:16:51] somebody, but I keep under my body and
[1:16:54] bring it into subjection, lest by any
[1:16:56] means when I preach to others, I myself
[1:16:59] should be a castaway.
[1:17:02] So Paul is is speaking to us that we
[1:17:05] have to finish the race.
[1:17:08] There's no and if buts about it. There's
[1:17:10] no other way to get around this. We've
[1:17:12] got to finish the race.
[1:17:16] Paul saying in Galatians chapter 2 verse
[1:17:18] 20, I am crucified with Christ.
[1:17:23] Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but
[1:17:28] it's Christ that liveth in me. And the
[1:17:31] life which I now presently live in the
[1:17:35] flesh, I am living by the faith of the
[1:17:38] son of God who loved me and gave himself
[1:17:40] for me. I'm taking a stand. This is how
[1:17:44] I'm living today.
[1:17:47] Hebrews 12:1, wherefore seeing we also
[1:17:50] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:17:52] witnesses, let us lay aside every
[1:17:55] weight. What's happening to the people
[1:17:57] that are going back in the world?
[1:18:00] They've been putting the weights
[1:18:03] on them instead of get rid of them.
[1:18:07] They've been engaging more in the things
[1:18:08] of the world.
[1:18:11] But we're told here to lay aside every
[1:18:14] weight and the sin that does so easily
[1:18:17] beset us. And let us run with patience
[1:18:21] the race that is set before us. Why?
[1:18:23] With patience. Because we've got to
[1:18:26] endure to the end.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; It's not a sprint. It's not, well, if I
[1:18:30] could just if I could just do this one
[1:18:33] thing, it'll be okay. No, because you
[1:18:35] got other things to overcome tomorrow.
[1:18:37] And there's there's character that's
[1:18:39] going to be built inside your life next
[1:18:41] week. And it's it's all about running
[1:18:44] the race with patience,
[1:18:48] looking onto Jesus. Keep your eyes on
[1:18:51] Jesus, the author and the finisher of
[1:18:53] our faith, who for the joy that was set
[1:18:56] before him, he endured the cross,
[1:18:59] despising the same, and set down the
[1:19:01] right hand of the throne of God. So,
[1:19:02] I'll say it like this. We need to keep
[1:19:05] our eyes on Jesus
[1:19:10] because he's the one that gives us joy
[1:19:13] to endure our cross every day, to pick
[1:19:16] up our cross and follow him.
[1:19:19] So, we've got to to care enough to keep
[1:19:22] caring to the end. Don't fall away.
[1:19:27] Hebrews 3:14 says, "For we are made
[1:19:30] partakers of Christ if we hold the
[1:19:33] beginning of our confidence steadfast to
[1:19:35] the end." We've got to hold on to Christ
[1:19:38] to the end. Don't let it slip.
[1:19:42] Don't let your steadfastness slip away.
[1:19:44] Don't let your confidence slip away.
[1:19:47] Therefore, we ought to give the more
[1:19:49] earnest heed to the things which we've
[1:19:51] heard, lest at any time we should let
[1:19:53] them slip.
[1:19:55] We're living in perilous times. We're
[1:19:58] living in Leodysia,
[1:20:01] lukewarm.
[1:20:03] And I I believe
[1:20:05] we need to shake ourselves
[1:20:09] just naturally speaking. You ever been
[1:20:10] in church and you're falling asleep and
[1:20:12] you just like want to pinch yourself and
[1:20:14] wake up? You know what I'm talking
[1:20:15] about? You can relate to that, can't
[1:20:17] you? Hope not. Hopefully not tonight,
[1:20:19] though. But I mean,
[1:20:24] I have I remember just
[1:20:27] why am I so tired?
[1:20:29] And you just you try to, you know,
[1:20:31] Brother Brandon says, pinch your
[1:20:33] conscience.
[1:20:35] Pinch your conscience.
[1:20:37] We're we're the devil wants to lull us
[1:20:40] to sleep and and make us feel
[1:20:42] comfortable and and we need
[1:20:47] we need one another. We need to help one
[1:20:49] another.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; We we've got to stay the course. We've
[1:20:53] got to press into more of Christ. We got
[1:20:55] to grow to the statue of a perfect man.
[1:20:58] We got to erase the finish. We got to be
[1:21:00] desperate.
[1:21:02] Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 through9.
[1:21:05] Lord, help me to
[1:21:08] to do all these scriptures, but there's
[1:21:10] many many more. Leaving therefore,
[1:21:13] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[1:21:15] of Christ. That's the beginning part of
[1:21:17] Christ. Your beginning walk, the things
[1:21:20] that you were asked to do. And um let us
[1:21:22] go on to perfection, not laying again
[1:21:25] the foundation of repentance and faith
[1:21:28] toward God and of doctrine, of baptism,
[1:21:31] laying on of the hands of resurrection
[1:21:32] of the dead and eternal judgment. And
[1:21:34] this we will do if God permits. But it's
[1:21:38] not what Paul is trying to get the bride
[1:21:41] to the the the the mature man to. God
[1:21:45] has an expectation of us moving forward
[1:21:49] beyond where we're at to the image of
[1:21:51] God
[1:21:53] and not just drifting, not just
[1:21:55] coasting.
[1:21:56] For it is impossible for those who are
[1:21:59] once enlightened, and have tasted of the
[1:22:02] heavenly gift, and were made partakers
[1:22:04] of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted of
[1:22:06] the good word of God, and of the powers
[1:22:08] of the world to come, if they shall fall
[1:22:11] away, to renew themselves again unto
[1:22:14] repentance, seeing they have crucified
[1:22:16] to themselves the Son of God aresh, and
[1:22:18] put him to an open shame.
[1:22:22] For the earth which drinkkeeth in the
[1:22:24] rain, that cometh often uponth, and
[1:22:27] bringeth forth herbs, meat of them by
[1:22:30] whom it is dressed, receiveth the
[1:22:32] blessings from God. But that which is
[1:22:35] which beareth thorns and briars, is
[1:22:37] rejected,
[1:22:39] and is nigh unto cursing, whose end is
[1:22:42] to be burned. So even though the the the
[1:22:46] briars and the thorns, they received the
[1:22:49] the rain that came down and they were
[1:22:51] able to take that and grow and and to
[1:22:54] rejoice and to be excited and and with
[1:22:57] the blessings of God. Yet because they
[1:23:00] have rejected
[1:23:02] they have rejected the word of God, they
[1:23:04] will be rejected.
[1:23:07] You can't measure where you're standing
[1:23:09] with God by how much he blesses you.
[1:23:14] You just can't do that.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; But beloved, I love this here. But
[1:23:21] beloved,
[1:23:23] going back to what he was saying in
[1:23:24] verse one, but beloved, we are persuaded
[1:23:26] better things of you and the things that
[1:23:29] accompany salvation,
[1:23:32] though we thus speak. Now, what are
[1:23:33] those things? That you continue on.
[1:23:37] Continue on to come to that statue of a
[1:23:39] perfect man. Read about it in Peter
[1:23:42] there. All right. Luke chapter 19.
[1:23:46] Just a couple examples here that we want
[1:23:49] to try to get through.
[1:23:53] Luke chapter 19, the story of of of
[1:23:56] uh Zachcharias
[1:23:58] and and Jesus had a pass by in verse
[1:24:00] one. And in verse two, behold, there was
[1:24:02] a man named Zachcharias.
[1:24:05] Zakius, I'm sorry. Zakius, which was And
[1:24:09] how why do you let me get away with
[1:24:10] that? You should need to be correcting
[1:24:11] me. I'm expecting you, brother Marty.
[1:24:14] You're slipping back there. You
[1:24:16] And behold, there was a man named
[1:24:19] Zakius, which was the chief. He was the
[1:24:21] chief among all the publicans. And he
[1:24:24] was rich. And he sought to see Jesus,
[1:24:27] who he was, and could not for the press,
[1:24:29] because he was of little statue. And he
[1:24:31] ran before and climbed up into a
[1:24:33] sycamore tree to see him, and he was to
[1:24:35] pass that way. And when Jesus came to
[1:24:37] that place, he looked up and saw him and
[1:24:39] said unto him,
[1:24:42] uh, Zakius, make haste, and come down,
[1:24:46] for today I must abide at thy house. And
[1:24:50] he made haste, and he came down and
[1:24:52] received him joyfully. And when they had
[1:24:54] saw it, they all murmured, saying that
[1:24:56] he that Jesus was going to be a guest
[1:24:59] with a man that is a sinner. And Zakius
[1:25:02] stood and said unto the Lord, "Behold,
[1:25:05] Lord, the half of my goods I give to the
[1:25:08] poor, and if I have taken anything from
[1:25:10] any man by false accusation, I will
[1:25:13] restore him four for four for four for
[1:25:15] four for four for four for four for four
[1:25:15] for four for four for four for four for
[1:25:15] four for four for four for four for four
[1:25:15] for four for four for four for four for
[1:25:15] fourfold." And Jesus said unto him,
[1:25:18] "This day is salvation come to this
[1:25:20] house, for as much as he also is a son
[1:25:24] of Abraham.
[1:25:28] For the son of man has come to seek and
[1:25:31] to save that which was lost. Now to me
[1:25:35] this is a beautiful example of of of of
[1:25:39] a that we read in
[1:25:43] Ezekiel there about turning from your
[1:25:45] wickedness
[1:25:47] and and giving your heart to Jesus
[1:25:50] Christ.
[1:25:52] And I I'm not just going to repent and
[1:25:55] get baptized, but I I'm serious business
[1:25:57] with this. And and if I've if I done
[1:25:59] anything wrong, I want to make it right.
[1:26:02] And I'm going to I'm going to even go
[1:26:04] above and beyond. I'm going to restore
[1:26:05] four times.
[1:26:08] So I could say that Zakius, he cared
[1:26:11] enough.
[1:26:15] He cared enough where there's so many
[1:26:17] examples in the Bible of not caring
[1:26:19] enough.
[1:26:21] Cain cared.
[1:26:24] Cain cared. He literally brought a
[1:26:27] sacrifice unto God.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says it was an excellent
[1:26:32] sacrifice. By the way,
[1:26:34] he cared,
[1:26:36] but he didn't care enough. Because when
[1:26:39] the word came to him and said, "Look, if
[1:26:40] you just do well, you continue on,
[1:26:42] you're going to be accepted."
[1:26:45] So, he cared, but he didn't care enough.
[1:26:50] Judas cared. He was an outstanding
[1:26:53] member of the church of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:56] He became the treasure of the church. He
[1:26:58] took care of the finances. He supported
[1:27:00] the ministry. He was a witness of so
[1:27:03] many miracles. And he was probably part
[1:27:04] of those who who passed out the bread
[1:27:07] and and and gave the fishes.
[1:27:10] He cared, but he didn't care enough. He
[1:27:13] didn't stay with it to the end.
[1:27:19] There were 70 disciples who cared. They
[1:27:21] cared about the ministry of Jesus
[1:27:23] Christ. They they cared enough to add
[1:27:25] and help the 12 disciples
[1:27:28] to pray over the sick, to cast out
[1:27:30] demons, to help spread the good news.
[1:27:33] These 70 disciples, they cared, but they
[1:27:37] didn't care enough
[1:27:39] because they stopped caring.
[1:27:42] And when you stop caring, you cut
[1:27:45] yourself off from God.
[1:27:51] And Jesus looked at his 12 disciples
[1:27:53] when they left and he said, "Will you
[1:27:56] go? Will you also go away?
[1:28:01] Are you are you going to also stop
[1:28:03] caring?"
[1:28:05] And then Simon Peter answered, "Lord, to
[1:28:08] whom shall we go? Thou has the words of
[1:28:11] eternal life." We're not leaving the
[1:28:13] word of God.
[1:28:15] We're not leaving church. We're not
[1:28:17] leaving the word. We're not leaving the
[1:28:19] message. We're not leaving the unveiling
[1:28:22] of the word of Christ. We're not leaving
[1:28:25] getting the revelation. We're not we're
[1:28:28] not condescending to use in our own
[1:28:30] thinking to try to figure out God. But
[1:28:33] we believe in the revelation of Jesus
[1:28:35] Christ. Amen.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; And and and God chose to unveil himself.
[1:28:42] If I want us to think about this,
[1:28:45] if it's okay
[1:28:47] for us
[1:28:49] to not be in church,
[1:28:54] then why are we here?
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Why don't we just stay home
[1:29:01] like those that do stay home? because
[1:29:04] we're going to make it.
[1:29:08] You understand what I'm saying here?
[1:29:15] Every Christian
[1:29:17] ought to have a home church and he ought
[1:29:19] to be there supporting his pastor and
[1:29:21] doing everything he can to supporting
[1:29:23] the body. That's what the prophet said.
[1:29:25] If you're in the message and you believe
[1:29:27] the message, that ought to be what's
[1:29:29] going that should be happening.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:32] I don't care what the excuses are.
[1:29:37] To me, I'd rather stay with what the
[1:29:39] prophet said than try to let the devil.
[1:29:42] Let's stand together. God bless you. I
[1:29:44] want you to know this was less than our
[1:29:45] message today.
[1:30:10] All right, let's let's sing. Hold to
[1:30:12] God's unchanging hand.
[1:30:15] Amen. Never let it go.
[1:30:20] Time
[1:30:22] is filled with swift transition.
[1:30:28] Not of earth unmoved and stand.
[1:30:34] Build your hopes on things eternal.
[1:30:41] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:30:48] Oh to God's unchanging hand.
[1:30:54] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:31:01] Build your hopes on things eternal.
[1:31:07] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:31:14] Oh, trust in him who will not leave you.
[1:31:21] Whatsoever
[1:31:23] years may bring,
[1:31:27] if thy earthly friends forsake,
[1:31:34] still more closely to him cling.
[1:31:40] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:31:47] Oh, to God's unchanging hands.
[1:31:53] Build your hopes on things eternal.
[1:32:00] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:32:06] of it not this world's vain riches
[1:32:12] that so rapidly decay
[1:32:19] seek to gain the heavenly treasure
[1:32:25] they will never pass away
[1:32:30] [Music]
[1:32:33] to God's unchanging hand.
[1:32:36] [Music]
[1:32:38] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:32:44] Build your hopes on things eternal.
[1:32:51] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[1:32:57] Amen.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; We have a hand that will not let go.
[1:33:03] The Bible tells us that no man can pluck
[1:33:08] us out of his hand.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:12] Let's sing. Victory ahead.
[1:33:15] Victory ahead. I believe there is a
[1:33:18] finish line. Amen.
[1:33:24] When the host of Israel led by God
[1:33:30] around the world,
[1:33:36] trusting in the Lord, they help the
[1:33:40] conquerors tread. and
