[0:54] for a midweek service

[1:55] thus saith the lord
[1:58] let not the wise man glory in his wisdom
[2:02] neither let the mighty man glory in his
[2:04] might
[2:06] let not the rich man glory in his riches
[2:11] but let him that glorieth glory in this
[2:14] that he understandeth
[2:17] and knoweth me amen
[2:19] that i am the lord which exercise loving
[2:22] kindness
[2:23] judgment
[2:24] and righteousness in the earth for in

[2:53] in prayer
[2:54] our
[2:55] precious heavenly father
[2:57] we thank you for
[2:59] the breath of life today
[3:02] thank you for health
[3:04] for strength amen for
[3:09] the ability to get in a car and drive
[3:11] and make it here tonight
[3:14] lord you

[3:20] you are
[3:22] beyond a good god you are a great god
[3:25] and greatly to be praised
[3:28] father we thank you for your precious
[3:29] word tonight
[3:31] we ask lord that you would
[3:34] take possession of our hearts
[3:37] and of our minds and our
[3:39] thoughts and
[3:41] help us
[3:42] lord we want to receive from you
[3:45] tonight
[3:48] all that you have for us
[3:51] lord we're all
[3:53] have different needs
[3:55] but
[3:56] you are the common denominator to all of
[3:59] our needs lord
[4:01] we pray tonight in the breaking of the
[4:03] bread of life that that you would reveal
[4:06] to us
[4:07] all that you would have for us lord
[4:10] please
[4:12] cleanse us of any sin any unbelief
[4:16] anything that would stand in the way
[4:18] of you
[4:20] working
[4:21] and exercising in our behalf lord
[4:25] we want to
[4:26] know you in a greater measure we commit
[4:29] ourselves
[4:30] ask your blessings now
[4:32] and
[4:33] this precious word in jesus name we pray
[4:36] amen
[4:37] god bless you may be seated we want to
[4:39] entitle this message knowing god
[4:43] more amen
[4:44] we
[4:45] all
[4:47] know god to some degree
[4:49] amen
[4:50] but i like how
[4:52] psalms 46
[4:54] verse 10 put it be still
[4:57] and know that i am god amen
[5:02] i believe
[5:03] uh
[5:04] moses could say that he knew god then he
[5:06] met the burning bush and then he really
[5:08] knew god
[5:10] and he could say he knew god and then he
[5:12] went down there and threw his sticks
[5:13] down
[5:15] and then
[5:16] he saw god more and he knew god more
[5:20] and
[5:21] god was with him through the the ten
[5:22] plagues and then he got to the red sea
[5:26] and he god said why cry to me speak
[5:30] he knew god more and i'll say today he's
[5:32] sitting here in church
[5:34] we can know god more amen
[5:37] it's not so much getting more knowledge
[5:40] hearing something new hearing something
[5:42] different
[5:43] it's about a heart condition of i want
[5:45] to know you
[5:47] i i want you
[5:48] and in order to do that we need to be
[5:50] still in our spirit and still in our
[5:52] mind
[5:53] and and focus on the reality that god is
[5:57] speaking to us through his word amen
[6:00] that's right
[6:04] man was born with a nature to want glory
[6:08] to be admired to be exalted
[6:11] and we see it
[6:13] even in children right it's very cute
[6:16] when we see it in a child he does
[6:18] something and he wants to be recognized
[6:22] and we just smile we say oh isn't that
[6:24] cute
[6:27] but when we see it in adults it's not
[6:29] cute at all
[6:32] in fact we turn up a nose towards it
[6:36] but it's the very same nature
[6:39] it wants glory
[6:42] some kids will try to do their best to
[6:44] win
[6:46] to feel the greatness
[6:48] and i remember being in a gong show
[6:52] i really wanted to win i wanted to feel
[6:56] that crowd clapping their hands for me
[7:02] crazy because to this moment i never
[7:04] want to stand behind a pulpit
[7:07] so i don't know what was going on there
[7:10] but i wanted to feel
[7:12] like i performed
[7:16] some kids don't even try at all yet they
[7:18] want to be exalted
[7:20] because they think something of
[7:21] themselves
[7:23] some kids get jealous
[7:25] and will actually try to hurt somebody
[7:27] else
[7:28] just so they can get exalted
[7:32] it might be we could say cain would be a
[7:34] good example of that right
[7:37] it's the carnal nature of pride that
[7:39] seeks glory
[7:42] and glory if you look it up means seeks
[7:45] honor fame
[7:46] admiration and to be exalted with
[7:49] triumph
[7:52] even if someone is lazy and doesn't
[7:55] hardly do anything they still have that
[7:57] nature of self-will wanting to be
[7:59] recognized look at me i want some
[8:01] attention
[8:04] one would think that if a person has
[8:06] become born again that they wouldn't
[8:08] make themselves of a reputation
[8:12] we should hear a lot of amens on that
[8:14] one what's so so what's really what
[8:16] what's going on
[8:18] since we become a believer in god it
[8:21] doesn't mean that we stop seeking glory
[8:24] for ourselves
[8:28] when we want admiration and honor and to
[8:30] be exalted even in our conversations
[8:34] simply means
[8:36] we need to know god more amen
[8:40] we simply need to know god more
[8:44] the more someone is seeking glory
[8:46] to glorify themselves or to glory in
[8:49] themselves
[8:50] the more deceived they are and in
[8:54] reality the further away from god no
[8:58] matter how much they know
[9:03] we don't know god as much as we need to
[9:06] when we're seeking glory that's how bad
[9:08] it is to be seeking it
[9:13] we need to know god more amen amen
[9:16] because god the bible says is not going
[9:19] to share his glory
[9:21] with any flesh
[9:22] he certainly wasn't going to share it
[9:24] with lucifer
[9:26] he's not going to share with the devil's
[9:28] nature or our carnal flesh
[9:30] jesus said learn to me for i am meek and
[9:33] i'm lowly amen
[9:35] he made himself of no reputation he took
[9:37] upon himself the form of a servant he
[9:40] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[9:42] death even the death of the cross
[9:46] even though i'm
[9:48] the high and the lofty one that inhabits
[9:50] eternity i dwell with him also that is
[9:53] of a contrite and humble spirit
[9:56] so amen
[9:58] god is so far from any of us wanting to
[10:01] be recognized
[10:03] that's right that is so far from that we
[10:05] got to understand we want that god don't
[10:07] want that
[10:09] god hates a proud look on a man's face
[10:14] he hates a proud thought in a man's mind
[10:19] and he hates a proud desire in a man's
[10:22] heart
[10:24] god resists the proud
[10:27] it's the humble who he looks to
[10:29] amen
[10:31] god does not want us to glory in
[10:33] anything but him
[10:37] we should hear a lot of amens on that
[10:38] one
[10:39] he doesn't want us to glory in anything
[10:42] but him but
[10:43] why we want to get praise i don't know
[10:48] psalms 28 verse 8
[10:50] who is the king of glory
[10:55] the lord strong and mighty the lord
[10:57] mighty in battle
[10:59] lift up your heads or your gates even
[11:01] lift them up ye everlasting doors the
[11:04] king of glory shall come in who is the
[11:07] king of glory the lord of hosts he is
[11:10] the king of
[11:12] glory amen
[11:14] when stephen was preaching his heart out
[11:17] he referred to our father abraham
[11:19] as the god of glory in acts chapter 7
[11:22] verse 2
[11:23] and he said men and brethren and fathers
[11:26] hearken the god of glory
[11:31] appeared unto our father abraham when he
[11:34] was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in
[11:37] sharan
[11:40] when paul was speaking about the wisdom
[11:43] of god in a mystery he referred to jesus
[11:45] as the lord of glory in first
[11:48] corinthians chapter 2 verse 8 which none
[11:51] of the princes of this world knew for if
[11:53] they had known
[11:55] they would
[11:56] not have crucified
[11:59] the lord of glory amen
[12:02] so we you see in these three scriptures
[12:04] we have the king of glory the god of
[12:06] glory the lord of glory
[12:08] amen how can man be so deceived to think
[12:12] it's okay to try to take glory away from
[12:15] god amen that's right
[12:17] just to steal a little bit of look at me
[12:21] god doesn't want that
[12:26] he doesn't want us to glory in anything
[12:28] but him we need to give him glory not
[12:30] just at church when we're praising god
[12:34] but when we're outside the church
[12:35] talking to somebody when we're outside
[12:37] the church thinking about somebody when
[12:39] we're outside the church imagining
[12:41] something in our heart
[12:46] he is the king of glory
[12:49] who am i to get glory
[12:52] lucifer
[12:54] stole glory away from god
[12:57] he got to a place with his walk that he
[12:59] wanted to be exalted just like god
[13:03] in fact he wanted to be above god
[13:08] he enjoyed the praise of all the angels
[13:16] and god made them
[13:18] any time we do our will
[13:21] above god's will
[13:24] did you know we're glorifying ourself
[13:26] we're saying our will is greater and
[13:29] more important than god's
[13:33] oh if we could recognize that spirit
[13:36] before it gets on us
[13:39] and stop it in its tracks
[13:42] then
[13:44] you know god
[13:45] like you should know him amen amen
[13:48] the devil wants you to not be
[13:52] to to view
[13:55] this as a a very
[13:58] not that big of a thing
[14:00] it's like not really important but it
[14:02] has everything to do
[14:04] with your relationship with god
[14:08] thus saith the lord let not the wise man
[14:11] glory in his wisdom neither the mighty
[14:14] man glory in his might
[14:17] let not the rich man glory in his riches
[14:21] we could say let not the gifted man
[14:23] glory in his gifts
[14:26] god does not want us to glory in
[14:28] anything but him
[14:31] now we can we we all can agree with this
[14:34] but can we live this word
[14:37] amen
[14:38] can we live this word or are we going to
[14:40] just wait for the a moment that that we
[14:42] got a chance to to express hope
[14:50] he doesn't want us to look to anything
[14:51] but him
[14:54] not
[14:56] our wisdom our might our riches our
[14:58] talents our abilities our knowledge our
[15:00] understanding
[15:01] he doesn't want us to look at how smart
[15:04] we are
[15:06] i don't have to look very far
[15:09] he doesn't want us to look to our great
[15:11] knowledge no certain what does knowledge
[15:13] do just puffs you up makes you feel like
[15:16] you you know something got something
[15:18] because you got this knowledge
[15:20] about something
[15:26] turn with me if you would to philippians
[15:28] chapter 3 verse chapter 3 verse 4.
[15:34] paul gloried in his flesh
[15:37] like nobody else i know
[15:40] i mean he was
[15:42] this man was about as arrogant as i've
[15:45] ever met
[15:47] philippians chapter 3 verse number
[15:52] 4. though i might also have confidence
[15:56] in the flesh
[15:57] if any
[15:58] other man think
[16:00] that he have
[16:01] where he might trust in the flesh i more
[16:06] so here he is comparing himself with
[16:08] others which is number one unwise
[16:12] circumcised the eighth day of the stock
[16:14] of israel the tribe of benjamin
[16:16] uh a hebrew of all the hebrews think
[16:19] about it as touching the law he was a
[16:22] pharisee
[16:24] constrained zeal he persecuted the
[16:26] church
[16:28] touching the righteousness which is of
[16:30] the law
[16:31] he viewed himself
[16:33] as blameless
[16:37] now
[16:38] this is the way that paul was
[16:42] before he was converted
[16:44] amen
[16:46] so this is understandable to see this
[16:49] attitude
[16:50] or behavior in somebody who's not
[16:53] converted
[16:55] right
[16:56] but is greatly out of character to see
[16:59] it if somebody has been
[17:02] converted
[17:04] he says but what things were gained to
[17:06] me
[17:07] those
[17:09] i kind of lost for christ
[17:11] yay countless and i count every single
[17:15] thing but lost
[17:17] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[17:19] christ jesus my lord
[17:22] for whom i have suffered the loss of
[17:24] everything and to count it but done that
[17:27] i might win christ he was willing to
[17:30] suffer and give up everything
[17:32] notice he could have got up from the on
[17:34] the road to damascus and he simply could
[17:37] have said well that was a weird
[17:39] experience and went on his way
[17:42] he had a choice
[17:45] but he humbled himself
[17:48] he submitted himself
[17:52] and he just didn't do it for a week
[17:54] no he went to arabia for three and a
[17:56] half years
[17:57] he got serious with god that's what's
[18:00] really missing in this age
[18:02] there's too much of a spirit of
[18:04] lukewarmness laodicea and people don't
[18:07] want to get more serious with god they
[18:09] feel they're serious enough that's the
[18:11] need of nothing
[18:16] i feel there's more of god to know
[18:22] look at this verse 9
[18:24] and be found in him
[18:27] not having my own glory my own
[18:30] righteousness which is the law but that
[18:32] which is through the faith of christ the
[18:35] righteousness which is of god by
[18:38] faith amen
[18:40] all the glory goes to god if you've got
[18:43] faith glory to god your righteous glory
[18:45] to god
[18:46] everything is god glory to god amen
[18:49] amen
[18:51] not partial glory and partial to me amen
[18:54] all
[18:57] how many wish
[18:59] that you had
[19:02] a greater leadership
[19:05] of god for your personal lives amen
[19:07] that's something that we're all seeking
[19:09] for
[19:11] paul got to a place that he said i don't
[19:13] know nothing except jesus christ and
[19:15] then crucified i just give him all the
[19:17] glory for everything amen amen if you
[19:20] want god to lead you in the affairs of
[19:21] your life stop glorifying your own
[19:24] understanding
[19:25] amen
[19:27] stop trying to figure it out
[19:30] stop glorifying your own wisdom your own
[19:33] abilities stop using yourself if you
[19:36] want god to help you
[19:41] god wants all the glory for our lives
[19:44] he doesn't want us to be self-reliant
[19:49] amen
[19:53] when you lean on yourself for answers
[19:55] you're glorifying yourself oh i figure
[19:57] this out this is what i got to do
[20:01] what about trust
[20:04] you know when you trust god it gives him
[20:06] glory amen amen
[20:08] when you have faith in god it gives him
[20:10] glory amen
[20:13] but when you
[20:15] sit there and you try to get all the
[20:16] answers and figure it out yourself
[20:19] you're giving yourself glory
[20:22] you're glorifying yourself
[20:28] when we yield to that we're actually
[20:29] glorifying our own ability to figure
[20:33] something out like there's no need to
[20:35] trust god i've got this figured out
[20:38] what an attitude
[20:40] even if you can't figure it out because
[20:44] he gave his mind to figure things out
[20:49] but he never gave us a mind
[20:53] to lead us
[20:56] we're sheep led by the holy ghost
[20:59] amen it's when we get involved
[21:02] that's when we get in trouble
[21:05] so we need to stop glorifying our own
[21:07] understanding
[21:09] it just gets in the way verse 6
[21:12] in all thy ways did i read verse 5
[21:14] proverbs 3 5
[21:17] no i didn't let's turn there
[21:19] this is these are
[21:21] uh everybody's
[21:24] in the top six verses in the bible it's
[21:26] got to be these verses here right
[21:28] these are just some wonderful scriptures
[21:30] proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 trust in the
[21:32] lord with all thine heart
[21:35] and lean not to the unknown
[21:36] understanding
[21:39] so now
[21:41] notice the scripture doesn't say stand
[21:44] on your own instead
[21:46] it's just lean
[21:48] he doesn't want us leaning towards it
[21:53] he wants us to stand up i have no idea
[21:56] but i trust
[21:58] i can't figure it out but i trust
[22:01] that's where he wants us that's why he
[22:03] gets more glory
[22:05] but if we're leaning towards that oh i
[22:06] got this figured out i got to tell you
[22:08] this and this is what's good you know
[22:09] what
[22:10] i don't see any glory and god in that
[22:12] but you know what's happening you're
[22:13] glorifying yourself
[22:17] in all thy ways
[22:19] acknowledge him
[22:21] and he shall direct thy paths now i just
[22:25] want to say this is just not a favorite
[22:27] scripture so we know what god wants us
[22:29] to do
[22:30] that's not what this scripture is put in
[22:32] the bible for
[22:35] this scripture teaches us who god really
[22:38] is he's a god that wants us to depend on
[22:41] him
[22:44] that's what kind of god he is that's
[22:46] what that scripture's there for
[22:50] not so well i get figured out so now i'm
[22:52] gonna lean on him
[22:55] it's not the old you know safety net
[22:59] god is teaching us what kind of god he
[23:01] is he wants us to know him as a god that
[23:04] supplies all of our needs he just wants
[23:06] to see our attitude of leaning on him
[23:10] he wants to see that more
[23:12] because it gives him glory when we say
[23:15] god i need you show me
[23:19] but when i say i got this
[23:24] i got this on the tail brother mark i
[23:25] got it
[23:28] what am i doing there
[23:31] i'm steering him away from god
[23:35] i'm getting them to look to me
[23:38] we're stealing glory from god and we
[23:40] don't even know it
[23:42] we don't even know what's happening
[23:43] because we don't realize the spirit
[23:44] that's on us
[23:50] i want to know god more
[23:53] let him glory glory in this that he
[23:56] knows god
[23:58] he understands god he knows god that's
[24:01] where we should be glory in
[24:03] in other words
[24:04] god's taking care of this whole thing
[24:07] right
[24:08] the whole thing
[24:10] we don't have to figure out the world
[24:11] affairs we don't need to figure out one
[24:13] another's affairs
[24:16] you know what i can't even figure out my
[24:18] own affair
[24:20] i need god
[24:21] i need god
[24:23] and i know him that he promised to take
[24:26] care of me to meet my needs if i seek
[24:29] him first in the kingdom everything else
[24:32] is going to be that's all i know jesus
[24:34] christ and him crucified i don't need to
[24:36] explain anything else
[24:38] and i certainly don't want to get caught
[24:40] in trying to let people know what i know
[24:43] right it's true
[24:45] because i'm taking a right away from god
[24:49] when we want people to see god in us so
[24:51] bad that we're willing to steal glory
[24:53] from god it shows something's wrong with
[24:55] our spirit
[24:57] we don't need to prove anything we don't
[24:59] we need to make ourself of no reputation
[25:02] not a little bit of reputation
[25:08] i like god teaching us his nature his
[25:12] character verse 7 be not wise
[25:16] in your own eyes
[25:22] how many has ever felt like you were
[25:24] wise before
[25:34] especially when somebody says that was a
[25:36] really good one
[25:40] you know the bible says it's evil
[25:44] it's actually evil to be wise in your
[25:47] own eyes yes
[25:49] it's a wrong spirit
[25:55] and if we follow instructions it shall
[25:58] be health to thy navel and
[26:00] marrow to thy bones
[26:02] unto the lord with the with thy
[26:04] substance and notice with the first
[26:06] fruits of thine increase now i just want
[26:09] you to understand
[26:11] god is sending a sip of the same message
[26:14] but he's he's pulling out another
[26:16] another way god don't want to be second
[26:23] he don't want you to take your glory and
[26:25] then give him second glory
[26:29] give him all the honor give him all the
[26:31] praise
[26:34] honor the lord with thy substance and
[26:37] with the first
[26:38] fruits
[26:40] of all thy
[26:42] increase amen
[26:44] now when dinner comes to the table and
[26:47] you got this big
[26:50] bowl
[26:51] of
[26:53] nice dinner whatever you want
[26:57] that first spoon that goes in there
[27:00] that's the first fruit
[27:04] when brother mark comes over
[27:07] we don't eat
[27:09] and say mark you don't touch until we're
[27:10] done
[27:15] ties is first
[27:19] it's first
[27:20] it may not be first in your thoughts
[27:24] it may not be first in your ideas
[27:27] it may not be first in your
[27:28] understanding
[27:29] but it's first with god
[27:32] because look you're not doing it unto a
[27:34] church and you're not doing it on to a
[27:35] man
[27:37] it's god's to start with
[27:40] you're doing it unto god it's your faith
[27:42] in god
[27:43] amen not man
[27:47] god wants the first part of everything
[27:49] that you have that's been given to you
[27:52] on a daily basis
[27:54] given the first fruits
[27:56] praise them in the morning for the
[27:57] breath you got yes straight to make it
[27:59] to the bathroom to get a glass of water
[28:02] as you get older it means more to you
[28:07] give them the first fruits
[28:11] well brother john i've labored for it's
[28:13] mine
[28:14] i'm the one that no
[28:17] if he got you an increase through your
[28:19] labors it belongs to him
[28:21] he's the one that gave you strength that
[28:23] day to get up and go labor
[28:25] you're going to have that attitude he's
[28:27] just an ill
[28:28] right okay now try to go meet your needs
[28:32] honor the lord with thy substance
[28:35] give him glory with the first fruits of
[28:38] all thine increase it gives him glory
[28:42] when you don't honor the lord
[28:44] you really don't
[28:46] know the lord well enough
[28:50] i mean i know when i first came
[28:53] to the truth
[28:54] i've been in churches before and i gave
[28:56] offerings
[28:59] but i really didn't know about ties
[29:02] i didn't know you had to give 10 percent
[29:05] and when i first learned about it i
[29:06] thought
[29:10] i really don't know the lord
[29:15] but i thought i did
[29:17] there's so much the more the more i go
[29:20] on the more i realize i don't know
[29:22] god like i need to know him
[29:25] are you with me
[29:27] when you don't pay your church expenses
[29:30] your missionary offerings you know what
[29:31] you're doing you're glorifying yourself
[29:35] this money belongs to me
[29:37] i want it
[29:39] you're not taking your responsibility
[29:43] but when you do honor him the bible says
[29:45] in verse 10 so shall thy barns be filled
[29:49] with plenty
[29:51] and thy presses shall burst out
[29:54] with new wine amen how many wants to
[29:57] be bursting up with the holy ghost
[30:00] my son
[30:01] despise not the chasing of the lord
[30:04] neither
[30:05] be weary of his correction for whom the
[30:08] lord loveth he correct even as a father
[30:11] the son in whom he delighteth
[30:16] when the god is trying to tell us his
[30:18] word
[30:18] amen don't despise it
[30:22] don't turn your nose up to it
[30:26] if god wants all the glory give it to
[30:28] him
[30:30] he's trying to correct us from trying to
[30:33] steal attention
[30:38] let the lord correct
[30:39] this in our lives
[30:42] he loves us
[30:44] he wants us
[30:46] but he doesn't want us to rely on our
[30:50] our self
[30:52] for anything to look to ourselves for
[30:55] anything i know it's hard because look
[30:58] before paul was converted he didn't have
[31:00] anything but himself
[31:02] teach me gamalia teach me
[31:07] that can only go so far
[31:10] but you you you learn to handle life on
[31:13] your own
[31:16] that's why it's so hard to witness the
[31:17] people about jesus christ
[31:19] because they got light they don't need
[31:20] god they get they got life figured out
[31:24] so even though we're serving god now god
[31:27] gave us these minds
[31:29] we still have that tendency
[31:31] to figure things out to lead your own
[31:34] understanding
[31:35] and yet we want god to guide us
[31:38] to direct our path
[31:40] and we struggle knowing it because down
[31:43] deep inside we're trying to figure it
[31:45] out we haven't humbled ourselves to
[31:47] stick with our testimony that i don't
[31:50] know i will not know until god chose me
[31:54] that's a testimony we need to stay with
[31:58] not mix it
[32:02] amen
[32:04] be not wise in thine own eyes
[32:08] in other words stop looking to yourself
[32:09] to figure things out
[32:11] it's evil
[32:18] you're glorifying yourself and you're
[32:20] stealing glory away from god you're
[32:21] stealing it and he don't want to share
[32:23] his glory with you
[32:25] so think about what you're doing you're
[32:27] putting yourself
[32:28] up
[32:29] with god
[32:32] i mean you want to put yourself up with
[32:33] god he made himself of no reputation
[32:36] you want to put yourself up with god he
[32:38] steved others better than yourself
[32:41] put him up with his character
[32:44] not your knowledge
[32:46] let not the the mighty man glory in his
[32:49] might or the the knowledgeable man in
[32:51] his knowledge
[32:53] or the man with wisdom in his wisdom but
[32:55] let him glory in the lord
[33:01] when they built the tower of babel
[33:04] they were wise in their own eyes
[33:08] and god looked at that as evil
[33:10] and what did god do
[33:12] the bible says he confounded
[33:15] their language yes
[33:18] he confounded the language
[33:20] so he hides things from the wise and
[33:22] prudent he confounds the wise
[33:26] when israel was faced with an unbeatable
[33:29] giant called goliath instead of looking
[33:31] to the lord they kept looking for the
[33:33] ability ability in their own camp
[33:36] who will go face him who will go face
[33:38] him
[33:41] instead of looking to god
[33:44] so what did god do he confounded their
[33:46] understanding with a small
[33:49] ruddy boy
[33:55] who didn't put any trust
[33:58] in what they thought their armor
[34:02] the way they viewed come up from this
[34:04] way watch this
[34:08] no understanding amen
[34:13] we're going to walk around the walls of
[34:14] jericho seven times this is no
[34:16] understanding this is the compute with
[34:18] me
[34:21] but it computes with god
[34:24] we're always trying to figure if i got
[34:26] it figured out then i then i got it no
[34:29] if you got it figured out you probably
[34:30] don't got it
[34:34] because god don't want you to get it he
[34:36] wants you to trust him
[34:38] to lean on him
[34:40] to hold him and say god i glorify you
[34:43] because i know you're going to take me
[34:44] through he hasn't changed just because
[34:46] it's the 22nd century he's going to
[34:48] handle things differently he's still
[34:50] looking for a people that's going to
[34:51] believe in him that's going to trust him
[34:53] for their situations
[35:00] god had to beat moses
[35:03] own wisdom out of him for 40 years
[35:05] before god could use him
[35:08] in his calling he was still called
[35:11] but he wasn't ready
[35:13] in fact he was called from a baby
[35:16] we knew about it
[35:18] but how many years did it go before god
[35:19] could use him
[35:21] right it's true
[35:22] so i'm telling you the more you think
[35:24] you are something the quicker you get
[35:26] away from it the quicker god's going to
[35:28] use you
[35:31] moses was wise in his own eyes
[35:36] but god viewed that as evil
[35:39] what did god do he confounded moses
[35:43] his own understanding in a burning bush
[35:45] what is this thing burning
[35:48] he went and met god in a bush
[35:52] i wonder where we're going to meet god
[36:00] sometimes we try to figure things out
[36:02] what's being preached here at church
[36:06] instead of by faith receiving it god's
[36:08] speaking to me amen i i believe god will
[36:10] bless every one of us more if we spent
[36:13] more time believing the word that's
[36:14] being preached rather than i don't know
[36:16] how this is fitting with me
[36:19] you got to get in that that realm
[36:22] you can't be in you know when you're
[36:24] trying to get a radio station you're
[36:26] between two of them
[36:28] that's what happens sometimes when we
[36:30] get the church we're in the flesh in the
[36:31] spirit in the flesh in the spirit
[36:34] and we're not really hearing clearly
[36:36] that's for me
[36:38] god wants me
[36:39] to practice not leaving my own
[36:41] understanding
[36:43] that was for me and you got to claim it
[36:44] like that
[36:46] if you're the only one sitting in church
[36:48] you've got to be the one claiming that
[36:50] if there's one in a city you got to
[36:51] believe you're going to be that one
[36:53] right
[36:54] don't wait for you
[36:55] don't never wait for me to make you feel
[36:57] good
[36:59] or to make you feel like believing i
[37:01] should say it like that
[37:02] because i just don't i don't believe
[37:04] jesus had that type of ministry either
[37:08] i mean god makes that type of ministry
[37:10] he makes a five-fold ministry he's got
[37:12] all kinds of trees and ministers
[37:15] but the word remains the same in all of
[37:17] them amen
[37:19] the word remains the same and we just
[37:21] got to believe
[37:22] the word
[37:27] i'm sure
[37:28] moses thought he was going to get his
[37:30] brothers together and they were just
[37:32] going to take over egypt
[37:34] we're going to rise up together as a
[37:36] team
[37:37] it's an army
[37:39] god just confounded that thought process
[37:42] said no i'm just sending you
[37:45] a one-man army
[37:48] sometimes we're waiting for somebody
[37:49] else to
[37:50] do something in the church
[37:52] to invite somebody
[37:55] when god's already speaking to you
[37:59] but you want a a big army right
[38:02] instead of you and god you and god are a
[38:03] majority
[38:05] remember that you and god are always a
[38:07] majority
[38:10] every time pharaoh exercised his wisdom
[38:14] god confounded him with just another
[38:17] plague
[38:21] what happened when the children of
[38:22] israel were at the
[38:24] red sea
[38:27] nowhere to go
[38:30] they're understanding everywhere they
[38:32] look they were caught
[38:35] god wanted him one of them
[38:37] to trust god
[38:39] to lean on god
[38:41] god is not going to leave us hanging
[38:43] that's right
[38:44] our understanding only takes us so far
[38:46] and then after that we're set there okay
[38:48] okay now what do i do
[38:50] that's what our understanding does
[38:53] god just wants us to get away from that
[38:56] because god is a
[38:59] god leads us by his spirit
[39:02] we were not
[39:04] born with this
[39:05] supernatural spirituality
[39:10] we think we were
[39:14] but we weren't
[39:16] right he wants
[39:17] us to stay humble jesus confounded
[39:19] nicodemus when he told him you must be
[39:21] born again to even understand god
[39:25] it takes god to reveal god
[39:30] we can't do it
[39:33] every time they tried to catch jesus
[39:35] disobeying the law he confounded them
[39:41] he confounded his own disciples telling
[39:43] them that the only way he could enter to
[39:45] the kingdom is through suffering and
[39:47] affliction
[39:48] amen
[39:50] and peter's saying no far be it from
[39:52] that
[39:53] leaning on his own understanding i got
[39:55] this figured out there's a better way an
[39:56] easier way we do not have to
[40:00] go that direction
[40:04] wise in their own eyes it was evil
[40:07] jesus looked at him and said get behind
[40:09] me
[40:11] satan
[40:13] because you savor the things
[40:15] that belong to men our understanding
[40:17] leans towards us
[40:22] and it's wanting to give us glory
[40:25] and that's why we need to not
[40:27] who cares if we know
[40:29] let's just glory that we know god amen
[40:32] that he's that he's the one that's taken
[40:35] us through
[40:36] if we begin to exercise this i mean on a
[40:39] daily basis our relationship with god
[40:41] will grow
[40:43] but it's got to be that real
[40:45] we can't say well
[40:47] i know god's with me if he does this
[40:49] this this and that does it like this and
[40:51] the squirrel goes up the tree and goes
[40:52] over here and comes down and sits right
[40:54] there and then he i'm sorry how many
[40:56] times it happened to brother branham
[40:58] but we expect everything to be like that
[41:00] laid out for us
[41:04] god wants us to take one step by faith
[41:08] be faithful to him today
[41:10] amen
[41:11] he'll give you something tomorrow
[41:16] if you exercise your own understanding
[41:18] your own wisdom he will simply confound
[41:22] you
[41:23] he'll he'll leave you in a state
[41:26] of
[41:28] wow it didn't happen the way i thought
[41:29] it did now how many times does that
[41:30] happen to us
[41:32] many many many countless of times all of
[41:35] us
[41:37] he confounds the wisdom of the proud the
[41:40] wise to prudent
[41:42] he'll leave us hanging
[41:44] what do i do
[41:46] he'll get us to a place where we will
[41:48] confess
[41:49] i don't know i need you
[41:54] if we would just start on that track to
[41:56] begin with
[41:59] like abhor our own understanding abhor
[42:02] our own wisdom abhor on our riches our
[42:04] might our reputation just abhor that
[42:08] lord i need you
[42:09] as much today as i did at the beginning
[42:13] amen
[42:14] not last but more
[42:18] stop
[42:19] learning or leaning on your abilities
[42:25] it's just glorifying yourself
[42:27] and it's evil it's just bad
[42:31] i think that's how brother george smith
[42:32] would say that part
[42:35] trust god
[42:38] learn to hear from him this is what this
[42:40] is about this
[42:42] what we're what we're saying right here
[42:44] is not easy peasy
[42:48] but the the part that we're not
[42:51] exercising
[42:52] is we're
[42:54] we're trying to figure it out without
[42:56] them
[43:00] and if god tells you
[43:03] you don't even need to
[43:05] say it
[43:07] you just watch it happen how many times
[43:09] has god said something to you
[43:12] you just kept it quiet you watched it
[43:14] come to pass
[43:19] i believe god wants
[43:21] to be more powerful in our life
[43:23] on a daily
[43:24] basis but if we don't learn to practice
[43:27] this
[43:28] like this word needs to be real these
[43:30] scriptures need to be real
[43:32] not i want
[43:35] god to lead me without me
[43:37] trusting in him
[43:38] i need i want god to leave me without um
[43:42] um having not to rely on my own
[43:44] understanding my own wisdom right
[43:46] it's not gonna happen we've got to be
[43:49] strong enough to say i'm not gonna lean
[43:51] i just i don't know god could do this
[43:52] you do that he could do that he could do
[43:54] everything but i'm not going to leave
[43:55] someone understanding i'm going to wait
[43:56] on him i'm going to trust him and i'm
[43:58] going to see his glory
[44:01] because that's what he wants to do he
[44:02] wants to be glorified in every one of
[44:04] our lives or situations whatever it is
[44:06] that's going on he wants to be first
[44:11] acknowledge him amen
[44:14] don't be wise in your own eyes first
[44:15] corinthians chapter 1 first corinthians
[44:17] chapter 1 verse 25
[44:21] because the foolishness of god
[44:24] is wiser than men and the weakness of
[44:26] god is stronger than men
[44:28] for you see your calling brother
[44:31] brethren how that not many wise men
[44:34] after the flesh
[44:36] not many mighty
[44:38] not many noble
[44:39] are even called
[44:42] but god has chosen
[44:44] the foolish things of the world
[44:46] to confound the wise
[44:49] and god has chosen the weak things of
[44:51] the world to confound the things which
[44:54] are mighty
[44:56] and the base things of the world and the
[44:57] things that are despised
[45:00] have god chosen
[45:03] yay in the things which are not to bring
[45:05] to not the things that are that
[45:08] no flesh should glory in his presence
[45:16] do you see why god doesn't want you
[45:19] involved
[45:22] in
[45:23] trying to get glory of how you figure
[45:26] things out
[45:29] god i need you in my home
[45:31] god i need you in my prayer life god i
[45:33] need you in my job god i need you in my
[45:35] church god i need you in your in in
[45:38] showing me where you want me to go who
[45:39] you want me to reach out to
[45:41] i need you
[45:43] not i'm this and this and i believe in
[45:46] putting the show on the gun i believe in
[45:47] occupy until he comes but i believe in
[45:49] the leadership of god amen
[45:56] god won't allow your flesh to glory in
[45:59] his presence what he'll do when you
[46:01] start you know look at me look at me
[46:02] look at me
[46:04] as soon as that happens he just
[46:09] because no flesh is going to glory in
[46:10] his presence he's going to stay there
[46:12] he is not going to stay there
[46:15] but how many times have we done it and
[46:17] we think god was with us oh yeah i
[46:19] already show them
[46:22] but we're not even recognizing
[46:26] that wasn't god
[46:29] the service is about knowing god more
[46:31] it's not belittling how much of god we
[46:33] do know
[46:35] it's about knowing god more
[46:40] isaiah you're a really great prophet
[46:45] woe unto me
[46:47] i am a man of unclean i don't know what
[46:49] you're saying
[46:51] i live certainly i'm on i'm unrighteous
[46:54] and i'm holy i should not be in the
[46:56] presence of god not yeah you know i've
[46:58] said a lot of prophecies you know they
[46:59] were really good the people that came to
[47:01] pass it
[47:06] what is happening
[47:08] where is our spirit
[47:11] and we think it's okay
[47:16] god doesn't want us glory in that right
[47:19] because people can't see jesus
[47:23] when you were doing that
[47:28] no flesh is gonna glory in his presence
[47:32] none
[47:33] so let's just
[47:36] get it stay in the spirit keep him first
[47:40] keep him first
[47:43] verse 30 but of him
[47:47] are ye in christ jesus who of god has
[47:50] made unto us wisdom god
[47:52] is made
[47:54] unto us
[47:55] wisdom
[47:57] and righteousness and sanctification and
[48:00] redemption
[48:01] that according as it is written he that
[48:04] glorieth let him glory in the lord
[48:09] amen
[48:10] you know when we're having a
[48:11] conversation
[48:14] you should take
[48:15] like a checkup
[48:17] did i just glorify god
[48:21] amen
[48:23] take the check up
[48:26] you shouldn't have to
[48:28] recognize it from how another person is
[48:30] acting
[48:34] in other words you should be so in tune
[48:35] with him
[48:36] lord i know you i know you don't want me
[48:39] to get people to look to me
[48:43] i want to know you
[48:45] i want to suffer the loss of all things
[48:48] oh i don't want a reputation
[48:51] i know i can't have a reputation to have
[48:53] god
[48:55] i know i can't have glory and have god
[48:58] i can't
[49:00] paul couldn't and i can't why even try
[49:04] don't let satan take you off on this
[49:07] personal little thing
[49:09] and think it's god
[49:12] we want to know god more second
[49:14] corinthians chapter 11 verse 30. are you
[49:17] getting a little something out of this
[49:19] all right if i now here's paul
[49:22] he's
[49:26] looking at this subject about comparing
[49:29] ministers and
[49:30] glory and if i must needs you ever
[49:32] compare yourself with somebody in church
[49:34] yes or something another church or
[49:36] somebody else
[49:38] oh
[49:39] terrible
[49:40] if i must needs glory i will glory of
[49:43] the things which concern my infirmities
[49:49] hey if you're going to glory
[49:51] let's do it about how much you suffered
[49:53] for the cause of christ
[49:55] second corinthians chapter 12 verse 5
[49:58] of such
[50:00] a one will i glory
[50:02] if i'm going to glory i'm going to glory
[50:04] of
[50:06] yet
[50:07] of myself i will not glory but in my
[50:10] infirmities he's making it clear what
[50:12] he's going to glory and what he's not
[50:14] going to glory in
[50:16] for though i would desire to glory
[50:19] i shall not be
[50:20] a fool
[50:22] so what happens when you see somebody
[50:25] gloring in themselves
[50:28] acting like a fool
[50:31] after jesus told paul
[50:33] that his grace was sufficient for his
[50:35] life he said most gladly in verse 9
[50:38] therefore i rather glory in my
[50:41] infirmities that the power of christ may
[50:44] rest upon me in other words
[50:46] when
[50:49] when you're glorying
[50:51] in obedience to god's word
[50:55] and you're suffering for it willfully he
[50:57] said this is acceptable with god god
[50:59] said my presence will be there
[51:02] that the presence of god may rest upon
[51:05] me
[51:06] but if you're not there
[51:08] and you're just gloring in yourself
[51:11] of what you know or whatever your might
[51:13] or your riches or your
[51:16] whatever your popularity your your your
[51:19] your gifts
[51:21] god's presence isn't going to rest on
[51:22] you
[51:24] not saying he won't use you
[51:26] but i'm talking about staying with you
[51:28] i'd rather have god with me than god
[51:30] used me
[51:32] god uses the devil
[51:35] i think about that so much i said god i
[51:37] don't want that type of relationship
[51:39] help me
[51:42] amen
[51:45] as remember
[51:47] paul chose the heart away just like
[51:48] brother branham and because he chose the
[51:51] heart away a huge portion of heaven
[51:54] was awaiting him
[51:56] so the harder way
[51:59] is not
[52:02] to have all the other ministers look up
[52:05] to you that's true
[52:06] right because
[52:08] the promise was don't be killing more
[52:11] deer forever all those other brothers
[52:12] right
[52:14] brothers ministers whatever they were
[52:16] and and and brother brother brad says
[52:18] okay i won't and he didn't he kept his
[52:20] promise
[52:22] and god kept his promise
[52:25] and it
[52:26] it like it was a natural thing and he
[52:29] could even justify these people needed
[52:31] meat he was out there and he enjoyed it
[52:34] and enjoyed the gift of of shooting
[52:38] but it was the idea of the relationship
[52:41] this is what i'm saying
[52:44] brother sister god is more with you than
[52:45] you realize
[52:47] your situations that are going on he is
[52:49] just wanting you to look to him
[52:52] to depend on him
[52:54] to put in to faith
[52:57] what it means
[52:58] to not lean on yourself but to trust in
[53:01] god
[53:03] to put it to the test
[53:05] because god has never failed us he's
[53:08] never lied he's never failed amen
[53:11] we just don't want to be wise in our
[53:12] nice we don't want to lean to understand
[53:14] we want to stop trying to figure it out
[53:17] look to the lord
[53:18] all the time
[53:20] trust him all the time
[53:25] thus saith the lord let not the wise man
[53:28] glory in his wisdom
[53:30] neither the mighty man glory in his
[53:33] might let not the rich man glory in his
[53:36] riches
[53:38] but let him that glorieth
[53:41] in
[53:43] this
[53:45] one thing
[53:47] that he understandeth
[53:49] and knoweth me
[53:53] what else
[53:54] is important
[53:56] what else is important
[53:59] peter was ignorant and unlearned
[54:03] but he had the keys
[54:04] he didn't know how to use him
[54:07] he had the keys
[54:11] that's
[54:12] what we need is to know him
[54:14] to know him is to know life
[54:19] to be able to handle situations that
[54:21] you're in
[54:24] to know him is to love like him
[54:26] amen to lay down your life like him
[54:32] god is the one that takes great delight
[54:35] in exercising his own will
[54:38] in the things of your life
[54:41] so you need to dare to trust him
[54:44] we know it's evil to be wise in our own
[54:46] eyes and to lean to our own
[54:47] understanding it's also evil to figure
[54:50] things out
[54:55] and to
[54:57] have
[54:59] your plans for your future
[55:02] now we all need to plant potatoes i want
[55:04] to
[55:05] separate the two
[55:09] but
[55:09] we don't do it with for sure
[55:13] because we just don't know it's evil
[55:16] james chapter 4 verse 10.
[55:19] we're just trying to learn more about
[55:21] god
[55:22] james chapter 4 verse 10 humble
[55:23] yourselves in the sight of the lord and
[55:25] he shall lift you up
[55:27] that's the first step
[55:29] speak not evil one of another brethren
[55:31] he that speaketh evil of his brother and
[55:34] judgeth his brother speaking the evil of
[55:36] the law judgeth the law but if thou
[55:38] judge the law thou art not a doer of the
[55:41] law but a judge
[55:45] and then he says there is one lawgiver
[55:48] who's able to save and destroy
[55:50] who in the world are you
[55:53] that puts yourself in the spot to judge
[55:55] somebody
[55:58] anytime we do that
[56:01] we're giving ourselves glory and taking
[56:03] glory away from god
[56:05] it just it happens simultaneously
[56:09] god has just instructed us to be
[56:12] merciful
[56:16] i mean he's merciful
[56:21] every day his mercies are new for all of
[56:22] us we all benefit from his mercy
[56:24] and we don't want to give a little mercy
[56:26] to somebody that has done us wrong
[56:33] it's not him we don't know him
[56:35] we got to know him more
[56:38] oh i want to know him
[56:41] sometimes we feel this urge to speak in
[56:44] something negative
[56:47] mainly because we're self-proclaimed
[56:49] judges i got this thing i know i can see
[56:51] this was wrong
[56:53] this is what should happen
[56:56] number one
[56:57] if you're going to speak something that
[56:59] can be viewed negatively
[57:03] speak it to the person who's done the
[57:06] wrong that's number one
[57:07] that's scripture
[57:09] you don't talk behind somebody's back
[57:13] if you do you really don't know him
[57:17] number two
[57:19] speak when you do speak it
[57:22] speak it in love
[57:25] when you do speak it speak in love you
[57:27] speak the truth in love
[57:30] it's the only correct way to do it
[57:34] speaking the truth in love is completely
[57:36] different than just speaking the truth
[57:40] it's completely different we think it's
[57:42] the same because it's true no
[57:44] the motives are different
[57:49] one you're trying to prove somebody's
[57:51] wrong or prove you're right either one
[57:54] and the other
[57:56] when you speak in love your whole goal
[57:58] is to restore and help somebody
[58:02] you don't care about any you don't even
[58:04] care if you have to suffer to get it
[58:05] done
[58:07] if you have to look like you're nothing
[58:10] amen
[58:11] because that's what christ did when he
[58:12] went to calvary for you
[58:18] he gave up his glory to help us
[58:21] he came down from glory
[58:25] to help sinful people like us
[58:30] so just
[58:31] knowing god just put the stuff in
[58:32] practice don't sit there and let your
[58:34] thoughts you know go like this and we
[58:37] think it's okay
[58:38] it's not that's not god that's not god
[58:42] and you want to know god more
[58:44] then start practicing what you what you
[58:46] hear from the pulpit start putting the
[58:48] practice so you don't want to we can get
[58:50] in such a uh
[58:52] a rut we just come to church and we
[58:54] don't even hear from god
[58:58] i was sitting over on the other side
[58:59] talking to mr kapali and he's really
[59:01] been a great landlord to us we i was
[59:04] telling them
[59:05] uh when our last day would be and boy
[59:07] he's just
[59:10] tearing up and we're family i love you
[59:14] love your family love the church you're
[59:16] welcome here anytime please come back
[59:19] and and just stay in connection has
[59:21] nothing to do with renting
[59:24] just wants to stay connected
[59:26] that would be different if we had a
[59:30] you know a six-month rent
[59:33] but being here for what 20 years
[59:36] i mean
[59:37] that's what you want to leave with you
[59:39] want to you want to live with somebody
[59:41] like that so much that they don't want
[59:43] you to leave
[59:46] that's how you and i'm sure you know
[59:49] he's had to correct me
[59:50] the doors have been left open
[59:54] we've had to ask him to take care of
[59:56] water problems
[59:57] you gotta work through problems
[59:59] but you do it in love
[1:00:00] your patience and long-suffering and you
[1:00:03] want to restore it and make the
[1:00:04] relationship grow
[1:00:10] we just don't want to be a judge trying
[1:00:12] to figure things out and calling what we
[1:00:15] think is happening that is so anti-god
[1:00:21] when we practice this word we're
[1:00:23] practicing i want to know you more lord
[1:00:26] not no
[1:00:27] but no
[1:00:29] amen are you with me let's get back to
[1:00:30] james verse 13. go to now ye that say
[1:00:34] today and tomorrow we're going to go to
[1:00:36] such a city and continue there a year
[1:00:37] and buy and sell and get gained this is
[1:00:39] what we're going to do this is our plan
[1:00:42] whereas
[1:00:43] you don't know
[1:00:45] what shall be tomorrow
[1:00:48] for what is your life
[1:00:50] right it's a vapor that appears for a
[1:00:52] little time and then vanish away
[1:00:56] for that he ought to say
[1:00:58] if the lord will
[1:01:00] we shall live we shall do this or we
[1:01:02] should do that
[1:01:03] god i don't know
[1:01:06] i do not know
[1:01:09] practice saying the lord willing
[1:01:11] from a heart that really
[1:01:13] wants the will of the lord not from the
[1:01:15] heart that thinks they already know the
[1:01:16] will lord amen there's a big difference
[1:01:26] the
[1:01:27] but now he says you're rejoicing in your
[1:01:30] boastings
[1:01:31] for all such rejoicing
[1:01:33] is evil
[1:01:35] you're glorifying yourself when you say
[1:01:38] you're going to do something
[1:01:40] without saying
[1:01:43] if it be the will of the lord
[1:01:45] right
[1:01:47] because that's not there you're getting
[1:01:48] the attention to you and you think you
[1:01:50] know it's just not only become a judge
[1:01:53] of the law judge of your brother your
[1:01:54] judge of your own life this is what's
[1:01:56] going to happen
[1:01:58] and god sees that spirit
[1:02:01] and he'll confound us
[1:02:04] he'll confound us because he's not going
[1:02:07] to share his glory
[1:02:09] with anybody
[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:11] nobody
[1:02:13] therefore to him that know it to do good
[1:02:16] and doeth it not to him
[1:02:18] it is sin
[1:02:23] let not the wise man glory
[1:02:26] in his wisdom
[1:02:29] nor
[1:02:30] the mighty man glory in his might and
[1:02:33] let not the rich man glory
[1:02:35] in his riches
[1:02:37] but him that glorieth
[1:02:39] glory in
[1:02:41] this
[1:02:43] that he understandeth
[1:02:45] and knoweth me
[1:02:47] wow that sounds like a
[1:02:49] quiet
[1:02:50] secret
[1:02:52] life
[1:02:56] and you know others will see it when
[1:02:58] it's lived out
[1:03:00] yes amen that's what i want people to
[1:03:03] look at me
[1:03:04] and see christ amen
[1:03:07] not hear me
[1:03:10] see me
[1:03:14] if you want to glory in anything glory
[1:03:15] in the fact that god has revealed to you
[1:03:17] personally
[1:03:20] who he is
[1:03:22] that god has
[1:03:26] used his word
[1:03:28] to reveal himself to you and through
[1:03:31] that you find your place in christ you
[1:03:33] find your place in the church
[1:03:36] you find a heart for ministry
[1:03:39] yeah you know we ought to be growing
[1:03:42] multiplying reaching out
[1:03:44] i mean what
[1:03:46] healthy church does
[1:03:50] but we got to get beyond ourself
[1:03:53] like take care of me first
[1:03:56] i always like to john f kennedy don't
[1:03:57] don't ask what this country can do for
[1:03:59] you ask what yourself what you can do
[1:04:01] for this country
[1:04:03] we ought to be doing something for the
[1:04:04] church of the living god amen
[1:04:08] i don't want you to do anything for me
[1:04:11] but do something for god
[1:04:16] stand with me
[1:04:18] either
[1:04:20] lead me if i'm doing wrong lead me
[1:04:27] or get out of my way if you're not going
[1:04:29] to follow me
[1:04:34] we ought to be
[1:04:36] going in the direction that christ wants
[1:04:38] us to go pressing towards the mark amen
[1:04:46] god says if a man doesn't work he
[1:04:48] shouldn't eat
[1:04:51] we all have a job at church
[1:04:56] we all have a burden that we carry
[1:05:01] to help somebody amen to bring some soul
[1:05:05] to christ
[1:05:12] that
[1:05:16] if i go to work and
[1:05:18] i don't do anything but i still want to
[1:05:20] get paid i'm kind of lifting myself up
[1:05:24] like i
[1:05:26] am
[1:05:27] above having to work
[1:05:31] but i still want the glory of getting
[1:05:33] paid
[1:05:35] as if i worked
[1:05:39] we're not going to work for the lord
[1:05:43] we're stealing glory
[1:05:46] i mean if we don't work we don't eat
[1:05:49] well what do we want to eat the
[1:05:51] revelation we want the revelation of the
[1:05:53] word
[1:05:54] we don't want a dead letter
[1:05:56] we don't want the dudes we want it to be
[1:05:58] real to us
[1:06:00] that's why we we should get the church
[1:06:02] early labor and prayer
[1:06:04] [Music]
[1:06:06] it's you can definitely pray for the
[1:06:08] ministry yes
[1:06:11] but i'll tell you this i'd rather have
[1:06:13] you pray that your heart's more prepared
[1:06:18] you go into catholic church and get a
[1:06:20] piece of bread brother ryan said
[1:06:23] and see how much he believes the message
[1:06:25] you still can receive if your heart is
[1:06:27] right that's right
[1:06:29] but you got to labor
[1:06:30] it can't be just well at church just go
[1:06:32] to church it's like god i need to hear
[1:06:35] from you today
[1:06:37] what do you want me to start doing what
[1:06:39] do you want me to start putting into
[1:06:40] practice
[1:06:41] what do you want me to stop doing
[1:06:43] whatever it might be
[1:06:44] god has something for all of us
[1:06:47] it's got to be that role let's stand
[1:06:49] together
[1:06:50] the more you exercise your trust in god
[1:06:53] the more he delights in exercising in
[1:06:56] your life
[1:06:59] the more he he desires to
[1:07:03] exercise your plans to
[1:07:06] to tell you what you're really wanting
[1:07:10] if you trust him
[1:07:13] we just need to be still
[1:07:16] and know that he's god
[1:07:19] be still
[1:07:22] and trust him
[1:07:24] be still and trust him
[1:07:26] yeah he's not going to come right away
[1:07:29] most often he's going to wait to see
[1:07:32] if we're going to keep trusting him
