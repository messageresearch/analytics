========================================
prince of peace hearts are mandated in the presence of peace in the presence of the king let's sing it one more time close our eyes just look to him in the present is amen let's look to him in prayer lord with our hearts bound lord from the very dust that you took us from [Music] realizing lord without you were nothing but with you in your presence lord you mend hearts you restore lives you heal bodies you you give joy you you fill the empty places with your love oh god we're standing here today because of you because of your presence in our life father we want to thank you that the doors are still open lord there's health and strength in our our bodies of desire to be here lord and we we thank you for your presence lord lord we just want to worship you and express our our gratefulness to your lord we want to enter into these gates with thanksgiving into your courts with praise and father we thank you for your word lord that it sustains us in this hour it keeps us in this hour lord are we need that word and we humbly pray that you'd come and reveal yourself to us give us the revelation of your word today lord that we may be strengthened that we may be encouraged lord that we may be strong to go out win souls for you lord we commit this service in your hands we pray your blessings and the reading of the word now for we humbly praise you in jesus precious name amen amen thank the lord i want to greet you in jesus precious name today once again it's good to be in god's house it's getting harder and harder i believe for our flesh as we see the the day approaching it's we we can't uh we we can't just move on the excitement of the flesh because the the flesh is weak and it's running out of excitement but praise the lord for the spirit of god that lives within us that we can't truly be excited about the word and and believing in the realness of god revealing himself to us and making himself known to us amen i want to say it's a joy to have sister genie with us again it's been a while been a long time what was the last sermon that we preached because we just don't want to do that one again okay it's been a while well it's certainly good to have you with us tonight we love you in christ amen turn with me if you would to the book of matthew chapter 28 for our opening scripture before we have you be seated matthew chapter 28 very familiar scripture the great uh commission known as starting with verse number 18 and jesus came and spake unto his disciples saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth go ye therefore and teaching teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i'm with you always even unto the end of the world amen god bless you may be seated god's going to be with us to the end does it matter does it matter what we feel that's right hallelujah he's still with us and so i came up with this idea i don't you know just tell me what you think about it uh that every two minutes everybody says amen now that's not you for you brother marcus that would be a slow slowdown so for you it's every minute this morning we spoke on receiving god's love and the greatest experience a sinner can have is when he receives the forgiveness of his sins i just there's not a greater experience a greater power in fact that's the only time [Applause] that is that i know that's recorded in heaven that the angels are rejoicing over that experience it's such a great experience for myself i've never experienced anything greater than when god forgave me and he cleaned me and this evening i want to speak on part two of experiencing god's love on the subject releasing god's love so this morning we we spoke on receiving it and and this this evening we want to speak on releasing god's love amen jesus said all power is given unto me amen and he he told his disciples to wait in jerusalem to tarry there until they receive the holy ghost is that true and he's he he shared with them that they're they're going to receive the same power that he had in acts chapter 1 verse 8 but ye shall ye shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me basically everywhere you go everywhere you go you're going to be a witness so all power was given unto jesus and he promised to give his disciples that same power after the holy ghost has come upon them allowing them to be a proper witness amen and he says go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost right amen i got it we got a good testimony sister hope is going to be baptized next sunday in the name of the father and then and the son and the holy ghost it's going to be in in the name of jesus christ because that that is the father and the son and the holy [Applause] teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you in law and with you always even unto the end of the world now god commands us to do a lot so the great commission is that we need to teach others the same thing and we can't always get him to come to church so we need to you know tell them right where they're at amen because it's still his command so when he comes to me and he says my son john why did not you tell so-and-so i can't say well because they didn't come to church because this commission is going to yell so we we can only do this by going out find a way to reach them and share with them what god's been sharing with you that is the command it's releasing god's love this is god's love the motive here is love it it's not religion it's it's it's not i have to it's a it's a desire it's it's a it's a love desire acts chapter 20 verse 35 i have showed you all things paul's speaking how that soul laboring ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of our lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive so i mean it was a great experience that we had when god forgave us when he loved us when we had that experience but it is a greater experience to have that same flow out of you to somebody else because now god's using your body to do what he did to you [Music] it's more blessed to give christ than to receive christ amen we can get real selfish and real stingy and real greedy and all about us that's right basically get all wrapped up in our self and forget that there is something greater than that when jesus christ can use your body can use your mind your your lips and your heart and your time and your money to go out somebody yes amen you will be blessed i'll say it like this you'll be more blessed god has a way of blessing you when you let him use your body you you know how it is when somebody uh helps you i think brother mark was telling me this morning how much he appreciated brother jacob coming over and helping him with his car and just spent hours with him to the late hours of the night helping him with his car and he just he felt so overjoyed and so indebted and just said you know whatever you whatever you need i'm just i'm just what you just tell me i'll be there that's what he said what he said it was a and there's a real realness and a feeling that he felt from what brother jacob had done for him and if your car is broke down you don't have anything somebody lets you use their car you feel indebted to them and god at this point can't reach anybody he chose the preaching of men he chose men to spread the gospel and when we let god use our bodies all he just rewards us with joy he lets us know he lets us know that we did the right thing amen that you and him became a worker together to win a soul another part of the family came together that they wouldn't have made it without you how many times did we hear brother barnum express when he went beyond the curtain of time we wouldn't have made it unless you came so was it brother branham come on think about it brother brother branham was was raised by a drunk parent so you know was it brother branham he wanted to to just to to to uh to to do the things of the world and the spirit stopped him he gave himself to god he lent his body to god just like the most subtle beast lent his body to the devil brother lent his body to god and god used him to win millions to get this message to you we wouldn't be here if it wouldn't have been for a brother we'll say the same thing that he said we'll say the same thing but we'll probably be sending to more people because down the chain right went through a lot of people to get to us but that indebtedness they gave it is the greatest thing that we can ever experience is when we release the love of god amen manifest the love of god no doubt we were blessed when god poured out his love amen his great love wherewith he loved us and gave himself for us when we were done our sins and our trespasses and he took his grace and he he saved our lives and it wasn't by our works or good looks or anything like that he gets all the credit we stand here by the grace of god indebted to god amen but it's more blessed to give out the love of god to others than just to be on the receiving end brother brown talk to us about a a system system am i saying that saying that correctly okay see you all know what i mean when they say it wrong i didn't have to ask you if it's right you already know he said it has no outlet it just it's just receiving all the time he says it becomes a dead cesspool now think about that how do you think god feels when he's just given love giving giving giving to you and you hold it all in we need to let the love of god out we need to release it you know it just multiplies when you give it out and it kind of shrivels up to nothing when you keep it inside amen you get joy by sharing jesus what is your love calling you to do your love will pull you to do your will the love of christ will pull you to do his will the love of god ought to be holding us in the same theme together turn with me if you would to second corinthians chapter 5 verse 14 and we we hope pray trust doing our very best not to be lengthy tonight because we had the service today and it'd be nice to not be long wasn't it can you say amen today what else should i say amen to that one that's another way to encourage your pastor to hurry up hey as long as long as we get the message across right chapter 14 of second corinthians chapter 5 for the love of christ constraineth us this commandment to go ye out it shouldn't be grievous no sir even though it is our responsibility and brother brother brandon said we need to accept our responsibility it shouldn't be grievous to us when brother branham got back from the curtain of time he said i'm uh uh i feel more responsible than i ever have in my life to get the message out of that's what he said now what made him say that he was in the presence of perfect love it was perfect love that made him say that he wanted to release what he received that's why i say what are you releasing your love will release your desires and feed that's why we don't want to feed on the things of the world because we're just going to get nowhere somewhere down the line we've got to release god's love and we all should better stand up and testify this is what i'm doing on a daily basis on a weekly basis to release god's love amen for the love of christ constraineth us constrains us unites us together in one purpose because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead we no longer exist i don't have a name and building my own life and doing my own thing i'm dead why am i dead because he died for me i'm no longer my own i've been bought with a price he does with me what he wants imagine of all the things that you bought just decided to say you know what i don't like your driveway i'm going back to the auto dealer i like being with the other new cars how about the groceries you bought you go to the fridge and they just all sudden they're not there and there you see them going down the sidewalk how do you think god feels when we've surrendered our life we gave jesus our life and you said you you know what i just i got things i got to do i'll fit you in on a sunday and wednesday but don't you ask me to do two on a sunday you understand the thoughts that are that we battle inside we can say amen to the scripture but do you really have that feeling inside where you feel that we're all dead and we belong to christ and you feel christ changing your life like like do you feel tomorrow this week tuesday i'm changing things up i'm i'm letting the word do something in my life it would just absolutely be to me wasteless to come to church hear the word and not be changed fruitless no good we're just fooling ourselves [Music] we need to change just a little something need you need to put in action in the direction that god wants you to go he wants how can people hear christ if we if we don't bring christ to them we can we can give them a bible we can give them a plaque we can say we're praying for them but you know somehow they've got to see it they got to see sacrifice and laying down your life and doing the same thing christ did for you that's what it means to release the love of god verse 15 and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him that died and rose again i love that amen like i said every minute we need to amen if we get more amens we get into it more we get more out of it right what you get what you put in is what you get out did you know you could sit here never say amen and and like watching the discovery channel you know reading some seminary booklet we want to have this word come alive to us and be real and what can't sit still because the word is so real to us you know i can't do that for you no preacher can't he a preacher can get up here and make you feel good it won't take long until you're not feeling good anymore but if you get serious with god you don't need a preacher to make you feel good you need a relationship with jesus christ it'll make you feel good verse 16 wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yet though we have known he known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth knowing no more therefore if any of us are in jesus christ we're different we're different than before we knew him amen we're a new creature our own life has gone by amen and our whole life was about us all you had to do is look back in your life look at what you did or what your parents did or what somebody that was in the world what they did what what it meant to the old life they lived for themselves there was no releasing of god's love and you can't release what you don't have so you have to get it to release it and when you have it god don't let it stay there now i understand there could be some trouble with will because he's got to work through self-will but i know when it's bubbling it's bubbling it just wants to come out and when it's not then i know i need a trip to the altar eat a trip to the altar get filled back up he's a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new and you just want to share jesus with somebody and you ever share jesus with somebody get turned down you still feel good it's awesome because you're in the will of god paul wasn't responsible for everybody he knew he's only going to get something but i believe he was just as happy sharing jesus with everyone and i believe it was it was god in him amen and all things are of god who have reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us a responsibility let's talk about your ministry amen a ministry of reconciliation is about restoring others to it that god was in christ reconciling the world to himself not imputing their trespasses on them and have committed them to us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ and be reconciled to god so that's basically your whole motive when you're talking to a sinner or to someone that needs to be restored to the truth they may be in a partial truth and you're trying to bring them into more truth your goal is to reconcile them to god because they're not in the place that god wants them to be even though they may feel they're just fine they don't know that they don't have that responsibility now you carry that you carry that burden just like jesus carried that your burden to the to calvary for the joy that was set before him he could do it and when you have that vision that i i see this person saved right in the will of god that vision it gives you joy gives you strength when they say get out of here you know no i love you get out of it i still love you i'm here for one purpose to reconcile you to get you to god oh i am god thank you i know you have gotta i just want to share more of god there's more of god there's there's more of god and not belittling what god you have i just want to share more of god and it takes a time to do this and i say if god's love is inside of you it you'll just be releasing that part two is harder than part one it comes with a responsibility does it not brother button says if your your candle is lit you're obligated to go light somebody else's and and god is not obligated to give you the gospel twice if somebody else hasn't heard it once i mean think about how important it is to release this love to everybody i don't believe that jesus was just talking to the 12 disciples think about this why would it be recorded so if you were one of the 12 disciples and you were standing there would you say oh no this is just for matthew mark luke and john and to think that even though you weren't there you're placing yourself there how that makes god feel here's someone that believes my word without a feeling without an emotion here's someone with a vision without a vision the people perish the only way we'll release the love of god turn with me to first john chapter 3. all right some of you honestly have been missing your two minutes i would say you know would help you just stay awake but that would be real carnal first john chapter 3 verse 13 marvel not my brethren if the world hate you you're the best thing sent sliced bread and you're wondering why people hate you you're trying to help them and you wonder why people hate you when you're just trying to help them you ever do that i just tried helping them and they marvel not my brethren if the world hates you we know that we have passed from death unto life for one thing because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death so the world is exercising a lesser love it's a love for self and we know that we're separated from the world for one purpose because we don't hate anybody it's easy to say why i love 90 of the people but that's did you know i was the the brother of jesus christ when i was in sin i was still his brother i just wasn't reconciled yet i wasn't cleansed i wasn't washed i i didn't know him i didn't even know him as i was like a foster child didn't know who my parent was then they he came into the and adoption part of the family so there's people out there that don't agree with us that are against us that that say terrible negative things about the word about god that could be our brother you never want to hate anybody for any reason as soon as you do you're separating yourself that's what the world does we know that we got eternal life because we love one another he that loveth not his brother abideth in death something has taken place when we're not consumed with ourselves anymore because the world is consumed with themselves we have a much greater interest a much greater value to esteem when we're loving one another when something has taken place in your life when love has come into your heart there's a greater interest than just for yourself it's for others the world loves themselves but we love our enemies what a difference what a difference something has taken place when we're not consumed with ourselves anymore even our thoughts we can hardly get others off our minds because there's a burden there a love there for their soul you know we can get so consumed with ourselves that we don't even think about somebody's soul i want you as you're hearing this word today being preached i want you to examine yourself are you releasing god's love or are you in a pool our words our conversation should be easily read by others that we love them something should stand out about us than a million other people amen verse 15 whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and you know that no murders have eternal life abiding in him i'd like to know who is guilty of murder today let me see your hands one two three four we got few honest people in here what about the rest of you the world would never consider a man looking at a woman or a woman looking at a man with a desire for them guilty of adultery is that true can't go to court like that but you know god would the world court would never put a man on trial for murder if he was just talking negatively about someone but god would so whose standard are you judging yourself with the world or gods to put a knife in the back of someone's influence is guilty of murder [Applause] and the scripture says that no murderer have eternal life abiding in him this is why this is so important because either we got to hold ourselves accountable or totally ignore the word and i think it'd be better to let the word change our attitude and you know that no murder have eternal life abiding in him verse 16 hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren so let's just get this straight i want to perceive whether i got the love of god god came into my life he changed my life he made me just feel so good so let's perceive that love all his brother john does is talk about jesus lay down his life from but i don't see anything different but you will perceive the love of god when i lay down my life for somebody else [Applause] so i want to ask you today i want to perceive your life i want you to perceive the love of god in your life what are you laying down because we can know exactly where we're at we can know how much love of you know you go in your gas tank you go in your car and you look at the tank and you know how much gas is in there we come to church to find out where we're at with god the devil will tell us all day long how good we are we're so good we don't even need to go to church anymore you'll be just fine stay home take it easy you're still bride but you come and you hear the word and you allow that word perceive the love of god in me who am i laying down my life for christ laid down his life for me we ought in other words we're not doing it we ought to be doing it we ought to be laying down our life for somebody fill the blanket fill the blanket every day this is fill the blank no you used to go to school and it was multiple choice you thought at least i got a chance you got to fill the blank hole man you're in trouble multiple choice do you love god yes i love god fill in the blank who are you loving who are you laying down your life for test becomes harder but there's the only way you can perceive whether you know this stuff or not you ever take a test and you just you do real good on it but it's all guesswork you know what i'm talking about i told you about the time my teacher i got i didn't get good grades hardly through the whole thing i almost aced it on my final and he did everything he could except stand there and deny me right to my face that i was a cheater but i stayed up all night and i studied like i'd never studied before it's what it took but you can't fake the love of god that's right by this shall all men know that you're my disciples when you have this same love where you lay down your life releasing the love of god release it if it's in you release it don't hold it don't keep it don't say it's for me and my family release it to another soul that don't know him yet because that's what it's for so what are you doing with your time i just don't have much time brother john i don't have much time i barely have time to make it to church let me ask you a question when have you in your life ever had enough time oh i can't wait till i retire and then what the prophet taught us that eternal life is living for others eternal life is living for eternal things so when you're living for somebody's soul that's eternal when you're just baking my favorite pie which you know we need to step that up a little bit when when you're just baking my favorite pie it's not eternal you may get a reward for it that's not eternal can you imagine going to heaven we're having a giving pie to the pastor contest and so and so over here won it with umpteen pies for their pastor okay what are we gonna do talk about that for 10 000 years but get a soul saved that soul will not want to leave your presence because they know they wouldn't be there without you that's how important it is to bring jesus to somebody and don't listen to a devil that tells you well if it's god god would speak to him anyways [Applause] can you imagine if god told paul that oh don't worry i'll get the word to them you just take it easy god wants to express his love if if alls i'm going to do is pat my brother's back hoping that he'll pat mine am i not like the publicans but when you can do something for somebody knowing they can't do it back to you that's the love of god and every one of us has an opportunity to do that you just need to put it on your heart to go find somebody to share the love of god with somebody to release it don't hold it in release the love of god we're living in heaven we're not going to be thinking about temporal things so what does it mean to live for others what does that mean does it mean to make pies to one another next sunday next sunday you bring a piece of paper i want to know all the things that you've been doing to live for others we need it we can't be satisfied with saying i'm in the message i received the message i've been saved what are we doing with what we've been given we've got to release the love of god let god use our bodies release that love of god amen hereby we perceive we understand what the love of god is for because his great love wherewith he loved us his enemies he loved his enemies he laid down his life for us and when the love of god is shut about in our hearts by the holy ghost we will do the very same thing because god is the same yesterday today and forever he's just using a different body he's not using william brandon anymore he's using you he's not using the pastor he's using you amen the greatest power a believer can ever experience is when they release the love of god to another soul there is no greater experience greater love have no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends john 15 verse 12 this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you god went to extremes to get me he had to basically knock me off of my horse he had to show me i was so wrong amen and then he just spent time with me kept calling my heart kept saying i'm here i'm here for you just give your heart to me sometimes we just get all upset bothered because we tried sharing jesus with somebody and they get all offended can you imagine if the holy ghost stopped with you greater love have no manners and a man lay down his lie for his friends now remember when jesus laid down his life for you you were his enemy you only became a friend afterwards so the people that we're talking to may not be our friends right now but we we believe they are they just don't know it right you know brother bran could come up to the pulpit and he'd say good morning friends there were people out there that hated him that he was a friend to them it's the god inside of you is befriending them amen and he said in verse 14 you are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you god has commanded us to lay down our life to live for others the greatest power sinner can experience is when he receives forgiveness of his sins so if god is in you release forgiveness somebody offends you release forgiveness release love release grace be christ to them let christ be himself inside of you whoa that was fresh let christ be himself inside of you just let go and let god have his wonderful way remember the parable this morning of who loved the most was proven by who was who forgave the most jesus forgave both equally but the one that had the greatest debt loved the most so i say instead of looking at every time you get offended or bothered by something or some one or or some situation instead of being bothered by it look at it as an opportunity to manifest the love of god because the more that you forgive somebody shows you've got more love you know you want to be so full of the love of god that no matter which way you're you know pushed offended love comes out is full of compassion we should be too jude chapter 1 verse 22 and some have compassion making a difference who makes a difference when you think of the people in your life who's made a difference in your life the person who writes you off the person who don't care the person don't want to give you the time of day it's the person that has compassion they are the ones that will lay down their life they make a difference i think it's time for us to start making more of a difference amen can you say amen to that it's time for us to start using compassion to make the difference in somebody's life brother branham said in the message love he said when love excuse me he didn't say that he said when love has been projected and comes to its end sovereign grace stepped in and took its place he said it will do it every time he said that's the nature of god he can't do nothing else for anybody but when you really truly love him loving him is not just a mystical thought but i mean in your heart he becomes dear to you now i want you to think about that when we think about the love of god inside of us it isn't just a thought it's it's something that controls you constrains you in other words you want to go this way but the love of god says no go this way it controls you it's that real if it's something that's just in your head and it's a it's a mystical thought it's not that real to you it's time to spend more time with the love of god amen so what are the boundaries of god's great love ephesians chapter 3 verse 17 just how far will the love of god go what is the extremes that god's love will go ephesians 3 verse 17 that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breath length death and height and to know the love of god that passes knowledge that ye might be filled with the fullness of god amen now unto him that is able to do exceed me above all that we ask or think according to the power what the power that's working in us did not he say we would receive power after the holy ghost has come upon us now the more of the love of god we have in us the more power we have and it takes more power to forgive than to judge it takes more power to lay down your life than say no i can't let that person step on me again you know i'm done turning my cheek i'm done going the second mile i'm done done done done you never see the love of god saying i'm done done done done all you're doing is speaking about your love because god love has no end it it never quits it on the day of judgment is when it's all over but until then we should continue to lay down our life well once hate filled paul's life and he didn't care about hurting others even killing others but the love of god came inside paul's heart and it produced the same effect that it did on jesus he laid down his life for his friends he got stoned he was afflicted from being whipped just like jesus five times received 39 stripes on his body he said in one place i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus christ he was persecuted beaten with rods he frequently went to prison and he died often i i can't quite comprehend that but maybe he died a lot more than we realize but if he did no wonder he could say in acts chapter 20 verse 24 but none of these things move me neither come in my my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry of reconciliation that god gave me which i have received to the lord to testify the gospel of the grace of god he wanted to finish his ministry he wanted to finish his course and he didn't want to come to church drudgingly he wanted to do a joy i think god was in control of his vessel we cannot let our lamps go out we can't let the holy ghost slip out you the world would drag so much out of us the paul of the world would drag out so much and we've got to come back to god we got to spend time at the altar we got to spend time seeking the holy ghost we've got to humble ourself and realize that something is missing because you can't give out what you don't have i understand there's one baptism but we need some fillings we need more fillings we need to get to the filling station don't tell me your car's electric get to the filling station get get charged up acts chapter 21 verse 13 then paul answered what me need to weep and to break my heart for i am not but i i am ready not to be bound only but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus christ that's to me eternal life that to me is laying down your life so how far will god's love take you for a soul how far has it been taking you how many bible studies have you been having with somebody that don't know jesus how much time have you been spending with someone what sacrifices will you make for a soul some have compassion making a difference some not everybody but this word god deals with us as as individual gentiles some this word is just going to roll off the back like water off a duck's back in some this word is going to penetrate it's going to penetrate into the heart because the heart has been prepared there's a sincerity inside and they want to lay down their life they want to let love be released they want to take their relationship the next step the greatest power a believer can experience is releasing the love of god inside of you to have god use your body wow release what you have give it up god will give you more cast your bread upon the water give it to seven even to eight we don't have a promise of tomorrow you don't need you know you may not have a chance to live for god tomorrow if it was over today would you be happy with what you did for christ would you be happy would you be satisfied would you be standing there with your list of what you did with your time oh a person that sold out to god can do more for god in a year than a lot of people can do for the lord in a lifetime want to have every excuse in the book and the other just says all to jesus all to jesus there is nothing else worth living for so don't be a system a system don't let your life get all wrapped up in yourself let the love of god constrain you to reach out while you have a chance if you are honest with yourself and you look back two years ago one year ago isn't it harder today to serve god than it was then isn't there less of a desire today those of you that been serving the lord a while well it's getting harder the world's getting darker and it's harder to get a hold of god in church we're hoping that that something controls our feeling and what we need to do is get our feelings under god and set our affections on things above and not just be satisfied with church attendance i've never experienced a love so great as when god uses me to help another soul just naturally when you do something for somebody you get such a a wonderful feeling even if you make a pie it's a wonderful feeling to do it and give it to somebody but there's no greater experience that i've ever experienced that when i've laid down my life for a soul i feel so unworthy because that soul that god is reaching to is worth ten thousand worlds so i wanna leave you with this i wanna encourage you to start exercising the releasing of god's love there's what a way to experience it you you have received it now release it and and keep that cycle going receive more give more receive more give more and keep the life of christ flowing through your life don't be satisfied with the knowledge and what you have received up here and where you're standing hold yourself accountable to living for others amen let's stand together [Applause] amen so glad i'm yours lord so glad i'm yours [Applause] [Music] so glad i'm yours lord so glad i'm your so glad your mercy has followed me so glad you found me and set me free so right
