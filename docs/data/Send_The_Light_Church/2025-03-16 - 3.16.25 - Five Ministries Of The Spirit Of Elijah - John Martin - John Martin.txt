people that are waking up wondering about heaven God we're here today because we want you to come by here Lord we've come to meet with you and I pray Lord that you would bless our hearts that we would be able to be able to catch you to catch your presence open our eyes open our hearts open our ears and help us to recognize that your presence is here this is not just as it were another service Lord but this is an opportunity Lord that you've given us to recognize your presence and I pray that you'd receive our praise receive our worship and our our hunger that you come by here and open the Word of Life To Us Lord you see the needs to be among us Lord amongst a people like this we all have needs I pray today Lord that you'd meet every one of those needs whether it be physical spiritual Lord Financial you're able to take Thy word and to be every need Lord according to as it pleases thee and now Lord as we wait on thee we know that you have a word for us and I pray that we could just grasp it give us Revelation lord of the things that will be spoken as we commit the service and your hands in the reading of the scriptures now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen amen God bless you this morning it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen amen amen was it sure whether we were going to have service this morning or whether we were going to postpone it because we had a thought of postponing it to uh 4 o' if the power didn't come on but it did come on and so we're grateful to the Lord for that that was our prayer am amen turn with me if you would to the book of First Kings chapter 17 First Kings how many appreciated the worship service amen amen it just it really uh tills the ground of our heart and prepares us for the word amen the Bible says that God inhabits the Praises of his people amen and if praise comes from the heart he inhabits the heart amen if the praise just comes from the lips right so we want our our praise to come from our heart and you know our praise doesn't stop after the worship amen amen it uh it begins there and we continue on in the word amen let's just bow our heart before we begin reading here heavenly father thank you for this book lord we we can read these words perhaps not even real proper but uh Lord you've given all of us somewhat of an understanding of the English language and what these things could mean we all would have maybe a opinion of the things that will be uh read today but Lord we're asking that you would uh take all of our opinions away and that you would give us the mind of Christ as we read Thy word please give us Lord what we have need of today and we'll give you the praise for this in Jesus precious name amen amen First Kings chapter 17 uh and Elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of uh Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord of Israel liveth the Lord God of Israel liveth whom before whom I stand there shall not be due nor rain these years but according to my word notice that my word and the word of the Lord came unto him saying get thee hence and turn thee Eastward and hide thyself by the book cheriff and that is before Jordan and it shall be that thou shall drink of the Brook and I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there so he went and did according to the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by the Brook Sheriff that is before Jordan and the Ravens brought him bread and fish in the morning and the bread and the fish in the evening and he drank of the brook and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zerth which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee and so he rose and went to Zer a fth and when he came to the gate of the city behold the the widow woman was there Gathering of sticks and he called to her and he said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me I pray a morsel of bread in thy hand and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I will not I have not a cake but a handful of meal and a barrel and a little oil in the cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me my son that we may eat it and die amen God bless you you may be seated may the Lord add the blessings the reading of his word this morning morning brother Gideon is a live streaming he wanted to send his greetings to everybody today amen I'm sure brother Ron um brother Marty there they are and I know some others are as well may God be with you all that are live streaming today we want to title this message the five ministries of the spirit of Elijah the five ministries of the spirit of Elijah God uses the ministry of Elijah as a prophetic Ministry the office of a prophet five different times in the Bible we know according to Ephesians he gave some Apostles evangelists pastors teachers and Prophets and Elijah was a major prophet amen and he uses this ministry two times in the Old Testament and three times in the New Testament four of them have all already been fulfilled one of them is yet to be fulfilled and Elijah according to the scriptures uh he performed or the the Bible uh declares that he had eight different Miracles that took place and we just read uh one of them here um he caused a a drought to to to to take place um and God uses the office of a prophet to get his word across to the people yes now he also needs to show them a sign to that they would know because a prophet is really a Seer and and God uses Major Prophets to unveil the mind of God to the people but how many people do we know say God told me this and it didn't come to pass so there's a lot of people like that so how do we know a true Prophet well we can go here to the book of Deuteronomy these are going to be all scriptures today no quotes Deuteronomy 18 verse number 20 says but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in the in my name which I have not commanded him to speak or that or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that Prophet shall die and if thou shall say in thy heart how shall we know the word which the Lord have not spoken and when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass then that is the thing which the Lord has not spoken but the prophet have spoken it presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him so there's so many people that prophesy things and some of them come to pass let some you not but God's prophet when he speaks it comes to pass in the name of the Lord it always comes to pass that's how you know you can have confidence Amos 3:7 says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servant his Prophet the prophets so God always uses a prophet that's just all there is to it and it's just not the New Testament like I said there's two in the old and three in the New Testament and God help us we're going to get through these so Elijah predicts the drought according to his word I like how verse one says and Elijah the tishbite said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth be whom I stand there shall not be dun or rain these days but according to my word he calls it my word James 5 uh 17 James 5:17 Isaiah speaking of the same man was uh uh isaas was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of three years and six months can you imagine having no rain for three and a half years and he spoke and it was according to the will of God and he prayed again and the heavens gave rain in the earth brought forth her fruit and this is important because God is looking at his people and he sees his people they are they're they're walking in sin they're not believing they're serving other gods they're in the things of the world and God has to get the attention of the people and God uses a prophet to cause things to happen to get people's attention to to bring judgment sometimes of various reasons but we know that God uses this office in a very very serious manner amen so the ministry of Elijah had power to control weather we've seen that in this age as well am it had power to sustain the poorest Widow who was willing to put the prophet first you know you would think that God would say don't you go ask in a will she don't got anything in fact she's only got enough for one more meal and you're going to go to her and be so rude to say give me first a little bit you know God is always waiting to see if we're going to put him first and if we can't put God first then then God is not first in their life too many people in this age don't want to put the message before their life that's the truth now I'll tell you God did not send this message so you could take and just spring over it if you want it or don't want it amen I'm telling you God is watching your attitude towards it we're going to pick it up here in First Kings 713 I like this that the Widow all she had was a handful of of meal in a baron a little oil and a cruise and sticks and and Elijah said unto her in verse 13 fear not go and do as thou has said but make me therefore there a little cake first and bring it unto me and after for the and for thy son for thus sayith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruise of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth reain upon the Earth that was three and a half years that the barrel never ran Dr the oil never ran out you talk about a miracle our God is able to do exceedingly above all that we could ask or even think he's the one that makes a way only thing we have to do is put him first not figure out how to do it put him first he'll Supply the miracle and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days and the barrel meal wasted not neither did the cruise of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah the ministry of Elijah so if you put the word of the Prophet first in your life I want to say that if you put the word of the Prophet first in your life God will not only sustain you but I believe this he'll Prosper you he'll Prosper you amen the word of God's Prophet will spiritually sustain the believer in this hour Amos 811 behold the days cometh sayeth the Lord God that I will send a famine in the land not a not a famine of bread nor a thirst of water but the hearing of the words of the Lord you can't hardly go anywhere and you feel like you got to sift out what's being said it's a truth and they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from North even to the east they shall run to and fro and seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it but God is able to sustain the believer in This Hour 2 Chronicles 20:20 hear me oh Judah Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established Believe In His prophets so shall ye Prosper amen now this word belief is like believing in Jesus you it's not it's not say well I believe Jesus exist that's not what brings prosperity it's not I believe you know I believe in the prophet of this hour that does not bring Prosperity you literally have to believe the message that he spoke and to the point that you apply everything to your heart that you you you read it and you say God I want it and you take it in and you start living other people see it that is really what it means to believe so we know that he he raised the Widow son from the dead we won't have time to get into all these Elijah prayed and God miraculously brought the Widow son back to life and then he had this show down at Mount carel we all know about that Elijah challenged 450 different religious I'll just say it like this false Believers yes right they had so many things in common brother brandham said they had so many they were they were had so many things in common yet they didn't believe in God and First Kings 18:21 said Elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the Lord God if the Lord be God follow him but if baale then follow him you know that's the thing there's there's too many people that want to just be in lukewarm leoa going here going there one day you can't even count on them so how long Hal between two opinions if you believe the message start walking in it if it's not find something else so he prophesied and he brought forth rain at the end of the drought after the mount carel we don't have time that's a great story Mount Carmel The Showdown when fire came down afterwards he destroyed 51 Soldiers with fire and lightning two different times and uh King hazer a hazra had gotten ill and he sent men to inquire listen of be elub the god of acran whether I shall recover of his disease because he got one in 2 Kings 1:3 and the angel of the Lord said unto Elijah the tishbite according arise go to meet The Messengers uh of the king of Syria Samaria and say unto them is it not because there is not a God in Israel that you go and inquire beab the god of acran God knows sometimes we go and we try to get our needs met in another way than God am God doesn't like that when we don't put him first he demands respect can you say amen God demands respect we have a choice not to respect but God demands it right so the king sends 50 men with a captain to tell Elijah to come down off his Hill we'll pick it up in 2 Kings 1:13 here if they put it up on the board and the King sent again a captain of the third 50 with his 50 and the third captain of the 50 went up and fell down on his knees before Elijah and besought him and said unto him oh man of God I pray thee let my let my life and the life of these 50 servants be precious in thy sight now notice the two the two groups of 51 that came up they come up and said Elijah come down you know our King wants to talk to you kind of this disrespectful attitude no humility at all and finally the king sends this another group of 50 up he says man I know what's going to happen to me if I go up and just do what my king told me to do I'm going to be consumed so they walked the church with humility amen right they came in with a right manal attitude and said behold there came fire down from heaven and burnt up the two captains of the formal 50s with their 50 therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight and the angel of the Lord said unto Elijah go down with him be not afraid of him and he arose and went down with him unto the king see God God can trust somebody who's humble God can trust somebody who's real be afraid of that person who's not respectful respect God's prophets God demands respect to His prophets I'll say like this respect or you or you spiritually die you respect the prophets or you spiritually die 1 Chronicles 16:20 and when they went from Nation to nation and from one Kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do the wrong y he approved Kings and for their sakes saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm now this scripture is so important you'll find it two times in the Bible touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm God watches over His prophets and the thing is I'll say like this anything that you do against the prophet in the message it's going to come back and hurtt you it will so the last one was when he parted the Waters of the Jordan River and Elijah was with Elisha when this happened and they parted the river and they went across on dry land and I just want to read a little bit here in First Kings 19:19 there's going to be a lot of a lot of scripture a lot of information but I want you to do is just catch the spirit of everything so Elijah in verse 19 so Elijah departed then and from Elisha and found Elisha the son of japa who was plowing with 12 Yol of oxen before him and he with the 12 and Elijah passed by him and he cast his Manel upon him I just think this is so beautiful and he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said let me I pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then I will follow thee and he said unto them go back again for what have I done to thee I mean if that's your choice you want to go do that you go do that and he returned back from him and he took a Yol of oxin and slew them and bowed their fle uh flesh with the instruments of The Oxen and gave unto the people and did eat then he arose and went after Elijah and ministered unto him Elisha became Elijah's servant Elijah became a Elisha's Mentor we all are following somebody you just need to be careful who you're following because the spirit that you're because the spirit that's on them who you're following is really what's leading you so when Elisha heard the call of God through the prophet he left everything to follow the prophet's message of that hour no different than in in this hour Second Kings 21 you can say Amen to that by the way amen 2 Kings 2:1 and it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha from gilgal and Elisha said unto Elijah said to Elisha Terry here and I pray thee for the Lord have sent me to bethl and Elijah said unto him as the Lord liveth as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they went down to bethl and the sons of the prophets that were at bethl came from forth to Elisha and said unto him knowest thou not that uh the Lord will take away thy master from thy head today and he said yeah I know it hold your peace hold your peace and Elijah said unto and Elijah said unto him Elisha take carry here and I pray thee for the Lord have sent me to Jericho and he said as the Lord liveth as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee so they came to Jericho and the sons of the prophets of the Jericho came out to elishah and said unto him knowest not that the Lord have taken th will take thy master from thy head today and he answered yeah I know but hold thy peace and Elijah said unto him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord have said to me said sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and as my soul liveth I will not leave thee and they too went on notice that Elijah made so much opportunity to keep Elija from him and a lot of times the Lord will will provide opportunities for us to to to to have a problem that we can't make it to church make make make it so you you you you just don't have time to to to listen to a tape to to read your Bible to he'll just he'll do that because he wants to see if you're to say is the Lord liveth I'm going to do what the will of the Lord is and the 50 men of the sons want to make sure I got that verse 7even and and the 50 men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view far a far off and the two stood by Jordan Elijah took his man and wrapped it together and smot the waters and they divided hither and thither hither and thither so that they the two went over on dry ground same as he did with Moses right and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elijah said I pray thee let a double portion of your spirit be upon me what a thing to ask he didn't care about anything of this world he wanted the spirit he wanted a right spirit and he he he wanted a double portion he got it too and he said thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so he knew that God would have to take control of the situation right that is right and it came to pass as they still went on and talked and behold there appeared a a chariot of fire and a horse of fire and part of them both as sun and Elijah went up and a whirlwind into heaven it was his own Rapture amen and Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the Chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them into two pieces he took up also the man of Elijah and fell that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan he took that man of Elijah and that fell from him and smot the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he and when he also had Smit the waters they parted and thither thither hither and thither and Elijah went over and this this was the beginning of his ministry this was uh we could say like the first miracle Elisha hungered for the god that the Prophet Elijah had talked about and I just wonder I wonder in this age how many people are really hungering for what the prophet had talked about I wonder how many people want a double portion Bible says we have not because we ask not Elisha asked for the right thing and he got it and Elisha perform twice as many miracles as Elijah did amen we got we got one a amen out of that it's the truth he did he asked for a double portion and the Bible records twice as many miracles as Elijah did amen I just want to read a couple you'll find it all if you write it down Second Kings you will find these Miracles but God gave fertility to a woman of a shemite raised a child from the dead he healed nam in the of leprosy you know also uh Gesa was cursed with Leprosy so one was healed and one was cursed he made iron axe head float and he struck the amanian blind so and there's many things 16 of but I just wanted to read some but Elijah was the SEC was the uh the the Elisha was the second time that God had used this min Ministry in the Bible now the third was in the New Testament but I want to read a prophecy that spoke about it in the Old Testament and that's Malachi chapter 3 behold I send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of his Covenant whom ye Delight in behold he shall come sayth the Lord of host one more prophecy it's in Isaiah 40:3 the voice of him that crith in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight um in the desert a highway for our God every Valley shall be exalted Every Mountain shall Hill shall be made low and the Crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain so here it is this is a prophecy in the Old Testament about a prophet that's coming in the New Testament are you with me amen amen amen amen and the and I'll say the first two uh uh ministries of Elijah were very very powerful very powerful so we want to pick it up here in in the New Testament it's in Luke 1: 13 but the angel said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name John and thou shalt have joy and glad gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink but he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of Israel shall be turned to the Lord their God many of the children of Israel shall be turned to the Lord their God and the Lord shall go before him what in the spirit and the power of Elias this is the third time that this spirit is being used the spirit and the power ofas ielas to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children the disobedient of the wisdom to the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord so notice his job was to prepare the people for the first coming of Christ amen it was to deal with the hearts of the people and I'll say it like this we're going to call them Old Testament fathers and turn them to Christ that was his job to take the Old Testament and say look Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world that was his job amen because Christ was going to bring them to the New Birth Verse 18 and Z Zachariah said unto the angel whereby shall I know this how I know what I'm hearing is the truth for I am an old man and my wife well stricken in years and the angel answering said unto him I am Gabriel that standeth in the presence of God and I'm sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these Glad Tidings and behold Thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my word which shall be fulfilled in their season how important it is to believe what the prophet said what the what the seventh age messenger said how's that so we need to be careful no no doubting God's word don't got doubt God's prophets it's it's it's one thing to say I don't understand I don't I I've never heard that before I didn't see that in the Bible I I I don't it's okay to say that it is not okay to say I don't believe it it's not even okay to have an attitude that I don't believe it because that's what God's looking at amen John chapter 1 St John chapter 1 verse 19 and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who art thou and I want you to catch this John comes on the scene the priests and the Levites are trying to figure out and the Jews trying to figure out who John really is amen and so they asked the question who art thou well we know he was the The Prophet Elijah the third time it was being used uh and but listen he says and he confessed and denied not but confessed I am not the Christ he made it clear he looked so much like Christ but he said I'm not Christ and they asked him what then art thou Elias and he answered I am not art thou that prophet and he answered no I don't think John was trying to be humble here I don't think he was trying to be humble and say no I'm not a prophet I'm not that Prophet they had him mixed up with a different Elijah amen because he said that Prophet we'll we'll see they were referring to the prophet that was coming before his second coming not his first coming and he didn't lie he wasn't being humble he was humble but he wasn't trying to be humble then said they unto him who art thou then G give us give uh that we may give an answer to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself and what does he do he quotes the very scripture of the Old Testament he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight way the Lord as he said the prophet Isaiah or I Isaiah and they which were sent were of the phes and they asked him and said unto him why bapti baptizes thou then if thou be not the Christ or isaas neither that prophet and John answered them saying I baptize thee with water but there standeth one among you whom you know not he it is who cometh after me is preferred before me whose shoe latchees I am not worthy to un lose amen right at that time John was on earth and the majority of the people did not recognize the ministry just like in this age same thing in this age we find out that this prophet he didn't play around he said it was he said it like it was he wasn't a pushover this Elias's Ministry was a fiery Ministry I want to pick it up here Matthew 3:1 in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and he said repent ye for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand turn around amen for this is he that spoke by the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepar the way of the Lord make straight path make his paths straight amen the same John had his remnant of camel hair he he didn't go to Men's Warehouse did he and a leather girdle about his loins and his meat was Locust and wild honey he probably didn't hit the Texas Roadhouse then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the regions round about Jordan and were baptized of him in Jordan confessing their sins so you see he was turning many of them to Christ amen and then when when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees they came to the baptism Al also he said unto them why are you here why are you here oh ye Generation of Vipers who has warned you to flee from the Wrath that is to come he said bring forth therefore fruit meat for repentance there's got to be some sort of some sort of fruit that shows you're real you just can't say sorry you can't just say well I don't want to miss out I and I don't want to go to hell and I'm just no you got to thoroughly repent you got to have fruit meat for repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham amen and now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees therefore every tree that bringeth forth not good fruit is hewed down and cast in the fire now this is somebody that you don't want to go to church with and just to hear a good sermon to make you feel good am he said it like it was he said I indeed baptize you with water into repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I who shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire now I'm telling you today Saints our greatest desire should be to be filled with more of the Holy Ghost not be content with going to church not be content to saying I'm in the message not be content with just saying I know Jesus but to get so full of the Holy Ghost that our life displays it whose fan in his hand and he will thoroughly Purge his floor and gather his wheat to the Garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire amen now just like Elijah and Elisha Eliza's Ministry this John the Baptist it was fiery the Bible says the Lord went before him in the spirit and the power of Elias to turn the hearts of the Old Testament fathers to Christ and Christ led him to the New Birth you must be born again amen he prepared the way of the lord and there came a time when John's Ministry had to actually decrease said I must decrease he must increase amen now the five ministries of the spirit of Elijah Elisha um John the Baptist and now I want to speak on the fourth Ministry of Elijah yes sir there seems to be more scriptures for telling the fourth Ministry of johnen uh of the fourth Ministry than of John the Baptist but so many people see John the Baptist just because of what's written about him in the New Testament but there's so many things not spelled out in the Book of Revelations that's going to happen it doesn't mean it's not going to happen it just means it's not spelled out so let's take a look here at the first one and it's Malachi chapter 4 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven has that happened yet and all the proud ye and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch now that's that's a that's yet to come do you believe that but unto you that fear my name can you say Amen to that amen shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his rings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall now you know that this ministry that came was came with such a powerful Healing Ministry it really attracted the attention of the people amen so much healing was done in this ministry we might even say more more was done in this ministry of healing than any other Ministry than since the time of Christ verse three and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be what ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayeth the Lord of hosts well we know the Bible says that the Earth is going to burn it's going to burn it's I mean I believe it is going to burn everything he says remember ye the law of Moses which I command unto him in Horeb for all Israel which with the statutes and the judgments so God gave the Prophet The Commandments to give to the people just like God gives this Prophet The Commandments to the people can you say amen amen behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord well that couldn't have been John the Baptist we could if he would have said Dreadful it would been okay because when he came the first time he says I bring you great Good Tidings of of great Tidings of good Joy or something along those lines it was a great his first coming but it wasn't Dreadful there was nothing in that speech from the Angels about being Dreadful it is spread the good news a son is born a savior is here so it wasn't that Elijah It Was Elijah before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children the hearts of the children to their fathers lest you come and smite the Earth with a curse without getting into it this there's been a number scriptures in the Bible that's referring to do different time periods and I'm talking about even two or 3 th000 different years and Jesus spoke of him one himself so this is speaking of of of of first part of John the Baptist and also of the prophet in this age sir this is the last book in the Old Testament where God himself says that he's going to send a prophet future and the Elijah Ministry Prophet is to come on the scene right before the second coming of Christ because he said if he don't send him he's going to Smite the Earth with a curse his ministry happens before the wicked are burned up and before we walk upon the uh on on the ashes of of them and this fourth Ministry of Elijah has been often mistaken for the John the Baptist ministry unfortunately because of just not knowing all the scriptures no wonder Jesus said search the scriptures study be you know I'm I'm going say it's not important that you're all theologians but it's real important that you're serious about being in the place that God want want you to be so you can truly truly hear the truth so now Jesus talks about this Prophet I want to talk about that go with me if you would to Matthew chapter 17:9 this is after Jesus was transfigured before Peter James and John I'll tell you at this time they also saw Moses and Elias in verse three starting here in verse 9 and as they came down from the mountain Jesus Jesus charged him saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and his disciples asked him saying why then say that the scribes that Elias must first come does everybody understand that there's no mumble jumble in this question it's a it's straight out you know why do the scribes why are people saying that there's a prophet that's supposed to come first and Jesus answered them and said Elias truly shall first come and restore all things when he makes this statement John the Baptist is already beheaded he's already dead and he's making this statement that Elias shall first come and restore all things amen so they're the the the these uh uh these uh scribes were talking about the Elias that was to come before the second coming of Christ and Jesus saying he is going to come he's going to come and his job is to restore am John the Baptist didn't restore he didn't restore the word he didn't restore all things the Bible says that he didn't even do Miracles so he didn't restore the Miracles so Jesus spoke of the Prophet that came in this age I think this is beautiful it's right here in the word of God that this is not just a man and this ministry is so important why then say the scribes that Elias must first come because they were thinking that the ministry of Elijah had to come before the second coming it's in the last chapter of the Old Testament but they were referring to the fourth Ministry of the spirit of Elijah and we must understand that God uses this ministry five times Jesus refers back now to the third Ministry of the spirit of Elijah in the next verse verse 12 so he's talking about both of them but I say unto you that Elias is already come and they knew him not but they done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise should also the the son of man suffer them in other words John the Baptist got beheaded he got killed the son of man is also going to be killed because to be honest with you the children of the devil don't know who the children of God are don't there's no representation there they're blind look at verse 13 then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist understood there's two different ones now speak Peter speaking and I want to just zoom in on the the restoration this this Prophet that came in this age he's to restore the word that's why it's so important for us to get into the message and listen to the tapes don't depend on the preacher do not depend on the pastor do not depend on me do not even depend on the the other four-fold Ministry that sits that stands here yes God sent a prophet it is our job to listen to it amen unfortunately I think there's some laziness amongst us well I'm just I just I just know you know brother John he's just going to tell us the truth that has nothing to do God did not send me as Elijah the fourth Ministry to this age I'm just a I'm just a person but God sent this man with a message and it's up to all of us to get into it get serious with it because if we don't catch it we're going to miss it it doesn't matter if you receive me as your pastor this this ministry is so much higher and I'll say it like this you got to have a hunger for what God sent you you got to have a hunger for what God sent you amen Acts 3: 19 Peter speaking to the people at Solomon's porch he says repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and He Shall send Jesus Christ which is which before was preached unto you whom the Heaven Must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God has spoken by his mouth by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began in other words restitution had not happened when John the Baptist was there in fact Jesus the heavens was going to retain Jesus in other words he wasn't coming back again until there's a restitution and God sends a prophet with a word that restores the people back to the original faith that was once there so it's under the the fourth Ministry of the spirit of Elijah that the word of God is restored to the Gentiles and it's under the five the fifth Ministry of the spirit of Elijah that the Jews are restored to the word of God that Ministry won't help us but this ministry will help us and remember when the prophet wanted to go to the Jews right perform they'll believe they'll believe this but he was the wrong Prophet to them he was a prophet he had the gift he he knew that they would receive it but it wasn't the will of God Amen Revelations 10:7 very common for many of us but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel this is the seventh angel Messenger to the Church of leoda when he shall begin the sound the mystery of God should be finished if he declar to his servants the prophets so we see here that he had the ministry that brought conclusion to everything there's no more mystery there's no more confusion there's there's there's we know the right baptism we know the godhead we we we understand what happened in the Garden of Eden we know the Seven Seals we know the trumpets we know everything there's no more mystery I'll say it like this I am soad glad I never thought I was so smart that I had to prove everything and I'll tell you what happened this is this is the greatest thing get a revelation of who the prophet is and you'll never doubt anything he says but you miss that Revelation and you'll be dicting everything everything everybody says when you have a revelation of the ministry that God sent am then you just just eat the book you just eat it eat it eat it eat it and you become the book people look at your life and say you're different they're different it is true that we must identify this Prophet because if we don't then we can never identify the message that God sent us so we need to put a name to that Prophet we must identify who the prophet is and I I've always said this if William Brandon is not that Prophet to this age then tell me who is tell me who is show me that Ministry but too many people have acknowledged the prophet and I've never identified with the message in other words they feel safe being in a message church it's not the acknowledging of the messenger that makes us a bride it's receiving the message into our lives that vindicates our identity as his bride I hope you catch that when I see the blood I'll pass over you when I see the Life of Christ Living inside of you in this age overcoming this world that is the truth you've received the message I don't care how long you sit in a message Church it doesn't make you a message believer we've got to receive the message God didn't send a a a a prophet to just say oh look I sent a prophet we've got to receive the message of the Prophet we are believers we must be if we are believers we must be restored because that was the reason that God sent this this Prophet was to restore us to restore the word to our lives not so we can put a picture up of William brandom and say yeah he's the prophet no what the bride needs in this hour has been brought to us to the Elijah Ministry of William brandham of Malachi 45 and6 if people can make it in the Rapture in this hour without this message then tell me why God sent the message we need the message to make it yes sir brother baham said rapturing faith lies in those tapes in 1933 when brother Brandon was baptizing I believe the 17th person in the Ohio River a voice spoke from heaven and said as John the Baptist was sent to for on my first coming so shall you in your message forerun my second coming as elzer was sent to get a bride ready for Abraham's promised son Isaac so I believe that this message is sent to get a bride ready for the promised son Jesus Christ Amen brother brand had his own Mont carel sown in Chicago during the Chicago Ministerial Association when they came and they wanted to trap him there was a I don't know how many ministers there I would think that I I think there was a lot more than 450 Brother Bruce might remember L there was a lot and they came there and they wanted to challenge brother brandom on his Doctrine and the doctrine of baptism and the godhead and things like that but God had warned him just like he wared Elijah what was going to happen forewarned him and he and he began to tell Tommy Hicks who why don't you just go in there and you you take my spot he says oh no I can't do that he was trying to be sneaky with him that's right but brother Bram knew because God had showed him and so when he when he was when Tommy Hicks I believe it was introducing brother brandom to the podium says now many of you ministers you may not agree with brother brandom here but I'll tell you what he's Fearless that's and he walked up there and think about this he's standing in front of a group of people who in their heart were against him but he had no fear because when God is with you there's nothing to fear he had a perfect love for the word of God Amen cast out all fear he says I want one of you to come up with your Bible and prove one of my doctrines be to be wrong that's right I don't want your prayer books I don't want your man-made stuff come up with the Bible and show me where I'm wrong he said not one of them would move he says okay why don't you come up with a a group come up with your group your committee because maybe maybe you're just afraid to come by yourself and nobody would come that's right because they knew that God was with him finally he said then stay off my back if you don't believe it that's what he said you don't believe stay off my back if you don't want to believe the truth and you want to believe something different than the truth you go ahead but God sent me to get a bride praise God the the dead had been raised in brother brandom's Ministry no different in than in Elijah's numerous times the the dead had been been raised to life again many brother brandom showed the sign of a prophet he brought forth the word that brings us to a complete new birth right a lot of the churches out there they say I I I'm born again this is what you need to do be to be born again just put your name on the book just get baptized just do this just do that just speak in tongues and you got it boy or girl excuse me believer but brother Brandon brought the truth I'm so glad for this message Saints I would not be here today without the message of the hourl and God so arranged it that the message even though brother rand's gone the message is still recorded and we should be in it all the time because I know this that there's things in this message that I need yet to make it I'm not here telling you I've listened to every tape and I'll tell you if if I did listen to every tape three times I still believe there's something in the tape that I have to hear yet the thing is are we going to put our heart and put Elijah first you understand I'm saying the word of the Lord that came from Elijah and I love this because Elijah this Prophet never led us to himself ever you can't listen to a tape where he says look at me you you hear the message and you get done and he's pointing us to Jesus Christ how could you listen to that and say he's a false prophet you got people in this message that have such a spirit on them that say look at me look at me or they want you to follow them that's not the spirit of the Prophet that was not the spirit of the ministry Lord Lord help us it's not good enough to belong to a message church we we must receive the message inside of us it needs to become life it needs to change us if anyone doesn't have a revelation of this message we need to pray that God would give it to us pray for it God give me a revelation of this message if anyone's struggling with believing and a prophet to this generation we need to pray God reveal it to me because today we went over the scriptures we didn't do any quotes just scriptures you don't want to be on the fence with Elijah's fourth Ministry we got to get serious about it I believe we need it to make a Rapture all right my time is up but I just want to go over the last Ministry if I could so this is like bonus bonus time all right Revelations chapter 11 this is the fifth Ministry the Elijah Ministry to the Jews people to say that God doesn't have prophets in the New Testament and there in verse one and there was given me a re like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the Altar and then that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles in other words this is going to be for the Jews the holy city which shall tread under under 40 uh foot 40 and two months three and a half years and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand 203 score days clothed in sackcloth so they won't be looking real pretty these are the two olive trees the two candlesticks standing before God before the god of the earth and you if you want to look that up that's in Zechariah chap 4 veres 2 and 3 if you want to write it down verse five and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devour their enemies If any man will hurt them he must in the this manner be killed so we see the same same Elijah ministry here these have power to shut up Heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over the waters to turn them to blood and smite the Earth with all the plagues as of we see MO is there right as often as they will and when they shall have finished their testimony the Beast shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them God will allow them to get killed and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord was crucified yes sir and they of the people and and kindreds and tongues and Nations shall see their dead bodies there uh three days and a half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put into the grav can you imagine so much hate that they they won't even give them a proper burial and everybody and the whole world is going to see it every nation every tongue it it's just going to be all over the TV all over the phones everybody's going to see them it's it's going to be a reality and they that dwell upon the Earth shall rejoice over them and make Merry and show send gifts one to another because these two what prophets notice the word says prophets amen God has prophets amen these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the Earth and you know something if you ever come to church and you feel like you're tormented I want you to understand you're you know what you're doing you're recognizing an evil spirit on you look the word of God should never offend you the word of God comes to help us and understand that our flesh is always emnity with God always it's never going to say if you're looking for your flesh to to be happy then you're looking for a church for entertainment something that makes you feel good but that's not what these two men did they said it like it was and praise God for their Ministry because their Ministry brought out 144,000 Jews it it did but the rest of the world hated them the rest of the Jews hated them yes sir you thought they tormented and after 3 days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood on their feet and great fear fell upon all which saw them and they heard a great voice from Heaven saying unto them come up hither and they ascended up into the heavens and the cloud and their enemies beheld them they all saw them raise and then they all saw them going in they saw these two going to Rapture God is so awesome God has always got the final Cil always in that same hour there was a great earthquake and the 10th part of the city fell and the earthquake was SL were slained of men 7,000 The Remnant were frightened and gave glory to God Of Heaven the second wall is passed and behold the third wall cometh quickly amen God bless you let's Stand Together these are the five ministries of the spirit of Elijah we've had the privilege of being introduced to the fourth Elijah Ministry of Jesus Christ and he he like Paul did not shun to declare unto us the whole Council of God if you want to know more about God listen to the tapes you get a good understanding we were had at our last men's meeting we were with uh brother uh our our our brother Charlie here in the back and he told me in the men's meeting he told us all in the men's meeting he said you know when when I read the Bible I tell you it is it is really hard to be honest with you to understand some of these things in the Bible I says he says but when I go and I read that church age it just opens up to me and I can see things and tell what a testimony of the importance of the message of getting into the message because it opens the word to us it it speaks in a way that we can understand certain things he is God's voice to this age he's not just one of many God is not the author of confusion God sent this man with a Ministry to help us get ready for a Rapture I believe all Ministries that are connected uh to that same ministry will be preaching the same message I believe that with all my heart amen let's think I've got a re ration I've got a reation of [Music] predestination I've got a reation God is my father I know where I came from tells me where where I'm going and the gates of hell can never Prevail again still I've got a revelation of predestination I've got a revelation God is my father I know where I came from tells me where I'm going and the gates of hell can never Prevail against him oh I've got a revelation of predestination I've got a reation God is my father I know where I came from tells me where I'm going and the gates of hell can never Prevail against it amen how many's thankful for the Revelation that God has given you amen how many wants a greater revelation of this of this of this ministry that God has sent for all of us he sent it to all of us amen let's just bow our heart in prayer our heavenly father we come to you today thanking you that you loved us so much that you sent a prophet to help us surely you do nothing except you Reveal Your Secrets to your servants the prophets they being the sear they catching the mind of of you Lord now come down to our level and give us the word to us break it to us that we can see truly what you want from our lives Lord God we thank you today for intimate relationship with

we try to give it to them but Lord if you just lead us to just one one is worth 10,000 worlds Lord may you bless each one of us with a hunger to start feeding on it more yes and and may we be able to take this message Lord and live it in our homes live it at church live it in our jobs and and and and Inspire others to come in here a man that has told us all things Grant it Lord we commit ourselves
