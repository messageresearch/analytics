a little bit amen well we just have a just one request here from our sister kathleen i think she we've brought she's brought prayer for this lady before maureen she is 37 years old and has a four stage breast cancer and it has spread into her lungs she and her husband are have young children and they are christian and believing for a miracle iman we're all being tested you know one way or another we know that health seems to be as you get older health seems to be kind of always testing aches and pains but um just take it to the plead the blood amen it's all we can do as believers is trust in god um and he says it's by your faith that you are healed so we just believe that this morning if there'd be any manga one amongst us this morning that needs a touch from the lord lamb just uh plead that blood this morning as we go in prayer um i just also like to lift up our brother benjamin for complete healing amen that the lord was gracious found him uh opportunity to get surgery done and that the lord would completely heal him also for anybody else in india with this kovid there's always something whether it's covert or something else it's kind of masked but i truly believe that behind the mask is that you know the devil you know we want to just bring us down do whatever he can to uh just get you to lay back in this hour that we're living in amen also for israel also let's just remember the anniversary of d-day i know for how many know that but if you've ever watched the movie or watched anything presentation on d-day i mean these guys knew they had a slim chance but they fought that we might have freedom um some people take it for granted and christ fought for our freedom so we just go by faith be thankful for this morning amen uh let's just remember um let's just remember the tides in the offering let's remember all those that are working our brother stan brother john is working on the church anybody else i believe they got the carpet in it i think it's coming along great and i hope that it builds your anticipation that one day there'll be an announcement and it'll be that this is the last day here so i pray that uh we just keep moving forward in christ and um you just keep believing if there's something that you have in your heart that just believed for that's all we believe by faith amen let's just stand and let's just go together on one accord dear heavenly father lord as we come before you today lord god lord just pleading your blood this morning lord knowing that lord there's no other way to that cross lord but it's a bloody cross lord and we come this morning lord because we know that you paid the price lord you said it was a dawn lord at the cross lord and we accept that lord by faith lord god lord we're truly lord undone

in all things lord we give you praise and glory in the precious name of jesus christ amen may be seated amen hallelujah uh brother mark would you uh give that you want to stand up or come up here okay i just want to testify i was on a trip to north carolina a couple weeks ago and it was just such a beautiful time i've never had a vacation or experience something like that just to be it was such a beautiful time i didn't want to leave and get to go to berry coffees church as well what really challenged me is i was looking at the song leader he was he was in there already he's praying before it started just and another thing too he just he learned you know how to like sung in keys and it really challenged me to be a better song leader you know i'm a very good song leader and i just want to just grow as much as i can in the lord you know just seeing them being able to change in keys like seeing the key of g you know thinking faster and then other testimony as well as i was talking to him after service and he was just saying how he works two jobs and goes to school full time and he makes it to every service i was just like i was just really challenged by that it's no excuse you know when i just just seen this day and age i know the devil can make us have so many excuses but our host of duty is here at church lord wants you to be here no matter what excuse you have and i guess i understand if you're really sick yes but the devil likes to use other excuses in our lives work can't be excused you just got to do it because the lord the lord is going to say that that day that they have judgment well you have to do all his work you know i understand he's not because the lord the lord knows he has a perfect plan to vote for your life and one more thing uh when we're at lunch before we're leaving i was talking to this lady at lunch and she was and she lives in pittsburgh or i'm sorry butler and she was just saying how you know she she wants to do more for a church and she lives about three and a half hours away she looks up for the paul's church and she doesn't make it to every service but she just said and heart she wanted to do more and it just really just challenged me that she wants to do so much more for her church being that far away and you know who am i to do i should be so much more come so closer and then uh one last thing i'll stop talking and then as we were leaving uh and i was leaving from the gas station uh right right after the trip and she asked me to pray and i was beginning to cry and weep because i didn't want to leave i just love that time precious when brother brandon said uh back in the day he used to cry and leave when he'd leave one another at church i felt that and we could have that same exact thing in our church you know the same exact thing we can have we just have to gather as one be unified with the lord more right and i don't want this fire that the lord has given me to die i just began to thank the lord so much for that opportunity and i just want us to have that same experience we can have all that same exact experience we just got to just love one another more get in the spirit more and just just strive to press towards the mark and thank you guys for hearing me hey my mother amen hallelujah amen um well it's obvious that uh our brother's on fire it's been for a while and uh you know you know it's it's gonna be a revival let it start me right so um we all have the opportunity it always lies before us you know it's just whether how bad you want it and how much of it you want so uh thank you brother thank you um let's just continue that fire amen let it swell up in all of us amen hallelujah thank you um battle hymn of the republic amen my eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord he is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored he has loosed the faithful lightening of his terrible swift store his truth is marching on oh glory glory hallelujah glory glory hallelujah glory glory hallelujah his truth is marching on i have seen him in a watchers a hundred circling camps they have built him in an altar if the evening news are damp i can read his righteous sentence by then flaring laps his day is marching on oh glory glory hallelujah glory glory hallelujah glory glory hallelujah his truth is marching on he has sounded for the trumpet that shall never sound retreat he is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment [Music] our god is marching on oh glory glory hallelujah glory glory hallelujah o glory glory hallelujah his truth is marching on in the beauty of the lil jesus christ was born across the sea with the glory in his buzz and that transfigures you and me as he died to make them whole let us die to make them free well god is marching on oh glory glory hallelujah glory glory hallelujah o glory glory hallelujah his truth is marching on hallelujah hallelujah amen let's just stand as we get ready change your order of service amen amen let's just swing sing sweep over my soul amen how many wants god to sweep over their soul [Music] sweep over my soul sweep over my soul sweet spirit sweep over my soul my rest is complete while i sit at your feet sweet spirit sweep over my soul sweep over my soul sweep over my soul sweet spirit sweep over my soul my rest is complete while i sit at your feet sweet spirit sweep over my soul one more time sweep over my soul sweep over my soul sweet spirit sweep over my soul my rest is complete as sit at your feet sweet spirit sweep over my soul amen praise the lord everyone before you're you're seated i i wanted to show you a picture of the progress of brother ron let the cat out of the bag and no he really didn't most most everybody good to see brother tyler and sister brooke praise the lord just blesses me to see you um but as as most of you know that we got the carpet in into the the church and so we just got one picture that we wanted to show you that's all for now one pick because i hope nobody's been complaining that we're not there yet you know um but there's just one picture to kind of show how the progress that we're making so that right now and here's brother stan he's sitting on the job i came in i found him sitting on the job in there so we got a little ways to go but we're in the bathrooms now i want to show you this little this little clip on on the sanctuary where we spent honestly most of our time that's annie's room there we moved it for her that's the right there's the uh the cry room and you can't quite see the glass but it's uh it'll it'll be good it'll be fitting for us and yes i'm just like so happy for you like big time um amen well we're thankful to the lord for sure [Applause] we want to show a few pictures of um brother colin uh working for the lord working for souls extending the kingdom of god and so here's a a couple that he is sharing the plan of salvation and about baptism amen muddy waters of jordan maybe yeah but isn't that beautiful in the name of jesus there's one soul is worth ten thousand worlds whatever we've got to go through amen well god bless you turn with me if you would to the book of and let's continue to pray for our precious brother and all the missionaries i think it's harder now because they can't get away come to the states receive encouragement from the brothers here because so many brothers encouraged our brothers overseas and support so let's continue to pray for them it's harder for them and we want to continue to pray for our church because we used to just have um almost like almost too many missionaries coming through here we just never invited people because they just came honestly but now that the missionaries aren't here and people are not traveling with the culvert we really need to start looking to more evangelism to come into the church and and and be a part of this ministry amen amen so we want to pray for that and we're going to read just one verse and first john chapter four first john chapter four verse number four amen before we begin reading let's just look to the the author of this precious priceless book amen our heavenly father lord approaching you at this time we're as our brother ron said we're unworthy lord unworthy to approach you lord by your grace that we're even standing here today in your sanctuary lord we ask that you would cleanse me and wash me and prepare me set me aside for the service let me only speak those things which would be of you keep my mouth from saying anything that would not be of truth lord father i pray that you would bless the hearers of the word for they've come to hear from you i pray that you would bless each one with an ear to hear for lord that was requirement lord i pray that you bless each one with good ground that the word could fall on the good ground bring forth fruit lord pray that you would bless each of us that we'd mixed the word today with faith that it would profit our lives when we leave here today so lord we ask that you would just move in our midst may each one of us feel your presence and able to grow and take just something from this service that we might be better equipped to overcome the enemy we commit the service now to you and ask your blessings lord on the reading of the word in jesus christ's name we ask amen amen first john chapter 4 verse 4 ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world god bless you may be seated ear of god little children and you've overcome them who's them amen them are the spirits that are not of god it's the nature that is not of god and we all battle that which is not of god these spirits are not of god the spear these spirits that are not of god are greater than any human flesh they have the ability to overcome every human being but the children of god have overcome them because there is a god that lives inside of them that is greater than them greater is the god that lives in us through faith without the faith they can't get the job done because god don't do anything by faith we can't just say i believe i'm a child of god did you know as long as we're hanging around our flesh the spirits of the world are there too they don't leave they don't leave that realm that's where they live they live in that dimension and they are attracted to carnality like a magnet and that's why we're we've been told to get out of the flesh to get into the spirit get away from them the only hiding place greater than the spirits of this world is simply god's presence that's the only place the devils can't do any harm and when we're courageous enough to die out of our carnal nature we can't enter into the spirit but we're just not going to enter the spirit by just simply plopping in church we can overcome the enemy within we're not ignorant of the devil's devices we're overcomers we're discovering how to detect the enemy within us by accepting the truth that there is a law of sin that wars in our members we are in presently the greatest battle ever fought we're fighting against the greatest enemy we know which is our carnality our carnal nature gets in the way of any progress of our personal relationship with god we want to grow in christ we want to know christ more the only thing that stands in a way is our carnality the more we try the spirit that is speaking to us speaking to our minds the better will be able to detect them amen after we've detected our carnal nature we're learning to diffuse or dissolve the enemy within and we do that by humbling ourselves under the mighty hand of god that he won't have any ground to work through that he won't have he's like i don't have no armor i don't have nobody to work through what about those spirits that get cast out they go out looking for someone to dwell in because the devil can't do anything unless he's got a vessel to work in but if he comes back to your house and he finds it empty that spirit that you were dealing with that got cast out by the word of god at church one day amen he comes back and he sees that you have not filled that occupancy with the holy spirit he has the right to bring demons five times greater than him and enter back in so we need to humble ourselves the devil can't work through a humble person i remember brother johnson used to say a praying man a man that really really prays gets into the spirit you'll find that that man will be dead to himself and a dead man will never hurt you he's dead to himself but if you don't die out to yourself and that old nature can just spring up at any time and just as long as we walk around in the flesh we're walking with devils we don't know it we don't realize it but we are the word always detects and uncovers the greatest enemy the word will do that jesus the word made flesh uncovered brother peter's greatest enemy his selfish nature that savors the things of men and not be of god remember the word was standing right there with peter and showed him his greatest enemy and the word will always disarm the greatest enemy just like when the word defused peter's greatest enemy his carnal nature when jesus told him to just deny yourself peter pick up the father's will and start following he told them what to do to defuse the enemy to disarm them and this morning we want to destroy our greatest enemy from within and the word of god will do it remember when the devil came to jesus and he appealed to his flesh that's what he did he was hungry been fasting the devil wanted jesus to focus on using god's word for his body to prove his identity that's right if thou be the son of god command these stones to be made bread just use the word for your body but jesus detected the enemy through a physical need this hunger that he was having in his body and jesus disarmed the devil by denying what his own flesh because he wanted food the bible says he was hungry he disarmed the devil by not giving them what his flesh wanted jesus took away his weapon when he answered and said in matthew chapter 4 verse 4 it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god we don't pick and choose what part of god's word we want and what part we don't we must live by every word of god because when we get to heaven every word of god will be there don't pick and choose the devil tried another tactic you know if he can't get you in the first one he'll try another one next the devil wanted jesus to focus on using god's word and power for a personal miracle come on we all want miracles right and by doing this miracle it would prove his identity and his connection with god if thou be the son of god cast these cast thyself down for it is written notice they were both saying the devil and god was saying it is written both of these spirits use the word satan is quoting the bible he says he shall give his angels charged concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up let's say lester any time thou dash thy foot against a stone by doing this miracle it's going to prove you're connected with god we all want to prove that we're connected to god sometimes we spend too much time trying to prove to somebody that we're connected to god notice jesus detected the enemy through the devil's temptation by trying to get jesus to control his own will over the father's will and it's the word of god just do it then jesus disarmed the devil by denying his flesh from any self-will and said it is written thou shall not tempt the lord thy god even jesus had to deny his will had to deny his flesh the devil was coming and dealing with him using god's promise to prove some identity is always tempting the lord brother branham said god doesn't clown around for anybody jesus was going through a spiritual battle with the devil just like we all do and the third thing the devil tried to do was to get jesus to imagine all sorts of glory the glory of man the glory of all the kingdoms just imagine you having this glory but jesus detected the enemy right away speaking to him again he tried the spirit he knew it was the devil we've got to know what spirit is speaking to our heads we can't just go through life just oblivious and not knowing what's going on we've got to know the enemy i want you to notice something i've never seen before the first two temptations the devil wanted jesus to use the power of god to get what his flesh wanted and this third temptation he wanted jesus to use the devil's power to get what his flesh wanted all these things the devil said i will give thee if thou will fall down and worship me he'll do whatever he can if he can't get you to use to use god's word for your flesh well then he'll try to give you something the easier way because see he was going to inherit the get the keys back but see wouldn't it what's easier die on the cross and suffer or just bow down say devil it's you're okay i bout to i bow my will to yours that's a lot easier than having to suffer and we and the devil comes to us all the time and gets us to bow before him it should be getting easier for all of us to detect the enemy that's speaking to us that's what this has been about jesus not only defused the devil but he destroyed his present power over him when he said get thee hand satan for it is written thou shall worship the lord thy god and him alone only shall thou serve he destroyed the present power over satan at that point get thee behind me boom gone the word of god casted in the mouth destroyed him now don't understand the devil is uh alive with his bag of tricks he's not to be annihilated until it's all over but he will be annihilated eventually but he is around but you can destroy him for the present moment around you that's what this is about you don't have to be subject to him you can say also get thee hence satan for it is written what is it written greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world i'm not living for the world am i not living for my will my flesh my desires i i'm born again to the will of god [Music] jesus stayed with the word he overcame the devil with manifesting the word he just didn't quote the word just didn't quote the the messenger he lived the word he lived what he said you know the devil is not scared of the word being quoted he quotes it himself he's scared of someone that's manifesting it the word of god is the only thing that can that the devil can't handle he can't handle the word of god because when god made satan made lucifer he made him just underneath him all the other angels everything else was underneath him think about that and when the word of god becomes manifest it is written i'm here to cast you out satan can't handle that he can handle john martin real easy because john martin is just flesh and blood but if the word of god gets a hold inside john martin's life that word can cast out satan but john martin can't the bible says greater is he that's in john martin than he that's in john martin's nature verse 11 then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him the devil left him power to destroy the works of the devil jesus took charge of the conversation that was happening in his mind think about this he wasn't it wasn't just a physical thing that was there how can you show all the kingdoms of the world that never came yet right not past a lot of them were burnt blown up this is something that was happening in his mind the same thing that you and i battle you've got to take charge of what's happening here you can't allow things to be just going on in there and think it's no big deal they're going to bring you down [Music] it's a take charge situation if you want to destroy the enemy within you've got to take charge of the conversation of the thoughts that's happening inside your mind if you don't tell the devil to leave he won't he'll just stay right there and keep feeding you if you don't tell him to get the hint satan he won't if you don't tell him to get behind me satan he won't he stays where he can to do his mischief what did jesus say to the devil while he was trying to teach peter how to live a surrendered life he said get thee behind me satan at the time that he was trying to teach peter how to live a surrendered life just deny yourself give up your will and do the father's will follow me he said get thee behind me saying thou art an offense to me for thou savers not the things that be of god but the things that be of the flesh you destroy the enemy within by manifesting christ the word for the hour and wherever you're at whatever job you're on whatever place whatever car whatever home you take the word for that hour for that moment and that will destroy the enemy you can't take church with you you can't take this time with you but you can take the god that's here with you it takes faith it takes faith it takes a strong hand of faith to take the sword of the word and cut the devil get out of here to destroy him you can't i wish nobody knows what i'm going through he understands nobody cares nobody's helping me [Music] the scripture said greater is he that's in me than he that's in that carnal nature now as long as you believe you can't you can't but when you become one with the word and just say what the word says regardless of how you feel what you think what you've been through is what you're becoming the word of god made flesh again detect disarm and destroy the enemy within detect disarm and destroy that's it don't play around don't give him a chance to come in don't open that door don't say that it sounds pretty interesting to me i'd like to have it you be spiritual enough to be a peacemaker when you get better at detecting disarming and destroying the enemy within yourself you will be able to help others god can take a man who can't even detect his own spirit used by the devil to cause all sorts of discord and make a peacemaker out of him i love the word blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god our god can take and change the nature of a man god can take a man who don't know how to detect his own greatest enemy used by the devil to unravel relationships and make a restore out of him galatians chapter 6 verse 1 brethren if a brother be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness consider yourself lest thou also be tempted you ever just didn't want to listen to the word because it was presented to you in such a way that it offended you amen amen bear ye one another's burdens and soul fulfill the law of christ now we're talking about when you're able to detect your own greatest enemy you bring your vessel under subjection now god can use you to fulfill the law of christ amen to bear one another's burns for if a man thinks that he doesn't have to do that for if a man thinks he doesn't have to do that in other words he thinks he's something greater than having to submit to bear in one another's burdens when he is nothing he deceives himself but our god he's able to take our nature and make him a restorer amen god can take a man who wanted to promote his own burden his own will his own ministry and give him a ministry of reconciliation to bear other people's burdens god can take a man who by nature had been fulfilling the desires of the flesh the laws of nature and give him a new birth amen with a a a new nature uh a a new law to fulfill the law of christ and that is to love one another god can take a man whose heart's been inhabited by hate by jealousy by selfishness and turn around until it becomes the law of god where he's fulfilling just with one word loving his neighbor as himself that's what god can do god can take a man and teach him how to detect disarm and destroy the enemy and when he can a man can do that for himself he'll know how to help somebody be an overcomer first cast out the beam that is in nine oh nine or you'll not be able to see clearly how to cast the moat out of thy brother's eye jesus told us what's first and what second amendment a lot of time we want god we want god's strength his power we want his blessings but we don't want to submit first is humility submit then god seek ye first the kingdom and then other things be added god is the god of order amen this victory of overcoming the devil doesn't happen on its own it doesn't happen just because you've been a christian ex long calvary was a gift but overcoming the enemy within is not a gift it cannot it will not happen on its own we've got to go out there and face the giants and overcome them well it has to be through christ we can't do it we we can't we can't overcome them how many times do we hear i just i just can't do that you know we make up excuses i can't do this i can't overcome i can't i can't i can they can't we can't by ourselves look at the the the the spies that came back 10 of them had the testimony that the word of god was true it was a land that falls with milk and honey but they said i can't to the sense that they said they couldn't they couldn't to the two that said i can they believe the word of god that god made the promise because humanly possible there's no way that little david's going to be goliath there's no way that these little children of israel are going to beat these giants out of the land it would have to take god so when you realize that you're on god's side that the word is with you he promised it to you greater is something in you than what you are then you can overcome the things of the flesh you can overcome the giants in your life you know a lot of times we walk through life and we don't want to deal with those giants we want to act like we don't got them like the pharisees well i don't got that many problems in fact i do this and this and this and this i don't talk about giants it makes me feel bad you're never going to overcome them like that gotta call it out we've got to go out and face the giants in our life brother adam said character is not a gift it's a victory you can't have a victory without a battle so we must fight the good fight of faith lay hold of what a complete nature change that's what that means lay hold if i say lay hold of eternal life everybody's going to say i already got it i already laid hold of it i already got it i'm already a believer lay hold of a complete nature change a complete new birth where all things are of god amen that's what you're fighting for you're not fighting to say well i'm going to prove to you i'm a child of god i'm in the body i'm in the message i'm bright what good is that fight for a nature change fight about to lay down your life to turn the cheek the golden second mile to prove with your life that you're manifested word of god in the flesh again it's about detecting disarming and destroying the enemy within not about proving out here to anybody remember james chapter four verses one through four teaches to detect the enemy within when you get time to read it we we've gone through this in the past verse five clearly identifies the nature of our greatest enemy amen do you think that the scripture sayeth in vain the scripture that dwelt in us it lusteth to envy oh not mine brother john no no i'm a real spiritual person that spirit that dwells in us it lusteth to envy in other words it wants it wants endlessly it wants you get up and it wants it doesn't stop wanting well at least my answer is not as bad as yours brother john carnality then james teaches us to disarm the enemy within by disarming our pride our proud spirit our carnal nature if we want to receive power to overcome we must humbly submit to god the lord is my shepherd i shall not want we must be willing to face this is not correct verse 6 but he giveth more grace he giveth more grace to disarm that spirit that lusteth that want he gives more grace wherefore he says god resists that proud spirit but he giveth grace to disarm that spirit unto a humble person a person exercising that's living out humility what a what a privilege it is to live out and manifest humility it's not about well it's i'm i'm humble inside you just don't see it well if you don't see it the devil ain't scared of it because it's not the word made flesh it's the word thought jesus i know i know but who are you you've got to manifest that word manifest the life of christ manifested nature change that's why we should be interested and really come to church and get in our nature change really find out where we're at with god where we can go to the second level how we can get to becoming the statue of a perfect man not be satisfied with just making it to church but becoming the church to the world verse 7 submit yourselves therefore to god submit yourself therefore resist the devil and he will flee from you you will destroy the works of the devil just like jesus did amen he submitted to the father's will he didn't say this is a pretty good idea yeah everybody don't know if i just do this miracle no he submitted and i'll tell you the devil is real tricky we need to stay humble and say lord is that you we need to be humble and try the spirits instead of just thinking oh everything i think is right just detect disarm the enemy with humbly submitting to god amen i could be wrong i could be wrong i've been wrong enough to know that it was right before it happened so i if i just go off of history if i think i'm right it's a good chance i'm wrong but if i could be wrong now there's the fear of god i i have a better chance that god will correct me we need faith to resist the devil because remember the devil's coming and he's coming with a boo in your life he's coming with a boo and usually when he booze i mean i don't know how many times i just my wife's there doing her laundry i'm just i'm going to wait for her to turn around because i don't want to scare her i'm just in there waiting she turns around the devil's there just waiting to boo you and he is gonna boo you you need faith submit to god and then you can have faith you can't have faith without submitting to god it's like taking some ouija board or you know taking taking the word that you don't believe in you know shining something in front of the devil's face it don't work humbly submitting yourself to god proves that you have faith in god because it takes faith to submit to god and say i'm trusting you lord right now things don't look real good but i'm trusting you brother branham said in the message if god be with us then where's all the miracles he said the devil can't set a foot on you to hurt you until first you get away from god now i want you to think about that you and your relationship with god how close is it are you barely just hanging on by a thread or are you praying in the spirit getting into the word letting the message begin to build up muscles of faith in your life because the devil can't set a foot on you to hurt you until you first get away from god you get away from god god ain't getting away from you you're getting away from god you must first remember that brother branham said check when anything happens see if you're in the faith or not and see if you're right up to the place with god god is always calling us up to the place he's not calling us hey just relax take the lazy boy away take it easy you've had such a hard trial so is the whole world nobody's wanted this covered 19 thing he said then remember that the devil can't do you no harm you're in christ when you know that you have humbly submitted to god the devil can't touch you he cannot touch you he cannot lay a hand on you he can't do anything when you're submitted to the word and what is the word i'm talking about i'm talking about when god came to your heart and he spoke something to you in a service that is god coming to you when you submit to that the devil can't do anything but you walk out with ninety percent of the word there's ten percent that you haven't taken i'm telling you you cannot say to the devil it is written anymore because man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen we need the whole word the bride the bride's food is the word of god amen you're going to act like an eagle that just yeah i i don't really you know need all of it we need the whole word of god we cannot receive the lord without faith i'm talking about more of the lord doubt and self-pride will actually disarm us but humility will disarm the devil because he doesn't have anything to work through now humility will not only disarm the devil but it will give more grace to destroy him in other words i'm sick of this in my home i'm sick of having to go get drank through the mud over and over and over and have no joy have no peace have no love don't want to reach out for anybody don't got time for god you can destroy that how many submit to the word more grace for more faith in the word of god it will destroy the devil how many more want more grace humbly submit to the word it will produce faith that's what produces faith because we all hear the word right the word that they heard did not profit them not being mixed with faith in other words i don't really have to do that instead of that's for me it's for me yes i want to be healed yes i want joy yes i want peace yes i want love i want all these blessings of god but what good is any of it if i'm not submitted to god is he going to take me for his little bride nobody wants to be married to a bride who's not submitted so why focus on all the wants that we could get the blessings of god when really all god wants is just one man in his hand that he could lead and guide wherever he chooses to don't you want to be that ephesians chapter 2 verse 8 for by grace are you saved through faith for by grace are you saved through faith and that and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god it's not of works lest any human being should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus onto good works which god have before ordained that we should walk in them i want to make i feel two powerful statements our first birth created us unto the works of the devil which are selfish works driven by selfish motives a selfish nature but our second birth will destroy those selfish works and create within us an unselfish behavior of living for others now you tell me what you're created unto when jesus christ came to earth he was manifested god in the flesh he was the manifestation of god in the flesh that's what he was at one time or another every person has wondered what god is really like what's his nature like brother branham tell us if you want to know who god really is look at jesus christ you will know exactly who god is his nature his makeup how he handles things how how uh funny loafy dophy uh serious you'll know exactly how god acts when you look at jesus christ you'll see the compassion of god through jesus christ you'll see the importance of staying with the word of dealing with the devil you'll see god through jesus christ because he was god manifested in the flesh now did not the angel of the lord tell brother branham that jehovah the old testament was jesus of the new. did not jesus tell philip philip have i not been so long with you when you've seen me you've seen the father the word manifested well i just want you to know you you are deathly getting you are blessed because there's like three pages of notes with nothing written on there you know when your friends tell them you ever print something and then pages come out with it i don't want you to really think you're getting out early whatever jesus did god did jesus said i do nothing except the father shows me first i do not the works of my father i do the works i'm sorry i do not my own works but i do the works of my father and if i do not my father's works then don't believe me these are just words that jesus spoke jesus came to earth with a purpose and it was to carry out the father's will the father's eternal purpose that was that was his purpose for god's soul love the world saint john 3 16 though for god so loved mankind that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life of course there's a lot of people that believe in him are going to perish because they do not believe as the scripture have said if you believe on him as the scripture said out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water we've got to believe not like the devils believe the devils believe on them devils testify a lot more than people say there's no god there's a god you know there wouldn't be so much chaos in the world you've got every kind of thought process out there in the very same chapter that he the bible says for god so loved the world that he gave the very same chapter jesus said you must be born again so calvary didn't give you the new birth it paid the price of our sinful nature but we still have to go out and hunt the holy ghost because even as as jesus resurrected from the dead that spirit didn't come about on everybody and god is no respecter persons he ain't going to pick and choose who he's going to put his spirit on you've got to go hunt you got to seek it you got to knock you got to ask and if you do he promised to give you the holy ghost the nature of god and it will change us chapter 10 verse 17 therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it up again the father loved his son because he was fulfilling the father's purpose the giving of himself to others think about that you want god to love you lay down your life for others lay down your life no god still loves yes he loves everybody listen every one of you wants something at one time or another from your wife or your husband and when you want something bad enough you're willing to give a little bit more is it wrong for our creator to want us to love is it wrong for our creator for him to want us to lay down our life is that wrong no because he created us it should be our desire to want to please him moses brother it was not moses in the wilderness that was loving the people that's good brother branham taught us it was christ in moses so when you're laying down your life for somebody it's not you [Music] it's christ in you well i don't like doing it because they just throw it back in my face brother john where's the criteria they've thrown it back in jesus's face they were making it bleed all the way to calvary but he still had father forgive him they don't know what they're doing all you need is the spirit of christ and you that much where you can say father forgive they don't know what they're doing lay down your life for them let them see christ manifest in the face or else what we have is our independent church this is what we believe in our church and we all got churches right you are a church you're all representing something you're either representing this message representing christ you resent representing your own independent church lay down your life for others sometimes we forget our purpose on earth matthew chapter 20 verse 28 even as the son of man came not to minister on to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many jesus always kept the fathers eternal purpose in view in his vision why he got up in the morning what he was set out to do you know we the devil has got us so programmed that all we need to do is fit jesus in today somewhere just fit them in we don't need the vision the the vision of others without a vision of others they're going to perish well that's not my calling well what is your calling my calling is the easy way the easy way the broad way the way that everybody wants to go nobody wants to die out how are we going to overcome the devil in our life how are we going to destroy him i'll tell you this is my advice to you you that are struggling say amen to the word the devil will hate it he'll stay as long as you allow him when you get serious and you want him out you want to become all that christ has called you to become then stand with the word say amen to the word so be it amen this is this word is not being preached to make you feel bad this word is being preached to to dispose the devil to uncover the devil to let him to let you see what's happening really in your life it was giving of his life that actually destroyed the power of satan think about that it was the the purpose of fulfilling his life that destroyed the devil and the devil didn't even know it is what the bible says they would have never crucified him they knew and the key is for us the same thing it wasn't the birth of christ it was the death that brought the victory the thing is we couldn't have death if there was no birth but the sacrifice was not the birth it was the death but we rejoice in the birth so because there was a death the problem is everybody that's carnal rejoices in the birth and they don't think about death like some santa claus here he is they don't feel the tears of suffering and and and i'm in debt to you lord in order for jesus to have given his life he first had to overcome his own will think about how hard this was not my will but thy will be done he manifested character when he gave up his will philippians chapter 2 verse 8 and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore god also highly exalted him and gave him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven things in earth and things under the earth and that that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father it's the very same thing for us if we follow his footsteps we too surrender our life become obedient humble ourselves become obedient unto death first peter chapter 5 verse 6 says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may what exalt you did he not exalt jesus we follow his footsteps then we will be exalted in due time the way up is down the way to victory is humility ain't climbing over something you know the world is dog-eat-dog prove who's better than who we must overcome our will that's what's standing in a way we must overcome that thing that's keeping us from moving forward with christ we think we're going to just kind of i'm sorry the righteous scarcely made it where does that put me i don't have any room to take it easy it's through surrendering through the surrendering of jesus's will to the obedience of the father's will at calvary that actually destroyed the power of satan that he had over mankind i'm thankful that he gave up his will i'm thankful that he surrendered his will he just didn't he just didn't say he didn't walk around and say well you know what i don't really have to do anything because john baptized me i'm already baptized it fulfilled all righteousness is exactly what needed to be done i don't need to do anything else no he had to surrender his will after he got baptized come on now [Music] if you're interested in in your relationship growing it ain't going to grow outside of you giving up your will there ain't there ain't room in heaven for two wills friend that's why satan got kicked out we either surrender to god's will or we're not we're not going to get anywhere not going to get where we want to get to anyways when god spoke to the most subtle beast in the garden god also prophesied at calvary of calvary in genesis chapter 3 verse 15 and i will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel now notice the seed didn't die just the head got bruised calvary gave a deadly blow to the actual power that satan had he bruised his head in satan has no power over you i want you to listen to what i'm saying satan has no power over you now unless you think he does if you think you have to listen to him then he's deceived you and the word of god is here to remind us that we don't have to listen to him we don't have to jesus his own words were that he was a liar from the beginning he lies to us and he's he's a good he's good at it he points to all of our mistakes all of our problems every issue that we've ever done and says there's the proof but he's still a liar he never points us to the end he never points us that we're going to be like him in the end he never points us to that he's going to finish the work that he started in us doesn't point us to perfection he just points us to our past mistakes because he wants to keep us down [Music] he's a liar satan has no power over you unless you believe he does at one time he did he held the keys of death and a corrupt nature over mankind but calvary paid the price for our freedom jesus took back the keys that satan took he took him actually brother and said unlawfully brother branham said in revelate or jesus said in revelations chapter 1 verse 18 i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore and have the keys of hell and of death and you're going to tell me that satan has one over you unless you believe it jesus said in john 8 36 if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed you know brother branham did not have any power of his own no power of his own the angel of the lord told brother branham if you can get the people to believe not even cancer will stand before your prayer all his job was is to let the people know that the devil has deceived them and that you can have whatever you believe jesus is the same yesterday today and forever and and god has broke the powers of satan to get the people to believe in the word to believe in jesus christ that's what his job was that's what our job is to go out paul did not have any power of his own his job was to get the people to believe that jesus had already done the work in acts chapter 26 he's testifying the king agrippa and in verse 15 he said talking about his testimony he spoke on the on the road to damascus he said who art thou lord introduction to jesus christ and he said i'm jesus whom you're persecuting you think you're doing me a work you think you're doing me what i want you to do but you don't even know me you don't even know my nature you don't know i'm meek hallelujah lowly in heart take my yoke upon you learn of me you want rest for your soul it's rest it's right you know you're in rest when you can get beat shipwrecked stoned and you still have compassion on the people that are doing it he wasn't in any rest trying to destroy all the christians look what jesus said but arise and stand upon thy feet i have appeared unto thee for this purpose notice it's attached to god's eternal purpose to make them minister and to witness both of these things which thou has seen of those things which i will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now and i send thee to open their eyes to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan onto god that there may be forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith that is in me his job was to turn the eyes of the people away from darkness to the light if you can get the people to believe paul didn't have any power on his own it was the name of jesus same power you have same authority you have over the devil you can destroy the enemy within with the name of jesus same power well brother john i tried it just submit more to god then submit more to god build your faith up to believe that that word is really in you because it's the word of god manifest in the flesh that will destroy the devil brother branham said in the message that is i be not afraid he said if he was standing here tonight with this suit on that he gave me that beautiful he could not heal you jesus standing here could not heal you if you come and begged him and pleaded to him he cannot do what he's already done he cannot do what he's already done he's waiting for us to believe just believe in him his word that's never failed can't fail i'm afraid john i'm afraid to get out there i'm afraid to go on that limb tell the enemy to get out of you cast them out get behind me saying destroy it the way that we become the word is believe we're not going to become the word through church attendance by how long we're in the message by works we become the word by submitting to the word the only way we can become the word we need to get serious about this more serious than we've ever been brother brahms said he cannot do what he's already done he left it up to you on the basis of your faith he cannot save you against your own will cannot save you against your own way he says you're a free more agent you can turn it down or you can accept it he said do you clearly understand that he cannot hear you he cannot heal you against your will he cannot save you against your will but he can make himself known in his promises he said then you accept it upon those bases god spoke the word you believe it it comes to pass god is hid in simplicity it's not complex it does not do my feelings my emotions how good the service was how much the spirit flowed what the message was it doesn't matter who's preaching it matters that you love the word you believe the word you're submitted to the word you become the word god can't god is not going to force his word on anybody you're either in love with it or you're not fall in love with the word of god by faith in god we can destroy the enemy we can overcome and have the victory but it has to be through faith we need to stop listening to the devil up here he says you dirty no good for nothing you're just a hypocrite on the basis of these 17 things that you did this week you need to stop listening that if you're going to go any further with god you need to cast that out that has nothing to do with what you will become if you let that stand in the way that's always going to be there because that's the same thing he used the week before and the week before and the month before and the year before you got to stop the cycle i'm a new creation i'm a new creature in christ old things are being passed away behold all things are becoming god's way just tell the devil the devil that's been bothering you he's a liar get behind me that's all you got to tell them first john chapter 3 verse 8 for this purpose for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil now the whole world that we know of everywhere you look every news that you hear practically you're seeing the works of the devil everybody just conning lying get to just get on top of somebody get further ahead get rich get this get that so what does this verse really mean because jesus was manifested the son of god was manifested but things are still happening today but are they happening to the believer are they happening to the believer that believes the word of god so much that christ comes manifested inside of them we know calvary what the job that it did but now brother bryan says it's up to the individual if you want to destroy the works of the devil in your life because that's what this series is about manifest the word there's no other way we've got to get away from that thinking about just using the name of jesus to cast some devil out and you're not even interested in your life changing that's a warp sense of thinking it was the complete manifestation of god in flesh that destroyed satan's hold over the human race that before calvary there was no chance of a nature being changed no chance for the holy ghost to come on somebody he manifested a surrendered life unto death even the death of the cross and by that supreme sacrifice god took away the keys from the devil he no longer has any say so over you so stop listening to him don't listen anymore he's still got a bag of tricks he's still doing his magic god didn't take the devil away we're still dealing with the enemy with him that god has given every man and woman the same opportunity to overcome the devil man can't do it by himself he can't overcome by himself he needs god in him greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world i can't do all things through christ who strengtheneth me it's not through your strength right you know how our strength goes like the mountains look at me on something next moment oh my god what's going on through christ jesus said just go ahead my son jason use my name cast out any demon you want he gave us his name and it's through that name that devils are cast out jesus said satan can't cast out satan the kingdom would be divided well he's not here in his corporate fresh to cast that demon out of you but you can still use his name you can still have faith in the name of jesus to take care of any demon you want and you know what i understand that other people got problems and you want to pray for them and you want to cast the devil out i just think that's wonderful don't you stop doing that but this series is about the greatest enemy you have we need to get serious about casting the enemy out this is all about growing our relationship with christ it's all about getting ready to meet him his bride have his wife have made herself ready what did she do she she took her husband's name and said get off me satan i belong to jesus he has power over you he left his name behind the body's gone but his spirit is here demons have to flee at that name they are cast out don't you just want to cast a devil out of you that's a right spirit by the way i know when we're having an argument with somebody we want to cast it out of them problem is you don't recognize the enemy within because if you recognize that enemy you'll have compassion on them amen jesus said be of good cheer i have overcome you had a problem don't worry about it be of good chair i've overcome well that's him that's him he over okay what about me well if that same spirit that was in christ dwells in you it'll quicken your body that devil will have to leave because he can't stand the presence of the holy ghost so we can be of good tear we can actually be happy we can actually sit in church listen to this sermon and smile john chapter 16 verse 33 these things have spoken unto you that you might have peace in the world you're going to have problems but be of good cheer i have overcome the world now did jesus have a hard time with the things of the world do you remember where he's like struggling with some carnal things of the world did he want to be some great politician or something no what did he overcome he defeated satan's offer to use his own will so the thing you have to overcome is your own will it's your greatest enemy it's standing in the way brother i'm said of god's progress i'll say it stand in the way of your relate our relationship with christ for this purpose the son of god was manifested he might destroy the works of the devil we must submit to god let the word become manifested it's real simple it's real real simple whatever the word tells you to do just do it does does the word go around robin banks don't rub a bank if you rob banks does the word uh uh hit people in the face don't need people in the face you're manifesting the word does the words swear cuss take drugs does the word not care about others that's gotta hit home i know you don't rob banks but are you living for yourself because that's not the word that's not the word either i think we need to cast out that selfish nature use the name of jesus all things are god that's what the new creature is look at lucifer god gave him power and he ended up using it for himself his own reputation he ended up disrespecting god and he even manipulated other people away from god the prophet concluded that any kind of power without character was satanic so do you want power to do what you want because that's exactly what satan offered jesus power to do what he wanted you might call it oh it's liberty in jesus right no liberty in jesus is to do his will don't let the devil preach to you let the holy ghost preach to you god wants to give you all the power you want he wants you to surrender all of your selfish carnal nature and everything that's against god amen first first john chapter four verse one beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirit whether they are of god because many false prophets those are those spirits that speak to your head i've i've gone out into the world we all hear them every day they come speak to us hereby you know the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come into your flesh is of god if you're manifesting the word if the spirit that's speaking you is causing you to live the word you know that what you just heard is from god you know we we are not mr and mrs discerners the word is a discerner not john martin you know we might have some sort of gift that god will use periodically but don't mistake that for walking around and think you know everything the word is a discerner we're we're told to try the spirit and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ has come into christ it's not of god if the word is not manifesting it's not of god this is the spirit of the antichrist in other words he's just to hear but not a doer of the word where have you heard coming even now already it's in the world yeah i was born with that nature we all lied not being honest we still lie right it's true it's true i know brother john but it's not like i used to the word is the only thing that does not lie and you can have confidence in the word ye our god little children you have overcome them those spirits that are not of god because greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world greater greater do you believe that it's all based on faith you're either a joshua and caleb or you're one of the other 10 spies that came to church spy out the land okay that's a good service yeah that's it's really full of milk and honey here's a really good one but do you believe you can take care of those giants in your life first john chapter five verse four no i got two more scriptures but i first want to go to revelations chapter 12 verse 11. in case you're you're writing it down revelation chapter 12 verse 11 and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb okay this is god's sacrifice at calvary we can't go anywhere without the blood and by the word of their testimony their testimony matches the word they believed they really believed that greater was god inside of them that he that was in the world that's their testimony and they love not their lives unto death in other words they surrendered their will to god this is the only way we're going to overcome the devil we may get everywhere else we want to get to in life without that but you will never overcome the devil without this your testimony needs to match the word you need to believe that there's a god greater in you that can handle your nature and you need to stick with your first testimony they love not their lives until the next revival to that special service to that one time i got prayed for to the one time i went to unto death you've got to believe it you got to believe it last last one first john chapter 5 verse 4 are you more than able to take the land first john chapter 5 verse 4 for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world because the overcomer is manifesting through the new birth right he's born of god and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen faith do you believe that greater is he that's in you if you don't believe it if you just believe he's greater but you don't believe he's got that power inside of you to overcome your flesh you can't overcome can't heal you can't save you can't do anything without faith you've got to believe we're all saved here every one of us has been healed at one time or another amen that's right god has shown his power in so many ways now it's up to you to get serious about what god's really interested in he wants his bride ready we can't sit there and just well the five-fold ministry just needs to do it no you need to take what the fivefold ministry has given you start doing it you should be able to come into church and start saying i listen to this tape i watched this i came to church this is happening in my life i'm manifesting it that's what should be happening don't wait don't wait don't wait start believing more than you have been believing so sorry this just got a lot of stuff today this is the conclusion of the series and and and there are so many things that i didn't share i didn't print them to read them to talk about them but i guarantee if you go start reading the bible and you're serious about them god will continue to show you things this quote part of this quote was given to me by my daughter ann last wednesday after service i read the first verse that was it until 9 30 this morning sorry anne but i get so many texts and so many things i just can't hardly keep up with them my brother brandon said in the message expectations he says but now miss doe here's your here's your name on it somebody sent them to you they're yours but he will do everything he can to make you take them say like a box of snakes the enemy but in one sense they're yours in another sense they're not they're not yours till you sign for it and we're just talking about the devil who lies to us but if you refuse to sign for them he has to take them back to the express agent he has to send them back to one that sent them he says don't you sign for nothing the devil brought he says refuse to have it don't have it no sir the devil put that affliction the devil put that disease there just refuse to see it just say no sir i won't sign for it i won't testify for nothing you said i will testify by his stripes i'm healed rather he will take it back oh yes yes but i know but here it is oh sure the snakes are there too your name is penned on them he might mark you for a death with a cancer with anything else he says but you refuse it by his stripes i'm here did not you do this yep but i'm refusing it that's not that's not who i want to be anymore brother ben says testify means the same thing if i testify in court something other i've got to say the same thing that i seen and testify means the same thing that god said and i've got to say the same thing he said remember their testimony was god's testimony right by his stripes i am healed they overcame the devil by the word of their testimony and i believe it amen i will tell you listen to this children john said children creator is he that's in you brother brandon saying listen children the word of god will defeat satan anywhere any place on any condition at any time when jesus was there he was god god was in christ reconciling the world to himself but he never used any of his gifts when he met satan now this i want you to know this i never read this until 9 30. notes were already done when he met satan he brought the kingdom of god so low till the weakest christian can use it when saint come to him and said if thou be the son of god command these stones and he said it is written the word he took them up tried to whitewash the word for it and jesus said it is also written he took him on top of a mountain said to look at all these kingdoms i will give you these if you just worship me and he said it is written he said there it is it is written whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe it and you shall have it he said then defeat satan with the word of god just say it is written god's promised it god promised it to me i go to church and the pastor anoints me with all praise over me and i was prayed for that's exactly what god said would happen and it's written just go and refuse anything from the devil god will bring it to pass amen let's stand together psalms 69 verse 18 now when you read psalms i want you to think about who the real enemy is he said david said draw nigh unto my soul not my body my soul and redeem it deliver me because of my enemies psalms 143 verse 8 calls me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning for in thee do i trust cause me to know the way that i should walk for i lift up my soul unto thee my soul deliver me o lord from my enemies if it was an outside enemy it would be your body deliver me o lord from my enemies i flee unto thee to hide me teach me o lord to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness quicken me o lord for thy name's sake for thy righteous they bring my soul out of trouble and of thy mercy cut off my enemies and destroy all of them that afflict what my soul for i am thy servant well it wasn't like we heard a bunch of stories where david was in prison all the time and he was being afflicted our soul gets afflicted by the devil psalms 136 22 who remembered us in our law state for his mercy and earth forever and it redeemed us from our enemies he redeemed us from our enemies don't you want god to redeem you from your enemy from your greatest enemy last one psalms 107 verse 1 o give thanks unto the lord for his good and his mercy and dearth forever let the redeemed of the lord say so who he have redeemed from the hand of the enemy god is here to redeem us from our enemy to lift us up to save us from ourself the devil has always wanted you just live with yourself he's looking for someone god is looking for someone to stand up and say i want to be closer to you lord get lifted up above your enemy amen let's sing humble humble thyself as we just enter in just a little bit of worship and prayer i know this is a little bit long but i think it's good for our souls [Music] just try to enter into christ as we worship humble yourself before your lord and king [Music] give him your heart offer your everything [Music] there's no limit on the love he has for you so humble yourself see

the lord in prayer and there may be someone here that wants prayer wants to seek the lord wants to get serious with the lord more serious more serious not that you're not serious i think that scripture if my people which are called by my name my people called by my name shall humble themselves i will hear from heaven that requirement that god is looking to us on to take that next step doesn't the scripture say draw nigh to god he'll draw nigh to you this is how you do it take his word and obey amen to spout in a word of prayer dear father we're grateful lord that we can come to you in prayer you see our hearts you see her our yearning and our desire to walk more in your image and your likeness lord and we've been stuck with this old pestilence this law of sin this nature in our ourselves this selfishness that has often got in the way of yielding to you lord of wanting to be more in your likeness in your image and the devil's always showed us as we're an easier way to get to where we want to get to maybe just listen to another tape maybe just do this this deed maybe just spend a couple minutes in prayer but lord the enemy has been take the lids have been taken off the enemy we see he's nothing but a liar trying to get us to think that we can't be overcomers that we can't be any closer to you that we can't live with more of the joy of the lord in our lives lord we remember your words today to be of good cheer you've overcame you're still as alive and real and powerful today as you ever were you're the same yesterday today and forever lord we want to testify

life to you more of our will because we want to get closer to you lord we want to be filled with all the power of god now pray for every heart here wherever they're at with you whatever's on their heart whatever you've dealt with them lord i pray that they would just respond with a submission to your word lord you will never ever ever ever ever through the history of what we know as time will

you're calling up higher in the midst of laodicea lord we hear the prophet's words being echoed in our ears pinch our conscience the hour is late and lord you're calling us to overcome that greatest enemy that stands in the way from from going out reaching out for more souls to being used in that purpose of that eternal purpose of getting other people to believe in what you've already said oh god help us to turn people from the power of darkness to your light for your word is the only light there is in this world only light in our lives we can't we can't overcome the devil on our own but there's a god greater than the devil that lives inside of us and our testimony today is lord you are greater within us than anything that we face god give us faith to believe that to stand upon it and to begin to see this old nature just fall off just decay as we submit to your word we commit all of our lives to you lord be those that would might be listening today if it would be their prayer lord
