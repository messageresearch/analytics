[37:42] believe it fits right into the message
[37:44] today we have to take a stand
[37:47] everybody's standing for
[37:49] something you may not think you're
[37:51] standing for something but if you're not
[37:53] standing for something you're standing
[37:54] for
[37:55] yourself that's that and that Shaky
[37:57] Ground down
[38:02] there um this morning we want to talk
[38:04] about finding our purpose in
[38:06] Christ finding our purpose in Christ
[38:10] starting here in Ecclesiastes chapter 3
[38:12] let's read the first 11 verses to
[38:14] everything there's a
[38:16] season and a time to every purpose under
[38:19] the
[38:19] heaven a time to be born and a time to
[38:23] die a time to plant and a time to pluck
[38:27] up that which is planted A Time to Kill
[38:31] and a time to heal a time to break down
[38:34] and a time to build up a time to weep A
[38:38] Time To Laugh time to mourn and a time
[38:42] to dance a time to Cast Away
[38:45] Stones time to gather Stones
[38:48] together a time to embrace and a time to
[38:51] refrain from
[38:53] embracing a time to get and a time to
[38:56] lose a time to keep and a time to Cast
[38:59] Away a time to Rend a time to sow a time
[39:04] to keep silence and a time to speak a
[39:07] time to love a time to
[39:10] hate time of war and a time of
[39:13] Peace what profit have he that worketh
[39:16] in the in that wherein he labor Earth I
[39:21] have seen the travail which God have
[39:23] given to the sons of men to exercise in
[39:26] it
[39:28] he have made everything beautiful in his
[39:31] time also he have set the world in their
[39:36] heart so that no man can find out the
[39:38] work that God maketh from the beginning
[39:41] to the end God bless you may be
[39:47] seated these scriptures have been um
[39:51] some scriptures that I've known for many
[39:53] many years I would think almost
[39:55] before um
[39:58] or near the time that I gave my heart to
[40:00] the Lord not sure but it goes back that
[40:02] far in fact there was a song I used to
[40:05] listen to uh in the world and I can't
[40:09] remember the the group but probably
[40:11] brother Marty knows turn turn turn
[40:14] something like
[40:16] the yeah
[40:19] so that was a cool song you
[40:23] know but this is a blessed word
[40:28] and uh has a message have you ever heard
[40:31] anyone say you need to find a purpose in
[40:34] life it's a very common
[40:38] phrase I remember when I was trying to
[40:41] figure out what I was going to do in my
[40:42] life what direction I was supposed to
[40:45] take what I was supposed to pursue and
[40:47] some of you heard I I wanted to be a
[40:49] doctor didn't know if I was going to be
[40:51] a professional hockey player or
[40:53] musician uh one thing you don't know I
[40:56] don't think I've ever said I wanted to
[40:57] actually have a hardware
[40:59] store and I I wanted to write a
[41:02] book as you know I started going to
[41:04] college I wanted to be a medical uh
[41:07] assistant because I I knew I couldn't
[41:09] stay that in school that long to be a
[41:11] doctor because I just I didn't have a
[41:12] desire
[41:14] to uh be a doctor more than you know
[41:17] wanting a family that was my greatest
[41:20] desire but I wanted to be a finished
[41:22] Carpenter too at one point I wanted to
[41:24] be a Furniture
[41:26] maker I remember to this day putting an
[41:29] application into the road commission
[41:30] because I was going to be happy filling
[41:34] potholes so you talk about trying to
[41:36] figure out my purpose in life I had a
[41:40] whole gamut of ideas
[41:41] here of course my thoughts were not his
[41:44] thoughts at all God had a much greater
[41:47] purpose for me both naturally and
[41:52] spiritually not only did God have a
[41:54] purpose under the heaven for me but he
[41:56] had a season for it as
[41:58] well and I agree with the scripture here
[42:01] that God makes everything beautiful in
[42:03] his
[42:04] time we want to talk about finding our
[42:08] purpose in Christ it's important
[42:13] because all those things that I made
[42:16] mention that I wanted to do I'm not
[42:18] doing any of
[42:20] them and I could take any one of those
[42:22] and just say you know God could use me
[42:25] in that area which he can he can use a
[42:27] donkey but the the the thing that I'm
[42:30] trying to say is it's better if you just
[42:33] let God tell you what to
[42:36] do I was at a point I even made mention
[42:39] this to Cheryl I said that I would never
[42:42] ever have a
[42:44] business and I certainly was not going
[42:46] to have a to business so just everything
[42:49] about me was contrary with
[42:53] God and if I never humbled myself to say
[42:56] God God show me have your way I want
[43:01] your will that is the biggest thing God
[43:03] I want your will because if the heart
[43:05] and the desire is not to to want God's
[43:08] will above everything else then we'll
[43:11] get lost trying to get our will and
[43:13] God's Will and it'll get mixed
[43:16] up but God had a purpose for my life and
[43:18] I didn't know it and God has a purpose
[43:20] for our lives both naturally and
[43:23] spiritually and some of us may not know
[43:25] what that really is some of us done
[43:28] we're seasoned we're seasoned we can see
[43:32] certain things that God has transpired
[43:33] in our life and and I'm not saying that
[43:37] God couldn't bless me doing anything
[43:38] because I just believe that he
[43:40] could right God God could but I'm just
[43:44] not interested in that I I
[43:48] I it's always better to be in in what
[43:52] God has purposed for our
[43:54] lives Paul had a self-will
[43:58] purpose before he was converted he
[44:01] really thought he was doing exactly what
[44:03] God wanted him to do he had scriptures
[44:06] to back it up he was he was he was the
[44:09] best among the best and and he was right
[44:12] in his own eyes and from a worldly
[44:14] standpoint he did his best to fulfill
[44:18] the word of God from a worldly
[44:21] standpoint
[44:23] unfortunately he was moving with a
[44:25] bulldozzer with what he thought to
[44:29] do he was working actually against God's
[44:32] purpose for his life he was fighting
[44:35] against God's purpose and didn't know it
[44:37] and sometimes when we could just look at
[44:39] our will we could be actually fighting
[44:42] against what God's will is for our life
[44:45] Jesus told so I am Jesus whom thou
[44:49] persecutest it is hard for the to kick
[44:52] against the
[44:53] Pricks in other words it's harsh and
[44:55] painful and fruitful and harmful for you
[44:59] to resist the purpose of
[45:03] God you're you're not going to change
[45:08] God you're not going to change his
[45:11] will you're not g to you can't do
[45:13] anything against the word the Bible says
[45:16] only for the word you can fight against
[45:19] God's purpose but God's purpose is
[45:21] always going to work always going to
[45:24] stand always going to move forward the
[45:25] only thing is we make miss out right we
[45:29] may miss
[45:30] out when Paul humbled himself to walk in
[45:33] God's purpose it's when he per is when
[45:36] he prospered spiritually and he says
[45:38] here in 2 Timothy 3:10 I'm just going to
[45:41] quote it I don't have it up on the board
[45:42] but thou has fully known my Doctrine my
[45:46] manner of life my
[45:49] purpose you've known my purpose my faith
[45:52] my longsuffering my charity my patience
[45:54] my persecutions and afflictions which
[45:57] came unto me in Antioch and Iconium and
[45:59] listra and pers what persecutions I
[46:01] endured but out of them all the Lord
[46:04] delivered me amen how many has suffered
[46:08] some sort of persecutions in the last
[46:11] week let me see your hands think about
[46:13] that persecuted in this time that we're
[46:19] living but the devil is still the
[46:22] devil just working through other people
[46:24] and other means so
[46:27] because we suffer persecutions because
[46:31] we are are called all sorts of things it
[46:35] doesn't mean God's not with us we have a
[46:38] promise that God will deliver us out of
[46:41] them
[46:42] all God made Paul's life beautiful in
[46:47] his
[46:48] time to Paul's life there is a season
[46:51] and a time to every purpose under the
[46:54] heaven now I'm so glad today that Paul
[46:58] decided to surrender his life to God and
[47:03] say who art thou Lord I really I really
[47:06] want to know you because at one time he
[47:07] thought he knew God he read the Bible he
[47:09] knew the Bible so good but he didn't
[47:12] know
[47:13] God but when God spoke to his heart had
[47:18] that encounter it was a real real
[47:20] encounter it wasn't just something uh
[47:24] that he saw with his eyes
[47:27] it was something that he saw with the
[47:28] eyes of his heart there was a connection
[47:30] that took place and he had to step back
[47:34] and say who art thou
[47:37] Lord I'm so glad because we wouldn't be
[47:39] reading 14 books of the New
[47:42] Testament unless he made that decision
[47:44] that is how important it is for us to
[47:46] find a God's purpose for our life to
[47:49] find where we fit into God's purpose
[47:52] because there's something down the road
[47:53] I'll be I'll be honest with you there
[47:54] was obviously a point in my life that I
[47:56] knew nothing nothing I didn't know God
[47:58] didn't know nothing didn't know what I
[48:00] should be doing nothing but somehow God
[48:03] had to bring that to manifestation and
[48:05] that only happens when you yield your
[48:08] life and you say God I want to know
[48:10] because if we just go on in our life and
[48:12] kind of do what we want to do we're
[48:14] going to miss what God
[48:16] has let's look at Andrew Peter James and
[48:19] John they left their father's profession
[48:22] to follow
[48:25] Jesus Matthew he left his government job
[48:29] as a tax
[48:31] collector and God had a greater purpose
[48:33] for David than what he thought or what
[48:36] his dad even
[48:40] thought Moses was
[48:43] taught what his purpose was from a a
[48:47] young child I
[48:49] believe but he leaned to his own
[48:51] understanding about the purpose that God
[48:54] had for him and when he did he failed he
[48:59] failed because he used his own ability
[49:03] in to to fulfill God's purpose instead
[49:06] of using God to fulfill his purpose
[49:08] there's a big difference when Jesus said
[49:10] don't go witnessing don't go testifying
[49:13] don't be telling the world about me
[49:15] until you're in due with power from on
[49:17] high he will be your ability
[49:20] amen so then it took 40 years for God to
[49:23] bring him to a place that God could
[49:25] fulfill his purpose in his life 40 years
[49:28] 40 years think about it God could have
[49:30] did it one year but why 40 because I I
[49:34] believe that God works through free more
[49:36] agency the more that we hunger and
[49:39] thirst and desire the more that God will
[49:41] fill us and the more we just say well
[49:42] I'm going to do what I want to do and if
[49:43] God wants me to do he just gonna have to
[49:45] make it happen I don't think God is like
[49:48] that I don't think God is is he's got
[49:51] robots he wants a love affair I believe
[49:54] his bride would desire the will of God
[49:56] for their
[49:59] lives God sovereignly allowed Joseph to
[50:02] be born in a dysfunctional family
[50:05] anybody ever been know anybody like
[50:09] that well Joseph was one of
[50:12] them he was rejected by his
[50:15] siblings and when he was 17 years old he
[50:18] was taken captive by his brothers and he
[50:21] was abandoned and sold as a slave into a
[50:24] foreign land that was Egypt you we know
[50:26] this and this is where he began the next
[50:29] 13 years of
[50:30] hardship falsely accused of
[50:33] rape sent to prison
[50:36] unjustly and it was forgotten by a
[50:43] friend now we know God was with
[50:47] Joseph but why did all this happen to
[50:51] him you can't go by what's happening in
[50:54] your life
[50:58] Genesis 50:1 15 if you like to follow
[51:02] along with us up on the board here
[51:04] Genesis 50:15 and when Joseph's brothers
[51:08] saw that their father was dead this is
[51:11] at the end of
[51:16] everything they said Joseph will
[51:18] pre-venture hate us and will certainly
[51:21] requite us of all the evil we had done
[51:24] unto him so now they're looking back
[51:27] Joseph's brothers we did this we sold
[51:29] him we were very bad to him you know he
[51:31] he's going to like kill us and and so
[51:34] they were they were scared and they sent
[51:38] a message unto Joseph saying thy father
[51:41] did command before he died saying so
[51:45] shall ye say unto Joseph forgive I pray
[51:49] thee now the trespasses of thy Brethren
[51:53] and their sin for they did unto thee
[51:56] evil and now we pray theee forgive the
[51:59] trespasses of the Servants of God of thy
[52:02] father and Joseph wept when they spake
[52:07] unto
[52:08] him so this is a
[52:12] very a
[52:14] very a very very heartfelt moment here
[52:17] that was going
[52:19] on and his brothers also went in and
[52:22] fell before his face and said beh behold
[52:26] we are thy
[52:30] servants and can you imagine after all
[52:32] the evil that they had done I mean I
[52:35] would think that Joseph probably would
[52:38] have said we're going to get some things
[52:41] straight we're going to straighten this
[52:43] situation out right
[52:45] now because you know you're going to
[52:47] reap what you
[52:49] sld I mean you take you can take the
[52:51] word and make it anything you
[52:54] want but but but but
[52:57] there was something I this is why I like
[53:00] you know Jesus he was the Fulfillment of
[53:03] the law and part of the law isn't just
[53:06] you're you're going to an eye for an eye
[53:07] and a tooth for a tooth but it it's
[53:09] going to fulfill the law and and
[53:14] restore and that's the part that people
[53:17] have a hard time
[53:21] living and Joseph said unto them fear
[53:24] not for I am in the place of
[53:29] God but as for you you thought evil
[53:32] against me I know that but God meant it
[53:36] unto good to bring it to pass as it is
[53:41] this day to save much people
[53:45] alive now therefore fear ye not I will
[53:48] nourish you and your little ones and he
[53:50] Comfort them and spake kindly unto them
[53:54] God made everything beautiful beautiful
[53:56] in his time amen there was a season for
[54:00] it amen and and and and it it would take
[54:04] somebody spiritual to be able to look at
[54:07] this situation and really see that that
[54:10] God meant all the bad things that happen
[54:13] for the good and to restore lives and
[54:16] sometimes we have to go through
[54:17] suffering in order for people to be
[54:20] helped to everything there's a season
[54:22] and a time to every purpose under heaven
[54:25] so we have our own purposes in life and
[54:28] God has his purpose in life they're not
[54:32] the
[54:33] same they're absolutely not the
[54:36] same God told balam what to
[54:39] do God knew the purpose and the plan and
[54:42] what to
[54:43] do and you can't curse
[54:46] Israel you can't I mean and have it
[54:50] happen you'll get Cur you'll get the
[54:51] curse that you curse on
[54:54] Israel because you just can't
[54:56] you know God will bless them that bless
[54:59] you God will curse them that are
[55:02] cursy and and but but Baum he was
[55:07] sent with a a he knew the will of God he
[55:11] knew to to to to bless
[55:15] Israel but he had his own purpose
[55:17] knowing the purpose of
[55:20] God so here he was in the purpose of God
[55:24] trying to fulfill it and yet he was
[55:26] working his own purpose in
[55:29] it and it didn't
[55:32] work so we have to understand God has
[55:35] his purpose we have our purpose they're
[55:38] two separate
[55:40] things we can't just say well you know
[55:43] it is it's God's purpose for me to go do
[55:45] this because I want to go do it well I I
[55:48] gave you the list of all the things that
[55:49] I wanted to do and I I have more things
[55:53] I'd like to
[55:54] do but that not the will of God as much
[55:58] as I wanted it's not the will of
[56:00] God and I think I could prosper in those
[56:05] things and so we must understand that
[56:08] God's Eternal purpose his purpose for
[56:10] our life is so much more important than
[56:12] what we would
[56:14] like people can get so involved in their
[56:16] own purposes that they don't even think
[56:18] about God's purpose they just kind of
[56:21] want to drag God into their life as if
[56:23] you know it has to be but God has an
[56:27] eternal purpose that has nothing to do
[56:29] with anything except his eternal
[56:34] purpose God made man in his own image to
[56:37] have Fellowship after his
[56:40] kind and we know what his kind is his
[56:43] kind is to love
[56:45] unconditionally to be completely devoted
[56:47] and committed 1 Corinthians 13 tells the
[56:50] story about Divine
[56:52] love later we learned that the love his
[56:56] the kind His Image his kindness was even
[56:59] to love his enemies which at that point
[57:02] man didn't know about it right no wonder
[57:05] Lucifer thought that he was going to get
[57:06] away with everything because God was
[57:09] just so
[57:11] loving he was kind humble Meek lowly his
[57:16] kind is a servant living for others and
[57:18] redeeming others this is the kind so so
[57:22] when God said let us make man after our
[57:25] kind into like our image we understand
[57:29] this is what God wanted man to
[57:32] be not just a human
[57:36] being not just the outside
[57:39] body but the the inside the character
[57:43] who he
[57:44] [Music]
[57:45] is but God allowed the Fall In the
[57:49] Garden in order to express more of who
[57:51] he really is we have been through this a
[57:54] number of times the sin ful falling
[57:57] condition of man gave opportunity for
[57:59] God to manifest more of who he really
[58:02] is and it does the same thing for us
[58:05] today trials prove who we really are
[58:12] amen we can't say well it would be
[58:14] better if I didn't have a
[58:19] trial somewhere down the road we've got
[58:21] to say I I'm not going to go rob that
[58:24] bank
[58:26] I I'm not going to go up to the window
[58:28] after I get my Quarter Pounder and say
[58:30] you know you made a mistake I ordered to
[58:32] if you don't do something I'm going to
[58:33] do something I'm going to get mad and
[58:35] then they just give it to you because
[58:36] they don't want a
[58:38] problem we just can't think like
[58:42] that so God allowing his children to
[58:45] fall and for us to be born in that same
[58:48] selfish condition God's Eternal purpose
[58:52] has been to restore all of us back to
[58:58] him now this has been God's Eternal
[59:01] purpose before there was a world began I
[59:03] mean this was all in the mind of God and
[59:06] I believe that that God had even hid
[59:08] this from Lucifer at the time I
[59:11] do but see have you ever had some
[59:14] longing in your
[59:15] heart you just held it
[59:18] there you you couldn't even explain it
[59:22] but it was
[59:23] real and God had this real real longing
[59:26] to have a
[59:28] family and who is he going to have a
[59:30] family with I mean can you
[59:34] imagine being married to some
[59:39] Martian some
[59:43] robot some person that has another
[59:46] language has total different interest in
[59:49] you actually hate your
[59:52] guts no there there's nothing there to
[59:55] draw you to
[59:57] that but he had a longing to be to have
[1:00:00] a a a union with something just like him
[1:00:03] well where are you going to get that you
[1:00:05] can't get it anywhere outside of
[1:00:08] yourself so he took a part of himself
[1:00:11] and he placed an individuals through
[1:00:13] history through
[1:00:15] time and gave opportunities for them to
[1:00:18] come
[1:00:19] out he could manifest his love to his
[1:00:24] bride this is God's Eternal
[1:00:27] purpose turn with me if you would to
[1:00:29] Ephesians chap 3:5 Ephesians 3:5 which
[1:00:33] in other Ages was not made known Unto
[1:00:37] the Sons of men as it is now revealed
[1:00:40] unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by
[1:00:44] his by the spirit that the Gentile
[1:00:47] should be fellow heirs and of the same
[1:00:52] body and partakers of the promise in
[1:00:55] Christ by the Holy Ghost so we see here
[1:00:59] that the Jews and the Gentiles are going
[1:01:01] to be
[1:01:02] one
[1:01:04] amen right the same we're the same
[1:01:09] family and he says whereof I am made a
[1:01:13] minister according to the gift of the
[1:01:15] grace of God given unto me by the
[1:01:17] effectual working of his power unto me
[1:01:19] who am less than the least of All Saints
[1:01:23] is this Grace given that I I should
[1:01:26] preach among the Gentiles The
[1:01:27] unsearchable Riches of Christ and to
[1:01:30] make all men see what is the Fellowship
[1:01:33] of the mystery which from the beginning
[1:01:35] of the world had been hid in God who
[1:01:40] created All Things by Jesus Christ but
[1:01:42] somehow because you're a part of
[1:01:45] God it was
[1:01:47] there didn't even know what was going on
[1:01:50] didn't I can tell you that laying in my
[1:01:52] bed and and when I was just a teenager
[1:01:54] boy and I there's got to be a God but
[1:01:57] having no idea what he is who he is and
[1:02:00] how I could ever get in contact with him
[1:02:03] and what he ever be able to see that I
[1:02:07] really wanted
[1:02:11] him of course you have those
[1:02:14] thoughts and then you're dealing with oh
[1:02:16] I got to give up all this
[1:02:18] stuff but it's a price you pay it's a
[1:02:22] price you pay
[1:02:26] I'm so glad that he placed within us
[1:02:29] himself and there's that that contact
[1:02:32] that desire the Deep calling to the Deep
[1:02:34] one for another God desires to be in you
[1:02:38] you desire to be in Christ amen it's a
[1:02:41] love of fair

[1:04:19] worketh in US unto unto him be glory in
[1:04:24] the church by Christ Jesus throughout
[1:04:26] all ages World Without End Amen I I'll
[1:04:29] tell you that just that just sums it up
[1:04:30] if we could just stay focused that God
[1:04:33] wants to get us where we need to get to
[1:04:36] as a
[1:04:37] family now I'm sure that you've been in
[1:04:41] businesses where they've just been out
[1:04:43] of
[1:04:44] order you ever just you know order
[1:04:48] something again at
[1:04:50] McDonald's and you got somebody else's
[1:04:52] order you ever get up there and they say
[1:04:54] did you order a a a cheeseburger and you
[1:04:56] get up there okay so you ordered the uh
[1:04:58] fish right
[1:05:00] no and you're wondering what's the oh
[1:05:03] okay you ordered this
[1:05:05] one well has your home ever been out of
[1:05:09] order but your just you you just desire
[1:05:13] to get it in order I I mean you you you
[1:05:15] work on a car and Brother Bruce you've
[1:05:17] worked on the car and you're just all
[1:05:18] dirty and greasy you just don't want to
[1:05:21] like you know come in and just you know
[1:05:24] eat go to bed like that you want to
[1:05:27] clean up want to get the body in order
[1:05:30] and so I just say it like this that God
[1:05:32] wants his family in
[1:05:34] order and it's just not a matter of
[1:05:36] saying oh yeah I'm a
[1:05:38] member I'm a member of the family no I
[1:05:42] got I what does God want me to do fit
[1:05:45] into his
[1:05:46] purpose God has an eternal
[1:05:49] purpose that he has been that's been in
[1:05:52] his
[1:05:54] heart no
[1:05:57] wonder God has commissioned he
[1:06:01] commissioned before he left he said go
[1:06:03] ye out and preach the gospel to Every
[1:06:07] Creature because this has been the part
[1:06:11] of the purpose of God he didn't say you
[1:06:14] know just go and live a great life and
[1:06:16] stay out of trouble and try to be an
[1:06:19] example no preach the gospel to Every
[1:06:21] Creature we got to get our family
[1:06:24] together no wonder he sent back the Holy
[1:06:26] Ghost to be a witness no wonder he gave
[1:06:29] each of us the ministry of
[1:06:31] reconciliation and no wonder he makes
[1:06:34] everything to work out for our good if
[1:06:36] we are called according to his
[1:06:38] purpose Romans 8:28 says and we know
[1:06:41] that all things work together for the
[1:06:43] good to them that love God to them who
[1:06:45] are called according to his
[1:06:50] purpose too often people don't think
[1:06:52] about the purpose of God and they're
[1:06:54] just wanting everything to work out for
[1:06:56] the
[1:06:58] good sometimes they're not even worried
[1:07:00] about whether they love God enough and
[1:07:02] to me I have to look back and I have to
[1:07:04] say with my life John Martin you have
[1:07:06] not loved God enough and you have not
[1:07:08] been more about his purpose that's my
[1:07:11] testimony that's what I'm going to say
[1:07:12] about
[1:07:14] myself and that causes me to press in
[1:07:18] but if I say that I stand back and I say
[1:07:20] well I'm going to compare myself with
[1:07:22] Bob hey
[1:07:24] Bob you know
[1:07:27] you're not doing this too hot over there
[1:07:29] well I'm going to feel pretty good about
[1:07:30] myself I don't think that is the nature
[1:07:33] of God I don't think that
[1:07:38] is verse 29 says for whom we did for no
[1:07:43] for whom he did Forno he also did
[1:07:46] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:07:49] image remember the image the same desire
[1:07:52] that God had to make man in his own
[1:07:54] image to the image of the son of his son
[1:07:57] that we might be that he might be the
[1:07:59] firstborn among many Brethren so God
[1:08:03] isn't off Target of where he was in
[1:08:05] Genesis chapter
[1:08:06] 1 he's still on
[1:08:09] Target and nothing is going to stop his
[1:08:11] purpose from being fulfilled we
[1:08:14] understand oh my I we understand I just
[1:08:19] don't know how much time we're going to
[1:08:21] have to do everything that I want to do
[1:08:24] but
[1:08:25] would just take it one one step at a
[1:08:27] time God makes everything beautiful in
[1:08:30] his time he makes all things to work
[1:08:33] together beautiful in his time that's
[1:08:36] the ability that God has to take
[1:08:39] whatever rotten situation and make it
[1:08:41] work out he's got that ability if number
[1:08:45] one we love God and we care about we
[1:08:49] care enough to want to be called to his
[1:08:53] purpose that we're actively working
[1:08:55] working at trying to fulfill the will of
[1:08:58] God in that area Ephesians chap 1:9
[1:09:00] Ephesians chap 1:9 having made known I
[1:09:03] want to try to hurry having made known
[1:09:05] unto us the mystery of his will
[1:09:07] according to the good pleasure which he
[1:09:09] hath purposed in himself that in the
[1:09:11] dispensation of the fullness of time he
[1:09:13] might gather together in one all things
[1:09:16] in Christ both which are in heaven which
[1:09:18] are in Earth even in him in whom also we
[1:09:22] have obtained inheritance being
[1:09:24] predestinated of according to the
[1:09:27] purpose of him who worketh all
[1:09:30] things all things after the counsel of
[1:09:33] his own
[1:09:34] will you can't stop
[1:09:38] God the best thing we could do is yield
[1:09:40] to
[1:09:41] him that we should be to the praise of
[1:09:44] his glory who first trusted in Christ
[1:09:48] now God has a purpose for us to
[1:09:51] fulfill and sometimes it's hard and we
[1:09:54] just need to do he said occupy till I
[1:09:57] come we do need to do that but remember
[1:10:00] God gave our gave all of us gifts and
[1:10:02] talents to be used for what his eternal
[1:10:07] purpose he's expecting us to bring forth
[1:10:10] him I'm going to tell you I don't think
[1:10:12] God ever gave
[1:10:15] me whatever he gave me I don't think he
[1:10:17] gave me a business so I could take money
[1:10:19] and say God at the end of the life I
[1:10:20] really made a a trillion dollar a
[1:10:23] trillion
[1:10:24] dollars here it is Lord I'm giving it
[1:10:26] back to
[1:10:27] you you can't give a trillion dollars to
[1:10:33] God you
[1:10:35] can't he owns a cattle a thousand
[1:10:39] hills but what you can't give him is
[1:10:41] what's what is important to
[1:10:44] him that your
[1:10:46] life would be sold out to his purpose am
[1:10:50] to get the family together we all got
[1:10:52] brothers and sisters we don't even know
[1:10:54] some of them we don't know many of them
[1:10:56] by faith we give money
[1:10:59] overseas by by faith we reach out to
[1:11:02] somebody who who we don't
[1:11:04] know we don't know if they don't know
[1:11:06] Christ we don't know nothing but by
[1:11:09] faith last Wednesday we we had that that
[1:11:12] men's meeting reaching out to a young
[1:11:15] 13-year-old don't know Christ never been
[1:11:18] in church by faith you're trying to get
[1:11:21] the family together it's part of the
[1:11:23] Eternal purpose of
[1:11:28] God now if you're using your money for
[1:11:30] that purpose I believe God reckons that
[1:11:32] but you
[1:11:34] understand we need we need to yield
[1:11:37] ourself to God's Eternal
[1:11:40] purpose not a natural purpose but a
[1:11:43] spiritual purpose they that win souls is
[1:11:48] wise and if you let God lead you he will
[1:11:52] use your natural purpose or your job to
[1:11:56] fulfill his eternal purpose remember
[1:11:59] that you do not have a job just to have
[1:12:02] a
[1:12:03] job God is Not
[1:12:08] wasteful God God we know God can use us
[1:12:11] anywhere anytime he wants
[1:12:15] to but we need to we need to know that
[1:12:18] we know that we know that we're here
[1:12:19] because God had us to be
[1:12:22] here because that's how you have faith
[1:12:24] that God can use you where you're
[1:12:27] at well I feel like preaching this to a
[1:12:30] thousand people I feel like preaching it
[1:12:31] to myself it's a truth I believe it with
[1:12:34] all my heart too often we just look at
[1:12:37] our our jobs or the things that we do is
[1:12:39] just jobs and natural
[1:12:41] things but there but but to me if your
[1:12:45] heart has been called to God's Eternal
[1:12:48] purpose then you're just your mind is
[1:12:51] still right there in God's Eternal
[1:12:54] purpose where you work
[1:12:57] and somehow he's going to use that for
[1:12:59] his eternal purpose I believe it that
[1:13:01] that's just I believe that with all my
[1:13:03] heart God has a purpose for us to
[1:13:07] fulfill and we are the only ones that
[1:13:09] can fulfill
[1:13:11] it we're the only ones that can care
[1:13:13] enough to say Lord show me how to
[1:13:16] fulfill your Eternal purpose Lord ordain
[1:13:20] my steps to win souls for thy kingdom
[1:13:22] Lord direct my life into the image of
[1:13:25] and likeness that you would have let my
[1:13:28] heart's desire be for Eternal purpose
[1:13:30] too often we just forget about God's
[1:13:33] purpose and we think that's God's
[1:13:36] business but God has a
[1:13:40] wife God is a wife somebody brought the
[1:13:43] truth to you somebody
[1:13:47] did you can say it was God but I'm
[1:13:50] telling you it was God through a human
[1:13:51] being because that's what the word says
[1:13:54] that's that's what the word says He
[1:13:56] chose
[1:13:57] that every seed brings forth of its kind
[1:14:00] and it works through and so God is just
[1:14:02] wanting us before the end comes because
[1:14:05] we're near the end are we not we're we
[1:14:07] we're near the end we don't know what
[1:14:08] day we don't know if it's going to be
[1:14:10] this year but we're running we're
[1:14:12] running out of time to really you know
[1:14:14] get some some some more Jews in our
[1:14:16] crown and I I I was thinking about this
[1:14:18] and I don't know how that I don't
[1:14:20] necessarily think this is true but you
[1:14:22] know how brother B says you're going to
[1:14:24] be attached to Every Soul
[1:14:27] somehow in heaven you're going to be
[1:14:28] attached to Every Soul that you were
[1:14:30] part of that you either won or help
[1:14:33] somebody to win I thought how are they
[1:14:36] going to know what's what and how you
[1:14:37] know how are you going to know and when
[1:14:40] you look up at the sky and you see all
[1:14:42] those stars like kind of like looking at
[1:14:44] the ceiling here you see that some of
[1:14:47] them are bigger and
[1:14:49] brighter and then that there's some that
[1:14:51] are not quite as
[1:14:53] bright and I believe that you can do
[1:14:56] something by putting an offering in the
[1:14:58] in the plate here that um you know goes
[1:15:03] to a
[1:15:04] missionary somehow
[1:15:08] um something gets left out another
[1:15:10] person gets it takes it over here goes
[1:15:12] over somehow it reaches somebody through
[1:15:16] I don't know how many people that you'll
[1:15:18] never
[1:15:19] know and that may not be that star
[1:15:23] that's as bright as the person that you
[1:15:25] want to the Lord yourself because I
[1:15:27] think that's going to be a bright
[1:15:29] one but still there's an attachment
[1:15:32] there
[1:15:34] and I want God to use us we only got a
[1:15:37] little time
[1:15:39] left second Corinthians chapter 5:14 for
[1:15:43] the Lord of For the Love of Christ it
[1:15:46] constrains us to reach out because we
[1:15:49] thus judge that if one died for all then
[1:15:52] we're all dead we shouldn't be living
[1:15:53] for oursel
[1:15:55] and that he died for all that they which
[1:15:58] live should not henceforth live unto
[1:16:01] themselves but unto him which died for
[1:16:04] them and rose again wherefore henceforth
[1:16:07] know we no man after the flesh say
[1:16:10] though we have known Christ after the
[1:16:11] flesh yet now henceforth know we am no
[1:16:14] more so we're just just keeping that
[1:16:18] out
[1:16:19] therefore if any of us be really in
[1:16:22] Christ then we're new creatures
[1:16:26] and old things are just passed
[1:16:29] away and behold there's a couple things
[1:16:33] that are
[1:16:36] new oh thank you thank you thank you for
[1:16:39] yes all
[1:16:41] things not some
[1:16:43] things let's not be satisfied with some
[1:16:45] of the things that we
[1:16:47] got let's to what job I will not be
[1:16:51] satisfied to I awaken his likeness amen
[1:16:54] there needs to be something inside of us
[1:16:56] that we're pressing towards becoming
[1:16:57] more like Christ like Paul said
[1:17:02] pressing
[1:17:04] so if any man be in Christ is new
[1:17:06] creature all things are passed away
[1:17:08] behold all things are new and all things
[1:17:10] are of
[1:17:12] God who have reconciled us to himself by
[1:17:15] Jesus Christ and has given to us not a
[1:17:20] flag of
[1:17:22] reconciliation not a honor not a
[1:17:25] not some certificate you put on the wall
[1:17:28] of reconciliation but we've been given a
[1:17:31] Ministry of reconciliation Amen to Wi
[1:17:35] that God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:17:37] world unto himself not imputing their
[1:17:38] trespasses unto them and have committed
[1:17:41] unto us the word of reconciliation amen
[1:17:44] now then we are ambassadors for
[1:17:50] Christ has anybody ever dealt with an
[1:17:53] ambassador
[1:17:56] well we all know what ambassadors are it
[1:17:59] it's it's it's a
[1:18:02] representative of of the country that
[1:18:04] you're from that's in a foreign a
[1:18:06] foreign
[1:18:08] land and we're pilgrims and we're
[1:18:10] strangers and we're amongst people who
[1:18:13] are in foreign land they don't know they
[1:18:14] belong to God yet and God has made us an
[1:18:17] ambassador to connect them to Christ
[1:18:21] am and I wonder how many's gone to work
[1:18:24] yet how many's really left their post of
[1:18:27] Duty how many's forgot their calling how
[1:18:29] many's forgot their
[1:18:31] purpose God has a purpose for us to
[1:18:34] fulfill this is not just for the
[1:18:41] preachers if I could say this it's
[1:18:44] probably less for the
[1:18:48] preachers I I I'm I'm glad somebody
[1:18:51] agreed with me on that I I I the first
[1:18:53] time I ever thought it but I tell you
[1:18:55] the ministers that they're they're
[1:18:57] working their their heart their time
[1:18:59] into the word to bring it
[1:19:01] forth but but we we sheep uh uh sheep
[1:19:06] bear the wo right sheep bear sheep and
[1:19:08] and so I believe we need to be really
[1:19:11] reaching out to others now nothing can
[1:19:14] change or alter God's purpose
[1:19:18] nothing we need to align ourself up with
[1:19:21] God yield ourselves dedicate ourselves
[1:19:24] set our affections on things above and
[1:19:26] then you know God will do the rest he
[1:19:28] will right he will do the rest he just
[1:19:31] looking
[1:19:32] for yielded vessels
[1:19:35] amen nothing can change God's purpose
[1:19:39] nothing he makes everything work out for
[1:19:42] the counsel of his own
[1:19:44] will Isaiah
[1:19:47] 5511 nothing can alter God's purpose so
[1:19:50] shall my word be that goth forth out of
[1:19:53] my mouth it shall not return to me void
[1:19:56] but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:19:58] please and it shall prosper in the thing
[1:20:00] where unto I sent
[1:20:01] it so God makes everything beautiful in
[1:20:04] his time if he sends a word it's not
[1:20:08] going to return unto him void it's going
[1:20:10] to prosper in the place that he sent
[1:20:14] it there is a purpose and nothing can
[1:20:17] change this purpose from
[1:20:21] happening you know you have all Heaven
[1:20:24] behind you when you're when you're
[1:20:25] ministering to somebody when you're
[1:20:28] witnessing when you're sharing the love
[1:20:30] of
[1:20:31] God oh yeah you may get tomatoes thrown
[1:20:34] at
[1:20:35] you you may get
[1:20:38] persecuted but you still have all Heaven
[1:20:40] behind
[1:20:42] you it's the truth well I don't want to
[1:20:45] offend them brother John that's why I
[1:20:47] don't do
[1:20:48] it you're going to offend Jesus Christ
[1:20:52] then did you hear me you're going to
[1:20:54] offend Jesus Christ if you don't witness
[1:20:59] you got to take a stand you can't wait
[1:21:01] for somebody to come up to you and say I
[1:21:03] want to know about God he never said
[1:21:06] that he said go ye
[1:21:09] out he didn't say let them come in go ye
[1:21:13] out and so we we we have to be willing
[1:21:17] to put one step towards what God is
[1:21:19] calling us to
[1:21:21] do God spoke his word in Isaiah 7:14
[1:21:24] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:21:26] you a sign and behold a virgin shall
[1:21:28] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[1:21:30] his name Emmanuel God Is With Us am and
[1:21:34] 750 years later we know God's word came
[1:21:37] to pass or
[1:21:40] thereabouts God's promised word did not
[1:21:43] return unto him void it
[1:21:46] accomplished what pleased God it
[1:21:48] prospered where he sent it and we can
[1:21:51] say in that scripture that God God
[1:21:55] prospered and made everything beautiful
[1:21:58] in his
[1:21:59] time nothing was going to change
[1:22:04] that I'm just trying to tell you how
[1:22:06] important it is to hunger for for God's
[1:22:10] purpose for your
[1:22:14] life because God is moving forward I am
[1:22:16] telling you for all the people that
[1:22:18] don't want to go to heaven God is still
[1:22:20] moving forward there's still going to be
[1:22:21] a heaven there's still going to be a
[1:22:22] judgment there's still going to be a
[1:22:23] hell we I will just make sure that we're
[1:22:26] right there with God Amen and the thing
[1:22:29] is it's not just well I'm not doing
[1:22:30] anything bad it's not that it's about
[1:22:33] God I want to do what you want me to do
[1:22:35] that's what he's looking
[1:22:38] for now this beautiful thing that God
[1:22:41] did he did it in
[1:22:43] secret he said a virgin shall conceive
[1:22:46] and bear a
[1:22:50] son there was no newspaper articles
[1:22:54] there was no advanced warning that Jesus
[1:22:57] is coming to
[1:22:59] town as we heard there was no red carpet
[1:23:02] rolled out in fact God did not make this
[1:23:06] a public
[1:23:08] show but God had ordained before the
[1:23:11] foundation of the world and yet this
[1:23:13] great thing happening and God didn't
[1:23:14] want to be a public show think about
[1:23:17] that this really tells us about the
[1:23:20] nature of God
[1:23:25] God had even purpose to receive praise
[1:23:29] in this season that it happened so what
[1:23:32] does he do so what does he do he sends a
[1:23:35] Heavenly announcement to some pastors
[1:23:39] the
[1:23:40] Shepherds right only they knew about
[1:23:44] it and the Bible says for behold I bring
[1:23:47] you these angels I bring you good
[1:23:49] tidings of great joy which shall be to
[1:23:52] all people for unto you is Born This Day
[1:23:55] in the city of
[1:23:56] David which is uh a savior which is
[1:23:59] Christ the lord and suddenly there was
[1:24:02] with the angels a multitude of What Not
[1:24:05] Earthly hosts but Heavenly hosts
[1:24:08] praising God and saying glory to God in
[1:24:10] the highest and peace uh on Earth peace
[1:24:13] and Good Will towards
[1:24:15] men so this great thing
[1:24:18] happening or from the foundation of the
[1:24:20] world all excited kept it a secret
[1:24:24] and didn't want anybody to know except
[1:24:27] some
[1:24:29] Shepherds and the Shepherds saw this
[1:24:32] praise happening because God wanted
[1:24:36] praise but he also kept it a secret he
[1:24:39] didn't want to be a public
[1:24:42] show God had ordained to receive praise
[1:24:46] and it came from Heaven itself because
[1:24:48] the world says did not know
[1:24:51] him that's what the Bible says he came
[1:24:53] to his own his own received him not they
[1:24:55] didn't know
[1:24:57] him so it was it was it was here God is
[1:25:01] being B birthed into the world that
[1:25:03] didn't know
[1:25:04] him of course he wouldn't receive praise
[1:25:06] from the world yet
[1:25:09] yet but but he says but uh he came to
[1:25:13] his own his own receive not but to as
[1:25:15] many as did receive and gave he power to
[1:25:18] become the sons of God and there's where
[1:25:20] True Praise comes from
[1:25:23] amen nothing can alter God's
[1:25:27] purpose if he wasn't to receive praise
[1:25:31] then he'll have someone to praise him
[1:25:33] just like he did in heaven I just want
[1:25:34] to share this little situation that
[1:25:37] happened when Jesus descended from the
[1:25:39] Mount of Olives and a multitude of of
[1:25:42] Jesus followers began to rejoice and
[1:25:44] praise God with a loud voice for all the
[1:25:46] money Works he had they had
[1:25:50] seen saying blessed be the king that
[1:25:53] cometh in the name of the Lord peace in
[1:25:55] Earth and glory in the highest and some
[1:25:57] of the Pharisees from among the
[1:26:00] multitude said unto them Master rebuke
[1:26:03] thy
[1:26:04] disciples and Jesus answered in Luke 19
[1:26:07] and said I tell you that if the should
[1:26:09] hold their peace the stones would
[1:26:12] immediately cry
[1:26:13] out in other words nothing is going to
[1:26:16] alter what God wants
[1:26:18] nothing if we refuse I'm telling you
[1:26:21] God's going to make it happen because he
[1:26:23] spoke and his word will not return
[1:26:26] void it shall accomplish what it he
[1:26:30] purposed to it to
[1:26:32] accomplish nothing can alter God's
[1:26:38] purpose in Jeremiah chapter 29 is a very
[1:26:41] familiar scripture but here it
[1:26:45] was the those that were brought into
[1:26:49] captivity into into
[1:26:52] Babylon and they were in a Terri
[1:26:54] terrible persecuted place they were
[1:26:57] living in a an area that wasn't uh pure
[1:27:02] uh Jerusalem pure love pure good things
[1:27:05] it was a horrible
[1:27:07] thing and they were
[1:27:10] without as it were the easy going to
[1:27:15] church and having freedom and
[1:27:18] liberty and Jeremiah speaks here uh in
[1:27:22] 29:1 for I know all the thoughts I think
[1:27:25] toward you sayeth the Lord thoughts of
[1:27:28] peace and not of evil to give you in the
[1:27:31] expected
[1:27:33] end God does everything beautiful in his
[1:27:37] time that's what we got to focus on is
[1:27:40] trusting the end is going to be
[1:27:45] beautiful then shall you call upon me
[1:27:47] and you shall go and pray unto me and I
[1:27:49] will hearken unto you and you shall seek
[1:27:51] me and find me when you shall search for
[1:27:53] me with all your heart notice what God
[1:27:55] is wanting us to do to align
[1:27:57] ourself align our heart with him and
[1:28:02] he'll take care of everything else we
[1:28:05] need to seek to fit in to God's Eternal
[1:28:08] purpose let it start out by saying God
[1:28:10] is something I don't think about very
[1:28:13] much
[1:28:16] Lord what would you want me to
[1:28:20] do you see my time you see my my my
[1:28:23] ability ities you see uh who I can who
[1:28:27] I'm I'm in contact with just get your
[1:28:31] heart in your mind aligned in this
[1:28:35] direction and God will take you to the
[1:28:37] next step he'll open the doors things
[1:28:40] will begin to happen because this is on
[1:28:43] the mind of God more than anything
[1:28:45] that's on our mind it's been on his mind
[1:28:48] from the
[1:28:49] beginning I mean it really was and here
[1:28:54] let me just say this it's not like a a
[1:28:56] job that we have to go there and we just
[1:28:59] you know hey you know you need to just
[1:29:02] get born again so we can get out of here
[1:29:04] and get to heaven it's not quite like
[1:29:06] that God wants to step into your body
[1:29:09] and manifest the same attributes that he
[1:29:13] had in him before man
[1:29:16] fell he wants to manifest that
[1:29:18] forgiveness that love that joy that
[1:29:21] longsuffering that wash your feet that
[1:29:22] servant that giving
[1:29:25] he wants to do all that inside of your
[1:29:29] body so it's much more than you got you
[1:29:32] have to go do this job and you know
[1:29:34] reach out to this person no there's a
[1:29:36] the love of God constrains us there's a
[1:29:40] joy in living for others there's a real
[1:29:42] Joy there is no joy in being
[1:29:45] selfish there's none there's none you
[1:29:48] know people that are selfish I'm going
[1:29:50] to say this they're
[1:29:52] miserable they're miserable
[1:29:56] I want to read the scripture to you
[1:29:57] because I'm talking about here at the
[1:29:58] end we're closing now aligning ourself
[1:30:02] with God's plan for us aligning
[1:30:04] ourselves with
[1:30:06] it in 2 Chronicles
[1:30:11] 7:4 reads If my people which are called
[1:30:13] by my name shall humble themselves and
[1:30:17] pray and seek my face and turn from
[1:30:21] their wicked ways I'll just say our own
[1:30:23] ways
[1:30:24] no matter what it is then will I hear
[1:30:27] from heaven and will forgive their sin
[1:30:30] and will heal their
[1:30:31] land and so here it is it isn't it isn't
[1:30:37] because you know we don't belong to God
[1:30:39] or somebody doesn't belong to God it
[1:30:42] just means that we can belong to God and
[1:30:45] we can get away from where we need to
[1:30:48] be and this scripture gives me
[1:30:51] hope that if I just turn towards I I
[1:30:54] line my life and I I get serious you
[1:30:57] know it's more than just going to
[1:30:59] church more than just giving some
[1:31:02] ties it's giving some money it's more
[1:31:04] than just trying to be you know nice to
[1:31:07] somebody but it's really it's it's
[1:31:10] turning from our selfish living and
[1:31:13] turning towards God and saying God you
[1:31:15] have a purpose that's going to last
[1:31:18] beyond this
[1:31:20] Earth in in other words when this Earth
[1:31:22] is over and is burned in and there's a
[1:31:24] new Heaven and there's a new Earth God's
[1:31:26] Eternal purpose is still Eternal he's
[1:31:29] going to be with his family and when we
[1:31:31] get there wouldn't it be nice to say
[1:31:34] they're there or somebody else says to
[1:31:36] you I'm here because of
[1:31:38] you because you took time out of your
[1:31:42] your life that you could have done
[1:31:44] anything you wanted to do with it but
[1:31:46] you gave all that up to make sure I got
[1:31:49] in
[1:31:54] now down here it may not seem that
[1:31:56] appealing but I'm telling you when this
[1:31:58] life is over and we're up there it's
[1:32:00] going to mean everything because that's
[1:32:01] all there is that's all there is there
[1:32:04] ain't going to be anything
[1:32:05] else you know when I was I was a captain
[1:32:09] in in a hockey team in high school and
[1:32:12] and I I end up getting a hat trick you
[1:32:14] know and I I thought that was really
[1:32:16] cool and I got Trophy and all that stuff
[1:32:17] but you know that won't even be spoken
[1:32:19] of in
[1:32:21] heaven it's it's it's it's
[1:32:24] we need to focus on the things that God
[1:32:26] is already focused on let's Stand
[1:32:32] Together seek God's Eternal purpose God
[1:32:35] will make everything beautiful in his
[1:32:37] time I believe this is the season for us
