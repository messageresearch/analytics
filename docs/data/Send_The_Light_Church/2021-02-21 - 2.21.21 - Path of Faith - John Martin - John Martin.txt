want to wish that each one of us feels the presence of the Lord a very special way um Galatians chapter 3 starting with verse uh number one through five and then we'll have a word of prayer oh foolish Galatians who have bewit te you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ had been evidently set forth crucified among you this only what I learn of you receive ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith that's right are you so foolish having begun in the spirit have you not are ye now made perfect by the flesh have you suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that minister to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you do do he by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith that's right amen let's bound a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord as we bow before you reverently not worthy Lord to be in your presence not worthy that our troubles would be vanished not worthy that our hearts would be mended not worthy Lord to

commit every need now to you and trust you for the furtherance of this service for we humbly pray and give you the honor for these things in Jesus precious name amen God bless you you may be seated uh we want to entitle this message the path of faith for a subject continuing by hearing the voice of God personally amen we can wander off the path of Faith quite quickly it doesn't take much to distract people to get them to lean to their own understanding to look at their circumstances and and and and make a different Choice a different decision to allow their imagination to get the best of them to get judgment or to get angry or hold grudges to feel the need for attention or self-importance or the feeling need of of esteeming ourselves rather than esteeming others Pride can really be a distraction our knowledge and intellect can be a distraction yes sir sometimes all it takes is some little trial to get us off the path of Faith but that's when we need it most trials really prove where we're at every single one of us is going through different situations different things are going on in our life different set of circumstances we're all going through different tests and different trials the pressures that we're feeling are evolving from different aspects of this life but it's the preaching of the Gospel that brings us together in Christ amen it's where the harmony of the word shows us the path of faith that we should be onen Psalms 119 104 says through thy precepts I get understanding through thy mandates through thy commands I get understanding Thy word is a lamp unto my feet amen a light unto my path it's this word that helps us see the different things that are going on in our life the different set of circumstances that are coming the pressures that are ti how just to handle them how to deal with them what decisions to be made in them the word gives us light for our past so we can walk the path of faith we don't want to lean to our own understanding brother Ram said in the message God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same he said and Faith takes its final resting place on the word of God that's right there is where it Finds Its resting place he says you understand amen its resting place is on the word in the message atonement brother B said the first thing we wish to draw your attention to is the infallibility of God's word God keeps his word to the letter that's right he does and tonight we want to fasten our thoughts on that that God keeps his word we can rest assure of anything that God has said in his word to be the truth and Faith does not rest upon the shifting Sands of man's ideas or man's theology but it has its final resting place on the unmovable Rock of God's Eternal word amen we don't come to the house of God to prove our ideas that we think about trying to get it to to to prove that we're right in a way of thinking but we don't even come here to really rally behind of what we already agree upon either that's good amen that's right a thought a simple thought that God keeps his word amen we come more prepared than ever because we need our faith to rest on God speaking to us personally for our lives our situations what's going on in our homes and our jobs and our neighbors and our families we need to hear from God about those things that's right so we need a Living Word am and we need a living faith amen connecting with the realness of the Living Word that will give you faith for your path amen it will give you faith for your circumstances your questions your directions faith for what you need to do what God wants you to do that's right in the book of Hebrews remember chapter 4 the children of Israel when they came to church and they heard the god preach the word heard the word of God being preached they did not mix it with faith right so it didn't do them any good it was no profit to them they came to church and left the church there was no profit it's so we've got to hear from God personally this this word that's being preached it's got to be just for me Amen brother Brandon said if if you're the only one that makes it in this city make sure you're that one you've got to have that attitude I'm the one amen because I'm committed to God that much I want God that much a Living Word brings a living faith we know that this word is either a dead letter to us and won't produce a thing for our lives or it's alive to us and it's bringing change to our lives creating God's character inside of us it depends on where we're at not where God is at I came to church and I didn't see God Amen we should bring him he was hanging on the cross and they didn't even know it they were walking on the road to Emmas and they didn't know it but when we get into The Presence of Jehovah you really get in the presence of and you are hungering for God to have his way things happen in your life in your circumstances in your situation because we serve a living God he is a present help in a time of trouble he's here to help us today all depends on where we're at either our spirit is proud narrog judgmental doubtful slow to believe or our spirit is humble and hungering to manifest a perfect love amen for the world to see amen a prepared heart will be able to catch the voice of God as the word is being preached I want you to catch that a prepared heart will be able to catch the voice of God as the word is being preached did not the prophet say there's a message in the message there's a voice in The Voice God is is here to speak to us individually right but we've got to focus on this is a real real sanctuary of God a real place that God we come to meet with God personally we don't we don't just come and show our badges that we're in the message or that we know so much or we just want to be heard or anything like we come with reverence and respect God I need to hear from you I need a change Lord I have a situation I need healing I need deliverence but to the heart that's not prepared the word is not alive to them personally therefore the word cannot bring forth a living faith to them and that's what you need for your situations we need a god with skin on it we need a living faith that's right leaving them without light for their path just another service us lordes how could the prophets say we never leave a service the same a lot of times we feel the same when we leave brother BR said that we're either closer to him or further away is it possible do you think the devil wants you to feel that you're close to God when you're not absolutely look at Leota the whole church the whole church is in need of nothing right right so I'm sure the devil's pretty good at letting us feel that we're closer to we're just as close to the god when we're further away but we can know whether we're closer when you accept the word being preached you can know of assurity that you are closer to God than when you came closer if you accept the word into your heart further if we just agree with the word I want that to sink in it's good in other words we can agree with the word and never accept it into our hearts the devil's they know it's true but they don't accept it personally for their lives now this is important it this word this preaching it needs to become personal to us the bride is getting ready because they are receiving the word personally need to keep our eyes on the goal amen what is your goal today that's right everyone doesn't have the same goal go I know Paul's goal God has predestinated his L to be conformed into the image of his son that's what Paul said amen Paul wanted to press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus that's right and the prophet preached the same thing I know the goal that the prophet pointed to was whatever you do lay everything aside until you get perfect love he showed us what priority was priority I want you to understand this perfect love was not just a characteristic of God and this perfect love that we're supposed to be getting is not just a characteristic of a person this is the manifestation of Christ in a person you do not have to be born again to love somebody or something but you must be born again to love everybody because there's something in the old nature that doesn't want to love its enemy to me it is the word being made flesh again even in a world where hate is soaring and the love of many is waxing cold love of God can still be projected by the bride they're the only ones everybody else is they've left that aside they're not interested in perfect love they think it's like it's going to happen automatically in that Rapture Day like you just you know it's going to be gifted to you it will not be gifted to you it's a choice that you make when you're being cursed at when you're being slammed when you're everything's being said behind your back and you choose to love that is character this in itself will bring to pass that Divine love making that choice it's easy to lash back when being lashed against amen that's true brother the word is the most important do you say Amen to that it's not different than perfect love 1 John chapter 2 verse 5 but whosoever keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God per perfected look at that who so keepeth his word in him him is the love of God perfected so if we say we keep his word and we're not loving perfectly and we know what perfect love is right love your enemy spitefully use you Jesus told us amen told us that this is how his heavenly father is he wants us to be just like his Heavenly Father amen when you can keep that word and love despite what somebody's doing to you right that's the highest pennacle hereby know we that we are in him in other words you're able to love one another as yourself that's what Jesus wanted you're able to love your enemies like Jesus said how in the world are you ever going to become what God has called you to become if you keep making light of what God has called you to do or making excuses of why you can't do it come on you we're either going to Rally behind the word or we're going to Rally behind that we're human that's good of course we're human of course we're going to make mistakes akes but we either got to be testifying that we can overcome or they're Giants right amen that's right somebody's got to believe this word now I want to say this it's important that you understand that you must believe the word before it's manifested you don't wait till you're a fully manifested Son of God you love everybody to stand up and say I'm a Believer it ain't going to happen You' got to say I'm a first and when you fall you'll get back up and when you fall you'll get back up but you say I will love my enemy I will overcome cuz I'm a Believer God is looking for your faith to come to that place amen you got to stay in the path of Faith amen thank you Jesus he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked wow and how did he walk he walked in perfect love did he not who else could say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing right who else could come inside Stephen and say the same thing God in you will do the same thing yes he is the same yesterday today and forever they looked at the prophet and they lied to his face but he still loved him anyways and it was a real love it was a genuine love that's right Hebrews 5:2 who can have compassion on the ignorant and them that are out of the way who and them who curse you and despise you and and despitefully use you who can have compassion if you love them that love you what's your reward right God isn't giving you any you're not getting any war from God some having compassion Jud said making a difference what will make a difference in somebody's life when they see the love of God manifested the importance of walking in the path of a living faith Romans 14:23 says for whatsoever is not of faith is sin that's the importance of walking in the right path we've got to have faith amen we must contend for the faith that was once delivered by God himself through the through the disciples right through the apostles through the but it was God who delivered the Fai Faith this morning if you're going to get Faith it comes from God it don't come from the pulpit it' be best if we just took our eyes off the pulpit get our eyes on Jesus this morning amen we must keep fighting the good fight of Faith amen because anything short of that will be sin we must hunger to hear the God speak to us personally amen we can read the Bible and still not hear his voice still say it's his word do you know you can hear the voice of God not be reading the Bible we must labor to enter into to his rest we must be more prepared to hear the word than just to show up for church how is God going to honor that I mean all the other churches are showing up for church the word spoken to us personally will lighten our path give us Faith to walk where we should be walking for our certain situations otherwise God could still be speaking to us we'd be so much in the flesh and we won't even hear what the spirit is saying to the church Paul walked in the path of Faith he he said I live by the faith of the Son of God now Paul couldn't walk someone else's walk we can't walk one another's walk amen each believer needs to work out his own salvation amen with fear trembling Philippians chapter 2 verse 13 says for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure so why is God speaking to you he wants to work in you he wants to do his good pleasure in you we must recognize it believe it walk in it it's why it's important always take your if you bring one thing to to church outside your Bible Let It Be Your your rake forget everything else bring your rake rake it in amen the spirit of truth which is the holy ghost or the Living Word of God will lead and guide us into all truth the spirit of truth right not the dead letter amen not just some some quote some some read the scriptures but the spirit of that word is what leads us and guides us into all truth Thy word may personally alive to us is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path yes Thy word personally I've got to come in connection with the spirit of the word this morning I don't want to sit here outside of the spirit I don't want to sit in this presence of God and not recognize it I don't want to be in God's presence and not hear and speak to me personally I want ears to hear what the spirit is saying to me today CU I am the church by the grace of God I am the church today and God promised that he that has ears to hear Let Him hear what the spirit is saying to the church you don't want to take God for granted when you're pressing into a Living Word not a dead letter when you're hungering and thirsting for The Living Word of God God promises to fill us amen that's right he keeps his word yes he promised that's right brother Brandon said that God keeps every word of God to the letter but we have to believe it we have to keep focus on them keep trusting keep believing don't deviate from the path of faith we must find faith for our lives not just Faith or Rapture brother bam says how are we going to get Faith for big things when we don't even have faith for little things we can't expect to make it off the tree of knowledge it's through faith that we get the victory it's not our own understanding the knowledge about our situation what we think's best but it was when God gives you a word for that situation and you know it's God speaking to you you can Bank on it 1 John chapter 4 chapter 5 verse number four 1 John chapter 5 verse number four for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh your world even our faith our faith you want to overcome your situation hear from God hear from God get desperate about hearing from God you could listen to a brother Bram tape every day in your life and if you don't have the right attitude the chances of you hearing from God are slim because the word of God falls on four types of ground my friends and it only brings for forth uh when it's on a good fertile ground and will last I don't even want the the ground that brings forth the word for a while and then after a while I get offended I want the word that takes me through amen I want the ground where the word can fall and take me through all the way I want to overcome all things the Bible says that to him that overcometh while Grant to sit with me on my throat even as I've overcame and sat with my father and his throne Hallelujah hallelu that's who the Rapture goes to yes we've got to overcome Amen to go ahead and say you know I just want to escape all this stuff and get out of here come on we've got to believe for our situation I'd rather go out believing am than try to be a prophet and predict what my future is going to be big deal big deal you have the revelation of that i' rather show God I trust him when we're born of God we're living a new life by the will of God think about that we're interested in the will of God we're seeking it we're we're hungering for it we're not just asking God to let let it be his will for this that and the other right because we're born again we're born of God we're living by the faith of the son of man and his faith becomes our faith when his word becomes personally revealed to us spoken to us personally that's why I say at this moment as you're sitting in your seat you're hearing this word being preached let it be a con prayer in your heart God let me hear from you today Lord I know why others thou are calling do not pass me by I I need you Lord I need to hear from you today this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith we need faith for our personal lives we must understand we cannot get Victory any other way don't bother trying without faith it's impossible to please God let alone get the victory we'll never get a lasting Victory without faith you may get something you want for now you know Satan has taught us humans how to manipulate a situation how to manipulate people how to even try to manipulate God you can't you can't Satan tries to manipulate God God knows what he's doing God's in control God is in control no matter what happens amen we rest in that amen it's always been through the real substance of faith that God has done anything amen we we all should say Amen to that Hebrews 11:3 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were made not made of things which do appear so let me ask you who did that was that Bob the Builder were they using Tonka toys and caterpillar no Jesus Christ spoke the word through faith it came into existence when God said let there be light all of Heaven knew there was going to be light there was not a doubt in the Angel's Minds Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away now Satan can't do that Satan can't speak the word in create he's a liar he's a deceiver he's a perverter of that which is the truth so when God said repent and be baptize every one of you and you shall reive the gift of God right think about that don't separate the holy ghost from God am amen God is interested in implanting himself inside of you not just give you a little gift some gifts are without repentance and some you got to repent but I tell you you want God it's got to be by choice it's got to be by choice believe it and you shall receive it it's through faith that we receive the Holy Ghost we've got to stand the path of faith for our lives we can't deviate from it we can't allow doubts and imaginations and human in like to lead us away from God right right because that's what it's doing amen the devil wants you to kind of bring perfection in the flesh why do many people get baptized but never follow through to get the Holy Ghost because the word doesn't stay personal to them that's why it doesn't remain real to them it's through faith the path of faith that we receive all the promises of God stay in the path of faith if you're off get back online amen if you're deviating pinch your conscience if you're leading to your own understanding get back to hearing the voice of God personally amen amen that's right Galatians chapter 3:2 are opening scripture this only what I learn of you receive ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of Faith did you receive the Spirit by some works or did you hear am are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh have we gotten so far away from that personal walk with God that we got to intellectually try to figure everything out and get something done let's not be foolish am we're going to receive more Holy Spirit through the hearing of faith not through works not through church attendance it's through hearing from God we're going to be perfected through the hearing of Faith amen I love that question have you begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh are we going to get perfect faith perfect love for a perfect Rapture to a perfect God and a perfect heaven through the works of the flesh when you hear God's voice then and only then will you be able to follow him into all truth how many thankful for the truth that you have today amen don't stop here God has more for you that's why we come here is for the more truth now brother brandom never brought us a new message he didn't bring us uh another book he brought us the opening of God's book amen so we don't come for something new something exciting something entertaining we come to hear God's speak to us for our lives that's why we're here it needs to be personal second Peter chapter 1 verse4 whereby are given unto you and me exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature of God we got precious promises it's on the path of faith that we're able to partake of God's divine nature amen I want to escape all the junk that the devil has come in you know he's planned a lot of junk towards us he's got things in his mind and the demons have things in their mind that you don't even know about yet yes sir they're coming it's true brother we and we've got to put on the whole armor of God we got to be serious when we come into God because God may be wanting to give us a word to help us tomorrow it's through faith in God's precious promises that we can gain the victory 1 John chapter 3:8 he that committeth sin or unbelief is of the devil right for the devil sinned from the beginning he disbelieved that God was God he said I will be like the most high he didn't believe that God was God he sinned from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil and we know he did that at Calvary but today I need Christ manifested inside of me to destroy the works of the devil inside of me this doubt this unbelief need to possess the the gates of the enemy inside of me these evil thoughts and things it's not what goes in the belly it's what comes out it's not what thoughts that just hit you it's what you sit you think about and you you meditate on and you allow to Fuster inside of you that's what becomes sin and we need God manifested in our flesh to destroy the works of the devil give it to me Lord I'm hungering for it Lord Galatians chapter 3 verse number six even as Abraham believed God that it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham so today yes all you have to do is believe right you are a a direct descendant of Abraham if you believe amen and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Heathen through faith through faith not works through faithe before the the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall the Nations be blessed so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse don't try to get perfected in your know it all for it is written cursed is everyone that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them we can't we can't do everything this flesh can't fulfill the word that's right you just start one day just go one day watch how many times you you think evil love of God think no evil against his neighbor but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident that just shall live by faith now I don't want faith that my brother Bob who's doing all sorts of evil I wantan to I'm not g to look for faith that that this brother who's doing evil is not going to do evil that may or may not ever happen in this lifetime but I if I can hear from God how to love this brother yes amen how to manifest Christ in front of this brother how to show him that he is loved of God regardless there might be a chance there might be a chance now for that man to be saved right so that's what I want to hear from I want to hear how I can manifest Christ amenes amen and the law is not of Faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them Christ have redeemed us from the curse of law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree and The Blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith through faith I want the Holy Ghost start believing for it I want more Holy Ghost start believing for it it is mine it is mine claim it Abraham had to go 25 years he didn't sit around like a bump on a log right is right whatever you're Desiring You Must Believe for through faith Brethren I speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's Covenant yet it be confirmed no man disol or added there too and to Abraham and his Seed where the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ and the law which was 430 years after cannot disol that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law there's no more a promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of transgressions to the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator now a mediator is not a mediator of one but God is one in the law then against the promises is the law then against the promises of God God forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness would have been by the law now noce had given life we were all dead sin trespasses and the law could not bring us to life today Church attendance cannot bring you life tithe pain cannot bring you life hearing the word naturally cannot bring you life it only bring you more condemnation you'll have more knowledge of what you should be doing and not doing it what we need is the spirit of life here today and only you can bring that only your hunger your thirst can bring that amen see you in your heart you create the atmosphere for God to come and be real to you amen you don't put it on the song leader you don't put it on the preacher you put it on yourself verse 22 but the scripture have concluded all under sin that the promise of faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe believe believe you I want to walk around saying I believe even if there's a t of Doubt Lord I believe help thou my unbelief don't wait till it's all gone to say you're a Believer let God know what side you're on let those demons who's lying to you let them know what side you're on but before Faith came we were kept under the law shut up shut up into the faith which should afterwards be revealed where of the law was a school Master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith but after faith has come we are no longer under the school Master we are all the children of God Amen by faith in Christ Jesus that's powerful don't let a demon in hell don't let any thought come into your head to tell you any different amen what is the evidence I believe I believe you can't prove to anybody and what does it matter anyways it is between you and God don't even go there with the devil just stay with the path of faith and we got to stay on that path amen for as many of you have been baptized in Christ have put on Christ there's neither Jew or Greek there's neither Bond or free there is neither male nor female for all our one in Christ Jesus I don't think Jesus is a racist the very thought that somebody would even talk about it shows something's wrong right that's just how I feel that's right I had somebody in my driveway let me just finish this last verse if ye be Christ then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise I had something in my driveway yesterday and he was telling me about he got a new job and L lot of stuff there but his not important to talk about what I want to get to is something I thought was important his brother's in the National Guard and the government told him and others obviously that they do not want you to build up an immune system to this virus I can confirm that they want you to get the vaccine don't take God's provided way right that we were born with to fight off hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and thousands and millions of viruses since we were a baby don't they don't want you to do that it's difficult but it's true I'm concerned about that amen I'm concerned about that why in 2021 of all my life that's the first time I've ever heard that I want you to know we've read a lot of extra verses there in Galatians chapter 3 but it's through faith man wants us to put our confidence and our understanding in a man-made thing God made us perfect I'll stay with god well what if you die I'll be happy that I stayed with God you know the thing is the thing is the people with the vaccine cannot guarantee me that I'm going to live and there there hundreds are dying yeah after they take it so what are they offering they're offering their idea their man-made idea I say we need to hear the voice of God personally for us we just got to this is only the beginning the Bible is telling us there's coming a time you won't be able to buy or sell unless you take a mark right amen we've got to hear the voice of God we got to know where we're standing Ephesians 2:8 for by grace are ye saved amen don't forget these next two words through faith through faith we can't be saved without faith it is not of yourselves it is the gift of God did you notice you cannot get this gift unless you believe am amen I can guarantee next Christmas when I go under the Christmas tree which I don't have but there's going to be a gift there for me but that ain't how God hands out eternal life he don't hand himself out like that because that's what eternal life is it's God himself amen fight for amen you've got to believe it you don't earn it you don't work for it you humbly submit to the word of God for we are his workmanship so when you look if there's anything that you have ever seen good in me if I say the word if we can rest assur it's all because of Jesus Christ I can point you to the person I was without Christ and there's nothing to brag about right nothing I'd wish on my children that's right I can show you the workmanship of my hands my thoughts my mind headed straight to him said you're my son he picked me up put me on the right path the path of Faith he said this is my word read it this is what you will become this is which I ordained you to become predestinated you to be conformed to this word amen for we are the workmanship his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works now it's not us but Christ in us doing the works which God have for ordained that we should walk in them it's important that you keep working for the Lord 2 Timothy chter 3:1 15 and that from a child thou has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus notice Paul never preached to Timothy once saved always saved I remember laying on my bed when I was a boy reading the book of Revelations and scared scared scared yeah they were able to make me wise unto salvation but you know what I'm not there yet I'm going to keep pressing in amen you know we I I think the devil brother Mike I think the devil has done more damage with predestination trying to tell people they're saved no matter what you just do what you want to do then they go out in the world I think there needs to be more preaching cuz I'm telling you the elect won't be deceived they won't be deceased so what do we got to preach predestination to them all the time that's so good but the devil has taking this thing and he's getting people who are not sold out to God and getting them back out in the world well if I'm pretty out come it's a truth all scripture is given by the inspiration of God and it is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that we may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works I think we need to continue on this path of Faith amen oh praise the Lord what if I told you I wanted to go through the book of Hebrews chapter 11 I'm just going to go super duper fast I just talk a moment on the path of Faith from the book of Hebrews chap 11 it's a substance it's a real substance the elders obtain a good report verse four says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain that doesn't mean Adam and Eve gave them an instruction book of how and what to offer this means God spoke to them personally verse five by faith Enoch was translated God spoke to him personally had a testimony that he pleased God verse six without faith it's impossible to please him verse seven by faith Noah was warned of God of things not not yet here yes we don't know what's coming in 2022 but God can warn us amen that's why we come here is to hear from God personally see now notice I want you to put your name in this book your name we're going to hear all these other people's names but you're a child of Abraham that's right amen you've got to hear God speak to you verse eight by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place not knowing where he even went it was by faith he went out I don't know where I'm going God just calling me I'm going but it was real to him and Sarah just had to say I trust you she didn't she didn't have the old Revelation Abraham come follow me she was following Abraham and Abraham was following the spirit verse n by faith he sojourned in the Land Of Promise by Faith by the voice of God spoken to him personally verse 11 through faith also Sarah received strength to conceive seed now notice both Abraham Sarah going through trials both had to hear from God Amen verse number 17 by faith Abraham when he was tried he offered up Isaac can you imagine having to go through that it was by faith though God God speaks to us sometimes things that are very hard to do very hard to give up very hard to but it's still God and we've got to follow through with it because it was that thing that Abraham did that God Justified him in a way that he couldn't without it he was justified by faith but he after he did that he stayed his head says now I know Amen in other words God is looking for us to show forth Works Faith with without works is still dead justification is not good enough for the bride we've got to have the works of Christ Hallelujah we've got to follow through by faith verse 20 Isaac bless Jacob and Esau concerning things to come now if you remember Isaac thought he was doing just the opposite of what he was doing but by faith in other words he didn't stop and say oh I made a mistake let's get this thing back and let's rechange this he said the will of the Lord be done right amen he trusted God was in control amen amen so sometimes the The Voice doesn't necessarily come before the action in this in this time it came after it happened by faith Jacob when he was dying he blessed the sons of Joseph amen by faith verse 22 when he died when Jose by faith when he died he made mention the departing of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones had a personal revelation verse 23 by faith Moses when he was born he was hid three months of his parents in other words God gave his parents a revelation amen amen amen spoke to their hearts didn't come out in in in pharoh's newsletter verse 24 by faith Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter I wonder today how many is going to stand and refuse uh to be called the the devil slave and listen to him speak that you can't overcome that you can't make it through that you can't uh be a believer today that you're not going to get healed today that you're not going to get filled with the Holy Ghost we got to take a stand against the devil take a stand I love verse 25 choosing rather to suffer the Affliction with the people of God than to go out and enjoy the pleasures of sin for just a season amen verse 27 by faith he forsook Egypt I trust today that you're forsaken everything in this world through faith he kept the Passover keep the Passover verse 29 by faith they passed through the Red Sea everybody's got a red sea amen but it's by faith don't cry about it stand up amen take a stand amen I'm going through I'm going through I'll take the way with the Lord's despise few amen by faith the walls of Jericho fell down amen by faith the Harlot Rahab perished not she a harlot heard the voice of God speak personally you know what she did when she heard she didn't go tell her other friends she followed the voice of the Lord amen you don't need anybody's okay today just fall through with what God told you verse 32 and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and and of Barak and Samson and Jeff jeffu Jeff Jeff of David also and of Samuel and of the prophets there's a lot of them who through faith dealt with all their own personal situations really this was their personal situations it was through faith that they subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain promises stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness was made strong wax violent and fight turned the Flight of the armies of the aliens I'm telling you if they did that through faith don't you think God can give us faith today for our lives to help us from where we're at to where he's calling us to that's why this is written in here it's for us to believe that God is the same yesterday today and forever God's with me God's speaking to me God's going to deliver me God's going to lead me he's going to T me in a Rapture women receive their dead rais to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of crew mockings and scorings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were saw on the sun they were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world wasn't even worthy now they thought when they were doing this to them that they were unworthy so we don't we honestly don't want other people's opinion about us it'll just distract you from what God thinks about you they wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and the caves of the earth and these all having attained a good report through hearing from God personally what to do in their situation get desperate to hear from God get desperate it's if you hunger and thirst I've got to hear from you Lord God will come he promised to amen amen I don't want to be personally a dead Church to God I want to be a church that's alive one that's singing the Praises that's rejoicing always every day I get up I think of this scripture this is the day that the Lord hath made I will rejoice and be glad in it regardless of what's going out there I choose to rejoice in the day that God gave me I choose to praise him with the breath that I have I choose to glorify him in my thoughts I choose the way of the [Music] Lord through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect isn't that beautiful all these Believers heard God's voice spoken to them personally inside their heart they received it they act upon it regardless of the great trials they went through and now your situation a lot of times may seem what do I do Lord you I don't seem to hear from you I just going to do what I want to do don't do that don't do that humble yourself to wait on the Lord wait on the Lord they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength you'll hear from God and when you hear from God you'll be to stand up by faith overcome that situation know what to do give a word for that hour whatever it might be if it's okay with you I'm gonna have to bypass some stuff you're going to have to endure a lot of stuff but it's no different than our brothers and sisters that have gone behind us amen the Bible says my sheep hear my voice amen we hear the voice of God not I agree with what's being spoken it's not good enough that won't take you through because there's a lot of people smarter than me they're going to come along and talk you out of what you heard but if you hear it from God nobody no devil in hell can talk you out of it in this dark hour that we're living we need need to hear the voice of God am amen you're blessed today can I give you just a few encouraging scriptures yes all right Matthew Chapter 13 ver14 and in them is fulfilled the prophecy isaas which saith by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand in seen you shall see and not perceive that's those were the two walking in the road of mass but you know God came by and he opened up their understanding amen for this people's heart is wax gross and their ey ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed don't go to sleep in church lest at any time they should see with their ears and hear with their ear uh I'm sorry see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them amen he said but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they do hear this scripture here is so powerful for verily I say to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear the things which you hear and have not heard them We Begin walking by the hearing of Faith we're not going to quit now and try to make it the rest of the way with our own understanding we're going to get back I've got to hear the voice of God because when you first heard the voice of God it wasn't some man coming to you and telling you this is God something inside was speak speaking to you I'm not saying a word wasn't planted because God chose the foolishness of preaching but I am telling you that there something took place in your heart that was separate from man and that was God speaking to you that we' started this walk in the faith and we got trials coming that I don't even know what they are but we're not going to get perfected in this message through our flesh we've got to St this path of Faith amen Hebrews chap 10:35 cast not away therefore your confidence with have great recompense of re reward for if need a patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promis for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and not tar now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back If any man decides he's going to try to hit perfection without the hearing of Faith the Bible says my soul shall have no pleasure in him that's good that's really good but we are not of them that draw back under predition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul that lies before us amen Hebrews chapter 3 ver14 for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the be beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end got to stay with it stay in the path amen last two verses Hebrews chapter 6 verse 11 and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and and patience inherit the promises that's why we read Hebrews chapter 11 first because we read a whole bunch of people who inherited had overcome had made it through their situations through faith and by faith so shake off any slothfulness that you might have any laziness of just popping into church some laxidasical well it's Church time content with just knowledge of the word or a form of godliness and get back on the path of Faith I've got to hear you today Lord I've got to hear that still Small Voice showing the same diligence in seeking desperately to hear God's voice for your life personally so you can walk out of here and say I know what God wants me to do I know how he wants me to handle this situation with full Assurance of Hope Until the End let's Stand Together amen let's inherit our promises through the path of faith I know we sang this not long ago we did a message on faith and I kind of felt that this was a like a extension of that service if we could just sing living by faith again living by the voice of God amen amen spoken to us personally I care not today what tomorrow may bring if Shadow or sunshine or rain the Lord I know Ru with or everything and all of My worry is vain living by faith in Jesus above trusting confing in his great love from our harm save in a shelter I'm living by faith yeah
