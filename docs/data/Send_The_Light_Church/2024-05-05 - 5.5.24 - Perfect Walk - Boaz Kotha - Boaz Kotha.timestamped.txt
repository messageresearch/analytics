[42:24] 17 verse 1 to 4
[42:31] Genesis 17 verse
[42:41] 1-4 and when Abraham was 90 years old
[42:44] and nine the Lord appeared to Abraham
[42:47] and said unto him I am the almighty God
[42:52] walk before me and be thou perfect and I
[42:55] will make my Covenant between me and
[42:57] thee and will multiply thee exceedingly
[43:01] and Abraham fell on his face and God
[43:04] talked with him saying as for me behold
[43:09] my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt

[1:08:35] are washed in his blood amen we are the
[1:08:37] new creature that's what God came to do
[1:08:40] that's what the holy spirit is for
[1:08:47] amen the word of God came to
[1:08:49] Abraham the prophet said in believing
[1:08:51] God he says Abraham didn't have any
[1:08:53] great cloud of witnesses like like we
[1:08:57] have he was an idol worshipper he was a
[1:08:59] chen out from the city of w he said he
[1:09:01] was called out from amongest people to
[1:09:04] walk in a Strange
[1:09:06] Land This is how beautiful that types
[1:09:09] the Christian walk today that we have to
[1:09:11] come out from our Associates of the
[1:09:13] world to walk in this Strange
[1:09:17] Land This is a Strange Land for
[1:09:21] us we are Heavenly bound we are home
[1:09:25] bound we are not Earthly bound that's
[1:09:28] why we sing that song this world is not
[1:09:31] my home I'm just a passing
[1:09:36] through the Heavenly bridegroom is
[1:09:39] waiting for the Earthly bride the
[1:09:42] Earthly bride is waiting for that
[1:09:44] Heavenly bridegroom he said come quickly
[1:09:52] Lord I'm not preparing for a tribulation
[1:09:59] so are
[1:10:00] you we are all preparing for a body
[1:10:04] change when the trumpet of the Lord
[1:10:06] shall
[1:10:08] sound the dead in Christ shall
[1:10:11] rise and the one who is alive in Christ
[1:10:15] shall rise up shall be
[1:10:19] taken tribulation is not our destination
[1:10:22] amen
[1:10:31] strange to the first land that we walked
[1:10:33] in and the land that we call today is
[1:10:36] walk in the Christian way walk with
[1:10:38] Christ separate ourself from the things
[1:10:40] of the
[1:10:42] world Abraham he did it by faith and he
[1:10:45] CED in a Strange Land not even knowing
[1:10:48] where he was going the only thing God
[1:10:50] said come out Abraham and go to the land
[1:10:54] and he was look looking for a city whose
[1:10:56] Builder and maker was God that's right
[1:11:00] amen God made a covenant with Abraham it
[1:11:03] was an unconditional Covenant amen
[1:11:06] Jehovah jyra he was 75 and Sarah 65
[1:11:10] before God ever spoke to him and make
[1:11:13] the Covenant with him and God said walk
[1:11:15] before me and be thou
[1:11:18] perfect oh God made the Covenant with
[1:11:20] Abraham it was an unconditional Covenant
[1:11:23] with any condition
[1:11:27] without any condition he said if you'll
[1:11:30] do this I'll do that he made a covenant
[1:11:32] with man once like that and Adam broke
[1:11:35] it you
[1:11:36] know man breaks his promise God can't
[1:11:40] break his promise that's right so God
[1:11:43] determined to save him he made the
[1:11:45] Covenant to Abraham
[1:11:49] unconditionally the Covenant was not
[1:11:51] only made to Abraham but it was also to
[1:11:54] the seed of
[1:11:56] Abraham you may say brother Boaz I a
[1:12:00] gentile but the Bible says when we are
[1:12:02] dead in Christ we take on Abraham's seed
[1:12:06] and our hairs according to the promise
[1:12:10] amen let me make this statement to you
[1:12:14] if you are a church member it don't mean
[1:12:17] you are an Abraham
[1:12:19] seed but if you are born again by the
[1:12:22] Holy Spirit you are the Seed of Abraham
[1:12:25] and the faith that Abraham was you have
[1:12:28] dwells in
[1:12:29] you my brothers my sisters no matter how
[1:12:32] encouraging or discouraging rather it
[1:12:35] seems Abraham still refused to see
[1:12:38] anything but what God Said was the
[1:12:42] truth if we call ourself Abraham's seed
[1:12:45] and doubt everything God says nearly
[1:12:48] can't trust from one night to the other
[1:12:50] you see what a poor subjects we are to
[1:12:54] be the Church of the the Living God
[1:12:58] Amen but as we walk in this
[1:13:01] walk we are not looking at the
[1:13:04] circumstance we are looking at the
[1:13:07] promise you know the prophet of God says
[1:13:09] you know Abraham and Sarah going to the
[1:13:11] doctor's
[1:13:13] office and the doctor ask them why have
[1:13:16] you come here Abraham again he says I
[1:13:18] want a
[1:13:20] baby the doctor looks at both of them he
[1:13:23] says are they gone
[1:13:26] crazy at this age you want a baby you
[1:13:31] know but the prophet said Abraham did
[1:13:35] not look at the
[1:13:36] circumstance he did not look at the
[1:13:39] wrinkles you know the the the the you
[1:13:42] know the body which was worn out
[1:13:45] outside he was looking at the promise
[1:13:49] am the doctor was looking of the outside
[1:13:54] of Abraham but God was looking on the
[1:13:57] inside of
[1:13:59] Abraham the inside was
[1:14:02] changing and that's what we need today
[1:14:05] it's not the outward appearance our
[1:14:09] inner inner life should
[1:14:12] change according to the word and the
[1:14:15] will and the purpose of God we are here
[1:14:18] for a
[1:14:23] purpose let us not look at the
[1:14:26] circumstances let us look at the promise
[1:14:28] of God Noah was faithful to God he
[1:14:31] walked with God in a perfect
[1:14:34] manner without even seeing a rain drop
[1:14:37] he started building the
[1:14:39] [Applause]
[1:14:40] ark God said Noah you build it I will
[1:14:43] fill
[1:14:44] it and you must build it according to
[1:14:46] the plan of God's word and his
[1:14:49] will oh David determined in his heart to
[1:14:52] obey to the Lord to be perfect
[1:14:55] amen that's why in Psalm 1012 he says I
[1:14:58] will behave myself wisely in a perfect
[1:15:01] way I will walk within my house with a
[1:15:03] perfect
[1:15:06] heart but when it comes to Solomon he
[1:15:09] fell
[1:15:11] short of God's command to be perfect his
[1:15:15] heart was not perfect with the Lord his
[1:15:17] God as his father
[1:15:21] David First Kings 9:4 the word of God
[1:15:24] says if thou will walk before me as
[1:15:26] David thy father walked in Integrity of
[1:15:29] heart and in uprightness to do according
[1:15:32] to all that I've commanded thee and will
[1:15:34] keep my statutes and my
[1:15:38] judgments Paul also writes in his
[1:15:40] epistle he says that we may present
[1:15:42] every man perfect in Christ
[1:15:45] Jesus amen he says that he may stand
[1:15:48] perfect and complete in all the will of
[1:15:50] God Amen Colossians 4:12
[1:15:55] we need to keep on
[1:15:57] journeying we can't
[1:16:00] stop I want to tell you my brothers my
[1:16:03] sister if something is hindering you
[1:16:06] from worshiping God if something is
[1:16:08] hindering you from Walking with God you
[1:16:11] better stay away from that am it might
[1:16:14] be anything it might be the most dearest
[1:16:17] thing of your
[1:16:20] life I don't say quit everything and
[1:16:23] just start you know know sit in the
[1:16:25] church all your life
[1:16:29] no I always tell my church I always tell
[1:16:32] people wherever I
[1:16:34] go live work hard as you work for
[1:16:37] another 100
[1:16:40] years but you be
[1:16:42] ready as if you're going to go the next
[1:16:47] hour that's very important today we need
[1:16:50] to keep on journeying the prophet of God
[1:16:53] said the mark of the beast he says
[1:16:55] Israel had to keep
[1:16:56] journeying when they stopped they
[1:17:01] backslid in that message he says don't
[1:17:03] try to build upon some other he says you
[1:17:06] can't build a fire on the same ground
[1:17:09] Israel had to keep journeying when they
[1:17:11] stopped they backslid he says they had
[1:17:13] to keep moving every night amen they
[1:17:17] built a new fire every night they just
[1:17:20] kept on moving and that's what we need
[1:17:22] to do he says what Luther had was fine
[1:17:25] that was for Luther's day what Wesley
[1:17:27] had was fine that was for Wesley day
[1:17:30] what Holiness had that was for their day
[1:17:33] we are living in another day
[1:17:39] am you know what the prophet of God said
[1:17:42] we are living in the glare of another
[1:17:47] light people are living in the glare of
[1:17:49] another day 40 50 years ago so
[1:17:53] true and the prophet of God said that's
[1:17:56] a
[1:17:58] mirage what is a mirage that's the false
[1:18:01] light of the sun right you go near you
[1:18:05] know as you go on that Highway you see
[1:18:07] that there is light but when you go near
[1:18:10] there's nothing it's
[1:18:12] fake and that's what the devil has to
[1:18:15] offer today to
[1:18:17] everyone that's why I tell everybody I
[1:18:19] encourage the young people especially
[1:18:21] All That Glitters Is Not God Amen
[1:18:27] we can't live in a mirage we can't live
[1:18:29] in a fake
[1:18:32] light and that's what the devil has
[1:18:35] done he has robbed
[1:18:39] people by showing them this fake
[1:18:44] light we must move on and there will be
[1:18:47] a day after us it will come just the
[1:18:49] same let's walk in that light while the
[1:18:52] light is there the prophet of God said
[1:18:55] we are living in a neurotic
[1:18:59] age that's true it's the battle field of
[1:19:03] the
[1:19:07] mind I go to hospital brother
[1:19:10] sometimes to pray for people in the
[1:19:14] hospital once in a month one Friday I
[1:19:19] go and you know what I see no other
[1:19:22] doctors most of them they don't have
[1:19:25] many patients but one doctor I know he's
[1:19:28] a neurosurgeon he's a
[1:19:31] specialist every day he comes at about
[1:19:35] 8:00 in the morning and he goes
[1:19:39] midnight that many
[1:19:41] people are being suffering with neurolog
[1:19:45] neurological
[1:19:49] problems what is the devil
[1:19:52] doing he has taken the mind amen what
[1:19:55] God does he has taken your heart Hall
[1:19:58] devil chose your mind but God chose your
[1:20:01] heart amen a perfect
[1:20:07] heart he wants us to walk with a perfect
[1:20:10] heart we are living in a neurotic age
[1:20:12] it's the Battlefield of the Mind If the
[1:20:14] devil if he can't catch us in one way he
[1:20:17] will try another he will never allow us
[1:20:20] to unite together in one Accord
[1:20:25] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:20:26] and forever 55 he says don't be
[1:20:28] satisfied with your fire which was built
[1:20:31] last
[1:20:33] night don't be satisfied with your fire
[1:20:36] built here from last night he said let's
[1:20:38] build it a little further up the road
[1:20:40] tonight never build it in the same place
[1:20:43] you can't stand still you are either
[1:20:46] backsliding or you're going forward
[1:20:52] amen you know the greatest Commission
[1:20:54] God gave to the church was go forward
[1:20:57] don't stop just keep on moving Elijah 55
[1:21:01] he says I think the church ought to have
[1:21:03] a commission like that go forward don't
[1:21:06] you stop just keep on moving when this
[1:21:09] revival closes start another one
[1:21:12] somewhere
[1:21:14] amen don't wait don't wait around just
[1:21:17] keep moving for God just keep on moving
[1:21:21] cuz people are
[1:21:22] dying we ain't got no time to hang
[1:21:25] around we got to go forward and don't
[1:21:28] slack a
[1:21:30] bit remember I spoke to you about
[1:21:33] Campground crams he says that's what the
[1:21:36] matter with the people today they got
[1:21:38] the camp ground
[1:21:40] cramps they go to a Revival and have a
[1:21:43] great time the first thing you know a
[1:21:45] little after that before another Revival
[1:21:48] would come along they are back in the
[1:21:50] world again
[1:21:53] right notice you can't make yourself
[1:21:56] anything different from what God
[1:21:57] intended you to
[1:21:59] be anything else is an
[1:22:03] impersonation therefore if your
[1:22:05] conversion is only because you are
[1:22:07] trying to hide behind something or
[1:22:09] trying to make yourself a better person
[1:22:11] you are playing the part of a
[1:22:16] hypocrite first Peter 510 it says the
[1:22:19] God of all Grace who have called us unto
[1:22:22] his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after
[1:22:25] that he have suffered a while make you
[1:22:27] perfect establish strengthen and settle
[1:22:32] here Psalm 25:14 says the secret of the
[1:22:35] Lord is with them that fear Him and He
[1:22:37] will show them his
[1:22:41] Covenant
[1:22:44] amen he wants to perfect us he wants to
[1:22:47] establish us he wants to strengthen us
[1:22:51] he want to settle us
[1:22:54] amen what we need today is a word
[1:22:56] Revival in the end
[1:22:58] time the spoken word which became the
[1:23:01] written word the written word has become
[1:23:03] the Living Word right we can't
[1:23:07] compromise with
[1:23:08] anything the prophet said don't
[1:23:10] compromise when it comes to glorifying
[1:23:12] God worshiping God when you do it the
[1:23:15] glory of God will
[1:23:19] manifest God doesn't need people he
[1:23:22] needs obedience amen he wants a obedient
[1:23:26] Remnant he wants a obedient person
[1:23:29] right it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:23:32] righteousness 61 he says there is no
[1:23:35] compromising with God we don't
[1:23:37] compromise Believers don't
[1:23:40] compromise you know something about it
[1:23:42] God we don't compromise with God there
[1:23:44] is no compromising with God God just
[1:23:47] tastes God he don't expect us on Sunday
[1:23:50] to be Christians praising him and
[1:23:52] worshiping him and on Monday wishy washy
[1:23:55] and take it down and all kind of
[1:24:00] thoughts what we need to do we need to
[1:24:02] stay right centered on God's word amen
[1:24:07] don't go far right don't go for
[1:24:10] left let us walk in the middle of the
[1:24:13] road oh we need the prophet of God a
[1:24:16] deceived Church by the world he says we
[1:24:18] want a bunch of men of God who don't
[1:24:20] compromise on the word of God but preach
[1:24:23] the truth and stand on the baptism of
[1:24:25] the Holy Spirit what we need we must
[1:24:28] walk with God when you fail when you are
[1:24:32] in a fallen State get up when you get up
[1:24:34] obey the Lord Jesus Christ we must not
[1:24:38] stop we must move
[1:24:42] on that's why the word of God said Rise
[1:24:45] and Shine for the light has come in the
[1:24:48] evening
[1:24:51] time we have a destination my brothers
[1:24:54] my sister
[1:24:56] as I told you before the prophet of God
[1:24:59] said either you will meet him as a
[1:25:02] masterpiece or you will meet him as a
[1:25:04] piece of wood Drifting On The
[1:25:07] Water what is our destination today it's
[1:25:11] an eternal destination amen tribulation
[1:25:15] is not our
[1:25:16] destination we need to be closer to our
[1:25:19] destination than our situation than our
[1:25:22] problem than our sicknesses yes why
[1:25:25] because we are the part of God's
[1:25:29] provision my brothers my sisters by the
[1:25:31] help of God we are not going to stay in
[1:25:34] our
[1:25:35] problems we are going to get out of our
[1:25:39] problems let us stop pleading our
[1:25:43] problems let us start pleading our
[1:25:47] promises when we plead to God he will
[1:25:50] fulfill it as a man of God said
[1:25:55] when we go to him in no wise he will
[1:25:58] cast us away
[1:26:01] amen you must learn to trust in
[1:26:05] him because when he sees
[1:26:08] us or when we see him we want to see him
[1:26:12] as an
[1:26:13] overcomer I want to be an overcomer when
[1:26:16] I see him I want to see
[1:26:20] him as a conqueror that's why Paul said
[1:26:23] n all things we are more than
[1:26:27] conquerors my brothers my sisters the
[1:26:29] days are really at
[1:26:34] hand you may say brother boys I'm
[1:26:36] walking with God Amen continue to walk
[1:26:38] with
[1:26:39] God love him do the best you can to do
[1:26:44] to walk with a perfect
[1:26:46] heart we can't pay the play the part of
[1:26:52] Hypocrites we can't put our fet in two
[1:26:56] boats it has to be anyone either God or
[1:27:03] world we need to recognize the day we
[1:27:06] are living in we need to recognize the
[1:27:09] time we are in we need to recognize
[1:27:11] where we came from and where we are
[1:27:13] supposed to
[1:27:15] go the world has so many things to
[1:27:18] offer but the word has got everything
[1:27:22] for us what we need for the this
[1:27:25] journey my prayer today is that the
[1:27:29] coming of the Lord is near I might not
[1:27:31] see you again it's true but let us all
[1:27:35] meet over
[1:27:36] Yonder I want to see you all in heaven
[1:27:39] but if you don't want to see me that's
[1:27:41] your
[1:27:42] problem I want to see you
[1:27:47] all our only prayer should as we walk in
[1:27:50] this walk Lord remember me when you come
[1:27:56] let my name be in that
[1:28:00] number the word of God came to Abraham
[1:28:03] he said I am the almighty God walk
[1:28:06] before me and be thou
[1:28:10] perfect it's the Perfection which is
[1:28:12] going to take us to that
[1:28:14] Rapture I'm not perfect brother boy
[1:28:17] praise God that's true that's right we
[1:28:19] no one is perfect but God is able amen
[1:28:25] amen we have come thus far we have began
[1:28:29] I truly believe that we will complete it
[1:28:31] by the help of
[1:28:33] God God is not looking for a church
[1:28:35] relationship he's looking for a
[1:28:37] individual personal relationship
[1:28:42] today this walk this this highway is so
[1:28:45] small so so narrow only two can walk
[1:28:49] that is you and
[1:28:51] God I and God you and
[1:28:55] God there's no shortcuts to
[1:28:59] Glory we have to only come by the

[1:31:29] try to Mark the books and remember what
[1:31:32] the prophet has
[1:31:33] said people are hungry for the word of
[1:31:36] God today when I see the churches when I
[1:31:39] see the people they come to the church
[1:31:41] without even holding a Bible in their
[1:31:43] hand they are shy they are afraid you
[1:31:46] know they are scared you know they are
[1:31:48] lazy I should say to bring the Bible you

[1:31:53] people people with the iPads and with
[1:31:55] you know with with the iPhones to the
[1:31:58] church but you know I always tell people
[1:32:02] you will not be recognized that you are
[1:32:04] a Christian or a Believer when you have
[1:32:06] an iPad or i iPhone in your hands you
[1:32:09] know the only way you will be recognized
[1:32:11] is Bible in your hand
[1:32:15] you that's true you but you know
[1:32:19] sometimes we go to the battle without
[1:32:21] our weapons you know that's right we
[1:32:23] need this weapon whether you know I I I
[1:32:26] like the Zeal of the people they back in
[1:32:29] India even if they don't have an
[1:32:31] education they still want on Sunday they
[1:32:34] will they leave everything but they want
