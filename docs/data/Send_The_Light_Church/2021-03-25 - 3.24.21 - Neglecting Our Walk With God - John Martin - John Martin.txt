they that hunger and thirst for they shall be filled make me more like thee jesus i say greetings to you in the lovely name of jesus he is still beautiful wonderful and uh salvation is just as real today as it was when he saved us and i say it's a it's a grand privilege to be a christian we can expect things to get smaller and smaller as we approach the day of his coming but i really appreciate each of you that have gathered today and i want to say god bless you to all you that are live streaming today may god encourage you strengthen you and and speak to each of your hearts i want to say it's good to have brother larry back with us we have certainly missed him i want to make that clear to we love him and so good to see him back with us amen to remit with me if you would to the book of hebrews chapter 2 for opening scripture and about a little over a week ago we were uh i should say almost two weeks ago we were looking at this uh subject that we're going to be speaking on today we want to entitle this message neglecting our walk with god neglecting our walk with god and this was really part five of our series uh walking with um our walk with the lord and uh the lord stirred us to speak under a couple services last wednesday last sunday that we're off this series but we're back on it we believe it's for the right time and i want to say that i believe that every single human being has neglected something in their walk with god and um this is i believe timely for us amen before we begin reading here in this book let's look to the author in a word of prayer father we thank you that we could approach you once more by a way of prayer to ask your rich blessings upon our souls upon our minds upon our spirits upon our hearts and lord that you would lift us up in to heavenly places today father that you would be with every heart father that's uh here today that's listening that's watching father i just ask that the the warmness of your holy spirit would just come near us lord and help us to hear that uh still small voice speaking and lord that you would um take these uh words that are in your this wonderful holy book of yours and let them become planted down deep inside of us lord that we would be um more faithful to you lord we thank you for these things we ask that lord you would meet needs that would be in our lives father that only you know about and father we ask that you would also encourage us strengthen us in this dark dark hour that we're living in we're lord that we can't find any hope at all uh in this world for any kind of comfort lord we're looking to you for that comfort that song is our of the saints had sung the only real peace i have is in you lord may that peace come to the ministry of the word may the healing come lord may the comfort come may all that we have need have come to the word as we believe it lord we commit the service now all of our hearts into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen here in hebrews chapter 2 starting with verse number 1 therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great of salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him amen one more verse and god being and also god also being them bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will amen you may be seated now can i see just a raise of hands of of everyone that's neglected their walk with god in some time okay so the reason i did that is because it's important that that everybody feels at peace that this word that is going to be ministered is not directed at you it's important now we want to hear from god but we don't want to feel like anything's directed at us from the pulpit there's there's a difference now everything that's spoken is is not for you right now for instance if i was to read acts 2 38 uh you need to repent and be baptized well that doesn't mean you got to repent be baptized today because maybe you've already repented and been baptized so a lot of times when we hear the word of god being preached the whole word is for us but it may not be for us for that moment and if we if we catch that um we can really uh bypass the enemy trying to hit us over the head with with certain things amen amen and that's it's really important it's it's it's important uh we need to protect our minds we need to put the helmet of salvation on amen amen the the devil comes to church too amen just connecting with these scriptures a little bit um they may not have much of an impact in the way that we think in other words how can we neglect something that's been given to us free so great of salvation that's been given to us free and it can't be taken away so i don't i don't see how this is really impacting the way i think but i want to ask you do you have salvation and you would say yes i have salvation do you have salvation no matter what you do now this becomes a gray area this becomes a gray area and i just like the angels who kept not their first estate we must maintain our first estate hebrews chapter 3 verse 14 says for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end amen we can't just kind of go you know i started with christ and it's all over no so i asked that question do you have salvation no matter what you do it really becomes a gray area because we want to say oh yeah i do jude chapter 1 verse 5 says i will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the lord having saved the people of the land of egypt afterwards he destroyed them that believed not so they didn't keep their first estate they didn't keep on believing they could all stand and say oh yes god saved me out of the land of egypt but they did not continue to believe god are you with me so far the scriptures teach us that today is the day of salvation not yesterday and not tomorrow jesus said we have to continue in his word and he also said he that endure to the end the same shall be saved so there's something to be said about the question do you have salvation no matter what you do the bible says that that names were taken out of the book of life they were there once but they're taken out and i'm not trying to scare everybody i'm just trying to to take attention to these scriptures here um about neglecting so great a salvation which at the first began to be spoken of the lord and was confirmed unto them that heard not so if angels if the word spoken by angels was steadfast in every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall you and i escape if we neglect a simple little word just neglecting so great of salvation amen paul admonished timothy in first timothy chapter 6 verse 12 to keep fighting the good fight of faith and to lay hold of eternal life well a lot of the attitude that that goes around is i already got eternal life what do i need to hold on to it for what i need to lay hold for i already got it and see what we're doing by this this type of thinking we're taking certain scriptures and they don't dovetail with the other ones everything's got a dovetail together there's got to be a balance to our our our our our belief where aren't you thou art also called and have professed a good profession before many witnesses so we have to keep fighting the good fight of faith therefore we need to to work out our salvation amen we need to keep working on it keep keep keep uh having the reverence and the godly fear that we need in our walk with the lord and not just taking things for granted neglecting our walk with the lord philippians chapter 2 verse 13 says for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure so do all things that he instructs you to do without murmuring and complaining amen in other words we need more fear more reverence more respect because it's so easy to say well i'm safe that's the main thing and i got it and and and nothing else really matters that's being said at the pulpit or anything else i read in the bible or everything else and i'm listening on the tapes therefore i'm just going to listen for tapes just for one certain thing and miss what god's trying to speak all because we're neglecting our walk with the lord therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we've heard lest at any time they we should let them slip notice that as brother branham said you'll find god where you left them we can let things slip we can let our walk slip sometimes we let our tongue slip things can can slip we can let a lot of things slip away from us we can take a lot of things for granted and our walk is certainly one of them the word neglect it means to be careless if you look up that word it means to be careless to make light of to be negligent to pay little attention to disregard to fail to carry out orders or to perform duties it seems like not that big a thing but it's a big thing to god amen neglection is something that we all can be subject to especially in this last age that we're living in of lackadaisical lukewarm things can slip in just about any time people are becoming more relaxed about the things of god amen we might say that believers are becoming more liberal more liberal using their liberty as a cloak for the flesh instead of taking the liberty that god's given them and serve one another amen some are falling away from their own steadfastness you see more and more signs of backsliding we can neglect our walk with god when we take him and his word for granted when we disregard or refuse to follow what he has spoken to us when we pay little attention or we don't take enough he to what god has said when we become careless and or forget about the things that he told us to do last service amen or simply fail to carry out god's orders or perform the duties that he has commanded neglection will hurt us in the long run we can brush it off now but in the long run it will hurt us brother branham said in the message god hiding himself in simplicity said that and then revealing himself in the same he says to refuse to say there's a sunshine is to go into the basement and shut your eyes from the light he said and that's right you remember the only way you can be wrong is first refuse right see to refuse to open your eyes you'll live in darkness see if you refuse to look how you're going to how are you going to see he said watch the simple things he said it's the little things that you leave undone not the big things you're trying to do talking about neglection amen god hiding himself and simplicity reveal himself the same in the message god's only provided place of worship he said that that every little jot every thing you must be faithful in amen it's always a little fox that spoils the vine sometimes you leave it's not the the big things you do it's the little things you leave undone amen he said remember a chain is only as strong as as its weakest link he and he quotes blessed are they that do all the commandments of god that they may that they might have a right to enter in now you take that scripture and it's like oh i can't neglect anything i shouldn't neglect anything that's true now understand that the blood is there for us our mistakes there's a difference between mistakes and neglection right the collection goes apart with an attitude and we might almost say it like this there are churches out there that it don't matter what you do on saturday you just go in or you just go in and and and go and make your little confession and it's over with but the nature never changes right amen and god wants to see a nature change in us amen amen brother brain gives us an example of this and do you now believe he said and in that found uh found the way to divinely healing now he's talking about leaving just some little thing out that's what he's referring to how it makes a difference and if there's something hanging over you some sin you don't confess that you could anoint that person pray for them do everything you want to say well stay right there as long as you've got unconfessed sin in your life or sometimes something that you haven't done something you neglect to do and in there god reveals it if there's anything wrong then you make that right and your healing is complete amen so neglection is is a very important thing amen that's right neglection is not something that we want to be in our our minds of how we view others but really it should be about how you view yourself because it's it's easy to look at others and say well they're obviously neglecting to get to church to get the church on time to pray before service or they're talking in the sanctuary they're out of order they're doing this they're doing that and it's easy to see where other people are neglecting but when we look at the subject of neglection we want to look at that subject with a rake we want to bring our rake to the table amen remember there were two men that went to church to pray one brought the rake one says i'm glad i'm not like this fellow remember the two men that had something in their eye they both had something in their eye but the one that had the biggest problem in their life was the one that was complaining about the other right amen amen so it's not about what somebody else is neglecting it's about what you're neglecting amen what are you neglecting today brother bran says we come to church to find out where we're at with god but the devil has a way of telling us that we're we're okay we're in need of nothing there will always be someone neglecting but just come to church with your rake and you will see what god wants you to take care of that's right now it's very easy to neglect and not even know it one of the shocking things about neglect is that we could have been walking in the will of god at one time and still be found neglecting things that god has told us since then brother branham taught us how that each church age came out of a darkness and they began to walk in a light right and at one time they took heed to the voice of god and they walked in that light but what happened they stopped walking in the light amen they just stopped right there so they neglected to take heed to the things which they heard amen what really slipped was continuing to walk in new light amen because that's just as important they figured they had all that was needed to get by and i'll say it just like this kind of like the foolish virgins they felt they had enough but they neglected to go on and get serious about getting more of the oil right so we don't want to feel so secure from our past light something that god has shown us something where we stand where we feel so secure about that that we're not taking heed to the things that he has told us in other words we need to to fear the lord about everything that he's speaking amen now even though we're thankful for what he's told us in the past we need to keep moving forward we need to continue in the word as jesus said pressing working out this great salvation so great of salvation with fear and trembling amen moving on to perfection taking heed to all the things that we have heard all the things that we're hearing and so we don't just let anything slip we don't want anything to slip right you ever meet somebody who was a real slicker you got to watch this guy he's a real slicker can't let anything get he'll just well we we can't live without the word of god that's right amen men shall live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god amen now it could be the things that we've heard long ago and it could be the things that we heard last service things long ago would be proverbs 22 28 remove not the ancient landmarks which thy fathers have set the word has been spoken this is what the prophet said this is what the prophets have said we don't deviate from that amen and then first john chapter 1 verse 7 for anything recently but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin amen so we just we can't let anything go we don't want to neglect the message of the hour we know that there's no more church ages coming but we could end up doing the same thing that they did we got luther's message we got wesley's message we know it we got brother branham's message we know it and never go on we can't rally behind brother branham like they rallied behind martin luther a lot of people followed brother martin because not just the 95 theses but they didn't like it that the church was taking advantage of their money that made them mad that made riot start you know why riots just kind of what we have today is riots and they got so political about it instead of them just rejoicing that god has set them free with truth they became anti i wonder how many people are in this message they're so anti-denomination they know it's man-made and that's why they they're so against it but had they received the truth of the message this message has come to point us how we can manifest christ not how we can say denominations are so wrong you know people they they say they're in the message but is the message in them is it producing the life that the message is supposed to produce i think they're just satisfied with saying they're in the message and they're neglecting the message itself help us lord we don't want to follow this message like they followed martin luther we don't want to know intellectually that this message is the truth we want to follow the message because the truth is making us free from ourselves amen i got to thinking about this today we're become new creatures in christ jesus how does that happen this word ought to be showing us how to drop this nature and as it drops this nature what happens the seed that we believe in that we rejoice in that we say that we are becomes to light it's already in there but it can't come out as long as this flesh wants to stay around in this word it just uncovers this ugly nature that we are and we learn to die out so the new nature can come forth i think sometimes we just got it backwards we got to shed the old nature so god's nature shines more through us jesus said in john 8 32 and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free the truth makes you free what's that make you free from yourself from your nature from who you have been before you came to christ it's not just the the knowledge of okay i belong to god i'm set free amen supposed to take us to perfection this message jesus never said i am the knowledge he said i am the truth truth makes you free knowledge puffs up amen he never said i was the life he said i am the life he never said i was the way he said i am the way this message is bringing true to us today it's leading and guiding us into all truth people are neglecting the message of the hour that's supposed to be leading and guiding this message is it's to bring us to our isaac it's to prepare us to meet him that's what this message is supposed to be doing if we're not focusing on that when we're listening to the tapes i just wonder because this is the only thing that's going to keep us out of tribulation is this message in this hour it's the only thing and it's not saying i'm in the message it's not saying i claim the message it's taking what this message says and living such an overcoming life which can only be done by the holy ghost we need the oil keep me burning i don't have to go i don't have to go four hours and realize that i need more holy ghost so i had somebody two people two different people telling me this week about um how much wisdom they they see on display but they don't realize every morning i get up and i say lord i need your wisd i need the holy ghost i need you today amen that's the only way we're going to overcome is have the overcomer overcoming inside of a us of things that we can neglect or let slip away and they will affect us a fact so great a salvation the scripture says yes if we don't hold our thoughts accountable if we don't try the spirits amen it'll affect our walk with god if we neglect our thoughts we'll end up neglecting our walk with the lord amen it's important where our thoughts are at a brother marty was saying in our men's meeting he says even the thoughts that we think when we're driving home from church it's important we can neglect to walk to god's house every time the doors are open turn with me to hebrews chapter 10 verse 23. if we are at one point if we were at one point we professed to make a commitment to god i'm gonna i'm gonna go to church every chance i can every time the doors are open i've got this commitment we once made with the lord which we all have right amen amen amen and it's okay if you want to be a little lively it's okay with me verse 23 let us hold fast that profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the matter of psalm is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching consider one another have a burden for one another care for one another amen brother mark said in our men's meeting says we we have to be desperate to get to church and hear from god that's what you saw me writing down brother brahm says you can't wait till those doors are open if that if that's not going on what really is important is that you spend some time getting with god that's right that's it we just got it we got to get back to that because we're letting things slip we're neglecting i tell you you get your your mind out of order your life will get out of order you young things slip in the church the church will get out of order come on we cannot allow neglection to be just a simple minor little thing that don't mean anything it's important for if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for of judgment in the fiery indian nation which shall devour the adversaries he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses notice that we do not want to despise the importance when the bible says forsaking not the assembling of yourselves together and everybody's got excuses there's nobody that comes to me and says you know what brother john i am just not going to come because i'm neglecting nobody does that there's a reason but there's no reason i don't if you're sick and you can't come that's that's i'm not talking about that now but just because you're you're toll aches you gotta had a bad day at work i mean look for reasons to come not for reasons to stay home look at the spirit that's causing that to happen amen now look what happened of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who have trodden under foot the son of god and have counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified at one thing one time and on unholy thing have done despite unto the spirit of grace for we know him that have said vengeance belongeth unto me i will repent recompense saith the lord and again the lord shall judge his people amen i'm so thankful for god's judgment on me amen i'll take his judgment today friends i don't want his judgment after i die i want his judgment today because his judgment today there's mercy there's grace there's a way of escape today i'm okay with the judgments of god today i am not okay with judgment after i leave here so basically this scripture is is saying the same thing as our opening scripture how shall we escape if we neglect so great of salvation we could neglect to remember the things that god wants us to do we can let them slip first corinthians chapter 15 verse 1. moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also you've received and wherein you stand by which you're also saved if if you keep in memory what i preached unto you unless you have believed in vain now that's a powerful scripture right there we need to keep building we need to keep moving forward we need to keep pressing in we need to keep thinking about the things that we heard preached because that's god speaking to us the children of israel did not continue to walk in further light like a lot of believers today they only want to come out of egypt but they don't want to they don't want to suffer to get the holy ghost they don't want to have uh they don't want to believe on two getting the holy ghost they don't want to press towards their promise or what god promised them because they weren't interested in taking a chance with their life they'd rather serve god outside where there was no battles where they didn't have to die out to the enemy they were afraid they were afraid of dying that's why they wouldn't go in there and take the promised land they were afraid of dying what's wrong with the believers today that won't get the holy ghost they're afraid of dying it's true the giants are to what i'm not going to have control anymore don't neglect it don't neglect the holy ghost god wants to give it to us more than we could possibly want it amen we don't want to neglect so great of salvation we don't want to neglect our walk with the lord why why is it that people neglect they don't want to cope with the word they want to cope with the rest of the word they just want to be saved and don't bother me about anything else they don't have to really love one another we can neglect to love one another jesus said because iniquity is abounding in this age the love of many is waxing cold that's right we can become critical and and judgmental of one another so easy brother branham said in the message hear ye him he said he's the one what we need today brother sister is more real genuine christian love displayed displayed among believers now how do i display love right jesus said i can't do it to those that love me she said no no reward on that i gotta wait till i'm not being loved and then i can display real genuine love he said that's what causes separation in families is the neglect of love amen that's what causes the separation in churches a neglect of love he says we've got to have love amen we can neglect to serve one another as jesus taught us to wash one another's feet to bear one another's burden and to restore those who have been overtaken in a fault yes amen i mean we need to start exercising these things because they're not gifts they're not gifts you just you got to have a love for god a love to help and you got to be willing to get dirty and and and and make mistakes and there's one way you're going to learn is get get down there and practice serving one another we can neglect to win souls for jesus we need to labor till jesus takes us home we can neglect his presence and take the holy spirit for granted we can neglect to worship the lord in the spirit and basically just give them the leftovers at the end of the day but the brahms said in the message hebrews chapter 2 he says certainly how shall we escape if we neglect such if you neglect to eat you'll die if you neglect to turn a corner you'll wreck if you neglect to milk the cow she'll go dry you neglect your teeth you'll have to have them all pulled out certainly you pay for your neglection he said oh brother he said old branham tabernacle and you visitors let me tell you something now you neglect to testify of the glory of god you neglect to give god the praise and glory and you'll find yourself cold formal backslidden one of these days you give god praise how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation amen amen amen there's more to this than just a decision you made years ago when you gave your heart to god our walk includes a lot doesn't it we can neglect the office that god has ordained to take us through we can neglect to pay god's tithes we can neglect to pay tribute unto whom tribute is due to appreciate and to become uh thankful more thankful we know there's a spirit in this age where people are neglecting and they're literally they're labeled as unthankful people selfish to all get out we don't want to take the ministry that god has given us here for granted has nothing to do with me it has to do everything with god now i'm not saying say thank you what i'm saying is be thankful amen and learn to appreciate more what god has given amen because you can neglect to be thankful to the lord we can like the word being preached the realness of the word the word is alive it's here we can neglect to reverence that word amen god is speaking to us through the word we can neglect praying for the most important thing which is revelation when the word is being preached i'm so thankful that when i came to this message i was not um enticed to believe a dozen different pastors i mean at our church brother bruce you know this we had a lot of preachers probably one of the most at that time and to me it was there was a continuity and a a uh it was establishing me the word established me and what i loved about it is i wasn't tossed here and there the problem with going in a thousand different directions it's hard to anchor in any of them somewhere down the line you just got to settle things between you and god and the scripture tells us there's a lot of voices out there there's only one that matters now if i'm in a room and i gotta listen say i gotta listen to brother mark i'm gonna have a better chance hearing him if there's not a hundred other people in that room talking at the same time i think brother marty was talking about i'm not like some people that can listen to music and study at the same time i got to have everything off and focusing on what i'm listening to what i'm reading what i'm paying attention to to me is eliminate the voices and just hear ye him amen hear him because he loves you wants to take care of you and your focus has to be just that brother ram said in the message hebrews chapter 2 again he said what does that he says a lot of time it's weak pulpits that's right so this one could be for me let's say this one's for me said that's right get down and bring the gospel truth we're going to have to answer for that in the days to come we must not neglect anything and the people as we are here at branham tabernacle to see the signs and wonders and the powers of the resurrection resurrected christ and then to know that we would place our times upon other things and neglect to hear the voice of the lord jesus he said how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation amen well i don't want the reason for us neglecting to be because of the weakness of this pulpit i'd rather a billion miles get in trouble for preaching too hard amen paul said i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation yes to everyone that believeth to the jew first and then also to the greek and he said in acts 20 verse 26 wherefore i take to you i take you to record this day i am pure from the blood of all men amen for i have not shunned to declare unto you the whole council of god now we could neglect to believe the word that's being preached the the thought that at any time when i'm listening to a tape reading the bible and i come across something that starts dealing with me to not want that to not want to allow that to deal with me there's something wrong with my spirit i'm neglecting god dealing with me are you with me amen brother branham said that we could neglect to even thirst after the word right he said in the message thirsty says i want you to see another great danger just before we close if you're not guilty of any of these things that i've mentioned and that is the danger of neglecting a thirst see i have a holy thirst but i'm not guilty brother branham i'll just go and join in the church and things like this but c to neglect a thirst if you neglect to satisfy a thirst of water or food you will die if you neglect to thirst in you for god you will spiritually die that's right amen you call for revival as you wait for your church to have a revival well there ain't the revival for you he said that ain't the revival for you the revival ought to begin right in you amen when you begin to thirst for god amen there might not be another member of the church wanting that revival if it breaks out of you it'll break out of other places see but you you neglect that thirst so if there's a deep calling yo this churches should be on fire there should be more happening oh there's there should be more people there should be more people praying there should be there should just be more that thought that you're dealing with means god wants it to start with you right that's what that quote's telling me amen he says again you you neglect to milk the cow uh the other is full of milk when others for milk if you let that cow stay like that she'll go dry that's exactly right if you neglect to take a drink of water i just ain't gonna drink anymore he says you'll die you neglect to eat food you'll die if you neglect to give the holy spirit the word of god you'll die if you neglect to give the holy spirit inside of you the word of god that's coming if you don't unite with that you'll die spiritually is what he's saying amen i want to be alive amen so if you neglect to feed the holy spirit the word of god jesus said every word shall be by the holy spirit and listen now if you try to feed it with the wrong things if it's the genuine holy spirit in you you'll know the difference now remember the word of god is what the holy spirit feeds on amen he says it don't feed on enthusiasm it don't feed on education it doesn't feed on church going it doesn't feed on theologies there's a lot of difference between inspire something and a theological standpoint of it you could be under the inspiration of the word but if you come into church with a theological spirit with a a spirit of just not inspired to hear the word you're looking what are what's most the allowed theologians look for they they and they will argue they will debate they will prove what's right in their mind and they will go at it because you're looking to prove their point but we just come because we don't know where we're at with god we're just lambs we're sheep lord show me where i'm at show me i don't even know my own heart i think i'm right now if we come into church like this we're going to get further along with god right amen because we're going to hear the voice of god now i want to commend every one of you that believe that god is in control in this church i want to commend you first thessalonians chapter 2 verse 11 as you know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father doth his children that she walk worthy of god who have called you into his kingdom and glory for this cause also thank we god without ceasing now without ceasing because when you receive the word of god which he heard of us he received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which effectually worketh also in you that believe that's right you want the word to work in your life believe it's from god and not from john martin it won't work in you if you just well it's it's just john's point of view and this is what he's trying to do and you know it's just not going to work in you because the word of god is life jesus said my words are spirit and they are life and that life's gonna come inside of you and quicken you because that's what we live by we live by the quicken word we don't live by the dead letter i understand that this minister right here he's not always jumping from one side of the pulpit to the other and and doing all the things that some evangelists do it's okay the word's still inspired i'll tell you when jesus preached he didn't preach like that either brother brandon said he was very calm very calm it was still the inspired word amen you understand what i'm saying he has a fivefold ministry he has all different types of trees and all different types of flowers and all different types of ministers and they're all god amen the inspiration is not how it's delivered the inspiration is is it from god at that moment is a spiritual food in due season for your soul because god is the god of now amen what do i tell them i am that i am that's right now i was i am not i will be i am we're what the god of i am today i don't want to get healed a month from now i want to get healed today i don't want to wait a month from now to get forgiven to get delivered today i want god today god is here today i want to commend you for believing that god is in control we can neglect to believe hebrews chapter 4 verse 2 says for unto us was the gospel preaches wells unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so we could sit in church hear the word of god and not mix it with that's for me that's for me amen lord i want what's for me we can neglect our faith we can neglect to fight the good fight of faith we can neglect to seek him diligently we could neglect to contend for our faith just think that it's always there well i know i got a lot of muscles in my body that when i don't exercise them when i finally decide to use them they hurt i've always viewed painting as something that just you know anybody can do don't need muscles don't don't need you don't need anything just simple well if you ever painted for a good many hours and a day you will feel the next day amen soar because you're not used to using those muscles amen and if you don't use your faith if you're not fighting the good fight of faith with every little thought with every little situation you can become weak jude verse 3 says beloved when i gave all diligence to write into the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the saints what's wrong with laodicea need of nothing i don't need i don't need to contend for nothing i'm bright i'm going they're blind from even seeing what they've neglected they've been so schooled by the enemy that the only thing that'll open their eyes is the have of god they got to come with a heart lord help me to see what i don't see brother brandon makes some comments we need to pinch our conscience the bible says we need to wake out of our sleep pray through into the spirit shake ourselves for the random said do something to sober us up from our condition of not being okay with letting things slack off letting things be neglected the small things that we're leaving undone in one sense that is the beginning of iniquity is not doing the things that we know we should be doing i want to end with some quotes here from brother branham he said in the book of hebrews chapter 3 he said our religion is not in vain it's absolutely the resurrected jesus christ same thing now he says you mustn't neglect it now just don't go away from church today and say well i kind of enjoyed going down there i like the singing and the people are friendly around that little old church he says don't you do that he says brother your heart let your heart become a flame yes amen say here i got to do something about this i got to get out and see if i can get somebody saved if we're not going to that extreme brother branham just said we're neglecting we're neglecting our religion amen he said in the same series hebrews chapter 5 and 6 he said oh in that great hour of darkness and chaos over the earth we could say that's even today we should be this goes along with brother bruce's message to us he says we should be the happiest people in the whole earth to rejoice to know all the time when people are in documentated documented and all kinds of isms and the things on the earth and yet today the real living god by the word and his visible evidence shows us that he is here with us that's right amen amen working moving living acting just as he always did he said what a privileged people that we are to have this amen he says we should hold fast to these things because how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation we have been treasured here with the word and i think maybe part of the problem is we don't treasure it enough remember it is not for everybody but it is for the bride amen in chapter two brother rhymes says it behooves us not to neglect this great salvation for we'll have to give an account someday what we'll do with the son of god amen he's on your hand tonight you sinner you backslider what are you going to do with him you say well i'll put it all he says but remember don't you do that there's no way at all if you're a sinner that you can leave this building and be the same he says you can't do it in god's provided way he says i i don't believe that there's ever been a man or a woman that's ever walked into a church or come into the presence of god without they were given an invitation to this supper now it says you can take it or turn it down that's up to you think about that a man or woman has never walked into a church come into the presence of god without god giving them an invitation how good our god is some people goes to church year after year day after day revival after revival and still will not accept the invitation they don't mean to turn it down he says but they just neglect doing it but still neglection will take you where you don't want to go right he says did you notice one had he's referring to the parable now where the invitation went out and they came back with excuses he says and did you notice one had said some they had something to do he bought a piece of ground the other one bought some ox and he must try them not like he wouldn't try the ox before he bought them you see he it was just an excuse yes and i know that all you ministers and so forth and businessmen track workers and so forth you all find those things people got excuses i've just got to stay home tonight i can't attend the revival just remember god said they do that they're turning down their invitation now let's look at it again one said he'd he did this his wife wouldn't let him come and that's another excuse there should be nothing stand between us and that invitation that's right if it costs a yolk of oxen or your business or your wife or your children or anything nothing should separate us from that invitation amen so how does the devil get them to do that the devil gets them to say well i'm still saved even though i don't go god's called you to the harvest field amen or to do something for him there should be nothing stand between you and god it must come first the invitations given out i believe that was the last thing that he commissioned his disciples to do to go ye out into all the world let's stand together it'll be worth it all i believe the scriptures tells us that the sufferings of this present time now of course this is for those that don't make excuses for those who don't neglect the word it's harder it's the harder way he said the sufferings of this present time is not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us so there is such a reward for those that are willing to put god first god has given us i'll say so great of salvation it's worth everything that we have to do for god it's worth everything right now if god never did another thing for us would he owe us something you think about these people that are in the world that don't know god and we've heard them say well if god was really god he wouldn't have allowed this person to die or that person to die he wouldn't allow me to lose my job my marriage my house and they feel that god owes them but in reality god paid the greatest price he could pay at calvary he paid for everything there he owes me nothing he owes me no excuse or no god don't give excuses he he doesn't owe me any reason for anything right but i owe him everything amen god wants us to take a look at these things that we heard tonight everything that was said was not said because of what's going on in your life but perhaps there were things spoken that god is wanting you to take heed to so that the word that he has given you the promises of his word that he's given you would not slip because we need all the word yes amen let's follow our hearts in a word of prayer i want to say to each of you that are live streaming and listening do you believe with all your heart our god is he's a serious god he's he's jealous over us and he wants us to pay attention to all the word i want to invite you to the the mind of god concerning his word just ask in your heart is there anything that perhaps you've been neglecting is there anything just say lord reveal it to me show me lord help me that i would not neglect anything that you want me to take heed to hold on to it believe all that you have given me amen heavenly father we want to thank you for your word tonight i want to thank you for the realness of your word tonight and how your word is real to us personally lord whether it comes over the form of a of a

of the word lord that we might be the bride in this hour without spot without wrinkle getting ready for your soon coming lord how do we know the the world is just in filtering our minds with so much
