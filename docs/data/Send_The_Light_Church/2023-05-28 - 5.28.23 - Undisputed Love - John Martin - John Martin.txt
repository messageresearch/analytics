in Jesus Christ precious name amen amen praise the Lord let's give the Lord a hand clapping I believe he answers prayer amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of First Timothy chapter 1 First Timothy chapter one for our opening scripture I want to welcome brother Gordon and sister Dorothy this morning Paige God bless you we've we've talked with them a little bit a couple years ago or so and um brother Daryl ward has been as far as I understand pretty faithful to come out and visit visit you folks and I'm not sure are you a minister brother you're not a minister okay well brother Daryl we all know brother Daryl and um he's just been there to be a blessing to them like he has been to us amen so we we want to welcome him this morning both of them in the house of the Lord amen may the Lord bless you as her is our sincere prayer amen also um brother Daniel Darko wanted me to greet you this morning and again brother Gideon he's a faithful faithful one to say please greet the Saints for us so we're thankful for the the ministry of the fivefold ministry amen all right starting here at First Timothy chapter one verse number one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the Commandment of God Our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ which is Our Hope unto Timothy my own son in the faith so this is real personal grace mercy and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ Our Lord as I besought Thee to abide still in Ephesus when I went to Macedonia that thou might as charge some that they teach no other Doctrine neither give heed to Fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than golly edifine which is in faith so do so so Timothy is being instructed now the end of the Commandment is charity I don't think there's any question with that do you shouldn't be any questions without the end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscious and of faith unfeigned from which some having swerved have turned aside from the end of the Commandment unto vain jangling Desiring to be teachers of the law and understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm but we know that the law is good if a man uses it lawfully God bless you may be seated amen we want to entitle this message Undisputed love and for a subject I want to talk about obeying the end of the law as Christ fulfilled the law and came and died for us leaving us an example that we are to to fulfill the end of the Commandment of the law and help others and I want just in Simplicity want to provoke us to focus on uh an opportunity that we all have to love during the hardest times um Christ did it for us and I believe if Christ is living in US we should be able to do it for others and too often we set aside the most important thing and we go on to I don't want to say vain janglings but we depart from the most important thing now the end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart now before Christ came into our lives we've viewed um the Bible reviewed God and we were taught by our mom and dad good and bad and we realized that we were in big trouble if we didn't get salvation because we weren't able to be good Romans 3 verse 10 says as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after the god they have all gone out of their way they are together become unprofitable and there's none that doeth good no not one for their throat is an open scepter and there are tongues they have used deceit the poison of ass is under their lips whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness their feet are Swift to shed blood destruction and misery in their ways and the way of peace they have not known there's no fear of God before their eyes and now we know that what things so ever the law saith it says to them that are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and that the world may become guilty before God amen therefore by the Deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in the sight in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin so when we knew the truth it just brought condemnation to us it brought a con a conviction and a condemnation because we were wrong and and inside of us we we just couldn't get it right so I used to think of the Old Testament as as just the law in the New Testament was was like Grace I used to think we didn't have to listen to the law anymore because Grace had come I used to think that I I could have Liberty to basically do whatever I want now because I'm under grace I'm no longer under the law I used to think God's grace was a a game changer for my flesh gave me liberty to do what I want I don't have to listen to anybody anymore I don't have to do what they want me to do that I'm a free man I've been set free and I have Liberty are you with me isn't it amazing how the devil takes God's word and twists it bad I don't have to listen to anybody anymore it was like using my Liberty for a cloak for my flesh but that was just carnal understanding [Music] Psalms 19 verse 7 says the law of the Lord is perfect it is so good it converts the soul the law of the Lord will convert the soul and if it wasn't for God's law none of us would be here today none of us would be saved God's law is filled with love because God is love you can't separate and if we love him we will continue to keep his Commandments yet the law when it was presented to us it condemned us because it proved that we were sinners going straight to hell but God fulfilled his own law and provided away back for us he didn't do away with it he fulfilled it and this is what is on my heart and I'll just say it like this I we've had some ministering Brothers I'd just been sitting back taking my time studying and I just thought this is going to be wonderful I got my message and then two days ago when I was praying in the morning it was a completely different subject and I'll tell you the burden that's on my heart is that we need to learn how to love like God loves [Music] we need to know how to handle life the way that God handled life I mean this was a serious thing coming down to the Earth and given his own life on the cross that we could be saved the least that we could do is laid on our life for others the very least we could do there's a part of the law of God's Commandment that is often overlooked in its Undisputed love agape love it's the end of the Commandment it's charity out of a pure heart there's that part of the the word the Commandment that we're supposed to follow that is often overlooked Romans 10 tells us for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth Christ is the end of the law for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that was the end of the Commandment that he came and he fulfilled the law he didn't just say you're guilty you're guilty you're guilty and leave you there in that mess and so often we look at others you're guilty you're guilty and we just kind of like leave it go and we leave out the most important thing which is which is Charity go meet the need go help the situation God hasn't called us to be Christians to sit back and say look at all the problems he's called us to meet the need Romans 8 verse 3 tells us for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh see we were too weak to do the right thing so God came and he took care of it for us and now that we're filled with God when we see others that are too weak to be following the word that Christ should come and be manifested out of your life and help meet the need not talk about it not just roll over in your mind and allow the devil just to keep planting negativity about the situation but let the end of the Commandment rise up inside of you and go meet the need because that's what a true Christian is the Fallen nature of man was too weak to fulfill the law of God but God never abolished the law and he never led us off the hook either he went and fulfilled the law so as we sit there and we look at others and we say there's a need there and they should be and they should know better and they should be doing it and how long have they been a Christian and we sit there and we have thoughts like that I say to you when are we going to let Christ inside of us go and fulfill the law and help them it's not about us sitting and and judging everybody and and and saying where everybody is lacking you don't even have to be spiritual all you got to do is listen to The Devil he's the accuser of the brother but it when it takes a spiritual person to rise up above the problem and go meet the need like a Christian does don't even have to talk about just go do it because that's what Christ did he abolished you from having to pay the penalty of your sin by paying it himself he abolished us from being trapped in a nature that couldn't find its way out of a what paper bag Ephesians 2 if you want to turn with me there Ephesians 2 . foreign this pretty much sums it up that at that time verse 12 that at that time ye were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope and without God in the world I remember that feeling as sh is clear and I couldn't go to my dad to my mom I mean I tried I went to a Catholic praise I tried but I'll tell you I was without hope because I didn't see Christ there but when you get serious with God God will get serious with you because God is truly interested in all of your heart he's interested in taking the throne room of your heart but now in Christ Jesus ye were ye who were sometimes were afar off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who have made both one and have broken down the middle wall partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in the ordinance for to make in himself of Twain one new person so making peace see Christ fulfilled what the law required he fulfilled the law of Commandments he went and paid the penalty so we didn't have to he didn't do away with the law he fulfilled the law and now that same God that did that at Calvary lives inside of us he's just as real just as powerful inside of us as he was on the cross and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slam the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh for through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the father now therefore you're no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone now look what should be happening in a church in whom all the body fitly framed together growth unto a holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit that's why when we see things going on or things happening it could just be one-on-one or or or or anything if you begin to see confusion we need to be immediately praying because God is not the author of confusion he is the author of building his building so he can work Mighty things in his body it was God's Undisputed love that brought us back into fellowship with him and I'll tell you that's the same thing he ought to be doing inside of every one of us is bringing us back into Fellowship one with another and any spirit that doesn't do that I say get away from it you if you don't stand against it that means the enemy can use you now so you've got to recognize it in your thoughts Christ did not do away with his law but he fulfilled it himself because we couldn't he provided a way back for each of us Matthew chapter 5 verse 17. Jesus said think not that I come to destroy the law or the prophets I am not come to destroy it but to full fill it to fulfill it so I want you to put yourself in Jesus's shoes now he had the burden of the whole world on his shoulders and he he loved the whole world and he knew many would be would reject him but it didn't stop him from loving from giving and and when you are faced with problems in life usually they have to do what somebody usually they have to do what somebody you put a face even if you got a problem with a bank you put a face to that bank right it's usually a somebody now here's the thing and I'm mainly talking amongst us as Christians but it's our family as well now are you going to fulfill the law or are you going to do away with part of the law and bring judgment because see to accept the law to accept the word to obey the word is love and to reject the end of the Commandment which is Charity of a pure heart is to accept judgment love proceeds judgment Mercy rejoices over judgment and we we're always thinking about what is right what is wrong and and this that should be done and that should be done and we're missing being able to fulfill the law of God in our life it's like to me problems present opportunities for Christ to be magnified and too often we sit there talking I say it's vein jaggling you know trying to describe what we think is right or wrong well we don't even need help doing that the devil tells us that but what we're looking for is Christ manifested Christ manifested in Me God coming in me and manifest charity yeah now I need a spiritual heart to understand what I'm saying I'm not saying ignore the problem I'm not saying being a pushover I'm not saying putting blinders on I'm saying rolling up your sleeves get your hands dirty get down on your knees and help the situation if we can't do that if we can't do it zip the lip and then get on your knees go and pray until God fills you with him because he knows how to handle the problem he did it at Calvary if he could do it at Calvary he can do it today if he's he's the same yesterday today and forever if we believe this message this message should be living in US no wonder the prophet said whatever you do lay everything aside until you go get perfect love because that is the Fulfillment of the law right amen the Fulfillment all right think not that I come to destroy law or the prophets that come not to destroy but to fulfill Verse 18 for verily I say unto you till Heaven and Earth shall pass away one jot or one Tittle shall in what no Wise from the law passed from the law to all be fulfilled God would not go through time on Earth without fulfilling the law he just could not let his own die he couldn't no more could you let your children die God could not let his children die but his own children could not find a way to perfectly please God because their nature was bad to begin with they had to be born again now the thing is we're dealing with others all the time with Cockapoo Natures with a black dog and a white dog and there's there's problems associated with people and this is providing an opportunity for Christ to live in US because I'll tell you this Christ does not look down on us and say oh look at brother John he's so smart he knows he knows what's right no I believe the Holy Ghost wants to see Christ Living Through Me living it out his word will not return unto him void the law is important to God and he expects us to fulfill it right right look at verse 19. just think about our attitude right now whosoever therefore shall break one of these what's that next word least Commandments and shall teach men to do the same he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven can you imagine would you like to go to heaven and be called the least you're the least because you thought some of God's word was not that big a deal it you don't referencing the sanctuary I mean and then you're going to teach that same thing well look that's just a little overboard I mean just what are you doing what are you doing God sent a prophet to make it clear what we should be doing [Music] right and our attitudes could keep us away from the word of God if we look at the word we start dissecting what's important what's not important what we got to pay attention to what the prophet said what we don't what we're doing is we're we're believing and teaching that it's not that big a deal how is God looking at that but whosoever shall do and teach them the same Shall be Called great in the Kingdom of Heaven so if you get that attitude well that's okay if I don't help it's okay if I don't go the second amount it's okay if I don't turn the chi it's okay it's okay God understands foreign for I say unto you that accept your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees you shall no case enter the kingdom of heaven well Jesus said unless you have faith as a child you can't enter in so you've got to have faith as a child to enter in and now your righteousness has to exceed the righteousness of the of the Pharisees don't belittle the Pharisees don't be be little someone don't downgrade some believer make sure you're doing all they're doing and more don't be a despiser of those that are trying harder than you just because you don't want to try look Jesus expects you to do that and more of course our motives have to be right don't want to have a mode of wrong motive when we do it we want to fast we want to pray we want to seek God we just heard a wonderful sermon about we need to be hungering and thirsting after God panting after God like a deer pan and for the water Brook Jesus didn't do away with the law he fulfilled it and the end of the law is love and Grace brought it to us for God so loved the world that he gave to meet our need and that was the Fulfillment of the law the Bible says where sin abounded Grace did much more abound so when you come into a situation and somebody's not happy about something or you're not happy about something is Grace going to much more abound are you going to let grace abound through you are you going to let love abound through you are you going to hold it to yourself and say this love is for me well what happens when you do that you're not living for others you're not you're not expressing eternal life eternal life is living for others the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ we should all be manifesting more and more of Christ should we not every week goes by every month that goes by every year we should be seeing more and more of Christ to whom much is given much time is given much is required right John 1 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and full of Truth notice what comes first Grace then truth don't think it's you know if we spent more time being gracious towards others than than trying to prove that somebody else is wrong we'd probably get more accomplished amen John bear witness of him and Christ saying this was he of whom I spake he cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of now I want you to catch this end of his fullness have all we received and Grace for Grace have you received his fullness you know Jesus said judge not that you be not judged Jesus said he that's without sin Let Him cast the first stone so I just say this to us have we received his fullness or have we just received a part you know because the Pharisees were very quick to judge others they were also very quick to say that they were more special than others and they were able to you know this is why this is why but we need to be full of grace let your conversation always be with Grace coupled with fear the Bible says if we have received the spirit of Christ then people should be able to Behold a life full of grace and truth when the word was made flesh in you it will fulfill when the word is made flesh in you it will fulfill the Commandment of God it will it will bring about the end of the Commandment which is Charity out of a pure heart and that should be your goal God let me not leave here without a determination that when things aren't going right that charity is manifested it's okay I believe it's okay to judge I do I just I've just never I've always kind of like held that in I've really never told you I think it's okay to judge yourself you want to exercise judgment judge yourself but with others do what Christ did he judges nothing before its time and he hasn't judged anybody yet there's a Time coming for that and really all judgment belongs to him anyways what are we going to go go we're going to go to God and say look what he did to me look what she did to me look what they did to me look what they said to me look they knife me in the back they said this they did that God won't you do something that's the same thing Satan does the same thing he's the accuser of the brethren that God is looking for us to be full of grace hey if we can't forgive others we're in trouble we're in big trouble if we can't forgive others but this isn't so much about forgiving others this is about being able to go and fulfill the law to to for you not to look at somebody and say they're missing it when the moment that you're doing that you're missing it you're not you're not bringing about the Fulfillment of God's commandment in your life which is to go meet that need I want sin to abound in US much more when there's a problem going happening it's an opportunity to say God you're still on the throne you're still in my heart you still Reign you still got power to take care of this situation you know a lot of times we're so full of fear we don't know what to do but you know what if you just believe in the reality of God in your life God will use you to help that situation we encounter a lot of problems in our homes and in our church any amends on that and oftentimes we feel unequipped to handle them we kind of uh just ignore it right well I tried you know are you with me but you know we're we're pretty quick to point out somebody's fault so we're not really lacking in that maybe talk about somebody's sins or wrong Spirit or their carnality or their ugly nature that's that's being coming about and so for some of us the story just seems to end there with our conclusion of some verbal judgment and then it's done but sometimes we'll even talk negatively about it to others that happens in our homes in our church come on but very Southern do we notice that there's more grace abounding in the situation than the problem very sound do we see abounding grace and somebody rising up to just can to help the situation it's like where is the faith that God is in you it's an opportunity Paul said to the Roman church but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your moral bodies by the spirit that dwells in you now we know what Christ would do if we were in sin he would go to Calvary he would go help he would lay down his life so if Christ in US is living in US is will he not do the same thing it's got to be more than a form of godliness there's got to be a Living Word a Living Word brother Branham says it's not the action but the reaction that counts how are we going to react are we going to react with love and Grace are we going to react in the flesh now this has happened so many times in her life has it not it should cause us to ask questions to ourselves have we received enough Holy Spirit to supply Grace that's needed for our problem just a simple question it ought to calls us because look it doesn't take money it doesn't take Fame doesn't take Fortune it takes the Holy Ghost [Music] that's all it takes the Holy Ghost I understand the law of the word and I understand that they shouldn't have done it I understand that but we have received the Fulfillment of the law so we can go help meet their need but ask the question have I received enough Christ to see the situation through have I received the end of the Commandment which is Charity out of a pure heart have I received enough Holy Spirit to get my hands dirty or am I just going to kind of slip out of the church am I just going to kind of avoid do you want the Holy Ghost to avoid you when you got a problem do you want him to say oh we're getting away from them because you know no no but why why would why would you think the Holy Ghost in you would have a different attitude I'll say it like this how long will you let the devil convince you there's nothing you can do to help them man how long are you going to let the devil say to you well God's just got to speak to their heart it's all in God's hands well what are your hands for that what are your feet for what's your mouth for I mean grace needs to be abounding through us when are we going to rise up and believe that God the god that dwells in this is also capable of helping the situation it's like you got to put your the money where your mouth is at it's easy to say I'm in the message I'm a Believer how about just saving some of that energy and living it out come on it's time for us to to manifest Undisputed love it's time for us to rise up and let Grace more abound in the situation than the problem it's like we don't know what to do when there's a problem how are we going to overcome if we don't know what to do just get your hands dirty get in there fall fail make a mistake but do something do something show that you love show them that you love amen show them that you care show them that you believe in grace show them that you believe in forgiveness show them that that you believe at the end of the Commandment is Charity out of your Pure Heart yes amen because all we're doing is we're just being a Pharisee if we don't fulfill the word it's a modern message Pharisee now I know that's not making you you know be excited about the message but I just need us to understand that that we need to be doing what this message says and not just listening to the message to get out the parts that we enjoy the real message is Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if he's not going to be manifested in me at the time of the rapture what good is it going to do it wouldn't be good it would if I could prove to 90 percent of the message Believers that I was literally better than them what could would it do if I don't fulfill the word of God so it doesn't matter if I'm better or you're worse what really matters is that I I love God enough to try to help you and that you love God enough to try to help me that's what matters John chapter 12 verse 46 . I am come a light into the world of that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness and if any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not I came not to judge the world but to save the world and let me ask you a question has has God judged the world yet yeah why would we be doing it why would we be stepping in the only judgment that's taking place is in the bride of Christ who judge themselves who allow God to come in and judge himself that's the Judgment that's taking place but there's no Force judgment happening there is a conviction knocks on the heart of God when he speaks on a heart hey go make that thing right go say I'm sorry go say I forgive you go pray with that person verse 48 he that rejecteth me and receiveth my words has one that judge him well when's that going to happen the word that I've spoken the same shall judge him in the last day for I have not spoken of myself but the Father which sent me he gave me a commandment what I should say and what I should speak and I know that his commandment his life Everlasting whatsoever I speak therefore even as the father of spoken so I speak the Fulfillment of the law is love but the rejection of the law is judgment brother Branham told us that when love is projected Sovereign Grace will take over how many is inter how many would love that God would use you all the time to speak things into existence wouldn't that be awesome oh well we could tell people about it you know what I mean but don't you want to see love projected out of you does Sovereign Grace could just take over the situation well the end of the Commandment is charity amen you know one of the prophets said whatever you do go go get perfect love lay everything aside until you get it it's not just a fine quote that we can think about once in a while it's to whomsoever will receive that and I believe the bride is going to catch that and they're going to play aside other things until they get it God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in our sins have quickened us together with Christ by grace are ye saved now Jesus wants to see the same thing in US he wants to use our body he don't care what we look like he don't care how old we are he don't care about her shape our size he don't care about our age he don't care about our intelligence he doesn't care what we know in fact the less you know the better chance because it takes so much to empty out and he wants to take your vessel and he wants you show others how to handle problems how to function together how to be fitly joined together how to build together we don't even have to agree we just got to have the right The Same Spirit yeah yeah God will take care of the disagreements he'll see us through now this is the god that I believe in this is the god that we serve this is the god that is calling us to mature because we hide behind this I'm right and they're wrong like who cares who cares I don't care if you're right I don't care if I'm wrong but I do care that you help me I do care that you care enough to help me that you that you're willing to lay down your time your pride get some clothes of humility on and come and help me pray with me see me through really may not see I but we should see heart to heart as the prophet taught us my all right Hebrews now how is he going to do this Hebrews 8 verse 10. one verse for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their minds and write them into their hearts and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people God doesn't do away with the law he doesn't want us to do away with the law in fact he'll put it so strong in us that we will literally go late on our life we will present our bodies a Living Sacrifice that we may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen that's the god that we serve John 14 verse 15 says if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray that the father will he shall give you another comfort that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth in the world it cannot receive it can't do this it can't love it can't love the way God loves amen it can't love undisputedly because it see of him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelt with you and shall be in you now if we can just catch that catch that we all believe that Christ lives in us and we should but we should be believing that he should be able to manifest full love through us and that's what we need to be believing unto and you you can spend a lot of time in prayer but if you're never put in a situation to see where you're at you're not going to know what you really got [Music] [Applause] so Trials Come things come and they prove where you're at you think they prove where the other person's at but it proves really where you're at because God will use just about anything to offend you even Jesus called that woman a dog I mean there'd probably be some women in them this message church that would probably slap a man who said that to him God will allow things to happen God is looking for you to see where you're at how are you going to react Verse 18 he says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you see how often we find ourselves in problems and it leaves us an uncomfortable feeling can you believe what just happened can you just can't you they said do the they they didn't shake my hand whatever it might be and you feel alone you feel like something's missing he said I will not leave you comfortless great peace have they that love my love and nothing shall offend them that you talk about Comfort that's comfort praise the Lord how many loves the word all right verse 19 yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because I live ye shall live also and at that day you shall know that I'm in the father and ye and me and I in you and he that have my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and shall be law and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and manifest myself to him you ever notice why some people they can't love but other people can both Christians both believers there it is right there Judah saith unto him not as scary Lord how was it that thou will manifest thyself to us and not to the world Jesus answered and said unto him if a man loves me he will keep my words yes and my father will love him and he will come unto him and make our Abode with him the love of God is shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Ghost the more you receive the Holy Ghost the more you'll better manifest the love the more of the knowledge of the word that you receive the knowledge of the word I'm talking about the tree of knowledge the less you will be enticed to manifest the word we should be more interested in receiving the Life of Christ than hearing something we've never heard before too often a part of the word is missing when I watch people which you can't help but all the time you watch things and you're you're looking to see Christ manifested and it just seems like people know but they're missing it in their their hearts they got in their heads but not their hearts Jesus said in John 13 34 a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you don't don't love one another as they love you that's that's not it that you love one another as I have loved you that means unconditional that ye also love one another and by this by this by this Undisputed Love by this unconditional without respect to persons no matter what happens I will restore by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one for another I'm not satisfied with what I have [Music] I know there's more for me because the Bible tells me there's more for me and so I want to spend the rest of my life pressing towards that because I know there's a pressure coming things are going to happen in our lives and the devil God we're going to be tried and we're going to be put to the spot where you are all alone and either Christ is going to come out or whatever else is on the inside [Music] John said and now I beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which ye have had from the beginning we love that we love one another so Jesus said a new commandment and John's saying well it's really not a new commandment it's the one that we've had from the beginning now the end of the Commandment is charity the part that we don't think about I I understand that there's people that are are missing it and they're doing and they're saying but you know God is looking for you to rise up and fulfill you're part of the word there's so much turn with me to Matthew Chapter 5 so much that we're going to have to just miss you know I like it when I'm studying and you probably don't when I'm studying and I only got just a few scriptures I feel so good that's the time I really want to like start because the more time I have to study the more I study the more stuff I get and then and then it really makes it hard to fit it all in I always covet your prayers Matthew chapter five starting with verse 43 ye have heard that have been said that thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy so here's the law you've heard the law on eye for an eye tooth for tooth but that's not the end of the law okay so Jesus goes on but I say unto you love your enemy bless then that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them to despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be called that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh the son to rise on the evil and the good and sinneth rain and the just and the unjust so God wants us to be just like him now you can't do this under until there's a problem you literally cannot manifest as part of the Commandment until there's a problem you can't just say well everything's going good I just love everybody that don't work you don't really know what a tea bag is until it gets in hot water and then when it gets in hot water you can really taste it all right for if you just love them that love you what reward have you do not even Republicans say so yeah you ever do this brother Mark's not here so I can pick on brother Mark you have a problem with somebody and so then you go over to this person over here and you talk to them about this problem and this this person said oh yeah I agree I understand yeah that's just a terrible thing if I just love him to not even Republicans the same but if I can ignore going to this person and just love this person just look for this opportunity to show Christ even though there's not an agreement even though there's not a uh a solution to them following me or agreeing with me but if I can still love them the same that puts me in a different category and that's what Christ is calling us to to be put in a different category a category that can love undisputedly are you with me if you love them they'll love you what reward it do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brother and only what do you more than others do not even the public and so something separates the bride I believe it's perfect love I really do be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect Undisputed Love Too Many Believers are still stuck on the beginning of the Commandment love your neighbor and hate your enemy too many people are stuck there it's amazing to me how we act when there's a problem like we got a master's degree in this situation we know all about it we'll just talk like a professor about the problem and then say class dismissed just a form of godliness people are missing how to love how to bless how to do good Oh Brother John they don't need any more grace what they need is is they need correction they need judgment right now let me just say this to you I do know and I do understand that they need judgment I do understand that they need correction but they need it in love they need it in the love of God they don't need it with our agape love because all right I'm sorry our filial law they don't need it with our video love our feet of the Love Has starts and stops you know what they all go around our emotions and our feelings and what we think I believe in correction I believe in judgment I just believe in the way God did it he went and he died for my sins and he didn't force me to give my life to him he gave me the opportunity and he doesn't do anything to those that put that put their nose up to God that turned their back on the God he just lets him go live the life that they want to live they'll he'll deal with them on the day of judgment and why can't we learn that lesson God still is good to those people yes he's good to the unjust he's good to those that are evil why can't we why can't we manifest Christ you know they got a chance of seeing seeing Christ if you let Christ live through you Galatians chapter 6. chapter chapter six I know my time is is well you know what it is I just need you to if you would bear with me are you getting something out of this Galatians chapter 6 verse 1 Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault you which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness concerning themselves lest I also be tempted I say to you today where does this put you do you consider yourself spiritual do you consider yourself spiritual because a spiritual person will use a spirit of meekness there's a way to correct now the real true correction is not putting your hands on somebody's neck until they say all right I I'm sorry I'm sorry it's it's a restoration that's true correction a restoration it's like we're trying to bring restoration to our sanctuary we're trying to bring order trying to restore it though in a way of reverence it it it's no different so what does it take to help someone with a fault well it takes somebody spiritual not religious but spiritual someone with a mindset of restoring not proving the other person is wrong not proving that we're right but proving that the end of the Commandment is Charity out of a pure heart someone who wears the garments of humility who packs a spirit of meekness that's what it takes to restore and I just you know I sit back and I say why do some people just kind of like you know it's like uh was it the Pharisee when they saw the the the man who had been overtaken by the robbers and he kind of passed on the other side I just wonder sometimes we we see problems and we just kind of want to pass on the other side I call to you I may I think God's going to bring us up on the on the stand and he's going to question us are you spiritual are you spiritual should you not be helping well I I don't feel that I don't feel led to but you feel led to talk you feel led to do what you're doing all right verse Two Bear ye one another's burden and so fulfill the law of Christ I believe that's the will of God right there to Bear one another's burden now does that mean God's got to come to you in a dream or a prophecy or speaking in tongues or that the pastor's got a call and put this burden on you tell you all about it no you got scripture right there it's a choice bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ amen God didn't do away with the law but he's called us to fulfill the law with Undisputed love that's helping our brother and our sister who has fallen to fulfill the law that God has placed inside of us now if you think that you don't have to do it I'm going to just say this to you that God has given you some special Liberty I say you're deceived you're absolutely deceived verse 3 tells us for if a man think himself to be something when he's nothing he deceiveth himself now this we're keeping the whole same theme Here you know we think we're we're something that we don't have to go do that we don't have to we don't have to carry one another's burden he says but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not another he ever you ever see somebody go fix the problem and then another person says yeah I told you I was right you know what I'm talking about for every man shall bear his own burden let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things in other words talk with meekness let your conversation always be with Grace coupled with fear go meet the problem be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever man soweth that shall he also reap so how you treat others is the way that God how you treat others may be how we're going to be treated maybe not by the same people but we we got to start sowing seeds of kindness throw them out there sow them sow them so look for an opportunity to solve them I'm just going to read James a scripture here in James 4. speak not evil one of another Brethren but speak uh he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaking evil the law and judge of the law but if thou judge the law Thou Art not a doer of the law but a judge see you can't do both you cannot do both you take you take sides as soon as you well so God's watching verse 8 for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap everlasting life Everlasting so the scriptures are maintaining the same thing have restoring others so verse 9 let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not and I know it's hard to lay down your life to help somebody it can become weary that's why we have the scripture right here we have this scripture for those situations be not weary in well-doing as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially especially unto them who are of the household of faith I'll say to you don't avoid helping just because you're scared get the love of God in your heart amen that you're not afraid I want to read a quote from the message he cares do you care brother Brandon says the people they lie they cheat they steal to you almost have to have a bond of security to borrow five dollars from somebody you know the Bible speaks to that that there'd be no love in the last days but just amongst the elect people that's right that's right the scripture speaks to that that the husband would be against the wife and the wife the against the husband children against the parents just among the elect of the Lord there will be there will be love left any love left it's it's literally Harder To Love it's harder to love it's easy to love if you get what you want but it's harder to love if you're not getting what you want but the bride subjects herself to the word subjects herself to the Commandment to the end of the Commandment which is Charity not just out of a oh I got you I guess but out of a pure heart a heart that just wants to see that person helped that's your only motive I want to see that person restored that person helped let's Stand Together oh my we just I I want you to know I'm I'm Galatians 5 14 so for all the law is fulfilled in one word even this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if you bite and devour one another take heed you be not consumed one of another now we have a choice when there's a problem we can get upset we can get angry we can bite we can devour we can consume one another or we can make the choice of loving we'll always have that choice and to whom you yield yourself servant survey his servant you'll be I'm so glad that God has called us as the elective God to manifest perfect love and the greater the problem is the greater chance we have to show that love how may desire that let me desire that how many how many feel like I brother John I I feel that has been lacking in me and I I want to see that like I've never seen it before I see this desire right here this is what the bride is hungering for right here because more problems are coming and we don't like problems I understand that but we can't do nothing about the problems coming but but what we can do is represent Christ in the problem represent a perfect love God's got to work the thing out but he's calling us to perfect love let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer Heavenly Father you saw our hands lifted in response to your word today Lord I'm thankful that I'm amongst a group of believers that recognize the importance of manifesting perfect love Lord and I pray for them with all my heart this morning Lord that as they have desired and as they desire and as they will continue to desire to be filled with Your Love I pray that you would also give them that faith to believe that no matter what problem that they will encounter moving forward that you inside of them will never fear but that perfect love will cast out all fear that greater is you inside of them and that Spirit that's in the world God may you fortify us may you strengthen us may you you encourage us Lord and as we take a step forward you told Joshua wherever The Souls of your feet shall tread upon that land shall be yours Lord by faith Lord our hands have gone up and our spiritual feet are walking forward we're taking possession of this word today Lord and we thank you forgiveness of this grace for you would never ever ask us to do anything that we could not do Lord I know what you're asking us to do only you can do and we believe Lord you inside of us will do it oh God teach us day by day to lay down our life to lay down our will to lay down our thoughts are and just to take your word and believe it for the smallest things that happen in our home the smallest things that might happen in our mind in our church and Lord that we could see you in in manifestation this Undisputed love that no matter what you're reigning you're ruling inside of our hearts here on this Earth Lord bless your people now Lord we commit them to you we commit their desires to your hands Lord every need Lord that they have we pray these things and thank you for them in Jesus Christ wonderful name thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord amen amen thank you Jesus let's sing that I am Thy Faithfulness a steadfast love of the Lord never ceases [Music]
