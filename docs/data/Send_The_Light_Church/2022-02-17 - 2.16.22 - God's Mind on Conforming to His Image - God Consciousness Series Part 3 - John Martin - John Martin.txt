his way let go and let god have his wonderful way let go and let god have his way [Laughter] your sorrows will vanish your night turn amen it's a little scary to let go of your will but it's the greatest thing you could do amen there's no way that will become what we need to become without letting go because god's way is the only way that it can get accomplished well god bless each of you it i want to say god bless you to brother martin sister kathleen as well here there's people that are states away and they are still calling every day to make sure that everything was okay no state can separate us amen we appreciate them so thankful the lord brought them back safe amen and that god has kept us to have good weather tonight because uh it's gonna get a little bad amen turn with me if you would to the book of philippians chapter one or philippians chapter two we've been uh doing a little series on god consciousness and um today we want to dig into god's mind on conforming to his image what god thinks about conforming to his image amen so before we begin reading let's just look to the lord in prayer heavenly father we're depending on you lord to come only you can give revelation we can do our best to talk about the understanding of the english language and what certain words mean but god your word goes way beyond the english language and every other foreign language in this world for your word was it came from heaven and we need the mind of christ to understand it and we pray that you would give us revelation of the word today that we might become we might know what we're heading for what we're predestined for what we're coming into help us lord we pray that you would help us all our to to let go and let you have your way let our preconceived thoughts be set aside our own ideas be set aside and open our eyes to your word today we commit the service with every need into your hands lord we thank you for the grace that we have to gather together tonight we give you praise in jesus precious name amen amen philippians chapter 2 verse 1 if there if there be there for any consolation in christ any comfort of love and the fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill you my joy now look at here that ye be like-minded so what is the like-mindedness let this mind be in you that was in christ like-minded having the same love being of one accord and of one mind so that one mind that one accord as identified as the same love there's a revelation here let nothing be done through strife and glory lowliness of mind but in the lowliness of mind let each esteem other than better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus being in the form of god thought of not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation took upon him in the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion is a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross and then also one more scripture before you're seated romans chapter 8 and verses 28 and 29 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren amen god bless you you may be seated now last service we we took our time and i'm i'm hoping not to do that today because i want to try to get through this uh so i'll need your help and paying attention and if i lose you just pick back up as quick as you can both satan and god want to see their complete image in mankind before this is over god has always wanted to have fellowship after his kind the bible says let us make man in our image in our likeness it's been in god's mind from the beginning it's still there today we've been predestinated to come into that satan has always wanted to exalt his throne above the throne of god above the stars of god but he could never create anything so the only thing he could do was take god's subjects pervert them and use those subjects as part of his kingdom and the way that he corrupts man more and more is by simply convincing him to do what you want to do do what you want to do do your will that's why james says it's a sin to say i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that when we don't know the will of god we should say if it would be the will of the lord so satan corrupts man into his image by simply let him do what he wants to do now we would think that um and of course to become perfectly in satan's image we've got to be anti-rebellious against anything that has to do with god but we know that he knows that man will not make it into heaven unless they're born again so as long as man does his own will what he's born with he's not going to make it right so we see how the reason of really stressing this is because we're so tempted to do what we want to do and and things are getting worse in this this age and those who are written in the lamb's book of life from the foundation of the world they are predestinated to be in god's image no man can pluck him out of the father's hand no man can separate from the love of god no one can deceive them from becoming into god's image now the ones who are not elected no matter how much they believe they are no matter how much in the church they're in the message they will be deceived they will be separated and they will face the white throne judgment out of this group comes the foolish virgin they were deceived into thinking they had enough god enough oil enough holy ghost enough of the will of god in their life to make it can you really have enough to make it but why do we feel we have enough right but the real masterpiece of satan are to those who are sold out to do their own will right remember brother branham talking about in an old a woman or an old man who really they get crowned with satan remember him talking about that and um he and he says brother branson says oh lord don't let her let me have that kind of spirit when i get older and you and that kind of spirit is just murmuring complaining and just a negativity in their life and and god wants to crown us with his spirit amen satan's real masterpiece is complete rebellion from god's will first samuel 15 verse 22 first samuel 15 verse 22 and samuel said have the lord have the lord as great to light and burn offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord it's a question and he says behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fed of rams for rebellion is as the sin of rich witchcraft so we come we hear the word of god we're either going to walk out and just i'm gonna i gotta make sure i'm gonna do this or that's not that big a deal it's rebellion okay for rebellion this is a sin of witchcraft and stubbornness i don't have to do that and i'm still going to heaven is as iniquity and idolatry because thou now here it is because that was rejected the word of the lord you just for for no reason do you ever want to reject the word of the lord it's okay to say god give me faith to do this help me i need your grace i'm not doing it but don't reject it because the bible says because those rejected the word he have also rejected thee so how can we come how can we come into the predestination of his image by rejecting part of the word we can't so satan had a masterpiece in judas we we know that he was called the son of perdition he sold out at the last minute and that's why jesus said he that endure to the end the same shall be saved it's not where we're at today judas was right there with all the other apostles right up to the end casting out devils taking care of the finances he was right there but at the very end he said i'm going to take the other side i'm going to do my will satan will have another masterpiece in the antichrist just like god will have another masterpiece in his bride one will be conformed in the image of satan to the exercising of their own will the other will be conformed to the image of jesus christ through the exercising of god's will we become more into the image of the devil by doing our own will now most of the time we don't realize this that's why we must be born against will to obey god's will it's not just say oh i willed him to be born there's something that happens when god wills a person to be born they just don't keep doing what they want to do if god is really born somebody that they are seed after his seed matthew 7 21 says not everyone that sayeth unto me lord lord shall enter to the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven so we've got to come to grips with doing the will of god amen can't have the attitude of take it leave it got the most important things we got to get rid of any kind of denominational thinking we're not a denominational but that's what denominations think well be we believe this i've done this i'm there but when it comes to the word of god god holds us accountable for the whole word and we that's why we work out our salvation with fear and treatment trembling we talked a little bit i don't want to get too much in the last time but we talked about 666 the number of man is instead of the son of god and our will is always instead of god's will that's why we have to become born again to do the will of god amen now before we come into god's image i believe we need to know what that is what is the image of god brother branham said if you want to know who god is look at jesus christ the bible says that jesus christ is in the image of the invisible god jesus christ brother graham said is the masterpiece of god we can't really make a statement or have a sermon that encompasses all that god's image is it's it's impossible what we're going to do is search the scriptures do the best that we can and i want to plant some seeds today you may have never heard this before uh and you may not uh maybe even agree with it i'll just say it like this put the thing on the shelf pray about it god is identified as having a lot of attributes we heard last sunday about being a buckler and a shield well he's a comforter he's a defense he's a rock the tie pulse an anchor a deliverer a healer a provider he's our joy or peace our guy we sung about he's our pilot there are many many attributes of god but what is the image behind those attributes what is the image that you and i are predestinated to come into what is the image of god's masterpiece in his son jesus christ the scripture declares that god is love god is it's not an attribute he is love and through what he is come all those attributes love is the image of god and i'm not speaking of human love filial love i'm speaking of the divine agape love of god divine love is the image that god has predestined us to come into now the majority of the people will miss this revelation after brother brennan went beyond the curtain of time he came back and he said nothing but perfect love can enter in he didn't say that about anything else in other words nothing but the very image of god will enter in there let us make man in our image and in our likeness for fellowship brother brian said he wanted to have fellowship with his kind and if nothing enters in besides perfect love that that is his image that is his likeness now if jesus said not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of the father which is in heaven then we would have to conclude that it will take perfect love to do all the will of god that's important it is hard to do the will of god if you don't love god because his the bible says that his commandments are not grievous but they grievous if you're not love and you just look at everything as do's and don'ts but when you're in so in love with god that you're willing to die out to your will to do the will of god want that to sink in deep jesus said this is my commandment that you love one another first john chapter 2 verse 5 first john chapter 2 verse 5 but whosoever keepeth his word the word of god in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby we okay hereby know we uh that we are in him he that saith he abideth in him all also to walk even as he walked so at this point it really doesn't matter how much we know it matters how we walk so our interactions with one another how we respond about situations how we handle situations are we bearing all things believing all things hoping all things are we volunteering ourselves or are we steaming others better than ourselves it's about our walk that declares the image it's not about what we know now this revelation i believe was so strong in brother branham's heart that he went on to say whatever you do lay aside everything else that you got going on in your life i'm paraphrasing and get perfect love go after it he found what the requirement was to get there and he put the emphasis on it doesn't matter what you got going on good bad indifferent um what what kind of money what kind of business whatever you got going lay it aside until how much emphasis do we put on getting the love of god we feel we've got the love of god and we do but are we in completely in his image so to me we should be laying certain things aside and getting more into that image because look we've been predestined to get there and it don't happen all by god god cannot die out for us god cannot say don't do your will and it don't get done magically he can only present to us what we need to do with our will god's image was manifested in the flesh of jesus christ god's image of perfect love if i could say like that was manifested in jesus christ for god so loved the world that he gave there was no greater expression nothing but perfect love can enter in there he said get to the place where you can love everyone even your enemies now the thing is we we focus on well nobody's perfect nobody can do that and we rest on our reasoning instead of resting on what the word is telling us to do lord i can't do lord you see how much i've you see how i blow you see lord your word declares that i'm predestined to come into your image teach me to die out show me how to die show me how to pray through until i get wrapped up in the holy spirit so much the love of god is shall grow in our heart by the holy ghost it's not us trying to do it it's us becoming in his image jesus said in john 13 34 a new commandment i give you that you love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another this isn't just one of the things that you know we have to do like you know men cut their hair and women don't cut their hair and you know women wear dresses and skirts and men wear pants and it isn't that this is not a do a don't this is the image of christ by this shall all men next verse by this shall all men know that you're my disciple in other words they're going to know you're in my image if you have the same love one for another. first john 3 16 hereby perceive we the love of god or the image of god because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren show them we're in the same same image it takes a lot to lay down your life because you know we we love our life we only got so many hours in the day and if you're like me you wish you had another 24. right even if you were just wasted of you still want another 24. it is hard to lay down whatever you have for others but brother brandon said eternal life is living for others let's go to our opening scripture in philippians chapter 2 verse 1. paul is describing the very image of god's great love he says if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comforter love of any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one accord and of one mind noticing that that verse really really to me gives us a great clue what the mind of christ is the same love one mind one accord now i believe with all my heart that god is wanting us to come in accord with his mind because we'll never get in one accord with one another properly if we don't get in one accord with christ first we don't want to be building a tower of babel that that babel that's not going to help us get to god just by being in unity about something we got to be in unity about loving one another about doing what this word tells us to do let nothing nothing not most things be done through strife or vainglory did you ever just do something and you're upset and angry bothered strife or maybe you just have to prove something that's vainglory but in lowliness of mine just the opposite of that a lowliness take time to esteem others better than yourself not when you think they're worthy of it not when they did good not when they're acting right not when you judge them they're okay to do that no you just do it if christ condemned and said it to men of low state why can't we if he laid down down his life for those that were unworthy how come we can't right amen all right look not every man on his own things get interested in other people's things let every man also on the things of others let this mind this mind of others not yourself being you which was also in christ jesus you see it who being in the form of god he thought it not robbery to be equal of god he he knew he was in the image of god he didn't think it was robbery like oh i'm taking uh advantage so i'm just going to use my powers for myself no if he's equal with god in the image of god is love and he humbled himself to lay down his life for man that he would do the same thing he would do the things that please the father jesus said my father don't love me because i lay down my life so if you you want to i'm i'm i'm god's bride i'm his wife i i'm predestined i'm the seat of god then thinking not robberly lay down your life like jesus laid down his life then prove it with service humble yourself to the word but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself he just kept going he kept humbling it wasn't just good enough to be a human he was a humble human and he became obedient unto death not just his will right but the death of the cross you couldn't do you couldn't be any more humbler than that you couldn't be any more giving that you couldn't be any more loving than that now that's our example if we're predestined to come into that image then this is what we must do we don't sit back and say i'm in i'm in the message i believe the prophet and i'm going to be a preacher i'm predestined to be in his image and do nothing no lay aside everything until you get that image we we had someone that crossed the other side satan's image becomes manifested through the power of man exercising his own will that's why he could say my brother branham could say that power without character is satanic in other words we all have power you know people are shooting people and and and killing and robbing and doing all sorts of things they've got power to exercise their will but they have no character to restrain themselves to do only the things that please the father now god's image becomes manifested through the power of man exercising god's will and look i want to say this don't wait for god to come in church and in a whole hour speak one thing to you that you know was him i'm sorry god is in his word he should be speaking a whole lot you should be interested in a whole image not some personal uh experience this whole world should be personal to the bride of jesus christ the bride makes yourself ready she makes yourself ready into the image she has a part to play we'll see here how does she come into that image she humbles herself to the word unto death because that's what it takes i'm telling you how many times you sit in church you don't feel like worshiping what you got to do is die out to that thought that mindset it's not about whether you feel like it it's about whether you got a revelation that he's worthy of worship they don't the angels in heaven don't come to jesus and say now look let's settle down you know you've had enough don't you think we're getting tired don't you think no but but down here the devil gets us to reason so much revelations 12 11 says and they overcame him i believe him is those giants in their life by the blood of the lamb by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death so what was wrong with those other 10 spies that really convinced a 1.8 million of those hebrew children not to go in to the promised land what was that they feared for their life they loved their life they feared for their life they thought they would die with joshua and caleb they didn't even entertain those thoughts they just said it was god's word we're going for it and either this is god's word i can't love i can love what god loves i can't come into this image not staring at the giants in our life the the habits the problems the things we've had all of our life the things that gets us in trouble you can look at that you can get scared and then you can begin to make excuses of why you don't think you can live that or you can be the joshua and caleb of this age and say god's word says that i'm predestinated to come into his image i will make myself ready the choice is ours the elect the bride his wife will develop the character she needs to lay down her life psalms 23 i said believe it says the lord is my shepherd what i shall not want we have to learn to get rid of that thing brother branham said character is the only thing that we're taking with us when we leave if you couple that with perfect love is the only thing that enters into that place you can see character that he's talking about is perfect love the character of perfect love this is the image i want us to recognize that we're predestinated to come into are you with me this character will not be gifted because brother brandon says character is not a gift so you'll have to fight for this character and every time you get in a fight something happens you have a chance to build your character hallelujah don't wait for god to come down with some great revelation to to hold you back from from swearing no ain't happening like that you are a believer this is you know your place god hasn't expected them for us we've been predestinated to the image of perfect love but how do we get there well we want to try to spend a few more minutes on how to get there first of all it will take your love because only your love for god is going to tell your flesh i'm done doing what i want to do so your love for god's going to have to be greater than your love for your will and i believe that's the same love that we're talking about here in romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for the good to them to them now speaking of the bride i believe to them i mean they're they're their predestinated group to them that love god now here's the problem with this statement if we don't we need this is why we need a revelation we all have a love for god i believe judas at one point had a love for god i believe the devil could even convince judas that if he did this he would have to rise up against the romans and be the be the very uh the master down here that he wouldn't have to go to calvary i could see satan putting that in his mind and convincing him deceiving him but do we love god to the amount that is required well what is the amount that's required it says right there to them who are the called according to his purpose so god is not interested in my little plans he ain't interested in my little reputation he's not interested on me going on vacation i'm saying that because i'm going on vacation next week i can say that i'm bringing a point it's not my purpose that things are going to work together for the good it's his purpose so god is interested in whether the goat is dying or i'm going on vacate god is interested in all of our lives with every detail but there's one thing only one thing that all things will work together for the good that's if we love god to the point that we've been called to fulfill his purpose why in the world would anybody want to buy a car that would not take them to where they want to go why would anybody want to build a house to the point that when it rained it came into the house it wouldn't fulfill the purpose why would god want to have a bride that didn't fulfill his purpose so what does he say let's continue reading here for whom he did for no to these he predestinated this is talking about the same thing it's not a different subject he also did predestinate to be conformed now that word conformed it means jointly formed were being jointly formed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn of a lot of images just like him we're not magically brought into his image without any effort of our own just some i believe i believe well if all you've got to do is believe why did we have a prophet come by and tell us whatever you do lay aside everything until you get it when all you have to do is believe to get it we pay so little attention to certain things and put emphasis on our will what we want to accomplish you can gain the whole world jesus said i'm not worried about losing my soul but i'll tell you i am worried that i don't make a rapture there's a lot of people that'll come to me in that day and say lord lord didn't we didn't we didn't we i thought if i didn't have that i wouldn't have fear and trembling and what good would it do anybody anybody in the whole world if i stood up and i said i know that i'm going in the rapture what good no good i want if my life cannot prove that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that i i if i can't lay down my life and i can't live a life of love what does it matter what i believe then because i haven't been carnally predestined to make it just because i say that i'm in the message or i believe the message somehow this word brother branham taught me has to hold me accountable it's not if we speak in tongues it's not if we do many glorious works it's about if i can lay down my life day in and day out for the lord for his purpose we've been predestined to be conformed or jointly brought in to god's image now in the message christ is a mystery of god reveal brother branham says and um to me an amazing statement here he said this is god's great mystery of love expressed that god and man become one the image we're coming into the image of god it's a great it's god's great mystery of love expressed see the whole thing is god in man one god and man was one there and god and man is one here see what it is being filled with his spirit him having the preeminence that was god's achievement that's god's purpose to do that that he might be in christ christ in us and all of us together won yes there should be so many amens on that one the holy spirit the same thing it revealed it to christ it revealed here the supernatural creative power see the one thing we can't do is we can't manifest christ on our own another thing that christ can't do he can't force our will to die out so here's the battle we do our part and die out christ does his supernatural power and changes us but your will has to say i want this more than anything that's the love that love has to be so strong that you're willing to give up your will you have to call it out say that was wrong i shouldn't get upset i shouldn't be like that that's not the nature of christ that's not the love of god i rebuke you satan in the name of jesus i want this out of my life now you go that far and you you love god that much that you're putting forth you do everything you can light aside everything until you get perfect and i'll tell you god will come on the scene and he will fill you with his spirit he will fill you with his love amen only things stand in the way of us our will you can say you believe but if your will stand in your way you don't believe this is god's great mystery of love express that god and man become one we are in the process of uniting together with god's divine nature right now we're in the process we're right in the middle from being so satanic to being in god's image we're right in the middle we're in the process somewhere are you with me you ever noticed why some people they just for years seem to get nowhere and then some people really grow what is that gods don't respect your persons god cannot go past the barrier of our will why didn't why didn't god just take joshua and caleb and say come on look i'm going to take you two guys these other 1.8 million are going to stay over there and we're going to go get you're going to go take the land and then you're going to prove to them that you were right and they were wrong why didn't god do he could have done it their own belief kept them out it's a personal experience it's not about your brother or sister how big the church is how small the church is what's happening in your home it's all between you and god amen it's how serious you are about coming into god's image see satan wants to do nothing than to get a a people in this message so caught up in lukewarm laodicea in need of nothing i'm in the message but there is a group who will not be deceived she can't be deceived she's laying everything aside so she gets a perfect love man don't you want an opportunity to manifest perfect love what you're doing is you're manifesting christ so the first it starts with letting the mind of love letting the mind of christ the mind of love be in you that was in christ jesus a mindset of love you know we have battled with drama and battled with isms and schisms you know god came spoke to our church and i'm so grateful for his word he doesn't want any isms in the skirt in the church he doesn't want little clicks he doesn't want why favor this person i like this person i get along with that person and i'm going to talk about that person and that is so antichrist that is the anti-christ mind that that's not the image that god is calling us into the mind of christ will lead each one of us to humble ourselves become obedient to the word by dying out to our way of thinking your love for god is proven by the manifestation of you dying out to your will amen second we don't just die once but we keep dying i wish we had more time remember the first encounter that you had with god just might have to go back a while he may have tugged on your heart many times but that time that you finally surrendered something took place ephesians chapter 2 verse 2 says where in times past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the heir the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversations in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind who were by nature the children of wrath what a description in other words our true colors were shown when we didn't get what we want no different than today no different today you don't get what you want wrath comes out but god who is rich in mercy for his great love we're with he loved us even when we were dead and said what did he do he quickened us together that ye joined us together by grace are you saved one day god's word was spoken to us and we believe the truth and through faith god began to quicken us together with christ unite us with god's nature we were so happy when we were forgiven we just wanted to love everybody we want to tell everybody about god his great love think about the first message and tell me if this agrees with you god came by us or he sent somebody by us and he told us that we belong to him that we were a son or daughter of god that we were a predestinated seat of god we were elected by god that we were with him before the foundation of the world now this is the first time he came by so just relax be at peace i died for you you're coming to heaven because you're my predestinated seed now is that how it happened but why is that happening now why is it happening now if it didn't happen then when god first got a hold of our hearts we got so convicted of sin what was the first thing we did repent that was our first encounter we repented it's the first key to get into the kingdom jesus gave peter the keys and peter said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the problem with the mind that is not converted is it usually stops right there but it's through the process of repentance dying out self-denial that we come more into the image of god jesus said if you want to follow me you want to be my disciple you must deny yourself you must take up your cross you must die out to yourself daily amen and then follow me amen now he told us what to do to follow him and he uses that word daily wow that just changes our whole life right there if we get a revelation of that daily luke 14 verse 26 if any man come after me and hate not his father mother his wife children brothers sisters yay his own life also he cannot be my disciple even though he says he's jesus's disciple jesus won't claim him there's a difference and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me he cannot be my disciple so jesus told his followers from the beginning that there was going to be a process that happened every day and this process will take you into the image of god but as soon as you stop i've done enough i'm saved a message i believe you're coming into his image thoughts because you do not become into god's image of love by sitting listening and learning about the word of god and i'll say amen a thousand times i'll say that statement a thousand times we heard in our men's meeting if we do not become a doer of the word we're only deceiving herself romans chapter 8 verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead if it now dwells in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your moral bodies by his spirit that dwells in you so we we have no problem saying i've got the holy ghost but for some reason our life has a problem of manifesting that quickening power now don't get quiet on me we've got to hold ourselves accountable therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh anymore so what do we do if we live after the flesh we'll die but if we through the holy ghost through the help of the lord to mortify the deeds of the body we shall live i'll tell you if if we're missing joy and peace and love i think what needs to happen is through the spirit you need to mortify the deeds of the body you need to say no to yourself sometime get that joy back you know do not wait for the special speaker to come don't wait for the special songs don't wait to some good feeling or or something god don't even wait for god to use you just mortify the jesus for as many now look at this not a different subject for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god the spirit of god is leading you to mortify the deeds of your body amen and if you're led to do that you will be changed from glory unto glory that change will happen you will see the love of god manifested in your life more than you've ever seen it before and you know what all the glory will go to god because there's nothing you can do to manifest agape love except get out of the way get out of the way and let god have his way amen we must repent when we repented we got baptized that was just the beginning but we must continue to walk in the same humility that we had then amen that's right amen remember how humble we were we're so grateful for god's grace we're willing to do anything you got to walk in that daily and anytime we get away from humility we're getting away from god because god still resists the crowd i remember when god was dealing with me and god was asking me to do certain things before i'll tell you i was resisting and even now when god's dealing with this if you can't see your flesh resisting uh god and he's trying to tell you to do something you're not paying attention because there's a battle going on in your flesh and your spirit are in are in are they're in a battle so god resists the proud he giveth grace to the humble at any time a seed of god can get away from pleasing god so who cares who cares if you feel like your seed why don't you care about pleasing you can get away from doing the will of god you can fall into pride and arrogancy and become judgmental and uncaring and still be a predestinated seat of god but you will not stay in that condition here's the difference you'll get out of it you'll say this is not what i'm predestined to i should be giving glory to god through my life so if you're predestinated and you find yourself in a bad condition what should you do repent it's that simple the same thing you did at the beginning and through that you'll get out of that and you'll start loving others you'll start living for others it won't be a you won't be a child of wrath you'll be a child trying to bring someone closer to christ ii chronicles chapter 7 verse 14. just keep repenting keep repenting keep repenting keep looking for things to repent for now that was in my notes uh brother jonathan and he brought out in our men's meeting that when we're praying we need to ask god is there anything in my life that you want me to to to deal with and i think that needs to be important to us because it is important to god so second chronicles chapter 7 verse 14 reads if my people oh seed of god pretty destitated see you to god got that right off the right off the bat these are not the devil's people but my people which are called by my name are you a jesus believer are you in the message this is this is you then shall humble them themselves you mean i i can't just do what i want to do if i'm i'm god's people what else that matters shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways i'll just say your will if it's not god's will your will is wicked it may not be murdering somebody but it's still wicked to god amen so we have to turn from our will then will i hear from heaven in other words seek ye first the kingdom and then i'll pay attention to you and will forgive their sins and will heal their lands what the requirement four things humble yourself pray seek the faith turn from the wicked ways then god will build his image in his people we don't have time to get into it but in jude it says i i want to remind you that after god had saved his people out of the land of egypt afterwards destroyed them because they did not continue to believe so many people want salvation but they're not interested in the process of coming into his image because it requires dying out oh my time just just goes by so quickly do you want to dwell with god you have to learn how to dwell in heavenly places because that's where christ is at the bible says it's a secret place of the most high god is not going to stoop down to your haughty arrogant proud unthankful spirit we have to learn to sit in heavenly places with christ amen now how do we get there how do we get up there the way out there is down there [Laughter] humble yourself will get you up there amen isaiah 57 15 for thus saith the high and lofty one the one that inhabit it eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place here's where we come in with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive what's repentance for to revive to get back to give life to that's what that word revive means to revive the spirit of the humble to revive that word means to restore or quicken the heart of the contrite ones repentance does that your self-righteousness and your greatness does not do that it does not bring god on the scene your humility is what brings god on the scene god doesn't dwell with a haughty arrogant proud unthankful spirit even if you're predestinated god will resist the proud as long as they're proud he even hates a proud look be careful about the look you got on your face at any given time god will continue to give more grace to the humble to be changed into the image of christ you know and i'll say this brother branham often rededicated his life to god now he's a prophet that means he often humbled himself said i've come short of where you have called me to be that i see in the scriptures what you've spoken to me i haven't been hitting the mark i'm going to rededicate my life i'm repenting that i haven't done that it's okay to repent every time you come to church it might be old-fashioned to hear it but it's the genuine truth of god it's okay to repent every time it's to be expected how else we're gonna come into the image you know there's a whole group of people that are deceived thinking that somehow on rapture morning i'm gonna doesn't matter the life that they're living that somehow they're just going to be in the image of christ and have no understanding of how to even get there having little understanding what that image is when god gives us opportunity every day when we rub shoulders with one another when we go to work when we're in our homes and we think it's no big deal how we talk to one another how we act what we say i'm telling you these are opportunities for us to grow our character to become more in his image and get further in the process see time is up but i want to at least read a quote and this you know what's weird is always telling brother mark i had like nine pages left i think from last time i just tore those thrown away and started all over this this subject the more you dig into it the more it opens opens up now brother brandon said in the sumerian church age he said unless we suffer we cannot reign with him now the reason i'm reading this oh give will you give me just a few minutes okay romans chapter 8 verse 14. let's just pick that up there for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear god does not want us to be in fear like we're not going to come into his image but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we know who our father is the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we're a seed of god and if we're a seed of god where air heirs have got joiners for christ if so be why is he putting us in here if so be we suffer with him why is that in there why does it have to be in there because there's no way you'll come to manifestation without suffering you can't believe yourself into the image of christ you have to prove your faith you have to have the attitude of joshua and caleb and get the giants out of your life so it takes suffering and if you suffer with him that we may be also glorified together now i love this verse for i reckon that all the sufferings that i got to go through to get these giants out of my life are not worthy to be compared with the glory that's going to be revealed in us not you know up there in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god they're waiting for us to start manifesting this so brother brandon says in the search age now quite after this quote unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you you have to suffer to reign and the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering now remember characters are anything we're taking with us so character he said is a victory it's not a gift so don't expect it to be given to you a man without character can't reign because power apart from character satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share his throne on the same basis that he overcame and to sit down with the father then we have to overcome to sit with him now how did he overcome he died out to the death of the even to the death of the cross that's how he overcame because his will said father if it's possible let this cup pass from me but he overcame he didn't yield to what he didn't want to suffer he he went beyond that and he gave himself if this is what it takes to manifest love i'm going to do it and the little temporary sufferings that we go through now i like he said the little temporary sufferings you know every little fight that we had with everybody just right now we're in a state where we can look back and say that is just a little nothing right when we're going through it it's like this big thing we got to tell everybody my world's coming down but looking back it was such a small thing and if we just if we would have just did the right thing at that moment right is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what a treasure are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation so don't come to church in a comfortable seat without willing to enter in through suffering through tribulation amen god bless you let's stand together oh my i wish that we could took more time remember when jesus said be pur be like my father in heaven okay so he's given at the end of the beatitudes or in the beatitudes there he says be like my father the image of my father is perfect love he don't just love those that love him he loves everybody so be like the image of my father and he pointed them to the image of god perfect love it's what we've been predestinated to don't wait for that to be given to you as a gift at the end it won't be it won't be you you'll have to overcome on a daily basis to lay your life down and let god have his way amen let's bow our hearts in a word of prayer heavenly father we come to you lord as your as your predestinated seed we believe lord that we're going to be just like you lord we're so grateful that you brought us into the message of the hour that you sent a prophet to to to open up these mysteries to us that this great mystery of love where you and man can become one you and your children become one you and your wife to become one lord we're thankful for that today we're grateful lord that we're not deceived we're grateful lord that our eyes are open and lord today we're asking for the power of the holy ghost to come into our lives lord that these things that we have heard let we could begin to put them into practice on a daily basis lord when you ask us to seek your face lord that we'll do that lord when you ask us to to humble ourselves come obedient we'll just willingly do that and lord i pray that you'd use everybody in this church lord to manifest perfect love one to another our homes and our work and our neighbors even those that we got problems or someone's crossed us oh god help us to be perfect and just love everyone we don't want to miss it lord we want to be completely in your image bless each one give them their hearts desire lord may your love just burn deep within their heart and their love for you burn deep in their heart lord where we're lacking oh god make up the difference show us what to do lord take us from these these places of of lukewarmness to being on fire for you again lord lord that song we sing sometimes return that that love that first love that once burned bright oh jesus lord we've just we've gone through so much and lord this world and the covenant and all these things lord they just bring barriers lord in our way stumbling blocks in a way but i pray lord every day that you would remind us what are your purposes for our life and use us lord make us witnesses lord jesus we give you our heart we give you our lives lord we give you ourselves lord jesus we give you the praise lord take us and use this we ask in jesus christ's name amen amen let's sing that draw me near i am thine o lord i have heard thy voice and it told
