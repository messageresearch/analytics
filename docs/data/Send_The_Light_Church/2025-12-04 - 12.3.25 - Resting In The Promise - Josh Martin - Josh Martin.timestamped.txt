[0:00] this for a couple months,
[0:03] but that's just the way it is. This is a
[0:06] a brutal recovery. It's literally easier
[0:08] just to go ahead and get a knee
[0:11] replacement or shoulder replacement.
[0:13] This one is is um you just they got
[0:17] attach it and you got to just let it
[0:18] heal and you can't do a whole lot. But
[0:21] thankful for doctors that know what
[0:22] they're doing,
[0:24] &gt;&gt; got experience, and you just follow the
[0:26] protocol and
[0:28] &gt;&gt; and pretty much we'll we'll be getting
[0:30] back like brother Stan. We'll be able to
[0:32] work side by side with him
[0:35] and God bless you for coming out on this
[0:38] day. Um
[0:41] I believe we're going to be blessed.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe the Lord has something
[0:46] special for us. Um this is the only day
[0:50] that he had available. We tried to
[0:52] encourage to come on Sundays, but um
[0:55] sometimes uh they're not available, so
[0:58] we're taking what we can get.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Uh Hummy's been praying for
[1:03] the service.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Well, let's just sing uh
[1:08] only believe. We certainly appreciate
[1:10] our our music.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; Um where would we be? Where would we be
[1:17] right without it? And it just helps us
[1:19] to enter in and worship the Lord. Let's
[1:21] just sing only believe as brother uh
[1:24] Josh Martin comes to give us the word of
[1:26] life today. Amen.
[1:29] Only
[1:32] believe.
[1:35] Only
[1:37] believe.
[1:41] All things are possible.
[1:46] Only
[1:48] believe.
[1:51] Only
[1:53] believe.
[1:56] Only
[1:59] believe.
[2:02] All things are possible.
[2:08] Only
[2:10] believe,
[2:13] Lord,
[2:15] I believe.
[2:19] Lord,
[2:21] I believe.
[2:25] All things
[2:37] I believe,
[2:41] Lord.
[2:42] I believe
[2:46] all things are possible.
[2:52] Lord, I
[2:55] believe. Can we sing? Jesus is here.
[2:58] Jesus
[3:00] is here.
[3:03] Jesus
[3:05] is here.
[3:08] All things are possible.
[3:14] Jesus
[3:16] is here.
[3:19] Jesus
[3:22] is here.
[3:24] Jesus
[3:27] is here.
[3:30] All things are possible.
[3:35] Jesus
[3:38] is here.
[3:41] Amen. You believe that this evening that
[3:44] he's here in our midst. And what's
[3:46] incredible about the presence of of
[3:48] Christ is when he's here, you don't have
[3:50] to leave the same way. you know, uh,
[3:53] Brother Brandon would tell the story of
[3:54] the little girl that would want to see
[3:56] the king, you know, the king of, uh, I
[3:58] believe of Canada was was coming through
[4:00] and she would have her flag and would be
[4:02] waving the flag and and as they were
[4:05] getting the the class together to leave,
[4:08] uh, the the teacher couldn't find this
[4:10] little girl. So, she she would look for
[4:12] her and would find her and she was in a
[4:13] corner crying and she would look at him
[4:16] and would say, "What's what's the
[4:17] matter? Did you not see the king?" "Yep,
[4:20] I seen the king." Well, did you not wave
[4:22] your flag? Yes, I waved the flag, but
[4:25] but but what's the matter? Why are you
[4:26] crying? She would say, "Well, I seen the
[4:28] king and I waved my flag, but I was too
[4:31] little. The king didn't see me." And
[4:33] brother Brandon would say, "That's not
[4:34] the way it is with King Jesus. No matter
[4:37] how little we are or what little we do,
[4:39] he sees it all." And and that's always
[4:42] encouraging. You know, you you might
[4:44] feel like you're the least in the
[4:45] kingdom of God, but he sees it. He sees
[4:48] every little thing you do. He He sees
[4:50] you as you're raising your children, as
[4:52] you're providing for your families, as
[4:54] you're going to work. He sees you.
[4:56] Nothing goes goes unnoticed whenever
[4:58] you're serving the Lord. Amen. Are you
[5:00] happy to be in the house of the Lord
[5:02] this evening? Amen. Well, if you would
[5:04] have your Bibles, let's open our
[5:06] scriptures to Hebrews 11:8.
[5:08] It's such an honor to be with you'all
[5:10] here tonight. I I pray something can be
[5:13] said to be a blessing and to to
[5:15] strengthen your faith in some way. I
[5:17] just have a simple thought uh tonight,
[5:21] but I pray you can it can be a blessing
[5:23] to you. Um I bring greetings from our my
[5:26] pastor, brother Wendell Martin, and the
[5:28] saints there in New Life Outreach and
[5:30] Pony, Oklahoma. They send their
[5:32] greetings and it's just so good to be
[5:34] with you here tonight. And I appreciate
[5:36] the opportunity to be ministering. Amen.
[5:39] I I just just love the Lord here
[5:40] tonight. You love the Lord tonight.
[5:42] Amen. In Hebrews 11:8, a familiar
[5:45] passage of scripture. But by faith
[5:48] Abraham, when he was called to go out
[5:51] unto a place which he should after
[5:53] receive for an inheritance, obeyed. And
[5:56] he went out, not knowing whether he
[5:58] went. By faith he sojourned in the land
[6:01] of promise, as in a a strange country,
[6:05] dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac,
[6:07] Jacob, the heirs with him of the same
[6:09] promise. For he looked for a city which
[6:13] hath foundations, whose builder and
[6:15] maker is God. Amen. Can we bow our heads
[6:18] this evening? Dear gracious heavenly
[6:20] father, Lord, how how humbled we are to
[6:23] come into your house one more time.
[6:25] Father, we ask Lord that you would just
[6:28] feel welcome here among us. Lord, you
[6:30] know the needs that are in the lives of
[6:32] your people, Father. Lord, we're a needy
[6:35] people and we're nothing without you,
[6:37] Father. And Lord, we're needing you here
[6:39] tonight to come and Lord, break the
[6:41] breads of life to us. Father, we ask
[6:44] that you would take this simple thought,
[6:46] Lord. May you anoint it to our hearts,
[6:48] Father. May there be a heart to receive
[6:51] what you would have for us here tonight,
[6:52] Lord. God, we commit ourselves and this
[6:56] service into your hands in Jesus' name.
[6:59] Amen. You may be seated here this
[7:01] evening. I just have a simple thought.
[7:04] It would be resting in the promise. And
[7:07] and Abraham is always it's a story that
[7:09] brother Brandham he would preach on a
[7:12] lot. He he would preach many messages on
[7:14] the life of Abraham and he would preach
[7:17] Jehovah Gyra a couple series on that on
[7:20] on that thought and he would say here in
[7:23] Jehovah Gyra. Do you love the journey
[7:25] with Abraham? I just love to watch it.
[7:28] He says because why? Everything that he
[7:31] did was a perfect type of the church. A
[7:34] and and I've always heard the the story
[7:37] of Abraham and the the journey that
[7:39] Abraham would would go through. But
[7:41] whenever I would come across that quote
[7:43] and would hear brother Brandham say
[7:45] that, it gave me a different perspective
[7:47] of Abraham that he's a type of me.
[7:49] Everything that he would go through is
[7:52] exactly what he's doing for the church.
[7:55] And you can look at Genesis 12:1. Now
[7:57] the Lord had said unto Abram, "Get thee
[8:00] out of thy country, and from thy
[8:02] kindred, and from thy father's house,
[8:04] into a land that I will show thee." And
[8:07] it's it's incredible to think about the
[8:10] amount of faith that Abraham would had
[8:13] to have had to leave his kindred, to
[8:15] leave his father's house, maybe uh he
[8:18] might have had a good job or or a nice
[8:20] place to live. and and and he would hear
[8:23] the voice of the Lord, you know, get get
[8:25] away from your family and go to a place
[8:27] I'm going to show you. And if you would
[8:30] look at it through a human eyes, you
[8:32] would you could almost argue, why not
[8:34] why don't you show me now where we're
[8:36] going? You know, show me where you want
[8:38] me to go. But that wasn't the way God
[8:40] was working. He says, Separate yourself,
[8:42] and I'm going to show you. I I might not
[8:44] show you now. You you can look at the
[8:47] the the confidence that that Abraham
[8:50] would would have to have in the voice of
[8:52] God to leave everything behind. And it's
[8:55] the same thing today. It's confidence in
[8:58] the word of the Lord. And in the book of
[9:00] Revelations would say, I heard another
[9:02] voice from heaven saying, "Come out of
[9:04] her, my people, and be separated. Be be
[9:06] not partakers of her sins and and of her
[9:09] plagues." But the difference between us
[9:11] and Abraham is we do have a direction.
[9:14] We know what we're striving for. We We
[9:17] know the place that that we are
[9:19] sojouring to. And I believe that a
[9:21] rapture is what every one of us is
[9:24] striving for. I believe you're striving
[9:26] for that tonight. A body change, a
[9:28] marriage supper of the lamb, a honeymoon
[9:30] in the millennium. And and all of these
[9:32] things have been promised for us to
[9:35] obtain. Unlike Abraham, all Abraham had
[9:38] was I'm going to show you a place, but
[9:41] start walking. And so we can look how
[9:44] that that it was a Abraham would have to
[9:47] rest and trust in what the word of the
[9:50] Lord was telling him to do. And that is
[9:52] a hard thing to do sometimes is trust.
[9:55] And we're living in a day where where
[9:58] where anxieties and and fears is is on
[10:01] the rampage and and fear of the unknown
[10:04] is a genuine thing. And and all of us
[10:06] can probably testify of it when you
[10:09] don't know what what the next minute is
[10:11] going to hold. And brother Brown, he he
[10:13] would tell us that m man likes to be in
[10:16] control. He would say that it's human
[10:18] nature. He would say to prove the point,
[10:20] he would say, "Get in a car with
[10:21] somebody. You're in the passenger seat."
[10:23] He says, "You're going to tell them turn
[10:25] here, turn there." He says, "You'll be
[10:27] stomping on the floor trying to pump the
[10:29] brakes." Even though there's no brakes
[10:30] there, you you like to be in control,
[10:33] you know. And so fear of the unknown is
[10:35] a genuine thing because you like to be
[10:38] in control. And whenever it's out of
[10:40] your ability or out of your control to
[10:43] to maybe change circumstances or or make
[10:46] something happen, that's when fear comes
[10:49] and creeps into the heart where you
[10:51] don't know if something can happen. And
[10:53] all God is saying is trust me. Just rest
[10:57] in what I promise you can do. You can't
[11:00] do it in your own ability, but rest in
[11:02] what I can do. And and so panic attacks
[11:05] comes from not knowing what what what is
[11:07] going to happen. And and and I I
[11:09] remember one time I I I was staying in
[11:12] in Virginia. I think I was 13 or 14. And
[11:15] and I was staying at my uncle Sean's
[11:17] place there in Virginia. He's a pastor
[11:18] up there. And I was up there for for a
[11:20] couple months. And and uh uh it was time
[11:23] for me to fly back home. And so we get
[11:25] to the airport, you know, Uncle Sean,
[11:27] he's with me. I'm a I'm a minor, so I
[11:29] have to be accompanied by an adult, you
[11:31] know. So I get he gets to the security
[11:32] with me. And we're sitting there waiting
[11:34] for me to board the plane. and it gets
[11:37] announced over the intercom that that
[11:39] there was engine failure and and the
[11:41] plane has been delayed. Our flight's
[11:42] been delayed for for a few more hours,
[11:45] but Uncle Shawn, he was heading on a
[11:47] trip that that same day. And so he
[11:49] dropped me off with the one of his
[11:50] deacons to come and and take me to the
[11:52] airport, you know, and so I was already
[11:55] a little nervous because of the engine
[11:56] failures. My first time flying by
[11:58] myself. And so so we get through the
[12:01] security again, me and brother Sam, you
[12:02] know, we're sitting there and and he
[12:04] leaves. He's He's never flown before
[12:06] himself. So, he leaves and and I'm
[12:08] nervous, you know. I'm like, man, okay,
[12:10] I just just stay calm. And and then I'm
[12:13] waiting there and and and the intercom
[12:14] says again, hey, the the the flight is
[12:17] going to be delayed. We're experiencing
[12:18] engine failure. I said, again, you know,
[12:21] and so here here the nervousness is
[12:23] working up here. The the anxiety is
[12:26] starting to to build up because I don't
[12:28] know what's going to happen. I've never
[12:29] done this before. my adult has left, you
[12:32] know, and then they say, "Okay, we're
[12:34] ready to go." Everybody get, you know,
[12:36] get in line. And so I get in line. I've
[12:38] got my ticket. A and the the the the
[12:41] host there says, "Wait, I have to
[12:42] accompany you onto the plane. You know,
[12:44] you can't be by yourself." Which is
[12:46] encouraging. You know, as a minor, you
[12:48] you you're never alone. But she says,
[12:50] "You just just go sit down over here.
[12:52] When everybody gets on the plane, I'll
[12:54] come and get you and I'll escort you to
[12:56] your seat." I said, "Great." you know,
[12:59] so I I'm sitting there waiting and I'm
[13:00] watching everybody get on the plane. You
[13:03] know, everybody gets on, the last person
[13:04] gets on the plane and the lady gets on
[13:07] the plane herself. Now, I'm sitting
[13:09] there like, "Hey, I'm supposed to be
[13:11] with her." And you know what would
[13:12] happen? I had a panic attack. And and
[13:15] here I started to get dizzy. I started
[13:17] to, you know, things started to get a
[13:18] little fuzzy. And while I WAS SITTING
[13:21] THERE, I was almost about to pass out.
[13:23] Excuse me. I was panicking that bad. But
[13:26] then all of a sudden there would come
[13:28] the the stewardist would come back and
[13:29] say, "Hey, you ready to get back? Get on
[13:30] the plane." And right there everything
[13:32] would clear up. And I thought that's a
[13:34] lot like what's happening today. We're
[13:36] living in a day where the greatest
[13:38] battle ever fought is right in the mind.
[13:41] And it's easy to have panic attacks of
[13:43] of not spiritual panic attacks where I'm
[13:46] not good enough where where I can't make
[13:48] a rapture. My children aren't going to
[13:50] be saved. This here can't happen. That
[13:52] can't happen. And and as the nervousness
[13:54] starts to grip around the heart, then
[13:57] the word can comfort and say, "Hey,
[13:59] you're more than conquerors through
[14:01] Christ Jesus who strengthens you." And
[14:04] it's incredible the comfort of the word
[14:07] of the Lord that that in the right
[14:09] season, there can be a verse or a
[14:11] message, a preacher can come and and
[14:13] preach something across the pullpit. And
[14:16] while you're sitting there having a hard
[14:18] time, there can come a word of comfort
[14:20] that can strengthen and encourage. The
[14:23] Bible would tell us that that the Lord
[14:25] himself shall descend with a shout, with
[14:27] a voice, with a with the trump, and the
[14:29] dead in Christ shall rise first, right?
[14:32] And we which are alive and remain shall
[14:33] be caught up together with them in the
[14:35] sk in the clouds and and forever be with
[14:38] our Lord. And what would the next verse
[14:40] say? Wherefore comfort one another with
[14:42] these words. In other words, whenever
[14:45] you're lonely, comfort yourself.
[14:47] Whenever you're discouraged, comfort
[14:49] yourself. Whenever you lose a a loved
[14:51] one, comfort yourself. There's a word
[14:54] that that IN THE RIGHT SEASON CAN
[14:57] COMFORT you where you can rest. And I
[15:00] BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT GOD HAS CALLED us to
[15:02] do in this generation is rest. Because
[15:05] we can't do it. We can't make a rapture
[15:07] in our own ability, but it's all what
[15:09] God has done for us. And brother
[15:11] Brandham said, "Everything a Christian
[15:14] has, it's his faith resting in the
[15:17] finished work of Calvary." Everything
[15:19] was finished and completed. We rest our
[15:22] faith in the finished work. Ain't that
[15:24] incredible? Brother Brandon would tell
[15:27] us in one place if Christ was here in
[15:30] this suit and tie, he says he couldn't
[15:32] heal you. The reason why is he already
[15:34] done it. And so we're not looking for
[15:36] for Christ to do something for us. We're
[15:40] just resting in what God has already
[15:42] done. But brother Brandham, he would
[15:44] tell us that this is the most deceitful
[15:47] age that there's ever been. And and it's
[15:50] incredible to think about because you
[15:52] can't take nobody's word anymore. You
[15:54] you you don't know what's AI or what's
[15:56] real anymore. You you you you and it's
[15:59] easy to get the mentality of nothing's
[16:02] true. And and it's only me and only my
[16:05] loved ones and I can only believe their
[16:06] word. And and I believe that is a design
[16:09] of the devil where it's hard to place
[16:12] confidence in the word of the Lord where
[16:14] where we become skeptical. Are we sure
[16:17] that's true? Are we sure that the word
[16:20] has power to save and power to deliver
[16:23] and power to to change our bodies? And
[16:25] and it's easy to get that mindset of
[16:28] it's it sounds good, but is it really
[16:30] true? But let me say this THAT DON'T
[16:32] JUST SOUND GOOD, but it is good. I
[16:35] believe every word in in this message is
[16:38] is has a a transforming POWER TO CHANGE
[16:41] lives and and to change DESIRES AND AND
[16:44] TO SAVE loved ones AND AND TO FILL with
[16:46] the Holy GHOST AND AND ONE DAY IT'S
[16:48] GOING TO CHANGE OUR BODIES. IT AIN'T
[16:50] SOMETHING THAT IS TOO good to be true.
[16:52] It is SOMETHING THAT IS TRUE that we can
[16:55] REST HIM AND PLACE OUR CONFIDENCE ON
[16:58] INSIDE OF HIM AND KNOW BEYOND A SHADOW
[17:00] OF A DOUBT THAT GOD HAS EVERYTHING under
[17:03] control. Oh my. We might not know what
[17:06] tomorrow holds, but we know who holds
[17:08] tomorrow. And it's encouraging to know
[17:11] that when we feel like we're by
[17:12] yourself, he'll never leave us. He'll
[17:15] never forsake us, but he will be with us
[17:17] till the until we step into a body
[17:20] change. And it's incredible. Brother
[17:22] Brandon would tell the story about how
[17:24] that he would lose his daughter and his
[17:26] wife would pass away and a and one of
[17:29] his critics would come up to him and
[17:31] would say, you know, what do you think
[17:32] of God now? You lost your daughter. You
[17:35] you you lost your wife. And brother
[17:37] Brandham would say, I think of him the
[17:39] same. He is faithful. And the man would
[17:41] say, oh, you you kept your religion,
[17:43] huh? Brother Brandham says, oh no, my
[17:45] religion kept me. It's something we can
[17:47] rest in and place our heart and place
[17:50] our children in, place our marriage in,
[17:52] place our place our church in, place the
[17:55] uh prodal children in. It's something we
[17:58] can rest IN KNOWING THAT GOD HAS THE
[18:01] ABILITY and the power to save. And
[18:04] brother Brandon would say, let's begin
[18:06] with Abraham and find out what Abraham
[18:09] was and how that we become his seed. And
[18:12] then if we really get thoroughly based
[18:14] upon the word of the Lord, then it takes
[18:17] all of the fear away from us if we know
[18:21] what we're doing. And and that that's
[18:22] why I'm so thankful for the message of
[18:25] the hour. It's taken away all of the
[18:27] fear because it's thoroughly based upon
[18:30] thus saith the Lord. And then we can
[18:33] walk knowing that it's not blind leading
[18:36] the blind, but it's thus saith the Lord
[18:39] that we are following. And you can look
[18:41] at you can look at Abraham in Romans
[18:43] 4:20. He staggered not at the promise of
[18:47] God through unbelief, but was strong in
[18:50] faith, giving glory to God, and being
[18:52] fully persuaded that what he had
[18:55] promised, he was able also to perform.
[18:59] And and and what I love about that
[19:01] scripture is the reason why he staggered
[19:04] not at the promises of God was because
[19:07] he was persuaded. And and that is a hard
[19:09] thing to do in the most deceitful age is
[19:12] be persuaded of something because every
[19:15] TIME YOU YOU START TO be persuaded of
[19:17] something, you find the hidden flaw
[19:19] behind it or or you find a a hidden
[19:21] motive behind it. And and I I I have
[19:23] been looking for a for a vehicle for the
[19:26] past 6 months. And and if y'all have
[19:28] ever shoed for a vehicle, you can
[19:30] probably feel my pain. Every time you
[19:32] think you find a good deal, all of a
[19:34] sudden you drive it, something's wrong
[19:36] with it. And you know, my banker, every
[19:38] time I I would find something that was a
[19:40] good deal, he would say, "Now, Josh,"
[19:42] he's like, "I don't mean to be this way,
[19:44] but that's a scam." He's like, "That's
[19:46] too cheap. There's got to be something
[19:47] wrong with it." And so, we're living in
[19:49] the most deceitful age, but yet we have
[19:52] to be persuaded. AND IT'S HARD to be
[19:55] persuaded. And the way you become
[19:57] persuaded of something is to see that is
[20:00] genuine. You remember brother Brandham,
[20:02] he would sell the lamps, right? and and
[20:04] he would go up to the houses and would
[20:05] say, "Hey, if you like the lamp, you you
[20:08] can keep it for a week. If you like it,
[20:09] I'll come back next week. You can buy it
[20:12] or you can give it back to me." And he
[20:13] says, "I was I was the number one
[20:15] salesman for that company because he
[20:18] wasn't trying to sell it to him. The
[20:20] product was selling itself." And and
[20:22] that's how you become persuaded. It's
[20:25] not YOU TRYING TO SELL IT, but this
[20:27] message is showing itself. THIS MESSAGE
[20:30] HAD A PILLAR OF FIRE BEHIND IT. AND THE
[20:32] ANGEL OF THE LORD BACKING IT UP TIME AND
[20:35] TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THAT'S HOW I AM
[20:38] persuaded that this message is thus
[20:40] sayaith the Lord is because God himself
[20:43] has backed it up and it's a scriptural
[20:46] message and I'm persuaded and so I'm
[20:49] staggering not at it. Even though we're
[20:51] in the most deceitful age, I am not
[20:54] staggering at it. Oh, hallelujah. And as
[20:57] we as we're looking at Abraham, the
[20:59] Bible would tell us that he was under an
[21:01] unconditional covenant. And brother
[21:04] Brandham would tell us that that there
[21:06] was three covenants through the Old
[21:08] Testament. There was the first covenant
[21:09] with Adam and Eve, right? And then they
[21:12] would break the covenant. And then there
[21:13] was another covenant with God and Noah,
[21:16] and then Noah would Noah would break the
[21:18] covenant. And it was always a covenant
[21:20] between God and man. But then Abraham's
[21:24] covenant, it was between God and
[21:26] himself. HE COULD SWEAR BY NOBODY
[21:28] GREATER. SO HE WOULD SWEAR BY HIMSELF.
[21:31] AND AND I BELIEVE that's the reason why
[21:34] Abraham would stagger not at the promise
[21:36] of God because he knew if I fall and
[21:40] make a mistake, the covenant STILL
[21:42] STANDS. HALLELUJAH. If it's 20 years and
[21:45] and it don't look like I can do it, the
[21:47] covenant still stands. IT'S NOT ON MY
[21:49] ABILITY to produce it. It's on his
[21:52] ability to keep his word. AND AND WE'RE
[21:55] UNDER THAT SAME COVENANT. Brother
[21:57] Brandham would teach us to them that we
[21:58] are the royal seat, the spiritual seat
[22:01] of Abraham. And we're under an
[22:03] unconditional covenant. So, you know
[22:05] what that means? It's not what you can
[22:07] do. IT'S WHAT GOD HAD ALREADY DONE. AND
[22:10] WE'RE just resting in the word of the
[22:13] Lord in this generation and and relying
[22:16] on him to do the rest. AND BROTHER
[22:18] BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US THAT that's the
[22:20] basis of our faith is that this covenant
[22:23] is an everlasting covenant because it's
[22:26] unconditional. It's an everlasting
[22:28] covenant. A and it's in it's incredible
[22:31] to to think about how brother Brandham
[22:34] he would he would ask the question, are
[22:36] we sufficiently impressed with the word
[22:39] in our midst? In other words, are we
[22:41] persuaded? And brother Brandon would
[22:43] would would talk about El Shadi and and
[22:46] he he would teach us that that El Shadi
[22:49] was the breasted God. He was the
[22:51] strength giver. And he and it was El
[22:53] Shadi that Abraham would meet and
[22:55] brother Brandon would tell us that he
[22:57] would nurse from El Shadi a body change.
[23:00] And and when and he's our type. And so
[23:03] as we as we pour strength from the word,
[23:06] HE'S EL SHADI to us. But brother Brandon
[23:09] would also tell us that a mother don't
[23:12] just give the baby strength, but it also
[23:14] satisfies. So he's not just the strength
[23:17] giver, but he's the satisfier. And I
[23:19] thought, oh my, that's another way we're
[23:21] persuaded. We draw strength from him and
[23:24] then we're satisfied. That's why Jesus
[23:27] would say, "My sheep will hear my voice
[23:29] and a stranger they will not follow
[23:32] because my sheep IS GOING TO BE
[23:34] SATISFIED WITH THE STRENGTH that they're
[23:36] BRINGING FROM ME." HALLELUJAH. AND
[23:39] THAT'S HOW THE BRIDE IS PERSUADED AND
[23:42] STAGGERING NOT AT THE WORD of the Lord
[23:44] is because he he or she is drawing
[23:47] strength and IS SATISFIED FROM the word
[23:50] of Almighty God. You see, so many times
[23:53] we we get one or the other where we're
[23:55] we're drawing strength from the word,
[23:57] but we're not sufficiently impressed or
[24:00] we might be sufficiently impressed, but
[24:02] we fail to draw strength from the word.
[24:04] And I say this evening, maybe you're
[24:06] maybe you're a little discouraged, maybe
[24:08] you're in a trial, but the brand
[24:10] Matelis, you're either coming into a
[24:12] trial, going through a trial, or you're
[24:14] about to go into one, right? He says you
[24:16] either let me rephrase that. YOU'RE
[24:18] EITHER COMING OUT OF A TRIAL, in the
[24:20] middle of a trial, or about to come into
[24:22] a trial. So the every one of us is going
[24:25] to go through hard times, but just rest
[24:28] ASSURED THAT OUR SHADYI IS still a
[24:31] strengthgiver. Hallelujah. And it's
[24:33] incredible because the Bible would tell
[24:35] us that that the Lord would, the
[24:38] almighty God, which is a Shadi, would
[24:40] appear to Abraham and would say, "Walk
[24:42] with me. Walk before me." AND SO IT
[24:45] WASN'T Abraham looking for El Shadi. It
[24:48] was El Shadi looking for Abraham and
[24:50] saying come walk WITH ME. AND COULD YOU
[24:52] IMAGINE ABRAHAM thinking I'm old. I
[24:54] don't got the strength. AND THEN GOD
[24:56] COULD SAY I'M THE STRENGTH GIVER. THAT'S
[24:58] THE REASON I'M SAYING WALK WITH ME
[25:00] BECAUSE I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE
[25:02] STRENGTH. AND MANY TIMES WE FEEL LIKE WE
[25:05] DON'T GOT the strength to get up and
[25:06] walk with the Lord. But he is still our
[25:08] shady guy. HE IS STILL THE STRENGTH
[25:11] GIVER WHEN WE'RE WEAK IN OUR JOURNEY.
[25:13] when we're maybe perplexed and maybe
[25:15] discouraged, WE CAN COME ON a midweek
[25:17] service and as the word comes across, it
[25:20] is a WORD IN THE RIGHT SEASON THAT IT
[25:22] CAN STRENGTHEN AND ENCOURAGE THAT YOU
[25:25] CAN GET GET A HOLD OF OUR SHY EYE AND
[25:28] DRAW SOME STRENGTH for for your life.
[25:31] You believe that this morning that he is
[25:33] still our shy eye and it's incredible
[25:36] because brother Brandham would say then
[25:38] you say in divine healing, brother
[25:39] Brandham, will God heal me? He says your
[25:42] Abraham's seed, he has ALREADY HEALED
[25:45] YOU. HALLELUJAH. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
[25:47] resting upon is El Shadi. He's already
[25:51] done it. And so we're just resting in
[25:53] him. A and the reason why I believe this
[25:57] is the most deceitful age is because the
[26:00] devil wants to destroy the influence of
[26:03] this message. Brother Brandham, he he
[26:05] would he would tell us that that if we
[26:07] can that the the reason why that the
[26:10] that the the scribes and the Pharisees
[26:12] were after Jesus was because they were
[26:15] trying to destroy his influence before
[26:17] the people. And he br say they were
[26:20] jealous. And so they were trying to
[26:22] destroy the influence before the people.
[26:25] And he says so is it today. He says if
[26:28] they can destroy the influence of the
[26:30] message before the people, he says they
[26:33] got this whole thing whipped. And I
[26:35] thought, oh my, that's why it's the most
[26:38] deceitful age. And and I hope this is
[26:40] okay, brother John. That that's the
[26:42] reason why there's so many voices on
[26:44] YouTube with with trying to discourage
[26:46] the authority of the word and websites
[26:48] and and so-called preachers that are
[26:51] saying, "He missed it here. He done this
[26:52] wrong. He done that wrong." It's they're
[26:54] trying to destroy the influence of this
[26:58] message to your life where it's whooped
[27:00] in your life. YOU KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE? I
[27:03] THINK IT'S TIME that that we get off of
[27:05] the YouTube and listen to the tapes for
[27:06] oursel. Is that okay? Instead of trying
[27:09] to figure out what somebody else says,
[27:11] WHAT ABOUT WHAT GOD SAID? INSTEAD OF
[27:13] GETTING ON A WEBSITE AND SAY SEEING WHAT
[27:15] THIS PODCAST SAID OR OR WHAT THIS
[27:17] TEACHER SAYS, WHAT ABOUT WHAT GOD SAID
[27:20] THROUGH A MESSENGER IN THIS GENERATION?
[27:23] THAT'S WHAT GOD WILL BACK UP. GOD AIN'T
[27:25] BACKING UP SOME PODCASTER. GOD AIN'T
[27:27] BACKING UP SOME WEBSITE. BUT GOD IS
[27:29] BACKING UP. THUS SAYAITH THE LORD THAT
[27:32] HE HAS GIVEN IN this generation. THAT'S
[27:35] WHY CHRIST WAS SO confident when he says
[27:38] my sheep will know my voice. I KNOW
[27:40] THEM. THEY FOLLOW ME BECAUSE THEY KNOW
[27:43] NOT THE VOICE OF STRANGERS. THERE MIGHT
[27:45] BE STRANGERS THAT IS OUT THERE TRYING to
[27:47] destroy the influence. But I believe God
[27:50] has some sheep here that tonight THAT IS
[27:52] ANCHORED NOT IN SOME PODCAST BUT IS
[27:55] ANCHORED NOT IN A IN YOUR PASTOR BUT IS
[27:58] ANCHORED IN THUS SAYETH THE LORD FOR
[28:01] YOURSELF that when VOICES DO COME YOU'RE
[28:04] already persuaded. HALLELUJAH. WHEN AN
[28:07] influence comes trying to destroy the
[28:09] influence of this word you're already
[28:11] persuaded. You're satisfied. You're
[28:14] impressed with the word that is in our
[28:16] midst. And the reason why he he's trying
[28:20] to destroy the influence is because if
[28:22] you're not walking by faith, you're just
[28:25] pursuing. And brother Brandon, he would
[28:28] preach the message called pursuming,
[28:30] right? He would say it's the venture
[28:31] without authority. So you're walking
[28:34] with the word, but you're not walking
[28:36] with the authority of the word. You
[28:38] remember whenever whenever uh uh uh I
[28:40] believe it was a parent would bring a
[28:42] bring a sick child to Jesus and would
[28:44] say we we took him to your disciples and
[28:47] yet they could not heal him. Jesus would
[28:49] sit there and would cast the devil out
[28:51] of him. And the disciples would ask THE
[28:53] QUESTION, HOW COME WE couldn't do it?
[28:55] And what would Jesus say? Because of the
[28:58] weakness of your faith. You didn't have
[28:59] the faith to do it. And brother
[29:01] Brandham, he would tell us that they had
[29:03] the word. They had the that they had the
[29:05] power to do it, but didn't have the
[29:08] authority to do it. And so, they had the
[29:10] word in their midst, but they didn't
[29:12] have the faith to operate THE WORD. OR
[29:14] IN other words, the influence of it WAS
[29:17] DESTROYED. AND SO, I DON'T believe that
[29:19] God wants a bride that is pursuing. I
[29:22] BELIEVE GOD WANTS A BRIDE THAT is
[29:25] resting in the authority of the word OF
[29:28] THE HOUR. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE JUST ONLY IF
[29:31] YOU'RE only pursuing, THERE'S THERE'S NO
[29:34] CONFIDENCE IN the word of the Lord. And
[29:36] and brother Brandham, he would say, "It
[29:38] is written over in in St. John, I think
[29:41] about the 15th chapter, if you abide in
[29:44] me and my word abide in you." See, the
[29:46] word abides in you. See, then ask what
[29:49] you will and it'll be done. Because it's
[29:52] not you, it's the word that's in you.
[29:54] And the word is God. See, God in you,
[29:57] God is the word. In the beginning was
[29:59] the word. The word was with God and the
[30:01] word was God and the word was made flesh
[30:04] and dwelt among us. Now in the return of
[30:06] the Holy Spirit bringing the word in us
[30:09] and it abiding in there, then it's not
[30:12] you that speaks, it's the word itself
[30:15] coming out. So it is the word that will
[30:18] perform the work. SO NOW YOU KNOW WHY
[30:20] WE'RE living in the most deceitful age
[30:23] because you HAVE TO ABIDE IN the word in
[30:26] order for the word to abide in you. So
[30:28] if he can get YOU TO NOT ABIDE in the
[30:30] word, you're you're you're not with your
[30:33] authority because it's the word that
[30:35] speaks out of you. You remember the in
[30:37] the book of Revelations, it was John
[30:39] that was commissioned to go take the
[30:41] book, right? Eat the book and then
[30:43] prophesy again. He couldn't prophesy
[30:45] again unless he ate the book. But once
[30:48] HE ATE THE BOOK, THE WORDS of the BOOK
[30:50] WAS NOW COMING OUT OF HIM. AND I BELIEVE
[30:53] HE WAS OUR TYPE. AND AS WE GET IN THE
[30:55] BOOK, GET IN THIS WORD, THAT BECOMES OUR
[30:58] VOICE, THAT BECOMES OUR TESTIMONY, THAT
[31:01] BECOMES OUR CONFESSION. I BELIEVE IT'S
[31:03] TIME THAT WE GET ALL OF THE NEGATIVE
[31:06] CONFESSION OUT OF OUR MOUTH AND only
[31:08] speak one thing, THAT IS THE WORD OF THE
[31:10] LORD. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT WE'RE GOING
[31:12] THROUGH. MY MY MY CONFESSION IS GOING TO
[31:15] BE A POSITIVE CONFESSION. HALLELUJAH. I
[31:18] MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING TO
[31:19] HAPPEN. I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND HOW I'M
[31:21] GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS TRIAL, BUT MY
[31:23] CONFESSION IS A POSITIVE WORD-BASED
[31:26] CONFESSION. HALLELUJAH. Because I'm
[31:29] walking with authority and it's the word
[31:32] that is coming out of my mouth.
[31:34] Hallelujah.
[31:36] And you can look on how how whenever
[31:38] that when Jesus was in the wilderness
[31:40] being tempted, what would the devil say
[31:42] to him? If thou be the son of God, he
[31:45] didn't come out and say, "You're not the
[31:46] son of God." He knew better than that.
[31:48] the devil couldn't get him that way, you
[31:50] know, and and I I I remember as a kid I
[31:54] I would have an experience with the Lord
[31:56] and and so I knew that the Lord was
[31:58] real. I I had seen experience I had
[32:01] experiences myself. I had seen things
[32:03] happen uh like my parents prayers being
[32:06] answered. I had seen God for myself. And
[32:09] so the devil couldn't come to me and say
[32:11] God wasn't real. You know that he
[32:14] couldn't get me on there. But what he
[32:16] could do was say God don't love you.
[32:18] Right. And so here the devil comes to
[32:20] Jesus AND HE DIDN'T SAY YOU'RE NOT THE
[32:23] son of God, BUT IF THOU BE the son of
[32:26] God, turn these stones into bread. HE
[32:28] WAS TRYING TO PUT make him pursue if
[32:32] thou be. Then the question mark is on
[32:34] the back of his head. BUT BUT YOU KNOW
[32:36] WHAT JESUS WOULD DO? He would show us
[32:38] how to fight. But the Brandon would say
[32:40] he didn't use his powers, but he got THE
[32:42] WORD AND HE POUNDED HIM OUT OF THE RING
[32:44] WITH HIM. AND WHAT'S incredible is here
[32:47] the devil comes with scripture, you
[32:49] know, if there'll be the son of God, you
[32:52] know, uh, jump from here and and as the
[32:54] Bible as the scripture says, you the
[32:57] angels will will bear thee up lest you
[32:59] dash your foot against the stone, you
[33:01] know. And so here he's quoting
[33:03] scripture, trying to get him TO PURSUE.
[33:07] BUT WHAT WOULD JESUS SAY? IT IS ALSO
[33:09] WRITTEN. YOU SEE, HE HAD A DISCERNMENT
[33:12] TO KNOW THAT THE WORD CANNOT CONDEMN ME.
[33:15] HALLELUJAH. AND I BELIEVE THE WORD DOES
[33:18] NOT CONDEMN A BELIEVER. IT MIGHT CONVICT
[33:20] A BELIEVER, BUT it does not condemn a
[33:22] believer. And the devil comes with
[33:25] scripture many times and tries TO BEAT
[33:27] YOU DOWN WITH SCRIPTURE. YOU'RE NOT GOOD
[33:29] ENOUGH. YOU SEND YOUR DAY OF GRACE AWAY.
[33:31] YOU'LL NEVER ACHIEVE ANYTHING. But we
[33:34] need some PEOPLE THAT IS PERSUADING THAT
[33:36] WILL SAY, "BUT IT IS ALSO WRITTEN. MY
[33:39] NAME IS ENGRAVED IN THE PALM OF HIS
[33:42] HAND. I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MY
[33:44] CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE SAVED, BUT ONE
[33:46] THING I KNOW, THIS PROMISES UNTO ME AND
[33:49] TO MY CHILDREN AND MY CHILDREN'S
[33:51] CHILDREN, AND AS MANY AS THE LORD OUR
[33:54] GOD SHALL CALL, IT IS ALSO WRITTEN
[33:57] BECAUSE I AM PERSUADED. HALLELUJAH. AND
[34:00] I'M RESTING IN THE WORD OF THE LORD. NO
[34:03] MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL SAYS. HALLELUJAH.
[34:05] AND NO MATTER WHAT HIS INFLUENCE IS
[34:07] SAYING, NO MATTER WHAT THEIR VOICES SAY,
[34:10] I AM PERSUADED AND I AM SUFFICIENTLY
[34:12] IMPRESSED with the word in my midst.
[34:16] Hallelujah. You see, he couldn't get him
[34:19] to he couldn't he wouldn't get him on.
[34:21] You're not the son of God. But he put a
[34:23] question there. And you know, and while
[34:26] I'm on the the the subject of a
[34:28] question, and I hope this is okay. You
[34:30] know, it's okay to have questions, but
[34:32] you know, you got to go to the right
[34:34] source to figure out the question, to
[34:36] figure out the answer. But the Brandon,
[34:38] he he he would teach us that that that
[34:40] your faith in the word of the Lord is
[34:42] like a chain, right? He says, "And we're
[34:44] hanging over hell with it, right? I
[34:46] believe it's the harvest time, brother,
[34:47] but the Brandon, he he would he would
[34:49] say that." And he says, "Your chain is
[34:51] the strongest at its weakest link." And
[34:54] he would say that something is puzzling
[34:56] you in the scripture. You know what he
[34:58] would say? He says, "Don't allow that to
[35:01] be a weakness." But he says, "Fortify
[35:03] that question." And I thought that's
[35:05] some good advice. And and how do you
[35:08] fortify your question? You know, as a
[35:10] young person, h how do you fortify your
[35:12] question? That that's how you learn.
[35:14] That's how you understand. So questions
[35:17] ain't always doubt. You remember the
[35:19] Bible would talk about how how how that
[35:21] Judas not a Scariot would ask Jesus and
[35:24] would say, "How is it that thou will
[35:26] manifest yourself unto us and not unto
[35:29] the world?" And and and and I and I love
[35:31] that scripture because he had a
[35:33] question, but he clarified himself. I'M
[35:36] JUDAS, NOT A SCARIOT. I might have a
[35:38] question, BUT I'M NOT DOUBTING LIKE
[35:41] JUDAS is doubting. You see? And so
[35:43] that's the difference between you and
[35:44] serpency. You might have a question, but
[35:47] you got discernment on where to FIND THE
[35:50] ANSWER. HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWING
[35:52] THAT QUESTION TO take away the influence
[35:55] of this word. And so, HOW DO YOU FORTIFY
[35:58] that question? Take Judas not a scariot
[36:01] for example. He didn't go to the scribes
[36:03] and say, "Hey, how is it that he's
[36:05] manifesting himself to us and not to
[36:07] you?" HE WOULDN'T HAVE GOT THE RIGHT
[36:08] ANSWER. THEY WOULD HAVE SAID, "WHAT DO
[36:10] YOU MEAN? You know, he he's this and
[36:11] he's that." He didn't go up to the
[36:13] Pharisees and say, "Hey, I got A
[36:15] QUESTION FOR YOU. HOW IS IT THAT HE'S
[36:17] MANIFESTING HIMSELF TO ME and not TO
[36:19] YOU?" BUT WHERE DID HE GO with this
[36:21] question? He went to THE SOURCE.
[36:24] HALLELUJAH. HE WENT TO THE ONE THAT HAD
[36:26] THE ANSWER. AND THAT'S INCREDIBLE to me.
[36:29] As brother Brandham, he would tell us
[36:30] that if there's a Bible question,
[36:32] there's a Bible answer. So, in other
[36:35] words, if you got a question about the
[36:37] about the Godhead, you're not going to
[36:39] go to a Catholic, right, and say, "Hey,
[36:41] what? I got a question for you. Or if
[36:43] you got a question about water baptism,
[36:45] you're not going to go to the Baptist or
[36:47] or go to this one or THAT ONE. YOU'RE
[36:49] FORTIFYING YOUR QUESTION by coming to
[36:51] THE RIGHT SOURCE. HALLELUJAH. AND I
[36:54] BELIEVE THE MESSAGE, BROTHER BRANDON,
[36:56] MATELIS, WE'VE GOT THE ANSWER TO the
[36:58] devil's question. So I believe that WE
[37:00] CAN FORTIFY OURSEL IN THE MESSAGE OF THE
[37:03] HOUR. YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND
[37:05] EVERYTHING, but you're not allowing
[37:07] VOICES TO PUT DOUBT ON that and allow it
[37:11] to be a weakness. Hallelujah. But even
[37:14] though you have a question, you're
[37:16] fortifying your your question in the
[37:18] word of the Lord. And and it's
[37:20] incredible because you know, as I quoted
[37:23] earlier, Brother Brandham would say,
[37:25] it's the greatest battle ever fought and
[37:27] it's right in your mind. and and and
[37:28] what he's trying to do is he's trying to
[37:32] get you to pursue and he and he works in
[37:35] questions where he tries questions where
[37:38] you're where where he he tries to get
[37:40] you to pursue where you know and I and
[37:43] I've experienced it myself as a young
[37:45] person and he even I don't understand
[37:47] everything. I'm sure brother John
[37:48] probably don't even understand
[37:50] everything. But and you know and it's
[37:52] easy where the devil pl plays with the
[37:54] mind and says you don't understand
[37:56] everything. You must not believe it or
[37:58] you don't understand this. You you must
[38:00] not be the bride. You don't understand
[38:02] this. You you must not be this. God must
[38:04] not called you. You must not be for
[38:06] this. And what he's doing is he's trying
[38:09] to discredit the word in your heart. But
[38:12] I say it's time we we use some
[38:15] discernment and say Satan, I don't care
[38:17] what you say, it's a lie and I'm
[38:20] fortifying myself. But and brother
[38:23] Brandon would tell a story of a of a of
[38:26] a preacher I believe. And he would get a
[38:28] telephone pole and he would put it put
[38:30] it out there and the congregation would
[38:32] get together and he would say, "Do you
[38:34] think I can walk across this log and
[38:36] back that says, "Oh yes, the Lord is
[38:37] with you." He walks across it, comes
[38:39] back. He says, "You think I can push
[38:41] this wheelbarrow across it?" They says,
[38:42] "Yes, the Lord is with you." He goes
[38:44] across, comes back, and then he says,
[38:46] "Do you think I can push a person in
[38:48] this wheelbarrow?" They says, "Oh yeah,
[38:50] the Lord is with you." And the man says,
[38:52] "Okay, get in." They says, "Oh, NO."
[38:55] BROTHER BROWN WOULD SAY, "IT'S DIFFERENT
[38:57] when you're included in it yourself."
[39:00] And I thought, "That is so good that we
[39:02] can say amen and amen, amen, and amen."
[39:06] And that's great, but are you included
[39:08] in it yourself? Come on now. You see,
[39:11] you see it ain't you AND THE BRIDE. YOU
[39:13] ARE THE BRIDE. YOU REMEMBER THE BOY THAT
[39:15] never seen a a reflection of himself
[39:18] before. He would go up and he would see
[39:19] a mirror, right? He would wave. The boy
[39:22] would wave, right? There was two boys.
[39:23] He would jump, the boy would jump. AND
[39:25] HE WAS EXCITED. BUT THE CLOSER HE GOT,
[39:28] the two boys became one. And a
[39:30] revelation STRUCK THAT BOY. MAMA, THAT
[39:32] BOY IS ME. HALLELUJAH. AND THAT'S WHAT
[39:35] HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY IS PERSUADED. THE
[39:38] MORE THEY GET INTO THIS MESSAGE, THE
[39:40] MORE THEY REALIZE, I'M WHO THIS MESSAGE
[39:42] IS talking about. And that's WHAT
[39:44] HAPPENS WHENEVER YOUR PASTOR'S PREACHING
[39:46] AND YOU SAY, "AMEN." YOU SAYS,
[39:48] "PREACHER, THAT'S ME." WHEN YOU SAY,
[39:50] "HALLELUJAH, PREACHER, THAT'S I'M WHO
[39:53] YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT." HALLELUJAH. And
[39:56] we're walking with actual authority
[39:58] because we see yourself. We're included
[40:00] in ourself. and and and and and
[40:04] sometimes it's it's it's hard to see
[40:07] yourself the way the word sees us. And
[40:08] that is a hard thing sometimes. And you
[40:11] remember how the the Bible would talk
[40:13] about how how that an angel would come
[40:15] to Gideon and would say, "You're a
[40:17] mighty man of valor." Y'all remember the
[40:19] story? And if you look up that word
[40:21] valor, it means wealthy. And I think
[40:23] it's it's a powerful point there because
[40:26] here the angel says, "You're a mighty
[40:28] man of wealth." And what would Gideon
[40:30] say? I my my my my family's poor and I'm
[40:33] the least in my father's house. Here the
[40:36] angel was letting him know the way God
[40:38] sees him, but he's seeing himself
[40:40] DIFFERENTLY THAN THE WAY GOD sees him.
[40:43] And you see, we need to look at oursel
[40:45] the way God LOOKS AT US. OH, COME ON
[40:48] NOW. CUZ what does complexes do? It
[40:51] makes us unsatisfied with who we are.
[40:54] And we lose confidence where we're not
[40:56] resting in the way GOD SEES US. GOD
[40:58] LOOKS at us and SAYS, "YOU'RE
[40:59] BEAUTIFUL." GOD LOOKS AT YOU AND SAYS,
[41:01] "YOU'RE FEARFULLY and wonderfully made."
[41:04] But yet we're we're we we we we believe
[41:06] the way the devil looks at us. OH,
[41:09] HALLELUJAH. BUT I don't want to believe
[41:10] the way the devil LOOKS AT ME. I WANT TO
[41:12] BELIEVE THE WAY GOD LOOKS AT ME. GOD
[41:15] LOOKS ME AT AS HIS BRIDE. GOD LOOKS AT
[41:17] YOU as as his virtuous, bloodwashed
[41:20] bride for himself, a people for his
[41:23] name's sake. You see? So, we're looking
[41:25] at oursel and our situations through the
[41:28] filter of God's word. You remember
[41:30] whenever whenever uh whenever Elijah
[41:33] would be in the cave and he's running
[41:34] away from Jezebel? Y you remember that?
[41:36] And it's incredible because it was right
[41:39] before this was the Mount Carmel
[41:40] showdown, right? It was right. It was as
[41:43] at the Mount Coral showed him where the
[41:44] pillar of fire would or the uh the fire
[41:47] would come down and and would lick up
[41:49] the sacrifice, lick up the water, lick
[41:51] lick up the wood, and and then the
[41:53] people would go and be killing all of
[41:55] the all of the the prophets of Baal. And
[41:57] and now he's running FROM JEZEBEL
[42:00] BECAUSE JEZEBEL'S MAD AT HIM. AND HE
[42:02] CRIES UNTO THE LORD AND WOULD SAY that
[42:04] and that they they tore down your
[42:06] altars. THEY THEY'VE DESTROYED ALL OF
[42:08] YOUR prophets and now I'm the only one
[42:10] THAT'S LEFT. WHAT WOULD God say to him?
[42:12] He would look AT HIM AND WOULD SAY,
[42:13] "WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THERE IS STILL 7,000
[42:16] THAT HAS NOT BOWED THEIR KNEE TO BAIL."
[42:19] IN OTHER WORDS, the way you're looking
[42:20] AT THE SITUATION IS DIFFERENTLY THAN THE
[42:24] WAY I'M LOOKING AT IT. OH, COME ON NOW.
[42:26] AND SOMETIMES we can get in the woe is
[42:28] me attitude and we can't see a way out.
[42:31] ALL WE SEE IS THE PROBLEM. ALL WE SEE IS
[42:33] THE CIRCUMSTANCES. All we see is THE
[42:35] TROUBLES. AND GOD'S LOOKING AT YOU AND
[42:37] SAYING, "YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT IT THE
[42:38] RIGHT WAY." THAT'S THIS IS NOT YOUR END.
[42:41] YOU'RE MORE THAN CONQUERORS THROUGH
[42:43] CHRIST WHO STRENGTHENS YOU. GREATER IS
[42:45] HE THAT IS IN YOU than he that IS IN THE
[42:48] WORLD. LOOK AT IT THE WAY I'M looking at
[42:50] it. OH, HALLELUJAH. Brother Brandon
[42:53] would tell us that that God is always
[42:55] going to try his sons. And so the reason
[42:57] you're going through a hard time is
[42:59] because God knows you're one of his.
[43:02] Come on now. And he's not sending you
[43:03] through it for your end. He's sending it
[43:06] through. He's sending you through it TO
[43:08] STRENGTHEN WHAT YOU have on the inside.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we have to look at it
[43:14] the way God's looking at it, which is a
[43:16] hard time, a hard thing sometimes, ain't
[43:18] it, to look at it when when all you see
[43:20] is rock bottom. When all you see is THE
[43:23] IS THE BELLY OF THE WELL, you know, but
[43:25] yet but yet there was already a promise
[43:28] way back when Solomon was building a
[43:30] temple, saying, "If there is anyone that
[43:32] is ever in distress, may they look
[43:34] towards this temple." Oh my. AND CALL ON
[43:37] YOUR NAME. MAY YOU GO AND deliver them."
[43:39] And now HERE'S JONAH WITH LYING
[43:41] VANITIES. HE WOULD SAY he would look at
[43:43] the brand and say, "You looked over
[43:45] there was Wells belly. He looked over
[43:46] there was Wells belly. BUT YET GOD
[43:49] ALREADY PROVIDED A WAY OUT OF IT." OH,
[43:52] come on now. Before you was ever IN YOUR
[43:54] SITUATION, GOD ALREADY PROVIDED A WAY
[43:57] OUT OF IT. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT JONAH HAD
[43:59] TO DO? He said, "I WILL LOOK TO WHERE MY
[44:02] HELP COMES FROM." HE WOULD TURN HIS FACE
[44:04] TOWARDS THE HOLY TEMPLE AND WOULD CRY
[44:06] UNTO THE LORD. YOU KNOW WHERE THE
[44:08] BRANDHAM SAYS HE didn't know which way
[44:09] the temple was, BUT IT WAS INSPIRATION.
[44:12] HALLELUJAH. AND YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW MANY
[44:15] TIMES HOW YOU'RE GOING TO SURVIVE. BUT
[44:17] LET INSPIRATION STRIKE THE HEART FROM
[44:20] THE WORD OF THE LORD. AND YOU LOOK
[44:22] TOWARDS THE WORD AND SAY, "GREATER IS HE
[44:24] THAT IS IN ME." I'M LOOKING FROM WHERE
[44:27] MY HELP COMETH FROM. MY HELP COMETH FROM
[44:29] THE LORD. IT DON'T COME IT DON'T come
[44:32] from friends. It don't come from from
[44:34] EVEN THE PASTOR. BUT IT COMES FROM THE
[44:36] WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD THAT HAS PERSUADED
[44:39] MY HEART. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M resting
[44:42] in. Hallelujah. Though the gates of hell
[44:45] comes against me, they are not going to
[44:47] prevail. Hallelujah. Do you believe that
[44:49] this we can be so persuaded that even
[44:53] when we're seeing everything go wrong,
[44:55] we're we're like Jonah. They're lying
[44:57] vanities.
[44:58] And brother, you know, brother Brandham,
[45:00] when he talks about Jonah, he would say,
[45:02] "You think you have a hard time?" He
[45:03] says, "You've got nothing compared to
[45:05] Jonah." He's sitting there in the belly
[45:07] of a whale. Brother Brandham was saying,
[45:09] "How did he survive down there?" He
[45:11] says, "God provided an oxygen mask down
[45:13] there." You know, AND AND IT'S
[45:15] INCREDIBLE TO THINK THAT, you know, that
[45:17] that God had everything under control
[45:20] that it was impossible to survive that.
[45:23] Oh, come on. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. ANY
[45:25] OTHER MAN would have not survived that.
[45:27] But God's elected did. Come on. And now
[45:30] and now ANYBODY ELSE COULD have been
[45:32] going through your situation, WOULD HAVE
[45:34] LOST THEIR MIND, would have given up a
[45:36] long time ago. BUT YOU'RE THE ELECTED OF
[45:39] GOD. AND HE'S PROVIDED a way of escape
[45:42] out of it.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we're resting in
[45:46] him. We're resting in the word of the
[45:48] Lord. And and brother Brham, he would
[45:50] talk about Ruth and he would say when
[45:53] Ruth was resting, it was a type of the
[45:55] church
[45:56] resting in the promises of God. He says
[45:59] we have we have the earnest now of our
[46:01] salvation. We're not worried whether
[46:03] we're going over there or not. He says
[46:05] we're going. He says that's right. God
[46:08] said so. God promised it and we've got
[46:11] the earnest. Amen. Done been received.
[46:13] He says Christ has accepted us. No way
[46:17] to get away from it now. We were there.
[46:20] And and I like how brother Brandham,
[46:22] he's putting it. He says, "We're not
[46:24] worried whether we're going to get there
[46:25] or not." In other words, we're not
[46:26] worried if we're going to make a
[46:27] rapture. He says, "We're already
[46:29] accepted." And and and I like how
[46:32] brother Brandon would put that Christ
[46:34] has accepted us. And that is something
[46:36] that that the devil fights us so hard is
[46:39] an acceptance. How many has ever fought
[46:41] that? you know, you know, maybe it's
[46:43] somebody that that you look up to or or
[46:45] or a peer or or somebody you admire. And
[46:49] if you don't feel like you're accepted,
[46:51] you're never going to have confidence
[46:52] with that person, right? And when you
[46:54] don't have confidence in that person,
[46:56] what happens? It's complexes that rise
[46:59] up. Oh, that person didn't shake my
[47:00] hand. That person didn't talk to me.
[47:02] They must have something against me.
[47:04] Everybody knows what I'm talking about.
[47:05] It's because you don't feel like you're
[47:07] accepted. And the devil does that many
[47:10] times with God where we don't feel like
[47:12] we're accepted. But the Bible says we're
[47:14] accepted in the beloved. No matter what
[47:17] the feelings are, we are already
[47:19] accepted. And and the and the reason why
[47:22] the devil don't want you to feel
[47:24] accepted is because he wants you to
[47:26] serve God out of fear. And I won't hold
[47:29] you much longer here tonight. I know
[47:30] it's a midweek, but the devil wants
[47:33] wants us to serve God out of fear. And
[47:35] the Bible will even tell us in Proverbs
[47:37] 1:7, the fear of the Lord is the
[47:40] beginning of knowledge, but fools
[47:42] despise wisdom and instruction. And so,
[47:45] it's almost, you know, the devil has a
[47:47] right to put fear on us, but that's not
[47:49] the case. Brother Brandham, he would
[47:51] teach us there's a difference between
[47:53] the fear that the devil brings and the
[47:56] fear of the Lord. He says the fear of
[47:58] the Lord means reverence. It means
[48:00] respect. And so if the devil comes and
[48:03] he wants us to worship God out of fear,
[48:06] we're afraid to make a mistake. We're
[48:08] afraid of messing up. We're afraid that
[48:10] that we won't be good enough. We're
[48:11] afraid that we're going to sin our day
[48:14] of grace. So William and I I remember as
[48:16] a kid, and I'm sure some of the brothers
[48:18] might may may understand what I'm
[48:20] talking about. I I remember as a kid,
[48:22] every time mom says, "Hey, dad, want
[48:24] you?" I got scared. Anybody know what
[48:27] I'm talking about? It's not that I was
[48:29] afraid of dad. It was I respected him
[48:31] and I'm like, man, what did I do wrong?
[48:33] You know, I do something wrong. It's not
[48:36] that I was scared of him. There was a
[48:37] reverence there that I didn't want him
[48:39] to be displeased with me. Hallelujah.
[48:42] And that's the way it is with God. We're
[48:44] not afraid of him. We respect him. And
[48:47] since we respect him, we want to make
[48:49] sure we honor his word. We want to make
[48:51] sure he approves of my worship. He
[48:53] approves of my home. He approves of my
[48:56] church. HE APPROVES OF MY LIFESTYLE.
[48:58] APPROVES OF THE WAY I DRESS, PRO
[49:00] APPROVES OF the way of the way I talk.
[49:03] And and let me say this, you Christ has
[49:05] already accepted you. SO WE'RE NOT
[49:08] TRYING TO MAKE him approved uh where we
[49:11] get his approval. HE'S ALREADY APPROVED
[49:13] US. HALLELUJAH. And so it does away WITH
[49:17] ALL OF THE FEAR OF TRYING TO BE GOOD
[49:19] ENOUGH WHEN HE made us good enough. Oh,
[49:22] let me just bust your bubble. You'll
[49:24] never be good enough in your OWN
[49:26] ABILITY, BUT HE HAS made us GOOD ENOUGH
[49:29] AND CHRIST HAS ACCEPTED US. SO REST IN
[49:32] WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT you and know that he
[49:35] has already accepted me. Hallelujah. And
[49:39] that does away with all of the fear
[49:41] because you know if he can get you to
[49:44] worship out of fear that takes away your
[49:46] strength. It takes away it takes away
[49:48] your confidence. And the Bible tells us
[49:50] to come before his throne with boldness.
[49:52] you know that that's the way we come
[49:54] before God is it's not an arrogancy but
[49:57] it's a boldness that you promised it to
[49:59] me and I believe you can give it to me
[50:02] but you see many times it's it's we
[50:05] become nervous with the word of the Lord
[50:08] and and and brother Brandon would be in
[50:10] a prayer line one time and he he he
[50:12] would say that he would say just pray
[50:14] now he said it's not my faith it's your
[50:17] faith and he's just talking with the
[50:19] people and he would stop and he would
[50:21] say you know, uh, if he doesn't speak in
[50:23] a world where we're here in vain and and
[50:26] he says, "If I can just get somebody
[50:27] that has faith and and he's talking to
[50:30] the people." And he stops and he says,
[50:31] "Don't be nervous now." He says, "Don't
[50:33] be nervous." He says, "Just relax." And
[50:36] he says, "You'll never get anywhere with
[50:38] being nervous." And he and he's going
[50:40] and he's talking and he stops and he
[50:42] says it again, "Don't be nervous." He
[50:44] says, "Just reverently before God
[50:47] present your needs." And so he's talking
[50:49] and we know that nervousness is a form
[50:51] of fear. Right? So he's he's telling the
[50:54] people, don't be afraid, but be
[50:56] reverent. In other words, don't have the
[50:59] fear of the devil. Have the fear of the
[51:01] Lord. And he's sitting there and he's
[51:03] talking with them. And then he stops and
[51:05] he says, "Here it is. Thank you, Lord."
[51:07] And he says, "I take every spirit under
[51:10] my control for the glory of almighty
[51:12] God." And he stops and he says and he
[51:14] says now the angel of the Lord that's in
[51:15] that picture he said he's moving through
[51:17] the audience right now. What was it? He
[51:19] had to condition the people to NOT BE
[51:22] AFRAID OF the Lord and be nervous of the
[51:24] supernatural but to just respect it and
[51:27] reverently enter into the worship of the
[51:30] Lord.
[51:31] And and I love bits and pieces of things
[51:33] like that cuz he's showing us how to
[51:36] fight cuz you never get anywhere being
[51:38] afraid of the supernatural cuz many
[51:40] times it's easy to become afraid of the
[51:43] supernatural, right? Where you what am I
[51:45] going to do? What's going to happen if I
[51:47] come under the anointing of the Holy
[51:49] Ghost? How am I going to act? HOW HOW AM
[51:50] I going to talk? What's everybody going
[51:52] to think of me? And you become afraid of
[51:54] it instead of respecting it and just
[51:57] honoring what God can do through me. You
[52:00] remember whenever the the Bible would
[52:02] talk about how that uh uh the disciples
[52:05] were on the boat and there was a storm
[52:07] that was blowing it back and forth.
[52:08] Y'all remember the story? And the Bible
[52:10] would tell us that Christ was walking
[52:12] upon the water and they thought he was a
[52:16] spirit, right? And the Bible says that
[52:18] that they became afraid. And and it's
[52:21] incredible cuz brother Brandham he he
[52:23] would tell that story and would say that
[52:26] that the very thing the very one that
[52:28] could save them they was afraid of and I
[52:31] thought oh my many times it's the same
[52:34] way today the only thing that can fix
[52:36] our problems we're afraid of the only
[52:39] thing that can save our children we're
[52:41] afraid of or the only thing that CAN
[52:43] GIVE REVIVAL IN THE church is is that
[52:45] we're afraid of it and it's incredible
[52:48] because it would be Peter And and I just
[52:50] love Peter, you know, because Peter was
[52:52] the one that would cut cut a man's ear
[52:54] off. He was a he was a he was ambitious.
[52:57] He was the one that that would deny
[52:59] Christ, you know, and he he would be
[53:01] Peter. He would say, "Lord, if it is
[53:03] you, bid me to come." And I thought that
[53:06] that that that's the way I want to be.
[53:08] Peter knew it was impossible to walk on
[53:10] the water. It was impossible. But if he
[53:13] bids me to come, it's possible.
[53:16] Hallelujah. And I think, man, that's the
[53:17] way I want to be. It's impossible to
[53:20] make a rapture, but if he says I CAN DO
[53:22] IT, I CAN do it. I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND
[53:24] HOW IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT I BELIEVE
[53:26] IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. If he says my
[53:28] children can be saved, I DON'T KNOW HOW
[53:30] IT'S going to happen, BUT IF HE SAID IT,
[53:32] I believe it. Bid me to come. And so,
[53:35] here Peter, you know, unlike the other
[53:37] ones, they were afraid, but now he's
[53:39] walking upon the water. And this is
[53:41] where many of us are. We're we're
[53:43] walking with God. We're we're resting in
[53:45] the will of the Lord. We're resting in
[53:47] what God says we can do. But then
[53:49] problems comes, trials comes. And and
[53:52] brother Brandham says that that he
[53:54] wasn't walking on water. He was walking
[53:56] on substance, which faith is the
[53:58] substance. So he was walking upon his
[54:00] faith. And as he's walking, brother
[54:02] Brandham would tell us that the wave
[54:04] started to started to to get big and
[54:07] Peter got afraid. And as he became
[54:09] afraid, he started to sink. And I
[54:12] thought, "Oh my, many of us get there
[54:13] sometimes, don't we? We we start to sink
[54:16] in our fear. We start to sink in our
[54:18] trials. Start to sink in our
[54:20] circumstances. And here God's the one
[54:22] that told us to walk, you know, walk
[54:24] with me and be thou perfect. Walk with
[54:26] me. It was Enoch that would walk with
[54:28] God until he was raptured out of here.
[54:30] And he's our type. We're walking with
[54:32] God. And here is he was sinking. I love
[54:35] it. Because Peter wasn't responsible for
[54:38] walking on the water. Christ was.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wasn't responsible to
[54:42] fulfill the word. Christ was all he HAD
[54:45] TO DO WAS REACH UP and as he was sinking
[54:48] in his fear, sinking in his anxiety,
[54:50] sinking in in his untrustness, HERE
[54:53] WOULD COME GOD would reach down his hand
[54:56] and we see I got you. And maybe some of
[54:58] us are there tonight as our as our
[55:01] musician comes tonight. Sometimes we get
[55:03] there where we're where we're sinking in
[55:05] our trials. were sinking in in our
[55:08] troubles and and and it's hard to trust
[55:10] God, but yet he would come his word. He
[55:13] sent his word and healed our diseases.
[55:15] You know, he would send a word in the
[55:18] right season and would say, "You might
[55:20] be in a hard time right now, but I'm
[55:22] walking with you."
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Are you thankful that God walks with us?
[55:26] &gt;&gt; It ain't just us walking in our own
[55:28] ability, but it's him walking with us.
[55:31] Because if he walks with us, he's the
[55:33] one that can change situations.
[55:35] Hallelujah. And I believe he's walking
[55:37] with us. You remember the story of the
[55:40] the footprints on the sands of time. And
[55:43] I know that's a it's a common story, but
[55:46] the man, you know, when he he he'd have
[55:48] a dream, I believe, and he's talking to
[55:50] the Lord and he would say, "How come you
[55:52] left me?" And the Lord would say, "What
[55:54] do you mean?" He says, "Look, there was
[55:56] two two sets of footprints until the
[55:58] hardest time of my life when I needed
[56:00] you the most, and yet there's only one
[56:02] foot one set of footprints." And the
[56:04] Lord would speak back to him. I says,
[56:06] "What do you mean?" Said, "I didn't
[56:07] leave you there. That's where I picked
[56:09] you up and carried you."
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When we feel like we're all
[56:13] alone, it might we might feel that way,
[56:16] but in reality, we're resting in his
[56:19] arms. And that's why we have to rest. We
[56:23] can't fight against the word. We can't
[56:24] fight against the program of God. You
[56:26] have to give up and be carried by it.
[56:28] You remember the story of whenever the
[56:30] whenever the uh the the the preacher of
[56:33] a divine healing, he would get sick and
[56:36] would go into a coma and he would have a
[56:38] dream and he was a lumberjack. Y'all
[56:40] remember that? He and his boss would
[56:42] tell him in this dream, "Go up the
[56:44] mountain, cut down that log and bring it
[56:46] down to me." Y'all remember that? And he
[56:48] would go up, he would cut down the log
[56:50] and he would try to pick it up and he
[56:52] couldn't do it. And brother Brandon
[56:54] would tell us that the man would sit
[56:55] down and would start to cry. I can't do
[56:57] it. And why would the boss tell me to do
[56:59] something that I can't do? He's trying
[57:02] and he's trying. And then he he would
[57:05] hear a voice behind him said, "Roll it
[57:07] into the water and ride on it." He would
[57:09] look back cuz it was his boss. He looked
[57:11] and it was Christ saying, "Roll it into
[57:13] the water and ride on it." So when he
[57:16] couldn't do it, all he had to do was sit
[57:18] on it. Let the log do the rest.
[57:20] Hallelujah. Brother Brandon was saying
[57:22] God wouldn't give us something to do
[57:25] without giving us something to do it
[57:26] with. He says, "You just got to ride on
[57:28] it." He says, "If you're not on it," he
[57:30] says, "Jump on and ride on it." And that
[57:33] man, that that that preacher would wake
[57:34] up saying, "I'm riding on it. I'm riding
[57:37] on it." Right there, God would heal him.
[57:39] Hallelujah. We're not trying to make the
[57:40] word live. The word is making itself
[57:43] live in us. We're just riding on it.
[57:45] We're just resting in it. Amen. Let's
[57:47] bow our heads here this evening. Dear
[57:49] gracious heavenly father,
[57:52] Lord, we're thankful for your your
[57:54] presence and your anointing that we felt
[57:55] here tonight, Lord, thank you for the
[57:58] the inspiration of your word, Lord, that
[58:01] that can come and strengthen, Father,
[58:04] and pick us up when we're discouraged.
[58:06] Pick us up when we feel like we're
[58:08] alone, Lord. And if there's some here
[58:10] that that might be discouraged, Lord,
[58:12] might feel like like you have forsaken
[58:14] them, Lord. God, may you be El Shadi to
[58:17] them like you would come to Abraham and
[58:20] say, "Walk with me, Lord. And I ask,
[58:23] Father, that they would grab a hold of
[58:25] your word here tonight, Lord." And may
[58:27] they get some strength for the journey.
[58:29] Maybe there's some here that ain't
[58:31] satisfied, Lord. May they get into the
[58:33] word for themselves and be persuaded
[58:36] that this word is the truth and they can
[58:38] rest in it. Lord, how we love you and
[58:41] we're thankful for all of these things
[58:43] in Jesus name. Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you here tonight. Can we sing
[58:49] Amazing Grace as we as we turn her to
[58:51] our pastor? Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amazing
[58:57] grace,
[58:59] how sweet
[59:01] the sound. God bless you.
[59:18] but now
[59:21] I'm found. Let's stand together. Was
[59:24] blind,
[59:26] but now
[59:29] I see.
[59:33] was grace
[59:35] that taught
[59:38] my heart
[59:40] to fear
[59:43] and grace
[59:45] my fears
[59:48] relieved.
[59:52] How precious
[59:56] did
[59:57] that grace
[1:00:00] appear.
[1:00:02] The hour
[1:00:05] I first
[1:00:08] believed
[1:00:11] through many
[1:00:14] danger
[1:00:17] to
[1:00:19] snares.
[1:00:22] I have
[1:00:24] already
[1:00:27] come.
[1:00:31] His grace
[1:00:33] have brought
[1:00:36] me safe
[1:00:38] thus far.
[1:00:41] And grace
[1:00:44] will lead
[1:00:46] me home.
[1:00:50] When we've
[1:00:53] been there
[1:00:55] 10,000
[1:00:58] years,
[1:01:00] bright shineing
[1:01:04] as
[1:01:05] the sun
[1:01:09] we know less is
[1:01:14] to sing
[1:01:16] God's praise.
[1:01:19] And when
[1:01:21] we first
[1:01:24] beun,
[1:01:28] praise God.
[1:01:31] Praise God.
[1:01:33] Praise God.
[1:01:36] Praise God. You're worthy, Lord God.
[1:01:41] Praise God.
[1:01:44] Praise God.
[1:01:46] God. Praise God.
[1:01:50] Praise God.
[1:01:53] Praise God.
[1:01:55] Praise God.
[1:01:58] Praise God.
[1:02:00] Praise God.
[1:02:03] Praise God.
[1:02:08] Amen. I'm sure we all can testify that
[1:02:12] God has brought us through so many
[1:02:13] things. Amen.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; What a word of encouragement tonight.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; What a word of encouragement.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; I mean, I feel like we all went up 20
[1:02:23] levels.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Man.
[1:02:27] Man, I'm so glad God put on his heart to
[1:02:31] come by here.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, it's I I believe it's his
[1:02:36] desire. It's God's desire that we would
[1:02:39] retain this word in our heart and put it
[1:02:41] to use.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Right. Don't let the devil discourage
[1:02:46] us, but rest in God. Trust in God. I
[1:02:50] believe that's what the word came for is
[1:02:53] to help us through our trials.
[1:02:55] And uh we just sung it. We we we've come
[1:02:58] through so many and uh we we got more
[1:03:02] that we're going to go through, right?
[1:03:06] It it don't stop. I mean, we can talk to
[1:03:08] the oldest person here.
[1:03:11] We can just ask them. Have the trials
[1:03:14] stopped yet?
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:03:17] We still have an opportunity to trust
[1:03:18] the Lord.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we really appreciate that
[1:03:22] word. Let's just sing uh I love him. If
[1:03:24] anybody wants special prayer, just come
[1:03:26] forward. Our brother will pray unite
[1:03:28] with you. Amen. While he's here. I
[1:03:34] love him.
[1:03:38] I
[1:03:40] love him
[1:03:43] because
[1:03:45] he
[1:03:47] first
[1:03:48] loved me
[1:03:53] and perfect
[1:03:57] my
[1:03:58] salvation
[1:04:06] Calories
[1:04:11] tree.
[1:04:15] I
[1:04:17] love him.
[1:04:20] I
[1:04:23] love him
[1:04:26] because
[1:04:28] he

[1:04:40] my
[1:04:42] salvation.
