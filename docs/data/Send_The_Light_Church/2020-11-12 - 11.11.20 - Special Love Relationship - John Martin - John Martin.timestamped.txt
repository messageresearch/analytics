[0:41] lord we want to thank you for your
[0:44] presence tonight lord

[1:06] thank you for that lord that you love us
[1:09] that much to come in our midst lord and

[1:14] become closer and deeper in the things
[1:17] of god we love you we praise you today
[1:20] lord
[1:21] amen amen
[1:24] how good it is to just praise the lord
[1:27] and to to have a thankful heart when you
[1:30] approach him in his courts and in his
[1:33] house amen
[1:35] amen this is not like uh going over to
[1:39] one another's house and just talking
[1:40] about god this is a place where god is
[1:44] and uh
[1:45] it's just a special reverence in his
[1:47] house amen
[1:49] i greet you in the precious name of
[1:51] jesus and i love you i love you in
[1:53] christ and
[1:55] i say it's just good to be gathered
[1:56] together we never know when the doors
[1:58] are going to be shut for one reason or
[1:59] another
[2:00] and we just want to get all we can while
[2:03] we have the opportunity
[2:05] do you believe somehow some way uh we
[2:08] won't be about to meet sometime
[2:11] and that's going to be a very sad time
[2:14] and i think this is the time that we
[2:15] just
[2:16] just press into christ with everything
[2:19] we got so we don't have any regrets when
[2:20] that happens amen turn with me if you
[2:23] would to the book of first john
[2:26] chapter four
[2:28] i want to say thank you to every one of
[2:30] you
[2:32] for the precious gifts
[2:35] that you gave
[2:36] and
[2:37] the gift of coming
[2:39] and
[2:40] being
[2:42] with me and
[2:43] celebrating
[2:45] it just means
[2:47] that's all we have is just our family
[2:49] have one another
[2:50] and i want to say
[2:52] it means so much to us
[2:54] and may god bless you
[2:57] bless you and
[2:58] reward you as only as as only he can
[3:02] amen let's just read one verse of
[3:05] scripture there first john chapter 4
[3:07] verse 19.
[3:12] we love him
[3:14] because
[3:16] he first loved us amen let's bounce in
[3:19] prayer heavenly father
[3:21] lord unworthy
[3:24] to read
[3:25] that verse of scripture
[3:28] for this is your holy word
[3:32] lord we're unworthy to read it
[3:36] but
[3:37] lord you've given us a desire to read it
[3:40] you've placed it in our heart to read it
[3:43] and
[3:44] you even said blessed are your eyes
[3:48] we're blessed to read your word and
[3:50] we're blessed to understand it and
[3:53] lord we're praying at this moment a
[3:55] revelation of this little scripture
[3:59] lord that we might
[4:01] uh go deeper
[4:03] into the love of jesus
[4:05] deeper
[4:06] deeper
[4:08] that we might be so full of your love
[4:10] that
[4:11] that's all that
[4:13] ever comes out of us is your love lord
[4:17] have a chance to express it back the way
[4:19] that you expressed it to us lord
[4:21] for we have a chance because you first
[4:24] loved us that we can
[4:26] love you that same way bless this
[4:28] service lord bless the scripture and
[4:30] things that would be said may you just
[4:33] take it to the heart of your people and
[4:36] draw each one of us closer to you lord
[4:38] we'll be ever grateful for these things
[4:40] for we ask it humbly in jesus christ's
[4:42] name amen
[4:44] god bless you may be seated
[4:46] we want to entitle this message
[4:50] your special love relationship
[4:54] and if i could just say becoming as a
[4:57] subject becoming more
[4:59] conscious
[5:00] of
[5:02] how great god's love is
[5:06] and
[5:07] if you would just bear with me tonight
[5:09] might be a little bit of a different
[5:10] service but i want to
[5:13] kind of dramatize a little bit i'm not
[5:15] much of a storyteller
[5:18] but if you could just go back with me
[5:20] don't want to really add anything to the
[5:22] word or take away but just dramatize it
[5:25] a little bit
[5:27] before there was ever a star in heaven
[5:29] a galaxy in the universe
[5:32] or a light in the sky
[5:34] god was there we're going way back
[5:37] but
[5:38] he wasn't
[5:40] even god yet
[5:43] because brother brahm told us that god
[5:45] is an object of worship
[5:47] and there wasn't even a creature created
[5:49] by him yet to honor him as god
[5:54] so it was before he was god
[5:57] so at this time we might identify him as
[5:59] elohim
[6:01] which means the self-existing one
[6:04] brother branham taught us that we can
[6:07] make a god out of anything
[6:10] we could make a god
[6:12] out of uh this desk or a chair
[6:16] but it would not be self-existing
[6:21] only elohim could be the self-existing
[6:24] one
[6:26] in the message adoption part 2 brother
[6:29] branham said there was nothing else
[6:31] existed but him there was no air no
[6:34] light think about it no air no light no
[6:37] stars no world there was nothing else
[6:41] there was no atmosphere there was no
[6:43] atoms there were no molecules
[6:46] think about it there was nothing except
[6:48] the self-existing one amen
[6:52] this self-existing one called elohim he
[6:54] was almighty he was still i'm omnipotent
[6:57] i'm a present i'm i'm an omniscient
[7:02] he was
[7:03] the one that inhabited eternity
[7:08] there was no beginning there was no end
[7:10] it was just eternity
[7:12] and it's impossible to a human to
[7:15] understand
[7:16] or comprehend what that really means
[7:20] all you can do
[7:21] is believe it
[7:24] we could describe him as a described
[7:26] melchizedek hebrews chapter 7 verse 3
[7:29] says he was without father
[7:31] without mother
[7:33] without descendant having neither
[7:34] beginning of days
[7:36] nor end of life
[7:38] but made himself like unto the son of
[7:41] god
[7:42] but as far as we can reach back in our
[7:45] mind to where it all started
[7:47] he identifies himself in revelations
[7:50] chapter one verse eight he says i am
[7:53] alpha and omega the beginning and the
[7:57] end
[7:59] even though he's eternity there was no
[8:02] beginning there was no end we can't
[8:03] comprehend it as far as we can go back
[8:06] he's teaching as i am the the alpha and
[8:09] omega the beginning and the end saith
[8:11] the lord
[8:12] which was
[8:13] which is which was and which is to come
[8:16] the almighty
[8:18] now we know that god
[8:20] is invisible
[8:22] brother branham said in the message who
[8:24] is god he said
[8:26] a little white light
[8:29] like a a
[8:32] mystic light
[8:33] like a halo
[8:35] and this was the logos that went out of
[8:39] god in the beginning
[8:42] this was the son of god that came out of
[8:45] the bosom of the father
[8:48] just trying to understand it it was a
[8:50] little it was the light because see
[8:52] god's invisible right
[8:55] so this little light that came out
[8:57] that was the son of god
[9:03] john chapter 1 verse 1 says in the
[9:05] beginning was the word
[9:08] and the word
[9:10] was with god and the word was god so we
[9:13] see
[9:14] the the combination because the word
[9:16] eventually became flesh it it it
[9:20] materialized it went beyond thoughts
[9:23] words into the manifestation so many i
[9:27] don't know how many billions of years
[9:29] beyond this
[9:31] but why is this
[9:33] so important in the beginning was the
[9:35] logos the word the word was the son of
[9:38] god
[9:40] paul identifies this logos in colossians
[9:44] chapter 1 verse 15.
[9:46] he said who is
[9:48] the image of invisible god
[9:51] the firstborn of every creature and i'll
[9:53] tell you if you want to get out of this
[9:54] service what i want you to get out of it
[9:56] you got to come with me here
[9:58] you got to come with me at the beginning
[10:02] who is in the image of the invisible god
[10:04] the firstborn of every creature for by
[10:06] him
[10:07] for by this
[10:09] was uh were by him were all things
[10:11] created that are in heaven
[10:13] that are in earth visible and invisible
[10:15] whether it be thrones of minions
[10:17] principalities powers all things were
[10:18] created by him and for him so this
[10:21] little light that came out this longest
[10:24] that came out of this invisible god
[10:27] is the one that created everything
[10:30] everything in heaven was created by
[10:32] jesus christ
[10:35] jesus christ the logos went out of god
[10:38] in the beginning as far as we can go
[10:41] back the son of god came out of the
[10:43] bosom of the father brother bran said
[10:46] now we visualize jesus christ was about
[10:50] a little longer than 2 000 years ago
[10:56] now a lot of people visualize
[10:58] this is when jesus was
[11:01] born the son of god was born in the
[11:03] manger and they've got this
[11:06] thinking that
[11:09] god just put that that seed there at
[11:11] that time and that was the beginning of
[11:13] the son of god
[11:18] instead of
[11:20] the understanding that
[11:22] the only way it could be a son is it had
[11:24] to be
[11:25] lesser
[11:27] it had to come to a lesser
[11:29] place
[11:31] because god can't die you can't die you
[11:34] can't kill god
[11:36] you can't crucify god
[11:42] jesus said in saint john chapter 8 verse
[11:45] 58
[11:46] jesus said unto them verily verily i was
[11:49] saying to you before abraham was i am
[11:52] showing that he was before that time
[11:56] referring to
[11:57] who spoke to moses out of the burning
[11:59] bush
[12:00] that's what he's referring to
[12:02] first corinthians chapter 10 verse 4
[12:06] and did all drink the same
[12:08] spiritual drink for they drink of that
[12:10] spiritual rock that followed them and
[12:11] that rock was christ
[12:15] speaking that he was there
[12:19] during the time of israel
[12:21] all three all things were created by
[12:24] jesus christ and they were created for
[12:27] himself
[12:30] jesus christ created many things before
[12:33] there was even an earth
[12:37] inside of this visible invisible god
[12:40] that inhabited eternity were attributes
[12:43] and characteristics we've we've heard of
[12:45] this
[12:47] that describe the nature of who he was
[12:49] what he liked and what he didn't like
[12:52] the bible teaches us that god is is holy
[12:55] that he's righteous he's true he's just
[12:58] he's faithful
[13:00] and none of his characteristics can be
[13:03] perfectly defined in a human
[13:06] dictionary
[13:10] we all may have our our own ideas but we
[13:13] can only know the true identity through
[13:16] revelation and that's god speaking to
[13:18] your heart what he is
[13:21] now prayer
[13:23] is what puts us in contact with god
[13:26] i say if there's a time we need to pray
[13:28] we need to pray more now than we ever
[13:30] did in the past
[13:34] prayer puts us in contact where we can
[13:36] truly
[13:37] know
[13:38] his true characteristics
[13:43] in god's provided way of worship brother
[13:45] branham said the first thing he made
[13:49] was angelic beings that worshipped him
[13:52] that was the first thing
[13:54] that jesus christ created
[13:56] that beautiful
[13:58] god became an object of worship
[14:02] god created angelic beings to worship
[14:05] him to acknowledge him
[14:08] to give him honor
[14:10] to
[14:11] to to
[14:12] to give him what he was do because he
[14:15] created them
[14:18] he was great
[14:20] greatly to be praised
[14:23] so important that we understand this
[14:26] why else would god create an angel to
[14:29] protect him
[14:31] why would i need to create something to
[14:33] protect me
[14:37] he created them to worship him
[14:40] to bring him pleasure
[14:42] to honor him
[14:45] because he's worthy and it's important
[14:47] that we see this because if we don't
[14:49] give him the honor the worship the
[14:52] praise that he's worthy of
[14:54] we're out of our position of why he
[14:56] created us
[15:05] we can get an idea of his righteousness
[15:08] and his holiness when we look into the
[15:10] vision that isaiah had turn with me to
[15:12] isaiah chapter six
[15:21] in verse one in the year that king
[15:24] use uh uh uzziah
[15:28] died i saw also the lord sitting upon
[15:32] a throne high and lifted up
[15:35] and his train filled the temple
[15:38] we're just looking in
[15:41] to the heavens that god created before
[15:43] there was ever an earth
[15:45] above it stood the seraphims each one
[15:48] had six wings
[15:50] with two they covered their faces
[15:52] because they were unworthy to look at
[15:54] their creator
[15:56] and with two they covered their feet
[16:00] because
[16:02] i used to know why
[16:09] it was some sort of reverence
[16:12] and
[16:15] wit two
[16:16] they did fly
[16:18] and one cried unto another and said holy
[16:22] holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the
[16:25] whole earth is full of his glory now
[16:27] imagine this is all they did
[16:33] we might think in a carnal sense that's
[16:35] going to be awful boring
[16:37] i want a different job
[16:42] but it's showing
[16:45] more who god is
[16:48] that he's not just holy but he's really
[16:50] holy
[16:53] that he's that he's really to be
[16:55] reverent
[16:57] and because see satan has a way
[17:00] of
[17:01] look at laodicea right now they're stuck
[17:03] in a church where they kick god out of
[17:05] the church and having their own church
[17:06] without god
[17:08] they look at god as is someone that
[17:10] needs to be entertained
[17:13] they've taken this
[17:15] uh
[17:16] so far from who god is
[17:22] and the post of the door moved at the
[17:25] voice of him that cried
[17:27] and the whole house was filled with
[17:28] smoke
[17:30] and
[17:30] isaiah came to the realization during
[17:33] this
[17:34] time
[17:35] he said whoa is me i'm i'm don't i don't
[17:39] fit in this place i'm not
[17:42] i'm not crying holy holy i'm i'm i i
[17:45] don't fit here you ever been a place you
[17:47] don't feel like you're fit that's
[17:49] exactly where isaiah fell i don't fit in
[17:51] this place
[17:53] for i am undone because i am a man of
[17:56] unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of
[17:59] a peep of unclean lips for my eyes have
[18:02] seen the the king and the the lord of
[18:04] hosts
[18:07] then flew one of the seraphims
[18:10] unto me having a live coal in his hand
[18:13] which he had taken with the tongs from
[18:15] off the altar and he laid it upon my
[18:17] mouth and he said lo
[18:19] this have touched thy lips and thy
[18:22] iniquity is taken away and thy sin
[18:25] is
[18:26] purged boy that gives me hope
[18:30] where did that happen right in church
[18:35] right in church
[18:40] god promised to me us
[18:44] and as far as i'm concerned every day we
[18:46] backslide
[18:47] every day we've got iniquities every day
[18:50] we need to get serious about getting
[18:52] clean
[18:53] amen
[18:57] isaiah 57 15 says his name is holy
[19:02] so we're getting an idea of this
[19:06] this self-existing one he was a holy
[19:10] self-existing one
[19:12] amen he didn't he didn't become that he
[19:14] didn't say well this is what i want to
[19:16] do when i grow up he is that
[19:20] so this is his nature god created a
[19:22] whole host of
[19:25] angelic beings to worship him
[19:28] you know god really loves to be
[19:30] worshipped
[19:31] he created a lot of angels
[19:33] did you know every angel that he created
[19:35] worshiped him
[19:42] satan took
[19:45] a third of them
[19:46] they stopped worshiping
[19:55] they left the first estate the bible
[19:56] says but the bible says his train filled
[19:59] the temple
[20:00] it was all about god it was all about
[20:03] how great he was that's why he he
[20:05] created all these angels and we really
[20:07] don't know how many he created but there
[20:09] was a lot of them
[20:12] there were a lot of them
[20:15] and they were all worshiping god
[20:18] he created them to so they would worship
[20:21] him serve him and
[20:23] talk of his greatness
[20:26] why are we so caught up in our world
[20:29] why do we lose track
[20:32] of the god that created us
[20:38] there are different scriptures in the
[20:40] bible
[20:41] that we can identify jesus christ in
[20:44] fact brother brennan makes the statement
[20:45] he says if you can't see jesus christ in
[20:48] every scripture of the bible then go
[20:50] back and read it because he is the word
[20:52] he's the whole word
[20:54] you may not
[20:56] find him born in a manger in every
[20:58] scripture
[20:59] but he's in every scripture because he
[21:01] is the word from he was the word in the
[21:03] beginning that came out
[21:06] the bosom of the father
[21:09] god showed moses a pattern in heaven
[21:13] to make the tabernacle in the wilderness
[21:15] from we could read that nexus chapter 25
[21:18] if we had time but we don't have time
[21:22] but he made the
[21:23] what he was to make the pattern
[21:26] uh exactly what was in heaven
[21:30] so god
[21:32] created all those things in heaven
[21:35] and they served a purpose and he
[21:38] received glory
[21:40] the whole
[21:41] earth was full of history at that time
[21:44] of heaven was full of that glory
[21:50] and when time shall be no more
[21:52] we're going to go back
[21:54] to a temple
[21:57] the same revelations chapter 21 verse 22
[22:00] follow with me revelations 21 verse 22
[22:03] and i saw
[22:05] no temple therein for the lord god
[22:08] almighty and the lamb are the temple of
[22:12] it
[22:13] so who's the temple god becomes the
[22:15] temple
[22:16] the lamb amen jesus christ and the city
[22:20] had no need of the sun neither the moon
[22:22] to shine to it for the glory of god did
[22:25] lighten it and the lamb is the light
[22:27] thereof
[22:29] and the nations of them which are saved
[22:31] shall walk in the light of it and the
[22:33] kings of the earth to bring their glory
[22:35] and honor to it so notice god is still
[22:39] looking for glory for praise for honor
[22:42] he's looking to receive praise just like
[22:46] he did at the beginning when the first
[22:48] thing he made
[22:49] was angels
[22:51] to praise him
[22:53] it's the last thing
[22:54] and everything he wants the leaves to
[22:56] clap their hand and praise him
[22:58] if these don't uh worship
[23:01] the very rocks will cry out god is a god
[23:03] that he wants to be worshiped more than
[23:06] we want to give him
[23:12] and the devil has a way to get his soul
[23:15] distracted
[23:18] with this
[23:20] natural life that we forget our
[23:22] spiritual life
[23:25] because to worship him is a
[23:27] responsibility
[23:29] it should be an honor
[23:31] but at least it's a responsibility
[23:34] that's our first estate
[23:37] i'll tell you when we first got saved
[23:38] what happened thank you jesus
[23:41] [Laughter]
[23:44] and that's why i don't think jesus wants
[23:47] us to forget about calvary when we get
[23:48] on the other side amen
[23:51] so god created all these different
[23:53] angels
[23:54] all these amazing things in heaven
[23:57] all of which
[23:58] were unfolding
[24:01] really unveiling who jesus christ really
[24:04] was and displaying his true
[24:06] characteristics of the person that he
[24:08] wants
[24:11] god love to create things
[24:14] that please him
[24:17] there's a purpose
[24:19] things that brought him glory and honor
[24:21] and we sung it
[24:22] at the beginning of the service
[24:23] revelations chapter 4 verse 11 brother
[24:26] ron started singing this i said lord
[24:28] thank you you do this just so often you
[24:31] don't have to do this lord but i i just
[24:33] know it's you
[24:34] [Music]
[24:36] thou art worthy o lord
[24:39] to receive glory and honor and power for
[24:44] thou has created all things and for thy
[24:47] pleasure they are and were created
[24:53] shown as clear-cut you know this is the
[24:56] purpose that we are created
[25:00] ezekiel chapter 28 verse 13
[25:04] god
[25:06] created some other things
[25:09] says thou has been in eden the garden of
[25:11] god every precious stone was thy
[25:14] covering
[25:15] the sardis topaz the diamond the barrel
[25:18] the onyx this jazz fire uh jasper
[25:21] sapphire ambro kind of put those two
[25:23] together and the carbuncle and the gold
[25:25] the workmanship of thy tablets and of
[25:27] thy pipes were prepared in thee in the
[25:30] day that thou was created i want you to
[25:33] realize something if you go back to
[25:35] where we were
[25:36] revelation chapter 21 god uses seven of
[25:40] these precious stones
[25:43] in the foundation
[25:45] so you know when lucifer was created
[25:48] he was created just perfect
[25:52] verse 14 thou art the anointed cherub
[25:55] that covereth
[25:57] and i have set thee so
[25:59] thou was upon the holy mountain of
[26:02] excuse me of god thou has walked up and
[26:05] down the midst of the stones of fire
[26:07] thou was perfect in thy ways from the
[26:10] day that thou was created
[26:13] until nicory was found in thee
[26:16] he was created perfect
[26:20] god is such a good god
[26:24] god creates a perfect cherub in heaven
[26:28] to please him to bring him honor to
[26:30] bring him glory and i just want us to go
[26:32] there before we look at him as being the
[26:35] devil for a second god gives us perfect
[26:39] cherub the responsibility to lead others
[26:43] to proper worship and praise is that the
[26:45] truth
[26:47] it was a perfect atmosphere in heaven
[26:50] when lucifer would get up there and he
[26:52] would lead the worship
[26:55] this cherub he looked perfect he did
[26:58] perfect he brought more of a perfect
[27:00] praise to god because that's the reason
[27:02] god created him
[27:05] and god was pleased and he enjoyed the
[27:07] atmosphere that was created by him
[27:11] because he made him for that purpose he
[27:13] was perfect in thy ways not just one
[27:22] but through a space of time
[27:26] he took lightly this awesome
[27:28] responsibility
[27:31] and turns it into an opportunity
[27:34] to get a little bit
[27:36] of the praise and recognition for
[27:38] himself
[27:43] a little honor for himself
[27:47] what was once created to bring god glory
[27:51] was now bringing
[27:52] now beginning to take glory away from
[27:54] god
[27:57] to place it upon himself
[28:00] the clay
[28:01] was saying to the potter
[28:03] i don't want to be what you created me
[28:06] to be
[28:08] this is when iniquity was beginning to
[28:11] be formed in this great beautiful
[28:14] cherub that god had created
[28:18] and as soon as you stop bringing god
[28:20] glory
[28:21] in honor with the life he has placed in
[28:24] your hands iniquity will begin to take
[28:27] over in your life
[28:29] that's how important it is to praise god
[28:32] to worship god and to give him what he's
[28:35] worthy of
[28:36] the closer we get to god the more we
[28:38] should be praised and the more we should
[28:40] be in his image
[28:42] more in his likeness
[28:48] we were created to bring pleasure to god
[28:51] to bring glory and honor to his name
[28:55] we can bring pleasure to god
[28:58] amen
[29:00] think out of your box
[29:05] the bible says in genesis chapter 1
[29:07] verse 1 we could all probably quote this
[29:09] in the beginning god created the heaven
[29:12] and the earth
[29:15] and the earth
[29:17] was without form and void and darkness
[29:20] was upon the face of the deep and the
[29:22] spirit of god moved upon the face
[29:24] of the waters now notice
[29:27] god originally
[29:28] creates earth without form
[29:32] and without void
[29:34] why didn't he just create it all perfect
[29:36] to begin with all in one day why'd he
[29:39] wait seven days why didn't he just go
[29:40] boom
[29:43] this is important because we're learning
[29:45] about the nature of god the character of
[29:48] god the person of god if i could say it
[29:50] like that
[29:53] he wanted to enjoy what he was doing
[29:56] he wanted to take his time and enjoy it
[30:01] ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 11 says he
[30:03] have made everything beautiful
[30:06] in his time
[30:09] also he have set the world in their
[30:12] heart so that no man can find out the
[30:14] work of god
[30:16] uh
[30:17] uh find out the work that god maketh
[30:20] from the beginning to the end
[30:24] god
[30:24] enjoys taking his time
[30:27] for there is a season for everything he
[30:30] does under the heaven the bible says
[30:35] god wants us
[30:38] to be patient with the work that he's
[30:40] doing in us
[30:44] god wanted to take his his time and
[30:46] enjoy the fruits of his labor he wanted
[30:49] to enjoy
[30:50] the glory and the honor that it brought
[30:52] to him because when he when he created
[30:56] the first day when he he created the
[30:59] angels in heaven looked and marveled at
[31:02] what god had made
[31:04] amen
[31:06] each day of god's creation when he got
[31:09] done with it he sat back and he looked
[31:13] and he said it is good he enjoyed it and
[31:18] he spent a thousand years enjoying that
[31:24] it's wonderful
[31:26] i mean you just speak the word it
[31:27] happens like that
[31:29] why did it take as long as it did
[31:32] because that's what god wanted
[31:34] he wanted to enjoy
[31:36] the workmanship of his hands
[31:39] he wanted to enjoy the fruits of his
[31:40] labor
[31:42] because he wanted to get praise for that
[31:44] one thing sometimes we just you know
[31:47] do so much that we don't really
[31:48] recognize and take the time that we
[31:51] should with each thing
[31:54] begin to take for granted
[31:58] perhaps every thousand years god would
[32:01] create something and all the angelic
[32:03] beings would be
[32:04] they would marvel and be amazed at what
[32:06] god would would do and just praise him
[32:09] and praise him and i could just see the
[32:11] angels in heaven shouting hallelujah
[32:13] praise our god he's a great god look
[32:16] what he's created
[32:18] he didn't sit down here like we do in
[32:19] church and say okay yeah well i already
[32:21] knew that give me something different
[32:26] this is a real thing
[32:32] they were probably singing thou
[32:35] heart worthy
[32:38] that these things that you created were
[32:41] created for thy pleasure
[32:44] may you receive pleasure you're worthy
[32:47] of it
[32:50] he was worthy of the power
[32:53] that he had because he had power with
[32:56] character
[32:58] amen
[33:00] after all the things that god had
[33:03] created god still wanted to create a man
[33:07] in his own image
[33:10] a man that would bring him glory
[33:13] that would bring him praise and that
[33:15] would look at him as he is
[33:20] honor to please him
[33:23] that he could look down
[33:26] and and see a resemblance of himself
[33:31] brother branham and the bible teaches us
[33:33] that
[33:35] that he created man as a little god
[33:39] with the uh
[33:41] the ability to speak the word
[33:45] create an atmosphere which we all have
[33:47] the ability to do we have the ability to
[33:49] create a better atmosphere between our
[33:51] ears
[33:52] in the prayer rooms in this in this room
[33:56] right here
[33:58] because god has placed that
[34:00] that creating the atmosphere is what
[34:02] creates faith
[34:07] yeah if you you want more faith you want
[34:09] god to speak to you more create an
[34:11] atmosphere he's pleased to be in
[34:15] if everything's negative and remember
[34:17] when they were they were in the upper
[34:19] room they were in one mind and one
[34:21] accord and they weren't biting talking
[34:23] about things and they weren't worried
[34:25] about who the who the next president was
[34:27] going to be in jerusalem
[34:32] got to focus on our the life
[34:35] that we're called to
[34:37] not not the world that we're in
[34:47] god brother adam taught us that brother
[34:49] branham brother and said that god would
[34:51] come down in the cool of the evening and
[34:53] he would begin to have a fellowship and
[34:56] a communion with adam and it was just so
[34:59] wonderful
[35:01] and i just i just can't picture adam
[35:04] being disagreeable with god
[35:07] you know telling them that you know
[35:10] you need to do things a little bit
[35:12] different
[35:14] you know this new age religion right
[35:17] they got to change the bible they got to
[35:19] change the way things are
[35:21] i'm so glad that jesus christ is the
[35:23] same yesterday today and forever and
[35:26] that we can know god who he is amen we
[35:28] don't try to figure out he's the same
[35:33] he's an awesome god
[35:36] and he's worthy to be praised
[35:39] the glory of god was on display
[35:42] first in heaven and now on earth
[35:45] in everything that god had created it
[35:47] was bringing him glory
[35:49] there's so many of god's characteristics
[35:52] that were on display
[35:54] through everything that adam saw he just
[35:57] praised god for the animals that god had
[36:00] created and and the mountains and the
[36:02] seas and the and the the butterflies and
[36:06] the birds and
[36:07] all the things that creeped on the earth
[36:10] sometimes they're creepy now but
[36:14] but through every one of them
[36:17] looking at that hummingbird
[36:19] flapping his wings so fast and
[36:24] he couldn't even hardly count him
[36:28] that's how fast god made that bird to
[36:31] flap his wings
[36:34] you just sit back and you just if you
[36:36] take time
[36:38] to look at an animal
[36:41] you just god is awesome
[36:45] his glory is on display everywhere
[36:50] but people
[36:51] don't recognize god they look at it and
[36:55] they don't even think
[36:57] where that came from
[37:01] they'll go as far as darwin's theory and
[37:03] that's it
[37:05] they they don't understand how
[37:08] all the intestines are hooked together
[37:10] just right
[37:12] that that that that
[37:14] that the stomach isn't at the end and
[37:18] the the large intestine isn't connected
[37:21] to your esophagus
[37:24] they just
[37:27] how you can cut yourself and your skin
[37:30] begins to close it god just comes and he
[37:33] stitches it over time
[37:36] god is amazing
[37:39] and you know
[37:41] satan don't want them to think about
[37:42] that
[37:44] because they may get the mindset of
[37:46] starting to look at god and want to
[37:49] praise him
[37:51] that's why we need to praise god
[37:54] send the devil flying
[37:56] we need to have more praise in the
[37:57] church
[37:59] in the prayer closet in the worship and
[38:02] in the receiving of the word we need
[38:04] more praise
[38:06] because god inhabits the praises of his
[38:08] people
[38:15] verse 3 and god said let there be light
[38:18] and there was light
[38:23] and god saw
[38:24] the light that it was good
[38:26] and god divided the light from darkness
[38:30] god took time
[38:34] to enjoy everything that he did
[38:38] to sit back
[38:41] and he wanted
[38:43] others seen it all the angels are
[38:45] created
[38:46] looking at that
[38:48] and were amazed at what god had done
[38:58] when they looked at everything that was
[39:00] created in earth and in heaven
[39:02] it was like us looking up at the stars
[39:06] and seeing so many stars
[39:09] on a clear night
[39:11] some are bright
[39:12] some are faded but there's so many you
[39:14] can't count them and every one of them
[39:17] had glory
[39:19] every one of them had a story
[39:21] every one of them showed forth it wasn't
[39:24] just oh whatever
[39:26] it everywhere that
[39:28] the angels were looking that adam was
[39:30] looking it was just the glory of god was
[39:33] everywhere
[39:35] it was only god and god set back and he
[39:37] said
[39:38] everything i i created i created for
[39:41] myself to bring me pleasure in glory and
[39:45] he stood by he said it is good
[39:49] everything god created was good
[39:52] everything he did was good god is a good
[39:55] god all the time
[39:58] now you would think
[40:00] that god would be so
[40:02] pleasantly content
[40:04] with all the glory that he was receiving
[40:07] but he still had some other
[40:09] characteristics inside of him that no
[40:12] one ever
[40:13] seen
[40:16] no one knew they existed
[40:20] characteristics
[40:21] like being merciful
[40:24] never seen before
[40:26] gracious
[40:28] slow to anger
[40:31] long suffering
[40:33] being no respecter of persons
[40:36] patient and temperate and kind and
[40:38] tenderhearted
[40:42] if i could take a moment and just ask
[40:44] you this question
[40:47] is god considered a good god because
[40:50] he's just
[40:52] and true
[40:54] and righteous
[40:56] and holy
[40:58] or is god considered a good god
[41:02] because of all the benefits we get from
[41:04] his other characteristics
[41:09] how often when we think about god being
[41:11] good is when we're thinking about all
[41:13] these other characteristics that we'd
[41:15] never know about
[41:22] we don't
[41:23] think of him as a good god because he's
[41:25] a god of judgment
[41:29] because we kind of don't want
[41:31] to be judged by god
[41:35] we want to be loved by god
[41:37] we want to be forgiven by god
[41:40] we want god to be patient with us
[41:43] that's where we can testify and say god
[41:45] is good
[41:49] these other tenderhearted
[41:51] characteristics
[41:53] could not even be known in a perfect
[41:56] heavenly setting
[41:58] they could not be manifested or seen
[42:01] the beautiful way that things were
[42:04] yet
[42:05] down deep inside of god
[42:08] they existed
[42:09] they were there in the center of god's
[42:12] heart
[42:13] god still had an aching inside to
[42:15] express
[42:17] a love that was never known never seen
[42:20] or never manifested to all the angels
[42:22] that he created
[42:29] along with these other tenderhearted
[42:31] characteristics
[42:33] were certain attributes
[42:38] there as well
[42:39] also could not be manifested in such a
[42:42] setting as in a perfect heaven brother
[42:44] brandon told us
[42:46] that inside god were the attributes of a
[42:49] healer
[42:50] of a redeemer
[42:52] of a savior of a deliverer a sanctifier
[42:55] a provider and a protector
[42:58] there was just
[43:00] there just wasn't anyone in heaven that
[43:02] needed to be healed
[43:06] that needed to be delivered or or saved
[43:08] or redeemed or protected
[43:11] no one to be sanctified
[43:16] but yet this was still inside of god
[43:20] after how many
[43:21] thousands and millions and could have
[43:23] been trillions of years and it never
[43:25] came out
[43:28] god is love
[43:31] there's no dictionary that can describe
[43:34] god's love
[43:37] nor
[43:38] the love of god
[43:42] but we do know that inside of god was a
[43:45] love so strong and so powerful
[43:48] that it could bear the worst condition
[43:51] that it can endure the worst possible
[43:53] situation it was so powerful it could
[43:56] never fail and yet those angels never
[43:58] seen it
[44:02] because they always saw the best
[44:04] conditions
[44:13] well why didn't they just use it on you
[44:15] know satan when he got out of place
[44:18] because that was a two
[44:20] so he could use it
[44:22] because it wasn't just showing that love
[44:26] that god was interested in
[44:28] it was having a love relationship
[44:32] he could have showed his love
[44:36] but he wants to receive that love
[44:39] it's about a relationship that god had
[44:41] in mind
[44:44] this power was not only unknown and
[44:46] unseen by all of heaven but god never
[44:49] experienced now listen to the statement
[44:52] god had never experienced the feeling
[44:54] of releasing that love
[44:57] because there was no one to ever release
[44:59] it to
[45:04] it's a special love
[45:07] what it felt like to release from his
[45:10] heart to unlock such a power that had
[45:12] been harnessed and locked up
[45:14] it had been building up inside of god
[45:18] and god had a powerful love locked up
[45:22] inside of his heart for thousands
[45:24] perhaps millions and we don't even know
[45:27] trillions
[45:28] of years
[45:31] we just don't know how long it was
[45:37] it was just unknown
[45:40] to the angels
[45:42] indescribable
[45:44] unmanifested only god knew about it
[45:50] to think
[45:51] that for such an amazing length of time
[45:55] no one knew about this
[45:57] amazing great love of god no one knew
[46:00] just how far it would go never really
[46:03] knew the boundaries of this love
[46:06] it had never been witnessed before
[46:08] ephesians chapter 3 verse 17 that christ
[46:12] may dwell in your heart by faith now we
[46:15] we saying about this
[46:17] that you being rooted
[46:19] and grounded in love
[46:23] may be able to comprehend with all
[46:25] saints what is the breath the length the
[46:28] depth and the height and to know the
[46:30] love of christ that passive knowledge
[46:32] that he might be filled with the
[46:34] fullness of god i just want to say the
[46:36] only way that you're really going to
[46:38] know the deepness of the love of god is
[46:41] to get full of god
[46:45] because the love of god is shed abroad
[46:48] into our hearts by god
[46:52] by the holy ghost
[46:54] so the more of god you get the more of
[46:56] love
[46:57] the more you study
[46:59] about the love of god does not mean the
[47:02] more love you get
[47:05] just means the more knowledge you get
[47:08] knowledge doesn't make you be merciful
[47:12] doesn't make you go the second mile
[47:13] doesn't make you turn the cheek but i'll
[47:15] tell you god inside of you will
[47:19] amen
[47:21] there are no human dictionaries that can
[47:24] define god's love
[47:27] but first corinthians 13 teaches us that
[47:30] his love is so powerful that it never
[47:32] fails it bears all things it believes
[47:35] all things it holds all things that
[47:36] endures all things charity never faileth
[47:42] it is many of us have experienced this
[47:45] love
[47:46] knows
[47:47] that this power
[47:49] this
[47:50] power in god's love
[47:53] there's nothing like it
[47:57] because we were unlovable and he loved
[48:00] us
[48:01] because we didn't care and he cared
[48:04] because we didn't reach up to him and he
[48:06] reached down to us
[48:11] we witnessed something that no other
[48:14] angels in heaven experienced
[48:17] i wonder if if lucifer ever had a
[48:20] thought oh i just wish he would reach
[48:23] down his hand to me
[48:25] think about it
[48:27] how blessed the people we are sitting
[48:29] here today because we have experienced
[48:32] the love of god in our hearts
[48:37] we are blessed
[48:39] to know a love
[48:42] that loves those that hate him
[48:45] that loves his enemies
[48:57] just think about this being inside of
[49:00] god
[49:04] it not be too hard to understand why god
[49:07] was a lonely god
[49:12] how many times have we heard you can
[49:14] have everything you want you're still
[49:15] unhappy
[49:19] and all these things bringing them glory
[49:21] and honor yet there was just something
[49:23] missing inside of god
[49:28] to be able to express something
[49:31] so deep so real
[49:38] i'm so grateful that god did
[49:42] the only way that this powerful love
[49:44] could ever be manifested
[49:46] is god had to allow
[49:48] a fallen condition
[49:51] just for the purpose of not only being
[49:53] able to express
[49:56] an amazing love that never was before
[49:58] but listen to this but for the purpose
[50:01] of being able to feel that same amazing
[50:03] love being expressed back to him
[50:09] god saved
[50:11] the best for last
[50:14] he waited billions and trillions of
[50:17] years to have this experience with you
[50:21] he wanted an amazing love relationship
[50:25] that he never ever ever had experienced
[50:27] before just think about it never
[50:30] experienced this before and now god is
[50:32] having it with you
[50:36] amen this just
[50:39] blesses me so much
[50:42] what did he do
[50:43] he expressed his love
[50:46] first
[50:48] he lay down his life
[50:50] he gave everything he had
[50:54] at calvary
[50:56] he stuck out his neck
[50:59] first
[51:00] in this relationship
[51:03] you know a lot of times people don't
[51:04] want to commit to someone
[51:07] and some even a friendship relationship
[51:11] because they don't want to get hurt they
[51:14] don't want to get rejected they don't
[51:15] want to get turned down they don't want
[51:17] to get made fun of
[51:19] and so they're scared
[51:21] to take the first step
[51:23] in love
[51:27] but that didn't bother jesus
[51:30] he was despised he was rejected he was
[51:33] mocked made fun of lied cursed at but it
[51:37] didn't bother him because he had
[51:38] expressed this love to his bride
[51:43] he stuck his neck out first for you when
[51:47] you did not care about him
[51:50] he loved you first
[51:52] even when you were dead in your sins
[51:55] bible says we are aliens with god
[51:59] walking in the desire of our flesh and
[52:02] not even caring at all
[52:07] he stuck his neck out for us
[52:12] he wasn't worried about getting hurt
[52:18] and look how many people have turned him
[52:20] down
[52:22] but he has a little bride
[52:25] that loves him
[52:27] with that same love
[52:30] god took a chance he stuck out his neck
[52:32] not wanting
[52:34] someone or anyone to reject him the
[52:36] bible says that he with it all would
[52:39] come
[52:40] to the knowledge of this great love
[52:45] john chapter 1 verse 11 he came to his
[52:47] own
[52:48] and his own received him not but as many
[52:51] as received unto them gave he power to
[52:53] become sons of god even to them that
[52:55] believe on his name
[52:57] he gave us a chance
[53:00] to stick out our neck
[53:02] for him
[53:04] amen the same way he loved us
[53:07] unconditionally
[53:10] first john chapter 4 verse 19 are
[53:12] opening scripture we love him
[53:15] because he first loved us
[53:18] it's a special love relationship
[53:23] now you can actually see god the way
[53:25] that he sees you
[53:29] at the beginning
[53:31] we didn't even know god when we first
[53:33] came to god we thought we knew
[53:34] everything
[53:36] and the more that we serve him the more
[53:38] we realize we don't really see all of
[53:41] god saying we're looking through a glass
[53:44] darkly
[53:45] but the more
[53:47] that you that he reveals himself to you
[53:51] the more that you will live that love
[53:53] back to him
[53:56] because he loves you
[54:00] you love him because he first loved you
[54:03] are you catching what i'm saying
[54:05] he told us
[54:08] he's given us a chance to love him back
[54:11] the same way that he loved us
[54:13] now we can't
[54:15] go up to to jesus right now
[54:18] and and lay down our life for him like
[54:20] he did for us
[54:22] but he told us
[54:24] that if you actually go
[54:26] lay down your life for somebody it'll be
[54:29] the same thing as you doing it for me
[54:32] that's exactly what he said
[54:35] what you've done to the least of these
[54:38] these little ones you've done it unto me
[54:41] so we do have a chance
[54:43] to love him with the same giving the
[54:46] same love
[54:48] that same special love that he loved us
[54:50] with
[54:52] we think oh
[54:53] that's just for them
[54:56] brother man says you do something for
[54:58] somebody that can't do nothing for you
[55:00] you'll see how god blesses you
[55:02] in other words you're not trying to get
[55:04] something out of it
[55:06] that's what
[55:08] god is wanting us to develop that
[55:11] special love relationship
[55:15] when did you visit me in prison
[55:17] when did i visit you in prison when did
[55:19] i feed you i didn't see you
[55:23] we have an opportunity
[55:25] what we do to others we're really doing
[55:27] for the lord that's why it's important
[55:30] that you're nice to people
[55:32] say nice things to one another
[55:35] because it's if you're not you're it's
[55:38] like saying bad things to the lord
[55:41] no one else in heaven or in earth can be
[55:46] a part of this special
[55:48] love relationship that you have with god
[55:50] except you
[55:52] think about that nobody else that's how
[55:55] special this is
[55:57] you weren't some rock created
[56:00] some ocean created some perfect angel
[56:02] created
[56:04] no you were created
[56:06] to so that you could give back that same
[56:09] love that god gave you
[56:12] oh what an honor
[56:14] what an honor no one else can experience
[56:16] this but the bride of jesus christ
[56:20] you have been elected to this very
[56:24] special love relationship you've been
[56:26] chosen to it you have not chosen me but
[56:29] i have chosen you
[56:31] we love him because he first
[56:34] loved us
[56:37] amen john 15 13 says greater love have
[56:40] no man than this than a man lay down his
[56:43] life
[56:45] for another person's life
[56:51] he saved something that he never
[56:54] experienced with any of the angels
[56:57] he lay down his life
[56:59] for us
[57:01] god did it for you
[57:04] you know what he's doing right now he's
[57:06] waiting
[57:07] for you
[57:09] to show that same love back to him
[57:15] it's amazing why
[57:19] paul said i die daily
[57:22] he said i'm crucified with
[57:24] christ because the mo if you die every
[57:28] day what you're doing is expressing that
[57:30] love back to god every day
[57:33] it's an opportunity to love god it's not
[57:36] a law that you have to
[57:39] god so loved the world that he gave his
[57:42] life for a special love relationship
[57:44] that's what he did it for
[57:47] god rich in mercy for his great love
[57:49] wherewith he loved us
[57:51] for a special love relationship that's
[57:54] why he did it
[57:56] he's looking to get something out of
[57:59] this friends
[58:01] now there's a whole world out there that
[58:03] don't want to get the time of day it
[58:05] goes in one year out the other they look
[58:08] at jesus christ
[58:10] born in the manger died on the cross
[58:12] take their sins away and that's the end
[58:13] of it
[58:15] but to those who are developing their
[58:18] love relationship with god they're
[58:20] actually exercising laying down their
[58:23] life to show that they love god with the
[58:26] same love that he gave them we love him
[58:29] because he first loved us without him
[58:32] showing that love for us we'll never
[58:34] give it back to him think about all the
[58:35] people he died for the world and they
[58:37] won't do one thing to lay down their
[58:39] life for him
[58:43] because they don't realize that he loved
[58:46] them first
[58:51] think about it but when we get a
[58:53] revelation
[58:55] of his love
[58:56] we will love him back
[58:59] that's all there is to it
[59:03] john chapter 3
[59:05] verse 16.
[59:06] let's perceive if we got the same love
[59:08] of god
[59:10] that's what this says
[59:14] first john chapter 3 verse 16.
[59:19] because
[59:20] he laid down
[59:22] his life for us
[59:26] and we ought to lay down
[59:28] our lives
[59:30] for the brethren
[59:31] why the brethren
[59:34] jesus isn't here we'd probably
[59:36] personally go do it for him
[59:41] but he doesn't want us to do it
[59:45] personally
[59:46] to him he's not there
[59:50] he wants us to do what he did
[59:52] which is lay down his life for everybody
[59:56] our enemies
[59:58] our neighbors
[1:00:00] people hate us
[1:00:01] lay it down
[1:00:03] because when you lay it down look it
[1:00:05] wasn't easy for jesus
[1:00:08] that came out of the bosom of the father
[1:00:10] at the beginning was it easy for him
[1:00:15] he he cried he sweated he
[1:00:19] he was in pain he had headaches he was
[1:00:21] tempted and all measures like we were
[1:00:25] he didn't want to go and die out
[1:00:29] he was asking for another way
[1:00:31] it's not strange if you're looking for
[1:00:33] another message
[1:00:37] but there is no other message
[1:00:39] john said this is the same message from
[1:00:41] the beginning
[1:00:42] that we love one another
[1:00:44] this is the the very beginning message
[1:00:48] lay down your life
[1:00:51] for a special love relationship
[1:00:54] this determines
[1:00:57] where you're at
[1:01:00] this determines
[1:01:01] perceive hey let's figure out if we got
[1:01:04] the love of god that's what this is
[1:01:06] saying
[1:01:09] if you're doing the same thing he did
[1:01:11] you're giving back what he gave to you
[1:01:13] you got it
[1:01:15] it's that simple
[1:01:18] well brother john i did it last
[1:01:21] month
[1:01:22] praise god
[1:01:25] praise god
[1:01:26] but you have a chance to do it every day
[1:01:29] to die out every day
[1:01:31] that you can lay down your life for him
[1:01:33] this is this is all about your love
[1:01:36] relationship with god that's what this
[1:01:37] message is about
[1:01:42] it's something that we need to be
[1:01:43] interested in amen
[1:01:44] psalms 91 we've got a couple more
[1:01:46] scriptures and then we're going to stop
[1:01:48] psalms 91 verse number one
[1:01:52] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[1:01:54] the most high shall abide under the
[1:01:58] shadow
[1:01:59] of the almighty so we're talking about a
[1:02:01] secret relationship with god amen
[1:02:04] you're getting in a place where most
[1:02:06] people are not
[1:02:07] you're dwelling with god where most
[1:02:10] people are not
[1:02:11] verse 9
[1:02:13] because thou because you have made the
[1:02:17] lord
[1:02:18] which is
[1:02:19] your refuge even the most high
[1:02:23] thy habitation
[1:02:25] in other words i have decided that i am
[1:02:28] going to dwell in this relationship with
[1:02:30] god
[1:02:33] verse 14 because
[1:02:36] he have set
[1:02:37] his love upon me
[1:02:41] god is
[1:02:42] interested in the motive
[1:02:45] of you setting your love upon him
[1:02:47] because he set his love upon you
[1:02:51] this was no christmas gift
[1:02:55] you know
[1:02:56] what was the other day
[1:02:58] y'all came over
[1:03:00] and you gave gifts
[1:03:02] tell me one of you that expected me to
[1:03:04] give you a gift in return
[1:03:06] not a one
[1:03:08] not a one
[1:03:09] and we think god's gift is free and you
[1:03:11] can't earn it
[1:03:15] so he's not expecting any gift
[1:03:18] he's expecting your life
[1:03:21] the gift of your life back to him
[1:03:25] he's worthy that's why we went through
[1:03:27] this whole message at the beginning of
[1:03:28] showing all these things he made he
[1:03:30] created for his glory he wants to
[1:03:31] receive praise and worship to everything
[1:03:34] he does we're no different
[1:03:36] in fact we're more special than them
[1:03:39] anything else he's ever created we're
[1:03:41] more special
[1:03:45] we've been redeemed
[1:03:48] no one's ever experienced that
[1:03:52] just the reading
[1:03:55] so we should be giving him more praise
[1:03:58] we know that when we get to heaven and
[1:04:00] we're praising them they won't be able
[1:04:01] to sing that song
[1:04:05] you know
[1:04:06] there may be some rocks crying out there
[1:04:08] may be some leaves clapping there may be
[1:04:10] some waves hitting the shore
[1:04:12] there may be some birds chirping
[1:04:15] there may be some angels saying glory
[1:04:18] and honor and holy and worthy but there
[1:04:20] will be nobody singing
[1:04:22] i've been redeemed but the redeemed
[1:04:27] to feel that special love
[1:04:30] that nobody else felt you're gonna feel
[1:04:32] so special in heaven you're gonna be
[1:04:34] standing there you're the chosen for you
[1:04:39] recognizing it now this is what's
[1:04:41] important
[1:04:43] romans chapter 8
[1:04:45] closing with this
[1:04:48] special love
[1:04:50] verse 35 who
[1:04:52] shall separate us
[1:04:53] from the love of christ
[1:04:56] show tribulation distress
[1:04:58] persecution famine nakedness
[1:05:02] perils sword
[1:05:04] presidents colvin
[1:05:11] don't let anything get you down
[1:05:14] nothing stay in love with jesus
[1:05:18] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:05:20] killed all the day long why
[1:05:23] why
[1:05:24] it gives a chance for you to love god
[1:05:26] properly
[1:05:29] we are counted as sheep for the
[1:05:31] slaughter
[1:05:33] nay in all these things
[1:05:35] we are more than conquerors
[1:05:38] through him that loved us
[1:05:41] my
[1:05:42] i think some of david's greatest times
[1:05:45] that he had with the lord is when he was
[1:05:47] down
[1:05:49] when he had when he had fallen when he
[1:05:52] had made mistakes when he had everything
[1:05:54] come against him he was as low as he
[1:05:56] could get but i tell you he was as close
[1:05:58] to god at that time as any time
[1:06:01] because he come to to revive those that
[1:06:04] are down those that are broken-hearted
[1:06:07] those that are that feel like god i need
[1:06:10] you the most
[1:06:12] gives a chance for god to feel that love
[1:06:15] that you have for him because i tell you
[1:06:16] when you the bills are paid you got a
[1:06:18] money and you got this and you got that
[1:06:20] and you've got friends and everybody's
[1:06:22] liking you
[1:06:24] chances of you
[1:06:25] humbling yourself the way you should to
[1:06:27] god are much harder that's why the bible
[1:06:30] says the rich the very the hardly very
[1:06:33] many noble
[1:06:35] rich people make it
[1:06:39] because something is standing in a way
[1:06:42] of a love relationship
[1:06:49] for i am persuaded
[1:06:51] that neither death
[1:06:53] nor life nor angels amen principalities
[1:06:58] or powers or things present or things to
[1:07:00] come nor high nor death nor any other
[1:07:03] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:07:07] from the love of god
[1:07:10] which is in christ jesus
[1:07:12] i hope you feel that way today let's
[1:07:14] stand together
[1:07:19] i love him
[1:07:21] because he first loved me
[1:07:28] remember they naaman
[1:07:30] his servant said now if he would have
[1:07:32] asked you to do some great thing once
[1:07:33] you have done it
[1:07:36] just go do what he told you to do
[1:07:40] when we lay down our life
[1:07:44] we're showing god how much we love him
[1:07:49] amen i love him because he first loved
[1:07:52] me
[1:07:53] oh
[1:07:56] love him
[1:08:01] i
[1:08:03] love him
[1:08:07] because he first
[1:08:11] love me
[1:08:12] [Music]

[1:08:20] my
