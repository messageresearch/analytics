[17:13] amen we just have a a couple of
[17:15] announcements amen
[17:18] um let's just remember our brother
[17:20] Andrew Grover uh Saturday this Saturday
[17:23] uh the 11th at 5 PM amen
[17:28] um let's just bring a guest
[17:31] to make it a point to call some people
[17:33] to
[17:34] Reach Out time's running out
[17:38] and uh
[17:40] as our brother said in the men's meeting
[17:44] you know we didn't want to be
[17:45] fallen short short coming
[17:48] the Lord comes
[17:50] we might
[17:52] it might be that message that they need
[17:54] to hear
[17:55] so let's just bring and also Sunday uh
[17:58] the 12th also uh we have a special
[18:02] communion Services coming up on the 19th
[18:05] uh that's a Sunday
[18:08] so let's just be in prayer for that
[18:11] um
[18:11] just to partake of the Lord's supper and
[18:15] uh
[18:15] uh
[18:17] no I think it's a time to consecrate our
[18:19] hearts too
[18:20] you know because every time you
[18:23] consecrate your heart you've drawn
[18:25] closer to Christ
[18:28] so let's just keep that in our prayers
[18:31] oh oh so if you could just remember our
[18:35] our daughter Katie
[18:37] um in in your prayers she got kidney
[18:40] stones
[18:41] and um
[18:43] I've been anybody's had kidney stones
[18:45] they know what
[18:46] it's fun so she still hasn't passed them
[18:49] yet so they're just evaluating her at
[18:52] this point so we just pray that God
[18:55] would just dissolve them and
[18:57] she'd be on her way to a recovery
[19:00] and also for my grandson Evan he had two
[19:05] seizures pretty severe seizures in the
[19:08] last couple days and uh just pray for
[19:11] wisdom for the doctors
[19:13] and uh I'm just from the Lord for that
[19:15] um
[19:17] they really don't know why yet
[19:19] but he kind of suffers from anxiety and
[19:23] uh he said that
[19:25] he's had these little anxiety attacks
[19:28] it was it might be actually a small
[19:31] little many many
[19:32] seizure that he was having that led up
[19:35] to the bigger ones that he's had now so
[19:39] um
[19:40] you know this world
[19:42] has got so many things
[19:44] that wants to put its weight on you
[19:49] got to give it to Christ
[19:51] because if you don't
[19:54] carrying it around
[19:56] and I know but you but my shoulders
[19:59] ain't big enough
[20:01] so we know that we have but a short time
[20:05] and um
[20:07] it's just the hearts the hearts meant
[20:09] will be failing for fear
[20:12] we're here
[20:14] see it all around us
[20:17] so we just pray for peace for that
[20:20] um
[20:23] please remember my grandfather
[20:27] CJ oh this is a Gabrielle CJ he has
[20:33] he had
[20:35] a fell a few weeks ago getting out of
[20:38] the
[20:40] two of his uh still suffering

[20:46] oh out of the tub
[20:50] e sorry I can't read this still
[20:51] suffering from the effects of uh
[20:54] bad concussion pray for a complete
[20:57] healing and a restoration of his his
[20:59] mind too
[21:00] I know that as we get older
[21:06] that's the own money my way I felt twice
[21:08] since I've been back home

[21:15] take care of our bodies better as we get
[21:17] older you know be we're the weight wants

[21:52] receive
[21:54] uh as a sign says prevailing revelation

[22:06] time that we're living to put our focus

[34:45] you're the only one Lord who could bring
[34:48] this word to life you're the only one
[34:50] who can Quicken it to our hearts
[34:52] Lord we pray that you would just come
[34:54] down and send your Holy Spirit Lord
[34:57] and to speak to us Lord like only you
[34:59] can Lord touch us like only you can
[35:02] Lord may your word Lord just give us
[35:04] prevailing Revelation that will change
[35:07] Us From the Inside Out Lord
[35:08] I pray you'll bless each believer here
[35:11] Lord let them this here directly from
[35:13] you let them be able to testify they
[35:15] heard a personal revelation from you and
[35:18] Lord I pray you take control Lord this
[35:20] service Lord move your unworthy servant
[35:23] Plum out the way that you could have the
[35:24] preeminence Lord and Lord once again we
[35:27] give you the the glory and the honor in
[35:30] Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen you
[35:33] may be seated
[35:35] um so this little uh
[35:37] the title of this sermon is a man after
[35:39] God's Own Heart
[35:41] so something that we all can strive for
[35:44] uh every day and you don't have to be
[35:47] David to be a man that for God's Own
[35:49] Heart you just have to have a Hungry
[35:51] Heart to receive from the Lord
[35:53] and so we want to just uh we had a
[35:55] couple we got a quite a few uh
[35:57] scriptures in the Book of Psalms so
[35:59] let's go to Psalms chapter one
[36:05] and I just believe we're living in a day
[36:06] and age where
[36:09] we can't fall in love with God too much
[36:13] because we need to fall so deeply and
[36:15] madly in love with God that these things
[36:18] that are happening in the world won't
[36:19] affect us they won't move us but we'll
[36:21] be staying firm because all these things
[36:22] that are happening is just showing us
[36:24] how we're going home soon
[36:26] so this worked that much more harder
[36:28] while there's light and let's every time
[36:31] the church is open like our precious
[36:33] practice said let's enter in with
[36:35] Thanksgiving in our hearts let's come
[36:37] with an expectation to receive from the
[36:39] Living God who wants to change you and
[36:41] use you out there in that dark world to
[36:44] shed light amen let's go to Psalms one
[36:48] and uh very familiar scripture but we're
[36:50] going to take our time tonight don't
[36:52] worry you won't be here two hours but
[36:54] it's gonna take our time tonight and
[36:55] just let the Lord just speak to us
[36:58] so it says in verse one
[37:00] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[37:04] the counsel of the ungodly amen nor
[37:08] standeth in the way of Sinners nor
[37:11] sitteth in the seat of the scornful but
[37:13] notice what verse 2 says but his Delight
[37:17] amen is in the law of the Lord and his
[37:22] law that he meditate day and night so we
[37:26] got to be feeding upon the word studying
[37:29] in the word meditating upon the word so
[37:31] for doing that the word condensed
[37:33] dwelling you richly see God wants to
[37:35] write it upon your hearts upon your
[37:38] minds
[37:39] and it's so important for us to be
[37:40] feeding on that word because if you're
[37:42] feeding on the word then God has
[37:44] opportunity to Quicken it in your heart
[37:47] go to verse 3 and he shall be like a
[37:50] tree planted by the rivers of water so
[37:53] God is liking us to trees
[37:56] and when you're a train order a tree to
[37:59] be fully established the roots have to
[38:01] grow deeper and deeper and deeper and
[38:04] God wants our roots to grow so deep that
[38:06] when a strong wind comes it won't Shake
[38:09] us it won't tip us over but it'll just
[38:12] loosen Our Roots enough so they can grow
[38:14] deeper
[38:15] and if you notice the rest of this it
[38:17] says and he shall be like a tree planted
[38:20] by the rivers of water now notice the
[38:24] rivers are plural but the water is one
[38:27] so the rivers lead to One Life Source
[38:31] One water source and that is Jesus
[38:33] Christ
[38:34] amen
[38:36] fourth it says that bringeth forth his
[38:38] fruit in his season his Leaf also shall
[38:41] not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[38:44] prosper verse 4 the ungodly are not so
[38:47] but are like the chaff which the wind
[38:50] driveth away
[38:51] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[38:54] the Judgment nor the sinners in the
[38:56] congregation of the righteous for the
[38:59] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[39:00] but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[39:03] so if you notice in verse 3
[39:05] says his fruit it says uh so bringeth
[39:08] forth his fruit in his season
[39:10] so
[39:12] Jesus said we are we're connected to the
[39:15] vine or the branches and so God expects
[39:18] our tree
[39:19] to bear fruit
[39:21] and if a tree is truly planted by the
[39:24] rivers of water and it's root surges
[39:26] deeply grounded then that tree is going
[39:29] to eventually have to bear fruit so God
[39:31] expects to see fruit in our life and
[39:34] we're connected to that one water source
[39:37] then there has to be fruit in our life
[39:39] but if there's not fruit in our life
[39:41] then we need to do a checkup inventory
[39:44] search me o God and see if there's
[39:46] something hindering us from producing
[39:49] that fruit because that fruit is not for
[39:51] you it's for others
[39:54] long-suffering joy peace that's right
[39:57] all the fruits of the holy spirit for
[39:58] others so they can see Christ in your
[40:01] life
[40:02] amen so let's go to let's go to Psalms 2
[40:06] which is right uh right over it so God
[40:08] wants us to be established in him
[40:10] so being established in God is so
[40:13] important because if you're not fully
[40:15] established then God can't use you in
[40:17] the magnitude that he wants to use you
[40:20] in
[40:21] so when the fiery Trials come when the
[40:24] mighty winds come we don't want to get
[40:26] uprooted in fact when they come it
[40:29] should only loosen Our Roots so they can
[40:32] go deeper that's what trials should do
[40:35] trials shouldn't come uh they shouldn't
[40:38] be a surprise to us because the
[40:40] scripture tells us our fiery trial is
[40:42] more precious than gold
[40:44] and the reason why we have trials is so
[40:47] more of Christ can dwell in US richly
[40:49] amen so go to Psalms 2 and read verses
[40:53] 11 through 12.
[40:55] serve the Lord with fear
[40:57] and rejoice with trembling kiss the sun
[41:01] lest he be angry and ye perish from the
[41:04] way when his wrath is kindled
[41:07] but a little blessed are all they that
[41:10] put their trust in him
[41:13] so the type of fear isn't like a the
[41:16] type of fear
[41:18] as the devil says or the cowering but
[41:20] the type of fear I'm talking about the
[41:22] scripture is talking about is a
[41:23] reverence towards God that you don't
[41:25] want to do something to offend him or
[41:27] hurt him that you have so much love in
[41:29] your heart that you want to just
[41:31] everything you do your thoughts your
[41:33] actions you want to make sure that
[41:34] they're pleasing unto him that's the
[41:36] type of fear that the scripture is
[41:38] talking about
[41:39] and we go to Psalms 1 11 10.
[41:43] so I just see David just looking at his
[41:46] life in the Book of Psalms and all
[41:49] throughout the Old Testament he was
[41:50] always
[41:52] a man that wanted to please God amen and
[41:56] he was just so open and so honest you
[41:59] know when how he's feeling and he was
[42:00] that's what God is looking for for us to
[42:02] be open and honest not try to put a put
[42:05] on but David is always honest did he
[42:07] mess up yes he messed up but he was
[42:09] honest about that mess up and he
[42:11] repented and it didn't go back to that
[42:14] same thing he did that's what God is
[42:16] looking for
[42:17] let's go to Psalms 1 11 10.
[42:23] so it says
[42:27] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[42:31] wisdom so if you desire wisdom from God
[42:35] we need to be fearing God respecting God
[42:38] asking for God for this wisdom
[42:42] a good understanding have all they that
[42:44] do no his what Commandments if you love
[42:48] me keep my commandments so we heard in
[42:51] the Bible study today
[42:53] so if we want we want all these things
[42:55] from God but yet we're not doing the
[42:58] things he's asking us to do so if you
[43:00] want something from God you got to be
[43:01] obedient to God yes God will bless the
[43:03] just in the unjust but I don't want just
[43:05] some physical blessing I want a blessing
[43:08] that will just change my nature that
[43:10] will touch my soul
[43:13] so read that one more time the fear of
[43:15] the Lord is the beginning no it's the
[43:17] beginning of wisdom so we got to keep
[43:19] fearing them keep fearing them keep
[43:21] respecting them
[43:22] a good understanding of all they that do
[43:25] his Commandments his praise endureth
[43:27] forever
[43:29] and we'll go to Psalms 112 which is
[43:31] right next door
[43:33] verse 1 and then six through eight
[43:35] praise ye the Lord blessed is the man
[43:38] that feareth the Lord
[43:40] if you ever read the book of Psalms in
[43:42] Proverbs you'll notice that that word
[43:44] fear is used a lot which meaning it's an
[43:47] it's important to God it's something
[43:49] that is a not something you can take or
[43:52] leave but is a must just like coming
[43:54] into God's house he demands respect and
[43:56] reverence how we conduct ourselves in
[43:59] the house how we when you come with
[44:01] expectation in the house of God all that
[44:04] is going into the fear of the Lord so he
[44:08] says blessed is the man so you're going
[44:10] to be blessed if you fear the lord that
[44:13] feareth the Lord that delighteth knows
[44:15] right here greatly in his Commandments
[44:17] notice how important his Commandments
[44:19] are to him to fear Him and to follow his
[44:22] Commandments are so important to him
[44:25] go to verse 6.
[44:27] surely he shall not be moved forever
[44:30] the righteous shall be an everlasting
[44:32] remembrance verse 7.
[44:35] he shall not be afraid of evil Tidings
[44:37] his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord
[44:41] so our hearts
[44:43] like that's why I can see David was a
[44:45] man after God's Own Heart because his
[44:47] heart was fixed in trusting in the Lord
[44:49] no matter what situation he was going in
[44:52] no matter if the Philistines were coming
[44:54] or whoever was trying to Compass him his
[44:57] heart was constantly fixed upon the Lord
[44:59] and we need to have the same type of
[45:02] attitude same type of trust as David has
[45:05] in the Lord David was no different than
[45:08] you and I he was a human being per se in
[45:10] that sense he didn't have some
[45:11] superpowers he couldn't fly but he had
[45:14] liked passions he made mistakes he had
[45:17] issues just like us so we can be a man
[45:20] after God's Own heart as well in fact in
[45:22] this layout is he an age we need to be
[45:25] after God's Own Heart because the cares
[45:28] of this life is trying to take our eyes
[45:30] off of God
[45:31] the government the policies all these
[45:34] things are trying to take us off of
[45:36] God's eyes and we need to be constantly
[45:38] after God's Own Heart
[45:41] so he says his heart is fixed I looked
[45:43] that word up the word fixed means
[45:45] settled
[45:47] established firm
[45:49] fast and stable so when you when
[45:53] somebody truly fixes something
[45:56] you expect it to be firm established and
[45:59] to stay there so our heart needs to be
[46:01] constantly fixed on God
[46:03] 24 hours a day no breaks
[46:08] so let's go to verse um eight notice
[46:10] what it says right here another verse 8
[46:12] says his heart is established
[46:15] he shall not be afraid until he see his
[46:19] desires upon his enemies so our heart
[46:22] needs to be established
[46:24] we can't just be coming to churches to
[46:25] come to church but we got to be so
[46:27] established that every time we walk on
[46:29] the door is God I need to hear a word
[46:31] from you
[46:31] I need my heart to be changed I need my
[46:34] nature to be changed because I know this
[46:36] the devil wants to sift me like wheat
[46:39] but you prayed for me Lord and I need
[46:42] you I need thee every hour
[46:45] so I heard we said before must be fixed
[46:48] on him no matter what's going on no
[46:51] matter the neighbors yelling at you if
[46:53] if your wife's not talking to you your
[46:55] husband's not talking to you you got to
[46:57] be fixed on him you can't let anything
[46:59] affect your love relationship with
[47:01] Christ because as soon as you let that
[47:03] affect your love relationship with
[47:05] Christ then that's when the enemy can
[47:07] get in
[47:08] and like brother John preached about
[47:10] influence of another Spirit that's going
[47:11] to influenced another Spirit can come on
[47:13] we let your guard down that's when Satan
[47:15] comes in
[47:16] so I got a quote is that okay if I read
[47:18] it yeah
[47:19] yeah so it's in his presence 1962 uh
[47:23] 0909
[47:24] Psalm 16 8 we're going to turn there as
[47:26] well if we want to just turn there while
[47:28] we're reading this psalm 16 8 David said
[47:31] I have sent the Lord before me notice
[47:34] that
[47:35] when you said the Lord before you that
[47:37] means he's the center of your whole life
[47:40] because you're setting them before you
[47:42] see a lot of times we put ourselves
[47:44] before the Lord I gotta do me I gotta do
[47:47] this and this and this and this then I'm
[47:48] going to put the Lord first but David
[47:50] said I have said the Lord before me
[47:52] that's a good thing to do
[47:54] Psalms 16 8 I have sent the Lord before
[47:57] me so he could not be confused about it
[48:00] amen he wanted to be conscience of his
[48:03] presence
[48:04] so David said I have set the lord always
[48:07] before my face now
[48:10] I David have said the Lord before my
[48:12] face always to be conscious conscience
[48:14] of what of God's presence
[48:17] wouldn't that be a good lesson for us
[48:19] for all of us tonight said the Lord
[48:21] before our face so we'll be conscience
[48:23] of his presence put him first why put
[48:26] him first before you why then
[48:29] you won't sin when you're realizing that
[48:33] constantly you're in the presence of God
[48:34] let me do one more time then you won't
[48:37] sin when you are realizing that
[48:39] constantly you're in the presence of God
[48:41] when you realize God is around you you
[48:43] watch what you say
[48:46] amen when he thinks that when he thinks
[48:48] God is gone he'll cuss he'll lust after
[48:50] women he'll he'll do he'll still cheat
[48:53] lie he'll do anything when he thinks
[48:55] that God don't see him it's like when
[48:57] David uh made that that mistake he
[49:01] didn't think God was watching
[49:03] but he was so we always got to be in a
[49:06] constant uh spiritual awareness that God
[49:09] is watching our life everything that we
[49:11] do God is watching us and we can't hide
[49:13] anything from him so that's why it's so
[49:15] important to be conscious spiritually
[49:17] conscious if I could say
[49:19] but bring him into the presence of God
[49:22] and he'll stop right now
[49:23] and David said I put the Lord but always
[49:25] before me that's a good thing no wonder
[49:27] why God said he was a man after his own
[49:30] heart man would do everything when he
[49:32] thinks that God isn't near remember one
[49:35] more time man would do everything when
[49:37] he think that God is not near but when
[49:40] he realizes that God's near did you ever
[49:42] notice a sinner let a Godly person walk
[49:44] up he'll quit his cussing if he's got
[49:46] any respect at all
[49:48] he won't tell dirty jokes that he would
[49:50] have told see he'll leave off that
[49:53] because he knows that he's in the
[49:55] presence of God because God dwells in
[49:58] the Tabernacle of his people see so God
[50:01] dwells in each one of us you have to
[50:03] believe that that's why it's so
[50:05] important for us to conduct ourselves in
[50:07] the right manner because
[50:10] like Paul said you're living Epistles
[50:13] somebody might never read a Bible he
[50:14] might be the only Bible they ever read
[50:17] and that's why it's so important for us
[50:19] to be constantly in Oneness with God
[50:21] because we don't want somebody to see us
[50:23] we want somebody to see Christ in US
[50:27] after David said this I think I read
[50:29] that already but let's go to Psalm 16.
[50:33] actually I'm sorry it was home 16. but
[50:35] one more this last quote after David
[50:37] said this he said my heart shall rejoice
[50:40] I wish you read it psalm 16 my heart
[50:42] will rejoice and my flesh shall Rest In
[50:45] Hope why my heart shall rejoice because
[50:48] I've got God before me all the time I
[50:51] love that my heart shall rejoice because
[50:53] I've got God before me all the time
[50:56] that's where your joy comes from your
[50:59] peace your long-suffering that's why you
[51:01] can Rejoice because it's not you that
[51:03] has the strength but it's God that has
[51:05] given you the strength to live in this
[51:08] Dark Age of laodicea and age
[51:11] all my flesh shall rest notice all my
[51:13] flesh shall Rest In Hope if I die I'll
[51:15] be raised again for heal and not suffer
[51:18] his holy one to see corruption neither
[51:21] will he leave his soul in Hell see when
[51:23] David put God before him
[51:26] and was conscious that constantly he was
[51:29] in the presence of God seek ye first the
[51:31] kingdom of God let's go to Psalm 16 and
[51:34] we'll go with verse 1.
[51:36] is to read that
[51:39] so it says in verse 1.
[51:44] preserve Me O God for in thee do I put
[51:48] my trust
[51:49] O my soul thou thou has said unto the
[51:52] Lord thou are my Lord my goodness
[51:54] extended not to thee let's go to verse
[51:57] 5.
[51:59] the Lord is the portion of my
[52:01] inheritance and of my cup thou maintain
[52:04] is my lot verse 8 verse 9 sorry verse 7.
[52:08] I Will Bless The Lord who has given me
[52:10] counsel my Reigns also instruct me in
[52:12] the night Seasons I have sent the lord
[52:15] always before me because
[52:18] he's at my right hand I shall not be
[52:21] moved so for setting the lord always
[52:22] before us we're in that trial we can't
[52:25] be moved
[52:27] because we put the Lord before us and we
[52:29] know we're in this trial free Divine
[52:31] Purpose because God is trying to
[52:34] beat more of his image into us because
[52:39] we're not going to heaven
[52:40] just because our name is Mark Cosby or
[52:43] brother John or Brother Joseph brother
[52:45] Jonathan but we're going in heaven
[52:47] because it'll be just like him and that
[52:49] just like him processes is starting in
[52:52] Trials because he's molding you he's
[52:54] shaping you he's the master Potter we're
[52:56] the clay and he's the Potter
[53:00] verse 9. therefore my heart is glad and
[53:03] my glory rejoices
[53:05] My Flesh also shall Rest In Hope for
[53:08] thou will not leave my soul in Hell
[53:10] who's thankful for that neither will
[53:12] thou suffer thy Holy One to see
[53:14] corruption
[53:15] that will show me the path of life he
[53:18] will show you the path of life
[53:20] if you're seeking after his heart if
[53:23] you're following his Commandments if
[53:25] you're trusting in Him he'll show you
[53:27] the path of life he said our plans to
[53:28] prosper and give you an expected end for
[53:30] a reason he didn't say that because it
[53:32] just sounded good but he said it because
[53:34] he meant that
[53:37] in thy presence is fullness knows that
[53:39] in his presence is what fullness of joy
[53:42] yeah at thy right hand there are
[53:45] Pleasures ever more amen
[53:48] so look the word up Delight
[53:50] uh
[53:51] so Delight is a high degree of pleasure
[53:54] or satisfaction of mind and joy
[53:57] to affect with great pleasure to please
[53:59] highly to give or afford High
[54:02] satisfaction or joy as a beautiful
[54:04] landscapes the lights so like David said
[54:07] we got a delight in the law of the Lord
[54:11] it's awesome to finish definition I
[54:13] Harmony Delights in The Ear The Good
[54:15] Conduct of children especially their
[54:18] Petty Delights their parents
[54:20] so our hearts must be fixed on the Lord
[54:22] at all times we can't afford to get
[54:24] distracted amen we're too late in this
[54:27] race to get distracted we're too late
[54:29] not to finish this race
[54:31] just because we started off strong in
[54:33] the beginning
[54:34] we still have to finish the end
[54:37] so like I said before Satan is throwing
[54:40] everything he has all his Arsenal
[54:41] everything up his sleeve he's trying to
[54:43] throw everything he he has because his
[54:45] knows his time is short
[54:47] and if he can get us just distracted one
[54:49] one percent
[54:51] he has you
[54:53] see God isn't looking for 99 but he's
[54:55] looking for 100 of your life
[54:57] this is not a math test where you get
[55:00] past the 99 but God is looking for a
[55:02] hundred percent
[55:03] and we owe God everything that we have
[55:05] inside of us to give it to him
[55:07] and I promise if you give everything you
[55:09] have to God he's going to bless you
[55:11] abundantly
[55:14] let's go to Romans 13 11.
[55:20] and that knowing the time that now it is
[55:23] at high time to wake out of sleep notice
[55:25] what Paul says right here
[55:27] for now is our Salvation nearer then
[55:31] when we believe one more time and that
[55:33] knowing the time that now it is high
[55:37] time to wake out of sleep if you're
[55:39] sleeping wake up
[55:41] it's no time to sleep
[55:42] it's no time to let you flow off the gas
[55:45] we got to keep straight forward Don't
[55:47] Look Behind look straight forward God's
[55:50] always moving forward God doesn't move
[55:51] behind he moves forward he says for now
[55:54] is our Salvation nearer then when we
[55:57] believe we're coming closer to the
[56:00] rapture
[56:01] and they're still the Rapture hasn't
[56:03] happened they're still Souls that's why
[56:04] it hasn't happened
[56:06] maybe there's somebody in your life that
[56:08] only you can reach
[56:10] and we need to be sober Vigilant we need
[56:13] to be diligent we need to be disciplined
[56:16] because a disciple the word disciple has
[56:19] discipline in there so we got to
[56:20] discipline ourselves daily
[56:24] amen amen let's go to Romans 8.
[56:30] don't worry it's not 8 28.
[56:32] Miss
[56:39] so in Romans it's the um
[56:42] let me get there myself
[56:44] so Romans 8 and we'll go towards the end
[56:47] of Romans 8 actually
[56:49] so it says in Romans 8.
[56:52] verse 35. so who shall separate us from
[56:55] the love of Christ so he's asking us the
[56:57] question
[56:59] what's going to separate you from Love
[57:00] Of Christ
[57:02] and it says shall tribulation
[57:04] or distress or persecution
[57:07] or famine or nakedness or Prevail or
[57:09] sword
[57:10] so is are you gonna let that separate
[57:12] you from the love of Christ
[57:15] anybody
[57:17] amen no
[57:18] amen
[57:20] as it is written for thy sake we are
[57:23] killed all the day long we are counted
[57:26] as sheep for the slaughter nay in all
[57:29] these things we are more than conquerors
[57:32] through him that loved us
[57:35] verse 38 Fran persuaded so Paul's saying
[57:38] right here that neither death
[57:40] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[57:44] nor powers it's more nor things present
[57:47] or nor things to come so whatever the
[57:49] devil is going to throw at you a week
[57:52] from now two weeks from now two hours
[57:54] from now
[57:56] don't let those things separate you from
[57:58] the love of Christ don't let that
[57:59] separate you from being a man after
[58:01] God's Own Heart
[58:03] because Paul just claimed right here
[58:04] when Jesus died he died so these things
[58:07] could not separate you from him he's
[58:10] giving you the overcoming power to all
[58:13] these things so don't let anything get
[58:15] in the way of your walk with God because
[58:18] we've come too far
[58:20] we've marched too far God's given us
[58:22] eyes of Malachi 4. God's given us eyes
[58:25] of his word he's given us a Vindicated
[58:27] word that it's not just here but he's
[58:31] played he wants to place it in here
[58:33] if that word can be placed in here we
[58:36] can be where Miss Jesus Christ for a
[58:38] reason
[58:39] so
[58:41] verse 39 he said nor height
[58:44] nor depth nor any other creature
[58:49] shall be able to separate us from the
[58:51] love of God which is in what in Christ
[58:53] Jesus our lord
[58:57] let's go to Second Corinthians 4 16.
[59:11] and so the Bible says for which cause we
[59:14] faint not but though our outward men
[59:17] perisheth yet the inward man is renewed
[59:20] day by day so when that carnal man dies
[59:25] then that man inside can be renewed day
[59:28] by day Paul said I Die daily for a
[59:30] reason
[59:33] amen
[59:34] so
[59:36] what pleases God
[59:38] I'm gonna ask that question to you guys
[59:40] I made a couple answers brother John
[59:41] what please is God
[59:44] Amen brother Jonathan what place is God
[59:49] Amen brother Ron what place is God
[59:53] Amen Brother Bruce what place is God
[59:57] amen amen what touches his heart
[1:00:02] anybody what touches a guy's heart
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:09] amen we're going to find out these
[1:00:11] answers you gave them all all the right
[1:00:13] answers we're going to see them in the
[1:00:15] scriptures go to Psalms 34 18.
[1:00:19] because we want to make sure that we're
[1:00:21] pleasing God every day and we're
[1:00:22] touching his heart
[1:00:25] because the end of the day that's all
[1:00:27] that's going to matter what we did for
[1:00:29] God Amen what we did with this light
[1:00:31] that he's given us because we only got
[1:00:32] one life to live it shall soon pass was
[1:00:36] done for Christ will last
[1:00:38] so in Psalms 34
[1:00:45] and go to verse 18.
[1:00:48] the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a
[1:00:51] broken and or a broken heart and save as
[1:00:54] such be as a contrite spirit
[1:00:57] that's what the Lord is looking for us
[1:00:59] to be broken be humble we got to let go
[1:01:02] of everything that is besetting US
[1:01:05] distracting us and we've got to just
[1:01:07] look to what the author and finish of
[1:01:09] our faith that's what the scripture
[1:01:11] tells us and so it's okay if
[1:01:14] sometimes the world just sometimes it
[1:01:17] just you know just gets to us it kind of
[1:01:20] just you know feel like everything is
[1:01:21] just going wrong when you feel that type
[1:01:23] of feeling go straight into prayer
[1:01:25] because what he's your Refuge he's a
[1:01:27] strong tower
[1:01:28] and don't forget that he he is those
[1:01:31] things and we gotta always remember that
[1:01:33] he's a high priest that can be touched
[1:01:35] by what the feeling of our infirmities
[1:01:38] and he knows even here he even sees and
[1:01:41] hears when a tear hits the ground
[1:01:44] so he knows all those things
[1:01:47] let's go to Isaiah 57.
[1:01:54] we'll read verses uh this verse 15 this
[1:01:57] one verse out of here and then we'll go
[1:01:58] to James 4. oh I forgot Proverbs three
[1:02:00] fives on here too
[1:02:02] so we'll go to 15.
[1:02:06] for those saith the high and lofty one
[1:02:08] that inhabiteth eternity whose name is
[1:02:12] Holy
[1:02:13] so I dwell in the high and holy place
[1:02:16] with him also that is of a contrite and
[1:02:19] humble Spirit notice what it says to
[1:02:21] revive the spirit of the humble
[1:02:25] so humility is so important that's what
[1:02:28] pleases God is humility that's one
[1:02:30] that's one of the things that pleases
[1:02:31] God is humility
[1:02:33] because he wants to look at says and to
[1:02:34] revive the heart of the contrite ones
[1:02:37] so he wants to revive us our spirit he
[1:02:39] wants to survive our hearts
[1:02:41] and we don't have to wait until a
[1:02:43] Revival comes to be revived but we can
[1:02:45] have a Revival every day in our in our
[1:02:47] spiritual walk with God it just depends
[1:02:50] how what you're feeding on in your
[1:02:51] attitude amen
[1:02:53] amen and we're going to go to um James
[1:02:55] 4.
[1:02:57] how we're doing on time
[1:03:01] and reverses um James 4 I believe we're
[1:03:04] gonna start with verse 4. I believe
[1:03:11] yep I do uh yeah we'll do verse 4.
[1:03:15] James 4 4 and we'll go to verse
[1:03:19] um eight
[1:03:21] he adulterouses and adulteresses
[1:03:23] adulterers and adulterous sis know you
[1:03:25] not that the Friendship of the world
[1:03:28] is enmity with God whosoever therefore
[1:03:31] will be a friend of the world is the
[1:03:33] enemy of God
[1:03:35] do you think that the scriptures saith
[1:03:37] in vain that the spirit that dwelleth in
[1:03:39] us lusteth to Envy so we have another
[1:03:42] old man inside of us that loves to lust
[1:03:45] after the things of the world
[1:03:48] and we have to recognize it and realize
[1:03:50] that that we're in a battle and the
[1:03:52] battle is between you and your carnal
[1:03:54] flesh the battle's not against me and
[1:03:56] Brother Bruce or me and brother Marty
[1:03:57] but it's
[1:03:59] Mark Cosby and Mark Cosby spiritual Mark
[1:04:01] Cosby in the carnal Mark Cosby
[1:04:04] and but knows what he says right in
[1:04:06] verse in six but he giveth more grace
[1:04:09] wherefore you saith God resisted the
[1:04:12] proud but giveth Grace unto the humble
[1:04:15] so if you have everything figured out
[1:04:18] God can't show you anything but if
[1:04:20] you're a lamb was a lamb do as we heard
[1:04:22] shears all of its rights away and that's
[1:04:25] what humility is you you know you have
[1:04:27] this Liberty you can do anything you
[1:04:29] want to but you don't want to because it
[1:04:31] won't be pleasing to God
[1:04:33] so true so true Liberty is you giving
[1:04:35] your rights away see Satan wants to
[1:04:37] paint some picture where Liberty is what
[1:04:40] the world society is you could you're
[1:04:42] you can do whatever you want with your
[1:04:43] body you can do this you can whatever
[1:04:45] but that's not a type of Liberty that's
[1:04:47] his bondage this is Liberty uh clothed
[1:04:50] in bondage because that's all it is is
[1:04:52] bondage because you doing your own will
[1:04:55] is you doing the devil's will that's
[1:04:57] what your own will is that's what it's
[1:04:58] that's what carnality is
[1:05:00] and true Liberty is submitting unto your
[1:05:04] master Shepherd
[1:05:05] amen so it says
[1:05:08] submit yourself so no so notice first
[1:05:10] you have to humble yourself and then you
[1:05:13] can submit because if you're proud
[1:05:15] you're never going to submit yourself
[1:05:17] because you think you don't have to but
[1:05:19] if you're if but if you're humble then
[1:05:22] you're gonna submit yourself
[1:05:24] therefore to who to God and then you can
[1:05:27] resist the devil so a humble submit and
[1:05:31] then risk the devil wrist resist the
[1:05:33] devil and then guess what he will flee
[1:05:35] from you because you're in connection
[1:05:38] with God and when you're in connection
[1:05:41] with God Satan can do nothing
[1:05:44] he is powerless against you but if
[1:05:46] you're not in connection with God then
[1:05:48] Satan can trick you he can deceive you
[1:05:50] uh he can hurt you uh
[1:05:53] so many we can keep going down the list
[1:05:55] what he can do but when you're in the
[1:05:56] presence of God connected with God then
[1:05:59] Satan is powerless against you
[1:06:01] and it says and notice so we got humble
[1:06:06] submit then you can resist and then it
[1:06:09] says draw an eye to God and He will draw
[1:06:11] an eye to you so in order for all this
[1:06:13] to happen humility has to be the first
[1:06:16] thing you got to realize
[1:06:17] how in Need You are of God
[1:06:20] and when a humble person recognizes that
[1:06:22] he's in need of God he's going to want
[1:06:24] to draw nigh to God so it says draw nigh
[1:06:26] to God and He will draw nigh to you
[1:06:29] so you have to make that First Act you
[1:06:32] have to do your 50 as we heard on Sunday
[1:06:35] says cleanse your hands so we play a
[1:06:37] part so it's impartial cleanse your
[1:06:39] hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts
[1:06:42] you double-minded we'll keep going be
[1:06:44] afflicted and mourn and weep let your
[1:06:46] laughter be turned to mourning in your
[1:06:49] joy to heaviness verse 10 humble
[1:06:51] yourselves in the sight of the Lord and
[1:06:55] He Shall lift you up now I think a lot
[1:06:57] of times people
[1:06:59] I think lift up is like oh look at me
[1:07:02] but I believe maybe I'm wrong but I
[1:07:04] believe when he's going to lift you up
[1:07:05] he's going to lift you up in the
[1:07:06] Heavenly places with him that he can be
[1:07:08] manifested so yeah I don't want to be
[1:07:11] lifted up I want people to see me
[1:07:13] because I I have so many flaws I can
[1:07:15] give you a list of them if you want them
[1:07:17] I made so many mistakes
[1:07:19] and I want somebody just to see Christ
[1:07:22] in me
[1:07:23] because that's what I was putting this
[1:07:25] Earth for
[1:07:26] and I want a closer walk with them the
[1:07:28] more closer I can get with him that's
[1:07:30] probably not even correct English the
[1:07:31] closer I can get to God
[1:07:33] the more people can see a written bible
[1:07:37] and that should be our desire
[1:07:40] let's go to Proverbs 3 5. that was also
[1:07:44] um in the Bible study they didn't know
[1:07:46] about
[1:07:47] that's okay I love that
[1:07:50] so Proverbs 3 5. so we're just we're
[1:07:52] just trying to see what pleases God and
[1:07:54] what touches his heart
[1:07:59] and then after that we're going to
[1:08:00] finish in the Book of Psalms
[1:08:04] so Proverbs 3 and verses through five
[1:08:06] through six I believe
[1:08:08] so it says we probably heard it so many
[1:08:10] times but I think it's
[1:08:12] fitting to hear this again I think we we
[1:08:14] can't hear hear this too much because it
[1:08:16] says trust in the Lord with all thy
[1:08:20] heart notice that so you're not trusting
[1:08:22] just partially or he might do this but
[1:08:25] you're believing he's going to do this
[1:08:26] amen if I if I trust him with all my
[1:08:28] heart the scripture says he's going to
[1:08:29] help you so it says trust in the Lord
[1:08:31] with all thy heart and lean not unto
[1:08:34] their own understanding and notice in
[1:08:36] all thy ways acknowledge Him in all thy
[1:08:39] ways
[1:08:40] and he shall direct thy Pastor scripture
[1:08:42] telling us if we trust with him in all
[1:08:44] our heart in in all ways acknowledge Him
[1:08:47] then it says he's going to direct our
[1:08:50] paths but the thing is a lot of times we
[1:08:52] want the blessings of God without
[1:08:54] following the word of God I'm saying one
[1:08:57] more time we want the blessings of God
[1:08:58] sometimes without following all the word
[1:09:00] of God and we wonder why God isn't
[1:09:02] answering but we need to look back and
[1:09:04] see if we're following all the
[1:09:05] Commandments that God has commanded in
[1:09:07] his Bible for us to follow to get that
[1:09:09] blessing because if person X Y and Z got
[1:09:13] the blessing of God guess what they
[1:09:15] followed the blueprint that God gave
[1:09:17] them so if we follow that same blueprint
[1:09:19] not like robots but in the newness of
[1:09:23] life then God is obligated this is
[1:09:26] humble God is obligated because he is
[1:09:28] bound to his word it's forever forever
[1:09:31] settled in heaven for a reason and he's
[1:09:33] not a man that will lie and his voice
[1:09:36] his word would not return void so if you
[1:09:38] meet the same requirements if you're
[1:09:40] ever one the Holy Ghost tonight
[1:09:42] and you met every requirement God is
[1:09:45] obligated to fill you and seal you to
[1:09:47] the day of your Redemption
[1:09:49] if you want healing it's in the word he
[1:09:52] already died for your healing you're
[1:09:54] just claiming until the manifestation
[1:09:56] happens
[1:09:57] so if you've met everywhere if they that
[1:09:59] wait upon our Lord shall renew their
[1:10:01] strength
[1:10:02] if you're waiting then there's no time
[1:10:04] limit but God will renew your strength
[1:10:06] you just gotta believe that he's going
[1:10:07] to do it in his perfect time
[1:10:11] verse 7 be not wise in thy own eyes no
[1:10:15] fear the lord notice that fear the lord
[1:10:18] and notice what says another commandment
[1:10:20] and depart from Evil so you got to fear
[1:10:23] the lord and depart from evil
[1:10:26] so let's go to Psalm 16. uh actually no
[1:10:28] read 16 11. let's go to 16 11 then we'll
[1:10:31] go to 15.
[1:10:33] so
[1:10:37] so 16 11 we read this already but read
[1:10:39] again
[1:10:41] says that will show me the path of life
[1:10:44] in my presence is the fullness of joy
[1:10:48] so if you're looking for joy in any
[1:10:51] other place but in the presence of God
[1:10:53] you'll never find it
[1:10:55] I don't care how many cars you buy
[1:10:58] how many uh Collectibles you buy how
[1:11:01] many whatever you fill in the blank
[1:11:02] you'll never you'll be searching
[1:11:04] constantly and be missing always feel
[1:11:07] like you're missing something amen
[1:11:09] and go to 15 Psalms 15 which is this
[1:11:12] next door and reverses one through five
[1:11:15] Lord who shall abide in thy Tabernacle
[1:11:17] it's asking a question who shall dwell
[1:11:19] in the Holy Hill
[1:11:21] he that walketh uprightly
[1:11:25] and worketh righteousness and speaketh
[1:11:29] the truth in his heart so Noah's heart
[1:11:32] is just mentioned so many times not
[1:11:34] talking about just your fleshly heart
[1:11:35] but your spiritual heart if we could say
[1:11:37] it that way because God said I'll give
[1:11:39] you a new heart
[1:11:40] and says he that back biteth not with
[1:11:43] this tongue nor doeth evil so saying is
[1:11:45] saying these people who are going to
[1:11:46] abide in there he that backbideth not
[1:11:49] with his tongue nor doeth evil to his
[1:11:52] neighbor nor taketh up a reproach
[1:11:54] against his neighbor in verse 4 in whose
[1:11:56] eyes a vile person is condemned but he
[1:12:00] honoreth them that fear the lord notice
[1:12:03] that again fear the lord
[1:12:06] amen uh he that sweareth not to his own
[1:12:10] hurt and changeth not he that puteth not
[1:12:13] out his money to assuring or taketh
[1:12:15] reward against the innocent he that
[1:12:17] doeth these things shall never be moved
[1:12:20] so all these things just telling us what
[1:12:21] we should do and shouldn't do and it
[1:12:23] says
[1:12:24] never would never be moved amen so if
[1:12:27] we're doing these things fearing the
[1:12:28] Lord seeking after his heart seeking
[1:12:31] after the perfect will of God following
[1:12:32] his Commandments then how can we be how
[1:12:35] can we be moved because we're standing
[1:12:37] in God we're standing in his
[1:12:39] righteousness not ours his grace his
[1:12:42] Mercy his strength his power his
[1:12:45] Revelation so if we're standing all
[1:12:46] those things that are God then how can
[1:12:48] we be moved because we recognize my help
[1:12:50] coming from who the Lord
[1:12:53] and if you recognize where everything
[1:12:54] comes from which comes from God then
[1:12:57] your eye is going to be fixed on him
[1:12:58] your heart's going to be fixed on him
[1:13:01] so I think we can never forget what he
[1:13:03] did at Calvary because if you ever if
[1:13:05] you if you forget that you'll lose your
[1:13:07] indebtedness so let's never lose that
[1:13:09] indebtedness to God and we'll always
[1:13:11] have our eyes fixed upon him
[1:13:14] let's go to Psalms 37.
[1:13:21] amen
[1:13:26] verse 1.
[1:13:29] fret not thyself because of evil doers
[1:13:33] so let's not worry
[1:13:35] about what's happening in the world all
[1:13:36] these things are happening yeah you want
[1:13:37] to be obviously informed but let it not
[1:13:40] affect your walk with God because
[1:13:43] perilous times in in the book of Timothy
[1:13:46] Paul tells us these things aren't you
[1:13:47] know
[1:13:48] a surprise men's Gonna Be Love of
[1:13:50] theirselves and uh unthankful and all
[1:13:53] the Unholy having a form of godliness
[1:13:55] without the power thereof so all these
[1:13:57] things are meant to happen these are the
[1:13:59] scriptures being fulfilled which we
[1:14:01] should be happy they're being fulfilled
[1:14:02] because we're that that much closer to
[1:14:04] the coming of the Lord amen service
[1:14:06] scriptures that's being fulfilled in the
[1:14:08] Bible
[1:14:09] and we're almost home
[1:14:13] verse 3.
[1:14:15] verse two
[1:14:18] neither be thou envious against the
[1:14:19] workers of iniquity for they shall soon
[1:14:22] be cut down
[1:14:23] so this world is going to be cut down
[1:14:26] so you know what do we have to worry
[1:14:28] about God's Vengeance will be mine
[1:14:31] if they don't repent and turn them to
[1:14:33] God then they're gonna have they're
[1:14:34] gonna have to answer for why they didn't
[1:14:35] do that
[1:14:37] like the grass and whether as the green
[1:14:39] herb says trust in the Lord notice how
[1:14:42] much that that word is used in Proverbs
[1:14:44] it says trust in the Lord
[1:14:46] and do good so shall thou dwell in the
[1:14:49] land and verily thou shall be fed
[1:14:52] Delight thyself I remember uh my brother
[1:14:56] was talking to me yesterday
[1:14:57] uh the scripture and this I just felt in
[1:15:00] my heart to put this in here if you just
[1:15:02] look
[1:15:03] look at verse 4 the first look at verse
[1:15:05] 4 the first verse Delight look at verse
[1:15:06] five commit and then look at verse seven
[1:15:09] rest and look at verse eight cease all
[1:15:12] those are so important we're going to
[1:15:13] just get into that but I just love that
[1:15:15] I was just looking at them like man I
[1:15:17] can just see it clearly now I just see
[1:15:19] the word I see Delight commit rest cease
[1:15:21] I'm like and let's go I love the word
[1:15:24] amen trust in the Lord and do good so
[1:15:27] thou shall dwell in the land and verily
[1:15:29] shall not be fed verse 4 Delight thyself
[1:15:32] also in the Lord and we know what
[1:15:35] Delight means a high degree of pleasure
[1:15:37] or satisfaction of mind and joy
[1:15:40] and it says and he shall give the
[1:15:43] desires of thine heart but we got to
[1:15:46] make sure our desires are lining up with
[1:15:50] the word of God because a lot of times
[1:15:51] we have desires that are lustful desires
[1:15:54] we got to make sure that our desires
[1:15:58] please God
[1:15:59] because we're like oh why did he give
[1:16:01] Desires in my heart maybe they're not
[1:16:03] lining up with God's plan for your life
[1:16:06] your motive isn't lining up so sometimes
[1:16:09] we gotta just look back and see what
[1:16:11] maybe God didn't answer for a certain
[1:16:12] reason and even a no from God is just as
[1:16:15] good as a yes
[1:16:17] so it says commit thy way unto the Lord
[1:16:20] notice that commit
[1:16:22] so trust commit
[1:16:26] thy way unto the Lord trust also in him
[1:16:29] and say that word again trust also in
[1:16:31] him so you got to commit yourself unto
[1:16:33] God and trust that he's going to lead
[1:16:36] you
[1:16:37] to the end Mark that high calling that
[1:16:40] that that Perfect Image that theophany
[1:16:45] so you got to trust that he can do that
[1:16:46] and he shall bring it to pass and he
[1:16:49] shall also he shall bring forth thy
[1:16:52] righteousness as the light and the
[1:16:54] Judgment as the Noonday verse 7 rest in
[1:16:57] the Lord now that's not talking about
[1:16:59] some lazy rest it's not talking about
[1:17:01] that kind of rest because your rest is
[1:17:02] the Holy Ghost see when you're resting
[1:17:04] then you can truly work if you're
[1:17:06] arrested in the Holy Ghost you can truly
[1:17:08] be a worker that the Holy Ghost can use
[1:17:10] that's the type of rest that we're
[1:17:11] talking about not as the world says in
[1:17:13] your lay back in a lazy boy but resting
[1:17:15] in the Lord knowing that he's your
[1:17:18] Jehovah Jireh that he's your healing
[1:17:20] that he's your portion all those things
[1:17:22] you can rest in knowing the Lord if you
[1:17:24] need healing he's going to provide that
[1:17:26] if you need food in the table he's going
[1:17:28] to provide that if you need money in the
[1:17:29] bank account he's going to provide that
[1:17:31] if you need a vehicle he's going to
[1:17:32] provide that if you need clothes guess
[1:17:34] what he's going to provide that
[1:17:38] it'll keep going verse uh finish verse 7
[1:17:40] up and wait it says rest in the Lord and
[1:17:42] wait patiently for him see God doesn't
[1:17:45] work on your time he works on his
[1:17:47] perfect time say one more time God
[1:17:49] doesn't work on your time he works on
[1:17:51] his perfect time
[1:17:53] says wait patiently for him fret not
[1:17:56] thyself because of him who prospereth in
[1:17:58] his way don't look to other person in
[1:18:00] the world that's prospering don't worry
[1:18:02] about that
[1:18:03] God blesses the just and unjust I'd
[1:18:05] rather have my soul prospering all day
[1:18:08] every day over me having a million
[1:18:10] dollars in my bank account
[1:18:11] this is dishonest with you because a
[1:18:13] million dollars in make account doesn't
[1:18:14] mean that you're that much closer to God
[1:18:16] than the next Joe it doesn't
[1:18:21] says who prospereth in the way his way
[1:18:23] because of the man who bringeth Wicked
[1:18:25] devices to pass verse eight no cease
[1:18:28] from anger and forsake wrath it's
[1:18:31] telling us to
[1:18:33] let that go let the anger go let the
[1:18:35] Wrath go
[1:18:36] because only wrath and anger is going to
[1:18:38] destroy you eventually if you let it so
[1:18:40] we can't have anger and wrath in our
[1:18:42] life we got to forsake those things
[1:18:44] fret not thyself and any wise to do evil
[1:18:47] forever do or shall be cut off but those
[1:18:50] that Waits upon the Lord they show and
[1:18:54] inherit the earth
[1:18:56] and then we'll go to
[1:18:58] verse 23.
[1:19:01] the steps of a good man are ordered by
[1:19:04] the Lord and he delighteth in his way
[1:19:08] though he fall notice that though he
[1:19:11] fall he shall not be utterly cast down
[1:19:14] for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand
[1:19:17] I have been young and now am old yet now
[1:19:20] I have seen I I not seen the righteous
[1:19:24] forsaken nor is seed begging for bread
[1:19:27] could we serve up a mighty God
[1:19:30] he's not going to leave you he's not
[1:19:32] going to forsake you he's going to be
[1:19:33] with you until the end whatever your end
[1:19:35] is whatever my end is he's going to be
[1:19:37] with you until the end
[1:19:41] his Mercy he is ever merciful and
[1:19:45] lindeth and his seed is blessed notice
[1:19:47] verse 27 says saying depart from Evil
[1:19:50] and do good
[1:19:52] and dwell forevermore
[1:19:54] so it says depart from Evil and do good
[1:19:56] and dwell forevermore
[1:19:58] so God wants to give us
[1:20:00] things that he is in store for us he
[1:20:03] wants to bless you exceedingly
[1:20:04] abundantly than what you expect but he
[1:20:07] cannot give it to you unless our ways
[1:20:10] are committed unto him we must trust
[1:20:13] Delight
[1:20:15] commit rest and seize cease so look
[1:20:19] those words up so trust confidence so
[1:20:22] when you're trusting in somebody you
[1:20:23] have confidence that they're going to
[1:20:25] fulfill what they said just like as a
[1:20:27] parent to a or a kid to a parent they
[1:20:30] have trust that your mom and dad are
[1:20:31] going to provide for you
[1:20:33] say a Reliance so when we're trusted in
[1:20:36] God we're relying on God we're arrested
[1:20:38] says resting off the mind on the
[1:20:40] Integrity veracity Justice friendship or
[1:20:44] other sound principle of another person
[1:20:45] to be confident of something present or
[1:20:48] future United is going to believe that
[1:20:51] God God can do this but you're going to
[1:20:52] believe he will do this because his word
[1:20:54] declares he's going to do this
[1:20:56] so it says resting uh friendship other
[1:20:59] sound principle another person to be
[1:21:01] confident of something present or future
[1:21:03] says to commit to the care of
[1:21:06] incompetence trust your maker with
[1:21:10] yourself in all your concerns or no more
[1:21:13] time trust your maker with yourself and
[1:21:17] all your concerns
[1:21:19] and I like the word delight a high
[1:21:21] degree of pleasure or satisfaction of
[1:21:24] Mind joy to affect with great pleasure
[1:21:27] to please highly so you're delightening
[1:21:30] God you want to please him highly to
[1:21:32] give or afford High satisfaction or joy
[1:21:35] as a beautiful landscape Delights the
[1:21:37] eyes
[1:21:38] Harmony Delights The Ear The Good
[1:21:40] Conduct of children and especially
[1:21:43] their Delights their parents so commit
[1:21:46] to give in trust to put in the hands or
[1:21:50] power of another so you're willing to
[1:21:52] let go of your plans your hopes your
[1:21:55] dreams your thoughts and commit yourself
[1:21:58] unto God lord if the plans that I have
[1:22:00] don't line up with your plans I'm gonna
[1:22:02] kick them right out
[1:22:04] and so you got to be willing to commit
[1:22:06] yourself to God daily because it's so
[1:22:08] easy for those things just to creep in
[1:22:11] our lives and we we kind of don't get
[1:22:13] committed as we once were we got to be
[1:22:15] just as committed as we were when we
[1:22:17] started the race so we can finish the
[1:22:18] race like that because many has started
[1:22:20] in this race but have not finished it
[1:22:23] that's right they they they gave up they
[1:22:25] threw the tile in let us not be any of
[1:22:28] those people that have thrown the towel
[1:22:30] in like I said before we've come too far
[1:22:32] to not to be a man after God's Own Heart
[1:22:38] so it says trust aren't sorry to give
[1:22:40] trust to put in the hands or power of
[1:22:43] another to entrust with confidence or
[1:22:46] relying with him for wrestling in the
[1:22:47] mind
[1:22:48] so we gotta cease as well
[1:22:51] and cease means to put a stop
[1:22:54] so this the Bible says to cease from
[1:22:56] anger
[1:22:57] to put it in to Cease the rage
[1:23:01] also means Extinction
[1:23:03] to stop to be at an end as wondrous
[1:23:06] ceases the storm had when a storm stops
[1:23:09] and it's gone it stops no more
[1:23:11] same thing in our life we gotta stop
[1:23:13] those things that are taking us away
[1:23:16] from God
[1:23:18] we got to stop playing in fire
[1:23:20] and just walk away from it let it go if
[1:23:24] God is calling you to leave something
[1:23:25] leave it don't try to play it Samson
[1:23:28] tried to play with Delilah and look what
[1:23:31] happened that wasn't I don't believe
[1:23:33] that's God's perfect will for him just
[1:23:34] to perish like that but what he did was
[1:23:36] he gave his heart to Delilah while still
[1:23:38] trying to serve God right and God can't
[1:23:41] use you in the magnitude that he wants
[1:23:43] you to use if you're playing with
[1:23:45] Delilah Emma and Delilah is the type of
[1:23:48] the world you have to have a girl in
[1:23:50] your life but Delilah can be something
[1:23:51] that you've been holding on to that you
[1:23:53] haven't let go let go of it
[1:23:55] we've come too far
[1:23:57] so expectations this is from brother
[1:23:59] Brandon 1950 August 10th
[1:24:03] but look you can't judge Men by the size
[1:24:06] of his stature
[1:24:08] I've seen men that weigh 200 pounds and
[1:24:10] have an ounce of man man is judged by
[1:24:13] character man
[1:24:15] and then and then be a man after the
[1:24:17] heart a man after God's heart and God
[1:24:20] will bless you so he'll bless you for
[1:24:22] being a man after his own heart
[1:24:25] and we'll finish up in
[1:24:28] give me one second
[1:24:33] we'll finish up with this quote actually
[1:24:37] I was thinking of Jairus in the Bible
[1:24:39] when he said come lay your hand on my
[1:24:41] daughter
[1:24:42] and she she shall live
[1:24:44] but the Roman Centurion the Gentile he
[1:24:47] said I'm not worthy that you'll come
[1:24:49] under my roof let's look at the humility
[1:24:50] he said just speak the word
[1:24:53] Jesus admired that
[1:24:56] I love that because that Roman realized
[1:24:58] that Jesus
[1:25:00] I love this head every disease under his
[1:25:03] control so that Roman Centurion
[1:25:06] maybe to some Jew was
[1:25:09] um a heathen but he recognized that
[1:25:12] Jesus Christ who he was had had power
[1:25:15] over every disease and he felt So
[1:25:18] Unworthy to be in the presence of the
[1:25:22] king that he even went he said just
[1:25:24] speak the word and I know
[1:25:27] my servant will be healed so we got to
[1:25:29] have that type of faith knowing maybe
[1:25:31] you've been dealing with something for
[1:25:32] years remember that woman 12 years
[1:25:34] dealing with that blood issue and she
[1:25:37] made up in her mind
[1:25:38] if I just touched the Hem of His Garment
[1:25:41] and she didn't let the her other past
[1:25:43] failures just distract her or hurt her
[1:25:46] but she said if I just touched him in
[1:25:48] His Garment and he said thy faith
[1:25:50] heals it
[1:25:52] so maybe maybe we just need a touch of
[1:25:54] him of His Garment tonight
[1:25:55] may we just need to touch his heart
[1:25:57] tonight
[1:25:59] let's finish this quote
[1:26:01] he said Jesus or just speak the word and
[1:26:03] my servant will live
[1:26:04] and those what brother bran says right
[1:26:06] here
[1:26:07] and that's the way we want to be
[1:26:08] Christians to admire
[1:26:11] and to stand up as great gallient
[1:26:13] soldiers in the face of conflict and let
[1:26:16] our heavenly father say I have a child
[1:26:19] that I'm proud of let's be like job
[1:26:22] he said job have you my perfect servant
[1:26:25] Joel
[1:26:28] I have the child that I'm proud of you
[1:26:30] know God does look upon us like that
[1:26:32] amen because you know he said David was
[1:26:35] a man after his own heart and knows what
[1:26:37] he says right here and that's the way we
[1:26:39] want to be
[1:26:40] after his own heart
[1:26:44] so in this day and age our heart needs
[1:26:47] to be fixed upon him we need to trust
[1:26:49] him in every situation we're going
[1:26:51] through
[1:26:53] because this is getting darker and
[1:26:55] darker and these doors are going to
[1:26:57] close one day
[1:26:58] I want to make sure that we're every
[1:27:00] time we're sitting in these seats every
[1:27:02] time we're in the prayer the prayer room
[1:27:03] needs to be full every service
[1:27:05] we don't need to be talking before
[1:27:06] service we got to be seeking him talking
[1:27:09] with if you want to talk with anybody
[1:27:10] talk with God
[1:27:12] because you can talk with me before a
[1:27:14] service but I can't give you anything
[1:27:16] I can't give you anything but if we're
[1:27:18] spending time with God before service
[1:27:20] then God can just move in such a mighty
[1:27:22] way
[1:27:23] and God wants to move in a mighty way
[1:27:26] but if we're not preparing our heart
[1:27:28] for not seeking on him on a daily basis
[1:27:30] if we're not going after him we ought to
[1:27:32] go after God because the devil wants you
[1:27:36] to not go after God because he knows
[1:27:38] when you go after God and seek God then
[1:27:40] healing is going to happen spiritual
[1:27:42] healing physical healing Revelation is
[1:27:45] going to happen life direction is going
[1:27:47] to happen confusion is going to go away
[1:27:49] turn to peace
[1:27:51] and so we gotta be seeking after those
[1:27:52] things which is the things of God that's
[1:27:55] going to give us fruit I don't want this
[1:27:58] right I want rotten fruit I want fruit
[1:28:00] that
[1:28:01] will help sustain somebody else
[1:28:04] amen oh it was we're going to stand to
[1:28:07] our feet in this invite sister Cheryl
[1:28:11] so I just look at the life of David
[1:28:14] and want to be like David faith faith
[1:28:16] like David love God like David
[1:28:20] because David was a man after God's Own
[1:28:23] Heart now I'm just so thankful that God
[1:28:25] placed this man in the Bible for us
[1:28:28] and we just see brother Brandon
[1:28:30] mentioned David lots of times
[1:28:32] and I think it's very in order for us to
[1:28:35] maybe go back in the Book of Psalms
[1:28:37] let's look at David's life look how the
[1:28:40] things he wrote he knew how to praise
[1:28:42] the Lord he knew how to Worship the Lord
[1:28:43] he knew how to love the Lord and let's
[1:28:45] just look at his example and say Lord
[1:28:46] help me
[1:28:48] to live a life similar to David yeah we
[1:28:50] can't be David but we can be like David
[1:28:52] because guess what was in David the
[1:28:54] spirit of Christ was in David it's in
[1:28:55] Paul so we could be like Paul like
[1:28:58] Christ
[1:28:59] all these servants were pointing to
[1:29:01] Jesus Christ
[1:29:02] and so I just see that I just believe
[1:29:05] that in this day and age we need to
[1:29:08] unite together more we need to pray more
[1:29:10] we need to seek God more say Lord
[1:29:14] what do you want me to be on this Earth
[1:29:18] who do you want me to speak to today
[1:29:20] what do you want me to do for you today
[1:29:22] and that's being a man after God's Own
[1:29:25] Heart because you're you're setting
[1:29:27] aside your will your plans sometimes
[1:29:29] like brother Ferguson said this we'll
[1:29:31] plan a day out
[1:29:33] and and not even include God into it
[1:29:35] sometimes God might change the whole
[1:29:37] direction of your day Say Hey I want you
[1:29:38] to do this instead of this today like
[1:29:40] you might want a fat he might want you
