these things now we pray them in Jesus Christ's name amen amen turn with me if you would to Genesis Chapter 18 this just kind of came at the last minute we uh appreciate uh brother Marken amen and his heart to just want to come and visit we appreciate all that God's doing in his life and all that God has in store for him how how's going to be praying with me and continue to pray for brother Mark amen amen amen Genesis Chapter 18 we know this is the story here where uh God Appears unto Abraham we're going to read it kind of quick here I want us to notice the respect that Abraham had for God before God blessed him and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of MRI and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and low three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my Lord if now I have have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant and they said so do as thou H has said and Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah and said make ready quick three measures of meal uh knead it and make cakes upon the Hearth and Abram Abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it unto the young man and he he hastened to dress it and he took the butter and the milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat and they said unto him and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him Abraham and Sarah were old well stricken in age and it ceased to be what Sarah after the man women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I of a shy bear a son which am old is there anything too hard for the Lord amen I want us to remember that question now in 2 Corinthians chapter 9 is anything too hard for the Lord I want us just to think about it for our lives amen 2 Corinthians chapter 9 starting with verse number six six is 6 through 8 then we'll have you be seated by this I say he which sth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which sth bountifully shall reap also bountifully every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of a necessity for God loveth a cheerful Giver for God is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work amen God bless you and God bless the you may be seated and may God bless the the reading of his precious word to our hearts and just open uh our hearts to this little thought here that God is able I want to connect with you this morning and if I could just I guess you know I really want to just I want to speak to you directly but not only to you I want to speak to you and I I want to speak to everybody in this room I want to speak to those that are in the other rooms I want to speak to those that are on the live stream I want to speak to those even that didn't make the live stream but they're watching The Archives I believe that God wants us to know that he has a Grace for our our lives that can take care of whatever need that we may have am how many times have you have you thought I wish I would have done this when I was younger I I wish I would have done that and you can even be uh as as as as young as as Luke in in James I I wish I would have uh I wish I would have cleaned my room like my parents said so I didn't get in trouble amen I wish I would have taken better care of my teeth if I would have known what I know now I wish I would have taken better care of my body and my health I wish I would have started saving money when I was younger wish I would have started the 401 or my investments or or buying a house I wish I would have made better decisions I can see now that they were right I wish I would have listened to them I I should have followed their guidance we've all had these thoughts and why why because there is a law that what we sow is what we reap just like gravity what goes up comes down there's a spiritual law of God and it it also affects the natural realm like every seed brings forth of its kind sewing reaping is a real law of God and it extends far beyond the offering plate as these scriptures perhaps refer to but I want to dig in a little deeper than that if a person plants a few uh seeds of corn if you go down Heartland Road you turn to the right you'll see there's a little garden there and somebody planted a few seeds of corn it wasn't very many there's just some little stocks that come up and if you you plant a little bit of corn you're just going to get a few ears of corn but if a person plants a whole Field of Corn then he's going to receive so many bushels that he can't even carry amen just whatever you sow is what you reap our neighbor across the street they are beginning to reap the the alphalpha that they sold years ago and you can keep sewing you can keep reaping years and years with certain things people don't uh look too much into the visible or the spiritual realm of sewing and reaping it's kind of like out of sight out of mind type of thing for most people but it's just as real as natural seed so good to see sister Genie here that God has given her strength her body to be here the Bible says he which soeth sparingly shall reap also spearing you don't want to be stingy amen he which Seth bountifully shall reap also bountifully I want us to take a look at our lives and where we're at whatever you s that's what you're going to reap doesn't matter what kind of seed how many seeds it's all it's all up to you if you seow the word of God you will reap the benefits that the word of God gives you the the promises of of God in your life you you can't be sewing what you your own will and expect God's blessings it just doesn't work like that in the Garden of Eden there was natural seeds and there were spiritual seeds and there was also good seeds and Bad Seeds Jesus or The God said the day that you eat thereof is the day that you'll die and and it happened they they they sold that seed and they reaped that seed let's take a look here at what we need to do the the Bible says that we should so the seeds as as it we purpose in our heart and in other words God wants us to seow seeds from the sincerity of our heart not with manipulation amen not with well I I guess I got to give if I don't you know well you know I mean just like the offering plate right why don't we pass an offering plate one reason we don't want feel people to ever feel manipulated amen but I believe in the offering plate I don't I don't believe any service is complete with without an offering but I don't believe in manipulation but I also don't believe that we should manipulate the Holy Ghost In other words God got good track right he knows the numbers of our hair he knows whether we're given from our heart or when we're trying to hold back whether we're faithful with our ties and offerings or we're not but the main thing he says just do as you purpose in your heart if you purpose to plant three seeds in your garden or you purpose to plant 500 lbs of seed in a 40 acre field whatever you purpose whatever you seow is what you're going to get am you know I've always liked this that I'm so glad that I'm not I was never under the the spirit of I have to do only this Amen in other words if I wanted to do a better job if I wanted to give more if I wanted to lay down my life there was there was nobody telling me I couldn't do it amen because it's between me and God and I'm glad that there's an a rock solid Revelation that we can know that what we sow is what we're going to reap because I believe that we can be blessed I believe we can prosper in life if we if we sow a kind word once in a while well then God will see to it that once in a while you get a kind word back if you if you uh sow 500 pounds of seeds of kindness God's going to make sure that you reap acres and Acres of kindness if you s car sarcasm you're gonna you're going to reap it if you sow seeds of Doubt brother Bram says you get what you expect if you sow seeds of discrepancy Discord back Bri than Division and separation is what you're going to reap if you s constant seeds of divine love without respect to persons God will fill your life so full of the love you will be have room for anything [Music] else I love this it's in our choice amen it's what we want to S nobody forces it on us if we s seeds of hatred or anger or fighting or disrespect then God will see to it that our life is filled with those things because it's a law amen we can't just say we can't just do what we want say I'm sorry and keep doing it we got to make choices and the choices that we make have a difference of what our outcome is going to be so if we if our life is filled with living for others then God is going to bless you beyond measure beyond measure the Bible said that he is able to make all grace abound towards you that you should always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work God is able to make all grace abound to that means he's also able to not amen now he is a god without respected persons and he loves everybody but he's also a God that set a law out there of reaping and sewing I like what Jesus said in Luke 6:38 he said and I'm sorry I didn't give time to write this one down to put in the back but he said give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you might with all it shall be measured to you again so even Jesus is is is sharing the Bible is so full of making it real clear that you get what you give and and of course if you plant one piece of corn you get more than just one piece of corn right you get a whole stalk and you get ears and so you get a lot more just by planting one that that's the way that that God is and sometimes uh you know when we plant one bad seed right it it can it can also bring forth a lot of bad a lot more bad Galatians 6:7 Paul's saying to the Galatians here be not deceived so it's very easy to be deceived about this God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also reap for he that sth to his flesh shall reap shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that sth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting so naturally or spiritually a seed is a seed and God said let every seed bring forth of its own kind amen we just can't you know this is this is how deceptive it is we think we can act any way we want to and should expect to be blessed by others I I just I don't get that I just I mean how long do we got to live you only got to read the Bible one time and just believe the Bible right because the word is true I'm a liar but the word is true and the word it the word cannot lie I mean God said that I'm not good I believe it let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not keep doing good keep giving keep living for others keep putting the word of God first in your life and it will come back to you God will not have one person on the day of judgment that that wasn't a true word amen not a one because God is not going to be found in front of the whole creation that he created as a liar to one person amen see understand God will hold true to his word we just got to obey it amen be not weary and well doing it doesn't matter if you're just so fed up and you've gone to the fire keep doing well as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men you know we got one amen you know that takes a lot of thinking about others right as we have opportunity well you know I don't have any opportunity I'm too busy I am just too busy sister bman I hope it's okay she came over to help sister Cheryl with the house of course I got benefited from that because the house is cleaner right but she gave of herself and and you know honestly I think if I'm not mistaken Cheryl tried to like no no it's not necessary and then I think she you called an and then an you know so you know what I mean sometimes opportunity I say it like this I I think it was uh uh yes thank you my brother you get up here and preach with me Thomas Jefferson no no no Edison Edison he said uh uh opportunity is all around us it it's just it wears overhauls and it looks like work am and I think the scripture is telling as plainly as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the house Household of Faith taking time to do things for your brothers and your sisters I I believe that God looks at that and he will make all grace abound unto you now as we plant a a regular Garden we've all done that we got to take proper care we can't just plant the seeds we got to take proper care uh you just can't go out there and throw the seeds out like that that's right so it's important to seow the seeds the right way brother brandom said that when we apply the token I'm just to to speak spiritually for a second brother Ben says when you apply the token to your children you have to believe that what you're going to do is going to have an effect on themen so when you sew a seed into the garden you have to have a faith that that seed's going to go or you wouldn't even go out there to plant it you got to have faith so we need to make sure that we're planting seeds in the proper soils you just can't throw it on the hard ground and you may have to add some required now notice natural fertilizers make sure that you're you're watering the seeds as they need to be water watered you need to make sure that you you you you you pull the weeds out because they can choke out the real plants that you planted right we us we don't go and we just we don't go ahead and just kill everything that's in the soil then plant the seeds so we don't have to pull the weeds right we we have to pull the weeds amen now the the thing is if we don't take care of these things then we're not going to get the fruit that we would like to we know that weeds literally grow some weeds grow so much faster than than other than than our crops that we're planting true now a Believer must have faith when he soles the promises of God into his heart we got to make sure that our hearts are not hardened amen they're not Stony they're not filled with anxiety and and and filled with uh uh distrust and uh anger and and and doubts and uh just the things of the world because a seed will not grow a word of God will not grow in a heart like that you got to make sure that we're we're we're not filled with the wrong things because they'll literally choke out the word of God so we must water this seed day and night with praise with worship amen with Thanksgiving like I don't see the seed but I know it's going to come forth and then we get a we we see a couple leaves and we think well that's not what I was hoping for it takes time let us not be weary and well doing this is called taking proper care of the seed and if a Believer does not give the proper care of Faith to the seeds that he's sewn that they will also die so go plant a bunch of corn on top of some stones and see what happens or go plant them in some good soil but never get it water right so we've got to take proper care we just can't come to church and say Amen to the word and then that's all we're going to do with the word we got to take the word home and we got to start living it we got to start applying what we need to make the word come alive in our life the Bible tells us that we got to hold our beginning confidence firm unto the End Amen right so we just we just keep keep being firm to the End Amen sowing the word will reap the benefits of the word uh turn with me to Psalms chapter one and I I must say this came to me in our men's meeting when brother um Mark read these scriptures as he was reading of course my subject was coming God was speaking to me about today's message but we can see a lot here about the reaping and the sewing uh uh in in these first four verses Psalms chap 1 verse one blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way with the Sinners nor sth in the seat of just being scornful we've been through these before but his Delight is in the word of God and in the word of God doth he meditate not just on Wednesdays and Sundays but he meditates day and night amen now if you s that verse three tells us what we reap and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season and his Leaf also shall not wither prise the Lord and I love this last part and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper what soever he doeth can you imagine walking around with 5 million bucks in your pocket like wherever you want to eat whatever car you want to drive buy whatever house you want to buy going to the hospital you're not worried about you're not worried about money because you have what you need to take care of all the needs and if you have a promise that whatever you're going to do is prosper why wouldn't you do it with excitement because you know you put God first amen because this is his word if you you sow the word you reap the word if you don't seow the word you can't expect the reaping of the word and look the Saints this is for us individually I don't care who's sitting next to you I don't care who's sitting in front of you or behind you God is speaking to you directly it's up to you to take this word and say for me in my I want this now the ungodly are not so but they are like the chaff which the wind driveth away I mean if you think about that there's like no even you don't miss it you don't want it it never was part of the fruit right you understand what I'm saying so look we've got to take the word and start making it real to us I know we come to church and sometimes we're looking to get you know back excited with the word again you know we had a wonderful service last Sunday it was amazing service loved it but you know what that service in itself is not going to change my every day because that's not what the word says come to service hit a good service from a great from a great Minister and you know what whereever whatever you do you're going to prosper that's not what the word says so today we have what we need to start prospering am we have choices that we we make all the time and we we need to understand that God is able to make all grace abound to us am we can't forget that the missing sometimes we just miss the desire because the the Bible says but his Delight is in the law of the Lord if your Delight is not in the law of the Lord then how are you going to actually put your heart into meditating TR you know a lot of times we'll go ahead and we'll we ain't got much time but we'll you know read that bread of life and you know just kind of do our best to think on it and then you know just wait till the next day to the next bread of life you understand what I'm getting to you you you got to put your heart into God if you you want God to prosper you am problem why people aren't prospering they're they don't even care to know more about God and it's not that the knowledge of God but why why do you think God is is saying to you I'm going to prosper you if you put me first is he is he such a God that he doesn't want to prosper everybody is he such a GU is he is he acting like a respect to person he knows all that comes before him are theves and robbers they just want from him but God is looking for a relationship and I think too many Christians are get soaked up in this Le to see his Spirit get brought down at the cares of this world and they don't have faith that God is able to make all grace abound to him but he's able he's more than able people are so full of themselves they really don't care about God they become lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God Christians have literally lost their hunger and their thirst you know brother bam says a true Christ he can't wait till he gets to the house of the Lord well I'm still a Christian but I don't have that desire while I'm telling you friend you need to get filled with the Holy Ghost you know you you may want to water down the gospel but I'm telling you you can't water this down you can't you can water your life but you can't water this try putting out a fire that can't get put out you know the devil wants to put us out and he'll do it with the cares of this life David said in Psalms 42 verse1 as the heart panteth for the water Brooks so panteth my soul after thee Oh God not everybody's soul is is after God though he said my soul thirsteth for God not some picture right not some book on a table some picture on a wall but for the Living God Amen When shall I come and appear before God uh look at this verse three my tears are speaking here my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy God that's desperation brother brand said you we need to get desperate for God you know I understand that we we got sicknesses we've got problems we we've got Financial we there's so many things wrong but I'm telling you if we just learn to set it all aside and put our heart towards God first God will meet our need his his grace is more than able to give us all that we have need of but he wants to be first that's all there is to it he is not waiting for us to suffer so much and say okay you suffered no we just got to make a decision in our heart I'm going to put you first Lord Paul said in Philippians chapter 3: 10 oh that I might know him and the power of of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable on to his death I want you to understand he had this desire after 33 years of marriage with Jesus Christ 33 years of being married to somebody and he still had this hunger to want to know the Lord more you know I don't know what is with a lot of people but they could care too hoot sometimes if they even go to church you know what I think I think they're missing the Holy Ghost because once you get the Holy Ghost which is the Divine love of God you can't stand being away from iten brother randam say the Holy Ghost feeds on the word of God you got the Holy Ghost you want to feed it's awful quiet we should get excited about this amen well brother John you just stepped on my toes I did not mean to step on anybody's toes I'm just meaning that we need to get serious with God Amen instead of just acting like we're something true I don't who cares I don't care I don't think God cares he just wants a relationship a real relationship verse 11 if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead how many wants to make a Rapture all right if by any means not as though I've already attained I've already apprehended either we're already perfect but this one thing I do I'm forgetting those things which are behind me and I'm reaching forth for those things which are before hunger a thirst a press you know you you talked to some Christians you look at some Christians life the way they act is I've attained I've apprehended I I I I've achieved I'm where I I should be where where where is that where what what is that spirit and where where do we get scriptures for that because I understand that we need to have confidence and assurance and we need to we need to we need to say Amen to what we have I understand that but you don't cross other scriptures to do that you still have to have a hunger and a thirst for more of God you still got to press the Bible says uh Paul said I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus now you take a lot of modern day preachers and they would say you know what I I've been serving the lord for 33 years you know what I wrote 14 books that every Christian reads you know I had so many Revelations God had to give me a thorn in the flesh that wasn't Paul's attitude am Paul's attitude was I need more of the Lord that's right I need it is he knew that God was able to make all grace abound to him and he said verse 15 let us therefore let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded how many think how many Wants to Be Perfect all you got to do is have this humble attitude amen I love it blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness Jesus said for they shall be filled now now the problem is um a lot of times we end up eating because we just it's time to eat you know we really don't care whatever whatever you want to eat let's just Eat Right you ever had that but when you get to the place where I've got to have the word of God I've got to have it that's when God comes and fills amen God is able to make all grace abound in our life Saints now God is able to prosper us Psalms 1:3 says and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf shall not wither and whatsoever you do shall prosper God is able to take any human being who takes the word of God and believes it into the heart and prosper them anyone he's he doesn't have respect to person but you got to put the word first the problem is worldly Christians are trying to get Prosperity without God that's what the world's doing that's what worldly Christians do I'm going to prosper without putting God first well go ahead try it especially if you're a son or daughter of God I it won't happen it won't won't happen now if you're of the world it may happen but if you're of God God wants you to get in your place which is to put the word of God first amen why would any man want to prosper outside of God anyways I don't understand that the devil gets people to believe that God wants me to prosper no matter what no God wants us to prosper as our soul prospers am God first Joshua 1:7 still speaking and God is able to prosper us here Joshua 1:7 only be thou strong very courageous you know one time I walked outside the back of the shop brother Ron's been in our shop brother Roger some of you been in our shop I walked in the probably many of you have years ago and I walked out in the back of the shop and one of my oh one of my nice employees put a dead snake right there oh and when I saw that I just about flipped courageous right I was when it comes to snakes being the shovel is the best friends but you know what it means to be courageous when I think of courageous I think of of David when he when he slew Goliath he slew the bear he slew the lion that's courageous he's you're going up against Great odds that's what God's telling us right here in this scripture amen only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded the don't turn from it from the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper whether soever thou goest again another book in the Bible telling us that if we put the word first we Prosper amen I love that it's like out of the mouth there two or three prophets let every word be established notice here the the key word is prosperity if God sent us a tent a prophet then we need to pay attention to what the prophet said in this age believe in the Lord your God so shall he be a St Believe In His prophets so shall ye Prosper we just got to do it verse eight this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth so in other words when your mouth starts speaking the wrong thing remember something departed from your mouth amen right are you with me yes and we're hearing this book of the law shall not Depart of th out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night you mean just so I can you know be able to quote any Scripture no right here tells you why that thou mayest observe to obey the word to do accordingly all that is written there and there's the reason we go and we read that we meditate is so we know how to better please the Lord and when you're when you're exercising that desire to please the Lord the Lord says I'm going to prosper you is that is that simple you know no I just we're we're going do a group thing right now we're all going to say Amen at one time just the word for then Thou shalt make your way prosperous and then then Thou shalt have good success we got the key I love that brother I I think we just we we need to tell the devil what side we're standing on because as long as we let the devil buff us around he's going to stay but when we say I'm standing now more on the word yeah you may have a fight the devil may not like it I understand that but you will end up prospering it's worth the fight this has always been God's provided way for blessing and prospering his children to put God first seek ye first the kingdom and all the things shall be added unto you God first then you amen a lot of times we put oursel first and we fit God in somewhere down the Road God is able to make all grace abound to us each day we need to choose who we're going to put first every day make that decision are we going to love God with all of our heart or we're just going to love them when we can fit them in now this message is not is not meant to you know um you know make it like you're you're a deer in in the headlights and it's also not just it's not meant to be an encouraging message in the aspect I just want to make you feel good I do want to encourage you that if you really want to get serious with God God is able to meet every one of your needs amen that's what this word is for this word is for you to get serious with God so God can bless you remember when uh God spoke to brother brandom in a prophecy he said it he said this in the message St the guy but he said it in the number of messages and he he he says he starts reading the prophecy because now this is God speaking in Prophecy to brother bran because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the hard way thou has walked in your own choosing what you know whatever you purpose in your heart brother brandom whatever you purpose because he could have had a millions of dollars he could have had his own religion he could have had his own religion he could have had a big following he he could have had so much just like us we have choices that we can do but he sold the right seed he wasn't just a churchgoer he wasn't some sort of religious fanatic he wasn't just some storefront it was a real deal with him because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou has walked in your own choosing thou has picked the precise and the correct way am the correct decision and God said and it is my way and brother Brian when he sharing this he says I underlined it my way because he said that was the Holy Ghost AM you know we're just like not interested in the Holy Ghost we're not interested in God's way we just want to go to church feel like we've you know achieved our our goal for the day for the week now we just go do what we you know put our mind on the next thing how do you expect to Prosper how do you expect all Grace to abound unto you look I am not interested in barely making it I'm not interested in getting a little joy to help me over a hump I want to be full of joy I want to be full of love and I don't want human love only I want Divine love because of this he calls it a momentous decision a huge part of Heaven awaits you you talk about reaping what a glorious decision thou has made he says now what a glorious decision now he says listen close what a glorious decision thou has made pay attention pay attention he's saying look at this watch listen closely you've made the right decision and other words you sold the right seed Our Lives we're going to plant on wherever we want right we're going to go eat at whatever restaurant we want to eat not me I have to go where brother Mark already asked where we're supposed to be going but for the most part everybody's going where they want to go right we're going to we're going to decide what we want to decide we got to decide to choose the harder way amen The Narrow Path and we need to do it of our own choosing not because the preacher said you better not about what the preacher says it's about your heart's love for Jesus Christ this in itself is that which will make and come to pass that tremendous victory in love divine a tremendous victory in love divine how many wants love divine if you've ever experienced love Divine there is nothing like it in the whole world nothing I've never experienced anything like love divine I haven't I mean I've had a lot of great experiences you the Bible tells us that we can enjoy the fruit of our labor with working with our hands and how many times you get done doing a project and you look at w that's is really nice you we we get to do that we get to enjoy but there is is nothing like Divine love am nothing brother BR went on to say in the same message two paragraphs now in the love divine or Divine love he says how can that be divine love if it isn't the Holy Ghost he said the holy spirit is divine love now why am I saying that why is that so important because so many people say that got the Holy Ghost but they don't have love they can't live for others or living selfishly but yet they say they got the Holy Ghost like you tell them you need to get the Holy Ghost and they get all offended and bent out of shape I I can imagine talking to Paul the Apostle Paul Paul you you need to get the Holy Ghost I want you to know brother John I'm pressing in for more I want would you come pray with me cuz I want more to that's what I see the right Spirit not defending like we some you know more more what do they say more Wars have been fought with over religion I don't know if that's a true statement but you understand we're so willing to defend what we got and we just want we won't give one humble one humbleness of okay I'll get more you know what I'm saying the reason I wanted to bring this up is when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time he was was experiencing this amazing feeling of divine love and a voice spoke to him and said this is what you already preached this is the Holy Ghost but when we think of preaching we think of going to church and somebody's preaching from the word of God they're preaching you know just the word Whatever It Is Well if you think about it this word which is the written holy spirit is love divine who so keepeth the word loveth God God is love we are hearing about Divine love every time we come to church if we don't even speak the word divine love when the word is being preached it is God's love to us it's his love letter experiences what is this this is what you preach it's the Holy Ghost look if you got the Holy Ghost bring out that Badge of love if you just love you don't have to say you got the Holy Ghost if you just lay down your life you don't have to prove anything your life is living [Music] it a huge portion of Heaven oh wait see God is able to make all grace abound to us see to me this is a this is our our chance to get ready for heaven that's all this is It's a chance to get ready for heaven and and if we take it seriously God can prosper us give us joy give us peace give us love there's lots of things where we can prosper right not just in money are you with me Psalms 126:5 says they that so in tears shall reap in Joy so I'm this this is we're going to get into how we seow what we need to do to get this they that seow in tears shall reap in Joy he that goeth forth weeping be bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again rejoicing bringing their sheaves with him turn with me if you would to James chapter 4 you know God gives so much more grace to a humble believer than to a proud believer trth amen you know how there's repellant for insects and animals yes I was working on the uh rocks yesterday and the mosquitoes were just getting on me so I just ran to the uh garage and I got some spray and I just sprayed it all over me because I didn't want to get bit I was trying to deter them away from me and I believe pride is the biggest deterrent of God you don't want God by you all you got to do is just be proudful just have a proud heart proud spirit I don't need to listen you know God will just stay so far away from you something funny true true I'm just being honest because we we got to get to the roof so we can get to what we need to get to to get all Grace to abound to us amen verse six James 46 but he giveth more grace wherefore he sayith God resisteth the proud there it is repels but he gives grace to the humble so submit yourself therefore to God resist the devil and he'll go bye-bye amen you draw a ey to God meditate day and night he'll draw an ey to you if you're serious clean up your life cleanse your hands you Sinners purify your hearts you double-minded you be afflicted mourn weep let your oh I don't need to do this your laughter turn into mourning and your joy into heaviness that's how you humble yourself humble yourself in the sight of the Lord and he praise God nobody else and he shall lift you up boy and when God picks you up you don't have to worry whether anybody's standing with you or not you don't need anybody to say you're up there right speak not every evil speak not evil one of another Brethren he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth the brother judgeth uh judge um speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law basically what you're doing is if if I say uh you know brother Mark I I I I I just don't like Bob you know what I did by saying I don't like Bob to brother Mark I'm speaking against God I'm speak and God wasn't even brought up it was just between me and Bob but there scripture is telling me when I judge my brother I'm a judge of the law and we know the law is God right but if thou judge the law Thou Art not a doer of the law but a judge and there's one lawgiver who's able to save and to destroy who art thou that judgeth not okay so God is able to make all grace abound and he's able to destroy whatever our attitude is humble or proud so we got to tap into God's grace we got to tap into into it God is able to make all grace abound unto us that we would always have all sufficiency in all things that's can you imagine just walking around with the checkbook we just need to be busy non-stop seing the word of God in our life God wants me to do this God wants me to do that God wants me to pray God wants me to love God wants me to be faithful nonstop soul that you'll see God will bless you and if God never gave you a nickel more but he filled you with joy unspeakable full of Glory wouldn't it be worth it amen be able to march up to the Lion's Den March up to the fiery furnace and never be whining about it have joy Peter don't don't crucify me like my Lord put me upside down he wasn't worried about dying he felt unworthy to die as as his Lord I'm telling you there's something here Saints it's it's a real God living inside of us and he's able to make this grace abound onto us but we've got to humble oursel and start sowing more of the right seeds amen we got a soul the right seeds God is able to give us more favor more strength more joy more love he's able to he's able to sustain us the Bible says all sufficiency in all things so just think of every aspect of your life that you want God you want help raising your kids right there you want help on your job right there you want job with your spouse right there amen you want help with more love for go right there he'll give us Better Homes and Gardens and Green Houses yes he's able he's truly able give us better relationships better atmospheres hope in all situations God is able to make all grace abound toward you that you would always have all sufficiency in all things that you may abound to every good do you ever have somebody come over the house there's a number of times we'll be eating a family member will stop in and we only like you know cook for like three at this time with an and Cheryl and myself well really I don't really do any of the cooking so I don't want you to think I do and then some some will one of the other children will come and well I'll just I'll simply just take a little piece and kind of you know push it over there without anybody knowing but isn't it nice when you cook a whole big pot of spaghetti and there's tons of food and there's enough for it to eat five times in a row and somebody comes in and you we have sufficient food what a feeling that is we're okay we're covered I tell you I want to be covered with God's grace and he's able to do it he's able what's stopping him me I'm stopping him it it's like I need to make the decision that brother Brandon made to choose the harder way Philippians 4:13 says I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me that means I can humble myself more I can commit to remaining humble after I commit myself I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me you know you can how many times you made a decision at church I'm gonna I'm going to try to be more humble God is able to help you stay committed to that God will give you Grace as you humble yourself to the word and that's what we need to tap into this morning tap in God's Grace by faith Romans chapter 5 verse2 we got to we got to hurry and I'll tell you just so you know this morning I'm just going to say this if we're later this morning I am totally blaming it on you because you're not saying amen enough usually I I take responsibility 24 but not this time I want to make sure you're getting it Romans 52 by whom also we have access by faith into this grace we need to believe it we need to hope for it we need to trust for God's grace we need to hang on to that confidence because it's by faith we have access into God's grace we're in we stand and rejoice in the hope of glory of the glory of God and not only not only so but we glory in our trials tribulations why do we do that because we know that those things work patience and that patience actually it works experience and we all need experience right you don't want somebody doing it working on your car that's never worked on a car before you want or or or having surgery with somebody that's never done surgery before you want somebody with experience so we all want experience how to handle problems right and a experience hope that gives you when you got experience it gives you hope for the next thing that you have need of amen and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost what a connection there the love of God is shed abroad in our heart by the holy G which is given unto us you know the Bible says in Psalms 16:7 when a man's ways please the Lord he'll make even thy enemies to be at peace with thee it kind of sounds to me that God is able to make all grace abound to us amen a lot of times we have a problem with somebody you know what we do we always blame the other person oh what they they they they they it's never I've never heard one person say I feel that maybe I did something that wasn't pleasing to the Lord I'm so glad that I have a word that can open my eyes can be a light to my path to show me what the truth of the situation the whole world is full of Courts and and lawyers and and judges and fightings trying to prove who's right when when a man's ways please the Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him wow how many want that well we have the antidote we know what to do so if we want more grace we need to be more humble and please the Lord and if you want more humility we simply need to fear the lord more the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom the fear of the Lord is what brings more grace in our life Isaiah 66 ver1 I need to go maybe uh skip of over a few of these things as we're closing this morning I won't be ministering for quite a while so got to get L right Isaiah 66 how many is how many is actually this this message is helping you that's what really really really matters Isaiah 66 61 says thus sayith the Lord the heaven is my throne and the Earth is my foot stool where's the house you're going to build me and where is the place of my rest for all those things have my hands already made and all those things have been sayeth the Lord so so if you're going to get my attention but to this man will I look this this this is going to draw my attention away from what's in in my life even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word amen amen this is a spirit and an attitude I don't know how many times I have seen people come into the church they're not fearing the word their their mind is on other things but yet they want some sort of help they want God to look on them in a favorable way if we want God's favor then we've got to tremble at his word amen and there's a lot here to tremble at we can be we can tremble at one thing but there's many things that we maybe get a little hay at oh I don't need to do that God sees my heart look if you if if you want God's attention then you got to do what God wants his word is so much more important than whatever we got going anyways if the Bible says forsake not the assment of ourselves together we need to tremble at that scripture tremble at it if the prophet brought the mind of God and how to have church order then we got to tremble at that if Jesus said man shall live by every word of God we need to tremble at that the if Jesus said judge not that we be not judged then we tremble not well I got that covered tremble amen and now you don't have to tremble you you you kids you adults you don't have to tremble but if you want God to look upon you favorably he told us what to do is it it's a choice brother brandom chose the harder way amen he sold the seed that brought forth a huge part of Heaven that awaits him wow that's the CP of seed I want to I want a soul if Jesus said if you if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive you your trespasses we should tremble at that amen the key is learning to tremble at the word of God get contrite in your spirit get humble in your spirit get Meek in your spirit did not Jesus said learn of me for I'm Meek and lonely why why wouldn't his people be the same way if Jesus is Meek why wouldn't we be meek a lot of times human would just pout be stand offish or get attitudes and and and they they like like you're trying to get attention yeah you you guys can relate to this we all can yet you ever not get what you want from somebody and you just give him the cold shoulder do a little pouting get standoffish and why are you doing that you're doing that for one reason to get their attention I'm going to let them know that don't get God's attention that gets the devil's attention you want God's attention it's just the opposite you humble yourself you say Lord you're right I'm wrong your way not my way amen God is able to make all grace abound all grace abound we just got to open up the door purpose in your heart to so the word of God bountifully in your life amen I want you to start make it make it make a commitment tonight today I'm going to go home and I'm going to start practicing this in my home amen and there's a lot to practice because we're we're we're so many things that we're doing so many interactions with our families just make the commitment I'm going to humble myself I'm going to repent for my rebellious Spirit my lawlessness Spirit my laxidasical Spirit my uncaring spirit my arrogant Spirit my proud Spirit see I don't know what spirits that you deal with but I'm pretty sure that we've battled some of these don't you think amen I'm going to start fearing what the Bible says I'm going to become more faithful I'm going to become more obedient I'm going to do what God is calling me to do because I believe that God has truly predestinated me to be come in His image amen I'm going to become in the I I'm committed to the character of God I'm I'm committed to the nature of God and I I'm going to I'm going to come forward in in in church with a better attitude than I've ever had before amen amen you just start with that and you'll see God will begin to bless you you take one step forward to God God takes one towards you draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you John 15 six and I we're we're just we're wrapping it up here we're wrapping it up in the next 3 hours I'm telling you we're doing it John Jesus said in John 15:6 if a man abide in me oh I'm sorry if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and withered and Men gather them and cast them in the fire and they are burned so in other words God is able to not make grace abound to them but if he but if you abide in me and my words abide in you then you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you right there God is able to make all grace abound to you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples amen let's Stand Together God bless you God is able to make all grace abound toward you toward you that he always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work our God is able to make whatever need we would have he's able to take care of that need amen let's sing that little chorus it is no secret what he's done for others he'll do for us it is no secret what God can do what is done for other he'll do for you With Arms Wide Open he Parton you it is no [Music] secret what God can do it is no secret what God can do what he's done for other he do for you with THS wide open H Parton you what he's done for us can do one more time it is no secret but [Music] God

existed before and I'll just say like this even if you were like Goliath like the Lion's Den like the fiery furnace God is still able to make all grace abound to you if you've got faith to step out
