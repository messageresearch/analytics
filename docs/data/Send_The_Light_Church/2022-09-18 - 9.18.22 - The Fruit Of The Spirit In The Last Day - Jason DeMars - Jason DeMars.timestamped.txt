[15:27] just cast it out
[15:29] amen hallelujah I just like to change
[15:32] your order of service amen
[15:34] Hallelujah just got a couple
[15:36] announcements there's some leftover
[15:38] Refreshments from yesterday so uh after
[15:42] service just feel free to
[15:44] gobble them up get rid of them
[15:47] you got a lot of kids here I'm sure they
[15:49] 'll like to do that amen hallelujah amen
[15:53] also um let me change a little up a
[15:56] little bit we have a testimony brother
[15:59] uh Jonathan you want to give that
[16:11] but obviously last night my back was
[16:14] out and uh yeah
[16:18] a lot of you know that I you know had
[16:21] surgery and everything and broke my back
[16:22] but every now and again discs pop out
[16:25] well typically in the past when they go
[16:27] out it's weeks and weeks and weeks
[16:30] everybody the the men last night prayed
[16:32] for me I'm very tender but it's back in
[16:35] place and I praise God for that
[16:37] the other testimony that I originally
[16:40] wanted to share this morning was um I
[16:42] know that we all go out and witness for
[16:44] lost souls and talk to people and and
[16:47] whatnot one thing the Lord has revealed
[16:50] to me
[16:51] um he did this years ago and he brought
[16:54] it back to my attention
[16:55] if we don't seek Him First in prayer and
[16:58] we just go out witnessing to everybody
[17:01] After Time a lot of times we get
[17:02] defeated
[17:03] because we're not seeing those Souls
[17:06] come to Christ
[17:07] because the spirit of the Lord isn't
[17:09] calling that person
[17:11] as our word says unless the spirit of
[17:13] the Lord is drawing someone near to him
[17:16] we're wasting our time and our breath
[17:19] start praying God bring those that are
[17:22] right for the Harvest to me
[17:24] put me in front of those that that are
[17:26] ready for you that need you
[17:28] and then fill my mouth with the things
[17:30] to say to them
[17:32] and as you all know what my family has
[17:34] brought multiple people in lately I've
[17:37] been praying for Justin for a lot of
[17:39] years he's he's my my cousin but I'm
[17:41] like his uncle
[17:43] and I love that man and I'm so excited
[17:47] for what God is doing in his life in a
[17:49] matter of such a short time
[17:52] I look forward to seeing the future but
[17:55] come on
[17:56] [Applause]
[18:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[18:03] you know we can
[18:05] we need to believe past the point of
[18:08] well this is just one occurrence
[18:11] God is a present God
[18:14] he wants to do things in our life
[18:17] we just
[18:18] as
[18:19] you know I was talking to or Cheyenne
[18:22] was talking to me I was just talking to
[18:24] her about hope hope won't do it needs to
[18:27] move on to faith
[18:30] and
[18:33] that's what we need to do
[18:35] it's not just
[18:37] see the people sitting in the seats see
[18:39] the soul saved
[18:41] got to work on that
[18:43] amen
[18:45] so let's just remember that amen
[18:47] Hallelujah we also have one other
[18:50] announcement uh ladies T group uh
[18:53] Saturday the 24th at 3 30. uh please see
[18:57] the board amen for further instructions
[18:59] on that
[19:00] also we have two baptisms after service
[19:03] uh Justin and Cheyenne and the Lord
[19:06] witches prepare their hearts I just want
[19:09] to put that up before the prayer
[19:11] requests so that we can just pray for
[19:13] them during this our request amen let's
[19:17] also remember Gabriel her grandfather
[19:20] CJ's Health needs especially her his
[19:23] bladder and Elizabeth
[19:26] a miracle Ron Husker a miracle Bob Cobra
[19:31] another miracle there's a lot of
[19:33] Miracles needed we've seen that they can
[19:36] happen so let's just believe not open
[19:39] but believing for it also our sister

[32:01] we could be set free he paid the price
[32:04] to deliver us
[32:06] from the grips of the enemy amen
[32:09] let's pray

[33:02] I pray you'd use this service
[33:05] for a portion of that purpose Lord we're
[33:08] living in an hour
[33:10] we call the end time
[33:12] and it's so late it's the end of the end
[33:16] time

[33:22] in your bride Lord to build us to the
[33:25] perfecting of the Saints to the maturing
[33:29] of the word
[33:30] Lord I pray that you would further that
[33:33] today
[33:34] some people are just beginning that
[33:36] Journey Lord but entering in to the
[33:39] spirit of the Lord it will take them and
[33:41] carry them to maturity in their life
[33:44] to be ready for a rapture
[33:47] Lord we ask
[33:49] Lord for your mercy Upon Us Lord
[33:53] would you come and you would you take
[33:55] the word
[33:56] and make it life to us Lord ours
[34:00] so many promises in your word when
[34:04] we are weak
[34:06] then we are strong as that's that's
[34:09] that's the scripture that's what Paul
[34:13] wrote that's what he experienced and
[34:15] what he wrote Lord
[34:17] when we are weak then we're strong
[34:19] because it's your power yes
[34:21] manifested through US Lord and so I I
[34:25] come
[34:26] for myself and for each one here
[34:29] but Lord confessing and understanding
[34:31] that there is
[34:32] there is no power or goodness in me
[34:37] Lord that can help this people but it's
[34:40] in you Lord and we want to surrender and
[34:42] submit our hearts and lives to you and
[34:45] ask that you would speak the truth over
[34:48] the people Lord and help them in their
[34:51] walk we ask these things in the precious
[34:53] name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[34:55] amen amen amen
[34:58] but we had a wonderful time last night
[35:02] I appreciate all of you
[35:04] appreciate brother John thank you for
[35:06] the opportunity here to speak to the
[35:08] people and it's a great blessing to me
[35:10] and a privilege and an honor
[35:12] and we thank the Lord for what he's
[35:13] doing in this part of Michigan amen and
[35:17] how he's using you here and to bless
[35:19] people on the missions field around the
[35:22] world you're you all are a great
[35:23] blessing and uh let's continue go on our
[35:27] subject we're going to be speaking on
[35:29] the Fruit of the Spirit
[35:30] in the last days
[35:33] I'm basing it on a quote that brother
[35:35] Branham had he talked about the fruit of
[35:37] the spirit ripening in the bride tree
[35:41] and that's the hour
[35:43] that's the hour we're living in so amen
[35:48] a Galatians chapter 5 we're going to
[35:50] look at and I'm just going to read
[35:52] verses 22
[35:54] and 23 and then
[35:58] um I'll have you take your seats and
[36:00] then we'll expound on this this chapter
[36:02] a little bit
[36:04] but the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[36:08] peace long-suffering gentleness goodness
[36:11] Faith meekness Temperance against such
[36:15] there is no law
[36:18] and they that are Christ have crucified
[36:20] the flesh with the affections and lusts
[36:24] if we live in the spirit let us also
[36:27] walk in the spirit may the Lord add the
[36:30] blessing to the reading of his word he
[36:32] could be seated
[36:35] so turn back there to
[36:39] verse 16.
[36:41] we're going to get more of the context
[36:45] this I say then walk in the spirit
[36:49] and you shall not fulfill the lusts of
[36:52] the flesh so
[36:54] looking at the greater context Paul is
[36:56] seeking to get the Galatians away from
[36:59] looking to outward obedience
[37:02] for their leadership and salvation the
[37:06] Galatians receive the message
[37:08] of Paul
[37:10] they they received it and Paul details
[37:13] to them do you receive the spirit
[37:16] by The Works of the law or did you
[37:18] receive it by the hearing of faith
[37:21] and of course the answer is obvious
[37:25] by the hearing of Faith that's how they
[37:27] received it the Gentiles while they
[37:30] heard the word the spirit fell upon them
[37:33] and they received it the same way they
[37:35] did on the day of Pentecost
[37:37] and so they heard it they heard the word
[37:40] it was mixed with faith God opened their
[37:43] hearts and the spirit fell amen and so
[37:47] Paul is trying to remind them do you
[37:49] remember what God did in your life the
[37:51] experience you had it wasn't because you
[37:54] were obeying the law of Moses God chose
[37:58] to save you apart from that
[38:01] then Paul left said they said Elders in
[38:04] the church Paul went away and what
[38:06] happened the
[38:09] judaizers come that's what we call them
[38:11] people from Jerusalem came and said wait
[38:14] wait wait wait you're mixed up
[38:17] you can't be saved
[38:19] by going directly to the gospel first
[38:22] you have to be a part of the Covenant
[38:24] the old Covenant you have to be a part
[38:27] of Moses law
[38:29] first you have to enter into a relate
[38:31] become a Jew
[38:33] is basically what it's saying you have
[38:36] to convert to Judaism outwardly
[38:38] physically then you can receive
[38:42] the Holy Spirit and be a part of the New
[38:45] Covenant but apart from the being in the
[38:48] old Covenant you can't enter the New
[38:50] Covenant and so Paul is is start is is
[38:53] showing them that's an error
[38:56] that's false teaching
[38:58] that you've turned away from the
[39:00] Simplicity of the Gospel into the law
[39:05] and you don't even you and those Jews
[39:07] that came to you don't even understand
[39:09] the purpose of the law
[39:13] if you walk in the spirit you're not
[39:15] going to execute or perform the works of
[39:18] the flesh it's not if you it's not if
[39:21] you obey the law
[39:24] then you won't fulfill the lust of the
[39:27] flesh no
[39:28] that's a false understanding you your
[39:31] nature
[39:32] is Fallen it's sinful you cannot please
[39:36] God In the Flesh
[39:39] that's what the law teaches us Allah is
[39:41] a Schoolmaster to lead us to Christ
[39:44] it's to point out our weakness our
[39:48] sinfulness our need for salvation and
[39:51] for our savior
[39:52] and so
[39:54] if you walk in the spirit you won't
[39:56] fulfill the lust of the flesh you won't
[39:57] execute or perform those works of the
[40:01] Fallen nature
[40:03] so that's the that he's saying there
[40:06] this is the key to obedience not the law
[40:10] the key to obedience is the Holy Spirit
[40:13] In You
[40:15] producing The Works of the law
[40:19] in the sermon is your life was worthy of
[40:21] the Gospel brother Branham says when
[40:23] this takes place the thing you'll do
[40:25] then you'll find out that the spirit
[40:27] that comes into you
[40:29] from the New Birth you will believe
[40:32] and do everything that God says in his
[40:35] word for you to do
[40:37] and everything that the Bible quotes for
[40:39] you to do you'll punctuate it with an
[40:40] amen and you'll not stop day and night
[40:42] until you receive it that's right that's
[40:45] right
[40:46] and in all this time you'll certainly
[40:48] above everything bear the Fruit of the
[40:51] Spirit
[40:53] beautiful quote
[40:55] Galatians 5 17 for the lust for the
[40:59] flesh
[41:00] lusts or sets its heart
[41:03] against the spirit
[41:06] and the spirit against the flesh so the
[41:08] the spirit of God
[41:10] sets its heart against the Flesh and the
[41:14] flesh sets its heart against the spirit
[41:17] amen and this is speaking of someone
[41:19] who's born again
[41:20] otherwise you don't have you don't have
[41:23] a person who's living in their fallen
[41:26] nature having their human Spirit lusting
[41:29] against the flesh they're in agreement
[41:30] together against the word against God
[41:34] so here we have a born-again person
[41:36] their flesh
[41:39] is working against the spirit so of
[41:43] course we understand it's not just
[41:44] merely flesh but it's the nature we have
[41:47] two Natures within us
[41:49] fighting against each other the nature
[41:52] which Paul calls the flesh the sinful
[41:56] nature versus the nature of the holy
[41:59] spirit so there's a war going on the
[42:02] spirit battles against the sinful nature
[42:05] the sinful nature is battling against
[42:07] the spirit you can't do that without
[42:09] being born again
[42:11] so what is he saying there is a war
[42:13] going on inside of you
[42:16] to manifest
[42:18] what the the works of the spirit
[42:22] and says they're con these are contrary
[42:24] to what one to the other
[42:26] so that you cannot do the things that
[42:30] you would so you so this is mindful of
[42:33] Romans chapter 7.
[42:36] you
[42:37] they're contrary to another one another
[42:39] the things that you desire are Desiring
[42:42] to do which is that's your desire he
[42:45] changes your desire right when you get
[42:48] the holy spirit that changes your desire
[42:50] that doesn't get rid of the sinful
[42:51] nature sinful nature is there but now
[42:55] you have power to defeat it
[42:57] when you first get saved what what
[43:00] happens
[43:01] a process starts when I got saved
[43:05] I was not immediately a mature Christian
[43:08] I was a baby
[43:10] I had a lot of problems I had a lot of
[43:13] things in my life that weren't right I
[43:15] smoked marijuana the Lord delivered me
[43:17] from that right away
[43:19] I was I was never addicted to it so I
[43:21] never I I could just stop it drinking
[43:25] alcohol getting drunk I was done with
[43:27] that
[43:28] swearing it was a habit
[43:32] and sometimes it came out and oh my what
[43:34] am I doing
[43:36] um
[43:37] listening to to I loved rap music
[43:41] I I built myself on rap music
[43:44] for years and years and it was it was
[43:48] difficult to let go of it I immediately
[43:50] threw it all away and then shortly
[43:52] thereafter I went and bought some more
[43:55] and I remember I asked my mom
[43:59] I don't know what's going on I I need to
[44:02] get rid of this rap music and all these
[44:03] movies that I'm watching
[44:05] she said well have you asked the Lord to
[44:07] take the desire for it away
[44:10] I said well yeah I have but honestly I
[44:12] do like it still I do will ask him to
[44:15] make you not like it anymore
[44:17] okay all right so then I approached the
[44:20] Lord that way and the Lord took that
[44:22] desire away now there was a war going on
[44:25] because I had a intense passion and
[44:28] desire for the word of God
[44:31] I mean I was feeding on it feasting on
[44:33] it and then listening to rap music and
[44:35] then watching Rated R movies what am I
[44:38] doing and then after I'm done I'm
[44:40] convicted that's the work of the spirit
[44:42] of the Lord
[44:43] you you know if if you grow up in the
[44:46] message you probably don't have as bad a
[44:47] problems as I had
[44:49] but you also might have as bad problems
[44:51] that I had but when you're a babe in
[44:53] Christ you you deal with those things
[44:55] that's what sanctification is that's for
[44:59] that's what being transfer being
[45:01] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[45:04] is we're going from what we were before
[45:08] you had no power to overcome before you
[45:12] you were dead in sin and trespasses all
[45:14] you could do was sin and trespass
[45:17] now God comes to you he changes your
[45:20] desire now you're Desiring the word
[45:23] but there's habits and there's things in
[45:24] your life and the Holy Spirit begins to
[45:27] wash you
[45:28] and it's a process and it's a battle and
[45:31] you have to fight and you'll win because
[45:34] the spirit of God's inside of you
[45:37] and you'll they'll be ups and there'll
[45:39] be Downs
[45:40] and as you get more mature the ups and
[45:42] downs change and the deception of the
[45:45] enemy changes
[45:47] so that's what he's saying you cannot do
[45:49] the things you would my desire was not
[45:52] to go into rap music My Desire was not
[45:54] to swear
[45:56] but I would do that
[45:57] but little by little the spirit of the
[46:00] Lord worked in my life and transformed
[46:01] me now I now I don't swear amen now I
[46:06] don't cuss now I hate rap music
[46:09] now I hate rated R movies but that
[46:12] wasn't so at the beginning
[46:15] but it was a but the desire was to be
[46:17] against it see and so that desire
[46:20] changes but still sometimes you do
[46:23] things that you don't want to do we
[46:25] still do
[46:27] they're maybe not as big of a deal but
[46:29] they're still a big deal Sin is Sin and
[46:32] it's displeasing to the Lord and as a
[46:35] Christian we don't want to do it right
[46:36] that's what Paul is talking about
[46:38] they're there there's a war going on
[46:42] verse 18.
[46:44] but but I like this
[46:47] I'm happy about this but sometimes butt
[46:50] is like I love you but oh don't say that
[46:52] because now you're saying you don't love
[46:54] me
[46:57] uh
[46:58] no that's not what it is this is a good
[47:01] but he's saying I can't do the things
[47:03] that I want to but
[47:05] if you be led of the spirit
[47:08] you're not under the law what is Paul
[47:10] saying
[47:11] being under the law is what condemnation
[47:15] that's the part that these Jewish people
[47:18] and judaizers and the Galatians that
[47:20] were converted
[47:21] isn't this amazing to think brothers and
[47:24] sisters and let's let for a moment give
[47:28] Grace to other people
[47:30] that maybe have gone the wrong way these
[47:32] Galatians received the message from Paul
[47:36] walking in the truth false teachers came
[47:39] and deceived them
[47:41] they're Christians they're born again
[47:43] they got they got went the wrong way
[47:46] they were accepting false teaching and
[47:49] here comes the Apostle around to correct
[47:51] it
[47:52] and I believe they received this
[47:54] correction they received this
[47:55] clarification
[47:57] and
[47:59] they were God's people isn't that
[48:01] marvelous you could see in this day
[48:03] there's people that they might be going
[48:05] the wrong way but God can correct them
[48:07] God can deal with them
[48:10] and we praise the Lord for that we we
[48:12] don't need to write people off Paul
[48:14] didn't write the Galatians off he didn't
[48:16] say we have a book of Galatians because
[48:18] Paul believed that God could correct
[48:20] them yes yes right and so here he is
[48:23] correcting them
[48:25] and we have this letter instructing us
[48:29] because of that
[48:31] but if you're LED of the spirit that's
[48:33] the key
[48:34] in our choices in our decisions and the
[48:37] things that we allow in the ways that we
[48:39] react
[48:41] we have to be led by the spirit in the
[48:42] way that we think as we talked about
[48:44] last night
[48:45] we need to be led by the spirit because
[48:48] in that case when you're it when you're
[48:51] in that condition then you're not under
[48:54] the law
[48:57] under the law I mean is the it's the law
[48:59] of sin and death now the law is Holy
[49:03] the Commandment is Holy why because it's
[49:06] expressing the nature of God
[49:09] but you can't obey the Ten Commandments
[49:12] in your flesh it leads to condemnation
[49:15] but when we have the Holy Spirit it's
[49:17] going to lead you to obedience to the
[49:21] Ten Commandments
[49:22] right so then we're not under bondage
[49:24] anymore because we have the positive
[49:26] side we have the nature of the Ten
[49:29] Commandments of The Giver of the Ten
[49:31] Commandments inside of us leading us to
[49:34] obedience to the word
[49:38] John 16 13 says how be how be it when he
[49:41] the spirit of Truth has come he will
[49:43] guide you into all Truth for he shall
[49:45] not speak of himself but whatsoever he
[49:48] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[49:50] will show you
[49:51] things to come
[49:53] so that's that's the school Master the
[49:56] law that leads us to Christ it's the
[50:00] spirit of Truth
[50:01] guiding us and leading us and teaching
[50:04] us so that's the opposite end of being
[50:07] led you need to be led but you need a
[50:10] guide in order to be led without the
[50:12] guide you're not being led
[50:15] so you have the person being led and the
[50:17] guide that's Christ Christ in you the
[50:21] hope of glory
[50:22] back to Galatians 5 verse 19 now the
[50:25] works of the flesh
[50:26] are manifest
[50:28] which are these adultery
[50:31] fornication
[50:33] uncleanness
[50:34] lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft
[50:38] hatred variance emulations wrath strife
[50:44] seditions
[50:46] heresies envyings murders remember even
[50:51] hating your brother is murder also
[50:53] drunkenness revelings partying
[50:57] and such like of the things of which I
[51:00] tell you before
[51:02] as I have told you in time past that
[51:05] they which do such things shall not
[51:07] inherit the kingdom of God
[51:12] so the these are the works of the Flesh
[51:14] and he says if you're doing these things
[51:16] you're not going to heaven
[51:19] you're not going to the Millennium
[51:20] you're not going to the new Earth
[51:22] the place that people that do these
[51:24] things have is death and hell and the
[51:28] Lake of Fire
[51:30] the Bible says also all liars will find
[51:32] their part in the Lake of Fire
[51:35] that's what the flesh does this is the
[51:38] works of the flesh The Works of the
[51:39] flesh does not produce obedience to the
[51:41] law The Works of the flesh produce
[51:45] death
[51:46] it might look like very religious
[51:50] very religious
[51:52] flesh works but it's still death
[51:56] the Jewish people the Pharisees they
[51:59] could outshine us
[52:00] in many ways
[52:04] but what it that's that's not what it is
[52:06] that's not what God is looking for
[52:07] you're St you can be ever so religious
[52:10] you can follow whatever religion you
[52:13] have Buddhism Judaism Christianity
[52:19] Catholicism any religion and be dead
[52:24] the Bible is not bringing us religion
[52:27] religion is just a covering
[52:30] you're you're covering up something
[52:32] that's broken
[52:33] the gospel is not a covering
[52:37] right it's it's not it's not just
[52:39] covering up a problem
[52:40] it's going to the core of the problem
[52:43] and transforming it
[52:46] and ultimately bringing a total
[52:48] transformation of that body
[52:50] so that that flesh is is swallowed up in
[52:54] life
[52:57] it's it's total Redemption
[52:59] it's Total Transformation
[53:01] it's it's a walk
[53:04] right if we walk in the spirit
[53:07] it's a personal walk
[53:09] and fellowship
[53:11] with God himself
[53:15] and out of that brings comes obedience
[53:19] to the word and so to someone looking
[53:22] from the outside they might not be able
[53:23] to tell the difference I might need not
[53:25] be able to tell the difference a person
[53:27] can be following the message along and
[53:30] obeying the message brother Branham says
[53:31] that's just being capable of reading
[53:35] but we have to have the Holy Spirit
[53:38] revealing the word to us personally
[53:42] in our in our in our closet in our home
[53:45] in our church everywhere
[53:47] but it's it's a one-on-one walk with the
[53:50] Lord
[53:51] now
[53:53] this is a whole other topic but in today
[53:56] the gospel that's presented to people is
[53:59] a warm and fuzzy relationship with Jesus
[54:04] right
[54:05] so you look at that what's the what's
[54:07] the what's wrong with that well Jesus
[54:09] comes to make me feel fulfilled
[54:13] in my personal life
[54:15] makes makes me come to make me feel
[54:18] comfortable happy at rest the problem is
[54:22] it's not the Jesus of the Bible that's
[54:25] being presented it's another Jesus
[54:28] and that's the great danger especially
[54:30] on the TV evangelist the great mega
[54:34] churches they're bringing a spirit of
[54:37] deception
[54:38] I believe that's directly where the
[54:41] Antichrist fourth horse rider is working
[54:44] to deceive the people Jesus says as many
[54:48] as I love I rebuke and chasten
[54:51] be zealous therefore and repent you're
[54:54] not seeing a gospel of repentance
[54:55] brought over the television it's the
[54:58] gospel of you can have your best life
[55:00] now
[55:01] you can be rich if you just give to our
[55:04] church
[55:05] see using a principle of God misusing a
[55:09] principle of God if you just give to our
[55:11] church you'll be wealthy like I am
[55:16] and so this this is the gospel and this
[55:19] is the Jesus that's being presented
[55:22] today and it's it people love it without
[55:26] twenty thousand thirty thousand people
[55:28] show up to Services stadiums go build up
[55:31] why it's encouraging the flesh the
[55:34] fleshly desires
[55:36] it's another Jesus
[55:38] it's a different Jesus than what we find
[55:41] in the Bible
[55:42] and so that's not the Jesus we're
[55:44] presenting we're presenting the Jesus
[55:46] says you're lost you're a sinner you
[55:49] need a savior you need to be changed
[55:52] you can't do it yourself
[55:55] you can't even believe yourself no man
[55:58] can come to Christ unless the father
[56:00] draws him first you you it's not about
[56:04] you choosing it's he says you haven't
[56:07] chosen me I have chosen you and ordained
[56:10] you to bring forth fruit
[56:12] he's calling he's calling people and he
[56:16] says repent turn away from your sinful
[56:18] life
[56:19] turn away from that and you know what
[56:21] there's going to be difficulty why he
[56:24] says take up your cross it doesn't take
[56:27] up take up your pillow
[56:30] take up your Mercedes and follow me
[56:33] take up your cross and follow me the
[56:37] cross was a place of torture death and
[56:40] shame
[56:41] and we as Christians are called to
[56:44] suffer and rejoice
[56:46] we're not called to live
[56:48] an easy life
[56:51] and this this makes clear if you follow
[56:54] the lusts of the flesh you'll die
[56:57] you'll die in your sins and millions are
[57:01] in the church maybe billions in churches
[57:04] and dying in their sins because they
[57:07] haven't heard a gospel of repentance a
[57:11] gospel of the blood of Jesus Christ and
[57:13] the gospel of the sovereignty of God
[57:16] they've heard false teaching false
[57:18] Doctrine and what is it it's another
[57:19] Jesus
[57:21] this is the there's only one Jesus
[57:25] who is Jesus not a not not merely a
[57:28] person that we talk about from history
[57:31] Jesus is the same today he's revealing
[57:35] himself in his word
[57:36] today to and through his people
[57:40] and so
[57:41] the present tense Jesus is what we're
[57:44] talking about
[57:45] the one that came down with an open book
[57:48] to reveal himself in this day Seven
[57:52] Seals you know it's it's a it's
[57:54] astounding what you see and what people
[57:57] will say
[57:58] how necessary is the opening of the word
[58:01] we're talking about the fruit of the
[58:03] spirit in the last days ripening in the
[58:06] bride tree how does that make even any
[58:08] sense to anybody you as message
[58:10] Believers have been around a while it
[58:12] makes perfect sense you understand but
[58:14] if you're new it might not make any
[58:15] sense
[58:16] but there is a opening of the word
[58:18] restoring us back to the original faith
[58:22] not another Jesus the real Jesus on
[58:26] display today
[58:27] restoring us back to the full word of
[58:31] God Amen that's why we need the old
[58:34] Seven Seals that's why we needed the
[58:36] seven Thunders to utter their voices to
[58:37] restore us back to the original faith
[58:41] so that we would have the full word on
[58:44] display it's not a new message it's not
[58:46] a new revelation
[58:48] this became a sealed book and it's still
[58:51] a sealed book to many people in the
[58:53] world
[58:54] but to us it's open Malachi 4 the
[58:58] message of Elijah is open that up so
[59:01] that we can have a maturing of the fruit
[59:04] of the spirit this is not something new
[59:07] this is a finalization of what started
[59:10] in the first church age
[59:12] but as the apostles fell asleep instead
[59:15] of the church growing to maturity they
[59:18] started they went downwards
[59:20] and they descended and they slowly fell
[59:22] away from the faith
[59:25] but then God began to work and through
[59:27] the Reformation in Luther and Wesley and
[59:30] the different reformers to restore the
[59:31] church back to the original faith in the
[59:33] Pentecost the restoration of the gifts
[59:35] but then he sends Elijah to gather these
[59:37] things together and bring an opening of
[59:40] the Seven Seals so that this book is no
[59:42] longer a sealed book but it's an open
[59:44] book and by revelation we have an
[59:47] understanding
[59:48] there and through that brings a maturity
[59:52] of our faith so that the fruit of the
[59:55] spirit can be in maturity in our lives
[59:58] and when we get saved in under this
[1:00:01] message what happens a maturing process
[1:00:05] begins and he's taking us to where the
[1:00:08] early church should have matured to
[1:00:10] amen
[1:00:12] God's working
[1:00:14] God's moving
[1:00:16] it's not by the sight of our eyes but
[1:00:18] it's by faith
[1:00:20] because the word says
[1:00:22] and so
[1:00:24] then we get to the scripture the Fruit
[1:00:26] of the Spirit
[1:00:29] in other words this is the results
[1:00:32] of what the spirit the the life of the
[1:00:36] tree
[1:00:37] produces fruit
[1:00:39] right
[1:00:41] an apple tree produces apples
[1:00:44] so this in other words this this is what
[1:00:47] is produced in the life of someone that
[1:00:51] has the spirit of God in them
[1:00:54] it doesn't produce
[1:00:57] drunkenness murder reveling witchcraft
[1:00:59] idolatry variants emulation draft Strife
[1:01:02] that's not what the Holy Spirit produces
[1:01:04] the Holy Spirit produces love
[1:01:07] Joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[1:01:11] goodness Faith meekness Temperance and
[1:01:15] he says against such there is no law see
[1:01:18] that's the positive side the other thing
[1:01:21] we saw the negative that was there's a
[1:01:23] law against those things
[1:01:24] but there's no there's no Allah against
[1:01:26] love
[1:01:27] God doesn't say hey don't love anybody
[1:01:31] he says love that's the positive side
[1:01:35] Joy this is what the spirit of the Lord
[1:01:37] produces peace
[1:01:39] long-suffering gentleness goodness
[1:01:41] that's what when you have the Holy
[1:01:44] Spirit this is what happens inside of
[1:01:46] you
[1:01:47] of course a person can be loving without
[1:01:50] the Holy Spirit a person can have joy
[1:01:53] without the Holy Spirit person have
[1:01:55] peace person can be patient you know a
[1:01:57] person can have a good positive nature
[1:02:00] they grew up in a good home or they over
[1:02:02] came a lot in their own life and they
[1:02:06] fought to have these things in other
[1:02:08] words there can be a mimic of that there
[1:02:10] can be something that looks exactly like
[1:02:12] the Christian version
[1:02:14] and even sometimes exceeds it
[1:02:17] but that's not that's not the point is
[1:02:20] is that these are the things that the
[1:02:23] holy spirit is going to produce
[1:02:25] inside of your life and and in a growing
[1:02:28] Factor yeah
[1:02:31] in an increasing Factor you know we're
[1:02:34] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[1:02:36] as we feed and feast on the word
[1:02:39] and in prayer the Lord changes us and
[1:02:43] makes us like Jesus Christ
[1:02:46] and these are the things that he
[1:02:48] produces and this is this is what um is
[1:02:51] spoken of in is it second Peter
[1:02:55] um
[1:02:57] the stature of a perfect man
[1:03:10] verse chapter one
[1:03:14] verse
[1:03:15] 5 and beside this
[1:03:17] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:03:21] virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to
[1:03:24] knowledge Temperance and to Temperance
[1:03:25] patience and to patients godliness and
[1:03:28] to Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:03:30] brotherly kindness charity
[1:03:33] for if these things be in you and abound
[1:03:37] they make you that you shall neither be
[1:03:39] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:03:42] of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that
[1:03:45] lacketh these things is blind and cannot
[1:03:49] see afar off and has forgotten that he
[1:03:51] was purged from his old sins wherefore
[1:03:54] the rather Brethren give diligence to
[1:03:56] make your calling
[1:03:58] an election sure for if you do these
[1:04:00] things you shall never
[1:04:02] fail
[1:04:03] so add add ad
[1:04:06] we're supposed to add these things to
[1:04:09] our faith and each of these things are
[1:04:12] are things that if they're in you and
[1:04:15] abound they're overflowing is what what
[1:04:18] Peter is saying if they're in you and
[1:04:20] are overflowing maybe they're not
[1:04:21] overflowing now
[1:04:22] maybe some of them are now overflowing
[1:04:24] in me but they will be because that's
[1:04:27] what the Holy Spirit does in a Believer
[1:04:28] causes these things to abound
[1:04:31] they make you so that you're not barren
[1:04:34] barren means fruitless
[1:04:37] you have you're not producing fruit
[1:04:39] remember Jesus that I've chosen you and
[1:04:42] ordained you to bring forth much fruit
[1:04:47] and it says it's isn't it interesting
[1:04:50] that you shouldn't either be Barren nor
[1:04:52] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:04:54] Jesus Christ so you can have knowledge
[1:04:57] of the Lord Jesus Christ and be Barren
[1:04:59] and unfruitful
[1:05:02] you could have knowledge about God
[1:05:04] without knowing God personally
[1:05:08] you can have knowledge
[1:05:10] regarding the Lord Jesus Christ and that
[1:05:13] would produce barrenness and
[1:05:16] unfruitfulness but then you can have a
[1:05:18] revelation
[1:05:19] of who Jesus Christ is and that's going
[1:05:22] to produce
[1:05:24] his life it's going to be a produce a
[1:05:26] fruitful
[1:05:27] and life-giving
[1:05:29] kind of life that you have
[1:05:33] the holy spirit in US produces the
[1:05:35] positive life
[1:05:37] God hasn't called us to the works of
[1:05:39] darkness
[1:05:41] or just avoid the works of darkness
[1:05:44] but he's called us to manifest his
[1:05:46] nature
[1:05:47] it's it's not he's not calling us to
[1:05:50] have an absence of the negative
[1:05:53] we just want you to not be negative
[1:05:56] could you at least just not be negative
[1:05:59] no that's not what he's calling you to
[1:06:01] he's calling us to the positive to put
[1:06:04] the positive things of the word on
[1:06:07] display in our lives
[1:06:10] in the sermons The Sermon the marriage
[1:06:12] of the Lamb brother Branham says the
[1:06:13] Holy Ghost is meekness
[1:06:15] joy peace long-suffering goodness
[1:06:18] gentleness patience faith
[1:06:20] the Holy Ghost that's the fruit of the
[1:06:22] spirit that the Holy Spirit bears in the
[1:06:24] Church of the Living God
[1:06:26] sweetness and humbleness humility love
[1:06:28] one another long suffering if a brother
[1:06:31] has gone wrong don't just beat him or
[1:06:32] something or another
[1:06:34] go after him and see if you can get him
[1:06:36] back don't wait for the preacher to do
[1:06:37] it you do it somebody else preacher
[1:06:39] can't do it all neither can the deacons
[1:06:41] everybody is a member of this body of
[1:06:44] Christ should go after one another
[1:06:48] and if we got the spirit of Christ in us
[1:06:51] he taught the great parable
[1:06:53] they left the 90 and 9 and went after
[1:06:55] that one that's what we're supposed to
[1:06:57] do but we say oh let him go
[1:06:59] we never should do that
[1:07:02] we should be gentle forgiving long
[1:07:04] suffering that's the Fruit of the Spirit
[1:07:09] now
[1:07:11] he didn't say we should be compromising
[1:07:14] we should be so loving that we never
[1:07:16] confront anybody over anything no
[1:07:19] that's the whole point is you are doing
[1:07:21] that
[1:07:22] right your love is so strong that you're
[1:07:24] going after brother well you went wrong
[1:07:26] what happened
[1:07:27] that's he's not saying oh yeah I know
[1:07:30] you're doing wrong let's go up to the
[1:07:31] bar together
[1:07:32] that's not what's being that's not
[1:07:34] what's being spoken
[1:07:35] the the brother or the sister has fallen
[1:07:38] made a terrible mistake and you go to
[1:07:40] them and say we love you what happened
[1:07:43] how can I help you
[1:07:44] that's the whole that's the whole point
[1:07:46] that the prophet's trying to make
[1:07:49] Galatians 5 24.
[1:07:52] and they that are Christ have crucified
[1:07:55] the flesh with the affections and lusts
[1:08:00] amen
[1:08:01] brother Branham uh in one place he says
[1:08:03] we don't need
[1:08:05] a Revival we need we need a death
[1:08:10] we need a dying out
[1:08:14] amen
[1:08:15] if you belong to Christ
[1:08:19] if he's purchased you
[1:08:21] if he saved you
[1:08:23] you've crucified the flesh
[1:08:26] that's a harsh statement you've tortured
[1:08:30] you've strangled holded the life out of
[1:08:34] the flesh
[1:08:36] you and you got Paul says I Die daily
[1:08:41] and so that that's a great need of a
[1:08:43] Christian you're dying out
[1:08:45] on a daily basis
[1:08:47] to the flesh with its affections it's
[1:08:50] its desires its passions and
[1:08:53] its lusts that which the flesh has its
[1:08:57] heart set upon and its desires set upon
[1:09:00] you put it to death
[1:09:02] you crucify that
[1:09:04] a real Christian will do that because if
[1:09:07] because he says if you belong to Christ
[1:09:10] they that are Christ
[1:09:12] have
[1:09:13] crucified the flesh not might
[1:09:16] not could maybe someday
[1:09:19] they do it
[1:09:21] they do it this that's the kind of life
[1:09:24] that Christ produce in US is a person
[1:09:27] that puts his flesh to death
[1:09:31] you don't have to you don't in your own
[1:09:33] power put your flesh to death what
[1:09:35] you're doing is you're surrendering
[1:09:37] yourself to what the holy spirit is
[1:09:39] doing within you
[1:09:42] sometimes we don't know what he's doing
[1:09:45] some like we said last night sometimes
[1:09:48] we don't have the answer Elijah had a
[1:09:50] great experience Mountaintop Mount
[1:09:53] Carmel
[1:09:54] spirit of God made visible manifested
[1:09:58] vindicating proving his ministry then he
[1:10:01] went and met a messenger of Jezebel and
[1:10:03] it caused him to run away
[1:10:04] that was that was the wrong thinking
[1:10:07] he didn't wait on the Lord for that
[1:10:10] he just ran
[1:10:11] and that's the same thing that us
[1:10:13] sometimes we don't know God didn't show
[1:10:14] Elijah what to do
[1:10:16] but there's a principle
[1:10:18] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:10:20] their strength
[1:10:22] you're going to find as you grow in your
[1:10:24] Christian walk and he's going along into
[1:10:26] your Christian walk much of what you do
[1:10:28] is waiting on the Lord
[1:10:33] and a young young people learn to wait
[1:10:36] on the Lord don't run ahead don't try to
[1:10:39] find your own way
[1:10:42] don't try to figure it out on your own
[1:10:43] that's your yeah that's your biggest air
[1:10:46] that's all of our biggest errors
[1:10:48] that we make is figuring it out on our
[1:10:51] own
[1:10:51] it's waiting on the Lord
[1:10:54] even someone even someone that has a
[1:10:56] calling on their life
[1:10:58] that the Lord has spoken to and said
[1:11:00] you're to do this
[1:11:02] to me I've I've found that myself is I
[1:11:05] have to wait on the Lord so much more
[1:11:07] than now than before
[1:11:09] when I was just ministering in my local
[1:11:11] church and working at Wells Fargo
[1:11:15] I just had to wait on the pastor to ask
[1:11:17] me to preach that's my that was my
[1:11:18] waiting on the Lord
[1:11:20] but now with with the ministry the
[1:11:22] Lord's called me to my goodness I feel
[1:11:24] like that's all I'm doing is wait
[1:11:26] so the Lord spoken this thing to me okay
[1:11:29] I know I can't just rush into it
[1:11:32] I have to wait he has to bring it
[1:11:34] together he has to bring it to pass and
[1:11:35] we have to remember that's the same
[1:11:36] thing in our all of our Lives personally
[1:11:39] God has to move something
[1:11:42] it's just like you read about brother
[1:11:43] Branham and his visions he couldn't go
[1:11:46] the Hat was supposed to be here this
[1:11:47] person had to be here this one had to be
[1:11:49] wearing this shirt he couldn't just make
[1:11:51] it come to pass he'd make it worse
[1:11:53] that's a perfect illustration
[1:11:56] for our own lives is when we try to make
[1:11:58] things come to pass we're going to make
[1:12:00] it worse
[1:12:01] you just have to wait
[1:12:03] what are we going to do now we're going
[1:12:05] to wait on the Lord
[1:12:07] that's that's much of the Christian Life
[1:12:10] and it that takes a lot of crucifixion
[1:12:14] yes
[1:12:14] that takes a lot of dying out
[1:12:18] to what we want what we desire
[1:12:21] verse 25 if
[1:12:23] if
[1:12:25] Paul why why do you say if
[1:12:30] it's because on a daily basis
[1:12:33] we have a choice to make now don't take
[1:12:37] that into false teaching understand that
[1:12:40] it's God
[1:12:42] working in you both to Will and to do of
[1:12:44] his good pleasure but the verse right
[1:12:47] before that says work out your own
[1:12:49] salvation with fear and trembling
[1:12:52] because it's God working in you both to
[1:12:55] Will and to do of his good pleasure I
[1:12:57] think that's what Paul is getting at
[1:12:59] right here is
[1:13:00] if we live in the spirit work out your
[1:13:03] salvation
[1:13:05] with fear and trembling because God's
[1:13:06] working in you
[1:13:08] or we can flip it around and say if God
[1:13:10] is in you you will
[1:13:12] work out your salvation with fear and
[1:13:14] trembling
[1:13:15] but it is a daily choice to die we can
[1:13:19] choose
[1:13:21] to engage in things that
[1:13:25] feed the flesh
[1:13:28] you know movies television sports we
[1:13:32] could spend all our time feeding on that
[1:13:36] I don't I don't I don't say I don't go
[1:13:38] to the try I'm not asking you to go to
[1:13:40] the extreme
[1:13:42] um I understand that there's people and
[1:13:44] they let me they might like football
[1:13:45] they might like this thing but don't put
[1:13:47] those things first in your life
[1:13:51] I enjoy football but I watch it on
[1:13:53] Monday
[1:13:55] not on Sunday
[1:13:57] I don't miss church I don't I don't
[1:14:00] I don't ordain my life around the
[1:14:02] Minnesota Vikings
[1:14:05] and I sure hope you don't ordain your
[1:14:07] life around the Detroit Lions sorry
[1:14:12] little NFC North teasing
[1:14:16] but um
[1:14:18] we we understand we we have these things
[1:14:21] and we have little things that we do in
[1:14:23] our lives that help us to relax or enjoy
[1:14:26] something that's okay
[1:14:28] but if we start to order our lives
[1:14:32] around these things entertainments and
[1:14:35] that oh my you're feeding your flesh
[1:14:38] and you're not walking in the spirit you
[1:14:40] know we we have ups and downs as
[1:14:42] Christians we have time I had times I
[1:14:45] was backslid you know you can backslide
[1:14:48] your faith can grow weak your heart can
[1:14:50] grow weak you can get in the in the
[1:14:52] position where your desire for God is so
[1:14:55] small
[1:14:56] but then God comes and like we talked
[1:14:59] about last night he will lay his hand
[1:15:01] heavy upon you
[1:15:03] and you won't enjoy it at all
[1:15:07] right and the next thing you know you're
[1:15:09] on your knees Weeping at the altar
[1:15:11] praying through and you're you're going
[1:15:15] back to your first love
[1:15:16] so if we live in the spirit let us also
[1:15:19] walk in the spirit
[1:15:20] our our
[1:15:22] wherever Our Hearts Passion goes
[1:15:26] that's what the kind of Life we'll Live
[1:15:28] so if our heart's passion is for God
[1:15:31] then that's the kind of life that we're
[1:15:33] going to live but if our heart's passion
[1:15:34] is for football or Netflix or uh
[1:15:39] whatever you streaming service you
[1:15:40] choose that's your heart's desire you're
[1:15:43] going to start living that kind of life
[1:15:46] and it's not going to be the Life of
[1:15:48] Christ certainly
[1:15:54] so
[1:15:56] in the sermon
[1:15:57] turn on the light of a lengthy
[1:16:02] quote here he says think the people can
[1:16:05] go
[1:16:06] right on preaching the equipment
[1:16:08] ecumenical council can join up with the
[1:16:11] Catholic church just as they promised to
[1:16:13] do all organizations can come on
[1:16:15] that but the mark of the beast is
[1:16:17] already there they take it in that and
[1:16:19] they say oh Hallelujah bless God there
[1:16:20] are so many got saved last night they
[1:16:22] did
[1:16:23] they dance in the spirit they spoke in
[1:16:25] tongues that don't mean one thing see oh
[1:16:28] they're Meek and gentle and humble yes
[1:16:30] sir they got the fruit of the spirit
[1:16:31] that's no sign not a bit let me give you
[1:16:34] the fruit of the spirit between Jesus
[1:16:36] and the Pharisees
[1:16:38] see which one had the fruit of the
[1:16:40] spirit see what if I stood now it sounds
[1:16:43] like I'm going against everything that
[1:16:45] I've been teaching but I want this to be
[1:16:47] balanced in the word
[1:16:50] let me give you the fruit of the spirit
[1:16:51] between Jesus and the Pharisees see
[1:16:53] which one had the fruit of the spirit
[1:16:54] what if I stood
[1:16:56] as I started to say a while ago against
[1:16:58] Christ now for a minute God forbid
[1:17:00] forgive me for even saying it see but
[1:17:02] just to show you something
[1:17:04] what if I come to you and say say you
[1:17:06] congregation who's your friend who shows
[1:17:08] the fruit of the spirit your kind old
[1:17:10] priest who comes to you in the hospital
[1:17:12] when you're sick sick your gentle old
[1:17:14] priest that's right who is it that
[1:17:16] always loans you some money when you're
[1:17:18] up against it in a tight place you
[1:17:20] members of his congregation don't you go
[1:17:22] to your kind old priest and he loans you
[1:17:23] money see
[1:17:24] who is it that's always loving and kind
[1:17:27] and showing the fruit of the spirit your
[1:17:29] kind old priest
[1:17:30] who is it that studied for years and
[1:17:33] years in the synagogue down there where
[1:17:35] his great great great great great great
[1:17:36] grandfather come from all the way down
[1:17:38] who is it that studied and worked hard
[1:17:41] and got doctor's degrees and phds and
[1:17:44] llds to know his word to know this word
[1:17:46] and stand here and deliver it to you
[1:17:48] every Sunday morning in his congregation
[1:17:50] your kind old priest
[1:17:53] who's this Renegade called Jesus what
[1:17:56] school did he come from what school is
[1:17:58] he out of
[1:18:00] where's his Fellowship card what
[1:18:01] organization does he belong to
[1:18:04] what does he do when you you all have a
[1:18:06] family argument
[1:18:08] who comes to you your kind old priest
[1:18:10] and you have an argument against the
[1:18:11] neighbor over here your kind old priest
[1:18:13] helps helps you make up
[1:18:16] said you all are children of God you
[1:18:18] shouldn't do that see
[1:18:20] what's this Jesus as of Nazareth doing
[1:18:23] he tears the thing up what does he do he
[1:18:26] lambasts your organization what does he
[1:18:28] do called your priest a blind leader of
[1:18:31] the blind he called him a snake in the
[1:18:32] grass
[1:18:34] he took the sacrifice that God ordained
[1:18:36] and kicked the tables over and throwed
[1:18:38] the money out and looked upon them with
[1:18:40] anger did you ever see a priest look
[1:18:42] like that
[1:18:43] now where is your fruit of the spirit
[1:18:46] mm-hmm
[1:18:48] not by speaking in tongues not by
[1:18:51] dancing in the spirit not by joining
[1:18:53] church not by fruit of the spirit
[1:18:56] Christian Science can outsmother any of
[1:18:58] you on that sea and deny even Jesus
[1:19:00] Christ was divine not that
[1:19:02] but it's the word living there it is if
[1:19:05] they'd only looked he was Messiah he was
[1:19:08] the Living Word made manifest
[1:19:10] and a man that's got the spirit of God
[1:19:12] in him or a woman lives that word lives
[1:19:16] right out in them that's the heartbeat
[1:19:18] the predestinated for the word of the
[1:19:20] Lord comes to them
[1:19:23] and they are the word to the people
[1:19:24] written Epistles red of all men is that
[1:19:27] right
[1:19:28] could the third poll be on
[1:19:30] you can't judge by speaking in tongues
[1:19:32] neither can you judge by the fruit of
[1:19:33] the spirit but it's a manifestation of
[1:19:36] the word of God brought to light it's
[1:19:39] the light that does it
[1:19:40] the man that walks in that light Jesus
[1:19:43] Christ was not founding upon speaking in
[1:19:45] tongues though he did it he was not the
[1:19:48] fruit of the spirit though he did you
[1:19:50] couldn't judge it but he believed and
[1:19:52] punctuated it and God lived every word
[1:19:54] of the promise of that day through him
[1:19:57] that's the light of the hour that's the
[1:19:59] evidence
[1:20:00] when he tells me that the Holy Ghost
[1:20:02] falling in them will deny the word of
[1:20:03] God being so there is something wrong
[1:20:06] with it
[1:20:09] now a person could take that quote and
[1:20:12] say
[1:20:13] well everywhere I go I just find their
[1:20:16] what they do wrong
[1:20:18] and I condemn them for it I've seen
[1:20:20] people come through to churches
[1:20:24] to our church and that's all they did
[1:20:26] and they they they they use this misuse
[1:20:29] this quote and abuse this quote
[1:20:33] to use the word of God as a hammer to
[1:20:36] beat people over the head with it
[1:20:39] and every every little thing they didn't
[1:20:41] like
[1:20:43] they would stand up in the church and
[1:20:45] blast it
[1:20:46] and and I've I've seen that people take
[1:20:48] that Unbound imbalanced approach
[1:20:51] that's that's not what this quote is
[1:20:54] saying this is the quote is not saying
[1:20:56] just act like a jerk to everybody and
[1:20:59] believe the word
[1:21:02] what is it what is it saying there it's
[1:21:04] saying you're judging Christians you're
[1:21:07] judging merely on the outside and I you
[1:21:11] hear it when you witness the message to
[1:21:13] people all the time how can that be true
[1:21:17] when I know for a fact this person is a
[1:21:21] good person this pastor is a good person
[1:21:24] hey
[1:21:26] I wasn't talking about that Pastor I was
[1:21:28] talking about the Bible the truth of the
[1:21:31] Bible
[1:21:32] but my pastor is such a nice man my
[1:21:35] parents are good people and and I know
[1:21:38] these people they're really good
[1:21:41] the Bible says Acts 2 38 the Bible
[1:21:45] speaks about serpent seed the Bible
[1:21:47] speaks never talks about a trinity
[1:21:50] but my pastor is a good man
[1:21:54] so that's your answer
[1:21:56] to the Bible truth you're not
[1:21:58] punctuating the word with the name men
[1:22:00] regardless of what you see around you
[1:22:03] that's not what it's about
[1:22:05] and brother Brad I'm saying that's not
[1:22:07] the evidence being good people
[1:22:09] being a kind old priest speaking in
[1:22:12] tongues dancing in the spirit wonderful
[1:22:14] we want that we want the experiences all
[1:22:17] the experience of the lord we want to be
[1:22:19] good people but that yet that's not it
[1:22:21] it's receiving the full word yes
[1:22:25] for your age for your day and then
[1:22:28] seeing that live out through you so when
[1:22:32] that word comes in you
[1:22:34] it will produce the fruit of the spirit
[1:22:36] amen it will produce and will manifest
[1:22:38] the gifts of the Spirit
[1:22:40] it it will show forth a living God a
[1:22:45] resurrected Jesus Christ in you
[1:22:48] right he's not saying well
[1:22:50] you don't need the fruit of the spirit
[1:22:52] you don't need the gifts of the Spirit
[1:22:53] is that what the do you think the
[1:22:54] prophet is saying
[1:22:56] you don't need any emotions
[1:22:58] you don't need any no he's not saying
[1:23:00] any of that he's saying first don't get
[1:23:03] it out of order
[1:23:05] the evidence of the holy spirit is when
[1:23:07] the spirit of Truth
[1:23:09] comes he'll guide you into all truth
[1:23:14] the evidence is not tongues it's not
[1:23:16] emotion it's not the fruit it's not love
[1:23:20] the Holy Spirit produces those things
[1:23:23] the prophet wasn't teaching us to be
[1:23:25] against love and against fruits and
[1:23:27] against gifts
[1:23:28] no he's teaching us the right order get
[1:23:32] the word
[1:23:33] in you believe and receive that then
[1:23:37] that will produce the life of Jesus
[1:23:39] Christ
[1:23:40] sometimes it's confrontational
[1:23:45] that's clear
[1:23:47] Jesus was confrontational sometimes
[1:23:51] it's very patient
[1:23:53] sometimes it's loving and passes over a
[1:23:57] multitude of sins but sometimes it takes
[1:23:59] it and says that's wrong
[1:24:02] that's we we don't we don't stand for
[1:24:04] that here this is wrong right so again
[1:24:08] see the balance of the word don't don't
[1:24:12] go a million miles one way or a million
[1:24:13] miles the other way
[1:24:15] get the word in you because a person can
[1:24:17] Matthew 7 makes it very clear a person
[1:24:21] can be Anointed with the Holy Spirit
[1:24:24] cast out Devils heal the sick
[1:24:27] preach and the laws gets saved and yet
[1:24:30] be lost themselves
[1:24:33] Jesus said they said Lord Lord have we
[1:24:35] not prophesied and done many wonderful
[1:24:37] works in your name cast out Devils
[1:24:39] healed the sick
[1:24:41] he says depart from me you that work
[1:24:43] iniquity I never knew you
[1:24:45] so what is it it's he that doeth the
[1:24:48] will of the father what's the will of
[1:24:50] the Father the word
[1:24:52] he that walks in and lives the word
[1:24:55] that's the one that Jesus is looking for
[1:24:57] whether whether Miracles are produced or
[1:24:59] not
[1:25:00] it's walking in the word but we know
[1:25:03] signs follow them that believe
[1:25:06] but the signs following is not the
[1:25:09] evidence it's the word
[1:25:11] we give it the word test not the sign
[1:25:13] test amen
[1:25:15] amen not the emotion test the word
[1:25:17] produces emotion the word produces
[1:25:19] science the word produces fruit but get
[1:25:21] it in its proper order in proper
[1:25:24] direction
[1:25:32] turn with me to Ephesians chapter four
[1:25:48] foreign
[1:25:53] let's start at verse
[1:25:56] 11.
[1:25:58] and he gave some Apostles and some
[1:26:01] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:26:04] pastors and teachers and he's still
[1:26:06] giving
[1:26:11] and so this is God that Paul is going to
[1:26:14] start detailing
[1:26:16] God's purpose
[1:26:18] for the church
[1:26:21] he's called he's we understand he's
[1:26:24] called us to go into all the world and
[1:26:26] preach the gospel to every creature
[1:26:29] that's that's the starting point
[1:26:31] and we're to continue that until the
[1:26:33] very end until the last one is called
[1:26:36] but even more so God has a purpose
[1:26:39] inside of this church for the people
[1:26:41] that have been called
[1:26:43] and so now he's beginning he's going to
[1:26:45] start to tell that
[1:26:47] four so he's he sends he gives so this
[1:26:50] is Christ
[1:26:52] giving
[1:26:53] it's talking about Christ he ascended on
[1:26:57] high and gave gifts unto men and he gave
[1:26:59] some
[1:27:00] Apostles and some prophets some
[1:27:03] evangelists some pastors and teachers so
[1:27:06] this is Christ's gift
[1:27:09] to the body
[1:27:11] all right for what purpose verse 12
[1:27:15] for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:27:18] so you see this word perfect or
[1:27:21] perfecting
[1:27:22] it doesn't mean sinless
[1:27:24] what what does this word mean in in
[1:27:28] the Greek there's a word telios
[1:27:32] and it speaks of maturity maturity
[1:27:36] it speaks it speaks of finishing so a
[1:27:39] finishing maturity however however
[1:27:43] this word perfecting is not that
[1:27:47] it's not that word telios in that sense
[1:27:50] it's a different word it is a word that
[1:27:53] means equipping
[1:27:55] so equipping speaks of a military and
[1:28:00] giving them their equipment giving them
[1:28:02] their uniform and their weapons Etc
[1:28:05] everything that they have need of to
[1:28:07] fight the enemy
[1:28:08] so the this is talking about
[1:28:11] the five-fold ministry
[1:28:13] is set is given as a gift to the body
[1:28:16] for the equipping of the Saints to give
[1:28:20] you
[1:28:21] the materials that you need to fight the
[1:28:24] enemy
[1:28:26] okay so brother Branham has asked the
[1:28:28] question do the tapes
[1:28:30] or do does the five-fold ministry
[1:28:34] perfect the church
[1:28:36] and it gave it was a puzzling answer to
[1:28:39] me at first and until I studied this
[1:28:41] verse
[1:28:42] closely I didn't realize what was being
[1:28:44] said brother Branham answered says no
[1:28:48] the blood of Christ
[1:28:50] perfects the bride it's a personal thing
[1:28:53] individual
[1:28:54] so I'm going but doesn't the five-fold
[1:28:56] ministry perfect the Saints that's not
[1:28:58] what that's saying
[1:28:59] it's it's not saying that and that's why
[1:29:01] brother Branham answered that way no
[1:29:03] it's not the tapes no it's not the
[1:29:04] fivefold ministry it's the blood of
[1:29:06] Christ that perfects the bride so what
[1:29:09] are we saying here this the fivefold
[1:29:12] ministry equips
[1:29:14] the Saints for the work of the ministry
[1:29:17] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[1:29:19] the whole body
[1:29:21] ministers to itself builds up itself in
[1:29:24] love that's what you see that verse
[1:29:26] later saying
[1:29:29] um
[1:29:31] verse 16 at the end says make an
[1:29:34] increase of the body under the edifying
[1:29:37] of itself in love so it's not the
[1:29:39] five-fold ministry is not only ordained
[1:29:41] for edifying they're a part of it
[1:29:43] but all of us are for that so back to
[1:29:47] the verse 12 it's for the equipping of
[1:29:49] the Saints
[1:29:52] to do what equipping for what
[1:29:54] for the work of the ministry
[1:29:57] so we we many times speak of this
[1:30:00] so-and-so is a minister
[1:30:02] it's actually not scriptural to speak
[1:30:04] that way
[1:30:06] yes they're a minister but so are you
[1:30:08] every believer is called to be a servant
[1:30:11] to be a minister
[1:30:14] of the word
[1:30:16] in their life amongst each other
[1:30:19] building each other up the Bible says
[1:30:21] the manifestation of the spirit is given
[1:30:23] to every man to profit with all to for
[1:30:26] the common good for the common benefit
[1:30:29] to one another for the edifying of
[1:30:31] itself in love
[1:30:33] and so the fivefold ministry equips the
[1:30:36] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:30:38] the edifying of the body of Christ
[1:30:40] verse 13.
[1:30:44] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:30:46] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[1:30:49] God there's that word unto a perfect man
[1:30:52] until a fully mature man so here is
[1:30:57] God's purpose for this body Ministry
[1:31:01] is so that this
[1:31:05] mystical Body of Christ as a whole will
[1:31:08] come to a place of being a mature man
[1:31:11] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:31:15] fullness of Christ
[1:31:18] that was God's purpose in calling a
[1:31:20] church calling a people is to bring them
[1:31:22] to the maturity of the Messiah
[1:31:24] so that each one of us will be living
[1:31:26] the same kind of life that the Messiah
[1:31:29] lived
[1:31:30] we're supposed to be Messiahs we're
[1:31:33] supposed to be walking in that same
[1:31:35] image
[1:31:37] so we have to have a fully restored and
[1:31:40] matured word in us to produce a matured
[1:31:45] Christian
[1:31:46] life verse 14.
[1:31:49] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:31:52] toss to and fro and carry it about with
[1:31:55] every wind of Doctrine by the slight of
[1:31:57] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[1:32:00] lie and wait to deceive verse 15.
[1:32:06] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[1:32:08] up into him in all things which is the
[1:32:11] head even Christ from whom the whole
[1:32:14] body
[1:32:15] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:32:17] that which every joint supplyeth
[1:32:19] according to the effectual working in
[1:32:22] the measure of every part make an
[1:32:24] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:32:27] of itself in love
[1:32:31] so he starts out and he says Christ
[1:32:34] descended and gave gifts
[1:32:36] and he gave some Apostles some prophets
[1:32:38] some pastors evangelists teachers
[1:32:42] right so there's a there is there is
[1:32:45] people that are ordained of God called
[1:32:48] of God
[1:32:49] calling on their life to preach the word
[1:32:54] and to be examples to the flock those
[1:32:57] are the two places that that in in First
[1:33:00] Peter chapter five he speaks of the
[1:33:02] elders and he says feed the flock of God
[1:33:05] taking the oversight thereof being
[1:33:07] examples examples of the flock
[1:33:10] so we're supposed to lead by feeding the
[1:33:13] people and by being an example
[1:33:17] right and through that that equips the
[1:33:21] Saints for the work of the ministry so
[1:33:24] that together the body as a whole will
[1:33:27] grow into maturity
[1:33:30] so it's it's all of our ministry
[1:33:33] together
[1:33:34] all of our ministry together not just
[1:33:36] fivefold Ministry but the whole body
[1:33:38] ministering to itself bringing it to
[1:33:41] maturity so that what
[1:33:43] why is he bringing us to maturity
[1:33:47] for the rapture
[1:33:49] for the change of the body and that's
[1:33:51] that's why God put his word and brought
[1:33:53] his Revelation why does Paul in
[1:33:55] Ephesians chapter 1
[1:33:57] here he's people that are Christians
[1:33:59] mature they're maturing they're growing
[1:34:02] in the word
[1:34:03] and he says in verse 16 I cease not to
[1:34:06] give thanks for you making mention of
[1:34:08] you in my prayers
[1:34:09] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:11] the father of glory be given to you the
[1:34:14] spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the
[1:34:17] knowledge of him the eyes of your
[1:34:19] understanding be enlightened that ye may
[1:34:20] know what is the hope of his calling in
[1:34:23] the what the riches of the glory of his
[1:34:24] inheritance in the Saints what is
[1:34:26] exceeding greatness of his power to us
[1:34:28] word who believe according to the
[1:34:29] working of his mighty power which he rod
[1:34:32] in Christ when he raised him from the
[1:34:33] dead and set him at his own right hand
[1:34:36] in the Heavenly places
[1:34:38] so he's this is God's purpose in us he
[1:34:43] wants us to have a have a revelation
[1:34:48] of his power
[1:34:50] the greatness of his power
[1:34:53] that is in US
[1:34:55] it's it's in us it's not just the power
[1:34:58] far out it's in Heavenly places no it's
[1:35:02] a he wants it to be revealed to you that
[1:35:04] this power is in you and that power is
[1:35:08] going to literally change your body to
[1:35:11] be likened unto Jesus glorious body but
[1:35:15] we have to come to the unity of the
[1:35:17] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[1:35:19] God unto a fully mature man to the
[1:35:23] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:35:25] of Christ
[1:35:26] we have we as a body of people have to
[1:35:29] grow to that before we can get that new
[1:35:31] body
[1:35:32] before we can be changed into his
[1:35:35] likeness
[1:35:36] physically he's going to change us into
[1:35:39] his likeness spiritually
[1:35:42] that's what the message is sent for
[1:35:45] in Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:35:47] brother Branham says when I think of it
[1:35:48] I suggest see denominations pass off the
[1:35:51] scene and everything else just going see
[1:35:53] when I see God's Great purpose revealing
[1:35:55] himself and having first to reveal
[1:35:58] himself in Christ the fullness of the
[1:35:59] godhead bodily and then to bring that
[1:36:03] fullness of godhead bodily into a people
[1:36:06] that he could have the preeminances the
[1:36:08] oversight the leading
[1:36:11] just a few paragraphs later he says now
[1:36:14] the complete fullness of the godhead
[1:36:16] bodily dwells in his church the
[1:36:21] preeminances all that God was he poured
[1:36:23] into Christ and all that Christ was was
[1:36:25] poured into the church the Believers
[1:36:28] that's what he's speaking about there
[1:36:32] in the Statue of a perfect man he says
[1:36:34] you get it the people who died in here
[1:36:36] are depending and waiting on us so this
[1:36:39] church has to come to perfection in
[1:36:42] order to bring the resurrection
[1:36:44] and they're under Souls under the altar
[1:36:46] waiting for this church to come to its
[1:36:48] Perfection that when Christ does come
[1:36:52] I've got so many more scriptures that I
[1:36:54] want to read
[1:36:55] but I want to I want to start the
[1:36:58] process of closing so we're not here all
[1:37:00] day
[1:37:00] Philippians
[1:37:03] um
[1:37:04] excuse me Hebrews we're going to do
[1:37:05] Hebrews first Hebrews chapter 5.
[1:37:16] and we're going to start at verse 11.
[1:37:19] so he's speaking about Melchizedek he
[1:37:21] says of whom we have many things to say
[1:37:24] and hard to be uttered seeing your doll
[1:37:27] of hearing
[1:37:29] for when the time you ought to be
[1:37:31] teachers you have need that one teach
[1:37:32] you again which be the first principles
[1:37:34] of the Oracles of God and are become
[1:37:37] such as have need of milk and not of
[1:37:40] strong meat
[1:37:42] for everyone that uses milk is
[1:37:44] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[1:37:46] for he is a babe
[1:37:48] listen closely but strong meat belongs
[1:37:51] to them that are full age there's that
[1:37:54] same word
[1:37:55] we saw before
[1:37:57] perfect man in Ephesians 4. so
[1:38:01] full age is another way to translate
[1:38:03] that
[1:38:05] strong meat belongs to the mature
[1:38:08] even those who by reason of use have
[1:38:10] their senses exercised to discern both
[1:38:13] Good and Evil
[1:38:15] therefore leaving the principles of the
[1:38:19] doctrine of Christ
[1:38:20] let us go on into Perfection not laying
[1:38:24] again the foundation of repentance from
[1:38:26] dead works and of Faith toward God and
[1:38:29] of doctrine of baptisms and of laying
[1:38:31] out of hands in the resurrection of the
[1:38:32] dead and of Eternal judgment and this
[1:38:35] will we do if God permit so
[1:38:40] God didn't permit them in the first
[1:38:43] church age to go on to maturity
[1:38:46] the foundation of everything was laid
[1:38:48] there
[1:38:49] but it wasn't until the seventh Church
[1:38:51] age that you had a prophet messenger
[1:38:53] come and bring out and show the full
[1:38:57] reality of Melchizedek and it's the
[1:39:01] connection its connection to us
[1:39:03] and who we are in him
[1:39:06] but there
[1:39:08] you know where he says leaving the
[1:39:10] principles of the doctrine of Christ it
[1:39:12] almost sounds like well we're going to
[1:39:13] leave Christianity behind it go on and
[1:39:15] make a new religion tell us not what
[1:39:17] Paul is saying he's saying not laying
[1:39:19] again in other words if it's already
[1:39:21] been laid for you don't just lay it
[1:39:24] again
[1:39:25] but go move on to things of maturity
[1:39:29] move on from the things of babes to the
[1:39:32] things of full age but the thing is
[1:39:35] there are people that need Foundation
[1:39:37] our children do new believers do
[1:39:40] so those things need to be addressed
[1:39:43] but again you can't just stay there is
[1:39:46] what Paul is saying millions of churches
[1:39:49] in the world that's all that they do
[1:39:52] they stay there the first principles and
[1:39:55] even many churches they don't even
[1:39:57] understand the first principles
[1:39:59] if they just understood the first
[1:40:00] principles it would be wonderful
[1:40:02] but they're not even they're not even
[1:40:04] getting to the first principles
[1:40:06] but we have the foundation but we have
[1:40:08] to build on that Foundation to bring
[1:40:10] maturity and isn't it interesting that
[1:40:13] Paul says you need a revelation
[1:40:16] of who Melchizedek is
[1:40:19] why in the world would that be important
[1:40:21] well we know
[1:40:23] we know if you don't know go read who is
[1:40:25] this Melchizedek
[1:40:27] and you'll find out why that is
[1:40:28] important
[1:40:29] because you'll find out the secret of
[1:40:31] your own life
[1:40:33] so again
[1:40:36] that being being having milk that's
[1:40:39] that's okay
[1:40:41] if you're a babe in Christ drink milk
[1:40:44] but don't just stay drinking milk
[1:40:46] because you'll net you you you can't get
[1:40:48] mature on milk only we need we're in the
[1:40:52] age where we need strong meat
[1:40:55] we need steak
[1:40:57] we need to feed on feed on those kind of
[1:41:01] things because that will produce
[1:41:03] maturity it's what we feed on
[1:41:07] that will then produce the kind of life
[1:41:10] that we need to live
[1:41:12] Philippians chapter 3.
[1:41:25] and verse 7.
[1:41:28] but what things were gained to me those
[1:41:31] I counted loss for Christ
[1:41:34] the eight doubtless I count all things
[1:41:36] but lost for the Excellency of the
[1:41:40] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for
[1:41:42] whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:41:45] things and do count them but done
[1:41:46] that I may win Christ and be found in
[1:41:49] him
[1:41:50] not having mine own righteousness which
[1:41:53] is of the law but that which is through
[1:41:55] the Faith of Christ the righteousness
[1:41:57] which is of god by faith
[1:42:01] that I may know him and the power of his
[1:42:04] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:42:07] sufferings being made conformable
[1:42:10] unto his death if
[1:42:12] there we have that if again
[1:42:14] if by any means I might attain unto the
[1:42:18] resurrection of the dead this is the out
[1:42:22] resurrection of the Dead to put it in
[1:42:24] our vernacular the Rapture if by any
[1:42:27] means I might attain unto the Rapture
[1:42:30] it's a very strange way to speak
[1:42:33] it's it's it's it's it's different than
[1:42:35] we anticipate because if I'm a Christian
[1:42:38] I'm going in the Rapture right
[1:42:40] why is Paul saying that I may know him
[1:42:44] and the power of his resurrection don't
[1:42:46] you already know him sure
[1:42:48] but there's there's a continual process
[1:42:51] there's an ongoing work that we have to
[1:42:54] be a part of so that we can attain unto
[1:42:59] the resurrection of the dead so that we
[1:43:00] can go in the rapture
[1:43:02] and as you read this you're going to see
[1:43:04] there's some Christians
[1:43:06] they're not made ready they're not
[1:43:08] prepared and they don't go in the
[1:43:10] Rapture and there's some Christians who
[1:43:12] are made ready who know him and have an
[1:43:15] ongoing process of knowing him
[1:43:18] and they're made conformable to his
[1:43:20] death
[1:43:21] and they go in the rapture
[1:43:25] verse 12 he says not
[1:43:27] as though I had already attained in
[1:43:29] other words
[1:43:30] Paul's not saying oh I'm not a Christian
[1:43:32] I don't have the Holy Ghost I'm trying
[1:43:34] to get the Holy Ghost that's not what's
[1:43:36] being spoken here he knows he's saved he
[1:43:39] knows he has the Holy Ghost but what is
[1:43:42] he what is he saying I haven't reached
[1:43:44] that full maturity wherein I can go in
[1:43:48] the Rapture and we can say the same
[1:43:50] thing here are we still here today
[1:43:52] not that I have already attained either
[1:43:54] are already fully mature
[1:43:57] but I follow after if that I may
[1:43:59] apprehend or lay hold of
[1:44:02] that for which also I am laid hold of of
[1:44:06] Christ Jesus
[1:44:09] so Christ
[1:44:11] took hold of my life for a purpose
[1:44:14] so that I would take hold of
[1:44:17] full maturity
[1:44:19] and an immortal body a changed body
[1:44:23] Brethren I count myself not to have
[1:44:25] already apprehended but this one thing I
[1:44:28] do
[1:44:29] this is key this is it this is what we
[1:44:32] as Christians need to be living
[1:44:34] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:44:36] and reaching forth under things which I
[1:44:40] which are before I press toward the mark
[1:44:44] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[1:44:47] in Christ Jesus
[1:44:49] where it says High Calling there it
[1:44:51] literally is the upward call of God in
[1:44:54] Christ Jesus what is the upward call The
[1:44:57] Rapture
[1:44:58] the catching catching away
[1:45:00] and so he calls it the I press towards
[1:45:04] the mark so that what is that it's the
[1:45:06] finish line
[1:45:07] the finish line is full maturity and a
[1:45:11] rapture so he's I'm pressing towards it
[1:45:13] so the picture is when you see the
[1:45:15] runners they don't just casually here's
[1:45:17] the finish line and they just casually
[1:45:19] oh I'm just jogging through I mean no
[1:45:21] they I'm not going to Sprint because
[1:45:22] there'll be an injury
[1:45:24] but if I was sprinting I'm going to
[1:45:26] pretend like I'm sprinting but you're
[1:45:28] sprinting and you you you reach forward
[1:45:32] to hit that Mark they hit that line and
[1:45:34] you push your body ahead to make it so
[1:45:37] that's the picture that we're getting
[1:45:39] from Paul he's pressing forward
[1:45:42] he is forgetting the things behind and
[1:45:45] he's reaching forth and that's an
[1:45:48] expression of the kind of desperation
[1:45:51] that Paul is living with this is this is
[1:45:55] not a casual thing
[1:45:57] this is not well I'm a superstar and I
[1:45:59] just have to jog all the way through
[1:46:01] it's no no
[1:46:02] is a battle it's a fight there's a
[1:46:05] Finish Line and we have to be totally
[1:46:08] desperate and passionate about what
[1:46:11] we're doing
[1:46:12] because we need to be to get there
[1:46:16] and then at the end we could say with
[1:46:18] Paul he said I labored more abundantly
[1:46:21] than all the apostles yet not I
[1:46:25] but the grace of God that was in me
[1:46:28] so we understand that it's the grace
[1:46:31] working in us to produce
[1:46:34] this kind of desperate life
[1:46:37] but when Grace is in us that's what it
[1:46:39] produces
[1:46:41] so in the sermon perfect Faith musicians
[1:46:44] if you'd come
[1:46:47] not a faith but a perfect Faith Build It
[1:46:50] Up in here and watch a perfect god with
[1:46:53] a perfect heart keep a perfect Promise
[1:46:55] by his perfect word which is sharper
[1:46:58] than a two-edged sword and a discerner
[1:47:01] of the thoughts of the heart
[1:47:04] what we're coming now to the perfection
[1:47:08] because the people has got to come to
[1:47:11] this in order for the rapture
[1:47:13] that's what's holding it away right now
[1:47:15] is waiting for the church to come into
[1:47:18] that perfect raptured rapturing faith
[1:47:22] look for it looking for it it means a
[1:47:24] lot of Shaving down for me it means a
[1:47:27] lot for you but together we'll make it
[1:47:30] by the grace of God
[1:47:32] so there's a sanctifying work that's
[1:47:35] taking place there's a shaving down the
[1:47:37] prophet speaks of it why is he talking
[1:47:39] about a shaving down it means there's
[1:47:40] things on our life that need to be
[1:47:42] shaved off need to be cleaned off
[1:47:44] there's a maturing that needs to take
[1:47:47] place in our life in that word
[1:47:50] so that we can be made ready so it's a
[1:47:53] transforming that's why brother Brandon
[1:47:55] preached this the power of
[1:47:57] transformation
[1:47:58] it's not a mistake we're living in the
[1:48:00] hour where our bodies are going to be
[1:48:01] transformed but first
[1:48:03] the spirit inside of the spirit and the
[1:48:06] soul and the body this body needs to be
[1:48:09] brought into total
[1:48:12] maturity and completion I'm going to
[1:48:14] finish with first Thessalonians 5 23 and
[1:48:18] 24.
[1:48:25] and the Very God of Peace
[1:48:27] sanctify you holy
[1:48:30] sanctify you completely
[1:48:34] and I pray God
[1:48:36] your whole spirit
[1:48:39] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[1:48:43] unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:48:46] isn't that
[1:48:47] amazing this is where Wesley got his
[1:48:49] Doctrine for entire sanctification
[1:48:53] but I believe he was just probing at
[1:48:55] something that was for our day
[1:48:58] in our day God is bringing us to entire
[1:49:01] sanctification why because it takes a
[1:49:04] fully restored word it couldn't be just
[1:49:05] a partial word that they had in Wesley's
[1:49:07] day
[1:49:07] it's the full word restored today that
[1:49:11] will sanctify us holy
[1:49:15] and then then he says he wants our
[1:49:19] I could understand if he said our spirit
[1:49:21] and soul be preserved blameless under
[1:49:24] the under the rapture
[1:49:26] let's put it that way but he says even
[1:49:29] your body
[1:49:30] to be preserved blameless so there's
[1:49:34] going to be a people living on Earth
[1:49:38] when the the coming of the Lord takes
[1:49:41] place
[1:49:42] that their their tripartite man body
[1:49:46] Spirit soul is going to be blameless and
[1:49:51] preserved until that hour what a
[1:49:54] magnificent thing
[1:49:56] verse 24.
[1:49:59] Faithful Is He that calls you who also
[1:50:03] will do it amen
[1:50:06] aren't you glad for that promise
[1:50:09] he's called you
[1:50:10] he's going to do it we're living in the
[1:50:13] age where the bride is going to go in
[1:50:14] the Rapture it's clear from the
[1:50:16] scripture he's not going to just take a
[1:50:20] backslid
[1:50:21] Fallen church and Rapture billion people
[1:50:25] out of the earth that's the concept that
[1:50:27] the world has no he sent a word
[1:50:31] specific word
[1:50:33] that's promised in the Bible in this
[1:50:35] Bible
[1:50:36] he's made it put it on display and he's
[1:50:39] taken that Messenger off the scene and
[1:50:41] he says grow to maturity in that word
[1:50:44] not following a man
[1:50:46] but following the word
[1:50:48] and you're going to be completely
[1:50:51] finished work
[1:50:54] matured in Christ because he called you
[1:50:57] in this hour
[1:50:59] he'll also do it amen let's stand
[1:51:04] Heavenly Father we we love you
[1:51:08] and we're so thankful
[1:51:10] for this promise
[1:51:12] you're faithful you will produce
[1:51:16] a matured fruit of the spirit
[1:51:20] in the bride tree
[1:51:23] it's maturing in us now
[1:51:25] Lord that's a promise that's an end time
[1:51:28] promise
[1:51:30] Lord and you're working in us and we're
[1:51:34] we we're going to make the Rapture
[1:51:36] because faithful he is he that has
[1:51:40] called you you'll also do it Lord
