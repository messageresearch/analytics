[34:08] says something
[34:10] God can speak to our situation without

[35:31] I'm just uh
[35:32] if I don't have to hold anything then
[35:34] that's probably better
[35:36] can we just bow our heads for a second
[35:37] before we begin

[35:40] Jesus for this
[35:42] this message Lord God that's about to
[35:44] come forth in this this content is so
[35:47] exciting to me Lord what you have in
[35:49] your scripture God that just jumps right
[35:51] out and jumps off the page sometimes and
[35:55] it's so simple Lord God that we can just
[35:57] walk right in it Lord Jesus and and
[36:00] these little uh these little nuggets of
[36:03] wisdom Lord God that you lay in your
[36:05] word and then when you find one you end
[36:07] up finding another and you Lord you've
[36:10] given us an eyesight to begin to see
[36:12] Lord Jesus these things as they come out
[36:15] at us Lord Jesus and I pray father that
[36:17] it would help to strengthen the body of
[36:20] Christ here Lord God at this church and

[36:24] would just Inspire these that are here
[36:26] God to to move forward and that when you

[36:31] soon that you'll find us working
[36:33] together and loving one another and
[36:36] working for the kingdom as we're Lord

[36:47] just the exactly the way it should be
[36:49] Lord God in our hearts father with the
[36:52] fruits of the spirit God in the action

[36:56] body of Christ just working together

[36:59] peace and love Lord God so that anyone
[37:02] that would look upon God would could see

[37:06] they are Christians by their love
[37:08] dear heavenly father I pray you bless
[37:10] the service today God help me to work

[37:15] father that you'd help me to disseminate
[37:17] it in a way that they would be able to
[37:18] understand nor God you have your way in
[37:21] this service Lord God whatever is to be
[37:23] said or done Lord God you take complete
[37:25] control of that now in Jesus name amen
[37:28] amen
[37:32] y'all may be seated for a moment
[37:35] I'm gonna get caught up here where I'm
[37:38] at
[37:39] get that PowerPoint presentation up
[37:43] there we go
[37:44] okay uh last time so what I think what
[37:47] we'll do is just do a quick review of
[37:49] what we said last time and then we'll
[37:51] pick up from the the really exciting
[37:53] part that we we have as part two here so
[37:56] last time we'll just go through these
[37:58] slides real quick the ministry of helps
[37:59] this was the scripture we were
[38:01] referencing where it does talks about
[38:02] healings helps governments diversities
[38:05] of tongue these these other the ones up
[38:08] front here the apostles prophets and
[38:10] teachers we we fully aware of those as
[38:13] being Ministries in the body of Christ
[38:14] but some of these other ones here a
[38:16] little bit harder for us to Define
[38:17] sometimes what does it really mean to to
[38:20] be in the ministry of helps or that part
[38:22] of the body of Christ so we're trying to
[38:24] identify some of those things as we went
[38:26] forward and uh
[38:28] this is a definition of help to make it
[38:31] easier for someone to do something by
[38:33] offering one service or resources pretty
[38:36] simple
[38:37] right
[38:38] and then I asked you what is a Christian
[38:40] and then I said what does a Christian do
[38:43] since we've been given this tremendous
[38:45] gift of the blood of Jesus on our lives
[38:48] what does that invoke what does that
[38:50] cause us to do in in return is it
[38:53] something that we just continue to take
[38:55] in I think we say that we're saved we're
[38:57] baptized we're filled with the Holy
[38:59] Spirit what but what actions are there
[39:01] and we talked about the scripture that
[39:03] talks about faith without works is dead
[39:05] we talked about that somehow there's
[39:07] going to be some action that we partake
[39:10] in rather than just the reading and the
[39:12] praying and continue to take in
[39:13] co-worked we're coming to church and
[39:17] attending church is is great but then
[39:21] there's some things maybe we can do and
[39:23] this is a little bit difficult because
[39:24] immediately when we start talking about
[39:26] things that you can do everybody gets a
[39:28] little bit defensive like
[39:30] we're all very busy people in this day
[39:32] and age right so is he trying to get
[39:34] volunteers to come to the church and
[39:36] clean the lawn or what is he trying to
[39:37] do here what's I'm not trying to pull a
[39:39] fast one on you there are some specific
[39:41] things that you can do that have a
[39:42] spiritual impact on the church on your
[39:45] community on the other believers within
[39:47] the body and on your life and I'm
[39:49] telling you that I told my my mom sold
[39:52] story that when she was saved there was
[39:53] just an understanding that when you're
[39:55] saved you're saved to serve in some way
[39:58] I go to a church uh on Sunday mornings
[40:01] at 8 A.M usually and I'd run sound for
[40:03] them and it hasn't conflicted with my
[40:05] own uh post of Duty at my church so I've
[40:08] been doing it for years it's uh Pastor
[40:10] Marvin Winans from Detroit comes all the
[40:12] way to Toledo and pastors little church
[40:13] down there it's a little Pentecostal
[40:16] independent church perfecting Church
[40:18] Toledo and one of the things they say
[40:19] that I really latched on to and like is
[40:21] he said we the the minister said the
[40:24] pastor says we don't uh let's see we
[40:27] don't have or what kind of members do we
[40:30] have here and the congregation says
[40:31] working members we only have one kind of
[40:33] member and it's working members so they
[40:36] they start things off with the mentality
[40:38] that we're going to be working together
[40:39] as a body from the very beginning so
[40:42] this this uh mentality that you're just
[40:45] going to sit and receive the word and
[40:46] then go home or Fellowship a little bit
[40:48] and we're thinking about what restaurant
[40:49] we're going to afterwards those things
[40:51] we're just going to start to put that
[40:52] out of our minds a little bit preparing
[40:54] you for a different type of thinking
[40:56] it's so easy to fall into that this day
[40:59] and age is trying desperately to get you
[41:01] to have some restful thoughts and your
[41:03] mind is going to take the path of least
[41:05] resistance so whatever it can do to rest
[41:08] or to stay back and not have to engage
[41:11] itself it's going to do your body's
[41:13] going to do the same thing so in order
[41:15] for someone to get healthier or to lose
[41:17] weight and I know this personally
[41:18] personally from the struggle of trying
[41:20] to lose weight if you're going to move
[41:22] the ball forward in anything in any
[41:24] discipline in life natural or spiritual
[41:27] it's going to take an amount of effort
[41:29] equal to and above
[41:31] the status quo you're gonna have to move
[41:34] forward somehow
[41:35] uh we work as unto the Lord
[41:38] we work for the kingdom of God
[41:41] we've talked about the Dead Sea being
[41:42] that it takes in tremendous amounts of
[41:44] water but there's no Outlet to it it's
[41:46] an unhealthy place right it's just full
[41:49] of salt you can float on the surface of
[41:51] it because the salt content is so high
[41:53] we don't want to be Christians that are
[41:55] that way a healthy a healthy Christian
[41:57] walk has the intake of everything that
[42:00] we're taking in we're reading and we're
[42:01] praying and we're doing these things but
[42:03] there's also an outlet a way that we can
[42:05] release some of that and we can talk to
[42:07] somebody else about what's going on we
[42:08] can fellowship and share what's on our
[42:10] hearts and and uh confess our faults one
[42:14] to another there's a lot that is engaged
[42:15] in that but we do not want to be an
[42:18] intake only Christian right
[42:20] we talked about the pulpit we talked
[42:23] about complexes holding us back from
[42:25] doing things maybe that the Lord is
[42:27] calling us to do
[42:29] um and uh God doesn't consult you on
[42:32] your complexes he didn't consult shamgar
[42:34] before he said thou Mighty Men of Valor
[42:36] remember in scripture here's the guy
[42:38] hiding and scared to death from all them
[42:43] Philistines coming in and God says the
[42:46] angel shows up and says Thou Mighty Man
[42:48] of Valor I got a word for you here and
[42:49] he's like can you kind of keep it down a
[42:51] little bit don't tell anybody this but
[42:53] God doesn't consult your complexes
[42:55] before he calls you to do certain things
[42:57] so we can begin to set our complexes
[43:00] aside and we can even set aside some of
[43:02] the false humility that we might have
[43:04] Upon Our Lives where we say well I don't
[43:06] want people to think I think anything
[43:08] great of myself so I'll just kind of
[43:10] stay humble and stay God opens God opens
[43:13] doors by giving you a gift that makes a
[43:15] way for itself scripture says your gift
[43:17] will make a way for itself so if you sit
[43:20] back trust God and just begin to move
[43:23] forward and love him and do what the
[43:25] sign says behind me continuously looking
[43:29] for Revelation in your life those doors
[43:31] are naturally going to go if you submit
[43:33] your gift to the Lord he's going to be
[43:34] able to use that so there's two sides of
[43:36] this complex is some one thing that'll
[43:38] hold us back
[43:39] the other side or this is a quote that
[43:41] we had how can I do this for the Lord or
[43:43] the blank for the kingdom if I can't
[43:45] even do this so we'll put some we'll
[43:48] fill the blanks in here this is one of
[43:49] those situations where it's a catalyst
[43:52] anything you put in those anything you
[43:54] put in those blanks is wrong
[43:57] anything you put in there it wouldn't
[43:59] matter what the because of this I can't
[44:03] do this how can I do this for the Lord
[44:05] if I do this Lord he may call you to do
[44:07] something completely out of your comfort
[44:09] zone and completely out of your skill
[44:11] set
[44:13] he asked Moses to go do things and Moses
[44:16] probably thought in his own mind well
[44:18] I've got all of this
[44:20] training and I've got all of this
[44:21] ability and then he puts them on the
[44:23] back side of the desert and erases all
[44:25] of that from him and brings him back a
[44:27] stuttering person to release to get his
[44:31] people free so with this in mind these
[44:33] blanks that you put in this is our
[44:35] complex is talking this is our mentality
[44:37] talking his ways are higher than our
[44:38] ways he thinks higher I have a gift of
[44:41] blank even if you know what your gift is
[44:43] some of you we haven't realized what it
[44:45] is yet right but you say you have a gift
[44:47] or something but I used it out in the
[44:49] world I used it for other things that
[44:51] were wrong so I'm not going to do that
[44:52] mostly this is along the lines I talked
[44:54] about the musicians who had been out in
[44:57] the world playing music and singing and
[44:58] dancing and doing things out in the
[45:00] world and they don't want to make any
[45:01] connection to whatever that was out
[45:03] there because they associate everything
[45:05] that they were doing psychologically
[45:06] this happens to people they associate
[45:08] everything that they're doing all those
[45:09] connections have to do with a sinful
[45:12] life and the things that they want to
[45:13] try to forget and disappear and walk
[45:15] away from as part of repentance so
[45:17] uh they're afraid to bring those things
[45:20] in here but you understand God didn't
[45:22] give you that at Birth that gift for you
[45:25] to use it out there he gave it to use
[45:27] here
[45:29] so the fact that you used it out there
[45:31] can be repented of and left behind and
[45:34] you can bring that gift here and say
[45:36] Lord now I lay this before you I
[45:38] consecrate this gift unto you how can
[45:40] you use this for the kingdom and he will
[45:42] do that and then uh
[45:45] this was the uh the tale the story of
[45:48] the talents
[45:49] and what we to what degree you used the
[45:52] talents that God gives you I was talking
[45:54] a little bit about this is what your
[45:56] gift and reward will be back
[45:58] uh when you're when you're done using
[46:00] the gear so there's some connections
[46:02] there we don't really need to go into
[46:03] that too much I have a gift of it but I
[46:06] use it for the world okay that's the
[46:07] same thing the other the complexes isn't
[46:09] the one thing remember the second thing
[46:11] that we got to watch out for is apathy
[46:13] sometimes we're just under complex
[46:15] sometimes we're just under laziness it's
[46:17] just I'm just tired I work too much it's
[46:20] enough for me just to get my family in
[46:21] the house of God every week and that's
[46:23] about all I can do and trust me I
[46:25] sympathize it is a busy world and and we
[46:28] do that so hopefully by the time we get
[46:30] near the end of this here it's not going
[46:32] to feel like I'm overwhelming you or
[46:33] asking you to do
[46:35] greater things and I'm not here to do
[46:37] that what I'm here to do is to say
[46:39] there's some work to be done for you and
[46:43] God's the one that gets to place you in
[46:45] that place what I'm trying to get you to
[46:46] do is adjust your thinking so that
[46:49] you're ready to do it when he calls on
[46:51] you that's the only Point okay so we
[46:54] need to stop disqualifying ourselves and
[46:56] others based on our past present or
[46:58] future based on our family history based
[47:01] on our complexes and based on our apathy
[47:03] based on what happened last week
[47:05] God may call you to do something that is
[47:06] out of character for you or the people
[47:09] around you
[47:11] I'm in eternity let's keep moving here
[47:14] uh
[47:16] great quote by Raven Hill I love this
[47:18] quote opportunities of a lifetime must
[47:19] be seized within the lifetime of the
[47:21] opportunity essentially saying this from
[47:23] a standpoint of when God calls on your
[47:25] heart
[47:26] God will call on your heart for a
[47:28] certain thing those calls will
[47:31] eventually get quieter and quieter and
[47:33] quieter if you don't respond
[47:36] just the truth there's opportunities
[47:38] that come your way there's callings that
[47:40] come your way and if you don't move on
[47:42] those callings if you decide to do
[47:44] something else God will say like he did
[47:46] with Balaam
[47:48] okay go ahead
[47:50] and these people are asking you you
[47:52] remember the story of Balaam where the
[47:54] people came and asked them to go and
[47:56] curse these people and here's a prophet
[47:58] of God saying I can't curse those are
[47:59] God's people I can't go down there and
[48:00] curse God's people and they said yeah
[48:02] but we're going to give you a lot of
[48:03] money and a lot of houses and a lot of
[48:05] stuff
[48:06] uh let me ask the Lord right and he goes
[48:10] back and asks the Lord and God says
[48:11] absolutely not what are you thinking no
[48:12] those are my people I'm paraphrasing God
[48:15] didn't say it just that way
[48:16] but uh then Balaam says guys I can't go
[48:20] I can't do it and uh have a nice day and
[48:22] they said yeah but wait a minute here's
[48:24] some more princes that we have here's
[48:26] some more money here's some more houses
[48:27] here's all of this stuff and he goes let
[48:29] me go ask the Lord again
[48:30] God's word on the subject was already
[48:33] spoken those are my people you're not
[48:35] going to go and curse those people and
[48:37] balaam's going hey maybe a 10 curse
[48:40] maybe I can go up and just give a little
[48:42] tiny curse and then all of this this is
[48:44] great I could have an in-ground swimming
[48:46] pool it'd be a great witnessing tool and
[48:48] uh
[48:49] you know he's trying to reason with God
[48:51] this is there any way possible that this
[48:53] thing can happen and uh God finally goes
[48:56] okay go ahead
[48:58] so did God change his mind
[49:00] okay this is the point that I'm making
[49:02] here is that there's opportunities that
[49:04] will come and we'll go and there's a
[49:06] lifetime of that opportunity that exists
[49:08] within the perfect will of God
[49:10] and we want to be as much as we possibly
[49:14] can right in the perfect will of God we
[49:16] don't want to have to make him wait we
[49:18] want to be ready so a lot of it requires
[49:20] for us to prepare our thinking and to be
[49:23] ready when the Call Comes okay so what
[49:25] do we do as Christians and then we
[49:27] talked about the the seven things and
[49:29] I'm going to roll right through these
[49:30] because I got a list of them coming up
[49:33] then this is where that the entire
[49:35] scripture we read the entire scripture
[49:37] this is where it talks about the gifts
[49:39] within this the the spiritual gifts
[49:40] within the church it also talks about
[49:42] let there be no Schism or no division
[49:45] between the Brethren uh this also talks
[49:47] specifically about there being one one
[49:50] spirit and we are all subject under that
[49:53] Spirit we all work by that same
[49:55] individual spirit and that's how there
[49:57] can be such sweet harmony in what we do
[50:00] there can be a lot of moving parts to
[50:01] something but we're all moving towards
[50:03] one goal and I've got a great example of
[50:05] that in our kids days program that I
[50:07] noticed this year we went to we have a
[50:09] vacation bible school that we host at
[50:11] our church and
[50:12] when we were a little church we had
[50:14] almost 100 people that they weren't all
[50:17] wouldn't always come all at the same
[50:19] time so we had enough room in our little
[50:20] church and I it's great to see almost
[50:22] all the seats full today you guys are
[50:24] growing and doing I mean just moving in
[50:26] the right direction here this is really
[50:27] exciting and uh and just make room
[50:30] because as people come they're going to
[50:32] feel the spirit of the lord they're
[50:33] gonna feel that warmth and want to come
[50:34] and visit anyway the the uh at the kids
[50:37] days program
[50:38] the we used to do this and we try to do
[50:41] it as big as we possibly can you know
[50:43] for the kids and we try to bring horses
[50:44] out so they could do horseback riding
[50:46] and we did these big presentations where
[50:48] we'd find a bunch of spotlights and
[50:50] Flash them around and try to make as
[50:52] exciting as we could these dramas and
[50:54] things like that where we would
[50:55] dramatize a great message and the only
[50:57] the only message we ever had the entire
[51:00] vision of the thing that my sister began
[51:02] sister Sharon the only Vision that she
[51:04] had is this one statement we just want
[51:06] to bring the little kids in and we want
[51:08] to teach them that God is good and the
[51:11] Devil is bad
[51:12] and if we can get that anchored in their
[51:15] head as a big Stone anchored in their
[51:17] minds and anchored in their hearts if we
[51:19] can do that then everything else in life
[51:22] can fall on that thought and they can
[51:25] come back to that point and just so they
[51:27] understand that God is good the Devil is
[51:29] bad and so it's a really simple message
[51:31] that we have so for all these years 25
[51:33] years we've been doing this this year uh
[51:36] and we've just been blessed because we
[51:39] we got the new building and when I
[51:42] walked through the building with my dad
[51:43] before he passed away he was looking
[51:45] around and he had more Vision than the
[51:47] rest of us he said we got to get this
[51:48] building and everything and it's just we
[51:49] were looking around like
[51:50] we will never I thought we'd rope off
[51:53] the back side of that building and not
[51:54] use it for years and I'm telling you now
[51:56] that I was telling you before as well by
[51:58] the grace of God people are coming and
[52:00] not just people moving from church to
[52:02] church uh to you know Christians from
[52:04] here and there but P brand new people
[52:06] are coming in and there's tattoos all
[52:08] over them and they're I mean they're
[52:10] coming straight out of the world with
[52:11] all these things and they're just being
[52:13] bathed in the refreshing word of God and
[52:15] there's great things happening now
[52:16] they're bringing their children to these
[52:18] events and everything and but it's just
[52:19] a great time I walked around at that
[52:21] kids days program and I couldn't believe
[52:23] how
[52:24] we have a chat thing that we use on
[52:27] Telegram and all the different
[52:29] departments have their rooms that
[52:31] they're that they're doing things in and
[52:33] I stay completely in what Anne does with
[52:36] the audio video things and so that's my
[52:39] little world and the music and
[52:40] everything I had no idea the second day
[52:43] of the event I go walking outside and
[52:45] we're spread there's horses in a petting
[52:47] zoo in a village they built in a village
[52:49] outside and all of these people working
[52:52] in Harmony and we have testimonies
[52:54] coming back that they're like
[52:56] everybody was on the same page everybody
[52:59] was in harmony I had no clue what the
[53:01] other people in the church were doing
[53:03] that we had you know 300 kids and
[53:06] parents and everything there but it was
[53:08] just in in Harmony and that's a
[53:10] testament to there being one spirit and
[53:12] if we're all using our gifts in our way
[53:14] and we're just churning away working at
[53:16] it we can look around and realize that
[53:18] God is being uh glorified and lifted up
[53:21] in what we do so just a little testimony
[53:24] and I I think he can do that anywhere he
[53:27] can do that here as well because it's
[53:28] the same Spirit we got down in Ottawa
[53:30] down there Ottawa Lake it's not there
[53:33] anywhere Petersburg Michigan is the Same
[53:35] Spirit we can all rally around here amen
[53:37] okay so that's the description we go
[53:40] through it there this is a great quote
[53:42] that I ended on last time so let's
[53:44] whatever we have let's use it for the
[53:46] kingdom of God's sake every Talent we
[53:49] have let's put it in the kingdom of God
[53:51] and uh that's just I love that quote
[53:54] just take those talents and just put
[53:56] them in the kingdom of God let's use
[53:57] them for that okay so this is where
[53:59] we're going to pick up
[54:01] today
[54:02] these are the seven things that I I I
[54:05] kind of got through and I picked out
[54:07] seven things last time here so here they
[54:09] are and I'm working on your mind here
[54:11] okay I'm working on a way of thinking
[54:13] that's different than what the world the
[54:15] natural thing
[54:17] number one preparing yourself you're
[54:19] saved to serve
[54:21] getting that mentality and locking that
[54:23] in there
[54:24] you want to begin to prepare your mind
[54:26] to be used of the Lord so the farmer
[54:29] prepares the field for rain
[54:32] putting the seed in there and he preps
[54:33] for it so preparing yourself getting
[54:35] ready reading your Bible and praying and
[54:37] being ready getting organized writing
[54:39] the vision down writing down your
[54:41] resources how can we move forward what
[54:44] what are we going to do together what do
[54:46] we want to accomplish there's all kinds
[54:48] of things that you can accomplish
[54:49] there's a group of people within the
[54:52] church
[54:52] with brother Paul that wanted to give a
[54:55] Christmas bonus to several uh
[54:59] the evangelists that travel around the
[55:01] country as evangelists and so we wanted
[55:03] to do something special by giving them a
[55:05] Christmas bonus one year and I think
[55:07] they've continued doing that actually
[55:08] and it's just something special that
[55:10] they wanted to do so throughout the year
[55:12] they'll do things and raise funds and
[55:13] everything like that so that they can
[55:14] give a Christmas bonus to those I mean
[55:16] ministers don't usually get Christmas
[55:18] bonuses but there you go it's something
[55:20] that that they wanted to do and it may
[55:22] seem like a really small thing to the
[55:23] people around you and you might get
[55:25] criticism for it but whatever those
[55:27] things are to do working in tune with
[55:29] the other body the members of the body
[55:32] around you that's great and with your
[55:33] pastor uh get tuned up if you need to
[55:36] learn something if you need to research
[55:38] something study that's always very good
[55:40] to do to prepare yourself to do the best
[55:42] job you can for the Lord all this can
[55:44] happen before you even know what he
[55:46] wants you to do
[55:47] right all of this can be you preparing
[55:50] so that when the Call Comes you're ready
[55:54] uh this number four is kind of my thing
[55:56] that I threw in I would have people
[55:57] probably argue with me on this point
[55:59] begin before you're completely ready I
[56:03] would not wait until everything is
[56:04] perfect to begin
[56:07] because if you wait for Perfection and
[56:08] everything to line up you may be waiting
[56:10] a long time now there is God's time for
[56:12] things so when he puts his Blessing on
[56:15] something it tends to move a little
[56:17] quicker than it would just with us
[56:18] standing behind it pushing it but
[56:20] there's nothing wrong with us if it's a
[56:21] noble thing and if it lines up with some
[56:24] of the things we're going to talk about
[56:25] here in just a little bit go ahead and
[56:27] get behind and begin to prep and begin
[56:28] to try this stuff out and learn some
[56:30] trial and error and things like that
[56:31] pray that the Lord will put his Blessing
[56:33] on it and when he does bring that there
[56:35] you're already in motion and going in
[56:37] that direction and if the Lord shows you
[56:39] that maybe that wasn't it he'll have
[56:41] your retool or he'll have it laid on his
[56:43] heart that's this isn't the thing great
[56:45] do what the prophet said pull that old
[56:47] Shell out of the gun put another one in
[56:49] Ram it in there and let's pull the
[56:51] trigger and see what happens next don't
[56:53] ever get discouraged let's just keep
[56:55] moving forward okay
[56:57] number five
[56:58] share and expand this is a way for you
[57:01] to begin to you should talk a lot about
[57:03] this because you learn a lot about your
[57:05] own Vision by bouncing it off people and
[57:08] getting their response from it and don't
[57:09] get discouraged if they look at you and
[57:11] they just don't see it don't do that I
[57:13] had a very prominent missionary brother
[57:16] brother I have hold in high regard and I
[57:19] told him when we started our foundation
[57:20] years ago we started the LaFontaine
[57:22] foundation and the idea was we were a
[57:25] family of musicians so we wanted to help
[57:27] musicians around the world so one of the
[57:29] things we did was we were putting sound
[57:31] systems and instruments together to send
[57:34] to the Philippines to to give churches a
[57:37] new sound system or or new instruments
[57:39] or whatever so when we would travel over
[57:41] there we would go over and do some
[57:42] concerts and gain you know get people to
[57:45] come together and then we'd find out
[57:47] what the needs were the churches and
[57:48] we'd go and get a truckload of
[57:50] instruments from somewhere in Manila and
[57:52] then we'd go and deliveries to the
[57:53] churches or have them meet us and pick
[57:55] them up so we thought it was great the
[57:58] greatest thing in the world is just
[57:59] really excellent I mentioned it to this
[58:00] brother and he goes I kind of feel like
[58:02] that's a waste of time I don't know that
[58:03] you guys should be doing that it takes
[58:05] up resources and and these other things
[58:08] and I just was like I thought boy that
[58:09] takes the wind out of my sails but then
[58:12] we were doing a good work and we were
[58:14] doing what God laid on our hearts and I
[58:16] I'm not a
[58:17] I'm would not be a good missionary
[58:20] probably because I you know Motel 6 is
[58:25] about as rough as I get uh if I've got a
[58:28] you know so the mission field would be a
[58:30] little scary for me so anyway the with
[58:33] all of that said uh
[58:35] don't be discouraged I mean Take Good
[58:38] Counsel and sometimes it's going to be
[58:40] positive sometimes it's going to be
[58:41] negative if you do anything for the Lord
[58:43] matter of fact if you do anything at all
[58:45] start a business or anything there are
[58:46] going to be people that are going to
[58:47] criticize you
[58:49] and it's not necessarily that you have
[58:51] to grow thick skin in fact I recommend
[58:53] that you don't grow thick skin because
[58:55] thick skin tends to inoculate you from
[58:59] being open enough to the body of Christ
[59:02] to be able to to to communicate and to
[59:06] confess your faults one to another and
[59:08] to open yourself up to be able to be a
[59:10] part of the body who can get close to
[59:12] other people if you develop thick skin
[59:14] from hurts and pains that you've had
[59:16] before then what happens is you built
[59:18] that wall and you never really allow
[59:20] yourself to be
[59:22] um
[59:23] what's that word I'm looking for the
[59:25] right word uh
[59:27] it's just you don't let yourself be
[59:30] soft and vulnerable that's what it is
[59:32] vulnerable enough to be to somebody who
[59:35] can love one another like that so anyway
[59:37] uh we'll move forward uh learn to
[59:40] encourage others become a compliment
[59:42] artist
[59:43] because you'll find out that you want to
[59:46] have that reciprocated this is talk
[59:49] about the vision first ask questions
[59:51] about things and then learn to encourage
[59:53] others
[59:55] uh mirror the support that you like to
[59:58] desire to have back
[59:59] okay
[1:00:01] that Matthew 7 12 is the scripture has
[1:00:06] to do with you we've all heard it's the
[1:00:08] Golden Rule do unto others as as you
[1:00:10] would have them do unto you so treat
[1:00:12] people the way you'd like to be treated
[1:00:13] then number seven is to meet the need of
[1:00:15] someone else if you're moving along
[1:00:17] you're churning and everything and
[1:00:19] things are a little stagnant so what
[1:00:21] helps a little bit to grease the skids
[1:00:23] and to get things going a little bit is
[1:00:24] look around at someone else that needs
[1:00:26] help and jump in with their Vision it'll
[1:00:28] keep you exercised and keep you going in
[1:00:30] the right direction I think and you'll
[1:00:33] find that eventually your mission starts
[1:00:35] to move forward as well from doing that
[1:00:37] okay so Ministry of helps part two
[1:00:40] that was the that was the review are you
[1:00:42] ready to go
[1:00:44] all right good Proverbs 23 7 as he
[1:00:49] thinks in his heart so is he as a man
[1:00:51] thinketh in his heart we've heard of
[1:00:52] this before this is a tremendous
[1:00:55] scripture it's small but it is
[1:00:59] huge
[1:01:00] as he thinks in his heart so is he
[1:01:05] so whatever you think in your heart so
[1:01:08] is he is that what scripture's saying
[1:01:09] how far can we take this honestly
[1:01:11] because how you think is determined how
[1:01:15] far you go in the Lord how far you'll go
[1:01:17] with your mission how far you go with
[1:01:19] your vision how far you go with your
[1:01:21] family how far you go with your business
[1:01:25] there's no qualifications put on this
[1:01:26] that I can see as he thinks in his heart
[1:01:29] so is he so our thoughts are going to be
[1:01:32] extremely important Philippians 4 8 says
[1:01:35] finally my brethren whatever things are
[1:01:37] true whatever things are noble whatever
[1:01:39] things are just whatever things are pure
[1:01:42] whatever things are lovely whatever
[1:01:44] things are of good report if there is
[1:01:47] any virtue
[1:01:49] and if there is anything praiseworthy
[1:01:51] meditate on these things so it's asking
[1:01:55] you to find the stuff that is pure to
[1:01:58] extrapolate from Life pull out of life
[1:02:00] the things that are lovely and the
[1:02:01] things that are good report and is this
[1:02:05] completely opposite to the culture or
[1:02:07] what
[1:02:08] our social media culture has us
[1:02:11] constantly looking for something
[1:02:12] negative that we can find and we can
[1:02:15] post how upset we are about it and then
[1:02:18] once we post it we get all these other
[1:02:20] posts of people that say wow you're
[1:02:22] right or no you're wrong and I can't and
[1:02:24] they're ready to fight over these things
[1:02:26] constantly and so I'm going to mute this
[1:02:28] here real quick because I'm I'm getting
[1:02:30] all of the the messages from our church
[1:02:32] up there that's just begun my my tech
[1:02:34] Cruise has a text message here anyway so
[1:02:38] sorry about that um
[1:02:40] but meditating on the things of God this
[1:02:43] is so important and finding the things
[1:02:45] that are positive it's asking us to do
[1:02:47] that this is a this is an uphill battle
[1:02:49] I think we can do it let's train our
[1:02:51] minds to look for the things that are
[1:02:53] praiseworthy and the things that are
[1:02:55] virtuous Romans 12 2.
[1:02:58] do not be con uh conformed to the world
[1:03:01] but be transformed how
[1:03:04] by the renewing of your mind
[1:03:07] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:03:10] acceptable and perfect will of God we
[1:03:13] want the perfect will of God and the way
[1:03:15] that you prove that the way you find
[1:03:17] that perfect will of God as you begin
[1:03:20] have to use your mind to put to renewing
[1:03:24] by the mind so what it's saying here is
[1:03:27] you can re you can be transformed even
[1:03:30] your transformation as a believer
[1:03:33] has to do with
[1:03:34] is it the renewing of your
[1:03:37] spiritual walk is it the renewing of if
[1:03:40] I just get a new Bible or if I would
[1:03:42] read enough quotes or if I listen to
[1:03:44] enough tapes or
[1:03:46] do missionary work or you know there's a
[1:03:49] lot of things that we can put in here
[1:03:50] and it's asking us to renew
[1:03:53] be transformed by the renewing of our
[1:03:55] mind refreshing the way we think about
[1:03:57] things and looking and proving in our
[1:04:00] minds what is good and acceptable and
[1:04:02] that's the perfect will of God that will
[1:04:04] find the perfect will of God but it has
[1:04:06] to do with us changing and renewing our
[1:04:08] minds so our minds are very important
[1:04:10] how we think about things is very
[1:04:11] important Colossians 3 2 set your mind
[1:04:13] on things above not on things of Earth
[1:04:15] there's tons of scriptures like this
[1:04:16] second Corinthians 10 5 casting down
[1:04:19] arguments and every okay now this one is
[1:04:22] this is fighting language here right so
[1:04:25] it's giving you some good advice but
[1:04:27] this one has got some pretty militant
[1:04:29] Works behind us you're going to go out
[1:04:32] and you're going to grab this thing and
[1:04:33] you're going to cast it down this
[1:04:35] argument
[1:04:36] you're going to take the high places
[1:04:37] that exalts itself against the knowledge
[1:04:40] of God and you're going to take this
[1:04:42] thing and you're going to bring it into
[1:04:43] captivity you're going to tie it up and
[1:04:45] you're gonna drag it
[1:04:47] and you're going to make it captive to
[1:04:50] The Obedience of Christ so this is
[1:04:52] telling us that there's probably going
[1:04:54] to be a struggle involved with training
[1:04:56] this thing
[1:04:57] to
[1:04:59] to find The Obedience of Christ so this
[1:05:02] is some pretty strong language and I
[1:05:04] think if we can if we can you know Buck
[1:05:06] ourselves up a little bit and get ready
[1:05:08] for a fight when it comes to our mind
[1:05:10] our mind is just naturally not going to
[1:05:12] let us it's the flesh right so we're
[1:05:14] going to fight against this thing a
[1:05:16] little bit so let's be ready for the
[1:05:17] fight that's not I think this is going
[1:05:19] to be an easy thing okay
[1:05:21] this is a great quote remember the brand
[1:05:22] I'm here it says uh
[1:05:24] and may I stop here just a moment to say
[1:05:27] this this is a huge statement he's about
[1:05:29] to make
[1:05:30] and I'll go on record because the
[1:05:32] recorders are going them tapes are
[1:05:34] rolling back there
[1:05:36] that any Divine promise in God's word if
[1:05:39] you take the right mental attitude
[1:05:41] towards any how many
[1:05:44] any of God's Divine promises
[1:05:47] will bring it to pass regardless of what
[1:05:50] it is
[1:05:51] if God promises it and you show the
[1:05:54] right mental attitude God will fulfill
[1:05:57] his promise to you listen to this
[1:05:59] statement right here
[1:06:02] that promise is good to
[1:06:04] a few people
[1:06:08] that promise is good to people who have
[1:06:10] the Holy Spirit
[1:06:14] that promise is good to people who don't
[1:06:15] have a problem with alcoholism
[1:06:18] right
[1:06:20] This Promise is good to anyone who will
[1:06:23] look at it in that respect
[1:06:27] this this can save the whole city
[1:06:31] this can save everybody you should be
[1:06:33] talking to anybody you come in contact
[1:06:35] with about this right here you realize
[1:06:37] that the book that we call the Bible is
[1:06:39] full of divine Promises of God and you
[1:06:43] can have access to every one of them for
[1:06:45] no other reason but having one an
[1:06:48] attitude the right attitude about it and
[1:06:50] you have to change nothing you have to
[1:06:52] give up nothing for that
[1:06:54] it's tremendous you'll turn all those
[1:06:56] promises on for that right there alone
[1:06:57] now that I believe that once that begins
[1:07:01] to happen in your life and their lives
[1:07:02] that they'll turn to Christ for that and
[1:07:05] the the other things will come along
[1:07:06] sometimes we think we've got to get them
[1:07:08] in the water first and get them baptized
[1:07:09] get them down to the altar do all of
[1:07:11] these things and and and these things
[1:07:13] but right here it's talking about having
[1:07:14] the correct mental attitude first this
[1:07:17] has to be conquered before we can do all
[1:07:18] of the other things so let's not get the
[1:07:20] cart before the horse here let's make
[1:07:22] sure that we're getting things right
[1:07:24] first becomes first comes the
[1:07:26] relationship with the Lord and the right
[1:07:27] mental attitude towards it love that
[1:07:29] quote
[1:07:30] are you ready to think like a Christian
[1:07:33] in the ministry of helps you ready
[1:07:35] all right so we're going to go forward a
[1:07:37] little bit this is going to be much
[1:07:38] shorter than the last time guys I I was
[1:07:41] so happy to get to this point before but
[1:07:44] uh I don't think it'll take nearly as
[1:07:46] long as I did last time and I don't I
[1:07:48] don't mean to do that but I felt like I
[1:07:50] went long before so here we go in uh in
[1:07:53] thinking
[1:07:55] with the ministry of helps in mind okay
[1:07:58] the five purposes of the New Testament
[1:08:00] Church and this is stuff that I just
[1:08:02] pulled out from looking at scriptures I
[1:08:03] grabbed five things that are the purpose
[1:08:06] sort of the purpose of what a church
[1:08:08] does and what a church is and the reason
[1:08:10] I grabbed this is because as we begin to
[1:08:13] conduct our minds into what are we going
[1:08:15] to do for the Lord what what's the best
[1:08:16] thing to do I felt like we should
[1:08:18] probably put some boundaries on what we
[1:08:20] can start to look at so we begin to
[1:08:22] define the battlefield a little bit here
[1:08:24] right so we're going to figure out what
[1:08:26] is the church supposed to do number one
[1:08:27] what does the scripture say the New
[1:08:29] Testament Church does and what's its
[1:08:31] purpose and what is it into and that way
[1:08:33] when we begin to brainstorm we're
[1:08:36] beginning to get ideas of what we can do
[1:08:37] for the Lord that we start to see that
[1:08:40] okay does this align with what the Bible
[1:08:43] says that a church does or the body of
[1:08:45] Believers does so that's why that's the
[1:08:47] reason for this
[1:08:48] so I've got five different ones I'm sure
[1:08:50] there's more purposes Matthew 28 19 uh
[1:08:54] 20.
[1:08:55] through 20 says go ye this is the Great
[1:08:58] Commission right we're we're used to
[1:09:00] this the Great Commission is if you're a
[1:09:02] Believer and you've given your heart to
[1:09:03] the Lord You're this is your commission
[1:09:07] this is you
[1:09:08] go ye into all the world teach all the
[1:09:10] nations baptizing them in the name of
[1:09:12] the father and the Son and the Holy
[1:09:13] Spirit and Holy Ghost teaching them to
[1:09:15] observe all the things whatsoever I have
[1:09:17] commanded you and lo I Am With You
[1:09:20] Always even to the ends of the world
[1:09:22] Amen so he's with you on this Quest all
[1:09:26] the way along we're going to fulfill the
[1:09:28] Great Commission so as we're thinking of
[1:09:30] things that we can do for the Lord we're
[1:09:32] thinking in terms of
[1:09:34] this is going to help frame up what
[1:09:36] we're doing if what you're coming up
[1:09:38] with in your Concepts and what your
[1:09:40] pastor is working with in the group
[1:09:41] starts to work together somehow helps
[1:09:43] with this or fits in line with the Great
[1:09:45] Commission you're right where you need
[1:09:47] to be amen it's exactly where you want
[1:09:49] to be right
[1:09:51] uh the second purpose is to worship God
[1:09:54] this is not a private worship only this
[1:09:57] is Daniel opening the drapes getting on
[1:10:00] his knees and praying when the
[1:10:01] government said not to okay this is a
[1:10:04] public display I love one of my favorite
[1:10:06] books to read and I still go back to it
[1:10:08] a lot is the Haley's Bible Handbook and
[1:10:11] I don't know if you've ever seen him
[1:10:12] before but there's a lot of historical
[1:10:14] pictures he has the scriptures and the
[1:10:16] references and then next to it he has
[1:10:17] all of the archaeological information of
[1:10:20] all the findings and everything like
[1:10:21] that through the history of everything
[1:10:23] it's one of my favorite books because I
[1:10:24] love history like that so uh in Haley's
[1:10:28] Bible Handbook there's quotes and
[1:10:29] everything like that and he talks about
[1:10:31] in the beginning of it in the forward he
[1:10:33] talks about some of the things we do as
[1:10:34] Christians then he said one of the
[1:10:36] things you do as an act of worship is
[1:10:39] you go to church you do it publicly so
[1:10:42] your neighbors and everybody else can
[1:10:43] see that I may not agree with every
[1:10:45] single thing that that Pastor is going
[1:10:47] to say there but I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:10:49] show my colors I'm gonna get up and I'm
[1:10:51] gonna go to church because that's what a
[1:10:52] Christian does as he goes to church uh
[1:10:55] and and I agree that sometimes it's nice
[1:10:58] to have those resources to go to church
[1:10:59] online sometimes but that is a that is a
[1:11:03] really cheap replacement for being here
[1:11:06] rubbing shoulders with the body of
[1:11:07] Christ very cheap replacement if you
[1:11:09] have to do it I understand but if you
[1:11:12] can get somewhere where the body of
[1:11:13] Christ is you need to be there with them
[1:11:15] first Peter this is uh but ye are a
[1:11:18] chosen generation a royal priesthood a
[1:11:20] royal priesthood a holy nation I love
[1:11:23] this one A peculiar people will identify
[1:11:25] with that
[1:11:27] that you should show forth show forth
[1:11:31] so people can see it show forth the
[1:11:34] Praises of him who hath called you out
[1:11:36] of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light so
[1:11:38] as you're developing these plans to do
[1:11:41] something for the Lord you're in context
[1:11:44] here looking it does this show forth the
[1:11:48] Praises
[1:11:49] right of him that has shown me from
[1:11:52] Darkness Into The Marvelous Light is am
[1:11:54] I showing him and what I'm doing can
[1:11:56] they see me when they're looking at me
[1:11:57] are they looking at you the Lord
[1:12:00] that's what we want to know uh
[1:12:03] and then John 4 this is uh but the hour
[1:12:06] cometh and now is when the true
[1:12:09] worshipers
[1:12:10] shall worship the father in spirit and
[1:12:13] in truth for the father seeketh such to
[1:12:16] worship Him
[1:12:17] there's another uh point at another
[1:12:20] scripture in Romans that talks about
[1:12:24] I got behind over here guys not supposed
[1:12:27] to let me get behind
[1:12:30] moving on to
[1:12:32] uh in Romans 8 it talks about uh
[1:12:36] how all of creation is groaning
[1:12:40] everything in the entire world there's
[1:12:43] this groaning happening
[1:12:46] and it says here that the father is
[1:12:47] seeking he's looking he's looking
[1:12:49] where's this manifestation of the true
[1:12:52] worshipers it's it's it's got to come
[1:12:56] sometime and I'm hoping that that I
[1:12:58] don't pass on in this life without
[1:13:00] seeing the manifestation of these true
[1:13:02] worshipers I believe that I'll get a
[1:13:04] chance we'll get a chance to see him
[1:13:05] right here in this generation I really
[1:13:06] believe that
[1:13:08] this scripture if you don't know what's
[1:13:10] happening here this is when Jesus walks
[1:13:13] up to the well and the woman at the well
[1:13:15] is there and he's talking to her and he
[1:13:18] says go get your husband he asked for a
[1:13:20] drink she says you're not supposed to be
[1:13:21] talking to me you're a Jew and I'm
[1:13:23] Samarian and he says go get your husband
[1:13:25] she says no I don't have one of them and
[1:13:28] he says you're right you don't but
[1:13:30] you've had five of them right this all
[1:13:33] this discussion is happening here and
[1:13:34] she goes I think you're a prophet you're
[1:13:37] you're seeing things that only a prophet
[1:13:38] would see and then she talks about her
[1:13:41] people the Sumerians worshiping way back
[1:13:44] in the day in the mountains primitive
[1:13:45] worship up in the mountains and they
[1:13:48] were saying back then that they had the
[1:13:49] truth up in the mountains and she says
[1:13:51] now you Jews are saying you got to go
[1:13:52] down to to uh worship down in Jerusalem
[1:13:55] and uh but what is the truth here and he
[1:13:58] says yeah you're right you Worship in
[1:13:59] the mountains and we're the Jews were
[1:14:01] the people of God and we're down in
[1:14:02] Jerusalem and worshiping and he says but
[1:14:04] I tell you
[1:14:05] and this is where he picks it up that
[1:14:08] there's coming a day
[1:14:10] there's coming a time and like Romans
[1:14:13] says all creation and the father is
[1:14:15] seeking this moment when the true
[1:14:17] worshipers and they're going to worship
[1:14:19] in spirit and in truth and it's just a
[1:14:21] this a huge scripture because it's
[1:14:23] saying someday there's coming people
[1:14:25] that are going to get it right for all
[1:14:27] of church history we've had to have
[1:14:29] little course Corrections and we've had
[1:14:31] to have Messengers come on the scene and
[1:14:33] help us to get corrected back and and
[1:14:35] Luther come and he'll nail that thing up
[1:14:37] there because the church got off course
[1:14:39] and it helps to course correct a little
[1:14:41] bit some people just go off and continue
[1:14:42] in the in the Folly that it was in the
[1:14:45] organized church but there's a little
[1:14:46] course correction God in his grace
[1:14:48] Jehovah God and his love for us
[1:14:51] continues to send a man with a course
[1:14:53] correction so that we can stay on and he
[1:14:56] did it for us in the last day and guess
[1:14:57] what there's no more of them coming
[1:14:59] so we've got to grasp on to what he said
[1:15:01] and we've got a course correct we've got
[1:15:03] to stick to it yes and stay right with
[1:15:05] it and we got to realize that sometimes
[1:15:07] we got off track a little bit and
[1:15:09] sometimes people that came out of those
[1:15:10] denominations when brother Branham came
[1:15:12] and preached come out of her my people
[1:15:13] they came out of there but they drug
[1:15:15] along with them a lot of their
[1:15:17] Pentecostal and Methodist ideas and they
[1:15:19] brought him right in here with us and
[1:15:21] it's time for us in the last day
[1:15:23] respectfully I see this to begin to shed
[1:15:25] some of those denominational ideas that
[1:15:27] have been keeping us from this
[1:15:29] manifestation of the sons of God it's
[1:15:31] time for this manifestation of the sons
[1:15:34] of God the Father seeketh
[1:15:37] all right
[1:15:38] number three
[1:15:41] we should Fellowship in all of the these
[1:15:43] couple scriptures you can write those
[1:15:45] down I'm going to move along through
[1:15:47] this a little bit
[1:15:48] Acts 2 as the church was being
[1:15:50] established there
[1:15:52] and they continued steadfastly in the
[1:15:54] apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in
[1:15:58] the breaking of bread and in prayers
[1:15:59] they continue to be together
[1:16:01] this scripture here is well known to us
[1:16:04] and let us consider one another to
[1:16:07] provoke unto love
[1:16:09] and to Good Works love it I love it I'm
[1:16:13] going to poke you a little bit I'm going
[1:16:14] to make it a little bit uncomfortable
[1:16:15] for you until you love me
[1:16:18] and we're going to provoke you to good
[1:16:20] word that's what I'm here doing today
[1:16:21] I'm provoking you to find some good
[1:16:23] works and do them with one another amen
[1:16:25] uh so not forsaking the assembling of
[1:16:28] yourselves together as the manner of
[1:16:31] some is but exhorting one another and so
[1:16:34] much the more as you see the day
[1:16:36] approaching is the day approaching
[1:16:38] let's get together then amen let's
[1:16:42] strengthen one another uh the this is
[1:16:45] the fourth purpose
[1:16:46] so going back to that for just for a
[1:16:49] second if if you're if what you're going
[1:16:51] to do for the Lord and what you're going
[1:16:52] to do for the body of Christ is in tune
[1:16:55] with getting together and fellowshipping
[1:16:57] like that it's a it's usually an
[1:16:59] indication that it's going to be
[1:17:00] edifying to the body of Christ so that's
[1:17:02] a good thing and all of this is subject
[1:17:05] to you praying about it the spirit of
[1:17:08] God moving on your heart and again like
[1:17:10] I said if you're trying something that's
[1:17:12] not quite working or you talk to the
[1:17:14] pastor about it and the pastor goes well
[1:17:15] let's let's see if we can retool it this
[1:17:18] way or maybe wait on that let's pray
[1:17:20] about that or something like that in
[1:17:21] tune with the leadership of the body and
[1:17:23] in tune with what the leadership of the
[1:17:25] spirit of God is if you're putting those
[1:17:27] things in place this is good indication
[1:17:29] that you're on the right track if you
[1:17:30] can align it with these some of these
[1:17:32] Scriptures it helps a lot
[1:17:34] so uh our purpose also as a body of
[1:17:37] Christ is to minister to provide
[1:17:39] Minister another word for minister or
[1:17:41] Ministry is to be a an assistant to be a
[1:17:45] help
[1:17:46] okay one of the one of the definitions
[1:17:50] of minister is servant
[1:17:52] to administer okay so uh in the uh
[1:17:55] Ephesians 4 here and he gave some
[1:17:59] Apostles where we were okay he gave some
[1:18:01] this is another one of the uh references
[1:18:04] to what he gives to the church Apostles
[1:18:06] and some prophets and some evangelists
[1:18:08] and some pastors and teachers for the
[1:18:10] perfecting of this why did he give it
[1:18:12] why do you give all those people for the
[1:18:14] perfecting of the Saints
[1:18:16] wait a minute you guys can't be perfect
[1:18:19] can you
[1:18:20] the perfecting of the Saints is this
[1:18:22] true
[1:18:23] it says right here I don't know
[1:18:25] our our goal is perfection right when we
[1:18:28] step from this body to the other body
[1:18:29] that Perfection is coming so let's start
[1:18:32] getting ready for it amen uh for the
[1:18:35] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:18:36] the ministry and for the edifying of the
[1:18:38] body of Christ make sure that what
[1:18:41] you're doing is aligned with edifying
[1:18:43] the body of Christ very important
[1:18:48] fifth one is to love
[1:18:51] really really important here's the
[1:18:53] Capstone okay John 13. I better read
[1:18:57] this over here
[1:18:59] a new commandment I give you that ye
[1:19:01] love one another as I have loved you
[1:19:05] uh that you also love one another that
[1:19:07] as I've loved you that you also love one
[1:19:09] another by this you shall know that
[1:19:12] you're my disciples if you have love one
[1:19:15] to another this is how people know that
[1:19:17] you're a disciple of Christ they can
[1:19:19] sense and they can see on display
[1:19:22] not privately not quietly but right out
[1:19:25] there on display amen you can see that
[1:19:27] you love one another
[1:19:30] uh incidentally if they can see openly
[1:19:33] that you love one another then if you
[1:19:36] don't they can see openly that you don't
[1:19:40] conversely right so if they sense that
[1:19:44] if people sense that then they're going
[1:19:46] to find fault in that and if they're
[1:19:48] going to criticize that in you okay so
[1:19:50] we show love to one another not because
[1:19:52] we're trying to run away from showing
[1:19:54] hate towards one another but because
[1:19:55] it's the right thing to do we want love
[1:19:57] in our hearts and we want love for
[1:19:59] everybody in our hearts I asked my mom
[1:20:01] what time what's the most important
[1:20:03] thing for a Believer and she said the
[1:20:05] most important thing what we're supposed
[1:20:07] to do as Christians is to love everybody
[1:20:09] we're just supposed to love everybody
[1:20:12] and uh so here we go let's go to the
[1:20:14] next one First Corinthians 13. uh though
[1:20:16] I speak with the tongue of men and of
[1:20:18] angels and have not charity love I am
[1:20:21] become a sounding brass or a tinkling
[1:20:24] symbol
[1:20:25] I know a little something about tinkling
[1:20:26] symbols I'm a drummer so
[1:20:28] and I play trumpet in junior high and
[1:20:30] it's as bad as you think it it was it's
[1:20:32] terrible
[1:20:33] uh
[1:20:35] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[1:20:38] and understand all the Mysteries and all
[1:20:41] the knowledge if I've got it all and
[1:20:43] though I have all the faith
[1:20:46] so that I could remove mountains and I
[1:20:48] have not charity I am
[1:20:51] I'm okay
[1:20:53] I am nothing
[1:20:57] and though I bestow all my goods to feed
[1:21:00] the poor I'm a rich guy and I'm given to
[1:21:02] all kinds of people I gave more in the
[1:21:05] plate Brother John
[1:21:07] I'm the one that helped build this
[1:21:10] church with my funds
[1:21:13] and give my body to be burned I am
[1:21:15] sacrificial if I have not charity it
[1:21:19] profit me nothing
[1:21:24] some tough statements there
[1:21:26] so we want the love of God and all that
[1:21:29] we do your motivation for everything
[1:21:31] moving forward inside the body of Christ
[1:21:33] should be I want to express love in some
[1:21:36] way to somebody amen
[1:21:38] okay that was a slide that I was going
[1:21:40] to do some some other things that would
[1:21:42] have taken us too long so that Fortress
[1:21:45] of you maybe we'll do that another time
[1:21:47] uh okay this is a great quote from
[1:21:49] brother Brandon said we know that in the
[1:21:51] drama they change masks
[1:21:54] they come from one thing to another
[1:21:56] and that's what you did he start he's
[1:21:59] praying in this situation he's talking
[1:22:00] to the Lord that's what you did you came
[1:22:03] from the spirit of God the great Jehovah
[1:22:06] and you put on a mask of a human being
[1:22:09] this is a great quote because it starts
[1:22:11] to lead I didn't put the whole quote
[1:22:12] here because I just wanted to talk about
[1:22:13] this part there are some times where
[1:22:15] you're going to play a role in this
[1:22:17] drama and it may or may not be a
[1:22:20] comfortable role for you to play at the
[1:22:21] time but if it's fulfilling a need for
[1:22:24] the body of Christ then play that role
[1:22:27] to the best of your ability until God
[1:22:28] plugs somebody into that role because
[1:22:30] sometimes he's going to call on you to
[1:22:32] do something else you all have heard of
[1:22:33] ministers that have well here's a
[1:22:35] situation with me I'm not even a
[1:22:37] minister I'm I'm a uh I'm a sound guy I
[1:22:40] work in the ministry of helps within the
[1:22:42] body of Christ this is what I do and I
[1:22:44] love I serve the Lord with all my heart
[1:22:45] I try to learn everything that I
[1:22:47] possibly can I go to classes and I do
[1:22:49] whatever I can to make sure that I'm
[1:22:50] doing the best job I know how to do in
[1:22:52] that capacity for the body of Christ but
[1:22:54] there's sometimes that God will use you
[1:22:56] to do something that's really out of the
[1:22:58] ordinary for you like this like I'm
[1:22:59] standing here talking to you so uh
[1:23:02] you'll you've all heard ministers that
[1:23:03] are evangelists sometimes and I've heard
[1:23:05] my dad who's a great evangelist Minister
[1:23:08] and then sometimes he would step into
[1:23:10] the role of a pastor and he would or a
[1:23:12] teacher and he would teach something and
[1:23:14] for that moment there he was being used
[1:23:16] he was wearing a different mask so to
[1:23:18] speak and God was using him in a
[1:23:20] different way so don't be afraid to play
[1:23:21] a role if you need to play a role for
[1:23:23] something the the Disney company has
[1:23:26] something that they do with uh and I'm
[1:23:28] not getting political here that's I know
[1:23:30] they're going there's a lot of things
[1:23:31] going on with the Disney Corporation so
[1:23:33] I'm just uh making a point here that
[1:23:35] their their employees that work at all
[1:23:38] the Disney World places in Disneyland
[1:23:40] they don't call them employees they call
[1:23:43] them cast members
[1:23:45] so the the point that they make is when
[1:23:48] you come to work and you put on the
[1:23:50] customer you put on your uniform when
[1:23:52] you step into public out from behind
[1:23:54] whatever or up the stairs from whatever
[1:23:57] tunnel or whatever you come out of but
[1:23:59] when you step into public you're playing
[1:24:01] a role
[1:24:02] for the happiest place on earth
[1:24:04] now I I think about that sometimes and
[1:24:06] I'm walking down Main Street USA maybe
[1:24:08] at Disney World I'm looking around at
[1:24:09] these people and they're just every one
[1:24:11] of them are bubbly and they're happy and
[1:24:13] they're giving it balloons and Candy to
[1:24:15] my kids and I'm looking and doing are
[1:24:17] they really in this good mood I mean
[1:24:19] they gotta be having some rough days
[1:24:20] Sometimes some people
[1:24:22] just got divorced or some people just
[1:24:25] went through a terrible breakup or some
[1:24:27] people just went through a terrible
[1:24:29] thing with their family or I just lost
[1:24:31] my dad or I just lost my mom I I wrecked
[1:24:35] my car I had two flat tires on the way
[1:24:37] to work but you don't get to bring any
[1:24:40] of that on stage you're a cast member so
[1:24:43] you can leave all of that backstage and
[1:24:45] when you step forth in public you are ex
[1:24:48] you're you are the example you're living
[1:24:50] an example and I want you guys to know
[1:24:52] that too that the world is watching you
[1:24:55] they are watching you and you have
[1:24:58] you don't need mine but you have my
[1:25:00] permission and you have permission
[1:25:02] from the Lord
[1:25:04] to drop all of that stuff off we leave
[1:25:07] all that at the Lord At His Feet and say
[1:25:10] I do not have I don't have you don't
[1:25:12] have the capacity to carry the burden as
[1:25:14] it is
[1:25:15] so trying to pick up all of this stuff
[1:25:17] and carry forward
[1:25:18] you by now you should know that that's
[1:25:21] probably not the best thing to do leave
[1:25:23] those things behind
[1:25:25] put on the whole armor of God he put the
[1:25:28] mask on you fit it on you and that way
[1:25:31] you can go forth and what people see is
[1:25:33] wow how come you're so strong it's not
[1:25:35] you being strong it's that God gave me a
[1:25:37] mask to wear here and he gives me the
[1:25:39] permission to leave all of my stuff
[1:25:41] backstage I never have to bring it on
[1:25:43] stage with me you never have to see
[1:25:46] you never have to see the weakness now I
[1:25:48] can say brother I really need prayer I
[1:25:49] have this weakness can you pray with me
[1:25:51] absolutely with the other actors you get
[1:25:54] backstage and you pray about things and
[1:25:55] you work in the backyard on things and
[1:25:57] maybe even you argue a little bit in the
[1:25:59] backyard or you got in front of me there
[1:26:01] you upstaged me a little bit maybe you
[1:26:03] shouldn't do this or that and you may
[1:26:04] have to work a bunch of stuff out with
[1:26:06] the director but when you step on stage
[1:26:08] you're playing a role for the for the
[1:26:10] world and for the Lord to see how
[1:26:12] faithful you are in whatever role that
[1:26:13] he has so
[1:26:15] anyway we'll keep moving forward here
[1:26:21] okay
[1:26:24] uh yeah here's another one
[1:26:28] so this is a little bit further down in
[1:26:29] the same quote actually speaking like
[1:26:31] this
[1:26:32] father we know that we uh and he's I
[1:26:35] think you're still praying you guys
[1:26:38] uh father I don't remember to replace it
[1:26:41] yeah father we know that this tape goes
[1:26:44] all over the world
[1:26:45] uh and here is fine little group sitting
[1:26:48] here today this visible audience here in
[1:26:51] Phoenix Arizona or Phoenix oh God 15
[1:26:53] years of hard preaching and scolding and
[1:26:57] God thou knowest the reason the reason
[1:27:00] is love
[1:27:01] all of this work and everything I do and
[1:27:04] that he's giving the Capstone here in
[1:27:07] Shalom he's telling all of that work
[1:27:09] basically comes down to love
[1:27:12] here's another one
[1:27:13] it's a symphony see you'll find it comes
[1:27:16] to a junction everybody is all wondering
[1:27:19] I call it a junction I don't know music
[1:27:21] a musician is here why he would uh
[1:27:25] forgive me and I'm a musician I forgive
[1:27:27] you brother Brandon uh of my rude way
[1:27:31] but it's we're beating out got to have
[1:27:34] something to act I'll it'll go real low
[1:27:37] way down you wonder what it is see if
[1:27:41] you can get into the rhythm of it you
[1:27:44] understand it
[1:27:45] that's the only way you'll ever
[1:27:47] understand God is get into the rhythm of
[1:27:50] it
[1:27:51] as a Christian drummer I really love
[1:27:54] that quote
[1:27:55] um and I will say this
[1:27:57] that what he's talking about here
[1:28:00] I'll go ahead and expound a little bit
[1:28:01] as a musician not to add to what he's
[1:28:03] saying or anything like that but what
[1:28:06] he's talking about is the way that the
[1:28:08] music ebb and flows okay music is a
[1:28:11] series of tension and release
[1:28:14] all music is
[1:28:15] so you're creating a moment of a
[1:28:18] crescendo where you take the emotion of
[1:28:20] the people and you bring them high to a
[1:28:21] certain point and then there's a release
[1:28:23] of that Crescendo it's called a
[1:28:25] decrescendo where you come back down
[1:28:26] from that so music flows and you this
[1:28:29] emotional up and down and this is what
[1:28:31] he's describing if you stay locked into
[1:28:33] the rhythm of it watch the conductor
[1:28:35] stay right in it because he's going to
[1:28:37] take you up high he's going to take you
[1:28:39] really low where you barely can hear and
[1:28:40] there's one little violin that's just
[1:28:43] scratching across those strings real
[1:28:45] slow like that and Boeing really and
[1:28:47] then it'll take you up to where it's
[1:28:48] just almost too loud for you to even
[1:28:50] handle just the motion okay so God's
[1:28:53] gonna allow these things to happen he's
[1:28:54] going to play your life like this and
[1:28:57] you've got to follow and stay right in
[1:28:58] line and the great thing about it is is
[1:29:01] as a conductor
[1:29:02] oh this is the quote uh it's a symphony
[1:29:05] is this where yes it's a symphony see
[1:29:07] you'll find it comes to a junction and
[1:29:10] everybody oh this is the quote we just
[1:29:11] did yeah so it's a it's a symphony
[1:29:15] and if I show you this picture here of a
[1:29:17] conductor in front of the symphony
[1:29:19] orchestra the spirit of God is our
[1:29:22] conductor and I don't know if you've
[1:29:24] ever watched a symphony before but when
[1:29:27] a conductor is standing and he's looking
[1:29:29] at the musicians of everybody out there
[1:29:31] and he's got Violence Section one
[1:29:33] Violence Section two and the violas and
[1:29:38] the cellos and then the bases go around
[1:29:40] behind and the trumpets are back there
[1:29:42] French horns are way over on this side
[1:29:44] back there tubas and everything from
[1:29:46] back in there all the percussionists are
[1:29:48] way back over there there's a harp that
[1:29:49] sits over here and when you look at an
[1:29:51] orchestra they usually sit all of those
[1:29:53] places and that conductor will move his
[1:29:55] arms and everybody has music to watch
[1:29:57] they're watching the music but in their
[1:30:00] peripheral vision up here while they're
[1:30:02] watching the music they can see the
[1:30:03] conductor and the conductor's calling
[1:30:04] them to go louder with more demonstrate
[1:30:07] movement and softer with less movement
[1:30:09] and dynamics of playing it so they're
[1:30:12] playing the notes on the page
[1:30:14] out of your scripture you've got all the
[1:30:16] the word the notes on the page but the
[1:30:18] letter of the law is harshness if you
[1:30:21] just sit and look at the music and play
[1:30:24] it
[1:30:24] but where you get it is the movement of
[1:30:27] the Spirit by watching the conductor
[1:30:29] and if he's giving you that direction
[1:30:31] that's there you're sure you're paying
[1:30:34] you're playing the same notes that
[1:30:35] everybody else that ever took a lesson
[1:30:36] could play on the Note but it's not that
[1:30:39] it's how you're playing it and all of
[1:30:41] that emotion comes from our conductor
[1:30:43] which is the spirit of God each one of
[1:30:46] you watching the conductor in his
[1:30:48] movement in motion and what you'll find
[1:30:50] out is over time what I've found out is
[1:30:52] that
[1:30:53] when God's moving in a certain way I can
[1:30:56] begin to react to it like Lord in within
[1:30:58] the body of Christ and I'll start to
[1:31:00] make adjustments even to my staff or to
[1:31:02] people that are that I'm working with in
[1:31:04] in the body of Christ and say maybe we
[1:31:06] should do this a little bit and I think
[1:31:07] maybe we should move this camera over
[1:31:09] here because it and I'll start to make
[1:31:10] motions in that direction and you watch
[1:31:12] as something else is happening over in
[1:31:14] the church and because I move that
[1:31:16] technical camera over in that direction
[1:31:18] something happened in the church there
[1:31:20] and motion went that direction we didn't
[1:31:23] talk about that we didn't plan on it at
[1:31:25] all but it was God saying I want this to
[1:31:28] happen this way and he's moving that
[1:31:29] direction now that's a very maybe in
[1:31:32] your eyes a poor example or a simple
[1:31:33] example but this is the world I live and
[1:31:35] I say thank you Lord that he cares
[1:31:37] enough about where I face the lens on a
[1:31:40] camera or or how someone is used in that
[1:31:43] way this is us watching the conductor
[1:31:45] and being ready to go and the ups and
[1:31:47] downs emotion of it is so very very
[1:31:50] important
[1:31:52] I want to demonstrate something can I go
[1:31:54] over here to the piano real quick all
[1:31:55] right I'm going to demonstrate something
[1:31:58] you guys can sing along with me if you
[1:31:59] want
[1:32:04] all right hello hello
[1:32:09] all right so then sings my soul
[1:32:15] my savior God sing along
[1:32:19] [Music]
[1:32:22] How Great Thou Art
[1:32:24] [Music]
[1:32:29] real big
[1:32:31] then sings my soul
[1:32:35] my savior God to thee
[1:32:42] How Great Thou Art
[1:32:47] how great thou all right good job
[1:32:58] I stopped playing when
[1:33:00] at the worst moment
[1:33:02] [Music]
[1:33:04] this cord right here is the tension it's
[1:33:08] the big it's the highest moment in the
[1:33:10] song How Great Thou
[1:33:16] if I stopped right there everybody go
[1:33:18] brother I what are you doing you're
[1:33:20] leaving us on the Cliffhanger right
[1:33:23] crying out for resolve
[1:33:25] [Music]
[1:33:27] they call that the root note it takes
[1:33:30] you back to the root of the song so
[1:33:33] there's times when there's going to be
[1:33:35] tension and there's going to be moments
[1:33:37] where you're working towards something
[1:33:38] and it's going to call for some resolve
[1:33:42] to come back to some calmness God will
[1:33:44] always allow the music to come back to
[1:33:46] calmness so with Grace we go through the
[1:33:50] moments of tension
[1:33:51] we allow him to take us through the
[1:33:53] moments of attention because we have
[1:33:54] faith that he'll always bring us back to
[1:33:56] our root amen amen amen
[1:34:05] y'all sing a special this morning good
[1:34:07] job
[1:34:08] okay
[1:34:11] so
[1:34:12] final thoughts
[1:34:20] we all grow through different stages
[1:34:25] of our development spiritually and
[1:34:27] naturally this is natural typing the
[1:34:30] spiritual so to speak we're all babies
[1:34:31] and toddlers at some point in our lives
[1:34:34] for some of you for some of you it was a
[1:34:36] really long time ago I'm just kidding
[1:34:41] so there's one of my favorite books is
[1:34:43] this is back when I was in the business
[1:34:45] days uh there's a book that's called
[1:34:47] uh and he's a Christian man
[1:34:49] um The Seven Habits of Highly Effective
[1:34:52] People and one of the things he talks
[1:34:54] about in there is the maturity continuum
[1:34:57] and how we mature through life
[1:34:59] then he put he puts it in Stephen Covey
[1:35:02] he's the guy who wrote the book he puts
[1:35:03] it in three stages that I really love
[1:35:05] and I use this in my other training with
[1:35:07] the musicians and everything too
[1:35:08] these first couple stages that you see
[1:35:10] up there the babe and the toddler
[1:35:13] and maybe the first three stages is a
[1:35:15] state of dependence absolute dependence
[1:35:18] if you walk away from a baby when it's a
[1:35:20] baby and it's completely dependent on
[1:35:22] you for its substance it's life if you
[1:35:25] walked away from it it would perish it
[1:35:27] wouldn't be able to live
[1:35:28] a toddler probably the same thing
[1:35:31] the little kid there I think if you just
[1:35:33] dropped him off the side of the road and
[1:35:34] drove away he'd probably go knock on a
[1:35:37] door somewhere and he'd find a way to
[1:35:38] feed himself and and so forth Maybe
[1:35:41] but then you get to that stage in the
[1:35:42] middle there and you've entered into a
[1:35:45] new stage because you you start feeling
[1:35:48] good you get your first job and you get
[1:35:50] some experience under your belt and
[1:35:52] you're kind of going along and it's like
[1:35:53] wow I I can pay my own bills and this is
[1:35:55] where you usually see kids moving out
[1:35:57] from their parents house and a lot of
[1:35:59] times they're there's some tension there
[1:36:01] with that happening because not only the
[1:36:02] parent is having to get used to the idea
[1:36:04] that this kid is thinking on his own and
[1:36:06] he's not always thinking good thoughts
[1:36:07] he's not always doing the right thing
[1:36:08] but and you're watching this happen but
[1:36:10] you also watch the kid is also saying I
[1:36:13] have to do my own thing I have to break
[1:36:15] away from how my mom and dad did things
[1:36:17] and I have to begin to create my own
[1:36:19] life so there's this part of life that's
[1:36:22] called Independence it's absolutely
[1:36:23] necessary to get to the stage of
[1:36:26] Independence because if you didn't you
[1:36:28] would just stay dependent on your family
[1:36:30] all them years and we have some of those
[1:36:32] people some examples of those guys
[1:36:33] they're 40 years old and they're still
[1:36:35] living in their parents basement playing
[1:36:37] video games or whatever else
[1:36:39] nobody likes to deal with people like
[1:36:41] that we realized that they got they got
[1:36:44] stuck in a dependent stage and they
[1:36:46] didn't grow so it's not pretty when
[1:36:48] someone doesn't mature right
[1:36:50] so this person in the in in this middle
[1:36:53] stage the middle guys there they go
[1:36:55] through a stage there of Independence
[1:36:58] where they're making their own money
[1:36:59] they're buying their own cars in their
[1:37:01] own houses and they're making their
[1:37:03] bills all by themselves
[1:37:05] if they stay in the independent stage
[1:37:08] into the older years they tend to cause
[1:37:11] problems with relationships they they
[1:37:13] tend to hurt people's feelings a lot of
[1:37:16] times you find guys that end up getting
[1:37:17] divorced in these stages girls and guys
[1:37:19] because they stayed in an independent
[1:37:22] stage I'm My Own man I do things the way
[1:37:25] I do things nobody's going to tell me
[1:37:26] what to do nobody wants to mess with me
[1:37:28] because I've learned my way and a lot of
[1:37:30] times through hurts and pains and
[1:37:32] suffering that they've gone through
[1:37:33] they've let it
[1:37:35] give them thick skin and they've let it
[1:37:37] build up walls to where that this person
[1:37:40] hurt me this pastor hurt me this person
[1:37:42] hurt me I'll never let anybody have that
[1:37:45] place in my life again and they'll build
[1:37:47] a wall up and they'll say I'm going to
[1:37:49] be protected from this I'm My Own man
[1:37:51] nobody tells me what to do and they stay
[1:37:54] right there in their independent stage
[1:37:58] a lot of times these are the guys that
[1:37:59] are talking about the good old days
[1:38:00] they're 54 years old and they're still
[1:38:02] talking about the catch that they made
[1:38:04] in high school on the football team and
[1:38:07] they're bragging about man I was the
[1:38:08] best I still hold the state record for
[1:38:10] whatever you know
[1:38:12] and uh they're stuck right they're stuck
[1:38:14] in that stage because that was the
[1:38:16] moment that was their moment and nothing
[1:38:18] exciting has happened since then I want
[1:38:20] to ask them what what did you do last
[1:38:21] week you know did this anything has
[1:38:23] anything happened between them but they
[1:38:25] get stuck and they're latched on to that
[1:38:27] independent stage because they don't
[1:38:29] want anybody to hurt them and they don't
[1:38:31] want anybody to take over
[1:38:32] but the real mature person will grow
[1:38:35] beyond that independent stage into
[1:38:36] something called interdependence or
[1:38:38] interdependence
[1:38:40] and uh it looks like this you grow from
[1:38:43] dependence where you say you you do it
[1:38:46] for me
[1:38:47] to Independence where I do it
[1:38:51] and then you grow to an interdependent
[1:38:53] stage where you say we will do this
[1:38:55] together
[1:38:55] and so when we're talking about the
[1:38:57] ministry of helps and I promise that's
[1:38:59] all the business psychology that I'll
[1:39:02] talk about but when we talk about the
[1:39:03] Ministry of Health we talk about
[1:39:04] spiritual growth into maturity it's the
[1:39:07] same situation here where we grow from
[1:39:09] we're just a baby in Christ and we're
[1:39:11] dependent upon I need to talk to people
[1:39:13] I need the pastor to pray for me I need
[1:39:16] this and I need this in a very needed
[1:39:18] time and a dynamic and functional Body
[1:39:22] of Christ
[1:39:23] will minister to all three of these
[1:39:26] stages
[1:39:27] there'll be people that are babies in
[1:39:28] Christ at the same sitting in the same
[1:39:30] Pew sitting down the road from you will
[1:39:32] be somebody who's in the independent
[1:39:34] stage I realize now I can read the Bible
[1:39:36] God can give me Revelation on things I
[1:39:39] feel really good about this but they
[1:39:41] didn't grow they maybe don't stop
[1:39:45] or they do stop before they get to the
[1:39:48] interdependent stage which means we are
[1:39:50] a body
[1:39:51] with an understanding this may be the
[1:39:53] biggest understanding that you have to
[1:39:55] have your actions and your thoughts will
[1:39:59] affect everybody in this room
[1:40:02] you are not independent
[1:40:04] you're not no matter what you want if
[1:40:06] you want to act independent if you want
[1:40:08] to say nobody else I'm not letting
[1:40:10] anybody into my little bubble you can
[1:40:11] say that all you want to but you will
[1:40:13] not mature in Christ or in natural
[1:40:16] things until you get to the place where
[1:40:19] you realize I am part of a body of
[1:40:21] Believers I am part of a community I am
[1:40:23] part of a country I'm part of a family
[1:40:25] and when those things that's why I love
[1:40:27] that you guys have the name the word
[1:40:29] family and the title of the church
[1:40:31] because family is something that
[1:40:33] uh you know you may hate each other from
[1:40:36] time to time it's like all right this
[1:40:38] drive me crazy but it's family and it's
[1:40:42] like this we're gonna stick together no
[1:40:44] matter what if somebody gives us trouble
[1:40:45] we might fight in the backyard but when
[1:40:47] we come out we're we're united front
[1:40:49] we're together so the maturity the the
[1:40:52] higher level of maturity is get to the
[1:40:54] point where you start to realize that
[1:40:55] every action whether you hear or not
[1:40:57] whether you're at work or not wherever
[1:40:58] you are in your private life and in your
[1:41:02] public life everything that you do will
[1:41:05] affect this body spiritually because you
[1:41:09] are connected to the body of Christ
[1:41:11] very very important lesson
[1:41:14] we are together
[1:41:17] when things go well or when things go
[1:41:19] wrong we're together
[1:41:21] criticism damages the whole body
[1:41:26] when one hurts or when one is in glory
[1:41:30] or when one is
[1:41:31] having great times we all have great
[1:41:34] times we Rejoice with one another
[1:41:36] and when somebody's had going through a
[1:41:38] hard time
[1:41:39] we put ourselves right there in that
[1:41:41] magazine we go with them right
[1:41:43] criticizing damages the entire body
[1:41:47] and sometimes we frame up criticism in
[1:41:50] well I'm just trying to correct a
[1:41:52] problem in the body I'm just trying to
[1:41:53] correct a problem that I see in that
[1:41:55] person's life
[1:41:56] Okay so
[1:41:58] I've
[1:41:59] I don't know that I've read every word
[1:42:02] in the Bible I probably have once or
[1:42:05] twice
[1:42:06] I look everywhere and I really don't see
[1:42:07] that unless God lays something on your
[1:42:09] heart that there's some kind of
[1:42:11] Correction if somebody's not looking for
[1:42:13] asking for your opinion then you you if
[1:42:16] you're going to go to them with
[1:42:17] correction it better be drenched in love
[1:42:20] it better be drenched in purpose hey I
[1:42:24] saw you doing this and listen uh I went
[1:42:27] through this and I just I love you and I
[1:42:30] you know I wouldn't want you to be hurt
[1:42:31] and I realize that you're not me you
[1:42:34] know what I mean it's just making sure
[1:42:36] it's done the right way because if
[1:42:37] you're going in any way and you're
[1:42:40] you're touching someone who's an open or
[1:42:42] a raw nerve at a moment at a certain
[1:42:43] time
[1:42:44] then you're you're walking on thin ice
[1:42:47] for two reasons number one you could
[1:42:49] hurt the person themselves
[1:42:51] but God is dealing with that person
[1:42:53] actively moving that person along in the
[1:42:56] con in the maturity Continuum at some
[1:42:59] point and if You Hinder the work that
[1:43:01] God is doing because you feel like that
[1:43:03] you have the authority to go and make a
[1:43:06] correction I'm going to take a list of
[1:43:08] quotes over to this sister because I
[1:43:09] think she's doing this or I'm going to
[1:43:11] take this over to this brother because
[1:43:13] I'm going to correct that person
[1:43:14] if you've got to talk to the pastor
[1:43:17] about something like that maybe do that
[1:43:18] but we somehow have got it in our minds
[1:43:22] that there's a reward for finding fault
[1:43:24] right
[1:43:26] that's true there's no award show coming
[1:43:28] that's going to give you some statue
[1:43:31] because you figured out what was wrong
[1:43:33] in somebody else's life
[1:43:35] there's no reward for finding fault
[1:43:37] there's no reward for you correcting in
[1:43:40] fact there's no precedent for you as a
[1:43:41] body of Christ for you as a person in
[1:43:43] the body to feel like you need to take
[1:43:46] it upon yourself to go correct somebody
[1:43:47] else's life we love one another
[1:43:51] whatever stage we are we support one
[1:43:54] another if someone asked for help we're
[1:43:56] there if they don't ask for help and we
[1:43:58] think they need help we start on our
[1:44:00] knees for that person
[1:44:01] we pray for them and we stay there with
[1:44:03] them and we've had we're here for you
[1:44:05] what do you need what can we help with
[1:44:06] okay it's a completely different concept
[1:44:09] than what the world than than what
[1:44:11] denominationalism says where we're not
[1:44:13] going to have that in this church boy
[1:44:15] we're not going to have somebody
[1:44:15] representing that around here we're
[1:44:17] going to clean house
[1:44:19] my
[1:44:20] legalism
[1:44:22] so criticism damages the entire body
[1:44:25] criticism of the pastor criticism of
[1:44:27] pastor's wife criticism of
[1:44:30] anybody within the body damages legalism
[1:44:32] is self-righteousness
[1:44:36] what it is and it is poison to the
[1:44:38] entire body if we let it it will poison
[1:44:40] the entire body
[1:44:43] legalism is
[1:44:45] is you thinking that you're living on a
[1:44:48] little bit higher level than that person
[1:44:49] over there and you may be that might be
[1:44:52] the truth it's none of your business
[1:44:55] because God is moving that person too
[1:44:58] and you're moving the right direction so
[1:45:00] if you do feel like you're on a level
[1:45:01] then go to that person and say I love
[1:45:04] you I love you right where you're at and
[1:45:07] I pray that you love me back pray for me
[1:45:09] I'll be praying for you if you ever need
[1:45:11] anything let me know I'm happy to help
[1:45:13] you but for you to take the the legalist
[1:45:16] mentality would be like I've been where
[1:45:18] you're at buddy I've been there and I
[1:45:20] won and I've I'm I'm over it now or
[1:45:23] whatever and it's cut it's how you
[1:45:25] approach these things can be the
[1:45:27] difference of life and death you're
[1:45:30] because your existence and because your
[1:45:32] spiritual walk is so connected to the
[1:45:34] other believers if you were to go and do
[1:45:36] something that would harm that person
[1:45:38] it's like drinking poison yourself
[1:45:40] you're hurting yourself because that's a
[1:45:42] connected part of the body of Christ you
[1:45:44] wouldn't go and say oh man I've got a
[1:45:47] sliver in my finger I hate that give me
[1:45:49] a knife I'm going to cut this finger off
[1:45:52] you just wouldn't do it this is my body
[1:45:55] I'm not going to hurt myself because a
[1:45:56] sliver hurt me or because I'm hurting at
[1:45:59] that moment you just wouldn't do that
[1:46:01] you're not going to amputate
[1:46:03] right so why would we go to a member of
[1:46:05] the body of Christ and say listen you
[1:46:08] need to get this right in your life and
[1:46:09] I've been there and you you got to watch
[1:46:11] out for this and that because it's and
[1:46:14] it's just this harshness that comes from
[1:46:16] if there's a right way to do this
[1:46:18] interdependence is maturity that will
[1:46:20] keep you from saying many many things
[1:46:24] the right mental attitude will also do a
[1:46:26] couple of things having that maturity
[1:46:28] and that interdependence will will many
[1:46:31] many many times close your mouth
[1:46:34] it'll have you saying less than you've
[1:46:36] ever said I just this has been my
[1:46:39] experience and it's been my experience
[1:46:40] as I fellowship with other people that
[1:46:42] are growing to this maturity level you
[1:46:44] find yourself talking less and less and
[1:46:46] less and there are things that you have
[1:46:47] to be self-aware of my friends there are
[1:46:50] things you have to be self-aware because
[1:46:51] there are times when you're going
[1:46:53] through certain things you're having a
[1:46:55] certain time at work or something like
[1:46:57] that where you're going to give yourself
[1:46:58] license to be in a certain mood or to
[1:47:01] say certain things to people around you
[1:47:03] and you're going to feel like you give
[1:47:04] that license because I've been hurt in
[1:47:06] this situation there are women that are
[1:47:08] going to go through stages of life and
[1:47:10] menopause and things like that and you
[1:47:13] there's some irrational
[1:47:16] thought processes that happen in those
[1:47:18] times it's a very difficult time of life
[1:47:19] so during those times you have to Bridle
[1:47:23] your tongue
[1:47:24] you have to it's just a hard thing to do
[1:47:26] and guys go through it just as much as
[1:47:29] the girls do it's not a it's not a girl
[1:47:31] or a woman or a man thing necessarily
[1:47:35] bridling the tongue is the ultimate
[1:47:39] battle to be won
[1:47:41] is trying to keep those things from
[1:47:43] going on now there's tons of stimulus
[1:47:45] that's coming
[1:47:47] stimuli they call it or whatever but
[1:47:49] there's tons of things that are
[1:47:50] happening to you all the time and
[1:47:51] there's thoughts flying over your head
[1:47:53] like brother Brandon said you the the
[1:47:55] the fly over your head but you can't let
[1:47:57] him make a nest right
[1:48:00] so on any given day if you can imagine
[1:48:02] that the entire world is influencing me
[1:48:05] and buffering up against me constantly
[1:48:07] and then I take this information in I
[1:48:11] have a decision to make do I pass that
[1:48:14] information on to everybody down from me
[1:48:17] or do I make it stop right there
[1:48:20] just because something terrible is
[1:48:22] happening to you and just because
[1:48:23] something terrible is being told to you
[1:48:25] and you have information about something
[1:48:28] doesn't mean that you have to move it
[1:48:30] you can act let your mind act as a
[1:48:32] filter
[1:48:33] because
[1:48:34] like the scripture says think on things
[1:48:36] that are good think on things that are
[1:48:38] holy think I think so when it hits that
[1:48:40] filter and you're like
[1:48:41] as a believer in Christ I'm not going to
[1:48:44] let that pass on this is how this is how
[1:48:46] this is how you kill uh the the spirit
[1:48:49] of rumors
[1:48:51] it happened hey did you hear about this
[1:48:53] this is what I heard about
[1:48:55] really you heard about that
[1:48:57] oh
[1:48:58] walk away
[1:49:00] okay walk away uh because we're Rumor
[1:49:03] Mill is dependent on you passing the
[1:49:08] rumor on but if you filter it out and
[1:49:10] you stop the rumor right there
[1:49:13] it doesn't continue on
[1:49:15] you do you're not obligated to have a
[1:49:18] reaction to all of the action that's
[1:49:20] happening to you you're not obligated to
[1:49:22] pass any of that along
[1:49:24] you can filter it out and say whatever
[1:49:26] Things Are Holy whatever things are just
[1:49:28] whatever things are of good report
[1:49:32] I'm going to meditate on those things
[1:49:34] and when the bad report comes I'm going
[1:49:36] to flush it out and I'm going to
[1:49:38] continue to speak faith and love on this
[1:49:41] side
[1:49:42] so filter out those things
[1:49:43] interdependent and getting to a place of
[1:49:45] maturity
[1:49:46] so that your actions you know that
[1:49:49] they're going to affect the body of
[1:49:50] Christ will filter out a lot of those
[1:49:52] things from your conversation
[1:49:54] our primary function as a body of Christ
[1:49:57] is to love one another it's your primary
[1:50:00] function Above All Things
[1:50:02] your primary function as a body is to
[1:50:05] love one another very good the spirit of
[1:50:08] God is alive and well and can speak for
[1:50:11] himself
[1:50:14] some people don't like this but the when
[1:50:16] Jesus died on the cross
[1:50:19] three days later rose again
[1:50:21] so was he dead or alive at that point
[1:50:24] he was alive again he was no longer dead
[1:50:27] hasn't been dead since then and isn't
[1:50:30] dead now
[1:50:31] he walked out of there he went to the
[1:50:33] Mount Transfiguration and was
[1:50:36] taken into heaven
[1:50:38] dead or alive
[1:50:41] then
[1:50:43] in the book of Acts
[1:50:45] divided up his spirit and sent it on 120
[1:50:48] Believers in the upper room dead or
[1:50:50] alive
[1:50:51] in Dead or Alive beings alive
[1:50:56] still alive
[1:50:58] still communicating still talking still
[1:51:00] delivering his love still delivering his
[1:51:02] word still alive but for some reason
[1:51:04] nowadays people have forgotten that he
[1:51:06] can speak for himself
[1:51:09] he can speak to you and he can put an
[1:51:12] influence in your life and he can do
[1:51:14] things he can he can put things together
[1:51:16] let's let God continue to be our our
[1:51:20] director
[1:51:21] let him direct trust that his spirit is
[1:51:24] going to lead you into all things
[1:51:27] amen love one another trust the spirit
[1:51:29] of God to be a leader for you
[1:51:32] uh we are together correction must be
[1:51:35] drenched in love and purpose it really
[1:51:38] should if you're going to make a
[1:51:39] correction I would talk to the pastor
[1:51:41] about it I would talk to some other
[1:51:42] people about it and then when you go
[1:51:45] tremendous amount of Love humility and
[1:51:48] and purpose listen I I man I love you
[1:51:52] and I see this thing and I just want to
[1:51:54] uh you know what what do you need from
[1:51:56] me how can I help you and is there
[1:51:58] anything I can do you know
[1:52:00] just drenched in love and purpose
[1:52:04] we are together now and for always
[1:52:07] sometimes we forget that we're not going
[1:52:09] to spend Sunday and Wednesdays with
[1:52:12] these people we're going to spend
[1:52:14] eternity together
[1:52:16] so preparing ourselves for that eternity
[1:52:18] together means we better get used to one
[1:52:20] another
[1:52:22] and used to the idea that
[1:52:24] boy there are some personalities that
[1:52:26] just don't match up there's there's a
[1:52:28] couple I'm not going to say their names
[1:52:29] but there's a couple guys in the church
[1:52:31] that we don't have a lot in common as
[1:52:34] much as we would try we don't have a lot
[1:52:36] in common so we sit in a room for a few
[1:52:38] minutes and we talk about the things
[1:52:39] that we have in common and then it's
[1:52:40] like well we just better talk about the
[1:52:42] Lord because there's nothing else we got
[1:52:43] right and uh so we're not going to be
[1:52:46] Bosom Buddies it's not that you're going
[1:52:47] to be like this is my best friend ever
[1:52:49] you may not have those type of people
[1:52:52] that are within the body right there by
[1:52:54] you you might have some of them who
[1:52:56] knows you might you might develop good
[1:52:58] relationships with them I don't think
[1:52:59] you should require that of every
[1:53:00] relationship that's in the body and
[1:53:02] you'll be fake about it but you
[1:53:05] certainly have common ground in the fact
[1:53:08] that you are the pot you are the body
[1:53:10] and I am part of the body and we want
[1:53:13] what's good for one another because when
[1:53:14] you're healthy I'm healthy and so I'm
[1:53:18] connected to it so you say this in your
[1:53:20] mind to and I say this to all of you as
[1:53:22] uh as part of the body
[1:53:26] of Christ with you I want you to know
[1:53:29] that I am committed to your success I'm
[1:53:33] committed to you
[1:53:35] being on the other side of Glory with me
[1:53:37] I'm committed to the work that you're
[1:53:39] going to do for the Lord you have my
[1:53:41] complete commitment in what you do for
[1:53:43] the Lord and your everyday walk and when
[1:53:45] you walk into work I'm I'm right there
[1:53:48] with you I'm committed to you I'm part
[1:53:50] of the body with you wherever you go
[1:53:53] you've got me with you I'm backing you
[1:53:55] up and you've got him with you
[1:53:57] everywhere you go you never have to go
[1:53:58] anywhere alone again ever you never have
[1:54:01] to go through a pain or a suffering
[1:54:02] without all by yourself
[1:54:04] my prayers my strength if you just let
[1:54:07] me know or let somebody in this body
[1:54:08] know we're right there we are together
[1:54:12] and if this if we can just get that
[1:54:14] mentality then the tasks whatever we
[1:54:16] choose to do and I I've tried my very
[1:54:19] best not to come here and articulate a
[1:54:21] bunch of ideas of things that you can do
[1:54:23] because if you get this right if you get
[1:54:26] the mentality right then God will lay on
[1:54:28] your heart whatever this vision is here
[1:54:30] and as that vision is articulated by the
[1:54:33] pastor and by the Holy Spirit as that
[1:54:35] vision is there if you have this right
[1:54:38] and you're together as a body of
[1:54:39] Believers the wheels start to move and
[1:54:42] it's really really exciting and really
[1:54:44] enjoyable so I really pray and and hope
[1:54:47] that that this is a help to you
[1:54:50] and I just pray that you guys will be
[1:54:52] just as dynamic as you possibly can here
[1:54:54] and I love you very much
[1:54:56] and brother John I'll just turn it back
[1:54:58] over to you God bless y'all I have
[1:55:00] enjoyed this
[1:55:02] [Applause]
[1:55:10] I absolutely love that
[1:55:16] that was so practical
[1:55:19] practical
[1:55:21] and
[1:55:22] one of the hardest things
[1:55:25] is learning to work together it is so
[1:55:28] easy to figure out what's right what's
[1:55:31] wrong who's right who's wrong
[1:55:33] but there is a lacking in that maturity
[1:55:36] of how to fix
[1:55:39] how to take what's wrong
[1:55:41] and in love take care of it
[1:55:45] to as our brother was speaking there in
[1:55:47] Galatians chapter six if you see a
[1:55:49] brother overtaken fall you which are
[1:55:50] spiritual go to him in the spirit of
[1:55:52] meekness he taken the right spirit with
[1:55:54] you because and the purpose the purpose
[1:55:57] is to restore sometimes we're just we're
[1:55:59] so bothered at what they did to us
[1:56:03] that we just want to crack that thing
[1:56:04] because I'm hurt and you bypass
[1:56:07] the way to help restore
[1:56:10] and so
[1:56:12] I believe we heard
[1:56:15] from the Lord without doubt without
[1:56:18] question I'm looking forward to part
[1:56:21] three
[1:56:24] so I hope he starts working on it and
[1:56:27] come back
[1:56:28] because
[1:56:30] we need this we need this and we we need
[1:56:35] to start
[1:56:37] implement it take take what you feel is
[1:56:40] lacking in your life and just start
[1:56:43] working on that part
[1:56:44] wherever you're at on on the thing
[1:56:46] because I like what our brother said if
[1:56:48] we just get the mentality right
[1:56:51] if we get the functioning right well
[1:56:54] then whatever God would ask us to do
[1:56:57] I mean it wouldn't be a surprise if to
[1:57:00] me what our brother said wouldn't be a
[1:57:01] surprise if God asked us to do something
[1:57:03] out of her wheelhouse something that
[1:57:05] we're not comfortable we're doing
[1:57:07] I just want God to have his way and most
[1:57:12] of the time
[1:57:13] God can't have his way because we're in
[1:57:16] the way we think it should be done like
[1:57:18] this or that's the pastor's job or or
[1:57:20] you know that wouldn't happen if they
[1:57:21] wouldn't have done that you know before
[1:57:23] you know it we got a bunch of but a
[1:57:26] group of people that don't know how to
[1:57:27] handle things
[1:57:29] and we don't want that this was to help
[1:57:32] us
[1:57:33] to function
[1:57:35] the way that we should and I believe
[1:57:37] that this this was from the Lord this
[1:57:40] was so practical and this was really
[1:57:43] what we needed
[1:57:45] and I I just pray that we all
[1:57:48] can have this yearning to have this kind
[1:57:52] of unity and love to work together in
[1:57:57] the kingdom of God and and not have so
[1:58:00] much of an independent Spirit about well
[1:58:02] we're going to do it my way and this is
[1:58:04] the way I see it we got too much of that
[1:58:06] we we're stuck in that middle Zone
[1:58:10] we get I love that word I wrote it down
[1:58:13] interdependence that's where the
[1:58:15] maturity is at I love it God bless you
[1:58:18] let's stay in together
[1:58:19] we're really really appreciated that
[1:58:23] message amen let's just bow on a word of
[1:58:25] prayer Heavenly Father Lord we thank you
[1:58:27] for your precious word today
[1:58:31] Lord our our brother made mention
[1:58:35] that this is
[1:58:37] out of his wheelhouse to bring
[1:58:41] this word to us
[1:58:43] what an example for all of us
[1:58:46] to be able to be used
[1:58:48] in a way that we're not
[1:58:51] thinking
[1:58:53] and God we just want to thank you
[1:58:56] for the willingness
[1:59:00] that you put on brother Ike's heart to
[1:59:02] to come here and to help us
[1:59:06] without that willingness Lord we
[1:59:08] wouldn't have what we have today we
[1:59:11] wouldn't have been able to hear
[1:59:13] and Lord we just pray that you would
