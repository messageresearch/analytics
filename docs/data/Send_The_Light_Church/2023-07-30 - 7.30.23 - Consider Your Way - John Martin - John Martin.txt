you are beautiful oh sure yes go ahead we've been we've had many troubles over the years but we always came back amen I was thinking yesterday I thought that when I get into the scriptures and I read about humans I I dare to enter into little things in the spirit of God amen I feel I'm right here amen you know you know we drop into that channel that's right that you can do it yeah when you read screen scriptures get in there spirit of God is upon him it's his word get close to it make it real in your life amen like you're actually going through that equipment praise the Lord 84 years old thanks so much oh yes so much okay okay I want to tell you people how much I love you you are so precious every single one of you I just love you I thank you for this family I love you Flawless enter into the spirit of the word even as our brother said in Hague chapter one hey guy chapter one if you're turning there this morning because I know you're turning there you brought your Bible right amen um brother Jason Demars is traveling to Egypt today for a mission trip he covets our prayers and then afterwards he's going to Israel so he specifically contacted us for the church to be praying for his trip there let's let's pray that God prospers it amen amen and before we begin reading let's look too little Lord in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for your family we thank you for your spirit that makes us Brothers and Sisters in Christ and that brings us into the family of God and father we thank you for the work that you started in us that you're you're never going to give up you're never going to leave us you're never going to forsake us you promise to be with us to the end and we just we thank you for this example Lord that you have sent even in in brother and sister Beckman being together these many years Lord and followed as our brother had said when he reads the scriptures he wants to enter into the spirit of the scriptures and now Lord we're asking before we read these that your spirit would be upon each one of us Lord we know that we're all perhaps indifferent uh areas with you you're dealing with us about different things but you're able to take the word of God this morning and help us along our journey we just pray that you would anoint each in every ear and each and every heart in each and every spirit Lord we pray that you anoint our lips learn how hard to to speak only those things Lord that you have spoken today and we'll give you the praise the honor for Lord as you give Glory through each and every one of our Lives now in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen amen chapter 1 verse 1 in the second year of Darius King in the sixth month and the first day of the month came the word of the Lord by hagiah the prophet anchaz Kia governor of Judah and Joshua the son of Josh deck the high priest saying thus saith the Lord host the Lord of all saying this people say the time is not come the time that the Lord's House should be built then came the word of the Lord by haggai the prophet saying is it time for you oh ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this house like waste now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts consider your ways you have so much in bringing little you eat but yet not enough you drink but you're not filled with drink eat clothe you but there's none warm and he that Earth wages Earth wages are put into a bay with holes thus saith the Lord of hosts consider your ways go up to the uh to the mountain and bring wood and build the house and I will take pleasure on it and I will be glorified saith Lord know this what God wants he wants to be glorified ye look for much and loyal it came to too little and when he brought it home I did blow upon it why saith the Lord of hosts because of my house that is is waste and you run every man onto his own house therefore the heaven over you is stayed from you and the Earth has stayed from her fruit and I have called for a drop upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle and upon of all that labor of the hands amen God bless you may be seated may the Lord bless this word to our hearts today want to title this message consider your ways and for a subject I could be wrong you know we read these scriptures we say boy I don't know if this is going to be a feel good service it's it's the word of God the word of God should make us feel good amen amen I believe it's a good reminder for us to to consider our ways ever been driving and got lost have you ever been driving miss your exit perhaps you didn't consider something amen what about uh I know when brother Marty we go out to a restaurant he needs to consider what's on the menu what he's going to order because they can't have any shellfish in it so you got to consider or your boss you got to consider your boss because if he has a a a a tire to see a policy that you can't be targeted too many times you need to pay attention to how many times you're late you need to consider that amen children children need to consider their parents right what their rules are and to consider their ways or else they're going to get in trouble earlier this week I uh after I you know everybody take showers and baths and you can you clean your hair or you you wash your hair your body and well I I sometimes use conditioner in my hair sometimes I just use the one that has a conditioner and the soap but I had the one that was separate and so I washed got other sour dried and put my clothes on looked in the mirror and I remembered that I did not wash the conditioner out of my hair yeah and it's already dressed I I did not consider my waist sometimes you just get going so fast and like you're thinking about what you're going to be doing you get your day already started have done in your mind before you're under the shower right right I believe we need to consider our ways amen so here is this group of people they were believers and their life was consumed with themselves they made sure that their houses were all taking care of their families were all taking care of the things that they had in mind were all taken care of but what was really ironic about this is that when the Lord had tried telling them to put God first right they kept the attitude that it wasn't time to build God's kingdom it wasn't time to build God's house even after the word of the Lord came to them and then God said consider your ways consider your ways and finally he said because you're not considering your ways because you're so consumed with yourself I am going to stop the blessings from coming right here amen amen and God has every right to do that the Bible says that he's able to make all grace abound to you and he's able to hold things back right so I think this is a good word for us to consider our ways amen amen it's not a you're bad you're wrong but it's like the prophet said we need to have the attitude I could be wrong I could be seeing this wrong I could be not putting God first amen we think of the the probably the most important thing to think about is the destination of our soul Jesus asked the question provoking mankind to consider his voice he says for what uh is a man's Advantage if you gain everything gain the whole world and lose himself right be a casterly amen he's getting man to consider everything amen yes in this age that we're living in the love of many is waxing cold right in fact their love is being turned more towards themselves to where the believer now the believer that goes to church is a lover of himself more than a lover of God a lover of pleasure more than a lover of God Amen and I just wondered do we need to consider our ways amen amen yes sir I think it's I said a good question first man was born with the mindset that follows the devil that's true Amen in this aspect the devil was created to do the will of God right and after thousands and thousands of years with the mindset of just doing God's will he decided to start doing his own will right right well it was at that moment he thought his will was just as good as gods and in fact even better because you could kind of do what you wanted to do I will taught my throne above the Throne of God I will be late the most high my will is just as good as God's will the Bible says that Satan drew a third of the Angels of heaven with him right he even taught Eve to do her own will and he calls the fall right amen amen so Satan fell authority of the Angels fell Eve fell and every man that's been born since that time has been born with a fallen nature of doing his own will right amen man is born with the mindset to do his own will and that's why Jesus said ye must be born again for what purpose not just to be born again but to be born to do the will of God Amen the Brandon said the message influence he says and a man is a failure to begin with right I don't care who he is he is born in sin shapen and iniquity come into the world speaking lies so he's a total failure that's right amen I don't care if he's a bishop a pope a presbyter or whatever he might be he's a failure to begin with and I don't and don't never look to one [Music] he says though he moves mountains with faith and though he gives all his Goods to feed the poor still look at the Lord Jesus Christ not at some man God uses man everybody's following somebody truly right truth and Paul said follow me as I follow Christ but that doesn't mean that he was telling everybody to look to him right just making a stipulation as I'm leading you to Christ follow it amen and if I decide to preach any other gospel then that for don't listen to me all right that's right so we got to understand the balance here so brother Brandon says continue on find now that he was showing here what a servant of God must be right how he must be humble he must be reverent and in action in other words he must be displaying a life man he says go into action many of us can be humble many of us can be relevant but it's hard to get them into action action manifestation right damn it so I want to consider a ways this is one of the hardest things to do why is that because we have an inherited nature that we're always right right the scripture says Proverbs 21 verse 2 says every way of a man is right in his own eyes let the Lord Ponder at the hearts amen so because of this inherited nature it's very hard for us to sit here and consider our ways it's true because there's something inside of us that's working and says no I'm right I know I'm right and everything I do everything I say everything that I look at feel that we're right but we need to consider our ways amen our very nature thinks it's right to begin with even when it's wrong you ever been in a fight with somebody in your life your husband and you know you're wrong but you won't give in come on do you know what I'm talking about it's a reality it's the nature it thinks it knows the will of God when it doesn't it thinks it's ready for the Rapture when it's not it thinks it's right to judge others when it's wrong it thinks it's right to predict the future when it's wrong because the scripture teaches us not to do that it thinks it's right being consumed with its own life what God wants us to build the kingdom of God now that's our opening scripture amen amen why would I need to consider my ways because our nature default is to think it's right all the time it's called Pride and it reminded me like in the Book of Judges it says in those days there was no king in Israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes and often times I've seen Believers doing what they want to do and I just wonder if the king is missing um if the king is ready missing in their life just like it was in the Book of Judges there was no king in Israel and sometimes people don't really have the king of king and the Lord of lords in their life having the preeminence and they're just doing what they want to do and they're making reasons and excuses for why they do what they do and why they don't do what they don't do amen amen too many people are taking on the profession of Christianity But continuing to do their own will that's right amen right right that's that Christianity amen getting people to consider their ways is one of the hardest things to do especially for a believer the truth I think it's one of the hardest jobs of the Holy Ghost is to get people to see that they're wrong Jesus said in John 16 12 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear it now right why couldn't they bear it because I don't want to do anything different than what I want to do and if you put too much on me I'm about to handle it you know what I love about God he promised not to put anything on us that we couldn't bear but how many times were asked to do something from the pulpit they listen to a tape or read the Bible some brother sister tells us something and we just anymore true that's too much I'm not ready yet who are you to say if you're ready or not ready right when God the Holy Spirit would not put anything on me that you couldn't bear you've got to have faith in the word of God amen amen verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth in other words he's going to show you where you're wrong that's how he's going to guide you know he's not going to show you it that is not saying you're gonna you're you're all truth and he's going to give you more truth that's not the job of the Holy Ghost the job of the Holy Ghost is going to show you where you're wrong yes amen amen he's going to reprove he's going to rebuke he's going to he's going to show you in your nature because it's a personal thing of what needs to be dealt with so God is moving in our lives to lead us into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself it's not about the cell but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come I don't know how many times God has has warned me and showed me things to come and I didn't take heed to it I paid for it amen God is faithful to set warning before judgments right he's faithful to show you things to come it isn't all about you know prophecy and this is going to happen show you this I'm not saying that doesn't exist but I mean I'll tell you there's a lot more time God warns us about something and we don't do it then he ever shows us about some great thing that's going to happen before it happens amen amen that's the truth amen I say one of the hardest jobs of the Holy Ghost is they get people to see that they're wrong you ever identified somebody as a hard head okay right thick skull can't get something into them they just won't listen I think Humanity when God is trying to deal with us there's there's a Hardness of Heart that keeps us from just giving God his way amen amen I I you know God is not obligated to give us his word exactly the way you want it that's for sure amen we do not tell God how to do things right he gave you a five-fold Ministry 89 . Proverbs 14 12 says there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death so here it is just Naturally Speaking there we have this mindset of thinking this is the right way did you ever have the truth about something that you had a bad attitude about it right come on this is one of the ways which seems right unto a man right but at the end is death amen and then would you just focus so much that you're right that you don't even care and pay attention in your spirit right right so it's a way that seems right unto the man but it's not yeah wrong Spirits are always the way of death amen amen here the devil uses the word he's the word and Jesus he uses the word on us how many times does the devil tell you oh you know you're a Believer you don't have to follow those instructions it's true you're going to heaven you don't have to worry about that amen gives you parts otherwise is I'd rather have the right spirit and be wrong in my doctrine that means how I'm looking at a certain situation then have the right doctor and be wrong in my spirit so the emphasis is what spirit's on you exactly right amen amen and too often we're staring at well trying to you know figure out what's right and wrong what's right is have God's spirit what's wrong is not to have God's spirit we need to say focus on that yes brother Brian says it's not the action but the reaction that counts amen God's gonna allow things to happen in our life but how are we going to react to them yes amen that reaction is really important to God because he's the one that allowed the action to take place so he's going to step back and see how you're going to react right and another brand and taught us to have a spirit now and an attitude of I could be wrong yes amen there's two ways I want to talk about it's in Matthew chapter seven thirteen and fourteen there are only two ways in life there's God's way and then there's the wrong way that's the two ways I wonder uh and did you get a chance to get that if we could put this on a board so this is what a I I did um oh and I'm so sorry I meant the picture honey yeah can you see that okay okay so this is what I don't got nothing to do and I'm laying on my bed at night I mean just read these scriptures now Matthew 7 and you we'll just leave that up there if we could enter again at the Straight Gate for wide as the gate and brought us away which leads to light which leads to destruction and many there be which ones they're at because straight is the gate Narrows the way which leadeth on to life but few be there that find it right with God's way the spirit will always be right and remember that went the wrong way something will always be wrong with the spirit amen so it's just easy to know so here we are I drew this heart because this is where it all stems from so straight As the gate Narrows away that leadeth unto life and to be that find it so I just got this white little strip that goes right up here but there's a way that seemed to be right unto man and you see these are going a little bit off on an angle a way that seemed to be right but the end of it is death and you'll see eventually something with the wrong Spirit going the wrong way is eventually going to go down all right yes amen that's why the heart is deceptive amen amen I got this big conclusion I just thought I mean that's what I thought I thought I was doing the right thing and it gets to be confusing right here you think you're right you're right you're right but you know you're not staying in the middle of the road you're not staying down the straight and narrow in other words I'm a Believer I can do this I don't have to worry about I'm giving what I can I'm doing what I can I'm I God's going to accept me the way I am something just not right with the spirit and we end up still serving God our own way but refusing to consider our ways refusing to consider the direction it might just go 90 right or am I staying right down the middle because eventually you know you get to a place where you don't even care anymore when a person don't care anymore they're going down because that's exactly what Satan had he had an I don't care spirit anymore God always wants man to consider his ways amen why do few people find the way the life you're supposed to like respond to that was a question because it's harder our nature is to find the easier Road true amen the way of that God does things is just harder and that's why few people find it they don't want to do that they don't want to have to turn the cheek again when somebody slapped them they don't have to go the Second Mile for somebody they don't want to be long-suffering and forbearing with one another they don't want to have to be interdependent work with somebody they don't want to Endeavor to keep Unity they don't want to keep forgiving others and I mean 490 times forget it I believe that there's a much easier gospel they don't want to have to keep they don't want to they rather just love their favorite love their enemy huh lay aside everything to you get it no this is why people are missing it because it's a harder way having to seek the kingdom of God first no I just give God what I have to having to esteem others better than ourselves having to deny ourselves and our will and our own reputation just denied like I'm nothing having to look on the things of others and forget about myself having to walk in the spirit and Worship in the spirit and pray in the spirit to pray without ceasing this is why people miss the straight narrow path this is why they're going to miss it having to go to church read God's word all the time meditate upon him all the Moors you see the day approaching having to humble myself and press towards the mark because God's way of living is much harder than living the way man wants to live is why only few people are going to find it that's the truth now Satan surely will also present to us that because we're in the message of the hour and we believe the message the other I've got the sticker I've got the badge I've got the it doesn't mean we're in the straight and narrow Jesus wants man to consider his ways amen that he could be wrong just because we're feeling like we're right it doesn't mean that we're right so who cares about how we feel amen I'm sure these these Believers in hegi thought they were they were right they wouldn't be doing it if they thought they were wrong so these two ways are you with me this morning you that are not saying amen can I get you just to enter in [Laughter] because I believe that God wants to help us consider something in our life I don't know what it is but God does so we got two ways one is the broad way of thinking and the devil just gets you all turned around in your way of thinking and the other way is straight narrow that's God's way and it never turns around from the truth notice when you get on this path it never turns around it doesn't deviate amen James chapter 1 verse 14. let's throw that up there James chapter 1 verse 14 with this thought in mind but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own desires see it's your desires that entice you then when lust have conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it's finished bringing forward death do not air my beloved Brethren every good and perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness no rheostat no no variableness in this neither is there a shadow of turning right God is not going to lead you a little off the path I'm sorry he won't do that never there's no chance of it of his own will be at he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures that's I want to go back to Matthew chapter 7 there and take a look at verse 15. we did uh 13 and 14. 15 says beware of false prophets verse 15 beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are raving wolves now here's the thing if all I have to do is worry that somebody comes up to me and says I'm a prophet I'm a prophet of God I gotta worry about that person right be careful I don't think that's what he's referring to do you false prophets are false Spirits which appear as brothers and sisters expressing to you that you don't need to go the straight narrow way that you really don't have to follow that to a T that isn't that important if it's you know everybody you know God understands see just trying to get you off of a perfectly straight Walk With Jesus Christ see Satan can use anybody not that I want Satan to use me but you know what just get a wrong Spirit on you Satan will be using you true none of us are exempt we need to be careful for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there be which going at see and if that heart there it showed you know you can go any any way you want to it doesn't matter either side it's Broad and you think you're going the right way you think it's okay you think it's straight now because there is some light you still feel this desire to serve God but there's something missing Proverbs 18 verse 12 says Before Destruction the heart of man is haughty right it leads to destruction right it leases Broadway leads to destruction Before Destruction the heart of man is haughty and before honor is humility we all want to be honored but we don't all want to be humble I I this is a I want to tell you this just in case you're questioning whether this word is a good word I'm going to tell you this is a good word this morning [Music] [Laughter] there was a a Catholic girl that went to Brother Brandon's Church once in a while she was a she had a cow she was a beautiful young girl 22 years old and one night she was in the back and she laughed at brother Branham and she said these words I wouldn't let my cow have that kind of religion he's got in less than an hour brother Branham was called to go to the hospital to pray for her the last words that she said before she died was call Brother Branham call that Preacher Brother random see there was a way that seemeth right unto man but at least a destruction Before Destruction is that Holy Spirit like oh I just got you know I don't have to listen to that he's so wrong he don't know what he's talking about that's all it takes that's all it takes I wouldn't give that religion to my cow I mean come on she never considered that she could be wrong she didn't consider a ways and there's a lot of ways in her life right we had a lot of things going on there's a lot of Dreams a lot of goals a lot of directions we're going lots of things we need to consider them and I'm going to say the thing I want to get to right now in this part of the service is is we need to break the cycle the way that we naturally think break the cycle with every way of a man is right in his own eyes we need to break that cycle if we don't break it we'll never sincerely consider we could be wrong I'll tell you one great thing that breaks the cycle is sincere humility it'll just break it right there on the spot an attitude of I could be wrong will break the cycle amen Proverbs 1 7 says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction despise it If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves see break that cycle we must put the clothes of humility back on because God resisted the proud gives grace to the humble now these people in haggai they were proud they didn't think it was time to give God anything we don't need to give the house of God anything more we don't need to build a church we don't need to go hunt for Souls we don't need to build God's Kingdom I'll tell you if God was coming back tomorrow are you happy with the decisions that you're making for today we need to Humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt Us in due time we need to break that cycle brother Brian said and God hiding himself in Simplicity he said if you you've got to let the mind of cry the mind that was in Christ be in you God dealing with man was has always been in humility he never does deal with men in uh great big theological terms tell me one time he ever did he never does He makes himself simple and man wants it to be complicated He makes himself great by making himself humble the more humble you could be the more I look up to you the more respect I have for you the more I honor you because that scripture before honor is humility true humility will break the cycle it will open the door for you to consider your ways that maybe you're not looking at things completely right Proverbs 22 verse 4 says by humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life who wouldn't see now here's the thing what the devil is presenting in a broad way is that you know you can get Rich's honor in life without humility and without the fear of God humility will help us to see how great a distance there is between God's way and our way Isaiah 58 55 verse 8 you don't have to turn there you know the scriptures for my thoughts are not your thoughts either my ways your ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth soar my ways higher than your ways there's a big distance and my thoughts than your thoughts brother Brown said in the Third Exodus he says the devil is real smart he's a shrewd bird he knows how to hit the thing before it even gets started he knows it see and the only thing that you can ever do to beat him is to rely on Christ amen [Music] and he didn't stop the sentence and humble yourself and let him lead you see you'll never do it any other way your intellectual Powers will never do it you've got to believe it and just rely on him because he is the shepherd all right Philippians chapter 2 verse one familiar scriptures here but I just wanted to show how sincere humility opens the door to break that cycle to get the mind of Christ and if you truly are sitting here today humble then you can relate to these scriptures this is how you feel inside of your heart right now if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of Love of any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and and mercies fulfill ye my joy that you be like-minded now this is what we all need to have in this church right now having the Same Love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through your Strife or your vain Glory but in lowliness of mine I'm nothing I'm nothing I believe what the prophet said a man at his very best is all vanity as the scripture says but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem the other person better than themselves you know what I'm I'm I'm still waiting to hear more of that kind of conversation I'm still waiting to see more of the mind of Christ being expressed amen some of us have a hard time handing out compliments some of us have a hard enough time to say you know it's a wonderful thing that you're working for the Lord come on I feel like I need to stay here and keep preaching this part because I only heard a few amens on that it's the mind of Christ amen look not every man on his own things my own house my own job my my my my my take some time but every man also on the things of others amen you know I'll tell you if you really want God to bless you start living for others well brother John I'm just not at a place where I can do that I am telling you if you've got breath in your lungs you got a beat in your heart it is time to do it now is the time to do it don't wait till you get your problems worked out because I guarantee you a year from now you're still going to have problems today is the day let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought of that robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation find a man who don't talk about himself and you find that man who's following Christ made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant I mean when you look and you ever look at somebody say Well they're just servant servant servant serving that's what Jesus did for us and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashionism man what did he do hey I did this no he humbled himself amen and he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God also have highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name I love the scriptures I take such comfort in the scriptures brother Brian said in the message Jesus Christ is saying yesterday to you forever he said he never made himself of any reputation right right did you ever think of that he made himself of no reputation the man that made an artificial tooth made a reputation for himself but the one that made the real tooth made um made of himself no reputation the man that made an artificial arm made a reputation for himself but the man who made the real arm made himself no reputation the Way Up Is Down always remember that be humble be sweet be kind be creative let Christ be in you oh I just love the word of God this morning in the message influence brother Brandon says we must be sincere because we've got the greatest thing in the world the greatest Treasure of Heaven is Christ Among Us think about that amen that's the greatest thing we can have so what do we do with that what do we do with this president he wants us to consider our ways he says why do you want a substitute of some little influence to try to make ourselves something big among somebody here why not be a humble servant of Christ if we've got the greatest thing that we could have which is Christ in our myth why would we want to spend any time trying to make ourselves big see it's better to have the right spirit forget what you know be humble be a servant Jesus himself said if you want to really be great be a servant of all right why did Brother Branham ask so many questions why did Jesus ask so many questions why did Paul ask so many questions James asked questions questions help us to consider our ways the spirit of God wants us to consider our ways amen even the Bible says try the spirit Proverbs 16 verse 7 when a man's ways I love this scripture when a man's ways pleased the Lord he make he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him [Music] wow in other words there's a way to handle things when man dedicates himself to going God's way and not the way that seemeth to be right amen then God will be pleased so please that he'll make your enemies to not bother you there'll still be your enemies but they'll be at Bay don't you love the word are you getting anything out of this and to you those of you that are not you still got a little bit more time amen let's consider our ways we all want to hear well done thou good and faithful servant Romans 12 verse 1 says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present we're still on humility breaking the cycle are you with me I beseech you therefore by the mercies of God that ye present your body a Living Sacrifice that's that's quite the servant wholly acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed in other words consider your ways by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God now I know there's some here that may look at this scripture is that God's got three different types of Wills personally for me I've never heard that in the message I know we heard the prophet talk about a permitted will of God God permitted Balaam to leave and go after his own heart's desire but God never accepted it so it wasn't the accepted will of God God permitted Ishmael to be born but he did not accept him into the Covenant everything that God created it wasn't he never said it's perfect everything that God created said it was good after everything he created in Genesis he said it was good I do remember that he he said when he created Lucifer he created him perfect but I'll just say it like this the only acceptable will of God is his is his will it's it's perfect it's acceptable and it's good and our job is to prove what is the perfect will of God for a life it starts with you in your home it starts you in your mind your your body and how you think what a thought you allow to think in your mind are you going to consider God's way are you just going to do what you want to do what you plan to do because I'm telling you one of these days you're going to get out of that shower and you're going to have a conditioner in your hair my word things are not going to go great brother Branham said in the message power transformation he said that's what we all want to do is to be conformed be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our mind to do the perfect and acceptable will of God this is what he said now that's what we have been now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Ghost as we have now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the Natural Things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation by God's spirit and by his word that's what we want we we don't want to we don't want to have some sort of negative feelings about the word that's being preached today right we want this word to transform us and say God this is you speaking to me you're speaking to me Lord and I want to be transformed I want to start doing I don't want to be assuming that I'm going through the course of the day in your will I mean I can wake up I can pray in the morning and I can say I'm going to go to trust or two and I'm going to work I trust it too that's my job I'm going to be in the will of God I'm sorry that doesn't mean you're in the will of job because you you well God because you wake up and you go to work there's more to life than that we've been born again to carry out the will of God that's our purpose brother Brandon send the message the spoken word The Original Seed he says you can't be a seed and disagree with the word you talk about a powerful statement you can't be a seed and disagree with the word because the word is the seed and if you are the word how can you disagree with it you would be disagreeing with yourself you'd be defeating your own purpose so the word is challenging us to consider our ways can we take a look at the benefits of choosing God's way for just a second all right this is for brother Mark because he said amen Amen brother thank you we just I'm telling you we got to get into the word Mark 10 28 the devil wants us to like be too relaxed Mark 10 28 says then Peter began to say unto him lol we have left all and follow thee well we know that Peter didn't quite realize that there was still part of him that needed to be filled with the Holy Ghost and Jesus answered and said verily I say unto you there is no man that have left house and Brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the Gospels but he shall receive a hundred fold now in this time in this time houses brother and sisters mothers and children lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life but many that shall and many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first you know what that means you know you can give up your life just sell out you don't get to do your will you don't get to get bring pleasure to yourself you can just lay your life down for the kingdom but you're going to receive great blessings on the other side or you can be first and take your life now do your will spend time building your dreams have little time for the kingdom of God the first shall be last and the last shall be first isn't that beautiful scripture amen love that scripture brother Brandon chose to go God's way he could have been very wealthy he could add a great name for himself a great reputation he was he was great among the religious world they wanted to do more for him but did you know brother Brandon did not choose the Easy Pass amen God allowed brother Branham to see beyond the curtain of time to catch a glimpse of Eternity and it was the first week in May of 1960. and he had this experience of perfect love many times before but in this experience it happened like he never experienced it before he said all that he heard a voice that said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you is going to be there and notice it was through Freemore agency this is what's really important Freemore agency this is what makes a paradox between predestination and free more agency all that you ever free morally loved and all that ever free loved you will be there not predestinated of course it's predestinated but notice it has to go through free more agency he had experienced a culmination of everything he preached because that voice said to him this is what you preached it was the Holy Ghost and he heard a voice that said and you shall you shall be judged for everything that you preached to the people and he got kind of scared you know sitting in church and you know just like oh that's a hard one he says well is Mark going to have to be preached I mean is Mark going to have to be judged because brother Brandon says is Paul gonna have to be judged with his people right he said yeah he'll be judged okay we're going to be judged well let me just ask you I just want to make this clear is Paul going to make it oh he'll make it he said good because I preached everything Paul preached [Music] there's where our comfort is at so you're hearing something in the message and it seems to hurt it seems to be too hard it seems to be too straight too narrow it is God's way you stay with it he said and then it seemed like Millions said we're resting on it I'm telling you I'm resting on it to be honest with you I'm Russian brother Bram said in the message persevering he said faith is not based upon a myth right and upon something that well let's just say go do this or do that on the words of some man but Faith takes its Eternal resting place upon the word of the Lord upon God's word which is the Bible that's where I'm going to stand I'm going to stand with the word I really don't care what man says about the word I'm going to stay with the word God is his own interpreter he interprets his word by bringing it to pass God's Prophet was not so wishy-washy preacher going back and forth he stayed with God's way like Moses brother Branham chose to suffer the Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season brother Branham labored and lived for his reward brother Branham was leaving that Realm coming back and you know the last words that he heard was keep pressing on keep pressing on stay on this straight and narrow path don't deviate the Holy Ghost didn't say you know you've been all mess messed up no keep pressing on brother Branham chose God's way for his life not just what religion he was going to have but what he was going to live by brother Brandon chose the harder way yes the straight narrow path now it was nine months later after this experience that God spoke to brother Branham in a prophecy and told him that a huge part a huge a huge portion of Heaven is awaiting him and that because of his choice that he made to live his life going God's way it was on February 11 1961 that God used a Baptist brother Danny Henry he happened to be the cousin of a famous actress Jane Russell but God used him nevertheless to carry out this important message of encouragement to brother Branham brother Brandon was sharing this he said now listen here you might think I'm hard but watch here because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou has walked of thine own choosing see that free more agency I just love that free more agency he says now I can understand that that Moses had a walk of his own choosing he made his decision brother Brandon was making his free Mole agency we need to consider our ways have we chosen the hard way have or have we chosen the easier path are we always making excuses not to do what we know is right brother Brown said that was my decision to stay with the word that was my decision regardless of what it does see now I don't know how many times I I used to get mocked at and persecuted for the for working for the Lord in so many different ways but you know it never bothered me because I was doing it of my own choosing it's my choice this is between me and God the prophecy went and say thou has did this by your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise decision and this is my way and because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee I wonder what that is I wonder what that huge portion of Heaven that was awaiting him the correct and precise decision we might say it's a good and acceptable and perfect will of God what a glorious decision that was made this in itself is that which will give and may come to pass that tremendous victory in love divine I'll tell you if we were so full of the love of God that nothing could bother us what more would you want let come what may take everything I have say what you want to say I am so free in God's love I am not bothered you talk about a tremendous victory Give Me Jesus take this whole world but give me Jesus we can't come into perfect love divine without choosing to lay down our life for God Amen to live for others you can't come into perfect love divine without choosing the harder path this in itself this choosing in itself is that which will give and make come to pass the tremendous victory in love divine so we must consider our ways we must consider I could be wrong are you choosing the harder way or have we stepped off in the easier path the easier way we got to choose God's heart we got to choose his desires we got to choose his will in his way for our life we got to be like David a man after God's Own Heart Oh Brother John you're David Fell he fell more than once he was still a man after God's Own Heart consider have you been putting the word of God first in your life have you been building the kingdom or of other things crept in consider your ways Colossians chapter 3 verse 1. we're we're just about time just so you know food is not going away I am allowing your stomach to make more room for good food Colossians chapter 3 verse one if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God set your affections on things above and not the things of the Earth for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God and when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory there are such nuggets in God's word you know many people think they have chosen the hard way because they accepted the message that is not hard what's hard is living the message amen that's the harder way to live what the message told us to live which was the same thing that the Bible said it just broken down so we can understand it come on the harder way is to live this message so we need to consider are we living it could we be wrong surely we're building our life we don't have to leave here and wonder about the things that we're going to do next week like nobody needs to come and tell me my wife does not need to come and tell me you need to work on your Greenhouse she don't have to do that it's already there I'm already planning it but have I considered God's house God's kingdom God's people have I considered a soul have I considered the missionaries have I considered helping some weak Christian because that's what God wants me to consider to seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness brother Brandon didn't choose the heart away at the end of his life he wasn't the example of the man that was on the cross that said Lord remember me when you get into your kingdom he made that decision early in life we need to make that decision early and and I'll say like this no matter where we're all at here and I praise God for where we're all at I stand with our sister Batman and brother Batman what a family we have here and I'm so grateful for the grace of God that's been in all of our Lives amen but I'm here to tell you that God wants us to consider giving him more of Our Lives part of our prayer I'm telling you you ought to have be putting everything you got into God us older people are we're winding up now I want to ask you this question what is that huge part of Heaven that was waiting for Brother Branham what was this this great crown that he was thinking about anybody know that's right think about that the huge part of Heaven that was awaiting him was all the people that was attached to him to this message that's the part that's awaiting you and I everything that you put into a soul is a part of your inheritance first Thessalonians 2 19 says for what is Our Hope or or joy or crown of rejoicing are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming remember he's coming with those for ye are our glory and our joy Paul is looking at the Thessalonian church as his glory and his Joy his crown of rejoicing his hope when at the presence of God's coming Philippians chapter 4 verse 1 therefore my beloved Brethren and long for my joy and my crown so Stand Fast in the Lord my dearly beloved Revelations 22 verse 11. we're winding down and beloved I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be well brother Branham has a huge part of Heaven awaiting him he's got a because his work has been great he gave up his life for the kingdom of God to build the kingdom of God he gave up his important time to the course of the day to win a soul and that soul will be eternally attached to him I don't want to be sitting in heaven brother Orlando with nobody around me because I didn't win them to the Lord well I'm looking at other people and seeing that they won others to the Lord amen they get to share eternity with that person always being attached to them and I don't got anybody attached to me I know it's a sobering thought but we're running out of time and look what is wrong with us getting serious with God you tell me what's wrong with that what's a bad thing about that to get to get serious about souls you'll never regret it they that win souls is wise choose the harder way I know you've got to give up your time to go win a soul I know we'd like it to be well if the Lord opens the door and you know we just happen to run into shoulders at the bank teller I know I understand that's that's that's nice but Jesus said go ye out amen there's something that we got to do have a heart to go out not a heart to fit it in Lord of you know fit it in for me while I'm doing my busy schedule so I want to ask you a question have you chosen the harder way have you given up your life how about your will how about your time can you say I have given up everything for Christ then this message is for you and all you got to say is Lord I'm I'm concerning my ways amen I'm I'm gonna I could be wrong in the way I've been kind of going forward waiting for the rapture and you've pricked my heart with my reward am I just going to be satisfied with being in heaven or do when you know if there's nobody in heaven because I won them there that means I've been pretty lazy on the earth and I really don't want everybody staring at me come on I want to work for the Lord and stand together don't be satisfied with just make it to heaven you want to have some Souls there that you could Rejoice with through eternity you light the fellowship you want a fellowship with them I just want read this last one in second Timothy chapter 4 verse 7. I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth laid there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not me only but unto all them also that love his appearing how many is looking forward to the Lord coming if he came today could you say I've done his bidding can you could you say that could you say I I have done as well I did as well yesterday I did as well last week I am in the perfect will of God I've been I've been giving my all he did say be ready be ready I come in an hour that you
