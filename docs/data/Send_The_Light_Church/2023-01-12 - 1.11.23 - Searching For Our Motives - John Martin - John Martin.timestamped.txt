[34:50] come to God's house to get strengthened
[34:54] to get fortified to help us with our our

[35:05] that's our goal

[35:42] proves that we're elected
[35:46] amen praise the Lord so good to see
[35:49] those of you in the house of the Lord

[36:06] and we just pray that God be with each
[36:09] family
[36:11] that's tuning in
[36:13] may the Lord just bless you with
[36:16] Revelation wherever you're at
[36:18] Brother Joseph Ben sends his greetings
[36:21] to all of you
[36:23] and he also requests our prayers he'll
[36:26] be traveling tomorrow to Lansing
[36:30] and he's going to be remaining there as
[36:32] he's going to school it's not as close
[36:34] as we wanted him to be but he's closer
[36:37] and he covets our prayers and he's
[36:42] looking forward to being with us just as
[36:44] often as he possibly can amen it sounds
[36:48] just a little bit a little bit loud can
[36:51] that sound like a little echo later what
[36:54] am I hearing
[36:55] hearing something
[36:59] fan that's it
[37:03] that is it who said fan
[37:06] another round all right praise the Lord
[37:09] before we begin reading in proverbs 4
[37:11] let's look to the to the author of this
[37:13] precious book Heavenly Father we want to

[37:18] you've called us out of the world and

[37:39] strong as you had the day that you
[37:41] called us Lord we thank you that our
[37:43] faults and our failures our mistakes
[37:45] haven't come between your love for us
[37:50] but Lord you just told us to repent
[37:55] and to to walk towards you and that Lord
[37:59] you would continue uh to keep us

[38:10] saints that are watching we just pray
[38:12] that the Holy Spirit would come and give
[38:15] us the very word that you intended for
[38:17] us to have to help us with our walk with
[38:20] you father we commit it all to you Nash
[38:22] your blessings now on the reading of the
[38:25] word may come forth to each heart
[38:28] personally with revelation we pray in
[38:31] Jesus precious name amen amen Proverbs
[38:35] chapter 4 starting with verse number 20.
[38:39] my son
[38:40] attend to my words
[38:43] incline thine ear unto my sayings
[38:48] let them not depart from thine eyes
[38:52] but keep them in the midst of thine
[38:54] heart
[38:55] for there are for they are the our life
[38:59] unto those that find them
[39:02] I love that and health to all their
[39:04] flesh
[39:06] keep thy heart with all diligence for
[39:10] out of it are the issues of life
[39:13] put away from thee a forward mouth
[39:17] and perverse lips put far from thee
[39:20] let thine eyes look right on and let
[39:24] thine eyelids look straight before thee
[39:27] Ponder the paths of thy feet
[39:30] and let all thy ways be established turn
[39:32] not to the right hand nor to the left
[39:34] remove thy foot from Evil amen God bless
[39:39] you may be seated
[39:44] well we want to continue on with motives
[39:48] and in part one we spoke on mixed Motors
[39:52] and we took the subject just trying to
[39:54] throw a seed into our hearts why do we
[39:56] do what we do
[39:58] she's trying to throw that out there
[40:00] because
[40:00] I think we
[40:03] feel that everything that we're doing is
[40:06] always for the right motives
[40:08] and
[40:10] um
[40:11] a lot of times it's not our Motors are
[40:14] selfish they they have to do with an
[40:17] agenda that we're trying to get to and
[40:19] we're not even being that considerate
[40:21] that it may not be the perfect will of
[40:24] God
[40:25] we also learned that we could be right
[40:28] in the uh the middle doing something
[40:31] that would be for God but we would have
[40:34] an ulterior motive for doing it and then
[40:38] that kind of cancels out that we're
[40:40] really doing the right thing
[40:42] okay
[40:43] right right didn't that he say did not
[40:46] Jesus said rather have your cold
[40:48] you know don't mix it don't mix the cold
[40:50] in the hot your will with God's will
[40:52] amen
[40:53] amen just do it because it's God's will
[40:57] and part two we want to title this
[41:00] message searching for our motives
[41:02] searching for our motives we want to dig
[41:04] a little deeper in discovering
[41:07] our motives instead of just assuming
[41:09] that they're all okay in order to
[41:13] as the Bible says here keep our hearts
[41:16] with all diligence in order to do that
[41:18] we must humble ourselves and just Ponder
[41:20] the path
[41:22] of our feet just
[41:24] I I know we're doing this we're supposed
[41:26] we're set out to do this and we're
[41:28] saying that this is the reason that
[41:30] we're doing it
[41:31] but take a minute and ponder it take
[41:34] some time and ponder it and a lot of
[41:36] times we we just want to take up like 30
[41:39] seconds or you know two minutes and and
[41:41] and check her motive but that is not it
[41:44] sometimes it takes a lot more than that
[41:46] right amen and we make
[41:49] many decisions dozens of decisions every
[41:52] day behind those decisions is a motive
[41:56] and that's what we want to learn to make
[41:59] sure that our motive is only for God
[42:01] Amen right that it's it's just 100
[42:06] percent God not well this is kind of
[42:09] what I have to do no if it's God's will
[42:12] you got to do it
[42:13] amen and if it's not God's will we want
[42:16] to step away amen foreign
[42:19] so searching are true intents it takes
[42:22] real courage
[42:24] it takes a courage it takes you got to
[42:26] be a strong Soldier because you're a lot
[42:29] of times when people really take time to
[42:31] look for their motives they're going to
[42:33] discover things that they didn't know
[42:34] were there right
[42:36] right because the devil is trying to
[42:38] hold hide back from us what's really
[42:40] going on
[42:41] right just like he's deceived the whole
[42:43] world
[42:45] and they're they're thinking that
[42:47] they're going to make it right
[42:49] they think they're going to make it in
[42:51] fact many will come to me on that day
[42:54] and say Lord Lord I should have made it
[42:56] because these credentials
[42:59] but their heart
[43:01] wasn't really all there for Christ
[43:06] so I just want to go through a couple
[43:08] bullets from last service
[43:10] the definition of a motive is simply the
[43:13] reason for doing something
[43:16] the reason for doing something
[43:19] especially one that is hidden or not
[43:22] obvious we've all experienced when we're
[43:25] talking to somebody we got a certain
[43:28] motive or certain objective
[43:31] that we're working with this one person
[43:33] to get what we want out of them without
[43:36] coming out and saying it now we're all
[43:38] guilty of that and some of us if I can
[43:41] say it like this we're professionals
[43:43] with it
[43:44] we're professionals we know how to talk
[43:47] about this but we're really going after
[43:50] this
[43:53] that's not going to help us and and
[43:55] really knowing our motives for other
[43:59] things
[44:01] because you develop habits right right
[44:04] and if you're developing a habit of
[44:06] hiding something over here you know
[44:08] that's just that's just a wrong spirit
[44:13] um now it's one thing and I just want to
[44:15] catch this
[44:16] because there's different it's this is a
[44:19] hard subject
[44:20] because there's not a lot of talk about
[44:22] it there's not a lot of information
[44:23] about it we do know that God hid Calvary
[44:27] from Lucifer
[44:29] the Bible tells us that if Lucifer would
[44:33] have known what what was going to come
[44:35] about he would have never done it
[44:38] and we do know that Jesus said that he
[44:41] hides the truth from the wise and the
[44:43] prudent
[44:45] but he also said that he will reveal it
[44:48] to obey someone who really wants to know
[44:51] so the the true nature of God is if
[44:53] someone is genuine and they really want
[44:56] to know God will show them
[45:00] but if no matter what they're going to
[45:02] do their own will no matter what they've
[45:03] got their own agenda well then you can't
[45:06] expect God to just lay it out for you
[45:09] and so this is hard subject of searching
[45:12] for our motives may be more difficult
[45:15] for some than others in harder at
[45:18] certain times for us than other times
[45:20] just depending on where our our heart is
[45:24] at
[45:25] amen the word objective means
[45:29] the thoughts and plans and efforts
[45:32] that we direct towards
[45:35] our end game towards our goal it's a
[45:39] strategic position to attain or purpose
[45:43] to achieve it might be something like
[45:45] this
[45:47] um brother Mark I want you to talk to
[45:49] brother Bob about uh his shoes being
[45:53] tied before he comes to church and uh
[45:57] really don't let him know I want you to
[46:00] talk to him
[46:03] yeah you're with me
[46:07] it's a strategic plan
[46:10] that Bob never knows what's behind what
[46:12] Mark's talking to him about
[46:15] and see this stuff happens all the time
[46:17] but we don't think about it we don't
[46:19] want to admit it we don't want to come
[46:21] to grips with it and before you know it
[46:23] it becomes our character the way that we
[46:26] are right and what we want to do is we
[46:29] want to break down those walls because
[46:32] these are the things that help initiate
[46:34] isms and schisms and favorites and and
[46:37] things like that when when you think
[46:40] when we get to heaven we're all going to
[46:42] be one
[46:44] all going to be one because that was the
[46:47] prayer that Jesus prayed with his
[46:49] disciples and and and for his disciples
[46:52] before he left and it is the goal that
[46:55] God has for us today and the way that
[46:57] we're going to get there is just just
[46:59] being more open and honest and not just
[47:01] hey if you if you think
[47:04] something is wrong with somebody that's
[47:08] okay you still gotta love them with the
[47:10] love of Christ they should you know the
[47:12] one thing they said about brother
[47:13] Brandon
[47:14] nobody could tell his enemies from his
[47:17] friends because he just loved everybody
[47:19] he just transparent with everybody
[47:23] I say if you if you have discovered
[47:25] something about somebody that's now your
[47:28] opportunity to help them
[47:32] shouldn't distract you from doing
[47:34] something or not doing something
[47:39] we said that any good that we could say
[47:41] or do would be in vain unless the motive
[47:45] of our heart was pure and right so here
[47:48] are these they were worshiping
[47:50] with their mouth
[47:52] they were praising us with their arm
[47:54] they were you know next to one another
[47:56] but their heart wasn't there
[47:59] and and so it was a vain situation this
[48:03] people draw nigh to me with their mouth
[48:04] and if they honor me at their lips but
[48:06] their heart isn't there
[48:08] so but in vain they do worship me so we
[48:13] could do a lot of things in vain if our
[48:15] mold of of what we're doing isn't pure
[48:18] and isn't right
[48:21] so God is looking for fruit
[48:24] from the things that we say
[48:25] the things that we're due looking for a
[48:27] fruit behind it
[48:29] our motives can easily be mixed with
[48:32] other motives for doing things and this
[48:34] is probably the most dangerous thing
[48:37] they can be mixed in other words
[48:41] we have a selfish desire about this
[48:43] situation but we're not going to talk
[48:46] about it
[48:47] we're not going to admit it
[48:50] what we're going to do is talk about
[48:52] this other
[48:54] reason
[48:56] because
[48:57] God's
[48:58] word says that we should do or the
[49:00] prophet said we should do it
[49:03] but yet
[49:04] we're going to get some sort of personal
[49:06] gain from the situation
[49:09] well automatically you're you've uh
[49:13] eliminated yourself
[49:16] from the blessing that you would be
[49:18] getting now that's what how the brother
[49:20] Branham taught it in the message so we
[49:23] have to make sure even though it is the
[49:26] will of God we got to make sure that our
[49:29] heart is I just want to do it to please
[49:31] the Lord I don't care about anything
[49:33] else
[49:34] and then you're uniting with God's Will
[49:37] and there's no chance for the flesh to
[49:39] get in amen
[49:45] amen what did Jesus say in the sermon to
[49:47] the churches
[49:49] at the end time I would that you were
[49:52] really either hot or cold
[49:56] I want you one way or the other way so
[49:59] and you how many times
[50:01] have have someone talked to you but you
[50:04] know
[50:05] that wasn't genuine what they were doing
[50:08] come on you know you know how that feels
[50:12] and you don't even feel comfortable
[50:14] around it right
[50:19] Jesus was saying if you don't put your
[50:21] heart into it I'd rather just have you
[50:22] go in the lust of your flesh in the
[50:24] world go do what you want to do
[50:26] because I only want a relationship
[50:29] that's genuine that's what really the
[50:31] Holy Ghost is saying to the to the
[50:33] church in this hour
[50:36] now the prophet taught us to check her
[50:38] motives to check our objectives amen and
[50:41] he gave us examples of pursuing good
[50:44] things but having a wrong reason for it
[50:47] or wanting to move mountains but Jesus
[50:49] for Jesus but but in ourselves we can't
[50:53] even move our flesh or our negative
[50:56] attitude out of the way
[50:58] right in a message brother Brandon
[51:02] spoke uh in in the message a paradox and
[51:07] I just want to read part of this quote
[51:09] he starts off by quoting Mark 11 22 he
[51:13] says if you say to this mountain be
[51:15] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[51:18] believe that what God Said will come to
[51:21] pass you can have what he said
[51:24] so I just as we're as we're reading this
[51:27] I I want us to
[51:29] to realize that
[51:31] the the the the very uh heart of of this
[51:35] message that we have today or the very
[51:37] subject is that God wants us to search
[51:40] our our motives and not assume that
[51:45] they're okay so in order to do that you
[51:48] have to keep asking yourself why why do
[51:51] you want to do why there's got to be a
[51:54] reason and not just well because of this
[51:56] because of the god no
[51:58] it takes much more
[52:01] so brother Brandon says but
[52:04] that takes motive and objective so he
[52:06] says you see this mountain be moved
[52:08] doubt not in your heart but whatever you
[52:10] say or come to pass he said but that
[52:14] takes motive and objective can you
[52:15] nobody's ever said that
[52:18] preachers will come up and say that they
[52:19] just say you gotta have faith to move
[52:21] that mountain
[52:23] but now he's bringing a a thought with
[52:26] this of course you've got to have a
[52:28] reason for it you can't have faith
[52:30] unless you got some reason
[52:33] as I tried to say last night some
[52:35] people's faith is in their textbook and
[52:37] some people's faith is in something else
[52:38] but it depends on where your faith is I
[52:41] want to believe God's word what he says
[52:43] is true then I've got to see whether
[52:45] it's his will or not see
[52:48] there's two different things you
[52:49] remember brother I'm talking about the
[52:51] three lights he's got a line it up
[52:53] so it's got to be his will and then I've
[52:55] got to see what my objective behind
[52:58] doing his will is
[53:00] really
[53:03] amen you know he has people some you
[53:05] know brother brother uh Ron was up here
[53:07] and he was talking about
[53:10] um asking if anybody wants to step in
[53:13] and help him uh clean uh while he's gone
[53:16] and when he comes back he'll resume the
[53:18] responsibility and you know how it is
[53:20] you ask somebody if they want to do
[53:21] something the first thing they want to
[53:23] say is well what is it it depends
[53:26] right and it's kind of like this with
[53:29] doing the will of God
[53:31] um uh it's the will of God but it
[53:34] depends whether I want to do it or not
[53:37] so he says I've got to see whether it's
[53:39] his will or not and then if it's his
[53:41] will I've got to check my objective to
[53:44] it
[53:45] and then my motive in doing it
[53:48] right and if I do it because I say well
[53:50] I'm going over the mountain here
[53:53] and there's a mountain before me and
[53:56] there's a million people on that side
[54:00] perishing
[54:02] and I got a hundred million here
[54:05] on this side I'm preaching to
[54:09] well if I can't get over and around or
[54:13] under the mountain or nothing
[54:16] and yet some things in my heart
[54:19] keep telling me go over the mountain go
[54:23] to them go to them and I can't get over
[54:25] now Jesus said they shall move this
[54:30] mountain
[54:30] yeah
[54:31] see
[54:33] now the thing of it is first
[54:36] what if I say go now first I never
[54:39] created that there so now he's getting
[54:42] he's searching where did that thought
[54:44] come from to go
[54:46] he's searching did
[54:48] I didn't think that that was coming from
[54:50] my desire
[54:52] so
[54:54] he's checking his flesh
[54:58] something created that it's for a good
[55:01] cause because why would I go to one
[55:05] million over there when a hundred
[55:09] million are here
[55:10] perishing on this side
[55:13] but it's something in my heart saying go
[55:17] over on that side
[55:19] tell the first thing I have to say well
[55:22] if I go over there this side can only
[55:25] pay me so much a month
[55:28] and over there see he said my motive is
[55:33] not right
[55:34] my objective is not right
[55:38] a lot of time when money has to do with
[55:40] something
[55:45] well
[55:49] the love of money is the root of so many
[55:52] things
[55:54] and who can who can know if they love
[55:56] money
[55:58] because we need money to pay bills
[56:01] we want money to pay bills so where is
[56:05] that fine line
[56:07] right it's very deceptive
[56:09] amen
[56:12] all right
[56:15] well
[56:16] what if I say no I don't care about the
[56:20] money but when I get over there someday
[56:22] the ages are calm they'll put up a great
[56:25] monument and say oh brother Branham was
[56:27] a great missionary
[56:28] he said then still my motive is not
[56:32] right
[56:33] because see here's another thing
[56:37] you know money can buy you a lot of
[56:40] stuff
[56:42] it's the one thing that can buy you a
[56:44] lot of stuff
[56:46] if you have enough money you can buy a
[56:48] lot you can buy popularity you can buy a
[56:51] lot of stuff with money
[56:54] without money
[56:57] um people still want popularity right
[56:59] they still want to be recognized for
[57:01] they still want other everybody wants to
[57:04] be loved I mean just naturally before we
[57:06] knew the Lord when you're growing up in
[57:09] our families we've felt we were being
[57:12] shortchanged
[57:13] right right and and we were being loved
[57:16] just a little bit less than our siblings
[57:19] or or those at school
[57:22] in the class or those on the team and
[57:25] we're just always looking for more I
[57:28] mean it's a natural thing
[57:30] so now this just opens the door
[57:34] for wanting
[57:36] something
[57:38] Beyond I just want to do as well I don't
[57:40] I don't want anything else
[57:42] see so brother Brian I'm saying here you
[57:45] the heart he said the heart the motive
[57:47] is is still not right
[57:49] but when I don't care
[57:51] if they ever know who went over there oh
[57:55] praise the Lord he's just in my heart
[57:59] then I'll speak to that mountain and
[58:01] it'll happen
[58:03] see if your motive is only I just want
[58:06] to please him I don't care how much it
[58:07] hurts I don't care what I get out of it
[58:09] I don't care how much I got to suffer
[58:10] then you know
[58:13] you're digging deep
[58:15] you're digging for the goat you're
[58:17] digging deep you're going to find out
[58:19] because God wants you to have confidence
[58:21] in what you're doing
[58:24] but see your motive in your objective
[58:26] depends on who you are and what business
[58:33] what that's where the church misses it
[58:36] so far
[58:38] they get worked up with an emotion and
[58:41] the first thing you know it's enthusiasm
[58:44] and you don't stop to check it before
[58:46] here again check there for sure then
[58:50] you'll know is thus saith the Lord see
[58:52] whether it's right now we find out again
[58:55] that Moses was in the line of duty and
[58:58] there he was at the Red Sea
[59:00] oh
[59:05] I love this word
[59:07] I just love this message it really
[59:11] teaches us what you can't find anywhere
[59:15] else
[59:19] turn with me if you would to the book of
[59:21] Acts chapter 19. I know you got you
[59:23] brought your Bibles with you
[59:24] praise the Lord for that
[59:27] Acts chapter 19 there was a situation in
[59:30] the book of Acts where some people
[59:31] wanted the benefits of Christ without
[59:34] having a close relationship with Christ
[59:37] and this is a typical Temptation that
[59:40] many many people have
[59:43] starting with verse 11 and God brought
[59:46] special Miracles by the hands of Paul so
[59:48] that from his body were brought onto the
[59:52] sick handkerchiefs or aprons
[59:55] uh
[59:56] and disease and the diseases departed
[59:59] from them and the evil spirits went out
[1:00:01] of them so this was a real
[1:00:03] uh real Miracles and and the Bible calls
[1:00:07] them special Miracles by the hands of
[1:00:11] Paul then certain of the vagabond
[1:00:13] a Jews now these are wandering strolling
[1:00:17] around just no place
[1:00:21] no
[1:00:23] um
[1:00:25] no accountability no headship no just
[1:00:30] wandering around
[1:00:32] and they were EX exorcists
[1:00:35] they took upon them notice took upon
[1:00:41] them to call over them which had evil
[1:00:43] spirits the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:46] saying we adjure You by Jesus who we
[1:00:51] don't know
[1:00:52] it's you know who we really don't know
[1:00:54] whom Paul preacheth
[1:00:57] and there were seven sons of either a
[1:00:59] Jew a chief chief of the priest which
[1:01:01] did so and the evil spirits answered and
[1:01:03] said Jesus I know and Paul I know but
[1:01:06] who are you
[1:01:08] and the man in whom the evil spirits was
[1:01:12] leaped on them and overcame them failed
[1:01:15] against them so that they fled out of
[1:01:17] the house naked and wounded and this was
[1:01:19] known to all the Jews and Greeks also
[1:01:21] drawn the Ephesus and fear fell on them
[1:01:24] all in the name of the Lord Jesus was
[1:01:26] magnified and many uh many that believe
[1:01:29] came confessed and showed their deeds
[1:01:36] now here these men were wanting to
[1:01:40] accomplish
[1:01:41] some good
[1:01:44] doing the right thing
[1:01:46] same as Paul was doing
[1:01:48] and and same as Jesus taught in my name
[1:01:51] they'll cast out devils
[1:01:53] but their motive was wrong
[1:01:57] it wasn't pure for Christ
[1:02:00] it was mixed
[1:02:02] something was in it for them
[1:02:08] and
[1:02:10] when we're searching for our motive
[1:02:13] we've got to confess Lord if I don't get
[1:02:17] anything out of this
[1:02:19] I want to do it
[1:02:21] and I'll tell you
[1:02:25] when you don't get things out of it
[1:02:30] and nobody knows about it
[1:02:33] you're most likely not to do it
[1:02:38] right I'm just talking Human Nature
[1:02:44] these men were not humble men
[1:02:48] they were not pondering the paths of
[1:02:50] their feet they were not keeping their
[1:02:53] heart with all diligence
[1:02:56] they didn't need Jesus they didn't need
[1:02:58] a relationship with Jesus but they just
[1:03:00] wanted
[1:03:01] to gain something
[1:03:03] from
[1:03:05] the name of Jesus
[1:03:07] wow
[1:03:10] wow
[1:03:12] maybe they began to say within
[1:03:13] themselves we have Abraham as our father
[1:03:16] they were they were they were Jews right
[1:03:19] right they were proud arrogant Wanderers
[1:03:23] and notices they took upon themselves to
[1:03:27] do this
[1:03:28] it wasn't God telling to do it
[1:03:31] they took upon themselves to do it
[1:03:35] and the the reason I'm sharing this
[1:03:39] these the scripture is I'm wanting us to
[1:03:44] be more careful about wanting to search
[1:03:46] our our motives
[1:03:49] a bit
[1:03:50] instead of just assuming all the time
[1:03:52] 100 they're right they're right they're
[1:03:56] right
[1:03:57] if they're right why aren't we serving
[1:03:59] one another more
[1:04:01] why aren't we laying down our life why
[1:04:03] don't we the prophet said that eternal
[1:04:05] life is living for others what does that
[1:04:06] mean
[1:04:08] and how and where do we see that
[1:04:11] where do we see that in our life
[1:04:18] how many times did the denominations
[1:04:20] want to host a meeting
[1:04:22] announcing brother Branham we want we're
[1:04:26] going to have brother Brandon he's going
[1:04:27] to be with us
[1:04:29] but they didn't want brother pranam
[1:04:32] to preach his Doctrine
[1:04:35] they didn't want him to
[1:04:38] talk about
[1:04:40] what the women had to do their ABCs
[1:04:45] they
[1:04:46] didn't want to get into certain aspects
[1:04:51] of the ministry of the word of God they
[1:04:54] only wanted brother Branham to pray for
[1:04:57] the sick
[1:05:00] because then it was something that they
[1:05:02] could rally behind
[1:05:03] this is no different than they did with
[1:05:05] Jesus they wanted Jesus to to feed them
[1:05:08] to heal them they were they would rally
[1:05:10] behind that but when he began to give
[1:05:13] them the word it began to separate the
[1:05:15] people from Jesus
[1:05:17] did it not amen it did and and here's
[1:05:20] the thing
[1:05:24] we've got to be all in for Christ it
[1:05:27] does not matter what he puts us through
[1:05:30] uh whatever he puts us through it's for
[1:05:33] our good amen amen and he's trying to do
[1:05:35] something in her life
[1:05:38] now let's just say my motive is wrong in
[1:05:41] a certain situation
[1:05:44] let's say I'm trying to take advantage
[1:05:47] of brother Mark
[1:05:50] and uh
[1:05:53] I uh
[1:05:56] I tell brother Mark I'm in a bad way
[1:05:59] brother Mark
[1:06:01] I I I just I need you to do all these
[1:06:04] things for me
[1:06:10] but my motive was just to try to get him
[1:06:13] to do what I want him to do
[1:06:17] now
[1:06:18] that
[1:06:20] cannot be pleasing to the Lord is that
[1:06:22] true
[1:06:23] okay now let's just take this a step
[1:06:26] further me as your pastor
[1:06:29] you probably wouldn't want me doing that
[1:06:31] would you not
[1:06:33] Okay so
[1:06:35] would you not want me to John would you
[1:06:39] please take a moment and check your
[1:06:41] motives make sure you're doing the right
[1:06:43] thing
[1:06:45] that's what we're trying to get more in
[1:06:48] our lives I want to ask this question I
[1:06:50] just want you to be honest with me how
[1:06:52] many has thought more about your motive
[1:06:54] since the last service
[1:06:56] okay okay now before that time
[1:07:00] and God bless you for doing that now
[1:07:02] before that time
[1:07:04] how much did you think about it
[1:07:10] and see see here with a wrong motive
[1:07:13] we're going to get in trouble
[1:07:15] I can tell you everything that was God's
[1:07:18] will for me to do and I did it for the
[1:07:20] right reason always worked out
[1:07:23] but everything that I did for me yeah
[1:07:27] I'm getting something out of it it did
[1:07:29] never it never worked it never prospered
[1:07:33] because God is not going to share his
[1:07:35] glory with my flesh thank you
[1:07:39] so this this idea of checking our
[1:07:42] motives may seem like something we were
[1:07:44] never taught by our mother and father
[1:07:45] but it is something that we need to do
[1:07:49] be because it was the counsel of the
[1:07:53] Prophet he's the one that told us to do
[1:07:56] it amen
[1:07:59] how many times did they tell brother
[1:08:00] Rand they loved him but they really
[1:08:02] didn't he knew that
[1:08:05] they didn't want to check their motives
[1:08:07] too often Believers think it's not
[1:08:09] relevant to check their motives not that
[1:08:12] important
[1:08:13] or they get spiritual lazy and they
[1:08:15] don't want to do it or they're just too
[1:08:17] proud to check their Motors there's
[1:08:18] always a reason that enemy will use to
[1:08:22] keep us from going down this path to
[1:08:25] really Ponder our motives
[1:08:27] but when we see someone do something
[1:08:30] that isn't just right
[1:08:32] something that we makes us question we
[1:08:34] don't have a problem of questioning
[1:08:37] their motive
[1:08:38] we'll question somebody else's motive
[1:08:41] much more than we'll question our own
[1:08:43] right
[1:08:45] now you tell me what that is
[1:08:49] when we're taught by the message to give
[1:08:51] the benefit of the doubt towards
[1:08:53] somebody
[1:08:54] and we're taught by the message to check
[1:08:55] our own motor but it said reverse
[1:08:58] it's because of the nature that we have
[1:09:01] and so the reason I'm bringing this out
[1:09:03] is
[1:09:06] it's understandable that we're not
[1:09:08] checking our motives a lot it's
[1:09:10] understandable but we've got to combat
[1:09:12] that force of nature that we're born
[1:09:14] with and even though we're we're born
[1:09:16] again it doesn't mean though that that
[1:09:17] nature can't uh
[1:09:20] try to take control over us
[1:09:24] the Bible says the fear of the Lord is
[1:09:26] the beginning of wisdom
[1:09:28] and then that that it's to me the the uh
[1:09:33] 2023 uh
[1:09:37] John Martin interpretation of that is I
[1:09:39] could be wrong
[1:09:41] I could be wrong let's check it out
[1:09:44] that's how we keep our hearts with
[1:09:46] diligence is to to make sure that this
[1:09:49] is I'm doing this for the right reason
[1:09:51] to check our Motors our objectives and
[1:09:54] everything that we do everything that we
[1:09:55] pursue it can't be just because
[1:09:59] amen it it has to be it's only because
[1:10:04] it's his will
[1:10:06] I don't care how much I can and I'll
[1:10:08] tell you when you're in the will of God
[1:10:09] it will never ever take you away from
[1:10:13] God
[1:10:14] will never
[1:10:16] show you his will
[1:10:19] and tell you to do as well and take you
[1:10:21] away from God
[1:10:23] never never no matter what happens it
[1:10:25] just it just it will not happen it's a
[1:10:28] real indication to know because in other
[1:10:30] words God will not put anything on you
[1:10:32] that you can't bear
[1:10:34] he's not going to put you in a position
[1:10:36] that you can't handle it
[1:10:39] he that's just not God
[1:10:43] yeah yeah that's right he'll take you
[1:10:45] right to that limit for sure
[1:10:48] but how many times people use excuses I
[1:10:51] can't do this I can't do this I I can't
[1:10:53] do this and it's all the will of God but
[1:10:55] they can't do it because of this
[1:10:58] that just
[1:11:00] we we've got to mature
[1:11:03] and we we the one way to help us mature
[1:11:07] is to be checking our motives
[1:11:10] searching our own motive
[1:11:13] is honestly the hardest thing to do is
[1:11:16] one of the hardest things to do if not
[1:11:18] the hardest
[1:11:19] and that's because there's a a prideful
[1:11:22] force in our in our human nature that
[1:11:26] depicts being challenged
[1:11:29] about anything that we're doing or that
[1:11:31] we're setting to do I mean even James
[1:11:34] said that that we should never say I'm
[1:11:36] going to go here and I'm going to do
[1:11:37] this I'm going to do that but it should
[1:11:39] always be if it be the will of the Lord
[1:11:42] that's right but man has this this
[1:11:45] nature about him that he's always right
[1:11:49] Proverbs 21 verse 2 tells us every way
[1:11:53] of a man is right in his own eyes
[1:11:57] so
[1:11:58] his motive is right in his own eyes
[1:12:01] but the Lord pondereth the hearts
[1:12:06] Proverbs 12 verse 15 says the way of a
[1:12:09] fool is even right in his own eyes
[1:12:12] but he that hearkeneth unto wise counsel
[1:12:16] unto counsel is wise and I believe
[1:12:18] brother Branham has given his counsel to
[1:12:20] check her motives and I think it's a
[1:12:22] wise thing to do
[1:12:24] no matter how much we think our motive
[1:12:27] is good check it
[1:12:29] no matter how much we think we're right
[1:12:32] check it no matter how much we see that
[1:12:34] it's the will of God doing the will of
[1:12:36] God check your motive always check your
[1:12:39] motive you can't not go wrong in fact we
[1:12:42] may think it's a waste of time but God
[1:12:43] is pleased with it
[1:12:45] God is pleased with that attitude he is
[1:12:49] never pleased with us assuming David
[1:12:52] said keep back thy servant from
[1:12:54] presumptuous sins thinking that what I'm
[1:12:57] doing is okay
[1:13:02] a man literally has to defy the prideful
[1:13:06] force of nature inside of himself to
[1:13:09] check his own nature
[1:13:11] that's how hard it is he has the humble
[1:13:14] himself under the mighty hand of God he
[1:13:17] has to consider that what he's doing he
[1:13:19] could be wrong
[1:13:22] right amen
[1:13:25] Pride wrote some things down here
[1:13:27] haughtiness arrogancy hatred lust
[1:13:29] bitterness grudges
[1:13:32] will absolutely blind a Believer and
[1:13:36] keep him from seeing his own true
[1:13:38] motives
[1:13:41] it doesn't matter if something happened
[1:13:43] yesterday to you or something that
[1:13:45] happened 10 years ago to you
[1:13:48] these things block us from seeing our
[1:13:50] motives
[1:13:54] we think about the
[1:13:56] uh the little bird that was always tied
[1:13:59] and he tried to fly away and every time
[1:14:02] he tried to fly away
[1:14:05] his he was tied to that stake and he
[1:14:08] could only go so far and he hit the
[1:14:10] ground he'd hit his face in the dirt and
[1:14:13] he said man this I'm never going to get
[1:14:16] anywhere
[1:14:17] and he finally just decided to quit
[1:14:19] trying
[1:14:21] and the man came by and he cut
[1:14:26] the very string that was holding him
[1:14:28] back
[1:14:30] but the bird was so uh psychologically
[1:14:35] uh
[1:14:38] in his mind thinking that he would never
[1:14:41] get away no matter what he didn't even
[1:14:42] try
[1:14:45] and I'll say it like this
[1:14:48] we can become psychologically tied to
[1:14:52] I'm always right
[1:14:55] I'm always right I'm always right you
[1:14:57] know we'll fight even when we're wrong
[1:14:59] even when we know we're wrong we'll
[1:15:01] sometimes we'll fight because we're
[1:15:04] unwilling to give in to our spouse or to
[1:15:07] somebody or our employer our employees
[1:15:11] come on
[1:15:14] Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 9. man's heart
[1:15:18] is very deceptive this is why we got to
[1:15:20] check our motives
[1:15:21] the heart is deceitful Above All Things
[1:15:29] and desperately wicked
[1:15:32] we might just say selfish
[1:15:36] and who can know it what a question who
[1:15:39] can know it who can stand and say I know
[1:15:41] my heart
[1:15:44] but yet we'll say yeah I'm right what
[1:15:46] I'm doing
[1:15:48] I the Lord search the heart
[1:15:52] I try the Reigns
[1:15:54] even to give every man according to his
[1:15:57] way and according to the fruits of his
[1:15:59] doing
[1:16:00] the Lord is the one that searches we're
[1:16:03] the ones
[1:16:04] I don't get this far I want to get to
[1:16:06] this and say it
[1:16:08] if you really really want to know your
[1:16:12] motive you got to ask God to help you
[1:16:15] see it
[1:16:16] sir amen because he's the only one that
[1:16:19] can show you what's in there
[1:16:23] think about all the times
[1:16:27] you thought you were right about
[1:16:28] something and then found out you were
[1:16:31] wrong
[1:16:34] yeah many times
[1:16:37] and and when we found out we were wrong
[1:16:40] what did we do at that moment
[1:16:46] what do we usually do
[1:16:51] we just we we go as if nothing happened
[1:16:56] that's what we usually do
[1:16:58] because it's no big thing
[1:17:02] it's only a big thing if the other
[1:17:04] person's wrong then it's a really big
[1:17:06] thing
[1:17:07] then we got a problem here we're gonna
[1:17:09] talk about it
[1:17:11] but when we're wrong
[1:17:14] hey sorry it's what
[1:17:18] you see what I'm saying
[1:17:22] so look there's many I I said that to
[1:17:25] say this
[1:17:26] there's times that we're we're wrong and
[1:17:28] we don't even know it
[1:17:32] and if we really want to know we've got
[1:17:34] to ask God to help us God I know I know
[1:17:37] I got a revelation my heart is so wicked
[1:17:41] [Laughter]
[1:17:42] I got a revelation of your word
[1:17:45] that my heart is deceitful Above All
[1:17:47] Things
[1:17:48] look at laodicea in need of nothing they
[1:17:51] were so much in need
[1:17:53] but they're so deceived
[1:17:57] we need to ask God God help me to see
[1:18:00] what my motive here help me if I I'm
[1:18:03] trying to get something out of this
[1:18:04] that's for me
[1:18:06] and I think that that humble
[1:18:09] contriteness is what opens the door for
[1:18:12] God
[1:18:13] to share with you what's really going on
[1:18:15] because as soon as you know
[1:18:18] that your motive isn't right you'll
[1:18:20] you'll repent if you if you've taken the
[1:18:23] time to ask God what your motive is when
[1:18:26] he shows you you will repent
[1:18:29] but you won't repent if you don't take
[1:18:32] time to ask him even if God preaches it
[1:18:35] to you
[1:18:37] that's right because the word of God is
[1:18:40] a discerner of the thoughts and Tents of
[1:18:42] the heart and when God does deliver it
[1:18:44] to you if you're still not asking you
[1:18:46] won't repent right because your your
[1:18:49] heart is not wanting it see
[1:18:52] it God only works through three more
[1:18:54] agency and you've got to want what he
[1:18:56] wants you've got to want what God's will
[1:18:58] is for your life
[1:19:01] I love this word
[1:19:07] a Believer who thinks it doesn't take
[1:19:10] much effort to know their own motives
[1:19:14] is too proud
[1:19:18] it takes a lot of effort
[1:19:20] I mean it if scripture is true that it's
[1:19:23] very deceptive very Wicked and all as
[1:19:26] you we think is that Lord remember to
[1:19:29] write and then
[1:19:32] then we're we're actually saying that
[1:19:34] that that that that Wicked heart can
[1:19:36] just you know turn on a dime
[1:19:40] and I know that we've been converted
[1:19:43] I understand that but since my
[1:19:45] conversion I've done a lot of evil
[1:19:47] things
[1:19:48] come on
[1:19:50] so that we can't hide behind while I'm
[1:19:52] born again I'm converted yeah I'm a
[1:19:54] born-again converted doing bad things
[1:19:56] that's another reason for me to check my
[1:19:58] motives
[1:20:01] so when we're searching
[1:20:03] out are our very true motive for doing
[1:20:07] what we're doing we need to cry out to
[1:20:10] God say God search me
[1:20:13] try me
[1:20:14] see if there be some Wicked way in me
[1:20:17] we sing about it let's put it into
[1:20:19] practice I mean when's the last time you
[1:20:22] said oh uh
[1:20:25] Wicked yeah Wretched Man that I am who
[1:20:28] who who can deliver me from this body of
[1:20:30] Flesh when's the last time that we've
[1:20:32] viewed ourselves as is is such a a low
[1:20:36] degree that it puts us on our knees
[1:20:39] um
[1:20:40] I'm not talking about
[1:20:43] feeling
[1:20:45] bad and and and somebody pouncing on you
[1:20:49] and making you feel not I'm not talking
[1:20:51] about that I'm just talking about self
[1:20:53] evaluation this flesh will never ever
[1:20:57] glory in his presence
[1:20:59] this flesh is not going to enter the
[1:21:01] Kingdom of Heaven There is a difference
[1:21:04] between the spiritual man and the old
[1:21:07] man
[1:21:07] amen
[1:21:10] now when a man thinks all he has to do
[1:21:12] is spend a few minutes thinking about
[1:21:14] what he's doing and call that I checked
[1:21:16] my motive
[1:21:18] he's missed it
[1:21:21] a man is deceived and thinking his
[1:21:23] carnal nature isn't that very deceptive
[1:21:28] you can't figure it out whether your
[1:21:30] motor's right
[1:21:32] God God
[1:21:34] if you don't bring God in on the scene
[1:21:36] you can't imagine what he
[1:21:38] what he thinks about that right when his
[1:21:41] word says you do need me
[1:21:43] when I try the heart
[1:21:46] I'm not saying that you don't know your
[1:21:49] heart because maybe God showed you
[1:21:51] about something I'm not saying that but
[1:21:54] I'm talking about the many things
[1:21:57] that isn't the devil has opportunity to
[1:22:00] to get in there and and twist things up
[1:22:03] he has the ability
[1:22:06] to twist things in her mind and make us
[1:22:08] look at certain things and not other
[1:22:10] things he has the ability to point out
[1:22:12] that there are certain aspects and and
[1:22:15] camouflage our own selfishness in this
[1:22:17] situation our own hidden agenda true
[1:22:20] amen and then we don't want to talk
[1:22:22] about it
[1:22:23] well God wants us to talk about to him
[1:22:26] that's what he wants
[1:22:28] to check what our true motive is it
[1:22:31] requires God he's the only one that
[1:22:34] knows our heart
[1:22:35] right how many times we heard we don't
[1:22:37] judge any because we don't know their
[1:22:38] heart only God knows their heart right
[1:22:41] well
[1:22:42] we don't know our heart either only God
[1:22:44] knows this amen I quoted it but let's go
[1:22:47] there Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12.
[1:22:51] for the word of God is quick and
[1:22:53] powerful and sharper than any two-edges
[1:22:55] sword piercing even to the dividing
[1:22:57] asunder of the soul and the spirit and
[1:23:00] the joints in the mirror and is a
[1:23:02] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:23:06] intents of the heart
[1:23:09] I have to say I can't do that
[1:23:12] I can't do that
[1:23:15] I have questioned
[1:23:18] myself
[1:23:21] and I'm okay with it because I got
[1:23:23] I got scripture
[1:23:25] and I got a message
[1:23:28] and I'm not going to act
[1:23:30] like I don't need to do it
[1:23:34] but God is faithful I believe that he
[1:23:37] comes
[1:23:38] hear and he discerns what's going on
[1:23:44] now
[1:23:45] when we look at the scripture and we
[1:23:48] think about coming to church and we want
[1:23:50] God to speak to us something that only
[1:23:54] we and him know
[1:23:57] just kind of confirm
[1:23:59] this is this is on my heart God knows I
[1:24:02] didn't talk to anybody and the word
[1:24:04] comes and he speaks and then we say yes
[1:24:08] God was there and God was there and he
[1:24:12] discerned the heart and he spoke
[1:24:15] but what about when God comes here and
[1:24:20] he unveils some things that are in our
[1:24:23] heart that should be there
[1:24:28] we don't have the same attitude
[1:24:31] we don't have that same yes Lord I want
[1:24:34] you to discern it
[1:24:36] so you see it requires humility God I've
[1:24:40] got to hear from you I've got to hear
[1:24:42] I've got to see that what I'm doing is
[1:24:46] exactly what you want me to do
[1:24:49] if that's not there when the word comes
[1:24:52] and it speaks to us it'll go right over
[1:24:55] our head
[1:24:56] it'll be like water off a duck's back
[1:24:59] and will never think that God was there
[1:25:06] I'll tell you that what I love about the
[1:25:08] scripture here
[1:25:09] is God is not going to leave us in
[1:25:11] church without speaking to us
[1:25:15] I don't care what our background is I
[1:25:17] don't care what we're going through
[1:25:19] God is there to speak to us
[1:25:22] the Bible says in verse 13 neither is
[1:25:24] there any creature that is not manifest
[1:25:27] in his sight but all things are naked
[1:25:29] and open unto him of Unto unto the eyes
[1:25:33] of him of whom we have to do in our
[1:25:37] whole lives are in his hands amen
[1:25:41] now motives
[1:25:44] uh can be easier to detect for the most
[1:25:48] part than what meets the eye
[1:25:51] I'm not trying to be contrary to what
[1:25:54] I've been saying but I want to try to
[1:25:55] give you some pointers
[1:25:59] moldas are usually either selfish
[1:26:02] or they're for others right
[1:26:07] that's it
[1:26:08] and any motive that's for yourself you
[1:26:11] need to be real careful right
[1:26:13] but when your motive is for others
[1:26:17] which brother Branham taught us that
[1:26:19] eternal life is living for others and I
[1:26:21] say that's why brother Brian could say
[1:26:24] Mission workers always in the will of
[1:26:25] God when your motive is for to do God's
[1:26:29] will
[1:26:29] we can always say that right we can
[1:26:33] always say well I'm doing this because
[1:26:34] God wants me to this is God's will
[1:26:37] but if you're in it if you're getting
[1:26:40] anything out of it you need to be sure
[1:26:44] but if it's for somebody else and you're
[1:26:47] not getting anything out of it
[1:26:51] you see there's no selfishness there
[1:26:54] none
[1:26:57] your motive is pure your motive is right
[1:27:00] in this age when then people are falling
[1:27:04] away
[1:27:05] the love of many is waxing cold
[1:27:09] people don't don't have time enough
[1:27:13] to help others because they're so busy
[1:27:16] swallowing up with their own life
[1:27:19] and if they're not swallowed up with
[1:27:21] their own problems they're trying to
[1:27:25] get ahead of the Joneses
[1:27:28] are you with me and there's no end to
[1:27:31] that there's no end to that so somewhere
[1:27:34] down the line I believe the elect
[1:27:37] got a balance
[1:27:39] they got a balance
[1:27:41] and we need to be spending our time
[1:27:44] getting Soul saved are you with me all
[1:27:48] right all right first John we're going
[1:27:49] to have to hurry because time
[1:27:52] is is is getting away from us
[1:27:56] first John chapter 3 verse one checking
[1:27:58] our motives
[1:28:00] ought to be on a consistent basis not
[1:28:02] just once in a while so let's say I
[1:28:04] checked my motive
[1:28:06] about
[1:28:08] Lord should I be preaching
[1:28:12] are you sure are you sure Lord you want
[1:28:15] me to preach
[1:28:17] I think that motive needs to be checked
[1:28:19] often
[1:28:20] come on
[1:28:24] look I am never going to give a reason
[1:28:26] not to check your motive it just ain't
[1:28:28] gonna come from me it ain't gonna come
[1:28:29] from from behind this Pulpit when I'm
[1:28:32] here
[1:28:35] I think the righteous or as bold as a
[1:28:37] lion but I don't think they're arrogant
[1:28:40] there's there's a difference
[1:28:43] I feel that we constantly need to be
[1:28:45] checking our most kid at any time the
[1:28:47] devil can get in there
[1:28:48] right it's the truth amen
[1:28:50] it's not so much is it the will of God
[1:28:52] for me to be preaching but is my heart
[1:28:55] where it needs to be right now when I'm
[1:28:58] preaching amen you understand the
[1:29:00] difference yes
[1:29:01] it's not like the Revelation comes and
[1:29:03] goes
[1:29:04] but the enemy can get in there all right
[1:29:07] first John chapter 3 verse 1 beloved
[1:29:10] what manner of love the father bestowed
[1:29:11] upon us that we should be called the
[1:29:13] sons of God therefore the world knoweth
[1:29:15] us not because it knew him not
[1:29:18] beloved now are we the sons of God
[1:29:23] even though it does not appear
[1:29:26] what we shall be
[1:29:28] but we know that when he shall appear
[1:29:31] we're going to be like him
[1:29:34] and we're going to see him as he is
[1:29:38] now what does this do for us verse 3
[1:29:40] unveils this every man that have this
[1:29:43] hope in him
[1:29:45] purifieth himself
[1:29:48] even as he is pure
[1:29:50] and
[1:29:51] you're checking your motive
[1:29:55] you're getting it when you when you find
[1:29:57] a wrong motive you are a praise God
[1:30:01] because you're doing something that you
[1:30:03] normally don't do right when you find
[1:30:05] out you got a wrong motive you get
[1:30:07] caught with something something was
[1:30:09] wrong
[1:30:10] you just want to kind of just not talk
[1:30:12] about it let's just get over let's just
[1:30:13] go into something else let's change the
[1:30:15] subject
[1:30:17] but you're not learning
[1:30:20] you may think you're learning but you're
[1:30:21] not learning
[1:30:22] right this this process of purifying
[1:30:26] yourself it's a real process
[1:30:30] and when you when you're checking your
[1:30:32] motives nobody knows about it
[1:30:34] right this is between you and God this
[1:30:37] is how you purify yourself you don't
[1:30:40] need
[1:30:41] somebody else to tell you you're doing
[1:30:43] wrong all the time
[1:30:46] that's what the Holy Ghost is for
[1:30:48] you have no need that any man teach you
[1:30:50] but the holy ghost that dwelleth in you
[1:30:52] he teaches you all things
[1:30:54] now he's saying check your motives work
[1:30:57] with me
[1:30:58] work with me
[1:31:01] praise the Lord all right first John
[1:31:04] chapter 4 verse one beloved believe not
[1:31:06] every Spirit
[1:31:08] but try the spirits
[1:31:11] whether they are of God
[1:31:14] because many false prophets are going
[1:31:16] out into the world I remember many years
[1:31:18] ago it's just I'm talking many years ago
[1:31:22] I was just a young believer and I heard
[1:31:24] brother Hankins speak on this
[1:31:27] and it just about blew my top when I
[1:31:30] heard it
[1:31:31] he said
[1:31:33] you even it doesn't matter if it's God
[1:31:36] or a demon you try the spirit I thought
[1:31:39] who am I to try God
[1:31:42] but you don't know who it is that's why
[1:31:44] you're trying it
[1:31:45] and after you learn that it's God then
[1:31:48] you
[1:31:49] reference it you reverence God but
[1:31:52] here's the thing how many times do we
[1:31:54] take time to try the spirits that come
[1:31:56] and speak to us
[1:31:58] that entices to do this that lead us to
[1:32:01] do that it isn't just God trying to lead
[1:32:03] us
[1:32:05] you got a demon that's trying to lead
[1:32:07] you off track all the time and if it's
[1:32:08] not one it's another and if it's not
[1:32:10] another it's another if it ain't through
[1:32:12] this person it's through that person
[1:32:13] look what happened to job's wife
[1:32:17] leading them off the path
[1:32:19] I mean the devil is real
[1:32:21] he'll use whatever weak vessel he can to
[1:32:25] speak to you
[1:32:27] but just think about your own thoughts
[1:32:31] the Devil Wants
[1:32:36] wants us to be in the flesh
[1:32:39] wants us to walk in the carnality of our
[1:32:42] ourself
[1:32:44] he wants to distract Us by everything
[1:32:46] that can distract Us in this world
[1:32:50] and there's a lot of problems in this
[1:32:51] world
[1:32:52] there's the good there's the bad
[1:32:56] and there's ugly
[1:32:58] you got them all you got stuff that
[1:33:00] appeals to you
[1:33:01] you got stuff that's bad and then you
[1:33:04] got some pretty ugly stuff but the devil
[1:33:06] wants to distract you with it there's a
[1:33:09] spirit of air that will cause us to air
[1:33:12] from our walk with Christ
[1:33:14] and where we were walking real close
[1:33:17] with him we had intentions we had
[1:33:19] desires we're we're strong and then all
[1:33:21] sudden we're allowing this
[1:33:25] are you with me
[1:33:27] all right then there's a spirit of truth
[1:33:29] and the Bible says when he comes he will
[1:33:32] lead and guide you
[1:33:34] into all truth
[1:33:36] now friends we're not there yet I say to
[1:33:39] the send the light church we are not
[1:33:41] there yet
[1:33:44] we can say the light has come the
[1:33:46] message has come
[1:33:50] but we don't have it all yet I'm not
[1:33:52] manifesting all of Christ yet
[1:33:55] I'm not living for all of of others yet
[1:34:00] are you with me
[1:34:01] so that word try
[1:34:04] believe not every Spirit but try the
[1:34:06] spirits that word try means to test
[1:34:09] to prove out
[1:34:11] to discern
[1:34:13] or to examine so I want to ask you
[1:34:15] when's the last time that you tried a
[1:34:17] spirit that came to you
[1:34:21] now if I was to ask you when's the last
[1:34:23] time you tried somebody else's spirit
[1:34:30] just wonder how often we do this how
[1:34:32] often we think we already know
[1:34:36] that there's no need to discern
[1:34:39] discern because I'm already
[1:34:42] know that I'm right
[1:34:49] how many feel like you just you're
[1:34:51] you're willing
[1:34:54] to dig a Little Deeper amen this this
[1:34:56] this message is is not to hurt us Hammer
[1:35:01] us
[1:35:01] it's to get us to mature
[1:35:04] you know I see people that are so old
[1:35:08] in this message
[1:35:11] that would are 10 feet
[1:35:14] they they One Touch check in their own
[1:35:18] attitude their own spirit with a ten
[1:35:19] foot pole
[1:35:22] because they're scared about what
[1:35:24] they're going to find
[1:35:25] but you know if you're right you you
[1:35:27] could spend three hours talking about it
[1:35:30] you could literally spend three hours
[1:35:31] talking about it to somebody if you know
[1:35:34] that your motive is right
[1:35:37] because I don't
[1:35:39] I've honestly I don't care how much I
[1:35:42] fail
[1:35:43] I don't care how many mistakes I make
[1:35:45] here I don't care if I say the wrong
[1:35:47] words
[1:35:50] I don't misunderstand me I don't want to
[1:35:52] do that
[1:35:53] but
[1:35:55] if I said everything perfect but my
[1:35:57] motives were wrong
[1:36:02] if God used a seventh grade education to
[1:36:06] bring the message of this hour I don't
[1:36:08] think he's too much wanting to display
[1:36:10] dignity to the bride
[1:36:13] I think he's more interested in the real
[1:36:17] being real
[1:36:18] amen
[1:36:20] all right just another quote I know it's
[1:36:22] it's time very close to being time
[1:36:26] this is in the message the spoken word
[1:36:28] is the original sin I just want to I you
[1:36:32] take time when you get home to read the
[1:36:34] next six verses there in John which we
[1:36:37] did not read Saint John chapter 1 uh
[1:36:41] Chapter 4 verses 1 through 6 or 7 and
[1:36:45] you'll see there's a a learning there of
[1:36:49] how to check your motives
[1:36:52] how to know your motor so in searching
[1:36:55] for a mold is be sure that it's God's
[1:36:57] will first
[1:36:58] and then
[1:37:00] check
[1:37:01] what your motive is behind doing it in
[1:37:06] other words don't just say well I'm
[1:37:08] doing it because it's God's will because
[1:37:09] I can do God's will and do it for me
[1:37:13] I've got to just do it
[1:37:17] only because it's God's will
[1:37:19] amen all right spoken word is Original
[1:37:21] Seed now it's a it's rough friend it's
[1:37:24] very rough I don't mean to be that
[1:37:27] myself yeah I I hope you understand that
[1:37:30] but today I'm given the expression of
[1:37:33] why I have did the things that I've done
[1:37:35] and now for just a little
[1:37:38] analysis before we dismiss for lunch
[1:37:41] that is I want you to know that this has
[1:37:45] been my motive and my objective
[1:37:49] is God's word
[1:37:51] my motive is to please him
[1:37:55] and I can't listen to everything
[1:38:00] and believe God's word now I want to
[1:38:02] read that again I can't listen to
[1:38:03] everything and believe God's word
[1:38:06] neither can I listen to everything and
[1:38:08] please God my motive is to know his word
[1:38:11] and to please God by serving him by his
[1:38:15] word
[1:38:17] now every person here that's been born
[1:38:19] of the spirit of God that's in the elect
[1:38:21] group was perhaps once a Methodist
[1:38:24] Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal or
[1:38:26] something another somewhere
[1:38:29] now you know that you know that so then
[1:38:31] you see when you say go out to them
[1:38:36] that's what you have to do
[1:38:37] there's somebody in there if you'll sow
[1:38:40] the seed there'll be a harvest someday
[1:38:44] some of it will go by and say oh there's
[1:38:48] nothing but he's a Deceiver
[1:38:50] didn't they say the same thing about our
[1:38:52] Lord
[1:38:53] there's nothing to that and then why
[1:38:56] don't you check it with me
[1:38:58] nothing but a Deceiver
[1:39:01] then check it with the word if it isn't
[1:39:04] the word then it's deceiving now if your
[1:39:06] theology is different from the word then
[1:39:09] it's then it isn't right
[1:39:12] now others will go by and say well you
[1:39:15] know what I believe I'll try it a while
[1:39:17] he said you'll choke
[1:39:20] you can't try it for a while
[1:39:22] you have to be sold out
[1:39:25] but when you're really empty out and say
[1:39:27] Lord Jesus no more of me but you
[1:39:31] from this on
[1:39:33] see then it's going to bring forth a
[1:39:37] hundred fold you believe that
[1:39:38] congregation says amen
[1:39:40] I believe it too with liberty and
[1:39:43] justice for all that's right yes sir I
[1:39:45] pledge my allegiance to my Lord see to
[1:39:48] the to preach his word and to stand on
[1:39:50] his truth if it'll cost me my life I'll
[1:39:53] still go on just the same
[1:39:56] it would be a great thing for me not
[1:39:59] wanting to do it but if I had to
[1:40:03] if I had to do it
[1:40:05] I would mingle my blood in this earth
[1:40:08] like those who mingled their blood for
[1:40:10] the same thing
[1:40:12] like those who died in the pits of the
[1:40:15] lions like those who died on crosses
[1:40:18] those who were sawed asunder
[1:40:21] that were kicked out of their
[1:40:22] organizations and wondered about in
[1:40:24] sheepsins goats skins and destitute
[1:40:27] it would be a great privilege for me as
[1:40:30] the disciple of Christ
[1:40:32] returned back and had counted all joy
[1:40:36] because they were able to stand the
[1:40:40] reproach that brought on his name
[1:40:45] they could suffer that for him there's
[1:40:48] there are little suffering I don't want
[1:40:50] to suffer nobody wants to suffer
[1:40:52] but I would like to join my hands with
[1:40:55] all the denominations and say brother
[1:40:57] let's go I'd like to do that I would I'd
[1:41:00] like to take my hand
[1:41:02] I'm sorry if I do
[1:41:06] so he's trying to say he can't go with
[1:41:08] the denominations
[1:41:10] I would like to join my hands with the
[1:41:12] denomination and say brother let's go
[1:41:13] but if I do that I'd like to do that but
[1:41:16] if I do that I take my hands out of his
[1:41:19] far be it from ever doing that I stand
[1:41:21] alone I stand with him his word
[1:41:25] for as Eddie parat said on Christ the
[1:41:29] solar Rock I stand all their ground is
[1:41:30] sinking sand and Christ is the word
[1:41:33] amen so
[1:41:37] we're going to have to stand alone
[1:41:41] if we're a person that is going to be
[1:41:44] uh
[1:41:48] easily motivated by others it's going to
[1:41:52] be hard to walk with the Lord
[1:41:54] and it's going to be hard to know your
[1:41:56] true motives
[1:41:58] so
[1:42:00] take what our the prophet said and let
[1:42:04] your motive be only God's word if you if
[1:42:08] there's an instant of getting something
[1:42:10] out of it just a teeny little bit if
[1:42:12] there's anything to get out of it get
[1:42:14] away from it
[1:42:15] I say get away from it
[1:42:18] pursue something where you get nothing
[1:42:20] out of it
[1:42:21] and you'll find the Lord there I believe
[1:42:23] that so I just got a few bullets here
[1:42:26] and and and and Cheryl you can come if
[1:42:29] you'd like I just want to say in search
[1:42:31] for our true Motors you first must
[1:42:33] desire to know it above all costs
[1:42:38] if you if that desire to really know
[1:42:40] what isn't there you might as well
[1:42:41] forget this whole message
[1:42:44] you've got to want to know it because
[1:42:45] it's going to cost you to spend more
[1:42:48] time with God In Prayer
[1:42:51] it's going to take more than just a a
[1:42:53] quick check or three minutes here or
[1:42:55] this it's going to take some soul
[1:42:57] searching
[1:42:58] amen confess openly let it be real to
[1:43:01] you I could be wrong about this
[1:43:05] if that's not there in anything I think
[1:43:07] you got to check your spirit
[1:43:11] then begin to try the spirits ask the
[1:43:13] questions the hard questions why am I
[1:43:15] really choosing to do this is this for
[1:43:18] his kingdom for his people for his
[1:43:20] church for Souls did he really tell me
[1:43:22] to do this or is this something I'm
[1:43:24] wanting to do
[1:43:26] and these questions will open the door
[1:43:28] for a communication between you and God
[1:43:31] so he can show you really what the
[1:43:33] motive is
[1:43:35] and that's what it's all about keeping
[1:43:38] your motor pure is going to keep us out
[1:43:40] of trouble down the road amen let's
[1:43:42] Stand Together
[1:43:56] I think always think of of Balaam who
[1:43:59] so bad wanted to do his will
[1:44:02] and trying to make it God's will
[1:44:06] kept pursuant until it happened
[1:44:08] but it wasn't
[1:44:10] and
[1:44:12] he he just should have fell in love with
[1:44:14] God's Will and not been tempted to get
[1:44:16] anything out of it
[1:44:18] and we must learn
[1:44:21] to
[1:44:23] just pursue this I say Saints with all
[1:44:25] your heart I know that we may not be
[1:44:27] used to doing this it it it we may have
[1:44:31] spent a little time with it but let's
[1:44:35] in our personal walk with the Lord our
[1:44:37] personal time with the Lord our personal
[1:44:39] prayers just ask God to unveil to you
[1:44:43] the true motives behind everything that
[1:44:46] you're asking for everything that you're
[1:44:48] wanting to do everything that you're
[1:44:49] unwilling to do
[1:44:52] you know why aren't you why aren't you
[1:44:54] willing to help brother Ron out why what
[1:44:58] is that motive
[1:44:59] or if somebody asks you to do so what is
[1:45:02] that motive
[1:45:03] so
[1:45:06] I think this will help our growth don't
[1:45:08] you amen let's just bow in a word of our
[1:45:11] heavenly father Lord I Thank you for
[1:45:14] your people
