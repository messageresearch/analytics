[0:13] and our vessel so he feels welcomed amen
[0:16] man praise the Lord good to be in church

[0:22] seeing the importance of us being
[0:25] together we've got so many things that
[0:31] are attacking us left and right and we
[0:35] just need to be together more and more
[0:37] amen under the umbrella of the word of
[0:40] course amen turn with me if you would to
[0:42] the book of 2nd Kings chapter 5 second
[0:47] Kings chapter 5 I don't know if a
[0:51] request they got in probably did but
[0:53] sister Cheryl had taken sick certainly
[0:57] wasn't expecting that when we had seen
[0:59] her but she just she wasn't feel more it
[1:02] just all sudden start feeling sick and
[1:05] her Stumpy's appreciate your prayers for
[1:06] her amen
[1:10] well tonight we want to for a title talk
[1:17] about influence influence I believe we
[1:24] are all subject to being influenced by
[1:29] spirits and we also possess a power to
[1:34] influence and so we don't take that for
[1:37] subject the power to influence before we
[1:39] begin reading here in 2nd Corinthians
[1:42] chapter 5 let's look to the Lord and
[1:45] prayer together Heavenly Father we come
[1:47] to you as humbly as we know how at this
[1:51] moment we are sinners saved by grace we
[1:56] have fallen we have come short of your
[2:00] glory and we ask that the blood of Jesus
[2:03] Christ would cover us all at this time
[2:06] Laura that we would be in that nothing
[2:13] could hinder this service
[2:14] nothing could hinder you from revealing
[2:17] yourself and showing us how we can be
[2:20] more like you more equipped to stand
[2:22] against the enemy to be able to use the
[2:25] influence that you give us to help
[2:27] others Lord we need you tonight and we
[2:31] pray that you'd move in our midst in
[2:33] their hearts and bless us with the
[2:36] revelation of your precious words we
[2:38] commit the service in our lives into
[2:40] your hands now for your honor and and
[2:42] your glory we pray these things in Jesus
[2:45] Christ's name Amen
[2:47] well in Chapter five here this is the
[2:51] story of of naman and we've all have
[2:55] heard this story a number of times and
[2:58] naming the Bible says was a I captain of
[3:01] the host of the king of Syria he was
[3:03] very very close to the king he was uh he
[3:07] was a good man and was through him that
[3:09] they were able to have victory in the
[3:12] war the Bible says that he was a mighty
[3:15] man of value but he also had leprosy and
[3:21] he in and through the time of the war
[3:30] they were able to seize a handmaid that
[3:36] could be used for the name ins wife and
[3:41] and she got to be close to him but she
[3:46] wasn't in influence to name ins wife and
[3:52] she had wished that name in her her
[3:56] husband could get alone with the Prophet
[4:01] that was in the Land of Israel and naman
[4:05] would be healed and that was her desire
[4:07] and even though they weren't maybe of
[4:10] the same she had a spirit to want to try
[4:12] to help and and and and so that
[4:18] the word got out and then the word got
[4:22] out to the king and the king of Syria
[4:27] sent a message to the king of Israel
[4:30] that I'm sendin naman here to get healed
[4:33] by your prophets and this really
[4:35] disturbed the king of Israel and he
[4:37] thought they were starting to have some
[4:39] sort of quarrel and start a fight
[4:40] because who could a king how could he
[4:43] heal a man of leprosy so what not really
[4:47] being well in tune with perhaps the the
[4:54] Prophet because the Prophet was supposed
[4:56] to do it right not the king and so we
[4:58] want to pick this up in verse number
[5:01] eight and it was so when Elisha the man
[5:05] of God had heard that the king of Israel
[5:09] had rent his clothes that he sent to the
[5:12] king saying
[5:14] wherefore has now rent they clothes let
[5:17] him cover
[5:18] let him come now to me and he shall know
[5:21] that there is a prophet in Israel notice
[5:25] the exclamation was to know that there's
[5:29] a prophet because if you believe in the
[5:34] prophets you're gonna prosper amen amen
[5:39] so naman came with his horses and with
[5:43] his chariots and stood at the door of
[5:45] the house of Elijah and Elisha sent a
[5:48] messenger unto him saying go and wash in
[5:52] Jordan seven times and I flesh shall
[5:54] come again to thee and thou shalt be
[5:56] clean and name and was raw and went away
[5:58] and said behold I thought he will surely
[6:03] come out to me and stand and call on the
[6:05] name of the of the Lord his God and
[6:07] strike his hand over the place and
[6:10] recover the leper are not AB a banner
[6:14] even ax and farm paw rivers of Damascus
[6:19] better than all the waters of Israel may
[6:21] I not wash in them and be clean and so
[6:24] he turned and went away in a rage and
[6:25] his servants came here spake unto
[6:31] and said my father if the Prophet had
[6:34] bid me to do some great thing
[6:36] what does now not have done it how much
[6:40] rather then when he say it to the wash
[6:43] and be clean then went he down and
[6:47] dipped himself seven times into Jordan
[6:50] according to the saint of the man of God
[6:52] and his flesh came again like unto the
[6:56] flesh of a little child and he was clean
[6:59] amen amen
[7:01] god bless you you may be seated we're
[7:03] just going to stop right there
[7:05] what a wonderful influence that the
[7:10] servants of naman were on naming just
[7:15] pointed him to the word of the Lord it
[7:19] was quite simple but yet a lot of times
[7:24] we ourselves don't know how to use the
[7:27] powerful tool of influence influences a
[7:30] very powerful to it is the power to be a
[7:35] compelling force to produce effects on
[7:39] actions opinions or behaviors and you
[7:42] see this if you look it up in the Bible
[7:44] or look it up in the dictionary it can
[7:47] help accomplish and achieve things it is
[7:50] used to affect or sway someone or
[7:53] something to a particular outcome this
[7:57] is the brother John definition influence
[8:00] is the power to create an atmosphere
[8:02] that brings about your will or your
[8:05] desire influence can be used for good or
[8:11] for bad and it simply depends on the
[8:16] motive and I would just want that to
[8:19] soak in why did the Prophet tell us to
[8:23] check our motives
[8:24] there's something about a motive that
[8:27] teaches us about the spirit that we're
[8:29] dealing with
[8:31] now we see influence plays a great part
[8:34] in politics in news in war and family
[8:41] issues and church situations it can be a
[8:46] very powerful tool look what this kolben
[8:51] 19 has done the influence that has had
[8:54] on the world on the stock market
[9:00] nobody can just like work together we'll
[9:03] make it through this however long it's
[9:06] going to take no let's just go crazy
[9:10] look at the riots the influence that
[9:13] this has had the the Democrats and
[9:18] Republican parties influence mayo and
[9:23] voting there's so much influence out
[9:28] there it's all around us motivated by
[9:34] spirits that are trying to accomplish
[9:37] its will use in human beings
[9:40] now if you've allowed your character to
[9:44] be molded by Christ then your influence
[9:47] can be a powerful tool for God but power
[9:51] to influence others without character is
[9:54] simply satanic so there's no Switzerland
[10:00] in this there's only two spirits what is
[10:04] God and what is the devil Satan was able
[10:11] to create an atmosphere in heaven that
[10:14] was more appealing and more exciting
[10:17] than gods
[10:24] more appealing more excited just want
[10:27] that to soak in he had power to
[10:29] influence other beings created by God
[10:32] against God's will
[10:37] revelations 12 for says that his tail
[10:39] drew a third part of the stars of heaven
[10:42] Jude 1:6 says and the angels which kept
[10:45] not their first estate left their own
[10:48] habitation I mean I am sure that Satan
[10:58] did not leave the next day after God
[11:03] created him no Satan created an
[11:12] atmosphere that was more appealing than
[11:16] truth than God's Word than the eternal
[11:21] life he had the ability to create an
[11:25] atmosphere that looked more appealing
[11:28] that the other angels could gravitate to
[11:32] and say yeah is worth it
[11:35] sake was able to create a will that was
[11:40] more exciting than God's boring will
[11:48] that's why he's so good at being able to
[11:51] do in churches today people want
[11:54] concerts they want to feel good they
[11:56] want to be entertained
[11:58] I can see Satan telling his demon angels
[12:01] let's entertain the people so they'll be
[12:04] less likely to surrender their lives to
[12:06] God we were not born of the Spirit when
[12:15] we were born in the flesh
[12:18] it's a transformation it's a it's a
[12:22] regeneration it
[12:24] nature changed and that God uses all
[12:28] sorts of trials and in times and
[12:30] situations to bring about his character
[12:33] and his nature in us and we have to
[12:36] learn to surrender our lives to God but
[12:43] Saint knows if he entertains us that we
[12:47] won't get serious about having to change
[12:50] her nature now God didn't make any
[12:53] mistakes when he created Lucifer he was
[12:58] an angel of light he bore God's light he
[13:01] led the other angels and worship and
[13:03] other ministries of God God made him
[13:06] perfect in all his ways the motto says
[13:09] Lucifer was flawless
[13:13] until his will became more appealing
[13:16] than his own makers will say Lucifer
[13:24] knew who created him but his will became
[13:32] more appealing than his maker and you've
[13:35] all created something you've all made
[13:37] something can you imagine whatever you
[13:40] made can you imagine brother Mike you
[13:43] make him this nice sign and the sign
[13:46] just gets up and starts walking over
[13:49] here and says I want to say this know I
[13:54] created it for this purpose to give to
[13:59] this person to bless them with this you
[14:03] just can't go over there and do what you
[14:05] want to do but that's what Lucifer did
[14:10] Lucifer started to defile the sanctuary
[14:13] of heaven with his selfishness his pride
[14:19] he wanted to exalt himself above God's
[14:23] will yeah now we don't want to just say
[14:26] above God because we'll never do that
[14:29] but we will about God's will now listen
[14:32] Saints I'm not just telling you a story
[14:34] that happened in heaven I want you to
[14:36] realize that this
[14:37] that's our lives now if you want an idea
[14:40] of what went on in heaven before Satan
[14:43] was cast out true with me to second
[14:45] Timothy chapter 3 second Timothy chapter
[14:49] 3 verse number one we're gonna read the
[14:52] first five verses there now the
[14:58] scripture starts out this know also that
[14:59] in the last days perilous times shall
[15:02] come
[15:04] this is just the manifestation of really
[15:08] went on in heaven now we just want to
[15:12] read it like this Satan became a lover
[15:15] of himself Calvinists
[15:20] bolster proud blasphemer
[15:24] can you say Amen is that not what
[15:26] Lucifer did in heaven disobedient to his
[15:29] creator unfaithful for what God did for
[15:34] him he became unholy without natural
[15:38] affection for God and the other angels
[15:42] he became a juice breaker a false
[15:46] accuser I imagine he was falsely
[15:49] accusing God to the other angels trying
[15:54] to get him on his side incontinent
[15:56] fierce despisers of those angels who
[16:00] would not side with him traitor heady
[16:05] highminded lovers of his own pleasure
[16:08] more than a lover of God's will God's
[16:13] will became - boring - boring Satan kept
[16:19] a form of his godliness but he denied
[16:23] the power to live right from such turn
[16:26] away
[16:28] same thing that's happening in the last
[16:31] days in the church he got the influence
[16:37] right through to the church Satan is the
[16:42] master of deceit there's no one that can
[16:46] influence a person a home a business or
[16:49] a church for selfish reasons like Satan
[16:53] can yes he creates his selfish
[16:57] atmosphere and offers personal gain
[17:01] instead of character to people first he
[17:07] offers personal gain over character like
[17:10] the Pharisees they love the praises of
[17:13] men more than they loved praising God
[17:18] think about that they did what they
[17:21] character to praise God they wanted the
[17:23] praises of men more they wanted
[17:25] recognition they wanted something down
[17:28] here they wanted their will it was more
[17:31] appealing than God deserves all the
[17:34] glory personal gain over character I
[17:40] hope you're seeing look at what look at
[17:45] let's take a look at what happened in
[17:47] the Garden of Eden Satan influenced the
[17:49] most subtle beast of God's creation and
[17:52] perverted him away from God's will now
[17:56] we're talking about the most subtle
[17:57] beast not talking about Eve right now
[18:00] say he influenced the most subtle beast
[18:03] of all God's creation there was only one
[18:08] hire that was man yes Satan created an
[18:13] atmosphere that he enjoyed and wanted to
[18:19] benefit from Saint created an atmosphere
[18:24] that the most subtle beasts enjoyed
[18:29] thought this would be a good idea that
[18:33] he could benefit from Satan may have
[18:37] told him
[18:39] isn't Eve so beautiful she's right in
[18:44] the image with God himself you know
[18:47] wouldn't it be nice to be like her
[18:50] closer to God cuz you know she's closer
[18:54] to God she's in the image you're not
[18:59] right now you can only bring forth of
[19:02] your kind but if you were to be with her
[19:05] you could bring the human race right
[19:08] into your kind and make a greater and
[19:11] more intelligent super subtle race that
[19:17] was appealing to the most subtle Beast
[19:20] it wasn't like he hat you know put him
[19:24] out of headlock and beat him up he
[19:28] influenced him because that most subtle
[19:31] beast muted himself willingly and said
[19:35] this is a good idea I don't want to be
[19:37] down here I'd rather be closer to the
[19:40] image of God so Satan created an
[19:47] atmosphere that influenced the most
[19:49] subtle beast to carry out his idea
[19:51] because this is really came from Satan
[19:54] himself after submitting to Satan's
[20:00] enticement the most soft obese led his
[20:03] vessel to the devil he said have your
[20:07] way I'm in unity with this influence
[20:10] right Romans chapter 6 verse 16 says
[20:14] know ye not that to whom you huge
[20:16] yourselves servants to obey his servants
[20:19] ye are whether eat to whom you obey
[20:21] whether of sin unto death or of
[20:23] obedience on two rights and scientists
[20:26] I'll probably get back to the scripture
[20:27] but I want you to understand that we
[20:29] have the ability to healed our vessel to
[20:32] one influence or the other now
[20:36] while under the anointing of the tree of
[20:39] knowledge of good and evil the most
[20:41] subtle beasts began to create an
[20:43] atmosphere around Eve
[20:49] and Eve was enticed in the wrong
[20:54] atmosphere if she wouldn't have been if
[20:58] she wouldn't have got in the wrong out
[21:01] in this fear if she wouldn't allowed the
[21:03] wrong atmosphere see you
[21:09] I believe Eve was allowed to be around
[21:15] the most subdue beasts Eve was not
[21:21] around not allowed to go eat of the tree
[21:25] of knowledge of good evil which was the
[21:26] spirit of the devil that got inside that
[21:30] most of the beasts so we can't trust one
[21:35] another you couldn't trust that most of
[21:42] the beasts got her in trouble
[21:50] hey any one of us can go off the deep
[21:53] end
[21:56] give it time I tell you that does not
[21:59] the Bible say if the Lord doesn't come
[22:02] there be no flesh saved if you don't
[22:04] come quickly he keeps waiting things are
[22:06] just getting ridiculous
[22:10] that's why it's important to be in the
[22:12] right atmosphere to create the right
[22:15] atmosphere and to live in it and you
[22:18] have the ability to create the right
[22:20] atmosphere when it's wrong and to stay
[22:23] right there in it it's not always about
[22:27] the atmosphere that your flesh and Joy's
[22:31] but you must maintain an atmosphere
[22:33] around you that's best for your soul
[22:37] right we all know what it's like to be
[22:40] in an atmosphere that we enjoy that's
[22:41] not good for our soul I want us to turn
[22:47] to Genesis chapter 3 and just maybe read
[22:51] a little about it as we as we read in
[22:55] Genesis chapter so I want you to keep in
[22:56] mind that Satan wanted to produce an
[22:59] offspring and have a kingdom that was
[23:02] greater than God's but he couldn't
[23:05] create an offspring right he couldn't
[23:08] create so he perverted God's creation
[23:13] and how Satan enticed Eve to the most
[23:18] subtle beast with the idea that she
[23:21] could be in control of her will and
[23:23] choose her own will why wait for God we
[23:33] all are enticed with that thing all you
[23:40] gotta do is think about all the things
[23:41] you want to do and you don't even think
[23:42] about saying the Lord will and if you do
[23:44] say the Lord won't you don't really mean
[23:45] it you're just saying because it's the
[23:46] thing to say it doesn't come from the
[23:49] heart comes from the head it's like
[23:50] quoting scriptures the double quote
[23:52] scriptures
[23:57] Satan gave the most up to be something
[24:00] that God didn't offer God wasn't gonna
[24:05] offer the most subtle beasts to be
[24:08] anything more than what God created him
[24:10] to be but Satan could offer him more
[24:20] yeah just like he offers us more yeah
[24:24] and now Satan is going to offer
[24:28] something to Eve that God didn't offer
[24:34] remember brother Graham says Satan God
[24:37] Eve to lust after knowledge all right
[24:42] let's begin reading Genesis chapter 3
[24:45] now this the serpent was more subtil
[24:49] than any beast of the field which the
[24:52] Lord God had made and he said unto the
[24:54] woman he ate have God said ye shall not
[24:59] eat of every tree of the garden noticed
[25:05] he took only part of the truth it's true
[25:09] because he did say the word you can eat
[25:12] of every tree but he left out the except
[25:17] yes but he's still quoted part of it why
[25:21] because Satan always gives us a part of
[25:24] the truth to get us off if he just came
[25:28] to us with pitchforks and fire and and
[25:31] negative evil we would never listen to
[25:34] him but he comes to us with a part of
[25:37] the truth so we listen and soon as we
[25:39] listen it sounds right and that
[25:41] reasoning is what catches us
[25:45] and a woman said unto the serpent we may
[25:51] eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[25:53] garden but hallelujah
[25:56] but she knew the word but of the fruit
[25:59] of the tree which is in the midst of the
[26:00] garden of God in the garden God hath
[26:04] said ye shall not eat of it neither
[26:06] shall ye touch it lest you die so she
[26:11] gave the word back she gave the word
[26:16] right back to him praise God that's what
[26:19] we're supposed to do but you know Satan
[26:26] wasn't giving up he had convinced that
[26:31] most subtle beasts if you really want to
[26:35] be more superior and be more like Eve
[26:38] you got to make this happen I know it's
[26:43] how he had a determination he wasn't
[26:46] gonna give up
[26:47] and the serpent began to beguile Eve and
[26:53] said unto the woman ye shall not surely
[26:58] die oh my I got confusion in my mind
[27:01] right now all all until this very moment
[27:08] I've always heard preached that if I
[27:10] partake of that tree I'm gonna die and I
[27:13] even told them oh so two beasts she
[27:17] probably did not recognize who it was
[27:20] that was speaking to her that it really
[27:22] was at the loss of toby's but it was
[27:24] really Satan inside a more subtle beast
[27:29] why it's important that we understand
[27:32] what spirit speaking to us and I don't
[27:34] care who's talking for God doth know
[27:42] that in the day ye eat thereof then your
[27:46] eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as
[27:49] God's knowing good and evil right there
[27:52] she lusted for that ability to be able
[27:57] to to discern to know what was good to
[28:00] know what was evil
[28:01] she wanted her eyes to me she wanted to
[28:03] be like God we need to be careful maybe
[28:17] there are certain things that God does
[28:20] not want you to get into maybe he wants
[28:26] you to take the Prophet for what it what
[28:28] he said maybe he just want you to
[28:32] believe trust him yeah because if you
[28:40] start going in an area maybe the enemy
[28:44] will be right there just to confuse you
[28:46] because this is really what happened
[28:48] right to eat she got confused
[28:52] she thought God was holding out on her
[28:57] you mean there's something that I could
[29:00] get by doing this that God didn't give
[29:03] me it's appealing Satan's influence is
[29:12] always appealing for your will but not
[29:17] gods
[29:23] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[29:26] good for food and that it was pleasant
[29:28] for the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[29:31] make one wise she took of the fruit
[29:34] thereof and did eat and gave also unto
[29:38] her husband with her and he did eat and
[29:41] the eyes of them both were opened and
[29:44] they knew that they were naked and they
[29:47] sewed fig leaves together and made them
[29:48] aprons and when they heard the voice of
[29:50] the God walking in the in the garden in
[29:53] the cool of the day and Adam and Adam
[30:00] and his wife hid themselves from the
[30:03] presence of the Lord God amongst the
[30:05] trees of the garden when we feel that
[30:11] feeling of wanting to hide something's
[30:15] wrong I'm not saying that we should all
[30:20] be picture-perfect but we got to
[30:23] understand what spirit is influencing us
[30:30] the power of influence should never be
[30:36] taken lightly it's a very powerful force
[30:40] when you read Genesis chapter 4 it's
[30:43] also quite easy to see how Satan
[30:44] influenced Cain he got mad he got mad at
[30:50] God for not accepting the sacrifice as
[30:55] well as he got mad at Abel for being
[30:58] accepted by God and if he just got rid
[31:04] of him got rid of them God would have to
[31:07] look at him the influence that Satan has
[31:13] my brother branham said if we go and we
[31:16] actually say something that affects the
[31:19] influence of you looking at somebody in
[31:22] a negative way
[31:24] [Music]
[31:25] it's really the same spirit and so eat
[31:30] therefore you're guilty of the same
[31:33] murder and look at this Kane murdered
[31:40] Abel yeah course Jesus gave Satan the
[31:46] credit he was a liar from the beginning
[31:49] a murderer from the beginning the
[31:51] influence came from him but the point
[31:54] that I'm trying to say to you when you
[31:56] actually feel negative towards somebody
[31:59] yeah you you think you're right
[32:06] Kane thought he was right get rid of
[32:08] Abel because God wasn't fair with him
[32:16] sacrifice look beautiful who wants some
[32:20] blood all over you anyways so when you
[32:28] go and you're tempted to think something
[32:30] negative about somebody to say something
[32:33] negative about somebody remember it may
[32:37] seem so right in your eyes so did it
[32:41] came yeah you can't go by that you have
[32:44] to go by simply one thing it's wrong to
[32:48] do it yeah it's evil to do it so wrong
[32:51] influence God did not make us in that
[32:57] position he put us in it in a position
[33:03] to find the wrong things about our lives
[33:06] and to work on them are you with me now
[33:14] you might say well now brother John Cain
[33:17] was of that wicked one he was serpent
[33:22] seed and that's why it all happened
[33:25] nothing really to do with the power of
[33:28] influence I'm just gonna go on
[33:30] you know predestination seed for a
[33:33] moment okay if that's true then
[33:36] tell me why then evil why was the
[33:42] serpent seed as well think think about
[33:45] this for a second
[33:49] Eve was that serpent seed but she got
[33:57] under the power of influence so whether
[34:02] you're God's seed or serpent seed the
[34:05] power of influence can affect you the
[34:07] same you just can't go by on the child
[34:12] of God or they're not a child of God
[34:14] we're talking about the power of
[34:17] influence is very strong never ever
[34:21] underestimate the power of influence
[34:23] with all the thoughts that come into
[34:25] your mind you're always being influenced
[34:29] now listen to this by one spirit or
[34:31] another all the time
[34:32] there's no Switzerland in your thoughts
[34:36] and the influence now sometimes it's
[34:42] real obvious to see which one is which
[34:44] when you're getting bombarded a lot from
[34:46] the devil or even have any places just
[34:50] praising God and you're crying and
[34:51] you're loving him it's easy to see those
[34:54] but there are times that the spirits are
[34:57] so close so close that's when there's
[35:05] most religious that it's right
[35:08] doctrinally perhaps but the spirit could
[35:14] be wrong because Satan does use the word
[35:17] he does use a cracks it well that person
[35:20] did punch me in the face they did run me
[35:23] off the road they did say this about me
[35:26] they wrote this about me facts yes but
[35:33] does not give us any spirit to come
[35:36] against them
[35:40] you always always want to be under the
[35:44] influence of the right spirit but it
[35:45] don't happen by because we're elect now
[35:52] one spirit will lead you just like it
[35:56] led Christ to lay down your life yeah to
[36:01] help others yes to carry out God's will
[36:05] that's that's all that that Jesus did he
[36:08] lay down his life to carry out the will
[36:10] of the Father
[36:11] ain't gonna be any different in you and
[36:14] I now you're a child of God and we need
[36:20] to present our bodies back to God
[36:25] Hebrews chapter 6 verse 9 but beloved we
[36:28] are persuaded better things of you
[36:31] and the things that accompany salvation
[36:35] so God's Spirit is expecting other
[36:43] things of us yes than other people that
[36:45] call himself Christians yes and don't
[36:51] you think he has a higher expectation of
[36:53] his bride yes look he had a higher
[36:56] expectation of job have you not
[36:59] considered my job like my job have you
[37:02] not considered my servant job there is
[37:05] none like him and all the world yes I
[37:10] want to be like that don't want to go
[37:12] through what he went through but I want
[37:13] to be like that but you know I'll just
[37:15] say it like this you don't have to go
[37:18] through what he went through to become
[37:19] what he is because he was that before he
[37:22] went through it
[37:25] we can be like him we can be under the
[37:29] influence of the Holy Spirit Romans
[37:33] chapter 12 verse 1 I'm talking about the
[37:37] one spirit that's influencing you that's
[37:39] leading you I beseech you therefore
[37:41] brethren by the mercies of God that you
[37:43] present your body a living sacrifice
[37:45] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[37:49] reasonable service so you're a child of
[37:54] God you're his bride present your body
[37:57] back to God
[37:58] yes well what does that mean brother
[38:01] John won't care to know what it means
[38:04] don't let the thing the word just go off
[38:07] your back and like I lied whatever it
[38:09] sounds too much like responsibility
[38:11] don't want to think about it if you're
[38:15] real serious about really wanting to
[38:17] make sure you're being influenced by the
[38:18] right spirit you've got to listen to
[38:21] what I'm saying you can see brother's
[38:25] how this is tying in with trying the
[38:28] spirit now the other spirit the other
[38:31] spirit because there's only two that's
[38:33] going to influence you the other spirit
[38:35] will lead you to exercise your own will
[38:41] your own rights yes you don't have to
[38:45] lay down your life it might say
[38:51] something like this now if you're a a
[38:52] child of God didn't God say that you
[38:56] could eat of every tree of the garden
[38:59] and just kind of like leave something
[39:01] else then the Bible say that Christ paid
[39:05] your debt it's not by works you can
[39:08] never be saved by your own merits kind
[39:11] of omit part of the word yeah never
[39:17] telling you this part I would like to
[39:19] see Satan come and tell you this that if
[39:23] Christ died for us then we're all dead
[39:25] and that we should not henceforth live
[39:28] unto ourselves but unto Him which died
[39:31] for us and rose again lay down our lives
[39:34] for the Brethren
[39:36] and it's a different spirit saying this
[39:40] now we're gonna do that now the satan
[39:45] spirit may say you're you're an
[39:48] automatic heir with Christ if you be the
[39:53] elect of God you can't be deceived I
[39:55] mean it's worth now think about this
[39:57] predestination is in the Bible it's a
[39:59] real word and it really means something
[40:02] but why did God fear say that Minister
[40:09] should stay away from it but they don't
[40:13] feel that fear of God they think they
[40:16] got it all handled because Satan can
[40:21] take that word and confuse people make
[40:26] him feel secure when they ought to be
[40:29] stretching forth demarcus making sure
[40:33] that they're doing the rest of the
[40:35] things that the satan has left out
[40:38] remember when Jesus told the Pharisees
[40:40] he said he said you've taken part of the
[40:44] word but you've left out the weightier
[40:46] matters of life yeah Satan does that so
[40:55] I understand these scriptures I
[40:56] understand you let can be to see if I
[40:58] understand that we're we're joint heirs
[41:00] with Christ
[41:07] do you know that what kind of thoughts
[41:10] will lead a carnal mind to believe when
[41:13] those are spoken to them to believe that
[41:16] they're never wrong a carnal mind be
[41:23] deceived God sent a prophet to tell us
[41:28] that we should always bear a spirit and
[41:32] an attitude that I could be wrong it's a
[41:40] good quote it's a good thing to say but
[41:46] to live that spirit to live out that
[41:49] everyday
[41:52] st. always leave something out that's
[42:01] why I want to say the Lord willing let's
[42:08] take a look at it in Matthew chapter 4
[42:11] how this other in this other spirit
[42:14] influenced Jesus to do his own will
[42:22] Matthew chapter 4 7 word verse number 1
[42:26] so awful quite in here I don't see the
[42:28] pages out of here no amens it's like a
[42:30] wake-up we're having Church today don't
[42:36] let the influence you to you know go
[42:39] night night then was Jesus led up of the
[42:44] Spirit to the runners to be tempted of
[42:46] the devil God will allow you to go in
[42:51] the ring with the devil and when he had
[42:56] fasted forty days and forty nights he
[42:59] was afterward a hungered and when the
[43:02] tempter came to him he said if thou be
[43:05] the Son of God command these stones to
[43:08] be made bread well we know that he was
[43:13] he was creating an atmosphere here
[43:19] manipulation if thou be the Son of God
[43:21] if you're a real Christian then why
[43:26] don't you just take God's Word and just
[43:28] say this so you can see that there was
[43:36] truth
[43:42] Cobin 19 and this whole mess up and of
[43:45] the world and and being away from it has
[43:47] got people so distracted in so many
[43:50] different places going and doing so many
[43:52] different things I just don't see I see
[44:01] it's an opportunity for the devil to
[44:03] take advantage of it I got thinking I
[44:06] got you know the Bible says smite the
[44:07] shepherd the sheep was scattered I think
[44:10] Satan found a way to scatter sheep
[44:13] without smite the Shepherd so much
[44:18] division in this message we need to come
[44:26] together pray for one another because we
[44:28] need God's grace and help I need your
[44:31] prayers we need one another's prayers
[44:35] we're not in a place where we're just a
[44:37] little bit better than the other and he
[44:44] answered in verse 4 and said it is
[44:46] written man shall not live by bread
[44:49] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[44:51] out of the mouth of God now notice what
[44:53] he was saying here don't come to me with
[44:56] your Sh
[44:57] to try to get me to buy into that I
[45:01] gotta take the whole word Saint gets
[45:05] most people because he gives them the
[45:09] word so they can yeah that's good
[45:22] brother so they could reason whatever
[45:23] they're going through
[45:31] then the devil taketh him up into a holy
[45:35] city and setting him on a pinnacle of
[45:37] the temple and with each temptation
[45:41] you're gonna see here that Satan lifts
[45:45] up Jesus more lifts him up takes him up
[45:53] higher makes them feel better offers him
[45:56] more you'll see it
[46:02] Satan was trying to influence Jesus he
[46:08] took him up higher to a pentacle trying
[46:12] to manipulate him and he sayeth on the
[46:15] in verse 6 if thou be the Son of God
[46:16] cast thyself dumb for it is written he
[46:20] shall give his angels charge concerning
[46:22] thee and in their hands they shall bear
[46:24] thee up lest thou lest at any time thou
[46:27] dash thy foot against a stone he is
[46:29] quoting the same word of God that the
[46:34] most subtle beast oh my did you know
[46:39] that most subtle beasts knew the word of
[46:43] God and he knew how to only speak part
[46:49] of the word and lead part of it out so
[46:55] he's good at that
[46:56] he's good at when we come to church only
[47:00] take part of the message that deals the
[47:02] best that we know we're already doing
[47:04] that we can feel like we're a Christian
[47:06] about but you don't have to worry about
[47:09] anything that makes that challenges you
[47:14] because that just makes you feel bad did
[47:18] you ever like a coach when you played
[47:21] your heart out you did your best
[47:23] and he says come on you can do better
[47:25] than that
[47:27] I always like the one's a good good job
[47:31] good job
[47:32] way to go out there but a good coach he
[47:38] sees your potential you may think you're
[47:42] there but he knows there's more in you
[47:45] the bride there's more in the bride just
[47:49] because we're bride it doesn't that
[47:51] doesn't mean anything we still have to
[47:52] get there get to a place with us pottery
[47:55] can we have to be ready so it's okay for
[48:01] him to cause us to get culture to him
[48:04] amen verse number seven Jesus said unto
[48:08] Him it is written again you missed part
[48:12] of the word thou shall not tempt the
[48:15] LORD thy God it's important to know the
[48:19] word because Satan's coming to you with
[48:24] part of the word tomorrow and if you
[48:28] reason with that thing
[48:30] he'll influence you the wrong way with
[48:33] God's Word look at this verse 8 again to
[48:39] take the devil taketh him up into
[48:42] exceeding high mountain and showing him
[48:45] all the kingdoms of the world of the
[48:47] gourd he just kept takin him up he'll do
[48:50] that to you he'll give you a good
[48:52] feeling get you up there
[48:54] make you feel like you don't have to you
[48:56] to the Lord and he saith unto Him all
[49:03] these things will I give thee if thou
[49:07] will fall down and worship Me but he
[49:12] says that to everyone of us in so many
[49:14] words
[49:16] then say it Jesus on him get thee hence
[49:19] Satan I want to stop this conversation
[49:24] I'm done with it get behind me
[49:28] thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and
[49:32] him only shalt thou serve in other words
[49:35] I am NOT going to serve myself because
[49:39] when you serve yourself you're serving
[49:41] the devil notice the devil leaved him
[49:48] left him and angels came in minister
[49:51] right afterwards you know we just don't
[49:55] have time to do everything
[50:01] you
[50:06] you
[50:18] it's awful quiet I'm glad you got
[50:21] something with me saw the piece you're
[50:23] not serious about that too serious about
[50:25] that
[50:29] remember when Satan quotes to you the
[50:31] word or the message of the hour he will
[50:33] always leave something out and there's a
[50:38] purpose for that a little bit off he
[50:42] can't get us to go to a bar he can't get
[50:44] us to drink a fifth or whiskey but he
[50:47] can just you think about that he said
[50:53] he's a Christian he's a message because
[51:00] he's influencing you to relax and steer
[51:04] you away from giving yourself your all
[51:08] to the Lord
[51:09] that's not trying to do if you can stay
[51:12] a mediocre Christian if you could just
[51:14] come to church pay your eyes just keep
[51:17] doing that that's all that really
[51:19] matters this thing about getting ready
[51:21] well the blood makes you ready I don't
[51:26] know why it's so quiet doing right now
[51:30] you know we should just pack up we're
[51:32] different
[51:33] hey we're of the group that's ready to
[51:35] go we don't have to search anymore
[51:36] would just stay at home and we'll wait
[51:40] all will come and we won't have
[51:42] preaching we'll just have singing
[51:43] worship testify come on come on where do
[51:49] you want to take this God is
[51:56] you
[52:02] you
[52:11] more and we can't give more until we're
[52:15] gonna be challenged to get more because
[52:18] the devil don't want you to get more
[52:19] he's doing everything he can to get you
[52:22] not to give more you've given enough
[52:24] you've given your life to God I just go
[52:28] through the course of the day and I
[52:29] think you may be alone with your
[52:33] thoughts and still be greatly influenced
[52:37] or you may be talking to someone direct
[52:40] and become influenced or you may hear
[52:42] somebody talking and be influenced by
[52:45] what you hear but you are always being
[52:48] influenced by one spirit or another now
[52:51] that's kind of scary yeah now you know
[52:53] what we do for Christians we just give
[52:56] everybody the benefit no not a curse I'm
[53:01] supposed to be good and I understand
[53:07] about giving the benefit of the doubt
[53:09] but to me you don't give the benefit of
[53:12] the doubt blindly no matter what to
[53:14] everybody for everything how are you
[53:18] gonna try the spirit to see if it's of
[53:20] the Lord or not when there's a it's
[53:26] something that just doesn't make sense
[53:28] to you
[53:30] when there's a puzzling situation you
[53:35] just can't clearly see what just give
[53:37] the benefit the doubt move on
[53:43] I could be wrong I'm not gonna sit here
[53:49] and judge when I don't know I saw you
[53:59] speeding today
[54:01] no I didn't I saw it well I didn't all
[54:06] right I believe you
[54:07] god bless you you give the benefit of
[54:12] the doubt when it's it's obvious you
[54:14] can't know for sure but you don't walk
[54:19] around everybody you're talking to every
[54:20] time they're talking to you that's God
[54:21] talking to you don't do that they could
[54:26] be under a spirit that they're deceiving
[54:28] they don't know it now whichever one of
[54:35] these atmospheres you you'd yourself to
[54:38] is the very one that you'll be
[54:40] influenced by and the one that you are
[54:42] influenced by is the one that you will
[54:44] influence others by yes you can see that
[54:48] between Satan more subtle beast Eve oops
[54:54] just just what flows right through God
[54:57] is God is looking for vessels they use
[55:00] an insane
[55:08] you
[55:18] the blind lead the blind they all fall
[55:22] in the ditch yeah we need to know who
[55:28] we're following I love this I love the
[55:34] word I love that I'm imperfect you're
[55:40] okay with that and you know if I preach
[55:46] something that's not kind that's
[55:48] contrary to this word that's your duty
[55:52] that's your job our confidence is in the
[56:00] word God is allowed to use human beings
[56:04] who are imperfect in fact he loves
[56:09] showing off 7th grade education
[56:12] hillbillies amen
[56:20] remember when the angel of the Lord told
[56:23] brother Branham that he liked to saw
[56:25] Moni believe it wasn't because he liked
[56:30] to be no it was the message that we need
[56:37] to start exercising more which is to
[56:39] believe to come to church with the
[56:40] excitement of believing this word more
[56:43] than just yeah I never liked that but I
[56:48] agree no all they believe this is to
[56:52] help you and the more that you receive
[56:54] it inside the more you can walk out and
[56:58] not be influenced by the wrong spirit
[57:01] and therefore not let your body be used
[57:04] to influence others wrong and not even
[57:06] know what you're doing a lot of times we
[57:09] manipulate certain situations as certain
[57:12] people and say certain things about
[57:13] certain things just to get something to
[57:16] happen I wasn't gonna say that don't
[57:20] know where that came from but that is
[57:21] the truth because we're steering so bad
[57:25] how we want something
[57:28] and we think we're so right about what
[57:31] we see lord help us the angel of the
[57:38] Lord was creating a challenging
[57:40] atmosphere for the people to believe I
[57:45] can see that it wasn't just why I kind
[57:49] of I'm gonna send this song over song so
[57:51] cuz I really like it no we've got to
[57:57] believe God's Word war than what we're
[58:01] believing when we
[58:10] Joe Gabriel was set to deliver God's
[58:13] Word to Mary he started out telling her
[58:17] that she was highly favored and God was
[58:20] with her he was creating a good
[58:22] atmosphere or right atmosphere and he

[59:59] doesn't show up for a while the word
[1:00:05] that's being preached to us is to build
[1:00:08] an atmosphere cross to believe I'm just
[1:00:16] gonna take a few minutes more please
[1:00:18] bear with me
[1:00:19] I never want to hold people's time now
[1:00:27] remember at all times not only when we
[1:00:30] are influenced by some spirit but all
[1:00:35] the time
[1:00:36] continuously we are being influenced by
[1:00:39] spirits whether we're alone with
[1:00:43] somebody talking hearing somebody
[1:00:45] they're spirits that are dealing with us
[1:00:53] and those spirits that are influencing
[1:00:57] us are trying to cause us to influence
[1:01:02] others with Jesus he said now you don't
[1:01:09] know what I've done but you're gonna
[1:01:11] know soon I want you to go wash one
[1:01:13] another's feet yes he said now you're my
[1:01:17] disciples and I'm leaving you now but I
[1:01:20] want you to go yell preach this gospel
[1:01:22] every creature that spirit was
[1:01:24] influencing his disciples
[1:01:28] the very same thing he did when he stood
[1:01:31] and he looked at the multitude he's and
[1:01:33] he he looked at them with compassion
[1:01:34] today they're they're sheep without a
[1:01:36] shepherd of course they won't you do
[1:01:43] anything but that I just I want to read
[1:01:48] this quote to you can I read a little
[1:01:49] bit we created an atmosphere around us
[1:01:52] that influences others as well the
[1:01:55] transcendent message identification it
[1:01:57] says now you have seen people that you
[1:01:59] just love to be around yet they might
[1:02:03] not bracket of society and again they
[1:02:07] might be of a different race they're the
[1:02:10] colored or the brown or the yellow but
[1:02:15] there is just something about that
[1:02:17] character that you just love be loved to
[1:02:20] be in their presence he says because
[1:02:23] each person is a little dynamo of their
[1:02:28] own and you put out in an atmosphere
[1:02:31] yeah every one of you like it or not put
[1:02:35] out an atmosphere I don't care if you're
[1:02:39] quiet
[1:02:40] they're quiet one among us or the
[1:02:42] loudest one among us there's an
[1:02:45] atmosphere that you put out and I'm
[1:02:50] talking about God's will God's presence
[1:02:55] or that Devils will which is presenting
[1:03:00] you to do your will right either one and
[1:03:03] then you see people that were noble but
[1:03:07] yet you were always bad to get away from
[1:03:10] them it's just they create such an
[1:03:15] atmosphere around where you are nothing
[1:03:19] against them they're nice people but you
[1:03:22] just don't like the atmosphere they're
[1:03:25] in yeah
[1:03:27] now listen to this he said and their
[1:03:29] character creates whatever they are yes
[1:03:33] it makes them what they are yeah see the
[1:03:37] atmosphere that we create comes from
[1:03:39] what we are inside and the message is
[1:03:45] your life worthy of the gospel brother
[1:03:47] Branham says and did you know you are a
[1:03:49] little Creator yourself yes you know
[1:03:51] that certainly you've seen people that
[1:03:54] you just love to be around you don't
[1:03:56] know why you just love that type of
[1:03:57] person have you seen that congregation
[1:03:59] says Amen have you seen that okay
[1:04:03] just as kind there you are like to be
[1:04:06] around them they create the atmosphere
[1:04:08] by the life they live yeah the way they
[1:04:13] talk and their conversation then you've
[1:04:17] seen those that every time you you
[1:04:20] shunned them all time they want to talk
[1:04:25] about something evil if I understand
[1:04:33] correctly God said there's none good
[1:04:40] they're all evil why because they all
[1:04:43] seek their own they all seek their own
[1:04:47] they want to do their own thing right so
[1:04:51] what evil are they talking about come on
[1:04:56] the quicker you answer these questions
[1:04:58] the quicker we're gonna be over Church
[1:05:01] self self will self will is evil yes
[1:05:14] all the time they want to talk about
[1:05:16] something evil and talk about somebody
[1:05:18] say oh my there they come they're going
[1:05:22] to criticize somebody there he's in here
[1:05:25] now he's going to talk about this man
[1:05:27] all they were doing is tell or something
[1:05:32] about women or something like that you
[1:05:35] just hate to get around them see they
[1:05:38] create seemingly pretty nice people but
[1:05:42] they create that atmosphere yeah and the
[1:05:45] things that you think on and the things
[1:05:48] that you do the actions the things you
[1:05:50] talk about
[1:05:51] creates an atmosphere you don't have to
[1:05:57] be sitting in front of a television for
[1:05:59] eight hours be all things you think
[1:06:05] about so we create an atmosphere around
[1:06:08] us no doubt about it if the Holy Spirit
[1:06:11] is influencing you at the time it will
[1:06:14] eventually lead people to Christ what
[1:06:19] did the Holy Spirit do to you what does
[1:06:21] it do to you
[1:06:24] is it going to use you different than
[1:06:27] how he deals with you
[1:06:30] what is he interested about you getting
[1:06:33] ready to make it to make a rapture first
[1:06:39] we have to get saved right gotta walk up
[1:06:42] this seven steps of perfection yes we
[1:06:47] can't be like the the rabbit and just
[1:06:50] get distracted go run over here
[1:06:52] go run over there stay in the race keep
[1:06:58] marching forward and if they already
[1:07:01] know Christ then the spirit inside of
[1:07:05] you is going to influence them to a
[1:07:07] higher walk with Christ because that's
[1:07:10] who Christ is now if you're under a
[1:07:15] carnal atmosphere in your mind usually
[1:07:18] influenced by a different spirit it will
[1:07:22] not lead people to Jesus or how to make
[1:07:26] him Lord of their lives or a closer walk
[1:07:30] for them no sir it won't do that a
[1:07:32] carnal influence is anything but that
[1:07:38] anything but that it's all about the
[1:07:44] spirits motive that's creating the
[1:07:47] atmosphere in your mind if it's God
[1:07:52] spirit he's serious about getting us
[1:07:54] ready he cares about our soul about the
[1:07:58] condition where it's at and where he
[1:08:00] wants it and how to help us
[1:08:04] and you know what he's still laying down
[1:08:07] his life for the brother he's just doing
[1:08:10] it inside of you now if it's not God's
[1:08:14] Spirit then well it's certainly that
[1:08:19] spirit or those spirits or who's ever
[1:08:21] talking is not really serious about
[1:08:23] getting ready
[1:08:27] they may make you feel like they care
[1:08:31] about you about your flesh but not about
[1:08:34] yourself because they're not even
[1:08:35] dealing with it not interested in going
[1:08:39] the Second Mile not interested in
[1:08:41] sacrificing laying down his life and if
[1:08:44] you recognize these two spirits when
[1:08:46] you're thinking thoughts it's going to
[1:08:48] be easy to see
[1:08:49] I like the influence that nameís
[1:08:53] servants had unnamed they could have
[1:08:56] just been off talking about whatever you
[1:09:00] know there's you know pretty big fish in
[1:09:03] that Jordan River I didn't want to say
[1:09:10] that because we got fishermen in here
[1:09:14] but there was an interest and if you're
[1:09:18] a servant of God you're interested in
[1:09:20] helping someone that may be even higher
[1:09:22] than you a servant is helping others
[1:09:33] influence what are we influenced I I can
[1:09:37] influence brother Mark that he will
[1:09:47] that will be such good friends and he
[1:09:52] would let me use his car you can
[1:09:56] influence people for personal gain
[1:09:59] that's the same thing that same is doing
[1:10:02] he influences people for personal gain
[1:10:04] what's his personal gain he wants to
[1:10:06] exalt his throne above the throne of God
[1:10:09] God is interested in getting people
[1:10:11] closer to him when he gets us convinced
[1:10:16] that we're pretty close right now it's
[1:10:19] very easy to get involved in something
[1:10:21] else let's say you are close to God why
[1:10:25] don't you help somebody like there's no
[1:10:29] excuse for us not being anointed by the
[1:10:33] Spirit of God led by the Spirit of God
[1:10:35] to help somebody any spirit that's
[1:10:40] separate from that that doesn't do that
[1:10:42] it's influencing you just a little bit
[1:10:44] off track 9 understand we've got to go
[1:10:46] to talk about other things I understand
[1:10:51] that I don't let it control right start
[1:11:00] allowing God to use you present your
[1:11:03] body to him and let him use you to help
[1:11:06] the person you're talking to you're
[1:11:08] talking to him anyways let it help them
[1:11:13] let the Lord use you let's stand
[1:11:15] together
[1:11:23] thank you for your patience amen that's
[1:11:30] about a heart in prayer just whatever
[1:11:33] you desire in your heart concerning what
[1:11:36] the Lord has spoken to you tonight just
[1:11:38] place that before him we all want to be
[1:11:44] not only more aware what spirits

[1:12:38] the course of tomorrow and the next day
[1:12:42] and the next day and begin to think
[1:12:45] about the influence that is coming into

[1:12:53] and and lord help us to quickly see is

[1:14:22] spirit of this message in which it was
[1:14:25] preached and that you were rightly
