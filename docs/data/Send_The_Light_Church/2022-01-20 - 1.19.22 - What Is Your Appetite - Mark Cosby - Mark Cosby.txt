TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] he's all i need jesus is all i need he's all he's all i need jesus is all i need amen amen allah about our heads word of prayer before we begin dear heavenly father we're just so thankful to be here tonight lord just thank you for your precious grace and mercy lord that's carried us this far lord we know it's going to carry us all the way till we go home lord father we would just we come here lord not to fellowship with one another lord but to fellowship with you lord may we just have such a sweet communion lord as your holy spirit would just fall down upon us lord just speak to us the things that we're lacking lord the things that we need in our lives lord and father just fill us so full with your holy spirit lord that's all we're thinking about is your plan and purpose lord and father we open these this this holy word lord any man can turn the pages lord but only you can bring that word to life lord that that word lord just live in us lord let the message that we hear today from you lord that it be it's a lived out life lord we love you and thank you lord jesus christ we can be seated uh real fast um just want to share a little testimony about how we got to this point i guess um you know here today uh so it all started back in september of last year late september i went to the men's meeting and i'll tell you one thing from that men's meeting i was just changed i haven't been the same person since then those those meetings just it just changed me that's all i can say and i remember i think like a week after the men's meeting uh i was sitting on my bed studying from the men's meeting and the lord just spoke and said i want you to preach and i'm like huh and i was just i thought maybe it was just you know maybe just me just you know thinking it and then i just i just couldn't some of my heart i couldn't let it go it just wouldn't stop and then i didn't talk to brother john about it and i just knew the lord wanted me to preach and just like what song leading the same thing i was running away from song leading and i i learned when the lord is calling you to do something don't run away so when i heard the lord speak that to me and i was like all right lord this is your will i want to do it and i also want to just you know it's an honor and privilege to be behind here it's a sacred uh position and i just want to treat you with the utmost respect because you know when the lord you know when the lord calls you something he's entrusting you with this with the people because i'm responsible if i preach anything wrong i'm responsible and so uh i just want to just want to thank the lord for his opportunity to thank brother john for letting me be behind here and having the faith for me to be behind here and uh if we could rise we'll open up in matthew chapter five verse six and uh say amen when you're turning there probably very very familiar scripture to all of us blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled now this isn't just something just something that is said but this is a promise that jesus spoke to us so if you're truly hungering and thirsting after righteousness you will be filled it didn't say part way but if the thing is you have to really really hunger and thirst after righteousness and you will be filled i like to entitle this message what's your appetite and for a subject hunger may be seated so i look the word righteousness up it's applied to god the perfection or holiness of his nature exact risk and faithfulness so the thing is we can't be righteous on our own it's the righteousness of god inside of you that makes you righteous so it's nothing that you've done nothing that you you can work towards you know the righteousness the thing is righteousness is always of god and we're called to be holy like god and so i look the word up hunger it's an easy sensation occasion by the want of food a craving of food by the stomach craving appetite hunger is not merely want a food or a person or for the person when he's sick maybe staying long from eating without hunger or an appetite or food hunger therefore is the pain of or uneasiness of the stomach of a healthy person when too long destitute of food question i want to pose to you guys is have you been hungering on the things of god like you need to be has those things have crept in that have caused your hunger to go away because the thing is if we're not hungry for god then we're hungry for the devil in the world and when that creeps in that's when problems start to happen that's when you start to get uh uneasy unrestless the fruits of the holy spirit they don't they're not manifesting their life like they need to be so if we can realize that we need to be hungry daily hourly minutely on the things of god you see god's looking for a believer who is fully sold out to him he can turn the word upside down with one person fully surrendered to him so my question is what are you hungry for what things are you hungry for this very moment is the hungering for the pleasures of this life choking your walk with the lord or is the hungering for a closer walk of jesus christ kicking the pleasures of life about of this life out they say you are what you eat so if you're feeding on the things of god then you're gonna be start becoming the morning image of jesus christ but if you're feeding on the things of the world if you're feeding too much on politics on whatever it is you fill in the blank tv shows then you're gonna become what those tv shows those politics because i mean politics i'm not saying don't be informed but don't let the politics engulf your life that's right because the thing is i want to be engulfed by jesus i want when people see me they don't recognize me but to see jesus in me so i worry a little quote uh that i think really fits along with just this message here not long ago i was in the west heard of an indian got converted said how you feeling chief after a few days he said well pretty good and pretty bad said what do you mean pretty good said uh well since i got saved said there's two dogs in me said one's black and one's white and they just fight all the time said the black dog wants me to do bad and the good dog wants me to do good or the white dog wants me to do good said which one wins chief said huh depends on which one she feeds the most that's it the thing that's in your heart now telling you that is that is god's truth that's the baptism of the holy ghost is the way and god's preparation today is the holy spirit the blood washed church regenerated filled with the holy ghost signs and wonders of vindicating and proving that he's with it that thing that's telling you that feed that a few minutes you'll be number one of them that's right amen so i really i just really love that it's so simple simple the things you eat you're gonna become so the food saying with food if you eat bad food you're going to become that bad food you're going to feel bad all the time if you're feeding vegetables you know baked chicken grilled chicken those things you're going to you're going to feel a lot better and you'll be more sharpness in your mind we don't think of that a lot of times that our body is a temple spiritually and physically so the things you're feeding on so if you like i said before we feed not only on fast food then your body is going to be as sharp as it needs to be just like with sleep as well if you're not sleeping properly then it's going to be hard for you to enter in because your body you're human and you need rest i'm not saying there's not times where you know sometimes you know things happen in your life where you can't get rest but i think sometimes we make such bad habits just like our walk with god we don't spend more time with them and it turns into a bad habit and that's how all these problems happen in our life and the thing is don't wait to get desperate when you go on the when you're in the valley and the hard times but be desperate on the mountaintop because you're desperate on the mountaintop you won't have to you don't have to you know what things won't surprise you as much so um let's turn uh jeremiah 29 probably very affirmative scripture to all of us amen praise the lord and we'll start with verse 11 for i know the thoughts that i think toward you sayeth the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart it doesn't say part of your heart 50 in your heart 25 it says all of your heart says that for a reason because the lord he wants first place he doesn't want second place he doesn't want uh he wants first place as simple as that and if if we can get more like i said before if we can get on our knees and not leave until we meet with god that's when the change is going to happen don't just assume oh i think i met with the lord but no say lord i'm not leaving my knees until i know that i met with you that's the type of hunger and the thirsting we need in our walks this day and age is getting darker and darker by the minute and the thing is he's knocking on the heart of your door constantly daily let him in he wants to communion with you wants to sup with you don't be like the other other believers of the churches they're having jesus without you know without he's not even in the church and they think he's in the church same thing in your houses don't just assume he's there know he's there invite him he wants he wants to be invited in uh let's go to deuteronomy six uh we actually read that on sunday actually get there myself you don't realize how far back it is sometimes so deuteronomy 6 verse 4 we'll start right there so it says hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might you that's a reoccurring theme right there because you know god just really wants to be he wants to be he wants wants to be the soul in your life he wants to take care of you spiritually and physically he wants us to make himself known to you but the thing is you have to make that choice you have to you have to say lord i want to know you more than life itself that's the kind of desperation you need if you want to get to know and i'll go to verse six and these words which i command me this day shall be in my heart see the thing is we we hear a sermon and the thing is sometimes we get so caught up in oh i heard this word before or you know fill in the blank and the thing is every service every wednesday every sunday every special service that's a time for you to hear from god and to apply that to your life thing is this this word isn't just to be read like some encyclopedia or some history book this word is to be lived yet the spirit of this word has to be living inside of you that's how others are going to be won over to christ not by you trying to make a marked convert or whatever it is and it's so easy you know to you know connect with somebody in the flesh but the thing is care about their spiritual well-being because you can have a good conversation all day and all night but that's not going to do anything they're going to forget about that conversation but we're not going to forget about is the impact of you leading them to christ that impact would never be forgotten especially that souls won over they'll never forget that never forget you because you'll be connected to that person let's go to mark 12 29. amen 12 29 and it says and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hero israel the lord our god is one lord now shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind and with all thy strength if you notice it's i love how he's like you know putting all these things you know because his mind body soul and your spirit all these things you got to love the lord and because many people say i love the lord up here but they lack the love relationship because even the devils believe there's one guy they believe that jesus christ is the son of god they believe all these things but there's no life in that and the thing is he he just shouldn't be your savior but he should be your lord and savior if you give him lordship and ownership shows that you really love him and he can trust you but until we get to that point it can't just be some head knowledge you can't just be like i said reading this word and some head knowledge can't be praying just repetitiously because there's no there's no sacrifice in that as we heard we heard in the men's meeting the lord is looking for an obedient vessel that's willing to sacrifice and get on his knees and suffer get dirty disciple in somebody that's how you truly show the lord's movement in your life not to say i'm a christian for 20 years 15 years 5 years action speaks louder than words your life's going to prove if you really have the goods and do you realize each new day you have a chance to reach new heights with jesus you can develop a closer even more personal walk with him daily be hungry for a deeper walk with god because you're still on this earth for a reason there's still work for you to do you remember when when jesus was on that cross he he literally done everything that he was supposed to do if you were to die tomorrow or an hour could you say lord i've done everything you asked me to do because there's still so much for us to do time is running short there's still souls out there otherwise we'll be gone god's still trying to show you things in your life that you need to work out things you need to add to your life be hungry and say lord show me those things that i'm missing or that i forgot and um i said i'm not talking about a head knowledge walk because you know anybody can say i have a walk with god you know oh yeah you know god said this to me and uh three years ago the thing is i'm not saying don't forget about those past things he's done but don't just focus on those things press towards new testimonies i remember a brother told me at the men's meeting i experienced the brothers he said you should uh have a testimony of god moving every day in your life not just him just waking you up in the morning or giving you this but how is god moving your life right now today what is he doing are you expressing that testimony to others other lost souls and um let's go to romans 5 8. i'm sorry eight five forgive me so verse 5 for they that are after the flesh do the mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is what death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god so your head walk is enmity against god it says for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can it be so your flesh your flesh walk cannot be you can't get anywhere with it it's vanity at best even a man at best is vanity the scripture tells us so we can realize that that when we come to church we come to worship you understand we have problems all these things but god is over all those problems he deserves your best worship because you think about this you come with a bad attitude it's going to affect the whole service for somebody you can even grieve the presence of god you're not wanting to worship you can grieve the presence of god the thing is he's worth it he literally died upon a cross he even knew what it would took he knew the pain and suffering he had took and he still did it with love right so why can't we come into church and worship i see it sometimes we are just you know just going through the motions it's not about motions it's a love relationship let's get in love with god let's get more in love with god i should say amen uh verse verse eight so then they they're in the flesh cannot please god you can't even please god i mean you can do all the sacrificing you want but if you're in the flesh it's not gonna do anything right obedience is better than sacrifice um so just remember that the flesh our flesh can be we gotta crucify that's what we gotta do simple as that crucify your flesh it's so simple we just make it so hard sometimes because we we just like living in the flesh we like doing worldly pleasure because it feels good sin may be beautiful but it's rotten to the core so let's go to psalm 62 verse 1. i love the book of psalms because david was a man of desperation sometimes he may have been up and down but he was honest about being up and down the thing is we got to be honest to god don't try to put some put on that you're some big strong person that nothing affects you we all cry we all have trials we have tribulations we all make mistakes we all disbelieve sometimes be honest like that man said help my own belief i believe you but help my own belief god will be more pleased with that honesty than you trying to put a put on of having faith and not have you know having that faith but not really having it so verse 62 verse 1 says truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved amen verse five he repeats it again my soul wait thou only upon god from expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense and i shall not be moved so we're going through a trial let's be like a tree that's planted by the water let no winds no enemies spears move you let's just be remember branham said you know trials and tribulations are to kind of shake you but to what to deepen your roots get deeper rooted in god um verse 7 and god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god your your safe place is in god your secret pavilion is in god whatever he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of infirmities he was a man just like you and i he he cried he felt pain he needed sleep so think about the very god of heaven knows exactly what you're going through and what you're feeling it so don't think god is somewhere out there he's right in here it says trust in him at all times doesn't say trust in him sometimes or part of the time but says at all times no matter the situation don't give me excuses just trust in him ye people says pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us selah so think about that he says pour your heart out to him hunger forum say lord i need more of you i can't i can't face this trial without more of you i can't wait to witness witness to this person without more of you i need you to be front and center i just want to just be a vessel used for your kingdom verse nine surely men of low degree are vanity and men of high degree are a lie to be laid in balance they are all together lighter than vanity it says trust not no oppression and become not vain in riches or sorry become not vain in robbery if riches increase set not your heart upon them i look at the word of oppression it's the state of being oppressed over burden and misery i think sometimes when we go through hardships in our lives we get overburdened and worried because the thing is we're trying to worry about things that aren't our control worry about the things that you can control i can control whether i'm going to believe god or not i can't control what a b and c person's gonna do to me i can't the thing is we get as humans we're so used to trying to be in control of everything try to orchestrate everything we're not god we're not that's right if god's put you in this trial for a reason let's say lord what are you trying to show me what do i need to work on how what kind of character building do you want me to be shaped and molded in me because all the times we ask god why why why why why say lord i'm in this trial i want a girl i want a girl um verse 11. god has spoken once twice have i heard this that power belonged to god amen also unto thee oh lord belongeth what mercy for thou rendez to every man according to his work we're gonna jump down to verse 63 or sorry uh yeah chapter 63. i said i i always it's one of my i think one of my favorite psalms because i i love this verse one right here oh god thou are my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsted for thee my flesh longed for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is let's talk about the desperation and hungering that david had right there just imagine you're in a desert you haven't had water for days you're really thirsty so why can't we be that thirsty for god why can't we be that hungry for god because i think sometimes we make ourselves so busy that god is just kind of just penciled in somewhere and that's not right that's not fair to god he doesn't want to be penciled in you make that time because the thing i think as human beings we make time we make things for other things like whatever it is tv or uh whatever it is you fill in the blank i don't know you guys know what you guys do and the thing is i believe if we would just say lord i don't care how long it takes to get your presence i'm getting in your presence the thing is you gotta humble yourself you have to humble yourself even the scripture tells us to do that even said a humble and contrite spirit and no wise will i despise so he says to see thy power and thy glory let me reverse one again i love it oh god thou are my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsted for thee my flesh longer for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen me in the sanctuary says because thy love kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee verse 4 thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with meryl and fatness my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when i remember thee upon my bed and meditated meditate on me in the night watches because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings where i rejoice so no matter what things are thrown your way never not be thankful for what god is doing for you i think a lot of times we get so discouraged because we're looking for things that we don't have but we're not looking right now what god has been doing in our life right now god has been so good to us i mean beautiful church your health all these things he's giving you a lot of some people don't even have good health some people are in a hospital bed on ventilators struggling for life just gasping for air use what god is giving you use that health that he's giving you you're you have two arms two feet you have all these things god's given you use it for the kingdom of god dedicate your whole body to the kingdom of god um let's go to psalms i'm sorry psalms 27. i look the word thirst up say want an eager desire after anything and i look love kindness up as well loving kindness it says tender regard mercy and favor that's what god has to you tender regard he has mercy and favor and just think the very god of heaven loved you so much that he wanted to die for you and live inside of you that's love right there this just realizing what it cost every sin that you've committed every sin that the world committed from the beginning and he literally took every sin that adam committed every sin that i'll commit from the day i was born to the day i would die everybody in the world he did that just imagine the pain and agony he did it for you amen did it for me um sorry psalms 27 verse 4 says one thing have i desired of the lord that i will seek after notice that seek part you have to seek him that's the key right there he's not going to force himself upon you he's waiting for the believer to truly seek him after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple verse 7 hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer when thou said is seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord i will seek how many times have you been in prayer and you didn't feel like going on your knees and surrendered to god pretty sure we all felt that quite a few times that's the time pray hardest when it's hard to pray that's the time that's really when the blessing's going to come that pres his presence is going to come more if he's going to come because it's easy to when everything's lined up and you got the time to do it it's easy to do it then but we don't have that time that's when it's really hard to pray you say oh lord you know i'll pray for five minutes maybe seven minutes the thing is when everything's just you know just falling apart just getting your knees say lord i don't care what's going on i don't care what obligations i have right now yeah i want to spend some time with you that's really going to touch the heart that's what touches the heart of god that's when the test really the testing time happens because like i said once again it's easy to when everything's going good you're in a mountain top but we're in that valley how are you reacting to things how are you how's your prayer life is your prayer life subpar or is it you know is it growing constantly um i'm freaking forgive me uh verse seven i've read that already let's go to verse 14. it says wait in the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart wait i say on the lord that's another promise in this word right here wait on the lord it says be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart and when you're being a good courage you're not worrying about the outcome you're not worrying about situations you're just saying you just lord you promise this he likes to be reminded of his work he loves to be reminded of his word it's claiming in faith so to seek the word seek means to go and search or a quest to look for to search by from going from place to place so just like you know i'm pretty sure you guys watch movies you know they're looking for the king arthur sword whatever it is you know they were they really wanted to find it they were like i'm finding this thing no matter what it takes how much resource it takes how much money it takes so let's be like that with god god i'm willing i want to find you where where are you at where am i missing you if there's anything i've done to grieve you i mean what lord what have i done let's go to psalms 25 that's a couple over and we'll start with verse number four shoot me that way shoot me thy ways o lord teach me thy past lead me in thy truth if he knows that that prayer right there it's nothing about my wants my needs i i need a i need a car you know whatever it is he's just saying lord lead me in that truth teach me i'm not saying we can't pray for those things but he said but seek ye first the kingdom of god and there's righteousness and all these things should be added unto you so he knows what you need he knows he needs a house he knows he needs a car he knows you need money he knows all these things but this is the type of prayer really touches god like when solomon when he was praying he didn't ask for all these uh these you know physical things like you know money and prosperity and all these things he just wanted wisdom to help god's people and that's part of discipleship right there ask god for wisdom lord i don't know how to reach this brother just give me the wisdom how can i connect with him to lead him closer to you because iron sharpens iron right says leave me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the god of my salvation and on thee do i wait all the day remember oh lord thy tender mercies and thy loving kindness for they have been ever of old they kind of remind me just reminding god of his his scripture of his his holy precious ways david's just reminding god and i think god loves god's pleas when you do that it says remember not the sins of my youth nor my transgressions according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness sake o lord good and upright is the lord amen therefore will he teach sinners in the way the meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teaches way that's right all the paths of the lord are mercy and truth unto such as what keep his covenant in his testimonies if you notice that like uh i won't say a clause but it's all the pastor lord our mercy and truth and it says unto such as keep his covenant his testimonies a lot of people want the blessings of god without paying the price and the thing is god isn't some doty grandfather he's a god who he expects the more he is giving you the more truth he's giving he expects more out of you so don't just be you know just be satisfied with just giving god your bare minimum he expects so much more his standards are up here i think our standards we like to we like subpar he says my ways are not your ways and my thoughts are not your thoughts so if we can get more and holding our standards up here that's when we can grow cause it's so easy to put your standards down here that's easy you know i'm gonna do a bare minimum and just call it a day yeah it's easy but when you go the extra mile that's when it gets harder um verse 10 yeah i'll reverse it one more time all the paths of the lord are mercy and truth so no matter what trial you're going through there's mercy and truth in that trial don't ever forget that unto such as keep his covenant in his testimonies and uh go to ver uh little psalms five amen amen and we'll read one in one verse in here and it says my voice shalt thou hear in the morning o lord in the morning while i direct my prayer unto thee and i will look up something i i love doing is praying in the morning because you're really you're really putting god first because the first thing you get up in the morning your flesh does not want to serve god it never wants to serve god and if it does it wants to serve god the bare minimum way the thing is first thing you should do just get up get in your knees just enter into god and then your day is gonna it's gonna help your day start right then and there because it's so easy to get caught up i gotta do this and that net net be still and know that he's god and i'm going to flip one page back and go to psalms 1. so it says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the sea of the scornful or you can even imagine you know you know blessed is a man that doesn't follow his own will imagine that because because that's ungodliness right there because the thing is your will is not always going to match god's will i'll tell you that probably nine times out of ten it's not i give you maybe one percent so maybe one percent you might but other times it's going to be i want to do this i want to do this i want to do that and we never ask god what can i do for you today how can i help your kingdom increase and grow that's the type of hungering god is looking for that's what he's looking for in a believer especially in this day and age because if you look we go we're going to revelations chapter 3 in a little bit but the believer or the the believer in this day is tempted with so many things you got these on my cell phone we got all these cell phones with anything you could imagine on there internet google anything imagine on there you can do it's a computer literally in your pocket it's a tv in your pocket and they're a blessing and a cursing because i see kids in this day and asian generation they're all just so sucked up in social media and it's poison it's poi it's literally it's poison it's negativity and so i'm not saying social media isn't good because you can keep up with missionaries and family members but i think it's social media is just called such a division in this country and in this world it really has and if we let's uh verse two i'm sorry so it says but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night in what he should be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit see thing is as believers we need fruit we have to we need fruit daily god is trying god is cutting off the stuff that's dead and stuff that's live too he wants more fruit out of that he's looking for fruit in your life not just you saying stuff but fruit because people should people shouldn't know people shouldn't have to hear you say you're christian all the time for them to know that you're a christian they should just see your mannerisms your conversations the way you conduct yourself so that's the kind of life that when people saw jesus he had to say oh i got authority you know i'm the son of god i'm the most high he didn't have to say that the way he the way he lived his life showed the authority that he had and god has given each one of us authority and you shouldn't have to husbands you know we we shouldn't you know his husband we don't have to tell our wife i'm not speaking for myself but you shouldn't tell your wife you know i'm the head of this house i have the authority no you know what you shouldn't always have to remind your wife that you have authority because jesus never had to remind his disciples oh i have authority you know this no you know i'm you know i'm head over you he didn't they just saw the things that he did that just made them just see that this is the son of god this is the messiah who was promised so people say oh this is this is john martin oh man i he's i stepped on his toes i spit in his face and he's gonna rile back at me and they're gonna see christ in you like that because in order to see christ you have to be tested your long stuff your long suffering has to be put to test uh you know happiness you know your joy in situations you put the test all these things can be put to test to see if you got the goods and uh remember jesus he had a hungering to please the father and we should have a hungering to please him because he says in the scriptures he's our example we should follow after his footsteps he's paved the way all we have to do is just walk in those footsteps just walk in those footsteps and i'm not saying there's not you know he likes he likes it one step at a time one step at a time the thing is just trust him he knows what he's doing and it says if we have a hungering and thirsting just like david did in psalm 63 there is no reason or excuse for us to not be on fire for the lord there's no excuse we should be all the word all the word that's been preached here we should not have any excuse to be slaughterful or lazy if you want that hunger to stay you must be desperate desperation is so key with your walk with god if you're not desperate that's when the enemy creeps in and you become lukewarm you know david was a man of desperation pattern your life like david i'm not saying we're david but we can be like david because what he was he was like christ i mean he had that desperation to please god he says putting the lord first and everything you do will cause a great hunger daily because you put the things of god before you then you're constantly going to be hungry for him you're going to be his lord their souls i know you placed me in my job for a reason your word has to get across to these people they don't get to know you they're going to die if they don't accept you i rather i really somebody hate me for telling them the truth then for them hate me in the day of judgment for not telling them the truth because the thing is they're responsible if i give them the truth you know with the right motive the right heart and the love and they reject it that's on them i can't force anybody to be a christian i can't give anybody revelation that's not for me to do but it's for me to die trying the least the hunger we can get the more the lord can use us for his kingdom remember jesus always hungered to do the father's will and we are called to follow what that perfect example he left for us yes it's a quote from desperations right here our our dear lord jesus and himself in the world's greatest battleground gets timothy he cried out in despair should he take the sins of the world or should he remain on earth with his beloved disciples what he wanted to do but watch his humility as he humbled himself not my will but thine will be done humbled himself to the word the promised word of god of heaven notice then he went a little further and if he went a little further how much more we ought to go a little further amen see and notice the scripture says here in luke that he prayed what earnestly brother sister if jesus had to pray earnestly how much more have we got to pray earnestly if christ the god of heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly then how much more are we centered saved by grace prayed earnestly and if the decision throw the son of god in despair what will it do to you and i desperately we must cry i suggest we should we should listen to that message sometime desperations it'll really just show you what desperation really is be throwing desperation don't wait until hard times come into your life to be hungry don't wait thing is like i said before on the mountaintop we need to be hungry and desperate because we get to the valley we want to be thrown off surprise could god sometimes we get so comfortable with the blessing god's given us and we kind of look away from him a little bit he has to remind us where your blessings come from where your mercy comes and where your grace comes from amen the problem is we've gotten too lazy and lacks times and good times we get so lazy and there's missionaries out there just this struggling out there is to get the kingdom of god pre just get the kingdom just increase sometimes no shoes not enough food to eat walking uh you know it's just as many many variables they have and they don't use excuses but i think in america we just got so lazy we've got fast food we've got all these things at our fingertips that made us lazy and when you get away from those things that are making us lazy we need to we need to take inventory check inventory in your life pray when it's hardest to pray the enemy is trying to get you to be spiritually malnourished get more into hunger and malnourished means supply with less than minimum or imbalanced amount of the nutrients or food essentials for sound health and growth thing is i think sometimes we get spiritually amount of nervous because we're not feeding enough we're not reading we're just reading the reading the word just to check it off i read a i read a chapter today i read two chapters today uh i prayed you know for 30 minutes today and the thing is i'd rather have you pray for just five minutes in the presence of god than you to pray for two hours in your flesh because that's not going to profit you anything the only thing it's going to do is it's going to boost your ego up that's all it's going to do it's going to give you more pride in your life and the thing is why are we satisfied with being spiritually malnourished it's not going to get the job done it's not he's coming for a bride without a spot or wrinkle he's gonna be just like him not not not spiritually malnourished it doesn't say nothing about that so think about this we're in a natural we have not eaten a long time we get weak right and so what makes us think if we're hungry in the spirit we don't need to feed the thing is we're not feeding spiritually we get weak that's when the bars come down i think uh when the bars that's when the goats come in let the bar is down and when you're and you're just if you're doing the bare minimum you're just making it oh man i just made the church who we that's not going to help i i understand you know we all have we're all busy we all have lives we you know we have some people have kids understand that 100 percent the thing is the more you can just make that sacrifice lord i know it's been a rough week but i'm here for you and you alone he's going to bless that if you're not feeding the spirit man then where you're feeding you're feeding your carnal flesh it's no it's no in the middle it can never be in the middle it's either you're serving god or he's hurting the devil it's one or the other either you're hot or cold don't try to be lukewarm um so the key is we need to create a habit thing is we created so many bad habits in our lives let's create good habits let's kick those bad habits out let's create a habit of lord i'm not leaving my prayer closet until i meet with you lord i'm not reading i'm not leaving reading this word until i see you in every line every phrase till you make this word just come to life for me let's go to matthew 10 38. so let's make that habit let's make a decoration tonight i'm feeding my spirit man daily i don't care well how my day has been i don't care what the enemy's throwing at me i'm feeding the spirit man matthew 10 uh 38 i'm going the wrong way so it says and matt this is probably very familiar as well if i can find it and he that taketh not his cross and fall after me is not worthy of me so if you're not denying yourself daily if you're not denying yourself of your will daily you're not even worthy to follow him you're not you're not even worthy to bear his name because you're trying to you're trying to serve god while doing your will it doesn't work that way it can't work that way it's impossible god doesn't operate like that way it's not his in that economy it's impossible so the thing is in order for in order to take your cross up you gotta deny yourself that's that's what jesus said you have to do it it's not of i can do it sometimes it's a must if you want to truly serve god and the magnitude he wants you to serve him in you have to die daily you have to you have to kill that old man because old man wants to rile up he wants to show out so matthew 26 41 and prayer is that's the key right there prayer is so important it's your lifeline between you and god it's think about it it's a direct connection to the throne room your prayer is greater than any atomic bomb that you can think of any any sniper rifle any machine gun any grenade that's greater than any of that prayer changes things makes situations get light on what you get confusion turns to peace that's when god speaks to you 20 sorry 26 41 right so 20 says watch and pray they enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak so you gotta realize your flesh is weak is you gotta realize that nature you're born was a fallen nature so it's gonna always gravitate towards the things of satan and your your biggest enemy it isn't communism it isn't politics it isn't your brother sitting next to you it's yourself you get in the way of god moving your life yourself you do you're your biggest enemy think about it it's not your brother who's stopping you for praying on your knees it's yourself because you don't want to crucify your flesh you're going to take the easy way out don't make excuses just say i'm done i'm done making excuses take responsibility for things a lot of times we want to just not take responsibility or point fingers when we make a mistake be responsible for it and don't just be satisfied oh i made a mistake but learn from that mistake grow from that mistake god is trying to teach us and god's trying to teach you every day you have to be be more aware in your life be aware of what you're doing uh whatever whatever job you're doing be aware pay attention to detail it's gonna help you be more sharper pray for spiritual awareness lord help me to be more spiritually aware help me to recognize you on a daily basis uh this is uh this is right here from take the rod and gather the people says can we bow our heads heavenly father it's kind of hard for me to say goodbye to this lovely audience of people been so kind to me for three weeks constantly blessing me and giving me this portion of the gospel standing by me in the hours when we needed and prayed and called out on god we're so thankful for them and now sunday night as far as this meeting is concerned the ministers and all of them the last time in this meeting i've tried to do all you showed me and i pray god tonight you will send the angel who will down to our midst and he might move by the holy spirit up and down these aisles everywhere my faith may faith just be great and many many many people tonight be healed brought closer to god since this day for the great altar called those needy and poor and seeking you said seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open ask and it shall be given everyone that knock it that's open and everyone that's seeking life create all of us right here create such a hunger and thirst in their hearts no one will have rest until he has found christ speak to their hearts while the spirit is drawing tell us now tonight in our hearts that's what we need to be having right now don't find rest until you know he's spoken to you tonight let god to speak to you tonight it's not me i'm nothing i'm just i'm nothing i'm a man who makes mistakes and problems and jesus here tonight in his power all of his power to heal every person that's in this building if you're looking for him you'll find him he's here he's here there's a fountain open tonight brother when a man hunger and thirst for god there's bound to be something in there to create that thirst there is if you're if you're hungry through the deep cloth until deep that's what the scripture says it says now when this meeting is closed you'll go out somewhere the thing is think about this when this message is done being preached you have either a to accept it and leave and follow it or b it just falls to the wayside you forget about it and then sunday comes so thing is when god's speaking to it's important god just doesn't speak to speak he speaks with a purpose a motive and if he's what he's trying to get to you i don't know he's trying to get to you i don't i'm just following what he's telling me to do it's up to you it's up to you guys to find out what he's speaking to you and to live that he says well i'll tell you i got that figured out see well that was my ring there's this and that or the other and the devil will rob you everything away from you that god has given you that's what he's trying to do tonight he's trying to rob everything that god everything that god's trying to give you things trying to rob it away don't let him take away from you you kick them out you chop them away um what do you do when what you do when you get in your heart you just keep on moving and saying give me more give me more he says and blessed are they that hunger and thirst righteousness see if you even hunger for it you're blessed just to hunger for think about that you're blessed just a hunger for it you're blessed in this day and age to even have a hungry and thirsting to be here in these seats don't waste an opportunity to be here in these seats to say lord please i want to know exactly what you're trying to tell me to do i want to know how i can take this into my work take this into my home take this into my car everywhere i live that's from making a valley full of ditches and looky here i've seen a piece in the paper some year ago two years ago where a little baby had eaten erasers off of pencils he pedals off a bicycle they said what's the matter with that child the doctor examined and taken analysis of his blood and come to find out he needed sulfur there's sulfur and rubber c a deep calling to the deep see what i mean they got it there's a call there's a calling for sulfur calling for sofa there's got to be a sulfur somewhere to respond to it or there's no call for suffering see what i mean oh i feel very religious he says listen just tell me something now there's a deep here not long ago when the church began to cool off and get formal the great westlake revival the people began to hunger for more god if you hunger for more of god what there's bound to be more of god to respond to somewhere if you only been justified by faith and know nothing but about the baptism the holy ghost and you hunger for it there's got to be a holy ghost somewhere to feel that hunger so if if anybody wants one of the holy ghost there's plenty there's plenty he's like a fish in the ocean he doesn't you know say oh i gotta drink sparingly he keeps drinking it god you can't exhaust god he even disciples got refilled and he gave him boldness even more boldness to speak the word uh that's right and if you believe today there's a god who heals there's got to be a fountain open somewhere for healing or that desire wouldn't be there let's go to proverbs 19. how i'm on time so proverbs 19 15 says slothfulness cast it into a deep sleep so think about we get lazy and slothful that's when your guard gets down that's when the devil enters in it's when the enemy pillages takes your joy your salvation away doesn't take your salvation away but david said restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and take not that holy spirit from me so thoughtfulness casts into a deep sleep and an idol soul shall suffer hunger he that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul but he that despised his way shall die jesus gave us many commandments are you following them are you following him today i'm not saying in the past are you following his commandments today because he's telling me right here he that keeps his commandment keeps his own soul if you choose not to keep his commandment you're disobeying them it's like a slap in the face almost so now to keep hungry and thirsting for god you must feed your spirit man with the things of god you need to be seeking him in the spirit and reading his word and turn the second corinthians with me verse three i'll try to hurry second corinthians three verse six who has made us able ministers the new testament not of the letter but the spirit for the letter kilth but the spirit giveth life that's what's going to make a change in your life the way you read this word is going to change if you're saying lord i need you i need your spirit to bring this word to life lord i need this this word this to be so real to me i don't want to read it like it's some history book i don't want to just read it just to read it like it's a good book this is the blueprint of my life this is the way i need to live my life this this is i want to set a standard in my home my work i don't care what the majority says i don't care the majority leaves leave stop serving god i'm serving god no matter what so this is a spiritual walk with christ how are we going to grow if you don't eat the proper spiritual diet the natural types of the natural types of spiritual for example if you don't eat the right things your body needs eventually going to get malnourished yes so if your spiritual diet is poor then you're eventually going to be become spiritually malnourished and how can god use for his kingdom if you're not properly nourished with the right essential with the word you have a proper balance you gotta have a balance and the balance lies in god they'll be busy balanced and focused that's the key right there my time would be just be busy you know in your daily life working be busy with the things of god uh god is looking for believers who are hungry for more of him and the way you live your life on a daily basis will prove if you're hungry for god the things you're saying on a daily basis the people you're hanging on a daily basis the conversations you're having on a daily basis is going to really prove how hungry you are for god it's really gonna prove it now to keep hungry you must be desperate let's go to samuel uh first samuel chapter one probably very familiar amen yeah let me know you guys are there i think i'm there say amen we're there please so verse 10 says and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the lord and wept sore and she vowed to vow and said o lord of hosts if thou indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid and remember me and not forget thy handmaid but will give unto thy hand made a man child then i will give him unto you unto the lord all the days of his life see the lord is looking for the motive of why you're desperate for what you need and hannah she got serious she said i'm giving this child back to you the thing is when you get extra time in your life say lord i'm getting this time back to you i'm giving everything you're giving i'm giving it back to you dedicate your car to him your house to him your vessel to him rededicate yourself to him amen it says uh all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head and it came to pass and she continued praying before the lord that eli marked her mouth now hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore eli thought she had been drunken and eli said unto her how long without be drunken put away thy whine from me and hannah answered and said no my lord i am a woman of a sorrowful spirit i have drinking neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the lord are you pouring your soul before the lord it's my question to you when's the last time you've done it it's my other question to you count not thy hand made for a daughter of belial for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief if i spoken hitherto then eli answered and said go in peace and the god of israel grant thee that petition that was asked and she said let thy hand find grace in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad so look hannah was desperate she was desperate for a son she wanted a son really bad and when she got serious she was willing to dedicate him to the lord so where do you want to dedicate to the lord how many things in your life have you not been dedicated to the lord there's a question the lord is looking for a believer who's willing to sell out lock stock and barrel and remember desperation is a state of despair typically one which results in rash or extreme behavior remember god's looking at your motive while you're desperate we can be desperate for the wrong things remember that we can be desperate for many wrong things in our lives check the inventory and say lord are these things pleasing to the things that i'm desiring because he can give you something that he can give you something that's out of his out of his will but i don't want anything out of his his will i want his perfect his perfect will now if you notice uh it does not say in john 16 13 don't have the title turn there okay actually put in the please put it i'll read off the board if you're online john 16 13. how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he should not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come now notice it does not say he will force you in all truth says he will guide you so that that meaning you have to choose to follow his leadership when the lord's speaking to you you have a choice to follow it or reject it you can't be in between amen because that's iniquity if you try to go in between amen if you choose not to follow god god does not have halfway believers he doesn't and another another thing too when you're hungry and your mind is such an important thing because you remember the word goes in your mind first and then either take it by faith or you reject it by unbelief so the thing is when you're hungry for the things of god your mind such it's a battle up there daily satan's trying to speak to him god's trying to speak to you you got to get still and try that spirit says in john 4 uh first john 4 1 try the spirit and see to be of me so thing is don't dislike any kind of thought going to your mind when you just do that become lazy take the time don't let your mind be the devil's playground that's right it's so easy just to let thoughts just go willy-nilly but that's when you get off track see the more we renew our mind the more we can stay focused on god that the mind of christ is promised to you but you have to seek after it you gotta desire it you have to get hungry and thirsty after that mind of god don't just expect to magically obtain it it takes a lot of dying out to get that if you want the mind of god it takes a lot of sacrifice a lot of blood sweat tears takes all those things it takes for you to willing to say lord i need this mind i can't function without the mind of christ if we go to revelations 3 almost we're going to close in next five 10 minutes might have five or ten more minutes all right let's be preaching a three hour sermon then i'm just kidding all right so uh it's probably very familiar versus uh verse 20 in chapter three it says behold i stand and knock if any man will hear my voice open the door and i will come to him and what's up with him and he with me to him that overcometh while i grant to sit with me in my throne i want to ask you a question how many giants are in your land that you're letting roman whatever they are addiction unbelief you name it fear there's so many giants in our land that we just let this roam around god's god's you're overcomer in this age you can overcome any giant that's in your land thing is you have to want to do it though god isn't going to force it he wants you to you gotta make that first step first to show them what if you're addicted with something the same thing i know when i had addiction in my life i i said god i can't do this anymore i cannot do this anymore i need this out of my life and i got serious with god no it didn't happen this very second i got delivered remember one day it was like maybe like six months seven months later i just felt free that desire was gone i was like well i just felt free that the chains of bondage were just gone so god honors when you're serious the thing is you gotta get serious don't don't just expect god to say hocus pocus and it's gone it doesn't work that way i'm not saying he can't deliver you instantly at times he can i believe he can but it's we we expect god just to move in our in our timing and our timing isn't always god's time remember that so another thing we must be hungry for is to conquer those giants in our land be hungry to conquer those giants don't let the don't let the giants of addiction of fear of manipulation unbelief roaming your life how do you expect to have the mind of christ if your mind is the devil's playground take back control of your mind just because it's the greatest bad ever fought doesn't mean you have to lose with every battle you know god has called you to be a victor overcomer it's like brother aaron preach invert don't just look at the you know these things that devil's tempting with is just oh wow what was me look at the chance that you can kick that devil out you can kick that devil out your life get get so on fire with god the devil doesn't know what to do with you so in john 10 10 we'll go there john 10 10. and then after that we'll go to uh first samuel and we'll try to close and time just flies doesn't it it says the thief cometh not but for distill and to kill and to destroy i came that they might have life and then that might have it more abundantly so the thing is he's come they have more life more abundantly don't live below what god's calling you to do brother branham said we live so below our privilege is what god is calling us to be don't just be satisfied with just just serving god to bare minimum don't just be satisfied once again those giants taking control of you don't say i'm a grasshopper in their sight no you gotta you gotta take control you gotta stand up stand up to those giants what david did we're gonna we're gonna read actually and reading samuel right now i i love i love right here with this uh encounter with him and goliath i really love it because you look at the enemy the enemy when he gets upper hand or gets cocky he likes to like he proposed he said uh if we you know if you defeat us we'll serve you you know or vice versa you know he can see all these things and bluff he gets a bluff a lot so let's let's read that in the first time let me get there myself first samuel 17 and it says in verse 26 and david spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to that that to the man that kills this philistine and take away the approach of israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that should defy the armies of the living god verse 31 and when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsed them before saul and he sent for him and david said to saul let no man's heart fail because of him that servant will go and fight with the philistine and saul said to david thou are not able to go against his philistine to fight with him father but a youth and he a man wore from his youth and david said unto saul that servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and went after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine seeing he had to follow the army's living god don't let any uncircumcised philistine defile your land god didn't create you for that he created you to kill the enemy verse 37 david said moreover the lord had delivered me out of the paul the lion and out of the paul of the bear and he would deliver me out of the hand of the philistine and saul said unto david go and the lord be with thee and saw armed david with his armor and he put his helmet on all the stuff he put on of the brass upon his head and he got armed with his coat of the mail and david gerd is so and david gird his sword upon his armor and say to go for he hath not proved it and david said in the saw i cannot go with these for i have not proved them and david put them off of him and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had even a script and his sling was in his hand engineered to the philistine the philistine came out and drew near to david and the man that bear hit the shield went before him and when the philistine looked about and saw david he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy of fair countenance and the philistine said unto david am i a dog that thou comest to me with staves and the philistine cursed him by his gods philistine said to david come to me and i will give you that flesh upon the files of the air and the beast of the field then david said to the philistine thou comes to me with a sword and with a spear and a shield i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou hast defile this day will the lord deliver thee into my hand and i will smite thee and take thy head from me and i will give the carcass to the host so when there's giants in your land you take that sword you just cut away that enemy just cut him away he has no business being in your life he is no busy you shouldn't be don't don't don't try to coexist with satan don't try to do that if you try to do that you're never ever going to be where god wants you to be he wants to be so much higher than what you can imagine once you read new heights you've never seen in your life the thing is you have to like you have to show god that you mean business thing is it's not you doing overcoming it's him and you're doing overcoming he's giving me that sword to chop away that enemy he's giving me that sword to kick the enemy out jesus never reasoned with the devil when he met him three times he never one time he said it is written that order if they get behind me he never had to reason on the devil when you reason the devil he has you right there that's what eve did she lusted after knowledge he started to think about it and right there he had her so don't when the devil comes you with something don't even give him the time of day you kick him out right then and there all he is uncircumcised philistine and you know we're gonna finish the story in all assembly uh shall i know the lord save not with sword and spear for the bow is the lord's and he will give he will give you into our hands it came to pass when the philistine arose and came and drew now to meet david that david hastened and ran toward the army to meet the philistines and david put his hand in his bag took us took against the stone and slang it and smote the philistine his forehead then the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell on his face in the earth so then david prevailed over the philistine so i want you to put yourself in that scripture so brother ron prevailed over the philistine for the john prevailer philistine brother jonathan all you guys sister ann sister trisha brother roger you can prevail over that philistine in your life with a sling with a stone and smoth the philistine slew him but there was no sword in his hand therefore they ran and stood upon the philistine and took his sword and drew it out of the sheath therefore and slew him and cut off his head therewith and with the in when the philistines saw their champion was dead they fled so when the devil knows you have the real stuff he's going to flee because he knows when god is in the picture he's weak he can do nothing just like when uh jesus was then put when jesus was in the presence of the legion he said you come to torment me this early so the thing is if god is moving your life like that they're going to be the same thing let's get so on fire for god that when when satan comes yeah you come to torment me this early let's get like that because we can get like that it's possible i believe we can reach heights there's things that we don't think we can get to high school we can so be like joshua and caleb when they went to the we went to to despite the land out they saw that god had promised they even brought back grapes but 10 out of the 12 said we're grasshoppers we can't do this we're better in egypt but joshua kisses a different spirit if god can be forced who can be against us if god's promised that land for you take it i don't care what's in there i don't care what giants are in there i don't care don't give me excuses just take that land he promised me with you and in you the god inside you can handle any problem any solution that's in your life that's right you don't have to wait for the pastor to help him you have to wait for your favorite preacher to come help you you want to wait for your favorite brother to come help you your personal walk can help you this is all you need is a personal walk of christ that's all you need so i guess the last thing i'll be we'll close dedicate your mind dedicate your heart dedicate your worship dedicate your whole being to god and i'll read this quote brother paul uh said this worship is more than just singing more than just music worship is a life that has a revelation the redemptive blessings of god and the atonement of god it shouldn't have to take music for you to worship i think a lot of times we just worship here we try we always worship here at church that's enough the thing is if we worship at home then that our worship in church would be so much more fruitful we need to worship it at home god that is a revelation of the redempted blessings of god in the atonement of god so the thing is i believe it comes from a life that's what dedicated close relationship it's a sanctified life that's what worship is and we can get in that state of worship when we come in we won't just be following the motions but really just when you're reading those words when we're singing get into the words don't just sing it because you sung it thousands of times get into the worship when it says i'm so needy say lord i'm needy of you i need you to come here tonight i need you to speak to brother stones i need you to speak to me most of all so i can help somebody that's what worship really is and we need as a church need to get more into worship let's not depend on the song leaders and not not depend on uh somebody else trying to create atmosphere but you be that creator of your atmosphere you create that atmosphere that's gonna bring god that's gonna welcome god because god wants to feel welcomed you gotta create the atmosphere of faith that's gonna welcome every single time we could rise uh maybe stand and we'll sing i am so needy i hope you guys uh definitely got something off that message let's not forget what we heard from the lord [Music] of tonight i am so needy lord to be more like you share all my rights away in this world of sin i [Music] as he's playing his song list about our hearts things tonight have just felt they've been challenged is to have a greater hungering in god raise your hand to the lord if you feel as you haven't been hungering like you need to be on a daily basis just let that not be known to god if you know there could be more done in your life to serve god to help his kingdom increase don't just say it but make it a decoration in your life make it a promise to god for say this day forth i'm going to dedicate my life to the kingdom of god because time is short brothers and sisters we can you can you know you can read your bible every day and pray and still miss it there's going to be many people who read their bible every day and prayed but went to hell the thing is it has to be real to you it has to be a life to you don't just make it to some passing time some hobby but make it a life now if this there's an altar in your heart you have to go to the altar but there's an altar right in your heart it's me with the lord lord jesus we come here today lord we just all just feel so challenged to just to live a higher life than you lord we realize that desperation is so key in this day and age lord the enemy is just trying to come like a flood gate but lord you raise the standard lord and i pray that each hand that was raised lord that they'll just have such a solemn dedication lord they'll just give them give their life back to you lord and lord we pray lord we don't tomorrow's not even promised lord but right now lord we can just say lord this message touched me i want to live it lord brother praying them so i need somebody to live me a sermon and preach me one that's right lord the greatest thing is it's easy to to just read at home and spend time with you sometimes but the thing is to really just take that home we want to take it to our works lord we want to just just have more time in the spirit that's the key it's so easy to pray in the flesh but really to get in that spirit is one that's going to make a difference lord lord we want to make a difference lord we want to help you lord we want to just lord as we come we don't
