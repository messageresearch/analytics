see Jesus [Music] open our eyes [Music] open our ears and help us to listen open our eyes Lord we want to see Jesus amen amen that's what we came for amen amen if you turn with me to Colossians chapter 1 amen praise the Lord got a little Showers of Blessings right so a little bit of rain is we need it starting with verse 12. giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things we he might have the preeminence amen Spar heads for word of Prayer dear Lord Jesus I pray father Lord none of us are worthy Lord to to even handle your word but we just pray that your holy spirit will come tonight and Lord Jesus that you'll open our eyes father you put I Salve on our eyes that we can see and Lord Jesus that you'll take away our filthy garments Lord and and give us gold tried in the fire and white Ramen heavenly father that's the promise for this hour I pray Lord that you have just come and that you walk amongst us father may we see you plainly in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen you may be seated so hopefully hopefully you forgive me if you hit that people don't think I'm on an intellectual side [Laughter] it's always a concern but um I want to continue with the masterpiece I want to thank Brother Joseph because Brother Joseph came to me about a month ago and and he wanted some fellowship and and he said oh he goes but Bruce he says I got this book The Masterpiece he says I'm gonna go home and study it and I said oh okay that'd be fine I I know the Masterpiece I've I've I've read it and and uh so when I was waiting for Brother Joseph to call me um I went and listened to the tape and I found out I didn't know anything about the masterpiece and so and I had still haven't shown or conveyed to you what ultimately I saw so I want to continue on tonight um with uh part three but I want to comment on two things here first verse 12 and verse uh in Colossians when uh verse 12 in the original I really I when I when I looked this up and I read it I went oh wow praise the Lord verse 12. it says giving thanks at the same time to that father who called and qualified US I like that he called and qualified US for the portion of the Saints inheritance in the light amen amen God called us he qualified us and our inheritance is in the light praise the Lord praise the Lord amen and I I was thinking mom was studying just a little while ago um in verse 16 you know it says for by him were all things created and that that are in heaven and that are in the earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and how dare the devil give him something that he already owned devil said oh I'll give you all this just Bow Down and Worship me I created it foreign that's what it said I created it praise the Lord amen so I have I've listened to the Masterpiece I think about 12 times and the other night when brother John called me then I've gone on the elliptical and I started listening again and I missed another I just went Lord wow so in the beginning of the Masterpiece brother Branham says so he says we realize that we're here in a negative form right so as long as there is a negative there has to be a positive and there cannot be a negative without a positive C because it's because of the positive that makes the negative now back in the age when brother Branham was alive we had 35 millimeter cameras and 110s and 125 cameras and that and and what you would do is so here all of you are here you are the reality you're the reality and I could get a camera and I could take a picture of you and the light impresses the reality onto the negative then I take the negative and I go and develop it when I develop the negative it's absolutely opposite of what the positive is if you ever look at a negative all the black is white and all the the white is black and when you take the negative then and you go and then you develop it on photo paper whether it's a black and white photograph or whether it's color then you get a positive off of that negative but when you get that positive you look at it and you say oh look I have this wonderful picture of all the church but that's not the reality that's just a copy it's just a a a a photo of the reality so brother Branham said so we see we realize that we are here in negative form we're just the negative and he says he says and as long as there is a negative and you're here there is a positive somewhere not a photograph of reality there is a positive somewhere because you can't have a negative without the positive somewhere praise the Lord praise the Lord you should be breaking up the tune if you really so see that's why we have sickness in this because well it's just the negative the negative is bound to all the things that we have in this world and and it's it's just the opposite but praise the Lord tonight I have a positive waiting for me in the heavens in this world I've just stepped down into this negative for just a little space of time praise the Lord amen he says there has to be an object somewhere or to strike for the light to strike the lens and you remember in Colossians 1 12 it said we have an inheritance in the light praise God amen amen so he says there has to be an object somewhere for the light to strike the lens or there would never be a negative but you're here you're here as a negative and you're wondering about whether you're going to make it or not you're wondering about whether you're a born-again son of God yet you're here in negative form praise the Lord amen it's for the light to strike the lens or there would not be any negative so when we see that our life here is in the negative and knowing that we are in the image of some life somewhere then we know that there is a positive somewhere that the light has struck and it's a reflected something here on Earth and we are only that reflection the genuine object is somewhere brother random says and if that isn't true I'm the worst deceived man in the world and I've spent my life in vain but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's there see and that's why we are here see amen amen that's enough we could say a prayer and go home amen so it's a little difficult to um to I there was so much it's just so much so we'll see how far we get tonight so in in part one we introduced you to Michelangelo we and brother Brandon talked about Michelangelo's Moses and how that that was his sculpture and then he also talked about God being the master sculpture and the things that we brought out that that we need to remember that we need to really think about is that before you can have an image before you can make a masterpiece you have to have a vision of what you're going to make and then you have to be true to that Vision you can't vary from that Vision you can't you can't wave from it you've got to stay right with the vision the way it was given and then the other thing is that it's very exact you can't you can't start the work and then say oh no no I made a mistake I need to move it over here or his arm's not going to be part of the rock anymore or or you know you've got to be it's a very exacting process amen and he said and then so the last thing that that we talked about in in part one we we talked about how God was creating a masterpiece and we find out that actually God has been creating many masterpieces um he has one main Masterpiece that he's got hid in his mind that's his vision that he's going to make so we found out then that Michelangelo when he when he was so inspired and he saw the vision that he had when he saw it become in reality it's so inspired him that he smote it and he said speak amen so so we we went from that we we talked about Adam and Eve and and we talked about how that um God actually when he saw them he was inspired and he told Adam to speak and Adam did Adam named all the animals Adam had power over the Earth Adam had power over the Sun the moon the stars the wind he had he had dominion over the fishes of the sea in the land and all those things and and then he fell amen so then we went on in in part two if you remember so we went to that and the the thing that we wanted to look at was that a thought is the same as an attribute and that thought has to come before the word can come anytime that anything is spoke there's always a thought behind that word but when that word comes that is not the end game that is not what God's trying to do that's not what what you do when you like me right now words are coming out of my mouth and I'm trying to convey something that God has shown me that will get in you and the manifestation or the end point of that word is when that word comes alive so when God said let there be light he first thought about light he thought about what light was going to be and then when he said let there be light then there had to become a manifestation of light and when the manifestation of Light Came then he could say that is good and I can go on to the next thought amen so we found out also we found out that in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and we see that that word God is Elohim and he is he's the self-existing one he's alone with his thoughts he doesn't there's nobody else with him there's no one before him there's no one after him there's no other gods he said there is no other gods I don't even know him but when he was Elohim he dwelt alone with his thoughts but when he started to con condescend down to becoming the word he became the logos and that's how we see that in Saint John 1 where he says in the beginning was the word which is the logos which is the essence of God and the essence of God is all of God but now he's in a visible form he's in a pillar of fire form and that logos then can then move upon the face of the waters that logos then can speak the world into existence that logos then can create the angels and stars and just like it says in Colossians it tells um all these things are created by Him and for him and he wasn't talking about God Elohim he's talking about the logos he's talking about the essence of God so he says so the foundation then there has to be brother Branham said he said then every Masterpiece every sculpture every Masterpiece has to have to be put on a foundation he says you just don't spend your life's journey creating something and then taking it and putting on the side parking lot or something he says you want to make a foundation for it and and the prophet said that that God had a a foundation that he made in in the Book of Genesis and he says and it was actually he said it had four foundations which when we drew it on the board you know we we drew it as a square but as I thought about it the other day I thought maybe brother Branham because I don't know what brother Brandon was thinking but maybe he was more thinking of it as a pyramid One Foundation being Abraham being Faith then he said another a foundation built on faith then was Isaac which was love and then on top of love then became out of Isaac came Grace came Jacob and then out of Jacob came the Patriarchs and Joseph and Joseph was the Perfection and each one of them reflecting part of God and manifesting that as they were coming up and then once once you have the foundation laid then you can go and and get your your monument and place it upon that amen so so we talked about that and then we then we talked about the diamond brother Ben said it looked like a kite I said well I said it's the best I could draw a diamond but we found out that a diamond because brother Branham talks about the diamond in the Masterpiece he talks about he says when he went down to the in in Africa and he went to the diamond mine he said he was looking on the ground and they were kicking around these rocks and he said what are these and and the man told him he says that's a diamond and brother random says but that doesn't reflect you know like like mine it doesn't reflect and he says well it can't reflect until it's cut and you can't cut a diamond with anything you have to cut it with a diamond and then he also pointed out he said so he says when he when we cut the diamonds we don't waste any of those pieces when we cut them off he says we have little pieces in that and he says and we make them in the victrola needles and most of us don't even know what a victrola is anymore but it was very outstanding because in the in the message brother Bradham says he says he says then he says when you buy a record when you go to the store and you buy a record he says it's unheard music it has a there's a music on there there's something on there and he says and you put it on the the uh the turntable and he says and then you take a diamond to to make the unheard music become visible amen you need to go home and just meditate on because now we have gone I as I was working out yes the other day and I was I was listening to that I was thinking I thought wow you know the world has changed so much because now what we do to create music is we use a light in the evening time there shall be light you can't just look at this word light has to hit that word or you'll never see the the Hidden Music you'll never hear it you the light has to strike the word and that's what he said he said we are we have an inheritance in light so we talked about that and we talked about also how that that God when he went and got his great big diamond it was very rough looking and but then he chipped off a little piece and that little piece then became a reflection of what the Masterpiece was going to be and that little piece then became the prophets and then as we were going on on that so so we we I think that's kind of where we finished up and you know unfortunately we're in we're in the the this negative realm of time you know I have to get up and go to work in the morning we have to do all a lot of things that I mean the first service that we had I was so excited I wanted to preach so two in the morning amen so in the Masterpiece brother Brandon says so we want to continue on here he says so so he says now the foundation is laid through faith love Grace and on to Perfection through the Patriarchs now the Bodywork that come on to that Great Masterpiece was the prophets so he starts to tell us that Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph they they showed us something but they showed us something that was different than what the prophets did because the prophets were part of the Masterpiece that was going on top of the foundation and the difference between what the prophets had and what the foundation had is they did not have the law they did not have the word of God revealed to them it was it was still a God it was still God's thought it was hit it was it was hit alone with him because God doesn't repeat himself God doesn't he he doesn't waste time he doesn't waste our time you know he he doesn't so he says the body work that came onto this Great Masterpiece was the prophets which was the word so he says I hope you can read it see the prophets not the law the prophets for the prophets was the Vindicated word which makes the body not the Patriarchs the prophets they were the word so you have to see that the word of God even though you can quote it if there's no life in it if it never comes to manifestation it's dead letter and all it'll do is kill you that's all it'll do but that's not what God intended the word for God intended the word to be made manifest amen and that's what he could do with the prophets so let's just take an example here I want to go to Exodus 3. so just to show you a little bit praise the Lord amen so remember that it's it's it's really interesting to think that brother Brandon didn't just fill up tapes his motive wasn't to see if he could preach for six hours there was something he was trying to convey there there was something my so so anyways so remember we had the picture and we said okay we have a thought it has to become the word and then it has to become flesh right it has to become manifest so here in verse 12 now God has given his commission to Moses and God has spoken to Moses and this is God's thought spoken to Moses certainly I will be with thee and this should be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou Hast brought forth the people out of Egypt ye shall serve God Upon This Mountain you can take that to the bank thank you God is going to fulfill that but it was just a dead letter when Moses heard it Moses heard it he knew he was in the presence of God but that word had to be made manifest and he didn't even know how God was going to do it right he didn't know what was going to happen because when he went back down into Egypt it didn't just kind of go smooth and that's all part of God's plan of a masterpiece so if you go over here to Exodus 20 now in Exodus 20 Verse 18 . so now God has fulfilled the promise that he gave to Moses but the children of Israel did not know that promise because it was not spoken to them it was only rehearsed in their ears but when when they got there verse 18 it says in all the people saw the thundering and the lightning and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off and they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we die and God heard what they said and the prophets came into existence prior to that God would speak to whomever he wanted he would just he would he'd see brother Ron one day at work and he would just speak to brother Ryan but when the children of Israel rejected that relationship God said okay I can do that speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we die and Moses protested see and Moses said unto the people fear not you know don't be afraid of God for God has come to prove you that his fear may be before your faces that you sin not because the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and if there is no if there's no judgment if there's no penalty then there is no fear right if we don't have the police we have lawlessness if we don't have God if we don't know that God will keep his word then then we're not worried about it but Hebrews tells us he says it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of God amen amen so we find out so brother Brian I'm in the Masterpiece he says so see he says the law only did one thing the law showed us how Fallen we are the law shows us that we can't keep we can't even imagine of how to keep the word we can't do that but in the prophets because the prophets were a manifested chip off the great diamond they and and remember when we looked we said wait a minute it when Adam when Eve came out of Adam's side then every every cell in her every bone had the DNA of Adam and every piece that was broken off of The Great Masterpiece every piece that was broke off of the great Diamond had the same makeup as the diamond it had the same makeup but it was just a little piece amen amen so brother random said so finally he said as he started way back in the days of Moses and he come down through the prophets to each one and finally building up the body coming closer all the time and what is he coming closer to he's coming closer to the image that's in his mind why would he waste his time really why would he waste his time telling us about Michelangelo and explaining to us how a sculptor goes if he didn't want you to understand that so you could apply it to what God was doing you're going oh why is he talking about Michelangelo but the prophet was trying to get it to where you could see wait a minute wait a minute I'm starting to see something now it was coming he was building every time he chipped off a piece of the diamond and he showed Isaiah when he chipped off Jeremiah Jeremiah was a prophet from his mother's womb and if if that was true for Jeremiah that was true for every one of the prophets whether it was Obadiah or or nay home and and Ezekiel and and Malachi all of them they all were a chip off The Great Masterpiece now listen what brother Branham says he says and finally he was building up the body coming closer and closer all the time and the greatest of all of them was who was it no it wasn't it wasn't you made the same mistake the Pharisees made really no when you really John the Baptist was let's look at Luke 16. praise the Lord Luke 16 16. and look at what he says I it's the law and the prophets were unto John since that time the kingdom of God is preached the Masterpiece has been revealed John looked so much like the masterpiece that they all said aren't you him aren't you the Messiah aren't you the Christ aren't you Malachi aren't you that Prophet that's going to come and restore the world aren't you are you see he looks so much he was so much in the image but he wasn't the image praise the Lord praise the Lord Brother random said he said he said in the greatest of all of them was John and that's why that's why Jesus in Matthew 5 when they came to him and they started arguing to me said think not that I have come to destroy the law which is my foundation and the prophets which are all my little pieces of me because when you've seen a prophet you've seen God Jesus told him he said didn't you call the prophets gods because they were little diamonds off of the great diamond amen praise the Lord all of God's thoughts being manifest in the hour that he wanted it to be made manifest amen if you read if you read Isaiah every prophecy that Isaiah gave think about it Isaiah went down to the um to the king and he said will you weary God will you marry him he says ask me a sign and the heavens above are on the earth below and the King says oh I got a prophet and he's mad um and he said behold I will give you a super sign Behold a virgin shall conceive right think about it it was a thought first then it had to come that thought had to be channeled into that piece of diamond that thought was a light and when it came into that diamond though you saw the light a virgin shall conceive but that's not the end of the story oh it looked like the end of the story because it was 700 years later before it did its final part and became the manifestation it never made it less of the word it was still the word but the word is not complete until it's manifested amen praise the Lord amen so the greatest of all of them was John the Bible said so Jesus said so and there is not a man ever born a woman as great as John the Baptist for he was the one that could introduce the word he was the one that introduced Christ he was the one it was he he looked so much like him he was the first cousin he was he was the one that could pull the veil back and say Behold the Lamb of God no other Prophet said that when Isaiah said behold a virgin shall conceive Mary when she heard that word All She had she had no you know she had nothing to do except it or say this is too hard for me that I said just two choices and the word the word came into existence the Masterpiece came God's Masterpiece that he had hid before the foundation of the world the only the only evidence that he ever gave that he was going to do this great thing was when he told Adam and Eve and The Serpent and he said I the sir the woman's seed will bruise your head and you will bruise his heel amen and they had no idea what he was going to do and how he was going to do it otherwise they'd never destroyed him amen so what is the difference you know when you think about it so you've got this big diamond here and you've you've chipped off all these small diamonds and and what it is going to do is you're going to reveal the master Diamond inside of it so they're all reflections but brother Branham said he said well he said listen he goes all of the prophets had flaws that's why they could never be the masterpiece they could not be the Masterpiece because they had flaws Moses had a temper right all of them had some problems some little thing that that tripped them up all the time but that did not that did not separate them from the masterpiece your flaws if you are a negative of a positive somewhere there is nothing that can separate you from the love of Christ there is nothing no nothing nothing there is nothing that's why I'm crazy I just when I think about all of my flaws I go Lord I got way too many flaws in me because it it's not looking at my flaws he's looking at the Masterpiece and I'm a chip off of him amen all the prophets had flaws all the ones there was a portion but here at last coming up through that finally comes the Masterpiece the perfect one no fault in him at all so perfect reflected of the Builder himself praise the Lord that which was hidden in his mind was now coming into reality amen just like when we looked at the picture and we saw Moses nobody had seen Moses but Michelangelo that Vision it so was impressed on his mind that he spent 40 Years of his life building that thing to make it exactly remember we talked about even down to the hairs God knows exactly how we're all going to turn out praise the Lord his own image was reflected in his work God and Christ were one and so much until he put his own Spirit into him and then when the image and the Builder became one God and His scripture his sculpture work his Masterpiece where Moses was in the work of Saint Angelo or Michelangelo rather was a sculpture work that was dead right because it was granite but God has has materials that he's building his Masterpiece out of and he's not like you and me you know like brother John he's going to build his wife out of love he's building her a greenhouse okay so brother John has to go and and gather up materials and if he gets the wrong materials he's going to take her back and get other materials until he gets the right materials not so with God because God thinks it then he speaks it and it is and when it comes into manifestation amen when he built his word the world he built it with his word amen amen amen amen the sculpture's work was dead Michelangelo's because it was made out of stone but here the master builder amen when he got his handiwork perfected and each one of those prophets when he chipped him off he was hoping for Perfection but they fell then he'd chip off another piece and become more into the image it's interesting because he's chipping him off and you think well I don't need that no more no not God God doesn't throw anything away he's not going to throw us away he just chips you off and then he works with you they chipped him off and all the time he's making his body work it's getting closer and closer and closer in His image and then John comes and John's so much like him they all think that all of Jerusalem was moved the hall went out to hear him preach they all looked at him they said oh this is this has got to be the Messiah and he says but I'm not and then I thought I thought wow John's Ministry was so small he didn't have a thought a flaw and I thought about it and I said yeah he did he had a flaw when he got down into prison his Eagle Eye got filmed over and he doubted the one the way he act the man that he actually said Behold the Lamb of God when he got in prison he said did I goof up was that maybe maybe maybe I didn't see the dove descend may maybe maybe maybe you're not who I mean because this isn't working out the way I thought it would this is just not the way it you know I I had I had Greater Image of what I thought was going to happen and and Jesus looked and said he said when you went and saw John what'd you go out to see a man in fine robes did you go out to see a reed shaking in the wind he says no he says you saw not only a prophet but you saw more than a prophet amen because he introduced the masterpiece God's Masterpiece the total reflection of the invisible God that's what John said in 114. he said we'd heard the word we saw the word and we handled the word the word became flesh and we touched it the word became flesh and we sat down and ate with him the word became flesh and we saw him multiply Five Loaves and and you know the fishes and and we saw him raise the dead we we were partakers of the heavenly amen amen praise the Lord amen amen and brother Branham said so he says when the sculptor worked he says because here the master builder when he got his handiwork perfected he stepped into it amen so I want to let's let's go to Matthew 3. so I'm going to take a look at this praise the Lord Matthew 3 verse 16. so it says in Jesus when he was baptized went up straight way out of the water and lo the heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son and whom I am well pleased amen now I want to go over here and look at how Mark looks at this Mark 1. amen Mark 1 verse 10. so it says and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens open in the spirit like a dove descending upon him and there came a voice from Heaven saying Thou Art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased he was so proud of his masterpiece let's go to Luke 3. amen amen Michelangelo when he stepped back and he saw Moses he saw him he said oh this is this is that verse 21 it says now Luke 3 21 he says so now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that Jesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was opened and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice Came From Heaven which said Thou Art my beloved Son and whom I am well pleased praise the Lord he stepped into his masterpiece but you notice there's something missing and all three of those scriptures there's something missing he never told him to speak because you can't be a masterpiece unless you go to the Hall of the critics Luke says in straightway he was driven into the wilderness Matthew says that he went out into the Wilderness and fasted 40 days and the devil came and tempted him and you know that everything that Jesus did from that day forward to mount Transfiguration was God trying him it was God trying him and him having to wait wait for that Vision to come before he could move waiting for the vision before he could raise the dead waiting for the vision to know what to do because he said I do nothing right amen he has to go through the Hall of the critics before he can speak now brother Branham he brings another Parable into the masterpiece and he starts this story about the Chinese and he says when the Chinese came over here he says they didn't know our language he says they didn't know you know how to how to communicate with us he says but they were good laundromen I said okay and he says but when you took your dirty clothes to the to the he said now he said he would give you a piece of paper and of course you know you could sign your name and leave your address and everything else but he's got to have something so he knows and and if if you duplicated it if you wrote it twice and gave it to somebody else and they could come but he says what the Chinese did is he says they ripped a piece of paper in half and they were careful how they tore it and they gave you half the paper and they kept half the paper he said so that when you came back and your clothes were now very clean and folded the two pieces of paper would match and you got the clean and the dirty was washed away [Music] [Laughter] yeah praise the Lord brother Branham says so when God by the prophets and now remember we read the baptism right so he got baptized but he was never told to speak his mother went to him and said she told she told it wasn't Jesus saying daddy told me to change the water in the wine she came to him and said and she told the servant she says whatever he says you do what he says and they came and he changed the water in the wine so everything that he did up to mount Transfiguration so and we'll get to that in a minute so he says and when God by the prophets and under the law condemned us to sin and the law has no Grace it only tells you you're a sinner amen I mean if you if you really sit down and think about it you know even the Paschal Lamb and the scapegoat and the turtle doves and all the the Bullocks and everything that they sacrificed none of that could wash away sin none of that could make you justified in the sight of God the only way you were justified in the sight of God is if if the priest said God has accepted this based on the law that you have fulfilled the law but you just went right back out a rank sinner just like you always were amen amen but when Jesus came on the scene he was the Fulfillment he was the Fulfillment of everything God had promised and what was that all of the law that Moses had given plus all of the prophecies that each little Diamond had prophesied and Jesus was the Fulfillment it was he was the period of every one of those because every sentence ends with period unless you got poor penmanship right Jesus was the conclusion of it he was he was the Fulfillment of everything that God had promised he was the perfect identical image of the promise Moses couldn't do that you remember brother Branham talked about it he said when when Jesus when when the devil came to Jesus and he took him up on the mountain he says hey he goes I see you've been fast in 40 days and I see you're a little bit hungry he says Journey stones in the bread Jesus had the power to do that you have the power to do that you have the power to speak a world and go live on it love but you're a negative and the negatives got flaws they navigated this guy shirt comings and when brother Brandon said it like this he says when when the devil went to Jesus and he tempted him with the stones to turn the stones into bread he says he says he realized he had not met Moses because Jesus came back and defeated him with the Living Word of God because he was the Living Word of God he was the Masterpiece how about your power he had without the authority praise the Lord amen The Identical image of the promise therefore all the promises all the promises of the Old Testament was met in Jesus Christ it couldn't be met in Moses it couldn't be met in any other prophets but it was met in the Masterpiece it matched all that it said it was going to be and then I thought well there's that again therefore The Chinamen you could claim where the law condemns you and said you were dirty and you were guilty and could not and and could put you in the prison but when he came back Jesus when he come back he was the match peace for it that could take you out and every one of us when we were in God's thinking God take a little piece of paper your birth certificate and he cut it in half he ripped it in half and he gave you half of it and he sent you down here as a negative and you got that thing all dirty you got it all messed up but one day the light came and you saw the Masterpiece and when you went to the Masterpiece with your piece of the ticket because now are we the sons of God Amen when you go back with your piece of the ticket he's got the ticket that says yes and now I gave him my old filthy garments he gave me a robe of pure white hallelujah hallelujah the Masterpiece amen amen but see when he came he was the match piece for it he could take you out and bring you back to the complete ticket the Redemption that God had promised back in the Garden of Eden thy seed shall bruise the Serpent's head but his heels shall bruise amen and brother Madam says so on and on we could go because he was simply he was the match of David David and all of his flaws and his failures and adultery and everything else he only had half the ticket but Jesus had the other half of the ticket and when he Rose when he rose from the dead the graves were opened and the two tickets matched in David Rose amen the two tickets matched in Jeremiah Rose the two tickets match and Isaiah came on the face of the Earth all because Jesus Christ is my perfect sacrifice oh because he's the one he's the one that's paid the debt he's the one that met the requirements of the word because I frankly I just can't do it right amen amen amen he was the match of David he was the match of Moses he was the match of Elijah he was the match of Joseph everything that is portrayed or foretold by him in the Old Testament matched right into what what was it what was it because now you think about it so you got two Parables here you got one where the but then again you got the diamond and now all those little pieces when they come back they all fit in a perfect place in the diamond amen amen praise the Lord the perfect Redeemer that we could put our old dirty clothes into the laundry and then go down and claim it again it's been washed in the blood of the Lamb we can claim what's our own I don't claim the sin-filled life I'm not claiming the negative I'm claiming my inheritance the positive amen amen and the proof that there's a positive there is you see me that's the proof that I'm there amen amen we can claim what's our own and everything that he died for we can claim it so he is he was the perfect word portrayed so perfect a redeemer of a man so perfect so Godly yet there was no beauty that we should desire him no reason brother Branham said that is because when he preached the Masterpiece he used Isaiah 53. that was his opening text and he says so there is no beauty that we should desire him and when this virgin-born son of the Living God became so perfect so humble and in the image of God until the Great Master who had brought his life up through the prophets you see I'm not making this up he brought them right up through the prophets and he was the fulfilling of all the prophets he was so perfect until God seeing this not only at at his baptism he stepped into his masterpiece because that's what he said he smote him and he cried out speak as Michelangelo did speak and you say is that so mark 9. amen Mark 9 and verse 2. and after six days Jesus talked taketh with him Peter James and John and leaded them up into the high mountain apart from themselves and he was transfigured before them and his Ramen became shining exceeding white as snow as so no Fuller unearth can wipe them amen and there appeared unto him Elias with Moses and now you see why that that has to be there the law and the prophets has to be there because the law is the word and the Prophecies of manifestation of the word and they're coming to the word they're coming to the great sculptor they're coming to the Masterpiece that's why they were standing there amen praise the Lord and Peter answered and said to Jesus Master it's a good for it's good for us to be here let us make three Tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias for he knew not what to say for they were so afraid amen just like they were back at um Mount Sinai they're in the desert they were they were afraid in the presence of God Amen and sometimes it's just better to keep your mouth shut amen and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son here him and if you can receive it from that time forward Jehovah the old never spoke again if you go and look in it now because brother Branham used Mark 9 that's why I quoted mark 9. but if you go and you look at the settings of one of the mount transfigurations it may be maybe Matthew you'll find out when they came down they ran into the epileptic child and they and they asked Jesus they the the man said he said you know he said Do you believe and he says yes I believe Lord but help my unbelief and he said how long has this been and he told them and everything else and then so he prayed for him and then the disciples said why couldn't we do this and then if you just keep reading you keep reading Thomas comes to him and Philip Philip I think it is comes to Jesus and he says master show us the father and Jesus who the Masterpiece is now in his fullness he says when you've seen me hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen we find apparent Mount Transfiguration when they stood there with Moses the law and there stood Elijah the prophets and all the way back from the Patriarchs the fathers the laws the prophets and all of them standing there we hear a voice coming down from the cloud and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him and if they're going to hear then he's got to speak it was just a few days before he was smitten so it's a little different you think you think that the smiting at Calvary was the crucifixion but it's not that's not the smiting the smiting is the spear in his side this is my so they're going to hear he's got to speak as just a few days before he was smitten this is my son whom I'm pleased to dwell in I have molded him I've been four thousand years bringing him to this and now he is so perfect I've got to Smite him so that he can speak and hear ye him he is the perfected one he is the masterpiece praise the Lord praise God so when he went to Calvary when he all the things the tram full entry in and all the prophecies and everything else God was manifested in the flesh and he walked to Calvary as a man he went there on his own free will because the word had to be fulfilled he could not break the prophecies if he was the Fulfillment of all the prophecies and when he went to Calvary he had to he had to willingly let the spirit of God step out behind the flesh that Spirit stepped out and he said my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me because you can't kill God unless he stepped out and when he stepped down a free man said I do this for the negatives I do this for the positives that are here tonight I do this for you he was sinless he didn't have to do that so when he said it was finished it's finished for every one of us amen all we're doing is playing out our little part amen till the negative will become positive one day amen amen praise the Lord amen that's where I wanted to go the first night [Laughter] and I couldn't remember Angelo could only cry out and smite the image and say speak but how different it is with God the great sculptor when he made a man in his own image so perfect that it reflected him and none of us reflect him unless the word is born in us what was right open my eyes Lord unless the word is born in you then it's just a dead letter oh yeah the Bible says I shouldn't swear so I'm not swearing the Bible says I shouldn't drink so I'm not going to swink I'm I it says I shouldn't do this I'm not doing it I'm not I'm I'm whatever the Bible says I'm going to do it and that ain't gonna do you one bit of good because you've got to have the thought of God come down and step inside of you you have got to be born again you have to have the spirit of God to make that word live and when that word comes alive then you become God's masterpiece amen amen and believe it or not I'm not done [Laughter] but I am done for tonight praise the Lord so remember God had a thought it became word then it became flesh God all the Patriarchs he had a he had a diamond he had a hidden Mystery and he chipped it all off and he never threw any of them away and everyone that all the prophets who lived the word who stood up and stood before I mean look none of us we we're coward I know I'm a coward don't ask me to get in a fiery furnace it's seven times hotter a guy getting near heat and I get you know John was telling me about bonfires at his house we could go over and have a contest so you can get close enough to the bonfire ain't gonna be me don't you see it was The Word Alive inside of them they were constrained it wasn't even their choice they didn't even when when his when they said when they said we're careful O King we don't even care what you think or anything else we're not gonna bow to your image what was that that was God's thoughts coming down and speaking through them and then the manifestation came when they walked right up to that fire amen amen God's masterpiece praise the Lord praise the Lord amen let's fire our heads amen dear Lord Jesus Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your mercy we thank you Lord for what you've done for us father we know we're living in a negative world this is a negative father we just know that if we're here then there's a positive somewhere and where we've heard from our theophany we've heard from our positive and we're staying we're staying until that positive this negative becomes into that image Lord that's the desire of our hearts I pray father you'll take the simple message Lord you take the word that we've heard tonight let us think on these things and Lord Jesus may it transform us into masterpieces that you'll be proud of that you'll say this is my son this is my daughter I'm pleased to dwell in them I'm pleased to walk with them I'm pleased that they let me use their body that I can fulfill my promises in this age we love you and we thank you Father for all these things in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen praise the Lord amen Brother John praise the Lord [Applause] it's the unveiling of God to us that's right the one thing that we all have in common is God has revealed himself to us and we can only we have got to manifest the word he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and when the word is coming forth across the pulpit when we can receive that word by faith then it becomes manifested in their life and without that we're still needing to hear from God and that's how we know we know when we hear from God there's just something inside that just says amen that's that's for me and don't be discouraged if it doesn't get manifested in in one day or two days or one week or three weeks or five months or five years when God said let there be light we don't know how long it took before that light appeared so whatever God has spoken to us we're just going to hang on to it until we become in His image amen let's stand together we really appreciated these these Jewels these jewels that have been handed out in this great message called the Masterpiece I want to encourage you to to listen to that message and and and no matter what message we listen to when you listen to it again you're gonna get some more nuggets out of it and uh I believe that's why God sent profit for us is to to receive these things so um do we know it's all in him it's all in him nope okay let's sing um I know the Lord will make a way for me amen amen [Music] I know the Lord will make a way for me I know the Lord will make a way for me if I live a holy land and the wrong into the right I know the Lord will make
