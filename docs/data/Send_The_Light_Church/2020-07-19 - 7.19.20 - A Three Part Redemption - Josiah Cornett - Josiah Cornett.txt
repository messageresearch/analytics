promise amen if you're meek and lowly he will give you rest hallelujah i'm so thankful on this day we're living brother i'm thankful for the rest that we have in god things are are are bad out there in the world as we know but the news is things are going to get a lot worse like it or not how do i know that do you get a connection with fox news or cnn yeah well this book here tells us it tells us and we need to enter into that rest abide in that rest it's the only safe place for us well um we're thankful for the dedication that we're going to have this morning and last night i just kind of leaned over towards cheryl and i i said can you please sing get ready to practice uh bring them in because brother branham always saying that before bible or baby dedication and she said we're already singing that and then i knew right then the lord was in this amen because we we don't uh sing it very very very much but uh i don't believe that was a coincidence amen well it's been a while since we had a baby dedication and i just wanted to read some some scriptures because there are many churches out there they believe in either uh of infant baptism or or sprinkling and um through the scriptures you can never find what that's ever practice it was something that was started by the catholic church and actually went on into a lot of the protestant churches but scripturally we can't find it but we want to follow the scriptures as close as possible amen and this is what jesus did we can find it in mark uh chapter 10 i don't know if we could get that up on the screen verse number 13. amen you know what lightning represents right the voice of god that's right amen mark chapter 10 verse number 13 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those parents that brought them and when jesus saw it he was much displeased you know the disciples don't always got it right and said unto the disciples suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god verily verily i say unto you whosoever shall receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms and put his hands upon them and he blessed them and that's what we want to do today and i think the greatest thing that we could say to one another is god bless you the greatest thing that we could desire that god would do for any one of us is that god would bless them amen and i don't know any greater thing to do with a a baby a child and to dedicate them to the lord and ask god to bless them just in the simplicity of the gospel i believe in in god doing everything doing the protection and and and meeting the needs amen amen we're going to ask brother tyler and sister brooke to come forward with little blair emerson this morning amen we're we're thankful for the work that god is doing in these two parents as well amen amen you spent some time training them to be nice and good get this ready for vocational amen praise the lord well it's just all of us borrow our hearts in prayer thank you jesus our dear heavenly father what a privilege it is to to hold life in our arms the very life that you created yes lord jesus we don't believe in some sort of accident that took place that created life but we believe that the creator of heaven's earth created this life yes lord you brought this couple together lord you brought these two wonderful human beings together and lord that brought forth this this child lord and they lord they feel humble and insufficient to themselves to protect this child and to meet every need that would arise and so lord they've they've they're looking to you and want to dedicate little blair back to you lord because you've given them to them and lord today as they stand as we stand united lord there's many things in the world many sicknesses oh god only you can be with blair every minute of his life only you can keep him safe and sound and lord we want to give him back to you lord lord we want to ask you to bless him lord jesus father there's also spirits that are out there that would try to influence him and lord if he would uh if you would tarry your coming lord and he would become lord of the age they would be influenced in the schools and by other people lord we just ask that you put a hedge of protection around him yes you would keep them from all the lord the spiritual sicknesses as well lord as the natural sicknesses and diseases father oh god you're able to put a head to protection around your people you did it in the bible lord and you you do it today and father lord if you would come to that age where lord he could uh lord make decisions on his own age of accountability may he choose you may he choose to the right thing to serve you lord and i pray that lord you'd call for the kingdom of god that he could be a servant for you lord or whether he he's a preacher or lord whether he just serves your kingdom in some other way may you use them for your kingdom we pray and fathers we stand here with them with the parents lord father is there they're seeking to to know your way and to to be guided by your way father we ask that you would reveal yourself to them as they continue to come to church and continue to read the bible and to get into the message of the hour how to know your ways that lord they could be the parents that this little bundle of joy is gonna need in this dark hour that we're living in i pray that you would hear their prayers lord when they come together to pray for a little blessing lord may you hear their prayers as they unite together and may you answer them lord may you give them faith and i pray lord jesus that you just bless this family to be a real solid family in the days to come lord we commit him now into your hands and the whole family these uh gallant parents lord in the precious name of jesus christ we ask it all amen amen amen praise the lord amen amen praise the lord we're thankful for the grace of god amen amen it's good to also see gabrielle and jonathan i i believe that's correct and then travis so good to see travis and and and keely uh what a blessing it is to have them with us today and may the lord jesus just bless you this morning with the word amen and it is a privilege to have brother josiah with us um we've been trying to arrange this for a little bit now but we know that god's timing is always the right timing and we just trust in that let's stand together and and let's pull the word that god has given up uh our brother uh for us amen we believe that don't we amen amen all things are possible only believe all things are possible only oh you've got water right take your liberty i believe all things are possible lord i believe in jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible for jesus is here jesus lord things jesus possible jesus is here amen praise the lord always happy to be in the sanctuary of the lord this morning amen as brother john was saying we uh i've been trying to uh come together here for a time of fellowship for a while it's uh it's so good to be able to come amongst believers and fellowship again we certainly felt um kind of taken advantage of by the devil and the schemes when we were shutting down churches for a little while there and and uh just trying to be as wise and cautious as we could given the uncertainty of the hour but it's it's good to be back together again brother john first reached out to me and you can have your seats for just a moment i want to greet you for a minute if i could when brother john first reached out to me uh he had asked if i could come up the fourth of july weekend and at the time we had just been planning our our first uh little get together at our home we had some members of our church out the whole youth group and some different ones and um ended up having another church sherwind and um we had another one of the other area churches joined with her youth group it was just a real real good time of fellowship that saturday july 4th and we certainly enjoy the fellowship of the saints but we had a lot of people that were explaining that they really felt like it was a real nice time just because uh with the tri-state youth services being cancelled and so on i know many of the members in the church here joined for that and um we got that comment so much i went back to brother paul i said brother paul people are missing out on tri-state youth service we've got to do something so this coming august 14th and 15th we'll be having another event we want to share that with you i think your pastor will send out the details i shared with him but we'll be having a brothers and fathers fathers and sons camp out and then friday night and then followed on on the grounds at our family property we'll have a youth service an outdoor event trying to keep in mind everyone's concerns for the current situation and um so if that's something that any of the youth here would be interested in or if any of the fathers would be interested in bringing their sons i would certainly ask you to get up with a john there for the information we shared and we got a whole itinerary listed up and uh we would love to see some some some of the members out here and have some more fellowship but today we're looking forward to just the fellowship of the work and uh i'm so happy to be able to to fellowship with you let's go before the lord dear precious heavenly father lord i'm just so thankful that we were able to find a time to to come and break the bread of life together with this precious group lord lord i i think about how i love preaching to them the lord and well i couldn't say that i've got a favorite group to preach to but they're certainly my favorite kind of group lord a group of people that love your word lord lord a group of people that believe your word father worship and spirit and truth and where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty lord and every time i come to preach here lord i feel liberty to preach liberty and the people to worship and to receive father well we just pray that would be another time of of being at liberty in your spirit this morning lord and it's it's not the words of a man that set people up free but it's it's the blood of jesus christ and the spirit of the lord that gives liberty to the individuals so lord as we open up your word we pray that your spirit would come behind it lord and vindicate it to the people by the moving of your spirit grant dear lord jesus we commit this service to you lord may you receive us in your arms and and draw us up into your presence lord as john said i was in the spirit of the lord oh father may we find ourselves there on the lord's day today in jesus christ's name we committed to you amen if you would stand with me well turn to the word think about independence day and i'm just so glad that we have the the independence to be able to turn our english is over that have been been fought for and blood has been shed to bring this bible to us to the ages and preserved by the spirit of the lord i'm so glad that we have the the the ability to turn there this morning let's let's turn to hebrews chapter six we're going to start at verse one and you all say amen when you get it the preacher always beats there because i'm cheating with my bookmarks but you just let me know when we get there and i believe we're going to have a good time in in the word this morning that's at least that's what i come from for is that is that what you came for i i always like to leave church service feeling a little bit better than when i left and if i don't feel that then maybe i i didn't get what i came for but i i come from more of the lord is that what you're here for for this morning i believe we'll find that in his word this morning let's read it together then now you have it amen amen chapter 6 and verse 1 paul writing here he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of the laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of the eternal judgment and this we will do if god permit may the lord bless his word as you're seated love how paul lays this out here he says you know let's go on unto perfection he says let's let's not lay again the foundation of of all these other things that we already believe in we we know that we believe in the repentance from dead works we know that we believe in the resurrection from the dead we know that there's going to be a body change we know all this he says that's just foundational but praise god we've got a call from god to keep on going but there's there's a road ahead of us that we can keep journeying down i love the christian life because it never gets boring there never comes a place where you can say i've arrived i'm all settled i'm just i'm just going to wait for the coming of the lord he says no we we we believe in the doctrine of baptisms we believe in the baptism of jesus christ we'll do that and i believe that if anyone hasn't been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of sins and for repenting i believe we should do that but we're not going to lay again that foundation in your life if you can say i've done that you put it behind you you don't need to go back to it you don't need to get baptized the second third or fourth time it's done it's over with when you come up and you you ask the preacher to lay hands on you you go back believing that god's finished his work we don't need to come back a second third and fourth time brother brandon taught us that just weakens faith let's not lay again the foundation but let's go and move on towards perfection and that's what i'd like to preach on this morning by the grace of god if we can preach on a three-part redemption a three-part redemption now we know when we approach the the salvation of our souls that sealing of the holy ghost there's there's a three-part process to that it's justification sanctification and baptism of the holy ghost justification recognizing that jesus christ shed his blood for us that the price has already been paid at calvary submitting ourselves to god cleaning out our lives and being sanctified made a as it were the vessel that was dishonorable because it was cast down in the dirt but that vessel itself was what was not uh uh without use god recognized that that you were useful to him that you were that you were worthy to him if he would just clean you up and that's what sanctification is it's picking up the vessel from the ground and scrubbing it out readying it to be filled with the holy ghost so we see that god's process works in threes for the just even the filling of the holy ghost justification sanctification and then baptism and but we we have to consider that what happens after that right i believe there's there's many saints here that could say that i i received the holy ghost you know five years ago 10 years ago last year maybe but but what happens after that amen paul says in ephesians 1 14 that the holy ghost is the earnest or the down payment of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession so now the holy ghost is just a down payment of what we're waiting for and then there's going to be a day of redemption and ephesians 4 30 it says grieve not the holy spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption and that's that's the the day of redemption of what these these mortal bodies change back to the immortal bodies that we were having from the beginning the atom fell from amen so first we start with having our souls redeemed and then we have our bodies redeemed at the end as a complete work but what happens in the middle what kind of redemption is god is god still doing a redemptive work in our lives and that's what i want to broach this morning and to answer that question we have to consider what are we being redeemed to because remember the word redemption it means not just not just transformed from from a low estate to a higher state it means brought back to that's that whole re part of the word redemption that god from the foundational world saw us as we were in his mind but then there was a fall back in in the garden of eden that man fell from his original state and now god is bringing us back is that just a redeemed soul is that just bringing back a glorified body no because we go back in the original scripture we find out that man was made in the image and likeness of god in other words man had eternal life but it wasn't just that there was no death in man because there was no death in all the garden of eden but man was made in his image he was fashioned after his likeness after his character if you will so when man fell from the garden and we told that original lie he fell not only from his body his glorified body and transformed into a carnal body but he was fallen from his estate of character and that character was perfectly displayed in christ jesus the perfect man amen did you ever stop and consider that that when man fell wasn't just the the serpent that got a body change you know we know the serpent got a body change because his judgment was that that he he would be on his belly all of his days and people draw things about the serpent like he was some slithering creature in the garden well then it wouldn't have been a curse to tell him he's going to be on his belly all his days but then man's man didn't had a body change also he went from a glorified body that didn't taste sin to a body that the woman had pain and labor the the man had to work now by the sweat of his brow his days were numbered oh i'm so glad that we can say that one day i'm going back to where i don't have to work by the sweat of my brow one day i'm going back to where i don't have to see my my wife in the pain of labor anymore fear for lives and fear for the safety of my family i i won't have to worry about our lives ending i won't have to worry about a virus making us sick anymore i don't have to worry about government control because i'm going to a land that's controlled by a perfect governing supreme being oh there's no corruption there's no there's no there's there's not going to be any questions that i have to second guess you know even even questions that even even or decisions that i have to second-guess and even decisions that are made perfectly i still have to second-guess them now because i don't know the motive is behind them even if they're correct decisions but i'm looking forward to being at one man with the one who runs the government of heaven amen oh that's what we're going back to friends so we see that that the god has a plan to redeem man back to his fallen state but it's not just just to redeem man back to eternal life but redeem mac man back to the character the image and likeness of god that we receive the holy ghost first but it's not then i'm just waiting now for a body change there's this if i can call it if i can take the liberty to call almost a middle stage of redemption that's now determined by how much you yield your spirit man to and what you yield your spirit to what you yield your reasoning to what you re yield your affections to what you yield your imaginations to are you yielding your imaginations to the word of god that says what if i follow this word what if i just step out on faith and lay hands on the sick and pray for them and take god at his word let's see what would happen or is it all caught up with what if i decorated my house this way and what if i tried to achieve this over here with my job and what if i tried to to do this home improvement project what are we yielding our spirits to that will end up defining what our characters become oh my so now there's this middle stage of redemption and brother uh paul the apostle talks about when he says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption so we know here that he's talking to holy ghost-filled believers he's talking to those that have been sealed he says but let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from among you with all malice do you mean to tell me that a holy ghost-filled christian could have wrath could be filled with bitterness could have anger seething within their spirit realm malice and an evil speaking and gossiping that doesn't sound like your prototypical holy ghost-filled believer that doesn't mean my stereotype but paul says it's possible because you can still you can come to the process of justification and sanctification and yield your soul to believing on the filling of the holy ghost and yet you can stagnate right there as a believer and if you're not careful if you don't keep on going down this road of redemption that calls us all the way back to eden that calls us back to a glorified body back to the garden of eden back to our original state oh my if you don't yield to that guidance you can stagnate and take on bitterness and wrath and disappointments of life can get you down and so he admonishes them be kind to one another tenderhearted think about the other have grace for the other give them the benefit of the doubt they they said something wrong and maybe out of maybe that was out of context maybe they didn't mean it that way maybe they they didn't realize people were taking it that way maybe they just need to grow up a little bit and that's okay giving grace towards one another amen oh i think there's a lot more grace that we could have amongst the children of god considering how much grace has been shed abroad in our hearts by the spirit of jesus christ i believe we can exercise grace towards one another forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake have forgiven you so we see that this spirit man has to be cultivated after receiving the holy ghost there's more work to do but brandon says it this way admonishing the people he says oh no we are going to take something with us friends speaking about when we die he says and what that something is is all we can take with us nothing less and nothing more if you've got nothing less nothing more you want to make sure that what you're taking with you is going to hold fast in the end he says we better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before god so what's that we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us and what kind of character will take you will be like his whose character was molded and by force by suffering in the fiery furnace of affliction amen or it would be the softness of this characteristic in people it is up to each one of us for every man in that day to bear his burden think about that what does that mean that day to bear his burden paul talks about he says we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according as he hath done whether it be good or bad you say wait a second brother i i thought i thought that the just shall live by faith and that the righteous are passed from from death and to life we shall not see the judgment we won't see the judgment between death and life we won't see the white throne judgment but remember even this the servants that the master gave the talents to they had a judgment what they did with their talents whether it be good or whether it be bad so paul says no matter who you are speaking to believers he says we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ all my friends when i think about it it fills me with godly fear to stand before the holy one to stand before the sinless one the spotless one and give a counter for what i did in this life i won't give an account of the things that i did that have been forgiven but i i think that i'll get be giving an account for the things that i did not do and and and and and the opportunities i didn't take right you know that's why people say i i'll just i'll just make it right at the end everything that i did wrong i'll just come up to my death bed and i i'll make everything right then and i'll have eternal life first of all you don't know you're not guaranteed a deathbed sometimes some people have a death car or a death accident you don't know that you're taking a gamble with your soul hanging overhead over over the flames of hell by a string i wouldn't do that amen but even if you could i do believe in deathbed confessions but can you imagine putting off the opportunity of a life with christ until the very end securing eternal life and then coming before the judgment seat of christ and giving an account for why you dismissed the opportunity here and here and here and waited until your very end oh friends i wouldn't want to do that i wouldn't want to stand before the supreme and awesome ruler the holy god of heaven that my my human friend can't even tolerate to be in the presence of i have to give an account of that the one who died that i could have life abundantly and say i rejected life until the end i wouldn't want to do that but what about us today we've accepted the lord jesus christ but what have you done with him since then amen even since you received the holy ghost what have you done with that token since them have you buried the token the gift of the holy ghost in the ground until the lord comes and calls you by name or are you taking that and allowing god to further mold into you his image and his character i'm not the only one that worried about this you're looking even the message in the the prophet which was uh christ in him was waving himself before the people in this man and here he says i know that someday i've got to die and i hope that god never let satan crown me as an old crabbed indifferent man how many old crab man have you seen your life old crabbed woman seems like their their face is just they've got more frown wrinkles than smile wrinkles he says my wife an old nagging woman are your wife or you that way i pray brother that our lives will be crowned with the fruits of the spirit and i know as we get older each one of us we're going to get something happen and something happen and i know those little things are just going to keep on accumulating as you get older and they just got to how many of you older ones can say i've got a lot of water in the bridge i i've seen a lot of things brother josiah you're just a spring chick compared to what i've seen hey i i get it i in my 33 years i look back over my life and if i allowed it to get to me there's enough things that that i'd be wearing a frown today instead of a smile and if you get your eyes on those things the the church split ups and what people did to you and what people said to you and what they might have meant by this and the disappointments in life and how things didn't turn out the way you thought they would turn out and how life isn't as big of a bang as you thought it might be right that's good little things just keep accumulating if you put your eyes on that instead of looking into jesus the author and finish of our faith then your character is going to take on a character of bitterness and disappointment malice brother goes on he says i think one of the most horrible things is for satan to crown some person's life a crabbed old man or woman and i hope you don't get to that place you younger ones that are close to my age than than calling yourself an old man or a woman look at yourself today what road are you on based on your actions and your response to life pressures are are you going down the road to see yourself as a crab dull man or woman or are you responding in a way that each pressure makes you stronger each suffering makes you better each each tier makes you more pure before the lord as he as he works out the dross from your gold are you allowing the character of jesus christ to be mold in you or will you find yourself a crabbed old man or woman the latter end i hope that i can bear my burdens he says i want my life crowned with the glory of god his long-suffering peace meekness gentleness page patience oh that's what i want friends but what does it take it takes yielding our spirits to the right thing now even paul said this he said every man striveth for the mastery and he's he's temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we in uncorruptable i therefore so run keeping under my body and bringing it into subject subjection lest by any means when i preach to others i should become myself a castaway you know i always wondered about that scripture because here paul's talking about i'm afraid that if i do all this work for god i could still turn up the ladder and be a castaway it's true and i thought wait a second this is the same paul that preached the doctrine of being sealed by the holy ghost so castaway can't mean what i think castaway means because to me the word castaway just means i i cast it off and i'm no longer associated it means a piece of trash that that i could do all this and if i if i did something wrong at the end god just throws me off like a piece of trash and it seems then like my life would be just kind of held on by a string a string of my own actions i knew that wasn't right because god doesn't throws people off like a piece of trash he says i hold them in my hand and which no man can pluck them from if no man can pluck me from his hand then that means josiah kilnette cannot pluck me from his hand if no man can pluck his his chosen from his hand that means that john martin can't pluck john martin from his hand that means that when you're sealed into the holy ghost you're sealed into the holy ghost and there's no man there's no devil there's no spirit there's no lust demon that can change that seal and break you out from jesus christ amen but there is something that can still make you a cast away before god so how do you remedy this brother branham said it this way i think it's so beautiful i i don't like to take away from the prophet when he says it perfect he says if talking of adoption he says if that boy was born in a home as a son he did not become a right boy he would not follow his father's instructions if he would not be about his father's business that boy was always a son but he never got any inheritance he was just a castaway and when you get the holy ghost your god's son or god's daughter that's true enough but if you don't obey god and walk in the light and walk in the word and believe god then you won't have any inheritance where is that decided is that the side of the judgment seat of christ so we've got this beautiful space of time from the time that we receive the gift of the holy ghost answer god's call in our life now that opportunity to have god's life manifested after us paul says it this way we're changed as we look at christ from glory unto glory in eternity we're going to have all eternity to look at him but our character in this life gets molded now and so what you look at will change you from one glory into another or from one disgrace into another disgrace it's all in what you look at i remember hearing about brother branham saying he you know he was well traveled he went to these dark lands of africa and here there were worshipers of of the monkey and they they prostrated themselves before the monkeys so much until they started making monkey sounds and monkey noises and acting like a monkey what was it they prostrated themselves before something they looked at it so much they were changed from one disgrace into another disgrace instead of glory and the glory that they were called to amen i know as i look at you know as i look at diy projects my home can be transformed from one glory into another glory and as as as we look at decorating things uh our the decoration of our home can be transformed from one glory into another but in the meantime what am i being changed into where is my focus at what am i looking at and what am i being changed into oh my i love the gospel friends because on one hand there's the fear of god as you look towards the judgment seat of christ and on the other hand there's the blessings of god and both are certain you know even when god was talking to cain in genesis chapter 4 he says if you do good will you not be rewarded but if you do evil sin is long lurking at the door i love it the gods he he may have carry both a stick and a carrot but both the carrot and the stick are certain i love that because i i'm in the midst of child turning i see some of you are still in that that stage of life and something i see with my boys he needs consistency he needs certainty it establishes boundaries and it gives him it gives him a a certain amount of rest and security and i tell you what in in this world right now i need some certainty friends and if that certainly means you do this and you get punished but you do this and you get blessed i still thank the lord for it i i tell you god uses uncertainty to create character within his people i know that these times are in certain times we we have to we go over the border from one state to another and we don't know how we should act and we don't know how we should behave hard anymore i went over the border into ohio i'm like what are their local rules here we got to figure out how are people going to respond to us do we wear masks do we not wear a mask all these opinions from everybody and all the states are different and you don't know whether you just don't know yeah but that's life and large part life is uncertain but god uses that to mold character because he wants to see that in the time of uncertainty where will you place your faith oh hallelujah where will you place your faith in the time of uncertainty will you place your faith in your money and your assets and your your security plan or will you place your faith in jesus christ oh i'm so glad that there's there's some things that i can be sure about in life i i i'm not sure about a lot in this life but i'm sure about an awful lot in the life to come i've got an awful lot of promises waiting for me by one who's never broken a promise i i've got a promise of eternal life by one who who is the author of life i may not have a lot of assurances in this life but i know that i've got a couple of assurances it says that he said surely i'll not leave you nor forsake you and i can take that with me to the bank this morning amen and the time of unfor certainty i can put my faith in that word and say surely i'm holding the hand of jesus christ because he said he'll not leave me nor forsake me but he'll be with me and even in me until the end of the oh age i can say that i walk with christ i walk even as the ancients walked not because i'm not only walking with christ but i'm walking with him in me oh hallelujah say well brother josiah there's still a lot of things you don't know doesn't that make you nervous sometimes it does but i look back to god's promises i can tell you that i i i don't know whether i'll have a job next year i think it's pretty secure but i don't know right now it's an uncertainty you say brother josiah what would happen if you lost your job would you still feel that you that you've got something the hand of christ to hold on to would you feel certain in your life or would everything be spinning out of control i can say as david said surely goodness and mercy follows me all the days of my life and i'll dwell on the house the lord forever for the josiah you don't know if you'll be able to make your mortgage payment next month you just don't know with this economy if i lost my home and had the uncertainty of being displaced from a house and going from one place to another i can still say i've got the certainty of the hand of jesus christ brother josiah wouldn't you feel unsure of yourself i can say surely goodness and mercy follows me all the days of my life and i'll dwell in the house the lord forever brother josiah you don't know whether your children will serve the lord or not surely goodness and mercy follows me it'll fall after my children they may stray from the lord but i'll send prayers out after them because i'm a man of god i like job was a man of god i'll still pray after those children and claim the blood of jesus christ on them oh i think about the the the redemptive power of jesus christ that's calling us back from the fall [Music] if it can call back the sons and children of politicians and street vagabonds and prostitutes even if i make a mistake as a parent and they go astray i can say if the power of god is so strong to to redeem those that didn't have parents that showed them any model of christianity that i can say the power of god is strong enough to go after those that had something to look towards oh hallelujah god's power of redemption amen it's a certain power and we can say this morning that god is still calling us he doesn't call christians to just be a bump on a law he doesn't thank you brother he doesn't just call christians to receive the gift of the holy ghost and just wait for the rapture to come we've got something to do in this hour ask yourself what what is in my hand it's the good news the gospel of jesus christ you've still got a purpose you don't sit on a bump on a log somewhere what is in your hand let god use it yield that to the hand it might it might just be like an ox gold like shamgar had but get something in your hand and say oh god i'm gonna rely on your promises this morning oh hallelujah god's power redemption is at work he's redeeming us back to eden i want to say this god's power redemption is so powerful that it supersedes the power of the fall of your great great great great great granddaddy adam it's so powerful that no matter what adam did god's power of redemption brings you back to his character his image and his likeness if you'll only yield yourself to it you say you don't understand what i came from brother josiah you don't understand what i've done in life wait if god's power redemption is strong enough to supersede your great great great dan granddaddy adams fall so i think it's powerful enough to supersede your parents fall your grandparents fall the generational sin and so no matter what you came from and what character traits you and you you received and inherited from your family god's power of redemption this morning is powerful enough to pick you up from it and to complete a complete redemption a perfect redemption it's not just receive the holy ghost and bear with myself and try to live with myself i'm gonna get tired of living with yourselves just have to live with myself till jesus comes and makes me all better no he wants us to be changed now you might say you don't understand what what i've done in my life and i've just wrecked myself up my my body is riddled with drugs from the past or alcohol or my flesh just craves all these things because of what i've done the past and expose it to i want to encourage you this morning god's power of redemption is reaching out to you hallelujah and it's calling to you and it's not an unfamiliar voice that you have to give new heed to this morning it's the same voice that called you out of the world of the bondage of the world unto justification sanctification and filling with the holy ghost that same voice says take another step back to eating with me take another step you don't know how to properly love your children you you feel like you messed it up every time take another step let me show you what real love is maybe you never had an example as a child maybe you were beaten or abused in some way and your image of love your image of a father your image of a mother is now what it feels like crippling your ability to be effective today you don't have to wait for a body change to be healed of that amen god wants to redeem you in your spirit realm today and that's what he's inviting you to this morning he says take another step take another step back to eden with me that's what we're called to it doesn't matter what you fell from that's right it matters whose hand you have a hold of and that hand has the power to take you from showing you what real love is to showing you what real peace is you might say brother josiah i've never felt peace in my life my my very nature is anxious i'm always worrying i've got acid reflux condition because of it i've got this that or the other take another step amen you don't understand i i've been with the lord longer than what you've been born brother josiah take another step amen you might look behind you and say there's many steps behind me you probably some of you in this building this morning have more steps behind you than i do i have fewer steps ahead of you than what i've got behind me but yet there's more to come until the body change there's more to come and that's the blessedness the gospel of jesus christ this morning yes we'll be judged one day for what we don't do but i believe that if we yield ourselves this power that's been calling us all of our lives that will not be ashamed of the judgment that we'll hear those words well done thou good and faithful servant oh that's how what i'm living my whole life to hear brother just those few words well done thou good and faithful servant enter into the joys of thy reward you know what the joys of my reward is gonna be it's gonna be the presence of jesus christ all the days of my life and you know what the earnest the of the down payment the holy ghost does it brings the joys of my reward into this life that i can enjoy the presence of the holy ghost this morning i don't have to wait for it i'll have to become perfect for it i'll have to get my life just right to enjoy the presence of the lord he welcomes me as i am but offers me the power to change that's the god that we serve but this god does have a re a requisite requirement because he is a creator you want to know what the requisite requirement of god's transformative power in our lives are just look look to this world around you look to the the trees those trees just a few months ago were dry and barren they went through a cycle process you go back between before the fall they started to change their colors and lose their leaves as the as the temperature changes the atmosphere began to change i find the same thing when planning i have to find a certain kind of soil environment for a certain kind of plant might be alkali or basics it might be sandy soil or loamy soil i've got to have the right kind of environment for a plant to grow and that's what god requires in the christian life if you want to grow in christ you've got to have the right kind of requirement the right kind of atmosphere is required and it's not just church on sundays and church on wednesdays a little bit of fellowship by phone through the week but he says be holy as i am holy and that's what that's right brother that's what develops the character of christ is the atmosphere of holiness but did you know that holiness by itself is not a character trait that's true you know there's a lot of people that that they'll exercise the character trait of obedience that brings them into holiness they've cut off the dress the they haven't cut off the dress but they've they've cut off the dress the world the sisters have put on the dress the the modest garment the brother is no longer running around wearing the woman's clothing on their outside and whatnot clean ourselves up looks biffy we'll even cut out the movies and everything else and yet that by itself is not the character of jesus christ because you can still do that and still sit on a service with paul the apostle or josiah cornette and hear the words put aside all malice and bitterness and envyings and evil speakings and find yourself convicted so you have an atmosphere of holiness in your home because it's not just what you've done on the outside but what is your spirit man on the inside but god's process does require holiness did you know that the bible says that you'll not even see god without holiness i always thought that just meant you know without holiness i won't get into heaven but that actually applies today that you can't see god if your home is filled with video games that are are filled with violence if you're if your home is filled with shoot-'em-up games that turns your heart towards thinking about violence and and you pick out avatars that look like woman or you play with with with other men that are picking up avatars with with women that ought not to be dressed and they're so realistic i've seen it today brothers and they're so realistic it looks like you're watching almost a x-rated movie it's so dressed down or you you pull up your netflix and you say i'm not watching tv i'm not i'm watching netflix and you stream the things that you ought not to stream where is holiness in the home now i love the gospel because it really makes us live and address where the rubber meets the road friends it's not always in the principles of the doctrine of christ let's move on to perfection let's not lay again the old foundation that we know well enough about but let's look at our homes today and ask ourselves am i setting myself up for success am i setting myself up so that if time goes on my family will not be ashamed at the judgment i'll not be ashamed of the judgment i won't be a crabbed old man or old woman but i'm setting myself up to have holiness in music and dress and entertainment and what i have my eyes on holiness in my spirit realm what is that it's your reasoning what you justify what you find reasons to do your conscience your affections set your affections on things above for where your treasure where your heart is there's your treasure also where you place your treasure your hearts gonna follow friends and the holy heart that has the character of christ that's going to find their treasure in jesus christ do you feel the lord speaking to you this morning amen i've got a lot of notes left but i just want to slow down for a second and just ask you in this moment we know that there's a power that's calling us back to the garden of eden we're encouraged this morning knowing that it's a power that's willing to teach us how to love the right way that the outcome of our love would be the same outcome of the love of christ to have peace in the right way to have joy in the right way did you know that real godly joy will create joy around you it's not sarcastic joy that robs others of their joy in order for you to have joy you know that you've got the right kind of spirit of god love joy peace patience if it creates more around you instead of takes away from others to have it because when christ took the loaves and the bread he multiplied them the spirit of christ always multiplies amen you can look in the world around you see a lot of different people they they seem serene but their whole home is in chaos you say well they seem like a real peaceful person but it's not the right kind of peace because you can judge it by what its effects are so we were encouraged this morning to know that we've got a power that's willing to teach us and to grow us in the character of christ in peace and patience and goodness and kindness in temperance you know what temperance is it's not just the ability to hold your tongue when you feel like shouting temperance is the ability to restrain when given the opportunity to do evil when you feel so angry that whatever comes out of your mouth feels justified and you shut your mouth that's temperance but it's also temperance when someone's back has turned and you can do anything you wish but you restrain yourself from doing evil that's temperance that's the character of christ i think that any sane person would want these pure characteristics of christ in their life but we have to ask ourselves am i setting myself up for success am i doing what it takes to see this planting of the lord and he calls us his plantings amen to see it bloom with the blossom of jesus christ it requires an atmosphere of holiness and that it requires lots of sunlight what are you looking at you say i i want my word my works to be justified before christ in the end good works require two things good character paired with good leadership are you letting jesus christ lead you are you praying are you reading your bible or are we being drafted away to social media i'm guilty this morning friends it's it's a challenge of our age it's like it's a challenge that that no other age before us has has dealt with social media and entertainment and all these things what have you spent your extra time during the covid crisis when you were told to stay home and not go to work where did the extra time go has your home become more holy since covet or less holy have you walked further with christ or have you sat down when the whole world sat down and waited out coronavirus did you sit down and wait out the rapture amen or are you walking with jesus christ every day all my friends i love the gospel because it gives us a positive direction to go into amen if you do good will you not be rewarded there's a call this morning that says go back towards eden finish the redemption process with me jesus christ completed the redemption process of of filling you up with the holy ghost your soul just like that one day at an altar one day in the moment and twinkling of an eye that body change will happen just like that but this this middle stage of redemption if i can call it that this bringing us back to the character of jesus christ brother brahma said it's a victory not a gift there's the gift of the holy ghost but character is a victory and not a gift as a gospel minister i just came here this morning to encourage you to lay hold the victory to lay hold of god's victory for you he's given you the power he's given you the instruction he's he's promised that he'll never leave you nor forsake you that he'll guide you all the way back to eden imagine what it would be like to have perfect peace in our homes to to be able to love our children properly to show them a love that that would just overwhelm their defenses that would just overwhelm any demon be demonic power in their life remember the the maniac of gardera jesus christ was able to overwhelm those amen not just by the power of god alone but by who he was and we're given the same promise in mark chapter 16 that we can chase out those demonic powers but it's not just having the character the the power of god we want to be the person of god is that your desire this morning friends to have the character of jesus christ be molded on us let's stand before him and go to the lord as we stand i just want to close with this last closing scripture paul speaking in philippians 3 he says not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that which also i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count myself not to have apprehended i count myself not to achieve what i'm after yet even but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind can i encourage you this morning forget the past failures and the past successes don't rest upon those nor be haunted by them but do as paul said this one thing i do reaching forth unto those things that are before i press toward the mark of the high calling of god in christ jesus i hope i've painted the picture of something before you this morning that would encourage you to press on there's the image of jesus christ waiting just beyond an eden friends and there's no angel with a flaming sword guarding it any longer but there's a voice calling you from eden come home come home i wonder if you know that song come home i'd like to sing it with you i believe that's what the the spirit of the lord is is calling out this morning come home come home come home to christ's arms come home to eden as they load that song let's go before the lord dear lord jesus i just come before you lord thanking you lord for people that are on the pathway back towards eden lord a group of people that have been restored underneath the malachi 456 ministry back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers but we don't stop there lord but we join with our pentecostal fathers and the call to return all the way back to eden lord our rightful inheritance in christ and though we're subject to these sinborn bodies yet lord i'm so encouraged that you're still doing a work within our souls and our spirits to rid us from the effects of sin lord may everyone be encouraged this morning lord maybe someone that was sat down for a little while just to take a little reprieve as it were from the battle may they feel that sword and their holster again and say i'm going to cut through with the enemy this morning i'm going to let more of the character of jesus christ into my life and do whatever it takes to get there maybe take the take the sword this morning cut through some video entertainment cut through some video games cut through some music cut it out of my heart and then cut it out of my home oh i pray that the men of god this morning would make sure their own hearts are right before you and then lead their family in the way oh god grant lord jesus that we all may be purified from one glory into another lord and come home into your arms ready to stand before your judgment one day lord and hear those precious words well done thou good and faithful servant thank you lord jesus for your spirit this morning in jesus christ's name amen amen amen amen do we know that song softly and tenderly jesus is calling calling for you and for me is waiting and watching watching you and for me [Music] least [Music] when jesus is pleading and can you hear his voice come jesus is calling is oh call for me jesus is calling for the wonder and oh jesus is calling amen how many fields that jesus was calling you this morning amen amen i felt him calling me i think back in the 60s when the prophet said we backslid 100 times a day i still feel there is a when i go through the course of the day i'm a sinner saved by grace but i'm still sinning which is telling me that the message i heard today was perfect that's calling me to a higher calling to not be satisfied i'm in the message that i made it to church i paid my tithes i think job said that i will not be satisfied to awake in his likeness and too often we as message believers get the lair to see a spirit on us i'm in need of nothing and we we need to press on we need to have a purpose when we come to church of a purpose that has to do with his character being molded in us not just getting what we want from god but getting what he wants us to have for our lives amen amen amen i think the message was perfect this morning thank you brother and i i i believe that we have a track to run on now we can leave here knowing that we're going to go on from where we're at no matter where we're at no matter where we're at we got something to do i and i don't want to be a grumpy old man oh here comes that grumpy old pastor here comes that grumpy old husband i don't want cheryl to say that about me and i believe that the holy ghost is permeating out of me we can be crowned with his his spirit amen and by the way you don't have to be old to be grumpy you just gotta walk up and wake up on the wrong side of the bed just get back in climb on the other side get on your knees say lord fill me amen amen let's sing i've been redeemed we're still in the process but let's shout victory i've been you can talk about me any way that you please there's more this time and that's been to the not and i've been baptized hallelujah praise the lord i'll walk you up seven steps to perfection amen we're in that process amen holy yes i steps to perfection perfection steps to perfection full of praise for the powerful when you have the holy ghost your full power the power of the holy ghost and we are changed from glory and to glory the glory of god is seen in our lives amen i'm not content with where i'm at and i'll be honest with you i would have never got here if i ever would have been content and if i stay content right now that means i can't get to where i got to get it is yes to praise the lord let's sing one more song let's sing send the light because there's a call that comes ringing we heard god call us yes amen oh forever let and let us everywhere let it shine says that is let it shine amen we don't want to stop sending the light amen and i think of our the very fact that you all have come here today you believe that there's more for you amen amen i think of how the the lord was dealing with our brother ron husker he's feeling i just i can't stay here i've i got to get more than what i have and that's what god's calling all of us we can maintain that call maintain that hunger that thirst there's nowhere in the bible where god ever said you'll get to a place where no matter how much you hunger no matter how much you thirst you're not going to get any more that's right right so the more that we can hunger for god there's a deep call there's a deep to respond and it to me it's just exciting that we have something to look forward to that there will be more of god manifested in us and we can't do that if we could we would do it but to know that working with god through god to believe we're workers together with christ that he can change our vile nature to become more like him that's something to look forward to amen amen amen well he's not changing my good nature for a better one it's bad i'm calling it out like it is yeah well god bless our visitors today amen and we're we're asking that you not be visitors anymore that you just come and be with us because it's a warms my heart to see you amen pray that the word it was a blessing to you and and and a light amen god's word is the light amen it's good to have sister linda back with us amen let's continue to pray for sister lori and her sisters amen pray for brother bruce uh his body and remember the rom burgers and we're gonna have our precious brother jason back amen we've missed him and let's continue to pray for his son amen and i appreciate that amen well we're going to ask our brother mike if he would close the service lord we're your children lord you don't ever look at us lord as being useless lord we make mistakes lord you take people from all backgrounds lord i believe heaven is going to be filled with people that are from every sort of walk of life jesus you've given us a message this morning lord that no matter what happens lord no matter what we go through yes lord that you're going to be with us jesus and that you're going to help us lord to know you lord in a more intimate way lord than what we've known you lord amen i'm such a beauty lord in in knowing that lord that we don't have to just be satisfied with what we have god thank you for josiah and his family i pray thank you lord and i pray lord that you meet all their needs amen i thank you for everyone that's called lord just the wonderful spirit lord that's here the peace lord and just the drive to do better lord is such a blessing amen i thank you for protecting each person as they drive home if it's raining in the water if it's storming the lord keep them safe amen praise the lord [Music] yes you
