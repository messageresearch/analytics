[35:32] adoration and Lord all that you mean to

[36:16] able to receive it Lord that we might uh
[36:20] be about your business we pray we thank
[36:23] you for these things now as we trust
[36:25] your grace in the in the reading of the
[36:27] word word in Jesus Christ's precious
[36:29] name amen amen Matthew chapter 22 we're
[36:33] going to begin reading at verse number
[36:36] 15 then went the
[36:39] Pharisees and took
[36:41] counsel how they might entangle Jesus in
[36:45] his talk and they sent him
[36:48] out and they they sent out uh sent out
[36:52] unto him their
[36:54] disciples with the herodians saying
[36:56] master
[36:58] we know Thou Art true and teachest the
[37:00] way of God in truth neither carest thou
[37:03] for any man for thou regardest not the
[37:06] person of
[37:08] men tell us therefore what thinkest thou
[37:12] is it lawful to give tribute unto
[37:15] Caesar or not now notice their
[37:20] motive and Jesus perceived their
[37:23] wickedness and said why tempt ye me ye
[37:28] Hypocrites show me the tribute money and
[37:32] they brought unto him a penny and he
[37:35] said unto them who is this image and
[37:41] superscription and they said unto him
[37:45] Caesars then saith he unto them render
[37:48] therefore unto Caesar the things that
[37:50] are
[37:51] Caesars and unto God the things that are
[37:55] Gods when they heard these words they
[37:59] marveled and left him and went their way
[38:02] amen amen God bless you may be seated
[38:05] for subject today we want to talk about
[38:06] the things that are gods and entitled
[38:09] this message what belongs to
[38:13] God what belongs to God I don't know if
[38:16] it's something that you've thought of
[38:17] very
[38:19] much I mean he created
[38:24] everything he said Heaven is my throne
[38:28] Earth is my foottoo what will you what
[38:31] house will you build me but it's a good
[38:34] it's a good thought because Jesus here
[38:37] he said we need to Render unto God the
[38:41] things that are Gods
[38:46] amen notice here leading up to this that
[38:49] there were these
[38:52] Pharisees and uh the heronian they
[38:55] wanted to actually uh trick
[38:59] Jesus and there's always going to be
[39:02] people uh who disagree with the word
[39:06] that's that that's going to try to
[39:09] entangle you right when you when you
[39:12] have the spirit of Christ inside you the
[39:14] devil desires to entangle people with
[39:17] the spirit of Christ to try to twist
[39:20] them up when they're trying to do
[39:22] something good for the kingdom of God
[39:25] that Spirit brother B said people die
[39:27] but the spirit still lives on and so we
[39:30] know that that spirit is tries to get in
[39:33] there just to cause uh people to trip up
[39:37] the true people of God instead of
[39:40] helping Jesus they chose rather to tempt
[39:43] him and some people will even pull out
[39:46] scriptures or quotes to try to twist try
[39:49] to mix you
[39:52] up Master we know that thou art true a
[39:56] teach us the way of
[39:57] God In Truth neither carest thou for any
[40:00] man for thou regardest not the person of
[40:04] men in
[40:06] all in their motives that people have
[40:10] Jesus perceived their
[40:13] wickedness it's wicked to try to trip
[40:16] somebody
[40:18] up when when it is the spirit of God in
[40:23] them but I want to say God bless our
[40:26] visitor here but I'll say that if
[40:30] somebody's got a wrong
[40:32] Spirit that's another story because that
[40:35] needs to be called out are you with me
[40:39] but the thing is you better make sure
[40:41] that you know what you're dealing with
[40:44] because if you're doing that against the
[40:45] spirit of
[40:48] God Jesus said render therefore unto
[40:52] Caesar the things that are Caesars Jesus
[40:55] believed in rendering to other the
[40:57] things that are duee to
[40:59] them and that means that word render
[41:01] means to give back to others to
[41:03] recompense to make amends to
[41:06] others and he shares this in his word
[41:09] where the word says esteem others better
[41:12] than
[41:13] thyself to honor all men especially
[41:16] those of the household of
[41:18] faith because Christ laid down his life
[41:20] for us we ought to lay down our lives
[41:22] for the
[41:23] Brethren 1 Timothy 2:1 says I exhort
[41:26] thee therefore that first of all
[41:28] supplications prayers intercessions and
[41:30] giving of thanks be made
[41:34] for that word all all all men amen for
[41:40] kings and for all that are in
[41:44] Authority that we may lead a quiet and
[41:47] Peaceable life in all godliness and
[41:48] honesty so we see here that God really
[41:52] wanted things to be rendered to Caesar
[41:55] that belonged to Caesar now I know that
[41:57] l lot of people hate the
[41:59] government for one reason or
[42:02] another and I'm sure Caesar was not a
[42:05] perfect you
[42:07] know I'm sure Caesar was not perfect but
[42:10] yet Jesus said render onto Caesar the
[42:13] things that are
[42:15] Caesars of course we knew they were
[42:16] talking about taxes at the
[42:18] time now we're living in such a Godless
[42:21] age perilous time churchgoers ungrateful
[42:24] unthankful
[42:28] if you do something for somebody and it
[42:30] isn't just perfect they'll let you
[42:32] know ain't just perfect and they they'll
[42:35] they'll they'll reward you for it amen
[42:38] in other words there's no genuine agape
[42:41] love amen and Bible says because
[42:44] iniquity would abound the love of many
[42:46] would wax cold indifferent without
[42:50] affection 1 Thessalonians 5:15 we're
[42:53] just kind of laying a foundation here 1
[42:55] Thessalonians 5:15 see that none render
[42:59] evil for evil unto any
[43:03] man so we're supposed to render but not
[43:07] evil for
[43:09] evil so if somebody does evil to you you
[43:12] have no right to do evil back but ever
[43:15] follow that which is good Romans 12:17
[43:18] says recompense no man evil for
[43:21] evil Jesus taught us in Matthew Chapter
[43:24] 5 to do good to them that hate us and
[43:26] pray for them that despitefully use us
[43:28] and persecute us and bless them that
[43:31] curse
[43:33] us to Simply and always love our
[43:39] enemies I like this Romans 13:8 Romans
[43:43] 13:8 says oh no man
[43:51] anything oh no man anything and you know
[43:54] what we think about maybe in that aspect
[43:56] we think money right owe how much I owe
[43:59] you got to pay you
[44:01] back but doesn't talk about money here
[44:04] even though money is a part of anything
[44:07] but look what it says owe no man
[44:08] anything but to love one another so it's
[44:12] very easy to ow somebody
[44:15] love come
[44:16] on you know we just we don't feel we
[44:19] have to just you know love somebody
[44:21] because we don't want to ohe no man
[44:24] anything but to love one another for he
[44:26] that loves
[44:27] another have fulfilled the
[44:30] law so the love of God constrains us to
[44:35] labor to to to give back to others by
[44:40] loving them I don't want to be guilty of
[44:43] not loving
[44:45] somebody it don't cost any
[44:50] money now here's the thing more than
[44:52] likely when you love somebody it doesn't
[44:54] mean you're going to get love back fact
[44:56] you you may get some
[45:03] stabs but according to the scriptures
[45:05] that we read we owe it to everybody to
[45:08] love
[45:09] everybody Caesar
[45:12] everybody verse number six for for this
[45:16] cause pay ye tribute pay you tribute for
[45:21] they are God's ministers attending
[45:23] continually upon this very thing render
[45:25] therefore to all their du
[45:28] their
[45:29] dues
[45:31] tribute upon to whom tribute is due even
[45:36] a
[45:37] custom custom to whom custom Fear To
[45:41] whom fear and honor to whom
[45:45] honor I
[45:47] mean you think about God's ministers
[45:53] here but we really owe the fivefold
[45:55] ministry a lot
[45:57] they're the ones that bring us to
[46:03] Perfection so but often we just don't
[46:06] feel we owe them anymore than whatever
[46:11] we
[46:15] give did you know that we need to render
[46:18] forgiveness to
[46:21] others we in other words we owe
[46:24] forgiveness belongs to others
[46:29] now we're told to forgive stimes
[46:33] 70 and there's even a contingency upon
[46:37] us about being
[46:40] forgiven our prayers should not only
[46:42] include asking God for forgiveness for
[46:44] ourselves but for others Jesus said in
[46:47] Matthew 6:12 and and forgive us our
[46:51] debts as we forgive our
[46:54] debtors verse 15 but if you forgive not
[46:57] the men their trespasses neither will
[47:00] your father forgive your
[47:04] trespasses so the more evil that's done
[47:08] to me the more I'm in debt to
[47:12] forgive are you are you understanding
[47:15] what I'm
[47:21] saying and it's important that we
[47:23] forgive
[47:25] everybody that's the only way you can
[47:27] have confidence that God's going to
[47:28] forgive
[47:30] you if we don't render what belongs to
[47:34] others then God will not re render
[47:37] forgiveness to us think about that we
[47:40] need God to forgive us but it has
[47:41] everything to do with everybody that
[47:43] hates us everything that everything it
[47:45] has everything to do with what every the
[47:48] the wrong that people have done to us
[47:49] our forgiveness from God hinges on my
[47:53] attitude towards those that hate me
[47:56] think about what I'm saying saying here
[47:57] we want to make such a separation
[47:59] between God and other people and you
[48:06] can't Jesus said what you do to the
[48:08] least of these little ones you do unto
[48:13] me remember when Saul was persecu
[48:16] persecuting the church and and God Jesus
[48:20] met him on the road to Damascus and
[48:23] Jesus said why persecutest thou me
[48:27] but he was
[48:29] persecuting all the other
[48:32] people we don't realize that it's when
[48:34] you hurt somebody you're hurting God so
[48:38] what you do to somebody what you hold
[48:40] what you what you don't forgive you're
[48:42] you're actually doing it unto
[48:49] God God does not want us owing anything
[48:52] to anybody including Caesar render their
[48:56] unto Caesar the things that are Caesars
[48:59] and render therefore unto God the things
[49:02] that are
[49:05] Gods God wants us to render to him the
[49:10] things that belong to him I have a
[49:11] question for you what belongs to
[49:18] God how often have we ask the question
[49:21] what things do I have that belong to
[49:25] God what what do i p personally own in
[49:29] myself that really belongs to
[49:33] God a lot of people don't feel they owe
[49:36] God
[49:37] anything in other words they are debt
[49:41] free they may give you a scripture like
[49:43] this and it's a true scripture Jesus
[49:46] said if the sun therefore shall make you
[49:48] free you shall be free
[49:53] indeed but we will always be in debt to
[49:56] God
[49:58] love is always in dead if there's one
[50:01] Revelation I got this year it's that
[50:03] statement love is always
[50:06] indebted always and always will
[50:10] be Jesus said if someone asked you to go
[50:13] a mile you're in debt to go
[50:16] two if somebody smacks you on the cheek
[50:19] you're in debt to turn the other
[50:22] one see we're in debt more to God than
[50:25] what we realize
[50:28] Romans 8:11 tells us but if the spirit
[50:31] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[50:33] dead dwell in you he that raised up
[50:34] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[50:37] your mortal bodies by the spirit that
[50:38] dwelleth in you therefore brethren we
[50:41] are what
[50:43] debtors not to the flesh to live after
[50:47] the flesh we are debtors so there is to
[50:51] it now we want to live without feeling
[50:54] like we owe
[50:57] like like I don't want to ask somebody
[50:59] for something because I feel that I'm
[51:00] going to owe
[51:01] them I'm telling you wake up in the
[51:04] morning you're in
[51:05] debt you got breath in your lungs you
[51:08] got a beat in your heart God gave you
[51:09] another day you are in debt to God he
[51:13] forgave you of your sins he's covered
[51:15] you we're in debt to God we can't get
[51:18] away from it but the thing is we should
[51:21] want to we should want to be a
[51:25] servant second Corin Ians
[51:27] 5:14 says For the Love of Christ
[51:30] constrain us because we thus judge that
[51:33] if one died for all then we're all
[51:37] dead and that he died for all that they
[51:41] which live should not henceforth live
[51:44] unto
[51:46] themselves but unto him that died for
[51:48] them and rose again so here it is we
[51:50] we're not even allowed to live for
[51:53] ourself
[51:55] amen I mean before we became Christians
[51:58] we could just do what we want to
[52:01] do but when we we receive the salvation
[52:06] of God we're no longer to live unto
[52:09] ourselves anymore but unto
[52:13] God now why would God want us to
[52:16] remember the nail scars prince in his
[52:18] hand when we get to
[52:21] heaven God never wants us to forget the
[52:24] price that he paid for us
[52:27] and in remembering the sacrifice we will
[52:30] render him the praise that's due to his
[52:34] name but you know a lot of people
[52:37] forget what God had did for them if you
[52:41] ask them do you know about Calvary do
[52:43] you believe God died you they'll say yes
[52:45] but through the course of the day they
[52:47] don't even think about
[52:50] it 1 Peter chapter 1 tells us according
[52:53] as his divine power have given unto us
[52:55] all things that pertain
[52:56] unto life and godliness through the
[52:58] knowledge of him that have called us to
[53:01] glory and virtue Now where's the calling
[53:04] to he's called us out of the world and
[53:07] he's called us to glory and
[53:10] virtue that's what he's calling us
[53:13] to
[53:15] so we're told now in these following
[53:18] scriptures we've read these many times
[53:19] that we're to add to our faith virtue
[53:22] and knowledge and Temperance to add
[53:24] these things because that's what he's
[53:26] calling is too and that if we are adding
[53:30] them to our life if we're consciously
[53:33] trying to add them to our life then our
[53:37] life will never be Barren and unfruitful
[53:40] is that what the scripture
[53:42] says but verse eight says for if these
[53:46] things be in you and abound they make
[53:48] you that you should neither be Barren or
[53:49] fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[53:51] Jesus Christ but he that isn't even
[53:54] thinking about lacking he he that's not
[53:56] even even thinking about adding in other
[53:58] words you're just trying to get through
[54:00] the day trying to make money you know
[54:02] trying to build their build their future
[54:05] when they're not even thinking about
[54:07] adding the character of Christ to their
[54:10] life this is what happens but he that
[54:13] lath these things is blind and cannot
[54:17] see a far off and have forgotten that he
[54:21] was purged from his old sins
[54:26] God doesn't want that that's why the
[54:29] nail scars are going to be in there
[54:30] that's why when we get to heaven God
[54:32] does not want us to forget
[54:36] Calvary because it means more to us than
[54:39] what we
[54:41] realize a man can be so consumed with
[54:44] himself that he forgets what Christ did
[54:46] for
[54:49] him forget all the things that are
[54:51] supposed to be of God because if you
[54:54] forget Calvary you you forget the things
[54:56] that belong to
[54:58] God that's kind of why I wanted to go
[55:00] through that so what
[55:01] things do I have that belong to
[55:05] God I believe praise is one of
[55:09] them I like that we sung that song I
[55:11] will enter his Gates
[55:14] today all ye that have breath praise ye
[55:18] the Lord that's scripture that means I'm
[55:21] in debt to praise God you know sometimes
[55:23] we'll come to church and we don't feel
[55:25] like praising God
[55:29] sometimes we get up in the morning and
[55:30] we pray we don't feel like praising
[55:34] God
[55:36] sometimes we just don't have the
[55:40] feelings and it we don't need the
[55:42] feelings but we do need the faith we
[55:46] need the faith to praise God that he's
[55:49] truly worthy of all praise
[55:52] amen even the leaves the Bible tells us
[55:55] clap their hands
[55:58] we know God would have the
[56:00] Rocks the the lightning the
[56:03] Thunder even when Jesus was born nobody
[56:07] on Earth knew about it God sent out of
[56:09] Heaven angels to give him
[56:13] praise God really wants to be praised no
[56:17] brother BR you do anything too much but
[56:18] you can't pray too much but I'll say it
[56:21] like this I think we're really lacking
[56:23] on praising God
[56:27] praise today still belongs to him I
[56:31] don't know did brother Ron did you say
[56:32] something like Annie up did you say
[56:35] something like that I say we need to pay
[56:37] up we need to pay up on praising
[56:41] God Hebrews 13:15 says by him therefore
[56:46] let us offer the sacrifice of praise to
[56:51] God continually right I don't know what
[56:54] that means to you but if I am sure if I
[56:57] ask you do do you do you I'm gonna pick
[57:00] on sister Lori for a second oh no don't
[57:02] do this this is an easy
[57:04] one sister Lori do you breathe
[57:08] continually
[57:11] yes if we did not breathe continually we
[57:14] would
[57:15] die but do we praise God
[57:19] continually we owe God we owe God praise
[57:23] this whole thing is about stirring us up
[57:25] to give God what is
[57:27] God's we want to give our home this we
[57:30] want to build this and God's house goes
[57:32] empty we don't want to reach out to
[57:34] another soul but we're consumed about
[57:36] our
[57:37] lives we owe God Amen the world ain't
[57:41] going to give God what belongs to him if
[57:43] it ain't coming from us he ain't going
[57:45] to get
[57:46] it that is the fruit of our
[57:49] lips not getting upset not
[57:53] swearing not lying the fruit of our lips
[57:58] giving thanks to his
[58:00] name but to do good now look at this and
[58:02] to communicate forget not God does not
[58:05] want us to forget about communicating
[58:07] praise to him but you know what helps us
[58:10] to forget I had such a hard day right
[58:14] you know I am so busy in fact I just as
[58:17] soon as I'm out of here I'm back to
[58:24] work you know there's going to be more
[58:26] more praise next
[58:30] Sunday for a pig skin ball flying in the
[58:39] air more money
[58:42] given than the offerings in the church
[58:44] that
[58:46] day and it's going to be a big
[58:53] thing I believe God wants to see his
[58:55] children
[58:56] communicate praise to him I believe that
[58:59] with all my heart for with such
[59:01] sacrifices God is well please he knows
[59:05] it's a
[59:06] sacrifice our flesh don't want to do it
[59:09] our flesh does not want to do
[59:11] it how many times you not really wanted
[59:13] to pray but you got down there
[59:17] anyways and if you stayed there long
[59:19] enough till his presence come you were
[59:23] happy yeah and and and this is all I
[59:26] want to say is is don't go by what you
[59:30] feel go by what you
[59:33] believe if you believe God is worthy
[59:35] praise him if you go by what you're
[59:37] feeling you're going to feel oh I'm a
[59:39] I'm unworthy I'm a hypocrite and I don't

[1:03:25] dad

[1:07:46] unto his name I like that it's

[1:08:35] stop why are we why are we letting the
[1:08:37] devil stop us from praising God why do
[1:08:40] we do that we got to get out of the
[1:08:42] flesh get into the spirit I would rather
[1:08:45] just praise God and not feel like it
[1:08:48] than wait to try to feel like it okay
[1:08:50] come on song leader get me to feel like
[1:08:51] it come on preacher make me feel like it
[1:08:53] and then I'll do it what what is that
[1:08:57] what is
[1:09:00] that it's not a
[1:09:02] sacrifice it's not by
[1:09:05] faith it's you being too proud that's
[1:09:08] exactly what that you want to know why
[1:09:09] people don't praise the Lord because
[1:09:11] they're too proud
[1:09:12] too it's it's a truth there's too much
[1:09:16] pride Revelations 4:11 Thou Art Worthy
[1:09:20] oh Lord to receive glory and honor and
[1:09:24] power for thou has created all things
[1:09:25] and for thy pleasure they were I are and
[1:09:29] were
[1:09:32] created and so this is in Revelations
[1:09:35] the last book in the Bible revelations
[1:09:37] 511 and behold I heard the voice of many
[1:09:41] angels round about the throne and the
[1:09:42] Beast and the elders and the number of
[1:09:44] them were was 10,000 times 10,000 and
[1:09:48] thousands of thousands in other words
[1:09:51] try to put a number to it right saying
[1:09:54] with a loud voice voice Worthy is the
[1:09:58] Lamb that was slain to receive power and
[1:10:01] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:10:03] and glory and blessing so think about
[1:10:06] all these angels that God has created to
[1:10:11] worship
[1:10:14] him because he went and died for us at
[1:10:18] Calvary and we sit here and have a hard
[1:10:21] time mustering up enough love to give to
[1:10:24] Jesus amen what is going
[1:10:28] on I mean we owe we owe big time give
[1:10:32] unto Caesars what Caesars but give unto
[1:10:34] God what's
[1:10:37] God's and every creature which is in
[1:10:40] heaven and on Earth and under the Earth
[1:10:43] and such as are in the sea and all that
[1:10:46] are in them heard I saying blessing and
[1:10:50] honor and glory and power be unto that
[1:10:52] to him that sth upon the throne and unto
[1:10:55] the lamb forever and ever that means
[1:10:59] right
[1:11:02] now and when you die I mean there's you
[1:11:05] know brother Bram said it like this if
[1:11:07] you don't if you don't like praising God
[1:11:09] right now if you you don't like this
[1:11:11] getting excited and praising God now
[1:11:13] you're going to feel uncomfortable in
[1:11:14] heaven he
[1:11:15] said you might well just get used to it
[1:11:18] just get the old Boogie woggies out of
[1:11:20] you get them out of you get them out of
[1:11:22] your head get them out of your mind
[1:11:24] praise prise God Amen Revelations 191
[1:11:28] and after these things I heard a great
[1:11:30] voice of much people and you know what
[1:11:34] they were in heaven saying
[1:11:37] Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor
[1:11:40] and power unto the Lord Our God that's
[1:11:44] what's going to be
[1:11:45] happening we might as well get started
[1:11:47] here when's the last time you said
[1:11:51] hallelujah amen when the last time he
[1:11:53] said power unto Jesus
[1:11:56] and we we we sing there's power in the
[1:11:58] blood because it's our benefit right we
[1:12:02] get benefited from that but what about
[1:12:03] just giving God praise for that power
[1:12:07] amen all right what else Belongs to the
[1:12:12] Lord yes we're going to talk about
[1:12:17] offerings offerings belong to
[1:12:20] God Malachi 3: 6 and so this might after
[1:12:25] we get done with these scriptures this
[1:12:26] might be a perfect time to take up an
[1:12:30] offering for I am the
[1:12:33] Lord I change not notice that I got that
[1:12:36] underlined I am the Lord I change not so
[1:12:39] I I want us to remember this that he
[1:12:42] doesn't change here therefore ye sons of
[1:12:45] Jacob are not
[1:12:47] consumed even from the days of your
[1:12:49] fathers ye are gone away from my
[1:12:52] ordinances and have not kept them
[1:12:55] return unto me and I will return unto
[1:12:58] you sayeth the Lord of hosts but you say
[1:13:01] wherein shall we return in other words
[1:13:03] they feel that they've already been here
[1:13:05] just like Leo deia I'm in need of
[1:13:07] nothing I'm
[1:13:09] here he said will a man rob God I don't
[1:13:13] think
[1:13:17] so yet you have robbed
[1:13:21] me but you say wherein have we robbed
[1:13:25] the Real playing in
[1:13:28] ties and in offerings they're two
[1:13:30] different now ties and
[1:13:34] offerings that we literally Rob God he
[1:13:37] owns a cattle in a thousand years he
[1:13:39] made all the gold he's the one that's
[1:13:42] brought value to
[1:13:45] everything but yet we rob god of what
[1:13:48] belongs to
[1:13:50] him not just a tenth of your ties but
[1:13:54] all
[1:13:57] offerings what about the lights what
[1:14:00] about the visiting ministers that we got
[1:14:02] to pay a hotel for what about the
[1:14:04] missionaries that we support overseas
[1:14:06] the Bibles we said and all what about
[1:14:09] all that are you behind
[1:14:13] that then have a burden give to that
[1:14:16] because we literally oh God we got
[1:14:19] scripture right here that we're robing
[1:14:21] something that actually belongs to God
[1:14:26] verse N9 you're
[1:14:27] cursed I don't want that you're cursed
[1:14:31] with a curse for you have robbed me even
[1:14:35] this whole
[1:14:37] nation here's the remedy for the curse
[1:14:41] bring ye all the tithes into the
[1:14:45] storehouse that there may be meat in my
[1:14:48] house and prove me now wherewith sayeth
[1:14:51] the Lord of hosts if I will not open the
[1:14:53] windows of heaven and pour out a
[1:14:55] blessing out I pour you out a blessing
[1:14:59] that there shall not be room enough to
[1:15:02] receive
[1:15:04] it wow I that that to me if I was
[1:15:08] struggling in my life financially that
[1:15:11] promise I would hang on to and that is
[1:15:14] such a small price to pay you pay a
[1:15:17] little bit to have all your needs taken
[1:15:20] care
[1:15:20] of in fact not just your needs taken
[1:15:23] care of but says you'll get a blessing
[1:15:26] they won't even have room enough to
[1:15:28] contain
[1:15:31] it there's no Switzerland with God as
[1:15:34] I've often
[1:15:38] said you're either in line with the word
[1:15:42] or you're robbing
[1:15:45] them so offerings belong to God as well
[1:15:49] John 10:7 then Jesus said unto them
[1:15:52] again verily verily I say unto you I am
[1:15:54] the door of the Sheep all that ever came
[1:15:55] before me are thieves and
[1:16:01] robbers but the Sheep did not hear
[1:16:05] them in other words you you hang out
[1:16:08] with somebody that don't pay their
[1:16:10] ties I mean real sheep ain't G to pull
[1:16:13] bite into that stuff not going to do it
[1:16:17] oh you don't got to do this and you
[1:16:18] don't got to go to church and you don't
[1:16:19] got to be faithful here you don't got to
[1:16:21] do that
[1:16:27] in other words theves and robbers if
[1:16:29] somebody came over and they they stole
[1:16:31] something out of your
[1:16:32] house they stole that belong to
[1:16:37] God I work for
[1:16:44] it people go years and they never get
[1:16:48] that Revelation you wonder why they
[1:16:49] don't get it they don't want the
[1:16:51] revelation
[1:16:55] don't want the
[1:16:56] responsibility of having to give God
[1:17:00] what belongs to God they rather be
[1:17:03] selfish and God looks at those people as
[1:17:05] being thieves and robbers in other words
[1:17:08] they want God's blessing they want to
[1:17:10] pray they want to got to count on it
[1:17:11] that God's going to be there meet their
[1:17:13] needs but they're not really worried
[1:17:16] about what ow
[1:17:21] God God is a giver
[1:17:26] but that doesn't mean that God wants a
[1:17:28] selfish
[1:17:29] bride he wants a bride that's a giver
[1:17:32] and God loves a cheerful Giver so what
[1:17:35] belongs to
[1:17:38] God we belong to
[1:17:40] God our heart belongs to God our life
[1:17:44] belongs to
[1:17:45] God Calvary didn't just buy our
[1:17:48] Salvation it purchased us it purchased
[1:17:51] our life it purchased our
[1:17:53] will First Corinthians Ians 620 says for
[1:17:56] you are bought with a price therefore
[1:17:58] glorify God in your body and in your
[1:18:00] spirit which are
[1:18:04] Gods
[1:18:07] so all these decisions that you're
[1:18:09] making about what you want to do and
[1:18:13] what you're not going to do when the
[1:18:14] word tells you
[1:18:16] plainly what you should be
[1:18:19] doing you do understand your make your
[1:18:22] life your life is making a declaration
[1:18:25] that you are not bought by
[1:18:29] Christ it's one thing to be stubborn
[1:18:32] rebellious fall make mistakes it's
[1:18:34] another thing to say no what I've not
[1:18:37] given my life to
[1:18:40] Christ if we're all bought by Christ
[1:18:44] then we all belong to Christ that's why
[1:18:47] we don't say I'm going to do this I'm
[1:18:48] going to do
[1:18:50] that in fact it's evil it's a sin we
[1:18:53] should never say that we should say the
[1:18:55] Lord willing we're gonna go here we're
[1:18:57] going to do this we're going to do
[1:19:00] that why because we now God has bought
[1:19:04] our
[1:19:05] will he's bought our
[1:19:11] life Deuteronomy 65 says and thou shalt
[1:19:15] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[1:19:17] with all thy soul with all thy
[1:19:18] might and these words which I command
[1:19:21] thee this day shall be in thine heart
[1:19:25] Thou shalt teach them so I say to the
[1:19:28] parents today with
[1:19:30] children teach them diligently unto thy
[1:19:35] children talk with them when thou sest
[1:19:38] in thine house and when thou Drive in
[1:19:41] the car and walk in the way when th go
[1:19:43] to bed and when thou get up in the
[1:19:46] morning talk about the love of God that
[1:19:49] we should love the Lord with all our
[1:19:52] heart Thou shalt bind them for a sign
[1:19:54] upon thy hand there shall be frontlets
[1:19:56] between thy eyes in other words parents
[1:19:59] when our kids look at
[1:20:01] us you should
[1:20:03] be wanting them to see the love of God
[1:20:06] when they look at you not something
[1:20:10] scary not something that you know
[1:20:14] they're frightened of intimidated
[1:20:18] by but they should be to see the love of
[1:20:20] God and thou shalt write them upon the
[1:20:22] post of thine house now they Gates our
[1:20:27] love and our affection belongs to
[1:20:30] God our love and our affection
[1:20:32] Colossians 32 says set your affections
[1:20:34] on things above not on things of the
[1:20:37] earth
[1:20:39] amen do you know the word saved
[1:20:42] us in the beginning was the word the
[1:20:45] word was with God the Word was God verse
