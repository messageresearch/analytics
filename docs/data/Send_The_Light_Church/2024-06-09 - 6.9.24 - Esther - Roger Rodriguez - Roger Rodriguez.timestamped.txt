[39:49] gospel but there's a group of young
[39:52] men that are seeking of God
[39:57] so I very I was very happy
[40:01] yesterday because my work in Venezuela I
[40:04] worked with the
[40:06] youth we had about 100 youth
[40:10] there and you know at the age of 11 and
[40:14] and and
[40:17] 20 so it was a because this was a big
[40:19] church I went
[40:22] to so when I got there to that uh youth
[40:26] meetings yes
[40:30] so it was two grandpas talking to young
[40:35] people because I'm a
[40:38] grandpa I've been a grandpa now for four
[40:42] months and it's a very different
[40:49] experience I have a little
[40:54] granddaughter she's uh half Spanish and
[40:57] have
[41:02] American my son married a a American
[41:09] sister he always liked them
[41:11] blonde that he was a young
[41:14] [Music]
[41:15] man and she always like the the
[41:20] Hispanic so they when they saw each
[41:22] other was L at First
[41:25] Sight and two years later they got
[41:29] married and two years after they got
[41:33] married now we have a little beautiful
[41:37] granddaughter we're very
[41:41] happy and now he knows what that
[41:44] is so we're gonna
[41:49] read we're going to read from Esther
[41:51] chapter 1 and verse 19
[41:58] before we we read the word we're going
[41:59] to go to the author of the word and pray
[42:03] Lord
[42:05] Jesus we grateful for your presence and
[42:08] your your how good that you are to
[42:11] us we need your your that you accompany
[42:14] us
[42:15] today so we give our lives to you and
[42:22] now we put our own being aside
[42:28] and you can use us any way that you wish
[42:32] to we want to speak what you want us to
[42:36] speak so be with us
[42:39] Lord there's a people here that are
[42:44] hungry and we want to be the waiters
[42:47] this
[42:48] morning we want you to be the
[42:51] chef you fix something already in the
[42:56] kitchen so we're bringing it from the
[42:59] kitchen to their
[43:00] table in the name of the Lord Jesus
[43:03] Christ we thank you
[43:07] Lord
[43:11] sorry we're GNA read this verse and
[43:18] Esther we know when King hasah
[43:23] heris we know that he was a great king
[43:28] he was in the med he between the media
[43:30] and the
[43:31] Persians and he made a great
[43:34] feast and he made his f for many
[43:38] days and in the six
[43:43] days in that or number seventh
[43:46] day he was very
[43:50] happy the wine made him very
[43:54] happy so he sent for his Queen
[44:02] Queen he called for his Queen to show
[44:05] him to his other his
[44:09] princesses and he wanted to show her off
[44:11] to the
[44:15] governors now the queen
[44:19] vashti she didn't want to come to the
[44:21] presence of the king
[44:25] [Music]
[44:30] so the king stopped her for being
[44:35] Queen so when we read verse
[44:42] 19 now we know that there was a federal
[44:44] order from the
[44:48] government now verse 19
[44:51] says but but it seems good to the king
[44:58] make a Royal
[45:02] Decree and write it between the the
[45:04] writings of
[45:06] Persia so it will not be
[45:09] broken the
[45:12] Vash will not come anymore before the
[45:17] king and that the king will make a Queen
[45:21] instead of Vy another queen amen may be
[45:25] seated
[45:34] we know that this is the story of that
[45:37] [Music]
[45:39] Kingdom now when you read the book of
[45:42] [Music]
[45:44] Esther is it like brings you to
[45:52] curiosity because the the the book is
[45:55] has a certain point
[45:59] Amen in between the historical
[46:03] books and the poetic
[46:06] books and it's right in the middle of
[46:10] that now we're speaking about a
[46:13] queen okay two
[46:16] queens a queen which was
[46:21] beautiful she had greatness
[46:27] because the King was very uh proud of
[46:35] Vash because he wanted to bring her to
[46:37] show her off in front of the other
[46:41] Governors because he saw her his wife or
[46:44] the queen very
[46:46] perfect he saw her very
[46:51] beautiful because she was a
[46:53] representation of the Kingdom
[46:59] like a a a royal
[47:04] reality now you can imagine that
[47:10] Queen and your own mind goes to the
[47:14] universe or beyond the
[47:19] world and those beautiful
[47:24] places and that you find in today you
[47:27] know Miss Miss Universe and Miss World
[47:30] yeah Miss Universe and Miss
[47:35] World because those certain
[47:38] Beauties those those
[47:41] uh computations of
[47:44] [Music]
[47:47] beauty will bring us to that point in
[47:49] this story
[47:52] here that the King was showing off his
[47:54] Queen
[47:59] so you in your mind you say wa she was a
[48:01] beautiful
[48:02] woman and a woman that was very well
[48:07] prepared and perhaps when when she would
[48:11] speak she would had good
[48:16] character perhaps she was she just
[48:17] didn't have a pretty
[48:20] face perhaps she had preparations of uh
[48:25] uh Beauty
[48:29] perhaps she was very
[48:31] educated she had
[48:37] degrees she was just not any kind of
[48:42] woman because when she would speak she
[48:45] would she would represent his King her
[48:48] King she would demonstrate what the King
[48:53] was and what the kingdom was
[48:58] so they called for her to
[49:00] come she did not want to
[49:04] come so there you saw that she had a
[49:06] little
[49:08] spot a little
[49:13] fault she thought she was bigger than
[49:16] the king
[49:19] [Music]
[49:29] she she was trying to demonstrate that
[49:30] she was higher high higher
[49:33] up let him wait for me I'm
[49:39] busy I'm in my own
[49:42] way I don't want to
[49:45] go I woke up
[49:47] [Laughter]
[49:52] grumpy so she didn't want to come before
[49:54] the king
[49:58] now if we see the story very
[50:01] well we know that she was very busy
[50:04] too because she was having she was
[50:07] having Banquets and and
[50:11] feast because she was having Feast for
[50:14] King for the other uh queens and and and
[50:17] princess of the
[50:20] governors so she was also attending the
[50:23] feminine part of the of the feast
[50:26] know that she was
[50:30] busy you know when our wives are busy at
[50:34] home and you want to bring her some kind
[50:37] of
[50:37] news you know what
[50:39] happens I don't even have to tell
[50:42] you you know what
[50:45] happens my wife is busy doing something
[50:49] fixing and
[50:51] cooking and you want to come and bring
[50:53] in a joke or
[50:55] something and you're going to get yelled
[50:58] at that's going to be the way it
[51:01] is because she's
[51:05] busy so they're thinking about organiz
[51:08] organizing this taking care of
[51:11] this if you went and and make
[51:15] groceries and you brought boxes of
[51:18] food she's taking care of put them in
[51:21] the
[51:22] cabinets put in the new things in the in
[51:24] the back
[51:27] and the things that are older to the
[51:30] front and fixing the
[51:34] refrigerator and you come and you want
[51:37] to tell hey I want to I want to change
[51:39] uh
[51:40] cars she doesn't want to hear nothing
[51:42] about you changing
[51:45] cars she wants you to help or put away
[51:48] groceries and that's the way this queen
[51:53] was so the king sent for V
[51:57] perhaps she was she was uh organizing
[52:00] the Banquets and didn't care of this
[52:02] those that were
[52:05] serving she did not want to come to the
[52:08] presence of the
[52:13] king because she wasn't willing
[52:20] to now we know that the king went to to
[52:24] get another queen
[52:27] amen now we come to this very solemn
[52:32] point she's put
[52:38] away
[52:39] [Music]
[52:41] so now the king starts like a trying get
[52:45] himself a new
[52:51] wife perhap someone that have all the
[52:53] characteristics of vashti
[52:58] did not have that effect that Vash
[53:03] demonstrated that she would be willing
[53:05] to come to the presence of the king any
[53:07] time that he would ask for
[53:10] her so the the king started
[53:15] seeking he sent Messengers all over the
[53:20] kingdom hey the king is looking for a
[53:22] new
[53:24] Queen and there was Messengers all over
[53:28] we're looking a new for a new Queen for
[53:30] the
[53:32] king if you find find yourself in a good
[53:34] condition
[53:37] come so there was a a organized a group
[53:41] of those that were going to take care of
[53:47] them so they were going to bring these
[53:50] virgins they were candidates to be a
[53:54] queen and they were going to bring it to
[53:56] to a specific
[53:58] place to begin to train
[54:06] them and to tell them how the king likes
[54:09] things
[54:11] done so that training began to happen
[54:27] so these men they were
[54:30] selected these men were picked
[54:36] specially these men could not have their
[54:38] Unix they couldn't have their own
[54:43] seed they were picked
[54:48] physically they were not able to touch
[54:50] these virgins
[54:59] these men will come and and present to
[55:01] them the spirit of the
[55:03] king and the way that the king acted the
[55:05] way that he
[55:08] was and what the king
[55:13] liked and how the king likes things to
[55:16] be
[55:23] done they were going to show them how
[55:25] the king would like them to to act or
[55:28] you know behave
[55:30] themselves they were going to teach
[55:34] them how to dress before the
[55:38] king and the way that that she walked
[55:40] before the
[55:43] king and how the king liked the way they
[55:49] cooked and how the king liked the way
[55:51] they for them to do
[55:52] things it was a training they were going
[55:54] to go through
[55:57] so they had to take care of
[55:59] them and they had to uh give him beauty
[56:05] treatments and to get him
[56:07] ready in in every
[56:10] aspect she was going to be the
[56:13] queen she was going to be the most
[56:15] important woman in the
[56:21] Kingdom months went by during that
[56:25] training so now we know here comes
[56:29] Esther she was of the descendants of
[56:34] [Music]
[56:35] Israel and we know that the kingdom ofer
[56:38] was not
[56:40] Israelites it was a gentile
[56:43] Kingdom there was paganism
[56:50] there they believed in all kind of
[56:53] different uh customs
[56:55] [Music]
[56:58] so she had to be trained so she can
[57:00] please the
[57:03] king so we know that she was very
[57:08] beautiful and as beautiful as
[57:12] vashi but she was not
[57:17] trained so this
[57:20] Unix they were training this
[57:24] woman they were doing this
[57:28] work and
[57:32] today we know that there's Unix that are
[57:34] doing that work
[57:36] today in the
[57:38] churches the
[57:42] pastors they are doing the work the the
[57:44] the work of a
[57:49] unic they're transmitting to the chosen
[57:52] of God
[57:56] because God's been choosing a
[58:00] bride so he can he can uh be be engaged
[58:05] to God wants to get
[58:07] [Applause]
[58:08] married with a a a
[58:12] lady that's very well trained by the
[58:18] Unix so we have Unix behind this
[58:21] Pulpit they're
[58:23] trying to teach you to teach his
[58:29] girl look what God wants them to
[58:32] do now
[58:35] remember the Unix in the Old
[58:39] Testament they
[58:41] were they were
[58:45] modified so they would not have seed of
[58:47] their
[58:49] own they could
[58:53] not plant in that girl
[58:58] their
[58:59] seed because they didn't have
[59:03] any so we
[59:06] need that the Unix of
[59:09] today do not plant your own
[59:13] seed but for that BR that girl that's
[59:16] chosen by God that
[59:21] lady that God is showing through the
[59:23] Unix
[59:27] so she can be
[59:28] prepared for a
[59:33] wedding
[59:36] am
[59:41] today the Lord is Seeking a
[59:44] bride the Lord wants to get
[59:48] married but we know that this bride is
[59:51] very
[59:52] particular because this bride
[59:57] she's going to demonstrate a certain
[1:00:01] being or way that she is that no other
[1:00:04] candidate
[1:00:06] has there's many
[1:00:10] candidates because Esther had to compete
[1:00:13] with many
[1:00:14] thousands can you
[1:00:17] imagine thousands of
[1:00:20] women beautiful
[1:00:22] young
[1:00:24] virgins wanted to be
[1:00:32] Queen and that was a lot of work for the
[1:00:36] Unix how would that that move movement
[1:00:39] must have
[1:00:41] been give him food to the women all the
[1:00:44] time where to sleep where to
[1:00:49] bathe don't where to get them
[1:00:52] ready and how to they had to learn how
[1:00:54] to walk before the king
[1:00:57] and even learn how to comb their own
[1:01:00] [Music]
[1:01:01] hair they had to learn to do their own
[1:01:08] things so we have a God that's
[1:01:13] preparing a group of
[1:01:16] Unix they are doing that kind of a work
[1:01:20] today it's a logically it's a spiritual
[1:01:23] work
[1:01:26] [Music]
[1:01:27] we got men that have good
[1:01:30] caliber and doing the work of
[1:01:33] preparation and doing the work of a
[1:01:38] unic but sometimes you know that someone
[1:01:41] gets behind
[1:01:43] sometimes and sometime there was one
[1:01:45] that was not a unic and get in
[1:01:48] there and he finished having a
[1:01:54] scandal bringing a problem
[1:01:58] there was a notice that came
[1:02:01] out he put a seed that he was supposed
[1:02:03] to
[1:02:05] put because that process of
[1:02:09] months because that young
[1:02:12] woman the chosen
[1:02:15] one the one that would come to the to
[1:02:18] the end of the
[1:02:21] competition had would had to be proven
[1:02:23] proven in all aspects
[1:02:27] she could not bring a hidden seed from
[1:02:30] somebody
[1:02:31] else because months would go
[1:02:38] by that she would not be get pregnant in
[1:02:44] hiding so they haven't they haven't they
[1:02:46] haven't enclosed nobody could get to
[1:02:54] them perhaps that the Lord hasn't come
[1:02:59] yet waiting for his
[1:03:01] bride is chosen and P and
[1:03:05] sealed and not bring and bring the wrong
[1:03:08] seed she's not supposed to bring for
[1:03:13] it that the Bible says when the husband
[1:03:16] was coming in
[1:03:18] late all the virgins fell asleep
[1:03:27] and that's going to
[1:03:29] happen and perhaps it's happening
[1:03:33] today but there's some
[1:03:36] Unix they're always
[1:03:38] watching don't fall asleep wake
[1:03:42] up oh your eyes are
[1:03:48] closing oh look at look the the the
[1:03:51] husband he he's
[1:03:53] coming put your ear hear the
[1:03:57] call because there going to be a trumpet
[1:03:59] coming
[1:04:01] sounding and you can hear the wheels uh
[1:04:05] turning be
[1:04:08] ready and the Bri and all the virgins
[1:04:10] are
[1:04:12] tired and the Unix are hitting them
[1:04:14] trying to wake them up hey hey wake
[1:04:17] up don't don't don't don't lose your
[1:04:20] step stay in step
[1:04:26] and that is the work of the
[1:04:31] Unix to keep those
[1:04:35] virgins
[1:04:37] alert so they can go into the into into
[1:04:40] the the
[1:04:43] wedding but you know what the most
[1:04:45] beautiful thing
[1:04:51] is seeing that the process of election
[1:04:54] is being given
[1:05:00] they're still seeking new girls or
[1:05:03] [Music]
[1:05:06] Maids perhaps you heard oh that
[1:05:11] message God wants somebody to
[1:05:16] marry the the husband is looking for a
[1:05:20] wife perhaps you you felt that call in
[1:05:22] your
[1:05:23] heart and perhaps you put breaks some
[1:05:26] for a
[1:05:28] minute but today is a good day to hear
[1:05:30] the
[1:05:32] call and to accept that
[1:05:35] invitation because Lord still looking
[1:05:38] for someone to
[1:05:41] marry we are in that
[1:05:44] process seeking
[1:05:47] preparation
[1:05:49] election because the
[1:05:53] Lord because the Lord wants to see his
[1:05:55] people
[1:05:57] and his people are his
[1:06:00] bride we we we speak in
[1:06:05] type because the people of God is the
[1:06:10] bride and the bride that the Lord is in
[1:06:13] is
[1:06:15] training and
[1:06:17] yet that people are
[1:06:21] uniting because there are virgins that
[1:06:23] are waking up
[1:06:26] and the people of God keep
[1:06:28] growing until that last one comes
[1:06:31] in the bride is not going to be
[1:06:35] completed and when she's
[1:06:37] completed it's when the bridegroom
[1:06:42] comes the election of the
[1:06:46] Bride it doesn't give it doesn't come at
[1:06:49] the
[1:06:54] end not until all the girls are well
[1:06:58] trained and there come a
[1:07:01] time when the
[1:07:04] Unix and the the the main principal
[1:07:07] Prince of the
[1:07:10] Unix and he would come to the king and
[1:07:12] said hey everything's
[1:07:15] ready all the girls are already well
[1:07:19] trained they know everything
[1:07:25] and we T we taught them everything you
[1:07:27] want us to teach
[1:07:30] them so that now is the final election
[1:07:34] the
[1:07:37] election so the one that had the last
[1:07:39] word was the
[1:07:42] king now the king came forward and
[1:07:44] started looking at
[1:07:46] them perhaps he saw them
[1:07:49] walking oh perhaps you seen him
[1:07:54] praying and looking at their Bible and
[1:07:58] reading so the
[1:08:00] King was the one that's going to change
[1:08:04] uh get his bride the
[1:08:09] queen perhaps the the king had many
[1:08:14] wives but to him there was one special
[1:08:18] one which would be the
[1:08:21] queen and so this morning
[1:08:28] we're speaking to that special
[1:08:31] one that chosen
[1:08:34] one which is the only
[1:08:40] one and she's the only one that's going
[1:08:42] to take that place on the
[1:08:45] throne the king
[1:08:48] yeras he wanted you to
[1:08:52] come and dress with that chronis
[1:08:56] Splender she didn't want to
[1:08:59] come we know there's a special
[1:09:03] Crown when she's going to present
[1:09:05] herself before the
[1:09:08] king when she's in her daily
[1:09:11] activities she has she wears another
[1:09:13] type of
[1:09:15] crown but when she comes in the presence
[1:09:18] of the
[1:09:19] king she has to use the main crown
[1:09:25] and the King wanted to present her with
[1:09:27] that
[1:09:35] crown and that would show that Crown
[1:09:37] would show that she was the the the the
[1:09:39] the queen of the
[1:09:42] king no one else could wear that that
[1:09:48] crown and that Crown was not uh made
[1:09:50] late
[1:09:52] before it was personalized
[1:09:56] they would they would come and measure
[1:09:58] her
[1:09:59] head with the form of her
[1:10:03] skull once they placed that crown on her
[1:10:08] head she couldn't walk around holding on
[1:10:10] the to the
[1:10:13] crown it had to be placed just
[1:10:16] right she had to
[1:10:19] walk and that Crown could not move to
[1:10:21] any to any
[1:10:23] side because it had to be a
[1:10:27] personalized especially made for her
[1:10:29] that
[1:10:30] woman
[1:10:34] amen now
[1:10:38] today the Lord knows who his wife
[1:10:43] is and he's making he's making that
[1:10:46] personalizing that
[1:10:48] Crown he's personing that Crown
[1:10:51] himself the day will
[1:10:54] come of the
[1:10:57] coronation and that beloved of his will
[1:11:00] be
[1:11:02] there and that
[1:11:05] act well they're place that Crown our
[1:11:08] head and there we will
[1:11:12] be we're going to be that
[1:11:15] Queen chosen of
[1:11:20] God and that Crown is going to fit on
[1:11:23] head perfectly
[1:11:25] and it's going to appear in the head of
[1:11:27] that
[1:11:30] bride because the Lord got her already
[1:11:34] Chosen and they just preparing the final
[1:11:39] details and preparing the adornments on
[1:11:42] the
[1:11:50] dresses year before that it was just
[1:11:52] like a a natural comp competition
[1:11:59] that is a a spiritual
[1:12:02] competition a spiritual
[1:12:07] [Music]
[1:12:09] competition before before they would put
[1:12:12] all kinds of you know perfumes and all
[1:12:15] kinds of things on
[1:12:16] them they would fix their hair and their
[1:12:20] nails but
[1:12:22] today it's a spiritual application
[1:12:27] because God the Lord is preparing the
[1:12:29] character that
[1:12:33] bride or that chosen
[1:12:36] Queen and that's what we're doing
[1:12:40] today in that final run race of
[1:12:45] details oh the dress needs a little
[1:12:48] Stone
[1:12:50] here oh look there's a little thread
[1:12:53] hanging
[1:12:55] so those small
[1:12:59] details those little final
[1:13:04] touches now you know when when someone
[1:13:07] the sculptures the the uh the work of
[1:13:11] art they take a giant piece of
[1:13:15] marble and they start they start hitting
[1:13:17] and knocking out pieces of that
[1:13:20] marble and they start with big chisels
[1:13:26] and now once that marble starts taking
[1:13:31] form now you they're using the smaller
[1:13:36] chisels smaller
[1:13:39] ones and more
[1:13:45] delicate because it's giv form to the
[1:13:48] little smaller details
[1:13:56] let's say they're making the the face of
[1:13:58] of of a man and they they're you looking
[1:14:00] at their
[1:14:02] wrinkles well they can't use a big
[1:14:03] chisel to do that so he can cut off the
[1:14:10] nose so they're using very uh small
[1:14:13] details little small
[1:14:15] tools and perhaps maybe something out of
[1:14:20] rubber and perhaps maybe a little piece
[1:14:22] like nails and those little final
[1:14:27] details so we can compare this final
[1:14:31] bride like a like a
[1:14:36] masterpiece that is been uh finishing
[1:14:39] the work has been
[1:14:43] finishing so now we see this culture we
[1:14:46] saw this scultpture
[1:14:48] we see the
[1:14:50] artist and making those final details
[1:14:56] some people have seen the statue of
[1:15:01] Moses they see even the the the veins
[1:15:04] popping out of Moses's arm and they see
[1:15:06] the
[1:15:11] wrinkles when they make this they see
[1:15:13] the statue of
[1:15:17] David
[1:15:19] Mel but you see that in that statue
[1:15:22] there are very many fine details
[1:15:27] even the the the drops of sweat up
[1:15:30] here because they see all little
[1:15:35] detail you can even see the the
[1:15:38] ve like if you if you would stand there
[1:15:40] in front you
[1:15:43] alive that's why Michelangelo hit that
[1:15:46] the knee and says
[1:15:48] speak because he saw that before so
[1:15:51] [Music]
[1:15:52] perfect and he
[1:15:55] his and he hit that
[1:15:59] knee and in that moment our greatest
[1:16:01] sculpture is with
[1:16:03] us and he's making those final details
[1:16:05] for
[1:16:07] us because he wants to see us in
[1:16:11] Perfection be you
[1:16:13] perfect even as your father is
[1:16:18] perfect and we know that we're not in
[1:16:20] that perfection
[1:16:26] oh we see we see ourselves so
[1:16:30] twisted and we see ourselves with so
[1:16:32] much so many
[1:16:34] defects but when the Lord sees
[1:16:37] you he doesn't see you as you see
[1:16:42] yourself he see you through different to
[1:16:44] some different
[1:16:46] lens and that lens is the blood of
[1:16:50] Jesus so he through those he see you
[1:16:52] through those red
[1:16:53] lens sees you
[1:16:57] perfect he doesn't see that you have any
[1:17:00] stain he doesn't see any
[1:17:03] wrinkles because that
[1:17:06] blood is standing before
[1:17:11] you that and and having made the Lord
[1:17:13] see you
[1:17:16] perfect and that was the the value of
[1:17:19] the sacrifice at Calvary at the
[1:17:22] cross but better than that
[1:17:25] sacrifice was the
[1:17:28] resurrection that mon that Sunday
[1:17:32] morning the resurrection
[1:17:40] marked it's like when you go to a store
[1:17:42] and you take the receipt that you bought
[1:17:45] something you take it back to the
[1:17:47] store and we know that the the payment
[1:17:50] was made at Calvary
[1:17:56] like when you pay when you pay your uh a
[1:17:58] bill by
[1:18:02] internet I'm GNA pay online but I'm
[1:18:04] going to go
[1:18:06] pickup so you pay pay
[1:18:08] online you receive the receipt on your
[1:18:13] telephone so you go where you go where
[1:18:15] you
[1:18:16] paid could be
[1:18:18] Walmart could be Sam's Club you go with
[1:18:21] your
[1:18:23] receipt and that Sunday in the
[1:18:26] morning that the Lord Jesus came with
[1:18:28] the
[1:18:29] receipt and he reclaimed
[1:18:32] us you are
[1:18:35] mine and I'm going to perfect
[1:18:39] you and I want to do in them what I want
[1:18:41] to do in them come un
[1:18:44] next and train this girl this girl for
[1:18:48] me and teach
[1:18:50] her what I like
[1:18:56] and show her the manual of uh norm and
[1:19:03] process you know like those that have
[1:19:06] a let's say you go to to a a
[1:19:10] workshop you have
[1:19:13] preparations and they teach you not to
[1:19:15] go to certain places in that
[1:19:17] building and the signs and warnings in
[1:19:20] that
[1:19:22] building so you have a theoretical
[1:19:25] preparation
[1:19:27] first so they take you to the place
[1:19:29] you're going to
[1:19:31] work then you
[1:19:33] remember there's a yellow line
[1:19:35] here I I I can't step
[1:19:40] here oh there there's a channel
[1:19:44] here
[1:19:45] I I can't pass there or somebody will
[1:19:48] hit me with a with a tow
[1:19:53] truck somebody might hit
[1:19:57] you so we have a a
[1:19:59] theoretical
[1:20:01] process we come
[1:20:04] here to receive
[1:20:08] preparation
[1:20:12] theoretically now when we go outside in
[1:20:14] that in the
[1:20:16] street here we're receiving
[1:20:19] burdens not like when we receiving a
[1:20:22] charge right now when you take two
[1:20:25] batteries
[1:20:26] right and you know the batteries got
[1:20:28] full
[1:20:29] charged but the battery has to be
[1:20:32] recharged and you had to put it on
[1:20:36] use so when we go outside those
[1:20:41] doors our real preparation
[1:20:47] starts we want to see if the theory was
[1:20:50] right we go
[1:20:52] out there was a stop sign
[1:20:56] I did it I didn't make he didn't make
[1:20:59] the
[1:21:00] Stop and I take I open my window say hey
[1:21:03] you didn't stop what's the matter with
[1:21:08] you I
[1:21:12] failed that I I failed the first
[1:21:15] teaching and now we go to the
[1:21:18] street that happens at at your job
[1:21:21] site a
[1:21:23] boss you have boss is
[1:21:31] mean or or or a fellow worker that has
[1:21:34] it with
[1:21:36] you or or one that's jealous at
[1:21:41] you and you had to deal with
[1:21:45] that and even your own
[1:21:49] neighbors because we have we live in a
[1:21:51] in a a country with a lot of respect
[1:21:56] you have your
[1:21:59] neighbor the neighbor knows where your
[1:22:01] line of property
[1:22:03] is and you know where your property
[1:22:06] is he's a good
[1:22:09] neighbor as long as you don't cross over
[1:22:11] his
[1:22:17] property because people are inside their
[1:22:20] home but they're looking outside what's
[1:22:22] going on too
[1:22:24] they're in
[1:22:26] Tennessee I don't I'm not talking about
[1:22:28] Michigan i w talking about I'm talking
[1:22:31] about
[1:22:32] Tennessee yeah very conservative
[1:22:37] state in Tennessee they fought the Civil
[1:22:45] War if you put place your foot in
[1:22:47] somebody else's
[1:22:49] property and you look at the at their
[1:22:51] window and there's a rifle pointing at
[1:22:53] you
[1:22:57] and that happens in
[1:22:59] Tennessee you got to be very
[1:23:03] careful those that make
[1:23:07] deliveries and not go to the wrong
[1:23:11] house because they can take the take the
[1:23:13] boxes to the wrong
[1:23:17] house and it's not I somebody come out
[1:23:19] with a weapon what are you doing
[1:23:22] here it's it's it's it's
[1:23:26] strange so you have to be very
[1:23:29] careful to revise everything when you go
[1:23:32] out the house so you can be
[1:23:36] sure because you have to uh respect
[1:23:39] somebody else's
[1:23:42] property I don't know why I went that
[1:23:49] way there we're putting in practice what
[1:23:51] we saw
[1:23:53] here we have to be very careful with
[1:23:55] others respect
[1:23:58] them to respect one
[1:24:00] another the scripture said to do things
[1:24:06] right and not to break the law of
[1:24:09] men someone's going to break
[1:24:14] them what are you going to do when
[1:24:15] somebody breaks a law against
[1:24:17] you you're G to go fight
[1:24:20] them you're going to shoot them or
[1:24:23] you're going to forgive them
[1:24:25] don't worry go on forward no
[1:24:28] problem and sometimes in
[1:24:33] supermarkets they go with their little
[1:24:35] shopping cart and they and hit the other
[1:24:37] person with a shopping
[1:24:40] cart I'm
[1:24:42] tall and and they've hit my little C
[1:24:46] too oh no it's okay take it easy fine no
[1:24:50] problem
[1:24:56] what if I start a a battle with
[1:24:59] them and somebody's watching
[1:25:01] me what kind of fruit am I
[1:25:05] producing why do I follow the gospel if
[1:25:07] I go on the street and fight with
[1:25:11] people I got to be
[1:25:14] different because the word that I'm
[1:25:16] listening to is changing
[1:25:20] me it has to change me
[1:25:24] because a supernatural
[1:25:27] word and the word changes from inside
[1:25:31] out because it's something very
[1:25:35] [Music]
[1:25:38] different we're a lady or we're a chosen
[1:25:41] people we are the chosen of God
[1:25:46] Esther she could not be the same as the
[1:25:49] other ones she
[1:25:51] couldn't she had to be special
[1:25:55] right she could not be like
[1:26:00] vashy they were looking for somebody
[1:26:02] that better than
[1:26:05] VY the king had had a had a queen
[1:26:10] before and now he's seeking one that's
[1:26:12] better than the other
[1:26:15] one and this one has to give much better
[1:26:19] fruit and better
[1:26:23] characteristics better
[1:26:26] character and better
[1:26:30] all and better way to administer the
[1:26:33] things that God gives
[1:26:34] her very
[1:26:37] different and be a blessing to everyone
[1:26:41] else and to help
[1:26:45] others because she's bigger she's
[1:26:48] greater she has a higher
[1:26:53] position and and and John seen
[1:26:57] that and John says I saw the bride she
[1:27:01] was coming down out of
[1:27:03] Heaven the heaven of
[1:27:07] Jerusalem and it was a city coming
[1:27:11] down and she looked like a
[1:27:14] bride Adorn as a bride for her
[1:27:18] husband
[1:27:20] perfect no no stain or wrinkles
[1:27:26] and that's what is is showing to us in
[1:27:27] this
[1:27:29] age God is want us
[1:27:33] Perfection look
[1:27:37] us people that are very
[1:27:42] imperfect and God is saying to you no
[1:27:44] you're going to be
[1:27:46] perfect that's why we need we need the
[1:27:50] Unix and we know we need the the the the
[1:27:54] Manual of of of of procedures
[1:27:59] andali so we are in
[1:28:04] training oh no I'm afraid of the
[1:28:07] Gospel it's
[1:28:09] very he ask too much of
[1:28:13] me I'm GNA be
[1:28:17] bored and we're more happy than anybody
[1:28:21] else because we have understood many
[1:28:23] things
[1:28:26] many people look for
[1:28:28] happiness because they're
[1:28:31] empty and look for things in like in uh
[1:28:35] drinking or
[1:28:37] whatever but
[1:28:39] we we're
[1:28:41] happy and we're
[1:28:45] filled that way we have to
[1:28:50] give the Lord says for us to give what
[1:28:52] we have
[1:29:00] to teach to
[1:29:04] give us
[1:29:11] today we can say that we are that tree
[1:29:14] in the garden
[1:29:16] of there was a
[1:29:19] tree people come to eat of that
[1:29:22] tree we are that tree in this
[1:29:27] age people come
[1:29:30] hungry people come with
[1:29:33] habits people come with
[1:29:36] chains chains of
[1:29:38] Oppression they're going to come
[1:29:42] here because they want a little bit of
[1:29:44] what you
[1:29:46] got because that's
[1:29:48] different you look different you act
[1:29:51] different
[1:29:58] you're like an you're like an oasis to
[1:30:00] the people that come around
[1:30:02] you people are
[1:30:05] thirsting you're the Oasis for
[1:30:12] them your house should be full of your
[1:30:18] neighbors because your neighbors are
[1:30:20] going to see something in you that's
[1:30:21] very different
[1:30:24] oh when I talk to that lady or that
[1:30:27] man I feel so
[1:30:30] good my soul is so
[1:30:34] happy I heard some preaching uh these
[1:30:37] these
[1:30:40] days and it was called the the next door
[1:30:42] the next door
[1:30:48] Christian it talks about how uh the
[1:30:51] preacher talks about a neighbor
[1:30:56] for years he was his
[1:31:00] neighbor and everybody in town thought
[1:31:02] that that man was in
[1:31:05] drugs or or in dealings in Bad
[1:31:09] Business no one knew about that
[1:31:13] neighbor or his
[1:31:15] family no one knew about
[1:31:20] them so that preacher his dad died
[1:31:26] and all the people in that in that town
[1:31:29] came to show forth their you know their
[1:31:33] condolence you know 20 years of a
[1:31:38] neighbor and so that that supe that
[1:31:40] suspicious neighbor he
[1:31:43] came to pay
[1:31:49] condolence so found out that he was a
[1:31:51] Christian he was a preacher
[1:31:54] no one
[1:31:57] knew there they found out that he was a
[1:32:00] Christian never had no contact with
[1:32:02] other
[1:32:04] neighbors they didn't even know his
[1:32:06] name I don't believe you're like that I
[1:32:10] believe that
[1:32:12] you people in your neighborhood see
[1:32:15] something different about
[1:32:16] you I believe
[1:32:18] so something different is about
[1:32:22] you or they see your always a there's a
[1:32:24] blessing in that
[1:32:26] house I believe
[1:32:28] it that's talking about Tennessee not
[1:32:34] here I don't know how high it is over
[1:32:36] here Venezuela is like that too no they
[1:32:39] don't do like that or Michigan they
[1:32:41] don't do that like
[1:32:45] that and that's what we have
[1:32:50] today God is asking of us a higher
[1:32:53] position
[1:32:57] he sent to us a different
[1:33:00] message
[1:33:02] [Music]
[1:33:04] Esther had someone that would help her
[1:33:09] prepare there was not among the
[1:33:13] Unix and she would follow the counseling
[1:33:15] of that person and that was her
[1:33:19] uncle the uncle would tell Esther
[1:33:24] things that he would not tell to the
[1:33:26] other
[1:33:27] virgin
[1:33:30] Esther the king would see her
[1:33:33] different someone they someone talk to
[1:33:35] her
[1:33:36] ear oh look look my daughter the king is
[1:33:39] this and this and
[1:33:43] that and those were secret messages so
[1:33:46] she can prepare
[1:33:49] herself and the other one didn't have
[1:33:51] that Uncle
[1:33:55] so Esther was
[1:33:57] selected the queen that was
[1:34:05] elected and that that filled the heart
[1:34:07] of that King so
[1:34:09] much she pleased him so
[1:34:15] much even more than uh vashi pleased him
[1:34:23] so when Esther had
[1:34:25] problems we know that the the story is
[1:34:28] very
[1:34:30] long so I got my my phone my my watch
[1:34:33] has uh Tennessee
[1:34:36] hour so to me it's only 10 o00 over
[1:34:42] there today they woke me up with the the
[1:34:44] hour in
[1:34:47] California and now I got the hour
[1:34:49] Tennessee
[1:34:54] so I cannot talk about the whole
[1:34:57] story some stories were
[1:35:05] beautiful which actually gives an
[1:35:08] account of what's going on
[1:35:10] today but that Queen
[1:35:13] Esther she had a
[1:35:18] problem and she did something that
[1:35:20] should have she shouldn't have done
[1:35:24] she came before the presence of the
[1:35:27] king without being
[1:35:35] called and she came so so uh given up so
[1:35:39] so
[1:35:41] beaten she was willing to
[1:35:45] die for the problem that she had
[1:35:50] amen and we
[1:35:54] we have that
[1:35:55] Liberty to come into the presence of the
[1:35:57] Lord any
[1:36:02] time we don't have no
[1:36:05] problems not only in those
[1:36:09] moments 24 hours anytime we can come
[1:36:13] before his
[1:36:15] presence and
[1:36:19] sometimes we're wasting that that
[1:36:21] opportunity
[1:36:24] to to come and present
[1:36:34] yourself the throne is
[1:36:39] open why don't you
[1:36:43] come there's going to come a
