I just it's been too long since we had brother Alex I just want to say that statement and uh I I'll say it's it's I would say it's on my my fault I I think okay my brother's agree so but I just say let's try to get two Services out of this service amen which requires you to get in twice as much amen amen to pull it out amen so we're just going to welcome our brother to come and and just take the liberty and the Holy Ghost today to give us what God has put on his heart let's sing only believe as our brother comes believe only believe all things are [Music] believe all things are possible Lord

today amen yes we're so grateful to be Believers and you know we're just sing that song Victory in Jesus how many how many can look back even just in the last week and think about something the Lord did for you amen if you can do that why don't you just give the Lord another round of applause let me know how you feel say thank you Lord you're worthy we're so glad to be here today to know that he's here amen while you're at it why don't you give yourself a round of applause you made it too amen that's all right praise the Lord God brought us here today and we're grateful for that some of y'all got all offended with that the Lord likes you too it's okay amen not not only does he love you he even likes you well listen I I was just talking to somebody yesterday I'm looking forward I I've placed all my expectations on this idea that one day I'm going to hear him tell me well done and so if you don't think you're doing a good job now Now's the Time to start cuz I want to hear that do you want to hear that yes all right praise the Lord so we just we trust that uh we're happy to be here we're happy to be Christians amen we can have we can have joy in his presence amen so not here to prop you up but God's propped us up can I say it that way he's he has taken us who were dead in sins and trespasses and he has made us to sit down in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus now I don't know about you but it don't get much better than that amen amen I I couldn't imagine for myself something better than that so God is so gracious to us and now I learned a long time ago as the visiting Minister never disagree with the pastor that's why I agreed with you but you know then you get in trouble with that that too you know it's like I taught my kids what do you think about that oh yeah sure well you weren't supposed to agree with me testing people so no but we are so happy regardless of how frequently we here or not with you we just are thankful for what God is doing in your midst thankful to be part of what God's doing in this day wherever we're at in the world Amen we've got so much to be grateful for and so let's just if you if you would uh just for a moment here let's just change over the service and bow our heads for a word of Prayer I believe that he is here but uh it wouldn't do for him to come and let not make him welcome amen so let's just welcome him as we pray our heavenly father we are so thankful today Lord as we come here we've got so much to thank you for Lord we we could have been so many other places today but we're here Lord even for those maybe they are listening online they could be watching or listening to so many other things but they are participating in this Lord we understand that we didn't come after you that you drew us Lord plac something in our lives and all we can do is just say thank you Lord for that we acknowledge your grace and your mercy and the peace that you've bestowed in our lives to each one of us father that we might be partakers of this this divine nature through the through the sacrifice that was made at Calvary for us Lord today if there be one here that doesn't know you Lord or maybe they're just a little indifferent Lord maybe just a little Wayward in their heart I pray you'd restore such a one father May you forgive each one of us Lord we as your Prophet said we're just full of failure Lord but we're so grateful that you you know our frame that we're but dust that you pth us as small children according to your word and Lord as we've gathered here today we're not looking at us we're looking at the sacrifice that perfect sacrifice that was made for each one of us and with great confidence in the sinlessness and the virtue of that Lamb of God that was slain we can come boldly before your throne now for mercy and for grace in the time of need father we just pray you'd come now bless the reading of your word and the understanding thereof may you Enlighten our eyes may your countenance shine upon us father may you come and do things which only you can do if there be one sick or if there be one in need but you come and raise such one up for you've already made a way you've already paid the price we commit it now into your hands for you are a loving and a faithful Creator the Father of Lights in whom is no variableness or shadow of turning we thank you we give you all praise and glory and honor for it now in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen if you have your Bibles this morning I would invite you to turn with me into the Book of Daniel the nth chapter kind of an idea I've been looking at lately um and I'll just say this now um if you haven't noticed already it is an election year for for our government and so I'm not here to preach politics but I I'm tying this in for a reason because we see Daniel you know one way or the other things are probably going to go a certain direction for better for worse whatever um you know Daniel himself was living in a time of a changing of leadership a changing of things going on and I'd like to take this thought today uh you know brother B preaches about recognizing your D message I'd like to speak on understanding your Dan's message so if you're with me here in Daniel the 9th chapter we'll just read the first verse here and the Bible says this it says in the first year of Darius the son of aus the seed of the mes which was made King over the real of the Chaldeans in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem and I set my face so notice he's studying the word it was written down by a prophet right and when he does this he said I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting sackcloth and Ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant Mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his Commandments we notice this we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments neither have we hearkened unto the voice I'm sorry unto thy servants the prophets which spake in thy name to our Kings our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land oh Lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion of faces as at this day to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and unto all Israel that are near and that are far off through all the countries whether thou Hast d them because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee Oh Lord to us belongeth confusion of face to our Kings to our princes and to our fathers because we have sinned against thee to the Lord Our God belong mercies and forgivenesses though we have rebelled against him neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord Our God to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophets now uh for the sake of time I'm just going to have us go down here to uh we'll go down to the 20th verse but he basically impacts this idea that God had spoken to them and dealt with them and they hardened their hearts they contined to do these things and this is why the fury of God has come upon them and so here he is he's he's making repentance and I think it's significant because Daniel doesn't get up and say well our my fathers did this right you know those guys they didn't know they but we have sinned he's he's interceding he's taking upon himself Lord I'm no better than them Lord forgive us we have heartened our hearts we didn't hearken unto you and so he's he seeks Mercy from God here and in this 20th verse I want you to notice here I go here verse 20 it says this and while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of My People Israel and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of my God yay walls I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me but the time notice of the evening oblation amen and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I am now come forth to give the skill and understanding at the beginning of thy supplications the Commandment came forth I am come to show thee for thou greatly beloved therefore notice understand the matter and consider the vision amen amen may the Lord bless the reading as where you may be seated am we're talking about understanding your Dan's message and and he understands by books where he's at he prays and the man the angel Gabriel comes and gives him a further understanding and so the reason I bring this up and why it's significant thank you so much um you know I I was just this week again I it seems like this is a common thing we visit this every few years because of politics and things and so I know nobody in here's politically minded that's a good thing but a lot of people are amen even in message churches they're very adamant about their politics and you know listen I'm not here today to tell you not to vote now I like I like having more money in my pocket than less amen I I like laws that are agreeable and things but the reason I'm saying all this is you know people they you know they look at the Supreme Court and they'll say oh see how the Supreme Court they turn back row versus Wade and they'll look at that as some sort of significant thing and I'm thinking but the problem was never whether it was legal or illegal the problem was the hearts of the people that want to do it in the first place amen because whether it's legal or it's illegal if they want to do it they'll find a way to do it amen and so I I was talking about this a while back and like I said just even somebody just a couple days ago you know they're talking about prayer in school and stuff and how our Supreme Court this same Supreme Court different different justices different time but the same mechanism of our government you know back in 1962 they ruled that school was not allowed to sanction or you know uh promote prayer in school that was the Supreme Court ruling and we don't have prayer in schools today amen not typically we've got guns We've Got Drugs we've got underage uh Teenage pregnancies and all kinds of nonsense we've got kids that think they're animals we've got you know all kinds of nonsense but we don't have prayer and we think that's a victory as a country amen and so I you know I've heard this for years well see they they took the prayer out of schools and look what came in but I want you to understand amen that uh um you know when they took prayer out of schools they didn't take it out of your home amen they didn't stop you from praying in your car they didn't stop you from going to church amen all these things that we take for granted As Americans amen people they oh look we got rid of prayer and stuff that was never the problem amen because listen they told Daniel one day he couldn't pray and you know he did he prayed as he always did before amen so we look at we look at uh the world we look at our country and the lack of Prayer in school is not the issue a lack of people that pray in the first place is the issue amen our country this what I'm getting at amen you could brother B said you could put a George Washington and an Abraham Lincoln and every County in this country it won't come back amen the problem is not our government we say well that's quite a statement that's a pretty big problem it is but the problem is the people their hearts have waxed gross their hearts are in darkness they got to away from God they rejected the gospel and prayer getting kicked out of school is just a symptom of the actual issue it's the people they rejected the gospel they rejected God and what we see today is just the fruit of what they've done amen what they did when when when this started to happen we we we drew lines and we made political affiliations and again I'm not here to tell you how to vote or anything like that but we we went to school board meetings and we got into activism we got into politics and we're going to we're going to bring America back around we're going to get people that that align with our Christian Viewpoint in our politics just sanction things and make it legal and make it comfortable listen the problem was what we should have done is what Daniel did amen when we see a country go this direction we should have got down I'm saying we as a people we as a nation should have got down and pray I'm not looking for the senator to fix it I'm not looking for a congressman to fix it I'm not looking for the president to fix it we should have went to the Lord and it's ironic to me the one place we should have went was in prayer because that was the very thing that was under attack and that's the last thing everybody did right it's just back at 911 we just talked about uh September 11th here just a few days ago amen the churches were full that Sunday where are they at today right amen their hearts of wax gross they don't want anything to do with God true they're not fastened after the will of God that's right amen so I made this statement I I don't remember who I was talking to just a day or two I think it was at a birthday party yesterday I was talking to a brother um the problem is in our country our country used to be our culture was influenced by the church that was the primary influence we came over here freedom of religion all these things and the biggest influences in our country was the church amen now I'm not saying that's right or wrong that's just what it was amen that's why our country is founded the way it is it's why it looked the way it was but that's no longer the case today it's no longer that we are the primary influence of our culture but our culture is the primary influence of churches amen most churches Orient their policy Orient their preaching Orient what they say around how to appeal to their culture and that's contrary to the word of God and I want us to understand today we we're blessed people to be able to sit here in this church and have the Liberty to say these things because our forefathers in this gospel they didn't have a Christian Nation with an agreeable government supporting them you could have 12 people in Ephesus and those people hated that eph that Ephesian church amen but they believe what they believed anyway not because it was pleasant to their culture not because it was agreeable to the populace but because they met God and they knew it was the truth no matter what politics no matter what government says about it they knew where they we're standing amen so we look at our country today now it's Hollywood It's Entertainment it's media it's driving our culture and it seeps right into churches and they're partakers of the same thing amen so we look at our country where it started where it's at today and we can blame Hollywood and we can blame the president we can blame one political party and the other but if you want to blame anybody blame weak pulpits blame Christians That Got Away From God that didn't stand in prayer stand before the Lord and repent Lord why did our country get this way we rejected the gospel we heard a message and we didn't want it we wanted bobhair women we wanted the things of the world right we did that yes now it's easy for us to sit here today well I wouldn't have done that it have been easy for Daniel to do the same thing but Daniel understood listen you see in the book of Nehemiah Lord we yes cuz whether we like it or not we're all in this together am amen whether we like it or not we need each other amen listen it's I was just thinking this this morning you know uh you know I'm trying to think how I can say this in a good way you know I I've been around a little bit travel a little bit and uh it's not easy for me personally to just trust everybody you meet amen I come out of the world and so you know it's like it's like the media listen if they want to interview you they're not doing you a favor amen the world's not doing you a favors they're trying to scam you they're trying to get you and unfortunately you see it in churches amen and so sometimes if we're not careful as Christians we get in a place that becomes very difficult to even trust one another to we we look at ourselves if we're not careful well this is the church and this is this group and here's me but whether we like it or not we're in this same boat you've got faults and I've got faults and you've got failures and I've got a pass but here we are this is a lot we're given and it may seem times that we are fools to trust each other but trust each other we must amen because at the end of the day we are we are bound by the same life of Jesus Christ yes and Daniel recognizes my fathers my people listen this is my claim to God I'm a covenant Jew my only claim is through these men right whether you and I like it or not people have laid a path for us and and and listen our C we just take this country for a second amen yeah there were men with failures and problems and this and that but we're here today because of people that paid prices and made sacrifices amen so we can stand here and believe this amen and as soon as we get this attitude well I'm better than they are that's exactly how they got off from where they were at true it's so easy for us to say well I'm not like that guy well praise the Lord somebody you know it's just like money you know you you take somebody who doesn't have a lot of money and they're like you know if I ever win the law they're going to make money but you if I ever get a bunch of money well I'll do this and I'll do that and I'll do this and I'll and it's easy to say that when you don't have the money and as soon as they get it they've gone to Disneyland they've flown a rocket to the moon and three months later they're as poor as they were before cuz this is what I'm getting out you don't know what you would do till you're in that situation anybody can say anything amen it's easy for us to look back in 1956 and say well I wouldn't have done that well by the grace of God you wouldn't have done it it has nothing to do with you and I it's not that you're smarter or better than the next person and as soon as you get the attitude that you are that's when you're in trouble that's what I'm getting at So Daniel he looks at this amen he realizes is in this situation and he turns to the Lord he acknowledges his sin and he begins to repent and Daniel's not blessed like we are today he didn't have this message like we have he didn't have a pastor he didn't have a support group he didn't have a a Facebook page and a prayer chain and a comfy church he had nothing but the Lord and that was enough he had an excellent Spirit he knew he heard from God he had the word of the Lord and he stood on that amen and when he wasn't allowed to pray not just school not even his own home he threw the shutters open he looked toward Jerusalem and he prayed as he always did before yes amen amen so I want you to understand no matter what happens in November right listen this world it's not my home no matter how good or bad it gets I'm just passing through my hopes are not laid up in what's going to happen in a couple months cuz it's probably going to be disappointing either way either way it's a disappointment listen listen you look at Solomon look at David listen we don't have men like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln you know why they wouldn't survive in our political climate you know why it's corrupt you know why it's corrupt because the people are corrupt amen yes amen amen I do love it you know I was I was I was looking at this you know when Daniel becomes king in Israel all the different tribes that gathered together to basically sanction him being placed as king and I love it because in 1 Chronicles the 12th chapter and this 32nd verse the men of isachar their tribe they come up to support David being King I love this the Bible says that they were men that had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do I like that they understood the time they were living in and it it showed them what they were supposed to do amen and I think it's important we're talking about understanding our Dan's message we understand that we are here for a reason today I hope we understand the message has not come for us to reform America culture the message has not come for us to build another America or to for us to evangelize the world to our Viewpoint it's come for a Rapture amen it's come to take a people off the face of the Earth because we're living in the days that Jesus said when I come back will I even find faith on the earth it's so close and it's so dark and my goal your goal what God has laid before us amen if we don't understand why we're here we get busy making preparations and we're we're building a bunker building a bigger this and we're we're laying out food to go through things listen I'm not praise the Lord and listen if you have a snowstorm with good thing you got a generator listen I'm not against preparation but we can spend so much time preparing politically and physically and materially for things and what we should be doing what we should not neglect first is to prepare our hearts to meet the Lord CU if we're not ready for that none of the rest matters come on brother so when you understand the time that you're living in what it's about it changes what you're doing amen While others are busy running around doing this you know I've I'm here for a different reason God's not ordained me to wrath but to obtain salvation through Jesus Christ amen there's a group of people that's for but I'm not one of them and I'm not saying that because I decided that I'm saying because God revealed it and I understand that's the purpose of God in my life the purpose of God in your life am amen Daniel understood amen I like that Ephesians chapter 5 the Bible tells us to redeem the time because the days are what they're evil that's right that's not going to change that's been that way for thousands of years now amen so it says wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is so if you're wise you understand you prepare you're ready you know what to do amen Daniel in chapter 9 here we read here you know he's he's understood by books the words of Jeremiah he read in there that there were 70 years of captivity that was determined for the people and I love this amen it's now this is just as much to me as anybody else when he reads this and he realizes 70 years of captivity was determined and they're at the end of 70 years a lot of people would have stopped there praise God we've got a message captivity is almost over we're almost done a lot of guys would have went around rejoicing and being glad about that I know something you don't know I'm smarter than the guy in the other Church down the street but Daniel didn't do that amen Daniel understood this and when he did he turns his face in prayer towards God he said now that I'm seeing this I need an even greater understanding why am I seeing this amen I wonder how many times people in the message maybe they come into it maybe they raising It Whatever It Is they recognize that God has done something this day God has sent us a Vindicated word through a prophet God has revealed to us things he's brought things back together and how many times do we stop and consider but why am what's the purpose I remember as a young man when when I first come in the message and I'm looking at the seals and I'm not preaching on the seals today I don't know where but no but you know God opens these seals wh why a lot of people don't St to ask what's the purpose behind it amen now there's a purpose behind it not preach it today but you know maybe I'll put a book out or something I don't know but there's a purpose amen behind it amen it's not just there for you to say I'm smarter than the next guy I know something that somebody else doesn't know so he turns his in in prayer to God he sets his face into the Lord and here's Daniel a man with understanding already he's a man with an excellent spirit and yet he's crying out to the great and Dreadful God he says you've kept your Covenant you've showed Mercy we sinned we get hearkened to the voice of the prophets Lord please turn your anger from us God C your face to shine upon your Sanctuary which is desolate once more yeah and so it's remarkable to me because Daniel he's he understands that the time of captivity is almost over they're getting ready to to go back home they're getting ready to be delivered from bondage and we would sit there say what's he praying for then if he knows this that's exactly why he's praying all right if we're getting ready to leave captivity what does god require from me what is God showing me about my life life amen listen when God this is what I'm coming to today we're talking about the message as a as a broader point but even in our own lives right our own personal lives God shows us things sometimes amen you should be you know I've called you to do this I want you to do this God shows us things in our lives or maybe even the lives of others when he shows us things or he shows us things in this message he's not just showing it to us so we can possess a certain knowledge and feel smarter than the next person he's showing us so we will pray for understanding of his will in that situation I recognize the time I'm living in but what is your will about it for me yes maybe you're looking at a job situation or a family situation a church whatever it is amen but Lord what is your will I see where we're at I know why we're here but what is your purpose in it God what do you want me to do about it amen amen and so he's showing us many times so that we'll pray about it amen because the thing is it it doesn't do me it doesn't do me good to tell you hey brother you should do this amen you have to hear from God Amen Daniel wasn't say well I'll go down hear and I'll ask my buddies about what do they think about it what do you think about this what do you think about that he says no I want to hear from a messenger of God I want to hear and he and listen this is not the first time I love it this is not the first time that Gabriel spoken to Daniel Amen this is not a while I didn't know that was going to happen sort of a thing but Daniel has already prayed before and I want you to remember the first time he does this he's prayed for 21 days and Gabriel shows up and says listen God heard you from the first maybe right now even you're praying about certain things and you're like I I'm waiting for an answer I I need to hear from God I want you to understand God heard from the very first day amen Daniel understands as he goes into prayer again if I have to wait 21 days or 21 years I know God's got an answer for me God has not showed this to me to abandon me to my my own thinking but he showed it to me to make me acknowledge that he's got more for me amen amen amen so he's showing us things Desiring we would pray the Bible says that we should pray without ceasing amen amen So Daniel seeing the Fulfillment of Prophecy this is what I'm getting it did not cause him to slack it stirred him up even more that's right we see the world falling apart it was prophesied to fall apart yes amen that shouldn't scare us we've received a kingdom which can't be removed we're on the one place that's not falling apart you're not falling apart the world's falling apart you might feel like you're falling apart but you're not falling apart you're rising up you're part of an everlasting Kingdom you've been translated out of the powers of Darkness into the kingdom of God's son amen amen praise the Lord so we see these things listen we see all this going on around us it it should not discourage us right it it would if we weren't looking at the understanding of it amen but what it does we see it happening and things look like they're worse all the time you know what even so come quickly Lord Jesus well my family this and this that listen if you've committed it to God and you've prayed listen God can change it in a moment sometimes we get fearful about the coming of the lord well but this isn't where it needs to be I want this to take place I want you to understand how many prophecies concerning Christ came to pass in the last few hours of his life amen that lost loved one that you've been praying for right now could be get saved and you wouldn't even know in five minutes from now the Rapture could take place we just don't know but don't be afraid of the coming of the Lord no matter where you're at no matter what you've looked for what you're praying for if you've committed to God you've got confidence in God then you lift your hands and say even so come quickly Lord Jesus I want nothing to hinder the coming of the Lord amen I know praise the Lord I know that God is faithful amen he is faithful amen amen we are not powerless today in the world in our situation amen we can't change every broken system in the world you're not supposed to right amen that's right amen we try to fix it all the time you're not supposed to fix it amen amen but we have received the kingdom like I said you can't save every nation but you can preach the gospel and I believe out of every nation there will be a kindred and a tongue and a nation of people that are saved amen yeah might be five over here might be 20 over here there's going to be somebody out of every Kinder tongue and Nation doesn't mean every nation as a whole is going to get saved we're not here to evangelize the whole world and they're all going to believe what we believe and we're going to be accepted and people are going to love us never going to happen amen but God's going to have a people he wherever you're at any time zone and he plac the world he's going to pluck them up amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord I believe that we're living in a time of judgment amen that fair to say Yes Sir Daniel was living in a time of judgment amen but that doesn't mean he had to live under judgment amen amen amen listen Israel when they were in Egypt it was judgment upon Egypt but not on them right amen amen so Daniel's living in a time of judgment but not he's not himself under judgment amen he might not have had a pastor he might not have had a church but God had blessed him and it's it's amazing to me God had given him a position God had Del delivered him from the mouth of lions and listen he served the Babylonians he was the master of magicians yes amen and God showed him the me and pers were going to come in and wipe out all this stuff and it's amazing to me because here he is in the courts of the king an officer there and when the me and Persians come in they wipe out the kings of Babylon they wipe out their princes they wipe out all these officials they didn't hurt Daniel that's right Daniel got promoted amen listen the changing of of leadership the changing of the regime it didn't hurt Daniel it promoted the will of God in his life amen it it didn't affect him he could watch a th fall his side he could watch 10,000 fall at his right hand but it didn't come n to him amen so I don't want you to be afraid about tomorrow or this year what it's going to bring cuz whatever happens somehow it's going to be for your good all things work together for good not for the Republican party or the Democrat Party not for Ukraine or for Russia right for them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose no matter how bad it looks listen it's for your good amen it's going to promote you in the end amen whatever happens is going to get you out of here it's going to facilitate the changing of your body it's going to bring about the coming of the Lord listen God knows what he's doing amen all them people in Babylon ringing their hands under seeds going to get wiped out and Daniel knew this is the time Deliverance Hallelujah this is the time we're going back yeah amen so judgment upon Wicked deliver for the righteous amen we see it in the time of Noah the same Waters that destroyed the old world saved eight Souls it saved them now now this is just Me Maybe PR maybe presuming a little bit but imagine Noah and his family if things had continued on the way they did where would they been they probably been dead or something who know that was how Wicked the world was it they didn't just escape the Judgment it saved them yes amen amen amen it saved the world Amen praise the Lord amen so the coming judgment is an end in this case for Daniel for the Captivity of God's people it's Deliverance amen right this what I like you know brother man talks about this many times in the message at length you know you take Noah and he sees the day he's he has an understanding right there's a purpose behind it he begins to build an ark now today if you want to be a part of this end time message and you believe believe God you're looking for the coming of the Lord you don't build an ark to escape you do if you want to sell tickets in Kentucky that's cool that's fine nothing wrong with that but that's not how you get in the Rapture amen you know judgment's coming judgment's come before but the way that you prepare is not the same way that Noah did it's not the same way that Daniel did amen praise the Lord so Noah he looks at the season Daniel looks at the season and I I I don't know if I've preached this here before talked about but it's like I talked about years ago when Joshua and the children of Israel they they come they come up to the Jordan River amen the Bible talks about when they come to the Jordan River God has told them to go over and possess the land they've wandered for 40 years this is the time for it amen and they get to the waters and the banks of the Jordan they're overflowing amen they get there like we're going to take the land this is it whoa hold up man it's flooded let's hold up a few days not quite yet okay our timing is a little it's overflowed amen uh we can't cross the water's too high but the Bible says the waters from Jordan always overflow at the Harvest Time amen amen so other people looked and said oh no the water's too high we can't do it right now and Josh said no that's what makes it the perfect time because there's a harvest over there we're going to feed on the old corner of the land God said we're going over there the man is going to stop we're feed that food over there that they planted God laid it up for us amen I'm saying this for a reason it's the Harvest time it's the evening time it's the time for it amen and these other men they looked at the circumstances the river is too high we can't do it we can't do it right now we need to wait for a different time but Joshua was not looking at the river he was not looking at the circumstances he was looking at the season amen no this is the time for it cuz God said it's the time for it the circumstance don't matter it's what God has said amen right and the biggest mistake you and I can make yes is to look at our circumstances well the family this the the country this and the church this don't look at the circumstances cuz the circumstances will always tell you something different the very circumstances which they looked at and thought was a hindrance was the very evidence this is the time we don't want to cross in the winter we don't want to go in the spring we're going in the Harvest time we're possessing the old corn of the land amen that's right brother you take an investor amen he's looking to buy some stocks well he doesn't wait till it shoots up 500% and buys it amen it's too late he buys it when it's low cuz he forecasts it's going to go up he's not looking at what is he's looking at what it will be right so he goes and buys some Crypton and doesn't go up see he looked at the wrong thing yeah he looked with this stock here he want bought some Coca-Cola or whatever amen he should have bought some Bitcoin he should have bought some apple whatever it is amen listen Jesus himself talks about this to the Jews they could look at the weather they must had better weathermen than we got am man if weathermen were prophets we'd have stoned them I you know I can't imagine working a job where I'm right 17% of the time I get paid for it amen these men could look at the signs of the weather and know bad weather was coming but they didn't have discernment of the time no they didn't know the signs of the time true amen amen it's true so when you're looking at the season listen when that farmer goes and plants in in Spring amen he doesn't know what the weather is going to look like for the next 12 weeks but it knows the season's going to change it always does right it always works that way amen so a good farmer a good investor whatever it is they don't look at the circumstance they look at the season what's going to take place next amen yes the biggest mistake you and I can make whether it's politics Church our own lives is to look at our circumstances right amen because your circumstances will deceive you you will start looking at the wrong thing if you're looking to be discouraged you will find something to discourage you amen if you're looking for something to justify your delusional idea how you're going to get rich quick you'll find something to support your opinion yes but Daniel sees us he's like but Lord what is the season it's a season of Deliverance but why is that significant amen why does the farmer know why is it significant because it helps him to prepare for the coming season amen amen I pray God today help us each want to understand the season that we're in whether we're talking about the world we're talking about church at home whatever it is amen when he saw the season was getting ready to change Daniel Prayed and Gabriel come says you know what I've come to give you skill and understanding consider the vision think about it for a minute consider the vision you've had a people they've been captive for 70 years now God is going to visit them with another season 70 weeks it's a prophetic number 70 * 7 490 years you've got done with this season of captivity now another season's coming in and the purpose of this season is not just for another bondage but at the very last week Hallelujah the greatest season of them all amen the greatest event ever amen and the 70th week Messiah the Prince Will Come and he will be a governor he'll be a leader to his people he'll be cut off in the midst of it but he's going to come back he will fulfill the will of the Lord amen God is showing Daniel that captivity is almost over because God wants to bring Messiah on the scene that's right amen I think I've preached about it here before but these Magi these wise men 4 47 480 some years later they come to Jerusalem one day and they followed the star they saw the star because they were looking for it cuz Daniel had made Provisions not just one but two seasons prior had laid up food in due season that this is going to happen in a certain time in a certain season and we're prepared get him gifts get ready for it he's coming and when they get to Jerusalem there they are where is he that's born King of the Jews amen and they all looked at each other said what are they talking about right they didn't know anything about a star they weren't looking for his coming they were busy bickering about politics amen fighting with each other praise the Lord somebody you know what they did they went and got the scriptures out well let's look where he supposed to be born at now why didn't they do that beforehand that's they should have known that ahead of time these are religious men oh oh yeah I guess we're supposed to have a messiah where's he born at anyway man praise listen don't wait till you're at the end of your rope say man May better start looking what's this really say get in it now don't miss what he's doing don't miss what he's doing right now in your life don't wait for him to do something brother B says all the time we're looking back to what God did looking forward to what he's going to do and we miss what he's doing right now so I'm waiting for the next big meeting I'm waiting for Revival listen don't miss what he's doing now you can have as much Revival as you want in your life right now you can have as much of God in your life as you want right now don't miss it thank you Jesus well we better figure out what's God's doing better better get into this they had been prepared their daddy's prepared them and the daddy before prepared all the way back to the time of Daniel they had prepared for the moment amen listen I'm prepared for the moment my loved ones come walking through the door I'm prepared for a time of the Dead in Christ rise I'm ready for it amen I'm not oh man didn't know they were coming in the door where's that at in the message where's that at in the Bible the dead in Christ they're going to rise first no I'm ready for it I'm looking for it you're ready for it amen hallelujah am wo glory to God well I'm feeling pretty good it could happen right now you say that's reckless I didn't say it's going to happen right now it could we might not get to the listen I want to live that way I'm want to live it could happen right now as I'm speaking through the back door the dead in Christ come marching in amen why would you not want to live that way amen listen I know I know people message preachers they preach well you know the Lord's not going come yet and this and that youve got a prophet on tape 60 years ago saying I'm he could come tomorrow morning right he could come right now and I'm thinking you know what it is Jesus talks about the wicked servant yeah he said my Lord delays his coming and watch he begins to beat the other servants and he becomes drunk not knowing the hour his Lord was going to return amen I don't want to be that guy that's beating the other servants yeah getting Drunk on Power an influence and money and women and popularity you don't want to be that guy cuz I believe he could be here any moment actually I believe he's here now I'm just looking for the manifestation of it but he's already here that's what made the difference for me that's what made the difference you didn't do that did you anybody want to take credit for their own Redemption didn't think so you did we can talk about it afterwards I guess I'll straighten you out I didn't save it wasn't my idea amen it wasn't your idea God revealed it to us like he did Daniel Amen God revealed this same Messiah that he showed in a forecast to Daniel we've seen it again the coming of the Lord is in our generation yes amen the son of man has spoken to us see it's one thing to know we're living in a time of judgment listen you can talk to secular people right you can at the rise of AI and the proliferation of nuclear weapons you can look at whatever circumstances you want and most people yeah it's going the wrong way it doesn't take a genius at this point to figure out the world's falling apart everybody believes that they actually use it to promote their point we're going to fix it no you're not that's the whole another sermon but let me just say this you'll never fix the problem that you got yourself into with the thinking that got you there in the first place oh our politically minded objectives and our political listen that's what made it a problem you can't fix it that way that's right listen Jesus Christ is not coming back to restore us to the original Constitution he's not interested in our form of government or anybody else's but his own amen hallelujah praise the Lord am Daniel sees it's a time for changeing leadership amen yeah God has ordained to change in leadership amen not just for Israel but for the whole world amen amen because of this these men that aren't even Jews they're not even Jews recognize this is the one that's King of the Jews this is the one that will rule and Reign Over the Earth and they brought him gifts that spoke of who he was amen my my men that weren't even Jews yet they had wisdom they knew what to do amen with the season they were living in amen amen so we have to know what to do amen and this is the thing like I said earlier you know sometimes you pray and you don't always know yeah now I'm probably not the first person I think we talked about this has anybody ever prayed for something and not got an answer right away few hands probably every okay that's good it's all right it's okay that's that's not just you then that's every one of us brother brandom himself has prayed many times in his life amen let me just read this quote to you amen says this in be certain of God he says you know it's a strange thing he said may God let this soak to every one of you if you never hear me preach again let this be a message he says it's strange most strange that sometimes that God does things that way he says you know we have confessed our sins we've met every requirement that God requires we believed on God there's a circumstance has to be met it's according to his will we've confessed our sins we made all the wrongs that we did right done everything we know how to do I'm I'm speaking to somebody now amen amen every requirement God has made we've met the requirement and yet he lays silent he just won't answer us I don't know how it is now but he says this next thing he says I'm sure I'm speaking to people this morning who has come to that place right I've been there many times myself this is a Vindicated Prophet this is a man that's seen the dead raising Visions yeah he seen something from the time he's three and yet himself his confession many times I've been there right you prayed and you prayed you've turned over every stone you've looked for an answer and yet it seems like God just lay silent amen Amen brother am it's discouraging we said there well did I miss something we look over it all again we're going through the paperwor did did I we're critiquing ourselves like we had something to do with it in the first place right that's what it is like it's like troubleshooting you know it or something like that well did you plug it in I love that the first thing yeah I plugged it in sometimes I didn't plug it in that's why that's there we go through all this protocol right I've done everything the manual says right well maybe it's not you right wasn't Daniel was well Daniel you let God down no God just had a timing to it right amen he says this I'm I've been there many times myself I've went back and traced my life turned over every stone I find he did something wrong I go confess it he did something wrong say Lord I'll make it right amen go do so come back again say now Lord Thou Art God you'll answer me surely I've met every request that you required me to do every requirement I have met it and still he won't move amen seems Seems to set silent that's when you've got to be sure that he is God Amen don't be discouraged told you get discouraged don't be discouraged only thing is in your heart to be certain of God Amen amen somebody listen that's my message for us today in uncertain times make sure you're certain of God that's all you can do you can't change the times you can't fix the times but you can be certain of God yes yes I haven't heard from God I'm not sure listen job s sat on that ass sheep for a long time they asked brother B I think he preached it six weeks six months one time how long you keeping him on the ass she brother Bram he said but that was his time of decision yes cuz God will let you sit there sometime s because you know what we like to do when we don't hear about from God what his will is we'll just kind of make it up yeah true that is so true well I think this is what God wants me to do you think I'm talking to amen let's just be real here for a second that's what we do brother B said his gift was to wait on the Lord and that's the hardest thing for us oh when the meeting's moving and it's getting hot and everybody's anointed and everybody's having a good time we're on top of the world but how many of us can beat still and know that he's gone amen we sit there in a room it's like it's like you go to an interview that's like a tactic they do they just sit there and make you wait they want to see if you get nervous you just start saying stuff so yeah you know I got lot they're they're wanting to see how you deal with nothing going on Amen and God's looking to see are we going to really wait on him are we really depending on him or is it just convenient amen well if I don't hear from God today then I'll mix something up and we'll work ourselves and our imagination we'll take this little sign here and we'll we'll take our circumstances yes and we'll paint a picture true well this is what this is all about and it might not have anything to do with it no there's a time to everything every purpose a season for every purpose right under Heaven amen if we're not careful we try to orient the time around our Viewpoint true that doesn't work that way amen you can't Orient time around you have to orient to what the season is no farmer sits there at the dead of winter and says you know what we're doing this thing I'm making it happen let's go he can do that till he's BW in the face he ain't getting nothing and we'll do that spiritually we'll sit there and plant our seed and we'll try to make you can't amen amen what you can do is be certain of God amen amen Lord I've been praying a long time about this Lord I'm waiting on you now I will say this make sure you're listening right A lot of times we don't hear from God because you're just not listening if you're listening and you've done what he said amen he's going to speak amen the Bible says that they that are LED of the spirit they are the sons of God and you look at that in the Greek they're always LED amen listen you always being led you might not always follow you might not always realize it but there is always a leadership God has not abandon you he is the faithful Shepherd there's always leadership present and sometimes the leadership is to sit there and be quiet till I tell you to do something else right true true and we don't like that right it's contrary to our natural makeup that's why he's doing it because you get used to do it the way you want to do it and he doesn't want want you to do it the way you want to do it he wants to do the way he wants to do it amen what did Jesus say seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness all these other things will be added to you you put listen you put God first right God will always take care of the rest yes it doesn't matter what the circumstances look like that's right it doesn't matter what's going on in the world you put God first amen and everything you do God will be faithful amen I once was young I'm a little older not as old as some people now I'm older I've never seen the righteous forsaken I've never seen a seed begging for bread that was David's testimony amen you put God first watch what God does amen amen it might not look like much today but you look back man that was incredible am how many times in your own life you prayed about something just no idea it feels like you're spinning your wheels getting nowhere I feel like I've been in captivity for 70 years god it feels like nothing's going on and all of a sudden God just one day it just begins to change just begins to move and now you look back oh man that was great well you didn't feel that way about it back there am but you will feel that way about it when you see it come to pass I've seen him do it enough to know he'll do it again right things I'm praying about things you're praying about today it might be an uncertain time that you're living in but be certain of God Amen that's what they understanding is comeing to give you a certainty God is in listen he has not lost control he permits things to happen but he has not lost control amen what can the righteous do seek the seek first the kingdom of God Amen when things are dark and desperate that's the time Amen Let Let me just say this real quick brother talking about this be certain of God what he's talking about is when the Prophet Elijah goes to the widow woman Zera ien she's in sidon and when when when Elijah is there God speaks to go down here to this widow woman he says I've commanded her to sustain you now think about this I've commanded her to sustain you and he gets there and sees this woman and she walks out the gates ah the Lord spoke to me I'm not what happened she doesn't go out there bless God there's a commandment over my life God's going to do something in my life today God's going to do Mighty things he's commanded me to sustain a vindicate prop she out there to make her last meal she's fixing to die yes that's what she's thinking she's not thinking about all that God's done for her wow it's going to be great what a great testimony this is going to be she gets out there and she sees a man and he says hey I need to drink of water I'll get you a drink oh by the way Fe me cake well listen I've got these two sticks I've got two sticks this is all I've got I've got this and enough for a cake it home I'm going to make it for me and my boy and we're going to died that's where she was at am she's at the bottom of the barrel literally of her food she's at the end of a rope I'm here and listen I'm fixing to die you can have what you want I'm going to die anyway and that Prophet says listen go ahead do what you said but first amen make me a cake also for thus sayith the Lord the cruise will not run dry the meal will not run out till the day I cause rain to fall from Heaven and she heard she'd been waiting on him thus sayith the Lord and she is there yes maybe you're there she is there and her most desperately she's not going out there encouraged looking for this to happen yeah she's like I'm done for this is my last day on Earth but then that's what God spoke amen listen it's not this and this and that it's the season they were in but in that season God had made AIS God spoke a commandment over her life and she didn't even know it amen Jesus said there's many Widow women many women in that day in the Days of Elijah but only one was God only one was a prophet sent to listen there's many churches many people all kinds of ideas all kinds of thoughts influencers and channels and all kinds of stuff every kind of opinion you could have there's a voice for today but there's an elected lady Hallelujah whether she realized it or not 60 years ago a message was given for her sake that she would survive on thus say the Lord no matter what the season looks like she's here to stay she's here to survive she's an overcomer Hallelujah you might not feel like an overcomer but that's what you're called to be anyway listen you might be like get in you might not feel like you're a mighty man of Valor hiding behind the wine press ringing your hands about what's going on in the world today but you're called to be Mighty you're called to be Overcomers amen you are not the tail you are the head God has spoken a blessing over your life he'll bless your Uprising he'll bless your Downs sitting he blessed your coming in and I believe when you walk out today he'll bless your going outen God spoke to Abraham surely blessing I will bless you you know what that means if I'm going to bless one person surely if I'm ever going to bless anybody it's going to be you Abraham I can't bless anybody else and not bless Abraham and let me say this if you're the Seed of Abraham if you're Christ surely blessing he's going to bless you and I if he's going to do it for anybody it's us not because you're great not because you're smarter because of where you're at you are in Christ Jesus far above all principality all power all might and all Dominion all depends on your circumstances no depends on your perspective amen see your perspective when it shifts from your circumstances to the season you're in changes your attitude amen man said he was over in Germany one time there was this painting he said I don't know want to contest something over in Germany he said it's just just this dark cloy gloomy clouds looks stormy looks ominous looks spooky brother it's it's like one of the Magic Eye pictures brother said he got you get close to the picture we get a little bit closer it's not spooky it's Angels beating their wings singing praises unto God singing hallelujah amen it looked scary it looked ominous when you get a little bit closer and look oh it's the blessings of the Lord yes and how many times in our own lives our biggest blessing was disguised as a trial right as something we just we couldn't get past it we're never going to make it it was the big the greatest blessing yet in our lives all your perspective amen when I got married my wife got a copy of it you've seen the cloud 1963 Life Magazine I me she's got the magazine you got I think it's jie Rockefeller in the next page and the moon beam stuff but the world saw that picture they didn't know what to make about it but we have a different perspective we know what season it is that means something to you and I because we understand the season that we're in you turn it this way that's our Lord up there oh my so much of our life I know this sounds a little cliche but it's true so much of our life is our attitude and our perspective towards it absolutely Daniel could have pouted he could have been discouraged he could have rung his hands in worried but he chose to look unto the Unseen he chose to look to God for understanding and when he saw what it was about he prepared himself he prepared his heart he prepared a people he prepared a nation amen yes praise the Lord B somebody asked him in questions and aners 1964 they asked him the question will the bride have Miracles and things now it's funny to me we we look at this all hindsight is the bride going to have Miracles and things said yeah it's going on right now like the bride didn't start in 19 it's it's been going on think about this well we see Miracles and things well if you look a little closer it's going on right now right amen it's it's it's amazing to me now now again it's just perspective I guess you know you talk to some people they're waiting for this great big thing they're waiting for this listen I see Miracles all the time I'm not just making I mean I've I've seen blinded eyes I've seen all kinds of things amen I'm not saying that to me whatever I'm saying it depends on what you're looking at if you're looking for a defeated attitude that's what you'll find but if you have an expectation for the coming Lord you have an expectation for the move of God you have an expectation for answered prayer that's what you're going to see amen your expectation will dictate what you see yeah amen if you expect great things from God guess what you're going to get great things from God I believe that amen amen listen not only can he meet your expectation he can do exceeding abundantly above what you could ask and think let's not put God in our box of our perspective and our discouragement and all these things amen people they were look this question's answer that I was talking about brother BR you know he was talking about this you know people looking for this great Big Revival they're going to empty out hospitals and do all this stuff amen but that's not the age that we're in right amen because even if that hat listen Maybe This is my opinion even if we go to the hospital right now we just empty it out they'll find some way to make it so they're not gonna oh man God is visit this people right because they don't make any money printing that exactly all there's to it praise the Lord true true they're looking for this thing and brother said that's Moses and Elijah they're going to shut the heavens up all this stuff amen but the bride is also having something right now amen she has Revival she's under the blood of Jesus Christ amen I believe there's Miracles going on listen you been here whether you realize not it's a miracle some of you all know what you come from it's a miracle you're here listen I should not be here today but God made a way for me and I'm here today by the grace of God amen amen the bright has thus sayith the Lord but she also knows what he wants done with it that's right she understands her day in the message and what she's supposed to do with it amen right praise the Lord Paul says this in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 he says but of the times and the seasons Brethren ye have no need that I write unto you amen you know what it's about probably everybody here today this is not your first time do we have any first-time visitors I should have asked at the beginning it's actually the time to ask anybody here doesn't know anything about the message okay we all know we understand we're living in the last times me telling you that's not something new to you you get it it's like thanks brother check that off we got it done of the times and Seasons you have no need that I write unto you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night notice for when they watch our watch our election promises the world today when they just say peace and safety peace is oh we're going to have security we're going to fix everything peace and safety when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them not me them amen as travail upon a woman with child they shall not Escape there's no two ways about that right they shall not Escape but but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief oh it's coming as a thief not for me not for you for them it is they don't know what hour the thief's come that's why they're not ready amen they're not looking for the coming of the Lord they scoff at it oh things have gone on since the time of our fathers he's slack concerning his promise no he's not listen he's never early he's never late he's always right on time amen you are not in darkness somebody say I'm not in darkness not in darkness you might be surrounded by but I'm not in darkness that that day should over take use of thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night praise God I am not of the night amen we are not of the night nor of Darkness therefore let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and be sober were there that sleep sleeping the night yes let's throw on the wrong kind of medication my doctor you all I know you all want to know about this my doctor put me on this uh this steroid for my elbow it's feeling really good but man I don't sleep at night like well that's not biblical he gives us BL to sleep sleep so I'm done with it now but they that sleep when do they sleep in the night they that are drunken are drunk in the night but let us who are of the day be sober can I say it this way conduct ourselves differently we're not conducting ourselves as the slumbering night people right amen we're not the third shifters yes we're the children of the day amen let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation for God hath not appointed us he has them but he's not appointed us unto wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him I really like this next verse wherefore Comfort yourselves together am we got to get together then when we do that we got to comfort each other just not just chew each other out all the time hey we're Children of the day amen praise God we're not asleep as others bless God we're going to make it we can my wife's going to get on me we can be encouraged today amen appar I end everything I'm too encouraging we can be encouraged today Comfort one another listen I'm so glad aren't you so glad we're not in darkness today we're not scratching our head stumbling around like drunkards of the day hallelujah we're sober we're Vigilant we're paying attention we know what it's about because God showed us amen Comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as you ALS even as also ye do Amen in other words you're doing a good job keep it up amen yes no matter what's going on just keep doing it amen keep comforting one another be reminded be encouraged today listen we're not of the night we're not in darkness there's a light and go in today amen we're not stumbling around we're not ignorant of it we know where we're at today Comfort yourselves with this Comfort yourselves in the knowledge that you know when you're living and you understand it amen The Book of Proverbs says a word spoken in due season how good it is I love this years ago when I first come to the Lord I read this and I I made this part of my prayer Isaiah says in Isaiah 50:4 the Lord God has given me the tongue of the learn that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary amen amen not to speak a a good knowledgeable intellectual theological word but a word in season you know I I don't know what it's going to look like on the other side as far as the perspective of it we know some of what it says but no matter what happened in this election back here this one coming up or politics or economy that's probably not what we're going to think about no when we make it over amen right man I remember that time the the Knicks lost that game we're not g to care about that who won the Super Bowl who did praise the Lord Ohio State Michigan maybe we'll lose again praise God that's okay cuz I'm I'm not on the team anymore way wearing my wearing my Michigan colors again I've come I've come for peace but you know what you might remember that kind word that somebody said to you when you were at your lowest point when you wanted to give up and somebody said something to you and encourage you that that's something that will last for eternity what you said to somebody else brother B said your attitude towards others can affect the Eternal destination of others think about that that's so much more power than the executive branch or the military a word just a kind word some of the some of the greatest things I've ever seen listen I've I've preached I've had the privilege of preaching sermons all kinds of different places in the world Amen I thank God for that I believe in preaching that's why we're doing this but sometimes the thing you remember most is that one person one time when you're at your lowest point and they just come say you know thank you so much I see what you do I see what you do for people it means something to me means something that'll stick with them the rest of their lives and we underestimate that am and that's real power amen Comfort one another with those we don't even recognize it amen but it means something over there amen our perspective is so skewed by the world that we live in what's what's really great brother mam said a great man makes you feel great that's why that's why I had you clap for yourself feel good about it great man makes you feel great amen I believe that's how the prophet was I believe how Jesus was listen Jesus could go to the lowest people and not make them feel lower and if anybody had the ability to do that it would have been him if anybody had a right to go to a woman caught in the act of adultery and put her down wa he without sin cast the first stone that's him he had the right did but when they all up said where's your accusers neither do I condemn the go and sin no more Hallelujah man we you just forgive me we we me we so underestimate that take it for granted power of a Kind word a word spoken in season can change a life can change a destination amen God now I'm going off the rails here for a second I've had the privilege preaching funerals too I've been to many funerals not so much a privilege but it's part of life you go to funerals and hopefully this isn't you but if it is you know if the shoe fits you go to a funeral and sometimes you got people there and like you know God bless you we're praying for you sorry and then there's people that have understanding they know more than everybody else they've got knowledge and they share with you well this is why this happened and you know how people are people say some of the dumbest things at funerals it's like why did you open your mouth you could have just stayed home we'd have been better help me out somebody you met people it's like why did you open your mouth they'll say a thing and you think I wish they'd never said it and that'll stick with you the rest of your life but not for the better help me out somebody listen I don't want to be that guy cuz that didn't help anybody I sit there and I say who did you think this was going to help who was this for no one and what it is so many times people they carrying well help me out somebody they're carrying this this baggage around listen listen that's how I was as a sinner I did it i' I've been that person you're just angry all the time you don't even know why you're angry anymore you live day from day you don't know what it's about you don't know why you're going through things you just mad you're mad at God you're mad at people you're mad at everybody after a while you're going to let him know you just project on everybody else well you're bad and you're bad and you deserve this true listen I don't want to live that way ever again cuz God didn't do that to me he didn't do that for you and I amen get sick and tired of being sick and tired said I don't want to live that way the joy of the Lord is my strength I've got something to live for amen and I want my words to be gracious words pleasant words that help the soul I don't want to be that guy that come you your lowest point and you're falling in the water like Peter I say well that's what you get you deserve it for doubting that's what you get Jesus could have done that he would have been in the right Peter didn't have a reason to doubt he looked at the circumstances he got discouraged he got fearful but Jesus didn't do that Jesus took him by the hand beautiful pulled him up amen when you understand your D's message that's why we're here yes let's help one another out cuz you're not going to get any help from out there so well the Lord can help people yeah you're his hands that's right and you're his feet and you're his voice if it's not you then who's it going to be that's right I don't want my words to be the thing I don't want your worri to be the thing that hindered somebody the Pharisees they had a key and they hindered those that would have went in and they didn't go in themselves I don't want to be that guy and I don't want that for my worst enemy I don't want that for them amen and I can say that as much sincerity as I can must from the bottom of my heart the person that's done me the most wrong the person been the mean I want I I I don't want an ill thing for them I I know the son with the older I get you know what I I do I find myself just feeling sorry for people more and more used to be I just get more and more mad at people they're stupid they're dumb why they're doing this what a horrible way to live yeah it is really is like I'm so much better than anybody else I look at this person their life's messed up they've made mistakes they failed God I'm thinking yeah and who am I who are any of us amen not for the grace of God well they deserve that they put themselves there still for sor every one of us deserves it that's every one of I'm not exempting neither are you that's every one of us and yet here we stand by the mercy of almighty God I just feel sorry for people amen says is the church book I don't have in front of me but he talks about people you know they they're ordained to wrath he says he says pity them that's what he says look at them as object objects of pity because one day they're going to be objects of God's Wrath man why would I want to put somebody through something they listen they've already going the wrong way but maybe maybe I could say something maybe you could say something that would change that yes listen listen anybody can destroy A Life That's not hard we've got a I wasn't going to get political got a guy in the White House can't remember where he's at half the time and at the push of a button he could kill billions or millions of people we train young men in our military and they know how to kill they can do it's not hard to take a life but to Save a Life change a life that's amazing that's real power yes it is Mercy is real strength Hallelujah Grace is real strength amen not the guy with the biggest muscles it's the guy who's got the bags in his knees cuz he's prayed for his family he's prayed for his church he's prayed for the Lost he sigh and cries for the Abominations that are done in the city God's people not just the hien God's Own people a flushing Prophet could look at God's people amen they got away from the word Lord caused them to blush caus be ashamed amen I can sit here and pick out this church did this and they preached this and that those are God's people I'm identified with their reproach let's pray for them let's pray for one another kindly affectionate as you stand to your feet brother Jackie Benton used to sing that song just to be I don't know the words so we're not pulling up you sing that song just to be blessing you know that's that's beautiful to me I don't know if I'm just getting simpler as I get older or what but just I don't know for me it's times kind Mellows my perspective a little bit I just it's what the best for people amen because God wants the best for us amen think about that God's never G us never given us second best we might not always like it but we find upon looking back it was always the best for us God's always been merciful to us he's been so gracious to us I would have fainted if I had not believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living amen I've got two stalkers I know that seems odd because I'm not that famous I've got two stalkers goodness and mercy they've followed me all the days of my life didn't realize it at first but they've been following me goodness and mercy Mercy when I wasn't looking for them when I wasn't after them they followed me all days of my aren't you so grateful for that am we are such a blessed people let's just let's just bow our heads once again Lord today as we look towards the events on the horizon we've been gifted by a prophetic voice in this age by the word of the Lord to to rise above the storms and all the clouds and to seea Beyond even the very curtain of time to a people that are waiting they've been reserved to obtain salvation under their Messengers under their days that your people will be gathered together in one to come back and Rule and Reign on this Earth Lord today it doesn't seem a fit place to rule over it certainly doesn't seem a fit place to hardly even live in but we know that the coming of the Lord will change all these things your Prophet said you right in every wrong and we believe that Lord that might not be this day today it may be it might be another day but no matter what it is Lord It's not a question of if but when amen and so may we in our light afflictions here remember that these things are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in US Lord that we've been ordained Lord does not appear to the world what shall be but we are the sons and daughters of God remade reborn in your likeness fashioned after your image reformed in your righteousness Lord I pray today for each one of us may we be mindful Lord if we would be mindful of a drop or two of your precious blood in a jar and a little charger how he would cherish that how he would preserve it how it would be dear to us yet today we stand here each one of us the very thing which that blood purchased the very thing which you you gave your life for Lord may we be ever so mindful of it may we be kind to one another kind to ourselves knowing that you thought we were worth it Lord you're you're so much better to us Lord than we could ever deserve you're the friend that sticks closer than a brother Lord we are so thankful today Lord I just commit these people into your hands Lord no doubt many situations that I am ignorant of different ones going through different things but may their hearts be stirred and reminded that it's all worth it in the end May our hearts be prepared always for the coming of the Lord not just getting ready but being ready knowing that the time is short the enemy the enemy recognizes his time is short the scripture declares he knows he has a short time if he can recognize it and the world can recognize it surely for our good we recognize the time is at hand Lord we welcome your return we invite you Lord we thank you even now for your spirit amongst us giving us life and Revelation bless your people
