with Eternity he's coming soon but with our thinking we need to be thinking in our thinking that he's coming soon all the time so we're always ready amen praise the Lord well we didn't get in any new requests as some of us are aware that we got a little update there about brother Marty's brother-in-law Andy we need to continue to pray for him even though there was no mass there nothing like that going on in his lungs we still need to be in prayer for him that God would just miraculously heal him and miraculously reveal himself to him and also to his wife marine I know our sister Kathleen brother Marty has spent many hours in prayer praying for them also for all their loved ones as we all have let's remember to pray for all of our loved ones those that are out of the Ark and safety those that are struggling to stay in the Ark let's be in prayer for our loved ones be in prayer for one another as things are hard I say spiritually for I believe not only our church but I'm here with other churches for them to stay tightly together and I just felt this warning come almost three months ago two months two to three months ago when this was transpiring what the enemy was going to try to do with this and and yes we're all continuing on our our with the Lord and our growth in the Lord but you know we're part of a body and there's a purpose for having a local body and that's for the burdens for one another and we don't want to lose that that love and burden and care for one another and I believe as we get on our knees and we're praying calling out one another's name that we'll we'll begin to feel something inside God will just say yes this is the one I want you to pray for and in inner seed because we need one another's prayer I need all of your prayers and I know that you feel that you need one another's prayer so let's let's be in prayer one for another let's continue to pray for complete healing for sister Ally and God would just bless ally and and and Jonathan and Brooke and Tyler just to be real spiritual parents husband and wife in the relationships and then also offer to raise their children it's it's it's nothing that you can wing you know there's just way too many difficulties and problems that happen in life and we just want God to become the center and the the the answer to every problem that they would have so let's continue to pray for this pray for brother sterling we didn't see him in our men's meeting but let's pray for him that God just continued to guide him and show him the way back to following the Lord with everything let's remember to pray for brother Dan we've been praying for him it's especially hard for him but let's pray that God would just bless and strengthen them you say some extra prayers for him I appreciate it pray for our sister Linda Helms God would just bless her and and I know that she has such a desire for hope and it's hold up her ministry there it's pray for brother Rogers a business pray for for his dad Bob let's continue to pray for sister Cheryl I know if you I talked to brother Bob just the other day brother Bob Crawford and he made mention he's he prays so many prayers for sister Sharell and I I know that if you lift her her name up in prayer she would very much appreciate there's always a need there and but God has been gracious to her and God I believe will continue to be until we're out of here let's stand together as remember to pray for our offering today that God would bless and and and multiply it to meet all the needs and and that God would just bless you as he promised in his word to to bless his people amen our dear Heavenly Father as we come to you today Lord we are grateful that you're a prayer answering God and Lord there's need that we haven't made mention that there's unspoken upon the hearts of your people Lord your mission here is many needs father those that are are still fighting the covent 19 Lord on the front lines what Lord America's beginning to identify as

praise the Lord by faith were going to receive revelation tonight amen because God promised it amen God promised where the carcass is there will the eagle's be gathered together and the Lord Jesus he promised to feed the hungry to fill the thirsty to supply the needy men turn with me if you would to the book of Saint Matthew chapter 24 and there's been a little thought that's been I guess on my notes for Oh quite a while now and just waiting for the right the right time and it's about the the bride receiving all of God's atonement and we're going to be getting into that we're just going to be starting a little a little series on being ready for the coming of the Lord it really involves more than what we think and I just it's some of it I just want to make us aware of course the thought about being ready that's something that we can always be provoked to double-check the question are we ready but we want to get into something maybe that we haven't quite seen and on hopefully in doing that will provoke us with a little bit more energy to do everything that we can to be ready for the coming of the Lord and so we want to entitle this be being ready but for a subject we want to talk about the difference between getting ready or being ready for the rapture and so there is a difference between getting ready and being ready and in these scriptures that we're going to read we're going to see here that Jesus told us to be ready we got to get to the point where we're ready amen so let's just bow no word of Prayer before we begin reading and just ask God to bless this to us Heavenly Father we love your word we love you we thank you for so great a salvation in her life Lord you've you've saved us through justification you've cleaned our our life up to the power of the Holy Ghost and sanctification and Lord you have filled us with your Holy Spirit and God we're wanting to be so sure that we're full of your spirit enough that we know that we're ready for your coming pray as we go through this series Lord that you would open our eyes to the things that you want us to see and father maybe we have heard some of these things but they've never been revealed nor we're looking to you would you reveal them to us Lord Lord opened the eyes of our heart and help us to see things the way that you see them Lord bless the reading of this word and the message and the things that we would refer to Lord we just committed on to your hands and trust that you'll give us the revelation that we have Nita for this hour give you the praise for it for we humbly ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen turn with me if you would to st. Matthew chapter 24 starting with verse number 42 watch therefore for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come but know this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief were to come he would have launched and would have not suffered his house to be broken up therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as you think not the Son of man cometh I want to read that one more time before we read verse 45 therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as you think not the Son of man cometh who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord have made ruler over his household to give him meat in due season amen god bless you may be seated amen I want to read start off by reading a quote that brother Branham had in the message God hiding himself in simplicity and then get to maybe some points of interest that we're gonna try to hit through this series but brother Branham said you know these things the time is at hand Church the time is at hand don't don't don't wait any longer now this was back in 63 well we can't say that was brother random that had to be God in brother Branham the time is still at hand the time is more hand now he said don't don't don't wait any longer see he says how do you know the rapture is not going on all the time wow what an eye-opener right there first thing you know it it'll be past one disappears here and there it'll be gone the first thing you know and judgment will strike the world and you'll say well I thought this it's too late now remember they didn't know it until the day they entered into the ark and then it was too late the foolish virgin didn't know until she come back and found the wise virgin gone then she was left for the Tribulation Period now no good teacher belief at the church goals through the tribulation I just want us I'm going to just stop there for a second please when brother branham and we're going to see this here brother branham sometimes refers to the church as the bride and sometimes he refers to it as not the bride but just the church and remember all the church that came out of Egypt did not go into the promised land so they were all God's people they were all the church but there was just the chosen the elected that went into the promised land so and we'll try to make that as clear as anything when we're going through it no good teacher believes that the church goes through the tribulation but not the bride see not the bride just the church goes through the tribulation the church goes through for purification sure under the sixth seal right Israel does the same thing for the 144,000 but not the bride amen the bride is forgiven missus think about it the bride is forgiven she goes straight to glory in a rapture that's right she my opinion the last member will be caught up one of these days it might come and you won't even know nothing about it remember it's a secret secret he says two secrets secret secret touching away he'll come in an hour when you think not you won't know nothing about it and she'll be gone it'll be too late then tell some points of interest here brother branham said the bride's forgiven does that mean that the church isn't forgiven why does he make that statement the bride's able to go in a rapture because she's forgiven well what about the rest of the church are they not forgiven this is what I want to get into this great subject about receiving the full atonement the fullness of Calvary and not just a part of it so some other points of interest that we're going to be getting into and I hope you there be a wit okay with you if we we take your time and have it more of a teaching rather than a preaching the rapture is a complete secret complete secret such a secret that in the midst of the church God is dividing between the two sets of believers the bride in the church the same word is being preached but he's revealing to the one but not to the other there revelation of what's required of God in order to be ready so here we are if God says this is what you we need to do to be ready whatever it would be let's just I I don't mean to be too silly but if God said what we need to do is is hold this pen to be ready the devil would be simply saying well you know as you gotta do is put your pocket or all you have to do is make sure it's near you or or that that is on something you possess and so he's always trying to misinterpret what God is really meaning and so this the in the revelation of what God is saying is so crucial for the rapture so it always being prayer Lord give me the revelation of what's being said so I don't I don't miss it and it's okay that when you pray it you still feel you don't got it you keep praying you keep laying it before the Lord you keep believing now it's not something that we work up to but it's certainly nothing you can be just casual about and says well I'm bride I'll get it when I'm ready I don't think it's going to work like that because this quote that brother Brandon saying it that he's he's hid in simplicity it's going to be a secret catching away and then telling us to be ready what are we gonna do to be ready it's not just saying we're ready things we have to do brother branham also makes mention and the question he says that the rapture is already in progress which means secretly the bride is getting ready while the foolish virgins are sleeping away their opportunity to get ready or they're waiting for the preaching or something like that to actually motivate them the rapture is in progress I mean if you were gonna go to to Cedar Point or someplace like that you were gonna get on a ride you you know like you get on a carousel and you pay you go through the gate and everybody gets on their their little horse there you know it's not moving yet because it's in a standstill place and the open the other people got to get off the new people got to get on and when everybody's on then that carousel or that ride begins to go and it's in progress and brother branham saying how do you know that rapture is not going on right now it's not in progress right now there's important things that are going on and this is for the bride hey man this message is for the bride and we just want to to be readying them so how do we know that we're ready another point of interest we're gonna get into how do we know where that we're we're ready ready we're living in in perilous times where a deception is all around us it's it's heavy duty that the whole church is is is is being deceived by by Satan every chance he can many believers feel that what's required of them that is is that they all say have to do is be in in the message of the hour or all they got to do is is have the holy ghost in reality justification and sanctification is is though is also a portion of the Holy Ghost brother Branham so maybe it's just not being associated with the denomination so we can see here being ready can really string off in a number of different areas and you know how it's it's just humanity that people want about it gravitate to something as an evidence like speaking in a tongues now I know that I'm going right III I've done this or my name is on the book I belong to this church it's like they got to be able to identify something natural get it over with and so it's done and I don't believe being ready as anything like that it's nothing like that because if it was Jesus were to just said that in other words if all you had to do was speak in tongues you wouldn't have to worry about somebody breaking into your whole mess or you wouldn't have to worry about watching your home you wouldn't have to worry about being ready because you had right so another point of interest is both the bride and the church will have to be purified the bride will be purified before the rapture the bride before the rapture is forced to be purified through self will the church after the rapture is forced to be purified through tribulation against her will and those are the difference but both the bride and the church has to be purified and we're going to get deeper into that we're gonna we're gonna get deeper into them it's true and I love this part of the quote and I got like so many pages of quotes we're not hardly going to get to any but brother Branham makes mention in a number of our quotes that Christ went to Calvary and paid the price for the bride the difference is the bride receives all of the atonement the church does not but the bride still has to become purified and it's through self will you deny your flesh and we're gonna please get into it just I guess at this point you're gonna have to put that one on the Shelf if you're not a hundred percent on board with that one now there is a difference between getting ready and being ready and Jesus never said spend your time getting ready he just said be ready be ready Jesus warns us and admonishes us to be ready all the time for his return even though we look at the rapture as a single event the requirement is to be ready before that event so we look at the raptures of is a is it is it is a catching away is a one moment be ready in that moment catch away and it's gonna happen one of the dangers in viewing the rapture as a single event is the tendency of making more light of it an example of this we look at it as one event in other words the one event isn't here yet it hasn't happened so I don't need to worry about it I don't need to deal with it presently because it's not here it's it's there in the future thus causing a spirit of slothfulness laziness lukewarmness to set in because it's over there and that's why I really like what brother Branham said we're the rapture is in process right now and another example is because it's this single event and the Prophet thought it would happen before right he made mention when he thought it couldn't go any longer than a certain date and if we look at it as a a single event thus causing a spirit of unsureness with us on awareness of when it's going to be thus opening the door to the lord delayeth his coming and saying where is the promise you know this is what the Prophet said where is it I thought it was supposed to be so both of these these this thought process of the rapture being out there really takes away from us living in a ready state for the Lord and that's really what the requirement is for the rapture is living ready amen it's living ready so if we view the rapture as a long multi-stage series of events that culminate into a final touching away will be more like to have the tendency to always be ready before the finality of the rapture so it really opens our eyes spiritually to be looking at and I hope it does by the time this series is done that we begin to look everyday for the rapture more and to be looking about getting ready and what do I have to do what is this what is this this part of the that where's the chain of the event that that's where I'm supposed to be today what am I supposed to be working on to get ready Jesus gives us the most important structions when he tells us to be ready all the time for his return the only thing we have to do is be ready but be ready all the time God will take care of everything if we're ready just be ready if we're not ready we would not be able to take off and win the race for example when a race is getting ready to begin and all of us have been in races even if it was in school when we're getting ready to to do a race I don't care if it's a sprinter or or what it is usually you hear something like this get ready get set go it's like one two three or we might here on the mark get set go so the second to get set and go remain the same but the first two is interchangeable get ready ready means on the mark get ready is the same as on the mark get on the mark get ready press what was Paul mean when he's saying I pressed towards the mark getting to that place that I'm ready to go not that I have attained he said but he was pressing towards that if we were going to do a race if I was going to do a race and I was gonna have to run a mile and it had to be you know less than a half hour well I wouldn't be ready enough to like prepare and practice and and get get to a place where I could even get up to the line and says ready get ready get set be ready so it's not something that you can just walk up to the rapture and say I'm ready there's we have to get ready before we are ready so there is a prize for the high calling of God in Christ Jesus and we got to get on the mark you're on the mark that means you're not walking around stretching anymore you're not just you know doing one of these things and trying to get ready for no you're you're on the mark you're ready to go and this is what our goal should be every day for the rapture is is be right there on the mark ready to go we need to be pressing in all the time to get ready or be ready for the Lord's return turn with me to first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 5 did I say first 5 I haven't saved verse 15 first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 15 for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the trumpet of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be at the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words amen wonderful wonderful and this is what Jesus wanted us to be ready for was this return now why do you think Jesus was telling his disciples in the people of that time and he also allowed the people in the first church age second church age and third search age to all think that Jesus could be come in any anytime soon here we need to be ready and there's going to be a kitchen away we're not all going to sleep in and and it's going to be we're going to be caught up why would allow that to go through all the church ages why did he say why did he just say at the end there's gonna be a catching away right why didn't he just say that because it would not accomplish what God wants to see in his bronde because he's got a bride in every age and they're asleep he's also got there's a church in every age - and there's a bride and those that got ready lived ready died ready we'll race together amen so it's not about this single event because everybody else in the other 6 Church ages didn't have that one single event happen in their life but they still had the same requirement that Jesus was giving and that's to be ready and this really opens the door for us understand the importance of the rapture is not just that single event but that the rapture is happening right now around us it's perhaps something we're not thinking about much something that we're not provoked much to think about because you get Scott so many things going on in our life and now we're kind of wondering what's going to happen in the world and will we ever get back to normal and a lot of crazy stuff but the Lord wants us in tune with him about the rapture that's taking place right now so brother Branham said that the Lord does all of these three and we know this reference verse 16 the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice and with the Trump now brother Ram told us that that shout was the message that calls the bride together to get them ready okay that's all we have to do is write there the voice of the Archangel is the voice of the resurrection for the sleeping bride amen because not all are awake right now all of them awake just the bride and then the trumpet of God calls us together those that are sleep and those which are alive to the marriage supper in the sky now that's what that scripture is now we don't have to worry about that those that are dead in know those that are bright it was that are sleeping excuse me unless the Lord does determine to use those which are alive to call them which are asleep that's very possible I don't know I'm not making a doctrine but it will be that if that happens it will be the war through the bride for sure but nevertheless we don't make that call for the marriage supper and and we and ourselves don't have to worry about making that call for the the the the the dead in Christ or the bride that's sleeping as he said it but we do have to worry about being ready together and this message is what brings us together we're where we need to be can you say amen amen I wish you're all here told you this is going to be more of a of a study all right and getting ready for this big race you're you're racing number one against yourself part of you is racing against part of you it's not my brother or my sister o Lord but it's me that's standing in the need of prayer you're racing against yourself so it really doesn't matter where everybody else is at they that compare themselves with them Celsus unwise anyways what we need to be paying attention to is who you're racing against you the spirit man is racing against you the natural man it's the black dog and the white dog as we heard the story the spiritual man is winning as long as he suffocates the natural man because honestly you can't take the natural man and kill him today and he's going to be dead tomorrow you may be successful at putting them under your feet today and in crucifying the flesh and brother Marty brought out a wonderful study in the men's meeting about the will of God was always if you were going to do the will of God it will always be including suffering because the old man has to die out in order for the will of God to be done because this old man just ain't going to let the will of God be done it just doesn't it wants popularity it wants it wants to uses his influence at once Mussoorie it wants to go the easy path it doesn't want to serve others it wants others to look at them and say look what I done Irv I achieved and the spirit man has to suffocate the natural man so he can't do though so he can't perform he can't act like that he doesn't have that character anymore or that lack of character anymore to to do that and unfortunately it's an everyday affair and that's why he say the spirit man is winning if he's suffocating the the natural man or the carnal man now the natural man is winning as long as he is allowed to live I'm just gonna make it that clear the natural man is winning in your race as long as he's allowed to go on crusade untouched if he's allowed to have his way if it's like there's nothing I need to do well he's basically having his way and there's not a way that we're actually ready for the rapture with that type of attitude every day you know we we slip while we make mistakes and yes I understand that but I'm talking about we're trying we're gonna get into something forward we're going to try to fine-tune what it means to be ready first Corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 and this this whole this whole message they maybe end up being a foundation first Corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize and Paul saying here so run that ye may obtain don't just well I'm bride you know I'm there I'm let no we have something to do we've got to run that we may obtain not I've already attained I don't need to run so we haven't attained to something and Paul talked about that there in Philippians not that we have attained but I pressed towards the mark kind of saying a similar thing here in the 1st Corinthians chapter 9 he says so run that ye may obtain now you can't obtain sitting around and saying Jesus ran the race for me you can't do that Jesus paid it off you can't do that yes he paid it all he he paid the price but we still have to overcome this less we still have to win the race we still have to press towards the mark now every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate all things that they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible crown I therefore so run so he's making a declaration this is what I'm doing in the race um running I have a purpose I'm not sitting around I'm not just sitting around waiting for the rapture to happen I'm not sitting around just waiting for that that a combination event to happen in the catching away I'm not doing that I'm running running I'm running now this flesh is trying to run with me he's trying to get his way he's trying to do his will instead of having God's well done further Marty we'll probably late this message because he is talking about the will of God and we can see the tying in here this suffering right here he says I therefore so run not as uncertainly sulfide a not as one that beateth the air there's no unsureness with Paul there was no why hope I you know hope this is the right thing to do to be ready to hit the rapture no he says but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection and that's the main thing I want to say lest by any means when I preach to others I just I myself should be a castaway Paul was running with confidence and with purpose he said I'm fighting to buff it my body and to bring it into bondage now that's exactly what that means when he says but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection what it really means is that word Buffett means to strike against to push repeatedly and bring it into bondage he brought his body under the bondage of course is suffering of course it of course it was an enjoyable thing for his flesh to do but that's the only way you can run the race with surety and confidence you don't want them you know as a when you're with a child and you're playing a game I used to play chess with my sons play ball run there's a lot of things you could do to maybe compete with somebody and oftentimes just running against a female well I would you know you you got an upper hand so when you know you got to upper hand what somebody but you want to make the race interesting well then you let them kind of catch up you let them you know make it interesting as it were you do not want to make the race with your flesh interesting it never works out it he just hangs you out to dry and you're behind and so we need to strike against the flesh we need to push repeatedly against it that's why Jesus said die daily and bring it think about this into bondage bring your flesh to a place where it wants to get out and have its way but you don't let it this is the place to be to be ready if we're letting that flesh just roam and kind of do things that really shouldn't be doing are we really ready a lot of people don't like this kind of race they like a race that it's a sprint okay I'll repent I'll get baptized and I'm part of the body they like a race they they can split real hard one time but they're not for pushing repeatedly they're not for continuing to strike up that flesh and say you're no good this race is an endurance race it's not a sprint jesus said in Matthew 24:13 he says but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved it's such a powerful statement because when Paul is talking to the unconverted or Peters talking to the unconverted he just says repent be baptized for the remission of your sins you're gonna receive the Holy Ghost you're going to be saved they they're calling the name of the Lord shall be saved they believe in their heart and confess with their mouth and so when we're introducing the plan of salvation it's in a way that here are the the criteria that you do for for salvation but then as you get deeper to the scriptures when you read statements like today is the day of salvation not back then today is on he that endured to the end the same shall be saved we cannot just look at something in the past some sprint in the past and say that's good enough when Jesus is teaching us in this very very same chapter about being ready so the spirit man has to suffocate the natural man to strike against a push repeatedly in order to grow in the love of Christ to overcome and develop the character that we need to make it out of here or to go on a rapture hebrews chapter 12 verse number 1 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside most of the weights that we have every weight and not only the weight I love how he separates us and the sin so there's maybe certain things there that we wouldn't identify as outright sin but they're our weight and they will turn into sin sure sure is anything and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that set before snow sprint it's a longevity race it's an endurance race and he's saying if you don't if you don't crucify the old man if you don't suffocate the old man if if you allow things to creep in because that's how they happen creep in slow into your life what will happen is it will be set you in the race it'll put you behind it's no longer I'm going by the grace of God by the time we're done with this it's not gonna be well I'm in the message that's it I'll be good enough it's not gonna work it's not gonna work it's not just being in the message it's where are you in the race that's worth that where are you in the race are you be set or you upfront are you running or you just kind of beat in the air just uncertain where you're at in the race you know where you're at when you're crucifying the flesh you're praying through you're pressing towards the mark you're in love winning souls for Jesus Christ you know where you're at with em you know where you're at it's just when you left the foot your pedal but your foot off the pedal and you begin to glide brother Graham said you take the oars out of the out of the boat and you just you're not working hard against the current because maybe the wind is strong and it's getting hard and you just need a break and before you know it the sin the weights are be setting us and then we're wondering where the victor is at where are the joys that where the where the peace is that where are the things that come from being where you need to be with Christ no matter what furnace you're going through no matter what lion's den you're in no matter what fish you're in God is there to to meet every internal need that we would have in this church of on earth amen praise the Lord all right so God has called us out of the world and he has set this race before us and it's up to us to choose how we're gonna run it run it whatever pace you want run how often you want it but Paul was trying to tell us to run it with everything we got Amen lay aside that weights and just you know how easier it would be to run if we lost twenty pounds it would be so cool we'd just better run faster and feel better well so it is you know what's in we got to lay that aside and and run the race looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher afraid I love that now he's taking us from the beginning when we when we got saved when we thought we got saved if I could say like that one repented gave her heart to Christ and we went around at that point and we said i'm saved i'm saved i'm saved we didn't go around at that point and say you know what i was saved before the foundation of the world we didn't do that i came afterwards after we had more knowledge and understanding but here paul is saying we're looking not only to the author but the finisher he that endureth to the end so that rapture are are the process of being ready were in that right now amen looking unto Jesus the author and fish for a faith who for the joy that was set before him he endured his suffering and that's what we have to do when we look that we gotta suffocate this old man suffocate his will not let him get away with what he wants to where's the straight to do that the strength is in the joy of the Lord the joy of the Lord is our strength praise God just fall in love with them spend more time with them share Jesus with somebody you know I understand that we can't bring anybody churches we're not even gathered at a church but you could be inviting them to the live streaming you really could what it what a joy that would give can can I just go way off grid right now a brother sent me this quote today and I just want to read it I didn't get it I didn't print I wasn't going to read it but it just came to my heart it's an a message brother random preach convinced and concerned he said he had his home paid for just like we do today that's the first thing we think about is pay for a home he said that's good you ought to that's right but there's something ought to come before that it's God first the going on of the church it's every man's duty in this church right here to see that the thing goes on right and you put your force to it to bring every man every woman every boy every girl that you can in the streets in the hedges and the byways to bring them into the church well I'll tell you what if you're doing that you got the joy of the Lord I mean all heaven rejoices over one soul the joy of the Lord is our strength and unfortunately the joy that that we feel sometimes that we get in the world from things going just right our way is really only a temporal thing because the joy that I'm talking about is the joy that you can receive when you're in the middle of a trial and things are not going your way and you're not getting what you want but something inside of you gives you such strength that you can tell the old man the flesh you're not having your way you're not you're not gonna talk like that you're not gonna act like that you're gone you're dead I'm suffocating you and God is gonna get the glory through my life today amen I love that all right let's finish reading that looking unto Jesus the author fish for our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God all right where does that put us that puts us at revelations chapter 3 verse 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my throne even as I also overcame and set down with my father in his throne now we have a chance to sit together with Jesus on the throne right next to him but there's something we have to do we have to overcome and we have to overcome all things and when you overcome your flesh you've overcome all things because that's your enemy that's what stands in the way of if that's what will stand in the way of everyone missing the rapture everyone that misses the rapture their flesh got in the way those that did not go on like that in Matthew 25 that the ten virgins the five that didn't go on and get the oil what stood in their way their flesh because it takes a real dying out a real craving a real hunger a real thirsty a real I need this for the Holy Ghost sometimes it does now if you just believe will be it unto me according to thy word Lord it can come without sensation absolutely it can but the thing is if your flesh is in the way don't expect it to happen we we have to purify ourselves we're going to get into this and I hope you can maybe remember this as we go on to the next parts of it so you know me I have a kind of a tendency of Reap repeating some of these things but we have to overcome not just certain things but we have to overcome all things right verse 22 now he that have an ear let him hear what the Spirit is saying unto the church and this is this is where we're at today we're we're the church and we're praying I'm praying God give me an ear to hear what you're saying to the church and if we're all praying God give me that ear I believe we're going to be more likely to hear because the Spirit of Laodicea the other the spirit of the church not the bride now but the Spirit of the church is so strong it's in need of nothing it doesn't feel it needs an ear it's already gotten here it's it's attitude is different and therefore they never get ready now the devil has a lot of interpretations of what it means to be ready what it means to have overcome and be ready for the rapture some believe if they're no longer a part of a denomination they're no longer a part of a man-made system they kind of came out of that that they they're ready some feel if you don't take the mark of the beast if you don't take 666 that they're ready not realizing that this is the number of man's will and everybody's stuck with it everybody's facing a will in their flesh they're called they're man's well the natural will and brother branham said he made it real clear the mark of the beast is not to receive the seal the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost is God's will in a person's life and we can not be part of a denomination we can not receive the number six six anything injected in us or and our forehead or in a hand but yet have a will of our own even though we're against the the system the them trying to inject things in us or the government or the denominations or the world console churches but yet still hold on to you we'll see how it's so slick so slick we need the CEO of God and not just a portion of the Holy Ghost think the biggest interpretation of what it means to be ready is I'm in the message I honestly think that for us that is the biggest misinterpretation of what it means to be ready not realizing that the message has to be in us living out of us to perform the will of God the majority of the devil's interpretations possess a portion of truth making it difficult to write to define it so we want to take a look at this not so much in a black-and-white way but we want to look at it where the black and white come and they meet as close as we can I'm going to call this the borderline were the borders of the to meet and try to identify that a little bit more so we want to recognize basically borderline believers first of all I want us to think of remember this when we're thinking about a borderline believer the first thing is that they are believers they are believers they believe just like the bride does up to the point of the border up to the point of the border they believe just like everybody else so when you're you're comparing them on this side of the Holy Ghost or this side of the promised land you can't tell the difference they believe in Jesus Christ they believe in going to church they believe in paying their ties they they believe in so many things that you believe in but they stopped at the border all the way up to the border they believe just as much as the complete full gospel believer believes you can't tell them apart until they get to the border now there are certain believers who refuse to cross over into the promised land they refuse to cross over that border because they visualize themselves as a grasshopper now I'm talking about their nature the nature inside of them is so strong they just don't feel they could circum it or overcome it I should say so they visualize themselves as a grasshopper unable to overcome their flesh they refuse to cross over the line of complete surrender that's what the line is were you completely surrender you remember when when the spies went over and they spied out the land 10 of those spies said it's a beautiful land there's no doubt about God don't lie but the other side of their mouth said we can't do it unless God goes and does it for us like he did Egypt we can't do it and God didn't say he was gonna do it for him he's gonna take he's gonna get the Giants out of there we they had to do it they had to do it by faith walking in that God was going to be with them but they viewed their enemy as a so big of a problem that they visualize that they themselves look like a grasshopper in the sight of a big person and so they were scared they were afraid they were afraid to go over the border because once they crossed over and they said let's go let's go after them they knew it was gimme death or give me liberty they knew they knew that was it there was there was no coming back either you overcame or they overcame you and they were afraid they didn't want to make that decision they didn't want to go over there and take a chance of being slaughtered and so they wanted to serve God on this side of self-denial of self surrender a self crucifixion they did not want to surrender their life to go take the lamb of course Joshua and Caleb they were of another spirit that totally sold out to God they surrendered to God they believed that God in them was more than able to take the land and when you believe that God in you is more than able to take care of the the flesh that you're dealing with you can run with confidence you know you're not one that beateth the air you're not just playing but you mean business and there is the difference between the bride and the church the bride goes over the border they they that that that lying that border line is they totally surrender everything to God they surrender everything to God they're there they given up their life they're not scared anymore they they've already died they died to their will so they have sought confidence now that God inside of them is going to take him through and what's on the other side of the promised land Galatians 5:22 love joy peace longsuffering gentleness meekness temperance faith against such there is no law that's what awaits the believer and I'll tell you when you got the love of God in your heart I mean it's the love of God it's no longer the John Martin love but it's truly the love of God when that love is shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Ghost I don't care how many times they slap your face I don't care what they do to you I don't care how much they use you something inside of you is so full of love that you would give it out again and give it out again and give it out again the joy is inside of you no matter what you go through you got peace not as the world giveth but everything's gonna be just right just get it just right okay settle down okay okay okay ah peace know the peace we're talking about is just a storm everywhere but something inside that's the Holy Ghost that's the promised land that's a fruit that's a fruit that's part of the flowing with milk and honey part so as we get into this study more we're gonna kind of fine-tune that line a little bit better so we can see I don't want seyton lying to anybody which he will but i want to uncover those lies and let the bride to see where we need to be what we need to do so we can be ready when he comes that's my goal that's my desire that's that's all my my heart amen now I'm just gonna be just a few few minutes if I could our goal is to be ready to cross over to the promised land to fight the good fight of faith to to lay hold of eternal life to take the kingdom by force and the only way to be ready is to allow the Lord to set over you to set over your household as he said in verse 45 of our opening scripture therefore be also ready for in such an hour she think not the Son of man cometh who is then a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord have made him who made ruler over his household to give him me due season when you allow the Lord to rule your house that's how you know you'll be ready that's a faithful and a wise servant Amen all right think on that I'm gonna give you this last quote for tonight and then we're gonna close in prayer this is taken from a questions and answers and the question is asked after the bride is raptured will any of the foolish virgin be saved or will they be lost brother Branham says no with an exclamation point there will be in other words no foolish virgins save but we're gonna try to right neither bind that as we read this but let me read the quote no see everything will be finished for the Gentile church when the bride is taken from the earth the Spirit of God leaves the earth he that's Phil his filthy still he that's righteous is righteous still he that's holy is holy still in other words the sanctuary becomes smoky where the attorney stands to plead the case Christ leaves the sanctuary his day of mediate a mediator is over the rapture comes he leaves from the sanctuary goes forth and takes the book of Redemption and claims everything he's redeemed there's no more mediator work how many understands that I've got that I'm one of the seals yes the seals I believe that Christ comes forth to claim his mediator work now just a minute he goes back to the question will the foolish virgin be saved again he says no whatever happens happens now now I want you understand this if a person is saved he saved before the rapture whether he's Church or whether he's bride but the man said they will be coming to church after the rapture coming up the alter thinking they're getting saved but they won't be able to so when brother Branham answers this question with the foolish virgin with her beanie for the Virgin save he's referring to will there be he's answering no meaning that all salvation to the Gentiles was done prior he's not saying that those that were foolish version will not be saved now listen know whatever happens happens after that she's in the state now she will have to go through tribulation period and the reason of it is now catch this is because she has rejected the atonement in its fullness she's a believer a professed believer but she'll have to go through the tribulation period now when I heard this statement a couple months ago the reason that she doesn't go on the rapture is because she didn't she rejected the atonement the fullness I got to thinking about that Calvary was where our Tolman was made Jesus gave himself and if you if you believe it with your heart you confess it the blood of Jesus Christ washes you and you're saved but there's more that is required of every person if that's all you do is do that you won't make it to bride because you're still rejecting part of the atonement the atonement the full atonement is for the bride if you come short of the full atonement if you reject the full atonement then how can you be ready to make a rapture I just want you to I want to end with that I want you to ponder these thoughts because when I read this every believer that accept Jesus Christ as their Savior to me has accepted the toment right the blood but there's more to it than that there's more to it to that and that's kind of what we want to get into in this series amen if you would maybe you just pray together and just ask God to help us as we study these things and and and and and leave from your heavenly Father we want to thank you for you in her lives and we want to thank you for the Holy Spirit that has promised to lead us and to guide us into all truth we thank you for sending a messenger in this age to help us all bow to see clearly where would we be Lord you said unless I come and smite the earth with a curse God but you sent a prophet to help get your bride ready let's see that lies in their Lord as much as i and i trust others feel this way same way that I'm your bride I feel Lord that there's things needing in my life to be ready I believe that's why you've you've brought us deeper into this this subject maybe not taking it so much an evangelistic away too but more in a teaching way too to help us see that we're in a rapture every single day Lord as we go through this study in the series what if it would be your will if we'd continue lord I just ask that you would quicken these things to us make them real to us give us revelation of them help us to receive the fullness of what you have offered we don't want to leave anything behind we don't want to leave part of the Tollman behind we want to accept it not reject it not just take the part that saves us but we want to take the part that makes you Lord of our life for thou art worthy we'll recommit ourselves into your hands now take all of Lord each and every one that has heard this message God your bride may you quicken your word to each and every one of us Lord and we give you the praise for these things father for we humbly ask it in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen praise the Lord can
