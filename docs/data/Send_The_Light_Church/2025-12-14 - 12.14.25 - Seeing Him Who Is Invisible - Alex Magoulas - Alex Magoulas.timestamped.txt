[0:06] THESE GUYS ARE GETTING TOSSED IN FLAMES.
[0:10] They're like, "WE'RE NOT BACKING UP
[0:12] ANYHOW."
[0:13] &gt;&gt; LOOKED RIGHT AT THAT KING. LOOKED RIGHT
[0:15] AT NEBUCHADNEZZAR.
[0:17] SUPPOSED TO LOOK RIGHT AT PHARAOH. IT
[0:19] DOESN'T MATTER. I'm doing it anyhow.
[0:22] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID SO. GOD SAID IT. I BELIEVE IT.
[0:25] AND THAT SETTLES IT. AMEN.
[0:28] &gt;&gt; We just give up to, you know, Well,
[0:30] praise the Lord.
[0:34] Well,
[0:36] [laughter]
[0:37] I'm trying to think how to not throw
[0:39] everybody under the bus here.
[0:42] You know,
[0:44] Brother Bam talks about stubbornness.
[0:46] It's not of God. And stubbornness is
[0:49] just perseverance that's not submitted
[0:51] to God. Amen. When it comes to serving
[0:54] God, we'll we will lack perseverance. We
[0:58] get wishy-washy. We have a little
[1:00] trouble. Well, I can't go to church. I
[1:01] can't pray. I can't do this. We we BUT
[1:04] YOU KNOW WHAT? IF IF you like a Oh,
[1:06] praise the Lord here. If you were a
[1:07] drinker in the world and you like TO
[1:11] DRINK, GUESS WHAT? You might not have a
[1:13] dime in the bank.
[1:15] Let me ask somebody. YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE
[1:18] TO BEG AND YOU'LL FIND A WAY. AMEN. AND
[1:21] IF YOU WERE A SMOKER, YOU IF YOU LIKE
[1:22] ROCK MUSIC AND you want to go to that
[1:24] concert and YOU ONLY SLEPT TWO HOURS,
[1:26] YOU DON'T GOT A DIAMOND, YOU'LL BEG AND
[1:28] BORROW AND STEAL. YOU WON'T LET NOTHING
[1:30] STOP YOU FROM GETTING WHAT YOU WANT
[1:32] because you want it. IF WE WANTED GOD
[1:34] THE WAY WE wanted the world when we were
[1:35] in the world, WE'D HAVE AS MUCH OF GOD
[1:37] AS WE COULD GET. THERE'S NO LIMIT to it.
[1:40] AMEN. THE PROBLEM IS NOT GOD HOLDING
[1:42] BACK ON US. IT'S THAT WE DON'T WANT IT
[1:44] BAD ENOUGH.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; WELL, if I HEAR FROM GOD, I GUESS I HOPE
[1:49] IT WORKS OUT. And if I don't, I'll go on
[1:51] WITH MY LIFE. NO, I FOR MYSELF. AMEN. I
[1:53] had to hear from God or I was dying.
[1:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like Paul already talked
[1:58] about he's praying that field. HE SAID,
[2:00] "GOD, YOU GIVE ME THE HOLY GHOST." HE
[2:01] SAID, "IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME THE HOLY
[2:03] GHOST, THERE'S GOING TO BE A PILE OF
[2:04] BONES HERE. WHEN YOU COME BACK, I'M NOT
[2:06] MOVING. I'M NOT GIVING UP.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; WE GIVE UP SO EASY."
[2:12] &gt;&gt; AND GOD NEVER ONCE GAVE UP ON US.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE. LOOK AT OUR
[2:17] OFFENSE. LOOK AT OUR WRETCHEDNESS. Look
[2:20] at OUR FAILURE
[2:22] IN FRONT OF A HOLY [screaming] GOD
[2:24] &gt;&gt; WHO'S NEVER SINNED. HE KNOWS EVERYTHING
[2:26] ABOUT HE KNOWS YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW
[2:27] YOURSELF.
[2:29] HE HAS EVERY [screaming] REASON TO GIVE
[2:30] UP ON US. BUT HE'S NEVER ONCE given up
[2:34] ON YOU AND I. HE'S NEVER LEFT YOU. HE'S
[2:36] NEVER FORSAKEN YOU. HE'S NEVER TURNED
[2:39] you down.
[2:41] We're the ones that give up.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; Well, that's all extra there. I don't
[2:47] put that addendum in the book later.
[2:52] Brother Ram said that when God when he
[2:54] was talking about Moses and he met God
[2:56] at that burning bush, he said five
[2:59] minutes talking with God.
[3:02] Oh my, hear me now. FIVE MINUTES TALKING
[3:06] TO GOD. He was more equipped.
[3:09] HE WAS MORE equipped to go to Egypt than
[3:11] 40 years had made him of himself. 40
[3:14] years of training, 40 YEARS OF EFFORT.
[3:16] FIVE MINUTES. AMEN. LISTEN, I'm talking
[3:18] about pressing through that. I'm not
[3:20] even asking FOR A LOT OF IT. YOU JUST
[3:21] GET IN GOD'S PRESENCE FOR FIVE MINUTES
[3:24] AND WATCH [screaming]
[3:24] HOW MUCH DIFFERENT YOUR LIFE WILL BE
[3:26] THAN WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH IT YOUR WHOLE
[3:28] LIFE. GOD DID MORE IN FIVE MINUTES in
[3:32] that man's life than he'd ever had
[3:34] happen the first 80.
[3:38] My
[3:40] God can do more in seconds.
[3:43] we could do in a whole lifetime. And
[3:45] here we are batting at the air. I'll get
[3:48] it done. I can live right. I can be
[3:50] holy. No, you can't. But God in you can.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; Well, it's just so hard. It's so hard to
[3:57] serve God. It's so hard to give this up.
[3:58] The hardest thing you'll ever do is not
[4:00] do it. Because you'll struggle and
[4:03] you'll fight your whole life and you you
[4:04] you'll get tired. You're always running
[4:06] from trouble, always running from your
[4:08] problems. And listen, you'll get tired
[4:10] way before they do.
[4:13] Moses wore himself out for 40 years
[4:15] running from trouble. Amen. But five
[4:17] minutes, all of his complexes, all of
[4:20] his weakness, all of HIS PROBLEMS, IT
[4:22] DIDN'T MATTER. FIVE MINUTES IN the
[4:24] presence of God made him ready.
[4:28] Amen. That's what happens when a man or
[4:30] woman meets God. Amen. I believe he does
[4:32] the same thing today. That's what the
[4:34] message of the hour did for me. Amen.
[4:36] Listen. BUT IF AN INVISIBLE GOD can make
[4:39] himself seen, if a bush can burn and not
[4:42] be consumed, then it's a small MATTER
[4:44] FOR GOD TO TAKE MY LIFE and make it what
[4:47] he wants it to be. IT'S A SMALL MATTER
[4:49] FOR GOD TO TAKE YOUR PROBLEM and change
[4:52] it into a blessing. Amen. It's anything
[4:54] too hard for God.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:00] Oh my. That fire that was in that bush,
[5:03] now he's saying, "I'm come down.
[5:07] to deliver this people.
[5:09] Amen. That pillar of fire was going to
[5:11] go before him. It was going to defend
[5:12] him from behind. And listen, like
[5:14] brother Bram said, you can't get warm
[5:15] with a painted fire. Me telling you
[5:17] about fire today won't make you warm.
[5:20] Maybe the furnace will. I don't know.
[5:21] But see, I'm getting sweaty already.
[5:22] [laughter]
[5:24] A painting of a fire won't make you
[5:26] warm. Amen. But a real fire will make
[5:28] you warm. Not only will it make you
[5:30] warm, it'll give you light. It
[5:32] illuminates things that were hidden. It
[5:34] illuminates the darkness. there's a heat
[5:36] IN A REAL FIRE. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE
[5:38] FIRE FOR YOURSELF. It's not enough to
[5:40] say, "Oh, I believe there was a pillar
[5:41] of fire in that day." It's not enough to
[5:44] say there's a that the THE TONGUES OF
[5:45] FIRE CAME down the day of Pentecost.
[5:47] IT'S NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO SAY, "WELL, I
[5:49] believe in 1950 that pillar of fire was
[5:52] photographed in Houston, Texas over a
[5:54] prophet's head." But that SAME PILLAR OF
[5:56] FIRE HAS got to be in you today, right
[5:58] now.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; If it's not, you'll die. Right. Right.
[6:04] &gt;&gt; All there is to it.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; Listen, if that fire is in you, it'll
[6:10] equip you
[6:10] &gt;&gt; in five minutes, maybe.
[6:12] &gt;&gt; He'll equip you. HE'LL FORTIFY YOU. HE
[6:14] WON'T LET YOU STAND STILL. HE WON'T LET
[6:17] YOU SIT IN SIN. HE WON'T LET YOU BE
[6:19] COMPLACENT. There's a restlessness.
[6:20] Well, praise the Lord. Amen. Listen,
[6:22] Jeremiah one time said, "You know what?
[6:24] I I'VE BEEN A PROPHET, BUT THEY THEY
[6:25] DON'T LIKE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY." AND HE
[6:27] got concerned. He was tired of getting
[6:28] yelled at all the time. AMEN. LISTEN,
[6:31] JEREMIAH SAID, "I'M I'm not going I'm
[6:32] not going to preach in his name anymore.
[6:34] I'm not going to make mention OF HIM.
[6:35] I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT." BUT YOU KNOW
[6:36] WHAT? The more he tried to hold it back,
[6:39] THE WORSE IT GOT. HE SAID, "IT'S LIKE A
[6:41] FIRE. SHUT UP IN MY BONES." AND THE MORE
[6:44] I TRIED TO FOREBEAR, [screaming] THE
[6:46] MORE I COULDN'T HOLD IT IN. THERE'S
[6:47] SOMETHING THAT CRIES OUT IN THE BELIEVER
[6:49] TODAY. There was SOMETHING IN MOSES
[6:52] SAID, "I CAN'T TURN BACK. I CAN'T WALK
[6:54] ALL THE WAY HERE TO PHARAOH, WALK UP TO
[6:56] HIS FACE, tell him, "Thus say the Lord,
[6:58] let my people go, and then WALK AWAY,
[7:00] AND GIVE UP NOW. I CAN'T DO IT."
[7:03] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I'M NOT here today just because
[7:05] I was invited, although I appreciate
[7:06] that. Talk about on THE EARTH TODAY. I'M
[7:08] NOT HERE TODAY just because I wanted to
[7:10] BE HERE. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE
[7:11] SOMETHING IN ME, I ALLOWED IT TO TAKE
[7:15] AUTHORITY, a resonance above, and I
[7:18] COULDN'T HELP IT. AMEN. I'VE GOT TO BE
[7:20] WHAT GOD MADE ME TO BE. AND THERE'S NOT
[7:22] ENOUGH POWERS OF DARKNESS TO STOP IT.
[7:24] THERE'S NOT ENOUGH IN YOUR LIFE THAT'S
[7:26] AGAINST YOU TO STOP IT. BECAUSE IF GOD
[7:29] BE FOR YOU, WHO CAN BE AGAINST YOU?
[7:34] [laughter]
[7:35] Praise the Lord. I love this defiance.
[7:39] Amen. MOST PEOPLE ARE DEFIANT IN THE
[7:41] face of God's will, but I love BECAUSE
[7:43] MOSES IS DEFIANT IN THE FACE OF THE
[7:45] ENEMY.
[7:46] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of defiance we want.
[7:48] Amen. Not defiance against that which is
[7:50] right and holy, which is what most of us
[7:51] did in our sinful lives, or all of us
[7:54] actually.
[7:56] Amen. Defies the powers of darkness.
[7:59] Amen.
[8:01] There's people sitting here today. You
[8:03] different ones that are here today.
[8:04] You're not hopefully you're not here
[8:06] because of a religious obligation.
[8:09] You're not here to be seen and heard by
[8:11] others. It's more than just a position
[8:13] or a claim. Brother John, you don't do
[8:15] this because you love the fame and the
[8:16] not. Oh man, everybody just thinks I'm
[8:19] He's [laughter]
[8:21] Well, praise the Lord. Poor guy. I was
[8:24] trying to make you feel bad either.
[8:25] Listen, God called man. He's not doing
[8:27] it because of all the the things that
[8:30] people will say and all the nice Listen,
[8:32] they suffer through things. They go
[8:34] through Listen, they deal with hardships
[8:36] that not everybody knows about all the
[8:37] time. And he can't just get up here and
[8:39] I'm going through this. Amen. He can't
[8:41] do that because there's a mission in his
[8:43] life to help and equip the people of
[8:46] God. AND IT SUPERSEDES all that. Amen.
[8:48] And and as a minister, AS CHRISTIANS,
[8:50] YOU WATCH PEOPLE, THEY SAY AND do things
[8:52] and you try to help THEM OUT AND THEY
[8:54] WALK AWAY FROM WHAT'S SENSIBLE or right
[8:56] and then they turn around and they make
[8:58] it LIKE YOU WERE THE BAD GUY. AND AND
[9:00] ALL THAT'S COMING AT YOU. THERE'S got to
[9:01] be something in us at the end of the day
[9:05] that refuses to give up. Cuz I would
[9:08] have gave up a long time ago,
[9:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[9:11] &gt;&gt; But God in me won't give up.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; He never gave up on you. He never gave
[9:15] up on me. And God Emmy is not going to
[9:17] give up now.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Causes him to endure. There's a power in
[9:23] you. It caused you to get out of bed
[9:25] this morning real early. Some of us, you
[9:28] know, get up and sing and put your hands
[9:30] together. You say amen to the word in
[9:32] church. It's something that's bigger
[9:34] than you and I.
[9:37] Amen. And I thank God for that. I'm glad
[9:39] it's not depending on me. See, I'm
[9:42] actually happy about it because if it
[9:43] depended on me, I would be worried
[9:45] because I'd have done messed it up a
[9:47] long time ago. Amen. Don't be upset that
[9:49] it doesn't depend on you. You should be
[9:51] so glad that God was smart enough not to
[9:53] let it depend on what you want to do all
[9:55] the time cuz you'd have made a mess of
[9:57] it like you do everything else.
[10:00] Well, you know, I got quiet on that one,
[10:01] but it's truth anyhow.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Most of our problems in our life,
[10:05] whether we realize it or not, we cause
[10:07] most of them. Yeah,
[10:10] &gt;&gt; it takes a little wisdom, but you
[10:11] finally realize, well, praise the Lord,
[10:13] this happened and this happened. All
[10:15] these people, they all Well, may maybe
[10:17] I'm the problem.
[10:19] That's a good That's a tough
[10:21] realization.
[10:23] But you have to come to that. Amen. If
[10:26] you don't come to that, you'll never
[10:27] receive what he's trying to give you
[10:30] because you'll always think, "Nah, I'm
[10:32] I'm good. I don't need it."
[10:34] You do need it. You just don't realize
[10:36] it.
[10:37] Amen.
[10:39] I'm glad it's not dependent on me or you
[10:42] today because I'd ended up the way
[10:44] 40-year-old Moses did. Amen. I'd have
[10:47] looked at the whole thing and I messed
[10:48] it up. Amen. But when Moses sees this
[10:51] one that's invisible, he doesn't fear.
[10:53] And the Bible says this, too. We read
[10:55] this. He said, it says that he esteemed
[10:58] the reproach of Christ. Everybody know
[11:00] what reproach is? It's the it's the bad
[11:03] part. It's the part that, oh, you look
[11:04] dumb. You look bad. Oh, you're a holy
[11:06] roll. Oh, you're a Bible thumper. Oh,
[11:07] you're one of them Christians. The
[11:09] reproach or the shame of it. Amen. But
[11:11] he esteemed. Think about this word
[11:13] esteem. He He esteemed it. He valued it.
[11:17] He esteemed the reproach of Christ
[11:20] greater than the treasures of Egypt.
[11:22] Amen. And when he did that, it made a
[11:25] decision for him.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; See, what you value affects what you
[11:29] decide. Amen. And the Bible says he
[11:31] chose. Oh my.
[11:34] He chose to suffer affliction.
[11:37] MOST OF US JUST SUFFER AFFLICTION
[11:39] WHETHER we want to or not. We go through
[11:41] trouble. WE GO THROUGH. BUT HE EMBRACES
[11:44] IT. THIS IS HIS DECISION. I'M GOING TO
[11:46] GO THROUGH SOMETHING AND IT'S REALLY
[11:48] BAD, BUT I'M GOING TO CHOOSE TO DO IT
[11:50] BECAUSE I VALUE [screaming] THE PRIZE OR
[11:52] THE REWARD FOR IT.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He chose to suffer affliction with
[11:56] THE PEOPLE OF GOD RATHER than enjoy the
[11:58] pleasures of sin for a season. Amen.
[12:00] Because it's just a season. It's
[12:01] temporary. Right.
[12:04] All these things the world chases after,
[12:06] it's temporary. You get that bottle and
[12:08] you think that this will make my day.
[12:10] And you get to the bottom of that bottle
[12:12] and then before you know it, you're
[12:13] looking for another one. You're [snorts]
[12:15] looking for another syringe. You're
[12:16] looking for another this, you're looking
[12:17] for another that. It's never ENOUGH CUZ
[12:21] IT'S TEMPORARY.
[12:23] But he looked at the unseen, the
[12:25] eternal, AND SAID, "I WOULD RATHER
[12:27] SUFFER TO GET WHAT THAT IS."
[12:31] LISTEN, I'M NOT asking you all day to go
[12:32] in chains and bondage. Now, you might
[12:34] have to. I don't know. But Amen. THIS
[12:36] MAN CHOSE [screaming] TO SUFFER
[12:39] TO GET THE PRIZE, TO GET THE TREASURE.
[12:42] AND THE THE TREASURE was the reproach of
[12:44] Christ.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; It's not EVEN THE BEST PART.
[12:48] AMEN. WELL, praise the Lord. Brother Bam
[12:51] says this, looking at the unseen, Moses,
[12:53] when he become 40 years old, a young
[12:55] man, as far as sight was concerned,
[12:57] MOSES HAD THE WORLD IN HIS HAND. NOW,
[12:58] think about this. Now, we're not talking
[13:00] about just a a guy working at the
[13:01] 7-Eleven. We're talking about an Elon
[13:03] MUSK OR SOMEBODY SOMEBODY'S GOT
[13:05] EVERYTHING AT HIS FINGERTIPS.
[13:07] The world's his oyster. Amen. Moses had
[13:10] the world in his hand. He was the next
[13:12] pharaoh of Egypt. He had all the lands
[13:13] of the world right in his hand to be
[13:15] king over the entire earth, knowing of
[13:17] at that day. And yet, oh my, it's
[13:20] marvelous. Yet, he looked through the
[13:22] window that Pharaoh looked out of. Same
[13:23] window, same scene. He looked out the
[13:27] the window that Pharaoh looked out of
[13:29] and he saw those Hebrews. To Pharaoh who
[13:32] looked upon them, there was nothing but
[13:34] a bunch of mudbers down there in the mud
[13:36] making brick. To the celebrity as they
[13:39] passed by, they said the SAME THING. THE
[13:41] WELL-DRESSED PEOPLE, WELL, THAT'S A
[13:43] BUNCH OF SLAVES. NOTHING BUT MUD
[13:45] WALLOWERS. But when Moses looked out the
[13:47] same window,
[13:50] amen, think about this now. He saw them
[13:53] different because he looked at the
[13:55] unseen and KNOWED THAT GOD PROMISED THAT
[13:58] HE WOULD deliver them out of that place
[14:00] and take them to a land of promise. This
[14:03] is why you sit in a church and you got
[14:05] all kinds of different responses. Some
[14:06] people sit there like, "Man, that guy's
[14:07] nuts. He's just reading the Bible and
[14:10] looking like a and that's all they think
[14:12] about it." Amen. But there's some people
[14:13] they see they they they relate to it and
[14:16] energize them. Why? They're looking at
[14:18] the same thing, but they're not seeing
[14:20] the same thing. They have two different
[14:22] perceptions. Amen. One is looking at a
[14:25] natural man, the foolishness of
[14:27] preaching. It's the reproach of Christ.
[14:29] This looks LIKE THE WORST. AMEN. WHY
[14:31] WOULD ANYBODY in their right mind want
[14:33] to do that? But if you can look beyond
[14:35] that, if you can look beyond the man,
[14:38] YOU CAN SEE WHAT GOD'S TRYING TO DO.
[14:40] IT'S THE BEST THING EVER. I WILL TAKE
[14:42] THE WORST.
[14:44] I get ahead of myself here for a second.
[14:46] I'LL TAKE THE WORST THAT GOD has because
[14:49] it's still better THAN THE BEST.
[14:53] SEE, IT'S NOT THE SITUATION or the
[14:55] circumstance. It's what you're looking
[14:56] at. It's all how you perceive it. They
[15:00] saw the same thing through the same
[15:02] window. Same circ. But Moses perceived
[15:05] something that's not mudbers.
[15:08] That's the people of God.
[15:14] He said this. He looked at the unseen
[15:15] and know that God had promised he would
[15:17] deliver them out of that place and take
[15:19] them to a land of promise. He looked at
[15:21] THE UNSEEN. HE SAW the years that were
[15:23] coming ahead. He saw Egypt destroyed.
[15:26] Yet, she's in her blossoming time. Think
[15:27] about that now. When mo even when he
[15:29] comes back to Egypt, Moses sees the
[15:32] height of Egypt. He's not looking at
[15:35] ruins and destruction, but yet WHEN HE
[15:37] LOOKS AT THAT'S what he sees. He knows
[15:39] it's already over.
[15:43] I'm so glad I was born in the US. I
[15:44] thank God for this country. I thank God
[15:46] for imminent blessings. But listen, it's
[15:47] over. The whole thing, the whole world
[15:50] even. It's all going to be destroyed.
[15:53] It's all going to be renovated. Amen.
[15:55] We've seen it ahead of time through the
[15:58] word.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, YOUR PERCEPTION changes what
[16:03] you value. [snorts] He didn't value that
[16:05] cuz he saw it laid waste. And he sees
[16:07] these mudbers. They're going to come
[16:09] out. He says he saw Egypt destroyed, yet
[16:11] she was in her blossom time. He saw
[16:12] Egypt as she is today. And he saw Israel
[16:15] all comfortably seated around Abraham in
[16:17] glory. AND BY FAITH, HE chose to take,
[16:19] watch this, the worst the religion could
[16:22] give him and compare with the best the
[16:25] world could give him. And he chose to
[16:27] suffer the reproach of Christ and
[16:28] considered a greater treasure than all
[16:30] Egypt could afford to give him because
[16:32] he endured his seeing him who was
[16:33] invisible. God had SPOKE TO MOSES AND
[16:35] MOSES knew who God was. So he did not
[16:37] look upon the brightness. And here might
[16:39] I say to the church tonight, Moses had
[16:41] in one hand the best the world could
[16:44] give him. There could have been no
[16:46] better.
[16:48] This is the apex. Amen.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE HIGHEST OFFICE. IT WAS THE
[16:52] BEST THE WORLD. Some of us sold out for
[16:54] a lot less than that. I'll raise my
[16:56] hand. Amen. Amen. I wasn't even the
[16:59] best. I just wanted to get by. Amen.
[17:02] He's got the best before him. Amen. And
[17:07] religion offered him the worst
[17:11] that could be given. Bunch of slaves in
[17:14] a mud pit. And now if a man was looking,
[17:16] what side would he take? Let me say this
[17:19] without sincerity and without any
[17:21] malice. But let me say this so you'll
[17:23] understand today. He says, don't look at
[17:24] the big church. Don't look at the great
[17:26] denomination. Don't look at the
[17:28] well-dressed. Look at Christ.
[17:31] who was rich and became poor that
[17:34] through his poverty you might be made
[17:36] rich.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And when you're seeking a church,
[17:41] don't go where all the celebrity goes or
[17:43] the big PhDs, DDS, but look down upon
[17:46] the people who are looked down upon.
[17:49] Behold these people. They're so looked
[17:51] DOWN UPON. THEY'RE DESPISED. THAT'S THE
[17:53] ONES that are valuable. That's the ones
[17:55] you should be paying attention to.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:59] Oh my. Moses when he had them in both
[18:02] hands, the best the world could give to
[18:04] what he could look at. And yet when he
[18:05] looked at the unseen, the worst the
[18:07] church could give him, he chose to walk
[18:09] by faith. And he chose to walk by the
[18:11] unseen. God counting it a greater
[18:14] treasure than all his sight could afford
[18:15] to show him. Here was the kingdom. Here
[18:17] was the kingship. Here was the throne.
[18:20] HERE WAS THE CROWN. HERE WAS EVERYTHING
[18:21] in his hand. But yet by faith when he
[18:23] CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF CHRIST OUT THERE IN
[18:25] THE MUD PITS HE went to his people.
[18:30] He said now here's another this is
[18:32] really good too. Here's another little
[18:33] lesson on Moses. Now Moses didn't just
[18:35] sit back and say I sympathize with those
[18:37] people. Those are good people. You know
[18:40] I I would not speak one word against
[18:42] them. Now that's the way a lot of
[18:44] religionists does today. When they hear
[18:46] a strict message about the real God,
[18:47] they'll say, "Well, oh, I have nothing
[18:49] against those people who believe in
[18:50] divine healing. I have nothing against
[18:52] those people who believe in miracles,
[18:54] but that's not enough. Moses didn't just
[18:57] sympathize with them and stay on the
[19:00] throne. He went out and become one of
[19:03] them.
[19:05] Brother talks about his own life. He was
[19:07] a bapt he was in the he was in the
[19:08] Baptist church. He was a minister and
[19:10] the Presbyterian one was paying for
[19:11] schooling for him and this and that. He
[19:12] had an option to do that. But when he
[19:15] saw them people that his mother-in-law
[19:16] called holy rollers, called them
[19:17] fanatics, CALLED THEM TRASH, HE SAID,
[19:20] "THAT WASN'T TRASH. That's the cream of
[19:21] the crop. Amen. He said, "I went out to
[19:24] them. I become one of them. Now I'm a
[19:26] holy roller. Now I'm one of them, too."
[19:28] Let them say WHAT THEY WANT. I I DON'T
[19:30] WANT TO JUST SAY, "WELL, THOSE ARE GOOD,
[19:31] fine people. I'm sure that cuz that's
[19:33] what people do. All them message people,
[19:34] they're good, fine people. You know, I'm
[19:36] I'm sure they got some good things they
[19:38] teach and these people do." NO, YOU YOU
[19:40] HAVE TO BE identified with it.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; Well, I believe that God is real. Well,
[19:44] SO DID THE DEVIL. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO
[19:47] JUST SYMPATHIZE.
[19:49] You've got to go out to them. And you've
[19:50] got to become one of them.
[19:54] Amen.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; So much of life, like we were just
[19:57] talking a moment ago, it's it's based on
[19:59] your perspective.
[20:01] You know, uh it's that time of the year
[20:03] people go hunting and stuff. Now, now
[20:04] gun season's pretty short. And now I
[20:06] like to shoot guns. You knew that
[20:07] already, of course. But anybody ever
[20:09] looked for binoculars or a scope or
[20:10] something like that? You get this thing
[20:12] and you can see real far out. It's real
[20:14] crystal. It's great. You can see that.
[20:16] But there's one problem with it. the
[20:18] other 290 degrees around you, you don't
[20:20] see nothing. Something runs by, you
[20:23] can't see it. Your your perspective is
[20:25] really strong, but it's so narrow. Amen.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE LOCKED IN, OH, LOOK AT THE WORLD.
[20:30] LOOK AT RICHES. LOOK WHAT PEOPLE WANT.
[20:32] AND YOU'RE MISSING THAT God is right
[20:34] there
[20:35] trying to deal with you cuz your
[20:37] perspective is limited.
[20:42] Amen. So much of life, and I preach this
[20:44] a lot anyway, but it's the truth. So
[20:46] much of life is perspective. Amen. You
[20:48] can be you can be begrudging of the
[20:50] things that happen in your life or you
[20:51] can be grateful for your blessings. You
[20:53] have to make that choice.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; I can't make you grateful for what God
[20:57] has done in your life. You have to
[20:58] choose to do that.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO GET UP AND choose to do
[21:01] that. You have to go to bed at night and
[21:03] choose to do that. I choose to be
[21:04] grateful. Amen. BECAUSE I SEE WHAT God
[21:06] has done my life. I acknowledge it. I
[21:08] thank God for it. Amen. I want to give
[21:11] him praise and thanks because I've seen
[21:13] what God has done for me.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:18] My wife, she's not here today, so I can
[21:19] say this. She wouldn't care anyway. But
[21:23] you know, all the time,
[21:25] listen, I'll say this, brother. We're
[21:26] living in the most insane age it's ever
[21:28] been. People are going insane. And if
[21:29] you didn't believe that five or 10 years
[21:31] ago, you sure do now. People are nuts.
[21:35] They're all over the place. They They've
[21:37] got no common sense. Maybe that's why I
[21:39] stopped making pennies. They ain't got
[21:40] no sense, I guess. I don't know. BUT NO
[21:43] COMMON SENSE. NO SOUND REASONING.
[21:46] AMEN. And you watch people, my wife, we
[21:49] do this all the time. She'll watch
[21:50] somebody do something, said, 'I don't
[21:52] understand why they do that. That
[21:53] doesn't make sense. I said, 'Honey,
[21:55] you're not supposed to understand. If it
[21:56] made sense to you, you'd think it was it
[21:57] was reasonable.
[21:59] Listen, Moses is an oddball to Pharaoh.
[22:03] PHARAOH'S LIKE, "WHY WOULD A GUY THAT
[22:05] COULD DO WHAT I'VE GOT NOW? LOOK AT WHAT
[22:07] I'VE GOT AND YOU GAVE IT UP FOR THIS.
[22:10] WHAT AN IDIOT."
[22:12] &gt;&gt; But you know what? Pharaoh was an
[22:14] eyeball to Moses. You think this is
[22:16] great? This is all GOING TO GET
[22:18] DESTROYED. THIS [screaming] AIN'T
[22:19] NOTHING. THIS IS GREAT. As he points at
[22:21] a bunch of guys covered in mud, [snorts]
[22:24] &gt;&gt; they're odd. Neither one makes sense to
[22:26] the other. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO MAKE
[22:28] SENSE. IF YOU'RE SANE, THEN INSANITY
[22:31] DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO YOU. AND IF YOU'RE
[22:33] INSANE, a sane person doesn't make sense
[22:36] to you either.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; There's no way to reconcile it. THE THE
[22:41] CARNAL MIND, IT'S enmity with God. Amen.
[22:44] the the flesh and the spirit, THEY'RE AT
[22:46] EMITY. THEY THEY'RE NEVER going to line
[22:48] up. IF YOU'RE IF YOU WANT YOUR FEELINGS
[22:51] AND YOUR FLESH AND your your your ego TO
[22:55] VALIDATE YOUR CHOICE TO [screaming]
[22:56] SERVE GOD AND TO LOVE GOD, NEVER GOING
[22:59] TO WORK. AMEN. YOU'VE got to choose.
[23:02] Amen. Is this the real me or is there
[23:05] SOMETHING MORE?
[23:07] And if there's something more, then we
[23:09] should be more concerned about that than
[23:11] this. Listen, I just went to the doctor
[23:14] this week. I'm going to sit here and
[23:15] tell you all my health issues, but let
[23:16] me say this. Amen. You get sick in your
[23:18] body, you're taking pills, you're eating
[23:20] different, YOU'RE GETTING MAGNETIC
[23:22] BRACELETS, AND YOU'RE YOU'RE GROUNDING
[23:24] NOW, AND YOU'RE DOING ALL THIS STUFF FOR
[23:26] YOUR BODY, WHICH IS EVENTUALLY GOING TO
[23:28] DIE ANYWAY. BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING
[23:30] MORE TO YOU, LISTEN, that's going to
[23:32] that's the thing that you should really
[23:33] be concerned about. WE'LL GIVE HOURS
[23:35] [screaming] A WEEK TO OUR PHYSICAL
[23:37] CONDITION. Not saying you shouldn't, but
[23:38] we'll pay we'll PAY SO MUCH ATTENTION.
[23:40] WELL, I was just looking at medical
[23:41] journals yesterday. Amen. We'll we'll
[23:43] pour OVER LITERATURE AND VIDEOS AND
[23:46] WE'RE GOING TO LEARN WHAT TO EAT AND
[23:47] WHAT NOT TO. But we've neglected the
[23:50] soul.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; The thing that really matters.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; People are out of their minds running
[24:01] around doing all that praising God like
[24:02] that. THEY'RE OUT OF THEIR MINDS.
[24:04] THEY'RE GOING TO THINK that because they
[24:06] thought the way you did they'd be here.
[24:08] [laughter]
[24:09] Amen.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Well, I I just tell him I am out of my
[24:14] mind. I got the mind of Christ now.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; It's better. Let me say once again, it's
[24:21] better than the one I had. Amen. WE HAVE
[24:23] THE MIND OF CHRIST. SO, YOU ARE OUT OF
[24:25] your mind, but you're in the mind of
[24:26] Christ. Amen. That's why brother B said,
[24:28] "You look like a mystic to the world."
[24:30] Amen. They think you're some sort of
[24:31] weird spooky whatever.
[24:33] But the Bible says THAT PERFECT FAITH,
[24:35] YOU LOOK LIKE A MYSTIC. WHY? BECAUSE
[24:37] YOU'RE SHUT away in a world WITH JUST
[24:40] YOU AND GOD. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE
[24:42] INVISIBLE God and you're talking to them
[24:44] and you're making decisions and you're
[24:46] basing your life. You're orienting it
[24:47] AROUND THIS WORD AND THEY think you're
[24:49] nuts.
[24:52] Then people believe in praying FOR THE
[24:53] SICK.
[24:55] WHO DOES THAT ANYWAY? WELL, TELL YOU
[24:57] WHAT, YOU GET desperate enough, the the
[24:58] biggest unbeliever will pray for the
[25:00] [laughter] somebody, God, would you help
[25:02] me out?
[25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like I said, people call me
[25:05] all kinds of names in my life, but you
[25:06] know what? They call me when they're
[25:07] sick. [snorts]
[25:08] &gt;&gt; They call me when they want prayer.
[25:10] Amen. You know, I'm not talking about
[25:11] I'm talking about us today. Amen.
[25:12] They'll call you a BUNCH OF ODDBALLS.
[25:14] YOU guys are nuts. But without the nuts,
[25:16] it's nothing but a pile of yunk.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Something's got to hold it together.
[25:20] SOMETHING'S GOT TO KEEP IT GOING. AMEN.
[25:24] They go on heedless of their lives
[25:26] thinking that they're getting by, but
[25:27] it's because there's a praying people on
[25:29] the face of the earth today.
[25:32] And the people they hate the most are
[25:33] the ones that are keeping them alive.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; That's Moses's whole story. Even out
[25:37] there in the wilderness, he's constantly
[25:39] God, don't kill them. God don't destroy
[25:40] him. AND THEY WANT TO KILL MOSES.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; The thankless job as far as men are
[25:47] concerned. You know, it's got good
[25:48] benefits.
[25:50] It's got an eternal life package.
[25:53] Blessed assurance.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:58] I want to bring this all full circle. I
[26:00] I'm I'm not even halfway through, but
[26:02] I'm not going to keep you all day. But
[26:04] this is what I'm coming to. Moses
[26:07] endured because he saw him who was
[26:10] invisible. You endure when you see the
[26:13] invisible God. Amen. It is not, as we
[26:16] like to think, based on our ability to
[26:18] see our outcome or our circumstances.
[26:22] That's where we make our mistake. We try
[26:23] to look at all our options and look at
[26:26] the circumstances. We look at the
[26:27] problems. We look at the symptoms. we
[26:29] get discouraged. Well, if you look at
[26:31] those things, you will. But if you look
[26:33] at the invisible God, you will endure.
[26:37] You're not going to endure based on your
[26:39] ability to perceive the outcome of your
[26:41] circumstances or your ability to figure
[26:43] it out.
[26:45] We try TO FIGURE IT OUT AND THEN WHEN WE
[26:47] DO TRY to do what we did that we figured
[26:49] it out and it doesn't work. I just don't
[26:51] know what happened. I know. I know what
[26:54] happened. YOU HAPPENED. YOUR IDEA
[26:57] HAPPENED AND YOUR IDEA LIKE MY IDEA was
[27:00] terrible.
[27:01] WE LOOKED at partial data. We looked at
[27:05] our perspective and we made a decision
[27:07] without any sort of knowledge of what's
[27:08] really going on. But see, God doesn't
[27:11] have that problem. God knows all the
[27:13] things. God sees the beginning from the
[27:16] end. Amen. He's not making decisions
[27:18] based on partial information, but God is
[27:22] making, he's already made his decisions
[27:24] based on perfect knowledge.
[27:27] So, you don't endure from seeing your
[27:29] circumstance or even seeing the outcome.
[27:31] You endure because you've seen God.
[27:33] That's why the Bible declares in Isaiah
[27:35] uh chapter 26:3
[27:37] that thou will keep him in perfect peace
[27:39] whose mind is stayed on thee because he
[27:43] trusteth in thee. Now, this this Hebrew
[27:46] says perfect peace. They don't actually
[27:47] have a word for that in the Hebrew. It's
[27:49] actually peace. Peace. Because when you
[27:50] want to emphasize something in the
[27:51] Hebrew, you say it twice like Moses.
[27:53] Moses instead of an exclamation mark. So
[27:55] thou will keep him in peace. Peace. Or
[27:57] in other words, peace.
[27:59] Amen. Thou will keep him in shalom.
[28:02] Shalom. Whose mind is stayed on thee
[28:06] because he trusts in thee. Amen.
[28:10] So, we're not enduring today
[28:13] because we know how it's all going to
[28:15] turn out. and we've studied it and we
[28:17] figured it out and we all of our
[28:19] problems we know what the solution is.
[28:22] We we we know what problems we're going
[28:24] to encounter at what point in our life
[28:25] and it's all m we don't know. Amen.
[28:30] Probably if you saw ahead of time all
[28:32] the things you were going to go through
[28:32] in this life you might not have wanted
[28:34] to go through them. Moses foraw some
[28:38] things but he chose to suffer affliction
[28:40] for the treasure of Christ the reproach
[28:42] of Christ. Amen.
[28:45] So God,
[28:47] I love this because the Bible, even
[28:49] Jesus does this, you know, he he endured
[28:52] the cross, he despises the shame, but he
[28:54] does it because of the joy that was set
[28:56] before him. In other words, he chose to
[28:58] suffer because it was worth it for the
[29:00] prize.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; You ask a good athlete, you ask a
[29:03] businessman, you ask somebody wants to
[29:04] be successful, there's sacrifice,
[29:06] there's suffering. Amen. Not everybody's
[29:08] willing to do it. That's why not
[29:09] everybody achieves it.
[29:12] Amen. There's a price to be paid for
[29:15] great things. Amen. And Jesus endures
[29:18] THE CROSS. HE DESPISES THE SHAME. BUT
[29:21] IT'S BECAUSE OF THE JOY that was set
[29:23] before him. BECAUSE OF THE PRIZE. YOU
[29:26] ARE THE JOY THAT WAS SET BEFORE HIM.
[29:27] PRAISE GOD. THAT OUGHT TO MAKE YOU FEEL
[29:29] GOOD TODAY. ALL THAT HE WENT THROUGH, HE
[29:31] WENT THROUGH because he looked at you
[29:32] and said, "You're worth it."
[29:38] &gt;&gt; We don't see all things like that, but
[29:41] we do know how it ends. Like that old
[29:43] song we used to sing. I read the back of
[29:44] the book and we win.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, even Paul talked about this in
[29:47] Romans chapter 8. I reckon that the
[29:50] sufferings of this present time are not
[29:52] worthy to be compared with the glory
[29:55] which shall be revealed in us.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Now think about this. He reckons. In
[29:59] other words, he doesn't have a perfect
[30:00] knowledge, but he reckons. In other
[30:02] words, we consider that no matter what
[30:05] you're going through, it's not worthy to
[30:07] be compared to the glory which shall be
[30:09] revealed in us. Amen. IN OTHER WORDS,
[30:11] I'LL take the worst of religion over the
[30:14] best that the world has. Amen. He's not
[30:18] saying this because he's in a glorified
[30:19] body. HE'S NOT SEEING IT ALL LAID OUT IN
[30:21] FRONT OF HIM. But he reasons it's no
[30:24] matter what I go through, it's got to be
[30:26] worth it. It's got to be worth it.
[30:30] You believe that today? Whatever you're
[30:32] going through right now, whatever you've
[30:33] been through, listen, if it's for the
[30:35] Lord, it's got to be worth it.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; It will be worth it. It's It's even
[30:40] worth it in this life. How much more the
[30:44] one to come? Amen.
[30:48] Man, I'm way off here.
[30:52] Who's got another hour? No.
[30:55] Brother says this, "God don't tell his
[30:57] prophets everything."
[30:59] No, this is prophets.
[31:01] He just tells them what he wants them to
[31:02] know. Not everything. They can do
[31:04] nothing in themselves. Just what God
[31:06] shows them. He said, 'Could you imagine
[31:08] Isaac sitting blind, blessing Jacob
[31:10] instead of Esau. Can you imagine Jacob
[31:12] holding Joseph's coat for 40 years
[31:13] bloody thinking that an animal killed
[31:15] him? Being a prophet
[31:18] proves God just reveals his prophets
[31:19] what he wants them to know and nothing
[31:21] else. Prophets are not infallible
[31:23] people. Prophets are not angels. They
[31:25] are men.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; I I just want to I'll do this real
[31:29] quick. I just want to throw this in
[31:30] here, but
[31:32] Jacob's whole story is so interesting
[31:34] for you that know it. Of course, Joseph
[31:36] has a dream. He has a couple dreams. And
[31:38] he sees himself ruling over his
[31:40] brethren, his and and Leah and and his
[31:42] father and and his brethren. They hear
[31:45] about this because, you know, Joseph
[31:48] exercised all the wisdom of a
[31:49] 17-year-old.
[31:51] He sees this dream, this vision that
[31:53] he's going to rule over the earth, rule
[31:55] over his brethren. And what's he do? He
[31:56] tells him,
[31:58] "Probably wouldn't do that myself at 42.
[32:02] I might have at 17." Hey guys, guess
[32:05] what? YOU KNOW HOW IT IS. YOUR BROTHER
[32:06] takes my my kids fight over socks. THE
[32:09] DUMBEST THING. PROBABLY ONE DAY. OH
[32:11] YEAH. WELL, I CAN PICK up more than you.
[32:13] I Well, that's my land. Oh, yeah. Well,
[32:14] I'm going to be your boss one day. I'm
[32:17] going to rule the earth. And the Bible
[32:20] said they love No, THEY HATED THEY HATED
[32:23] THEIR BROTHER FOR EVEN JACOB'S LIKE,
[32:25] MAN, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. THAT SEEMS
[32:27] KIND OF BUT THE BIBLE says this, we we
[32:29] gloss over this. The Bible said he
[32:31] considered the matter. In other words,
[32:33] like Mary, she kept it in her. That's
[32:34] what it means in the Hebrew. He he took
[32:36] the matter and he he held on to it.
[32:38] Amen, my son. Because there was
[32:40] something different about Joseph and it
[32:42] caused Jacob to love him. He saw
[32:44] visions. He saw dreams. He was spiritual
[32:46] like his dad. And his dad, he couldn't
[32:48] relate to the other kids on, you know,
[32:49] how you have different kids. Some of
[32:51] them like certain hobbies and other ones
[32:52] LIKE THIS IS HIS ONE KID. They can
[32:55] relate to him about all VISIONS AND
[32:56] DREAMS. YOU GET IT? SO, HE MAKES HIM
[32:59] THIS COAT OF MANY COLORS. And now his
[33:01] brothers hate him even more.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; One day they said, "THAT'S IT. WE'RE
[33:06] KILLING THIS GUY." These patriarchs are
[33:08] some fine guys, by the way. Real
[33:10] sweethearts, I tell you what, I got
[33:12] family like that, too. So do you. WE'RE
[33:14] GOING TO KILL HIM. AND UH I can't
[33:17] remember. Was it Judah? Which I probably
[33:19] have it in here somewhere. One of them
[33:20] says, "Let's not kill him. Let's just
[33:22] let's just sell him into slavery. We can
[33:23] make some money off of it.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Sell him for 20 pieces of silver,
[33:26] whatever."
[33:28] So they sell him into slavery and he
[33:30] goes off and this is what I'm getting
[33:32] at. Amen.
[33:34] Jacob begins to weep and lament. He's
[33:38] lost Rachel, his beloved wife. He's lo
[33:41] all this stuff's happened. But when it
[33:43] comes
[33:44] when it comes to Joseph, it's something
[33:47] different. It just hits him. Amen. He he
[33:50] couldn't he would not be comforted. The
[33:52] Bible said his sons would come to him
[33:54] and he would not be comforted.
[33:57] and he sees this bloody garment. Now,
[33:59] here's what here's what I want to get
[34:00] you to real quick. He sees the bloody
[34:02] garment and he begins to imagine. He
[34:04] doesn't know. God didn't show him. He
[34:07] doesn't even have any He has a bloody
[34:08] garment and he begins to imagine, "Oh,
[34:12] something must have killed my son.
[34:14] Something has run him apart." And his
[34:16] imagination begins to take him somewhere
[34:18] that God never told him to go. Amen. How
[34:21] many times do we think about a certain
[34:24] thing and we have our idea of oh God
[34:26] must not love me or oh God this or this
[34:28] or that and we let our imagination
[34:32] build this scenario in our minds and
[34:34] we'll lose peace. We'll lose sleep.
[34:36] We'll get heartache. Listen, Jacob for
[34:38] years he lost sleep. He he he would not
[34:41] be comforted. He he was miserable. Amen.
[34:45] He lost he he he so many things he
[34:48] missed out on. Amen. But thank God
[34:50] there's one thing he never lost. Never
[34:51] lost his faith. Amen.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; He knew that he'd have to reap what he
[34:54] sowed. But there was some plan for it.
[34:56] But but this God, God had shown him this
[34:59] was going to be the case.
[35:01] And I think this is I think this is why
[35:03] it hurts him so much. It's not just that
[35:05] his beloved son dies. But he believed
[35:08] the dream. He believed the dream his son
[35:11] had showed him and now he sees his son
[35:15] is gone.
[35:18] Maybe he didn't really see anything.
[35:19] Maybe it was all a lie. Maybe everything
[35:22] I believed was all just made up. You
[35:25] know what's funny about that? That's not
[35:26] what Abraham did.
[35:29] Amen. Abraham knew that if Isaac died,
[35:32] God have to raise him back up.
[35:35] Amen. But Jacob's imagination
[35:39] allowed him to think that God had done
[35:41] this thing to him, that God had hurt
[35:42] him. Now you say, "Listen, that he's on
[35:46] talking terms with God. It looks cruel
[35:49] to us. It looks cruel. Any moment God
[35:52] could have been like, "Hey, by the way,
[35:55] Joseph's alive. Pass it on.
[35:59] God, you you got 20 YEARS TO GOD.
[36:02] [screaming] ANYTIME NOW you want to LET
[36:05] ME KNOW. THAT'D BE GREAT." NOTHING.
[36:09] GOD, WE SAID, "GOD, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
[36:11] HIM JOSEPH'S ALIVE?" JUST JUST JUST
[36:14] three words. JOSEPH IS ALIVE ANYTIME.
[36:16] WHY [screaming] DOESN'T GOD TELL HIM?
[36:17] I'LL TELL YOU WHY GOD DIDN'T TELL HIM.
[36:18] The same reason he wouldn't tell me
[36:19] because I'd went right down to Egypt
[36:22] and said, "Give me my SON BACK. I DON'T
[36:25] WANT HIM DOWN THERE. I LOVE MY BOY. I
[36:27] wouldn't do that to him." God knows it.
[36:28] That's why he didn't tell him because he
[36:31] had to go DOWN THERE TO PRESERVE LIFE.
[36:34] IF JOSEPH HAD NOT BEEN THERE, THEY WOULD
[36:36] HAVE [screaming] ALL DIED AND MUCH OF
[36:37] THE WORLD WOULD HAVE DIED OF FAMINE.
[36:39] AMEN. So God PUTS HIM THERE. HE DOESN'T
[36:41] SHOW HIM BECAUSE HE NEEDS HIM THERE. HE
[36:44] NEEDS JACOB TO NOT GO GET HIM OUT OF
[36:46] TROUBLE.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; JACOB, YOU NEED TO LET ME DO WHAT I WANT
[36:49] IN HIS LIFE AND NOT WHAT YOU WANT.
[36:53] And it SEEMS CRUEL, BUT GOD HAS TO DO IT
[36:55] THAT WAY BECAUSE HE KNOWS.
[36:59] JACOB, you're going to run run right
[37:00] down there the first chance you get if I
[37:02] tell you.
[37:04] Amen.
[37:07] We don't always see everything,
[37:10] but we know the one that does.
[37:13] And sometimes you don't hear from God.
[37:15] Listen, I'll say this for us that, you
[37:17] know, for believers especially,
[37:18] sometimes you're praying about stuff.
[37:20] You ever,
[37:22] Brother Bruce has taught me about this
[37:23] here a couple years ago. You ever pray
[37:25] about something? Sometimes you pray for
[37:27] something, you're praying for an answer,
[37:28] and God answers just like that. Praise
[37:30] God, I got the answer. Oh, you go out
[37:32] like a warrior. Yeah, we've got the will
[37:34] of the Lord, crushing enemies. But
[37:36] sometimes you pray about something
[37:40] and months go by and years go by and
[37:42] years and years go by and there's
[37:45] certain things you pray about.
[37:48] Listen, there's times, even brother
[37:49] Brandham dealt with this. There's times
[37:50] your life, God feels so far away. This
[37:52] is a vindicated prophet. He's been
[37:55] around the world seven times. preached a
[37:56] king, seen miracle after miracle,
[37:57] discernment after sermon, and yet God
[38:00] feels so far away from him. You prayed
[38:03] and you prayed, the heavens are brass.
[38:07] Amen. We love it when we come to church.
[38:09] We feel the presence of God. The
[38:11] anointing sweeps over US AND WE'RE
[38:13] HAVING A GREAT TIME. NOBODY WANTS TO BE
[38:15] JACOB.
[38:17] WE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN WE SIT quiet and
[38:20] we pray. We don't hear a thing. We don't
[38:24] feel a thing.
[38:26] But I submit to you today, many times as
[38:28] a believer, that's actually when God's
[38:29] the closest to you.
[38:33] Amen. Many times you don't feel God or
[38:36] or sense him or anything at all. Many
[38:38] times that's when he's actually the
[38:39] closest because you're called to walk by
[38:41] faith, not by sight. And many times when
[38:43] God's got his hand on you, that's when
[38:45] you realize it the least.
[38:50] Man, it just feels like I'm in this
[38:51] place right now. Maybe God's put you
[38:54] there for a reason.
[38:56] Maybe he's closer than you realize and
[38:59] you think he's so far away. Amen. That's
[39:02] when you have to listen, even Jesus,
[39:04] brother talk about this. The spirit left
[39:05] him in the garden of Gethsemane and he
[39:07] goes up to the cross and he dies as a
[39:09] man. That's when you've got to know when
[39:11] you don't feel something. Because
[39:12] listen, I I like good feelings, but my
[39:14] feelings have also lied to me. Amen.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; I can't make that a basis
[39:19] for what I believe. I have to see the
[39:22] plan of God for myself. I have to have
[39:23] heard from God. And now he doesn't have
[39:25] to show you everything, but I know
[39:26] enough to trust him. Even like Jesus,
[39:30] he's hanging on a cross, yet he's Think
[39:32] about that now. Jesus is the spirit has
[39:35] left him. Friends have left him. He's
[39:38] suffering like no man has ever suffered.
[39:40] HE'S HANGING ON A CROSS NAKED, REJECTED.
[39:43] WHERE is he at? The very center of the
[39:46] will of God.
[39:48] The worst moment of his life was
[39:50] actually the best moment.
[39:54] Let me say this for me. Maybe you can
[39:56] relate. I can look back at my life. The
[39:59] worst moments of my life, they were
[40:01] actually the best moments of my life. I
[40:03] just didn't realize it at the time.
[40:06] Some of the worst things I ever went
[40:07] through, I look back now, I'm so glad
[40:09] God let me go through that. I wouldn't
[40:11] be who I am today. I wouldn't be where
[40:12] I'm at today if I hadn't gone through
[40:14] that. And if I could go back again now
[40:16] and tell the old me, "Keep going. It's
[40:18] worth it." I would.
[40:22] Amen. If I never had a problem, I
[40:25] wouldn't know that God could solve them.
[40:28] I wouldn't know what faith in God could
[40:29] do. Amen.
[40:33] Many times, it's the best things in our
[40:36] life. Amen.
[40:39] Won't you stand to your feet with me
[40:40] today? Well, this went all over the
[40:42] place.
[40:44] I apologize.
[40:47] Hey. Yeah. Well, like I said, I can do
[40:50] part two if you want. Here, [laughter]
[40:52] let people go eaters. We praise the
[40:55] Lord. Amen.
[40:59] Maybe today you're in a situation like
[41:00] that.
[41:02] I've been there before. All of us have
[41:04] been there at some point. And I'm really
[41:06] going through it right now. It seems
[41:07] like I'm going through the ringer.
[41:08] People don't even know what that is
[41:09] anymore. They don't no longer the ringer
[41:11] really.
[41:12] [snorts] Sound effects help. You're
[41:14] ringing the clothes out. Feels like
[41:16] YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE RINGER, MAN. I
[41:18] just I'm in this spot.
[41:20] I'm going through this
[41:23] and and and you know, nobody likes it. I
[41:27] didn't at the time anyway. [laughter]
[41:29] No, no. Uh correction seems pleasant at
[41:32] the time.
[41:34] That's the time to say, "What is God
[41:35] trying to do in my life?" Amen. We're
[41:37] always trying to figure out what we
[41:38] should do or what we want. God, how does
[41:41] this glorify you? What are you wanting
[41:43] to do in my life? What are you trying to
[41:46] say to me? Don't miss what God's doing.
[41:48] Listen, the worst that God has to offer
[41:52] is still better than the best the world
[41:54] has to offer. Amen.
[41:57] Let's pray.
[41:59] Lord, we thank you today.
[42:02] Sometimes we sit like Jacob even and in
[42:05] our minds we begin to invent. We begin
[42:10] to imagine. We build these scenarios
[42:14] and we convince ourselves of things that
[42:17] you never told us. Lord, maybe we were
[42:20] convinced at one point as sinners. We
[42:22] thought to ourselves, "I couldn't serve
[42:25] God. I I couldn't give up all those
[42:27] things. I couldn't walk away from that.
[42:29] But Lord, I found out I couldn't afford
[42:30] not to.
[42:32] It was all what my mind had told me, all
[42:36] imagination
[42:37] and flesh.
[42:39] But we find today,
[42:43] Lord, as we've read about it, I believe
[42:44] that you're still able to make yourself
[42:47] seen. [snorts]
[42:48] I believe you're still able to declare,
[42:51] Lord, not just a man in this pulpit
[42:52] reading a book today, but that you're
[42:54] real and that you're present and that
[42:57] you're still the same. The same
[42:58] yesterday, today, and forever. still
[43:00] have power today to heal the sick and to
[43:03] raise the dead. YOU HAVE THE POWER TODAY
[43:05] TO cleanse our filthy hands and our
[43:07] filthy hearts and change our lives if
[43:10] we'll just if we'll just seek for it.
[43:12] Lord, now's a time whether we're a
[43:13] Christian, not a Christian, whatever it
[43:15] is today. Lord, we've got a moment here.
[43:17] I believe you're trying to get our
[43:18] attention. Let us fix our hearts at this
[43:21] very moment just now. Let us turn our
[43:24] eyes upon you and consider the Lord of
[43:27] glory.
[43:29] May we not be weary and discouraged
[43:32] today in welloing, but may we press for
[43:34] the prize for the mark of the high
[43:36] calling, Lord, for the different needs
[43:38] that are represented here today. Lord,
[43:40] you have every answer that we would ever
[43:42] need if we only look to you, Lord. Speak
[43:46] to the hearts of these your children
[43:48] now. I pray and bless them we ask. We
[43:51] thank you in Jesus name. Amen. key of F
[43:54] I think it is. You know that song, Turn
[43:56] Your Eyes Upon Jesus. Let's just sing
[43:59] that for a moment. Just real sacred for
[44:01] just a moment. I I didn't know the
[44:03] service was going to go kind of this
[44:04] direction, but let's just let's just
[44:07] reverence him for a moment. Amen. Oh,
[44:09] turn
[44:11] your eyes upon Jesus.
[44:18] Look full in his wonderful
[44:23] face.
[44:26] And the things
[44:28] of earth will grow strangeely
[44:33] dim in the light of his glory
[44:39] and grace.
[44:42] Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[44:50] Look full in his wonderful
[44:55] face.
[44:58] And the things of earth will grow
[45:02] strangely [singing]
[45:04] dim in the light of his glory
[45:10] and grace. Once again,
[45:13] just turn your eyes upon you
[45:23] &gt;&gt; in his wonderful
[45:26] face.
[45:28] And the things [singing]
[45:30] of earth will grow strangely
[45:35] dim in [singing] the light of his glory
[45:40] and grace.
[45:42] Let's do that once more as our brother
[45:43] would come. Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
[45:54] in his wonderful
[45:56] face
[46:07] in the light of his glory and grace.
[46:15] in the presence
[46:21] of Jehovah. We'll sing that. Amen.
[46:27] in the presence
[46:33] of Jehovah,

[49:12] for more of you.

[52:49] Amen. I want to know you more, Lord. I
[52:53] want to know you more.
[52:58] Oh, I want to know you more.
[53:03] deep within my soul. I want to know you.
[53:08] Oh, I want to know you. To [singing]
[53:11] feel your heart and know your mind.
[53:16] Looking in your eyes stirs up within me.
[53:20] Cries that say, "I want to know you."
[53:27] Oh. Uh. Amen. Is that your desire? Make
[53:29] it known to him as you sing it.
[53:33] Oh, I want to know you more.
[53:37] Deep within my soul, I want to know you.
[53:42] Oh, I want to know you. And I would give
[53:47] my final breath.
[53:50] Know you in your death and resurrection.
[53:54] Oh, I want to know you more.
[54:01] Oh, I want to know you more.
[54:07] Amen. Oh, I want to see him.
[54:10] Oh, I want to see him.
[54:14] I want to see that invisible God. Amen.
[54:20] As I journey through the land, singing
[54:25] as I go, pointing souls to Calvary, to
[54:30] the crimson flow.
[54:33] Many arrows pierce my soul from
[54:36] withoutin.
[54:39] But my Lord leads me on, and through him
[54:43] I must win.
[54:45] Oh, I want to see him look upon his
[54:49] face.
[54:51] There to sing forever
[54:54] of his saving grace
[54:57] on the streets of glory.
[55:00] Let me lift my voice. Cares all pass.
[55:04] Home at last, ever to rejoice
[55:09] when in service for my Lord. Dark may be
[55:13] the night. We heard about it. But I'll
[55:15] cling more close to him. He will give me
