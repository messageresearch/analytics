here [Music] amen and i know you believe that you certainly wouldn't be here if you were just coming to hear me i mean maybe for the first time or the second time but after you see what i am then you're not going to come just for me because i'm not worth listening to but jesus is here his word is here his presence is here and he promised to do exceedingly above all that we could ask or even think of him amen i say it's a privilege to be gathered together while the doors are still open no one day things are only getting harder and harder and one day we won't have this grand privilege to be gathered together like this the hours getting darker and darker so we give the lord thanks amen turn with me if you would to the book of first thessalonians chapter one first thessalonians chapter one i want to say uh it's an honor a privilege to get to meet brother mark's friend brother jacob god bless you thank you for being with us and we pray that god would just bless you exceedingly amen amen we want to continue to pray for those that are not among us um the different needs and things that god would be with them such trying times we're living in god bless you all for for making your way to god's house today pray that god would bless you before we begin reading the scriptures let's look to the author in prayer heavenly father we thank you that you've given us health and strength to be here in your house today lord we are so grateful that you've placed a desire inside of a heart to want to be here there's many healthy people that could be here that could be assembled somewhere but lord the lord that desire is small that desire is missing so we cherish the desire you place in our heart for you lord to be attracted to you to be attracted to becoming more in your image and knowing that you've given us a five-fold ministry lord to bring us to that place of perfection lord as we go through these trying times with not having as many of the fivefold ministry lord we just pray that you make up the difference in our little church lord may you come and just anoint each heart and each life and give them what they have need of lord supply the faith for whatever need that they would have lord we commit this service in your hands now and pray that you bless not only the reading of the word lord but the hearing of the word we ask this now in jesus name and give you praise amen amen first thessalonians chapter one starting with verse number one paul and silvanus and timothy timothy timotheus unto the church of the thessalonians which is in god the father in our lord jesus christ grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ we give thanks to god always for you all making mention of you in our prayers remembering without ceasing your work of faith your labor of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ in the sight of god and our father knowing brethren beloved your election of god for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance says ye know what matter of men we were among you for your sake and he became followers of us and of our lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the holy ghost so that ye were in samples to all that believed in macedonia and akai for from you sounded out the word of the lord not only in macedonian and acadia but also in every place your faith to god's word is spread abroad so that we need not speak anything it's a good testimony for they themselves show of us what matter of entering in we had unto you and how he turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come amen god bless you may be seated the most important thing the word of god man shall not live by natural things but by every word that persecuted the mouth of god it's not just our daily bread our natural bread that is uh but anything natural that we put a lot of emphasis in men shall not live by natural things but by every word that perceive the mouth of god we need every word amen amen so this this little chapter here that we read it's uh we need this chapter need the nuggets in here there's a presidential election coming up i picked up my my ballot today for voting and the presidential election for the next four years is is going to be counted very soon the election day is is the third i believe and the people of the united states of america will elect their next president there are great hopes on both sides of the race yet no one really knows who's going to be elected the devil's got this world so messed up anything could happen even the unexpected i mean they they talk about uh uh tampering with the the the the the votes and things and and you just you just don't know right and that's why both candidates are out there and they're giving their best speeches and saying what they think is the best thing but who whoever gets elected is certainly going to know they've been elected they're going to know they're present usually they do some sort of celebration um and and they're going to exercise all the power that a president can until then uh these candidates can can talk about what they would do and how they're going to lower taxes and how they're going to uh do this and do that and they they make their claims or make their promises but they yet can't do anything because they're not elected yet but after they're elected they're going to be able to accomplish their agenda we hope that their agenda is what they say it's been stated that this presidential election coming up in november could be the most important in american history i'd like to entitle this message the most important election and for a subject tonight knowing your election i want to take our scripture from verse 4 knowing brethren beloved your election of god now until the election the candidates aren't really going to know they're elected so they're going to have to wait just like a lot of believers who really don't know their election they simply just don't know they've been elected or not right they're a christian but they don't know that they've been elected they don't know if they've been chosen because that's what that word means elected means chosen many believers don't understand the election of god they don't know their election some feel they they'll never know uh if they've been elected until the rapture happens some feel they're they're probably elected because they've accepted the message like they've been elected to the message knowing the prophet the truth that he brought us that that's that entitles them as as feeling that they're elected some feel they've probably uh are because they've made a commitment to god i i'm elected i know i'm elected because i made a commitment i have repented i got baptized and i've started on with the lord some have have made some good changes in their life by these commitments that they feel they've been elected and unfortunately some believers simply don't care to know whether they're elected or not if they if they found out if they were elected it would it would probably give them more responsibility and they just don't really want that so to this day they walk around not knowing their election and this is the most important election second peter chapter one verse nine second peter chapter one verse 9 but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins now i'll tell you something my precious brother and sister you never want to forget calvary what calvary meant to you what it did for you how it changed your attitude it changed your direction it changed what you wanted to do in life because satan would like nothing better than to come and try to present you a better christian one with a form of godliness one with just a a good boy and do good things something that you can accomplish on your own with your good deeds anything outside of calvary will come to naught calvary must change our nature it must be behind the good deeds we're for the rather brethren verse 10 give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall i looked at that word diligence it means to use speed use speed put the pedal to the metal to make effort to be prompt or earnest to endeavor to labor to study in other words don't just think it automatically happens you're in a race you haven't been elected just because you got in the race you need to to give diligence to make sure to use speed and to find out whether you've been elected or not the fact remains that we're all in a race some are running and some are standing around watching others some are using speed and some are taking it easy some are making effort and some are not wanting to suffer some are prompt some barely make it to church some labor some are lazy some study some are enjoying the pleasures of sin pleasures of flesh you understand there's and still calling themselves the same your flesh and your spirit are running against one another for the election the way the tree falls that's the way it lies right if we're not diligent about how we're running our race our opponent will end up winning the election right many many start out but they couldn't keep up with the pace the devil ain't giving up on us we have to put him in his place we have to he's not he's not going to give up he's filled with so much venom and hatred towards god he knows if he can grab a soul he's making god more angry the flesh really wants liberty to do what it wants right the spirit radio wants to see it crucified so god can have his way in their lives that's the battle that's going on this is the most important election you will ever ever be in don't run the race as one that beateth air not really knowing what you're doing in other words don't run with as the bible said uncertainly that means ambiguous ambiguously or variably unsure unpredictable unsettled undetermined in other words you're not all in you're kind of like lukewarm not hot don't run the race haphazardly you're going to lose the election wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and your election sure you can't guess at whether you're elected or not don't guess give diligence make sure you get elected you don't see somebody running for uh an election and they're just putzing around oh yeah i'll just you know i'll have all my workers do it for me you know they'll get the word out they don't get up to the podium and speak and say well you know if you elected me i'd make sure we'd have a holiday called the popcorn day it's not a game so anybody that's serious about being elected they're they're seriously working for it it's not given to them and i just want to be real clear we don't choose god god chooses us he elects us but that doesn't mean we can sit around with an attitude of nothing it's it's contrary to the word we need to give diligence to make our calling and our election sure there's something that we have to do about it because satan's going like this all the time at us and telling us you're elected you don't have to do nothing just go to church that's not scripture jesus said many are called but few are elected only a few are elected only few are chosen the majority of the believers don't give diligence to make sure about it they're assuming yes man you'll come to me in that day lord lord i thought i was elected i thought i was chosen many believers feel they've been called into the race and absolutely but they really don't know if they've been elected to the wedding one of the great dangers of not knowing your election is you won't make yourselves ready for the marriage you're in limbo just kind of following others you know we're all following something you're going to make a decision to follow christ or you're going to follow another human being and there's so much danger in that because god will only let you follow a human so long and after a while i don't care who that human is it's going to begin to stink god wants us to keep our eyes on him we will fail one another you fail me you fail me you fail me when you don't say amen i fail you when i don't tell you what you want to hear we need to keep our eyes on jesus now just because we've been called doesn't mean we've been elected yet it's important to understand that we've got to get diligent about it now i'm not saying that you choose to be elected but i am saying that you have a part to play you have you got to play that part look at esther there were many women that were called to be the elected queen but only one was chosen now can you imagine if esther just said oh i know that i am elected but she never went through the the purification process but she just had the attitude of oh i know i'm elected i'm elected seed but she never subjected herself to what the king required of her she would have never made it so we can't just walk around and claim that we're elected with an attitude and and never subject herself to the purification process i believe the elected will go through that process amen and you have to force yourself to do it you don't want to do it but that's what makes us chosen elected of god she's the only one that will really really do exactly what the word says the other one added their own ideas along with the word and that's that's not a good characteristic to have amen it's your job to make sure that you've been chosen don't assume that you are make sure if you know that you've been called then it's time to give diligence to give speed to put forth effort to make sure that you're elected to make sure it's important if you never do find out that you've been elected you'll never take your rightful position in christ you'll never get the revelation if you never get the revelation that you've been elected you'll never start using your power as an elected official imagine if they just continue to not count the ballots and and and and never say which state won and it was always confusion and a whole year went and america never knew who their president was they would never be able to exercise their power as an elected official because they just don't know who's been elected that's why we've got to know we're elected because we've been given god-given powers [Music] as an elected official you have power to execute things you have power to make decisions that you couldn't make before you can the president can either dismantle the army or beef it up he's got those powers to control things as an elected official but if you don't know you're elected just call it but you don't know you're chosen as a christian as an elected official you can tell the devil to step aside i'm making a new law in my life this is what i'm going to do i'm going to stop doing that and i'm going to start doing that because you know that you're elected if you're just a uh well i'm a believer i've been called devil just push you around jesus said all power is given unto me i hold the keys as the supreme judge of hell death in a grave of a victory amen he holds those keys you know what jesus did with that power he gave it to his elected officials on the day of pentecost it's true that he gave his disciples power to cast out devils and heal all manner of diseases but when it came down to properly properly witnessing for jesus they did not possess the power to do it no sir without knowing they were elected they fought against one another they bragged about who was the greatest they were willing to fight physically but not spiritually they cursed they denied even knowing jesus they deserted him at the end when he needed him the most and they were all called peter followed me they called him and they came they dropped everything but they did not know they were elected jesus said in acts chapter 1 verse 8 but ye shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be proper witnesses unto me you shall be my elected officials and by this unconditional love that you'll manifest all men are going to know that you're my elected officials as a united states citizen you are protected by our constitution as written in 1787 with the same spirit that wrote our declaration of independence in 1776 which states we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and that they are endowed with their creator by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the constant of the govern that when any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall most likely to affect their safety and happiness isn't that beautiful that is uh that's what we're protected by but you know the devil wants to alter that i just say as an elected official jesus christ we hold the truth of god in our hearts our creator jesus christ has endowed us with power of the holy ghost unavailable rights that among these are the life of god living in me liberty to worship him from the dictates of our heart freedom from the flesh victory over sin joy unspeakable full of glory love to lay down my life for every soul created by our creator to win as many back to him as possible i have that right i have that right you know satan wants to take that right away from you and this is how he does it he gets you so busy right that you're not even thinking about it that's how he does it he's so deceptive put that in your notes brother mark for our men's meeting as the elect of jesus christ i secure these rights that when any form of spirit becomes destructive to these god-given rights to protect my soul i possess the power and the authority of god to cast down imaginations to cast down every high thing that exalteth itself against the constitution of god's word and bring it into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ to cast out doubts and fears and unbelief and to cast out sickness to resist and rebuke the devil and his lies in the name of jesus christ i have these rights from god as an elected official to rebuke worldliness ungodliness and temptations and self-pleasures to submit myself to god to take his yoke upon me to learn of him to please him every day in every way i have these rights now satan will do everything he can to destroy this to destruct this god-given right he'll plant all sorts of temptations get us off track but as the elective god i possess these rights and no man and no spirit can take them away can you say amen no principalities no powers no rulers no angels of darkness of this world no spiritual wickedness in high places no things present no things to come no height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord as an elected official if you know you've been elected you know your rights but if you're just called you don't know your rights you know there's a lot of people that live in america that don't know their rights but yet we have a constitution it's a lot of believers they say they're a christian but they don't know the rights of them are so confused they use their rights to fight against other people that realize we don't fight against flesh and blood we're fighting against spirits but you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be proper witnesses unto me you're going to be my elected officials there's something different about you i'm going to elect you to officially witness for me but he told him don't you go out and do it you make sure you wait for the promise because without it you'll just witness without me no matter what good intentions peter had he didn't have the power he didn't have the power to witness properly properly you can have a form of godliness but deny the power of the holy ghost the bible tells us so we can witness without that power peter tried it he tried to be a witness but he lacked the power he was physical he was emotional he brought passion to the pulpit he brought his sword we're following jesus are you with me boys but he lacked power think about that he had all the ump but he lacked power real power is the ability to lay down your life that's what real power is if all you do is talk to talk but you refuse to lay down your life you're operating by your own power when jesus was witnessing to pilate he says i have power to lay down my life and i have power to raise it up he spoke of the power it took to lay down your life jesus received strength in the garden to lay down his life when his flesh didn't want to do it he was crying out if it'd be possible let this cup pass for me you can do it lord you can do it father angels came and ministered because in his heart he took the attitude the the attitude the right amount of attitude amen not my will lord thine be done even if you don't feel it say it a lot of times the devil gets us to say things we don't even feel just put it back on them after a while you'll start believing it then you can say it like you're in an effect a elected official i've been elected on the bride get behind me satan but after peter and those 120 in the upper room received the holy ghost they were effective witnesses they could witness properly did they magically say different words no they had power to deny their life and stand for jesus in the midst of all persecution at one time saul had a sword he wanted to kill everybody that was in this way but after he received the holy ghost he willingly had power to lay down his life now you tell me what power is it's not talking about jesus it's about giving up your life to help some soul get to jesus that's power because what you have to do is you have to go you have to bypass your reputation and your time and your your pride and how you look about something it's not about us it's about him paul said in philippians chapter 3 verse 10 all that i might know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death that's what has to happen the power to witness properly is being made conformable unto this death daily i die daily paul said if by any means i might attain to the resurrection of the dead and then he goes on he's still talking about this power all that i might know him and the power not as though i had already attained either already perfect but i follow after if i might apprehend this power for which i also have been apprehended by the power of god brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do i'm forgetting those things which are behind me and are reaching forth for those things which are before i press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus when you think of the greatest thing that jesus christ did what do you think calvary that's the pentacle that's what you think that's where death happened that's where he proved his love that's where he proved his greatest power well when we looked there in the book of revelations uh when when the angel spoke and said spoke about the who overcame the lion that that overcame and they looked and we looked they saw a lamb john saw a lamb showing the real power was to lay down your life you want to witness lay down give up your will give up everything and get that person to jesus christ that's power you have the right to tell satan to get behind you as an elected official this is the most important election give diligence to make sure that you've been elected because when you're elected you're exercising your rights over the devil and you're laying down your life for your brethren until then it can get a little bit crossed you're stepping over your brethren praise the lord if you believe you've been elected then start exercising your rights make new laws for your life don't tell i can't do this i can't do i can't overcome i can't i can't i can't you're an official you've been elected enforce them kick the devil out even jesus had to say get behind me get the heads satan he said it staring at peter he said it in his mind when satan was attacking his mind and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and gave him the scripture and just quote it watch these angels pick you up hey satan is real if we don't get real about what's being spoken to our minds we're an elect lady we're a chosen generation we're a royal priesthood we've been elected to be miss jesus going to take our position it's the most important election we can cast out all devils we can lay down our lives for others first john chapter 3 verse 16 says hereby first john chapter 3 verse 16 hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us as an elected official we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren he's showing here the pinnacle of the love of jesus the love of god he lay down his life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son showing the pinnacle and then he's turning around and saying we ought to be doing that same pinnacle and paul is referring to you i'm pressing towards the mark for the prize of the high calling in christ jesus as jesus lay down his life for me at calvary oh may i lay down my life for somebody to come to know jesus christ that's the only way you can really prove how much you love god we need to put on the whole armor of god amen let's stand together i had in my heart that i kept you so long sunday i want to do a short one on wednesday got to keep the balance i hope i got the message across learn to lean i'm learning to lean i'm learning to lean on [Music] gaining more power than i've ever seen i'm learning to lean on jesus learning to lean learning to [Music] [Music] gaining more power than i've ever seen i'm learning to lean on g one more time [Music] i'm learning to lean on [Music] jesus more power than i've ever seen i'm learning to lean on jesus hey man if i could get you to bow your heads just a moment and perhaps if you would just close your eyes i'm not looking around every eye is closed every head is about uh i believe only the lord is seen i wonder if there'd be someone here today who really hasn't officially been elected you know you've been called but perhaps you weren't even aware of the election didn't know there was a place of adoption for you but you you want to use diligence to find out if you've been elected god sees your heart today i wonder if there'd be someone here today that believe they've been elected but they haven't been acting like they've won the race like they've been elected and today you want to exercise those rights that god has given you as an elected official i wonder if there would be someone here today feels you've got the power of the holy ghost but it's been hard for you to lay down your life to be a witness wherever you're at today i want to encourage you to forget those things which are behind i want you to press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling god sees your heart he sees your your life and he's calling you to that position you're placing with christ to where he can use you to save souls his eternal purpose pray with me pray with me god just grant to you the desires of your heart in this message today our heavenly father lord we lay ourselves before you lord all things are open lord we've opened our hearts we've answered the questions honestly lord you've spoken your word and lord we're here desiring more of you lord desiring more power to represent you to be a proper witness lord and not just talk about it but lord give up our our lives to see some soul be saved just like you gave up your life as the disciples gave up their lives lord they they were so filled with joy lord even through their persecutions their trials they never said well maybe we should just try a different career no they went right back preaching the word oh god give us that power of the holy ghost give us the power that's missing lord in our lives father god i pray that you touch every life here lord answer every yearning and desire of the heart lord that's here wanting lord to be a representation lord of you down here on this on this planet father in this dark world that we're we're living in lord help us in our prayer closet lord to give diligence to make sure lord where we're standing with you father that we're carrying out your will we're exercising all the rights you've given us in our homes in our families and lord and our jobs and our church and lord that we could take a stand together against the enemy oh granted lord we pray we commit ourselves to you lord those those that are listening
