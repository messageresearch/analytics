[37:09] Jesus Christ by the Commandment of God
[37:13] Our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:15] which is Our Hope unto Timothy my own
[37:19] son in the faith so this is real
[37:22] personal grace mercy and peace from God
[37:25] our Father and Jesus Christ Our Lord as
[37:29] I besought Thee to abide still in
[37:31] Ephesus when I went to Macedonia that
[37:36] thou might as charge some
[37:39] that they teach no other Doctrine
[37:44] neither give heed to Fables
[37:47] and endless genealogies which minister
[37:52] questions
[37:54] rather than
[37:56] golly edifine which is in faith so do so
[38:02] so Timothy is being instructed
[38:05] now the end of the Commandment is
[38:08] charity
[38:09] I don't think there's any question
[38:12] with that do you
[38:15] shouldn't be any questions without the
[38:16] end of the Commandment is Charity out of
[38:19] a pure heart and of a good conscious and
[38:22] of faith unfeigned
[38:24] from which some having swerved have
[38:29] turned aside
[38:31] from the end of the Commandment unto
[38:34] vain jangling
[38:37] Desiring to be teachers of the law
[38:40] and understanding neither what they say
[38:43] nor whereof they affirm
[38:49] but we know that the law is good if a
[38:52] man uses it lawfully
[38:55] God bless you may be seated
[39:01] amen we want to entitle this message
[39:02] Undisputed love
[39:06] and for a subject
[39:07] I want to talk about obeying the end of
[39:11] the law
[39:12] as Christ fulfilled the law
[39:16] and came and died for us
[39:18] leaving us an example that we are to to
[39:22] fulfill the end of the Commandment of
[39:25] the law and help others
[39:28] and I want just in Simplicity want to
[39:31] provoke us
[39:33] to focus on
[39:37] uh
[39:40] an opportunity that we all have
[39:43] to love during the hardest times
[39:50] um
[39:51] Christ did it for us and I believe if
[39:55] Christ is living in US
[39:57] we should be able to do it for others
[39:59] and too often we set aside the most
[40:02] important thing and we go on to I don't
[40:04] want to say vain janglings but we depart
[40:07] from
[40:08] the most important thing now the end of
[40:11] the Commandment is Charity out of a pure
[40:14] heart
[40:17] now before
[40:19] Christ came into our lives we've viewed
[40:25] um
[40:27] the Bible reviewed God and we were
[40:31] taught by our mom and dad good and bad
[40:35] and we realized that we were in big
[40:39] trouble if we didn't get salvation
[40:40] because we weren't able to be good
[40:45] Romans 3 verse 10 says as it is written
[40:48] there is none righteous no not one there
[40:50] is none that understandeth there is none
[40:53] that seeketh after the god they have all
[40:55] gone out of their way they are together
[40:58] become unprofitable and there's none
[41:00] that doeth good no not one
[41:02] for their throat is an open scepter and
[41:06] there are tongues they have used deceit
[41:08] the poison of ass is under their lips
[41:11] whose mouth is full of cursing and
[41:13] bitterness their feet are Swift to shed
[41:16] blood destruction and misery in their
[41:18] ways and the way of peace they have not
[41:20] known there's no fear of God before
[41:22] their eyes and now
[41:23] we know that what things so ever the law
[41:27] saith it says to them that are under the
[41:28] law that every mouth may be stopped and
[41:30] that the world may become guilty before
[41:33] God
[41:35] amen therefore by the Deeds of the law
[41:36] shall no flesh be justified in the sight
[41:39] in his sight for by the law is the
[41:43] knowledge of sin
[41:46] so when we knew the truth it just
[41:48] brought condemnation to us
[41:51] it brought a con a conviction and a
[41:55] condemnation because
[41:58] we were wrong
[42:00] and and inside of us we we just couldn't
[42:03] get it right
[42:05] so I used to think of the Old Testament
[42:08] as as just the law in the New Testament
[42:10] was was like Grace
[42:13] I used to think we didn't have to listen
[42:16] to the law anymore because Grace had
[42:18] come
[42:19] I used to think that I I could have
[42:23] Liberty to basically do whatever I want
[42:25] now because I'm under grace I'm no
[42:28] longer under the law
[42:30] I used to think God's grace was a a game
[42:33] changer
[42:34] for my flesh
[42:36] gave me liberty to do what I want I
[42:39] don't have to listen to anybody anymore
[42:41] I don't have to do what they want me to
[42:43] do that I'm a free man I've been set
[42:46] free and I have Liberty
[42:49] are you with me
[42:50] isn't it amazing how the devil takes
[42:53] God's word and twists it bad I don't
[42:57] have to listen to anybody anymore
[43:00] it was like using my Liberty for a cloak
[43:03] for my flesh
[43:06] but that was just carnal understanding
[43:08] [Music]
[43:09] Psalms 19 verse 7 says the law of the
[43:13] Lord is perfect
[43:16] it is so good it converts the soul the
[43:19] law of the Lord will convert the soul
[43:22] and if it wasn't for God's law none of
[43:25] us would be here today none of us would
[43:28] be saved
[43:30] God's law is filled with love
[43:34] because God is love you can't separate
[43:38] and if we love him we will continue
[43:41] to keep his Commandments
[43:46] yet the law when it was presented to us
[43:50] it condemned us
[43:52] because it proved that we were sinners
[43:56] going straight to hell
[43:58] but God fulfilled his own law and
[44:02] provided away back for us
[44:05] he didn't do away with it he fulfilled
[44:08] it and this is what is on my heart and
[44:10] I'll just say it like this I we've had
[44:12] some ministering Brothers I'd just been
[44:14] sitting back taking my time studying and
[44:16] I just thought this is going to be
[44:17] wonderful I got my message and then two
[44:19] days ago when I was praying in the
[44:21] morning it was a completely different
[44:24] subject
[44:27] and I'll tell you the burden that's on
[44:28] my heart is that we need to learn how to
[44:33] love like God loves
[44:34] [Music]
[44:36] we need to know how to handle life the
[44:39] way that God handled life
[44:41] I mean this was a serious thing coming
[44:43] down to the Earth and given his own life
[44:47] on the cross that we could be saved the
[44:49] least that we could do is laid on our
[44:51] life for others the very least we could
[44:53] do
[45:00] there's a part of the law of God's
[45:02] Commandment that is often overlooked
[45:05] in its Undisputed love
[45:08] agape love
[45:12] it's the end of the Commandment
[45:16] it's charity out of a pure heart there's
[45:18] that part of the the word the
[45:22] Commandment that we're supposed to
[45:23] follow
[45:24] that is often overlooked
[45:28] Romans 10 tells us for Christ is the end
[45:31] of the law for righteousness to everyone
[45:33] that believeth Christ is the end of the
[45:36] law
[45:38] for God so loved the world that he gave
[45:41] his only begotten son
[45:44] that was the end of the Commandment that
[45:47] he came and he fulfilled the law he
[45:50] didn't just say you're guilty you're
[45:52] guilty you're guilty and leave you there
[45:54] in that mess and so often we look at
[45:57] others you're guilty you're guilty and
[45:58] we just kind of like leave it go
[46:01] and we leave out the most important
[46:04] thing which is which is Charity go meet
[46:07] the need
[46:09] go help the situation
[46:14] God hasn't called us to be Christians to
[46:16] sit back and say look at all the
[46:18] problems
[46:20] he's called us to meet the need
[46:28] Romans 8 verse 3 tells us for what the
[46:31] law could not do in that it was weak
[46:34] through the flesh God sending his own
[46:38] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[46:41] for sin condemn sin in the flesh
[46:46] see
[46:48] we were too weak
[46:51] to do the right thing
[46:54] so God came and he took care of it for
[46:56] us
[46:58] and now that we're filled with God when
[47:01] we see others that are too weak to be
[47:04] following the word that Christ should
[47:07] come and be manifested out of your life
[47:09] and help meet the need not talk about it
[47:14] not just roll over in your mind and
[47:17] allow the devil just to keep planting
[47:20] negativity about the situation
[47:24] but let the end of the Commandment rise
[47:27] up inside of you and go meet the need
[47:29] because that's what a true Christian is
[47:38] the Fallen nature of man
[47:41] was too weak to fulfill the law of God
[47:45] but God never abolished the law
[47:49] and he never led us off the hook either
[47:52] he went and fulfilled the law so as we
[47:55] sit there and we look at others and we
[47:57] say there's a need there and they should
[47:58] be and they should know better and they
[48:00] should be doing it and how long have
[48:01] they been a Christian
[48:03] and we sit there and we have thoughts
[48:05] like that I say to you when are we going
[48:08] to let Christ inside of us go and
[48:10] fulfill the law and help them
[48:15] it's not about us sitting and and
[48:18] judging everybody and and and saying
[48:21] where everybody is lacking
[48:23] you don't even have to be spiritual all
[48:25] you got to do is listen to The Devil
[48:26] he's the accuser of the brother
[48:29] but it when it takes a spiritual person
[48:31] to rise up above the problem and go meet
[48:34] the need like a Christian does don't
[48:36] even have to talk about just go do it
[48:39] because that's what Christ did
[48:41] he abolished you from having to pay the
[48:44] penalty of your sin by paying it himself
[48:48] he abolished us from being trapped in a
[48:52] nature that couldn't find its way out of
[48:54] a what paper bag
[48:59] Ephesians 2 if you want to turn with me
[49:02] there
[49:04] Ephesians 2
[49:07] .
[49:16] foreign
[49:17] this pretty much sums it up
[49:21] that at that time verse 12 that at that
[49:24] time ye were without Christ being aliens
[49:26] from the Commonwealth of Israel and
[49:28] strangers from the covenants of Promise
[49:31] having no hope and without God in the
[49:33] world I remember that feeling as sh is
[49:37] clear
[49:41] and I couldn't go
[49:44] to my dad to my mom
[49:47] I mean I tried I went to a Catholic
[49:50] praise I tried
[49:52] but I'll tell you I was without hope
[49:55] because I didn't see Christ there
[50:00] but when you get serious with God God
[50:03] will get serious with you
[50:06] because God is truly interested in all
[50:09] of your heart
[50:11] he's interested in taking the throne
[50:13] room of your heart
[50:16] but now in Christ Jesus ye were ye who
[50:19] were sometimes were afar off are made
[50:21] nigh by the blood of Christ
[50:24] for he is our peace
[50:27] who have made both one and have broken
[50:29] down the middle wall partition between
[50:30] us having abolished in his flesh
[50:34] the enmity even the law of Commandments
[50:38] contained in the ordinance for to make
[50:41] in himself of Twain one new person so
[50:45] making peace
[50:47] see Christ fulfilled what the law
[50:51] required
[50:53] he fulfilled the law of Commandments he
[50:57] went and paid the penalty so we didn't
[51:00] have to he didn't do away with the law
[51:02] he fulfilled the law
[51:06] and now that same God that did that at
[51:10] Calvary
[51:11] lives inside of us
[51:14] he's just
[51:18] as real just as powerful
[51:21] inside of us as he was on the cross
[51:26] and that he might reconcile both unto
[51:30] God in one body by the cross having slam
[51:31] the enmity thereby and came and preached
[51:34] peace to you which were afar off and to
[51:37] them that were nigh
[51:39] for through him we both have access by
[51:43] one Spirit unto the father
[51:44] now therefore you're no more strangers
[51:46] and foreigners but fellow citizens with
[51:49] the Saints and of the household of God
[51:51] and are built upon the foundation of the
[51:53] Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ
[51:55] himself being the Chief Cornerstone now
[51:57] look what should be happening in a
[52:01] church in whom all the body fitly framed
[52:06] together growth unto a holy Temple in
[52:09] the Lord in whom ye also are builded
[52:13] together for a habitation of God through
[52:17] the spirit
[52:19] that's why when we see things going on
[52:21] or things happening it could just be
[52:24] one-on-one or or or or anything if you
[52:28] begin to see confusion we need to be
[52:31] immediately praying
[52:34] because God is not the author of
[52:36] confusion he is the author of building
[52:39] his building so he can work Mighty
[52:41] things in his body
[52:45] it was God's Undisputed love that
[52:48] brought us back into fellowship with him
[52:52] and I'll tell you that's the same thing
[52:54] he ought to be doing inside of every one
[52:56] of us
[52:57] is bringing us back into Fellowship one
[53:00] with another
[53:02] and any spirit that doesn't do that I
[53:05] say get away from it
[53:07] you if you don't stand against it that
[53:10] means the enemy can use you now
[53:14] so you've got to recognize it in your
[53:16] thoughts
[53:19] Christ did not do away
[53:22] with his law but he fulfilled it himself
[53:24] because we couldn't
[53:26] he provided a way back for each of us
[53:30] Matthew chapter 5 verse 17.
[53:34] Jesus said think not that I come to
[53:36] destroy the law or the prophets I am not
[53:40] come to destroy it but to full fill it
[53:45] to fulfill it so I want you to put
[53:48] yourself in Jesus's shoes
[53:54] now he had the burden of the whole world
[53:57] on his shoulders
[53:59] and he he loved the whole world and he
[54:02] knew many would be would reject him
[54:06] but it didn't stop him from loving from
[54:10] giving
[54:11] and and when you are faced with problems
[54:15] in life usually they have to do what
[54:18] somebody
[54:20] usually they have to do what somebody
[54:24] you put a face even if you got a problem
[54:26] with a bank you put a face to that bank
[54:30] right it's usually a somebody
[54:34] now here's the thing and I'm mainly
[54:36] talking amongst us as Christians but
[54:39] it's our family as well
[54:42] now are you going to fulfill the law or
[54:45] are you going to do away with part of
[54:48] the law
[54:49] and bring judgment
[54:51] because see
[54:53] to accept the law
[54:58] to accept the word
[55:02] to obey the word is love
[55:07] and to reject
[55:10] the end of the Commandment which is
[55:12] Charity of a pure heart is to accept
[55:14] judgment
[55:17] love proceeds judgment
[55:21] Mercy rejoices over judgment
[55:25] and we we're always thinking about what
[55:28] is right what is wrong and and this that
[55:31] should be done and that should be done
[55:32] and we're missing being able to fulfill
[55:35] the law of God in our life
[55:39] it's like to me problems present
[55:41] opportunities for Christ to be magnified
[55:45] and too often we sit there talking I say
[55:49] it's vein jaggling
[55:52] you know trying to describe what we
[55:54] think is right or wrong
[55:56] well we don't even need help doing that
[55:58] the devil tells us that
[56:01] but what we're looking for is Christ
[56:03] manifested
[56:05] Christ manifested in Me God coming in me
[56:09] and
[56:10] manifest charity
[56:14] yeah now I need a spiritual heart to
[56:17] understand
[56:18] what I'm saying
[56:24] I'm not saying ignore the problem I'm
[56:26] not saying being a pushover
[56:29] I'm not saying putting blinders on
[56:31] I'm saying rolling up your sleeves get
[56:33] your hands dirty
[56:37] get down on your knees
[56:40] and help the situation
[56:43] if we can't do that
[56:47] if we can't do it zip the lip
[56:52] and then get on your knees go and pray
[56:54] until God fills you with him because he
[56:57] knows how to handle the problem
[57:00] he did it at Calvary if he could do it
[57:02] at Calvary he can do it today if he's
[57:04] he's the same yesterday today and
[57:06] forever if we believe this message this
[57:09] message should be living in US
[57:11] no wonder the prophet said whatever you
[57:13] do lay everything aside until you go get
[57:16] perfect love because that is the
[57:18] Fulfillment of the law right amen
[57:22] the Fulfillment
[57:26] all right
[57:27] think not that I come to destroy law or
[57:29] the prophets that come not to destroy
[57:31] but to fulfill Verse 18 for verily I say
[57:33] unto you till Heaven and Earth shall
[57:35] pass away one jot or one Tittle shall in
[57:39] what no Wise from the law
[57:43] passed from the law to all be fulfilled
[57:49] God would not
[57:53] go through
[57:57] time on Earth
[57:59] without fulfilling the law
[58:05] he just could not let his own die
[58:10] he couldn't
[58:14] no more could you let your children die
[58:17] God could not let his children die
[58:20] but his own children could not find a
[58:24] way
[58:25] to perfectly please God
[58:28] because their nature was bad to begin
[58:30] with they had to be born again
[58:33] now the thing is we're dealing with
[58:35] others all the time with Cockapoo
[58:38] Natures with a black dog and a white dog
[58:40] and there's there's problems associated
[58:42] with people and this is providing an
[58:45] opportunity for Christ to live in US
[58:49] because I'll tell you this Christ does
[58:50] not look down on us and say oh look at
[58:53] brother John he's so smart
[58:56] he knows he knows what's right
[59:01] no I believe the Holy Ghost wants to see
[59:04] Christ Living Through Me
[59:07] living it out
[59:09] his word will not return unto him void
[59:15] the law is important to God and he
[59:18] expects us to fulfill it right
[59:21] right look at verse 19.
[59:23] just think about our attitude right now
[59:26] whosoever therefore shall break one of
[59:29] these what's that next word
[59:32] least
[59:34] Commandments
[59:37] and shall teach
[59:40] men
[59:42] to do the same
[59:44] he shall be called
[59:46] the least
[59:48] in the Kingdom
[59:49] of Heaven
[59:53] can you imagine would you like to go to
[59:55] heaven and be called the least
[59:58] you're the least
[1:00:01] because you thought some of God's word
[1:00:05] was not that big a deal
[1:00:08] it you don't
[1:00:11] referencing the sanctuary I mean
[1:00:19] and then you're going to teach that same
[1:00:21] thing
[1:00:24] well look that's just a little overboard
[1:00:26] I mean just what are you doing
[1:00:30] what are you doing
[1:00:32] God sent a prophet to make it clear what
[1:00:35] we should be doing
[1:00:37] [Music]
[1:00:39] right and our attitudes could keep us
[1:00:41] away from the word of God if we look at
[1:00:43] the word we start dissecting what's
[1:00:45] important what's not important what we
[1:00:47] got to pay attention to what the prophet
[1:00:49] said what we don't what we're doing is
[1:00:51] we're we're believing and teaching that
[1:00:54] it's not that big a deal
[1:00:58] how is God looking at that
[1:01:02] but whosoever shall do and teach them
[1:01:05] the same Shall be Called great
[1:01:08] in the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:01:12] so
[1:01:14] if you get that attitude well that's
[1:01:16] okay if I don't help it's okay if I
[1:01:18] don't go the second amount it's okay if
[1:01:19] I don't turn the chi it's okay it's okay
[1:01:21] God understands
[1:01:25] foreign
[1:01:29] for I say unto you that accept your
[1:01:32] righteousness exceed the righteousness
[1:01:34] of the scribes and the Pharisees you
[1:01:36] shall no case enter the kingdom of
[1:01:39] heaven
[1:01:42] well Jesus said unless you have faith as
[1:01:44] a child you can't enter in so you've got
[1:01:46] to have faith as a child to enter in and
[1:01:49] now your righteousness has to exceed the
[1:01:51] righteousness of the of the Pharisees
[1:01:54] don't belittle the Pharisees don't be be
[1:01:57] little someone
[1:02:01] don't downgrade some believer
[1:02:04] make sure you're doing all they're doing
[1:02:07] and more
[1:02:10] don't be a despiser of those that are
[1:02:12] trying harder than you just because you
[1:02:14] don't want to try
[1:02:18] look Jesus expects you to do that and
[1:02:21] more
[1:02:22] of course our motives have to be right
[1:02:24] don't want to have a mode of wrong
[1:02:25] motive when we do it
[1:02:27] we want to fast we want to pray we want
[1:02:30] to seek God we just heard a wonderful
[1:02:32] sermon about we need to be hungering and
[1:02:34] thirsting after God panting after God
[1:02:36] like a deer pan and for the water Brook
[1:02:41] Jesus didn't do away with the law
[1:02:44] he fulfilled it
[1:02:46] and the end of the law is love
[1:02:49] and Grace brought it to us
[1:02:53] for God so loved the world that he gave
[1:02:56] to meet our need and that was the
[1:02:59] Fulfillment of the law
[1:03:03] the Bible says where sin abounded Grace
[1:03:06] did much more abound
[1:03:11] so when you come into a situation and
[1:03:14] somebody's not happy about something or
[1:03:16] you're not happy about something
[1:03:21] is Grace going to much more abound
[1:03:25] are you going to let grace abound
[1:03:27] through you are you going to let love
[1:03:28] abound through you are you going to hold
[1:03:30] it to yourself
[1:03:32] and say this love is for me
[1:03:38] well what happens when you do that
[1:03:39] you're not living for others you're not
[1:03:41] you're not expressing
[1:03:44] eternal life
[1:03:47] eternal life is living for others
[1:03:50] the law was given by Moses but Grace and
[1:03:54] Truth came by Jesus Christ
[1:03:59] we should all be manifesting more and
[1:04:02] more of Christ should we not
[1:04:03] every week goes by every month that goes
[1:04:06] by every year we should be seeing more
[1:04:08] and more of Christ to whom much is given
[1:04:11] much time is given much is required
[1:04:14] right John 1 14 and the Word was made
[1:04:17] flesh and dwelt among us and we behold
[1:04:19] his glory the glory as the only begotten
[1:04:21] of the father full of grace
[1:04:23] and full of Truth
[1:04:26] notice what comes first Grace
[1:04:28] then truth
[1:04:33] don't
[1:04:35] think it's you know if we spent more
[1:04:37] time being gracious towards others than
[1:04:39] than trying to prove that somebody else
[1:04:41] is wrong
[1:04:42] we'd probably get more accomplished amen
[1:04:45] John bear witness of him and Christ
[1:04:47] saying this was he of whom I spake he
[1:04:50] cometh after me is preferred before me
[1:04:52] for he was before me and of now I want
[1:04:55] you to catch this end of his fullness
[1:04:59] have all we received
[1:05:03] and Grace for Grace
[1:05:10] have you received his fullness
[1:05:19] you know Jesus said judge not that you
[1:05:21] be not judged
[1:05:24] Jesus said he that's without sin Let Him
[1:05:26] cast the first stone
[1:05:28] so I just say this to us have we
[1:05:31] received his fullness or have we just
[1:05:33] received a part
[1:05:37] you know because the Pharisees were very
[1:05:39] quick
[1:05:40] to judge others
[1:05:43] they were also very quick to say that
[1:05:45] they were more special than others
[1:05:49] and they were able to you know this is
[1:05:51] why this is why
[1:05:54] but
[1:05:56] we need to be full of grace
[1:05:59] let your conversation always be with
[1:06:01] Grace
[1:06:02] coupled with fear the Bible says
[1:06:06] if we have received the spirit of Christ
[1:06:08] then people should be able to Behold a
[1:06:12] life full of grace and truth
[1:06:18] when the word was made flesh in you
[1:06:22] it will fulfill when the word is made
[1:06:26] flesh in you it will fulfill the
[1:06:28] Commandment of God it will it will bring
[1:06:32] about the end of the Commandment which
[1:06:34] is Charity out of a pure heart
[1:06:37] and that should be your goal God let me
[1:06:40] not leave here without a determination
[1:06:43] that when
[1:06:45] things aren't going right that charity
[1:06:49] is manifested
[1:06:53] it's okay I believe it's okay to judge I
[1:06:56] do
[1:06:57] I just I've just never
[1:06:59] I've always kind of like held that in
[1:07:01] I've really never told you
[1:07:05] I think it's okay to judge
[1:07:07] yourself
[1:07:11] you want to exercise judgment judge
[1:07:13] yourself
[1:07:15] but with others
[1:07:17] do what Christ did
[1:07:19] he judges nothing before its time and he
[1:07:21] hasn't judged anybody yet
[1:07:25] there's a Time coming for that and
[1:07:27] really all judgment belongs to him
[1:07:29] anyways what are we going to go go we're
[1:07:31] going to go to God and say look what he
[1:07:33] did to me look what she did to me look
[1:07:34] what they did to me look what they said
[1:07:36] to me look they knife me in the back
[1:07:38] they said this they did that God won't
[1:07:40] you do something
[1:07:45] that's the same thing Satan does
[1:07:48] the same thing he's the accuser of the
[1:07:51] brethren
[1:07:55] that God is looking for us to be full of
[1:07:58] grace
[1:08:01] hey if we can't forgive others we're in
[1:08:04] trouble
[1:08:05] we're in big trouble if we can't forgive
[1:08:06] others
[1:08:08] but this isn't so much about forgiving
[1:08:10] others this is about being able to go
[1:08:12] and fulfill the law
[1:08:15] to to
[1:08:16] for you not to look at somebody and say
[1:08:19] they're missing it when the moment that
[1:08:22] you're doing that you're missing it
[1:08:26] you're not you're not bringing about the
[1:08:29] Fulfillment of God's commandment in your
[1:08:31] life which is to go meet that need
[1:08:40] I want sin to abound in US much more
[1:08:46] when there's a problem going happening
[1:08:50] it's an opportunity to say God
[1:08:53] you're still on the throne you're still
[1:08:55] in my heart you still Reign you still
[1:08:59] got power
[1:09:01] to take care of this situation you know
[1:09:03] a lot of times we're so full of fear we
[1:09:06] don't know what to do
[1:09:10] but you know what if you just
[1:09:12] believe in the reality of God in your
[1:09:15] life God will use you to help that
[1:09:18] situation
[1:09:21] we encounter a lot of problems in our
[1:09:23] homes
[1:09:25] and in our church
[1:09:28] any amends on that
[1:09:33] and oftentimes we feel unequipped
[1:09:36] to handle them
[1:09:38] we kind of uh
[1:09:40] just ignore it
[1:09:42] right
[1:09:43] well I tried you know
[1:09:45] are you with me
[1:09:48] but you know we're we're pretty quick to
[1:09:51] point out somebody's fault so
[1:09:54] we're not really
[1:09:56] lacking
[1:09:58] in that
[1:10:01] maybe talk about somebody's sins or
[1:10:03] wrong Spirit or their carnality or their
[1:10:05] ugly nature that's that's being
[1:10:08] coming about
[1:10:11] and so for some of us the story just
[1:10:14] seems to end there with our conclusion
[1:10:17] of some verbal judgment
[1:10:21] and then it's done
[1:10:24] but sometimes we'll even talk negatively
[1:10:26] about it to others
[1:10:30] that happens in our homes
[1:10:32] in our church come on
[1:10:35] but very Southern do we notice that
[1:10:38] there's more grace abounding in the
[1:10:41] situation than the problem
[1:10:44] very sound do we see
[1:10:46] abounding grace and somebody rising up
[1:10:49] to just can to help the situation
[1:10:54] it's like where is the faith
[1:10:57] that God is in you
[1:11:06] it's an opportunity
[1:11:09] Paul said to the Roman church but if the
[1:11:12] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:11:14] the dead dwells in you he that raised up
[1:11:17] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[1:11:19] your moral bodies by the spirit that
[1:11:21] dwells in you
[1:11:23] now we know what Christ would do if we
[1:11:26] were in sin
[1:11:27] he would go to Calvary
[1:11:31] he would go
[1:11:33] help
[1:11:35] he would lay down his life
[1:11:37] so if Christ in US
[1:11:40] is living in US
[1:11:42] is will he not do the same thing
[1:11:45] it's got to be more than a form of
[1:11:47] godliness
[1:11:48] there's got to be a Living Word a Living
[1:11:52] Word
[1:11:56] brother Branham says it's not the action
[1:11:58] but the reaction that counts
[1:12:01] how are we going to react are we going
[1:12:03] to react with love
[1:12:05] and Grace
[1:12:06] are we going to react in the flesh
[1:12:11] now this has happened so many times in
[1:12:14] her life has it not
[1:12:17] it should cause us to ask questions to
[1:12:21] ourselves
[1:12:22] have we received enough Holy Spirit to
[1:12:27] supply Grace that's needed for our
[1:12:29] problem
[1:12:31] just a simple question it ought to calls
[1:12:33] us
[1:12:34] because look it doesn't take money
[1:12:37] it doesn't take Fame doesn't take
[1:12:39] Fortune it takes the Holy Ghost
[1:12:42] [Music]
[1:12:44] that's all it takes the Holy Ghost
[1:12:49] I understand the law of the word
[1:12:52] and I understand that they shouldn't
[1:12:54] have done it I understand that
[1:12:56] but we have received the Fulfillment of
[1:12:59] the law
[1:13:00] so we can go help meet their need
[1:13:06] but ask the question have I received
[1:13:08] enough Christ to see the situation
[1:13:10] through
[1:13:11] have I received the end of the
[1:13:13] Commandment which is Charity out of a
[1:13:14] pure heart have I received enough Holy
[1:13:17] Spirit to get my hands dirty
[1:13:20] or am I just going to kind of slip out
[1:13:22] of the church
[1:13:24] am I just going to kind of avoid
[1:13:27] do you want the Holy Ghost to avoid you
[1:13:29] when you got a problem
[1:13:31] do you want him to say oh we're getting
[1:13:33] away from them because you know
[1:13:36] no no
[1:13:37] but why why would why would you think
[1:13:40] the Holy Ghost in you would have a
[1:13:42] different attitude
[1:13:45] I'll say it like this how long will you
[1:13:47] let the devil convince you there's
[1:13:49] nothing you can do to help them
[1:13:51] man
[1:13:53] how long are you going to let the devil
[1:13:55] say to you well God's just got to speak
[1:13:57] to their heart
[1:14:01] it's all in God's hands
[1:14:04] well what are your hands for
[1:14:07] that what are your feet for what's your
[1:14:09] mouth for
[1:14:11] I mean grace needs to be abounding
[1:14:13] through us
[1:14:16] when are we going to rise up and believe
[1:14:17] that God the god that dwells in this is
[1:14:20] also capable of helping the situation
[1:14:24] it's like you got to put your
[1:14:27] the money where your mouth is at
[1:14:32] it's easy to say I'm in the message
[1:14:35] I'm a Believer
[1:14:38] how about just saving some of that
[1:14:40] energy and living it out
[1:14:42] come on it's time for us to to manifest
[1:14:46] Undisputed love
[1:14:49] it's time for us to rise up and let
[1:14:51] Grace more abound in the situation than
[1:14:55] the problem
[1:14:57] it's like we don't know what to do when
[1:14:59] there's a problem
[1:15:02] how are we going to overcome if we don't
[1:15:03] know what to do
[1:15:08] just get your hands dirty get in there
[1:15:10] fall fail make a mistake
[1:15:13] but do something
[1:15:16] do something show that you love
[1:15:20] show them that you love
[1:15:23] amen show them that you care show them
[1:15:26] that you believe in grace show them that
[1:15:28] you believe in forgiveness show them
[1:15:30] that that you believe at the end of the
[1:15:32] Commandment is Charity out of your Pure
[1:15:34] Heart
[1:15:37] yes amen
[1:15:41] because all we're doing is we're just
[1:15:43] being a Pharisee if we don't
[1:15:45] fulfill the word
[1:15:47] it's a modern message Pharisee
[1:15:53] now I know that's not making you you
[1:15:55] know be excited about the message but I
[1:15:57] just need us to understand that
[1:16:01] that we need to be doing what this
[1:16:03] message says and not just listening to
[1:16:05] the message to get out the parts that we
[1:16:07] enjoy
[1:16:08] the real message is Jesus Christ is the
[1:16:11] same yesterday today and forever and if
[1:16:13] he's not going to be manifested in me at
[1:16:15] the time of the rapture
[1:16:17] what good is it going to do
[1:16:21] it wouldn't be good it would if I could
[1:16:24] prove
[1:16:25] to 90 percent of the message Believers
[1:16:28] that I was literally better than them
[1:16:34] what could would it do if I don't
[1:16:37] fulfill the word of God
[1:16:42] so it doesn't matter
[1:16:44] if I'm better or you're worse
[1:16:47] what really matters is that I I love God
[1:16:51] enough to try to help you and that you
[1:16:53] love God enough to try to help me that's
[1:16:56] what matters
[1:17:01] John chapter 12 verse 46
[1:17:04] .
[1:17:07] I am come a light into the world of that
[1:17:10] whosoever believeth on me should not
[1:17:12] abide in darkness
[1:17:14] and if any man hear my words and believe
[1:17:16] not I judge him not
[1:17:17] I came not to judge the world but to
[1:17:21] save the world and let me ask you a
[1:17:23] question has has God
[1:17:26] judged the world yet
[1:17:30] yeah
[1:17:32] why would we be doing it why would we be
[1:17:35] stepping in
[1:17:38] the only judgment that's taking place is
[1:17:41] in the bride of Christ who judge
[1:17:44] themselves who allow God to come in and
[1:17:46] judge himself that's the Judgment that's
[1:17:48] taking place
[1:17:51] but there's no Force judgment happening
[1:17:56] there is a conviction knocks on the
[1:17:58] heart of God when he speaks on a heart
[1:18:00] hey go make that thing right
[1:18:04] go say I'm sorry
[1:18:07] go say I forgive you go pray with that
[1:18:10] person
[1:18:15] verse 48 he that rejecteth me and
[1:18:18] receiveth my words has one that judge
[1:18:21] him well when's that going to happen the
[1:18:23] word that I've spoken the same shall
[1:18:25] judge him in the last day
[1:18:28] for I have not
[1:18:30] spoken of myself but the Father which
[1:18:33] sent me he gave me a commandment what I
[1:18:35] should say and what I should speak and I
[1:18:37] know that his commandment his life
[1:18:39] Everlasting whatsoever I speak therefore
[1:18:42] even as the father of spoken so I speak
[1:18:47] the Fulfillment of the law is love but
[1:18:50] the rejection of the law is judgment
[1:18:55] brother Branham told us that when love
[1:18:58] is projected
[1:19:00] Sovereign Grace will take over
[1:19:06] how many is inter how many would love
[1:19:08] that God would use you all the time to
[1:19:10] speak things into existence wouldn't
[1:19:12] that be awesome
[1:19:15] oh well we could tell people about it
[1:19:17] you know what I mean
[1:19:21] but don't you want to see love projected
[1:19:23] out of you
[1:19:26] does Sovereign Grace could just take
[1:19:28] over the situation
[1:19:30] well the end of the Commandment is
[1:19:32] charity
[1:19:34] amen you know one of the prophets said
[1:19:35] whatever you do go go get perfect love
[1:19:37] lay everything aside until you get it
[1:19:40] it's not just a fine quote that we can
[1:19:42] think about once in a while it's to
[1:19:44] whomsoever will receive that and I
[1:19:47] believe the bride is going to catch that
[1:19:49] and they're going to play aside other
[1:19:51] things until they get it
[1:19:55] God who is rich in Mercy for his great
[1:19:58] love wherewith he loved us even when we
[1:20:01] were dead in our sins have quickened us
[1:20:03] together with Christ by grace are ye
[1:20:06] saved
[1:20:09] now Jesus wants to see the same thing in
[1:20:11] US
[1:20:13] he wants to use our body
[1:20:16] he don't care what we look like
[1:20:18] he don't care how old we are
[1:20:21] he don't care about her shape our size
[1:20:23] he don't care about our age he don't
[1:20:25] care about our intelligence
[1:20:28] he doesn't care what we know in fact the
[1:20:31] less you know the better chance
[1:20:34] because it takes so much to empty out
[1:20:37] and he wants to take your vessel
[1:20:40] and he wants you
[1:20:42] show others
[1:20:44] how to handle problems
[1:20:49] how to function together
[1:20:52] how to be fitly joined together
[1:20:55] how to build together
[1:21:00] we don't even have to agree
[1:21:06] we just got to have the right The Same
[1:21:08] Spirit yeah
[1:21:10] yeah God will take care of the
[1:21:12] disagreements
[1:21:14] he'll see us through now this is the god
[1:21:17] that I believe in
[1:21:19] this is the god that we serve this is
[1:21:22] the god that is calling us to mature
[1:21:27] because we hide behind this I'm right
[1:21:29] and they're wrong like who cares who
[1:21:34] cares
[1:21:37] I don't care if you're right I don't
[1:21:39] care if I'm wrong
[1:21:40] but I do care that you help me
[1:21:44] I do care that you care enough to help
[1:21:46] me that you that you're willing to lay
[1:21:48] down your time
[1:21:50] your pride
[1:21:52] get some clothes of humility on
[1:21:55] and come and help me
[1:21:58] pray with me
[1:22:00] see me through
[1:22:05] really may not see I but we should see
[1:22:08] heart to heart as the prophet taught us
[1:22:12] my all right Hebrews now how is he going
[1:22:15] to do this
[1:22:16] Hebrews 8 verse 10. one verse
[1:22:23] for this is the Covenant that I will
[1:22:25] make with the house of Israel after
[1:22:27] those days saith the Lord I will put my
[1:22:31] laws into their minds and write them
[1:22:35] into their hearts
[1:22:37] and I will be to them a God and they
[1:22:40] shall be to me a people
[1:22:43] God doesn't do away with the law
[1:22:47] he doesn't want us to do away with the
[1:22:50] law
[1:22:51] in fact he'll put it so strong in us
[1:22:54] that we will literally go late on our
[1:22:56] life we will present our bodies a Living
[1:22:58] Sacrifice that we may prove what is that
[1:23:01] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[1:23:03] God
[1:23:04] amen that's the god that we serve
[1:23:07] John 14 verse 15 says if you love me
[1:23:10] keep my Commandments and I will pray
[1:23:12] that the father will he shall give you
[1:23:14] another comfort that he may abide with
[1:23:17] you forever even the spirit of Truth in
[1:23:19] the world it cannot receive
[1:23:21] it can't do this it can't love
[1:23:24] it can't love
[1:23:26] the way God loves
[1:23:28] amen it can't love
[1:23:30] undisputedly
[1:23:33] because it see of him not neither
[1:23:36] knoweth him but you know him
[1:23:39] for he dwelt with you and shall be in
[1:23:41] you now if we can just catch that
[1:23:44] catch that we all believe that Christ
[1:23:46] lives in us and we should
[1:23:51] but we should be believing
[1:23:54] that he should be able to manifest full
[1:23:57] love through us
[1:24:00] and that's what we need to be believing
[1:24:01] unto
[1:24:04] and you you can spend a lot of time in
[1:24:06] prayer but if you're never put in a
[1:24:08] situation to see where you're at you're
[1:24:10] not going to know what you really got
[1:24:11] [Music]
[1:24:11] [Applause]
[1:24:13] so Trials Come things come and they
[1:24:15] prove where you're at
[1:24:18] you think they prove where the other
[1:24:19] person's at
[1:24:21] but it proves really where you're at
[1:24:24] because God will use just about anything
[1:24:27] to offend you
[1:24:30] even Jesus called that woman a dog
[1:24:33] I mean there'd probably be some women in
[1:24:35] them this message church that would
[1:24:36] probably slap a man who said that to him
[1:24:41] God will allow things to happen
[1:24:45] God is looking for you to see where
[1:24:48] you're at
[1:24:50] how are you going to react
[1:24:52] Verse 18 he says I will not leave you
[1:24:55] comfortless I will come to you see how
[1:24:59] often we find ourselves in problems and
[1:25:01] it leaves us an uncomfortable feeling
[1:25:04] can you believe what just happened can
[1:25:06] you just can't you they said do the they
[1:25:08] they didn't shake my hand whatever it
[1:25:10] might be
[1:25:11] and you feel alone you feel like
[1:25:13] something's missing
[1:25:18] he said I will not leave you comfortless
[1:25:23] great peace have they that love my love
[1:25:26] and nothing shall offend them
[1:25:31] that you talk about Comfort that's
[1:25:33] comfort
[1:25:34] praise the Lord how many loves the word
[1:25:37] all right verse 19 yet a little while
[1:25:39] and the world seeth me no more but ye
[1:25:41] shall see me because I live ye shall
[1:25:43] live also and at that day you shall know
[1:25:45] that I'm in the father and ye and me and
[1:25:48] I in you and he that have my
[1:25:49] Commandments and keepeth them he it is
[1:25:51] that loveth me and shall be law and he
[1:25:53] that loveth me shall be loved of my
[1:25:55] father and I will love him and manifest
[1:25:57] myself to him you ever notice why some
[1:26:00] people they can't love but other people
[1:26:01] can
[1:26:03] both Christians both believers
[1:26:09] there it is right there
[1:26:11] Judah saith unto him not as scary Lord
[1:26:13] how was it that thou will manifest
[1:26:15] thyself to us and not to the world
[1:26:18] Jesus answered and said unto him if a
[1:26:21] man loves me he will keep my words yes
[1:26:26] and my father will love him
[1:26:30] and he will come unto him and make our
[1:26:33] Abode with him
[1:26:42] the love of God is shed abroad in our
[1:26:45] heart by the Holy Ghost
[1:26:47] the more you receive the Holy Ghost the
[1:26:50] more you'll better manifest the love
[1:26:53] the more of the knowledge of the word
[1:26:58] that you receive
[1:27:01] the knowledge of the word
[1:27:06] I'm talking about the tree of knowledge
[1:27:09] the less
[1:27:12] you will be enticed to manifest the word
[1:27:17] we should be more interested in
[1:27:19] receiving the Life of Christ than
[1:27:21] hearing something we've never heard
[1:27:23] before
[1:27:29] too often a part of the word is missing
[1:27:33] when I watch people which you can't help
[1:27:35] but all the time you watch things and
[1:27:37] you're you're looking to see Christ
[1:27:39] manifested
[1:27:42] and it just seems like people know but
[1:27:45] they're missing it in their their hearts
[1:27:47] they got in their heads but not their
[1:27:49] hearts
[1:27:50] Jesus said in John 13 34 a new
[1:27:53] commandment I give unto you that you
[1:27:54] love one another as I have loved you
[1:27:59] don't don't love one another as they
[1:28:02] love you
[1:28:04] that's that's not it
[1:28:07] that you love one another as I have
[1:28:09] loved you that means unconditional
[1:28:12] that ye also love one another and by
[1:28:15] this by this by this Undisputed Love by
[1:28:19] this unconditional without respect to
[1:28:21] persons no matter what happens I will
[1:28:24] restore by this shall all men know that
[1:28:28] you're my disciples if you have love one
[1:28:31] for another
[1:28:35] I'm not satisfied with what I have
[1:28:37] [Music]
[1:28:39] I know there's more for me because the
[1:28:41] Bible tells me there's more for me
[1:28:44] and so I want to spend the rest of my
[1:28:46] life pressing towards that
[1:28:49] because I know there's a pressure coming
[1:28:51] things are going to happen in our lives
[1:28:53] and
[1:28:54] the devil God we're going to be tried
[1:28:59] and we're going to be put to the spot
[1:29:00] where you are all alone and either
[1:29:02] Christ is going to come out or whatever
[1:29:05] else is on the inside
[1:29:07] [Music]
[1:29:10] John said and now I beseech thee lady
[1:29:13] not as though I wrote a new commandment
[1:29:16] unto thee but that which ye have had
[1:29:19] from the beginning we love that we love
[1:29:22] one another
[1:29:25] so Jesus said a new commandment and
[1:29:28] John's saying well it's really not a new
[1:29:30] commandment it's the one that we've had
[1:29:32] from the beginning
[1:29:34] now the end of the Commandment is
[1:29:36] charity
[1:29:38] the part that we don't think about
[1:29:41] I I understand that there's people that
[1:29:45] are are missing it and they're doing and
[1:29:47] they're saying but you know God is
[1:29:49] looking for you to rise up and fulfill
[1:29:50] you're part of the word
[1:29:57] there's so much
[1:29:59] turn with me to Matthew Chapter 5 so
[1:30:01] much that we're going to have to just
[1:30:04] miss you know I like it when I'm
[1:30:07] studying and you
[1:30:09] probably don't
[1:30:14] when I'm studying and I only got just
[1:30:17] a few scriptures I feel so good
[1:30:20] that's the time I really want to like
[1:30:22] start because the more time I have to
[1:30:25] study the more I study the more stuff I
[1:30:27] get and then and then it really makes it
[1:30:30] hard to fit it all in I always covet
[1:30:32] your prayers
[1:30:34] Matthew chapter five starting with verse
[1:30:36] 43 ye have heard that have been said
[1:30:39] that thou shalt love thy neighbor and
[1:30:41] hate thine enemy
[1:30:42] so here's the law you've heard the law
[1:30:44] on eye for an eye tooth for tooth
[1:30:46] but that's not the end of the law
[1:30:49] okay so Jesus goes on but I say unto you
[1:30:52] love your enemy
[1:30:54] bless then that curse you do good to
[1:30:56] them that hate you pray for them to
[1:30:58] despitefully use you and persecute you
[1:31:01] that you may be called
[1:31:04] that you may be the children of your
[1:31:07] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:31:09] the son to rise on the evil and the good
[1:31:11] and sinneth rain and the just and the
[1:31:13] unjust so God wants us to be just like
[1:31:17] him
[1:31:19] now you can't do this under until
[1:31:21] there's a problem
[1:31:22] you literally cannot manifest as part of
[1:31:25] the Commandment until there's a problem
[1:31:28] you can't just say well everything's
[1:31:29] going good I just love everybody that
[1:31:31] don't work
[1:31:33] you don't really know what a tea bag is
[1:31:35] until it gets in hot water and then when
[1:31:37] it gets in hot water you can really
[1:31:38] taste it
[1:31:43] all right for if you just love them that
[1:31:47] love you
[1:31:48] what reward have you
[1:31:52] do not even Republicans say so yeah you
[1:31:54] ever do this
[1:31:57] brother Mark's not here so I can pick on
[1:31:59] brother Mark
[1:32:02] you have a problem with somebody and so
[1:32:04] then you go over to this person over
[1:32:05] here and you talk to them about this
[1:32:07] problem
[1:32:09] and this this person said oh yeah I
[1:32:11] agree I understand yeah that's just a
[1:32:14] terrible thing
[1:32:19] if I just love him
[1:32:24] to not even Republicans the same
[1:32:28] but if I can ignore going to this person
[1:32:31] and just love this person just look for
[1:32:34] this opportunity
[1:32:36] to show Christ even though there's not
[1:32:39] an agreement even though there's not a
[1:32:41] uh a solution to them following me or
[1:32:45] agreeing with me but if I can still love
[1:32:48] them the same
[1:32:50] that puts me in a different category
[1:32:54] and that's what Christ is calling us to
[1:32:57] to be put in a different category a
[1:32:59] category that can love undisputedly
[1:33:03] are you with me if you love them they'll
[1:33:05] love you what reward it do not even the
[1:33:07] publicans the same and if you salute
[1:33:08] your brother and only what do you more
[1:33:10] than others do not even the public and
[1:33:12] so
[1:33:15] something separates the bride
[1:33:18] I believe it's perfect love I really do
[1:33:23] be therefore perfect even as your father
[1:33:25] which is in heaven is perfect
[1:33:28] Undisputed Love Too Many Believers are
[1:33:31] still stuck on the beginning of the
[1:33:33] Commandment love your neighbor and hate
[1:33:36] your enemy
[1:33:39] too many people are stuck there
[1:33:41] it's amazing to me how we act when
[1:33:43] there's a problem
[1:33:45] like we got a master's degree in this
[1:33:47] situation we know all about it we'll
[1:33:49] just talk like a professor
[1:33:52] about the problem
[1:33:53] and then say class dismissed
[1:33:57] just a form of godliness
[1:34:00] people are missing how to love
[1:34:03] how to bless how to do good
[1:34:06] Oh Brother John they don't need any more
[1:34:09] grace what they need is is they need
[1:34:11] correction they need judgment right now
[1:34:16] let me just say this to you I do know
[1:34:18] and I do understand that they need
[1:34:21] judgment
[1:34:22] I do understand that they need
[1:34:24] correction
[1:34:27] but they need it in love
[1:34:31] they need it in the love of God they
[1:34:33] don't need it with our agape love
[1:34:35] because all right
[1:34:37] I'm sorry our filial law they don't need
[1:34:40] it with our video love our feet of the
[1:34:41] Love Has starts and stops you know what
[1:34:43] they all go around our emotions and our
[1:34:46] feelings and what we think
[1:34:49] I believe in correction I believe in
[1:34:52] judgment I just believe in the way God
[1:34:53] did it
[1:34:55] he went and he died for my sins and he
[1:34:57] didn't force me to give my life to him
[1:34:59] he gave me the opportunity
[1:35:03] and he doesn't do anything to those that
[1:35:05] put that put their nose up to God that
[1:35:08] turned their back on the God he just
[1:35:10] lets him go live the life that they want
[1:35:12] to live they'll he'll deal with them on
[1:35:14] the day of judgment and why can't we
[1:35:16] learn that lesson
[1:35:20] God still is good to those people yes
[1:35:23] he's good to the unjust
[1:35:25] he's good to those that are evil
[1:35:28] why can't we
[1:35:30] why can't we manifest Christ you know
[1:35:32] they got a chance of seeing
[1:35:34] seeing Christ if you let Christ live
[1:35:36] through you
[1:35:40] Galatians chapter 6.
[1:35:43] chapter chapter six
[1:35:46] I know my time is
[1:35:50] is
[1:35:53] well you know what it is
[1:35:58] I just need you to if you would bear
[1:36:01] with me are you getting something out of
[1:36:03] this
[1:36:06] Galatians chapter 6 verse 1 Brethren if
[1:36:08] a man be overtaken in a fault
[1:36:11] you which are spiritual
[1:36:14] restore such a one in the spirit of
[1:36:16] meekness concerning themselves lest I
[1:36:18] also be tempted I say to you today
[1:36:22] where does this put you do you consider
[1:36:25] yourself spiritual
[1:36:29] do you consider yourself spiritual
[1:36:33] because a spiritual person will use a
[1:36:35] spirit of meekness there's a way to
[1:36:37] correct now the real true correction is
[1:36:41] not putting your hands on somebody's
[1:36:43] neck until they say all right I I'm
[1:36:45] sorry I'm sorry
[1:36:49] it's
[1:36:51] it's a restoration that's true
[1:36:53] correction a restoration
[1:36:56] it's like we're trying to bring
[1:36:57] restoration to our sanctuary
[1:36:59] we're trying to bring order
[1:37:02] trying to restore it though in a way of
[1:37:04] reverence
[1:37:06] it it it's no different
[1:37:09] so what does it take to help someone
[1:37:11] with a fault well it takes somebody
[1:37:13] spiritual
[1:37:15] not religious but spiritual
[1:37:18] someone with a mindset of restoring
[1:37:22] not proving the other person is wrong
[1:37:24] not proving that we're right
[1:37:27] but proving that the end of the
[1:37:29] Commandment is Charity out of a pure
[1:37:31] heart
[1:37:33] someone who wears the garments of
[1:37:35] humility who packs a spirit of meekness
[1:37:39] that's what it takes to restore and I
[1:37:42] just you know I sit back and I say why
[1:37:44] do some people just kind of like you
[1:37:46] know
[1:37:48] it's like uh
[1:37:50] was it the Pharisee when they saw the
[1:37:52] the the man who had been overtaken by
[1:37:55] the robbers and he kind of passed on the
[1:37:58] other side
[1:38:01] I just wonder sometimes we we see
[1:38:03] problems and we just kind of want to
[1:38:04] pass on the other side
[1:38:10] I call to you I may I think God's going
[1:38:13] to bring us up on the on the stand
[1:38:16] and he's going to question us are you
[1:38:18] spiritual
[1:38:20] are you spiritual
[1:38:23] should you not be helping
[1:38:26] well I I don't feel that I don't feel
[1:38:28] led to but you feel led to talk
[1:38:32] you feel led
[1:38:34] to do what you're doing
[1:38:43] all right verse Two Bear ye one
[1:38:45] another's burden
[1:38:46] and so fulfill the law of Christ I
[1:38:48] believe that's the will of God right
[1:38:50] there
[1:38:51] to Bear one another's burden now does
[1:38:53] that mean God's got to come to you in a
[1:38:55] dream
[1:38:56] or a prophecy
[1:38:58] or speaking in tongues
[1:39:01] or that the pastor's got a call and put
[1:39:03] this burden on you tell you all about it
[1:39:06] no
[1:39:08] you got scripture right there
[1:39:10] it's a choice bear one another's burdens
[1:39:12] and so fulfill the law of Christ
[1:39:15] amen God didn't do away with the law but
[1:39:17] he's called us to fulfill the law with
[1:39:20] Undisputed love
[1:39:22] that's helping our brother and our
[1:39:25] sister who has fallen to fulfill the law
[1:39:28] that God has placed inside of us
[1:39:33] now if you think that you don't have to
[1:39:36] do it I'm going to just say this to you
[1:39:38] that God has given you some special
[1:39:40] Liberty I say you're deceived
[1:39:43] you're absolutely deceived
[1:39:46] verse 3 tells us for if a man think
[1:39:49] himself to be something
[1:39:52] when he's nothing he deceiveth himself
[1:39:55] now this we're keeping the whole same
[1:39:57] theme Here
[1:39:59] you know we think we're we're something
[1:40:01] that we don't have to go do that we
[1:40:02] don't have to we don't have to carry one
[1:40:04] another's burden
[1:40:06] he says but let every man prove his own
[1:40:10] work and then shall he have rejoicing in
[1:40:12] himself alone and not another
[1:40:18] he ever you ever see somebody go fix the
[1:40:22] problem and then another person says
[1:40:24] yeah I told you I was right
[1:40:26] you know what I'm talking about
[1:40:31] for every man shall bear his own burden
[1:40:35] let him that is taught in the word
[1:40:39] communicate unto him that teacheth in
[1:40:43] all good things
[1:40:46] in other words talk with meekness
[1:40:49] let your conversation always be with
[1:40:51] Grace coupled with fear go meet the
[1:40:54] problem
[1:40:55] be not deceived God is Not mocked for
[1:40:58] whatsoever man soweth that shall he also
[1:41:00] reap so how you treat others is the way
[1:41:04] that God
[1:41:08] how you treat others
[1:41:10] may be how we're going to be treated
[1:41:14] maybe not by the same people
[1:41:22] but we we got to start sowing seeds of
[1:41:24] kindness throw them out there sow them
[1:41:26] sow them so look for an opportunity to
[1:41:29] solve them
[1:41:31] I'm just going to read James a scripture
[1:41:34] here in James 4. speak not evil one of
[1:41:37] another Brethren but speak uh he that
[1:41:40] speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth
[1:41:41] his brother speaking evil the law and
[1:41:43] judge of the law but if thou judge the
[1:41:46] law Thou Art not a doer of the law but a
[1:41:49] judge see you can't do both
[1:41:51] you cannot do both
[1:41:53] you take you take sides
[1:41:55] as soon as you
[1:41:57] well
[1:42:00] so God's watching verse 8 for he that
[1:42:03] soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh
[1:42:06] reap corruption but he that soweth to
[1:42:07] the spirit shall of the spirit reap
[1:42:09] everlasting life Everlasting so the
[1:42:12] scriptures are maintaining the same
[1:42:14] thing have restoring others so verse 9
[1:42:17] let us not be weary in well-doing for in
[1:42:20] due season we shall reap if we faint not
[1:42:24] and I know it's hard to lay down your
[1:42:25] life to help somebody
[1:42:27] it can become weary
[1:42:31] that's why we have the scripture right
[1:42:32] here we have this scripture for those
[1:42:34] situations
[1:42:35] be not weary in well-doing as we have
[1:42:40] therefore opportunity let us do good
[1:42:43] unto all men especially
[1:42:47] especially unto them who are of the
[1:42:51] household of faith
[1:42:55] I'll say to you don't avoid
[1:42:59] helping
[1:43:00] just because you're scared
[1:43:06] get the love of God in your heart amen
[1:43:08] that you're not afraid
[1:43:11] I want to read a quote from the message
[1:43:14] he cares do you care
[1:43:16] brother Brandon says the people they lie
[1:43:18] they cheat they steal
[1:43:20] to you almost have to have a bond of
[1:43:23] security to borrow five dollars from
[1:43:26] somebody
[1:43:27] you know the Bible speaks to that that
[1:43:29] there'd be no love in the last days but
[1:43:32] just amongst the elect people that's
[1:43:35] right
[1:43:38] that's right the scripture speaks to
[1:43:40] that that the husband would be against
[1:43:42] the wife and the wife the against the
[1:43:44] husband children against the parents
[1:43:46] just among the elect of the Lord there
[1:43:49] will be there will be love left any love
[1:43:52] left
[1:43:57] it's it's literally Harder To Love
[1:44:01] it's harder to love
[1:44:03] it's easy to love if you get what you
[1:44:05] want but it's harder to love if you're
[1:44:07] not getting what you want
[1:44:10] but the bride subjects herself to the
[1:44:13] word
[1:44:14] subjects herself to the Commandment to
[1:44:17] the end of the Commandment which is
[1:44:18] Charity not just out of a oh I got you I
[1:44:21] guess
[1:44:22] but out of a pure heart
[1:44:24] a heart that just wants to see that
[1:44:27] person helped that's your only motive I
[1:44:31] want to see that person restored that
[1:44:33] person helped let's Stand Together
[1:44:39] oh my we just I I want you to know
[1:44:42] I'm I'm
[1:44:45] Galatians 5 14 so for all the law is
[1:44:48] fulfilled in one word even this
[1:44:51] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:44:54] but if you bite and devour one another
[1:44:56] take heed you be not consumed one of
[1:44:59] another
[1:45:00] now we have a choice when there's a
[1:45:02] problem we can get upset we can get
[1:45:04] angry we can bite we can devour we can
[1:45:07] consume one another
[1:45:08] or we can make the choice of loving
[1:45:13] we'll always have that choice
[1:45:16] and to whom you yield yourself servant
[1:45:18] survey his servant you'll be
[1:45:21] I'm so glad that God has called us as
[1:45:25] the elective God to manifest perfect
[1:45:28] love
[1:45:31] and the greater the problem is the
[1:45:33] greater chance we have
[1:45:35] to show that love
[1:45:37] how may desire that
[1:45:39] let me desire that how many how many
[1:45:41] feel like I brother John I I feel that
[1:45:44] has been lacking in me and I I want to
[1:45:47] see that like I've never seen it before
[1:45:50] I see this desire right here this is
[1:45:53] what the bride is hungering for right
[1:45:56] here
[1:45:58] because more problems are coming and we
[1:46:00] don't like problems
[1:46:02] I understand that
[1:46:05] but we can't do nothing about the
[1:46:07] problems coming
[1:46:08] but but
[1:46:10] what we can do is represent Christ in
[1:46:13] the problem
[1:46:14] represent a perfect love
[1:46:17] God's got to work the thing out
[1:46:20] but he's calling us to perfect love
[1:46:22] let's just bow our hearts in a word of
[1:46:24] prayer Heavenly Father you saw our hands
[1:46:27] lifted in response to your word today
[1:46:33] Lord I'm thankful
[1:46:36] that I'm amongst a group of believers
[1:46:40] that recognize the importance of
[1:46:43] manifesting perfect love
[1:46:46] Lord and I pray for them with all my
[1:46:48] heart this morning
[1:46:51] Lord that as they have desired
[1:46:54] and as they desire and as they will
[1:46:57] continue to desire
[1:47:01] to be filled
[1:47:04] with
[1:47:05] Your Love
[1:47:10] I pray that you would also give them
[1:47:12] that faith to believe that no matter
[1:47:15] what problem
[1:47:18] that they will encounter moving forward
[1:47:25] that you inside of them
[1:47:28] will never fear
[1:47:31] but that perfect love will cast out all
[1:47:34] fear
[1:47:36] that greater is you inside of them
[1:47:41] and that Spirit that's in the world
[1:47:44] God
[1:47:46] may you fortify us
[1:47:49] may you strengthen us may you
[1:47:51] you encourage us Lord and as we take a
[1:47:55] step forward you told Joshua
[1:47:58] wherever The Souls of your feet shall
[1:48:00] tread upon that land shall be yours Lord
[1:48:03] by faith
[1:48:05] Lord our hands have gone up and our
[1:48:07] spiritual feet are walking forward we're
[1:48:09] taking possession of this word today
[1:48:15] Lord and we thank you forgiveness of
[1:48:18] this grace
[1:48:19] for you would never ever ask us to do
[1:48:21] anything that we could not do
[1:48:26] Lord I know what you're asking us to do
[1:48:29] only you can do
[1:48:31] and we believe Lord you inside of us
[1:48:34] will do it
[1:48:36] oh God teach us day by day to lay down
[1:48:39] our life to lay down our will to lay
[1:48:41] down our thoughts are
[1:48:43] and just to take your word
[1:48:47] and believe it for the smallest things
[1:48:49] that happen in our home the smallest
[1:48:51] things that might happen in our mind in
[1:48:53] our church and
[1:48:56] Lord that we could see you in
[1:48:59] in manifestation this Undisputed love
[1:49:03] that no matter what
