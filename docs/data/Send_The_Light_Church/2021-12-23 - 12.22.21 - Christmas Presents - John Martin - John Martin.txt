wonderful he is amen the more wonderful you realize he is well god bless you turn with me if you would today in the book of luke chapter 2. i want to welcome each and every one to our christmas service god bless those that are live streaming couldn't be here i want to welcome our visitors god bless our visitors praise the lord may you feel his presence tonight is our prayer man we had a wonderful time in our men's meeting certainly appreciate what god's doing in brother rogers life um he's i believe he he feels there's there's time that he needs to make up and for the lord working for the lord and to feel that urgency i i believe we've only got so much time on earth we know we don't even have a promise of tomorrow and whatever time we have we just want to give it all to the lord amen amen let's just ask god's blessings on the word before we begin reading heavenly father lord as we approach you today lord we're we're just human beings with faults and failures and in sins and we just ask that your blood would come and cleanse us and wash us and cover us and lord that you would take these vessels lord and uh lord prepare them for the word that's coming forth now lord you we're not worthy to look upon this word we're not worthy to read it it's so pure and holy and righteous but lord we ask that you would uh cleanse us with your blood wash us and and give us eyes to see the real meaning lord of the word of god tonight give us revelation of your word and let us leave here closer drawn to you lord we pray father for the precious uh brothers and sisters that are going to be baptized today lord jesus we just pray a special blessing upon each of them lord as they take this giant step forward lord may you come and just bless them mightily for giving their lives over to you lord as you promised you would lord we thank you for these things now we commit ourselves your hands for the furtherance of this service now in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen well in luke chapter 2 here we see that we're going to start with verse 7 but actually it was the government that brought about prophecy god used the government to bring about prophecy to get joseph and and mary uh back where they needed to be there in bethlehem and verse 7 says and she brought forth her first born son wrapped him in swallowing clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end and there was in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the lord came upon them in the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes laying in a manger and suddenly there is an angel and there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly holes praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men what a wonderful blessing god gave us and then in james chapter 1 verse 17 james chapter 1 verse 17. just read one verse there and have you be seated every good and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning amen god bless you you may be seated we want to entitle this message christmas presents every year we have a different sermon at christmas and um i want to talk about christmas presents brother branham did say don't keep those little those presents from the little kids he wanted them to be able to enjoy the gifts of opening the presents but how many times have we been reminded that jesus is the reason for the season there have been so many things that have substituted the real purpose of the christmas celebration christmas has become a huge ceremony of commercial enterprise the whole world has taken advantage of this situation trying to get the whole world to try to make money off the world and and and people literally when they buy their goods they're running up debt on their credit cards and many of them are giving without christ being behind it i'm not pointing fingers at anybody here but we've got people who are totally against the word of god yet they give christmas presents and how easy it is to give at christmas time with christ not being behind it people not giving with the right motives when you are getting a gift for somebody do you ever think about getting the perfect gift for them what's the perfect gift for them a lot of times it's hard to find a perfect gift but i don't believe there's any greater gift that god could have gave us than jesus christ he was the perfect sinless lamb of god given our substitute for our substitute so we wouldn't die the bible says in saint john chapter 3 verse 16 god's motive for giving was pure wasn't to show off he had a love for the soul of man that was lost it was pure giving saint john 3 16 says for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved so we see the motive and the purpose he that believeth on him is not condemned isn't that beautiful if you just believe truly believe as the scripture said you're not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because you have not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god there is no other way to be saved outside of jesus christ and this is the condemnation look at this and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their day their deeds were evil so when i think about all when i was first introduced to jesus the bible the word there were things that were said to me that i felt uncomfortable with i'll just be honest with you i wanted to go on and live my own sinful life and still be saved and go to heaven and the reason that it was like because i loved the darkness that i was in i loved doing the things that i was doing i'm so glad that god loved me when i was yet in my sins and he was patient he knew that one day i would give my heart to him amen a lot of times when we're witnessing we've got to learn to be patient when man fell in the garden of eden god did not hesitate to express his eternal love for his son he had made in his own image in genesis chapter 3 verse 15 the first prophecy of calvary and i will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise my head and thou shall bruise his heel notice god didn't hold any grudges he didn't say well i'm just going to throw this out of the way i'm gonna go make another man he had a law that he was gonna see this through through the ages god has never forgotten man or his purpose for man to be in his image god didn't just want me saved he didn't say oh john martin's saved you just continued to smoke you can continue to drink you continue that worldly music you continue with that long hair and and that disgusting vulgar language you're saved anyways that is not what god was interested in god was interested in seeing his image inside this body and he never forgot it isaiah chapter 7 verse 14 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel chapter 9 verse 6 for unto us a child is born unto us a son has been given and that government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful counselor jesus no the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace there's a revelation right there verse 7 says of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon the his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever and the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this god had a vision for you and me he was going to see it through isaiah 53 verse 1 who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as the root out of a dry ground he have no form now look at this they're describing the sun he have no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him it was a christmas present that was not beautiful there was not even a desire for this because she ever opened a gift and said man i don't even want this and they just save the money or give me the money and i'll buy what i want look at this gift he was despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with greece and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for you and i for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one of us in our own way and the lord laid upon him the iniquity of us all we're all in the same boat here amen he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as sheep before the shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth you talk about the very nature of christ go through go through some trials and see what happens it lets you know real quick how much more of god's nature that you need he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people he was stritten stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him and he just wasn't much to look at from the outside was he and have put him to grief when thou shall make his soul an offering for our sin his soul became an offering amen the only thing that could save us a sinless soul he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand there just wasn't much of a christmas present that really was exciting about jesus let's continue to read saint john chapter 1 verse 10 says he was in the world the world was made by him and the world what knew him not you could actually be in god's presence and not even know it you could be sitting next to a seed of god and not even know it verse 11 he came unto his own and his own received him not can you imagine going back home to your family and your family won't receive you he came to his own he created man and he came to man to save man and his man did not receive a man did not receive him a lot of this verse 12. but as many as received him talking about this christmas gift now to them gave he power to become the sons of god now i understand this seed might have been already in there but i need power i need power and that power comes after you receive christ inside your heart power to become in his image power to drop the things of the world power to start living for god that kind of power not a show-off power not a show of power but a power that lives for god amen even to them that believe on his name which were born not a blood nor of the will of flesh nor of the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth notice what came first grace i'll say it like this when you're trying to help somebody give them grace before the truth but there was a beautiful gift inside of jesus the veil the outside was just a veil flesh when you looked at it it wasn't very handsome jesus wasn't very handsome he wasn't one of those hey he is a handsome man he's a rock hudson he's a arnold schwarzenegger he wasn't fit he wasn't built he didn't look young and no he looked aged he was a man in the 30s and he looked about 50. so from the outward appearance there was nothing that we would desire the outside of the gift didn't look too hot his personality wasn't much of a people pleasers when it came to just saying what's right and what's wrong he wasn't an entertainer he wasn't a celebrity in fact he was evil spoken of he was called a devil a beelzebub a fortune tower a friend of publicans and prostitutes on the outside there wasn't any bowls or pretty wrapping paper there was no lights or or or glittering tinsel there's no beauty that we should desire him but inside was a soul that loved man and wanted to see him back in the father's image jesus was willing to give himself for mankind in saint john chapter 10 verse 15. the majority of the people did not receive him but a few did receive him as the father verse 15 as the father knoweth me even so i i know the father and i lay down my life for us he laid down his life for the sheep and other sheep i have now this is really we're in verse 16. verse verse 15 with the israels and 16 is the gentiles and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring in and they shall hear my voice and they shall be one fold and one shepherd we're all one in christ doesn't matter our nationality doesn't matter anything we're one in christ it's the same blood of christ the same nature of god living inside of all of us it's what makes us one therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life but i may take it up again you want the father to love you lay down your life for others no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down i have power to take it again and this commandment i have received of my father notice it was a commandment it's the will of god amen jesus hung on the cross for the whole world she for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son for us that should should be just as exciting every time we hear it every time we have the thought every time we hear a song that talks about jesus gave himself for you and i something inside should be just constantly stirring constantly giving praise god never wants you to forget what he did for you at calvary it'll be there in heaven to remind you there'll be scars on his hands this gift of christ has to be opened up in one sense it was opened up when his hands were were nailed and the spear went in the side the blood came out that's true statement but in another sense it didn't save the world a belief has to come from every single individual about their blood if you leave it wrapped up it'll do you no good there's only one place you can open this gift and it's in your heart man will never know the gift of god that he gave until he opens his heart to god amen it's that believing that's where belief comes from the heart now we've heard the saying someone's someone's word being as good as gold did you ever hear that before of course you don't hear it too much now because everybody's worth kind of gone down the tubes but we've heard of it god's word is gold not good as gold it is gold it's gold tried in the fire you can count on it it's forever settled in heaven it cannot fail cannot lie and inside his word there are many presents for us they're called promises there are gifts to us that he wants us to open up we can't leave them wrapped amen they've got to be unwrapped second peter chapter 1 verse 4 says hereby whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by thee she might be partakers of the divine nature now notice what the promises are for god's interest is not just that we would be healed but that his divine nature would be inside of us so he could step back you know what he did to job have you considered my servant job there's none like him he likes bragging about his children having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust the only way to escape this world is to possess the divine nature of god it's the only way otherwise we're going to get sucked right back into it the world is going down the tubes i mean the bible says that god's going to shake heaven and earth not just earth but heavens being shaken there's only one thing that's going to stand in its god it's god so the only way to stand in that hour is to get more of god on the inside amen and these exceeding great and precious promises in god's word are not just for our flesh they are for our divine nature if i'll say it like this we are supposed to be just like jesus when he returns we're going to be just like him now i'm sure jesus don't want to be like me because there's nothing too pretty about me i already know what my nature was before i met god and a man at his very best is all vanity i don't care how much he tries to better himself he needs god on the inside doing the work now the wrapping of god's gifts may not look appealing oh what's really important is what's on the inside i want to take a look at a few of gifts if i can do that i want to look at the gift of peace when you look at this gift a piece on the outside it doesn't look pretty to get to it it doesn't look appealing you have to keep your mind away from negative thoughts that's not appealing i like to just think whatever i want to think whatsoever things are true and honest and just and pure and lovely and of a good report man i'll tell you that is that's not easy to do does it does anybody have an easy time doing that so the rapping isn't appealing did you know you have to pray to get peace scriptural you have to make supplications with thanksgiving i'll tell you when you don't feel like praying you must forget about getting peace but when we open the gift of peace after we have disciplined ourselves to keep our thoughts on jesus peace is there you can't allow your mind to just wander off and and and and think about all sorts of problems and the issues that's happening in the world and just say i think this is wrong i wish this wasn't here and expect to have the peace of god it's wrapped up thou shalt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee [Applause] once you reach that place you know we're we're used to having the peace when everything seems to be okay that check came in wow but we miss everything's okay there that's the way that's a temporal piece it's the piece of the world but the peace from jesus it passeth all understanding when things aren't working out that's what keeps you worldly peace don't keep you and we shouldn't say that we got the peace of god when it's not what we should do is say god let this peace remain if it's you what's wrong with doing that you're not you're not belittling your faith but you know many times the devil's used us and testifying something's of god and it's not so many times let's take a look at this gift of joy you take time to open up the gift of peace when you open up the gift of peace it'll be divine just like all of god's gifts are divine there is a mimic from the world these same things joy happiness whatever it might be but there is a difference the gift of joy did you know the bible says that the joy of the lord is your strength [Music] but you don't get much strength from cedar point or just getting together with somebody and laughing it up it only lasts for a little bit so we don't want to get the joy of the world mixed up with the joy of the lord or even our own joy with god's joy our joy rejoices when we get what we want the joy of the lord is when god gets what he wants god rejoices when we do his will let's look to jesus the bible says for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross it was joy you would think if you had something hard to do in life that you would be looking for some other way to get it accomplished then yeah i wanted i want joy but really when it comes to the acid test of you having to do the will of god and bear the reproach no matter what anybody says if your whole family leaves you you're going to take the word of god what you need is the joy of the lord the joy of the lord is your strength and it's to do his will that's that's why jesus had that joy it was to to to bear that cross and and to take to to die on the cross for you and i he saw you and i so there's something good gonna let's just say for for a moment that you come from a family that you're the only one in your family that believes and you're afraid to just obey the whole word because because you're going to get excommunicated from your family members you need to have a vision that if you don't do it they aren't going to get saved because that's what jesus had he had a vision for you and i he knew the whole world wasn't going to say i surrendered to god but he saw you amen and if you were the only one he would have died for you that's how real it is we got to be willing to take a stand for god joy comes from being in the presence of god when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord the bible says they that wade upon the lord shall renew their joy renew their strength just by waiting on the lord so the outside of the present doesn't look real good man i ain't got time to wait i got to go i got things i got to do i can't sit here and be real still and wait for god i ain't this is not appealing the wrapping paper doesn't look real good there's no beauty that we should behold any of these gifts but on the inside is life on the inside you have to believe that god is going to meet you how many has ever experienced the joy of the lord let me see your hands it's there when everything else goes down the tubes now we've all experienced it but somehow it doesn't always stay and the bible says if we don't keep keep doing his commandments that he's going to take his joy away from us that's scriptural you've got time to read it in saint john chapter 15. so that means we have to get back into his presence get still wait on him and when he comes he's going to say what about this what about that and you say yes lord i'm sorry i repent and god will reward us with the joy of the lord the bible says in his presence is the fullness of joy so to come to church and expect to get joy when you're not when your heart is not entering in i don't want to be in a church where it's just hopping and jumping and dancing and everything's on the outside but nothing's on the inside that's just not appealing to me you know brother branham says that's the problem that happened with the pentecostals they let all that excitement out the the chimney they didn't keep anything on the inside to help them live right so we always want to create the right atmosphere around us that's what you do when you go pray you're entering in his gates with thanksgiving you're creating that atmosphere that he's awesome you're grateful you're humbling yourself before the lord and when you get up you want to act the same way how many times this has happened how many times you've been in god's presence been very sweet presence been humble you get out of his presence and all of a sudden you're mean that is not what god wants us to do god wants us to get up take that presence with us [Music] and it'd be an outward expression of god whoever we're with now we don't want a worldly excitement we just want a genuine thankfulness and a gratitude not a happiness because we got something but a joy a joy because he's now on the inside of us a lot of people starve themselves of the joy of the lord they'll go such a long time without the joy and i'll tell you why it's because they're too lazy to spend time with god in prayer too lazy to create a right atmosphere well i'll just go to church and hopefully they'll do it for me you know god may allow that for a season but after a while he's called you to be mature the presence of joy is right here among us we gotta open up the package we gotta let it in our hearts he's not going to force himself in oftentimes we leave god's gifts unwrapped we never open them up just kind of leave them we heard the word but we don't do nothing with it you know there's a lot of people that come up short of unwrapping the gift after it's been given to him hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 says let us therefore fear last a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of unwrapping the gift for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith other words you've got to believe her enough to open it up if god says we're more than able to take take the land well let's believe it let's open that thing up and let's go don't wait for somebody sitting next to you to go because god may only be calling one person [Music] i don't know i'm not god but i don't want to sit in a church thinking just because we're sitting here we're going that ain't right either it's an individual affair and i say your faith god is calling your faith to believe all the word [Music] the bible says when jesus ascended on high that he gave gifts unto men god's given us the gift of a fivefold ministry for our perfecting that's what that gives us for and in second peter chapter 1 verse 11 says that the ministry that they this ministry is abundant and it's given to us so we can know the true entrance of where god's nature is at not about having a good time i mean i don't know how many times we've had i've been to so many services just their hallelujah services within a week i don't see any hallelujahs [Music] there's a difference between the word or the excitement falling on your flesh and then falling on your soul james said every good and every good gift and every perfect gift is from above isn't that beautiful and cometh down from the father of lights with whom there's no variableness no shadow of turning. god is the same yesterday today and forever the bible encourages us to unwrap god's gifts first corinthians chapter 12 verse 31 says but covet earnestly the best gifts covet earnestly the best gifts desire the best gifts from god there are so many spiritual christmas presents for all of us amen the bible says that there's diversities of gifts it's all from the holy ghost you think about these gifts there's gifts of healing gifts of faith miracles gifts of prophecy gifts of tongues and interpretation of tongues he gave out the gifts of knowledge amen discernment of spirits gifts of wisdom you know the bible you want wisdom he said he'd give it to anybody he gives liberally all you got to do is ask and ask in faith you can't waver about the subject you can't wonder if it's going to happen but they're gifts of faith you have to believe that's the foundation there are gifts of helps the bible says gifts of governments yeah you wouldn't think so when we look at our our government but what i'm referring to is that there's got to be some sort of order in a church and there are people that are gifted in that department there's gifts of interceding supplication prayer warriors i mean these are gifts god has given his gifts to help and edify the body god is not short god wants us to covet earnestly the best of gifts he says and yet show i unto you a more excellent way if i could just for a moment i want to talk about that more excellent way because the bible says we could have the gift of faith to remove all mountains it would still come short of what we need to get out of here [Music] we could have the gift of speaking in the tongues of men and of angels and to god it would just be a tinkling symbol a son just wouldn't mean a thing you could have all knowledge the bible says you can have all knowledge you could even understand all the mysteries in the bible and still would not do us any good but i want to talk about a more excellent way it's a gift but it's more than a gift it's jesus it's the way it's the truth it's the life we might say it's the complete package the gift of love it's the most important gift and yet it's more than a gift the bible says for god is love the gift of love is in our church oh that was there should have been a lot more amens with that one i say we feel it we sense it we experience the effects of it but we need to open it up and we need to walk out of church with it we need to possess it we we all experience this gift but it's not very easy to experience it brother marty was talking in our men's meaning that it's hard to really love your enemies in other words it's difficult to open the gift when you're being hurt by somebody people are mean to us but you know what god didn't have a hard time if we're having a hard time all we need is more love just more more look if i had to push this this way and i couldn't do it i just need some more help some more pushing and i would get this thing to move if my love isn't getting the job done i just need more love i'm not saying i don't have any love of god i'm just saying i need more i got to get to a place where i could do it we've all experienced this gift is not easy to open it reminds me a little bit when emma emma was over our house and she was opening up some of her christmas gifts and she was having a hard time because they were taped pretty good and she tried to open up the gifts and get it out every time she turned towards daddy just need some help daddy and she shaking that thing and trying to get it out but once she got it out i'm telling you there was a big smile the eyes were big she was happy because she got to the gift and i'm telling you you keep pressing in prayer you keep pressing because when you open that gift you'll better love your enemies you'll be able to pray for those that despitefully use you brother branham said like this whatever you do lay everything else aside until you get perfect love get to the place where you can love everyone even your enemies the gift of love is more real to me than any sermon any quote any doctrine anything that anybody can say or do everything that we're doing should be leading us to exercise the love of god exercise it exercise it you know i'm realizing that i need to get in shape because i'm finding myself puffing more just taking the garbage things down to the end of the driveway welcome to the club some things i i've haven't experienced so much out of shape i need to exercise so i'm more in shape we need to exercise the gift of god's love don't think you're going to get filled with god's love after coming to church for so long people sit in church for years and never exercise it they're too proud to to think they're too uh spiritual too much knowledge gonna tell every but you know what you gotta humble yourself when you open this gift you're going to be able to suffer long you're automatically going to be kind you won't seek your own ideas you won't be puffing yourself up or or being boastful your behavior won't be unbecoming when you get this gift you'll act the right way you won't be so easily offended either you won't be thinking ill of others or evil in any way because you you're into the gift when you open this gift of love you'll be washing one another's dirty feet you'll be living for others you'll bear all things you'll believe all things you'll hope all things and you'll endure all things because that's what love does god's love does that and i'll say it like this we should get serious no matter where we're at with god to lay everything else aside in our life and really start spending more time getting that it shouldn't be just a quote it needs to become manifested in our lives i've often said i don't care what somebody knows good or bad profound or the news of the world i really don't care all i want to know is how much you want to help are you willing to take time and help because that's what love does it helps otherwise we're just some sort of cnn abc just saying what we want to say and we know all those stations that we listen to they're only saying what they want to say a lot of times when we talk to others we just say the part we want to say we say what what god did for us not how we failed him not how we we we we got lazy uncaring didn't apologize all's it is just the news matthew chapter 5 verse 44 but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them that pray for them that despitefully they can't not just use you a little bit but they're just spiteful about it in other words they put their nose up in the air they know what they did to you and they'll even persecute you now you're supposed to love bless and pray now to try to do that in your flesh it'll be miserable when you're doing it for starters you can't have faith doing it you've got to have faith love worketh faith worketh we read that love worketh faith worketh by love thank you faith worketh allah we need the love of god to believe this scripture is for me i don't know who it's for i don't know i i would it be for the whole world but in reality i don't know who's going to believe it but i want to believe it for me and you know what god if you if you really want that you know what god's going to do for you he's going to put somebody in your life shortly and step on your toes it won't be real hard it'll be just a little bit just to see which way you're going to go and if you get to a place where you're doing real well well look what he did this job and he stood the test he stood the test even when his best friends came to him and accused him he still loved them that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven free make it the son to rise on the evil and on the good and send us reign on the just and the unjust how many today remember the last time you gave to the unjust that you smiled and gave your heart to to the evil or do you still hold the attitude of i just stay away from them i ain't shining on them i'm just avoiding so what spirit is that what spirit is that well i have a reason i understand you have a reason doesn't make it right let's just do what the bible says let's keep it simple for if you love them which love you where's your reward do not even the publicans the same did you know the bible says it's unwise to compare yourself with others why is that why is jesus comparing us with others right now because it's our proud selfish nature only wants to compare ourselves with somebody that's less than us jesus was letting us know that if we're if we're going to just pick and choose we're just like anybody else jesus wanted us to compare ourselves with this father who loves everybody it's really okay to compare yourself with somebody that's walking higher than you closer to god someone who's giving more of their life and really that's what you should be looking at not looking at what they're saying you know so many people get caught up in how somebody acts what they're saying you need to look at the fruit of their life for if you love them that love which love you what reward have you do not even republicans the same and if you salute your brother and only god bless you today my brother what do you more than others do not even republican soul but be ye perfect but be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect this to me is the perfect gift to give anybody the real love of god you can't hand that package that up and say jesus loves you the wonderful thing is for a christian he can give this gift out 365 days a year there'll be a lot of opportunity to pull this gift out love them without hypocrisy be genuinely in love labor to get to that place it's not easy to open this package but once you open it it is beautiful on the inside the most important gift that god could ever give a man is eternal life which is the gift of himself which is the gift of divine love and the only assurance that man has eternal life is to receive eternal life now remember this statement the only assurance that a man has eternal life is to receive eternal life into his heart and soul i don't care put your name on the book i don't care uh burn candles i don't care about uh uh quoting some apostles creator any scripture in the bible i don't care about speaking in tongues i don't care long you've come to church i what you have to do is receive eternal life in your heart and soul and that is the only assurance a man has i'm all for believing because the bible says he that believeth and baptized shall be saved i'm all for believing but without believing without believing there is no salvation but believing without possessing there's no assurance you're short believing without receiving god's gift is short of you possessing eternal life now i know this is strong but your mouth will hear the truth you know the bible says that there will be many that come to god in the last day thinking that they were saved when they weren't it wasn't because necessarily the intentions of the preachers was to see people but jesus said the blind lead the blind they both fall in the ditch you've got to hear the truth and that truth is what sets us free brother branham said like this when you get baptized that's you saying i've accepted christ into my life and when you receive the holy ghost that's christ saying to you i've accepted you that's strong but i'm just getting to the to the truth god told moses in exodus chapter 12 verse 13 and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the house upon the houses where your where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not come upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt now everybody knows this story everybody knows the story of the ten the the plagues and the last plague was death and death was going to destroy all of whoever the firstborn of all that was in egypt whether you went to church or didn't go to church whether you were under moses or not under moses there was a requirement that god had and that requirement was i want to see the blood upon the door uh the top linen and the doorpost of every house or the deaf angels coming inside and killing the the firstborn son now the token in that hour was the literal blood of a spotless lamb upon the houses they lived in today the token in this hour is the literal life that was in god's blood upon in your heart that's how serious it is oh my when that opened up christ present on the cross and blood poured out that was god's gift to mankind but yet it has to be received individually just saying i'm sorry just being baptized is not enough brother branham says uh if you're not right and you go into that water a sinner dry you'll come up a wet one as the tree the way the tree falls that's the way it lies we're water doesn't change us hallelujah water doesn't change us every we're baptized by the spirit of the living god inside our hearts by one spirit we're all baptized into the body but we're taught that that life that was in the blood could not come back upon the heart of man but the life of jesus christ can come back in our heart and what does it do it changes us into the very image that there was at the beginning that's what it does it doesn't just save us it changes us and that change is the evident token that the blood has really been applied brother brandon said in the message the tolkien he says but in this glorious place under the this covenant there's a difference between the blood and the life the token for the believer today is the holy spirit not a blood a chemistry but it is the holy spirit of god that is the token that god requires of the church today god must see the token he must see it in every one of us now we're living in the shadows and the wrath is ready to strike and god is requiring a token that you yourself have received this token the holy ghost now we know armageddon's setting in the world is going down and it's not going to raise up and we're going to be great for 50 more years death is going to strike this whole world and the only thing that's going to save us is the life of jesus christ that's between us and god it's the only way and i'm so sorry but if there are some that believing that well my church believes this or i think this it does not matter what matters is what the word says that's what matters i don't want to follow the easier way right i want to follow the right way i don't care if it's easy or hard i want the right way amen it's the only way and the only sign that god will ever pass because it's the literal life of jesus christ returned back into the believer that's the way it has to be with every believer today filled with the holy ghost a token that the shed blood of the lamb that life that was in the lamb has returned back and is publicly sealed in there in other words everybody sees it that everybody passing by talking to you has an associates with you seeing the blood has been applied and the token of the life that was in that blood is now upon you and you're safe from the wrath and that alone not membership no sir nothing else but let the token itself be there the person of jesus christ his own life in you circumcise not this or that but circumcise the whole being till you and christ are one christ is in you and his life lives out through you so this is the same thing that we've been talking about coming into the image of jesus christ i know this is not the old you know christmas presents that the wise men brought and having a fun time but i'll tell you to receive the life of christ as the greatest president that we could ever have amen don't let the devil tell you that you have enough you should not stop until you see it on display and it doesn't matter how many people tell you you know down inside whether you've given your life over to jesus christ because that's what happens he takes over he says but let the token itself be there the person of jesus christ only when the token is displayed then the whole family must be under the token papa and mama i know how that you feel i've got children too i've got to see them saved i'm talking to myself today brother ram says see i've got brothers i've got a sister i've got loved ones i want to see them save too but remember without the display of the token they will perish there is no resurrection for them that's right they're gone it's a serious situation and this is your identification that you've accepted god's plan met jehovah's requirements and has given you the token sign the return of the spirit that was upon christ is in you and a guaranteed identification of his life death burial and resurrection and alive forevermore now in the believing church amen he said it's a positive token a positive tolkien acts 2 37. i want this was a christmas present that was given to all of us acts 2 37. how many want the holy ghost now i'm not afraid every day to say god i need your holy ghost who am i to be up here preaching i'm unworthy to be up here preaching anytime i've ever stepped behind here i'm unworthy don't deserve to be here but i'm not here because i'm something that you need here preaching because i love you and i care i want you to have the truth the truth is the only thing that could set us free now after the apostles had received the holy ghost on the day of pentecost they were acting drunk they were acting different and in verse 37 after he got done preaching to him to all that came and said what is this what do we see here what's what's happened and he began to explain to them this is the promise that was given in the bible this is the holy ghost now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what must we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ it's for the remission of your sins well brother john i did father son holy ghost well you know i can't find that in the bible that's between you and god i'm just going to preach the bible the bible says in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive what the gift the gift of the holy ghost what a christmas gift for the promise is not just for you it's unto you but not just for you it's unto your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call i hope you're feeling the call today [Music] and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save your self from this entourage generation well you know you can very easily understand this with all the stuff that's been going on with the vaccines one and two and three and they're constantly changing two years later we're hearing different news but you know god's word has never changed but you know we get to a place where we just i'm going to make my own decision right and this is what you got to do with god you got to save yourself and here is how you do it i'm thankful that god has protected his word to this age that we could see it and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourself from this onto a generation then they that gladly received the preaching of the word they were baptized and the same day they were added onto them about 3 000 souls look what's inside this gift of the holy ghost let's stand together let's look inside this gift of the holy ghost there's love there's joy there's peace there's long suffering gentleness meekness temperance faith there's goodness all inside this gift you get that one thing and you got the whole complete package you won't be lacking you'll always be fruitful how many wants that every good and perfect gift is from above god wants us to have the holy ghost so much more than we wanted brother brandon says imagine a pipe four inch in diameter a mile high he talked about the pressure that would be at the bottom of that pipe and god wants to give us the holy ghost so much more than that so he's eager it's on his mind his thoughts we just got to connect with him amen and unfortunately it can't be one of those things where you know i'm just going to get it you know tonight i'm going to put it all in tonight and after that no the decision you make tonight you got to take it home with you the promise is on to you i never made the promise man can't make the promise god made the promise i can't keep my promises god can keep his promises amen it'll produce jesus christ the same today as it was back then amen we're not yielding to something that's odd something that's new we're yielding to the same life of god from the beginning think about what you're asking for is to act just like adam think about that the same image that adam was in that is awesome what an awesome thought let's bow our heads just a moment amen every head about every eye closed i wonder if there'd be someone here today brother john i want this holy ghost would you pray for me hands many hands praise the lord god sees amen all right all right you can put down your hands keep your your head bowed i wonder if there's someone here today says i i have received god but some has leaked out and i need a refilling amen god bless these hands wonderful wonderful amen amen put down your hands i wonder if there be anyone here that says i've received god none's leaked out i'm so full but i want more amen praise the lord praise the lord let's believe now with all of our heart heavenly father we come to you with your people lord they're pricked in their heart they're saying lord what what must i do lord they want more of you lord they've repented they've they've been baptized lord but they're desiring to see that tolkien completely displayed in their life what a beautiful desire on the outside it's hard it's not appealing but on the the inside of of you lord is life you come to give life more abundantly lord we're longing for that life not pray for every hand that was lifted lord that longing that is so precious in your sight so precious to see your own many of your own rejected you but you said to them that received you gave you gave them power to become what you are lord power to live that life they wanted to display that lord bless them fill them lord me may they not forget this night that they raised their hand in good faith towards you knowing that you're the only one that can do it lord lord that you will grant abundantly above what we're asking if you lord because that's your promise lord i pray that you would fill them with such and a bubbling such an overfilling uh lord let it be like a a spring of living water of joy just coming forth from their lives lord full of joy full of peace full of love living for you lord grant it lord we commit ourselves as a church as a body lord into your hands keep us lord till you return father we wait further on thee now the precious name of jesus christ we pray amen amen let's sing that pleasing all of you [Music] i've had it all but what i need is just more of you of things i've had i feel and yet i hunger still empty and lord hear our prayer
