[18:48] well we didn't get in any new requests
[18:51] as some of us are aware that we got a
[18:56] little update there about brother
[18:59] Marty's brother-in-law Andy we need to
[19:02] continue to pray for him even though
[19:05] there was no mass there nothing like
[19:09] that going on in his lungs we still need
[19:12] to be in prayer for him that God would
[19:15] just miraculously heal him and
[19:18] miraculously reveal himself to him and
[19:22] also to his wife marine I know our
[19:27] sister Kathleen brother Marty has spent
[19:29] many hours in prayer praying for them
[19:34] also for all their loved ones as we all
[19:36] have let's remember to pray for all of
[19:39] our loved ones those that are out of the
[19:41] Ark and safety those that are struggling
[19:43] to stay in the Ark let's be in prayer
[19:47] for our loved ones be in prayer for one
[19:50] another as things are hard
[19:55] I say spiritually for I believe not only
[20:01] our church but I'm here with other
[20:03] churches for them to stay tightly
[20:07] together and I just felt this warning
[20:10] come almost three months ago two months
[20:12] two to three months ago when this was
[20:14] transpiring what the enemy was going to
[20:16] try to do with this and and yes we're
[20:19] all continuing on our our
[20:22] with the Lord and our growth in the Lord
[20:24] but you know we're part of a body and
[20:26] there's a purpose for having a local
[20:28] body and that's for the burdens for one
[20:30] another and we don't want to lose that
[20:32] that love and burden and care for one
[20:36] another and I believe as we get on our
[20:38] knees and we're praying calling out one
[20:40] another's name that we'll we'll begin to
[20:42] feel something inside God will just say
[20:45] yes this is the one I want you to pray
[20:46] for and in inner seed because we need
[20:51] one another's prayer I need all of your
[20:53] prayers and I know that you feel that
[20:55] you need one another's prayer so let's
[20:57] let's be in prayer one for another
[20:59] let's continue to pray for complete
[21:01] healing for sister Ally and God would
[21:03] just bless ally and and and Jonathan and
[21:07] Brooke and Tyler just to be real
[21:10] spiritual parents husband and wife in
[21:18] the relationships and then also offer to

[21:24] nothing that you can wing you know

[21:29] and problems that happen in life and we
[21:32] just want God to become the center and
[21:37] the the the answer to every problem that
[21:41] they would have so let's continue to
[21:43] pray for this pray for brother sterling

[30:57] there will the eagle's be gathered
[30:59] together and the Lord Jesus he promised
[31:04] to feed the hungry to fill the thirsty
[31:07] to supply the needy men turn with me if
[31:10] you would to the book of Saint Matthew
[31:14] chapter 24 and there's been a little
[31:19] thought that's been I guess on my notes
[31:26] for Oh quite a while now and just
[31:32] waiting for the right the right time and
[31:36] it's about the the bride receiving all
[31:42] of God's atonement and we're going to be
[31:48] getting into that we're just going to be
[31:51] starting a little a little series on
[31:54] being ready for the coming of the Lord
[31:57] it really involves more than what we
[32:01] think and I just it's some of it I just
[32:03] want to make us aware of course the
[32:06] thought about being ready that's
[32:08] something that we can always be provoked
[32:13] to double-check the question are we
[32:15] ready but we want to get into something
[32:18] maybe that we haven't quite seen and on
[32:23] hopefully in doing that will provoke us
[32:25] with a little bit more energy to do
[32:29] everything that we can to be ready for
[32:31] the coming of the Lord and so we want to
[32:34] entitle this be being ready but for a
[32:37] subject we want to talk about the
[32:40] difference between getting ready or
[32:42] being ready for the rapture and so there
[32:46] is a difference between
[32:48] getting ready and being ready and in
[32:50] these scriptures that we're going to
[32:52] read we're going to see here that Jesus
[32:54] told us to be ready we got to get to the
[32:58] point where we're ready amen so let's
[33:00] just bow no word of Prayer before we
[33:02] begin reading and just ask God to bless
[33:04] this to us Heavenly Father we love your
[33:08] word we love you we thank you for so
[33:11] great a salvation in her life Lord
[33:14] you've you've saved us through
[33:17] justification you've cleaned our our
[33:20] life up to the power of the Holy Ghost
[33:23] and sanctification and Lord you have
[33:26] filled us with your Holy Spirit
[33:29] and God we're wanting to be so sure that
[33:34] we're full of your spirit enough that we
[33:38] know that we're ready for your coming
[33:41] pray as we go through this series Lord
[33:45] that you would open our eyes to the
[33:47] things that you want us to see and
[33:49] father maybe we have heard some of these
[33:51] things but they've never been revealed
[33:53] nor we're looking to you would you
[33:55] reveal them to us Lord Lord opened the
[33:58] eyes of our heart and help us to see
[34:01] things the way that you see them Lord
[34:04] bless the reading of this word and the
[34:07] message and the things that we would
[34:09] refer to Lord we just committed on to
[34:13] your hands and trust that you'll give us
[34:14] the revelation that we have Nita for
[34:16] this hour give you the praise for it for
[34:19] we humbly ask in Jesus Christ's name
[34:21] Amen
[34:22] amen turn with me if you would to st.
[34:25] Matthew chapter 24 starting with verse
[34:27] number 42 watch therefore for ye know
[34:35] not what hour your Lord doth come but
[34:41] know this that if the good man of the
[34:43] house had known in what watch the thief
[34:46] were to come he would have launched and
[34:50] would have not suffered his house to be
[34:53] broken up therefore be ye also ready for
[34:59] in such an hour
[35:01] as you think not the Son of man cometh I
[35:05] want to read that one more time before
[35:07] we read verse 45 therefore be ye also
[35:10] ready for in such an hour as you think
[35:13] not the Son of man cometh who then is a
[35:16] faithful and wise servant whom his Lord
[35:20] have made ruler over his household to
[35:22] give him meat in due season amen god
[35:26] bless you may be seated
[35:29] amen I want to read start off by reading
[35:34] a quote that brother Branham had in the
[35:38] message God hiding himself in simplicity
[35:43] and then get to maybe some points of
[35:45] interest that we're gonna try to hit
[35:47] through this series but brother Branham
[35:49] said you know these things the time is
[35:53] at hand Church the time is at hand don't
[35:57] don't don't
[36:00] wait any longer now this was back in 63
[36:07] well we can't say that was brother
[36:09] random that had to be God in brother
[36:13] Branham the time is still at hand the
[36:17] time is more hand now
[36:18] he said don't don't don't wait any
[36:21] longer see he says how do you know the
[36:24] rapture is not going on all the time wow
[36:31] what an eye-opener right there first
[36:34] thing you know it it'll be past one
[36:36] disappears here and there it'll be gone
[36:38] the first thing you know and judgment
[36:41] will strike the world and you'll say
[36:43] well I thought this it's too late now
[36:49] remember they didn't know it until the
[36:53] day they entered into the ark and then
[36:56] it was too late
[36:57] the foolish virgin didn't know until she
[37:00] come back and found the wise virgin gone
[37:03] then she was left for the Tribulation
[37:07] Period now no good teacher belief at the
[37:11] church goals
[37:14] through the tribulation I just want us
[37:16] I'm going to just stop there for a
[37:17] second please
[37:18] when brother branham and we're going to
[37:21] see this here brother branham sometimes
[37:24] refers to the church as the bride and
[37:27] sometimes he refers to it as not the
[37:30] bride but just the church and remember
[37:35] all the church that came out of Egypt
[37:37] did not go into the promised land so
[37:41] they were all God's people they were all
[37:43] the church but there was just the chosen
[37:46] the elected that went into the promised
[37:48] land
[37:49] so and we'll try to make that as clear
[37:53] as anything when we're going through it
[37:56] no good teacher believes that the church
[37:58] goes through the tribulation but not the
[38:01] bride
[38:04] see not the bride just the church goes
[38:08] through the tribulation the church goes
[38:10] through for purification sure under the
[38:14] sixth seal right Israel does the same
[38:19] thing for the 144,000 but not the bride
[38:24] amen
[38:25] the bride is forgiven missus think about
[38:31] it the bride is forgiven she goes
[38:33] straight to glory in a rapture that's
[38:35] right
[38:36] she my opinion the last member will be
[38:39] caught up one of these days it might
[38:41] come and you won't even know nothing
[38:43] about it remember it's a secret secret
[38:46] he says two secrets secret secret
[38:49] touching away he'll come in an hour when
[38:52] you think not you won't know nothing
[38:54] about it and she'll be gone it'll be too
[38:57] late then tell some points of interest
[39:00] here brother branham said the bride's
[39:03] forgiven does that mean that the church
[39:07] isn't forgiven why does he make that
[39:11] statement the bride's able to go in a
[39:15] rapture because she's forgiven well what
[39:20] about the rest of the church are they
[39:23] not forgiven this is what I want to get
[39:26] into this great subject
[39:27] about receiving the full atonement the
[39:30] fullness of Calvary and not just a part
[39:34] of it so some other points of interest
[39:37] that we're going to be getting into and
[39:39] I hope you there be a wit okay with you
[39:41] if we we take your time and have it more
[39:44] of a teaching rather than a preaching
[39:48] the rapture is a complete secret
[39:53] complete secret such a secret that in
[39:57] the midst of the church God is dividing
[40:00] between the two sets of believers the
[40:05] bride in the church the same word is
[40:09] being preached but he's revealing to the
[40:13] one but not to the other there
[40:18] revelation of what's required of God in
[40:22] order to be ready so here we are if God
[40:26] says this is what you we need to do to
[40:28] be ready whatever it would be let's just
[40:30] I I don't mean to be too silly but if
[40:34] God said what we need to do is is hold
[40:38] this pen to be ready the devil would be
[40:41] simply saying well you know as you gotta
[40:43] do is put your pocket or all you have to
[40:45] do is make sure it's near you or or that
[40:48] that is on something you possess and so
[40:51] he's always trying to misinterpret what
[40:55] God is really meaning and so this the in
[40:59] the revelation of what God is saying is
[41:04] so crucial for the rapture so it always
[41:10] being prayer Lord give me the revelation
[41:12] of what's being said so I don't I don't
[41:15] miss it and it's okay that when you pray
[41:18] it you still feel you don't got it you
[41:20] keep praying you keep laying it before
[41:21] the Lord you keep believing now it's not
[41:24] something that we work up to but it's
[41:26] certainly nothing you can be just casual
[41:28] about and says well I'm bride I'll get
[41:30] it when I'm ready I don't think it's
[41:32] going to work like that because this
[41:34] quote that brother Brandon saying it
[41:36] that he's he's hid in simplicity it's
[41:38] going to be a secret catching away and
[41:40] then
[41:40] telling us to be ready what are we gonna
[41:42] do to be ready it's not just saying
[41:44] we're ready things we have to do brother
[41:49] branham also makes mention and the
[41:51] question he says that the rapture is
[41:53] already in progress which means secretly
[41:58] the bride is getting ready while the
[42:01] foolish virgins are sleeping away their
[42:04] opportunity to get ready or they're
[42:07] waiting for the preaching or something
[42:10] like that to actually motivate them the
[42:16] rapture is in progress I mean if you
[42:19] were gonna go to to Cedar Point or
[42:23] someplace like that you were gonna get
[42:25] on a ride you you know like you get on a
[42:30] carousel and you pay you go through the
[42:32] gate and everybody gets on their their
[42:35] little horse there you know it's not
[42:37] moving yet because it's in a standstill
[42:41] place and the open the other people got
[42:43] to get off the new people got to get on
[42:45] and when everybody's on then that
[42:48] carousel or that ride begins to go and
[42:51] it's in progress and brother branham
[42:54] saying how do you know that rapture is
[42:56] not going on right now it's not in
[42:58] progress right now there's important
[43:00] things that are going on and this is for
[43:02] the bride hey man this message is for
[43:05] the bride and we just want to to be
[43:10] readying them so how do we know that
[43:14] we're ready another point of interest
[43:15] we're gonna get into how do we know
[43:17] where that we're we're ready ready we're
[43:19] living in in perilous times where a
[43:21] deception is all around us it's it's
[43:24] heavy duty that the whole church is is
[43:27] is is being deceived by by Satan every
[43:30] chance he can many believers feel that
[43:37] what's required of them that is is that
[43:39] they all say have to do is be in in the
[43:41] message of the hour or all they got to
[43:45] do is is have the holy ghost in reality
[43:48] justification and sanctification is is
[43:51] though is also a portion of the Holy
[43:53] Ghost brother Branham
[43:56] so maybe it's just not being associated
[44:00] with the denomination so we can see here
[44:02] being ready can really string off in a
[44:07] number of different areas and you know
[44:11] how it's it's just humanity that people
[44:15] want about it gravitate to something as
[44:17] an evidence like speaking in a tongues
[44:20] now I know that I'm going right III I've
[44:24] done this or my name is on the book I
[44:26] belong to this church it's like they got
[44:30] to be able to identify something natural
[44:34] get it over with
[44:35] and so it's done and I don't believe
[44:39] being ready as anything like that it's
[44:42] nothing like that
[44:43] because if it was Jesus were to just
[44:45] said that in other words if all you had
[44:49] to do was speak in tongues you wouldn't
[44:51] have to worry about somebody breaking
[44:53] into your whole mess or you wouldn't
[44:55] have to worry about watching your home
[44:56] you wouldn't have to worry about being
[44:58] ready because you had right so another
[45:04] point of interest is both the bride and
[45:06] the church will have to be purified the
[45:13] bride will be purified before the
[45:17] rapture the bride before the rapture is
[45:22] forced to be purified through self will
[45:29] the church after the rapture is forced
[45:34] to be purified through tribulation
[45:38] against her will and those are the
[45:41] difference but both the bride and the
[45:45] church has to be purified and we're
[45:50] going to get deeper into that we're
[45:52] gonna we're gonna get deeper into them
[45:55] it's true and I love this part of the
[45:57] quote and I got like so many pages of
[46:00] quotes we're not hardly going to get to
[46:02] any but brother Branham makes mention
[46:07] in a number of our quotes that Christ
[46:13] went to Calvary and paid the price for
[46:15] the bride
[46:17] the difference is the bride receives all
[46:21] of the atonement the church does not but
[46:26] the bride still has to become purified
[46:29] and it's through self will you deny your
[46:35] flesh and we're gonna please get into it
[46:37] just I guess at this point you're gonna
[46:39] have to put that one on the Shelf if
[46:41] you're not a hundred percent on board
[46:43] with that one
[46:44] now there is a difference between
[46:45] getting ready and being ready and Jesus
[46:50] never said spend your time getting ready
[46:53] he just said be ready be ready Jesus
[47:00] warns us and admonishes us to be ready
[47:03] all the time for his return even though
[47:09] we look at the rapture as a single event
[47:13] the requirement is to be ready before
[47:17] that event so we look at the raptures of
[47:22] is a is it is it is a catching away is a
[47:25] one moment be ready in that moment catch
[47:28] away and it's gonna happen one of the
[47:32] dangers in viewing the rapture as a
[47:34] single event is the tendency of making
[47:38] more light of it an example of this we
[47:41] look at it as one event in other words
[47:44] the one event isn't here yet it hasn't
[47:46] happened so I don't need to worry about
[47:50] it I don't need to deal with it
[47:52] presently
[47:53] because it's not here it's it's there in
[47:55] the future thus causing a spirit of
[47:59] slothfulness laziness lukewarmness to
[48:02] set in because it's over there and
[48:06] that's why I really like what brother
[48:08] Branham said we're the rapture is in
[48:11] process right now and another example is
[48:15] because it's this single event and the
[48:20] Prophet thought
[48:21] it would happen before right he made
[48:24] mention when he thought it couldn't go
[48:26] any longer than a certain date and if we
[48:30] look at it as a a single event thus
[48:34] causing a spirit of unsureness with us
[48:38] on awareness of when it's going to be
[48:41] thus opening the door to the lord
[48:44] delayeth his coming and saying where is
[48:49] the promise you know this is what the
[48:51] Prophet said where is it I thought it
[48:53] was supposed to be so both of these
[48:57] these this thought process of the
[49:00] rapture being out there really takes
[49:03] away from us living in a ready state for
[49:10] the Lord and that's really what the
[49:12] requirement is for the rapture is living
[49:15] ready amen
[49:16] it's living ready so if we view the
[49:19] rapture as a long multi-stage series of
[49:24] events that culminate into a final
[49:27] touching away will be more like to have
[49:32] the tendency to always be ready before
[49:35] the finality of the rapture so it really
[49:45] opens our eyes spiritually to be looking
[49:49] at and I hope it does by the time this
[49:52] series is done that we begin to look
[49:54] everyday for the rapture more and to be
[49:58] looking about getting ready and what do
[50:00] I have to do what is this what is this
[50:01] this part of the that where's the chain
[50:04] of the event that that's where I'm
[50:07] supposed to be today what am I supposed
[50:08] to be working on to get ready Jesus
[50:12] gives us the most important structions
[50:14] when he tells us to be ready all the
[50:17] time for his return the only thing we
[50:21] have to do is be ready but be ready all
[50:26] the time God will take care of
[50:31] everything
[50:31] if we're ready just be
[50:34] ready if we're not ready we would not be
[50:39] able to take off and win the race for
[50:43] example when a race is getting ready to
[50:47] begin and all of us have been in races
[50:49] even if it was in school when we're
[50:55] getting ready to to do a race I don't
[50:57] care if it's a sprinter or or what it is
[51:02] usually you hear something like this get
[51:05] ready get set go it's like one two three
[51:15] or we might here on the mark get set go
[51:22] so the second to get set and go remain
[51:26] the same but the first two is
[51:29] interchangeable get ready ready means on
[51:32] the mark get ready is the same as on the
[51:36] mark
[51:37] get on the mark get ready press what was
[51:41] Paul mean when he's saying I pressed
[51:43] towards the mark getting to that place
[51:45] that I'm ready to go
[51:48] not that I have attained he said but he
[51:51] was pressing towards that if we were
[51:53] going to do a race if I was going to do
[51:55] a race and I was gonna have to run a
[51:57] mile and it had to be you know less than
[52:01] a half hour
[52:04] well I wouldn't be ready enough to like
[52:07] prepare and practice and and get get to
[52:11] a place where I could even get up to the
[52:13] line and says ready get ready get set be
[52:19] ready so it's not something that you can
[52:26] just walk up to the rapture and say I'm
[52:27] ready
[52:30] there's we have to get ready before we
[52:34] are ready so there is a prize for the
[52:41] high calling of God in Christ Jesus and
[52:45] we got to get on the mark
[52:47] you're on the mark that means you're not
[52:50] walking around stretching anymore you're
[52:53] not just you know doing one of these
[52:55] things and trying to get ready for no
[52:57] you're you're on the mark you're ready
[52:59] to go and this is what our goal should
[53:03] be every day for the rapture is is be
[53:07] right there on the mark ready to go we
[53:11] need to be pressing in all the time to
[53:13] get ready or be ready for the Lord's
[53:17] return turn with me to first
[53:19] Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 5 did I
[53:30] say first 5 I haven't saved verse 15
[53:32] first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 15
[53:35] for this we say unto you by the word of
[53:41] the Lord that we which are alive and
[53:44] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[53:47] not prevent them which are asleep for
[53:53] the Lord himself shall descend from
[53:55] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[53:57] the Archangel with the trumpet of God
[53:59] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[54:01] then we which are alive and remain shall
[54:03] be caught up together with them in the
[54:05] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[54:08] so shall we ever be at the Lord
[54:10] wherefore comfort one another with these
[54:12] words
[54:13] amen wonderful wonderful and this is
[54:16] what Jesus wanted us to be ready for was
[54:20] this return now why do you think Jesus
[54:28] was telling his disciples in the people
[54:33] of that time and he also allowed the
[54:38] people in the first church age second
[54:41] church age and third search age to all
[54:47] think that Jesus could be come in any
[54:52] anytime soon here we need to be ready
[54:54] and there's going to be a kitchen away
[54:55] we're not all going to sleep in and and
[54:57] it's going to be we're going to be
[54:59] caught up why would
[55:01] allow that to go through all the church
[55:04] ages why did he say why did he just say
[55:07] at the end there's gonna be a catching
[55:11] away right why didn't he just say that
[55:14] because it would not accomplish what God
[55:18] wants to see in his bronde because he's
[55:21] got a bride in every age and they're
[55:25] asleep
[55:26] he's also got there's a church in every
[55:29] age - and there's a bride and those that
[55:35] got ready lived ready died ready we'll
[55:41] race together amen so it's not about
[55:46] this single event because everybody else
[55:50] in the other 6 Church ages didn't have
[55:56] that one single event happen in their
[55:58] life but they still had the same
[56:00] requirement that Jesus was giving and
[56:03] that's to be ready and this really opens
[56:07] the door for us understand the
[56:10] importance of the rapture is not just
[56:14] that single event but that the rapture
[56:17] is happening right now around us it's
[56:20] perhaps something we're not thinking
[56:21] about much something that we're not
[56:24] provoked much to think about
[56:27] because you get Scott so many things
[56:30] going on in our life and now we're kind
[56:33] of wondering what's going to happen in
[56:34] the world and will we ever get back to
[56:36] normal and a lot of crazy stuff but the
[56:43] Lord wants us in tune with him about the
[56:47] rapture that's taking place right now so
[56:51] brother Branham said that the Lord does
[56:53] all of these three and we know this
[56:55] reference verse 16 the Lord himself
[56:57] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[56:59] with the voice and with the Trump now
[57:04] brother Ram told us that that shout was
[57:06] the message that calls the bride
[57:09] together to get them ready okay that's
[57:14] all we have to do is write there the
[57:18] voice of the Archangel is the voice of
[57:22] the resurrection for the sleeping bride
[57:26] amen
[57:28] because not all are awake right now all
[57:33] of them awake just the bride and then
[57:38] the trumpet of God calls us together
[57:41] those that are sleep and those which are
[57:45] alive to the marriage supper in the sky
[57:48] now that's what that scripture is now we
[57:52] don't have to worry about that those
[57:55] that are dead in know those that are
[57:59] bright it was that are sleeping excuse
[58:01] me unless the Lord does determine to use
[58:04] those which are alive to call them which
[58:07] are asleep that's very possible I don't
[58:10] know I'm not making a doctrine but it
[58:14] will be that if that happens it will be
[58:16] the war through the bride for sure but
[58:19] nevertheless we don't make that call for
[58:22] the marriage supper and and we and
[58:26] ourselves don't have to worry about
[58:28] making that call for the the the the the
[58:33] dead in Christ or the bride that's
[58:36] sleeping as he said it but we do have to
[58:40] worry about being ready together and
[58:45] this message is what brings us together
[58:48] we're where we need to be can you say
[58:52] amen amen
[58:54] I wish you're all here told you this is
[58:57] going to be more of a of a study all
[59:00] right and getting ready for this big
[59:02] race you're you're racing number one
[59:07] against yourself
[59:09] part of you is racing against part of
[59:12] you it's not my brother or my sister o
[59:18] Lord but it's me that's standing in the
[59:22] need of prayer you're racing against
[59:26] yourself so it really doesn't matter
[59:28] where everybody else is at they that
[59:31] compare themselves with them Celsus
[59:33] unwise anyways what we need to be paying
[59:36] attention to is who you're racing
[59:39] against you the spirit man is racing
[59:45] against you the natural man it's the
[59:49] black dog and the white dog as we heard
[59:51] the story the spiritual man is winning
[59:55] as long as he suffocates the natural man
[59:59] because honestly you can't take the
[1:00:01] natural man and kill him today and he's
[1:00:05] going to be dead tomorrow you may be
[1:00:07] successful at putting them under your
[1:00:12] feet today and in crucifying the flesh
[1:00:14] and brother Marty brought out a
[1:00:17] wonderful study in the men's meeting
[1:00:20] about the will of God was always if you
[1:00:25] were going to do the will of God it will
[1:00:27] always be including suffering because
[1:00:31] the old man has to die out in order for
[1:00:35] the will of God to be done because this
[1:00:36] old man just ain't going to let the will
[1:00:39] of God be done it just doesn't it wants
[1:00:41] popularity it wants it wants to uses his
[1:00:45] influence at once Mussoorie it wants to
[1:00:53] go the easy path it doesn't want to
[1:00:56] serve others it wants others to look at
[1:00:58] them and say look what I done Irv I
[1:01:00] achieved and the spirit man has to
[1:01:05] suffocate the natural man so he can't do
[1:01:08] though so he can't perform he can't act
[1:01:10] like that he doesn't have that character
[1:01:14] anymore or that lack of character
[1:01:16] anymore to to do that and unfortunately
[1:01:21] it's an everyday affair and that's why
[1:01:24] he say the spirit man is winning if he's
[1:01:27] suffocating the the natural man or the
[1:01:31] carnal man now the natural man is
[1:01:34] winning as long as he is allowed to live
[1:01:38] I'm just gonna make it that clear the
[1:01:41] natural man
[1:01:42] is winning in your race as long as he's
[1:01:46] allowed to go on crusade untouched if
[1:01:50] he's allowed to have his way if it's
[1:01:53] like there's nothing I need to do well
[1:01:56] he's basically having his way and
[1:01:59] there's not a way that we're actually
[1:02:02] ready for the rapture with that type of
[1:02:05] attitude every day you know we we slip
[1:02:07] while we make mistakes and yes I
[1:02:09] understand that but I'm talking about
[1:02:12] we're trying we're gonna get into
[1:02:14] something forward we're going to try to
[1:02:17] fine-tune what it means to be ready
[1:02:21] first Corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 and
[1:02:26] this this whole this whole message they
[1:02:30] maybe end up being a foundation first
[1:02:35] Corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 know ye
[1:02:37] not that they which run in a race run
[1:02:39] all but one receiveth the prize and Paul
[1:02:42] saying here so run that ye may obtain
[1:02:46] don't just well I'm bride you know I'm
[1:02:51] there I'm let no we have something to do
[1:02:54] we've got to run that we may obtain not
[1:02:59] I've already attained I don't need to
[1:03:02] run so we haven't attained to something
[1:03:05] and Paul talked about that there in
[1:03:07] Philippians not that we have attained
[1:03:09] but I pressed towards the mark kind of
[1:03:11] saying a similar thing here in the 1st
[1:03:13] Corinthians chapter 9 he says so run
[1:03:17] that ye may obtain now you can't obtain
[1:03:19] sitting around and saying Jesus ran the
[1:03:22] race for me you can't do that Jesus paid
[1:03:26] it off you can't do that yes he paid it
[1:03:28] all he he paid the price
[1:03:31] but we still have to overcome this less
[1:03:35] we still have to win the race we still
[1:03:37] have to press towards the mark now every
[1:03:39] man that striveth for the mastery is
[1:03:41] temperate all things that they do it to
[1:03:43] obtain a corruptible crown but we an
[1:03:44] incorruptible crown I therefore so run
[1:03:49] so he's making a declaration this is
[1:03:52] what I'm doing in the race um running I
[1:03:54] have a
[1:03:56] purpose I'm not sitting around I'm not
[1:03:58] just sitting around waiting for the
[1:03:59] rapture to happen I'm not sitting around
[1:04:01] just waiting for that that a combination
[1:04:04] event to happen in the catching away I'm
[1:04:07] not doing that I'm running running I'm
[1:04:12] running now this flesh is trying to run
[1:04:18] with me he's trying to get his way he's
[1:04:21] trying to do his will instead of having
[1:04:24] God's well done further Marty we'll
[1:04:25] probably late this message because he is
[1:04:27] talking about the will of God and we can
[1:04:32] see the tying in here this suffering
[1:04:34] right here he says I therefore so run
[1:04:36] not as uncertainly sulfide a not as one
[1:04:39] that beateth the air there's no
[1:04:43] unsureness with Paul
[1:04:44] there was no why hope I you know hope
[1:04:48] this is the right thing to do to be
[1:04:49] ready to hit the rapture no he says but
[1:04:53] I keep under my body and bring it into
[1:04:56] subjection and that's the main thing I
[1:04:59] want to say lest by any means when I
[1:05:01] preach to others I just I myself should
[1:05:03] be a castaway Paul was running with
[1:05:06] confidence and with purpose he said I'm
[1:05:11] fighting to buff it my body and to bring
[1:05:15] it into bondage now that's exactly what
[1:05:18] that means when he says but I keep under
[1:05:20] my body and bring it into subjection
[1:05:23] what it really means is that word
[1:05:26] Buffett means to strike against to push
[1:05:29] repeatedly and bring it into bondage he
[1:05:32] brought his body under the bondage of
[1:05:35] course is suffering of course it of
[1:05:36] course it was an enjoyable thing for his
[1:05:38] flesh to do but that's the only way you
[1:05:42] can run the race with surety and
[1:05:45] confidence you don't want them you know
[1:05:50] as a when you're with a child and you're
[1:05:56] playing a game I used to play chess with
[1:06:00] my sons
[1:06:01] play ball run there's a lot of things
[1:06:04] you could do to maybe compete with
[1:06:06] somebody
[1:06:08] and oftentimes just running against a
[1:06:13] female well I would you know you you got
[1:06:18] an upper hand so when you know you got
[1:06:20] to upper hand what somebody but you want
[1:06:23] to make the race interesting well then
[1:06:25] you let them kind of catch up you let
[1:06:28] them you know make it interesting as it
[1:06:33] were you do not want to make the race
[1:06:37] with your flesh interesting it never
[1:06:40] works out it he just hangs you out to
[1:06:44] dry and you're behind and so we need to
[1:06:52] strike against the flesh we need to push
[1:06:55] repeatedly against it that's why Jesus
[1:06:58] said die daily and bring it think about
[1:07:02] this into bondage bring your flesh to a
[1:07:07] place where it wants to get out and have
[1:07:10] its way but you don't let it this is the
[1:07:15] place to be to be ready if we're letting
[1:07:20] that flesh just roam and kind of do
[1:07:22] things that really shouldn't be doing
[1:07:26] are we really ready a lot of people
[1:07:31] don't like this kind of race they like a
[1:07:35] race that it's a sprint okay I'll repent
[1:07:38] I'll get baptized and I'm part of the
[1:07:40] body they like a race they they can
[1:07:45] split real hard one time but they're not
[1:07:48] for pushing repeatedly they're not for
[1:07:54] continuing to strike up that flesh and
[1:07:56] say you're no good this race is an
[1:08:01] endurance race it's not a sprint jesus
[1:08:03] said in Matthew 24:13 he says but he
[1:08:06] that shall endure unto the end the same
[1:08:10] shall be saved it's such a powerful
[1:08:13] statement because when Paul is talking
[1:08:18] to the unconverted or Peters talking to
[1:08:22] the unconverted he just says repent be
[1:08:25] baptized for the remission of your sins
[1:08:30] you're gonna receive the Holy Ghost
[1:08:32] you're going to be saved they they're
[1:08:35] calling the name of the Lord shall be
[1:08:37] saved they believe in their heart and
[1:08:39] confess with their mouth and so when
[1:08:43] we're introducing the plan of salvation
[1:08:48] it's in a way that here are the the
[1:08:52] criteria that you do for for salvation
[1:08:56] but then as you get deeper to the
[1:08:58] scriptures when you read statements like
[1:09:02] today is the day of salvation not back
[1:09:06] then today is on he that endured to the
[1:09:09] end the same shall be saved
[1:09:11] we cannot just look at something in the
[1:09:14] past some sprint in the past and say
[1:09:17] that's good enough when Jesus is
[1:09:21] teaching us in this very very same
[1:09:23] chapter about being ready so the spirit
[1:09:30] man has to suffocate the natural man to
[1:09:33] strike against a push repeatedly in
[1:09:35] order to grow in the love of Christ to
[1:09:40] overcome and develop the character that
[1:09:44] we need to make it out of here or to go
[1:09:47] on a rapture hebrews chapter 12 verse
[1:09:49] number 1 wherefore seeing we also are
[1:09:57] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:10:00] witnesses let us lay aside most of the
[1:10:04] weights that we have every weight and
[1:10:11] not only the weight I love how he
[1:10:15] separates us and the sin so there's
[1:10:18] maybe certain things there that we
[1:10:20] wouldn't identify as outright sin but
[1:10:26] they're our weight and they will turn
[1:10:28] into sin sure sure is anything
[1:10:34] and the sin which does so easily beset
[1:10:39] us and let us run with patience the race
[1:10:44] that set before snow sprint it's a
[1:10:47] longevity race it's an endurance race
[1:10:49] and he's saying if you don't if you
[1:10:53] don't crucify the old man if you don't
[1:10:56] suffocate the old man if if you allow
[1:11:00] things to creep in because that's how
[1:11:04] they happen creep in slow into your life
[1:11:06] what will happen is it will be set you
[1:11:10] in the race it'll put you behind it's no
[1:11:15] longer I'm going by the grace of God by
[1:11:18] the time we're done with this it's not
[1:11:20] gonna be well I'm in the message that's
[1:11:22] it I'll be good enough it's not gonna
[1:11:24] work it's not gonna work it's not just
[1:11:29] being in the message it's where are you
[1:11:32] in the race that's worth that where are
[1:11:35] you in the race are you be set or you
[1:11:38] upfront are you running or you just kind
[1:11:43] of beat in the air just uncertain where
[1:11:45] you're at in the race you know where
[1:11:48] you're at when you're crucifying the
[1:11:50] flesh you're praying through you're
[1:11:53] pressing towards the mark you're in love
[1:11:55] winning souls for Jesus Christ you know
[1:11:57] where you're at with em you know where
[1:12:00] you're at it's just when you left the
[1:12:03] foot your pedal but your foot off the
[1:12:07] pedal and you begin to glide brother
[1:12:10] Graham said you take the oars out of the
[1:12:12] out of the boat and you just you're not
[1:12:15] working hard against the current because
[1:12:19] maybe the wind is strong and it's
[1:12:20] getting hard and you just need a break
[1:12:22] and before you know it the sin the
[1:12:26] weights are be setting us and then we're
[1:12:28] wondering where the victor is at where
[1:12:31] are the joys that where the where the
[1:12:33] peace is that where are the things that
[1:12:34] come from being where you need to be
[1:12:38] with Christ no matter what furnace
[1:12:42] you're going through no matter what
[1:12:43] lion's den you're in no matter what fish
[1:12:47] you're in God is there to to meet every
[1:12:53] internal need that we would have in this
[1:12:57] church of on earth amen praise the Lord
[1:12:59] all right so God has called us out of
[1:13:03] the world and he has set this race
[1:13:05] before us and it's up to us to choose
[1:13:09] how we're gonna run it run it whatever
[1:13:11] pace you want run how often you want it
[1:13:15] but Paul was trying to tell us to run it
[1:13:18] with everything we got
[1:13:20] Amen lay aside that weights and just you
[1:13:26] know how easier it would be to run if we
[1:13:30] lost twenty pounds it would be so cool
[1:13:33] we'd just better run faster and feel
[1:13:35] better well so it is you know what's in
[1:13:38] we got to lay that aside and and run the
[1:13:41] race looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:13:46] the finisher afraid I love that now he's
[1:13:49] taking us from the beginning when we
[1:13:52] when we got saved when we thought we got
[1:13:55] saved if I could say like that one
[1:13:57] repented gave her heart to Christ and we
[1:13:59] went around at that point and we said
[1:14:01] i'm saved i'm saved i'm saved
[1:14:03] we didn't go around at that point and
[1:14:04] say you know what i was saved before the
[1:14:06] foundation of the world we didn't do
[1:14:08] that i came afterwards after we had more
[1:14:11] knowledge and understanding but here
[1:14:15] paul is saying we're looking not only to
[1:14:19] the author but the finisher he that
[1:14:23] endureth to the end so that rapture are
[1:14:27] are the process of being ready were in
[1:14:33] that right now amen
[1:14:36] looking unto Jesus the author and fish
[1:14:38] for a faith who for the joy that was set
[1:14:41] before him he endured his suffering and
[1:14:45] that's what we have to do when we look
[1:14:47] that we gotta suffocate this old man
[1:14:50] suffocate his will not let him get away
[1:14:53] with what he wants to where's the
[1:14:56] straight to do that the strength is in
[1:14:58] the joy of the Lord
[1:15:00] the joy of the Lord is our strength
[1:15:03] praise God
[1:15:05] just fall in love with them spend more
[1:15:07] time with them share Jesus with somebody
[1:15:10] you know I understand that we can't
[1:15:13] bring anybody churches we're not even
[1:15:14] gathered at a church but you could be
[1:15:16] inviting them to the live streaming you
[1:15:20] really could what it what a joy that
[1:15:23] would give can can I just go way off
[1:15:27] grid right now a brother sent me this
[1:15:33] quote today and I just want to read it I
[1:15:36] didn't get it I didn't print I wasn't
[1:15:38] going to read it but it just came to my
[1:15:41] heart it's an a message brother random
[1:15:44] preach convinced and concerned he said
[1:15:47] he had his home paid for just like we do
[1:15:52] today that's the first thing we think
[1:15:55] about is pay for a home he said that's
[1:16:00] good you ought to that's right
[1:16:03] but there's something ought to come
[1:16:06] before that it's God first the going on
[1:16:13] of the church it's every man's duty in
[1:16:17] this church right here to see that the
[1:16:23] thing goes on right and you put your
[1:16:28] force to it to bring every man every
[1:16:32] woman every boy every girl that you can
[1:16:35] in the streets in the hedges and the
[1:16:38] byways to bring them into the church
[1:16:44] well I'll tell you what if you're doing
[1:16:46] that you got the joy of the Lord I mean
[1:16:49] all heaven rejoices over one soul the
[1:16:53] joy of the Lord is our strength
[1:16:54] and unfortunately the joy that that we
[1:16:58] feel sometimes that we get in the world
[1:17:03] from things going just right our way is
[1:17:05] really only a temporal thing because the
[1:17:09] joy that I'm talking about is the joy
[1:17:12] that you can receive when you're in the
[1:17:13] middle of a trial and things are not
[1:17:16] going your way and you're not getting
[1:17:18] what you want but something inside of
[1:17:21] you gives you such strength that you can
[1:17:24] tell the old man the flesh you're not
[1:17:27] having your way you're not you're not
[1:17:29] gonna talk like that you're not gonna
[1:17:31] act like that you're gone you're dead
[1:17:33] I'm suffocating you and God is gonna get
[1:17:37] the glory through my life today amen
[1:17:39] I love that all right let's finish
[1:17:44] reading that looking unto Jesus the
[1:17:46] author fish for our faith who for the
[1:17:47] joy that was set before him endured the
[1:17:50] cross despising the shame and is set
[1:17:53] down at the right hand of the throne of
[1:17:57] God all right where does that put us
[1:18:01] that puts us at revelations chapter 3
[1:18:04] verse 21
[1:18:09] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:18:13] sit with me on my throne even as I also
[1:18:18] overcame and set down with my father in
[1:18:24] his throne now we have a chance to sit
[1:18:28] together with Jesus on the throne right
[1:18:33] next to him but there's something we
[1:18:36] have to do we have to overcome and we
[1:18:41] have to overcome all things and when you
[1:18:44] overcome your flesh you've overcome all
[1:18:47] things because that's your enemy that's
[1:18:49] what stands in the way of if that's what
[1:18:53] will stand in the way of everyone
[1:18:56] missing the rapture everyone that misses
[1:19:00] the rapture their flesh got in the way
[1:19:02] those that did not go on like that in
[1:19:04] Matthew 25 that the ten virgins the five
[1:19:08] that didn't go on and get the oil what
[1:19:10] stood in their way their flesh because
[1:19:15] it takes a real dying out a real craving
[1:19:18] a real hunger a real thirsty a real I
[1:19:22] need this
[1:19:25] for the Holy Ghost sometimes it does now
[1:19:29] if you just believe will be it unto me
[1:19:32] according to thy word Lord it can come
[1:19:34] without sensation absolutely it can but
[1:19:38] the thing is if your flesh is in the way
[1:19:40] don't expect it to happen we we have to
[1:19:45] purify ourselves we're going to get into
[1:19:48] this and I hope you can maybe remember
[1:19:52] this as we go on to the next parts of it
[1:19:55] so you know me I have a kind of a
[1:19:57] tendency of Reap repeating some of these
[1:20:00] things but we have to overcome not just
[1:20:03] certain things but we have to overcome
[1:20:06] all things right verse 22 now he that
[1:20:11] have an ear let him hear what the Spirit
[1:20:14] is saying unto the church and this is
[1:20:16] this is where we're at today we're we're
[1:20:20] the church and we're praying I'm praying
[1:20:23] God give me an ear to hear what you're
[1:20:27] saying to the church and if we're all
[1:20:30] praying God give me that ear I believe
[1:20:33] we're going to be more likely to hear
[1:20:35] because the Spirit of Laodicea the other
[1:20:37] the spirit of the church not the bride
[1:20:40] now but the Spirit of the church is so
[1:20:42] strong it's in need of nothing it
[1:20:46] doesn't feel it needs an ear it's
[1:20:47] already gotten here it's it's attitude
[1:20:51] is different and therefore they never
[1:20:56] get ready now the devil has a lot of
[1:21:00] interpretations of what it means to be
[1:21:04] ready what it means to have overcome and
[1:21:08] be ready for the rapture some believe if
[1:21:14] they're no longer a part of a
[1:21:16] denomination they're no longer a part of
[1:21:21] a man-made system they kind of came out
[1:21:23] of that that they they're ready some
[1:21:31] feel if you don't take the mark of the
[1:21:33] beast if you don't take 666
[1:21:37] that they're ready not realizing that
[1:21:41] this is the number of man's will and
[1:21:46] everybody's stuck with it everybody's
[1:21:48] facing a will in their flesh they're
[1:21:55] called they're man's well the natural
[1:21:56] will and brother branham said he made it
[1:22:00] real clear the mark of the beast is not
[1:22:02] to receive the seal the Holy Ghost so
[1:22:05] the Holy Ghost is God's will in a
[1:22:08] person's life and we can not be part of
[1:22:14] a denomination we can not receive the
[1:22:17] number six six anything injected in us
[1:22:20] or and our forehead or in a hand but yet
[1:22:22] have a will of our own even though we're
[1:22:25] against the the system the them trying
[1:22:29] to inject things in us or the government
[1:22:31] or the denominations or the world
[1:22:35] console churches but yet still hold on
[1:22:37] to you we'll see how it's so slick so
[1:22:43] slick
[1:22:44] we need the CEO of God and not just a
[1:22:48] portion of the Holy Ghost think the
[1:22:52] biggest interpretation of what it means
[1:22:56] to be ready is I'm in the message I
[1:22:59] honestly think that for us that is the
[1:23:02] biggest misinterpretation of what it
[1:23:05] means to be ready not realizing that the
[1:23:08] message has to be in us living out of us
[1:23:12] to perform the will of God the majority
[1:23:17] of the devil's interpretations possess a
[1:23:20] portion of truth making it difficult to
[1:23:23] write to define it so we want to take a
[1:23:26] look at this not so much in a
[1:23:30] black-and-white way but we want to look
[1:23:36] at it where the black and white come and
[1:23:39] they meet as close as we can
[1:23:41] I'm going to call this the borderline
[1:23:45] were the borders of the to meet and try
[1:23:49] to identify that a little bit more
[1:23:51] so we want to recognize basically
[1:23:54] borderline believers first of all I want
[1:23:57] us to think of remember this when we're
[1:23:59] thinking about a borderline believer the
[1:24:06] first thing is that they are believers
[1:24:09] they are believers they believe just
[1:24:13] like the bride does up to the point of
[1:24:17] the border up to the point of the border
[1:24:21] they believe just like everybody else so
[1:24:25] when you're you're comparing them on
[1:24:28] this side of the Holy Ghost or this side
[1:24:33] of the promised land you can't tell the
[1:24:37] difference they believe in Jesus Christ
[1:24:41] they believe in going to church they
[1:24:42] believe in paying their ties they they
[1:24:43] believe in so many things that you
[1:24:45] believe in but they stopped at the
[1:24:53] border all the way up to the border they
[1:25:00] believe just as much as the complete
[1:25:02] full gospel believer believes you can't
[1:25:05] tell them apart until they get to the
[1:25:07] border now there are certain believers
[1:25:10] who refuse to cross over into the
[1:25:13] promised land they refuse to cross over
[1:25:15] that border because they visualize
[1:25:19] themselves as a grasshopper now I'm
[1:25:24] talking about their nature the nature
[1:25:27] inside of them is so strong they just
[1:25:31] don't feel they could circum it or
[1:25:34] overcome it I should say
[1:25:36] so they visualize themselves as a
[1:25:39] grasshopper unable to overcome their
[1:25:42] flesh they refuse to cross over the line
[1:25:47] of complete surrender that's what the
[1:25:50] line is were you completely surrender
[1:25:53] you remember when when the spies went
[1:25:57] over and they spied out the land 10 of
[1:26:00] those spies said it's a beautiful land
[1:26:03] there's no doubt about God don't lie
[1:26:05] but the other side of their mouth said
[1:26:08] we can't do it unless God goes and does
[1:26:13] it for us like he did Egypt we can't do
[1:26:15] it and God didn't say he was gonna do it
[1:26:21] for him he's gonna take he's gonna get
[1:26:23] the Giants out of there we they had to
[1:26:28] do it they had to do it by faith walking
[1:26:31] in that God was going to be with them
[1:26:34] but they viewed their enemy as a so big
[1:26:40] of a problem that they visualize that
[1:26:46] they themselves look like a grasshopper
[1:26:47] in the sight of a big person and so they
[1:26:53] were scared they were afraid they were
[1:26:56] afraid to go over the border because
[1:27:00] once they crossed over and they said
[1:27:03] let's go let's go after them they knew
[1:27:06] it was gimme death or give me liberty
[1:27:11] they knew they knew that was it there
[1:27:14] was there was no coming back either you
[1:27:17] overcame or they overcame you and they
[1:27:22] were afraid they didn't want to make
[1:27:24] that decision they didn't want to go
[1:27:26] over there and take a chance of being
[1:27:28] slaughtered and so they wanted to serve
[1:27:31] God on this side of self-denial of self
[1:27:35] surrender a self crucifixion they did
[1:27:38] not want to surrender their life to go
[1:27:40] take the lamb of course Joshua and Caleb
[1:27:43] they were of another spirit that totally
[1:27:48] sold out to God they surrendered to God
[1:27:51] they believed that God in them was more
[1:27:54] than able to take the land and when you
[1:27:57] believe that God in you is more than
[1:27:59] able to take care of the the flesh that
[1:28:04] you're dealing with you can run with
[1:28:07] confidence you know you're not one that
[1:28:10] beateth the air you're not just playing
[1:28:13] but you mean business
[1:28:16] and there is the difference between the
[1:28:22] bride and the church the bride goes over
[1:28:26] the border they they that that that
[1:28:31] lying that border line is they totally
[1:28:33] surrender everything to God they
[1:28:36] surrender everything to God
[1:28:38] they're there they given up their life
[1:28:41] they're not scared anymore
[1:28:42] they they've already died they died to
[1:28:45] their will so they have sought
[1:28:47] confidence now that God inside of them
[1:28:50] is going to take him through and what's
[1:28:52] on the other side of the promised land
[1:28:56] Galatians 5:22 love joy peace
[1:29:03] longsuffering gentleness meekness
[1:29:06] temperance faith against such there is
[1:29:11] no law
[1:29:12] that's what awaits the believer and I'll
[1:29:17] tell you when you got the love of God in
[1:29:18] your heart I mean it's the love of God
[1:29:20] it's no longer the John Martin love but
[1:29:23] it's truly the love of God when that
[1:29:25] love is shed abroad in your heart by the
[1:29:27] Holy Ghost I don't care how many times
[1:29:30] they slap your face I don't care what
[1:29:32] they do to you I don't care how much
[1:29:34] they use you something inside of you is
[1:29:38] so full of love that you would give it
[1:29:42] out again and give it out again and give
[1:29:44] it out again the joy is inside of you no
[1:29:48] matter what you go through
[1:29:49] you got peace not as the world giveth
[1:29:51] but everything's gonna be just right
[1:29:53] just get it just right okay settle down
[1:29:56] okay okay okay ah peace know the peace
[1:30:02] we're talking about is just a storm
[1:30:03] everywhere but something inside that's
[1:30:06] the Holy Ghost
[1:30:07] that's the promised land that's a fruit
[1:30:10] that's a fruit that's part of the
[1:30:13] flowing with milk and honey part so as
[1:30:19] we get into this study more we're gonna
[1:30:23] kind of fine-tune that line a little bit
[1:30:27] better so we can see I don't want
[1:30:30] seyton lying to anybody which he will
[1:30:32] but i want to uncover those lies and let
[1:30:36] the bride to see where we need to be
[1:30:40] what we need to do so we can be ready
[1:30:44] when he comes that's my goal that's my
[1:30:48] desire that's that's all my my heart
[1:30:50] amen
[1:30:53] now I'm just gonna be just a few few
[1:31:01] minutes if I could our goal is to be
[1:31:05] ready to cross over to the promised land
[1:31:08] to fight the good fight of faith to to
[1:31:10] lay hold of eternal life to take the
[1:31:12] kingdom by force and the only way to be
[1:31:15] ready is to allow the Lord to set over
[1:31:18] you to set over your household as he
[1:31:22] said in verse 45 of our opening
[1:31:25] scripture therefore be also ready for in
[1:31:28] such an hour she think not the Son of
[1:31:30] man cometh who is then a faithful and
[1:31:32] wise servant whom his Lord have made him
[1:31:36] who made ruler over his household to
[1:31:39] give him me due season when you allow
[1:31:42] the Lord to rule your house that's how
[1:31:48] you know you'll be ready
[1:31:50] that's a faithful and a wise servant
[1:31:54] Amen all right think on that I'm gonna
[1:31:58] give you this last quote for tonight and
[1:32:02] then we're gonna close in prayer this is
[1:32:06] taken from a questions and answers and
[1:32:12] the question is asked after the bride is
[1:32:16] raptured will any of the foolish virgin
[1:32:20] be saved or will they be lost
[1:32:27] brother Branham says no with an
[1:32:30] exclamation point there will be in other
[1:32:34] words no foolish virgins save but we're
[1:32:37] gonna try to right neither bind that as
[1:32:43] we read this but let me read the quote
[1:32:45] no see everything will be finished
[1:32:47] for the Gentile church when the bride is
[1:32:50] taken from the earth the Spirit of God
[1:32:52] leaves the earth he that's Phil his
[1:32:54] filthy still he that's righteous is
[1:32:56] righteous still he that's holy is holy
[1:32:58] still in other words the sanctuary
[1:33:00] becomes smoky where the attorney stands
[1:33:03] to plead the case Christ leaves the
[1:33:07] sanctuary his day of mediate a mediator
[1:33:11] is over the rapture comes he leaves from
[1:33:16] the sanctuary goes forth and takes the
[1:33:19] book of Redemption and claims everything
[1:33:21] he's redeemed there's no more mediator
[1:33:25] work
[1:33:27] how many understands that I've got that
[1:33:31] I'm one of the seals yes the seals I
[1:33:34] believe that Christ comes forth to claim
[1:33:37] his mediator work now just a minute he
[1:33:42] goes back to the question will the
[1:33:45] foolish virgin be saved again he says no
[1:33:49] whatever happens happens now now I want
[1:33:56] you understand this if a person is saved
[1:34:03] he saved before the rapture whether he's
[1:34:05] Church or whether he's bride but the man
[1:34:09] said they will be coming to church after
[1:34:11] the rapture
[1:34:12] coming up the alter thinking they're
[1:34:13] getting saved but they won't be able to
[1:34:15] so when brother Branham answers this
[1:34:18] question with the foolish virgin with
[1:34:20] her beanie for the Virgin save he's
[1:34:22] referring to will there be he's
[1:34:24] answering no meaning that all salvation
[1:34:28] to the Gentiles was done prior he's not
[1:34:31] saying that those that were foolish
[1:34:34] version will not be saved
[1:34:38] now listen know whatever happens
[1:34:41] happens after that she's in the state
[1:34:44] now she will have to go through
[1:34:47] tribulation period and the reason of it
[1:34:51] is now catch this is because she has
[1:34:53] rejected the atonement in its fullness
[1:34:57] she's a believer a professed believer
[1:35:00] but she'll have to go through the
[1:35:02] tribulation period now when I heard this
[1:35:05] statement a couple months ago the reason
[1:35:12] that she doesn't go on the rapture is
[1:35:14] because she didn't she rejected the
[1:35:16] atonement the fullness I got to thinking
[1:35:19] about that Calvary was where our Tolman
[1:35:24] was made Jesus gave himself and if you
[1:35:29] if you believe it with your heart you
[1:35:31] confess it the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:35:33] washes you and you're saved but there's
[1:35:39] more that is required of every person if
[1:35:42] that's all you do is do that you won't
[1:35:48] make it to bride because you're still
[1:35:52] rejecting part of the atonement the
[1:35:57] atonement the full atonement is for the
[1:36:02] bride
[1:36:03] if you come short of the full atonement
[1:36:07] if you reject the full atonement then
[1:36:11] how can you be ready to make a rapture I
[1:36:14] just want you to I want to end with that
[1:36:18] I want you to ponder these thoughts
[1:36:20] because when I read this every believer
[1:36:25] that accept Jesus Christ as their Savior
[1:36:27] to me has accepted the toment right the
[1:36:30] blood but there's more to it than that
[1:36:34] there's more to it to that and that's
[1:36:36] kind of what we want to get into in this
[1:36:38] series amen if you would maybe you just
[1:36:42] pray together and just ask God to help
[1:36:47] us as we study these things and and and
[1:36:51] and and leave from your heavenly Father
[1:36:53] we want to thank you
[1:36:56] for you in her lives and we want to
[1:37:01] thank you for the Holy Spirit that has
[1:37:03] promised to lead us and to guide us into
[1:37:05] all truth we thank you for sending a
[1:37:09] messenger in this age to help us all bow
[1:37:14] to see clearly where would we be Lord
[1:37:20] you said unless I come and smite the
[1:37:23] earth with a curse God but you sent a
[1:37:27] prophet to help get your bride ready
[1:37:33] let's see that lies in their Lord as
[1:37:38] much as i and i trust others feel this
[1:37:43] way same way that I'm your bride
[1:37:46] I feel Lord that there's things needing
[1:37:51] in my life to be ready I believe that's
[1:37:57] why you've you've brought us deeper into
[1:38:01] this this subject maybe not taking it so
[1:38:05] much an evangelistic away too but more
[1:38:13] in a teaching way too to help us see
[1:38:17] that we're in a rapture every single day
[1:38:21] Lord as we go through this study in the
[1:38:25] series what if it would be your will if
[1:38:28] we'd continue lord I just ask that you
[1:38:30] would quicken these things to us make
[1:38:34] them real to us give us revelation of
[1:38:37] them help us to receive the fullness of
[1:38:41] what you have offered we don't want to
[1:38:43] leave anything behind we don't want to
[1:38:47] leave part of the Tollman behind we want
[1:38:50] to accept it not reject it not just take
[1:38:54] the part that saves us but we want to
[1:38:56] take the part that makes you Lord of our
[1:38:58] life for thou art worthy we'll recommit
[1:39:04] ourselves into your hands now take all
[1:39:08] of
