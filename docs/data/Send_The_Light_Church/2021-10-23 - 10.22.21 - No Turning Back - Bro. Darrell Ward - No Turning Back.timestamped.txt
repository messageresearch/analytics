[29:05] it's such a
[29:07] time that we're living in and time of
[29:09] such uncertainty and
[29:11] the lawlessness that's in our nation the
[29:13] things that are happening that
[29:15] i'm i'm 62 year old and see things
[29:18] happening that
[29:19] i've never seen happen in my lifetime
[29:21] and yet it doesn't take us by surprise
[29:24] because we know
[29:27] that the bible and the message of the
[29:29] hour told us it would be that way amen
[29:32] so we see that as that's happening
[29:34] because he said it would and we know the
[29:36] other part of it's happening that during
[29:38] this time of darkness there would be
[29:40] light yes sir i'm so grateful that we
[29:42] know
[29:43] uh i was telling my wife the other day
[29:45] we were talking and i said you know i i
[29:47] don't
[29:48] think we really realize or really see
[29:51] how dark it is because we see light and
[29:54] the folks around us are just staggering
[29:57] in darkness and gross darkness upon the
[29:59] people and the insanity and what a
[30:01] privilege it is that we can gather here
[30:03] this evening in his name
[30:05] such a lovely place that he's given to
[30:07] worship and knowing that the what we're
[30:09] feasting on will not make us an
[30:11] organization nor will he make us a
[30:13] denomination but it will make us his
[30:15] body on the earth amen making himself
[30:17] the same yesterday today and forever
[30:20] i'm so glad that our our god still heals
[30:24] still moves among his people still
[30:26] giving the holy ghost
[30:28] still casting out devils that's right
[30:30] amen still call the people to himself
[30:32] and we're just kind of such an honor to
[30:34] be here this weekend and appreciate
[30:36] brother john inviting us and certainly
[30:38] been in a trial in the last year or so i
[30:40] know folks all around the world has been
[30:42] affected and yet we're still pressing on
[30:45] for the kingdom of god
[30:47] and so we've been battling all day on
[30:49] what to preach
[30:52] and brother john said he wanted to have
[30:53] a dedication service on sunday and maybe
[30:56] build up towards that and so he's just
[30:58] trying to get the mind of god of what
[30:59] direction to go for the services
[31:03] and so we're still struggling
[31:06] amen but yet we know god knows all
[31:08] things yes
[31:10] so let's just bow our heads for a word
[31:12] of prayer
[31:16] heavenly father

[31:22] to gather here in your name

[34:34] i want to speak to you for just a few
[34:36] minutes on no turning back
[34:40] no
[34:40] turning back the prophet of god said
[34:43] this he said now job was a man that
[34:44] carried out god's commandment to the
[34:46] letter exactly
[34:48] and satan knew that
[34:50] but he said if you'll just let me have
[34:52] him i'll make him curse you to your face
[34:56] so god told him he said now he's in your
[34:59] hands but don't you take his life
[35:03] now do you know why satan couldn't take
[35:05] job's life
[35:06] because god said so
[35:08] amen god said so he said you do with him
[35:10] whatever you will but do not take his
[35:13] life that gives us confidence this
[35:16] evening that no matter what satan tries
[35:18] to do to us he cannot take us off this
[35:21] earth until our daddy says so
[35:24] amen then my life is in control of my
[35:26] father amen
[35:28] amen no i'm not going to step out in
[35:30] front of a tractor and trailer and see
[35:31] if it's my time or not but if i
[35:33] accidentally fall in front of one if
[35:35] it's not my time i ain't going nowhere
[35:37] because we know that satan can only do
[35:40] to us what god will allow him to do can
[35:42] you say amen to that
[35:44] so god told him he said no he's in your
[35:45] hands but don't you take his life and
[35:48] satan even stretched that as far as he
[35:50] could on that he took every friend and
[35:53] everything he had almost his complete
[35:55] life but he couldn't take his life but
[35:59] job still helped right oc there was no
[36:03] turning back you see when a man or
[36:06] person has once ever really come into
[36:08] contact with god with that genuine
[36:11] revealed faith that god is
[36:13] not was not will be but is now a present
[36:17] it's god amen there is nothing no time
[36:20] nowhere to ever separate that man from
[36:24] his god i believe it was paul said
[36:26] there's no strife there's no hunger
[36:28] there's no perils there are living
[36:30] creatures or death or anything that can
[36:32] separate us from the love of god which
[36:35] is in christ jesus you are securely
[36:38] anchored in him amen
[36:42] you are securely anchored in him because
[36:45] you were ordained to
[36:47] that life yes sir amen friends we are
[36:50] not here by accident we didn't stumble
[36:53] into this thing but god ordained us for
[36:56] such a time as this yes
[36:59] god never put us here to fail god never
[37:01] put us here to stumble god never put us
[37:03] here to fight among one another but god
[37:06] placed us here to be a vessel that he
[37:08] can manifest his word through in the
[37:10] evening time that this generation will
[37:13] be without excuse
[37:16] amen you're here because you are
[37:18] ordained to
[37:20] that life amen
[37:23] hallelujah we are not here by chance we
[37:26] were born for a purpose
[37:29] amen amen i believe there are people
[37:32] sitting here tonight that was placed
[37:34] here on the earth to tear satan's
[37:37] kingdom down
[37:40] amen you know why i'm here tonight god
[37:42] ordained amen
[37:45] you know what you're here tonight god
[37:46] ordained amen but for the foundation of
[37:49] the world
[37:50] god knew every thought you would ever
[37:52] have
[37:54] he knew you would send her to like the
[37:56] color of your eyes the color of your
[37:58] hair where you would sit what you would
[38:00] think while you were sitting here that's
[38:02] the god i serve today
[38:04] amen he has not lost control this
[38:07] pandemic did not catch him by surprise
[38:10] anything that happens to us it's for our
[38:13] good amen
[38:14] amen amen
[38:16] oh my well they say well they'll never
[38:18] melt another bunch of brandon amounts
[38:20] they're a cult but i want you to know
[38:22] you can not fail
[38:26] amen we can fail no more than god can
[38:28] fail right now amen job stayed with the
[38:31] word because he knew the word would not
[38:34] fail and nothing can keep god's word
[38:38] from accomplishing what it was set to do
[38:41] amen amen god's purpose can never be
[38:45] defeated
[38:46] there is nothing that can defeat it amen
[38:49] so how happy we ought to be
[38:54] resting upon the beautiful revelation of
[38:57] the word of the living god that there's
[38:59] neither things present nor things that
[39:01] can come there's no sickness no sorrow
[39:05] no death no perils nor nothing can
[39:07] separate us from the purpose of the
[39:09] living god what god has imagined in his
[39:12] mind what god has purposed in his heart
[39:14] to bring the past there is no demon
[39:17] there is no power there is nothing that
[39:20] can ever separate god's immortal
[39:23] eternal plan it must be as god hath said
[39:30] oh hallelujah
[39:32] amen we know there's going to be a bride
[39:35] there's going to be a waiting supper
[39:36] served in the sky just as sure as
[39:38] there's a god
[39:41] how can you say that because his word
[39:44] says that
[39:45] and my word will not return unto me for
[39:47] it
[39:48] amen we know that those that's going to
[39:50] be in that wedding supper those that's
[39:51] going to make up that bride
[39:54] they're going to appear before him
[39:55] without spot or blemish
[39:59] how can you say that because god has
[40:02] ordained that

[41:20] temple
[41:21] saint john i believe it is
[41:23] when he stood up to read and the priest
[41:25] said it in the book and he turned over
[41:27] to isaiah said he hath anointed me and
[41:30] he closed the book and said this thing
[41:32] this scripture is fulfilled he went into
[41:35] the temple he found the place he was
[41:37] read concerning himself
[41:40] and he read from isaiah and he said this
[41:42] day the words of the prophet has been
[41:45] made flesh and stands among you

[41:51] interpretation he closed the book and

[41:58] the opening of the word to bring forth
[42:00] the revelation of who we are
[42:04] jesus had perfect faith because he knew
[42:06] who he was in the word amen and the word
[42:09] has been given to us to produce a faith
[42:11] in us that death will strike away from
[42:13] us
[42:20] years ago
[42:22] sister down south carolina wrote a song
[42:25] take a stronger
[42:26] wind than this
[42:28] it goes something like this strong winds
[42:31] are blowing with an unrelented force
[42:34] people running to and fro they don't
[42:36] know what's going on
[42:38] men's hearts are failing there's turmoil
[42:40] in the land church doors are closing
[42:43] preachers just can't take a stand but
[42:45] it's going to take a stronger wind than
[42:47] this to keep me from my promises it's
[42:51] going to take a stronger wind than this
[42:53] to turn me around it's going to take a
[42:55] stronger wind than this to keep this
[42:58] eagle down i would hallelujah i was born
[43:02] for the heavens amen
[43:04] you see the the church can only operate
[43:07] under the anointing that's been released
[43:09] for her to operate under
[43:13] the four living creatures the first
[43:14] three creatures were earth-bound
[43:16] creatures but the fourth living creature
[43:19] is the flying eagle
[43:21] and that anointing of the eagle
[43:23] anointing moves upon the people what
[43:25] does it allow us to do to leave the
[43:27] earth amen
[43:30] there is an anointing upon the bride to
[43:32] change our bodies amen
[43:35] oh hallelujah i just thought i was tired
[43:38] i feel good
[43:41] amen
[43:42] no turning back oh fear is go you see
[43:46] when you see who you are in the word it
[43:48] takes away all fear
[43:51] perfect love cast out all fear
[43:55] amen
[43:56] jesus when he was here he constantly
[43:58] told us
[43:59] fear not
[44:01] fear not
[44:02] even when jairus got the worst report
[44:04] that a man could ever get
[44:06] because i've heard it said so many times
[44:08] at funerals when a mother and a father
[44:10] buries her child
[44:12] and i've heard him say no parents should
[44:14] ever have to bury their children and
[44:16] jairus got probably the worst news that
[44:19] a parent could ever get trouble not the
[44:21] master anymore your little girl is dead
[44:26] but what did jesus tell him when the air
[44:28] went out of him when it seemed like all
[44:30] hope he did all that he could do broke
[44:33] every barrier to get to jesus and when
[44:35] he finally got to him and jesus said
[44:37] i'll go with you then came the news
[44:40] she's dead
[44:42] but jesus he touched him on the shoulder
[44:45] what did he say to him
[44:47] fear not
[44:57] he constantly gave us fear not i am he
[45:00] that was dead and i'm alive
[45:02] forevermore amen
[45:05] hallelujah
[45:06] amen i'm with thee always i'm with you
[45:09] always even to the end of the world the
[45:12] prophet of god said to calvary there
[45:14] that day he died alone he died
[45:17] friendless the heavens forsook him the
[45:19] moon forsaken the stars forsook him god
[45:22] forsook and his disciples pursued him
[45:24] everything forsook him and he died at
[45:26] calvary alone forsaken by man and god so
[45:30] that he could give us a promise in his
[45:32] word that i'll never leave thee nor will
[45:34] i forsake thee
[45:36] hallelujah fear not for i am with you
[45:39] even to the ends of the world
[45:42] amen
[45:43] oh hallelujah
[45:46] hallelujah the prophet god said he loves
[45:48] his disciples
[45:51] he loved sunsets he loved to walk on the
[45:53] shores of galilee and watch the sun set
[45:56] there
[45:57] he loved life
[45:59] god gave him life like god gave you life
[46:02] amen amen
[46:04] you love to sit around the campfire with
[46:05] the disciples say peter tell us a good
[46:08] fishing story who don't like a good
[46:09] fishing story give me a good fishing
[46:11] story peter sit around and laugh and
[46:13] looking upon his disciples he loved them
[46:16] but he realized brother george the only
[46:18] way they could ever live he would have
[46:21] to die right amen
[46:25] amen hallelujah and that's why on that
[46:28] resurrection morning when he rose
[46:31] he said fear not i have me that was dead
[46:34] but i'm alive forevermore and because i
[46:38] live
[46:39] you shall live also
[46:46] and yet people christians sit back
[46:48] and keep thinking oh my i just wonder i
[46:51] just wonder oh the prophet said oh my
[46:54] just turn loose
[46:56] get all things away from you
[46:58] anything that's negative get it away
[47:00] from you any doubt any fear move it away
[47:04] from you don't focus
[47:06] don't focus on the storm don't focus on
[47:09] the clouds focus on the sun amen
[47:15] amen
[47:16] amen what's your eyes on
[47:19] what are you looking on
[47:22] amen
[47:24] amen what's your eyes seeing
[47:27] look at peter
[47:29] as we preached this that brother jess
[47:30] last week look at peter
[47:34] he saw the lord come walking on the
[47:36] water in a storm with 20 foot waves and
[47:38] the sails tore and the oars broke and
[47:41] the boat was filling with water what a
[47:43] probably a category 5 hurricane
[47:45] something like that a great storm
[47:47] and here come jesus walking on the water
[47:50] and peter said lord if it's you bid me
[47:52] to come and know what jesus said come
[47:57] amen and that was just as much the word
[47:59] of god as let there be light
[48:01] [Music]
[48:04] and peter obedient to the word he
[48:06] stepped out of the boat and as long as
[48:08] he looked at jesus the storm the wind
[48:11] the waves had no power over him
[48:15] but when he got his eyes off jesus he
[48:17] started seeking and i say to you don't
[48:20] look at the storm but look to the one
[48:22] who walks on the water amen
[48:28] amen
[48:29] you just need to tell satan
[48:31] people all the time tell well satan said
[48:33] this and the devil told me this and the
[48:35] devil told me that my question is why do
[48:37] you listen to him

[48:57] about the only scripture they know is
[48:59] jesus wept
[49:01] come on somebody that's right
[49:04] but i think it's time we tell satan to
[49:06] shut up and sit down

[49:12] say shut up we'll tell him to be quiet
[49:16] but tell him something

[51:05] amen
[51:06] that's either true or nature
[51:09] amen
[51:10] if we um if we can act like we act when
[51:12] we're on the mountain when you're in the
[51:14] valley you'd see things
[51:17] but some people you can tell what kind
[51:18] of week they had as soon as they come
[51:20] through the door of the church
[51:23] well i know what kind of week they're
[51:24] having
[51:26] but you know i heard years ago i read a
[51:28] book about i think it was a
[51:30] jim brown football player wrote a book i
[51:33] believe it was jim brown called i am
[51:34] third
[51:35] he said my god is first my family is
[51:37] second and i'm third and in this book he
[51:39] told a story about playing football and
[51:41] he said that what he would do when he
[51:43] got there he was a running back and he
[51:44] would go through the line he said if
[51:46] they hit me and rang my bell and almost
[51:49] knocked me unconscious i would get up
[51:51] and walk back like it didn't even hurt
[51:53] and if i went through the line and they
[51:54] never touched me i got up and walked
[51:56] back like it never even hurt he said so
[51:58] that way they would never know that they
[52:01] hurt me because i always got it the same
[52:03] way and i thought oh god that's the way
[52:05] we need to be with satan if satan gives
[52:07] you a punch and knocks you play into the
[52:09] second row you need to get up and say
[52:11] that didn't even worse
[52:16] amen hallelujah all things work for the
[52:20] good to them that love him hallelujah no
[52:23] turning back
[52:26] amen
[52:27] i think of paul and silas
[52:30] preaching the gospel they was wrecking
[52:32] havoc on the devil
[52:34] they were ripping up his kingdom tearing
[52:36] up his carpet
[52:38] messing up his weak and the devil got
[52:40] mad
[52:43] he got mad
[52:47] and had him thrown into prison
[52:49] but not just in the prison back there
[52:51] where the big rats are the inner parts
[52:54] of the prison chained to the floor
[52:56] thoughts that i was beaten i think it
[52:57] was 39 stripes three different times
[53:00] gave you one stripe less than 40.
[53:03] because it said 40 shots will kill a man
[53:04] is what i heard one time
[53:06] so three times he was striped can you
[53:08] imagine the scars on his back
[53:11] and what were they there for not robbing
[53:14] a bank not stealing somebody's wife
[53:18] not for not wearing a mask
[53:24] they were there
[53:25] for preaching the gospel that's right
[53:27] amen
[53:30] and actually in my mind
[53:34] silas you know they had them there and
[53:35] chained them to the floor probably drug
[53:37] them in before they beat them
[53:38] unconsciously silas comes to himself and
[53:41] the world starts lightening up around
[53:43] him he feels the wounds in his back
[53:46] the soreness of the muscles
[53:48] he tries to get himself up and not
[53:51] exactly knowing where he's at the last
[53:52] thing you remember is paul you go so he
[53:54] just cries out paul
[53:58] paul over the next cell hears his name
[54:02] maybe just starts coming to himself and
[54:04] he pushes himself up against the bars he
[54:06] said i'm over here silas
[54:19] i thought he's going to kill us
[54:21] i didn't think that's ever gonna start
[54:23] being honest
[54:29] it hurts
[54:36] yeah
[54:37] that'll cool them off
[54:39] that'll shut them up
[54:41] that'll calm them down
[54:43] they'll turn back now they won't be so
[54:45] quick to go out there and testify at
[54:47] work now
[54:50] surely we're cold and hungry and beaten
[54:52] in a prison house
[54:56] i'm sorry
[54:57] i'm bloody amen
[55:00] who's gonna get us out paul
[55:02] what are we gonna do
[55:06] paul might have said something like this
[55:08] it's going to take a greater trial than
[55:10] this
[55:12] give me a seat for christ
[55:17] i'm one of them
[55:19] i'm one of them i'm so glad that i can
[55:22] say i'm one of them
[55:24] are you one of them i'm one of them i'm
[55:26] one of them oh i'm so glad that i can
[55:29] say i'm one of them
[55:36] get up in heaven
[55:38] god
[55:40] looking over the banister of time
[55:43] watching his children amen he just loves
[55:46] to watch
[55:47] his children
[55:48] in fact he's always watching
[55:52] his eyes on the sparrow and i know he
[55:54] watches me amen
[55:57] and i said some worry boy come here come
[55:59] here
[56:00] look right down there yeah all right
[56:02] look
[56:04] where was it
[56:06] what is that
[56:07] god said that's paul
[56:09] and that's silas
[56:11] where was it
[56:13] what are they
[56:14] doing god said look they're cold they're
[56:18] hungry they're bloody they're sore
[56:20] they're beaten and they're chained to
[56:23] the floor
[56:24] in the dark part of the prison
[56:28] where we said my god
[56:31] lord what are they doing down there
[56:33] god said
[56:35] they're having church
[56:36] amen
[56:39] hallelujah thank god for this beautiful
[56:42] place that we can come here and worship
[56:43] but whether we're here or whether we're
[56:45] down there or whether we're in an alley
[56:47] somewhere we can praise our god no
[56:50] matter where we're at whether we're on a
[56:51] mountain or whether i'm in a valley i
[56:54] can still give my god praise for there
[56:57] is no god like not god
[57:02] hallelujah
[57:04] and they began to sing the songs of
[57:06] praise and the bible said at midnight
[57:09] paul and silas prayed and sang praises
[57:12] unto god
[57:13] amen
[57:15] god said listen to that
[57:17] you know there's something about that
[57:18] family harmony like the lafontaine's
[57:20] here singing in a few minutes
[57:22] there's just something about that amen
[57:25] i was telling brother jeff's last week
[57:27] i think it'd be good to repeat it here
[57:28] tonight and uh
[57:30] silas you know being kind of we'll just
[57:32] say it this way maybe it's just kind of
[57:34] whiny you know about where they was at
[57:36] and what was going on he'd probably say
[57:38] tenor
[57:41] and paul being the church age messenger
[57:44] he probably sang lead
[57:48] and god
[57:49] he came down
[57:51] he sang base
[57:59] the earth began to shake the bars began
[58:02] to sway and the chains broke off their
[58:04] head and god said i have come to receive
[58:07] my praise amen and i say to you church
[58:10] no matter where you're at if satan's got
[58:12] you bound up if your back's against the
[58:14] wall don't give up just raise your hand
[58:18] and begin to praise god for the bible
[58:20] says i god inhabits the praise of his
[58:23] people amen when your back's against the
[58:26] wall give him praise when you feel you
[58:28] can't go on just raise your hands and
[58:30] say greater is he that is in me than he
[58:33] that's in the world
[58:36] amen
[58:38] and we can praise our hurt
[58:41] away
[58:42] and we'll just give
[58:44] him
[58:45] praise
[58:48] no turning back no giving up no shutting
[58:51] down we are moving all day man
[58:57] amen
[58:58] we live in one of the
[59:00] greatest nations
[59:02] all the history of the world of course
[59:04] she's in bad shape now but still
[59:06] it's a great place to live
[59:08] i'd rather be here to some of the places
[59:10] i've preached in i'll tell you that
[59:11] right now
[59:13] all right bro george
[59:14] that right bro paul
[59:16] amen hallelujah
[59:19] i was in the philippines one time
[59:21] they took the
[59:23] they took the seat off the commode
[59:27] who would take the seat off
[59:32] and i come out of the bathroom coming
[59:33] down the hall i found the seat
[59:35] they was using it as a picture for me
[59:40] and i thought
[59:42] god's truth i thought you know if i
[59:44] bought them a frame i wonder if they put
[59:45] that seat back on there
[59:49] so thank god for the nation we live in
[59:53] and
[59:54] up to now we've still been able to
[59:56] worship you in spirit and the truth and
[59:58] a freedom of speech
[1:00:00] but the prophet said the first thing you
[1:00:02] know is they'll try to stop all of this
[1:00:06] to take our freedoms from us
[1:00:09] and the prophet says
[1:00:11] it's so
[1:00:15] that's always satan's tactic in the
[1:00:17] garden of the eden he came to eve so
[1:00:21] subtle
[1:00:24] and they asked the survivor of the
[1:00:25] holocaust said how did you allow that to
[1:00:29] happen
[1:00:30] six million of your people
[1:00:33] was put to death
[1:00:34] how could you possibly allow that to
[1:00:38] happen
[1:00:40] you know what he said
[1:00:42] it was so
[1:00:44] subtle
[1:00:47] they changed the law here and then they
[1:00:49] changed the law there and we thought
[1:00:50] well next year they'll forget all about
[1:00:52] it there'll be nothing to it
[1:00:54] and then they changed another one he
[1:00:55] said it was only
[1:00:57] when they started making us wear a
[1:00:59] star to get into a restaurant
[1:01:03] it was only then that we had to wear
[1:01:05] this star to identify who we were
[1:01:08] that we realized
[1:01:11] we was in trouble
[1:01:13] the prophet said they're going to try to
[1:01:15] quit to keep us quit praying from the
[1:01:17] sick
[1:01:18] and to put a ban on it that you can't
[1:01:20] even pray for the sick but just remember
[1:01:23] when persecution rises the church comes
[1:01:26] to its very height then it's always at
[1:01:29] its best
[1:01:31] and let me say saints of god this
[1:01:32] pandemic has struck this nation it's
[1:01:34] made more bright people pray than
[1:01:36] they've ever prayed in their life it's
[1:01:38] brought people closer together when a
[1:01:40] brother would look out for come on
[1:01:42] somebody you've seen it in your church
[1:01:44] we're sitting in our church when satan
[1:01:46] comes in like a flood god raises up a
[1:01:48] standard against it amen and the pride
[1:01:51] of jesus christ is the standard of this
[1:01:53] hour
[1:01:56] but no matter what they do no matter
[1:01:58] what happens remember this god's working
[1:02:01] it all together
[1:02:03] for our good that's
[1:02:06] he said my sheep hear my voice
[1:02:09] and i know them
[1:02:10] and they follow me and i give unto them
[1:02:13] eternal life
[1:02:15] and they shall never
[1:02:17] perish
[1:02:18] that'll make you feel good
[1:02:21] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[1:02:24] my hand
[1:02:25] my father which gave them me
[1:02:29] is greater than all amen and i'd like to
[1:02:32] say amen today
[1:02:37] he's greater than all and no man is able
[1:02:40] to pluck them out of my
[1:02:43] father's head
[1:02:45] there's no wind strong enough there's
[1:02:47] not a devil big enough there's not a
[1:02:49] situation great enough that's able to
[1:02:51] shut this bride down
[1:02:55] we are god's covenant people hallelujah
[1:02:58] hallelujah we're not orphans we're not
[1:03:01] an organization we are a people who's
[1:03:04] been given a covenant by god and god
[1:03:06] gave this covenant he swore by himself
[1:03:09] because there was none greater to swear
[1:03:11] by
[1:03:14] amen
[1:03:16] you are the covenant people of god well
[1:03:18] i probably said i heard this today said
[1:03:20] god poured christ apart of calvary
[1:03:22] making the covenant swearing by himself
[1:03:25] and he took the body up into heaven
[1:03:26] which will return someday but the spirit
[1:03:29] he gave back to lead the church and the
[1:03:32] same life that was in christ jesus is in

[1:06:23] he was just giving some testimonies of
[1:06:25] some of the things i saw god do
[1:06:29] and then brother chris i was up in
[1:06:30] brother sean's meeting
[1:06:31] earlier this year and brother chris came

[1:06:46] as she was given the testimonies so she
[1:06:48] went home took off her blouse to put
[1:06:50] ointment on the tumor said brother daryl
[1:06:53] it was completely gone
[1:06:57] it disappeared during the preaching of
[1:06:59] the word the same god hallelujah that
[1:07:02] was here in the ministry of william
[1:07:04] branham is now here in the ministry of
[1:07:06] the bride

[1:07:13] be a great ministry it's the message of
[1:07:16] the hour it's the ministry of the hour
[1:07:19] it'll be so humble
[1:07:24] well glory
[1:07:25] people always pull back when you say
[1:07:27] that
[1:07:28] it's the truth
[1:07:31] it's the bride's ministry don't you see
[1:07:33] what satan's attacking right now he's
[1:07:35] attacking the fifo ministry
[1:07:40] amen same life
[1:07:43] he just changed his mask oh god was
[1:07:45] important to christ all crisis he's
[1:07:47] poured into the church amen
[1:07:51] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:07:54] but the church is the revelation of
[1:07:56] jesus christ in the hour she's
[1:07:58] manifested on the earth
[1:08:01] when the angel ascended with the book
[1:08:04] and you just said it with the book was
[1:08:05] the book shield no it was open
[1:08:08] when he handed it to john what did john
[1:08:11] get an open book
[1:08:14] and what did john do with the book
[1:08:16] he ate it
[1:08:18] so john and the book became one
[1:08:22] amen
[1:08:24] so if you wanted to know what was in the
[1:08:26] book you had to ask john he ate it
[1:08:35] well let me see this way
[1:08:38] i i like native american music
[1:08:41] i got just a little bit of enemies just
[1:08:43] enough to like it i guess
[1:08:46] but there was a i'm trying to think of
[1:08:48] this guy's name
[1:08:50] he's a award-winning flute player hadn't
[1:08:53] thought about this in years but just
[1:08:54] come to my mind
[1:08:59] he was raised in new jersey
[1:09:02] by a jewish family
[1:09:05] now how does a jew become a native
[1:09:08] american award-winning flute player
[1:09:13] i'll tell you how
[1:09:14] because one day he found out he was
[1:09:16] adopted
[1:09:18] and he wasn't a jew he never was a jew
[1:09:21] he was a sioux
[1:09:23] you can't make this up
[1:09:27] and when he found out he was a sioux
[1:09:30] he went back to his heritage before you
[1:09:33] hear me he went back to his roots
[1:09:36] and he started talking about the sacred
[1:09:38] way the red path
[1:09:41] he started talking native language
[1:09:44] because he was a native but he only
[1:09:47] found that out when the book was opened
[1:09:49] because somebody came to the house one
[1:09:51] day with the book and told him who he
[1:09:54] really was don't you see brother sister
[1:09:57] god has came to us with an open book it
[1:09:59] said you're not methodist you're not
[1:10:01] madness you are my bride
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:05] and when we found out who we were we
[1:10:08] started talking god talk
[1:10:14] amen the prophet said it's written to
[1:10:17] you as sworn by god you cannot fail and
[1:10:22] that makes the devil mad amen
[1:10:26] i like to make the devil mad
[1:10:29] when you realize
[1:10:31] who you are
[1:10:32] then if realizing who you are makes the
[1:10:34] devil mad what do you think he's going
[1:10:35] to try to do
[1:10:37] try to keep you from finding out who you
[1:10:39] are
[1:10:42] amen
[1:10:43] there's no turning back for us
[1:10:46] where will we go
[1:10:47] only you have words of eternal life
[1:10:51] if you get down if you get weary we all
[1:10:53] do
[1:10:54] preachers get weary sometimes i'll be
[1:10:55] honest with you maybe i'm not well i
[1:10:57] know i'm not a great preacher i get
[1:10:59] weary sometimes i get tired
[1:11:03] but if you get down you get weary
[1:11:06] and it seems like everything's coming in
[1:11:08] on you
[1:11:09] do me a favor
[1:11:10] just open the book and go to the back of
[1:11:12] it and if you look in the back of the
[1:11:14] book you know what you find out we win
[1:11:17] amen
[1:11:19] and if you win the war the battle don't
[1:11:22] make no difference i may lose a battle
[1:11:25] now and then but i've already won the
[1:11:27] war
[1:11:32] don't come in here like losers you are
[1:11:34] not losers don't carry yourself like a
[1:11:37] loser i am not a loser i am a winner i
[1:11:41] am what god says i am amen
[1:11:47] shaken is the loser
[1:11:49] he's the one that's going into the lake
[1:11:50] of fire not me
[1:11:52] hell wouldn't create created for me hell
[1:11:54] wasn't created for you it was created
[1:11:56] for him
[1:11:59] he's going down
[1:12:01] we're going up
[1:12:02] amen
[1:12:05] amen
[1:12:07] hallelujah
[1:12:08] do you love him
[1:12:11] amen we're running our last mile home
[1:12:16] hey man

[1:12:21] in the army
[1:12:23] i read cross country
[1:12:27] that's a long time ago
[1:12:32] i was nothing to run 80 miles a week i
[1:12:34] ran the 10k that was my race the 10k 6.2
[1:12:37] mile
[1:12:40] and i was with the 18th airborne court
[1:12:41] at fort bragg north carolina home of the
[1:12:43] 82nd airborne that's where i was
[1:12:44] stationed for four years
[1:12:46] so i ran across the country for my unit
[1:12:50] and my coach was a friend of mine named
[1:12:52] ernest hemingway
[1:12:54] he would this guy could run he was just
[1:12:55] some i've never seen anybody run like
[1:12:57] this guy could run
[1:12:58] so this particular race
[1:13:02] i was tired
[1:13:05] i started kicking too soon and got down
[1:13:07] towards the end i just about spent all
[1:13:09] my gas didn't have much left
[1:13:11] and i was starting to fall back people
[1:13:13] started to pass me and all of a sudden
[1:13:15] out of the woods i heard a voice it
[1:13:18] wasn't supernatural it was hemingway
[1:13:23] he had done won the race
[1:13:26] he'd already won
[1:13:28] and he circled back into the woods and
[1:13:31] he was waiting on me and when he saw me
[1:13:34] he'd begin to yell run one run
[1:13:37] don't quit now just one more hill
[1:13:40] there's a valley and the finish line is
[1:13:42] just ahead don't stop ward run run with
[1:13:45] everything within you and friends we
[1:13:47] don't have hemingway tonight but we've
[1:13:48] got a cloud of great witnesses that's
[1:13:51] telling you to run little bride run with
[1:13:53] everything that's within you we are
[1:13:55] almost old
[1:14:03] hallelujah
[1:14:04] no weapon that's formed against these
[1:14:06] shall prosper and every tongue that
[1:14:08] shall rise against the judgment thou
[1:14:10] shalt condemn this is the heritage of
[1:14:13] the servants of the lord and the
[1:14:14] righteousnesses of me saith the lord
[1:14:17] amen
[1:14:19] hallelujah satan gets to howling the
[1:14:21] prophet said he gets to blow in his
[1:14:24] poison breath
[1:14:25] and the winds begin to get strong
[1:14:27] says remember this eagles were built to
[1:14:30] take strong winds
[1:14:33] the harder the wind the higher eagles
[1:14:36] fly
[1:14:38] the harder the trial the stronger the
[1:14:40] wind the greater we fly
[1:14:45] in the old days do you know how they
[1:14:46] separated the chaff from the wheat
[1:14:49] they would throw it up into the wind
[1:14:52] and the wind would cause the chaff to
[1:14:54] blow away
[1:14:55] and the wheat was heavier it would drop
[1:14:57] back to the ground
[1:14:59] so the wind did two things it separated
[1:15:02] and it gathered
[1:15:05] and the winds of strife is causing a
[1:15:08] great falling away
[1:15:11] it's just blowing away the child but
[1:15:13] what's left
[1:15:21] and the eagle's a special built bird
[1:15:23] he's made up to go into the atmosphere
[1:15:27] he has to have strong wings to get up
[1:15:28] here an ordinary bird a hulk even though
[1:15:30] a hawk is kind to an eagle he cannot fly
[1:15:33] where an eagle flies his genetics won't
[1:15:35] let him a fish can go right to the
[1:15:38] bottom of the lake you know why there's
[1:15:39] a law within him that says he can do it
[1:15:41] right don't you try it without an oxygen
[1:15:43] tank you'll die
[1:15:46] but the fish operates within the law
[1:15:49] that's in him that's given to him by
[1:15:51] genetics and the ego flies higher he
[1:15:54] operates within the law that's in him
[1:15:56] that's made up by his genetics and the
[1:15:58] bride operates by the law of the word
[1:16:03] because her genetics
[1:16:11] anybody done their dna
[1:16:13] did you do yours
[1:16:17] i did mine
[1:16:21] i could go anywhere in the world build
[1:16:22] home
[1:16:27] i'm a hyde's 57 to the max
[1:16:31] i got stuff for me i didn't even know it
[1:16:32] was there
[1:16:34] five percent italian where'd that come
[1:16:36] from
[1:16:38] eight percent southwest asia
[1:16:40] four and a half percent native american
[1:16:43] one percent sub-sahara
[1:16:45] i come from everywhere
[1:16:47] there's no way i can be a racist
[1:16:58] well i said that to say this
[1:17:00] that you get fifty percent
[1:17:03] of your dna
[1:17:05] comes from your mama did you know that
[1:17:07] fifty percent of your dna comes from
[1:17:08] your mama and fifth percent comes from
[1:17:10] your daddy
[1:17:11] and that's why some people look at you
[1:17:13] and see your mama and others look at you
[1:17:15] and see your daddy
[1:17:17] when i was young everybody said i look
[1:17:19] like my mama
[1:17:20] now people tell me i look like my daddy
[1:17:23] my wife tells me i act like him
[1:17:28] that's but that's the natural
[1:17:30] so i got the looking the prophet said
[1:17:32] the natural top stuff
[1:17:34] yes sir so that's my natural dna
[1:17:37] then my spiritual dna 50 of my spiritual
[1:17:40] dna
[1:17:42] comes from my father and 50 comes from
[1:17:44] my mama
[1:17:47] now god is our father is that true
[1:17:49] so 50 of our spiritual genetics comes
[1:17:52] from our daddy and then i found the
[1:17:54] other day when the prophet of god said
[1:17:56] that i was birthed by the breath of god
[1:17:58] and drank from the breast of el shaddai
[1:18:00] so he said so you see god is my mother
[1:18:04] so 50 come from my daddy and 50 come
[1:18:07] from my mama then what does that make
[1:18:09] that that's on the inside of me it's
[1:18:11] just god it's all god amen and god
[1:18:15] operating in his body makes him the same
[1:18:18] yesterday today and forever doing the
[1:18:20] same works he did when he was here
[1:18:25] hallelujah
[1:18:26] amen when you really realize that god
[1:18:28] has revealed to you the truth of the
[1:18:30] thing there's nothing in the world
[1:18:32] that's going to defeat you in it you're
[1:18:34] absolutely undefeatable not you but the
[1:18:37] god that's in you not christ but the
[1:18:39] body but this word that was in him not
[1:18:42] mary but the word that was born from her
[1:18:44] not this this is not the overcomer it's
[1:18:47] the inside of me
[1:18:49] greater she that is in me than he that's
[1:18:51] in the
[1:18:52] world we are built by god to withstand
[1:18:56] the winds amen
[1:18:58] like the three hebrew children
[1:19:00] shadrach meshach of indigo there was a
[1:19:03] mandate given out that everyone would
[1:19:05] bow before the image which was an image
[1:19:07] of daniel the prophet or be burned in
[1:19:09] the fire
[1:19:11] and the three boys said oh king blow all
[1:19:14] the horns you want to blow pluck all the
[1:19:16] guitars you want to block
[1:19:18] yes
[1:19:19] pass all the mandates you want to pass
[1:19:21] we will not bow to the image
[1:19:25] some trusted jareds summon horses but we
[1:19:28] remember the name of the lord our god
[1:19:30] amen my trust is not an organization it
[1:19:33] is not in man but it is in the name of
[1:19:36] my lord for the name of the lord is a
[1:19:38] strong tower that the righteous run into
[1:19:41] and they
[1:19:42] are
[1:19:42] safe
[1:19:44] there is power in the name of jesus
[1:19:48] to break every chain
[1:19:54] so the king said
[1:19:56] all right
[1:19:58] we'll see what's going to happen to
[1:19:58] these boys we'll test that holy ghost
[1:20:01] religion out
[1:20:02] we'll see what it does we'll burn it out
[1:20:05] of them
[1:20:08] it's been tried they've tried to burn it
[1:20:10] out of the media man
[1:20:11] but you can't burn the holy ghost out
[1:20:14] it's fire itself
[1:20:16] hebrews 12 29 says our god is a
[1:20:19] consuming fire and everything satan
[1:20:22] tries to do god's fire consumes it
[1:20:26] amen they tried to pull it out of john
[1:20:28] but they couldn't blow it out of him
[1:20:29] with hot grease you can't pull it out
[1:20:31] you can scare it out you can't turn it
[1:20:34] out you can't run it out you can't stomp
[1:20:36] it out you can't put it out you can blow
[1:20:39] it out you can't mandate it out it's
[1:20:41] there to stay there is no turning back
[1:20:48] heated up the furnace you know the story
[1:20:50] seven times hotter than ever before
[1:20:54] the little king nestor nebuchadnezzar
[1:20:56] out there with this great robes and all
[1:20:58] of his rings and his big grounds
[1:21:01] watch this boys
[1:21:02] we're gonna scream now
[1:21:05] we're gonna watch them recant now we're
[1:21:07] gonna watch them bow now as you begin to
[1:21:10] hey boys you want to change your
[1:21:12] testimony you want to turn back now
[1:21:15] they might have said something like this
[1:21:16] old king it'll take a harder fire than
[1:21:18] this
[1:21:20] there is no turning back
[1:21:23] and in their haste to burn god's people
[1:21:27] they killed their own
[1:21:31] and let me say satan will destroy his
[1:21:34] old kingdom trying to destroy you but he
[1:21:36] will never stop this bride
[1:21:43] the disciples i don't want to see you
[1:21:45] that night when they were having a
[1:21:46] testimony service satan thought they
[1:21:48] were on their own that jesus was not
[1:21:50] around
[1:21:51] oh but he was around
[1:21:54] he said i'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:21:56] you and satan said i'll tell you one
[1:21:58] thing i'll get this bunch right now
[1:22:00] this is my time to get them i've got
[1:22:02] them right where they want them but he
[1:22:04] failed to realize that jesus was just
[1:22:06] sitting up on the mountain
[1:22:08] just watching his disciples testify
[1:22:11] you know prophet god said when you talk
[1:22:12] about jesus he always draws near you
[1:22:14] that's right
[1:22:15] we spent so much time talking about our
[1:22:17] fears and our faults and our failures
[1:22:18] and our weakness we spent that much time
[1:22:20] talking about jesus
[1:22:22] how much closer would he be to us
[1:22:24] sitting out there on the sea where
[1:22:26] george i think of you playing that
[1:22:28] testimony out there on the ship
[1:22:31] testimony on the sea
[1:22:33] satan began to blow
[1:22:34] his poison breath
[1:22:38] and the prophet god said
[1:22:40] the great powerful winds his poison
[1:22:42] breath hits the sea it had a nervous
[1:22:44] prostration and sin from satan will make
[1:22:46] anything have a nervous prostration
[1:22:48] that's the reason we got so many nervous
[1:22:50] breakdowns so the insane institutions
[1:22:52] filled up we've got people running
[1:22:53] through 30 mile an hour zones at 90 mile
[1:22:55] an hour squealing tires burning rubber
[1:22:57] off their tires turning corners go 30
[1:23:00] foot and turn off
[1:23:03] it's a nervous neurotic state
[1:23:07] we're living in a time of phobias yes
[1:23:09] everything's a phobia they got phobias i
[1:23:12] can't even pronounce
[1:23:14] that's the truth islamic phobia
[1:23:16] homophobia people scared of
[1:23:18] lettuce that's look it up it's true
[1:23:21] people scared of lettuce almost have a
[1:23:24] nervous breakdown if lettuce gets nero
[1:23:30] look it up
[1:23:31] you can't make this stuff
[1:23:34] a nervous neurotic state the prophet
[1:23:36] said they don't know what to do
[1:23:40] all the way from the big house down they
[1:23:41] don't know what to do all the world is
[1:23:44] nervous and upset they don't know where
[1:23:45] they're standing they go from one church
[1:23:47] to the other church every little thing
[1:23:49] running here and there and to and fro
[1:23:50] it's because that satan has begun to
[1:23:52] push out his poison breath has begun to
[1:23:54] blow the winds of strife breaking
[1:23:56] churches apart separating brotherhood
[1:23:59] that's always his tactic that's what
[1:24:01] he's always done divide and conquer but
[1:24:04] i say to you brother sister do not let
[1:24:06] him divide us
[1:24:08] [Music]
[1:24:11] they'll try to do it by skin color if
[1:24:13] they don't work they try to do it by
[1:24:14] politics now what are they trying to do
[1:24:16] they're trying to divide between the
[1:24:17] vaccinated and the unvaccinated listen
[1:24:20] if you want to get vaccinated get
[1:24:21] vaccinated if you don't want to get
[1:24:23] vaccinated don't get vaccinated but
[1:24:25] don't divide yourself over something so
[1:24:28] petty
[1:24:30] we are one in the spirit amen do not let
[1:24:33] the devil divide us
[1:24:37] trying to break up brotherhood making
[1:24:39] people think they're a little bit better
[1:24:40] than somebody else that they belong to a
[1:24:42] better bracket that they belong to a
[1:24:44] better church there's only one church
[1:24:47] that's the church of christ
[1:24:49] she stands up on the unfailing word of
[1:24:52] god
[1:24:53] and when the winds got so contrary and
[1:24:55] the waves got so high and the boat was
[1:24:58] over waterlogged and half full of water
[1:25:00] and the oars was breaking and the great
[1:25:02] white caps and the wind blowing and that
[1:25:04] ship being tossed to and fro jesus
[1:25:07] sitting up there watching the whole time
[1:25:08] amen
[1:25:10] no doubt he stood up might have said
[1:25:11] something like this
[1:25:13] the devil
[1:25:14] gonna take a stronger wind than that
[1:25:18] and he stepped out off the mountain
[1:25:20] come walking on the water
[1:25:22] of the
[1:25:24] storm hey man
[1:25:27] there's things happening right now
[1:25:28] friends in this hour sin is uh
[1:25:30] the sin of this age the lawlessness
[1:25:32] that's in our land
[1:25:34] where people drive a car down the street
[1:25:36] one of us busting windows stealing stuff
[1:25:37] putting in the car just walking from
[1:25:39] card car and nobody's doing anything
[1:25:41] about it saw the other day where a woman
[1:25:42] was raped on the subway in new york city
[1:25:44] people stood there and filmed it not one
[1:25:46] person tried to intervene
[1:25:49] a lawless time an evil time a dark time
[1:25:52] but i want the devil to know no matter
[1:25:54] how dark it is it's going to take a
[1:25:56] stronger wind than this to stop this
[1:25:59] bride
[1:26:00] jesus said we're going to the other side
[1:26:02] then where are we going we are going to
[1:26:05] the other side let's not await wave high
[1:26:07] enough there's not a storm big enough to
[1:26:09] stop this bride
[1:26:12] god's word will come to pass my word
[1:26:14] will not return unto me void
[1:26:18] amen he ain't gonna win he ain't got a
[1:26:20] plague he ain't got a story he got a
[1:26:22] fire he got a trial that'll stop this
[1:26:27] for upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:26:30] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:26:32] against it but we shall prevail over
[1:26:36] them amen
[1:26:38] amen
[1:26:39] amen
[1:26:41] hallelujah satan hates revelation but we
[1:26:44] love it with true revelation in our
[1:26:47] lives the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:26:49] against us but we will prevail over
[1:26:53] them
[1:26:55] satan does all he can to destroy
[1:26:57] confidence
[1:26:59] in the word
[1:27:00] if he can get you to lay your word down
[1:27:04] he's defeated you
[1:27:05] brother brennan said don't lay your
[1:27:08] weapon down
[1:27:11] if he can get you to think that your
[1:27:12] words not good enough always good enough
[1:27:14] for brother branham's day but not good
[1:27:15] enough for our day
[1:27:17] the same anointing that anointed the
[1:27:18] prophet is anointing the bridegroom
[1:27:20] there's only one holy ghost he might
[1:27:22] have had it in a greater measure but
[1:27:23] you've got the same holy ghost
[1:27:26] amen
[1:27:27] but when the church dis oh i love this
[1:27:29] quote right here when the church
[1:27:31] disbelieves satan and believes the
[1:27:34] spirit's revelation of the word
[1:27:37] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:27:41] her
[1:27:42] not him
[1:27:43] her
[1:27:45] god told moses when you bring the people
[1:27:47] out they shall worship me upon this
[1:27:50] mountain israel had to come that way
[1:27:52] there's no need to try to stop him
[1:27:53] friends
[1:27:54] god's done promised him you're going to
[1:27:56] go over there you're going to worship me
[1:27:58] on
[1:27:58] this mountain
[1:28:00] red sea
[1:28:02] barren land bitter waters nothing would
[1:28:05] stop them from going
[1:28:07] to the mountain
[1:28:09] for god said so
[1:28:11] they moved on just the same no turning
[1:28:15] back
[1:28:17] she's moving on friends
[1:28:19] but we are never
[1:28:20] alone
[1:28:23] the problem is the bible says let your
[1:28:24] conversation be without covenants and be
[1:28:26] content in such things as you have for
[1:28:28] he hath said i will never leave thee nor
[1:28:30] will i forsake thee jesus christ god's
[1:28:33] son who's the architect of the church he
[1:28:35] built his church upon the word of god
[1:28:37] it's written
[1:28:38] it's written
[1:28:39] it's written he built the church upon
[1:28:42] the word of god our blueprints is
[1:28:45] spirit-given
[1:28:47] amen and the bible says in psalms as
[1:28:50] we're coming down to a close
[1:28:52] the bible says whether shall i go from
[1:28:54] thy spirit or whether shall i free from
[1:28:55] thy presence
[1:28:57] thou art there if i ascend into heaven
[1:28:59] thou art to her if i make my bed in hell
[1:29:02] behold thou art there if i take up the
[1:29:04] wings of a morning and dwell in the
[1:29:05] other most parts of the sea thou art
[1:29:07] there even there shall thy hand lead me
[1:29:10] and thy right hand shall hold me up yes
[1:29:15] oh friends aren't you glad
[1:29:17] daddy's got a hold of your hand
[1:29:19] amen amen
[1:29:22] a few years ago my youngest daughter ali
[1:29:23] was up at rough ridge over north
[1:29:25] carolina
[1:29:26] and we was coming back and the clouds
[1:29:27] always come down it's real high you can
[1:29:29] see everywhere when you get up there and
[1:29:30] the clouds are always on the mountain so
[1:29:31] the rocks are always wet and we was
[1:29:33] coming back we've been up to the top we
[1:29:34] was making our way back down and i was
[1:29:36] leaning away and it's like a rock like
[1:29:37] this and i stepped off the rock down and
[1:29:39] i heard coming behind me was was alley
[1:29:42] and just as i stepped down she was about
[1:29:43] right here and i just turned around and
[1:29:45] saw her and i don't even know why i've
[1:29:47] done it but i just reached around and
[1:29:49] took her hand like this and i know
[1:29:50] sooner i got a hold of ali's hand that
[1:29:52] her feet went out from under her and
[1:29:54] when her feet went out from under her
[1:29:55] this look of horror would have went
[1:29:57] virtual on youtube i mean it was just
[1:29:59] all over her face the fear and the scare
[1:30:02] because her feet went out from under her
[1:30:04] and i just took her like this swung her
[1:30:05] out of down and sat her right down in
[1:30:07] front of me
[1:30:08] and all that fear turned to the biggest
[1:30:10] because she's only about six year old
[1:30:12] but all that fear turned to the biggest
[1:30:14] smile you have ever seen in your life
[1:30:16] and i said ain't you glad daddy had a
[1:30:17] hold of your hand she goes
[1:30:19] and down through the trails she went the
[1:30:21] saints of god in this dark slippery age
[1:30:23] of laodicea aren't you glad this evening
[1:30:26] that daddy has got a hold of our head
[1:30:29] when i'm on the mountain though right
[1:30:31] there when i'm in the valley the heart
[1:30:32] there in the good times thou art there

[1:30:36] my joy thou art there in my sorrow down
[1:30:39] right there in my despair there are
[1:30:40] there when i feel lonely thou art
[1:30:43] through
[1:30:45] yea though i walk through the valley of
[1:30:47] the shadow of death i will fear no evil
[1:30:50] amen for thou art with me
[1:30:55] you're never alone
[1:30:58] he's right here with us
[1:31:00] now
[1:31:03] the stabilizers have been put on the
[1:31:04] ship great fearful waves are out there
[1:31:06] before us but we know just beyond the
[1:31:08] waveguard that we're nearing the shore

[1:31:43] out again amen
[1:31:48] amen
[1:31:50] amen i heard the prophet of god say
[1:31:52] today the story about the insurance when

[1:32:02] assurance and then he said the second
[1:32:04] time i said assurance said he called he
[1:32:06] said he said well billy said that's fine
[1:32:08] billy said that that won't put you out
