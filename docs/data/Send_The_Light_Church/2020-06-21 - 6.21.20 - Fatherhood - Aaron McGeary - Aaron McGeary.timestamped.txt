[26:25] happy Father's Day to the mothers who
[26:28] had to be fathers when the fathers were
[26:29] wrong because even though it's not our
[26:33] major role I do believe the Lord has
[26:35] taught us to fill the gap we need to as
[26:41] you probably have noticed by now we're
[26:45] not ministering today you're probably
[26:49] wondering why I didn't tell you I did
[26:54] tell you because I did not know how can
[26:58] I tell you so you can't live higher than
[26:59] your pastor so I came down the stairs
[27:08] and alia was sitting in the chair and I
[27:12] just about lost it didn't know that our
[27:18] precious daughter and her family our
[27:20] precious brother Aaron and his family
[27:23] they kind of joined together I had this
[27:25] beautiful family and what a wonderful
[27:30] surprise

[27:36] be together as a family I didn't even
[27:39] ask for their arrington minister for a
[27:41] couple days after he was here and so
[27:44] we're just honored to have the ministry
[27:47] that God is given and gifted brother
[27:53] Aaron McGarry with honestly wish we
[27:58] could have him here all the time is how
[28:00] much I have respect Chris ministry and
[28:03] the revelation that God has given him
[28:06] and
[28:07] continues to grow and we've been blessed
[28:10] we've been blessed and we're gonna just
[28:13] leave the rest up to him if he wants to
[28:16] share but God is gonna use whatever gift
[28:20] that you present back to him yeah and
[28:26] but before we introduced brother Aaron
[28:30] we don't get to have sister Elizabeth
[28:32] much our sister a lot Lisa and we're

[29:23] reminds me of my dad when I listen to
[29:26] these words
[29:27] [Music]
[29:36] Satan stands before you
[29:41] accusing me of sin pressure is unceasing
[29:48] Lord

[34:14] faith for those that we speak to and all
[34:20] won't come but some will they're not
[34:24] gonna come without our faith amen amen
[34:27] we certainly appreciate that song and
[34:32] appreciate the life that sister
[34:38] Elizabeth has given back to God now God
[34:42] has given us all life it's our choice we
[34:43] either give it back to him or keep it
[34:46] for ourselves and what an honor it is to
[34:49] give our life back to the Lord and then
[34:52] it can spread you see it spreading in

[35:20] places and to strengthen us in the power
[35:24] of his might amen let's get behind the
[35:26] word as brother Aaron comes to give us
[35:29] the wonderful words of life
[35:32] amen amen that saying only believes our
[35:35] brother comes
[35:37] Oh baby
[35:44] Oh
[35:47] [Music]
[35:48] Oh
[35:52] [Music]
[36:06] all things are possible
[36:10] Oh baby
[36:15] a man praise the Lord while you're
[36:19] standing if you could turn your Bibles
[36:20] to Matthew chapter 3 I'll be reading
[36:24] from Matthew chapter 3 and then also
[36:26] from Matthew chapter 17 I'm happy to be
[36:30] in the house the Lord today good to be
[36:33] gathered together we did surprise
[36:36] brother John and we probably should have
[36:39] known that even and surprising him he'd
[36:40] ask us to preach but I didn't even
[36:42] bother bringing a tie or a suit so I'm
[36:45] wearing all-purpose pants this morning
[36:47] you can fish in them you can drive in
[36:50] them you can preach in them and sister
[36:52] Anne was went out and did some shopping
[36:54] and she bought me a shirt and tie so I'm
[36:56] wearing my new favorite tie and a dress
[36:58] shirts at least from for those watching
[37:01] online it looks like I'm just not
[37:02] wearing a coat everyone else can see my
[37:05] shark socks which I think my son bought
[37:09] me is because I'm a lawyer and it's a
[37:11] professional affinity that we have with
[37:13] the Sharks but we so we may not be fully
[37:18] dressed as you normally would see us but
[37:19] we're comfortable with family today to
[37:21] be able to share the word of the Lord
[37:23] considered a great privilege to be able
[37:25] to do so so we're glad to be here with
[37:26] you Matthew chapter 3 verses 13 to 17
[37:30] then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan
[37:32] unto John to be baptized of him but John
[37:36] forbade him saying I have need to be
[37:38] baptized of thee and cometh out to me
[37:40] and Jesus answering said unto Him suffer
[37:43] to be so now for thus it becometh us to
[37:45] fulfill all righteousness then he
[37:48] suffered him in Jesus when he was
[37:50] baptized went up straightway out of the
[37:51] water and lo the heavens were opened
[37:54] unto him and he saw the Spirit of God
[37:56] descending like a dove and lighting upon
[37:58] him and lo a voice from heaven saying
[38:00] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[38:03] pleased
[38:04] and then also in Matthew chapter 17
[38:10] it's important to note that brother
[38:14] branham points out that in Matthew
[38:17] chapter 3 that had a special
[38:19] significance and that what we read in
[38:21] Matthew chapter 17 isn't just a repeat
[38:23] of it but it's actually a brother Graham
[38:25] called the adoption of his where God
[38:27] adopted his own son so it has a special
[38:30] significance not just another repeat or
[38:32] just another saying or another
[38:34] expression of that what took place on
[38:37] the Jordan River has a different
[38:38] significance but there's something that
[38:40] is repeated here that I wanted to point
[38:41] out Matthew chapter 17 verses 1 to 5 and
[38:45] after six days Jesus taketh Peter James
[38:47] and John his brother and bringeth them
[38:49] up into a high mountain apart and he was
[38:52] transfigured before them and his face
[38:54] did shine as the Sun and his raiment was
[38:56] white as the light and behold there
[38:58] appeared unto them Moses and Elias
[39:00] talking with him then answered Peter and
[39:03] said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us
[39:04] to be here if thou wilt let us make
[39:07] three make here three Tabernacles one
[39:09] for thee and one for Moses and one for
[39:11] Elias while he yet spake behold a bright
[39:14] cloud overshadowed them and behold a
[39:16] voice out of the cloud which said this
[39:19] is my beloved son in whom I'm well
[39:21] pleased hear ye him if we could just bow
[39:24] our heads and a word of Prayer Heavenly
[39:26] Father we're grateful to be gathered
[39:28] together today in your house to be
[39:30] gathered together with believers who
[39:32] share a precious faith Lord of faith
[39:35] which has been quickened in this endtime
[39:37] for an endtime promise now Lord as we've
[39:40] gathered we're looking to you to keep a
[39:42] safe Lord to keep us healthy to sanctify
[39:45] the atmosphere Lord and sanctify our
[39:47] bodies and keep us well the Lord we've
[39:49] come in obedience to a promise we've
[39:51] come trusting in you we realize that
[39:54] regardless of the measures that we would
[39:56] take to keep from becoming ill lord if
[39:59] lest you watch over this house lest you
[40:01] watch over us Lord we watch in vain so
[40:04] we confess father that we're committing
[40:06] ourselves completely to you for your
[40:07] protection and father's we have gathered
[40:10] we have not done so in vain
[40:11] we have worshiped you and you've come
[40:13] and inhabited those praises now father
[40:15] speak take the bread of life and break
[40:17] it to us and Lord in the simplicity of
[40:20] it may each one of us be incurred
[40:21] we commit it to you now in the name of
[40:23] the Lord Jesus Christ amen and you may
[40:26] be seated
[40:27] this is gonna take a very very simple
[40:30] subject on fatherhood and I felt it
[40:33] would be appropriate for the day and
[40:36] being Father's Day and I'd find that
[40:39] I've known don't normally just if it's
[40:41] going to be Christmas or if it's going
[40:42] to be you know even any other holiday
[40:46] even sometimes with Easter it's not that
[40:48] I'm just you just try to focus on the
[40:50] subject matter and preach on the
[40:51] resurrection but you just yield yourself
[40:53] to the Lord and desire for him to
[40:55] quicken something and I felt he did just
[40:56] quicken something within this subject of
[40:59] fatherhood on Father's Day so my whole
[41:03] sermon is happy Father's Day if I didn't
[41:05] say the beginning my whole sermon is
[41:07] happy Father's Day and just an
[41:08] encouragement to fathers and if you're
[41:11] not a father and you you can derive from
[41:15] these very teachings on fatherhood a
[41:18] greater appreciation for the love that
[41:20] God has for you because we're wanting
[41:22] just to focus on the attributes of God
[41:24] and fatherhood to understand even what
[41:27] our role is as a father and it's a role
[41:29] that you never you never grow out of
[41:31] that it remains with you all your days
[41:33] and so a father is a head of a household
[41:37] or the founder of a family
[41:38] he is one that's the originator she just
[41:41] looked at definitions that wouldn't be
[41:43] secular
[41:44] wouldn't even be Christian definitions
[41:46] but just a father even in the natural is
[41:48] one who's the head of a household or a
[41:50] founder of a family he's the one who
[41:52] begets so he's called the originator of
[41:54] the family and fatherhood is a natural
[41:58] office of a man a man becomes a father
[42:00] by having children but what I want to
[42:03] focus on is how the fatherhood is an
[42:05] essential attribute of God the Father
[42:08] itself is a manifestation of God and
[42:10] fatherhood be in a manifestation of God
[42:13] that means there's a power behind it and
[42:15] there's a provision for him so we were
[42:17] just not on our own as fathers you're
[42:19] not on your own as parents but it's
[42:21] actually a manifestation of the
[42:23] attributes of God and fatherhood is an
[42:25] essential attribute of God as we read
[42:28] here in Matthew chapter 3 it says in lo
[42:30] a voice from heaven saying this is my
[42:32] beloved son
[42:34] whom I'm well pleased so goddess I
[42:36] didn't define Christ as his son Jesus he
[42:39] says as my son in whom I'm well pleased
[42:42] and he realized it takes an
[42:44] understanding of the Godhead to be able
[42:45] to take they recognize what's taking
[42:48] place in this scripture
[42:49] some believe in the oneness so strongly
[42:51] that they just believe that this was
[42:52] just a big act or a drama somehow that a
[42:55] voice was speaking this is my son or
[42:57] that Jesus was praying to himself but we
[42:59] realized that God is not one like your
[43:01] fingers one and that even the oneness
[43:04] pentecostals understanding the Godhead
[43:06] it does not quite capture the true
[43:08] oneness of the father with the son and
[43:11] so he says this is my beloved Son in
[43:13] whom I'm well pleased then in Matthew
[43:15] chapter 17 it says while he yet spake
[43:18] behold a bright cloud overshadowed them
[43:21] and behold a voice in out of the cloud
[43:24] which said this is my beloved Son in
[43:26] whom I'm well pleased hear ye him so he
[43:30] can recognize a difference the second
[43:32] time and that now he's saying here he
[43:34] him brother branham taught us that this
[43:36] was the adoption of his own son when he
[43:38] sent them out before witnesses and you
[43:40] see many different things typed in that
[43:42] adoption robe and he says here he him he
[43:45] speaks I speak no longer this is why
[43:47] Jesus could say it all power is given
[43:49] unto me above my father and he comes to
[43:52] his adoption and we know that his
[43:54] purpose was to lay down his life as a
[43:55] sacrifice for us all so he comes to his
[43:58] purpose
[43:58] once he's positioned but here what I
[44:01] want to point out is that God is
[44:02] declaring himself to be a father God is
[44:05] actually looking at Jesus and he's
[44:07] saying this is my son so he was willing
[44:10] to identify himself as being the father
[44:13] he's the one that created him this is
[44:15] the beginning of the creation of God
[44:17] he's the one that fathered him and he's
[44:19] I didn't define himself in the role of a
[44:22] father by saying this is my son he's
[44:26] willing to be identified as the father
[44:29] of Jesus and when he says this is my
[44:31] beloved son it means he's my esteemed
[44:34] son he's my dear son he's even - the
[44:36] word could be used as my favorite son he
[44:39] is one who is worthy of my love this is
[44:41] one that I'm I'm proud of this is my
[44:43] beloved son and in Psalms 89 verses
[44:47] six to 27 it says he shall cry unto me
[44:50] thou art my father my god and the rock
[44:54] of my salvation also I will make him my
[44:57] firstborn higher than the kings of the
[45:00] earth we know this speaks of Christ and
[45:02] here he's saying that he's going to cry
[45:04] unto me saying thou art my father my god
[45:07] so he's I didn't define God as his
[45:09] father and the rock of my salvation says
[45:12] and I'll make him my firstborn higher
[45:14] than the kings of the earth and we know
[45:17] that Jesus is the firstborn among many
[45:19] brethren so God has identified not just
[45:22] as the father of Christ but yet he has
[45:25] identified as a father and brother
[45:28] branham righteous in the church age book
[45:30] chapter 9 he says speaking of God he
[45:32] desired in love a family of his own
[45:35] a family of sons sons like himself so
[45:40] this speaks to the nature of God when we
[45:41] think of father's and we say happy
[45:43] Father's Day or you think about being a
[45:45] father or you think that of the father
[45:47] that God has given you in the flesh and
[45:49] the dad that you have at home it's not
[45:51] just the ability to bring forth children
[45:53] it's not just ability of father and
[45:56] child and we realize that it's just
[45:58] become it's just a natural process and
[46:00] it seems to be so easy that our we kind
[46:03] of lose the significance of how
[46:05] important that office is fatherhood is
[46:08] the office of being a father and it's
[46:10] not just an office because you have the
[46:12] physical ability to procreate but it's
[46:15] something that God identifies as been an
[46:18] attribute of himself says he desired and
[46:21] loved a family of his own of family of
[46:23] sons like himself so God desired to be a
[46:26] father and so when you see a father
[46:29] whether it be if it's perverted whether
[46:32] it would know regardless of how it is
[46:33] expressed the original is an attribute
[46:36] of God to be a father is an expression
[46:39] of God and if you look in the Old
[46:41] Testament you find that God is often
[46:44] referred to as the God of thy father
[46:46] Abraham the god of my father and Jacob
[46:49] and God is related to though he might be
[46:52] looked at in certain ways as one who
[46:54] looked out over Israel but yet Israel
[46:57] always regarded him to be a god over
[47:00] them
[47:00] and if he spoke of you the God to be the
[47:03] God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[47:05] so that God was above them all and he
[47:07] was gone over them and it was your God
[47:10] and he may have been the god of your
[47:12] father but he wasn't your father God he
[47:14] was a God over the people and that was
[47:17] the way that God was viewed in the Old
[47:18] Testament but through Jesus Christ he's
[47:21] not just the God of thy father but he
[47:23] becomes God your father
[47:25] and so Jesus changes the relationship of
[47:28] God to the people it's not just one over
[47:31] you but yet this is one who is a father
[47:33] to you so the god of thy father actually
[47:36] becomes God your Father and Jesus says
[47:40] it in many different places in Matthew
[47:41] 5:48 he tells you to be therefore
[47:44] perfect even as your heavenly Father
[47:46] which is in heaven is perfect
[47:48] so it's not just be perfect as God is
[47:51] perfect but he says be therefore perfect
[47:53] even as your father which is in heaven
[47:56] is perfect
[47:57] so Jesus when he says that he's actually
[47:59] showing that the ability must be there
[48:02] that if your father in God is perfect in
[48:05] heaven and then you're told to be
[48:07] perfect as a mere human then you say
[48:09] well this is an impossibility but rather
[48:11] he brings a relationship you should be
[48:14] perfect just like your daddy's perfect
[48:16] be perfect just like your father the one
[48:18] that brings you forth is perfect so then
[48:21] you realize the nature must be there to
[48:23] be perfect the the power is there to be
[48:26] perfect the possibilities there to be
[48:28] perfect and it's only made so by
[48:30] relationship he doesn't just don't be
[48:33] perfect as God is perfect he says be
[48:35] therefore perfect as your heavenly
[48:36] father which would give you the genes
[48:39] which would give you the nature and then
[48:41] as a father would nurture that nature to
[48:43] allow perfection to come forth and so
[48:46] it's beautiful how Jesus then gives us a
[48:48] relationship to God not as one who's
[48:50] subject to him but as one that King from
[48:53] him he is our Father says in Matthew
[48:56] chapter 23 verse 9 and you read this
[48:59] it's kind of remarkable that there to be
[49:00] an organized religion that would violate
[49:02] this it says call no man your father
[49:04] upon the earth it says for one is your
[49:06] father which is in heaven I'm so there's
[49:09] one it one which is your father and he
[49:11] says what
[49:12] in heaven Jesus is going to great
[49:14] lengths not to merely identify himself
[49:17] as the Son of God but also to place us
[49:20] in relationship to God only one is your
[49:24] father which is in heaven and in the
[49:26] Gospels 21 times Jesus refers to God as
[49:29] your father even when he's praying let
[49:32] them be one father let them be one even
[49:34] as you and I are one so though we would
[49:37] look beauties assess the only begotten
[49:40] son he was at the time the only begotten
[49:42] Son but now we know we know he's the
[49:45] firstborn among many brethren and that
[49:47] God is becoming this family that God
[49:49] wanted to be a father he wanted to have
[49:51] a family of sons like himself so now we
[49:54] are in relationship to God in the same
[49:56] way that Jesus was he is our Father God
[50:00] is our Father Jesus praying that we
[50:02] would be one with God just as he was one
[50:05] and brother branham writes this in the
[50:08] church age book chapter four he says I
[50:09] know thy poverty but thou were but thou
[50:13] are rich he says there it is again and
[50:15] as he's quoting from the smyrnaean
[50:18] church age he says there it is again see
[50:20] him walking up and down in the midst of
[50:22] his church like a father he's looking
[50:25] down upon his family he is the head of
[50:29] his household he is the provider he is
[50:32] the protector this is God's relationship
[50:35] to his church this is God's relationship
[50:37] to his children he is the head of this
[50:39] household he is the provider he is the
[50:42] protector and so I want you to begin to
[50:45] notice the expression of pure fatherhood
[50:47] and and not even I although I believe it
[50:50] would be extremely beneficial for us to
[50:53] have a greater depth of revelation of
[50:55] God's care for us and God's promises to
[50:57] us but also as fathers and speaking to
[51:00] fathers today and myself being
[51:02] instructed by then by the by these
[51:04] things we can recognize the pure
[51:06] expression of fatherland that God as a
[51:09] father is looking down upon his family
[51:11] he's not just the head of the household
[51:13] to be served and the head of the
[51:15] household he gets the choice seat at the
[51:17] table
[51:18] he gets the choice cut of meat he's the
[51:20] one that gets first and he's the one
[51:21] that gets everything but he's also the
[51:23] provider he is
[51:25] protector so this is that this is an
[51:27] expression of fatherhood and we see it
[51:30] being expressed in God himself for the
[51:33] randoms rights further in the same
[51:34] chapter God was the leader of the people
[51:36] actually he was their king and if he
[51:40] just left it in this image of King we
[51:42] would see one has been the the final
[51:44] authority the final say the one that all
[51:46] the kingdom Revere's and worships and is
[51:49] subject to and they bowed down to him
[51:51] the king of his subjects you have his
[51:53] domain and all those that would serve
[51:55] him in his domain but he says he was a
[51:57] father king so he wanted to change the
[52:01] relationship of God to us is not just
[52:03] merely king but father king so we're not
[52:06] just subjects but were family I think
[52:09] it's something that brother branham goes
[52:11] to great lengths to identify that out of
[52:13] the open of the seals it's not a king
[52:15] who's unrelated who is now bringing
[52:18] slaves to his side he wants to call his
[52:20] bride to his side it has to do with
[52:23] relationship and so he says he is a
[52:25] father King he took care of Israel like
[52:29] a man cares for his family now depending
[52:33] on what kind of father you had you might
[52:34] look at it this is a good thing you
[52:37] might look at it as a bad thing but it's
[52:39] like he took care of Israel like a man
[52:42] cares for his family he says he fed them
[52:45] fought their battles smooth the way
[52:48] their difficulties and settled their
[52:51] problems that's the definition of
[52:53] fatherhood you feed him you fight their
[52:55] battles you smooth away their
[52:56] difficulties you settle their problems
[52:58] this is what God did for Israel when he
[53:01] took care of his family he fed he
[53:03] thought he's smooth he's settled this is
[53:05] how God was over Israel he didn't just
[53:07] give him things to eat but he also
[53:09] fought their paddles he didn't just
[53:11] fight their battles and feed them but he
[53:13] smoothed away difficulties and he
[53:15] settled their problems this is how God
[53:18] expressed himself as a father to Israel
[53:21] this is how we then see an example of
[53:23] true fatherhood that we are not only
[53:25] just to feed our children but we fight
[53:27] their battles we smooth away their
[53:29] difficulties we settle their problems
[53:31] and maybe not just for the children but
[53:33] for the family this is the role that we
[53:35] take on
[53:36] and you'll find that there's fathers and
[53:38] a real fathers I could say about brother
[53:40] John they never stop being a father even
[53:42] when their children grow up and they get
[53:44] married and they start having their own
[53:45] children they still have a desire to
[53:47] feed to fight their battles smooth the
[53:49] way their difficulties settle their
[53:51] problems because it's an attribute of
[53:53] fatherhood so so like a man cares for
[53:56] his family he fed them fought their
[53:58] battles smooth the way their
[53:59] difficulties instead of their problems
[54:01] he just busied himself over them that
[54:05] beautiful he says he just busy himself
[54:08] only them he was system manie's days I
[54:10] think sometimes a busy parent might have
[54:12] a negative connotation they call maybe
[54:14] helicopter moms they're just always
[54:17] there hovering over their children but
[54:19] this is what God did he just busied
[54:21] himself over his room he was always
[54:23] concerned you want to know how concerned
[54:24] he was he told him which seemed to wash
[54:27] sir pots in how to shave their beard
[54:29] what what fabrics they can wear together
[54:32] and why was he doing it he was doing all
[54:34] this to teach him things he was doing
[54:36] all this to protect him don't eat these
[54:37] kind of food and don't do this and don't
[54:39] do that be there oh my that's just
[54:41] legalism that was strict no it was God
[54:43] as being the wise parent know how to
[54:46] protect them he knew how to establish
[54:49] boundaries and give them order and that
[54:51] it would create discipline and it would
[54:53] keep them from partaking in things that
[54:55] were harmful it would preserve them down
[54:57] the road and how high breeding will will
[55:00] cause things to be degraded and to
[55:02] become weak they say don't mix this and
[55:04] don't do that don't wear your Cotton's
[55:06] with your linens my goodness what's
[55:07] happening we've got a MoU hybrid into
[55:09] one thing now right but go up that was
[55:12] said well that seems to be really strict
[55:13] how God but God just knew this was what
[55:16] was best
[55:17] I mean you ponder and think about it God
[55:20] told the children of Israel not to eat
[55:22] certain meats not to eat certain things
[55:24] prepared certain ways and certain things
[55:26] if they're if they're rodents and things
[55:29] strangled he said don't eat them
[55:30] why cos God knew those foods were the
[55:34] best for their bodies but diet to
[55:37] preserve them he gave us some hay these
[55:38] are think I made the human body and I
[55:41] think I've got a pretty good idea of
[55:42] what would be better
[55:43] and I'm not necessarily advocating the
[55:45] kosher diet but if you're looking for
[55:47] one that's healthy
[55:48] I think the kosher diet would make most
[55:49] sense it's scriptural some people say
[55:52] well let's go back to the Garden of Eden
[55:53] well that was four bodies that weren't
[55:55] falling and so God was looking out after
[55:58] them he was caring for them he was
[56:00] busying himself with his children and I
[56:02] find it striking that children of Israel
[56:05] even to this day the Jews will stay very
[56:07] very strict with their dietary laws and
[56:10] laws of cleansing and when the Black
[56:12] Death the plague Black Death came over
[56:15] Europe there's over 60 million people
[56:16] dying and communities ravished in
[56:19] millions and millions of people dying
[56:21] but there was one group of people that
[56:23] weren't dying it was the Jews and they
[56:26] were surviving at such numbers seemingly
[56:27] unimpacted by the whole thing they were
[56:30] surviving and healthy and alive and and
[56:33] there because they weren't dying they
[56:35] begin to blame the Jews for the plagues
[56:38] but you know was keeping the Jews alive
[56:40] the law that God had given him thousands
[56:43] of years before not to eat certain meats
[56:46] and because they wouldn't eat rodents
[56:47] and they were wouldn't weren't eating
[56:49] certain foods they weren't getting the
[56:51] plague and so God gave them a law that
[56:54] would not just preserve them in those
[56:56] days but if they honored it it would
[56:58] keep him through all days why because
[57:00] this is an attribute of god he just
[57:02] busied himself over his children and
[57:04] this is what fatherhood should look like
[57:06] not a man who busies himself with his
[57:09] own ambitions or his own desires and
[57:11] he's only concerned about himself and he
[57:13] used fatherhood as being like me but
[57:14] then they finally got to the top of the
[57:16] multi-level marketing scheme I'm finally
[57:18] at the top and now everyone's beneath me
[57:20] you're all my downline so everything you
[57:23] do I get a percentage of no that's
[57:25] that's not the way that God that's not
[57:28] the way fatherhood works it's almost as
[57:31] if he should just flip the pyramid
[57:32] upside down it's the one who's at the
[57:33] bottom he's beneath the family he served
[57:36] in the family puts the family's needs
[57:38] above his own and the only way that we
[57:40] can properly do that it's not just to
[57:42] focus on the family but to be focused on
[57:44] the word and being focused on the word
[57:47] then that we do that for our family's
[57:49] benefit but this is what fatherhood
[57:51] looks like fatherhood is one man who
[57:54] bizzy's himself over his family and
[57:57] there are certain ways that we could
[57:59] view fatherhood to where we placed the
[58:01] man in a position of authority to where
[58:04] he is this he is the ruler he's the head
[58:06] and it can get a little bit out of
[58:08] balance because then you just think
[58:10] you're just under his thumb but that's
[58:12] not the way that God has arranged it
[58:14] God has arranged it in the way that it's
[58:16] a it's a necessary order for things to
[58:18] function properly but it doesn't make
[58:20] one part greater than another even at
[58:24] the the phrase is God establishes an
[58:26] order we sometimes say well you're the
[58:28] you know I'm here at the bottom man on a
[58:30] totem pole and they found when they when
[58:33] they looked at the they investigated the
[58:36] the origin and the etymology of the
[58:38] totem poles they trying to figure out
[58:39] was there a particular ranking that was
[58:41] being expressed in the totem pole and in
[58:44] some cultures and hidden cultures there
[58:46] was no particular ranking or order that
[58:49] was to be expressed in the totem pole
[58:50] but in others the one that was at the
[58:53] bottom was the most important and we
[58:56] said well you're just the I'm just the
[58:57] low man on the totem pole well then
[58:58] you're the most important because in a
[59:00] totem pole they're often the most than
[59:01] the biggest ones they're bigger than the
[59:04] other ones and they're supporting the
[59:06] whole structure so even the idea I just
[59:08] want to be the top man on the totem pole
[59:10] well that's probably cuz you the least
[59:11] the least important but it's not
[59:15] necessarily to have to have it as one
[59:17] better than the other but it's just the
[59:19] way things are arranged and so intent in
[59:22] the family you can have they headed the
[59:23] family the head of the household but
[59:25] it's not to make him at the dictator and
[59:27] out of the brute and the boss over the
[59:29] whole thing but yet there must be an
[59:31] order and gods only provided place of
[59:34] worship says the family of God obeys the
[59:37] order of the family order of the father
[59:40] of the family so the family of God obeys
[59:42] the order of the father of the family
[59:44] and so he is the father the family we
[59:46] obey his order and that's instructed to
[59:49] us as fathers that we must have an order
[59:53] that if the family of God obeys the
[59:55] order of the Father then a father must
[59:57] have an order but Vestas every one of
[1:00:00] his children obeys every word to the
[1:00:02] order because they are part of him he
[1:00:05] says we live in our homes like
[1:00:06] I live you live in your home like the
[1:00:08] Joneses like the Joneses living and the
[1:00:10] house of God we lived by the Word of God
[1:00:13] and everyone that proceedeth out of the
[1:00:15] mouth of God and any other fraud we
[1:00:17] won't listen to him amen to that and so
[1:00:20] as we see that Express with the family
[1:00:23] the family of God that God is the father
[1:00:25] and as his children we obey his order
[1:00:27] and we obey his word he says in our home
[1:00:30] we live like branham's live that means
[1:00:32] there must be an order to the family and
[1:00:34] it's the father that sets that order the
[1:00:38] Bible says in proverbs 1:8 my son hear
[1:00:40] the instruction of thy father and
[1:00:42] forsake not the law of thy mother so a
[1:00:45] mother must have a law and a father must
[1:00:47] have an instruction in proverbs 6:20 my
[1:00:49] son keep thy father's commandment and
[1:00:51] forsake not the law of thy mother so the
[1:00:55] father must have a commandment and again
[1:00:56] the mother must have a law these are
[1:00:59] things that are in God's Word father has
[1:01:02] to have an order a father has to have
[1:01:03] instructions a father has to have
[1:01:05] Commandments and brother Branham says in
[1:01:08] the leadership he says one of the last
[1:01:11] sermons he preaches this is the one in
[1:01:12] October of 65 he said the first thing is
[1:01:15] you taste speaking of leadership it's
[1:01:17] not the last one he ministers but he
[1:01:20] does the same theme in the next one that
[1:01:21] he preaches he's talked about the things
[1:01:23] that impact us he's his first is the
[1:01:25] mother's kindness then the father's word
[1:01:28] so this is instructive to us God has a
[1:01:31] word God has a commandment God has
[1:01:33] things that are very detailed for us God
[1:01:35] has thought through things and he's he's
[1:01:36] given thought to how were to be cared
[1:01:38] for him what's best for us and then it
[1:01:40] becomes incumbent upon a father to be
[1:01:42] thoughtful becomes incumbent upon a
[1:01:44] father to not just be reactive but
[1:01:46] proactive where he's thinking through
[1:01:48] things in advance instead of just
[1:01:50] dealing with them when they come up oh
[1:01:51] my goodness what do I do now but rather
[1:01:53] thinking ahead of time how he can act
[1:01:55] and how he can put things in order for
[1:01:57] the time when trouble would come so he
[1:02:00] says then the father's word after the
[1:02:02] mother gives you your first step then
[1:02:04] you look to your daddy he said all of us
[1:02:06] for wisdom because he is the head of the
[1:02:09] house he says not that he's any smarter
[1:02:12] and I think maybe at least Elliott's
[1:02:14] already picking up on this in that he
[1:02:16] knows more than me so it's not that you
[1:02:18] obey your dad
[1:02:19] just because he's smarter because maybe
[1:02:21] he's not smarter he says then you look
[1:02:23] to your dad for wisdom because he's the
[1:02:25] head of the house not that he's any
[1:02:27] smarter but he's made a leader of his
[1:02:29] family so he fathered what we follow
[1:02:31] what our daddy says do that's wait
[1:02:34] because he's been made to the Father
[1:02:36] he's the one that sets the order he's
[1:02:38] the one that puts things into place he
[1:02:40] says now son I'd like for you to do a
[1:02:41] certain thing then we listen to him
[1:02:43] because it's wisdom listen he's learned
[1:02:46] a whole lot and we've got to ask him to
[1:02:49] see what he learned and then we can
[1:02:50] profit by his what he has learned he
[1:02:53] tells us now go now don't go and do this
[1:02:55] because I did that my father father told
[1:02:57] me not to do it but I did it and it
[1:02:59] caused this to happen to me something
[1:03:01] bad then he that daddy tells us how to
[1:03:04] do it and what to do right so it's not
[1:03:08] because he's better and that he's
[1:03:09] stronger he's why that he's that he's
[1:03:11] smarter but he's been through things
[1:03:13] he's seen things he's experienced things
[1:03:14] so it's incumbent upon him even to
[1:03:16] process his own experiences and then
[1:03:18] share them with his children so that
[1:03:20] they don't make the same mistake I read
[1:03:23] one time I think was in The Reader's
[1:03:24] Digest where they said that when I left
[1:03:27] for college I was just so disappointed
[1:03:29] and discouraged how little my parents
[1:03:30] knew
[1:03:31] upon coming back after four years I was
[1:03:33] shocked at how much they learned in such
[1:03:35] a short period of time but it's it's
[1:03:39] maybe not the widths and they are the
[1:03:42] smarts and the academic prowess that
[1:03:46] makes them fit to be parents but it's
[1:03:48] what they've been through the
[1:03:50] experiences that they have so we can
[1:03:52] just gather from this that has gone
[1:03:54] busied himself over his children and
[1:03:56] that God gives an order to his family to
[1:03:58] obey we see these same attributes for us
[1:04:00] as fathers and within the dynamics of
[1:04:02] our own family we're to hear the
[1:04:04] instruction of the father were to keep
[1:04:05] the father's commandment that were to
[1:04:07] follow the order of the father not
[1:04:09] because he's smarter but because God has
[1:04:11] placed him in that position and that God
[1:04:13] will actually honor us for honoring him
[1:04:15] even if this decision may not be right
[1:04:18] as long as it's not contrary to the word
[1:04:20] and we honor him God will honor us and
[1:04:23] honoring him and it's the father who'll
[1:04:25] answer it's the father we'll have to
[1:04:27] make those
[1:04:27] try brother brim ask the question in
[1:04:30] what is fatherhood it's an attribute of
[1:04:33] God he says about Parenthood he says and
[1:04:36] he's the source of parenthood this is a
[1:04:39] I think this should be encouraging to
[1:04:41] parents that if God is the original
[1:04:43] parent that I as a parent I am in an
[1:04:48] office that god holds therefore he
[1:04:50] understands and being understanding he
[1:04:54] will look out after me he will give me
[1:04:56] what I have need of I don't think that
[1:04:57] any mother should ever despair that
[1:04:59] she's not able to raise her children and
[1:05:02] you might think all this world I have a
[1:05:03] new child and I'm trying to raise a baby
[1:05:06] in this age that we're living it's so
[1:05:08] filthy it's so preferred and it's so
[1:05:10] chaotic and things are so just upset and
[1:05:14] turned around and what are things gonna
[1:05:15] look like don't worry don't fret God's
[1:05:18] made you that parent that mother over
[1:05:20] that child don't be afraid God will give
[1:05:22] you what you have Nita
[1:05:24] to guide that child even in a dark time
[1:05:26] like this brother Branham says in the
[1:05:29] message conflict between God and Satan
[1:05:31] and Parenthood originated in God because
[1:05:34] he was the first parent he's the first
[1:05:37] father he says don't you think that God
[1:05:39] says he gave to his children and he's
[1:05:43] liking it to this and I've just kind of
[1:05:44] skip over a little bit of it we as
[1:05:47] parents look after our children and we
[1:05:49] want the best for him
[1:05:50] and even the Bible Jesus says what if a
[1:05:52] son asked his father for something if
[1:05:55] asked for bread would he give him a
[1:05:56] stone if you asked for an egg would he
[1:05:57] give him a serpent he's saying your own
[1:05:59] natural father's know how to treat you
[1:06:02] in that way how much more your heavenly
[1:06:03] father and so as we think that if a
[1:06:06] natural father if God is a father he
[1:06:09] said he gave to its children and
[1:06:10] provided for them the best thing that
[1:06:12] could be provided for them this is the
[1:06:16] nature of God to provide for his
[1:06:18] children therefore is the nature
[1:06:20] fatherhood to provide the best that you
[1:06:23] can for your children
[1:06:24] it doesn't always mean the latest
[1:06:26] technical technology it doesn't mean the
[1:06:29] nicest cars and the nicest things but
[1:06:31] it's the best things and here in the
[1:06:33] Bible brother brother branham's
[1:06:35] identified in the very big
[1:06:36] what did he give Adam and the woman in
[1:06:39] the beginning the best thing he could
[1:06:40] give he gave them the word and he says
[1:06:44] God equipped his children what did he
[1:06:47] equip them with the word and so it
[1:06:49] speaks to an attribute of fatherhood
[1:06:51] that we are tasked with and we are
[1:06:53] responsible for equipping our families
[1:06:56] given them the tools that they need to
[1:06:58] succeed give him the resources that they
[1:07:00] need to guide themselves in this time
[1:07:03] that we're living and they need and it's
[1:07:05] not just the natural things I think we
[1:07:07] assumed the natural things and yes it
[1:07:09] applies to natural things a man who
[1:07:11] doesn't provide for his own household is
[1:07:13] worse than an infidel and so we're not
[1:07:15] just saying wow you know we're hungry
[1:07:17] well have faith and create bread no we
[1:07:20] were to provide we're to provide for
[1:07:22] children were to provide the natural
[1:07:23] thing but it goes beyond just the
[1:07:25] natural thing because there's been many
[1:07:28] men who provided shelter and clothing
[1:07:29] and food for their families but it was
[1:07:31] actually a curse because they themselves
[1:07:33] were consumed with their jobs consumed
[1:07:36] with their income consumed with
[1:07:38] promotions gave their children all the
[1:07:40] natural things that they could ever want
[1:07:41] but yet because there wasn't the proper
[1:07:43] equipment spiritually the proper
[1:07:46] relationship between father and child
[1:07:47] the children just waste away the family
[1:07:50] unit breaks up so it's not just a matter
[1:07:52] of providing natural things but even
[1:07:54] equipping in emotional and affectionate
[1:07:58] realms and in a spiritual realm
[1:08:00] he says God equipped his children
[1:08:03] that's what fatherhood should do that's
[1:08:06] what fathers should do they should have
[1:08:07] quit their children as the Bible says
[1:08:09] that is to me was a it's an
[1:08:12] extraordinary thought I don't believe
[1:08:14] I've had the privilege of ministering
[1:08:15] here but the Bible tells our children to
[1:08:19] honor their father and their mother and
[1:08:21] they're asked to do this regardless of
[1:08:25] whether they're Christians or not
[1:08:27] regardless of whether or not they have
[1:08:28] the Holy Ghost they they're told honor
[1:08:30] thy father and mother and he said well I
[1:08:32] I'm not a Christian I don't have the
[1:08:34] Holy Ghost it doesn't matter you this is
[1:08:36] not a commandment that you are expected
[1:08:38] to fulfill once you have the Holy Ghost
[1:08:40] but from the youngest who's able to
[1:08:43] understand those words they are taught
[1:08:44] by the Bible by Scripture by God they're
[1:08:47] required description
[1:08:49] honor their father and mother apart from
[1:08:51] a new birth experience and then you look
[1:08:54] into the word and find that there's a
[1:08:56] consequence for not honoring your father
[1:08:58] and mother and in the Old Testament it
[1:09:01] was death and there's a there's a and
[1:09:04] the way that God views rebellion in the
[1:09:05] way that God read review a child who
[1:09:08] does not honors father and mother that's
[1:09:11] very striking that the anger and the
[1:09:13] judgment that God has towards a child
[1:09:15] who does not honor their father and
[1:09:17] mother even if they don't have the Holy
[1:09:19] Ghost they're told to honor them to obey
[1:09:21] them children obey your parents in the
[1:09:24] Lord that's what a child must do even
[1:09:26] from the youngest age they are to obey
[1:09:28] their parents and they're to honor them
[1:09:31] and when you realize that the scripture
[1:09:34] that speaks to the fathers and says
[1:09:36] don't provoke your children to anger and
[1:09:39] not to frustrate your children the
[1:09:41] father's can actually impair their
[1:09:43] child's ability to obey them and honor
[1:09:46] them therefore it's incumbent upon the
[1:09:49] parents to do everything they can to see
[1:09:51] that their children can one obey them
[1:09:54] and have cause to honor them and not
[1:09:57] just lord over them you're supposed to
[1:09:58] obey me you're supposed to honor me but
[1:10:00] facilitate that honor encourage that
[1:10:03] honor equip them with the tools and
[1:10:05] resources they need to obey and to be
[1:10:08] able make their job easy
[1:10:09] if God's requiring obedience make it
[1:10:12] easy for them to obey if God's requiring
[1:10:14] honor
[1:10:14] make it easy for them to honor because
[1:10:17] that's what father's do they must equip
[1:10:20] their children and it's an attribute of
[1:10:22] God and now with and not to scare you
[1:10:26] that that's going to be a very very very
[1:10:27] long but it could be very long but not
[1:10:30] very very very very long but just I want
[1:10:34] to focus on a specific attribute of
[1:10:36] fatherhood and identify it within God
[1:10:39] and with the description that there's a
[1:10:42] very specific attribute of fatherhood
[1:10:44] that I'd like to just encourage
[1:10:46] encourage us with and that that we can
[1:10:49] recognize it it's how God views us and
[1:10:51] it's how God works with us
[1:10:53] okay so often times you think that God
[1:10:54] is just kind of he's just the one with
[1:10:56] the wooden spoon or the Bell waiting to
[1:10:58] spank us well that's not how God works
[1:11:00] he does chastises he does correct us but
[1:11:03] let me say this he also praises us a lot
[1:11:05] more than we realized
[1:11:07] and brother branham says this and writes
[1:11:09] this in the church age book he says how
[1:11:11] beautifully the Savior praises and
[1:11:13] commends his children he takes full
[1:11:16] account of their fine spiritual
[1:11:18] attitudes and behavior he knows that
[1:11:20] there is weakness amongst them but I
[1:11:22] said he does not cry out against it
[1:11:25] isn't that just like the Lord he knows
[1:11:28] how to encourage us in the right matters
[1:11:31] and discourage us in the wrong matters
[1:11:33] in other words discourage us from doing
[1:11:36] the wrong things to to point out things
[1:11:38] that are wrong that we ought not to do
[1:11:40] he knows how to encourage us in the
[1:11:42] right things discourage us in the wrong
[1:11:43] things we could all learn a good lesson
[1:11:46] right there in running the church and
[1:11:49] our families isn't better still we could
[1:11:52] all learn a good lesson in that God
[1:11:54] deals with each one of us in exactly
[1:11:56] this way it begins to talk about how God
[1:11:59] is a rewarder and he's faithful to to
[1:12:02] remember your labor for him and that
[1:12:04] he'll he'll grant your award in those
[1:12:06] things but notice how brother mem
[1:12:08] identifies this attribute of the father
[1:12:10] of our of God our Father he praises and
[1:12:14] commends his children and he's taken
[1:12:18] account of their their fine attitudes
[1:12:20] and their fine behaviors he's
[1:12:22] recognizing good behavior he's
[1:12:24] recognizing certain attributes and
[1:12:26] characteristics he says he knows there's
[1:12:28] weakness but he's not just crying out
[1:12:30] against the weakness to begin with
[1:12:32] because he knows how to encourage us to
[1:12:34] do the right things and he knows how to
[1:12:36] discourage us from doing wrong things he
[1:12:38] knows how to to to build us up so he
[1:12:41] doesn't just kick open the door and says
[1:12:43] you're a bunch of Rascals you're lazy
[1:12:45] you're no good clean this room but he
[1:12:49] comes in he starts praising them further
[1:12:50] from their care and their kindness and
[1:12:52] praise them for their attitudes and
[1:12:54] their behaviors and I believe that they
[1:12:56] even teach this with respect to
[1:12:57] leadership then if you need to correct
[1:13:00] something if you want someone to change
[1:13:01] their behavior you need to address
[1:13:03] something don't just sit them down and
[1:13:05] say hey mark you really blew it today
[1:13:06] you ran that forklift right into that
[1:13:08] lady and did this you did that and you
[1:13:09] and just beat them and tear them down
[1:13:11] you say hey you do a great job you show
[1:13:13] up on time you're always early you're
[1:13:15] always helpful you're willing to stay
[1:13:16] late you do this and you're always
[1:13:18] taking going the extra mile and we've
[1:13:20] noticed that you're always willing to
[1:13:21] volunteer even if it doesn't mean extra
[1:13:24] pay and and you build them up and then
[1:13:26] you say but we've noticed one thing that
[1:13:27] you could do a little bit better
[1:13:29] I mean you've built them up you've given
[1:13:31] them confidence that you have recognized
[1:13:33] they've gotten value you recognize that
[1:13:35] they're able to you able to do the job
[1:13:37] right and they're not just washed up and
[1:13:40] no good and don't have any abilities yes
[1:13:42] this is someone who's paying attention
[1:13:43] this is someone who cares
[1:13:45] this is it gives you confidence that
[1:13:46] what's coming next is not your fire you
[1:13:49] know you're putting this state well I'm
[1:13:51] willing to listen I understand and it
[1:13:53] says and this is something you can do
[1:13:54] better and you're almost at that point
[1:13:56] you're ready to do better fine they
[1:13:59] recognize I'm trying hard they seem that
[1:14:01] I do these things well and it's build
[1:14:03] you to a place where you're not tore
[1:14:04] down but you're in a good a better
[1:14:06] position to receive instruction and this
[1:14:09] is exactly brother Graham's identifying
[1:14:10] this attribute in God how beautifully
[1:14:12] the Savior praises and commends his
[1:14:14] children even though he sees weakness
[1:14:16] he's not just pointing out weakness
[1:14:18] first he's praising them encouraging
[1:14:20] them in their strong parts in their good
[1:14:22] parts in their potential and their
[1:14:24] ability and then he can correct them he
[1:14:27] says oh how he encourages us in the
[1:14:30] right matters he knows how to encourage
[1:14:31] the right matters he said we could all
[1:14:33] learn a good lesson right there in
[1:14:34] running the church yeah
[1:14:36] and running our families not running
[1:14:39] them off but running them operating them
[1:14:41] allowing them to function properly and
[1:14:44] thrive he knows how to encourage us we
[1:14:46] have to know how to encourage children
[1:14:48] encourage one another in right things
[1:14:52] this is an attribute of God and in
[1:14:56] Matthew chapter 3 in Matthew chapter 17
[1:14:58] we read it this is exactly what God does
[1:15:00] to Jesus he said this is my beloved Son
[1:15:03] in whom I am well pleased
[1:15:07] we know that the brother branham takes
[1:15:09] this and it's remarkable the the
[1:15:11] prophetic inside he had to turn this
[1:15:13] around to understand it in its depth as
[1:15:16] it says in Colossians 1:19 for it
[1:15:18] pleased the father that in him
[1:15:20] should all fullness do
[1:15:22] it pleased the father that in him all
[1:15:25] fullness do should dwell he says this is
[1:15:28] my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[1:15:30] to dwell and I'm pleased to dwell in him
[1:15:34] and yet the thing there stands out the
[1:15:36] part that I want to point out this
[1:15:37] morning is he says I am well pleased it
[1:15:41] pleased the father to dwell in him
[1:15:43] it is pleased in his son needs to take
[1:15:46] pleasure in to be favorably inclined to
[1:15:49] and God was a secret about it he
[1:15:52] publicly vocalized and declared his
[1:15:55] pleasure in his son and in doing so I
[1:15:58] believe he reveals a special attribute
[1:16:00] of fatherhood that this is a this is a
[1:16:04] I'm a necessary attribute of fatherhood
[1:16:07] he publicly is willing to say that's my
[1:16:10] son I'm proud of him this is my son
[1:16:14] I'm identified with him and not with it
[1:16:16] the shame well yeah I guess you got to
[1:16:17] take the good with the bad
[1:16:18] and we have to be careful sometimes we
[1:16:21] joke around and we said well this is my
[1:16:23] favorite son and this is my this is my
[1:16:25] favorite daughter and I'm not afraid to
[1:16:26] say that Eliza's my favorite daughter
[1:16:29] there's certain times that maybe that
[1:16:31] wouldn't be appropriate that if you had
[1:16:33] two daughters and it doesn't matter how
[1:16:36] you know even sometimes we use the
[1:16:37] languages say well this is my oldest and
[1:16:40] he's the smart one and this is my second
[1:16:43] oldest and he's the tough one he's been
[1:16:45] my challenge he's been the one that's
[1:16:47] been really really rough in that right
[1:16:49] little guy have you been like kind of
[1:16:50] the knucklehead and and he's like whoa
[1:16:53] daddy's saying it about me mommy's
[1:16:55] saying about me so what did they adopt
[1:16:56] the language yeah how much I'm the
[1:16:59] problem child
[1:17:00] I'm the challenge I'm the rough one and
[1:17:03] it's almost as if they want to conform
[1:17:05] to that to please you because that's the
[1:17:07] language you use on that's the way you
[1:17:10] talk about it and so we're being
[1:17:13] instructed here we want to encourage
[1:17:14] children in the right thing to
[1:17:16] discourage them from doing wrong things
[1:17:18] and one of them and if I haven't said it
[1:17:20] at the outset when I turn to this it's
[1:17:22] the ability of the father to praise and
[1:17:25] lift up this is an essential attribute
[1:17:28] of fatherhood they have the power to
[1:17:29] lift up to pray to raise their show
[1:17:32] the places they never thought they could
[1:17:34] go just to the praise of them and God
[1:17:37] says that about Jesus he vocalized and
[1:17:39] declared his pleasure and his own said
[1:17:41] this is my son I'm pleased with him he
[1:17:45] says a Luke chapter 2 verse 52 and Jesus
[1:17:47] increased in wisdom and stature and in
[1:17:49] favor with God and man he increased in
[1:17:54] favor with God this has tons that God's
[1:17:56] favor for Christ increased favor means
[1:17:58] it affords joy it affords pleasure it
[1:18:02] affords delight God was not ashamed to
[1:18:05] declare it to his own son you please me
[1:18:08] I derive pleasure from you I I derive
[1:18:12] great joy from you when I when I see you
[1:18:14] my son I'm happy when I see you I'm
[1:18:17] proud it makes me proud to be a dad in
[1:18:20] Psalms eighteen nineteen he brought me
[1:18:23] forth also into a large place he
[1:18:25] delivered me because he delighted in me
[1:18:28] means to take pleasure in tintin to
[1:18:31] desire to be pleased with notice how the
[1:18:33] Scriptures is speaking of this nature of
[1:18:35] God towards his son that Jesus increased
[1:18:38] in favor with God and God was not
[1:18:40] ashamed to tell his own son you're my
[1:18:45] favorite for you is increasing you're
[1:18:47] making me prouder day by day the buttons
[1:18:49] on my shirt are about to pop oh my my
[1:18:51] 12th my chest is swelling out for you
[1:18:54] I'm proud of you son
[1:18:55] he says because he delighted in me and
[1:19:00] Joe chapter 1 verse 8 it might seem to
[1:19:03] be somewhat of a paradox but says in the
[1:19:06] Lord said unto Satan has thou considered
[1:19:08] my servant Joe he said well how in the
[1:19:10] world did job ever get to this body was
[1:19:12] in what oh it starts right here yeah God
[1:19:15] says this is God now speaking about Joe
[1:19:18] that there's none like him in the earth
[1:19:21] a perfect and an upright man one that
[1:19:24] feareth God in the shoe is evil I read
[1:19:27] this just so you can see that God has
[1:19:29] these thoughts that's not the Bible tell
[1:19:31] us that I know my thoughts towards you
[1:19:33] the thoughts that she he has thoughts of
[1:19:35] peace and not a thoughts of a struggle
[1:19:39] and frustration that God has thoughts
[1:19:41] about you thoughts of peace pleasant
[1:19:43] thoughts to bring to
[1:19:44] expected to bring into a great climax
[1:19:47] and a great glory and a great triumph
[1:19:49] and these are the thoughts he had of Joe
[1:19:51] and it's these thoughts that actually
[1:19:52] carry joke throughout the whole thing
[1:19:54] there's none like him in the earth he's
[1:19:56] perfect and upright he's one that fears
[1:19:58] me and he's actually saying you can
[1:19:59] touch anything in his life just don't
[1:20:01] take his life and he still won't curse
[1:20:03] me he stood he still won't deny me why
[1:20:07] because God knew the character that Joe
[1:20:10] had and he's not shy to praise Joe he's
[1:20:13] not shy to speak up for him in John
[1:20:17] chapter 8 verse 54 says jesus answered
[1:20:20] if I honor myself my honor is nothing it
[1:20:23] is my father that honoureth me of whom
[1:20:26] you say that he is your God it is my
[1:20:29] father that honors mean it means to
[1:20:31] praise took stole to magnify to
[1:20:33] celebrate he says my father celebrates
[1:20:36] me my father extols me my father praises
[1:20:40] me and so Jesus in his relationship with
[1:20:42] the father must have been receiving
[1:20:44] praise must have been receiving
[1:20:47] magnification must have been felt
[1:20:48] celebrated as a son he felt that the
[1:20:52] father celebrated him as a son he felt
[1:20:55] that the father extolled him and
[1:20:57] magnified him and praised and this is
[1:20:59] how God was making his own son feel to
[1:21:02] her he didn't need to brag himself his
[1:21:04] coming his father would do it for him
[1:21:07] following my self-monitors nothing I
[1:21:09] could go around I like tell me oh well
[1:21:12] I'm a I'm a preacher this I'm a preacher
[1:21:14] that I'm I'm a I can do this I can do
[1:21:16] that and say well I mean he's just kind
[1:21:18] of doing his own horn but then when the
[1:21:20] dad says it it's different in John
[1:21:25] chapter 12 verses 28 to 29 it says
[1:21:27] father glorify thy name
[1:21:30] but it says glorify thy name the son in
[1:21:32] the hebrew the hebrew son means the
[1:21:34] builder of the family name so when a
[1:21:37] father has a son the son is going to be
[1:21:39] the continuation and the builder of that
[1:21:42] family name is going to continue that
[1:21:44] legacy he says father glorify thy name
[1:21:47] then came there a voice from heaven
[1:21:50] saying I have both glorified it and will
[1:21:53] glorify it again
[1:21:56] he says I praised you might extolled you
[1:21:59] I've magnified y'all glorify the name
[1:22:00] and I will glorify it again there's no
[1:22:03] ceasing in this glorification there's no
[1:22:05] stopping in this praise there's no end
[1:22:07] to my honor I have glorified it and I
[1:22:09] will glorify it again and the people
[1:22:12] therefore that stood by had heard it and
[1:22:13] said that it funded and others said an
[1:22:15] angel spake to him God publicly
[1:22:18] declaring I have glorified it and I will
[1:22:21] glorify it again that's just let's just
[1:22:25] say it in a very succinct way it is the
[1:22:27] role the father to praise his children
[1:22:29] it is the role the fathered to encourage
[1:22:32] the family to encourage his children it
[1:22:34] is the it is a necessary attribute of
[1:22:37] the father to lift up his children not
[1:22:41] that they would have to defend on their
[1:22:42] own not this y'all you you pull yourself
[1:22:44] up by your own bootstraps I did it
[1:22:45] myself you need to do it too I'm again I
[1:22:48] recognize that this is the this is a
[1:22:51] calling and father this is a calling of
[1:22:53] a dad to lift up his children to instill
[1:22:56] in them greatness to instill in them
[1:22:57] courage to teach them that if they honor
[1:23:00] Christ and they put God first and
[1:23:02] nothing is impossible with God it may be
[1:23:04] impossible to man but with God nothing
[1:23:06] is impossible and you're still in the
[1:23:09] courage and greatness paul liken himself
[1:23:13] to a father in the gospel and in doing
[1:23:16] so it affords an example of true
[1:23:18] fatherhood he says in 1st corinthians
[1:23:20] chapter 4 14 to 17 i write not these
[1:23:23] things to shame you that shouldn't be
[1:23:26] our role as parents to shame shame our
[1:23:29] children we have to be careful sometimes
[1:23:31] especially in a public setting when our
[1:23:33] children do something wrong we feel
[1:23:34] shame because we think it's reflective
[1:23:36] of us as parents and so in with the
[1:23:39] sense of shame and through pride we
[1:23:42] chastise our children and we do it in a
[1:23:44] way that hurts their spirits and Woo's
[1:23:47] them in a way that they ought not be but
[1:23:49] we feel that we're preserving our own
[1:23:51] image in front of other people sometimes
[1:23:54] people try to provoke you into
[1:23:55] correcting your children in front of
[1:23:56] them because they want to see you given
[1:23:58] to your kid and you have to realize I
[1:24:00] know how to discipline my children I
[1:24:02] know how to reach them you may think
[1:24:04] that I need to just beat my child or
[1:24:05] chastise them and tear them down right
[1:24:07] now
[1:24:07] and that's gonna fix the problem no
[1:24:10] that's not gonna be what's fixed the
[1:24:11] problem you can acknowledge you're wrong
[1:24:13] and you can tell the person I realized
[1:24:15] that what they did was wrong I will deal
[1:24:17] with this appropriately and as we do
[1:24:19] within our family and not be pressured
[1:24:20] into doing something that's wrong I tell
[1:24:24] you one thing if I just say this
[1:24:25] personally myself I feel that what the
[1:24:28] the only ones who are going to be able
[1:24:30] to navigate the current political
[1:24:32] climate and the social climate is the
[1:24:34] Bride of Christ is the true love of God
[1:24:36] in their arms who isn't so quick to take
[1:24:39] sides and so great to point things out
[1:24:41] throng on this side and the extreme and
[1:24:43] fanatical on the other but to be able to
[1:24:45] recognize certain things that are wrong
[1:24:48] whether they be systemic whether they be
[1:24:50] repetitive direct eyes that's not right
[1:24:52] under no circumstances that are right
[1:24:54] and then also not trying to take sides
[1:24:56] and divide the true Krish is the only
[1:24:58] one that can navigate because this
[1:25:00] society's turning to bullies on each
[1:25:02] side and they're trying to bully the
[1:25:04] bully and when you bully the bully the
[1:25:06] bully it becomes bullied err and it
[1:25:08] never gets better until someone's
[1:25:11] willing to humble themselves to the
[1:25:13] bully and say how can I help you why are
[1:25:16] you that way why do you have so much
[1:25:18] anger why do you have so much bitterness
[1:25:20] and to recognize people are the way they
[1:25:22] are because of wrongs that have been
[1:25:24] done things that have happened and to be
[1:25:27] the one that can express love and care
[1:25:29] and to see the things change and begin
[1:25:31] in whatever level you can help to make
[1:25:34] change instead of making it worse and
[1:25:36] these things that Paul writes he says
[1:25:38] I'm writing not to shame you and all too
[1:25:40] often it seems as if things are only
[1:25:42] said and done to shame another person he
[1:25:44] says but as my beloved Sons I warn you
[1:25:47] notice he's telling I'm not writing to
[1:25:49] shame you but I'm writing to warn you as
[1:25:50] my beloved sons this is the language of
[1:25:52] Paul is using to these children for
[1:25:54] though you have ten thousand instructors
[1:25:55] in Christ you have yet not many fathers
[1:25:58] for Christ Jesus I have begotten you
[1:26:01] through the gospel wherefore I beseech
[1:26:03] you be followers of me why is that
[1:26:06] people have such a hard time even if we
[1:26:07] said we follow the teachings of brother
[1:26:09] Branham
[1:26:11] I mean posted follow me and the whole
[1:26:15] Christian hymn saying you're just
[1:26:17] following a man impulse that they follow
[1:26:20] me it was Paul not a man absolutely he
[1:26:23] was a man and he wasn't afraid to say
[1:26:25] follow me being followers of me and he
[1:26:27] doesn't say here as I follow Christ
[1:26:29] he just says follow me he said for this
[1:26:32] cause of my sin unto you timotheus who
[1:26:34] is my beloved son and faithful in the
[1:26:36] Lord who shall bring you into
[1:26:37] remembrance of my ways which be in
[1:26:39] Christ as I teach everywhere in every
[1:26:42] Church Paul is speaking to the believers
[1:26:45] at Corinth as a father
[1:26:47] he's even recognized in Timothy as a son
[1:26:49] he says I don't write to shame you I'm
[1:26:51] not trying to tear you down I'm trying
[1:26:53] to warn you because you're my children
[1:26:55] and you may have many many instructors
[1:26:56] but I'm the one who food the gospel has
[1:26:59] brought you forth and so follow me
[1:27:01] because I have your best in mind follow
[1:27:03] me because I am following Christ because
[1:27:05] I'm lifting up the word for your hour
[1:27:07] and for your day and it's instructive
[1:27:10] it's instructive to them let me just
[1:27:13] clarify by no means saying that we
[1:27:14] follow a man I'm just saying it seems
[1:27:17] funny to me that they accused us of
[1:27:19] following a man when it scripturally
[1:27:21] Paul himself said follow me
[1:27:25] it says in Romans chapter 1 verse 8
[1:27:28] notice acted with this established here
[1:27:30] as Paul is saying you are my beloved
[1:27:33] sons I'm your father and the gospel
[1:27:35] follow me notice the language he uses in
[1:27:38] the different letters that he writes I'm
[1:27:39] gonna read enrollments and Philippians
[1:27:40] and Colossians and Thessalonians notice
[1:27:42] the language that he uses first I thank
[1:27:45] my God through Jesus Christ for you all
[1:27:47] that your faith is spoken of throughout
[1:27:50] the whole world Romans 1:18 says first
[1:27:52] now before I go any further first I want
[1:27:56] you to know I thank God for you for your
[1:27:59] faith is spoken from the whole world now
[1:28:01] you might imagine before you would go
[1:28:03] even further into Romans this is one of
[1:28:05] the first things that Paul wants to do
[1:28:07] when he wrote him he meant to just race
[1:28:09] it to you know good good-for-nothings
[1:28:11] and Rome to you slackers at Corinth no
[1:28:15] to the elect of God to the church to the
[1:28:17] faithful to the call it was a way of
[1:28:20] saying I know who you
[1:28:21] I want to praise you I want to extol you
[1:28:24] on a little job he says I thank God
[1:28:26] through Jesus Christ for you Paul the
[1:28:29] Prophet the messenger to the aged the
[1:28:31] very father in the gospel is saying that
[1:28:33] he thanks God for us because you our
[1:28:36] faith has spoken throughout the whole
[1:28:37] world he's beginning with praise to the
[1:28:40] Philippians 1st chapter 1 verses 3 to 6
[1:28:43] I think my god upon every remembrance of
[1:28:47] you every time I think of you I thank
[1:28:48] God for you always in every prayer of
[1:28:52] mine for you all making requests with
[1:28:54] joy listen to how he talks about the
[1:28:57] Philippians always in every prayer of
[1:29:00] mine for you all making requests with
[1:29:03] joy I joyfully make requests on your
[1:29:05] behalf I thank God in remembrance for
[1:29:07] you just for your fellowship in the
[1:29:09] gospel from the first day until now why
[1:29:13] could you imagine being a believer in
[1:29:14] that church Paul this great man within
[1:29:19] the church is one who's preaching
[1:29:20] something nobody else was preaching the
[1:29:23] revelation of Jesus Christ the truth of
[1:29:25] the body of Christ being his church
[1:29:27] these great revelations that he's
[1:29:29] bringing and here he said I thank God
[1:29:30] for you I thank God for your fellowship
[1:29:33] from the first day until now I make
[1:29:35] request on your behalf with joy and when
[1:29:38] I think of you I'm excited and I'm
[1:29:40] grateful for your fellowship Paul
[1:29:43] doesn't write say I'm the Prophet to
[1:29:45] this age I don't need you you just need
[1:29:47] to follow me you just need to get happy
[1:29:50] with what I teach you just need to do
[1:29:51] things the way I asked you to do him
[1:29:53] he's saying oh I love you I couldn't be
[1:29:56] here without you Oh your fellowship in
[1:29:58] the gospel I thank God for your
[1:30:00] fellowship from the first day until now
[1:30:02] I imagine he could have just said I
[1:30:04] don't know what I would do without you
[1:30:07] Colossians chapter 2 verse 5 for though
[1:30:10] I'd be absent the flesh and am i with
[1:30:12] you in the spirit join and be holding
[1:30:15] your order and the steadfastness of your
[1:30:18] faith in Christ
[1:30:19] what made Paul happy he says I'm joy
[1:30:22] beholding your order and the
[1:30:24] steadfastness of your faith as I see
[1:30:29] your steadfastness as I behold your
[1:30:31] order as they behold the way that you
[1:30:33] though I'm not there I'm here happy for
[1:30:36] you I'm proud of you and it was his way
[1:30:38] of encouraging and it's not just reverse
[1:30:41] psychology this was his way this was
[1:30:44] this is not just this isn't
[1:30:46] psychologists oh well that's just
[1:30:47] psychology oh that's just an old
[1:30:49] psychological trick well I mean okay
[1:30:52] it's the word if it has if it does
[1:30:54] something that am I thinking it does
[1:30:56] something to my mind and it works and as
[1:30:58] long as it's in the word let's use it
[1:31:00] and so it's not that kind of psychology
[1:31:03] or some kind of trick I'll never forget
[1:31:05] when we were and I may have shared this
[1:31:07] story with you one time before I yeah I
[1:31:09] think I'm only ever shared at one time
[1:31:11] before but we were at the beach in San
[1:31:13] Diego and we were catching all these
[1:31:15] crabs on the beach we had just buckets
[1:31:17] full of them and my my grandma wanted to
[1:31:19] throw the crabs back into the ocean
[1:31:21] really man we've been working all day
[1:31:23] long for these crabs and she said I know
[1:31:25] I know Aaron go throw him back because
[1:31:28] he always obeys his grandma he's a good
[1:31:30] boy and what am I gonna do at that point
[1:31:32] oh no I'm not a good boy I don't obey
[1:31:36] you I'm keeping the crabs I was like
[1:31:38] sorry guys whew you know the crackling
[1:31:41] right back in the ocean what was it it
[1:31:43] worked on me and in this way Paul is
[1:31:47] going to encourage a greater
[1:31:48] steadfastness and encourage the greater
[1:31:51] order by saying your order in
[1:31:53] steadfastness pleases me let's just take
[1:31:56] the cautions were a little bit out of
[1:31:58] order if he had written to the
[1:31:59] disorderly a Kalasha
[1:32:01] then they would have been horrible oh I
[1:32:03] guess we're them disorderly let's listen
[1:32:04] let's own it but no he encouraged them
[1:32:08] and he he had a way of reaching them and
[1:32:10] this is this is the lid this is the
[1:32:11] language of a father to his children to
[1:32:14] the best audience first first
[1:32:15] Thessalonians chapter 1 verses 2 & 3 we
[1:32:18] give thanks to God always for you all
[1:32:21] making mention of you in our prayers
[1:32:23] remembering without ceasing your work of
[1:32:27] faith and labor of love and patience of
[1:32:30] hope and our Lord Jesus Christ in the
[1:32:32] sight of God and our Father
[1:32:34] I remember without ceasing your work of
[1:32:37] faith your labor of love and your
[1:32:39] patience of Hope in our Lord Jesus
[1:32:42] Christ this is the language of a father
[1:32:44] to his children he said I
[1:32:46] right and you not to shame you but
[1:32:47] you're my beloved sons and as a father
[1:32:51] speaking to a fine son it is the role of
[1:32:53] a father to encourage to praise to lift
[1:32:56] up to instill greatness in his children
[1:32:59] he says I thank God for you
[1:33:01] I think in Kherson do you realize your
[1:33:03] faith is spoken of throughout all the
[1:33:05] world every time I think of you I thank
[1:33:07] God and every prayer with joy I make
[1:33:11] requests for you and I for your
[1:33:13] fellowship from the first day until now
[1:33:16] even though I'm not there with you in
[1:33:18] the flesh I'm with you in spirit and I
[1:33:20] have joy as I behold your order your
[1:33:22] steadfastness I thank God for you all
[1:33:24] the time and I remember that and always
[1:33:28] remember your work of faith your labor
[1:33:30] of love your patience of Hope this is
[1:33:32] the language of a father this is the
[1:33:34] kind of language we can adopt as fathers
[1:33:36] he says in first Corinthians 11:2 now I
[1:33:39] praise you brethren that you remember me
[1:33:41] in all things and keep the ordinance as
[1:33:43] I delivered them to you I praise you and
[1:33:46] then when he writes to the crib this
[1:33:48] this is after he wrote that first letter
[1:33:49] had a lot of Correction in it he was
[1:33:51] called him out for some pretty bad
[1:33:52] things but yet in that first letter he
[1:33:55] says now I praise you brother even
[1:33:57] though there's hard things that are
[1:33:59] being said things that are being
[1:34:00] corrected he went he didn't do without
[1:34:01] the praise he says now I praise you and
[1:34:04] then after he'd praised them and
[1:34:06] corrected them now he follows up at 2nd
[1:34:08] corinthians 7 he says for behold verses
[1:34:10] 11 to 16 for behold this selfsame sort
[1:34:14] what carefulness it wrought in you yea
[1:34:17] what clearing of yourselves yea what
[1:34:19] indignation yea what fear yeh would be
[1:34:21] him and desire yea what zeal yea what
[1:34:23] revenge and all things you have approved
[1:34:25] yourselves to be clear in this matter
[1:34:27] Paul is now commanding them and
[1:34:30] complemented after they fixed it it
[1:34:33] wasn't I told you you know I can't even
[1:34:36] believe I had to tell you guys you
[1:34:38] knuckleheads you should have known from
[1:34:40] the beginning that was wrong but no he
[1:34:42] encourages him he's like so oh my
[1:34:45] goodness you started a godly way and
[1:34:47] what careful said rod look at your
[1:34:49] your indignation your feel your fear
[1:34:52] your himmat desire what revenge all you
[1:34:54] are approved you are clear in this
[1:34:56] matter you don't have to keep looking
[1:34:58] over your shoulder don't worry about it
[1:35:00] as a father would want to give his
[1:35:02] children confidence that they that they
[1:35:04] they they've atoned for the wrong
[1:35:06] they've responded correctly and they
[1:35:09] doesn't isn't dangled over their head
[1:35:10] like you're going to get it any moment
[1:35:12] because you did this and they're in a
[1:35:14] compromised state he was them to feel as
[1:35:16] if they've been restored back to the
[1:35:17] right position so they could have
[1:35:19] confidence going forward I tell you one
[1:35:21] of the worst things about leadership and
[1:35:23] I've recognized it it's one of the most
[1:35:24] damaging things about the wrong kind of
[1:35:26] leadership is they keep you in a
[1:35:28] constant state of brokenness so you feel
[1:35:30] that you're always dependent upon their
[1:35:32] leadership and that's the wrong kind of
[1:35:34] leadership it's not leadership it's
[1:35:36] manipulation it's not leadership its
[1:35:38] control and it's abused to always make
[1:35:40] you feel broken so you always need their
[1:35:42] help to get fixed and Paul did not keep
[1:35:45] the cringes in this broken state he and
[1:35:47] they said look you've cleared yourself
[1:35:49] and then he says in verse 14 for I have
[1:35:51] boasted for if for if I have boasted
[1:35:54] anything to him he speaking about Titus
[1:35:57] if I boast and anything to him of you I
[1:36:00] am not ashamed so despite what he wrote
[1:36:04] the first time and despite whatever we
[1:36:06] might have thought about the Corinthians
[1:36:08] Paul is boasting of the Corinthians to
[1:36:10] Titus he says I'm not ashamed but as we
[1:36:12] spake all things to you in truth even so
[1:36:15] are boasting which I made before Titus
[1:36:17] is found a truth I have boasted if I
[1:36:20] boast anything to him about you I wasn't
[1:36:23] wrong if I bragged on you to Titus it
[1:36:27] was the truth and his inward affection
[1:36:30] is more abundant toward you whilst he
[1:36:32] remembered the obedience of you all how
[1:36:34] with fear and trembling you received him
[1:36:37] I rejoice therefore that I have
[1:36:39] confidence in you in all things don't
[1:36:43] you realize the Corinthians of all
[1:36:45] churches could have been the ones where
[1:36:47] the you know they you book of
[1:36:49] Corinthians look up the book of Coretta
[1:36:51] you look these are Corrections the book
[1:36:53] of Christie's these are letters of
[1:36:54] Correction to the Church of Corinth and
[1:36:56] they would always carry the scarlet
[1:36:57] letter
[1:36:58] emphasis always just pointing them look
[1:37:00] at what a Paul can teach us and he's had
[1:37:02] to correct you weren't being
[1:37:04] positionally placed here being corrected
[1:37:07] but he didn't leave him there
[1:37:09] he doesn't just leave him in this
[1:37:11] compromised State and I can't believe
[1:37:13] you let that kind of feel that has to
[1:37:14] take place in the church he says I
[1:37:16] rejoice that I have confidence in you in
[1:37:18] all things building up their courage
[1:37:22] building up their faith building up
[1:37:24] their position in Christ as a real
[1:37:26] father he's patting them on the back and
[1:37:28] even as they're whimpering and they're
[1:37:30] crying and they realized they did
[1:37:31] something wrong and they feel the shame
[1:37:32] he says oh no no there's no need for
[1:37:34] shame I've been bragging about you to
[1:37:36] Titus and maybe they thought well he was
[1:37:39] just he was probably lying too tight as
[1:37:41] they probably probably just wanted Titus
[1:37:42] to not be afraid to come over here he
[1:37:44] said no no I
[1:37:45] I'm bragged on him and it was the truth
[1:37:47] I didn't say anything I have to take
[1:37:50] back every motion I made about you
[1:37:52] before Titus is found a truth it's what
[1:37:54] he says he says and I want you to know I
[1:37:56] had a confidence in you in all things
[1:37:59] and that beautiful now that's
[1:38:02] destructive test his father's but
[1:38:04] remember that's how he feels about you
[1:38:06] that's how God feels about you first
[1:38:10] Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 11 will
[1:38:11] close with this scripture for we know
[1:38:14] how we exhorted and comforted and
[1:38:18] charged every one of you as a father
[1:38:21] death his children this is what he says
[1:38:23] a father does he absorbs he comforts he
[1:38:26] charges he says as the father death his
[1:38:30] church says I have done this as a father
[1:38:31] in the gospel and then this becomes
[1:38:33] instructive to us as father's we must
[1:38:35] exhort we must comfort we must charge to
[1:38:37] exhort to console to encourage to
[1:38:40] strengthen by consolation to strengthen
[1:38:42] by comfort using consolation and comfort
[1:38:45] we encourage them and we strengthen them
[1:38:48] he says we exhorted we comforted to use
[1:38:51] words to comfort it means to be
[1:38:53] alongside of speaking to use words to
[1:38:57] calm to use words to encourage and
[1:38:59] console and to address one whether by
[1:39:02] way of admonition and incentive hints to
[1:39:05] encourage or console' we are required as
[1:39:07] fathers to comfort
[1:39:09] to use words to calm to use our words to
[1:39:12] encourage them to consult to address
[1:39:14] them by way of admonition or even
[1:39:16] incentive give them incentive in other
[1:39:19] to encourage them or consultant
[1:39:21] sometimes we think well my love language
[1:39:24] is money i buy i buy i buy i buy i buy
[1:39:26] listen your children need to hear it
[1:39:28] hear from your own mouth these words to
[1:39:32] be alongside up with their arm random
[1:39:33] i'm proud of these son you're doing a
[1:39:35] good job to encourage them and in charge
[1:39:38] we absorb we comfort and we charge means
[1:39:40] to utter honorable testimony to give a
[1:39:43] good report I've charged you does it
[1:39:45] mean we think charge you've been charged
[1:39:47] with the crime no this is different
[1:39:49] even charged with an honorable testimony
[1:39:51] you've been given a good report we
[1:39:54] exhort we comfortably charge
[1:39:56] I'm giving you an honorable testimony
[1:39:57] I'm speaking well of you I'm telling you
[1:40:00] you're a good son you're doing a good
[1:40:02] job dad is proud of you the musicians
[1:40:08] were to come I just want to repeat again
[1:40:10] that statement that Brenda Brennan wrote
[1:40:11] in the church age book how beautifully
[1:40:14] the Savior praises and commences
[1:40:16] children I knows how to encourage us in
[1:40:19] the right matters and discourage us in
[1:40:22] the wrong matters we could all learn a
[1:40:24] good lesson right here running the
[1:40:26] church and our families Oh My isn't it
[1:40:29] wonderful to know this this is how God
[1:40:31] feels about us and it and it wonderful
[1:40:34] to know that it's what God wants us to
[1:40:38] do his father's my sons I wanted to do a
[1:40:42] better job as a dad I'm called to
[1:40:44] encourage you to exhort you to comfort
[1:40:47] you to charge you my daughter I want to
[1:40:49] do a better job as a dad I was going
[1:40:52] over these notes I was looking at these
[1:40:53] things I'm like II I feel like a
[1:40:55] hypocrite preaching it but I'm glad to
[1:40:58] preach it cuz I don't know if it's in
[1:41:00] the word it's in me
[1:41:02] and I say Amen to it I said Lord let me
[1:41:05] busy myself with my family let me care
[1:41:08] for my family like God cared over Israel
[1:41:10] could we all say that you never stop
[1:41:12] doing it this is how grandpa's feel
[1:41:14] about their there's their their
[1:41:16] grandchildren this is how this is how
[1:41:18] grandparents want to help encourage and
[1:41:20] facilitate their children's respect for
[1:41:22] their parents we're all working together
[1:41:24] this is what family's for there's people
[1:41:27] that will be a part of this church you
[1:41:28] don't have natural family and this
[1:41:30] church becomes that family they don't
[1:41:32] have because it functions like a family
[1:41:34] and within the family of God they take
[1:41:37] place as children and they recognize
[1:41:38] father figures and they have sisters and
[1:41:40] mother figures and that's how the body
[1:41:42] of the Christ should work so I myself
[1:41:44] today I'm saying Lord let this be so for
[1:41:46] me I humble myself to this I accepted we
[1:41:49] thank God for our natural fathers that
[1:41:51] he's given us the care that they had
[1:41:53] forced we thank God for his care for us
[1:41:55] in the love that he has for us let's
[1:41:57] stand why don't we just offer up a
[1:41:59] prayer of thanksgiving to God our Father
[1:42:02] for the great love that he has forced
[1:42:03] the care that he has for us and how he's
[1:42:06] manifested all these things for us and
[1:42:08] then submit ourselves he his parents and
[1:42:11] his father's today to be what he's asked
[1:42:14] us to be your gracious Heavenly Father
[1:42:15] Lord first we thank you for being a good
[1:42:19] father or there's a song out you're a
[1:42:22] good good father that's who you are
[1:42:24] it might be a catchy melody but Lord is
[1:42:26] the truth you're a good god you're a
[1:42:32] good father and Lord it can be said why
[1:42:35] would you allow how could a good God let
[1:42:38] this happen how could a good father let
[1:42:40] it that happen I say in all of it you're
[1:42:43] a good God you give and you take blessed
[1:42:47] be the name of the Lord
[1:42:48] father we accept our lot in life the
[1:42:51] path that you've taken us Lord even
[1:42:54] realizing there's some that might stand
[1:42:56] is grown men who looked back and had
[1:42:59] fathers who did not love them like you
[1:43:00] loved who did not care for them like you
[1:43:03] cared even some who may have been
[1:43:04] abandoned by their fathers and we
[1:43:07] realized yet through it all your love
[1:43:09] has been made known to us
[1:43:10] and your care has meant more to us than
[1:43:13] that of an earthly father and Lord as we
[1:43:17] stand here today offering Thanksgiving
[1:43:19] and praise to you for the love that you
[1:43:20] have for us the expression of fatherhood
[1:43:23] and care that's given to us by you we as
[1:43:27] men humble ourselves before you we
[1:43:28] desire to be the right kind of Father's
[1:43:33] Lord I might even speak for even my
[1:43:35] brother Mark who stands here Lord one
[1:43:37] day I know desiring to be a father to be
[1:43:39] married and have a shoujo but Lord may
[1:43:41] he also now recognize the great calling
[1:43:44] as a son what a great blessing he has in
[1:43:49] his father Lord he spoken highly of his
[1:43:51] his natural dad to me before Lord made
[1:43:54] this give him a greater respect for
[1:43:56] father his own father Lord made give him
[1:43:59] even a better understanding of how he
[1:44:02] can conduct himself as a son Lord for
[1:44:05] each one of us we yield ourselves to you
[1:44:07] as your children
[1:44:08] we reverence you as our father we heap
[1:44:10] our praise and our voice and our
[1:44:13] adoration upon you as a loving God and
[1:44:16] again father we humble ourselves before
[1:44:18] he was men desired to be the right kind
[1:44:22] of fathers for our children for brother
[1:44:24] John Lord is the pastor of this church
[1:44:27] Lord as he has always had taking great
[1:44:32] care to praise his children and to
[1:44:34] encourage them Lord I've learned so much
[1:44:37] from as a son-in-law now even his words
[1:44:41] towards his children are always
[1:44:43] affirming and encouraging lord I pray
[1:44:46] that you bless him for his labors in
[1:44:48] this church to always encourage them in
[1:44:50] the right things discourage them in the
[1:44:52] wrong things and Lord as we have said
[1:44:55] happy Father's Day to these men I pray
[1:44:57] that you bless them and bless them
[1:44:59] abundantly
[1:45:00] we commit them to you in the name of the
[1:45:02] Lord Jesus Christ a man with a grateful
[1:45:12] heart give face to the Holy One give
[1:45:19] thanks because he's given Jesus

[1:54:11] did
[1:54:14] hey man praise the Lord
[1:54:17] how many appreciated the word tonight
[1:54:20] today this morning you know I believe
[1:54:23] for every one of us there was something
[1:54:26] some instructions in there even just one
[1:54:29] on one brother and brother and and of
[1:54:33] course mothers and children anything
[1:54:36] about teaching anything about helping
[1:54:39] amen and I'll say like this it starts
[1:54:44] with the spirit you know people can read
[1:54:49] your spirit and there's times that you
[1:54:52] know we could be spiritually odd out of
[1:54:55] sync and not catch it but it starts with
[1:54:57] the spirit usually if the spirits there
[1:54:59] the words if the words don't make it the
[1:55:02] spirit will but we wouldn't want to have
[1:55:05] a relationship with the width of
[1:55:07] Heavenly Father never say I love you you
[1:55:11] want you want to say those words and you
[1:55:13] wanna express them amen
[1:55:15] I appreciated that message today and we
[1:55:20] needed that message today wanting you
[1:55:23] know there are so many things that we
[1:55:24] could talk about because I begin to
[1:55:25] study about the Father's Day message
[1:55:28] before I knew you know Aaron was coming
[1:55:31] and and what a great attribute to talk
[1:55:36] about to me about so many that we could
[1:55:39] happen just talking about the attribute
[1:55:41] of affirming to your children your love
[1:55:46] for them your ear ear not just your
[1:55:50] proud of them often I say that but but
[1:55:53] that you you think the best of them you
[1:55:57] you know just want the best of them you
[1:56:00] think the best of them and it was just
[1:56:03] yesterday and Jonathan had come over it
[1:56:07] just a thought it came over over me
[1:56:11] about him and just instant I began to
[1:56:13] cry and I had to turn night he was
[1:56:15] around he was he wasn't there in the
[1:56:17] same room but it just came and you know
[1:56:20] you just got love in your heart for your
[1:56:22] children the father has loved and his
[1:56:23] heart for his children
[1:56:25] and you know we we do need to create
[1:56:30] that atmosphere we have to we have to we
[1:56:33] have to we can't expect God to always
[1:56:37] come and a bunch of when his children
[1:56:40] are all droopy and sad remember when he
[1:56:41] came to those that were walking too
[1:56:42] amazed he says why are you so sad
[1:56:44] walking the way you are you know we've
[1:56:47] got to create that atmosphere where he
[1:56:48] desires to dwell in so that that that
[1:56:51] healthiness of a family can function
[1:56:54] right right if there's a child in the in
[1:56:57] the in the home acting depressed well
[1:57:00] you got to help them out of that and you
[1:57:03] got to get the atmosphere for going so I
[1:57:05] just think this is a wonderful message
[1:57:06] it gives us so much to work on amen and
[1:57:10] to build our families and our families
[1:57:13] what we are in our homes we common were
[1:57:15] a conglomeration of here and so the more

[2:01:08] brother
[2:01:15] and put this little presentation
[2:01:18] together and I just want to read for you
[2:01:19] guys how truly much we appreciate all
[2:01:21] your father's in the church and on your
[2:01:23] mother's and we're like fathers as well
[2:01:24] and just thank you for all you do we're
[2:01:26] truly blessed and you know words can't
[2:01:28] even describe how blessed we are
[2:01:29] and I start with Psalms 127 3 through 5
[2:01:33] low children are inherited of the Lord
[2:01:35] and the fruit of the womb is his reward
[2:01:37] as arrows are in the hand of a mighty
[2:01:40] man soar the children of the youth happy
[2:01:42] is the man to have his quiver full of
[2:01:44] them they shall not be ashamed then
[2:01:46] we'll jump to Genesis 18:19
[2:01:48] for I know him that he will command his
[2:01:50] children and his household after him and
[2:01:53] they shall keep the way of the Lord to
[2:01:54] do justice and judgment and then
[2:01:57] proverbs 22:6 train up a child in the
[2:02:00] way he should go and when he is old he
[2:02:02] will not depart from it proverbs 27 the
[2:02:06] just man walketh in his integrity and
[2:02:07] his children are blessed after him
[2:02:09] proverbs 4 1 here you children the
[2:02:12] instruction of a father and attend to no
[2:02:14] understanding not read a quote from
[2:02:16] brother branham I think that's a very
[2:02:18] fine example for parents today it's an
[2:02:21] example before our children
[2:02:22] now you'll live your best and your worst
[2:02:25] at home and I think that our lives
[2:02:27] though the children might not exactly
[2:02:29] just act like they're noticing it but
[2:02:31] they are noticing it don't you ever
[2:02:33] think that they're not because they're
[2:02:34] watching not only the children are
[2:02:37] watching but the neighbors are watching
[2:02:38] none of the neighbors are watching but
[2:02:40] all that you're associated with watching
[2:02:42] the people at your church watching the
[2:02:44] people that you do business with in the
[2:02:45] markets they are watching you after your
[2:02:48] confession we should always try to
[2:02:49] reflect Christ and everything that we do
[2:02:51] that's from 1960 301 1 to influence
[2:02:56] thank you all for your father's for your
[2:02:58] impact on your children's lives
[2:03:00] we appreciate your guided leadership and
[2:03:01] all the effort of me through the years
[2:03:03] to take care of us and provide for us
[2:03:05] thank you for praying for your children
[2:03:06] and for shining the light even though
[2:03:09] this even though this dark age that we
[2:03:11] live in we often said that anyone could
[2:03:13] be a father but it takes someone special
[2:03:15] to be a dad and even beyond that to be a
[2:03:17] godly dad and hold a Christian standard
[2:03:19] in a lost and dying world
[2:03:21] choosing to live a Christian life before
[2:03:23] your children will be the greatest thing
[2:03:24] you could ever
[2:03:25] do for them so thank you for the bottom
[2:03:27] of my heart for being godly men and
[2:03:28] raising your families of pattern and
[2:03:30] gallery influence and I'm just thankful
[2:03:31] for all your father's even when I was
[2:03:33] out in the world you got still praying
[2:03:35] for me and still trying to draw me in
[2:03:37] you know I'd like to say that I'm very
[2:03:40] thankful and wasn't for your prayers I
[2:03:41] would not be here today as the man that
[2:03:44] I am and I have so much more growing to
[2:03:46] do and I'm so far from where I have to
[2:03:48] be but I'm thankful that His grace is
[2:03:50] keeping all of us and this one's been
[2:03:52] happy Father's Day to all your dad's and
[2:03:54] I hope you enjoy the day and not just
