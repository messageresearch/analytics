[43:19] him saying lord save us we perish
[43:23] and he said unto him why are ye fearful
[43:26] oh ye of little faith
[43:29] then he arose and rebuked the winds in
[43:30] the sea and there was a great calm
[43:34] but

[43:56] today and forever
[43:58] not just it's because it's on the
[43:59] tabernacle it's because it's in the
[44:01] bible this morning not because it's in
[44:03] jeffersonville and the tabernacle says
[44:05] we are he is the same yesterday today
[44:07] forever it's because the prophet of god
[44:09] had the word of god and he and that was
[44:11] his absolute this morning the word of
[44:14] god he says he'll never leave us or
[44:16] forsake us he said that heavens and
[44:18] earth will pass away but my word shall
[44:20] not so i want to be basting basking in
[44:24] his presence always in the word of god
[44:26] amen amen
[44:28] says the mighty conqueror he says oh
[44:30] satan tried and tried again to do
[44:32] everything one night laying on the back
[44:34] of the ship he said seen him asleep and
[44:37] he said oh i'll destroy him right now
[44:40] but he couldn't
[44:41] he tried to tip him into doing the wrong
[44:43] thing but he couldn't do it he said why
[44:47] he said he'd been sprayed with a
[44:49] repellent a predestination
[44:52] and i want to tell you this morning

[45:45] involved in storms we we create our own
[45:48] storms
[45:49] but i tell you god wants to be your calm

[46:02] deceived he said no no the word said
[46:05] he'll be here amen there ain't no devil
[46:08] going to bother him no other son of god
[46:11] that's predestinated to take his place
[46:14] he is sprayed with a propellant
[46:16] satan's poison denomination doctors
[46:19] don't even touch him at all he moves
[46:21] right along nothing going to bother him
[46:24] see
[46:24] he's a man he was laying out there on
[46:27] the ship that night it floated around
[46:30] ten thousand devils on the sea swore
[46:33] that they would drown him
[46:35] think about it
[46:36] that little old ship bobbing up and down
[46:39] like a border bottle stopper the devil
[46:41] says i got him now he's a laying there
[46:44] he's a he said he's asleep laying there

[46:53] sick until he couldn't can't move
[46:56] he said he was a man he said when he was
[46:59] laying there asleep that's true
[47:01] he said but when he put his foot on the
[47:03] braille of the bolt he looked up and
[47:06] said peace be still
[47:08] that's more than a man that was god
[47:11] speaking out of the sign hallelujah he
[47:14] said it's true he was a man that night
[47:16] laying in the back of the little boat
[47:18] on the stormy sea he said the little
[47:20] boat was tossed about like a little
[47:23] bottle stopper and ten thousand devils
[47:25] of the sea had swore they would drown
[47:27] them he was tired he was a man he was
[47:30] laying on the back of the boat he said
[47:31] but when he arose
[47:33] he walked forward he put his foot on the
[47:35] brow of the bolt and looked up towards
[47:37] heaven and said peace be still
[47:40] and the winds and the waves obeyed them
[47:43] he said that was more than a man
[47:44] speaking there that was the great mighty
[47:47] conqueror
[47:48] he said he spoke to the wind and it went
[47:51] to the cave like a puppy dog
[47:54] oh he spoke to the wind and it went to
[47:56] the cave like a puppy dog
[47:59] i love how brother brown just brings it
[48:00] down to just
[48:02] it seventh age uh great education
[48:04] because it'd be over my head

[48:12] folded their hands in perfect rest upon
[48:16] the sea bosom

[52:13] school bus one time my dad just a little
[52:15] bit about us we actually grew up in
[52:18] toledo ohio as a kid and now we were
[52:20] coming through there brother john
[52:21] lafontaine's the other day rachel was
[52:23] working on their cd and i said thank you
[52:25] lord for your saving grace
[52:27] dad dropped me off on the highway right
[52:29] there and said son i never want to see
[52:31] you i went walking for miles but i tell
[52:33] you god still had his calm hand on me
[52:36] and you guys just calm him on you this
[52:38] morning every storm every trial every
[52:41] temptation you're going through i'm
[52:43] telling you he's the calm to your storm
[52:47] but look what he said
[52:48] verse 25 and his disciples came and
[52:50] walked him saying lord save us or we
[52:52] perish have you think about disciples
[52:55] have been with them they've done this
[52:56] they've seen every miracle and they're
[52:58] ever here shaking to death if you ask
[53:01] you ask peter james john you asked all
[53:03] these disciples where's your faith i bet
[53:05] you before the storm they'd say we love
[53:06] jesus christ
[53:08] we we think about it we we've been with
[53:11] them we're not scared of anything we got
[53:13] jesus on our side i'm going to sound
[53:15] like us this morning we're like oh we so
[53:18] big and then the next day on monday so
[53:20] the storm starts erasing
[53:23] the storms start to raging on monday and
[53:26] tuesday and my wednesday comes you go oh
[53:29] well i was all talk and the devil knows
[53:32] that sometimes we all talk but i tell
[53:34] you he said when the weakest christian
[53:36] gets on their knees the devil trembles
[53:38] imagine you if you're prayed up and you
[53:41] trust god and you believe jesus christ i
[53:44] believe it you get on your hands and
[53:45] knees and you start praying i tell you
[53:47] next can you imagine what it trembles
[53:49] with satan this morning
[53:53] and he said to him why are you fearful i
[53:55] could imagine i mean he i i would say he
[53:58] would say the same thing imagine you and
[54:00] your son and you gave him all this and
[54:02] you've done this and you've been through
[54:03] all this and you gave him whatever and
[54:05] he questions you
[54:07] you i do the same thing with my boys why
[54:10] why are you doing this son you know how
[54:12] i am
[54:13] it's the life behind the name amen
[54:16] i don't have to sit here about being
[54:18] behind this pulpit this morning i told
[54:20] rachel another boy said that i said it's
[54:21] about five percent behind this it's 95
[54:24] percent i'd say it's probably more than
[54:26] that it's probably the opposite because
[54:27] it's more of a life behind the name it's
[54:30] behind closed doors of how you live it's
[54:32] not because you just can't say some good
[54:34] words this morning it's about living for
[54:36] jesus christ
[54:39] and he said why are you though fearful
[54:41] he's questioned then he arose and you
[54:43] broke the winds and he's he's a c and
[54:45] there was a great call there was a great
[54:48] calm but i love what he says
[54:50] he said he went there he says in the
[54:52] verse 24 he says a great tempest but i'm
[54:55] glad when there's a great tempest
[54:56] there's a great call
[54:58] when there's a great tempest in your
[55:00] life there's a great calm to call on
[55:03] and i'll tell you you need to try to
[55:04] call them up my wife sings that song
[55:06] call them up tell them what you want i
[55:08] think sometimes we don't tell them
[55:10] enough what we want
[55:12] problems said ask for big things
[55:14] he said he likes your children to ask
[55:16] for big things he said sister rebecca
[55:18] would get in his lap and he said daddy
[55:20] show me your muscles
[55:23] he said i felt all old and ready he said

[56:12] of god but i tell you i love the word of
[56:13] god i love jesus christ i love this
[56:16] message

[57:00] praying over you
[57:02] it might not be someone in your family
[57:04] this morning whatever it is that's been
[57:05] praying for you and trusting in you
[57:08] saying hey if you've got a wayward child
[57:09] this morning i don't care if you got a
[57:11] wayward child in this world he says your
[57:13] inheritance is yours this morning okay
[57:16] it's time to pick our heads up the devil
[57:18] wants to tell you lies and brother brown
[57:20] says we accept the lies we accept this
[57:23] package this morning this ain't amazon
[57:25] this morning i tell you why you need to
[57:27] trust god trust jesus trust his word
[57:29] this morning put all your faith in jesus
[57:32] christ so every storm you're going
[57:33] through this morning trust him with all
[57:35] you got in you
[57:37] i tell you it might be feeling stormy
[57:39] out there you look on the you look on
[57:40] every app you look on the news stations
[57:42] it wants to drown your sorrows make you
[57:45] feel like your dog died your wife died
[57:48] your animals died but i tell you get in
[57:50] the word of god and it will lift you to
[57:52] higher places higher places that you can
[57:54] walk that you can swim whatever you have
[57:57] need is in jesus christ
[58:00] but i'm glad he says he was a great
[58:02] great temptus but there was a great kong
[58:05] and it wonderful when you're going
[58:06] through a great tempest there's a great
[58:08] calm for you
[58:10] i'm so great now in the greatest tempest
[58:12] he is our great calm
[58:14] but the man marveled saying the matter
[58:16] of this man even the winds and sea obey
[58:18] him so why is we as the bride of christ
[58:21] we get so
[58:22] burnt out and tired and weary and we get
[58:24] so depressed about going through
[58:26] situations but he said this is there to
[58:28] shape us
[58:30] it's there he said they're more precious
[58:32] than gold the word of god says they're
[58:34] more precious than gold so when i get up
[58:36] and i'm going through trials and
[58:37] tribulations and tomorrow they'll be
[58:39] fighting me left and right but i tell
[58:41] you i say lord i'll still serve you if
[58:43] you take this you think about job he
[58:46] said you speak like a foolish woman she
[58:48] said curse god he said you speak like a
[58:50] first he knew where his rest was
[58:54] he knew where his rest
[58:56] if you turn over to mark
[58:58] i was thinking about these storms this
[59:00] morning
[59:02] turn over the mark
[59:06] mark four
[59:08] praise the lord
[59:12] mark for another storm it's all these
[59:14] they're all writing all all three of
[59:15] them writing about different storms in a
[59:18] different angle
[59:19] look
[59:20] in the saint verse 35 4 35
[59:24] and the same day when the evening was
[59:26] come he has said let us pass over to the
[59:29] other side
[59:31] and when he sent away the multitude he
[59:33] took him
[59:34] even
[59:35] excuse me as he was in the ship
[59:38] and there was also with him with other
[59:41] little ships
[59:42] and there rose a great storm
[59:44] of wind and the waves beat into the ship
[59:47] so that it was now full think about that
[59:50] his boat was full do you feel like you
[59:52] came to church this morning your boat's
[59:54] full your life's full of troubles and
[59:56] jowl and sorrow but you know what you
[59:58] can empty that boat out this morning you
[1:00:00] can there's a drain plug you can pull
[1:00:02] out this morning there's a drain plug
[1:00:04] inside that you can pull out and leave
[1:00:06] your cares at this altar this morning
[1:00:08] there's a drain point i tell you i think
[1:00:10] sometimes we need to forget the drain
[1:00:12] plug we need to forget it pull it out
[1:00:14] and say lord drain my life
[1:00:17] but i tell you sometimes we get in the
[1:00:19] midst of the storm we do forget the
[1:00:20] drain plugs we let the devil just start
[1:00:22] filling our life up we start filling
[1:00:24] with cares of this world and things of
[1:00:27] the world but i tell you god says
[1:00:29] greater is he that's in us than he
[1:00:31] that's in the world
[1:00:32] amen
[1:00:33] but verse 4 he says 37 and there arose a
[1:00:36] great okay here he's speaking again
[1:00:39] here goes from another angle and it rose
[1:00:41] a great storm
[1:00:43] of the wind that waves it beat into the
[1:00:44] ship so it was now full
[1:00:47] and one and he was in the hinder part of
[1:00:49] the ship
[1:00:50] asleep on a pillow
[1:00:53] think about that this morning
[1:00:55] i sound silly this morning but i like my
[1:00:57] pillow
[1:00:58] i lay down i said lord you like a pillow
[1:01:01] i like a pillow too
[1:01:03] praise god i know it was pretty funny
[1:01:05] pretty simple this morning but i tell
[1:01:07] you he was asleep on the pillow
[1:01:10] this big old storage coming along and
[1:01:12] he's on his he's on this temporary
[1:01:15] pillow just lay there
[1:01:16] praise god
[1:01:18] because he he's the master of all the
[1:01:19] storms
[1:01:21] he knew about the storm he knew about
[1:01:23] your storm he knew about your situation
[1:01:25] this morning before you woke up this
[1:01:27] morning he knew who you were going to be
[1:01:29] here this morning
[1:01:31] he said he was in the hinder part of
[1:01:32] sleep on the pillow
[1:01:34] and they alone came and said master
[1:01:37] cares now now we perish and he arose and
[1:01:40] rebuked the wind and said unto them
[1:01:41] peace be still
[1:01:43] and the wind ceased and there was a
[1:01:45] great calm i tell you there was a take
[1:01:47] about verse 37 said there was a great
[1:01:49] storm in verse 39 it said there was a
[1:01:52] great call
[1:01:53] and i'll tell you guards you might have
[1:01:55] a great storm but there's a great calm
[1:01:57] for your storm this morning that's jesus
[1:01:59] christ it ain't me it ain't what i can
[1:02:01] bring a brother john it's jesus christ
[1:02:03] that can calm your storm you've got a
[1:02:05] great great storm give him the great
[1:02:07] calm
[1:02:09] and he said unto them why are you so why
[1:02:12] are you so fearful how is it that you
[1:02:14] have no faith
[1:02:15] and they feared exceedingly and said
[1:02:17] unto another what manner of man is this
[1:02:19] and the wind and then we'll see obey
[1:02:21] them let's turn over to luke and see
[1:02:23] what he had to say
[1:02:24] luke 8
[1:02:27] 22
[1:02:28] it said now it came to pass on a certain
[1:02:30] day they went to the ship with his
[1:02:32] disciples and he said unto him let us go
[1:02:34] over and to the other side of the lake
[1:02:37] and they launched forth
[1:02:39] but as they sailed he fell asleep
[1:02:42] he keep everywhere he looked he's
[1:02:44] falling asleep
[1:02:46] well now my wife knows hey when i'm
[1:02:48] resting and i'm tired and i'm weary she
[1:02:50] said honey don't don't let chris sit
[1:02:52] down because if he sits down one minute
[1:02:53] he's out he's out he'll hear no storms
[1:02:57] the stars could be raging tornado can
[1:02:59] rip the house off and i'm still sleeping
[1:03:01] rachel could be up don't matter she
[1:03:04] opened the windows open the doors i
[1:03:06] don't matter if the thief could come in
[1:03:08] we'd still be asleep i would be
[1:03:10] because i tell you i believe there's a
[1:03:12] great calm to my storm when i go to
[1:03:15] sleep and we read our bible we pray and
[1:03:17] we claim that we say lord forgive us of
[1:03:19] everything god we cleanse our lives
[1:03:22] because our heartbreak could stop in the
[1:03:24] morning right and i believe that brother
[1:03:26] says when we get down to the river and
[1:03:28] he says the devil could take us all the
[1:03:29] way down to the river of death he said
[1:03:31] but now after that it's god's time
[1:03:34] he takes us from death and to life
[1:03:37] and i tell you that's why i sleep like a
[1:03:38] baby because when i'm out i'm out and
[1:03:41] rachel's like i don't know what's the
[1:03:42] storm's coming on but i tell you he's a
[1:03:44] great con to your storm
[1:03:47] a great calm
[1:03:49] but like we said now kate bliss go verse
[1:03:52] 23 but as they sailed he fell asleep and
[1:03:54] they came down the storm of wind on the
[1:03:56] lake
[1:03:57] and they were filled with water and they
[1:03:59] were in jeopardy
[1:04:00] and they came and they woke him saying
[1:04:02] master master we perish
[1:04:04] then he arose and rebuked the wind and
[1:04:06] he raging of the water and they ceased
[1:04:08] and there was a con
[1:04:10] and he said where is your faith
[1:04:12] everything was linked to their faith
[1:04:14] everything he said you came and pleased
[1:04:16] god without having faith you can't
[1:04:18] hebrews 11. it's all based on faith
[1:04:21] abraham had faith
[1:04:23] all of them had faith that all they all
[1:04:25] throughout history noah had faith every
[1:04:28] one of them had faith in god because
[1:04:29] when he tells us to do something they
[1:04:31] did it they believed god they took god
[1:04:33] at his word
[1:04:36] i'll tell you but you know what i was
[1:04:37] thinking this morning as i was studying
[1:04:38] last night late until late hours i was
[1:04:41] thinking jesus i said you know what even
[1:04:43] if you're in my boat
[1:04:45] even if you're in my boat we're still
[1:04:47] going through storms

[1:08:01] great trial

[1:08:07] he's shaping us
[1:08:09] but i'm glad that jesus went through the
[1:08:11] storm with him
[1:08:13] i'm glad he didn't jump out of the boat
[1:08:14] and run off

[1:09:31] all the time the devil wants to take
[1:09:33] their minds and their kids i don't know
[1:09:35] why i'm saying this tomorrow but i'm
[1:09:37] telling you they want to take us the
[1:09:38] devil wants to take their minds and wrap
[1:09:40] it in video games and things of the
[1:09:42] world but i'm telling you limit that
[1:09:44] stuff
[1:09:45] limit that stuff they can spend an hour
[1:09:46] on the game they can spend an hour in
[1:09:48] the bible

[1:09:53] tell you limit it
[1:09:54] and see what god will do
[1:09:57] but he always said i remember saying he
[1:09:58] was saying gi joe

[1:10:02] now you know and no one's half the
[1:10:04] battle

[1:10:09] you know what the truth my wife sings a
[1:10:10] song about the truth and i tell you we
[1:10:13] know what the truth is this morning and
[1:10:15] we know and knowings half the battle i
[1:10:17] believe we just take what we know and we
[1:10:19] take the word of god with brother we
[1:10:21] could the bible take the word it'll
[1:10:23] affect satan any place anywhere any time
[1:10:31] so tossed about 1956
[1:10:34] he said let the storms rage he said my
[1:10:36] anchor holds with the veil
[1:10:38] can't tell you why he said we have a lot
[1:10:41] of storms on the seas this day but i'm
[1:10:43] thankful for an anchor that holds
[1:10:45] steadfast within the veil
[1:10:48] oh he said when she's rocking and she
[1:10:50] looks like every move would send her to
[1:10:52] the bottom yet my anchor is in the veil
[1:10:56] he said i'm anchored in the bell i'm
[1:10:57] anchored in jesus the storms of life i
[1:11:00] brave i'm anchored in jesus i fear no
[1:11:02] wind or wave i'm anchored in jesus for
[1:11:05] he have power to save i'm anchored in
[1:11:07] the rock of ages
[1:11:09] amen
[1:11:11] oh church yeah i'm telling you young
[1:11:12] kids you'll realize you start having
[1:11:14] aches and pains and this and that i'm
[1:11:15] maybe not not that old but i tell you
[1:11:17] start to realize lord you need more
[1:11:18] jesus more than you think you do
[1:11:22] i say lord every to every breath i get
[1:11:24] every now every next day devil i get up
[1:11:26] out of the bed i say lord here i'm
[1:11:28] coming for you
[1:11:29] devil we're going to fight again but i
[1:11:31] tell you what i'm coming after you
[1:11:36] brother baby said jesus meeting his
[1:11:37] brother in 1956
[1:11:39] he said when the sea was blowing and
[1:11:41] storming did you ever i guess maybe some
[1:11:43] of you has never been privileged to see
[1:11:45] a ship anchored oh my i wrote them when
[1:11:48] they when they throwed out the sea
[1:11:50] anchor like that until he said until the
[1:11:52] little craft couldn't even go over the
[1:11:54] top of the wave he said it wouldn't go
[1:11:57] through the wave he said but as long as
[1:11:59] the anchor held that's all it makes any
[1:12:01] difference
[1:12:03] he said whether we go over it under it
[1:12:05] around it or through it doesn't matter
[1:12:08] the anchor holds
[1:12:11] he said that's the way when storm of ice
[1:12:13] begins to shake us he said we may have
[1:12:15] to go through he said we may have to go
[1:12:17] over we may have to go under or around
[1:12:20] it he said but just let the anchor hole
[1:12:23] within the veil to the unseen
[1:12:25] we just they said we don't know just
[1:12:28] exactly where it is at but it's it's a
[1:12:30] holding
[1:12:31] just like the little boy he said you
[1:12:33] know he said that kite oh i love this
[1:12:35] right
[1:12:36] he said you heard the old proverb the
[1:12:38] story said oh how do you know that the
[1:12:40] coyote he said there's a kite on the end
[1:12:43] of there he said i can feel it talking
[1:12:46] i talked about that last night i heard
[1:12:48] him say that he said oh the little boy
[1:12:50] is walking can you imagine i was just
[1:12:52] sitting in there i'd say i know my wife
[1:12:54] was probably tossing because i was
[1:12:55] traveling on hallelujah last night he
[1:12:57] said i just see him flying the kite he
[1:12:59] said i couldn't see the kite but i could
[1:13:01] feel it tugging have you felt god
[1:13:03] talking your life lately have you felt
[1:13:06] god in your storm i'll tell you
[1:13:08] sometimes just pulling the kite when
[1:13:10] you're going through hard times pick it
[1:13:12] up and just say lord are you still there
[1:13:14] and he says hey i'm still there he says
[1:13:16] i might be asleep in your boat but they
[1:13:19] call me on the scene
[1:13:23] he said if you feel it still tugging
[1:13:25] god's dealing with your hearts
[1:13:27] oh he said then we know our anchor still
[1:13:30] holds
[1:13:34] praise god
[1:13:35] 1961 revelation chapter 5.
[1:13:38] he said but now he said they've been
[1:13:40] through all these years until now we
[1:13:41] have the earnest of our inheritance
[1:13:44] he said oh my what do we have we have an
[1:13:46] evidence that god lives
[1:13:48] we have the evidence that god is with us
[1:13:51] we have the evidence that god has not
[1:13:53] forsaken us that we are his and he is
[1:13:56] ours
[1:13:58] praise god he said we're anchored in
[1:14:00] christ he said now the trees don't have
[1:14:02] to have to he said don't have it nature
[1:14:05] doesn't have it but yet we are still
[1:14:07] groaning with him because as yet we we
[1:14:10] haven't received the fullness of our
[1:14:11] adoption
[1:14:13] you know what we're going through storms
[1:14:15] we're going through trials and i want to
[1:14:16] hear you this morning i'll tell you what
[1:14:19] we need to trust in jesus christ
[1:14:21] trust in every storm every battle every
[1:14:24] situation every family every marital
[1:14:26] problem i don't care what you got this
[1:14:28] morning there ain't nothing too great
[1:14:30] for god i tell you he'll create you be
[1:14:32] your calm to your greats
[1:14:36] but we had the earnest of it he said
[1:14:38] we're picked up from the things of the
[1:14:39] world and now become sons and daughters
[1:14:42] of god
[1:14:43] i tell you i love coming around message
[1:14:44] believers because i told my wife i was
[1:14:47] telling everybody everywhere we travel
[1:14:49] they're the cream of the crop
[1:14:51] they're the cream of the crop
[1:14:53] the way they act the way they talk the
[1:14:55] way they carry themselves you know what
[1:14:56] it's because jesus truly lives on the
[1:14:58] inside
[1:15:00] it's because it ain't just a
[1:15:01] denomination spirit it's what cause the
[1:15:03] lord jesus christ reigns and i tell you
[1:15:06] you need to let him reign more in your
[1:15:08] life and they'll release the storms that
[1:15:10] are in your life and the cares and when
[1:15:12] the kids get sick and things of the
[1:15:15] lives carries we start franking and the
[1:15:17] first thing we do is start worrying
[1:15:19] about this and worry about that when we
[1:15:21] should just put our hands and just say
[1:15:23] lord calm this storm
[1:15:25] calm the storm
[1:15:28] i love cursed peter 4
[1:15:31] 12 and 13.
[1:15:32] he said beloved think it's not strange
[1:15:34] concerning the fiery
[1:15:36] trial which is try you
[1:15:38] as though some strange that happened
[1:15:40] unto you but rejoice
[1:15:42] oh that's hard to do
[1:15:45] but it but rejoices so much as you
[1:15:47] partakers of christ's sufferings
[1:15:49] that when his glory shall be revealed
[1:15:52] you may be glad also in exceedingly joy
[1:15:55] amen
[1:15:56] oh he said rejoice
[1:15:58] when you're going through storms you're
[1:16:00] going through trials can you imagine he
[1:16:02] tells you the opposite right instead of
[1:16:04] being down and out he tells you to
[1:16:06] rejoice
[1:16:07] amen because you know god is still
[1:16:08] working with you

[1:16:13] school right in this this uh this verse
[1:16:16] the unchangeable god working in an
[1:16:18] unexpectable way 1962.
[1:16:20] he said when god makes a promise on the
[1:16:22] opposite he said he said he makes a
[1:16:24] promise that's only test you whether you
[1:16:27] really got the word or not

[1:16:31] said got good gold don't mind going to
[1:16:34] testing stone
[1:16:38] he said when he's got good gold he wants
[1:16:40] to test it he wants to rub on it and see
[1:16:43] how it shines
[1:16:45] i said that brother brandon say that he
[1:16:48] said that's true he says see only at
[1:16:50] peter said i believe it was that these
[1:16:52] trials are come to test us he said try
[1:16:55] us see what we'll do with it that's
[1:16:58] right he said when you get the holy

[1:17:04] make you leave home these things don't

[1:21:15] permission
[1:21:18] can you think about it the devil asked
[1:21:20] him for permission so when he's messing
[1:21:23] with you this morning and you're going
[1:21:25] through his trials he has to walk up to
[1:21:27] him and say lord can i mess with his
[1:21:29] sister this morning can i mess with
[1:21:31] brother john this morning can i do this
[1:21:33] because he asked for permission from god

[1:21:41] problem here there's a hedge of

[1:22:07] we're supposed to be bible believing
[1:22:10] saints that believe everything from
[1:22:11] genesis to revelation
[1:22:14] to trust what the prophet said was true
[1:22:16] i'll tell you they questioned the cloud
[1:22:18] they questioned it i said look brother
[1:22:20] brown said 99 is a lie i said well just

[1:23:22] he said the lord jesus thou found an
[1:23:23] exhaustible fountain life he said flows
[1:23:26] through us today
[1:23:28] lord cleanse us from all unbelief in all
[1:23:30] sin
[1:23:32] that we might be able to stand in that
[1:23:34] presence
[1:23:35] knowing that there is no need there is a
[1:23:37] need among us he said we know that we
[1:23:39] are sinners not worthy of any blessing
[1:23:43] i thought about last night's her cry
[1:23:45] i said lord i don't receive i i i'm a
[1:23:47] sinner saved by grace
[1:23:49] by the way you called me from a broke up
[1:23:51] home in the baptist church
[1:23:54] that you called me to the truth amen
[1:23:57] i said lord if you don't do anything for
[1:23:58] me i'll still love you lord reverend
[1:24:00] save you send my soul to hell i'll still
[1:24:02] serve you
[1:24:04] and honestly i struggled with that for
[1:24:06] years
[1:24:06] but now i really have that heart praise
[1:24:09] god after many years of studying and
[1:24:11] praying and seeking god now i know why
[1:24:14] brother brown says it because when you
[1:24:15] fall in love with jesus
[1:24:17] when you love him more than your wife
[1:24:19] when you love him more than your kids
[1:24:21] when you love him more than material
[1:24:23] things you say lord even whatever you do
[1:24:26] with me lord i still love you lord hell
[1:24:29] couldn't handle you this morning if you
[1:24:31] truly love jesus christ if you sent your
[1:24:33] soul to hell he knew he couldn't handle
[1:24:35] you
[1:24:36] because you loved jesus christ so much
[1:24:38] it would ooze out it would stop every
[1:24:40] flame if you think about the hebrew
[1:24:42] children this morning you don't think
[1:24:43] they went through a fire you don't think
[1:24:45] they went through a trial well i love
[1:24:47] what he said they said they brought them
[1:24:49] up there and that never knezer brought
[1:24:50] the boys up there he said put them in
[1:24:52] that put them in there he said
[1:24:54] he said they want to serve my gods he
[1:24:56] said i want to serve their gods and he
[1:24:58] said well guess what i heat it seven
[1:25:00] times hotter
[1:25:02] i'm paraphrasing time tonight this
[1:25:03] morning but he said he hit seven times
[1:25:05] on he said they got him up to there and
[1:25:07] he said the guard in the bible says the
[1:25:09] guardian there it is he said the guards
[1:25:11] were dying they couldn't throw them in
[1:25:13] but you know what i love what god does
[1:25:15] for us he said when two or three are
[1:25:17] gathered he's in our midst and i tell
[1:25:20] you he knew not to throw them one by one
[1:25:22] in the fire he knew that he had to throw
[1:25:25] three of him in the fire because he said
[1:25:27] if he either threw one in the fire he
[1:25:29] wouldn't have came on his word
[1:25:31] think about it this morning
[1:25:33] he said when two or three are together
[1:25:34] but when he threw all three of them in
[1:25:36] that's his problem if he was smart he
[1:25:38] would have threw one and wanted one at a
[1:25:40] time because he couldn't honor his word
[1:25:44] so he threw them all in there but you
[1:25:46] know what in the storm jesus christ was
[1:25:48] already in the fire in the flames
[1:25:50] cooling it up before they arrived
[1:25:55] think about it he's in your boat this
[1:25:57] morning he's laying on a pillow
[1:26:01] i don't know what's that thing called mr
[1:26:02] pillow he's laying on mr pillow this
[1:26:04] morning
[1:26:08] we just need to wake him up amen
[1:26:10] we just need to wake him up
[1:26:13] have you woke him up lately
[1:26:15] have you woke him up in your life
[1:26:17] and your marriage and the way your work
[1:26:20] wherever you have have you woke him up
[1:26:24] he said but then when we think of him oh
[1:26:27] he came and looked at us took our sins
[1:26:29] and with his blood there he said oh it's
[1:26:31] not us in their presence of god it's him
[1:26:34] just our voice through his blood
[1:26:36] his blood speaking aren't you thankful
[1:26:38] that his blood speaks it's like cain and
[1:26:41] abel abel kill uh canaan cain killed
[1:26:43] abel he said where did you put him his
[1:26:45] blood speaks but i'll tell you think
[1:26:47] about if his blood speaks what the blood
[1:26:50] of christ speaks this morning oh it
[1:26:52] speaks volumes this morning the blood
[1:26:54] that shed on calvary this morning he'll
[1:26:56] cover every situation every storm every
[1:26:59] trial you got this morning i tell you
[1:27:02] speaking this morning
[1:27:05] he said oh god then cleanse our hearts
[1:27:07] from sin and unbelief
[1:27:09] give us the desires our heart for we
[1:27:11] truly have the desires to serve you
[1:27:14] oh that was my prayer
[1:27:15] in these awakening conditions weakening
[1:27:18] conditions afflictions and things of the
[1:27:20] world that's put upon us oh i tell you i
[1:27:22] love this message i told rachel i said
[1:27:24] it's more current than the newspaper
[1:27:26] i don't need that junk throw that junk
[1:27:28] away give me a message book
[1:27:29] give me something to tell me about the
[1:27:31] world falling apart
[1:27:33] he said we've been told that we think
[1:27:35] that it's not strange to think of these
[1:27:37] trials come he said there's only he said
[1:27:39] there's only working out for our good
[1:27:42] it's true he said to he said and to
[1:27:44] perfect perfect us bring us into that
[1:27:47] place these great deserts of experience
[1:27:50] where righteous men are molded into
[1:27:52] saints
[1:27:55] oh he said and when the burdens are so
[1:27:57] heavy we can't go far no farther then we
[1:28:00] raise our hands and scream to our father
[1:28:02] then hear from heaven lord kill us make
[1:28:05] us as well for the kingdom of god's sake
[1:28:08] the masterpiece
[1:28:10] the masterpiece you think about it this
[1:28:12] morning
[1:28:13] brother brandon was sitting there in
[1:28:14] that bed i tell you know what the devil
[1:28:15] wants to lie to us in our storms
[1:28:19] he wants to tell you you're not saved
[1:28:21] i'm telling you he fights me too yeah
[1:28:23] it's the same devil that fights me and
[1:28:25] fights you just because i'm up here
[1:28:27] speaking this morning doesn't mean he
[1:28:28] come to my house
[1:28:30] he comes to every one of our house
[1:28:31] sometimes we bring him to church with us
[1:28:34] we sit him beside us
[1:28:37] but i tell you he wants to tell you this
[1:28:38] morning be telling you that you're not
[1:28:40] saved say get behind me satan
[1:28:42] say i'm a child of god
[1:28:44] he wants to lie to you he wants to put
[1:28:46] you in a dark room by yourself somewhere
[1:28:48] in your storm where people think they
[1:28:50] don't care anymore the pastor of this
[1:28:52] don't care but i tell you they do care
[1:28:55] there's people in this church this
[1:28:56] morning that do care for your soul
[1:28:59] you think about brother brandon if he
[1:29:00] didn't kill the brother brandon with his
[1:29:02] little daughter in the bed she's passing
[1:29:04] away and she started to pass away and
[1:29:06] the devil started to get in his ear got
[1:29:07] on his shoulder and said look hey won't
[1:29:09] you give up why don't you do this why
[1:29:11] don't you do that think about it
[1:29:13] he's telling the prophet he said your
[1:29:15] daughter can't save her he said look at
[1:29:17] her
[1:29:18] he said blessed be the lord that giveth
[1:29:20] and take it take it give it away take it
[1:29:22] away
[1:29:24] i'll tell you i think about that this
[1:29:25] morning lord let me be in that presence
[1:29:30] but you know what really matters in
[1:29:31] these storms i was reading all three of
[1:29:32] these throughout different the way they
[1:29:34] brought it forth
[1:29:36] you know what really matters he says
[1:29:37] what we rely on on the storms
[1:29:40] amen amen amen
[1:29:42] what are you relying on this morning
[1:29:45] what are you relying on this morning are
[1:29:47] you relying they didn't rely on jesus
[1:29:49] christ jesus christ was in the boat but
[1:29:51] they didn't rely on them
[1:29:54] you think about it he rebuked them but
[1:29:56] they weren't relying on them
[1:29:59] matthew wasn't fearful
[1:30:01] think about it
[1:30:03] think about it
[1:30:05] each disciple
[1:30:07] they said they have faith
[1:30:10] think about it when the boat fills up
[1:30:12] you know you could just you could have
[1:30:14] the worst storms i tell you it's in the
[1:30:15] greatest storms that you still give to
[1:30:17] god you still give to the house of god
[1:30:19] you give the missions you still pray no
[1:30:21] matter what storm you go through you
[1:30:23] give to jesus christ i don't care it's
[1:30:25] not his prayer i tell you he said he's
[1:30:26] shaping us his formula are you i've read
[1:30:29] the quotes to you he said he's he's got
[1:30:31] confidence in you this morning so when
[1:30:33] you're going through a trial it ain't
[1:30:34] jesus's fault i tell you jesus is
[1:30:37] tempted just showing us he loves us
[1:30:41] he's showing us he loves us
[1:30:46] but i thought throughout this i wrote
[1:30:47] some things down last night about it all
[1:30:49] we can rest
[1:30:51] turn to luke 8
[1:30:52] back to luke kate real quick
[1:30:55] i love what he said luke 8 22
[1:30:59] we can rest in his commands
[1:31:03] we could rest his commands because look
[1:31:05] in that verse 22 right there in the red
[1:31:08] now it came to pass on a certain day
[1:31:10] within the ship and his disciple he said
[1:31:11] to him let us go over into the other
[1:31:14] side of the lake
[1:31:15] he commanded them let us go over
[1:31:19] amen
[1:31:20] so he's commanded even in revelations
[1:31:21] i'll read the revelation back there
[1:31:23] earlier right you don't have to turn to
[1:31:24] it but revelation 17
[1:31:26] or
[1:31:27] 19.
[1:31:29] it says
[1:31:30] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:31:32] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:31:34] lamb has come and the wife had made
[1:31:35] herself ready and what you're doing this
[1:31:37] morning is making yourself ready
[1:31:40] and we came to rest on his commands
[1:31:44] we're resting on his commands mark 4
[1:31:46] turn to mark
[1:31:52] it says math mark 4 35
[1:31:55] it said here here's another command he
[1:31:57] said say to them even if it was come he
[1:31:59] said to them let us pass over unto the
[1:32:02] other side
[1:32:04] he's given you a command this morning he
[1:32:06] said look you put my faith in me and you
[1:32:08] let rest in me and let me take care of
[1:32:11] your storm
[1:32:14] hebrews 13 5 let your conversation be
[1:32:16] without covetousness and be he said be
[1:32:19] content with such things he says as ye
[1:32:22] have for he has said i will never leave
[1:32:25] thee nor forsake me
[1:32:27] hebrews 13 6 i read on last night so
[1:32:29] that we may boldly say the lord is my
[1:32:32] helper and i will not fear what man
[1:32:34] shall do to me
[1:32:36] amen i tell you just call me crazy or
[1:32:38] fanatic this morning but i believe every
[1:32:40] word of this this morning i tell you
[1:32:42] wherever i go wherever i live i tell you
[1:32:44] what i believe the word of god
[1:32:47] we gotta take what he says this morning
[1:32:49] don't take what the social media says
[1:32:52] this morning don't take what facebook
[1:32:54] says this morning because i tell you
[1:32:56] most of facebook is fake anyway i need
[1:32:58] to be fake book because usually it's
[1:33:00] pictures from 19 it's back from high
[1:33:02] school pictures and then when you see
[1:33:03] them they don't even look that same way
[1:33:07] it's like gosh they're living in a real
[1:33:08] view mirror their whole life brethren
[1:33:10] said yeah you will crash when you live
[1:33:12] through a rearview mirror but you know
[1:33:14] how big a windshield is this morning
[1:33:16] when you look to a windshield this
[1:33:17] morning god wants to give you that view
[1:33:19] this morning
[1:33:20] god's gave you a view he's gave you
[1:33:22] manna from above he's gave you plenty of
[1:33:25] messages he's gave you a minister that
[1:33:27] loves the lord he's going to be a church
[1:33:29] to trust the lord in and when these
[1:33:31] doors are open come and worship lord
[1:33:38] i tell you we get in our own stores
[1:33:39] because we're starting to create them
[1:33:43] i create them
[1:33:45] i create them
[1:33:47] i get all upset about some things that i
[1:33:49] shouldn't even get upset about sometimes
[1:33:51] the lord's like why calm down you're
[1:33:53] creating your own storm
[1:33:55] i'm going to send you some storms you
[1:33:56] don't need to create them
[1:33:59] that's what he told me last night
[1:34:01] she was in the bed
[1:34:03] the way he told me he said chris you
[1:34:04] need to quit creating them i'm talking
[1:34:05] was preaching to me this morning too

[1:34:12] and we know that all things work
[1:34:14] together for good that love that to them
[1:34:16] that love god
[1:34:18] and he says and then they were called
[1:34:20] according to his purpose
[1:34:22] you were called for his purpose
[1:34:24] you were if you wouldn't you'd be in the
[1:34:26] baptist church or you'd have your
[1:34:28] pajamas on this morning sitting there
[1:34:30] drinking a thing of coffee while you're
[1:34:31] watching church but i'm telling you they

[1:35:19] just tell you
[1:35:20] the devil devils use this every bit of
[1:35:22] this as an excuse
[1:35:24] for us saints to not come together
[1:35:26] because he said when two or three are
[1:35:27] gathered he's in the midst
[1:35:29] i tell you that's when cancer starts to
[1:35:31] drop that's when depression starts to

[1:35:35] to heal that's when kids life start to
[1:35:37] change i tell you why i want to keep my
[1:35:39] kids always in the presence of god
[1:35:43] the resurrection of jerius 1954 he said
[1:35:46] that's the way he does just about the
[1:35:48] time he gets to the very darkest of
[1:35:49] hours then jesus comes along we fret and
[1:35:52] worry we we christians and the babies

[1:36:00] just go so nervous and upset
[1:36:04] we should just sit quiet

[1:36:10] commanded it
[1:36:12] oh lord help me
[1:36:14] just to sit quiet in his presence
[1:36:17] he said we're living under his
[1:36:18] desperation living under his grace just

[1:36:26] he said just be still and he'll come

[1:39:09] his life
[1:39:10] he said be in the royal seat of abraham
[1:39:13] he said with the same spirit of god
[1:39:16] i'm going to skip through this for time
[1:39:20] i want to read this john 14 27 he said
[1:39:22] peace i leave you with leave with you
[1:39:25] my peace i give unto you not as the
[1:39:28] world giveth listen
[1:39:30] i give i he's a give eye unto you let
[1:39:33] not your heart be troubled neither let
[1:39:36] it be afraid
[1:39:39] i said lord you're dealing with me so
[1:39:41] much
[1:39:42] lord let me not be troubled
[1:39:44] let me have all my rest and every storm
[1:39:47] and every situation be in you
[1:39:53] to whom should we go he said if we ever
[1:39:54] ever got a real peace you've got jesus
[1:39:58] brother bram said to whom shall we go
[1:40:00] 1960s if you ever got real peace
[1:40:03] you've got jesus
[1:40:06] i said lord that's what i want
[1:40:09] i want to walk through this life like my
[1:40:11] brother here i saw him at brother brad
[1:40:12] burgess's and he got out of the car i
[1:40:15] helped him out of the car and i said god
[1:40:16] bless this brother brother johnson i
[1:40:18] said you know how many years probably on
[1:40:20] the battlefield just keep pressing on i
[1:40:22] said if he can come to church we all
[1:40:24] have no excuses
[1:40:26] we have no excuses
[1:40:29] i said lord if i get that old lord i
[1:40:31] want to come to the house of god because
[1:40:33] i bet you if you ask brother johnson
[1:40:35] today he said i know where my peace
[1:40:37] comes from i know where my breath comes
[1:40:39] from i know where my healings come from
[1:40:41] i know where my paychecks come from and
[1:40:43] when you realize all your storms are
[1:40:45] covered by jesus christ you'll show up
[1:40:48] no matter what age you are no matter how
[1:40:50] old you are no matter what situation you
[1:40:52] got this morning you'll come expecting
[1:40:54] great things
[1:40:57] amen i said god bless them
[1:41:00] pick it calm we have no excuses
[1:41:07] sorry brother that was free
[1:41:10] i don't know they went in my notes but
[1:41:12] i just thought about the brother i said
[1:41:14] man lord give me more of a heart
[1:41:18] give me that heart when i'm that age
[1:41:20] to always no matter what it takes if
[1:41:22] someone has to drive me to church if i
[1:41:24] have to pay uber or whatever car service
[1:41:26] they got i'll let me get there
[1:41:31] probably i'm saying the key to the door
[1:41:33] there's only one door to healing and
[1:41:34] jesus is that door
[1:41:36] there's only one door to peace in my
[1:41:38] peace i give it to you
[1:41:40] he's only one door to genuine peace you
[1:41:42] might think you got peace you might
[1:41:44] accumulate enough money to buy your home
[1:41:46] you might accumulate enough money to get
[1:41:48] your children closed have food to eat
[1:41:50] you might have accumulated enough
[1:41:51] popularity to be popular amongst people
[1:41:54] but when you slip off your shoes at
[1:41:56] night you and get ready to lay down
[1:41:58] there's only one thing can give you
[1:42:01] peace
[1:42:02] he said that is if you know that you're
[1:42:04] dying that night that's only one piece
[1:42:07] that's jesus is the peace
[1:42:10] he is our peace brother branham's sin he
[1:42:13] said he's our healing i'm the lord that
[1:42:15] god it heals all that he's he's at the
[1:42:17] door to heaven and there's no other door
[1:42:19] or no other way through jesus jesus
[1:42:22] christ he is that door to heaven
[1:42:24] and now jesus is the door to all these
[1:42:27] things and faith unlocks the door
[1:42:30] that's what they had they had problems
[1:42:31] with their faith they saw all these
[1:42:33] miracles even in brother brown's
[1:42:35] meetings you asked all these old-timers
[1:42:37] you ask them this and ask them that and
[1:42:38] they didn't see this they didn't realize
[1:42:40] that until he's off the scene they
[1:42:41] didn't realize this because they saw all
[1:42:43] the wonders and the miracles
[1:42:45] they realized that jesus was working
[1:42:47] through this man
[1:42:49] rachel's grandmother rachel's
[1:42:51] grandmother was taken off a clot not in
[1:42:52] columbia south carolina where we're
[1:42:54] originally from before we moved eight
[1:42:55] years ago
[1:42:56] she got taken off a she was in the
[1:42:58] pentecostal church bro brown called her
[1:42:59] off a cot you can hear it on the tape
[1:43:02] he called and rachel my wife's
[1:43:03] grandmother alpha cot and she still
[1:43:05] didn't believe it she said he was a good
[1:43:06] man but i don't i don't i that's all i
[1:43:08] see
[1:43:09] but her mom and dad and all them came
[1:43:11] out of it and believed it with all their
[1:43:12] heart and her dad's 75 years old in a
[1:43:15] retirement home now
[1:43:17] preached the message all around the
[1:43:19] world
[1:43:21] but had a mom that got saw that because
[1:43:23] you just saw a little bit of wonders but
[1:43:25] i tell you when you see jesus christ and
[1:43:27] when this becomes a love letter and then
[1:43:29] messages become real to you and this
[1:43:31] becomes your heart and every everything
[1:43:33] you read in between the lines you see
[1:43:35] jesus christ he said if you don't see
[1:43:37] jesus christ he said read it again amen
[1:43:41] number two musicians can come
[1:43:44] number two you write this down we can
[1:43:46] rest in the crowd
[1:43:48] we can rest in the crowd and you might
[1:43:49] think it's crazy i say that this morning
[1:43:51] but look at number four look at uh verse
[1:43:54] mark 4 36 listen to this this is great
[1:43:58] he said when they had sent away the
[1:43:59] multitude they took him and even as he
[1:44:01] was in the ship and there were also with
[1:44:04] him other little ships
[1:44:07] there was little ships
[1:44:11] i'm referring to you this morning
[1:44:14] that i you need me and i need you
[1:44:18] we can rest one another when we go
[1:44:20] through trials and we go through storms
[1:44:22] we have one another to rest on
[1:44:25] now we can look at my brother back here
[1:44:26] and say how did you make it when you
[1:44:28] when they said you had this how did you
[1:44:30] make it when you had this how did your
[1:44:32] kids get saved when you hired this and
[1:44:34] they tell you they started to tell you
[1:44:36] because there was little ships at bay
[1:44:38] there was little people like me and you
[1:44:40] and there's other little ships at bay
[1:44:42] this morning that's going through trials
[1:44:44] going through storms this morning that
[1:44:46] we can rest in this morning
[1:44:49] so we can rest with within the bride
[1:44:52] that little song that says rest little
[1:44:54] bride rest for all as well
[1:44:58] we can come together in our storms
[1:45:01] lastly i want to leave we can rest in
[1:45:03] his companionship
[1:45:06] we can rest in jesus companionship
[1:45:10] and all three stories jesus was in the
[1:45:12] boat
[1:45:13] think about it this morning
[1:45:14] just for a minute i know we're probably
[1:45:16] getting starving we're getting getting
[1:45:17] hungry but i tell you what
[1:45:20] i tell you what but we can rest in this
[1:45:22] boat jesus was
[1:45:23] every story jesus was in the boat
[1:45:28] jesus says are you in the boat and what
[1:45:29] i love about it was jesus didn't show up
[1:45:32] in the boat he was already in the boat
[1:45:35] and every story jesus was already in the
[1:45:38] boat and he's in your boat this morning
[1:45:40] you just need to wake him up
[1:45:43] amen
[1:45:45] we just need to wake him up
[1:45:48] think about genesis 7 real quick does it
[1:45:50] play something softly i love this
[1:45:53] genesis 7 you know what was built in the
[1:45:55] ark and he said the lord said unto noah
[1:45:58] listen
[1:46:00] come
[1:46:02] did you know that jesus was already in
[1:46:04] his boat yes
[1:46:08] oh i was having a time last night rachel
[1:46:11] said you never come to bed i couldn't
[1:46:13] handle i couldn't stand i've read a book
[1:46:15] and i kept reading this i read this word
[1:46:16] and i read this book i couldn't stay up
[1:46:18] all night i said boy i tell you what
[1:46:20] we're having a good time over here
[1:46:22] i said cause i thought about art i saw
[1:46:24] about noah he said come
[1:46:27] that means he was already there
[1:46:29] so whatever situation you brought in
[1:46:31] this church i'll tell you what you can
[1:46:33] leave without it
[1:46:35] he said come because when he started
[1:46:37] building the note no one started
[1:46:38] building 120 years he kept not you don't
[1:46:41] think he had a storm or a trial you
[1:46:43] don't think they told him you crazy you
[1:46:45] lost your mind you believe a message you
[1:46:47] believe malachi 4 and then all of a
[1:46:49] sudden he kept building anyway he can't
[1:46:52] build it and he said come and he kept
[1:46:54] coming and then when he got in the boat
[1:46:56] and the star coming then fanatics didn't
[1:46:58] look at him any crazy anymore they said
[1:47:00] that fanatic was right they're
[1:47:02] fanatically right i believe jesus christ
[1:47:05] is close
[1:47:06] i believe he's closing the ark this
[1:47:07] morning
[1:47:09] that was 20 we were in seattle at
[1:47:11] brother john andy's about three weeks
[1:47:13] two weeks ago
[1:47:15] he started a little work there brother
[1:47:16] john andy's and i'm not bragging i'm
[1:47:18] giving it to god this morning over 24
[1:47:20] people gave their heart to jesus christ
[1:47:24] i said god i believe you're calling
[1:47:27] i said i believe your election is so
[1:47:29] close
[1:47:30] i believe we're so close and i don't
[1:47:33] just to scare you this morning i believe
[1:47:35] we are going through storms and trials
[1:47:37] to get the bride of christ to get every
[1:47:39] kid in to get every family member in to
[1:47:41] get every believer in that's in the boat
[1:47:44] that's predestinated to be in that boat
[1:47:46] but i want to tell you just like jesus
[1:47:48] said you come this morning amen right
[1:47:50] now if you haven't been baptized i
[1:47:52] provoke you to be baptized this morning
[1:47:55] i'll tell you brother john i know he'll
[1:47:56] turn the water on and we'll baptize you
[1:47:58] in jesus name i'll tell you what i'll
[1:48:00] tell you get in the boat just get in the
[1:48:02] boat jesus says are you in the boat i
[1:48:05] tell you to step in this morning
[1:48:07] amen
[1:48:11] god didn't say go get in the boat he
[1:48:13] said come on
[1:48:16] jesus was already waiting for him i love
[1:48:18] what psalms 37 said
[1:48:21] david said i've i've been young i've
[1:48:23] been old
[1:48:24] he said yet i've not seen the righteous
[1:48:26] forsaken.
[1:48:28] amen oh i know i didn't see this seed
[1:48:30] begging for bread
[1:48:34] i'm so thankful
[1:48:36] in closing i'll read this second
[1:48:38] corinthians 12 9
[1:48:39] and he said it to me my grace is
[1:48:41] sufficient for thee
[1:48:43] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:48:45] weakness
[1:48:47] church we don't have no strength it's
[1:48:49] all in jesus strength it ain't what i
[1:48:52] could say it ain't what i can do it's
[1:48:54] all in jesus christ
[1:48:57] most gladly therefore i will rather
[1:48:59] glory in my infirmities
[1:49:01] that the power of christ must rest upon
[1:49:04] us
[1:49:05] so i tell you out all these scriptures i
[1:49:07] read he was rested jesus christ was
[1:49:09] rested
[1:49:10] because he knew his peace
[1:49:13] do you know who your peace is in
[1:49:16] i'm not just saying just because you
[1:49:17] know all the quotes or you say i've been
[1:49:18] in the message for 40 years
[1:49:20] it's more than just saying that
[1:49:23] do you really have a true peace
[1:49:26] you have so much of peace that whatever
[1:49:29] storm you go through every trial every
[1:49:32] battle you go through you can take every
[1:49:34] scripture that i read this morning and
[1:49:35] say lord thank you lord
[1:49:38] thank you for what i've been through
[1:49:40] thank you for trying me thank you for
[1:49:42] bringing me through every fire you know
[1:49:44] what you didn't say i would go through
[1:49:46] the fire but you were already in the
[1:49:48] fire when i went through it
[1:49:52] so i'm here to tell you he's a calm for
[1:49:54] your storm this morning but you know
[1:49:56] what i thought when he said he was at
[1:49:58] the hinder part of the ship
[1:50:01] and closing this i just thought about

[1:50:04] ship he said jesus was in the hunger
[1:50:07] park you know what's in behind hinder
[1:50:09] part the controls

[1:50:30] morning
