[16:40] to see the saints of God raptured.
[16:45] Amen. What a blessed. We are blessed
[16:48] people.
[16:51] Amen. Well, there's a few requests I'd
[16:55] like to bring to the Well, first of all,
[16:58] I'd like to give an apology for not
[17:00] reading these last uh Sunday. this past
[17:03] Sunday. It's uh one of them is uh please
[17:06] remember brother Jonathan this morning
[17:08] and is has tremendous pain and has been
[17:11] fighting an ear infection. Uh so for
[17:15] over a month. So
[17:17] as we read it here he is. So we're just
[17:21] thankful that he was able to make it
[17:24] this this afternoon. Amen.
[17:28] So and it's good to see our sister Linda
[17:30] too. So um and our brother Ben. You
[17:34] know, when when
[17:38] a member of the body is sick, we're all
[17:40] sick.
[17:42] And and you know, I I I was just
[17:45] thinking uh earlier this morning, I say,
[17:48] you know, um when you don't see somebody
[17:52] at church, that should be a burden on
[17:54] your heart to pray for them because we
[17:57] don't know what's going on, whether it's
[17:58] sickness or maybe they're down in the
[18:01] spirit, whatever it is. You know,
[18:04] there's many people that should be here
[18:06] that aren't here. And sometimes I
[18:08] believe the reason they're not here is
[18:10] because we don't pray for them.
[18:12] I know I'm guilty. So, let us all pray
[18:16] one for another.
[18:18] Amen.
[18:20] So, let's just remember uh all the
[18:23] Christians in Iran. Amen. For God's
[18:26] protection for them as there's an
[18:28] uprising. Um God's on the move.
[18:33] You know, he has to give everybody an
[18:35] opportunity
[18:37] and the more people that get the
[18:39] opportunity to receive Christ, the
[18:41] closer we are to the rapture.
[18:44] So pray that is the word can go out
[18:48] throughout the world. Amen.
[18:50] Many p uh many pastors have been in
[18:54] prison Venezuela. Amen. Pray for their
[18:57] release. And same thing in Iran. Amen.
[19:01] And I believe our Jonathan mentioned in
[19:03] the uh men's meeting that there's a
[19:06] mighty move of uh God in China too. Um
[19:12] you know if you're if you're chosen from
[19:14] God,
[19:16] he'll call you out
[19:19] and
[19:22] he'll call you into the truth.
[19:25] So we remember us. We've been called
[19:27] into the truth. But there's many out
[19:30] there that haven't been called into the
[19:32] truth. So, let's just continue to pray
[19:34] for them. Not only, you know, the Iran,
[19:38] but there's a there's a battlefield
[19:40] right outside these doors.
[19:42] So, let's just pray one for another for
[19:45] all of them. Amen. If we could also
[19:48] remember um a gentleman named uh uh Sean
[19:54] Swain. We prayed him for him before.
[19:57] He's had cancer.
[19:59] How many years ago? 20 years ago or
[20:01] something like that? Well, 10 years ago
[20:04] anyway. And uh he it's returned back
[20:08] with vengeance on him. And uh it's taken
[20:12] its toll on his body. He needs a
[20:15] miracle.
[20:16] Also, uh let's remember brother
[20:19] Orlando's eyes. He needs a touch from
[20:21] the Lord for cataracts. I think he has
[20:24] he scheduled to get cataract surgery if
[20:26] God don't move on his behalf. I but he's
[20:30] just believing.
[20:32] Amen.
[20:34] Also for uh
[20:36] uh my sister-in-law Linda's uh uh sister
[20:42] Diana uh she come down with lethoma
[20:47] and she's uh we're currently getting a
[20:50] port put in so they can give her
[20:52] treatment.
[20:53] So,
[20:56] I mean, sometimes a month goes by,
[20:59] sometimes a week goes by. We don't we
[21:01] don't we don't know. Things can change
[21:04] just like that. And I believe sometimes
[21:07] we think that,
[21:09] you know,
[21:11] God forbid that we think that God
[21:13] delayeth his coming, but you know, day
[21:16] every day we take things for granted,
[21:18] but we should never take Christ for
[21:20] granted.
[21:24] He gave us another day.
[21:27] So let's be thankful that he did give us
[21:32] another day.
[21:34] So let's just stand.
[21:37] Amen. If there's somebody on your heart,
[21:38] just lift it up to the Lord. Let's
[21:41] remember our pastor John in prayer uh
[21:44] that uh as we start the new year that um
[21:48] God would just uh
[21:50] inspire him to take us higher
[21:53] or we can never go uh any higher than he
[21:56] goes. So we just pray that God would
[21:59] just uh speak to him. Amen. and that all
[22:03] of us would just uh hear to the word of
[22:07] God and just believe and see where God
[22:11] will take us because I believe he wants
[22:13] to take us to places we've never been.
[22:17] So let's just pray on in the unity
[22:20] tonight. Dear heavenly father, Lord, as
[22:22] we come before you tonight, Lord God, we
[22:26] know, Lord, that you're more than
[22:27] capable, Lord, more than capable of
[22:29] meeting every need that we would have,
[22:31] Lord Jesus. We see your work around the
[22:34] world, Lord. We see that time is short,
[22:36] Lord. And that you're calling yours
[22:39] people out of the out of each every
[22:42] group, Lord. A little here, a little
[22:43] there, Lord God. But Lord, we know that
[22:47] Lord all that comes to you will all that
[22:50] the Father comes Lord will come Lord
[22:52] God. So Lord as we stand before you
[22:55] tonight Lord Lord with many needs upon
[22:58] our hearts
[23:01] Lord we know that we've come to the
[23:03] author and finisher of our faith Lord
[23:05] the Omega Lord. Oh Lord Jesus, Lord, as
[23:09] we come before you tonight, Lord God, we
[23:11] pray, Lord, in the depths of our hearts
[23:14] and our souls, Lord, that you would,
[23:16] Lord, just help us, Lord. Give us
[23:19] strength in this hour, Lord. Give us
[23:21] more faith than we've ever had before,
[23:23] Lord, to believe on the unseen things,
[23:26] Lord. To believe on the things, Lord
[23:28] God, that we have only hoped for, Lord.
[23:31] to push that hope aside and believe by
[23:33] faith, Lord, and know that they're going
[23:36] to happen, Lord. Not to speak, Lord, bad
[23:39] things, Lord, or things of ill, Lord,
[23:41] but to believe on eternal things, Lord
[23:44] God. That this church would have a per
[23:47] uh confession of profession, Lord, that
[23:49] it would just utter the things of God
[23:51] and nothing more, Lord God. For you are
[23:54] the Lord and the Savior of all humanity,
[23:57] Lord Jesus. And we just pray in in one
[24:00] name, Lord Jesus, that you would just
[24:02] come and just be in our midst, Lord. Be
[24:05] our guest tonight, Lord. We invite you
[24:07] and not only into this church, but into
[24:09] our hearts, Lord God, that we might
[24:11] receive from you. Lord, we pray that you
[24:14] just bless all the ministers around the
[24:16] world, Lord. All the missionaries, Lord.
[24:19] Bless all those that are live streaming
[24:21] tonight, Lord. May they receive what
[24:23] they have need of also, Lord God. For
[24:26] your mar arm is mighty and it is long,
[24:28] Lord. There's no place that it can't
[24:30] reach, Lord God. And we pray, Lord
[24:33] Jesus, that you fulfill the needs that
[24:35] we would have tonight. And that we ask
[24:38] it all in the precious name of our Lord
[24:39] and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[24:43] Hallelujah.

[30:58] Hallelujah.
[30:59] Amen. Let's go deeper tonight in his
[31:01] word. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's just
[31:04] stand. Amen.
[31:06] Amen. Let's just uh sing um
[31:10] only believe as our brother comes. Amen.
[31:14] Oh, you got to you just got to believe
[31:16] what what we sang about what the word
[31:19] that's going to come forth and may it
[31:21] manifest in our lives. Amen.
[31:24] Only
[31:26] believe.
[31:30] Only
[31:32] believe.
[31:35] All things are possible.
[31:39] Only
[31:41] believe.
[31:44] Only
[31:45] believe.
[31:48] Only
[31:50] believe.
[31:53] All things are possible.
[31:57] Only
[31:59] believe.
[32:01] Lord,
[32:03] I believe.
[32:06] Lord, I believe.
[32:11] All things are possible.
[32:15] Lord, I believe.
[32:19] Lord, I believe.
[32:23] Lord, I believe.
[32:28] All things are possible.
[32:32] I believe.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:39] With God, all things are possible.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of the Lord
[32:45] today. It's good to see everyone today.
[32:48] Amen. It seems like it's a little bright
[32:50] up here and a little dark back there.
[32:55] But how does it seem to you? You got
[32:57] light enough back there?
[32:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:00] Huh? Too bright up here. It seems just a
[33:03] little bit, but uh the word of the Lord
[33:07] is our light. Amen.
[33:09] Well, um
[33:14] we really appreciate Brother Ron and
[33:16] leading us in worship and praise and uh
[33:20] preparing us for the word.
[33:23] Um, and let's just look to the Lord in a
[33:27] word of prayer before we open his word
[33:30] and begin to read it. A dear Father,
[33:34] thank you.
[33:35] Thank you, Lord, that you've made a way
[33:38] for us to gather together with brothers
[33:41] and sisters of like precious faith.
[33:45] and thank you that you've promised that
[33:48] where two or three would be gathered,
[33:50] you would be right there in the midst.
[33:54] Now, Lord, we're asking that you'd give
[33:56] us eyes to see,
[33:58] see you here in the unveiling of your
[34:01] word. Help us to recognize you in a
[34:06] personal way. And Lord, from the
[34:08] youngest to the oldest, I pray that we
[34:12] would all have that expectation
[34:15] of hearing your voice and seeing uh the
[34:21] unseen God speak to us today. Lord, let
[34:25] us leave here with a portion of you that
[34:27] we didn't have when we came. Lord, it
[34:31] would only just take one word. So many
[34:33] words would be spoken today, not perhaps
[34:35] for uh us directly, but for somebody
[34:38] else. Lord, we ask that every one of us
[34:41] would be able to walk away with one word
[34:44] from you. Lord, that word could change
[34:47] our life forever. Lord, we commit the
[34:50] service to you. We just pray your
[34:52] blessings now and your anointing on your
[34:55] word as we receive it today in Jesus
[34:58] Christ's precious name. Amen. Amen.
[35:01] Lord, we give you the glory. Turn with
[35:03] me, if you would, to 1 Corinthians
[35:06] chapter 10 for our opening scripture. We
[35:09] want to entitle this message, trusting
[35:11] God will make a way in our trial.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Trusting God will make a way in our
[35:18] trials. And um for our subject, we want
[35:22] to talk about growing in our trials.
[35:26] Not all people grow through trials.
[35:29] U brother Brandon makes a statement that
[35:32] um God put some people in the church
[35:35] just for your perfecting
[35:39] and showing us that not everybody is
[35:43] going to grow through a trial
[35:46] and that God puts adversity in the
[35:49] church just for your perfection.
[35:52] not to be your best friend, not so you
[35:55] could um make a rapture together, but
[35:58] that God uses the enemy as it were or
[36:02] the carnal believer to bring spiritual
[36:06] perfection to you.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. First Corinthians chapter 10,
[36:11] we're going to read one verse, verse
[36:12] number 13.
[36:15] There have no temptation taken you, but
[36:18] such as common to man. But God is
[36:22] faithful, who will not suffer you to be
[36:25] tempted above that you are able, but
[36:29] will with the temptation also make a way
[36:34] of escape that you may be able to bear
[36:37] it.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. May be seated. If I
[36:41] could just slip this in there real
[36:43] quick. That way of escape is inside of
[36:46] you.
[36:48] The way of escape for this trial that
[36:51] you're going through out here that's
[36:55] mega problem. The the way of escape is
[36:58] inside of you because God speaks to the
[37:01] inside of you.
[37:04] Now everyone at this time of the year is
[37:06] trying to make changes in their lives.
[37:10] Uh
[37:12] how many people go on a diet at this
[37:14] time of year? A quite a few people. How
[37:18] many people in our church are uh
[37:20] starting a diet at this time? No. Uh
[37:22] finances. This is just a time that
[37:25] people look at change, make New Year's
[37:27] resolutions. We've talked about this
[37:29] before.
[37:31] And every change that takes place
[37:33] requires growth
[37:35] from what they're currently doing.
[37:39] In other words, you have to do something
[37:41] different because if you always done
[37:44] what you always if you always do what
[37:46] you always done, you're always going to
[37:47] get what you always got. And there's
[37:49] never going to be anything different.
[37:51] Like if I'm going to go uh and get
[37:54] healthier
[37:56] uh by my diet, I I need I can't keep
[38:00] eating Oreos and candy and cake and
[38:04] cookies and ice cream
[38:07] because I'm always going to get the same
[38:08] result.
[38:11] So
[38:13] those of you that are on a diet, if I
[38:15] could say it like this,
[38:18] you have had to suffer to do the diet.
[38:24] And and says to me, why did you buy
[38:27] those donuts?
[38:29] I mean,
[38:32] so you have to actually resist certain
[38:35] things to bring about a better thing in
[38:37] your life,
[38:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[38:39] And trials
[38:42] are there
[38:44] to bring about a better thing in your
[38:46] life.
[38:48] But we don't view it like that. We're
[38:51] just this trial is why is this thing
[38:53] here? This shouldn't be happening. But
[38:55] it's the trial that God brings
[38:59] that opens the door of opportunity
[39:03] uh for growth to happen in our life. And
[39:08] it it's it's learning to see God in the
[39:11] trial.
[39:13] So change is very important. Without
[39:15] change, there can be no growth. There
[39:18] must be a change in order for growth to
[39:21] transpire.
[39:22] Uh take a look at a baby. We would all
[39:25] be in diapers today if uh there wasn't
[39:29] changes in our life. We were all in
[39:32] diapers at one time and we had to make a
[39:35] change. And I'm sure every one of us
[39:37] when we were uh told uh to to go on the
[39:42] big potty uh we were not really wanting
[39:46] to do that because we just spent the
[39:49] last what years, six months or two
[39:51] years, whatever it was, not having to
[39:54] worry about it,
[39:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[39:56] &gt;&gt; And our mom and dad says, you know, we
[39:59] don't want to keep doing this. You need
[40:01] to start thinking about change. It was
[40:02] like uncomfortable feeling. don't want
[40:05] to do this. So, even from a young child
[40:09] all the way, it it doesn't stop how how
[40:12] old you get. If you're if there's going
[40:14] to be growth, there's going to be a
[40:16] change. And the change is going to be
[40:18] hard. It's going to seem like a trial to
[40:20] that child.
[40:22] Um, and it's to us it's like it's no
[40:26] trial. Just learn to sit on the big
[40:28] potty and go. And it's with anything. is
[40:32] is is feeding. You know, before you we
[40:35] were either breastfed or a bottle and
[40:37] after that, you know, you got to learn
[40:39] to drink out a sippy cup and it's uh no
[40:42] longer jars. You're going to be eating
[40:44] uh regular meats and all this was was
[40:47] different. And it was it was harder and
[40:50] um it it it became a trial to take a a
[40:55] teenager who who he was just his his
[40:58] whole mindset is I can't wait till I
[41:01] drive. Where's where's uh JJ? I can't
[41:05] wait till I drive because when I drive
[41:07] it's freedom, right? It's freedom. But
[41:11] you got to go through the trial of of of
[41:13] of driver's ed and you got to study
[41:15] things and learn things. the law that
[41:17] you don't really want to. So, so a a
[41:21] trial is part of learning
[41:24] and that learning creates a change and
[41:27] then you you you you grow because of it.
[41:30] Are you with me so far?
[41:36] &gt;&gt; We had to change the way that we wanted
[41:39] to do things to be more mature.
[41:46] Bible says in 1 Corinthians 13:11, "When
[41:49] I was a child, I spake as a child. I
[41:51] understood as a child, I thought as a
[41:53] child, but when I became a man, I put
[41:56] away childish things."
[41:59] So
[42:01] I don't care if I want to look at this
[42:02] emotionally, spiritually, naturally, you
[42:06] have to put away things that you once
[42:09] did in order to grow.
[42:12] Because if you always did what you
[42:13] always have done, there's never going to
[42:16] be a growth.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; So if we want to grow, we have to make a
[42:21] change. This is really important because
[42:25] in our trials, the only thing we're
[42:27] thinking about in our trials is just to
[42:29] get out of the trial. And we're not
[42:32] thinking about growth. We're not
[42:33] thinking about change. We just want the
[42:35] trial to stop.
[42:37] But if we really want to change, we have
[42:39] to accept that it's going to feel like a
[42:41] trial to the smallest degree. But God is
[42:45] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[42:47] tempted above that you're able, but will
[42:50] with the temptation, he will make a way
[42:53] of escape that you can bear it. How many
[42:56] times have you been in a trial and said,
[42:58] "I hate this thing. I wish it wouldn't
[43:00] be here."
[43:04] But the Bible is telling us that God
[43:06] will make a way of escape. Thinking
[43:08] about the Christians that gave their
[43:09] life on a a cross, they were burnt to
[43:13] death.
[43:15] God made a way of escape. Look at
[43:17] Stephen when he was being stoned. He
[43:20] didn't even feel the pain
[43:22] because of the presence of the Lord was
[43:24] so strong.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; He had so much love. Father, forgive
[43:29] them. They don't know what they're
[43:30] doing.
[43:32] And so if we can believe no matter how
[43:34] hard a trial is that God is really truly
[43:37] there if you're looking for him to be
[43:41] there if you believe that he'll be there
[43:44] he is there
[43:45] &gt;&gt; because he said I'll never leave you
[43:47] I'll never forsake you.
[43:49] Now almost all the changes that occur in
[43:53] our lives went through some sort of
[43:55] suffering
[43:59] and um it it it it's I don't even when
[44:05] you get older and uh it it never stops.
[44:10] No matter how old you are, you it's
[44:13] going to require you to suffer in order
[44:16] to grow.
[44:19] But God will make a way for us. I
[44:23] believe that with all my heart. Now, not
[44:26] all change is good.
[44:29] Not all changes bring good growth. For
[44:32] instance, if a child doesn't get what it
[44:35] wants by just asking, can I have this?
[44:39] It doesn't get what it wants. It will
[44:42] learn to manipulate.
[44:46] it will find a way to get what it wants
[44:49] by manipulation
[44:53] because
[44:54] um
[44:56] it didn't get what it want by asking.
[44:58] So now I got to try something different
[45:00] and it changes its technique.
[45:04] Of course it doesn't stop with a child.
[45:06] Adults do it too.
[45:09] So they change. So not all change is
[45:12] good. Remember, brother Brandham said,
[45:16] um, power without character, in other
[45:19] words, power to get what you want
[45:22] without the right way
[45:26] is satanic.
[45:29] So now all change is good.
[45:33] Bible teaches us that children are
[45:35] shaped into iniquity.
[45:38] So just through the the mere fact of
[45:41] learning that that you don't have to do
[45:44] everything that you're supposed to do,
[45:46] you become someone who feeds off the
[45:49] tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[45:52] And uh
[45:54] and and we as adults, we have to learn
[45:58] to
[46:00] to put away those things. Amen.
[46:03] 1 Peter 4:1 says, "For as much then as
[46:07] Christ has suffered for us in the flesh,
[46:12] arm yourself likewise with the same
[46:14] mind. For he that have suffered in the
[46:17] flesh have ceased from sin, that you no
[46:20] longer should live the rest of his time
[46:22] in the flesh to the lust of men, but to
[46:25] the will of God." So here Peter is
[46:27] saying you need to have the mind of
[46:29] Christ
[46:31] that if you're going to grow in Christ
[46:34] that you need to arm yourself that it's
[46:37] going to be a suffering and brother Ron
[46:39] read a scripture in our men's meeting
[46:41] that the sufferings of the present time
[46:43] are not worthy to be compared with the
[46:45] glory that shall be revealed in us that
[46:48] if you if you realize if you want to
[46:50] grow a lot in life you got to be willing
[46:53] to suffer a lot. If a person is not
[46:55] willing to suffer, they're not going to
[46:57] grow.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Romans 12:1, I beseech you therefore,
[47:03] brethren, by the mercies of God, that
[47:05] you present your body a living
[47:08] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
[47:11] which is your reasonable service. So to
[47:14] present your body uh a living sacrifice
[47:18] is suffering constantly,
[47:21] right? It's not just a one. It's not
[47:23] like the Mayans who just sacrificed
[47:25] their body one time and they they were
[47:27] dead. But every day, right? You you you
[47:31] pick up your cross daily. I'm crucified
[47:34] with Christ.
[47:36] And be not conformed to this world,
[47:39] which is, you know, go after everything
[47:41] you want and just do do whatever you got
[47:43] to do to get it. Be not conformed to
[47:46] this world, but be ye transformed by the
[47:49] renewing of your mind, that you may
[47:51] prove what is the good and acceptable
[47:52] and perfect will of God. So, what we
[47:54] want to do is change the way we think in
[47:56] our trials.
[47:58] Change the way we think in our trials.
[48:02] What I found is that most people want
[48:06] change from their current situation
[48:08] without doing anything.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; It's almost like a wish list. They wish
[48:14] things would be better, but they're not
[48:17] willing to pay the necessary price to
[48:20] make them better. They want somebody
[48:22] else to fix their situation for them.
[48:24] We're going to dive into uh the children
[48:27] of Israel for a a little bit. If you
[48:29] want to turn to Exodus chapter 3, the
[48:32] children of Israel were in bondage
[48:36] um down in Egypt and Pharaoh the task
[48:40] masters uh afflicted them with uh
[48:44] burdens.
[48:46] And in Deuteronomy uh 26 verse 6 as you
[48:50] turn to Exodus chapter 3 it says the
[48:52] Egyptians evil uh intreated them and
[48:57] afflicted them and laid upon them hard
[49:00] bondage and the Lord in Exodus 3:7 the
[49:05] Lord said unto Moses I have surely seen
[49:07] the affliction of my people which are in
[49:09] Egypt and have heard their cry by the
[49:11] reason of their taskmasters for I know
[49:13] their sorrows and I have come down to
[49:15] deliver them out of the hand under the
[49:18] hand of the Egyptians. So here God is
[49:21] going to come down and he's going to
[49:24] deliver them out of their trial.
[49:27] But this is not all that he's going to
[49:30] do. He said, "And to bring them up out
[49:36] of uh out of that land onto a good land
[49:40] and a large onto a land flown with milk
[49:43] and honey." And you sang about it today.
[49:45] I am bound for the promised land.
[49:48] And so there were two things that God
[49:50] was going to do. He was going to deliver
[49:53] and he was going to place them into the
[49:55] promised land.
[49:57] So the children of Israel cried out for
[50:01] a change. They wanted these burdens
[50:04] often. They wanted the to be out of this
[50:06] trial. And God delivered them out of the
[50:09] oppression wherewith the Egyptians had
[50:11] oppressed them. And in Exodus 15 verse
[50:15] one, this is uh after they went through
[50:18] the the the miracle of the Red Sea, uh
[50:21] they were no longer being afflicted, but
[50:24] they were they were having a great time.
[50:27] In Exodus 15:1 says, "Then sang Moses
[50:31] and the children of Israel this song
[50:33] unto the Lord and spake, saying, I will
[50:36] sing unto the Lord, for he have
[50:38] triumphed gloriously. The horses and his
[50:42] rider uh have he thrown into the sea.
[50:45] The Lord is my strength and my song, and
[50:48] he has become my salvation. and he is my
[50:50] God and I will prepare him a habitation
[50:53] um my father's God and I will exalt him.
[50:57] So you could see they were no longer
[50:59] under affliction anymore but they were
[51:02] on the other side of uh the Red Sea and
[51:06] now they were rejoicing
[51:09] because God had delivered them.
[51:13] In verse 20, and Marion the prophetus,
[51:16] the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine
[51:18] in her hand, and all the women went out
[51:21] after her with the tambourines and with
[51:25] dances.
[51:27] Praise God, there's dances. And Marion
[51:30] answered them, "Sing ye to the Lord, for
[51:33] he have triumphed gloriously. The horse
[51:36] and his rider have he thrown into the
[51:39] sea."
[51:40] So they had something to sing about. God
[51:42] had just delivered them from their
[51:44] trial.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; God did the very same thing for you and
[51:48] I.
[51:50] We were all walking under the devil
[51:52] taskmaster when God saved us.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; God who was rich in mercy for his great
[51:58] love wherewith he loved us even when we
[52:00] were dead in sins have he quickened us
[52:02] together with Christ. For by grace are
[52:05] you saved through faith and that not of
[52:07] yourselves. It is the gift of God. Now,
[52:11] God did not just want to save us from
[52:15] going to hell, but he wanted to uh bring
[52:20] us into the nature of God, our promised
[52:23] land. Are you with me? He didn't want to
[52:26] just save us from our current trial, our
[52:29] current situation. What he has in mind
[52:32] going through our trials today is that
[52:35] he wants to build a character that
[52:38] brings about the same nature that he
[52:40] has. And he can't give us the nature of
[52:44] Christ as um a gift because brother
[52:48] Brandham said character is never going
[52:50] to be a gift. He said it's going to be a
[52:53] victory
[52:54] &gt;&gt; and the only way you're going to get a
[52:55] victory is if you're in a battle and
[52:57] that's what trials are.
[53:00] So,
[53:02] we'll never when we're singing I'm bound
[53:05] for the promised land. I think what we
[53:07] should be thinking about is I'm going to
[53:09] be going through a trial
[53:11] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to I'm going to get
[53:12] character because I'm going to make the
[53:14] right decisions in the trial. I'm going
[53:16] to do what God wants me to do. I'm going
[53:19] to act the way God wants me to act in my
[53:22] trial. And I'm going to come forth with
[53:24] a character that I didn't have before
[53:26] the trial happened.
[53:30] God said, 'Ive come down to deliver them
[53:33] out of the land of the Egyptians and to
[53:34] bring them up out of that land unto a
[53:37] good land, a large land, a land that
[53:40] flowth with milk and honey. Two separate
[53:42] things.
[53:44] God was going to bring out He was going
[53:47] to bring us out of the world with a
[53:50] deliverance, which he did, and he was
[53:52] going to bring us into Christ by
[53:54] overcoming our nature.
[53:58] And the land is placed that God wants us
[54:02] to dwell is with him. Now understand
[54:04] that this land is it already is
[54:07] inhabited by an enemy. So there's an
[54:10] evil nature inside of us that we were
[54:13] born with and we have to be born again.
[54:16] We have to overcome it. And that is the
[54:19] place that God wants to dwell in. He
[54:21] wants to dwell in our heart. But you
[54:24] know our heart is unruly. It's evil. It
[54:27] has things that well, we can't even be
[54:31] trusted, right? Above all, it's evil.
[54:33] So, we need God um to to to help us
[54:38] overcome that selfish nature to where we
[54:41] can literally live for others. Amen. Are
[54:44] you with me? Okay. So, I got a plan
[54:47] today. The plan is we're going to say
[54:50] amen 20 times every service, but we're
[54:54] going to start with this service. 20
[54:56] times, every one of us is going to say
[55:00] amen, not all at one time. We're going
[55:02] to space it out.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; They kind of keep the flow of things
[55:06] going. We're not gonna we're not going
[55:09] to be in here like we're watching a
[55:11] movie.
[55:13] We're going to be getting behind the
[55:16] word.
[55:17] Exodus chapter 15 verse 22.
[55:21] Exodus chapter 15 verse 22.
[55:27] Now I want to say this. In order for us
[55:31] to take the land or to take the Holy
[55:34] Ghost, we've got to be faithful in the
[55:37] wilderness.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; So we we God comes into our life. We
[55:45] repent. We get baptized and we say, "I'm
[55:48] going to serve God. I'm going to be a
[55:50] Christian." Well, at that point, we're
[55:53] not filled with the Holy Ghost. We have
[55:56] to go through a process. It's like a
[55:58] wilderness process to where you go
[56:01] through trials. If we're not faithful in
[56:05] those trials, it is impossible to get
[56:08] the Holy Ghost.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; He's going to say it.
[56:13] It's impossible. He gives the Holy Ghost
[56:15] to them that obey him.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; And it's through that experience in the
[56:19] wilderness that takes you into the
[56:22] promised land. I'm going to show you
[56:23] this scripturally.
[56:25] Exodus 15 verse 22 22. So Moses brought
[56:29] Israel from the Red Sea and they went
[56:33] out into the wilderness of Shure and
[56:35] they went three days in the wilderness
[56:37] and found no water. This is their first
[56:40] trial.
[56:41] And when they came to Mara, they could
[56:44] not drink of the waters of Mara, for
[56:47] they were bitter. You ever have bitter
[56:49] water or bitter coffee?
[56:52] Therefore, the name of it was called
[56:53] Mara. And the people murmured against
[56:59] Moses. Why? Against Moses,
[57:02] the leadership of God, saying, "What
[57:06] shall we drink?" And he cried unto the
[57:08] Lord. And the Lord showed him a tree
[57:11] which when he had cast into the waters,
[57:14] the waters were made sweet.
[57:18] There he made for them a statue and
[57:20] ordinance. There he proved them. Boy,
[57:24] you could say it like this. That means
[57:25] tested them. He tested them three days.
[57:30] Did they pass the test?
[57:33] They didn't pass the test. Three days
[57:35] after seeing the greatest nation
[57:39] in the world destroyed,
[57:43] they had scars all over their backs
[57:46] from being whipped.
[57:49] I'm sure some of them were still had
[57:51] things going on in their life from being
[57:54] tortured.
[57:56] And now
[57:59] they're they're feeling that God is not
[58:01] with them in their trial.
[58:05] So they murmured.
[58:11] They murmured.
[58:14] That was the the the greatest thing to
[58:18] experience. It wasn't something that
[58:19] happened on the other side of the world.
[58:21] They were part of it. They saw their
[58:23] enemy drown.
[58:26] They got the the afflictions on their
[58:28] body.
[58:30] Just three days in a trial.
[58:34] And they're literally crucifying Moses
[58:39] instead of saying, "God, though the
[58:42] waters are bitter, though this trial is
[58:44] bitter, though this situation is bitter,
[58:48] my God is able to make this situation
[58:50] sweet.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; God is able to take every one of our
[58:53] situations
[58:55] &gt;&gt; and make them sweet." WHEN HE IS CAST
[58:58] INTO THE SITUATION, WHEN he is cast in
[59:01] to your situation, then it becomes
[59:04] sweet.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; But if you leave him out and you're
[59:08] murmuring and complaining, you will not
[59:10] find God.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Verse 26. And he said, "If thou wil
[59:15] diligently hearken to the voice of the
[59:18] Lord thy God, and will do that which is
[59:21] right in his sight, and will give ear to
[59:24] his commandments, and keep all his
[59:26] statutes, I will put none of these
[59:28] diseases upon thee, which I have brought
[59:31] upon the Egyptians, for I am the Lord
[59:33] that health thee."
[59:36] It It looks pretty pretty clear here.
[59:40] He's saying to his own children, "If you
[59:42] do what I tell you to do, I will bless
[59:45] you.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; If you don't do what I ask you to do,
[59:51] then you're going to get these problems
[59:53] in your life."
[59:55] &gt;&gt; It's that it's it's that simple.
[59:59] That's why, you know, we can we can go
[1:00:01] through our trials,
[1:00:04] never see God, never admit God is
[1:00:07] around, but God is still around.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; And we're still either bringing respect
[1:00:12] to God or disrespect to God by our
[1:00:16] attitude of how we view God in the
[1:00:19] trial.
[1:00:21] Numbers chapter 14 verse 21.
[1:00:25] Numbers chapter 14 verse 21.
[1:00:28] But as truly as I live, all the earth,
[1:00:33] God is speaking here, shall be filled
[1:00:36] with the glory of the Lord.
[1:00:38] Because all those men which seen my
[1:00:43] glory,
[1:00:45] my miracles, which I did in Egypt, and
[1:00:48] in the wilderness, and have tempted me
[1:00:53] now these 10 times,
[1:00:58] and have not hearkened to my voice,
[1:01:02] surely they shall not see the promised
[1:01:05] land, which I swear unto their fathers,
[1:01:08] Neither shall any of them that provoke
[1:01:11] me see it.
[1:01:14] Now notice it wasn't because they they
[1:01:18] didn't come out of Egypt. They came out
[1:01:19] of Egypt. It was because they were
[1:01:24] murmuring and complaining
[1:01:26] during their trials from the time they
[1:01:30] got baptized to the time they got FILLED
[1:01:33] WITH THE HOLY GHOST. They murmured and
[1:01:36] complained. And during those trials,
[1:01:39] because they murmured and complained,
[1:01:41] THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED BY God to go in the
[1:01:44] promised land.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO. God said,
[1:01:48] "No."
[1:01:50] Now, at the beginning, God said, "I
[1:01:52] brought them out to take them in."
[1:01:56] But because they murmured and complained
[1:01:58] all along, they chided, they complained,
[1:02:02] they they spoke against the the
[1:02:04] leadership that God gave them. God said,
[1:02:07] "Look, I gave you 10 chances."
[1:02:11] And all 10 chances, you wanted to murmur
[1:02:14] and complain.
[1:02:16] I'm making a decision. That's not who I
[1:02:18] want to live with.
[1:02:22] That's not who my bride's going to be.
[1:02:26] I know this is strong, but we've got to
[1:02:28] we've got to be able to see God in our
[1:02:30] lives.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; God proved and he tested his people in
[1:02:38] the wilderness.
[1:02:43] Verse 24.
[1:02:46] But
[1:02:48] um did I read 23?
[1:02:51] Okay. 24. But my So they weren't Yeah,
[1:02:54] that's right. I did. So they couldn't
[1:02:56] see it because they provoked him. But my
[1:02:58] servant Jacob because or Caleb um sorry
[1:03:02] because he had another spirit,
[1:03:07] another spirit. So he must have not
[1:03:10] murmured and complained.
[1:03:13] He had another spirit with him. And have
[1:03:15] followed me fully. In other words,
[1:03:18] trusted him.
[1:03:21] him will I bring into the land where
[1:03:24] unto he went and his seed shall
[1:03:28] possess it.
[1:03:30] So God proved and he tested his people
[1:03:33] in the wilderness and they grumbled.
[1:03:35] They complained about the hardships.
[1:03:38] They failed 10 times
[1:03:42] and they just disobeyed God's word. And
[1:03:46] because of it, they weren't allowed to
[1:03:48] go into the promised land. It is
[1:03:50] important to note that every trial that
[1:03:52] we go through is an opportunity
[1:03:56] for the necessity to build character.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; A trial does not build character.
[1:04:03] Always remember that trials do not build
[1:04:06] character. What builds character is your
[1:04:10] decision to do what God wants you to do
[1:04:12] in that trial. That is what builds
[1:04:15] character.
[1:04:20] When we murmur, grumble, complain, or
[1:04:23] neglect God's word during our trials,
[1:04:25] we're losing the character we need for a
[1:04:28] full nature change.
[1:04:31] And what is God coming for? He's coming
[1:04:33] for a bride without spot or wrinkle.
[1:04:35] Who's going in a rapture?
[1:04:38] Those that are have been perfected.
[1:04:41] They've taken advantage of the trials
[1:04:44] that they went through. They got serious
[1:04:46] about God. They didn't play church. They
[1:04:49] they didn't just uh sit on the sideline.
[1:04:53] They just they just weren't waiting.
[1:04:55] They they literally were very interested
[1:04:58] in becoming just like Jesus.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; So when we're in our trials, God is
[1:05:04] looking for us to trust him.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; We don't need to know how God is going
[1:05:10] to work out the situation. We don't need
[1:05:12] to be smart. We don't need to figure it
[1:05:16] out. But what we have to do is don't
[1:05:18] murmur and complain. Trust him.
[1:05:24] Because we got we got good examples of
[1:05:26] what not to do.
[1:05:29] Trials open the door for real growth to
[1:05:32] take place. That's what it does.
[1:05:36] You know, that's why we should count it
[1:05:37] all joy
[1:05:39] because without a trials,
[1:05:43] character can't really be built.
[1:05:47] You're not going to be able to go to a
[1:05:49] seminary and learn all about the Bible
[1:05:51] and say you got character.
[1:05:55] You can you can get knowledge, but that
[1:05:57] ain't character.
[1:06:01] God hates a complainer.
[1:06:06] All right, we got two amens.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Two amens. But we're all guilty of
[1:06:10] complaining, right?
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; But we should all be saying amen.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Paul told Timothy to endure hardness as
[1:06:19] a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
[1:06:22] Paul said, "I endure all things for the
[1:06:26] elect's sake." In other words, no
[1:06:29] complaining.
[1:06:30] Brother Ram said in the message, "Speak
[1:06:32] to this rock."
[1:06:34] The children of Israel were were
[1:06:36] murmuring and chiding. And Brother Ram
[1:06:38] says, "Why did He's he's he's quoting
[1:06:40] them?" He says, "Why did you bring us
[1:06:43] out here? Why do we have to stay here?
[1:06:46] I'd rather be down in Egypt anytime. Why
[1:06:49] did we die? Why didn't we just die
[1:06:51] there? Let Pharaoh kill us. Be better
[1:06:54] than uh being out there."
[1:06:57] Brother Brandham says, "If that isn't
[1:06:59] like the complaints of the church today,
[1:07:04] so easy they forget the hand of God. So
[1:07:07] easy they forget it. Listen what taken
[1:07:10] place. Oh, it's tremendous.
[1:07:14] Oh, we'd rather die down there. Look at
[1:07:17] those people had left from eating the
[1:07:20] onions and the garlics of Egypt. And God
[1:07:23] had rained bread down out of heaven,
[1:07:26] angels food, and fed them with it. And
[1:07:29] they were still complaining.
[1:07:32] But God give the church angels food, the
[1:07:37] Holy Spirit, and they're still
[1:07:38] complaining about something all the
[1:07:41] time, continuously. So, Brother Ram's
[1:07:43] just talking about even in today's
[1:07:45] church that God is here, but yet the
[1:07:49] church finds something to complain
[1:07:51] about.
[1:07:54] They uh left the the garlics to eat
[1:07:58] angels food and the angels prepared in
[1:08:00] heaven and rain down on the food that
[1:08:02] they did eat. And still they were
[1:08:04] complaining. They left the old money
[1:08:06] rivers of Nile drinking that old muddy
[1:08:09] water and was drinking from the
[1:08:11] spiritual rock of pure salvation and
[1:08:13] water and was complaining about it. Yes.
[1:08:15] Always complain because a little hard
[1:08:18] time struck them.
[1:08:22] all that just as soon as you have your
[1:08:24] first trial, come into the meeting, see
[1:08:26] the Holy Spirit, and go back out and
[1:08:28] have a tummy ache and say, "Well, maybe
[1:08:30] I I never got healed." Shame on you.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Sure, you got healed if you believed it.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Your feelings has nothing to do with it.
[1:08:38] It's your faith. If we look at it,
[1:08:41] that's what God sees is your faith, not
[1:08:43] your feelings. Jesus never said, "Did
[1:08:45] you feel it?" He said, "Did you believe
[1:08:47] it?" That's the idea.
[1:08:49] But they left the boasting physicians of
[1:08:52] Egypt down there saying, "Oh, we're the
[1:08:55] doctors uh days of miracles has passed
[1:08:59] to be with the great physician." And 40
[1:09:02] years journey, hundreds and thousands of
[1:09:05] little babies born and all kinds of
[1:09:07] sickness and and old people. There
[1:09:09] wasn't a feeble one among them.
[1:09:15] Think about that journey they had. He
[1:09:18] said there were many babies born and and
[1:09:21] there wasn't a feeble one among them
[1:09:25] with the one great physician. Brother
[1:09:28] says, "Hallelujah." He says, "Yet they
[1:09:31] were complaining
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; when the miracles were happening right
[1:09:35] there among them.
[1:09:38] They were blind. They were carnal. They
[1:09:41] had left the place down there where they
[1:09:43] said the days of miracles were passed
[1:09:45] there. Um, that's where you left. You
[1:09:48] left those places that said the days of
[1:09:50] miracles have passed. They left that in
[1:09:54] to be where the signs and wonders
[1:09:56] followed the believer and still were
[1:09:59] complaining. He said, "Isn't that just
[1:10:01] like the people today?"
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Ram's making it real clear
[1:10:07] here that complaining is not where God
[1:10:10] is at.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; We're complaining is you'll not find
[1:10:15] God. We're complaining is you'll find a
[1:10:17] wrong spirit.
[1:10:19] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:10:22] 10. We're going to take a look at this
[1:10:24] in the New Testament. 1 Corinthians
[1:10:26] chapter 10 verse number one. Moreover,
[1:10:29] brethren, I would not
[1:10:32] that you should be ignorant.
[1:10:35] How that all our fathers were under the
[1:10:37] cloud. All passed through the sea. All
[1:10:39] were baptized unto Moses in the cloud
[1:10:41] and in the sea. And all did eat the same
[1:10:43] spiritual meme. And all drank that same
[1:10:46] spiritual drink, for they drank of that
[1:10:48] spiritual rock that followed them. And
[1:10:50] that rock was Christ.
[1:10:52] But with many of them God was not well
[1:10:54] pleased, for they were overthrown where?
[1:10:56] In the wilderness. For that was from the
[1:10:58] time they were baptized to the time they
[1:11:01] got the Holy Ghost. How many times have
[1:11:02] we seen people come and and
[1:11:06] they they serve God for a while and they
[1:11:08] just quit.
[1:11:12] Something happens. This is such a
[1:11:14] crucial time to be to to recognize God
[1:11:17] in your life personally
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; because
[1:11:22] the whole church could go belly up. But
[1:11:25] if you're in tune with God in the middle
[1:11:27] of that trial,
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; God will use that for your character
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; to get you into a rapture.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Because that's what it is all about.
[1:11:38] We're wait, you know, we we we want to
[1:11:40] make a rapture. Now, here's the thing.
[1:11:43] If if we die before the rapture, we
[1:11:46] still want to be bride.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; So, we still want to have the character
[1:11:51] that we need through our trials.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; All right. Verse six. Now, these things
[1:12:00] were our examples. Notice, now these
[1:12:03] things were our examples. This was for
[1:12:05] us. This happened. Everything in the Old
[1:12:08] Testament was for us spiritually.
[1:12:11] to the intent that we should not lust
[1:12:13] after evil things as they lusted. All
[1:12:16] right, let's skip down to verse nine.
[1:12:18] Neither let us tempt Christ as some of
[1:12:21] them tempted and were destroyed by the
[1:12:24] serpents. Neither murmur ye as some of
[1:12:27] them also murmured and were destroyed of
[1:12:30] the destroyer. Did you notice God did
[1:12:33] not destroy them?
[1:12:43] God allowed the enemy to destroy them.
[1:12:52] That's why, you know, he gives everybody
[1:12:53] the opportunity,
[1:12:55] you know, come to heaven. And he says,
[1:12:58] if you don't want to come to heaven, you
[1:13:00] choose not to come to heaven to follow
[1:13:02] me, that's fine. You don't have to. But
[1:13:04] when they die, there's no choice to be
[1:13:06] made at that time because they made it
[1:13:07] on earth.
[1:13:09] Right? So
[1:13:12] the the if we want to um you know cater
[1:13:16] around to certain spirits,
[1:13:20] um those are the same spirits that will
[1:13:23] destroy us.
[1:13:25] You understand what I'm saying?
[1:13:29] Um, I I don't care any kind of spirit.
[1:13:34] You you you you baby that thing, all of
[1:13:37] a sudden it's going to bring you into
[1:13:38] bondage. It it just it's just the way it
[1:13:41] is. Verse 11. Now all these things
[1:13:44] happen unto them for examples,
[1:13:47] and they are written for us, for our
[1:13:49] admonition, our attention, our warning,
[1:13:53] upon whom the ends of the world are
[1:13:55] come. Wherefore let him that thinkketh
[1:13:57] he standeth, let him take heed, lest
[1:14:01] he's the one that falls. In other words,
[1:14:03] humble yourself in the sight of the
[1:14:06] Lord.
[1:14:08] Verse 13, our opening scripture. There
[1:14:10] have no temptation taken you, but such
[1:14:14] is common to man. But God is faithful,
[1:14:17] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:14:19] above that you're able, but will with
[1:14:22] the temptation also.
[1:14:26] Also, in other words, he ain't taking
[1:14:27] the temptation away. He's not taking the
[1:14:29] try away, but also will make a way of
[1:14:31] escape that you may be able to bear it.
[1:14:40] We're overcomers.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; God bore our sins at Calvary. He told us
[1:14:48] to pick up our cross
[1:14:51] and bear it for one another.
[1:14:56] God doesn't want somebody else to fix
[1:14:58] our problems.
[1:15:00] My trials are for me.
[1:15:03] Your trials are for you.
[1:15:06] It's between you and God. It's to build
[1:15:08] your character.
[1:15:12] Now, God may allow
[1:15:15] uh your trial to affect me
[1:15:22] and my attitude about that will
[1:15:24] determine my character.
[1:15:29] And at at the end, we all want character
[1:15:31] that that God says, "Yes, I want you to
[1:15:33] come be my bride.
[1:15:35] That's what we're looking for. But it
[1:15:37] will never be a gift. You can never sit
[1:15:38] in church, hear the word of God, and
[1:15:40] have character.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Just just like none of us can say, "I've
[1:15:46] been through more trials than you." So
[1:15:48] what?
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; So what? If you can overcome trials,
[1:15:54] that is what means a lot.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Because that's where character is drawn
[1:16:00] from is is is overcoming a trial.
[1:16:06] The way of escape is by trusting and
[1:16:09] obeying God inside of you. So, you're
[1:16:12] going through a trial and you got this
[1:16:13] thing and it's affecting uh your health.
[1:16:16] It's affecting your finances. It's
[1:16:17] affecting you mentally uh spiritually.
[1:16:21] It's affecting friendships. It's
[1:16:23] affecting uh relationships. It's
[1:16:26] affecting uh your time management. You
[1:16:30] got these trials going on and it's
[1:16:32] affecting you. The answer is inside of
[1:16:36] you. Hear God speak to you what to do. I
[1:16:40] don't know what he's going to tell you
[1:16:42] to do, but he will speak to you and
[1:16:44] he'll tell you to do something. Now,
[1:16:47] until he tells you, it's our job to get
[1:16:50] on our knees and wait on the Lord
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; about our trial.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; But he will speak to you and you have to
[1:16:57] trust him.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; It'll be inside.
[1:17:02] I believe that with all my heart.
[1:17:05] Be looking for him to whisper his word
[1:17:08] to you. Don't look at the problem, but
[1:17:11] look at the problem solver.
[1:17:15] God allowed the problem to build your
[1:17:17] faith. He ain't going to take it away.
[1:17:19] God allowed the problem to build your
[1:17:22] character. He ain't going to take it
[1:17:23] away. We've got to We've got to make
[1:17:26] sure we don't murmur, don't complain,
[1:17:29] and look to the problem solver. And
[1:17:32] that's what the children of Israel
[1:17:33] didn't do. They just murmured and
[1:17:36] complained. And Moses, you should,
[1:17:38] you're just a bad leader.
[1:17:41] You don't even know how to lead us,
[1:17:42] right? You lead us to all these problems
[1:17:44] that we're going through.
[1:17:48] They murmured and they complained.
[1:17:54] No, God was with them. Proved it. Their
[1:17:59] shoes never wore out.
[1:18:01] They were always fed. They were led by
[1:18:04] the pillar of fire,
[1:18:07] the pillar of cloud. God was with them,
[1:18:10] but yet they still complained because
[1:18:13] trials. Just trials.
[1:18:19] Don't complain with trials. Let 2026 be
[1:18:23] the year that we just stop complaining.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Let it be the year we stop.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because all we're doing is we're
[1:18:32] we're we're telling God we're not bride.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; We're telling God that we're just we're
[1:18:38] we're we're we're those that died in the
[1:18:40] wilderness. That's all we're telling
[1:18:41] God.
[1:18:46] Uh I'm
[1:18:48] we're all going to fall short once in a
[1:18:51] while,
[1:18:53] but what we need to have as a heart to
[1:18:56] put it behind us
[1:18:58] and to start looking for God in our
[1:19:00] lives.
[1:19:02] And it's up to us individually to do
[1:19:05] that. We can't just fix one another's
[1:19:08] problems.
[1:19:09] it. If you think about it, God is the
[1:19:12] only one that can fix all of our
[1:19:14] problems.
[1:19:15] God is the only one.
[1:19:18] Faith comes from God.
[1:19:24] When we murmur and we're complaining,
[1:19:26] we're actually not looking to the
[1:19:27] problem solver.
[1:19:30] We're thinking that the problem solver,
[1:19:32] you know,
[1:19:34] didn't do his job or something, right?
[1:19:37] like like the the water's bitter.
[1:19:41] So, we need the fear of the Lord. We
[1:19:42] need to say, I I I could be wrong the
[1:19:44] way I'm looking at I need to I need to
[1:19:46] be renewed in my mind at the way I'm
[1:19:49] looking at this situation.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; It's okay that you don't see God.
[1:19:56] It's okay you don't got the answer to
[1:19:59] your situation, but it's not okay that
[1:20:02] you don't believe and you don't trust.
[1:20:05] You've got to believe and trust God in
[1:20:08] your situation.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 2:12.
[1:20:12] Philippians 2:12 says, "Wherefore, my
[1:20:15] beloved, as you have always obeyed, not
[1:20:18] as in my presence only, but now much
[1:20:22] more in my absence.
[1:20:24] Work out your own salvation with fear
[1:20:26] and trement." Now, I want us to try to
[1:20:28] apply this if we could today, not just
[1:20:30] to our original salvation, but every
[1:20:32] time we got a a trial that we're going
[1:20:34] through to be saved from our trials.
[1:20:38] For it is God which workketh in you.
[1:20:43] Notice where the answer is coming from.
[1:20:45] For it is God which workketh in you both
[1:20:48] to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Do all things without murmurings and
[1:20:54] disputings. There it is again.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; You know, we just we just choose a side.
[1:21:00] You know, it would be better to bite
[1:21:02] your tongue and bleed
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; than to murmur and complain.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Just bite your tongue. Murmur and
[1:21:08] complain. God will smile upon you.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; When we're in a trial, it is for our
[1:21:15] good. Remember that. It's for our good.
[1:21:20] It's for our character.
[1:21:22] It's for our overcoming victory. And we
[1:21:25] need to overcome in order to take the
[1:21:27] final promised land which is what a
[1:21:31] complete nature change. You know there
[1:21:34] are too many Christians, believers, they
[1:21:38] think like this. Well, I'm saved.
[1:21:42] And that's all they think about. I'm
[1:21:44] saved.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; I repented. I got baptized. And I got
[1:21:49] saved last year, two years ago, 20 years
[1:21:52] ago. Yeah,
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; that's all they think. I'm saved.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; But they don't think about a nature
[1:21:57] change.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; And if they do, they're only thinking
[1:22:04] about the nature that has changed.
[1:22:09] You understand?
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; They're not thinking about what yet has
[1:22:12] to be changed.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; They're not thinking about what more has
[1:22:16] to be changed in their life.
[1:22:22] We know that when he shall appear, we
[1:22:24] shall be like him, for we shall see him
[1:22:28] as he is. Paul said, "Oh, that I might
[1:22:30] know him more." Job said, "I I won't be
[1:22:32] satisfied to awake in his likeness." So
[1:22:34] there's this this yearning
[1:22:37] to arm yourself with the same mind of
[1:22:40] Christ and to to become like him, to be
[1:22:42] able to live for others, to to to to not
[1:22:46] worry about your reputation and and and
[1:22:48] to worry about what you want, but to be
[1:22:50] but to to to think about others and what
[1:22:53] they need. Think about saving other
[1:22:56] people.
[1:22:57] Remember, change is needed for growth.
[1:23:01] And what does it really take to bring
[1:23:03] about a positive change in your life? It
[1:23:06] takes making a different decision in the
[1:23:11] middle of your trials. Because if you
[1:23:12] always do what you always done, you're
[1:23:13] always going to get what you always got.
[1:23:18] We're all prone to be bothered in a
[1:23:21] trial. We're just prone to do that. But
[1:23:24] we got to make a different decision.
[1:23:27] We just got to stop in our tracks and
[1:23:29] say, "I don't feel it. I don't feel God.
[1:23:33] I don't see God.
[1:23:36] But the word says he's here.
[1:23:39] I'm going to trust him. I'm going to
[1:23:41] trust him. I'm going to choose the
[1:23:44] harder way." Remember what God told
[1:23:46] Brother Brand, "Because you chose the
[1:23:48] harder way, a a a huge part of heaven
[1:23:52] awaits you." And he said the harder way
[1:23:55] was his way. It was the precise way.
[1:23:59] And because of this decision, this
[1:24:02] momentous decision, a huge part of
[1:24:05] heaven awaits thee. And this will bring
[1:24:10] to pass
[1:24:12] this,
[1:24:14] paraphrasing, this victory in divine
[1:24:16] love.
[1:24:18] And I'll tell you, if there's if there's
[1:24:19] one thing that Brother Brandham said
[1:24:20] when he got back from the curtain time,
[1:24:22] he says, "Make sure you lay everything
[1:24:23] aside until you get perfect love.
[1:24:27] It's a it's a victory." When you can
[1:24:29] love everybody,
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; I am telling you, you got victory.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; You got victory. But when you have to
[1:24:37] have things a certain way with some in
[1:24:39] order to love them, we're our love is
[1:24:42] short, right? It it's short.
[1:24:46] Hebrews 11:25 says, "Moses
[1:24:50] chose rather to suffer." Notice the word
[1:24:54] chose. Moses Moses chose rather to
[1:24:58] suffer affliction with the people of
[1:25:01] God. How many times you've been in a
[1:25:02] trial and you made this decision? I am
[1:25:04] choosing to suffer with this person.
[1:25:08] I'm I I am choosing to suffer with my
[1:25:10] brother. I'm choosing to suffer with my
[1:25:13] sister. I'm choosing to suffer with my
[1:25:15] husband. I'm choosing to suffer with my
[1:25:17] wife, my children, my mom, my dad. I'm
[1:25:21] choosing to suffer with them. No, our
[1:25:25] our human nature is I'm getting out of
[1:25:26] here. This is, you know, you handle it.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; But Moses chose to suffer willingly.
[1:25:37] Paul said, "Yay, doubtless I count all
[1:25:39] things but loss for the excellency of
[1:25:41] the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,
[1:25:43] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:25:49] things, and do count them but dung, that
[1:25:52] I might win Christ."
[1:25:55] We have to be willing to give up
[1:25:59] in order to receive.
[1:26:02] We don't got time, but you can write
[1:26:03] this down. Paul comparing his ministry
[1:26:06] with other ministers in 2 Corinthians
[1:26:08] 11:es
[1:26:10] 23-30.
[1:26:12] And he talked about all the things that
[1:26:15] he had to suffer through
[1:26:18] for one reason,
[1:26:20] for the elect's sake.
[1:26:23] He did it that other people could be
[1:26:25] saved. the shipwrecks, the the beatings.
[1:26:28] He could have just he could have fought
[1:26:29] back and, you know, called him every
[1:26:32] name in the book and made him, you know,
[1:26:34] whip another 39 times and then revile
[1:26:38] back and basically died by rebelling.
[1:26:45] But he did it that he could get as many
[1:26:48] people saved as possible. Yeah.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; And when you're going through a trial,
[1:26:54] people are watching your life.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; They're they're they're watching how
[1:26:59] you're going to react.
[1:27:02] That I I they and you have an
[1:27:04] opportunity
[1:27:06] to let them see that you believe in a
[1:27:08] God that's able,
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; that a God is faithful. The word says
[1:27:13] God is faithful. He would not he would
[1:27:16] not tempt you above that you are able.
[1:27:18] Of course, the devil wants to get us to
[1:27:22] a place where we don't trust God and we
[1:27:24] feel,
[1:27:26] but God is faithful.
[1:27:30] Paul said in 2 Corinthians 12:10,
[1:27:33] "Therefore, I take pleasure in
[1:27:34] infirmities and reproaches and
[1:27:36] necessities and persecutions and
[1:27:38] distresses for Christ's sake, for when
[1:27:40] I'm weak, that I'm strong." He actually
[1:27:42] took pleasure in his trials. Wow. This
[1:27:46] is a this is a different breed.
[1:27:48] Right? This is a different breed.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; But in this,
[1:27:54] we're going to see God. We're going to
[1:27:56] see God. I just want, you know, 2026 to
[1:27:59] be different.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; This is this is a good different. This
[1:28:03] is a really good different. 2
[1:28:05] Corinthians 4:7. I want to go through
[1:28:08] these scriptures.
[1:28:11] I should have told you I had some hay as
[1:28:15] brother John Lefonte would say on my
[1:28:17] pitchfork. Not my pitchfork. He didn't
[1:28:19] say pitchfork. Did he say pitchfork? It
[1:28:21] was just on his on his lot of hate hole
[1:28:24] or however he said that. All right. 2
[1:28:27] Corinthians 4:7 says, "But we," think
[1:28:30] about this. He's talking about taking
[1:28:32] pleasure in infirmities. Now he says,
[1:28:34] "But we have this treasure in earthn
[1:28:37] vessels that the excellency of the power
[1:28:39] may be of God and not of us." So he's
[1:28:43] talking about something that's inside of
[1:28:45] him. A treasure that's inside. Well,
[1:28:48] that was God,
[1:28:50] right? And he says, "For we are troubled
[1:28:53] on every side yet not distressed."
[1:28:58] We're we're perplexed. Why is this thing
[1:29:00] happening? But not in despair.
[1:29:03] We're persecuted
[1:29:05] by sometimes our own family, but we're
[1:29:08] not forsaken.
[1:29:10] We're cast down, but we're not
[1:29:13] destroyed. What's going on in our lives?
[1:29:16] Always bearing about in in the body, our
[1:29:21] bodies, the dying of the Lord Jesus,
[1:29:25] that the life also of Jesus might be
[1:29:28] made manifest in our body. See, there's
[1:29:30] two things happening. If we're willing
[1:29:33] to die, then Christ can be manifested.
[1:29:38] For we which live are always delivered
[1:29:41] unto the death for Jesus' sake, that the
[1:29:45] life also of Jesus might be made
[1:29:47] manifest in our mortal body. That's
[1:29:51] recognizing God in your trial, my
[1:29:53] friend. So then death workketh in us,
[1:29:56] but life in you. Now notice a lot of the
[1:30:00] trials that we go through, they're just
[1:30:03] not a lot of times they're just not
[1:30:06] between you and and God.
[1:30:09] God usually involves other people.
[1:30:12] Somehow
[1:30:14] somebody's under gets under your skin.
[1:30:16] Something happens.
[1:30:17] Something they, you know, if you
[1:30:19] wouldn't have done this, this would have
[1:30:21] been better. You know what I'm trying to
[1:30:24] say?
[1:30:26] So, but God wants you to be Christ to
[1:30:29] that person
[1:30:31] even though you feel they don't deserve
[1:30:33] it
[1:30:35] because in all honesty, none of us
[1:30:37] deserve Christ going to Calvary for us.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; But God just wants to manifest Calvary
[1:30:43] again to another person.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; That God died for them. It's the
[1:30:48] goodness of God that leads man to
[1:30:50] repentance, is it not?
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; All right. Psalms 95. We're not going to
[1:30:54] be able to get through everything, but
[1:30:56] we do want to take a couple couple
[1:30:59] minutes. Psalms 95 verse1.
[1:31:03] Now, it's up to us. We're this whole
[1:31:07] message is about us when we go through
[1:31:09] our trials, how we want to stand in
[1:31:11] 2026. Oh, come, let us sing unto the
[1:31:14] Lord. Let us make a joyful noise to the
[1:31:16] rock of our salvation. Let us come
[1:31:18] before his presence with thanksgiving,
[1:31:20] and make a joyful noise unto him with
[1:31:23] psalms. For the Lord is a great God, and
[1:31:27] a great king above all gods.
[1:31:32] In his hand are the deep places of the
[1:31:34] earth, the strength of the hills. In his
[1:31:36] also the sea is his, and he had made it,
[1:31:41] and his hands have formed the dry land.
[1:31:43] Oh, come let us worship and bow down.
[1:31:45] Let us kneel before the Lord our maker
[1:31:47] for he is our God and we are the people
[1:31:50] of his pasture and the sheep of his hand
[1:31:53] today. Today today
[1:31:56] if you will hear his voice.
[1:31:59] Harden not your heart in your trial as
[1:32:03] in the provocation as in the day of
[1:32:05] temptation in the wilderness
[1:32:09] when your fathers tempted me and proved
[1:32:11] me and saw my works. Now God is wanting
[1:32:15] us to see the distinct difference
[1:32:17] between the children of Israel and us
[1:32:21] because he's talking about us now. And
[1:32:24] you can you can read this in in Hebrews
[1:32:27] the same way. 40 years long was I agreed
[1:32:30] with this generation and said it is a
[1:32:34] people
[1:32:36] that do heir. Notice where the heir is
[1:32:38] happening in their heart. for they have
[1:32:42] not known my ways. And that's why he
[1:32:44] said when you're going through a trial,
[1:32:46] the way of escape is in your heart.
[1:32:51] That is where you're going to hear God
[1:32:53] speak to you if you uh harden not your
[1:32:57] heart because God's speaking. He's
[1:32:59] showing you the way of say. He's showing
[1:33:01] you how to act. He's showing you what
[1:33:03] attitude to have. He's showing you this
[1:33:05] is where you trust God is in your heart.
[1:33:08] Amen.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Unto whom I swear in my wrath that they
[1:33:12] should not enter into my rest. And Paul
[1:33:14] picks this up in Hebrews 3:12. He says,
[1:33:18] "Take heed, therefore, brethren, lest
[1:33:20] there be in any of you an evil heart of
[1:33:22] unbelief and departing from the living
[1:33:24] God." Notice
[1:33:26] when you're in a trial and you trust
[1:33:28] God, you're actually believing in a
[1:33:31] living God.
[1:33:34] But when you step back and you murmur
[1:33:36] and you complain,
[1:33:39] you're like the children of Israel who
[1:33:42] just came through the Red Sea, was just
[1:33:44] delivered, dancing for a time, but then
[1:33:49] you go through a trial. You're
[1:33:51] murmuring, and you're complaining
[1:33:53] because you do not see the living God.
[1:34:00] So, it isn't that you're not believing
[1:34:02] in God. It's you don't believe he's
[1:34:05] living in your situation. You don't
[1:34:07] believe he's living in your trial.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; And you kind of depart from that that
[1:34:14] trial.
[1:34:16] Uh you you depart from having faith in
[1:34:19] God in that trial to stepping out and
[1:34:22] just murmuring and complaining about the
[1:34:24] trial.
[1:34:26] So you're departing from a living God to
[1:34:29] to talk about well where is God
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; you know brother preach that miracle or
[1:34:34] that that that's you know if God be with
[1:34:36] us where's all the miracles
[1:34:38] and sometimes we can have that that
[1:34:40] attitude that I I don't see God so God
[1:34:43] must not be here. No you must believe
[1:34:45] that God is here.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; So he says in verse 13 but exhort one
[1:34:50] another daily.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. While it is called today, lest any
[1:34:55] of you be hardened through the
[1:34:57] deceitfulness of sin, for you are made
[1:35:00] partakers of Christ or the promised land
[1:35:03] or the nature change if we hold the
[1:35:06] beginning of our confidence steadfast
[1:35:09] until the end.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; How beautiful God wants us to hold on to
[1:35:16] the end. To believe to the end. You
[1:35:19] know, I'd rather believe in God and not
[1:35:24] see what I want to see than to to tempt
[1:35:28] him and murmur and complain because I'm
[1:35:31] not seeing him.
[1:35:34] We're we're believers,
[1:35:36] right? We're we're we're church of
[1:35:38] believers. I just want to read this one
[1:35:40] quote and then we're going to we'll
[1:35:41] close. It's a few minutes after 9.
[1:35:43] Brother Brandham said in the United Time
[1:35:46] and Sign, he says, "I think one of the
[1:35:49] horrible things is to see a man or a
[1:35:53] woman that's constantly complaining."
[1:35:57] He says, "I've always thought, God, keep
[1:36:00] me from it." See, he said, now this is I
[1:36:05] want to read this to you. He said that
[1:36:09] weakens faith all the time. You know,
[1:36:14] wow, I never read that before.
[1:36:18] Complaining weakens your faith. Well,
[1:36:22] Brother Brandham said if you come up and
[1:36:24] you ask for prayer all the time, that
[1:36:26] weakens your faith.
[1:36:28] But so does complaining.
[1:36:32] It weakens your faith. So we all come to
[1:36:35] church. The Bible says faith cometh by
[1:36:37] hearing and hearing by the word of God.
[1:36:39] And we come in the church, God, I want
[1:36:41] to hear your word. I want my faith to be
[1:36:43] increased. I want to be stronger in the
[1:36:45] faith. I want to be able to pray for
[1:36:46] people. I want to see things happen. I
[1:36:48] want to be a a a woman of faith, a man
[1:36:50] of faith, a a child of God of faith. And
[1:36:53] so, we work real hard at building
[1:36:56] ourselves up in the most holy faith. and
[1:36:58] then we'll let some trial come along and
[1:37:00] easily get us to complain and and don't
[1:37:03] realize it weakens our faith when it's
[1:37:05] happening. What a trick of the devil.
[1:37:10] He says, "But I think one of the most
[1:37:11] horrible things is is for Satan to crown
[1:37:14] some person's life, a crabby old man or
[1:37:17] an old woman." You see, I hope, brother
[1:37:20] says, I hope I don't get to that place.
[1:37:24] Says, I hope that I can bear it. Bear
[1:37:27] what? He said, "My burdens and get to a
[1:37:31] spot where I want my life crowned with
[1:37:33] the glory of God, which is his long
[1:37:36] suffering, his gentleness, his peace,
[1:37:40] his meekness, filled with the Holy
[1:37:44] Spirit."
[1:37:47] I love that. I hope I never get to that
[1:37:50] place either. I want to be crowned with
[1:37:53] the glory of God, too. Don't you? Let's
[1:37:55] stand together. God bless you.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; God is faithful.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; He will make a way of escape. Just to
[1:38:17] know that we can go through a trial
[1:38:20] and know everything's going to be okay.
[1:38:25] There's scriptures in the Bible that all
[1:38:26] things work together for the good
[1:38:29] to them that love the Lord called
[1:38:31] according to his purpose. You think
[1:38:33] about it when trials come in our life. I
[1:38:36] know flat tires, car accidents, I don't
[1:38:39] care hitting a deer, I don't care what
[1:38:42] the act even our health when trials come
[1:38:45] in our life, this shoulder thing
[1:38:48] happening, your prostate, all these
[1:38:50] things that happen to us, we think, why
[1:38:52] did this happen? This has slowed this
[1:38:55] has slowed us down from progressing and
[1:38:58] doing our business and doing what we
[1:39:00] want to do. Why is this happen? This is
[1:39:02] how we think with our trials
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; and God says I am just interested in
[1:39:07] your character
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; and and and I I think the quicker we can
[1:39:13] get to the place of I trust you Lord.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; I'm going to trust you. Maybe that the
[1:39:19] maybe we'll get a little relief in those
[1:39:21] trials a little bit sometimes.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; I I think God wants to bless us that
[1:39:27] way. Don't you?
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that little chorus. I
[1:39:30] know the Lord will make a way for me.
[1:39:37] I know the Lord
[1:39:41] will make a way
[1:39:44] for me.
[1:39:48] I know the Lord will make a way
[1:39:54] for me.
[1:39:58] If I live a holy life,
[1:40:03] shun the wrong and do the right. I know
[1:40:08] the Lord will make a way
[1:40:12] for me.
[1:40:15] I know the Lord has laid his hand on me.
[1:40:17] I know the Lord has laid his hands
[1:40:22] on me.
[1:40:27] I know the Lord has laid his hands
[1:40:32] on me.
[1:40:36] If I live a holy life,
[1:40:41] shun the wrong and do the right. I know
[1:40:46] the Lord
[1:40:48] make a way
[1:40:50] for me.
[1:40:54] I know the Lord is coming back
[1:40:59] for me.
[1:41:02] High standard. I know the Lord is coming
[1:41:07] back
[1:41:08] for me.
[1:41:12] If I spend my life in prayer,
[1:41:17] I will meet him in the air. I know the
[1:41:22] Lord is coming back
[1:41:26] for me.
[1:41:31] Learning
[1:41:33] to lean.
[1:41:36] I'm learning
[1:41:38] to lean.
[1:41:40] I'm learning to lean on Jesus.
[1:41:49] Gaining
[1:41:51] more power
[1:41:53] than I've ever seen.
[1:41:57] I'm learning to lean
[1:42:02] on G
[1:42:04] right in our trials. Oh, learning
[1:42:08] to lean.
[1:42:10] I'm learning
[1:42:12] to lean.
[1:42:14] I'm learning to lean
[1:42:18] on Jesus.
[1:42:23] gaining
[1:42:25] more power
[1:42:27] than I've ever seen.
[1:42:31] I'm learning to lean on Jesus.
[1:42:41] Amen.
[1:42:44] I'm so glad that he's encouraging us to
[1:42:47] lean upon him.
[1:42:49] Amen. Depend upon him. Amen.
[1:42:54] Let's sing. Let go and let God have his
[1:42:57] way.
[1:43:04] Let go and let God have his wonderful
[1:43:11] way.
[1:43:13] Let go and let God have his way.
[1:43:21] Your sorrows will vanish. Your night
[1:43:27] turn to day.
[1:43:30] Let go and let God have his way.
[1:43:38] Let go.
[1:43:50] And you
[1:43:56] will
[1:44:05] have his way. One more time.
[1:44:10] Let go and let God have his wonderful
[1:44:16] way.
[1:44:18] Let go and let God have his way.
[1:44:26] Your sorrows will vanish. Your night
[1:44:31] turn day. Let go and let God have his
[1:44:38] way.
[1:44:42] Amen. Let's sing in the presence of
[1:44:45] Jehovah. Now, I want I I know we can we
[1:44:47] usually think about that right now,
[1:44:50] right in the church when we're singing
[1:44:52] it, but I want us to stretch out a
[1:44:54] little bit. Next time you're going
[1:44:55] through a a trial, I want you to think
[1:44:58] about
[1:44:59] getting in the presence of God,
[1:45:01] believing that he's there. He's making a
[1:45:03] way. Because in the presence of Jehovah,
[1:45:07] troubles vanish. Amen. Hearts are
[1:45:10] mended. Amen.
[1:45:12] in the presence
[1:45:18] of Jehovah
[1:45:24] God Almighty.
[1:45:29] Prince of peace,
[1:45:35] trles,
[1:45:40] hearts are mened
[1:45:46] in the presence
[1:45:51] of the king.
[1:45:57] In the presence
[1:46:02] of Jehovah,
[1:46:08] God Almighty,
[1:46:13] Prince of Peace,
[1:46:18] trles vanish,
[1:46:24] hearts are mened.
[1:46:29] in the
