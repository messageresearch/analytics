[38:29] that covered us we all can relate to
[38:32] this subject amen amen Jesus defines the
[38:36] love of the father in John 15:13 he says
[38:39] Greater Love have no man than this than
[38:42] a man laid down his life for his friends

[38:48] question to you how many loved That Man
[38:50] From Galilee amen he laid down his life
[38:54] for us amen amen and and and this this
[38:58] love the father uh expresses this love
[39:03] in John 3:16 for God so loved the world
[39:07] that he gave his only begotten son that
[39:10] whosoever believeth in him should not
[39:13] perish but have everlasting life amen
[39:17] this was the love that covered us amen
[39:21] for God so loved us that he covered us
[39:24] he went and gave his blood that we
[39:27] wouldn't have to am I was a sin I was a
[39:31] sinner amen and I was in a I mean I sin
[39:36] but I was in a very sinful
[39:39] State before I heard him call
[39:43] me I was in the world and I loved the
[39:49] world I smoked I dranked I partied I
[39:53] tailgated I had long hair and pink belt
[39:57] bottoms I was into every type of music
[40:00] and I was a concert
[40:02] entrepreneur if there was a concert I
[40:05] would go to it and I would travel long
[40:07] distances I was a
[40:10] gambler I played cards for Big
[40:14] Money big
[40:16] money I used to run the Poo tables and
[40:19] bars and I I don't know if I still do
[40:22] but I used to have
[40:24] trophies because I would win tournaments
[40:26] and
[40:27] bars I was bad and I've told you before
[40:30] I tore down buildings that other people
[40:32] were trying to
[40:33] build I just didn't like the building
[40:35] being
[40:37] there I sold
[40:42] drugs I I grew marijuana right right in
[40:45] my own home hoping nobody would see
[40:48] it go
[40:52] figure those were bad things
[40:57] but there was something much worse than
[41:00] that amen it was what was inside of
[41:05] me I had a selfish
[41:08] nature life was all about myself amen I
[41:13] would do whatever I had to do to get
[41:15] what I wanted I basically lived for
[41:19] myself I was self-centered I never woke
[41:22] up and said Lord what would you have me
[41:24] to do
[41:25] today Lord lay some soul on my heart I
[41:28] never did that I could not care about
[41:31] that I only cared about me and when I
[41:34] didn't get what I wanted I got angry
[41:37] amen I just want to know is there
[41:39] anybody in this building today that can
[41:42] relate to
[41:43] this the scriptures defined me I was a
[41:47] sinner that lived in the lust of My
[41:50] Flesh fulfilling the desires of the
[41:52] Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature
[41:55] a child of Wrath even as
[42:00] others I was dead in trespasses and sins
[42:04] and I walked according to the course of
[42:06] this world and whenever I thought about
[42:09] God that there was a god there and I was
[42:11] going to have to answer to these my
[42:15] life I knew that I didn't know
[42:18] them I was an alien from God I didn't
[42:22] have any hope I was without God in this
[42:25] world
[42:27] amen but God who is rich in Mercy for
[42:30] his great love wherewith he loved us
[42:33] even when we were dead in sins he
[42:36] quickened us together with Christ right
[42:39] for by grace are you saved through faith
[42:42] and that not of yourselves it is the
[42:43] gift of God not of Works lest any man
[42:47] should boast I'll say God loved the
[42:51] unlovable amen he loved the
[42:54] unmerciful he loved the unbearable he
[42:57] loved the selfish he loved the sinner
[43:01] right there was no good thing in me I
[43:04] was a good for
[43:08] nothing but God Who Loved Me was rich in
[43:13] Mercy amen and God's love covered a
[43:16] multitude of sin in my life
[43:19] amen but even today God's love is just
[43:23] as powerful to cover the sin in my life
[43:27] amenes we just keep repenting we keep
[43:30] surrendering ourselves to God the Bible
[43:33] tells us if we confess our sins he is
[43:36] faithful and just to forgive us of our
[43:38] sins amen and to cleanse us from all
[43:41] unrighteousness am just confess
[43:45] him be honest with God
[43:49] Amen Romans 8 tells us blessed is the
[43:53] man to whom the Lord will not impute
[43:56] sin amen that word impute means to take
[44:00] inventory or to count them or to write
[44:04] them down blessed is the man in whom the
[44:07] Lord will not count his sins will not
[44:10] write them down will not take inventory
[44:13] and say you know you're going to have
[44:15] this amen we are a blessed people amen
[44:19] blessed are they whose iniquities are
[44:21] forgiven and whose sins are covered
[44:26] amen Romans 4:7 if you want to write it
[44:29] down blessed are those whose iniquities
[44:31] are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[44:35] am amen only God can cover our sins
[44:38] amen God's love covered a multitude of
[44:42] sins amen his love was so great that he
[44:45] wounded oursel for our
[44:47] transgressions it pleased the Lord to
[44:51] bruise Jesus for our
[44:54] iniquities
[44:56] he did it to cover
[45:00] us How
[45:02] [Music]
[45:03] Great Is Our God
[45:07] Amen How
[45:09] Great Is Our God and all will see how
[45:14] great How Great Is Our God that's right
[45:17] God's love is so powerful that is still
[45:21] covering I'll say this a multitude of
[45:24] sin in my life amen amen his mercies are
[45:27] new every morning and if they weren't I
[45:29] would be in trouble we would be in
[45:31] trouble amen look at the strength of
[45:34] God's
[45:36] love it Bears all
[45:39] things it believes all things it hopes
[45:41] all things and it endures all things and
[45:44] if God's love wasn't like that we would
[45:46] not be sitting here today amen Jesus if
[45:49] he just said I'm going to save you but
[45:52] you know you better not make any
[45:54] mistakes we would be in trouble today
[45:57] today 1 John 2:1 I want this one to be
[46:01] on the board 1 John chap 2:1 my little
[46:04] children these things write I unto you
[46:08] that you sin not there's the message
[46:10] that you sin
[46:12] not and if any man sin praise God that's
[46:17] right we have an advocate with the
[46:18] father Jesus Christ the
[46:21] righteous we have an advocate now that
[46:23] word advocate means in intercessor a
[46:27] counselor or a comforter so when we go
[46:30] to do something wrong when we sin we
[46:34] have a comforter in Jesus Christ we have
[46:36] a counselor that can help us and we have
[46:39] someone that will intercede for us in
[46:41] our
[46:42] behalf and he is the
[46:45] propitiation for our sins and not for
[46:49] ours
[46:50] only but also for the sins of the whole
[46:52] world Amen that word propitiation means
[46:56] atonement for
[46:58] wrong for any kind of injury anything
[47:02] that we do it's the making amends for a
[47:05] wrong that we have done he is the
[47:08] propitiation for when we do wrong yes
[47:11] now God wants to cover
[47:14] us every
[47:16] day he does not want us to go one day
[47:20] without that covering
[47:23] amen God's love is still among us and
[47:27] we're still being covered by his love
[47:29] amen how many got the love of God in
[47:31] your hearts amen amen his love will
[47:35] still cover a multitude of sin in our
[47:37] life right now there's no sin that God
[47:42] won't
[47:44] cover there's no sin that God won't
[47:47] cover the Bible tells me
[47:49] outside a
[47:52] blasphemy is that right amen so has
[47:56] anybody blasphemed the holy
[47:58] ghost that means we can be covered by
[48:02] his love amen no matter what we've done
[48:06] no matter what the past has been we can
[48:09] be
[48:11] covered just because he loves us
[48:14] amen God's agape love is still covering
[48:18] us and when his love abides in us it
[48:23] will literally do the same thing it does
[48:27] when it wasn't in
[48:28] us can you say Amen to that amen just
[48:32] before Jesus gives his life to be
[48:34] crucified during the Last Supper he says
[48:36] in St John chap
[48:38] 13:34 a new commandment I give you that
[48:42] you love one another as I have loved you
[48:46] that you also love one another amen now
[48:51] notice the Commandment is nothing less
[48:53] than what he did
[48:56] he didn't say try to love like I love
[48:58] when you can it was a commandment you
[49:01] got to love not just the way you want to
[49:04] the way you think but exactly the way I
[49:07] Loved You amen and if he covers Us that
[49:12] love through us will cover one another
[49:14] right and by this shall all men know
[49:17] that you are my disciples if you have
[49:20] love one for another so God knows it's
[49:23] no longer saying well God knows my heart
[49:26] hey look everybody's going to
[49:29] know everybody's going to know when you
[49:32] love the way God loves John
[49:36] 15:9 as the father have loved me so I
[49:41] have loved you now continue in Not Your
[49:47] Love continue in my
[49:49] love we have to continue to Manifest
[49:52] this love the same way that Christ did
[49:56] so how did Christ do it well just think
[49:58] about that woman at the well she had
[50:00] five
[50:01] husbands didn't beat her
[50:05] up but his love
[50:09] covered think about it look at the woman
[50:12] caught in
[50:14] adultery look at Zacharias what about
[50:17] the disciples when they were just acting
[50:19] who is the greatest one what about when
[50:21] the disciples wanted to call down fire
[50:23] from heaven amen I mean
[50:26] love covers and we've got to be able to
[50:29] love just like he loved amen not make
[50:32] stipulations of why we can or what we
[50:34] can't we just need to get the love of
[50:36] God shut up in our heart by the Holy
[50:39] Ghost verse 10 if you keep my
[50:41] Commandments you shall abide in my love
[50:44] even as I have kept my father's
[50:46] Commandments and abide in his love see
[50:49] the key word here is abide not in and
[50:52] out not up and down not trying when it's
[50:56] convenient not with respect to
[50:58] persons just abide in the love
[51:03] amen okay imagine for a moment
[51:08] now well I'll just tell you something
[51:10] that happened to me when I when we were
[51:12] building this building at trusted
[51:15] tool and uh we had just painted the
[51:18] floor and it was a it was an epoxy and
[51:22] and and when you if you paint a big
[51:27] 5,000 sare foot floor and you walk in
[51:29] there I mean you're going to get
[51:33] dizzy and we were in there working on
[51:35] the
[51:36] electrical and I'm telling you we were
[51:38] just sitting against the wall three of
[51:40] us and we were just laughing our head
[51:42] off because we just we didn't realize
[51:45] what would happened but we
[51:48] just we got
[51:50] intoxicated the point that I'm saying is
[51:53] when the atmosphere was what it was was
[51:55] there was no respect to persons it
[51:57] wasn't just two out of three that got it
[51:59] and when you're abiding in God's love
[52:01] there's no respect to persons the
[52:04] atmosphere just gets
[52:07] everybody these things have I spoken
[52:10] unto you that my joy might remain in
[52:14] you and that your joy might be full amen
[52:18] the very purpose that God has given us
[52:20] this commandment is so that our joy
[52:23] would remain inside of us
[52:27] amen that we might be full of joy well
[52:30] he's the only one that can give joy amen
[52:33] the joy of the Lord is our strength we
[52:35] need it and if we don't abide in his
[52:38] love we're not getting the joy
[52:40] either come on let's say Amen because
[52:42] this is the word
[52:44] we this com this is my commandment that
[52:47] you love one another as I have loved you
[52:51] there it is again Greater Love have no
[52:55] man than this and a man lay down his
[52:56] life for his friends and you are my
[52:58] friend if you do whatsoever I commanded
[53:01] you and what has he commanded us to do
[53:03] to love one
[53:04] another just love one another it's why
[53:07] is it so hard because humanly understand
[53:10] when I was in the world before I came to
[53:12] Christ I had people that I loved sure he
[53:15] did people in the world they have people
[53:17] who who they they love one another even
[53:20] Jesus said if you just love those who
[53:22] love you right that's nothing
[53:28] amen there's no joy the Lord in the
[53:32] world there's a temporary
[53:35] fix but it ain't
[53:38] joy we can have joy when we don't have
[53:42] any money the Bottom's falling out but
[53:44] one thing that we do have is the love of
[53:46] God in our
[53:49] heart it covers
[53:52] Us when Christ laid down his life for us
[53:56] he was covering our sin amen and Christ
[54:00] inside of us
[54:02] today will cause us to lay down our life
[54:05] for one another and cover one
[54:08] another now I'll tell you you didn't
[54:11] like that message you're not going to
[54:12] like the rest of the
[54:14] tape 1 John 3:16 Says hereby perceive we
[54:18] the love of God let's define it now what
[54:21] does it mean to love one another like I
[54:25] have loved
[54:27] you John 3:16 hereby perceive we the
[54:30] love of God because he laid down his
[54:32] life for us we ought to lay down our
[54:35] lives for for the Brethren that's right
[54:38] amen lay it down amen what does that
[54:41] mean to you when is the last time you
[54:43] lay down your life and how many times do
[54:46] you lay down your
[54:48] life think about that
[54:52] statement the love of God is still
[54:55] covering a multitude of
[54:58] sin and it's being manifested in the
[55:00] Bride of Jesus Christ today I believe
[55:02] that just like it did when it was in
[55:06] Christ in the bride they're taking the
[55:09] word seriously yes they're taking this
[55:12] word that says this is my commandment
[55:14] that you love one another as I have
[55:17] loved you and God's love covered us amen
[55:21] and that same love inside of us is going
[55:23] to cover one another amen that's the
[55:26] realness of God being in a person
[55:29] amen you know so the whole church World
[55:32] wants to say God's with
[55:34] me but where is the
[55:38] manifestation it's got It's not good
[55:40] enough just to say that we we love
[55:42] people it's not good enough to to love
[55:44] people with human love human love is
[55:46] with respect to persons you know one
[55:49] minute you can love your spouse and the
[55:51] next minute you don't even want to be
[55:52] with
[55:54] them
[55:55] I don't know why it's quiet we should be
[55:57] about to say Amen to the
[56:00] truth and it don't have to be a spouse
[56:02] it could be one of our brothers and
[56:04] sisters it could be a a a
[56:07] coworker our love is only as strong as
[56:12] to cover our
[56:13] sins our love wants our sins
[56:17] covered God's love wants to cover one
[56:20] another's sins amen and even though you
[56:23] don't want to do it because you're so
[56:25] bothered the spirit inside of you it
[56:29] wants to do it
[56:31] amen that's why we need to be filled
[56:33] with God's love it's without respect to
[56:36] persons now the scriptures are
[56:39] interwoven with how the love of God
[56:42] inside of us covers the sins of one
[56:45] another it's interwoven and I just want
[56:47] to go through some of them let's take a
[56:49] look at Matthew chapter
[56:51] 6 Jesus here in Matthew chapter 6 he's
[56:54] teaching teaching us how or teaching the
[56:56] disciples I'll say teaching us teaching
[56:58] me how to pray and in verse 12 he says
[57:01] and forgive us of our
[57:05] debts as we forgive our debtors right so
[57:11] don't ask God to forgive you of your
[57:13] debt if you're not caring
[57:20] about forgiving others so this is you
[57:23] know this is now God God wants to put
[57:27] you and your
[57:29] brother in the prayer where maybe you
[57:32] just want to leave everybody out you
[57:33] just want to pray this God this between
[57:34] me and you I need your help and God I
[57:36] need you to forgive me I need you in
[57:38] this
[57:39] situation but God says
[57:41] no no bring your brother bring your
[57:44] sister in this and lead us not to
[57:46] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[57:49] thine is the kingom the power and the
[57:50] glory forever and ever amen amen amen
[57:55] amen so be it that's a conclusion and
[57:57] then he gives us a stipulation for
[58:00] forgiveness for if you forgive men their
[58:04] trespasses your heavenly father will
[58:06] also forgive
[58:09] you and then gives us an ultimate
[58:12] warning but if you forgive not
[58:16] men their
[58:18] trespasses neither will your father
[58:21] forgive you your
[58:23] trespasses
[58:26] in other words if we do not cover other
[58:29] men's
[58:30] trespasses then God is not going to
[58:32] continue to cover ours
[58:35] amen we can start the race right but
[58:37] you're going to have a chance to love
[58:39] like he loves to cover like he covers
[58:42] amen and if you don't walk in that then
[58:45] God just says you know what I'm not
[58:47] going to continue to forgive you of
[58:49] yours you believe
[58:51] that that's that's that's the word amen
[58:55] I know it's a hard pill to swallow but
[58:58] this is the character of the Bride
[59:00] Matthew 18: 211 Matthew 18: 211 then
[59:04] came Peter to him and said Lord how
[59:07] often shall my brother sin against me
[59:11] and I forgive
[59:14] him now let's not get carried away till
[59:17] seven times that's an extreme
[59:20] amount Peter was hoping to only have to
[59:24] Express a portion of God's Divine love
[59:27] just a
[59:30] portion but
[59:32] notice God's love bears all things right
[59:36] it endures all things there's no seven
[59:39] time limit with God Amen and Jesus said
[59:42] unto him I say not unto thee until seven
[59:46] times don't get that into your head that
[59:49] came from the
[59:50] devil but until 70 times Heaven amen we
[59:56] got to get our perspective right of what
[59:58] it means to love one another amen it
[1:00:01] really means to lay down our life for
[1:00:03] one
[1:00:06] another I don't want to just cover my
[1:00:09] brother seven
[1:00:11] times and say well look at I feel pretty
[1:00:14] good because you know out in the world I
[1:00:17] wouldn't even done
[1:00:19] it what does that matter if the word
[1:00:21] tells me to keep covering
[1:00:25] because look I keep sinning against God
[1:00:29] I keep falling against God I keep
[1:00:32] needing to have to ask for Mercy I keep
[1:00:34] having to say God I'm sorry for those
[1:00:37] thoughts
[1:00:39] amen who am I to say no I'm not going to
[1:00:42] forgive this brother I'm not going to
[1:00:43] forgive this sister no enough's enough
[1:00:46] I've had it what are you doing you're
[1:00:48] not expressing the Christ amen you're
[1:00:51] not expressing the love of God that
[1:00:53] covers it's a different love and we've
[1:00:56] got to recognize it we've got to come
[1:00:58] into the love of God we've got to make
[1:01:00] sure that we are so full of the love of
[1:01:03] God brother Ben says make sure you get
[1:01:05] to the place where you get perfect
[1:01:08] love lay everything aside
[1:01:11] amen you're not born with it you're not
[1:01:15] born with it all you got to do is be
[1:01:16] honest with your
[1:01:18] thoughts you'll see be honest with your
[1:01:21] thoughts check your thoughts and you'll
[1:01:23] see
[1:01:25] think about Jesus hanging there on the
[1:01:26] cross just saying father forgive them
[1:01:29] they don't know what they're
[1:01:31] doing well you know to me if somebody
[1:01:34] was pulling my beard pulling Jonathan's
[1:01:39] beard putting a a a crown and and
[1:01:43] whipping me and blindfolding me and and
[1:01:45] and taunting me and and and making fun
[1:01:48] of
[1:01:50] me and I'm going to say they don't even
[1:01:53] know what they're doing
[1:01:55] I would be so
[1:01:57] enraged am you know what you're doing
[1:02:00] you shouldn't be doing this to me but he
[1:02:02] could see beyond the natural into a
[1:02:07] spiritual realm amen that knew they were
[1:02:10] deceived and they really thought what
[1:02:12] they were doing was the right thing the
[1:02:15] Bible says there will come a day amen
[1:02:17] when they'll kill you thinking they're
[1:02:18] doing me a
[1:02:23] service
[1:02:25] you know some people won't forgive other
[1:02:27] people because they think they know
[1:02:33] better where's that
[1:02:36] scripture where's that
[1:02:39] scripture Luke 17 how many's enjoying
[1:02:42] this messag amen all right all right all
[1:02:44] right you got to let me know amen Luke
[1:02:47] 173 says take heed to
[1:02:50] yourself okay this is take heed to
[1:02:53] yourself if th thy brother trespass
[1:02:55] against thee rebuke
[1:02:57] him and if he repents you have a job to
[1:03:01] do forgive
[1:03:03] them and if he trespass against thee
[1:03:06] seven times in a day and seven times in
[1:03:11] a day he turns again to you saying I'm
[1:03:17] sorry
[1:03:18] thou shall
[1:03:21] forgive him amen now you can't do that
[1:03:25] in your flesh amen it takes the Holy
[1:03:29] Ghost to do that now if you're saying
[1:03:32] well I I just can't do that well you
[1:03:34] know something good that you've identif
[1:03:36] identified the first need now the second
[1:03:40] is get more of God Amen because he's not
[1:03:43] going to tell us to do something if we
[1:03:45] can't do it
[1:03:48] right it's good that we realize we can't
[1:03:50] do it on oursel but it's wrong that we
[1:03:52] don't humble ourselves and say God h
[1:03:54] need more of your love to make
[1:03:56] it Jesus continues here to speak in MA
[1:04:01] Matthew chapter
[1:04:03] 18 verse 23 Matthew 18:23 if you're
[1:04:05] writing it
[1:04:06] down he continues here to speak of a
[1:04:10] servant who wants forgiveness we all
[1:04:12] want forgiveness but he refuses to give
[1:04:15] it he says therefore the Kingdom of
[1:04:18] Heaven is liken unto a certain King
[1:04:21] which would take account of his servants
[1:04:25] and when he had begun to reckon one was
[1:04:28] brought to him which owed
[1:04:31] him
[1:04:33] 10,000
[1:04:35] talents I think we went through this
[1:04:38] before and
[1:04:40] 10,000 talents is equivalent to 200,000
[1:04:45] years of Labor not one year not one
[1:04:49] month not one lifetime not two
[1:04:52] lifetimes 200 ,000 that's a big
[1:04:57] bill today it's about
[1:04:59] 3.40 uh it's all about three and a half
[1:05:02] billion dollars that's the bill that he
[1:05:06] owed that's the debt he owed now this is
[1:05:08] of course
[1:05:10] representing our Salvation amen what
[1:05:13] it's really representing here for as
[1:05:15] much as he had for as much as he had not
[1:05:18] to pay his Lord commanded him to be sold
[1:05:22] and his wife and his children and all
[1:05:25] that he had and payment to be
[1:05:29] made the servant therefore fou down and
[1:05:33] worshiped him saying
[1:05:36] Lord have patience with me and I will
[1:05:40] pay thee all impossible to pay it all
[1:05:43] but notice his attitude Lord have mercy
[1:05:48] on me have patience with me then the
[1:05:51] Lord of that servant was moved with
[1:05:55] compassion amen what turned the thing
[1:06:00] around he still owed the bill but it was
[1:06:03] his attitude that turned it
[1:06:06] around so he losed him and he forgave
[1:06:10] him the
[1:06:12] debt this servant was broken he owed a
[1:06:17] debt he couldn't pay right but he met
[1:06:20] the Lord's requirement now what is the
[1:06:22] Lord's
[1:06:23] requirement
[1:06:25] the sacrifices of God are a broken
[1:06:27] Spirit A broken contrite heart oh God
[1:06:32] thou will not
[1:06:34] despise amen this man was broken the
[1:06:38] Bible tells us in Psalms 34 that the
[1:06:40] Lord is is nigh unto them of a broken
[1:06:42] heart and saveth such as be of a
[1:06:46] contrite spirit amen this man he became
[1:06:51] broken and he realized that he could not
[1:06:53] make make it without the grace of God
[1:06:56] Amen and so he presented this sacrifice
[1:07:00] Lord have patience with me and I will
[1:07:03] work my life to pay everything that I
[1:07:07] can he didn't say Lord have mercy on me
[1:07:10] and just go walk his way live any kind
[1:07:12] of life he wanted his in he felt in
[1:07:16] debted I'm going to pay amen with my
[1:07:20] life verse
[1:07:22] 28 but the same same servant who was
[1:07:25] just
[1:07:26] forgiven went out and found one of his
[1:07:29] fellow servants which owed him a 100
[1:07:34] Pence that's only about a 100 days labor
[1:07:38] lot different than 200,000
[1:07:41] years a lot
[1:07:43] less and he laid hands on him and he
[1:07:46] took him by the throat which that didn't
[1:07:49] happen to him but took him to the by the
[1:07:51] throat and said pay me what what you
[1:07:55] OST and his fellow servant fell down at
[1:07:59] his feet and besought him saying same
[1:08:03] thing same thing he said have patience
[1:08:06] with me and I will pay thee all
[1:08:10] amen same broken contrite
[1:08:16] spirit verse 30 and he would
[1:08:19] not but went and cast him into prison
[1:08:22] till he should pay his
[1:08:27] debt wow what do you think of
[1:08:30] this this was a
[1:08:34] two-faced a believer that was
[1:08:37] two-faced he had a broken and contrite
[1:08:40] spirit towards God and an unmerciful
[1:08:42] Spirit towards others amen twoof
[1:08:46] face the servant wanted to be covered
[1:08:48] for his debt but he was unwilling to
[1:08:51] cover somebody else's debt which was
[1:08:53] much much much less and I'll tell you
[1:08:56] when you compare your salvation with
[1:08:58] anything that's ever been done against
[1:09:00] you you cannot compare it
[1:09:05] amen so when his fellow servant saw his
[1:09:09] fellow servants
[1:09:10] saw what was done they look at this they
[1:09:14] were very sorry in other words they knew
[1:09:16] this is wrong when you see somebody
[1:09:19] that's unwilling to forgive or help
[1:09:21] somebody you know that spirit's wrong
[1:09:24] amen you just do right they were very
[1:09:26] sorry and they came and they told their
[1:09:29] lord all that was done amen now then his
[1:09:33] Lord after he had called him he said
[1:09:36] unto him look at the first thing first
[1:09:38] he had a broken contrite spirit he got
[1:09:41] into the presence of God he he got a
[1:09:44] gift of of forgiveness from God but now
[1:09:47] because of his attitude that he had
[1:09:48] towards another human being he said oh
[1:09:51] thou Wicked servant amen
[1:09:54] I forgave thee all that
[1:09:57] debt because you desired me
[1:10:01] to now because I forgave you should us
[1:10:05] not thou also had compassion on your
[1:10:09] fellow servant
[1:10:12] even as I had pity on
[1:10:17] you we've got to love one another as God
[1:10:20] loves us and here's this inner scripture
[1:10:24] that's interwoven that's teaching
[1:10:27] us that God has an
[1:10:30] expectation he had a choice to make he
[1:10:33] could choose to forgive and he could
[1:10:35] choose to hold a grudge he could choose
[1:10:38] to forgive he could choose to hold it
[1:10:40] against him you pay
[1:10:43] me throw you in prison a lot of times we
[1:10:46] throw people
[1:10:47] out amen out of our Circle brother man s
[1:10:49] draw a bigger Circle draw them
[1:10:52] in God gave this man a
[1:10:57] choice and his Lord was wrought and
[1:10:59] delivered him to the tormenters till he
[1:11:01] should pay all that was due
[1:11:04] him right here is a man that one time
[1:11:07] had a broken and contrite
[1:11:10] spirit and God forgave him he was going
[1:11:13] to heaven just as pure as
[1:11:16] anything because he came with a right
[1:11:20] Spirit a right attitude and he said I
[1:11:23] will pay all that I owe Thee I will pay
[1:11:26] thee with my life I will give you my
[1:11:29] life and I will serve
[1:11:32] you then somebody else owed him
[1:11:37] something and instead of being
[1:11:41] remembering God forgave
[1:11:44] me I should not forgive those who
[1:11:47] trespass
[1:11:52] against he
[1:11:55] had developed acquired a different
[1:11:59] Spirit it wasn't a broken contrite
[1:12:00] anymore it was no more humble it was
[1:12:04] proud I've been forgiven I'm a
[1:12:06] Christian I got favor with
[1:12:10] God I'm
[1:12:13] special you're special without the love
[1:12:16] of God we ain't going to get you
[1:12:17] anywhere it's going to bring us down
[1:12:21] amen unforgiveness is an offense against
[1:12:24] God God doesn't want fellowship with
[1:12:28] somebody that he has forgiven he wants
[1:12:30] fellowship with somebody who has
[1:12:32] forgiven others right that's kind after
[1:12:37] his kind seed after his seed
[1:12:41] right he wants fellowship with someone
[1:12:44] that's loves just like he loves amen
[1:12:48] it's it's not
[1:12:50] just a do and don't commandment he's
[1:12:53] expressing his heart now of course it's
[1:12:55] our choice we don't have to forgive we
[1:12:58] can hold
[1:12:59] grudges we can just say I you know I
[1:13:02] can't do it and forget it or we can take
[1:13:05] time to say God I know what I need I
[1:13:07] need you in
[1:13:09] here this will make the difference God
[1:13:12] in here will make the difference
[1:13:15] amen so likewise verse 35 so likewise
[1:13:19] shall my heavenly father look at Jesus
[1:13:23] is saying so likewise shall my heavenly
[1:13:26] father do also unto
[1:13:29] you if you from your heart forgive not
[1:13:35] everyone his brother their trespasses
[1:13:38] amen God really expects us to cover a
[1:13:42] multitude of sin amen you know sometimes
[1:13:45] we got to blabber it sometimes we got to
[1:13:48] talk about
[1:13:50] it sometimes we got to just you know
[1:13:57] because we can't seem to Bear
[1:14:02] it look the word tells me that God would
[1:14:05] not put anything on me that I couldn't
[1:14:06] bear
[1:14:08] amen and his love bears all things
[1:14:11] that's right amen I would that none of
[1:14:14] us would have to suffer that is the
[1:14:15] God's truth and I feel so bad for those
[1:14:18] that I have have to suffer because of me
[1:14:21] that is the truth but the bottom line is
[1:14:25] we all got to come to grips with having
[1:14:27] the love of God in our heart am we've
[1:14:30] all got a face that I've got to got to
[1:14:32] get more filled with so filled with God
[1:14:35] that at any time that somebody ask for
[1:14:37] forgiveness I can forgive them
[1:14:41] amen and I can mean it from my
[1:14:45] heart brother Ram says lay everything
[1:14:48] aside until you get to the place where
[1:14:51] you can even love your enemy and I'll
[1:14:54] tell you your enemy is your enemy right
[1:14:57] your enemy is not H it's kind of my
[1:15:00] brother kind of my no it's your enemy

[1:15:37] huh I
[1:15:40] I I was catching that
[1:15:43] feeling all right first Peter 4:7 but
[1:15:47] the end of all things is at
[1:15:50] hand be ye therefore sober and and watch
[1:15:54] unto prayer amen and above all things

[1:16:02] yourselves for charity shall cover the
[1:16:06] multitude of sins
[1:16:08] amen we need it amongst
[1:16:11] us you know we we get hurt we get
[1:16:15] offended and we get bothered and we
[1:16:17] think we got some right to go home
[1:16:20] bothered about something all that's do
[1:16:23] is telling everybody that you need more
[1:16:25] love amen
[1:16:28] really I understand it's not right
[1:16:31] offenses are going to come I know
[1:16:35] that hey look greater Is God that's in
[1:16:39] you and this offense that's coming from
[1:16:42] somebody else amen we believe in a God
[1:16:45] that's able to keep us to make us handle
[1:16:50] things I got a few quotes I wanted us
[1:16:53] I I wanted me to read for
[1:16:57] us the seven Church agents brother BR
[1:16:59] says I tell you that's a very good thing
[1:17:02] to preach on little children love one
[1:17:04] another as I get
[1:17:07] old in the ministry now and my about in
[1:17:13] my 21st year I think all the time as I
[1:17:18] go along the more that I think of the
[1:17:22] Lord Jesus the more that I think of the
[1:17:25] Lord Jesus the more I begin to find that
[1:17:30] it's love that covers the whole thing
[1:17:34] amen he and he quotes the scripture the
[1:17:37] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[1:17:39] by the Holy Ghost taking sides with
[1:17:41] Jesus he says and now and you know love
[1:17:44] is
[1:17:45] blind about all about about to those
[1:17:50] those things around us he said love
[1:17:53] covers up a multitude of sin you know
[1:17:56] perfect love cast out fear cast out sin
[1:18:00] cast out Discord what does it he says
[1:18:02] love does it amen we've got to exercise
[1:18:07] that amen we've got to speak it we got
[1:18:09] to believe
[1:18:10] it don't wait till you feel it
[1:18:15] feeling I tell you
[1:18:21] feeling
[1:18:24] feelings are not always
[1:18:27] right like the Bible says or two or
[1:18:30] three are gathered together in my name I
[1:18:32] will be there in the midst we don't got
[1:18:34] to feel that we just got to believe
[1:18:37] that the love of God don't always feel
[1:18:40] like saying I'm sorry or I forgive you
[1:18:43] it
[1:18:44] doesn't we're not always going to have
[1:18:46] that
[1:18:48] feeling but we got to do it and mean it
[1:18:50] from our heart amen it's it's a
[1:18:53] different than our our human
[1:18:55] feelings brother brandom said in the
[1:18:58] message of Satan zeden do you love one
[1:19:00] another John said little children love
[1:19:03] one another love one another for love
[1:19:06] covers a multitude of
[1:19:10] sin the message power of transformation
[1:19:13] transformation brother B says I think
[1:19:15] there is nothing greater than love and
[1:19:18] love if we can express it now if we can
[1:19:22] say we have love we're just saying that
[1:19:26] but when we can express it what we've
[1:19:30] said that we have then then we show it
[1:19:34] in ourselves and to
[1:19:36] me this is that love that Jesus was
[1:19:39] saying that all men shall know you're my
[1:19:40] disciples you have love one for when you
[1:19:42] can love like I can love you basically
[1:19:45] have the power to not just say I forgive
[1:19:47] you but from your heart you have just
[1:19:52] cut out any anything that would bring
[1:19:54] dissimulation or separation or Discord
[1:19:57] you just got rid of it you you draw a
[1:19:59] bigger Circle and you include them in
[1:20:02] that's what it means to express the love
[1:20:04] of
[1:20:05] God now we're not a perfect people
[1:20:08] brother bar said he says we make our
[1:20:13] mistakes we do things that's wrong but
[1:20:16] you see love covers all that right he
[1:20:21] says we're willing when we see our
[1:20:24] mistakes to come back and apologize to
[1:20:27] one
[1:20:28] another he says yeah that's
[1:20:31] Warriors that's really men and women
[1:20:34] that are Gallant yes any man will go out
[1:20:37] to the battlefield that's got any nerve
[1:20:40] can walk out there but when he gets
[1:20:43] knocked down and then he gets up and
[1:20:45] tries it again
[1:20:47] see hey we're all trying to be a
[1:20:49] Christian here that's what it means to
[1:20:50] get on the battlefield we give our very
[1:20:54] best to love one another and treat one
[1:20:56] another right and sometimes we're in our
[1:20:58] flesh and we do things we say things
[1:21:00] that we
[1:21:01] shouldn't it's a
[1:21:04] truth if you're a real Gallant Soldier

[1:21:10] love you I'm going to try it again and I

[1:23:54] children let us not love in word neither
[1:23:58] in tongue but
[1:24:01] indeed and in truth amen praise the Lord
[1:24:06] amen you I got just I do got a little
[1:24:08] bit more time I I can I use it amen amen
[1:24:14] amen Luke chapter 7 let's turn
[1:24:16] there Luke Chapter
[1:24:21] 7
[1:24:24] it's
[1:24:25] easy let's say this for a
[1:24:28] second
[1:24:33] um sometimes it's easier to forgive
[1:24:36] verse 36 we're going to start with it
[1:24:38] sometimes it's easy to forgive somebody
[1:24:40] isn't
[1:24:41] it okay say you're you're walking you're
[1:24:44] walking out of the church you you bump
[1:24:47] them a little bit you oh I'm sorry oh
[1:24:51] it's nothing forgive
[1:24:54] you don't need much love to to to
[1:24:55] forgive
[1:24:57] somebody
[1:24:58] but someone really says something bad
[1:25:01] about you and you find out about
[1:25:06] it it's no longer a little bump in the
[1:25:08] elbow and walking out the
[1:25:10] door you need a greater love to forgive
[1:25:13] that amen so look we all have the love
[1:25:17] of God but the key is do we have enough
[1:25:19] love to fulfill the scripture and love
[1:25:21] one another the way Christ loved us
[1:25:24] that's what we're after all right start
[1:25:26] here with verse number
[1:25:30] 36 and one of the Pharisees desired him
[1:25:33] that he would eat with him and he went
[1:25:37] to the Pharisees house and sat down to
[1:25:39] meet and behold a woman in the city
[1:25:43] which was a sinner when she knew that
[1:25:46] Jesus sat at meat and the Pharisees
[1:25:48] house brought an albaster box of
[1:25:51] anointment and stood at his feet and be
[1:25:54] behind him weeping began to wash his
[1:25:57] feet with tears and did wipe them with
[1:26:00] the hairs of her head and kissed his
[1:26:02] feet and anointed them with anointment
[1:26:04] and when the Pharisee which had bid him
[1:26:08] saw it he spake within himself this man
[1:26:13] if he were a true Prophet would have
[1:26:16] known who what who and what manner of
[1:26:20] woman this is that toucheth him for she
[1:26:23] is a
[1:26:25] sinner Jesus answering said unto Simon
[1:26:29] said unto him Simon I have something to
[1:26:32] say unto you and he said master master
[1:26:36] say on so so one minute you know
[1:26:41] he's belittling who he really was in his
[1:26:44] heart but outwardly was acting like oh
[1:26:47] you're the master you know just an twoof
[1:26:50] face right amen amen amen let's get
[1:26:54] let's get what we can get out of these
[1:26:55] scriptures verse 41 there was a certain
[1:26:59] creditor which had two debtors the one
[1:27:02] owed 500 p and the other
[1:27:05] 50 and when they had nothing to
[1:27:10] pay he frankly forgave them both he says
[1:27:14] tell me therefore which of the two do
[1:27:18] you think love me the
[1:27:20] most and Simon answered and said well I
[1:27:24] suppose he to
[1:27:26] whom he uh uh to whom he forgave the
[1:27:31] most he to whom he forgave the most and
[1:27:35] he said unto him thou has rightly Judge
[1:27:38] you answered the question too if you
[1:27:41] forgive a lot you're going to love a lot
[1:27:46] amen is that beautiful there's such a
[1:27:48] message in that thing in other words if
[1:27:51] you're a person that don't get much
[1:27:53] forgiveness you know you're probably not
[1:27:56] going to love very
[1:27:58] much I say you know what get forgiven a
[1:28:01] whole
[1:28:03] bunch because you're going to come out
[1:28:05] on top you're going to come out on
[1:28:08] top and he turned to the woman and said
[1:28:12] unto Simon so he's turning to the woman
[1:28:14] and talking to Simon seest thou this
[1:28:16] woman I entered into thine house and
[1:28:19] thou gavest me no water for my feet but
[1:28:21] she is washed my feet with tears and
[1:28:23] wiped them with the hairs of her head
[1:28:25] thou gavest me no kiss but this woman
[1:28:28] since the time I came in have not ceased
[1:28:30] to kiss my feet my head with oil thou
[1:28:34] didst not anoint but this woman have
[1:28:37] anointed my feet with anointment
[1:28:40] wherefore I say unto thee her
[1:28:42] sins which are many are
[1:28:49] forgiven he's sending a message she was
[1:28:52] the one that owed 500 P am for she loved
[1:28:57] much but to whom little Is Forgiven the
[1:29:01] same loveth little he just came out and
[1:29:04] basically rebuked Simon to his
[1:29:08] face you don't have feel like there's
[1:29:11] any debt that's why you don't love this
[1:29:14] woman feels like she owes a big debt to
[1:29:17] God so she's going to love God Amen and
[1:29:20] the key for us
[1:29:22] is to feel more
[1:29:25] indebted that we could have more of the
[1:29:27] love that we could express one to
[1:29:29] another what good is it to have love if
[1:29:32] you can't show it right amen look and
[1:29:36] here I don't care about your past I wish
[1:29:39] we could just take a little thing and
[1:29:41] just
[1:29:41] go the past is gone no thoughts of the
[1:29:47] past today is the day of salvation today
[1:29:50] is the day we express love today is the
[1:29:52] day we feel de today is the day we got a
[1:29:55] new chance to start covering one
[1:29:59] another let the Holy Ghost In You cover
[1:30:02] one another we can't but God inside of
[1:30:05] us can let's Stand Together God bless
