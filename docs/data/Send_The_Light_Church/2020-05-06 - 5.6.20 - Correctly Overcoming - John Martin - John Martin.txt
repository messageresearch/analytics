could just stand together for the reading of the word and change the order of the service amen praise the Lord God is good amen such love where would we be today if God had not loved us he loved us when we didn't even know him we didn't care about him even when he knocked on our door a number of times we turned it down but his prevailing love is the love that never quits never fails it endures all of our turning up our our noses that love such love where would we be today without the love of God amen amen we're just gonna read one verse here in the book of Romans chapter 12 and it's going to be the very last verse verse number 21 amen and the Bible reads be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good I just want to read that one more time be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good amen if you would just bow your heart with me in a word of Prayer father we thank you for your Eternal Word and God as we look upon this it's a scripture that we all face daily because we face evil daily and we want to overcome it and Lord we struggle so many times God you've given us your word here to overcome it with good lord I pray as we look into your scriptures here more scriptures and we take this little thought of overcoming the correct way father I pray that you would open our hearts understanding and you'd be gracious to give us revelation of your precious Word make this word come off the pages of your dear book to become a living life inside of us Lord through the power of the Holy Ghost bless each one Lord that we might be overcomers better overcomers Lord we pray thank you for these things now Lord we ask in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you may be seated well we want to entitle this message correctly overcoming and for a subject overcoming evil and the reason I want entitle it correctly overcoming is a lot of times when we're dealing with problems whether we're dealing with whatever the problem might be weird looking so much for an answer that a lot of times we just wanted do whatever we got to do to not be dealing with it anymore and at that point you know do we put that thing on the Shelf do we do we put it under a rug do we ignore it do we make some excuse and I'm just I wonder sometimes if we think we've overcome but really we haven't done it correctly and the Bible shares with us here Paul be not overcomed of evil but overcome evil with good that means you've got to have the goods to overcome amen well the world that we live in is full of evil I just want to say before we start I miss you all I really wish that you were all here you know close and I know I've said that before but I just wanted to share what was on my heart there but the world that we live in is full of evil hatred is on a rampage Cheryl was just telling me yesterday there was somebody that was on a plane just recently and they were going from obviously one state to another state and there was some carrying on and one person just most turned around and asked if they could just keep it down just a little bit and the people were carrying on they just two guys two people got out of their seat and just beat the tar out of that guy who just asked him if they could just you know quiet it down and he was all bloody and they had actually down the plane before they got to their destination and the world that we live in is full of evil hatred is under on a rampage and there's bullying more and more in schools and racism and human abuse and shootings and schools actually in killings and drug abuse terrorism murder in every sector suicide depression cancer diseases and sicknesses and brother Ram taught us that that cancer is just a devil and and so that just evil all around us in this world and there is an inspiration directly from how to take complete control over humanity in order to destroy it there's so much fighting between political party lines there's so much cover-up there half of it has never been told there was a time News used to be news but now when you hear news you don't probably most the time it's it's fake news or just somebody trying to push their agenda and you really really never know any more people lobby for everything including how to give the game more rights how to be accepted in a way that God would never accept it science fiction is increasing more and more through television but I feel the devil has thrown more money into the movie sector about gay and immoral relationships than anything else trying to promote his propaganda in that way more than anything else what better way for him to get his agenda to spread than through through television where people can can see it and absorb it more in and kind of get used to it know that there's there's no show out there that just the whole thing is gay but what they do is they you watch something and then all sudden they just slip a little something in there and you word in a world of this thing come from and that's what the devil is trying to his Trenor he's slipping in and the world is just becoming more and more evil what better way to bring about as it was in the days of of Noah or in the days of lot Sodom and gomorrah's at were in nineteen twenty Berlin developed into the first gay village in the world and he says what Google tells us today they are number nine on the top ten list of contenders of the gay capital of the world Tel Aviv Israel being number two but there's a whole list of cities that are known for being gay friendly now there's probably a lot of people watching this or could be watching this we get people watching this that aren't really a part of the group but youtubers and they may not agree with it but it's the truth anyways the devil has slowly worked his magic of deception to corrupt in society his brought immortality of this great nation to its lowest ebb that has ever been Satan is making the world a wilderness there things are continually getting worse they're not getting better they're getting worse Isaiah chapter 14 verse 12 listen to this how art thou fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nation's look at that weakened the nation's what is Satan doing now he's weakening the nation's with his immorality and evil that they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying this is this the man that made the earth to tremble and it didn't shake the kingdoms well what have we just gone through hate men what are we just gone through here of late and all the nations just trembling in this the stock markets and so much it's just fear saying that society will never get back to what it was before the devil enjoys tormenting people verse 17 that made the world a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof and open not the house of his prisoners Satan has weakened mortality by giving people by giving people what their flesh wants that's how he weakens the knee that's how he weakens the whole that's how I weakens the family to give them what their flesh months there's absolutely no way to stop the onslaught of evil that's increasing in today's world no way to take control of the world that we're living in there's no way to conquer the corruptness that's so embedded into our government there's no way to subdue the money hungry power thirsty society that we're living him so how do we overcome something that can't be stopped Ezekiel 28 verse 18 it's it's it's crapped into our churches Ezekiel 28 18 this evil tells us that Satan has defiled our sanctuaries by a multitude of thine iniquities think about that we just we talked about iniquity health abounding it's actually corrupted and defiled the sanctuaries how do we prevail over something that's corrupting even our churches in the world church leaders have left Christ the word out of the church and have taken over their own south man has taken over the church men have kicked out conviction out of the church and replaced it with entertainment because they enjoy that so much more 2nd Timothy chapter 4 verse 3 for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers that will give the people what they want to hear they don't want sound doctrine anymore they their flesh is lusting is desiring something that they want and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned to fables what I've learned is most people don't mind hearing the truth about the Gospel as long as they don't have to change but as soon as they requires a change in them well they're not as interested in that type of a gospel they're interested in a truth that that they don't have to change with something that they can agree with but they don't have to change their lifestyle so churchgoers are ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth Tim Paul said to Timothy men have replaced revelation with the tree of knowledge just knowledge taking its place they replaced the power of God with just a form of godliness and they replaced the Holy Ghost with their own ghost second Timothy chapter 3 verse 13 but evil men and evil and seducers that word seducers means juggling imposters so these are people who are imposter or impersonating Christianity but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived it just is it is getting worse the scripture is being fulfilled the whole world and the church world is being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou has learned verse 14 and has been assured of knowing of whom thou has learned them so we're here today to continue to continue learning from the Lord continue growing in the Lord we've taken this this time because we want to continue in the truth we live in a a very evil world and how can we overcome this world this evil in this world with good people seem to to trample over us in and use us we can't even stop them most people most and I don't even say all the time but how many people actually don't care about themselves they only care about helping somebody but Jesus told us this what happened this is the kind of world that we're living in but the question is how do we overcome it we can't overcome the evil that's in the world out there but the evil that we can overcome is the evil that's inside of us and it does no good or does very little good if we can convince somebody in the world that they're wrong about some evil that they're doing it's not going to change the whole sector of the world yeah it'll make it could make a difference for that one in that area but the evil that we need to be concerned about is the evil that lies inside of us Romans chapter 12 verse 21 our opening Scripture be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good the evil that we need to overcome is not our society it's not our government it's not terrorism it's not gay organization or abortion clinics the evil that we need overcome attacks our mind it's the evil that often times gets bottled up inside of us to thoughts until it what Rupp's with a carnal nature lashes out Matthew chapter 15 verse 18 Jesus speaking he says those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart and they defile the man so it's from within for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemies and these are the things which defile man so here we see that evil erupts rape from inside a man did you know the Bible says that our tongue is an unruly member an unruly member is our tongue in its full of deadly poison full of it just ready like - it's almost like a snake that has a venom and it's inside it's full venom but you don't feel it until it bites right until it puts us in and our tongue it can be that way it's it can be there just waiting for the right time to lash out and and say something that it shouldn't say James chapter 3 verse 6 and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity the tongue is a world of iniquity see it's not just out there it's right here in this little member that defile ahthe the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature and it is set on fire of hell if you just you know how many times you had a bite your tongue right keep from saying something well look it was already in your mind and did it come from the heart and so this is what we want to zoom in on is the things that we can control and that's the evil that's inside of our of ourselves we can do something about that praise God amen we entertain evil thoughts in a imaginations that eventually become a stronghold in our mind we can become so confused and twisted up by the devil's thoughts that he corrupts our mine way we think in her confusion it all starts as brother man taught us in our mind where the greatest battle ever fought and he says it is still going on today a lot of times we don't want to admit just how evil we can be in our minds in our hearts sometimes of course we want to to to view ourselves as pretty good chaps and we want others to to view us as as is good and then I believe those are they're both good desires but the fact of the matter is we deal with a very evil nature that is selfish self-centered and if I can say it like this self right it's just right it views itself is being right whether it's self righteous or not it's a self right that evil nature is always seeking its own will now this is the big evil it's not all that stuff out there all that stuff out there is because of something that started inside here that evil nature Romans chapter eight verse seven says because the carnal mind is enmity against God that's this mind the carnality of the way that it thinks is against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can it be sort of go ahead and try to if I could say discipline the mind you know it's just gonna pop up some some other way with another thought it just it has to be crucified because we need the mind of Christ amen James chapter four verse one just kind of laying a foundation and you know how I am with my foundations chapter 4 verse 1 from whence come Wars and Fighting's among you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members and we're talking about evil right they come in from inside of our members they're inside of us yeah that person they swore at us they got mad at us they cut us off they didn't give us the right food at the restaurant they didn't do what they said they were going to do they they yelled at us it's true that you can point a finger at some wrong that was done out there but if you yield to your flesh it's gonna wore off there's gonna be that war and it's gonna lash out and straighten that situation out and you're really not overcoming any evil with good you're trying to overcome the evil situation that you're in with an evil nature and you're you're you're not you're you're you're not overcoming evil with good you're overcoming evil with you're an evil nature and it's that's what the whole world is trying to do is try to outdo one another I'll tell one another out with one another trying to be bigger than one another executing who's the greatest who's the best who's who's always right or who's more right first fine do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy no it's it's not vain but we have a tendency of forgetting we have a tendency of forgetting kind of the nature that needs to be crucified every day or it can get out of hand now if you're an alcoholic they say that half of the battle is admitting that you're an alcoholic is to get somebody to admit that they have a problem that they have this problem because most of time it's in - now oh yeah I drink oh yeah I got the drink but just to call me an alcoholic no no no not that far and so a person who doesn't admit they have this severe problem is never going to look for help so why do they say that half the problem is admitting that you are what you are is because at that time you can begin to look for help to look for an answer to help you with your situation because you've admitted it now you're not no longer trying to to to downplay I think a lot of times we forget how needy we really are our condition Ecclesiastes chapter 5 verse 1 praise the Lord keep thy foot when thou goes to the house of God and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evil now the point I wanted to bring here is that you know we're supposed to go to the house of God we're supposed to praise the Lord we're supposed to offer the sacrifice of praise to the Lord but there is a way that we need to approach God a humble contrite like I know I need you Lord and sometimes we can forget that we do evil and at that point we're not we we're not we don't got half the battle won yet if I could say it like that we're still we still need to be convinced that we need to hear this word that we need to hear what God's trying to present to us instead of well you know I don't agree with that I I know I don't see that I'm okay why you saying that I'm not a sinner and of course you're not a sinner you're a saint you're you're you're saved by God's grace but if you have any sore of understanding about coming to the Statue of a perfect man well we go a little ways to go here and if you've gone through the course of the day you've seen where you follow where you've been overcome by evil where you just haven't had the answer to fix a problem what we need to reduce ourselves humble ourselves and and realize that there's a need inside of me and that need has to be taken care of in order for me to to help a situation or to overcome this thing that I'm in James chapter 4 verse 6 I know I'm jumping around a little bit but want to use these scriptures James says but but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resists the proud and he giveth grace to the humble so we need to MIT we need more help from the Lord we just need to admit that that's what that means to humble yourself is admit you need help not I'm here at church to learn you can go to college to learn you can watch so many things and learn so many things from so many people but we need help we've got inside amen praise the Lord we don't need more convincing that were okay when we go to church yeah yeah you're you're the bride don't forget that if we're forgetting who we are we probably ought to be spending a little bit more time with our Father in prayer and church is is there to encourage us by a long shot and to build our faith a message needs to build a faith but now the thing is church does not take the place of your walk with God we just don't got that kind of time we don't got that kind of time and God is want to do a short work in us a quick work in us and and and we need to be taking care of the things that we know to which you know spending more time in prayer spend more time getting prepared because I believe at least in when I see a with this ministry God is trying to get us to a place he's trying to really get us ready for a rapture and it's not something you float into or ease your way into it's something you have to press your way into and the righteous scarcely make it they barely make it and and and I think sometimes the the enemy or the the evil tries to get us in in a in a lukewarm lair to see a spot where we come to church and we're just looking for certain things to help us with what we want help with instead of realizing that we're here to learn more about our armor and and and and how to be an overcomer and how to get ready so I praise the Lord for this opportunity verse number seven says submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you so the way to overcome is to submit yourself to God discuses be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good there's a submission that is needed in order for you to take care of these problems that have to do outwardly here something has to take place on the inside if we're supposed to overcome evil with good we're only gonna fail with our own or with ourselves because there's no goodness in us there is no good in us amen look at Romans chapter seven I was talking to a brother this morning and these were already in my nose but he began to quote some scriptures here verse number 18 for I know that in me that is my flesh now in me dwelleth no good thing so how are we going to overcome the evil if there's no good in us for two we'll look at these he's describing the evil that's inside of him now for two we'll to do the right thing it's present with me but how to perform that which is good I can't find it it's like a Missy like something is missing my intent is there my desires there I want to do good but something's missing I just can't do it in himself in his flesh for the good that it would like to do i do not but the evil which I would not intend to do that I find myself doing now if I do that which I would not intend to do it is no more I that do it but evil it's sin that dwelleth in me that's who is doing it I find then a law that when I would go to do good evil is present with me it's inside of me to stop me from doing it it's here not up there is inside for I delight in the law of God after the inward man it's a beautiful law that desire and and God's power and his ability and and his desire for me to to do good the Word of God is perfect and and Paul saying I I delight in the law of God but he said I see another law warring in my members Amen I see another law in my members it's the law of sin so there's another law inside of him that I do not delight in basically he doesn't delight in this other law that he sees he says it's warring against the law of my mind it's coming against my mind because my mind is one to do the right thing but something happens in my mind and it wars against it it keeps me from doing the things that I want to do the right things and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members so in other words he sees himself being overcomed of evil it's all on the inside of us Saints Paul is seeking an escape from this battle and he cries out Oh wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver me from this body from the body of this death well Christ is the answer the spirit of the Living God is the answer is him on the inside that's who's going to deliver him who delivered him and who's gonna deliver us praise God Philippians chapter 4 verse number 11 no not that I speak in respect of what so Paul is not speaking about his what wanting for I have learned in whatsoever state therewith to be content you know a lot of times we want something and we hear our significant other or mom and dad or our boss or somebody say you need to be content with what you have that's all we got right now just be content with that and Paul is not speaking in respect of wanting nothing about his wants here and he makes this statement he says I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need so it's all experiences that Christ puts them through that he has learned to be content it didn't matter hungry not hungry in need suffering or everything's wonderful I've learned to be content he says I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me and praise God I know there's probably some of you that thought of that scripture when we began talking how to how to overcome evil with good well the only good there is is Christ there's none good but one that that's God there's no good thing that dwelleth in US will seek in our own way to wanting to do her own thing but it's through Christ that Paul was able to overcome evil with good it was Christ in him he said the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the son it was Christ in him and it gave him power to overcome somebody yelling at him somebody cutting him off somebody just you know not showing up to work somebody that swore at you somebody that didn't do what they told you they promised to do whatever it might be if Christ is preeminent Paul said when I'm weak then he is strong and he can be strong inside of us to overcome that the the rampant anger and the keep us from erupting a wrong nature our tongue spitting out some poison that's how we overcome the evil that's inside of us it's really receiving more of Christ I know we got the Holy Ghost but we need more and not only do we need more we need to learn to you too we have more and there's that that battle in that war in our mind I would go to do good but evil is present and we've got to learn to bring that situation under the control of the Holy Spirit and I want to just try to spend a few of little bit talking about that amen it's through the goodness of Christ that we overcome the evil that's in our life amen and we're going to overcome the evil with good God's goodness not our goodness not how good we are how much favor we have with somebody or a reputation or our are a way that we can influence somebody and and and and and and be able to be tell somebody how you know wonderful they are to keep them from you know getting upset now we just need God goodness inside of it it's a goodness of God that led us to repentance and it's going to be the goodness of God in us that overcomes all evil amen all evil if we humble ourselves to the Spirit of God he'll meet us and he'll meet the need that we have in our life but we need to humble ourselves enough now catch this we need to humble ourselves enough to submit to God if we only humble ourselves a little bit because we're you know being bothered right now and oh yeah I guess I'm just trying to push my will and I just humble myself a little bit but you really don't submit to God then you miss out of what it really takes to be an overcomer what what it really means to submit to the will of God is to lay down your life that's what it means that's what it means to help yourself lay down your will lay down your life lay down the direction that you're trying to go and let the life of Christ have his way inside of us the Spirit of the Living God inside of us overcoming the evil that rises up against the will of God which is to be willing to suffer that god may use your life to win souls I know that's big statement but I'm gonna by the grace of God take the rest of this time and show you perhaps a little bit different picture about overcoming evil you know God has a will for our life and we have our will and of course then we have Satan who's trying to give us a lot more of his will which is let your flesh have its way and it creates a tremendous battle turn with me to second Corinthians chapter four verse number seven 2nd Corinthians chapter four verse number seven says but we have this treasure in earthen vessels we have the Holy Ghost mm-hmm we have the Lord Jesus Christ we have our Savior in our vessels and it's a treasure that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us it's his goodness and what look what did it do for you we are troubled on every side yet we're not distressed no Paul talked about he's learned in whatever state he's it therein to be content right so we're troubled on every side yet we're not distressed we're perplexed but we're not despair we're persecuted don't we're not forsaken we're cast down but we're not destroyed always bearing about in the body in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus we got to remember that we've got to continue dying all I die daily not just once in the morning once at night but through the day and you'll know when you need to die because you'll be faced with the situation so we're always bearing about it's like a present tense it's like our God is a is a present help in a time of trouble he's presently there well we have to presently be dying out in order for God to give us the help that we're looking for we just can't continue in our flesh and expect God to be helping us and we want help we got our part to play here and Paul saying always bearing always bearing your-your-your burying it about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also might be made manifest in our bodies now I want you to catch that brother Jason what brother what brother Bruce was bringing about the manifestation of Christ in our life earlier today there's a part that we have to prep to play and and prayer helps puts us in a condition to recognize our need of the Lord and to focus more on that because if we do our part and die out to our will then God can do his part be manifest in our life and take care of the need amen verse 11 for we which live are always delivered unto the death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh we're always delivered unto death always we just got to say yes to it we don't want to fight it we don't want to currently fight these battles God knows what he's doing verse 12 so then death worketh in US but life and you notice why you're dying notice why you got to bear the death of the dying of the Lord Jesus so Christ can manifest himself inside of us and bring life to somebody now it's not about us it's about God it's about his purpose in his will it's about living for others so if we're talking about eternal life is living for others then somehow when we're going through this this term Oh down here and there's complex problems at work and at home and our neighbors and the bills and the finances somewhere down the line the life of Christ has to be manifested inside of you so somebody asked see it and grab on to life and say that's Jesus that's drill Jesus because otherwise people just look at you getting upset and getting bothered and that's just like normal hey that's normal so we have a part to play here amen so death worketh in US but life in you the death for Jesus sake what is death for Jesus sake it's Calvary it's God's purpose what is the sake of Jesus what is the purpose of God it was to see people saved and that's the purpose that that death must be working in us that others can see the life of Christ they're not going to see how good John Martin is well if anybody stayed enough time with John Myers if anybody's heard one of John Martin sermon they're gonna see there's not a whole lot of good in John Martin he's he's missing some marbles but hopefully they're gonna see the life of Christ cuz that's what it's all about amen first Corinthians chapter 9 let's try to go through these because I don't where we got our time is is getting away so I need you to say Amen let's get it going brother John 1st Corinthians chapter 9 verse number 19 for though I be free from all men yet have I made myself servant unto all that I might gain the more so we see the purpose of God working through the life of Paul we've talked about it many times when God called him he told him that he's gonna show him things that he was gonna have to suffer that he might win a lot of people and he gravitated to his calling he said yes I'm willing I don't want to be just a Christian I want to be willing to die out to my will that I could accomplish saving as many people as I can and he says here in the opening statement for though I'd be free I've been set free God has saved me he's taking all my sins away I subject myself yet they make myself a servant unto all for the purpose that I might gain the more there must have been quite a battle going on inside a pause mine for him to have to surrender constantly of just getting beat up and stoned and shipwreck and false brethren and just so many negative things coming out of his life constantly there must have been such a battle in his mind he had overcome it he had overcome it his flesh wanted to be served just like yours and mine but he had to crucify that in order with his spirit to serve the Lord Jesus Christ and you serve the Lord Jesus Christ by how you serve your brother how you serve your sister you want to do something good for God do it for his children verse number 20 Paul made himself a servant to all he said to the Jews he became as a Jew under the law as under the law without the law without the laws without the law verse number 22 to the week became I as weak that I might gain the week I am made all things to all man for one purpose I need to show off I need to need to gain favor that he might be able to impose his popularity upon a person he became all things to all men for one purpose that he might bring them to Jesus Christ and if we have any other purpose we're missing we're missing the mark of overcoming all the evil verse 23 you're not going to get them all you're only gonna get some you have to become Christ everybody have to love unconditionally you have to get hurt by everybody you have to love everybody you have to forgive everybody else take a mile for everybody you know what out of that all that hard work they don't feel like you're getting much out of it if some gets saved you're fulfilling the perfect will of God for your life that's your calling amen verse number 20 I'm sorry verse number 23 and this I do for the Gospels sake that I might be partaker with you now notice this he knew his going to heaven he knew he had a revelation of who his father was he knew he was going to heaven but you know what he wasn't satisfied with just him going to heaven he wanted to be a partaker with somebody else so he gave up his life that he could spend eternity with just one more person just one more he wanted to partay he want to sit that long table in heaven and have fellowship and partake and and talk for a thousand years he wanted that connection he wasn't just happy that his life was taken squared away mm-hmm know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that she may obtain in other words it is a personal affair and you are running you are not running against your brother and sister you are not running against a non-believer you're you're not running against the people of this world you've got a nature inside of you that the only way it's demolished is to die daily the only way it's not repenting getting baptized and it's all over no that's when the battle just starts but you're in a race every day you get up mm-hmm you don't your sneakers on you don't drink your old J you don't eat your Wheaties you don't submit yourself to God you don't die out I'm telling you that other man is going to take the upper hand in the race that day so he says run that he may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery he's temperance in all things but they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible crown I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air I hope I'm doing the right thing I hope this is accomplishing something no he knew what he had to do he had to keep his body control his body and bring it under subjection lest by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway and i'll tell you we're all guilty of sharing the gospel with somebody what they need to do and being guilty of the very same thing and I don't believe Paul it by any means was losing his salvation that's not what he was meaning but he's bringing a point across that we have to keep our body under subjection we just can't let it go and say well we're in the message I'm the first a messenger and I'm writing 14 books in the Bible and I I'm really good to go no he had to bring his body into subjection why because God had a work for him he had to willingly become a servant to all that he might win some that he might be partakers with some in having he had that vision without a vision the people perished Jesus Christ had a vision he gave that vision Nepal and he's here today he's alive today he's not dead he's not gone if we don't feel that vision not not just God help me to see what you want me to see the hours late the hours short don't get caught up in the things of this world don't get caught up the natural things that are just gonna disappear think about spending your time that's valuable you know as you get older time becomes more valuable when you're younger you think you got so much time you just want to do anything anything that your flesh wants after a while you realize that time is valuable and you want to do something different with your time than bullet you want to spend it with your family you want to to to have some value to you want to express love you want to do things that you wanted to do all your life and could do and I'm telling you the hour is late Jesus is coming and we need to spend our time very valuable to be wise understand that that we we gotta take advantage of them very little time that we have left over to be the servant that God has called us to be amen praise the Lord don't know where I was out right now but Paul was able to see that the law of sin was inside of him and he had to fight that battle he had her keep his body under subjection it was like a war zone in his mind and he had to bring these thoughts into captivity that's what he said right he also shared the same understanding in the Corinthian church and I just want to go there with you right now to second Corinthians chapter 10 verse number 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare they're not carnal but they're mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds so it's up here casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every evil thought to the obedience of Christ and having a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled now notice what is required isn't just okay I got to get those thoughts out of my head no an obedience is required an obedience something is required that means there's a battle going on what obedience is required it's to lay down your life that's what is required we don't war after the flesh our battle is a spiritual battle and it takes a humbling of our evil thoughts that are high and proud and feel just too good to lay down their life those are some pretty high falleth they actually exalting themselves against the knowledge of God will never overcome with our goodness thinking that we don't have to cast down certain thoughts in our head that tell us that we don't have to surrender our lives anymore to God than what we already done I gave him my life well everybody that comes to God accepts him as a savior and from that point forward they learn how to make Jesus their Lord and to take more of a control of their life I go through a course of a day and it's not hard for me to see where Jesus hasn't had control so I need to lay down my life and it needs not to be about me the light that needs to be lived is about those who are watching me those are they interact with those are the ones that that need Christ so this is the commandment and we know this in the Bible to love one another that's the commandment to love one another to love them enough that you're willing to lay down your life we can say we love one another but are we willing to lay down our will our desire our popularity or popular opinion or manipulation are what we want to get out of the relationship are we you know where are we willing to lay it all down do we love others enough to lay down our will to bring Christ to somebody be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with love there's only one good that's God and God is love it takes love the love of God in your heart that'll make you a servant to all you love God so much it's the love of Christ that constrains us that's how we overcome the evil that wants to just do its own will you know we can lash out and be negative and end and and say the wrong thing and we say we're sorry and that's that's normal and that's right but things don't have to get that far out there if we learn to control the evil inside of us and it takes God inside the Holy Ghost the love of God inside of us so how do we come how do we overcome took us this long to get to the end of the message so I hope you bear with me it starts with a lamb nature we were obedient to lay down our life as we are obedient to lay down our lives for one another you're overcoming the evil with God's goodness inside of you in other words you're not trying to do anything you're just obeying God you're you're you're bringing yourself under the obedience of Jesus Christ it takes a sacrificial life a humbling of yourself to fulfill the obedience that God requires and we'll see this a little bit more how did Jesus overcome he said be of good cheer for I have overcome the world he wanted us to is almost like him saying take a chill pill it's gonna be okay you're gonna overcome - because be of good cheer I have overcome and if he's living inside of us we're gonna overcome and so how did he overcome what did he have to overcome he had overcome his flesh that's what he had to overcome and how did he how did he do it he just laid it down he laid down like jesus said My father does love me because I lay down my life for the Sheep there was a love affair there he kept the father's Commandments revelations chapter five verse five and one of the outers saith unto John wheat not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof John he was so excited he had an expectation that when he would look at this one that prevailed it was going to be this great lion this king of the of the field the king of the of the wilderness is the lion and he had this expectation he was going to see this big rough terrible animal that was just so had the ability to prevail and when he looked he saw an obedient lamb that had just been slain he saw a surrendered life and Pilate thought he had power over Jesus control over this King said you don't got no power you have no power all power is given unto me but he laid down his life John said behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sin throne he laid down his life that's how we overcame it through him laying down his life for us how are those people out there going to overcome by you laying down your life how are you gonna overcome the evil that's trying to erupt this corrupted nature inside of you by you laying down your will for the further for God to come in and and live out his will through you now Ted we have a purpose in it there's a reason we're going through suffering there's a reason somebody yells at you there's a reason we we're attacked the way we are God is trying to get more control of our life he wants to take our life and demonstrate Jesus Christ to those that everybody's looking at as we're being attacked God wants to put you on display just like he put job on display God wants to put us all on display praise the Lord Jesus overcame evil so the obedience of laying down his life and that is how we overcome evil the evil inside of us by laying down our will to share God's will with others and there's the purpose we don't want to allow our evil nature to to overcome our desire to do good for God we don't want that we've got to lay down our flesh see will and and do the will of the Father men God hides himself in simplicity he hides his will he hides his guidance his is leadership for our lives the overcoming power it's it's hid in simplicity and I'll say it like this most of the time our flesh doesn't want to yield to suffering oh I don't think I should have I don't think I shut the lay down my life I don't think that I should have to do that God God suffer for me I should have to suffer and yet God is right there hid in simplicity we miss it it just goes over I had because our flesh can't grasp that it's the will of God turn with me to Romans chapter 12 and I want to hmm I want to go through this kind of as quick as I can because I know that time is coming up and I just I just need you to compare to bear with me this great chapter starts out in verse 1 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service so in other words laying down your life is the commandment of God and Paul saying it's your reasonable service look I have to do it you have to do it this is how you overcome this is remember the last verse in this chapters be not overcome of evil but overcome evil good and we're going to see how it works when we read this and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God our carnal mind wars after the flesh using our carnal weapons of imagination and evil thoughts and we yield to those things and we begin to to to to have some sort of drama we don't want to shake somebody's hand and we don't want to talk to somebody for a while we just we is carnal that's what that's how we think overcome a situation is with a carnal nine but what we need is we can't be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our mind what is that mind that renewing is the mind of Christ Philippians chapter 2 verse number 5 and we'll get back to this we're not gonna read all of it let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought that robbery to be equal with God but what did he do he made himself of no reputation he took upon him the form of a servant just like Paul and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself we're looking at where the victory is coming now how to overcome and he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross and this is how you prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God it's by you hump on yourself and becoming obedient and that's what Paul starting now you want to overcome evil with good present your body a living sacrifice let's drop down to verse 9 in Romans chapter 12 let love be without dissimulation there's nothing so cold as love without sincerity this is nothing so cold it's just it's just a hypocracy it's like a respective persons it's no problem anybody can love somebody they want to love and not love somebody they don't want to or fake it because they know they should but it takes a dying out of the flesh to love everybody unconditional to have love without dissimulation abhor that which is evil do that which is good be kind ly affectionate one toward another with brotherly love in honour preferring one another you know it's hard to prefer one another when you think you're better than somebody it's a dying out to prove what is there good and acceptable it is how you overcome the evil inside of you not slothful in business fervent spirit serving the Lord rejoicing in Hope patient in tribulation I've learned to be content whatever state I'm in patient tribulation it's hard to be patient tribulation continuing instant in prayer it's hard to do that when your flesh don't want to pray distributing to the necessity of the Saints I wonder how many of us have even thought about distributing to the necessity of the saints think about it we're we're we're we're we're usually busy trying to take care of her own necessities given to hospitality we'll have to put this one in practice down the road when we can come together bless them which persecute you bless and curse not what an emphasis bless them would persecute you why didn't it just stop there no it said it again bless and curse not because the tendency is our tongue that's evil it wants to go in and say something that we don't like about what that person did so it takes a dying out to overcome the evil that's inside of us all requires laying down our lives and presenting our bodies a living sacrifice rejoice with them that do rejoice weep with them that weep be of the same mind one toward another that's the mind of Christ mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits recompense to no man evil for evil you're not overcoming evil with good you need to give somebody something good when they give you evil praise God what an honor it is to let the Lord Jesus Christ and His goodness work through you to give good on to somebody that does evil to you or that has an evil intent that just don't care that just be literacy that's sarcastic or is dramatized there just gives you a cold shoulder what an honor it is to let Lord Jesus Christ use your vessel the goodness of God to overcome that evil that you're presented with oh I just love that recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honestly in the sight of all men and if it's possible if it be possible as much that lieth in you live peaceably with all men dearly beloved you know what if you're a peacemaker you're gonna have a lot more chance livin peaceably for somebody but if you don't know how to be a peacemaker you know what you're doing you're totally relying on somebody else to do all the work - for them to say I'm sorry for them to say you know I shouldn't have done that but if you're a peacemaker you know how to bring about peace dearly beloved avenge not yourselves avenge not yourself don't try to handle yourself but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay saith what let the Lord take care of it you just lay yourself down and overcome as Jesus did as a lamb therefore if a enemy hunger don't tell him well go get it yourself feed him if he thirst give him a drink for in do sowing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head it's the manifestation of the word be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with God with love with dying out to present the love of God one verse first John chapter 5 verse number 4 for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith you've got to have faith that if you lay down your life is going to to give you the victory in your life a lot of times we want to take control the handle we want to take control the the steering wheel we want to take control of the situation we don't have faith that God can do it to us we have faith that we can handle it so we try to do it and it don't work and then we feel down and our goal is to have faith that Christ in us if we lay down oh if we humble ourselves that God inside of us is going to become strong and overcome that evil that's trying to to have our nature just erupt when we don't want to rock amen god bless you stand with me be not overcome of evil overcome evil with good that's overcoming correctly it's God inside of us amen amen maybe we could just sing a little chorus and then we'll we'll pray a menacing flow through me flow through me
