business of taking our lives and working through every situation that basically is a stain as a wrinkle and get us to a place that we become a church without staying without wrinkle and to be part of that glorious church whoa what a privileged people we are no matter how much it may hurt when the word comes is there for our benefit to to get us to that place um well i want to say what a great blessing it is to see brother and sister johnson amen praise the lord i i wasn't sure whether we would see you today but i know that you're in good hands amen god bless you um we continue we need to continue praying for sister johnson amen for just a complete healing to that bone uh fracture in her back and then also we want to continue praying for his sister uh linda now who's got the uh broken kneecap there uh and we want to just for a moment say thank you to all you saints that have been praying for sister kathleen and fasting for her for this past week i want to say from the bottom of my heart god bless you may god reward you because uh we have seen uh such great results our sister gave a testimony and i just i just want to praise the lord i want to praise the lord for what he's done for our sister amen and that's the way a body should be functioning together amen this is going to be a different of a kind of a service and i hope that you just you know bear with me but i want to give a a little a missionary report um the first one we're going to watch it came in about a week ago from costa rica uh and brother eric shacon where he's the pastor there in this area we had met brother eric in 2006 when we had gone there on a mission trip and at that time he was just uh starting um and we had some services in a school for a meeting in the school and he had just uh some there that he had gathered and then some of the brothers that came from brother cabias's church was also there but we're going to watch a video and i'm going to say as we watch this i'm so impressed with how he has taken off so serious for the lord i want our church should be like this church and we've been um sponsoring him for a number of years and you know when you when you sponsor people honestly we sponsor dozens of ministers all over the world and obviously we uh we don't have enough funds to do that in this church i understand but god gave us a company and i know god gave that company it doesn't belong to john martin it belongs to the lord but there's so many times that you're giving and you're supporting and you're helping and some just don't seem to see a lot of fruit to be honest with you that's what it is it's called investments and some they they're just a great investment but you just give you just give i've never regretted giving even to those who've used my money i've never regretted because it's not mine to begin with it won't be when it's over it's all the lords but i want us just to to rejoice in this as we watch it i was totally impressed i seen it this morning for the first time amen maybe we could turn it up make sure it's up god bless you richly from emmanuel tabernacle costa rica we wish to send you a warm greeting in the name of the lord jesus christ we want to share the advance and the missionary work we are doing on our church divided on three subjects but first we want to report the follow-up that we have done in the conversation of our sister sharianna orbando from azeri city whom we baptized time ago and we included on our last report she lives at 34.17 miles from our church and since she does not have a car of her own she would have to travel from the mutton sides to the capital city and then take a bus to the church which will be a three-hour strip same time returning home we want to remind you that she started to follow our streaming services since the beginning of the pandemic and since then she had a job that requires her to work on sundays recently those circumstances changed and since she has a desire to attend to the church and while searching the best option for her to assist the services brother eric coordinated with vermonico cubiez pastor in san jose so she can attend to his congregation which is an hour and a half away from her home we pray that she perseveres every day and crowns her career now let's see the missionary advance of the church new missionary at liberia this is a city with 67 000 inhabitants we have had two meetings already performed by our brother and minister erin vado who is also a deacon at our church and an ordained minister now together with our brother daniel vado pastor of the church bible called tabernacle that is located 49.70 miles away from liberia in santa cruz guanacaste we agreed to wait three months for this missionary effort where brother eden will be traveling every two weeks to have a sunday service in the house of his nephew jose adam canales who requested to hear the message preached now the missionary work at san ramon during the following three months we will have services in different areas to spread the message of the hour besides the services we have been doing every sunday at bajo te hat in the house of sister veronica andino we went to have the services in san pedro at the house of sister anna vargas inviting close friends of the community and measured their interests to continue with this model in some of the houses of the new commerce at this very moment we are preaching every sunday by distributing the services among the associated ministers layman suasso is a very appreciated minister by the brethren in san ramon as he was the one that initiated efforts to establish a church there also brother stephen solis who is a minister under training he has showed an excellent streak of the word and the pastor of the church prayer eric at the end of three months we will evaluate this way of reaching the community and determine if it is time to rent a place in a more convenient area of the city thus far we have assigned some equipment to perform the services we have a sound base two speakers and a pulpit ready to be used once we are established in a conditional place a brother layman is given a portable pulpit and we assign a budget to buy an electric piano and microphones sister veronica's daughter who is a 12 year old young lady her name is christina she is playing a small piano for worship she is taking classes with one of the pianists from our church twice a month virtually and two more times on site we ask your prayers for this group amen evangelistic efforts on our city gracia is a city with 80 000 inhabitants distributed in seven districts during the last months we have prepared a message broadcasting program that will allow us to share through the four most visited and watched social media for better results with our previous door-to-door method we do not see a positive answer that is why we want to do an effort on sharing the goodness of the message of the hour in a different way we have called this initiative restore the faith restaurant and the catchword of this broadcasting campaign is turning the hearts of the children to the faith of the feathers this effort implies that during the following two years we've got willing every week we will be sharing seven micro videos one podcast a blog and as a gift of those interests an ebook about the topics of the message exposed throughout the mission media every three months we want to have an on-site event where we will be sharing printed material of the message with an exposition of the topics we covered so far we will have some time for questions and answers and all these posts will be linked to the website with the same name restaurant restore the faith this effort will reinforce activities in all districts where we perceived a better answer also starting july we are having our evangelistic services the last sunday of each month where our congregation will do an effort of inviting family and friends of their neighborhoods we have done this in the past before pandemic and we saw a good response the preaching will be focused on evangelism this will sum up to the other two sunday services where we have specific objectives to bring a solid teaching the first sunday of each month and the next friday a questions and answer service and the second sunday service we will be praying for the sick the speech of this preaching will be focused on divine healing and we are inviting from the community all patients from the palliative care clinic where several are terminal patients all residents of the nursing home besides any other sick person invited by a member of the church we have a fasting and prayer group formed with 10 brothers and sisters that will be preparing the place for these services in the second semester of 2022. praise god we ask for your prayers so all these initiatives can reach souls and the lord may touch their hearts and bring his children to the restored word god bless you praise the lord yeah i'm impressed i'm impressed and you know didn't have to tell them what to do just supported they had the vision and what what we need is a vision we've got capability we've got talents we've got gifts but we need a vision and my desire my prayer is that we could do so much more around the communities that we're living than what we're doing but i'll tell you what it's going to take is your heart and your time i don't even need your money i just need your heart and i need your time god to have that he can do a great work brother george sent in a little uh this morning a few pictures and he said good morning trust all is well with you all back home and brother george smith he's he's in africa he's another brother that we've been uh sponsoring monthly for uh quite a while and he says we've had some sir wonderful services with the saints here in zimbabwe in south africa it is winter here about 5 30 sunday morning today after church and lunch i'll fly onto durban for the services there tonight and several days of services and then on to cape town and then fly to nimibia and finally home on august 10. thank you for praying god has been gracious and answered a lot of questions just in the simplicity of preaching the word i am continuing to monitor the situations in venezuela and mexico uh help when possible may god bless you in your services today so how many remembers brother jerry smith yeah keep him in your prayers he just he's just he's part of the the missionaries that we support here in our church we don't have them often we don't talk about them often but they're working for the lord on the other side we can get together and we'll you know hear more stories but i say this is a serious thing here you know winning souls it's a serious thing and uh we have such a an opportunity if we could just get a little bit more serious that that the time that we have left here it's not about us it's not about us it's about the rest of the body that needs to get in because as soon as that happens we can get out of here of course we appreciate brother johnson uh he's enough will cannot be said will not be said down here and i'm will be rejoicing for years because of what brother johnson has had a heart a seriousness for the souls of men and women and we just appreciate them and not i'm not enough could be said i could say it every service but uh we're here because he's here he was here because he came to ann arbor [Laughter] and so we just appreciate the example that he's get he is he's set and uh you know missions isn't just uh it's just a little something of every church it ought to be the main heart of the church amen do you believe that i believe with all my heart amen let's stand together for the reading of the word how many uh i trust we're all in sync with god how many is looking for the holy spirit to give revelation amen amen i i think that's real good because it takes all the pressure off of me of having to do it amen if you're really really looking to the lord i believe you're looking to the right one may god begin this morning by his spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation wouldn't it be amazing if we could just leave here with something that we didn't have when we came something that can help you in your personal life to to believe to trust and to overcome and not to not to look to man and depend on man to help but to look to him did you know that nasa has a greater telescope than hubble they just came out with it i believe it's called james webb space telescope if brother martin was here he'd probably be able to tell us all about it but they learned that there's more than uh there's ten more galaxies just like the milky way than they previously thought and the milky way is pretty big right i'm quoting here it says we knew we would see things hubble didn't see but in this case we're seeing things differently and that's what happens when the lord reveals to us his word we see things differently he has such a telescope that can look in and and reveal to us what he really trying to say but we just got to get in tune with him get our eyes off our flesh amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of first corinthians chapter 12. we're going to read verses 12 and 13. we want to title this message of family working together and for a subject a healthy functioning body we're not going to take the whole time we're just going to take a little bit of time because we're starting a little bit late and then we want to uh we've asked our wife and our daughter cheryl and ann to uh give us some some thoughts that could help us to work together as a family i hope that's okay with you amen amen let's just bow in a word of prayer heavenly father before we begin to read these scriptures lord we're calling on you because we need you the great interpreter of the word lord we humbly pray that you forgive us of all of our sins lord anything that is brought a displeasure any time that you've had to turn your head any time that lord you've been ashamed of us we pray that the the blood of jesus christ would just cover us and cleanse us and wash us and set us all aside for this service today and may you come with the power of that prevailing revelation into our hearts and life and help us to see something in your word lord that we just haven't quite seen before through the the great telescope of the holy spirit power oh granite lord we commit ourself and the remainder of this service now into your hands for your honor and glory we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen first corinthians chapter 12 verse 12 and 13 for as many for as the body is one and have many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether it be jew or gr gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit amen god bless you may be seated when we come to christ we the bible says that we been all made to drink into one spirit so right now if we all had some coffee we'd get some caffeine if we all drank a pop we'd get some sugar if we all drank some liquor god forbid we'd do that but we'd get dizzy and we would all uh feel the same thing may act a little bit different you know some get jitteries with the coffee and in some can drink it all day long not get the jitters but you still get the caffeine and so when we come to christ we all act like christ right then brother brandon said it the spirit of beethoven live us and we begin to play like beethoven so when we when we're baptized into the spirit of christ something transpires we can no longer just say yes i'm born again and it don't show it shows it shows just like when we were in the world we all drank of a worldly spirit we were born with that spirit it's a wrong spirit and that spirit is simply a spirit of unbelief that's what that spirit it is it's unbelief that jesus is lord in fact that spirit that we were with it wanted to it wanted to induce us to be lord of our life to to be in control to make our own decisions to choose what we're going to do in life and that spirit is antichrist that's why we got to be born again that's why we must come to the the knowledge that jesus is not just lord of everything but he's lord of our life that we have control of what we yield ourselves to now no matter how long we've been serving the lord our old nature still wants to rise up and get us to control things jesus's remedy for this was to deny our own will on a daily basis and to pick up his will that was that was his remedy for this situation because we can't get rid of it show me a man that has if we don't discipline ourselves to present our body as a living sacrifice we can end up becoming a lukewarm christian sometimes trying sometimes not that's not christ in him there's no darkness at all romans chapter 3 verse 9 says what then are we better than they no in no wise for we have before prove both jews and gentiles that they are all under sin as it is written that there is none righteous no not one and there's none that understandeth there's none that seeketh after god i remember when i was in the world i didn't understand i wasn't seeking for god now look he says they are all gone out of the way they are all together become unprofitable there's none that do with good no not one if you remember when we were in the world we were just into whatever we were into that was our life and we thought it was the coolest thing the one thing was for sure that god wasn't in it all gone out of the way what way god's way god is the only way he's the way the truth and the life the true fact is we must believe that he is lord he's not just a savior to those that want to get saved then then go do what you want to do he's a lord and that's the faith that we must have romans 12 tells us not to be conformed to the world but to be transformed by the renewing of our mind that we can prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god for our life what the perfect will of god for our life is to let him be lord of all of our decisions of our plans not us saying well we're going to do this we're going to do that this is how i think we're going to do things it doesn't matter what we think he needs to be lord amen every man when he's his he's doing his very best he's still vanity he still comes short of what god truly is what god's expectations are for man even though we're professing christians if we don't crucify our flesh i'll say it like this our will daily we can still end up getting out of the way that's why i read that scripture i know that was before we came to christ but we can still get out of the way we can still revert back to our old nature brother john you're saying some strong things well just let me ask you has anybody ever seen that old nature creep out of you oh yeah all you got to say is i'm sorry look at all the times that you said sorry that's that old nature trying to come back out and i'm telling you to whom you yield yourself servants to bay his servant you are whichever way you want to go brother branham said the sickest body that he knows was the body of christ ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 says and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the ear of the spirit now look that now worketh in the children of disobedience it's now working in those who still don't believe that jesus is lord i'll go to church i'll do this i'm not don't ask me don't tell me i'll do this and that's it that's where that spirit is working it's working in those that we're going to just only do what they want because they're still lord they're still carrying that spirit of unbelief that's what the devil wants among whom also we all had our conversations in the times past and the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others now let me ask you when was the last time that your nature got really raffy wasn't that long ago was it it still wants to creep in the more we learn to just simply do what jesus said and to deny ourselves daily spend time in prayer say god i need you i can't go through the day on my own with my own abilities and live the word i need the holy ghost living in me that's the realness of what every christian should be doing every day now this same nature can take over a lot of believers who do not continually press towards the mark we can get to the place that we become unprofitable the body of christ to become unprofitable for the body of christ you know no one wants to take a look at their life and say this is where i'm lacking i understand that this is not a favorable type of a ministry but look we need to get serious about where god is calling us to instead of just always making excuses why i'm here or i'm not doing enough or this is all that i i need to be doing verse eight now we know something at the beginning came into our life and changed us did it not where his great love were with he loved us verse 8 says for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it's the actual gift of god amen not of works unless any of us should say hey i have something to do with it for we are his workmanship this is what i want to get to created in christ jesus unto good works which god had before ordained that we should we should walk in them we're just not you know saved from hell and now go do what you want to do we've actually been created god god takes our hearts and our life and he creates us unto doing good works good works god takes our old nature to the process of sanctification and obedience and brings about his nature his character inside of us and i'll say that what happens is we learn to let jesus be lord amen the reality where he he is the one that dictates to us what we're going to do it's no longer us just okay i'm going to fit church in i'm going to try to do this and i'll do that but you know after that i'm doing my own thing you know satan has whitewashed us so much to where church is just just a part of a christian or or our our duties our responsibilities it's just a little power i'll do that get that out of the way then i'm just gonna do what i want to do god desires brother brahm told us god wants to give us the holy ghost so bad he told us about all the pressure it would take with a four inch pipe that's a mile high at the bottom of that would be so much pressure and god wants to give you and i the holy ghost more than the that amount of pressure that kind of pressure that's how much he wants to give us the holy ghost and we're satisfied with just popping in the church amen god is serious with those that want to get serious with him and what he when he gives you the holy ghost i'm telling you you're no more lord of your life you're no more lord of your life he becomes your lord he's not going to give you himself and let you be lord no because at the garden of eden he put cherubians with swords there he wouldn't let anybody live like that he's not going to do it today he's looking to take over our lives first peter chapter 1 verse 2 says we're the elect according to foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit and on be an obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ we're elect according to foreknowledge of god the father it don't stop there that's just that's just okay we're elected but now there's a process of sanctification there's a process of obedience and that where we fall we need to be sprinkled with the blood of christ and we need to keep going through this process of sanctification that's coming to church hearing the word walking in the word becoming obedient to that word and changing your life that things happen in your life don't be satisfied with just being a christian be satisfied with coming into the image of christ that's right amen second thessalonians 2 13 says but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning from the very beginning when he called you from the very beginning before he even chose you to what salvation but how does this happen not just repent be baptized i'm saved no this is much greater is he that endure to the end he'll be saved through sanctification of the spirit and what belief of the truth now if at the end every knee is going to bow and every tongue is going to confess that jesus is lord don't you think the truth today is that god wants you to believe that jesus should be lord of your life amen now we know the whole world will just has no problem confessing yeah jesus is lord he's lord of my life i gave him my life but how many wants to hold themselves accountable to the word he's calling us saints god is working through his holy spirit in our heart he's working we are the workmanship of the holy spirit in our lives amen the bible tells us to work out now our own salvation with an attitude and that attitude is fear and trembling we talked a little bit about last service about coming into church without the fear and trembling like i got it all worked out i'm just here for knowledge i'm just here to you know i'm here to what are we here for brother brian says we're here to find out where we're at with him i'm so spiritual i know where i'm at with god before i come to church that's the type of attitude we can have philippians chapter 2 verse 13 says for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure so do all things without murmurings and disputes that you may be blameless harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world wow god is doing something in me yeah my flesh wants to rise up and say no i'm going to do what i want to do and nobody's going to tell me it's up to you to recognize that your flesh it's up to you to take a stand and say i'm going to let god have his way in my life i'm going to let him be lord of my life lord of my decisions for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god had before ordained that we should walk in them we're no longer selfish zombies just doing our own thing nobody's going to tell me just walking around doing our own thing i don't want to be that i don't want to be a stranger to the body of christ i want to fit into the body of christ i don't want to be distant from the body christ i want to fit right in the body of christ are you with me ephesians 2 verse 19. now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints in the household of god i hope you don't feel like a stranger today i hope you don't feel like a foreigner god bless our visitors god bless you and are built upon the foundation of the prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone our belief system is on the word amen in whom all the building this is every one of you and i in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom he also are builded together for a habitation of god through the spirit now notice in both these verses it talks about together together together one spirit that i see so much is i'm going to serve god my own way without the body i'm going to do what i want to do in my way and i understand that we are just a small part of a universal body called christ but you know what what happens in another church doesn't have anything to do with happening in this church and if i'm not in that church i am not needed in that church but if i'm in this church i'm needed in this church are you with me and we need to start holding ourselves responsible for what god has called us to do in this church i i hope this is okay amen you know i sure hope there's not one individual here that's thinking this whole sermon is everything he's saying it's directed right at me i don't know why he didn't tell me and he just you know preached something else but honestly this is for all of us this is for me this this is for me this is for me just as much as anybody probably more so i'm the one that's responsible amen amen so we need the scripture says in whom though the building fitly framed together groweth into a holy temple unto the lord in whom the whole building together for a habitation of god through the spirit so god working through the spirit we're all working together to be the house of god i just have some some some thoughts i've been thinking about i wonder who here goes to this church maybe they're not even here sitting today but who is has the capability today to functioning as a body is that a good question to function as a body you know you can compare this with your family functioning as a family brothers and sisters mom and dads children it's easy to function as long as everybody's giving you what you want you're doing exactly what you want you're hearing what you want to hear it's easy to function but try eating your asparagus when you don't like asparagus you're broccoli try doing things working with somebody that's difficult no wonder who has the capability of helping someone who's actually out of the way someone who doesn't understand as much as you do someone who's who doesn't care about seeking god all they want to do is talk i wonder who has the capability in this church to help that body be together we're very good at identifying somebody's problem somebody's issue but are we capable of helping are we capable of building oh no the pastor do that the pastor will do that the past brother john oh is it is that what we read no we're all supposed to be working together we're all supposed to be looking for someone to help build not to take sides with us oh yeah we got some very strong opinion paper people god is looking for laborers for workers who care who care enough to function the way the scripture tells us we should function no no if god placed me here in this church for one year i know god would hold me accountable for the life that i would live here and the work that i would do in this church for one year i want you to think about that we want to get comfortable we as christians should never get comfortable our peace doesn't come from our flesh being comfortable our peace comes from god in the middle child's in the middle of tests in the middle whatever he has us to do we got peace because we're in the will of god how many can bear with one another who's got an arrogant spirit who knows how to handle that situation who knows how to restore someone who's been overtaken in a fault who knows how to get their hands dirty who knows how to function like a body of christ well brother john i i didn't know this is you i didn't know i was supposed to be doing this i thought you know this was for okay i want you to understand each and every one of you are in the body we've been baptized we've drank of the same spirit we should be doing the same works there's no excuses none it's time for us to leave wanting to step up determined to step up to look for a need to help not to sit there and be judgmental you know there are as we've seen there are people who are willing to labor god says if we don't labor we don't eat think about what god wants to do for you in your life amen think about your children your grandchildren your neighbors your finances your home god wants to bless you and see you prosper above all things even as your soul prospers we've got to put our we've got to put the word first the word first i wonder sometimes when god looks at us if he sees a dysfunctional body now tell you it's not because we haven't had the word we've had the word get me out of the way we've had a five-fold ministry here that gave us the word so we'll be without excuse right but i think sometimes we're going out of god's way into our way reverting back to doing our own life our own things you know we we've got time we make time did you know we make time for what we want now of course we don't have time to do everything that we want to do but we definitely make time for things we want may not be exactly right then but you know it's hard to make time for the lord i don't understand that we can get up every day because we go to work but we have a hard time getting up early to come to church we have a hard time getting our hands dirty to help somebody because we're just they don't listen to me anyways they don't agree with me they don't they want nothing is that is that what we would do with our children is that what we do we just kind of like i don't care we're the body of christ there are the christ in you ought to be loving the worst one amongst us the neediest one amongst us something inside should have such a compassion that you can't sit still in yourself amen i don't think i can understand where brother brandon says the sickest body i know is is the body of christ it makes sense it's too easy to jump on the internet and watch some bigger church who has just it a body that just flows so much better that's great i understand and i agree with you but you know what i was telling my wife this morning every one of us is going to stand before the lord and give an account now i don't think he's going to care at all how many sermons i watched what i agreed with or what i didn't agree with he will look and he will ask me to give an account of my life my time what i did and either either i'm going to multiply either i'm going to hear well done not how many sermons i listen to not what i thought was better or worse but how many times i got my hands dirty to go increase there's so much more we could be doing if we just had one ingredient more drinking more of the spirit of god amen really getting serious with saying god fill me with the holy ghost i want you to know when you actually are helping somebody and yeah it may be a natural even a carnal thing getting them through at the point but god is building character in you when you're helping them because character is built in the middle trials and when you're dealing with somebody that's got an arrogant spirit or just don't care or is out of the way or don't want to listen to you it takes character to restore and help that person and god's building himself in you when you're actually just obeying the word it's through sanctification and obedience of this holy ghost that you've been elected to to bring forth the character of christ see we the things that we're wanting to get away from are the very things that god is coming for god's coming for that ephesians chapter 4 verse 1 says therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you're called so we've been called unto good works right with his workmanship so let's let's let's take a look at of how we should be walking with all lowliness and meekness longsuffering forbearing one another in love working hard to keep unity some people don't even want to work at it and it's it's not your unity it's the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace i'll tell you what when you truly have the right spirit you don't ever have to worry what a person is going to do if they've got the right spirit what they're doing you don't have to worry it's only when they got the other spirit the spirit that we're born with it's a selfish spirit if i'm gonna be lord i'm gonna do i want my own popularity my own reputation i'm trying to build myself trying to get something out of this for me but you know we've been called to function as a body of christ together there's no room for me in christ that's why i have to die out to self so he can live through me we're not going to be a bunch of individuals we're going to have the nature of christ in heaven he is marrying someone without spot or wrinkle they're going to be just like him when we see him understand we're going to have our own personalities understand that because that's the way god made us but our character it's not our character it's his okay so there is one body one spirit even as you're called into one hope if you're calling one lord one faith one baptism one god father of all who is above all and through all and in you all sounds like we should be working together as one one one so whatever you say in christ it's good for all of us that's why we the scripture says be subject one to another how do you know what somebody's trying to tell you isn't from god you know we the last thing we want to do is have things figured out that's the last thing we want to do the first thing we want to do is humble ourselves before the lord amen amen so we should be working together as the body of christ as a family ephesians chapter 4 verse 14. i need to hurry that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro you know what children are they just they're not paying attention they're going doing their own thing you got to constantly say don't do that don't go over there don't get into that it's time for dinner you know what i told you do your chores you know how children are they're just all over the place well to me a church that's all over the place is tossed to and fro i'm going to do my own thing i'm going to come when i want to come and no that ain't what god called us to that may be how it is but that ain't the true body of christ now understand understand this that we are in a church as brother branham said there's three types of believers in every church we can't do nothing about it and and jesus never told peter james and john to get the unbelievers out to get judas out he didn't do that because they're there for a reason amen but the thing is will you be the one that shines is the light of christ will you be the one to get your hands dirty and help somebody because it's not behind the pulpit the body is is how it functions when it talks to one another when it interacts with one another when it prays for one another when it fellowships with one another when they ask one another to do things that's the body that's the functioning of the body we all have that same equal opportunity to pick up the phone and care about somebody to write a letter to care about somebody to invite somebody to church to care about somebody to think about those who haven't been at church you know we have some that are backslidden can you say amen it's the truth we have some that are out of the way but do we have a body that knows how to function with the situation or is it just the pastor's job i'm just asking is it i believe god wants us to start functioning together don't you all right it's fourth we don't wear children toss to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive you know what that is i don't have to do that it's not my job doctrine that's what i live by we don't preach it but that doesn't mean satan don't preach it to us all right but speaking the truth in love why do i got to do that what's the purpose may grow up grow up into all things not just where you're at but the things that you're not at may grow up in all things which is the head even christ in other words jesus wants to be the lord of all of our life from whom the whole body now look at this fitly joined together compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working and the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love i just got a question who is fulfilling that who's fulfilling it it's we've been called to it this is our calling this is what god is wanting in the church if we would just come together and pray and seek the lord god could move amongst i tell you this is a big this is a big thing but he didn't place this on the ministry this is the body this is the potty we need to go home and study this you got a sermon to preach you got a sermon to live you got a body to help you got you got to get fitly joined together you got to supply every joint we got a lot of joints you ever have a joint that's out of joint or stiff had a man minister tell me the other day says you know we're getting too old do we even care about getting some lubrication to a joint over here you know we get so consume with the same spirit we had before we came to christ the spirit of self my my life my personal goals too busy to give anything more to the body brother john this sermon is not encouraging me that's okay brother john this sermon doesn't make me like you that's okay too but i hope that you love god enough that you want to become this word amen because that's really that's all it's important that on the that we get to a place that we're we're functioning like we've seen in this video with a burden don't be satisfied for what you're doing in the church right now don't be satisfied with that i'm talking about giving to where there's a lacking it is i don't mean it wrong but playing anything that's up here playing instruments preaching leading songs all this that you do in front of somebody is much more enjoyable are you with me so what i'm speaking about in the church is something that's one on one with a need that's what a mature church is trying to work at looking how to help this part of the body fit together how to supply it how to bring an increase to the body how to edify it in love that's our goal this preaching doesn't do it you know what does it you take in the word and say that's me that's me i'm the body of christ i'm part of that body that's for me that word is for me i want him to be lord of my life in that area he hasn't called us to please herself amen and i want to be a halfway converted believer you know there's certain there's certain individuals the only reason they want you is so they can get something out of you otherwise they don't spend any time trying to help you i don't want to be that it's true that as a christian we should give and not expect in return that's what christians do but every one of us should be doing that right and not taking advantage of one another we're not to take advantage of one another we're actually supposed to help one another that's the right spirit it's a giving spirit you know jfk said to the country don't ask what this country can do for you in other words give us more stimulus checks he said but the question should be what can you do for the country it's not all about what this church can do for you god brought you in this church to help the church don't worry he'll take care of you the word will take care of you the word will supply what you need but you've been called in here to help a body and if that's not your attitude that's not your spirit there's something wrong i don't want to be dysfunctional i don't want to be out of the way doing my own thing only time i've got time to help somebody or do something in the church is when i can get something out of it oh god free me of that thing free me of that thing i want to give my life to christ i want him to be lord of everything i want that revelation i want it for us let's try to get through this real quick first corinthians chapter 12 where we started verse number 12 for as the body is one we're one we're one we're one when one suffers we all suffer and all uh and many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also as christ for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body and we've all been made to drink into one spirit so take some time to just check about yours take some time make some some self inward look because that's how we get from where we're at to where he's calling us that's the only way we get there if we keep feeling we're there we're there we're doing enough it's not me it's somebody else you know i brought the pitchfork today where are we going to go look i i told i've said this so many times when i am not preaching anymore if i get kicked out of the church i'll tell you one thing you will never ever take christ away from me you will never take get me to a place where i will not live the rest of my life trying to help people i may falter i may fall i may do a lot of bad things but i'm going to get back up and i'm going to serve god until i'm dead and it's a decision i made i'm going to live for others because nothing else is more important than that nothing for if for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because i am not of the hand i am not of the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body so it doesn't matter how we view one another we're still part of the body and if the ears shall say because i am not the eye i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body it's still of the body no matter what you think you are no matter how great you are or how least important you think you are you're still part of the body still must function the same way think about this you may not been serving the lord as long as other people it's not how long you've been serving the lord it's how mature you are you can get ahead of somebody so fast if you just get serious and give your heart to jesus christ let him be lord of everything and begin to live this word because you know there we got a lot of formality we got a lot of form i want to see the life and i'll tell you when i see it everybody will see it it's just it's just everybody sees the life if the whole body were the eye then where were the hearing if the whole we're hearing where were the smelling but now have god set the members every one of them in the body as it has pleased him and if it were all one member where would the body if the pastor's supposed to do it all what do we need the body for saints what is your responsibility what is it and because if you don't identify it how can you know if you met it only you can get serious with the lord amen how many times have you walked out of church and just being honest how many times have you walked out of the church and just thought i wasn't no that's not me that's not for me you know what i'm saying you've got to walk out of the church and say that's for me no matter how it feels it's only the way we grow if if we're not preaching the word here this is my best advice to you find a church that's preaching all the word and go there you don't want to stay in a church that's half half or even 90 10. i remember before i came to the lord and i was searching for a church i didn't even know this message but i remember on my bed as a teenager god i want to know the truth i knew there was only one truth there couldn't be two there had to be one and there was over 400 denominations at that time and when my priest told me that the pope has the power to change the word that was one of the most confusing things i ever heard i went and i saw god god i wanted the truth he was obviously calling me because something was in there that wanted the truth and i said god i don't care what church you want me to go to i'll go to any church you tell me to go but i need you to tell me which one has the truth and that's when god led me to brother johnson's church and i'll say it like this if this church doesn't have the truth find the one that does for you for your family for your soul but if it does then get underneath it get behind it give everything you got support the church support the pastor support everything it does get behind the things they're doing to reach out get behind the mission get behind everything don't have church be just for your natural flesh get behind it for the cause of christ because one day you understand we're all going to stand before the lord if this thing was real this thing called send the light here in fent was real we're all going to answer for it i'm going to answer for it the most the most i will that's a fearful thing that's a fearful thought for me i don't know how you feel but i don't want to stand before the lord without the blood of christ i know i've failed i know i've messed up yes by the grace of god if a righteous man falls seven times seven times he'll get back up he'll keep going but we're on a mission this we can't play church anymore we can't get caught up in laodicea we've got to start moving as a body [Music] what verse are we in verse 20. but now they but now are they many members yet but one body and the eye cannot say to the hand i have no need of thee nor again the heads say to the feet i have no need of you nay much more of those members of the body which seem to be i can't really get nothing from them so you know what attitude they're they're necessary and we're going to find out they're more necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we should be taking time to honor them not forget about them not not talk to them because we don't need them but go out of your way you know one thing there's some people that hardly know how to show appreciation to one another i'll tell you i'm as a pastor you know who's takes time to go out of the way to say thank you and to those it just they can't seem to find it you know what i'm saying the body i mean i am so thankful for every part of my body honestly i'm just be honest with you i wouldn't want to come up here with part of my body missing i wouldn't i'm thankful for every part of my body we should be thankful for one another for every part of the body no matter if it's the toe neither told we don't see it but honestly try walking without a toe you need it for balance with you you need a you don't when you talk when we talk to one another we're not staring at one another's backbone but our backbone is what holds us up and there's a lot to that backbone that's the prayers of the saints right there that's the that's the prayers of the saints that's that's what really makes the ministry what it should be all right which we think to be less honorable upon them we bestow more abundant honor and uncomely parts have more abundant cleanliness for our communist parts have no need but god have tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that which part which lacked in other words no matter what you're going through god really cares about you that there should be no what oh my is that okay if i read this is it okay that there should be no schisms in the body do you know what that is what that is is me and ben and stan and donna we agree together we see that we you know we like click no matter if sister linda citra trish or brother mark don't see it no schisms in the body we ought to love one another exactly the same and if you got a problem with somebody get on your knees until god gives you a drink of that holy spirit till you can love everybody the same and you can put your arms around your brother you your you sisters put your arms around your sisters you know what i'm trying to say we got to get to a place where we're one one body one body no no isms that there should be no schisms in the body but that the members should have the same care care i don't get along with them they don't like me they're arrogant they're always like telling me how great they are they're you know they're always out of the way they they don't they don't care about seeking the lord do you see that excuse in there i don't know why we come up with them i don't know why we don't roll up our sleeves and just find a way to make it happen i don't know what you know god is calling us to maturity to grow up to be no more children just tossed over here with this ism tossed over here with that schism find something that needs to be done in the body don't wait to be asked you get in your prayer room god will play something on your heart i'd rather see you try to do something and fail you know we've been spending i think as nine weeks now in the music have music music musician meetings we haven't had musician meetings on a regular basis the time of the whole church we tried try devil didn't want it and i'm not saying we've improved like such gang busters that they're coming from the east and the west [Laughter] but i'm so proud of our song leaders i'm so proud of them so proud of my my wife and ann i don't care how much we fail there is such improvement we're going in the right direction and that's what it takes fail but try fail but try because god's going to look at you one day and he's going to say well done well done thou good and what not perfect faithful all right let's try to finish this up that there be no schisms and and whether one member suffer all the members suffer or one member be honored all the members rejoice with it you know do you ever have that don't want to say anything because i don't want you know them to get a big head you know i just i'm gonna calm it down so i'm not gonna hey just follow the word it's not your job to stop somebody from getting a big head just honor the word honor the word obey the word now ye are the body of christ and members in particular and god has set some in the church apostles prophets teachers miracles after that miracles gifts healings helps government divers and tongues now are they all pastors they'll probably say do i teach all the working miracles no no no no but coveted earnestly the best of gifts because they're needed for the functioning of the body brother branham did say if i could only have one thing in the church i'd want to be the love of god i'd rather have that than all the gifts we got that we got access to that you you i i couldn't speak in tongues if i wanted to i couldn't prophesy if i wanted to i couldn't go to something and heal him if i wanted to but i can't yield to love i can't give my life for another that's my choice god gave me that choice let's stand together i want to read this quote and we're going to have a word of prayer amen brother branham said this it says if i do things wrong he said this in the message faith in the son of god he says i don't aim to god be merciful to me for i try to do all that i know how to help his people i love him i know that he holds all the future and whatever mind shall be it's in his hands now this is what he said so he said each day i want to live not for myself each day each day not just church days each day if i live for myself i live a selfish life i want to live for others oh i love the word i love the prophet i love what he brought i want to live for others and give what strength i have not to myself and to my own pleasure but for the benefit of others that'll build the kingdom of god is that your desire you pray with me our heavenly father we come to you at this moment hearing your word lord we heard your word and certainly lord you have challenged us to grow up and every one of us in areas perhaps that we don't think about need maturing lord i'm so grateful that you have called us to be one body not to be separate not to have certain camps or isms not to even speak things that would divide but lord you've called us to endeavor to keep the unity of the spirit and father i pray for those lord who have that willing heart that willingness to let you be lord of all their life that you would continue to unfold to each of them how they can better edify the body of christ when they're in their prayer closet when they're driving down the road lord if it's in their heart they want it i pray that you would begin to show them bless our church lord for we want to be what you have called us to be a lighthouse in this area we give you the praise for these things now we humbly pray in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you you may be seated um we're off the live stream at this time
