[30:23] God who at sundry times and in diverse

[30:30] fathers by the prophets
[30:32] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[30:34] by his son whom Heath appointed heir of
[30:38] All Things by whom also he made the
[30:41] worlds
[30:42] who being the brightness of his glory
[30:44] and the express image of his person and
[30:48] upholding All Things by the word of his
[30:50] power

[31:13] that this evening you'll just come down
[31:16] and Be Our Guest
[31:17] Lord we believe that you are here and we
[31:21] believe Lord that holy men of old were
[31:23] moved by the Holy Spirit and they wrote

[31:31] pray that you just come tonight Lord and

[31:42] amen you may be seated
[31:44] praise the Lord so
[31:47] you have to forgive me for the
[31:54] so we started on the Masterpiece and
[31:58] I found out there was way too much in it
[32:01] so
[32:03] last time we just ran out of time we
[32:05] just ran out of time so I stopped that's
[32:07] that's the honest truth I just stopped
[32:10] so I'd like to continue on
[32:14] and amen
[32:16] amen so we're gonna do it a little
[32:18] different
[32:20] um I spent
[32:22] uh
[32:24] I don't know
[32:25] eight or nine years as a Sunday school
[32:27] teacher down in the basement of Ann
[32:29] Arbor
[32:31] so so I'm going to do a Sunday school we
[32:35] and where believe me we are not going to
[32:39] get
[32:39] where
[32:41] I want to go
[32:43] we're not going to get there but we're
[32:45] going to get somewhere
[32:47] that's what's going to happen we're
[32:49] going to get somewhere so if uh
[32:52] sister Amanda I want just go back to uh
[32:55] Hebrews verse 2.
[32:58] so we'll just start here I just want to
[33:00] so
[33:01] by time we get done tonight
[33:05] we should have
[33:07] shine some light on verse two
[33:11] and some light on verse 3.
[33:13] brother Brenner made it very clear that
[33:16] God was a great sculptor and that he had
[33:21] a masterpiece that he was trying to
[33:24] express to the world and and the last
[33:27] time when if if you go back and
[33:30] um look at we talked about Michelangelo
[33:33] because because brother Brandon talked
[33:36] about that and how that he made this
[33:38] this masterpiece of Moses and the things
[33:42] that were important in that was that no
[33:44] man had ever seen Moses
[33:46] but Michelangelo got so inspired in his
[33:51] mind that it drove him to create a
[33:54] masterpiece and in that so in order for
[33:58] him to do that he had to go and find a
[34:01] piece of granite that that when he
[34:04] looked at it it didn't look like Moses
[34:06] when you looked at it when he went and
[34:09] got the rock it was just a rock
[34:11] but when Michelangelo looked at it he
[34:15] saw Moses in that rock he saw the
[34:19] finished product even though the outside
[34:22] of it didn't look anything
[34:24] and brother brandem in that mess in the
[34:26] message the Masterpiece he said he said
[34:29] to the unlearned well Michelangelo was
[34:32] beating on it with a hammer and a chisel
[34:34] and things and breaking it down that the
[34:37] unlearned looked at it and said what
[34:39] what is it that you're doing because you
[34:41] cannot see what he had in his mind so
[34:45] verse 2 says he says hath in these last
[34:48] days spoken unto us by his son
[34:52] whom Heath appointed heir of all things
[34:55] and by whom also he made the worlds
[35:00] he did that by Jesus Christ well that
[35:03] doesn't seem possible because Jesus
[35:05] Christ was born three four thousand
[35:07] years after the world was created so how
[35:10] did he do that
[35:12] and then in verse 3 it says who being
[35:15] the brightness of his glory and the
[35:17] express image of his person and
[35:21] and if you look at Express image of this
[35:24] person that means the essence of God the
[35:29] character of God
[35:31] so we want to start tonight I wonder
[35:37] read a quote out of who is this
[35:39] Melchizedek
[35:41] so brother Brandon says so now in the
[35:43] beginning God dwelt Alone with his
[35:47] attributes
[35:48] and sometimes you hear words
[35:52] but it's a lot easier if you can see it
[35:59] so here's God
[36:02] and because he's a being can everybody
[36:06] can you see that
[36:07] okay
[36:08] so we're making a McLeod because well
[36:12] who knows we've never seen God the Bible
[36:15] tells us that no man has ever seen God
[36:17] and he's a spirit he just moves he just
[36:21] goes different places but in the
[36:23] beginning brother Branham said he said
[36:24] God dwelt Alone with his attributes
[36:28] So within this cloud
[36:32] we're attributes
[36:35] an attribute
[36:39] is
[36:41] well an attribute is a little part of
[36:43] you
[36:45] so if I have the attribute of Roy right
[36:48] now I have the attribute of white hair
[36:51] and that's part of me and and I have
[36:54] failing eyesight so I have glasses
[36:56] that's part of me but I'm also quite the
[36:59] prankster that's an attribute of me and
[37:02] those dwell within me so so in the
[37:06] beginning there was God and he dwelt
[37:09] alone he didn't have angels yet because
[37:12] we find out well
[37:14] he he didn't have anything it was just
[37:17] him alone with his attributes
[37:20] and brother Brandon then says he says
[37:22] his attributes
[37:24] that's his thoughts
[37:29] so we find out
[37:31] that God dwelt Alone
[37:34] with his thoughts
[37:36] and his attributes
[37:39] now I didn't put this in the in the
[37:42] notes
[37:42] but most everybody can quote Genesis 1
[37:45] 1. in Genesis 1 1 says in the beginning
[37:49] God created the heavens and the Earth
[37:53] Hebrews 1 says Jesus Christ created
[37:56] their heavens and the Earth
[37:58] but in in Genesis 1 1 it says God
[38:01] created the heavens and the Earth if you
[38:04] go and look Moses when he wrote Genesis
[38:07] God is is the Hebrew word Elohim
[38:12] and Elohim means self-existing one
[38:15] self-existing he he just exists in
[38:19] eternity he has no beginning he has no
[38:21] end he's just there
[38:24] and he's got his attributes which is his
[38:27] thoughts
[38:28] thoughts of Peace thoughts of Joy
[38:31] thoughts all just all kinds of thoughts
[38:33] and they're all in him
[38:35] and we find out that God is a great
[38:38] Sculptor
[38:39] so he has something already in his mind
[38:42] that he wants to bring into
[38:45] manifestation but he has no way to do
[38:48] that because well he's a spirit
[38:51] now John 1 1. says this tells us that in
[38:57] the beginning was the word
[39:00] and it says the Word was God and the
[39:04] Word was with God and we all know that
[39:08] well the word is not Elohim
[39:13] the word is a is a Greek word called
[39:17] logos
[39:20] and logos
[39:21] is the essence of God himself
[39:26] so as God dwelt Alone with his
[39:29] attributes and his thoughts before he
[39:32] could even create the word he had to
[39:35] have a way to express that word
[39:38] and that was the logos which came out of
[39:42] God it was it was a pillar of fire
[39:45] though at that time because there was no
[39:47] eyes there was no Angels there was
[39:49] nothing but when the logos came forth
[39:53] the logos was all the thoughts all the
[39:57] attributes of God was in that logos
[40:00] and that logos then was able to create
[40:05] the heavens and the Earth
[40:07] because the very next thing
[40:11] so brother Branham says he said so you
[40:13] so
[40:15] he says just like a great architect
[40:18] he sat down and in his mind he drawed
[40:22] out what he was thinking
[40:24] what he's going to build he can create
[40:27] well an architect can't create he could
[40:31] take something that's already been
[40:33] created and make it into a different
[40:35] form because God is the only one he's
[40:38] the only one that can create
[40:41] but he gets in his mind what he's going
[40:43] to do and then that's his thoughts
[40:47] that's his desires and now it's a
[40:51] thought and then when he speaks it
[40:55] it becomes the word
[40:58] amen
[41:01] so the thoughts
[41:03] are here oh yeah this is a much
[41:05] bettering
[41:07] thank you brother Mark
[41:11] the thoughts
[41:13] became the word
[41:19] now when you thinking things you're just
[41:21] thinking things but when it comes out of
[41:23] your mouth you can't take it back
[41:25] so like they say you know make sure all
[41:28] your words are got plenty of sugar on
[41:30] them because you don't know which ones
[41:31] you got to eat
[41:32] [Laughter]
[41:36] so God in the beginning so you see
[41:40] I'm going to use this screen over here
[41:42] so he gets in his mind what he's going
[41:44] to do and that's his thoughts that's his
[41:47] desires that's his attributes
[41:52] now it's all hid
[41:54] but he's a great Master Sculptor
[41:57] amen and then he speaks it and then it's
[42:01] a word then amen
[42:05] now the next slide so it's
[42:08] go ahead sister
[42:10] so a word is a thought
[42:13] when it's expressed
[42:15] it's a word and then a thought expressed
[42:18] becomes or is a word but it has to be a
[42:22] thought first so it's God's attributes
[42:24] see so the attributes
[42:26] if you think about it and that's why
[42:29] this is
[42:31] this is really important
[42:34] love joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[42:37] kindness those are the attributes of the
[42:39] Holy Spirit
[42:41] yet man does not possess those
[42:43] attributes because man is a fallen
[42:46] nature he has a he's a fallen creature
[42:48] and he's he's angry all the time most of
[42:51] us are angry we just we just we have
[42:54] thoughts but
[42:55] they're not the thoughts of God so he
[42:59] has attributes and his attributes are
[43:01] the same as his thought and then it
[43:03] becomes a thought then it becomes a word
[43:05] but when it becomes a word
[43:08] so we find out in John 1 1 he said there
[43:11] he said though he said so in the
[43:14] beginning was the word
[43:17] and the Word was God
[43:20] and the Word was with God because you
[43:22] can't separate the two
[43:24] a man is what he says he is
[43:27] you are what you say you are
[43:32] that's how a man is known by what his
[43:34] words are
[43:35] but your words are empty because
[43:39] what they have to do
[43:43] is they have to manifest
[43:52] so a thought
[43:54] a thought is just a thought
[43:57] you think about it you know people have
[43:58] all kinds of thoughts
[44:00] and if they keep their
[44:02] their thoughts to themselves they never
[44:05] share their thoughts so they never share
[44:06] their words
[44:08] but if they share their words their
[44:11] words are empty unless they can manifest
[44:13] their word amen
[44:16] somebody has a thought they say oh I'm
[44:19] going to build something and then I'm
[44:20] going to share that with somebody
[44:22] well you're still not a builder unless
[44:25] you actually build something and that is
[44:28] the end of this circle
[44:31] you have to have all of those parts
[44:36] so God he didn't just
[44:39] they're in Hebrews
[44:41] he says hath in these last days spoken
[44:44] to us by his son whom Heath appointed
[44:47] heir of All Things by whom also he made
[44:50] the worlds so he made the world by his
[44:53] thoughts becoming word and then becoming
[44:56] manifest amen
[45:03] so
[45:05] God when he wanted when he back in the
[45:09] beginning
[45:10] he had he had thoughts he had he wanted
[45:13] a family he wanted to be a redeemer he
[45:15] wanted to be a Healer he he had all of
[45:18] these these attributes that then he he
[45:22] could project them unto the logos
[45:27] and the logos then could act on that
[45:31] so when he said let there be light it
[45:34] wasn't God saying let there be light but
[45:37] it was the logo said let there be light
[45:39] and when it became word it wasn't
[45:41] complete until light came into existence
[45:45] when he created the heavens and the
[45:47] Earth he said let there be and then it
[45:50] became and it completed all of that amen
[45:55] so God in the beginning he had all these
[45:59] things hid away
[46:02] praise the Lord amen
[46:06] so go ahead sister Amanda so
[46:10] um
[46:12] I think it's the next slide after that
[46:22] oh
[46:24] good
[46:26] it's a this is a little different for me
[46:28] because I just get up and just go
[46:32] but I wanted you to see it he says so
[46:34] maybe I'll say it make it a little
[46:35] plainer when God speaks the word he
[46:38] doesn't need a man or any woman or no
[46:41] one else to say this is what it means
[46:43] when he says he says well God meant this
[46:45] God means just what he says he means see
[46:47] go ahead do the next one
[46:49] amen
[46:51] and now does he interpret his own word
[46:53] see by fulfilling it so I'm not just
[46:56] making this up
[46:58] that's that's what I want you to see the
[46:59] quotes
[47:00] so the a virgin shall conceive
[47:03] and she did
[47:05] now you think about that
[47:08] God before the foundation of the world
[47:10] already
[47:11] saw Mary already saw his Masterpiece he
[47:16] already saw this whole thing planned out
[47:19] in his mind because the Bible tells us
[47:21] that the lamb was slain before the
[47:23] foundation of the world before before
[47:26] the logos even came in came into
[47:30] existence God already
[47:33] already in his attributes and his
[47:36] thoughts he'd already he'd already
[47:37] thought these things
[47:39] now
[47:41] when
[47:42] his thought his word came forth
[47:46] and Isaiah under the inspiration of the
[47:49] Holy Spirit he got in the he couldn't
[47:51] just say it in himself
[47:53] you can't just say it and you can't just
[47:55] speak you just you can't no man can
[47:58] create things no man can can do these
[48:01] things unless God be with him so Isaiah
[48:05] when Isaiah said uh Behold a virgin
[48:07] shall conceive everybody could doubt it
[48:10] because there was it never happened
[48:14] and Isaiah died and all the people that
[48:17] signed the prophecy they all died too
[48:20] the priest that was there the day that
[48:22] he gave it the king that he uziah the
[48:24] king and and when Isaiah gave those
[48:27] prophecies and that everybody in that
[48:29] Court they all died because it was 700
[48:31] years later
[48:34] that that word became manifest
[48:38] amen
[48:39] amen it has to become manifest
[48:43] God does the fulfilling and he doesn't
[48:46] need an interpreter interpretation he
[48:49] says let there be light and there was
[48:50] and that doesn't need an interpretation
[48:52] amen
[48:55] praise the Lord amen
[48:57] so going to the next slide sister
[49:00] so God in preparing this masterpiece
[49:04] when God created this masterpiece he had
[49:07] to he had to
[49:10] pick
[49:11] elements it had to be made according to
[49:17] some thought that he had
[49:20] now God because he's the author of the
[49:23] word and he can't be separated from his
[49:25] word because Genesis 1 1 said God
[49:28] created the heavens and the Earth and
[49:29] John 1 says that logos created the
[49:32] heavens and the Earth
[49:34] so we can't be separated from the two so
[49:37] when he goes to create a masterpiece
[49:39] he's already got a precedent he's
[49:42] already got a way that he will do that
[49:44] and that is by the spoken word of God
[49:47] everything that God does has to come
[49:51] back to the word
[49:53] if it doesn't come back to the word then
[49:56] it's not God
[49:58] so when God was getting ready to create
[50:00] this masterpiece
[50:03] he had to put it on a a foundation
[50:06] so we found when we when we looked at
[50:10] um Michelangelo and when he created
[50:12] Moses
[50:14] when when he when he did that he put it
[50:17] on a foundation he didn't just create
[50:20] this the statue and just set it on the
[50:23] ground
[50:24] he actually created a foundation to set
[50:27] it on
[50:29] and God created a foundation for his
[50:32] masterpiece
[50:33] and he says that Foundation was the
[50:37] Patriarchs and the patriarch Foundation
[50:39] the first was Abraham and then Isaac
[50:46] so
[50:48] let's see if this will
[50:51] erase
[50:54] praise the Lord
[51:04] so God is going to create this
[51:05] masterpiece and we all know the
[51:06] Masterpiece is Jesus Christ right
[51:10] but he's got to put it on a foundation
[51:17] so he puts it on a foundation in the
[51:19] four corners of the foundation is
[51:22] Abraham Isaac Jacob and then Joseph
[51:27] amen go to go to the next slide
[51:30] sister
[51:31] so Abraham was the foundation of Faith
[51:35] how do we know that
[51:38] because Abraham when he heard the word
[51:40] of God he acted on it
[51:43] he acted on it when God said Abram
[51:46] I want you to leave your family I want
[51:49] you to go to a country you've never seen
[51:50] before I want you to follow me and Abram
[51:53] had to make a decision
[51:57] of this unseen God
[51:59] that he could feel
[52:01] because it it caught us attention
[52:04] and that word was so that thought
[52:07] had become it wasn't the written word
[52:10] yet but if that thought was so imprinted
[52:13] on Abram till Abram finally had to
[52:17] manifest that and come out or the
[52:19] chaldees
[52:21] he had to come out of that
[52:23] and that Foundation all of us
[52:27] if we don't have faith then our
[52:30] foundation's wrong
[52:32] our foundation will break just think if
[52:34] I'm going to put a I'm going to put a a
[52:36] big old heavy four or five ton statue on
[52:41] top of this rock
[52:42] this thing had better be perfect
[52:45] It better work
[52:46] so I'm going to put that I'm going to
[52:49] put
[52:50] God's Masterpiece on something that
[52:53] can't be shaken
[52:55] it's got to be able to stand the test
[52:58] so God took Abram
[53:01] and he gave Abram just simple little
[53:04] simple commands little simple things he
[53:07] revealed just little things to him
[53:09] and Abram every time he heard it then he
[53:12] had to act on it and God is very patient
[53:15] he waits for him to act on it when he
[53:17] acts on it then God gives him another
[53:19] little little thought gives them a
[53:21] little more attribute and everything
[53:23] that Abram does then reflects the
[53:26] invisible God
[53:28] it just keeps reflecting him
[53:31] it says so then the foundation of love
[53:33] was Isaac
[53:35] so Abram because he loved God
[53:40] gave him a promise
[53:42] brother John was you know preaching
[53:44] about that on Sunday he gave him a
[53:46] promise and
[53:49] Abram they go think about it Abram came
[53:53] up in his own mind between him and Sarah
[53:56] they came up in their own mind they said
[53:59] well God can't keep his word
[54:03] the promise that he gave you isn't
[54:05] coming to pass
[54:06] so maybe you could just go and take my
[54:09] Bond woman Hagar
[54:11] and you could have the baby from Hagar
[54:14] and he did
[54:16] he went into Hagar and he had Ishmael
[54:20] but when he had Ishmael that wasn't the
[54:23] word of God
[54:24] it was a perverted word
[54:27] amen it was still the promise because it
[54:31] had part of Abram in it that's why God
[54:33] couldn't that's why he couldn't destroy
[54:36] Ishmael
[54:38] because the Covenant was with Abram
[54:41] and Ishmael could he had the DNA of
[54:44] Abram in him
[54:46] so God can't Cur he can't destroy
[54:49] Ishmael without destroying Abram and if
[54:52] he destroys Abram then he has to destroy
[54:54] himself
[54:55] he has to he has to start all over and
[54:58] he doesn't make mistakes God doesn't
[54:59] make mistakes
[55:01] he's got a plan he's already he sees the
[55:04] future he knows the problems we're going
[55:07] to have tomorrow the next day he sees
[55:09] him he's because before he even created
[55:12] the heavens and the Earth he already
[55:14] figured it all out praise the Lord
[55:17] so we're never going to come up short on
[55:19] this you're going to say oh oh my my car
[55:21] broke down does the Lord know about it
[55:24] yeah he does
[55:26] all my boss got mad at me he fired me
[55:29] does the Lord know about it yeah he does
[55:33] God knows everything about us
[55:36] amen
[55:38] so
[55:39] the foundation of love was Isaac because
[55:42] God had to train Abram say Abram no no
[55:46] no no no no no look
[55:48] this covenant's between you and me and
[55:50] Sarah because Sarah
[55:53] is your wife Hagar is not
[55:58] and and when he did that then God
[56:02] expressed
[56:03] his word through Abram by taking him up
[56:07] on the mountain
[56:08] sacrificing
[56:10] right and God God took him up on the
[56:14] mountain
[56:16] he told Abram he says Abram now you've
[56:19] followed me all these years and he said
[56:21] now I want you to destroy
[56:24] the only evidence that you'll be the
[56:26] father of Nations
[56:31] to see if he would believe his word
[56:34] and he did he went he took Isaac up
[56:37] there we all know the story Abram when
[56:40] he got ready to slay him the angel of
[56:43] the Lord came down and said now I know
[56:45] Abram that you love me above everything
[56:48] else
[56:50] and that attribute was explained it was
[56:54] faith
[56:55] and then the foundation of love was
[56:58] through Isaac because Isaac then became
[57:01] the promised son
[57:03] and he had Rebecca and that's why I say
[57:06] you get in trouble real quick we could
[57:08] preach four hours on that
[57:11] so then he went and he found Grace
[57:16] was Jacob
[57:18] and Jacob
[57:19] Jacob actually didn't have any
[57:21] redeemable attributes
[57:25] and neither do we
[57:28] none of us are good
[57:31] we might think we're good but when a
[57:32] push come to shove we're we're not
[57:37] will lie to save our skin Abram did
[57:42] will will pull all kinds of shady deals
[57:45] in our lives
[57:47] but one day when the word comes and
[57:51] Crosses that thought
[57:57] it's a masterpiece
[58:00] God's grace was extended to Jacob
[58:06] Jacob you know Jacob went off and and uh
[58:10] he deceived his father the prophet
[58:14] and
[58:15] and he he ran off to Laban and when he
[58:19] got to Laban you know
[58:20] your sins will always find you out
[58:23] that's what Bible says that it will
[58:25] always find you out well Jacob
[58:28] he was a supplanter so when he gets over
[58:31] to Laban you know what they say
[58:33] be wary what you you know be careful
[58:34] what you plant because what you saw you
[58:36] Sharif
[58:38] so he was kind of crooked with his dad
[58:40] to get the birthright and he went over
[58:42] here and he saw Rachel and he says oh
[58:45] she's hot
[58:47] and he went right to Laban and said hey
[58:50] how long can I can I and he said not a
[58:52] problem he says work seven years I'll
[58:55] give you Rachel for a wife and he said
[58:57] I'll do it you know because Love is
[58:58] Blind right
[59:01] and the next thing that happened to him
[59:04] was when he got to the marriage and you
[59:06] have to understand
[59:08] um Jewish weddings because they have a
[59:10] veil and all you see is their eyes
[59:13] and they married under a tent
[59:16] and the priest and when he went in to
[59:21] his wedding chamber that after the after
[59:23] the ceremony was done
[59:27] and he took the veil off and he said who
[59:29] is this
[59:33] God had to train Jacob
[59:37] and Jacob found out he went back to he
[59:40] says wait wait wait wait wait wait he
[59:41] said didn't I say I work he says yeah
[59:43] but he says the older sisters got to be
[59:45] married before the younger so he said
[59:47] will you work seven years more
[59:50] so he did
[59:52] but see Jacob wasn't redeemed
[59:54] Jacob was still he's thinking and it
[59:57] says you know what I'm gonna do I'm
[59:58] gonna figure this out so he figured out
[1:00:01] a way you know to have the ring ring
[1:00:03] straight cattle and the sheep and and
[1:00:06] and he and he stole everything away
[1:00:09] and then one day the word came and
[1:00:12] started to try him
[1:00:14] it started to try him and it bothered
[1:00:16] him and and it it drove him to do
[1:00:19] something that he didn't want to do and
[1:00:21] that was go back home
[1:00:24] he didn't want to go back home but there
[1:00:27] was something in the word that that
[1:00:29] caused them to do that and then there's
[1:00:31] all kinds of problems things that happen
[1:00:33] along the way but when he got down
[1:00:37] I'm just going to call it the River
[1:00:38] Jordan because I'm not sure what river
[1:00:40] it was but he got down there and he said
[1:00:42] he said his family I mean the guy's he's
[1:00:45] what man would do that
[1:00:48] I'm gonna meet somebody who's mad at me
[1:00:51] Esau my brother so I think what I'll do
[1:00:53] is I'll send my wife my kids I'll send
[1:00:56] all my my goods I'll give him a car I
[1:00:59] was I'll send all the gold and when he
[1:01:01] sees how rich I am maybe it'll soften
[1:01:03] his heart you see his heart was wrong
[1:01:06] and when he got down to pray and the
[1:01:08] angel of the Lord came down and talked
[1:01:10] to him he had to wrestle that out until
[1:01:13] that attribute was that attribute of
[1:01:17] deceiver was completely wiped off the
[1:01:20] Slate
[1:01:21] and God could manifest Grace
[1:01:26] in Jacob that's God just building a
[1:01:29] foundation
[1:01:30] and then and then brother random said he
[1:01:33] said in the last corner he says was
[1:01:35] Joseph
[1:01:37] and he says but when God saw Joseph he
[1:01:40] said
[1:01:41] Joseph was perfection
[1:01:43] amen
[1:01:45] can you put that back up there
[1:01:48] see Joseph was perfection
[1:01:53] there is no there was where he could set
[1:01:55] his Monument upon the First Foundation
[1:01:57] the second Foundation the third
[1:01:59] Foundation but on the fourth Foundation
[1:02:01] once once he had Joseph and brother
[1:02:04] random said he said the only thing that
[1:02:06] was against Joseph is he told one little
[1:02:09] tiny lie
[1:02:11] because he told he told pharaoh
[1:02:15] well he didn't tell Pharaoh but he told
[1:02:17] his brothers he says
[1:02:19] don't tell them you're sheep herders
[1:02:22] because she produced was Abomination to
[1:02:24] the Egyptians
[1:02:27] and brother random said was the only
[1:02:28] thing that he had on him
[1:02:30] so he laid these Foundation Stones down
[1:02:34] but you'll notice that when all of this
[1:02:37] took place there was no written word
[1:02:42] there was no written word
[1:02:44] not
[1:02:47] amen
[1:02:50] so he says so now the foundation is laid
[1:02:52] through faith love Grace and to
[1:02:55] Perfection through the Patriarchs
[1:02:58] and now the Bodywork that come on this
[1:03:01] to this Great Masterpiece was then the
[1:03:04] prophets amen
[1:03:07] see the prophets not the law the
[1:03:12] prophets for the prophets was the
[1:03:14] Vindicated word
[1:03:21] so when Moses came on the mountain I
[1:03:24] want to um
[1:03:29] each paragraph I got 66 up there
[1:03:32] okay
[1:03:34] he says so this Grace was the prophets
[1:03:37] which was the word and he says I hope
[1:03:39] you can read it see the prophets not the
[1:03:43] laws but you say wait a minute but I
[1:03:45] thought the law was the word it is
[1:03:49] but if it's not manifested
[1:03:52] then it's just a it's just dead letter
[1:03:57] this the scriptures Jesus said my words
[1:04:02] are spirit and life
[1:04:07] he said if you don't eat of the flesh or
[1:04:09] the son of a son of man and drink of his
[1:04:11] blood he says you have no part with me
[1:04:13] because if the word never is manifested
[1:04:18] it's just dead
[1:04:22] amen
[1:04:26] so he says the prophet's not the law the
[1:04:28] prophets for the prophets was the
[1:04:31] Vindicated word which makes the body not
[1:04:34] the Patriarchs the prophets they were
[1:04:38] the word
[1:04:39] so there's something that took place
[1:04:41] brother Brandon was showing that God had
[1:04:44] laid a foundation in the Book of Genesis
[1:04:46] and then once he had laid that
[1:04:49] Foundation where do they end up at the
[1:04:52] end of the book of Genesis
[1:04:54] they're in bondage in Egypt
[1:04:58] Joseph has died Jacob has died Abraham
[1:05:02] has died Isaac is there have all died
[1:05:05] they got just of the 12 tribes and they
[1:05:07] have gone down into Egypt they've gone
[1:05:09] down in the world and now God is going
[1:05:12] to start building on this Foundation
[1:05:17] and the very first thing that he brings
[1:05:19] on the scene is the the law Giver
[1:05:24] Moses
[1:05:26] Moses and Moses was a prophet
[1:05:29] he was born a prophet
[1:05:32] he was born a proper child
[1:05:34] and God did miraculous things for Moses
[1:05:38] amen but Moses was flawed
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:43] Moses was flawed
[1:05:47] so in
[1:05:51] in the message
[1:05:55] the masterpiece
[1:05:58] brother Branham talks about
[1:06:00] going to Africa
[1:06:03] to the Kimberly diamond mine so that's
[1:06:05] my
[1:06:07] that's my diamond if you're wondering
[1:06:09] what that is
[1:06:11] but a diamond is just a rock
[1:06:14] and he says you know you can't take a
[1:06:16] rock and just crush it
[1:06:18] he says you have to cut it
[1:06:21] you have to cut it
[1:06:23] and so when you cut the Rock
[1:06:26] a little piece of the rock flies off
[1:06:29] you cut another piece and it flies off
[1:06:33] cut another piece that flies off
[1:06:37] when all these little pieces come off
[1:06:39] they're made out of the same thing the
[1:06:41] diamonds made out of
[1:06:43] and brother Branham says he says you
[1:06:45] don't take these little pieces and throw
[1:06:46] them away
[1:06:48] he said you wanna know what you do with
[1:06:49] the little pieces
[1:06:50] it says you put them on a victrola
[1:06:52] needle now of course we don't have
[1:06:53] victrolas anymore but he says you put it
[1:06:56] on there and he says and you have a
[1:06:58] plastic record
[1:07:00] and he says the record when you buy it
[1:07:03] at the store if you've ever bought a
[1:07:05] vinyl record when you buy it at the
[1:07:07] store
[1:07:08] it's the the vinyl cover says this is
[1:07:12] this is a record of Symphonies well you
[1:07:15] can take that and put it up next year
[1:07:16] and everything and you'll never hear a
[1:07:18] symphony
[1:07:19] you wanna you say oh this is Beethoven's
[1:07:22] Fifth well I don't hear nothing
[1:07:25] you got to put it on a device and then
[1:07:27] you got to take a diamond that was cut
[1:07:30] from the main Diamond to hear the Unseen
[1:07:32] music
[1:07:34] man
[1:07:35] the word of God
[1:07:38] I love it
[1:07:40] the word of God is unheard music see you
[1:07:45] can you can well I don't hear any love
[1:07:47] in here when I look in here he says Thou
[1:07:49] shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt do
[1:07:52] this not do that but it's a love story
[1:07:54] but I don't hear it you got to be cut
[1:07:56] out into the Rock
[1:07:59] you got to be cut out of the rock to
[1:08:01] play the record you can't even play the
[1:08:03] record if you're not part of the Rock
[1:08:06] amen
[1:08:08] amen
[1:08:10] praise the Lord amen
[1:08:12] I want to make our Presbyterian shout
[1:08:14] and a few of you guys should be shouting
[1:08:18] you see
[1:08:21] that is that is when when we looked at
[1:08:23] Michelangelo that's the whole point the
[1:08:27] point is Michelangelo saw the vision and
[1:08:31] he searched he searched for a rock that
[1:08:34] when he looked at it he saw Moses
[1:08:39] right now when I look at you I don't see
[1:08:42] Jesus Christ
[1:08:44] but when God looks at you he sees your
[1:08:48] part of the rock praise the Lord amen
[1:08:52] amen
[1:08:54] amen
[1:08:56] amen
[1:08:59] amen sister Amanda which which paragraph
[1:09:02] We got up there
[1:09:04] Okay so
[1:09:06] so he says
[1:09:08] so the prophets the prophets were little
[1:09:12] pieces broken off The Rock
[1:09:15] the prophets reflected little attributes
[1:09:19] of the main diamond
[1:09:21] amen
[1:09:23] but not so the law of Moses
[1:09:29] the law of Moses did not reflect the
[1:09:32] diamond
[1:09:34] because the Bible tells me that he that
[1:09:38] wants to be a slave or a doer of the law
[1:09:42] let him be a doer of the whole law
[1:09:45] or lest he be a sinner
[1:09:48] and he's and what did he say I conclude
[1:09:51] that you're all under sin and none of
[1:09:52] you can keep the law I can't keep the
[1:09:54] law anybody who says they can keep the
[1:09:56] Ten Commandments as a lie or are they
[1:09:58] deceived or they've never read them or
[1:10:00] whatever and brother Branham brother
[1:10:03] random said see he said so the
[1:10:05] Masterpiece that God was creating
[1:10:09] was out of the prophets in each Prophet
[1:10:13] was the Fulfillment of a word of God
[1:10:18] amen
[1:10:19] amen
[1:10:23] amen
[1:10:27] go to the next one sister
[1:10:30] yes
[1:10:31] so and when God by the prophets and
[1:10:33] under the law he condemned us to sin
[1:10:36] that's all the law does
[1:10:38] the Bible says that without the law he
[1:10:40] says we would have not known sin he said
[1:10:42] that but when when the law came into the
[1:10:45] world then sin was revealed
[1:10:49] don't sweat
[1:10:51] the law
[1:10:53] look and said Thou shalt not take the
[1:10:54] Lord thy God's name in vain and then I
[1:10:56] found out I was a sinner
[1:10:58] before that I didn't know it I didn't
[1:11:01] know it was wrong to drink I didn't know
[1:11:02] it was wrong to gamble I didn't I didn't
[1:11:04] know any of these things but when the
[1:11:06] law came
[1:11:08] and when the law came the law was he was
[1:11:12] he was our jailer
[1:11:16] because he could get us into prison he
[1:11:18] could take us there really fast
[1:11:21] but he couldn't get us out
[1:11:23] amen but God
[1:11:27] had profits and every Prophet when a
[1:11:31] prophet was manifest there was Grace
[1:11:34] even though they rebuked Israel for
[1:11:37] backsliding and disobeying the law there
[1:11:40] was Grace there was love there was there
[1:11:43] was a reflection off the Masterpiece
[1:11:45] that we couldn't see because it's just a
[1:11:47] little chip
[1:11:50] it's just a little tiny bit
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:55] see he says the law has no Grace it only
[1:11:58] tells you you are a sinner
[1:12:02] but when Jesus came on the scene he was
[1:12:05] the Fulfillment he was the Fulfillment
[1:12:08] of everything that God had promised
[1:12:13] amen
[1:12:15] he was the Masterpiece that God hid
[1:12:20] from Moses
[1:12:22] he hid him from Abraham
[1:12:25] he hid them from all the Patriarchs
[1:12:28] none of them he gave the promise to Adam
[1:12:31] he told the Adam after he kicked him out
[1:12:34] of the garden and he he cast judgment on
[1:12:37] them he told him he says he says they'll
[1:12:40] be coming one someday there will be one
[1:12:42] coming and he will bruise the Serpent's
[1:12:45] head and you will bruise his heel
[1:12:47] amen
[1:12:49] but they didn't know how it was going to
[1:12:51] work they didn't know all they knew is
[1:12:53] that they had done wrong and now their
[1:12:55] Fellowship was God was gone amen
[1:12:58] he was the perfect identical image of
[1:13:02] the promise therefore all the promises
[1:13:05] of the Old Testament was met in Jesus
[1:13:07] Christ it couldn't be met in
[1:13:10] um go to the next one it couldn't be met
[1:13:12] in Moses
[1:13:14] it couldn't be met at any of the
[1:13:16] prophets
[1:13:18] but it could be met in the masterpiece
[1:13:22] because Isaiah had failures
[1:13:26] Moses had failures
[1:13:29] Jeremiah had failures David who he was
[1:13:33] even
[1:13:35] reflected God's heart
[1:13:38] think of that
[1:13:41] but because he had failures God had to
[1:13:46] reject him
[1:13:48] amen
[1:13:51] amen praise the Lord
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:01] um
[1:14:02] go up till we go let's let's go to
[1:14:04] Exodus 20.
[1:14:07] I want to show you
[1:14:09] that
[1:14:16] and sister Mandy you can oh okay you got
[1:14:19] it okay
[1:14:23] praise the Lord
[1:14:29] and verse 18.
[1:14:33] so I want you to see so here's God he's
[1:14:38] reflected in Moses
[1:14:40] they see him in Moses
[1:14:42] God has displayed his mercy and Grace to
[1:14:46] rebellious
[1:14:47] stiff-necked people
[1:14:51] because they were Abraham's seed
[1:14:54] that's the only reason why they came out
[1:14:56] they didn't come out because they were
[1:14:58] good they came out because God can't
[1:15:00] break his promise
[1:15:02] and God had told Abraham back in the
[1:15:04] Book of Genesis I wish we had time to do
[1:15:06] all
[1:15:08] he told him he told him he says Abraham
[1:15:11] know of assurity that your seed your
[1:15:14] promised seed will dwell in a Strange
[1:15:17] Land for 400 years and he said I with a
[1:15:20] mighty hand will bring them up out of
[1:15:23] there and bring them right back here to
[1:15:26] this land that flows with milk and honey
[1:15:29] amen
[1:15:30] God's gonna do that not Moses Moses
[1:15:34] thought he could he thought he was he he
[1:15:37] thought oh I got my doctor's degree I'm
[1:15:40] a great General I've gone down I
[1:15:42] conquered Ethiopia I teach the science I
[1:15:46] know all about science I I teach the
[1:15:48] Egyptians things I teach them all these
[1:15:51] things he said certainly my mommy told
[1:15:53] me the promise of God how I was born and
[1:15:56] how the alligators didn't eat me and how
[1:15:58] I was miraculously brought up in
[1:16:01] pharaohs in the federal government
[1:16:03] brought right up underneath their
[1:16:05] federal law then their law said destroy
[1:16:08] all the male children but God saved you
[1:16:11] Moses you're the deliverer from the time
[1:16:14] he was just a little boy mommy was
[1:16:16] telling him that every day she said I'm
[1:16:18] not she said well let me tell you let me
[1:16:20] tell you Moses You're the One You're the
[1:16:22] One You're The One Moses found out
[1:16:24] he could have knew it
[1:16:27] he thought he could do it but he can't
[1:16:29] and neither can you
[1:16:33] and one day God sent Moses way out into
[1:16:36] the into the desert and he got out there
[1:16:40] Moses out there and he's scratching his
[1:16:42] head for 40 years what did I do wrong
[1:16:46] how'd I end up here he says I thought I
[1:16:49] was the I I mean everything that I can I
[1:16:52] can quote the message to you I can read
[1:16:55] the scriptures I can show you in my life
[1:16:58] that I fulfill this and this and this
[1:17:00] and this and this and this and and I'm
[1:17:03] out here with these sheep
[1:17:08] brother Branham said
[1:17:10] remember what we said it was a thought
[1:17:12] then it had to become the word then it
[1:17:15] had to become manifest
[1:17:18] and one day
[1:17:19] the logos
[1:17:22] the logos showed up
[1:17:25] the logos came down in a pillar of fire
[1:17:28] and Moses said I ain't never seen
[1:17:32] anything like this
[1:17:33] [Music]
[1:17:36] God has a pillar of fire to get every
[1:17:39] one of our attention
[1:17:42] amen it got Moses's attention and Moses
[1:17:46] went up there do you ever think about
[1:17:48] that he went up there to a bush that was
[1:17:49] burning
[1:17:51] and he heard in his mind do you think he
[1:17:53] heard it out here
[1:17:55] take off your shoes Moses you stand on
[1:17:57] Holy Ground
[1:17:59] now he's got to display
[1:18:02] faith
[1:18:04] in order to fulfill the foundation
[1:18:09] are you going to take your shoes off or
[1:18:10] not I think I'll just take off my hat
[1:18:15] God would have never spoke to him
[1:18:18] said take off your shoes
[1:18:20] the land you're standing on is Holy
[1:18:22] Ground
[1:18:23] and then he took Moses right back to the
[1:18:27] word and he said now I have come down
[1:18:31] I the logos I have come down
[1:18:37] but I'm not going to do the work I'm
[1:18:39] sending you
[1:18:43] because people have never seen God they
[1:18:45] don't know how God I mean what do you
[1:18:47] think the pillar of fire we go in right
[1:18:49] before pharaoh
[1:18:50] God doesn't work that way God always has
[1:18:53] a representative he always has a little
[1:18:56] chip off the diamond
[1:18:58] and he he came down and stepped into
[1:19:00] Moses and Moses went down there
[1:19:04] I mean go home and try it go cut
[1:19:06] yourself a stick down all you want and
[1:19:08] pray and fast go on a 40-day fast and
[1:19:11] throw that stick down and see if it'll
[1:19:13] turn into a snake time
[1:19:18] and there's actually no scripture saying
[1:19:20] take a stick and throw it down on the
[1:19:22] ground and it'll turn into a snake
[1:19:24] but that was God's thought then it
[1:19:26] became a word and then when Moses did it
[1:19:28] it became a snake and that's how we know
[1:19:30] it was God's word
[1:19:32] if he said put your hand inside your
[1:19:34] bosom and it'll turn into leprosy and
[1:19:36] he'd have done that and pulled it out
[1:19:37] and it didn't turn into leprosy is a
[1:19:39] lion spirit
[1:19:42] but when he did it turned into that
[1:19:45] and when he put it back in there it came
[1:19:47] back out
[1:19:48] the scripture says it was soft as a
[1:19:51] baby's
[1:19:53] that's what he said
[1:19:57] and Moses went down
[1:20:00] and then Moses fulfilled God's
[1:20:03] Commission
[1:20:05] and you mean the children of Israel
[1:20:06] fought with him every step of the way
[1:20:10] they did they fought they complained
[1:20:13] they're everything else but yet they
[1:20:14] were the they were the children of the
[1:20:16] promise
[1:20:17] and when they got to the base of the
[1:20:19] mountain which was the end of the
[1:20:21] message to Moses
[1:20:23] the message to Moses was I want you to
[1:20:26] go get my people bring him here to this
[1:20:30] mountain and I'm going to come down and
[1:20:33] I'm going to have fellowship with my
[1:20:35] offspring
[1:20:37] and when he got them to the mountain
[1:20:40] that's how we got to uh verse 18.
[1:20:44] and all the people saw the thunderings
[1:20:47] and the Lightnings and the noise of the
[1:20:49] trumpet and the mountain smoking and
[1:20:52] when the people saw it they removed and
[1:20:55] stood afar off and they said unto Moses
[1:20:58] speak thou with us and we will hear but
[1:21:02] let not God speak with us lest we die
[1:21:08] think about it
[1:21:10] The Ten Commandments was not the voice
[1:21:15] of God
[1:21:18] the whole Book of Leviticus is not the
[1:21:22] voice of God
[1:21:24] but when a prophet speaks the word and
[1:21:28] it comes into existence that's God's
[1:21:32] voice
[1:21:34] so what brother Branham said which just
[1:21:36] seems kind of hard to understand but if
[1:21:39] you see it you go
[1:21:40] really
[1:21:42] he said the law
[1:21:44] wasn't part of the the diamond
[1:21:49] he says because the law didn't manifest
[1:21:52] it didn't manifest anything it just told
[1:21:54] you you were a sinner that's all it
[1:21:56] manifested that you were lost there's no
[1:21:58] hope don't even try give it up now
[1:22:00] because you're not going to be able to
[1:22:03] make it you can't memorize your way
[1:22:08] but if God ever speaks to you
[1:22:13] it was so totally change your life
[1:22:18] I remember right back brother Johnson I
[1:22:22] remember when I first got saved
[1:22:24] and I was at work
[1:22:26] brother Johnson knows me after I got
[1:22:28] saved I laughed like a crazy man forever
[1:22:31] and I'm still laughing because my
[1:22:34] burdens rolled away
[1:22:35] anyway and I had one guy
[1:22:39] he was I don't know what he was he made
[1:22:41] fun of me and everything else he said
[1:22:43] what is wrong with you and I said one
[1:22:46] day I found out that Jesus Christ died
[1:22:48] for me and my sins are completely rolled
[1:22:51] away and it made me so happy I can't get
[1:22:54] over it and I can't stop
[1:22:57] the joy of the Lord is our strength amen
[1:23:01] but it can't be your strength if it's
[1:23:04] just a scripture that you've memorized
[1:23:07] because it's just death
[1:23:10] it has to be made manifest it has to go
[1:23:15] from thought to word to manifestation
[1:23:19] amen it's got you
[1:23:23] amen it'll conquer every problem you
[1:23:27] have in your life oh my praise the Lord
[1:23:33] verse 20.
[1:23:35] and Moses said unto the people see even
[1:23:38] Moses tried to convince them they were
[1:23:39] they said No No Moses you speak with us
[1:23:42] and we will hear but let God speak with
[1:23:46] us lest we die Moses said unto the
[1:23:48] people don't fear God for God has come
[1:23:52] down to prove you
[1:24:01] so yes when you get saved it's wonderful
[1:24:04] but if he's come down next to you he's
[1:24:07] going to prove that love he's going to
[1:24:10] prove whether you got it or not
[1:24:12] God came down to prove you and that his
[1:24:16] fear may be before your faces that you
[1:24:19] sin not that's why David said I have hid
[1:24:22] Thy word in my heart that I might not
[1:24:24] sin against thee because the reality of
[1:24:26] God has to be with you every single day
[1:24:31] amen I remember thinking about how that
[1:24:35] you know the children of Israel now here
[1:24:37] they were in Exodus and they saw the
[1:24:39] Thunder and the lightning and the smoke
[1:24:41] and they saw all these things and and
[1:24:43] they had this discussion with Moses it
[1:24:46] doesn't say they discussed it with God
[1:24:47] they discussed it with Moses
[1:24:51] but God held them accountable to that
[1:24:54] because God was in Moses
[1:24:58] he was hid behind the veil
[1:25:01] and they said that and after that
[1:25:05] that's why brother Branham said he said
[1:25:07] the prophets he said it's the prophets
[1:25:10] he says it's not the law
[1:25:12] the law isn't what got them to the
[1:25:15] Masterpiece it was
[1:25:17] every one of these little chips off the
[1:25:19] main diamond
[1:25:20] but these little chips because they're
[1:25:23] little chips they're not the whole
[1:25:26] they're flawed
[1:25:28] Moses had a temper
[1:25:30] amen
[1:25:31] so I have to stop
[1:25:34] amen
[1:25:36] Moses had a temper
[1:25:39] you know the people were always getting
[1:25:41] on his nerves he was getting you know
[1:25:43] okay there there's more than once
[1:25:48] they got they got there you know when
[1:25:50] they came up out of Egypt they're coming
[1:25:51] down there and I always loved this they
[1:25:54] God is very specific brother Brandon
[1:25:56] said that you know he says it'd be a
[1:25:58] very poor General to lead you into a
[1:26:01] trap
[1:26:03] but God does
[1:26:06] God took him right up to the edge of the
[1:26:09] red seed he said there was a city to the
[1:26:10] North and the city to the South and he
[1:26:13] says in the Egyptians behind them so
[1:26:15] that they had nowhere else to go but
[1:26:18] ahead
[1:26:21] everybody we want an easy way out of
[1:26:23] here but I'm going to tell you right now
[1:26:25] we're gonna have to go forward
[1:26:31] and Moses Moses not because of Moses
[1:26:36] because he he talked to God lift the ear
[1:26:39] you ever think about that
[1:26:42] it was because of the people
[1:26:45] that Moses said to God he says God what
[1:26:47] do I do
[1:26:49] if Moses didn't have all the people he'd
[1:26:51] just said okay Lord
[1:26:53] he says you got the ride go forward
[1:26:56] but the people put pressure on Moses
[1:26:59] well he didn't burst that time then they
[1:27:01] put pressure on him when they ran out of
[1:27:03] water they said ah Moses should brought
[1:27:06] us out here there's no water
[1:27:07] and you bring us out here and it's an
[1:27:09] oasis and the water's bitter and he says
[1:27:12] and we can't drink it but yet God had
[1:27:15] already with every trial and Temptation
[1:27:16] maketh a way of Escape right the tree
[1:27:19] was already there
[1:27:21] the tree of life was already there
[1:27:23] he cut the branches off the tree put it
[1:27:25] in the water and made the bitter water
[1:27:27] sweet
[1:27:28] the people were happy
[1:27:30] until they ran out of food then they
[1:27:33] were mad at Moses again
[1:27:35] and they tried him again and Moses got
[1:27:37] you know and they kept doing it and
[1:27:39] doing it and doing it they gave him
[1:27:40] water out of the rock Moses did that too
[1:27:43] but one day they got they pushed him to
[1:27:46] The Living End and he smote The Rock
[1:27:50] and God said
[1:27:55] no as a prophet you cannot magnify
[1:27:59] yourself
[1:28:00] above me
[1:28:03] and the church should never magnify
[1:28:06] themselves above the Living God Amen
[1:28:11] and it cost him
[1:28:13] it cost him
[1:28:15] but you know he did the same thing to
[1:28:18] the masterpiece
[1:28:20] in Matthew
[1:28:22] he took him out into the desert
[1:28:25] the Bible says we're not going to get to
[1:28:27] it but he took him out there the Bible
[1:28:29] says that
[1:28:31] the spirit of God LED Jesus out into the
[1:28:34] desert and he fasted 40 days and 40
[1:28:36] nights and the devil came to him the
[1:28:39] devil looked at him and said you know
[1:28:41] what
[1:28:41] if you're the Son of God no I'm not
[1:28:44] saying you aren't but you could be but
[1:28:46] just in case I could use a little bit of
[1:28:49] proof here
[1:28:50] don't you feel like that when you pray
[1:28:52] devil sits on your shoulder and says
[1:28:54] well you know if you were a real
[1:28:55] believer God will make it come to pass
[1:28:57] go ahead come on
[1:28:59] you have need of this let's do it
[1:29:02] yeah same devil
[1:29:06] in Jesus
[1:29:07] could turn stones into bread
[1:29:10] because he turned two fishes two loaves
[1:29:12] and five fishes and I mean he fed five
[1:29:15] thousand then he fed four thousand he
[1:29:17] could do it
[1:29:19] right but see
[1:29:20] he was tied
[1:29:23] to the Unseen God
[1:29:26] he was an attribute of the Unseen God
[1:29:29] Amen
[1:29:31] amen
[1:29:33] and he took him up on on top of the
[1:29:35] Pinnacle he says cast yourself down he
[1:29:37] says here look I'll even show you where
[1:29:39] the scriptures are says lest you dash
[1:29:41] your foot against the stone his angels
[1:29:43] will pick you right up it's your Bible
[1:29:44] you do believe your Bible don't you
[1:29:46] Jesus you do believe that right
[1:29:51] and then he showed him all the kingdoms
[1:29:53] of the world
[1:29:54] and what was he trying to do he was just
[1:29:56] trying to find a flaw in the masterpiece
[1:30:01] amen
[1:30:04] but there wasn't any amen
[1:30:08] praise the Lord
[1:30:10] amen
[1:30:13] so
[1:30:15] praise God
[1:30:28] we're just gonna have to bow our heads
[1:30:30] let's all Stand Together amen
[1:30:34] amen
[1:30:37] dear Lord Jesus
[1:30:39] we are grateful
[1:30:42] we are grateful for the things that you
[1:30:44] have hidden in your word
[1:30:47] and Lord there's so much
[1:30:49] brother Brandon told us one time he said
[1:30:52] you take that diamond
[1:30:54] and he says and when you turn it in the
[1:30:57] light
[1:30:58] it'll it'll show out as seven colored
[1:31:01] rainbow
[1:31:03] and and when you turn it on one side and
[1:31:05] you see the facet
[1:31:08] you see Abraham you turn it again and
[1:31:10] and you see John the Baptist and you
[1:31:13] turn it again and you see Isaiah
[1:31:17] but lord they're all cut off of that
[1:31:20] main diamond
[1:31:22] Lord Jesus I pray
[1:31:25] I just ask that you just take this
[1:31:27] simple message this little time that
[1:31:28] you've given to us
[1:31:30] may it open our eyes father
[1:31:33] the Lord
[1:31:36] if we were a thought with you before the
[1:31:38] world was ever created
[1:31:42] then we will manifest the word when it's
[1:31:45] presented to us
[1:31:47] heavenly father I pray that
[1:31:50] you'll just let us meditate on these
[1:31:52] things and Lord may you speak to our
[1:31:53] hearts may you make our path straight
[1:31:56] and may you make our past clear to us
[1:31:59] that we can know what you'd have for us
[1:32:01] to do
[1:32:02] Lord whatever it is we just commit Our
[1:32:05] Lives we commit the Saints father into
[1:32:08] your hands for your honor and your glory
[1:32:11] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen
[1:32:14] amen
[1:32:16] praise the Lord
[1:32:22] amen
[1:32:28] I was trying to think what the song is
[1:32:32] nations are breaking
[1:32:35] because that's that's the day of
[1:32:37] redemption is near
[1:32:39] and it gets the name of it but
[1:32:43] God is looking
[1:32:45] for us
[1:32:48] to yield
[1:32:49] to his word
[1:32:51] and let his holy spirit anoint it and
[1:32:54] let it live
[1:32:56] and when it lives then then you have
[1:32:57] confidence
[1:32:59] there's no more doubt after that
[1:33:01] so if he can do this
[1:33:04] let's see if if God if God could do this
[1:33:08] for me then he can take me out amen
[1:33:12] amen
[1:33:16] nations are breaking
[1:33:20] Israel's Awakening the signs at the
[1:33:24] prophets foretold
[1:33:28] the Gentile days number with Horrors in
[1:33:34] Comfort
[1:33:36] eternity soon will
[1:33:39] unfold
[1:33:41] the day of redemption is
[1:33:47] their man's hearts are failing for
[1:33:52] fear
[1:33:54] be filled with the spirit your lamb
[1:33:58] streamed and clear here look up your
