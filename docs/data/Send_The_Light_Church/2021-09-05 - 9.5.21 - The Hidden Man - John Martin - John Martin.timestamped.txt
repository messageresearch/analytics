[37:14] and uh we
[37:16] did a lot of changes that they asked us
[37:18] to do
[37:19] but one change we didn't do and that was
[37:22] the outside wall that's been existing
[37:25] there
[37:25] it was just a little bit too far from
[37:28] the toilet
[37:29] and so we thought you know it would let
[37:32] go i thought it was
[37:33] enough
[37:34] but i missed it
[37:37] and uh so we're
[37:39] we're building adding on to that wall
[37:42] getting it closer

[38:37] what the lord is doing
[38:39] amen let's look to him in a word of
[38:41] prayer before we read his word heavenly
[38:43] father
[38:44] we want to thank you today for grace
[38:49] lord we're all here because of your
[38:50] grace
[38:52] in
[38:53] any facet that we look at it lord
[38:55] whether it's
[38:58] we're alive whether it's
[39:01] our health
[39:03] whether it's the desire to be here lord
[39:06] it's all because of your grace we thank
[39:08] you for grace today
[39:11] lord we pray that
[39:14] you would
[39:16] take our lives at this time
[39:19] and cleanse us and wash us from anything
[39:21] that is unpure that we
[39:25] lower that we not miss anything that you
[39:27] would be speaking to our hearts lord
[39:30] lord did take us out of a carnal mindset
[39:34] and bring us into a spiritual mind to
[39:36] catch your mind catch your thoughts
[39:39] and strengthen us in the inner man lord
[39:42] we commit this service into your hands
[39:44] we commit our our souls into your hands
[39:47] and lord we pray that you would give us
[39:50] now revelation as we look into your
[39:51] precious word
[39:53] and we ask all these things in jesus
[39:55] christ's name amen
[39:57] amen first thessalonians chapter 5 we're
[40:00] just going to read one verse verse 23
[40:02] and the very god of peace sanctify you
[40:05] holy
[40:06] and i pray god your whole spirit
[40:09] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[40:12] unto the coming of our lord jesus christ
[40:15] amen you may be seated
[40:17] may god bless his
[40:20] precious word to our hearts we want to
[40:22] entitle this the hidden man and it's for
[40:24] a subject talk about preserving
[40:26] the inner man
[40:28] amen
[40:30] now we're taught that
[40:32] man is a triune being
[40:35] whether he's a sinner or a saint he has
[40:38] a body
[40:39] he has a spirit
[40:41] and he has a soul
[40:45] when
[40:46] i was a
[40:48] sinner practicing sin
[40:52] i did my own will
[40:55] it doesn't matter what we did we all had
[40:58] our conversations and times fast and the
[41:00] lust of the flesh the bible says
[41:02] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[41:04] of the mind and where by nature
[41:06] the children of wrath even as others
[41:09] it doesn't matter what we did we all had
[41:12] one thing in common
[41:15] we did our own will
[41:19] the reason why
[41:21] we
[41:22] need to become born again is because we
[41:24] have a worldly nature that wants to do
[41:27] its own will it isn't because
[41:29] well we smoke joints and
[41:34] did a lot of bad things
[41:36] those are simply attributes of doing her
[41:38] own will
[41:43] and
[41:44] you know brother branham taught us that
[41:49] back in the day they preached staying
[41:50] out of the movie houses
[41:52] and he says the devil pulled a fast one
[41:54] on us and put the movie house right into
[41:56] our home
[42:01] well we that were so against tvs he
[42:03] pulled a fast one on us and put the
[42:04] computer in her home
[42:08] but i'll say it like this he's pulled a
[42:09] fast one
[42:11] upon the church
[42:13] to get the church to believe that
[42:15] they're okay and sit in church hear the
[42:17] word and still do their own will
[42:21] we need to be born again
[42:25] we didn't think much about our own
[42:27] spirit and our own soul at that time
[42:28] when we were in the world
[42:30] what we mostly thought about was how we
[42:33] looked at the outside of one another we
[42:35] call this the body
[42:37] and even though our focus was on our
[42:38] bodies we really were living by the
[42:41] nature of the spirit that was inside of
[42:44] us
[42:45] the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[42:47] desires of the flesh and of the mind
[42:49] that's really what our drive was
[42:53] whenever we
[42:54] whatever we saw with our eyes it just it
[42:56] opened the door for our wanting
[43:00] whatever we uh
[43:02] touched with our hands and opened the
[43:03] door for wanting whatever we heard
[43:05] whatever music we heard it opened the
[43:07] door for us wanting
[43:10] because we functioned by the nature of
[43:13] the spirit that we were born with we
[43:15] were not taught any of those things
[43:17] that's right that's right
[43:20] everyone was like this
[43:22] we thought it was normal
[43:24] we thought we weren't bad
[43:26] and all we had to do to prove it was to
[43:28] look at somebody who did worse things
[43:30] than us
[43:31] and that was our proof that we weren't
[43:32] bad
[43:35] we never knew that all people were bad
[43:38] right
[43:39] jesus said ross all sinners there wasn't
[43:42] one righteous
[43:44] the one thing that was in common we did
[43:46] our own will amen
[43:48] simply
[43:49] no one was interested in forfeiting
[43:52] their will to do god's
[43:54] when that ever came across our life we
[43:56] just said no thank you
[43:58] weren't interested until one day god
[44:00] sent somebody our way to tell us what it
[44:03] meant to be born again
[44:05] amen
[44:07] what it meant to be born again
[44:09] and if that person spent some time
[44:11] seeking what it really meant
[44:14] that when a man is born again
[44:16] he has been born to do the will of god
[44:20] not just stop doing these things
[44:22] not just start going to a church not
[44:25] just say he's in the message but to stop
[44:27] doing his will and to do the will of god
[44:34] therefore he must live by the will of
[44:35] god in his body and in his spirit and in
[44:39] his soul
[44:41] and when we're in one another's presence
[44:42] we often view one another by the shell
[44:45] by the body you know we think about
[44:47] somebody what they look like and you
[44:49] know maybe how they
[44:50] they they look outwardly yeah we we
[44:53] don't
[44:54] pay attention too much to the spirit
[44:56] unless it's
[44:58] greatly
[44:59] uh extreme right
[45:01] and then we begin to question what was
[45:03] that
[45:10] we're really not
[45:11] bodies that have a in spirit inside of
[45:14] us we're really
[45:16] as it were spirits that live inside of a
[45:18] body
[45:20] and we kind of we need to look at the
[45:22] inside of one another
[45:27] brother branham when he asked this
[45:28] question he said what are you
[45:31] he said you are a soul
[45:34] [Music]
[45:37] so we're not a body
[45:39] we're a soul living inside of a body
[45:41] that's the hidden man this is the man
[45:43] that we should be more concerned about
[45:46] the hidden man or the inner man inside
[45:49] amen
[45:50] i want to talk about this man today and
[45:52] we want to try to encourage this man
[45:55] because we're living in such a sinful
[45:57] world
[45:59] or commanded by jesus to be ready in the
[46:01] very hour that we're living at turn with
[46:03] me if you would to matthew 24.
[46:08] the inner man must take heed to the hour
[46:10] that we're living
[46:12] him matthew 24 i'm going to start with
[46:15] 40 42
[46:17] matthew 24 verse 42 watch therefore for
[46:20] ye know not what our the your lord dot
[46:24] come your lord i like that
[46:28] but know this that if the good man the
[46:30] house had known what watched the thief
[46:32] were to come he would have watched and
[46:34] would not have suffered his house to be
[46:35] broken up
[46:37] therefore be also ready for in such an
[46:40] hour as you don't think
[46:43] the son of man is coming
[46:46] who then is a faithful and a wise
[46:48] servant whom his lord have made and rule
[46:51] over his household to give him meat in
[46:53] due season
[46:55] that's our responsibility
[46:57] to feed the inner man
[47:00] it's our responsibility to feed the
[47:02] inner man
[47:03] it is not the preachers it's true amen
[47:05] we ain't gonna make it by one or two
[47:07] services a week or a month or how often
[47:10] we come we've got to feed the inner man
[47:12] on a daily basis
[47:14] [Music]
[47:16] blessed is that servant whom his lord
[47:18] when he cometh shall find so doing
[47:20] verily i say unto you that he shall make
[47:22] him ruler over his house of good all his
[47:25] goods but if that evil servant shall see
[47:28] in his heart
[47:30] my lord goliath is coming now we're
[47:32] really not even going to say those words
[47:34] but all we're going to do is believe the
[47:36] thought
[47:39] in other words i don't really think he's
[47:41] coming tomorrow so don't worry about it
[47:45] god looks at a person like that as an
[47:46] evil servant
[47:48] and shall begin to smite his fellow
[47:50] servants and to eat and drink with the
[47:52] drunken
[47:54] now i want to take it like this nobody's
[47:56] going to hit one another but i tell you
[47:58] what we are going to do is ignore to
[48:00] wash one another's feet
[48:02] that's the same thing
[48:04] ignore to help somebody
[48:07] and just to eat and drink
[48:10] this is kind of what they did in the
[48:11] days of no one the days of a lot just
[48:14] eating and drinking just going on with
[48:16] life
[48:18] the lord of that servant shall come in a
[48:20] day when he look looketh not for him in
[48:23] an hour that he is not aware of him
[48:27] and shall cut him asunder with and
[48:29] appoint him his portion with the
[48:31] hypocrites
[48:33] this will be weeping and esching of
[48:35] teeth
[48:37] imagine that this person
[48:39] who's not getting ready
[48:41] gets placed right next to the hypocrite
[48:48] they're like
[48:50] twins when it comes to god
[48:52] think about what i'm saying how
[48:54] important it is to recognize the hour
[48:57] we're living in and to get ready for his
[49:00] coming year it's back up to verse 36 now
[49:04] but of that day in that hour it knoweth
[49:06] no man no not even the angels of heaven
[49:10] but my father only
[49:12] but as
[49:13] the days of noah were so shall the
[49:15] coming of the son of man be
[49:17] for as in for as in the days that were
[49:20] before the flood they were eating
[49:22] and drinking
[49:24] and marrying and given into marriage
[49:26] until the day that noah entered into the
[49:28] ark
[49:29] and they knew not until the flood
[49:32] came and took them all away so shall be
[49:35] also
[49:37] the co uh so shall also the coming of
[49:40] the son of man be see the same type of
[49:42] scenario is going on they're just going
[49:44] on with life
[49:48] ignoring the signs of the time yes sir
[49:51] that's right
[49:52] then shall two be now this one i want to
[49:54] get to there shall be two in the field
[49:57] there shall be two in the field and one
[49:59] shall be taken
[50:00] and the other left
[50:03] the two women shall be grinding at the
[50:06] mill and one shall be taken the other
[50:09] left
[50:10] so you've got two outside bodies they
[50:13] look identical
[50:15] they're working
[50:16] going on with life
[50:19] but one is taken one is not because one
[50:22] of the souls
[50:25] was ready to go
[50:28] took heed to what was being said
[50:30] now the outside they still had the work
[50:32] they sort of take still to fix the tires
[50:34] still to paint the house still did what
[50:36] they did but the inside man
[50:39] if that man is ready he's going
[50:47] that's the man we're interested in
[50:52] on the outside both are church goers
[50:56] the believer
[50:57] and the doubter
[51:01] see
[51:02] the doubter believed
[51:04] that god is real
[51:06] that he is god
[51:09] but he didn't believe he was coming soon
[51:11] so there was not a need to spend time
[51:13] getting ready
[51:16] they were working together
[51:19] the believer that believes he could come
[51:21] any minute and believes it so much that
[51:24] he gets ready where the doubter that
[51:26] believes that he could come any moment
[51:29] but doesn't believe it enough to get
[51:32] ready
[51:33] catch that
[51:35] ask anybody you think god could come in
[51:36] oh yeah yeah do you believe it enough to
[51:38] get ready
[51:40] there's the doubter
[51:42] the doubter believes like the devil
[51:43] believes
[51:45] the devil of the devil believes enough
[51:47] to know it's true
[51:48] but not enough to repent and submit
[51:51] [Music]
[51:55] but the believer believes it enough
[51:57] and stays zealous enough to keep
[52:00] submitting to the word as is being
[52:02] preached over the pulpit because it's
[52:04] that word that's getting them ready
[52:06] it's not we're not here to preach the
[52:08] same message we heard 10 20 30 years ago
[52:12] that you know jesus is our savior and if
[52:14] you believe in him you're going to go on
[52:16] the rapture i'm sorry that's not the
[52:19] message we've been hearing all along
[52:21] what god wants us to do to get ready
[52:24] if we miss it it's because we never
[52:27] believed it enough to be serious enough
[52:29] to start doing it that's right amen god
[52:32] is looking for faithfulness if you
[52:34] notice
[52:35] that's the truth
[52:37] that's what we need to do
[52:40] here in this church is be zealous with
[52:43] the word that's being
[52:44] preached submit to it
[52:48] so both outside men do the same thing
[52:51] right
[52:52] you can't tell them apart
[52:55] on the outside
[52:57] but god is looking at the hidden man
[53:01] he's looking at the hidden man
[53:05] as the taste buds of a person's mouth
[53:08] are all different so are the taste buds
[53:10] of the hidden man
[53:12] right we all sit down well go to the
[53:14] restaurant we're all going to order now
[53:15] everybody's going to order somebody
[53:17] different there will be some people that
[53:19] order
[53:20] the things that are like i ordered the
[53:22] good things
[53:26] that are our hidden man
[53:29] they feed just like our taste buds right
[53:32] since everybody's got different taste
[53:34] buds
[53:38] if our hidden man feeds on the same
[53:40] things that the doubters feed upon
[53:44] it will weaken herself
[53:47] when the state of mind of the hidden man
[53:50] is weakened to doubting he's always
[53:52] looking for proof to substantiate his
[53:55] doubts and to justify the way that he's
[53:57] thinking
[54:00] people are always trying to prove how
[54:02] right they are
[54:04] instead of seriously being ready
[54:06] about his coming yes
[54:09] like who cares about how right we are
[54:12] let's care about getting ready that's
[54:14] one thing we should all agree on
[54:18] i don't really care if everybody's
[54:20] greater than me i don't care it just
[54:22] doesn't do anything for me
[54:26] but if i can help somebody get ready
[54:29] oh wow
[54:31] i just love the lord that much
[54:33] that i want to help somebody
[54:41] now if our hidden man feeds on the
[54:43] things of this world we will become full
[54:45] of anxiety and fear
[54:50] and that fear will weaken us it will
[54:51] weaken our faith and weaken the inside
[54:54] of us
[54:56] the hidden man needs to be aware of what
[54:58] the devil is doing and fight
[55:01] with faith
[55:03] in the word of god
[55:05] turn with me if you went to luke chapter
[55:06] 21
[55:11] i don't think there's ever been a time
[55:12] on the planet
[55:14] that there has been so much anxiety
[55:18] fear on the world that there is today
[55:24] we are all hoping that this thing would
[55:26] just come and pass
[55:28] and that we would go on with our life
[55:33] luke 21 verse 25 and there shall be
[55:35] signs in the sun and in the moon and the
[55:37] stars and upon the earth distress
[55:40] of nation
[55:42] distress of nation
[55:44] with perplexity that's uncertainty
[55:47] the seas and the waves roaring tell you
[55:49] there's been lots of hurricanes isn't
[55:51] there
[55:52] distress of nations now what that means
[55:54] is great pain anxiety sorrow acute
[55:58] physical or mental suffering tell me the
[56:01] nations are not feeling that
[56:05] it means affliction in trouble it's a
[56:08] state of extreme necessity or misfortune
[56:13] never a time on the planet as today
[56:18] and look what it's causing verse 26
[56:22] man's hearts are failing them
[56:26] for fear
[56:27] the inner man
[56:29] is failing because of fear
[56:32] why
[56:33] for looking and for looking after those
[56:36] things
[56:38] which are yet to come on the earth
[56:42] that's what's bringing more anxiety and
[56:45] more fear this thing doesn't seem to be
[56:47] passing mutate mutate mutate mutate
[56:53] the bible says for the powers of heaven
[56:56] shall be shaken god is in control
[56:59] regardless
[57:01] regardless he's in control
[57:04] and then shall they say the son
[57:07] eventually they see the son of man come
[57:09] in a cloud with power and great glory
[57:10] and these things
[57:12] when these things shall begin to come to
[57:14] pass then look up
[57:15] that's our job
[57:17] to look up
[57:18] lift up your heads for your redemption
[57:21] draweth nigh
[57:24] i've never witnessed before in any time
[57:27] of my life nor reading history where the
[57:30] whole world has so much pressure as it
[57:33] does today
[57:35] the more that people look after the
[57:37] things which are coming upon the earth
[57:39] the more that their hearts are failing
[57:41] for fear
[57:44] where if they kept their eyes on the
[57:45] word they kept their eyes on the promise
[57:47] they kept their eyes on the message they
[57:50] kept their eyes on jesus
[57:52] god would keep them in perfect peace
[57:55] because their heart is stayed on the
[57:57] lord
[57:58] matthew chapter 10 verse 28
[58:02] matthew chapter 10 verse 28 and fear not
[58:05] them
[58:06] which kill the body that's the outer man
[58:10] but they're not able to kill the soul
[58:11] that's the hidden man
[58:14] but rather fear him
[58:16] you've still got to fear
[58:18] but rather fear him which is able to
[58:21] destroy both soul and body in hell
[58:24] we have to fear we're going to fear
[58:26] you're going to fear wondering that
[58:27] every single person in here is going to
[58:29] fear one or the other
[58:32] i mean i used to fear getting a
[58:35] for my daddy
[58:38] because when he gave me one
[58:39] you know you got one
[58:44] luke chapter 21 verse 34
[58:48] luke 21 34
[58:52] and take heed to yourselves
[58:54] take heed to yourselves
[58:56] lest any time your hearts be overcharged
[58:59] with surfeiting and drunkenness and the
[59:01] cares of this life and so that they come
[59:05] upon you unaware
[59:10] don't get sucked up
[59:12] in such a busy life
[59:15] that you become overcharged
[59:18] overcharged
[59:21] like there's no control
[59:24] right
[59:25] you lose control of your
[59:27] yourself your soul your inner man
[59:31] you may
[59:33] you may be trying to
[59:35] keep control the outer man
[59:39] but anything to do with this outer life
[59:41] it doesn't matter it's going down no
[59:43] matter how much you try to preserve it
[59:48] it's the inner man
[59:50] for as a snare
[59:53] shall it come upon all
[59:55] them that dwell upon the face of the
[59:58] earth
[1:00:00] tell me we're not in the middle of this
[1:00:04] it's a snare no one expected this thing
[1:00:08] and it just keeps going deeper and
[1:00:11] deeper you just see the claws of satan
[1:00:13] digging into humanity
[1:00:16] and trying to bring more confusion more
[1:00:18] destruction more fear he's just feasting
[1:00:23] and bringing fear to the people
[1:00:26] watching therefore and pray always that
[1:00:29] you may be accounted worthy
[1:00:31] to escape all these things
[1:00:34] that shall come to pass and stand before
[1:00:37] the son of man
[1:00:40] jesus said that prayer opens the door to
[1:00:42] escaping all things
[1:00:45] prayer
[1:00:46] so don't cut pear out
[1:00:49] do not cut it out
[1:00:50] start doubling it amen amen that's right
[1:00:55] don't think the devil is going to tell
[1:00:56] you got this don't worry you don't have
[1:00:58] to pray that's a lie
[1:01:01] pray without ceasing
[1:01:03] pray with all perseverance ask seek not
[1:01:06] pray always
[1:01:08] it's true prayer that the hidden man
[1:01:10] doesn't faint
[1:01:11] right they that wait upon the lord they
[1:01:13] shall renew their strength
[1:01:17] now god doesn't want us to fall
[1:01:21] into this trap
[1:01:23] of fear
[1:01:25] now one iota
[1:01:27] fear is of the devil
[1:01:32] now there are two types of fear
[1:01:34] one is reverence and respect to god
[1:01:40] the other
[1:01:41] is to be manipulated into believing
[1:01:44] something frightening or horrifying
[1:01:46] that's the john martin version
[1:01:49] the dictionary tells us
[1:01:51] that fear is a distressing emotion think
[1:01:55] about this think about what the devil's
[1:01:56] doing a distressing emotion around
[1:02:00] aroused
[1:02:01] by impeding danger
[1:02:04] or evil or pain
[1:02:08] every time we get some sort of pain
[1:02:12] we got a cancerous tumor
[1:02:19] every time we look something up
[1:02:21] on google
[1:02:23] it's telling us the worst condition that
[1:02:25] we got
[1:02:28] fear just wants to set in a distressing
[1:02:31] emotion that arises
[1:02:34] when there's danger
[1:02:37] he says now the dictionary says whether
[1:02:39] the threat is real
[1:02:41] or imagined
[1:02:43] it is a feeling or condition of being
[1:02:45] afraid
[1:02:47] god does not want us afraid
[1:02:52] you have no right to be afraid
[1:02:57] to fear the lord is to respect him
[1:03:00] to reverence his word when he gives it
[1:03:02] to you
[1:03:04] and it's by freemore agency that you
[1:03:07] humbly submit to it now that's what the
[1:03:09] fear of the lord is
[1:03:11] we're taught that it's the beginning of
[1:03:14] all wisdom
[1:03:16] now to fear the devil is to show respect
[1:03:19] to what the devil tells us
[1:03:25] oh really
[1:03:26] wow
[1:03:28] that's you fearing the devil
[1:03:33] that's you respecting the devil now can
[1:03:35] you imagine we respect the devil
[1:03:38] we do
[1:03:39] it's true we do
[1:03:42] soon as fear capsizes you
[1:03:46] you're listening to what the devil says
[1:03:48] you're giving audience you're giving
[1:03:50] attention you're given respect as if
[1:03:53] he's got something good to say
[1:03:56] he's a liar i don't care what proof he's
[1:03:59] got he's still a liar
[1:04:01] he always will be a liar
[1:04:04] amen
[1:04:11] to fear the devil is to show respect to
[1:04:14] what the devil tells us and to allow
[1:04:16] ourselves to become manipulated or
[1:04:18] aroused by an impeding
[1:04:21] danger
[1:04:23] he loves shona's danger
[1:04:26] the whole world feeds on news that's bad
[1:04:31] put on any station you want
[1:04:34] hey we got this good thing oh nobody
[1:04:35] wants to hear that go over here to this
[1:04:37] other town and talk about something bad
[1:04:39] that's happening there people want to
[1:04:40] hear about that
[1:04:47] when we show respect
[1:04:49] to what the devil tells us we're lacking
[1:04:52] love for what god says yep is it true
[1:04:59] i'm saying to you when we pay attention
[1:05:03] to what the devil is saying it is the
[1:05:05] beginning of worldly wisdom
[1:05:11] it's where strife confusion all begins
[1:05:14] is when you listen to the devil and it
[1:05:16] is the beginning of worldly wisdom
[1:05:20] and you got to handle everything
[1:05:21] yourself
[1:05:25] don't respect what the devil tells you
[1:05:28] don't listen to what the devil tells you
[1:05:30] well i think it's god he's warning me
[1:05:35] god's telling you to get in his word and
[1:05:37] believe his word that's what he's
[1:05:38] telling you
[1:05:41] we might say as brother marty says we're
[1:05:43] actually insulting god in his ability to
[1:05:46] see us through a situation
[1:05:51] the devil is allowed to talk to us but
[1:05:54] remember we have a choice in if we're
[1:05:56] going to listen or respect what he's got
[1:05:57] to say
[1:06:00] god is not going to take the devil
[1:06:03] but we got to take sides who we're going
[1:06:05] to respect
[1:06:10] we're going to
[1:06:11] listen and respect one or the other
[1:06:15] luke chapter 12 verse 4 luke chapter 12
[1:06:18] verse 4 and i say unto you my friends
[1:06:22] jesus is always talking to his friends
[1:06:25] here
[1:06:25] he said be not afraid of them that kill
[1:06:28] the body
[1:06:30] and after
[1:06:32] have no more that they can do
[1:06:36] nothing don't fear
[1:06:39] he says friend don't fear them
[1:06:43] so i say
[1:06:44] don't listen to that news
[1:06:50] but there's proof my neighbor said this
[1:06:57] don't respect them
[1:07:00] i mean i understand it's good to know
[1:07:04] colvin's out there
[1:07:06] i understand that you know we need to be
[1:07:09] careful
[1:07:11] and that we need to be extremely
[1:07:13] prayerful about what we do
[1:07:15] but there ain't one other person out
[1:07:17] there that you can listen to and they
[1:07:20] tell you exactly all the facts that is
[1:07:22] gospel
[1:07:25] but everybody wants to say what they
[1:07:27] think it is
[1:07:30] i just say
[1:07:32] we know enough
[1:07:33] to be prayerful
[1:07:35] but we need to start putting our
[1:07:37] attention onto god
[1:07:39] god you know the devil wants everybody
[1:07:41] to be prophesying tell when the end of
[1:07:42] the world is and to tell what's going to
[1:07:44] happen before it happens and what day
[1:07:46] it's going to happen but make it clear
[1:07:49] jesus said not even the angels in heaven
[1:07:51] no
[1:07:54] don't figure it out focus on getting
[1:07:57] ready and staying ready on a daily basis
[1:08:01] you know somebody can come to the altar
[1:08:03] and get serious with god three days
[1:08:05] later they even forget what they did
[1:08:07] over here at the altar it's about
[1:08:09] remaining ready day after day service
[1:08:12] after service week after week
[1:08:17] a christian is not what we think it is
[1:08:19] it is what it is
[1:08:23] we need to find that out
[1:08:25] verse 5 but i will
[1:08:28] forewarn you
[1:08:31] whom you shall fear
[1:08:35] he wants you to fear one or the other
[1:08:38] and he's telling us who we need to fear
[1:08:40] fear him
[1:08:41] which is able
[1:08:44] ah which after he have killed
[1:08:47] have power to cast into hell
[1:08:51] yeah i'll say unto you fear him
[1:08:55] and there's only one that can do that
[1:08:57] that's jesus christ he holds the keys of
[1:08:59] hell death and the grave amen
[1:09:02] that's the one we need to fear we need
[1:09:04] to pay attention to what he wants
[1:09:07] yes so take half of your time that you
[1:09:10] spend thinking about the things of this
[1:09:12] world and start spending it i'm thinking
[1:09:15] about this word and what god's trying to
[1:09:17] say to us
[1:09:20] just 50
[1:09:21] let's start with that
[1:09:23] [Music]
[1:09:25] i don't guarantee that your your hearts
[1:09:27] will be in perfect peace at that time i
[1:09:29] don't because that's not scripture the
[1:09:31] scripture says he'll keep the imperfect
[1:09:33] peace whose mind is stayed one hundred
[1:09:35] percent on the lord
[1:09:38] but i'll tell you you can't get there
[1:09:40] you know overnight right
[1:09:42] so start with fifty percent
[1:09:46] still look at that news 100 get 50
[1:09:49] get in that word
[1:09:54] god does not want us to fear or be
[1:09:56] tormented by anything that's happening
[1:09:58] in our lives
[1:10:00] not just around us but in our lives
[1:10:02] god is still in control he's still on
[1:10:04] the throne he's still got the final
[1:10:06] say-so
[1:10:08] everything is working out for our good i
[1:10:11] believe he's going to see the bride
[1:10:14] through all we got to do is trust we are
[1:10:18] the bride amen and then stay with that
[1:10:22] jesus said in luke 12 32 fear not little
[1:10:27] flock
[1:10:29] for
[1:10:30] it is your father's good pleasure to
[1:10:32] give you
[1:10:35] the fullness of the holy ghost
[1:10:37] it's what the kingdom is
[1:10:41] fear
[1:10:42] not i'll tell you if if you've got god
[1:10:46] inside of you you know god is not
[1:10:48] worried about what's going on
[1:10:52] he's not grabbing his archangels and say
[1:10:54] we need to have a meeting here
[1:10:58] he knew all this was going to happen
[1:10:59] before man was ever created
[1:11:04] god is providing a way for his bride
[1:11:08] and it will not be outside of the word
[1:11:12] it won't be in our own thinking and the
[1:11:14] way we figure things out in our special
[1:11:16] place to get the information and what's
[1:11:18] going on in our homes i'm sorry it'll be
[1:11:20] according to his word his word means
[1:11:23] everything to the pride
[1:11:26] that's why when we come to the house of
[1:11:28] god there needs to be such a hunger for
[1:11:31] the living word
[1:11:35] don't fear don't let fear
[1:11:37] in the door of your heart don't let fear
[1:11:41] in the hidden man
[1:11:45] it's allowed to come in
[1:11:49] it's allowed to do that
[1:11:54] but it stops here i'm not opening to it
[1:11:57] i don't care what the devil says i don't
[1:11:59] care what anybody's going to say about
[1:12:00] me i don't care
[1:12:03] i'm going to be like jonah
[1:12:05] i'm not going to sit there no matter how
[1:12:08] real it is
[1:12:09] and observe live vanities
[1:12:13] i don't want to forsake my own mercies
[1:12:18] god's going to keep us amen
[1:12:23] sometimes we can become so carnal that
[1:12:26] we miss
[1:12:28] the hidden man
[1:12:31] not paying attention to the inside
[1:12:34] the devil can get us so caught up on
[1:12:36] external things that we don't even think
[1:12:39] about the inside
[1:12:42] because the devil we've we've taken that
[1:12:44] lure
[1:12:46] that uh
[1:12:47] laodicea lukewarm
[1:12:50] lure
[1:12:52] that says
[1:12:54] you're okay because
[1:12:58] you're okay because well if you're okay
[1:13:00] because then what do we need to be doing
[1:13:02] anything else for
[1:13:06] the only way that we're okay is by the
[1:13:09] grace of god that's the only way we
[1:13:11] could be okay
[1:13:13] but i still have to fear the lord
[1:13:18] i still have to respect his word i still
[1:13:20] have to be zealous and repent and get
[1:13:24] prepared and stay prepared and keep
[1:13:27] praying and praying and seeking more of
[1:13:30] the holy ghost
[1:13:32] that's what it means to fear the lord
[1:13:37] if we're not careful we can bite and
[1:13:39] devour one another
[1:13:41] we can fight for our reputation
[1:13:43] who's the greatest among us
[1:13:46] and i'm better because of this
[1:13:49] we can allow envying and strife and
[1:13:51] divisions and paul said are ye not
[1:13:55] carnal
[1:13:57] not thinking about the inner man just
[1:14:00] worried about the outside man
[1:14:02] are you not carnal and walk as men
[1:14:10] when we don't get what we want
[1:14:13] it's easy to distrust the lord
[1:14:17] it's easy to lose your trust in god when
[1:14:20] you don't get what you want
[1:14:24] and fear opens the door
[1:14:26] to be carnal and try to manipulate
[1:14:28] situations and manipulate people and and
[1:14:31] manipulate so you can control and get
[1:14:34] what you want
[1:14:39] but our hidden man needs to trust the
[1:14:41] lord
[1:14:43] when our outer men don't get what it
[1:14:45] wants
[1:14:47] turn with me the first peter chapter 3
[1:14:49] do not open the door to fear
[1:14:53] first peter chapter 3
[1:14:55] verse 1.
[1:14:57] now likewise your wife's i just want to
[1:14:59] say this is for all the men here
[1:15:03] because i want you to think spiritually
[1:15:05] likewise you wise be subject to your own
[1:15:08] husband men who is your husband christ
[1:15:11] church who is your husband jesus christ
[1:15:14] just go with me with this
[1:15:16] and if any
[1:15:17] obey not the word they also may without
[1:15:19] the word be won by the conversation of
[1:15:23] the wives
[1:15:26] we don't have to preach
[1:15:28] to win a soul
[1:15:30] we don't have to preach to be an
[1:15:32] influence
[1:15:36] it's the hidden man that does all the
[1:15:38] work
[1:15:39] the flesh is out of the picture
[1:15:42] verse 2
[1:15:43] while they behold your chaste behavior
[1:15:49] coupled with
[1:15:51] fear
[1:15:53] not the fear of the world right right
[1:15:56] not what's
[1:15:58] oh
[1:16:00] not that
[1:16:01] but
[1:16:03] i
[1:16:03] trust him
[1:16:10] they behold that
[1:16:12] they behold that
[1:16:16] i could be wrong
[1:16:17] about the way that i see things
[1:16:21] the will of god be done
[1:16:24] oh glory to god i know that he's going
[1:16:27] to see us through
[1:16:28] god has never failed us one time his
[1:16:31] word is true he's never lied his
[1:16:33] promises are yea and amen and that's
[1:16:36] what the bride's
[1:16:38] behavior should be her conversation
[1:16:41] should be amen
[1:16:45] who's adorning
[1:16:47] let it not be
[1:16:50] the outward man
[1:16:54] the adorning of the plane the hair and
[1:16:55] the wearing of gold and the putting on
[1:16:57] of apparel notice
[1:16:59] it's not about your outside it's not
[1:17:02] about
[1:17:03] you
[1:17:04] making this thing of how
[1:17:06] great you are
[1:17:09] not just dressing or putting your hair
[1:17:12] in such a way of how great you are
[1:17:14] but it's the inner man
[1:17:17] it's the inner man that in any moment
[1:17:21] time is displaying her trust in
[1:17:29] it god doesn't matter the outside
[1:17:32] doesn't matter
[1:17:34] the quicker we can lose our reputation
[1:17:36] the closer you're going to get to god
[1:17:39] jesus made himself of no reputation if
[1:17:42] he didn't who are we to
[1:17:47] who are we to even care about it
[1:17:55] so forget about oh look at me
[1:17:58] listen to what i got to say
[1:18:00] what i have to say is more important
[1:18:02] than you
[1:18:09] we get stuck in that that's true right
[1:18:12] the outside man
[1:18:13] what about the inner man
[1:18:15] what about being able to go through a
[1:18:17] test or a trial to have somebody slap
[1:18:20] you on the face and you just stand there
[1:18:22] turn the other cheek
[1:18:24] what about that
[1:18:28] that's the inner man
[1:18:31] that's what attracts people
[1:18:36] my wisdom don't attract people
[1:18:39] my knowledge don't attract people
[1:18:43] my abilities don't attract people
[1:18:47] i'm talking about to give their hearts
[1:18:50] to jesus christ
[1:18:53] carnal attracts carnal flesh attracts
[1:18:55] flesh
[1:18:57] but it takes the spiritual
[1:18:59] that attracts the spiritual
[1:19:02] and i'm saying spiritual i mean in
[1:19:04] christ
[1:19:05] amen
[1:19:06] but let it be the hidden man of the
[1:19:08] heart i love that verse four here we are
[1:19:11] saints but let it be the hidden man of
[1:19:13] the heart
[1:19:14] in that which is not corruptable
[1:19:18] even the ornament of a meek and quiet
[1:19:21] spirit
[1:19:23] which is in the sight of god of great
[1:19:26] price
[1:19:29] out of our hearts
[1:19:30] hangs a spirit
[1:19:34] it's like an ornament like you would put
[1:19:35] on a christmas tree an ornament it hangs
[1:19:39] there
[1:19:40] and
[1:19:41] your spirit
[1:19:43] is hanging there
[1:19:46] but sometimes it's just
[1:19:48] loud it wants to be first it wants to
[1:19:52] it wants to be carnal
[1:19:54] true that's right
[1:19:56] and i'm telling you that ornament
[1:19:58] is either shining a light
[1:20:01] that i trust him
[1:20:03] or shining a darkness that i'm afraid
[1:20:07] and i'm respecting what the devil has
[1:20:09] got to say to me
[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:14] and because i fear this this is what i
[1:20:16] think we should do
[1:20:18] because obviously i just don't feel
[1:20:20] god's got control right now
[1:20:25] it's the hidden man of the heart
[1:20:27] we need to make sure that our spirit is
[1:20:30] christlike
[1:20:32] that what's coming out of us is
[1:20:34] christ-light
[1:20:35] it's mild it's gentle
[1:20:38] it's humble
[1:20:40] that's the ornament that we need to have
[1:20:44] jesus said learn of me he wasn't just
[1:20:46] talking to the women
[1:20:49] learning me from me
[1:20:52] i'm humble unlowly
[1:20:54] and he dwells with the same
[1:20:59] for after
[1:21:00] this manner
[1:21:02] in the old time
[1:21:04] the holy women also notice
[1:21:07] who trusted in god
[1:21:10] they feared god they didn't fear what
[1:21:12] was happening
[1:21:14] they trusted god they adorned themselves
[1:21:17] being in subjection onto their own
[1:21:20] husband
[1:21:27] no doubt
[1:21:28] if we can't be subject to our husband we
[1:21:30] can't be subject to god
[1:21:35] but a woman we've been taught
[1:21:37] in the bible always represents the
[1:21:39] church
[1:21:42] now church we need to trust our heavenly
[1:21:45] father
[1:21:46] and you do that by being subject to the
[1:21:49] word
[1:21:50] fearing the word that's being preached
[1:21:52] to you
[1:21:53] reverencing listening to it wanting to
[1:21:56] hear too no
[1:21:57] not the way i see things
[1:22:07] don't deviate from it believe it obey it
[1:22:12] start following it mourn
[1:22:15] hold on every word
[1:22:17] you song hold to god's unchanging hand
[1:22:20] that's his word
[1:22:22] that's how you hang on to god you hang
[1:22:24] on his word
[1:22:26] come to church to hear from god amen not
[1:22:29] to hear what you what brother john's got
[1:22:32] to say about god
[1:22:34] it's not a denomination
[1:22:39] the word
[1:22:40] the word brother man said the pastor's
[1:22:43] ordained lead g3 i'm going to say this
[1:22:45] the word is ordained to see you through
[1:22:48] it's the word
[1:22:52] it needs to be our life
[1:22:54] we need to fear that word reverence that
[1:22:57] word god's speaking to me to fear him
[1:23:00] today to reverence him today to not
[1:23:03] listen anymore to what the devil is
[1:23:06] saying amen
[1:23:09] amen because you can't go in both
[1:23:10] directions you can't serve both
[1:23:14] even
[1:23:16] as sarah obeyed abraham
[1:23:19] calling him lord
[1:23:20] whose daughters ye are
[1:23:24] and i said there's a period there
[1:23:27] but there's not there's a comma
[1:23:29] as long as you do well
[1:23:32] and are not afraid
[1:23:36] with any amazement
[1:23:38] think about that
[1:23:40] the big
[1:23:41] two
[1:23:44] letters ah
[1:23:45] as long as you do well and not afraid
[1:23:49] with any amazement
[1:23:52] can you imagine
[1:23:54] sarah
[1:23:57] for 25 years
[1:24:00] beating up abraham
[1:24:04] say if god was really with you we would
[1:24:06] have had a baby
[1:24:07] a long time ago
[1:24:11] she couldn't explain it no more than he
[1:24:13] could
[1:24:16] but she trusted
[1:24:19] she trusted
[1:24:21] church we have to trust we're children
[1:24:23] of abraham
[1:24:25] we are the sarah to our uh to our
[1:24:30] father in the faith jesus christ
[1:24:39] trust him amen
[1:24:44] god doesn't want us to be wishy-washy
[1:24:47] fear the lord and you'll prosper in god
[1:24:51] don't allow impeding danger evil or pain
[1:24:55] to distress you amen it's true don't
[1:24:59] allow the news to arouse your emotions
[1:25:02] whether they're a threat or real
[1:25:04] or imagined
[1:25:07] don't allow your feelings
[1:25:10] to stay afraid
[1:25:13] take
[1:25:15] your eyes off of jesus or take your eyes
[1:25:17] off the devil and put them on jesus look
[1:25:19] to the author look to the finisher of
[1:25:21] your faith
[1:25:23] that's her job
[1:25:25] verse 7 likewise your husbands dwell
[1:25:26] with them according to knowledge giving
[1:25:28] honor unto the wife is unto the weaker
[1:25:30] vessel
[1:25:31] and as being heirs together the grace of
[1:25:34] life that your prayers be not hindered
[1:25:37] if you ever feel brothers that your
[1:25:40] your prayers are being hindered i say
[1:25:41] this honor your wife more
[1:25:44] come on i want to hear an amen
[1:25:48] it's a truth amen
[1:25:52] god wants us
[1:25:55] to honor our wives
[1:25:58] i'll say like this more than we do
[1:26:02] live and dwell with them according to
[1:26:04] more wisdom and more knowledge i believe
[1:26:08] that
[1:26:10] jesus christ honors his wife
[1:26:16] he honors us
[1:26:19] he would not withhold any good thing
[1:26:22] amen
[1:26:25] his promises are in amen he honors her
[1:26:28] he said with
[1:26:29] life
[1:26:33] with mercy his mercies are new every day
[1:26:37] we need to honor our wives
[1:26:40] as christ honors his wife amen amen
[1:26:44] now we're in a battle
[1:26:47] fear and faith a raging war one against
[1:26:49] another
[1:26:51] we're in the greatest man of our fault
[1:26:54] we've learned that we need to
[1:26:57] invert our thinking invert always invert
[1:27:01] think differently about what's happening
[1:27:03] in the battle
[1:27:05] that it's really all this thing's
[1:27:07] working out for our good
[1:27:12] now we're going to be in this battle
[1:27:15] till we get out of here
[1:27:17] bottom line is we need to overcome the
[1:27:20] battle
[1:27:21] because that's where we get the
[1:27:23] character
[1:27:25] and it is god's business if he wants to
[1:27:28] see
[1:27:28] character we're going to need character
[1:27:30] if we're going to reign with him that's
[1:27:32] all there is to it well i'm not
[1:27:33] interested in that brother john i just
[1:27:35] want to make sure that i'm saved that
[1:27:37] i'm there
[1:27:44] we got to be fit to rule
[1:27:46] if i can't rule my soul
[1:27:50] if i can't rule my home
[1:27:53] if i can't help my brother and sister
[1:27:56] and wash their feet
[1:27:58] how am i going to be fit to rule
[1:28:02] with him
[1:28:05] well somehow he just you know
[1:28:07] i don't believe in magic
[1:28:09] character comes as a gift
[1:28:12] i believe right here when we're going
[1:28:14] through the battle is what we prove what
[1:28:16] we have
[1:28:20] now faith fights fear
[1:28:26] fear fights faith
[1:28:29] and the devil is using this world to
[1:28:33] fight our faith
[1:28:36] we're not getting away from this battle
[1:28:39] and one of these is going to win
[1:28:41] every human being
[1:28:43] first thessalonians chapter 6 no first
[1:28:46] timothy chapter 6 verse 9.
[1:28:51] first timothy chapter 6 verse 9 you know
[1:28:52] when i say that i expect you know pages
[1:28:55] just start flipping and there's like
[1:28:57] dead quiet i'm thinking did i miss
[1:28:58] something
[1:29:01] but they that be will be rich they that
[1:29:04] will be rich
[1:29:06] in other words they're not rich
[1:29:09] but they want to be rich
[1:29:12] fall into
[1:29:13] temptation
[1:29:14] and a snare
[1:29:16] and into many
[1:29:18] foolish
[1:29:19] and hurtful
[1:29:21] desires
[1:29:23] and what happens to them which drown men
[1:29:27] in
[1:29:28] destruction
[1:29:29] and perdition now i'm telling you this
[1:29:32] is the inner man
[1:29:34] in other words the outer man can be so
[1:29:36] full of want and work so hard for for
[1:29:40] the outside that the inner man just
[1:29:44] this doesn't exist
[1:29:46] no joy no pull no desire no i can't wait
[1:29:50] to get the church it says i can't wait
[1:29:51] to church is over amen
[1:29:56] for the love of money
[1:29:59] it's the very thing that you don't see
[1:30:03] right it's the root of all evil you
[1:30:04] don't even see it it's not out here
[1:30:08] because it's in the root
[1:30:11] for the level of money is the root of
[1:30:13] all evil
[1:30:16] which while some covet after
[1:30:19] they have aired
[1:30:21] what they air from the faith
[1:30:26] they've erred from the faith
[1:30:28] and pierced themselves through
[1:30:31] not with a little bitty thing but with
[1:30:33] many
[1:30:34] sorrows
[1:30:36] yes sir because my want is never
[1:30:39] satisfied
[1:30:41] amen
[1:30:42] i got a million i want two if i got two
[1:30:44] i want three
[1:30:45] i got three i want five hey let's not
[1:30:48] why don't we just go for ten
[1:30:50] right it just doesn't stop it's never
[1:30:53] satisfied with seeing never satisfied
[1:30:55] with hearing it's just not satisfied you
[1:30:58] can't satisfy this thing
[1:31:04] amen
[1:31:05] lucifer who is the cream of the crop of
[1:31:11] lust
[1:31:12] yes
[1:31:13] and getting what he wants
[1:31:15] has power over everything except god
[1:31:18] and he's still not satisfied
[1:31:21] amen
[1:31:22] and he's trying to get us
[1:31:24] to get just a little bit more
[1:31:27] and after i get this it'll be it i'll be
[1:31:29] satisfied
[1:31:37] but thou o man of god
[1:31:42] flee these things
[1:31:45] don't get your don't get a taste of it
[1:31:47] flee it
[1:31:49] and follow after righteousness
[1:31:52] godliness
[1:31:54] faith love
[1:31:56] patience
[1:31:57] okay so i don't get to this
[1:31:59] jesus said impatience possess ye your
[1:32:02] soul you take possession of that inner
[1:32:04] man amen through patience
[1:32:09] meekness
[1:32:10] fight the good fight of faith
[1:32:12] lay hold on eternal life wherein to thou
[1:32:15] call it and have professed a great
[1:32:17] possession profession
[1:32:19] before many witnesses
[1:32:22] so i don't know what it means to you but
[1:32:25] too many people think they've won the
[1:32:27] fight
[1:32:30] no need to fight for anything more than
[1:32:32] what they got
[1:32:34] and their faith is dwindling it's
[1:32:36] shrinking
[1:32:38] because they stopped fighting
[1:32:42] church we've been called to this battle
[1:32:46] put on the whole armor of god
[1:32:48] stand there
[1:32:49] pray with all perseverance
[1:32:52] and fight the good fight of faith
[1:32:56] we should have i'll just say it like
[1:32:57] this
[1:32:58] john martin you should have more what
[1:33:00] than what you possess right now
[1:33:04] with that being said causes me to fight
[1:33:07] i say church you should have more than
[1:33:09] what you have right now and that should
[1:33:11] cause you to fight
[1:33:15] laodicean says you're in need of nothing
[1:33:17] let's just feel good before we leave
[1:33:22] saddle in lukewarmness
[1:33:34] every place that the soul of your feet
[1:33:37] shall tread upon shall be yours
[1:33:39] if you fight
[1:33:42] but if you feel god's going to bring it
[1:33:43] to you on a silver platter
[1:33:46] he's not going to do that
[1:33:48] character is not a gift
[1:33:51] you want the character of jesus christ
[1:33:53] go after it
[1:33:55] you're satisfied with just the outward
[1:33:57] adorning
[1:33:59] looking
[1:34:01] right
[1:34:02] a form of godliness but denying the
[1:34:05] power of the holy ghost on the inside
[1:34:11] joshua chapter 1 verse 7 only be thou
[1:34:14] strong and very courageous
[1:34:17] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:34:20] to
[1:34:21] say the next word with me
[1:34:23] ah
[1:34:26] the law
[1:34:27] which moses my servant commanded thee
[1:34:30] turn
[1:34:31] not from
[1:34:32] it
[1:34:34] to the right hand or to the left that
[1:34:37] thou mayest deserve
[1:34:38] that thou mayest prosper
[1:34:41] whether so ever thou
[1:34:43] goest so if you're going to go to the
[1:34:45] left you're going to go to the right do
[1:34:47] all the word
[1:34:49] keep all the law
[1:34:50] keep this message in your heart keep
[1:34:52] this word hidden in your heart keep it
[1:34:54] with you
[1:34:56] not just well the main thing you know
[1:34:58] jesus died for my sins
[1:35:03] if that's it
[1:35:04] we're beyond that you need to hear the
[1:35:06] message that god sent in malachi 4 5.
[1:35:16] god has more for us
[1:35:18] verse 8 this book of the law shall not
[1:35:21] depart out of your mouth
[1:35:23] but
[1:35:24] you shall meditate
[1:35:26] therein
[1:35:28] day
[1:35:30] and night
[1:35:33] if you've ever been come to the church
[1:35:35] when brother stands there you will not
[1:35:37] come there without hearing him listen to
[1:35:39] a message
[1:35:43] and his testimony to me yesterday was i
[1:35:45] just feel so much better since i've been
[1:35:48] listening to the prophet not the things
[1:35:49] of the world
[1:35:51] not the news of the world that's what he
[1:35:52] said that's what his testimony was
[1:35:55] i'm not making it up he'll tell you the
[1:35:57] same thing
[1:35:59] gotta meditate there in day and night
[1:36:01] find a way to do it
[1:36:03] that thou mayest observed now here's the
[1:36:06] reason
[1:36:07] that you may carry out
[1:36:09] all
[1:36:10] that is written therein
[1:36:13] for them thou
[1:36:15] shall make thy way prosperous
[1:36:18] and then now shall have good success
[1:36:23] have not had commanded you
[1:36:26] be strong be of good courage be not
[1:36:28] afraid neither be thou dismayed for the
[1:36:31] lord thy god is with you whithersoever
[1:36:33] thou goest it doesn't matter what's
[1:36:35] happening in the world i'm not going to
[1:36:37] fear what man shall do unto me
[1:36:41] not going to do it
[1:36:43] jude chapter 1 verse 18 time is slipping
[1:36:46] how
[1:36:47] that they told you that there should be
[1:36:49] mockers in the last day
[1:36:52] who shall walk
[1:36:54] after their own
[1:36:56] desires
[1:36:58] their first nature
[1:37:05] these be they who separate themselves
[1:37:09] central having not the spirit
[1:37:12] remember john said they left us
[1:37:15] because they were not of us
[1:37:19] bind us together lord bind us together
[1:37:25] the devil will love nothing to do than
[1:37:27] to separate you from the body
[1:37:31] but ye beloved building up yourselves on
[1:37:35] the most holy faith praying in the holy
[1:37:38] ghost
[1:37:41] that's what we need for this battle
[1:37:43] is to build ourselves up in the most
[1:37:46] holy faith
[1:37:48] now i'll tell you when i was building
[1:37:50] yesterday with brother stan
[1:37:54] and the day before
[1:37:57] we were sweating
[1:38:04] and it was hard
[1:38:07] we didn't come in there
[1:38:09] into the church and sit down
[1:38:12] and say
[1:38:16] build my faith
[1:38:19] i want my faith increased
[1:38:24] if you're going to build something
[1:38:26] you got to work
[1:38:30] now what you usually got to work at
[1:38:32] is getting rid
[1:38:34] of all the carnality all the doubt all
[1:38:37] of your worldly nature because they
[1:38:39] can't coexist
[1:38:41] effectively
[1:38:43] effectively
[1:38:50] there's going to be people who mock you
[1:38:52] who walk after their first nature
[1:38:54] who don't have the spirit and they want
[1:38:56] to separate themselves but i'll say it

[1:39:44] house during the day and tell you what
[1:39:46] to do with your time
[1:39:48] all i know is if you feed on the outer
[1:39:51] man
[1:39:53] you're going to get discouraged
[1:39:56] and you're going to expect somebody else
[1:39:58] to do all the work to pick you up

[1:41:24] this company a trusted tool and
[1:41:27] you know i had to stay busy over there
[1:41:28] and you know

[1:41:33] seemed like uh
[1:41:35] when it rains it pours my son went on
[1:41:37] vacation
[1:41:38] which he doesn't get the vacation very
[1:41:41] much and so i was really happy about
[1:41:43] that and it seemed like things were in
[1:41:44] order and not much time would be needed
[1:41:46] for me at the shop
[1:41:48] but little did i know
[1:41:50] uh we had
[1:41:52] kind of like an emergency coming from
[1:41:53] our customer
[1:41:55] and here we are we don't have all the
[1:41:57] cad we don't know if we got all the
[1:41:59] material have to find ways to get it

[1:42:12] excuse

[1:42:32] out of the fire hating even the garment
[1:42:34] spotted by the flesh let me ask you a
[1:42:36] question how many hates

[1:42:55] red
[1:43:00] i tell you when we do something
[1:43:03] that's not right
[1:43:06] we've got to hate it so much
[1:43:08] that we go get clean under the blood and
[1:43:10] get it behind us
[1:43:12] amen that's right stay in love with god
[1:43:15] stay building
[1:43:16] keep building your faith
[1:43:19] faith fights fear
[1:43:22] when timothy was pondering the
[1:43:24] difficulties of being a real christian
[1:43:27] he began to
[1:43:29] question
[1:43:31] and there was a war raging inside of him
[1:43:35] timothy was witnessing paul when he was
[1:43:37] in a dark damp prison
[1:43:40] and he thought man i don't know if i
[1:43:43] really want to do this this to me
[1:43:45] doesn't seem like christianity
[1:43:49] in second timothy chapter 1 verse 5
[1:43:57] this is the time that
[1:43:58] paul wrote what they think was his last
[1:44:01] epistle that he ever wrote and he's
[1:44:03] writing it to timothy before his death
[1:44:06] he's trying to get timothy to stir up
[1:44:09] his faith
[1:44:10] because we have control here to stir our
[1:44:12] own faith up it's not the preacher
[1:44:15] i mean the preacher can preach i'm
[1:44:17] telling you we've had some preachers
[1:44:18] here to me what i thought preached a
[1:44:19] perfect message like
[1:44:21] whoa can anything be preached anything
[1:44:23] greater or better than that i don't know
[1:44:25] how many times i've thought that when a
[1:44:27] minister has come
[1:44:29] but that in itself
[1:44:31] is not going to profit me
[1:44:33] unless
[1:44:34] i believe it
[1:44:38] remember the word preached them did not
[1:44:39] profit them not being mixed with faith
[1:44:41] i've got to stir my faith and this is
[1:44:43] what paul was doing from his prison he's
[1:44:46] got he's trying to help timothy you've
[1:44:47] got to break through this carnality of
[1:44:50] just wanting to stay in a lukewarm
[1:44:52] position in a position of of comfort
[1:44:57] second timothy chapter one verse five
[1:44:59] when i call to remembrance look what he
[1:45:01] does the un he starts talking about the
[1:45:04] unfeigned faith that is in thee which
[1:45:07] dwelt first in my grandmother laws
[1:45:10] and thy mother eunice and i'm persuaded
[1:45:13] that it's in you also
[1:45:16] he didn't he wasn't thinking that
[1:45:20] he was thinking you know what
[1:45:22] this affliction stuff isn't for me
[1:45:24] i think i'm just going to take it easy
[1:45:27] he says worthwhile put you in
[1:45:28] remembrance that thou stir up the gift
[1:45:31] of god which is in thee by the putting
[1:45:33] of on of my hands
[1:45:35] for god has not given us the spirit of
[1:45:37] fear
[1:45:39] but a power and of love and of a sound
[1:45:40] mind
[1:45:44] that stuff that you feel when you listen
[1:45:47] to a bad report
[1:45:49] remember this it doesn't come from god
[1:45:53] shut the door and get your mind on
[1:45:55] something else
[1:45:58] if you keep the door open fear is going
[1:46:01] to come in
[1:46:02] whether it's true whether it's imaginary
[1:46:04] it don't matter at this point what
[1:46:06] matters is a manipulated fear from the
[1:46:08] devil
[1:46:12] he said be not thou therefore ashamed of
[1:46:14] the testimony of the lord nor me and
[1:46:16] prisoner but be thou a partaker of the
[1:46:18] afflictions of the gospel according to
[1:46:20] the power of god so here was
[1:46:22] this wasn't even the bad news of the
[1:46:25] world this is the bad news that you're
[1:46:27] gonna you're gonna suffer afflictions if
[1:46:29] you take a stand for the gospel
[1:46:33] and it was bothering him
[1:46:37] he didn't want to partake of that he
[1:46:40] wanted to be in some administration
[1:46:42] position
[1:46:45] you know tell the other apostles to get
[1:46:47] out there and do the dirty work
[1:46:54] paul said all that live godly in christ
[1:46:56] jesus they're going to suffer this
[1:46:59] it don't matter if you're on the front
[1:47:00] line or the back line
[1:47:02] if you're going to live godly somewhere
[1:47:04] you're going to suffer for because the
[1:47:06] devil don't like you living godly
[1:47:10] weren't you i am appointed a preacher an
[1:47:13] apostle and a teacher of the gentiles
[1:47:16] now you may not be a preacher an apostle
[1:47:17] and a teacher
[1:47:19] but you can be a lot of things for
[1:47:21] christ
[1:47:22] you can be a lot of things for christ
[1:47:25] for the which cause
[1:47:28] you're going to suffer things
[1:47:30] i also suffer these things nevertheless
[1:47:33] i'm not ashamed i'm not ashamed of it
[1:47:36] for i know
[1:47:37] whom i have believed
[1:47:40] and then persuaded that he is able to
[1:47:42] keep that which i've committed unto him
[1:47:44] against that day now what did he commit
[1:47:46] unto him
[1:47:47] the inner man his soul
[1:47:50] he committed his soul to him
[1:47:52] the body
[1:47:54] hey
[1:47:55] if i'm going to suffer if i'm going to
[1:47:56] get mocked if i'm going to get made fun
[1:47:58] of
[1:47:59] it doesn't matter
[1:48:01] he's able to keep my soul amen
[1:48:05] against that day hold fast
[1:48:07] the form of sound words
[1:48:10] which thou has heard
[1:48:12] from
[1:48:14] the bible
[1:48:16] in faith
[1:48:17] and in and love which is in christ jesus
[1:48:21] hold
[1:48:22] fast the form of sound worth can you do
[1:48:25] that
[1:48:26] i wonder if we've let things slip
[1:48:30] like oh it's not a big deal
[1:48:32] or if you would have held on to it maybe
[1:48:34] we would have a victory over the devil
[1:48:39] even the holy ghost was telling paul and
[1:48:42] bearing witness that bonds and
[1:48:43] afflictions were going to abide with him
[1:48:45] in acts chapter 20 verse 24 you don't
[1:48:48] have to turn there but none of these
[1:48:50] things move me
[1:48:52] neither count i my life dear unto myself
[1:48:55] so that i might finish my course
[1:48:58] with joy
[1:49:00] and the ministry which i have received
[1:49:02] to the lord to testify the gospel of the
[1:49:05] grace of god
[1:49:06] now you all got a ministry
[1:49:09] you all have a ministry
[1:49:11] how's your ministry going
[1:49:14] tell me how is it affecting
[1:49:17] the people
[1:49:19] do bonds
[1:49:21] and afflictions
[1:49:23] are they with you
[1:49:26] are you being moved
[1:49:29] uh are you kind of shying away because
[1:49:31] your life is dear to you
[1:49:34] why wasn't paul moved because the inside
[1:49:38] man was full of god and god can't be
[1:49:40] moved
[1:49:43] colossians chapter 3 verse 1 if
[1:49:46] you then be risen with christ how many
[1:49:49] is risen with christ
[1:49:52] okay homie's not risen with christ
[1:49:56] how many is in switzerland you don't
[1:49:58] think you have to vote

[1:50:04] those things which are above
[1:50:06] where christ sitteth on the right hand
[1:50:09] of god
[1:50:13] seek
[1:50:17] it may start with playing the tape it
[1:50:18] may start with reading the bible it may
[1:50:20] start on your knees
[1:50:22] but you've got to seek the lord
[1:50:24] amen
[1:50:25] that's what christians do set your
[1:50:27] affections
[1:50:28] on things above
[1:50:30] and not on things on the earth now
[1:50:32] there's good instructions for us in this
[1:50:34] hour when fear is just
[1:50:37] just multiplying
[1:50:39] seems by the week by the day
[1:50:42] in the world
[1:50:45] for you are dead and your life is hid
[1:50:48] with christ in god and i want to say
[1:50:50] this the only way
[1:50:52] you're going to get your life more hid
[1:50:54] with christ is to become more dead
[1:50:59] when christ who is our life shall appear
[1:51:01] then shall you also appear with him in
[1:51:03] glory look at here's the instructions
[1:51:06] how to get hid mortified therefore the
[1:51:08] members which are upon the earth
[1:51:10] fornication
[1:51:11] uncleanness
[1:51:12] inordinate affection evil concupiscence
[1:51:16] and covetedness which is idolatry for
[1:51:19] which things sake the wrath of god
[1:51:21] cometh upon the children of disobedience
[1:51:24] now
[1:51:25] when you begin to mortify
[1:51:29] or kill off
[1:51:30] the outer man
[1:51:33] who just i'm going to be honest with you
[1:51:35] flesh and blood and inheriting the
[1:51:36] kingdom
[1:51:38] it's always going to want
[1:51:42] oh what was that that came up on my
[1:51:44] screen let me just look into it
[1:51:47] mortify it
[1:51:51] for which things take the wrath of god
[1:51:52] cometh upon the children of disobedience
[1:51:55] unwilling to fight the good fight of
[1:51:56] faith
[1:51:57] in the which he also walked sometimes
[1:51:59] and lived in them but now he also put
[1:52:03] off these things anger
[1:52:05] wrath
[1:52:06] malice blasphemy
[1:52:08] filthy communication out of your mouth
[1:52:12] in other words preserve the inner man
[1:52:17] through sanctification amen that's our
[1:52:19] opening scripture psalms 91 we have to
[1:52:22] hurry psalms 91
[1:52:24] we're almost done oh my i can't believe
[1:52:27] how time has gone by but this is a good
[1:52:30] psalms for us to read amen
[1:52:33] nobody's got to go to work today do you
[1:52:36] okay
[1:52:38] psalms 91 verse 1 he that dwelleth in
[1:52:40] the secret place
[1:52:43] of the most high shall abide under the
[1:52:46] shadow of the almighty
[1:52:48] i will say of the lord he is my refuge
[1:52:50] in my fortress my god in him i'm going
[1:52:53] to fear
[1:52:56] i'm going to fear him because i'm
[1:52:58] dwelling in christ
[1:53:01] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[1:53:02] snare of the follower from the noise and
[1:53:04] pestilence he shall cover thee with his
[1:53:06] feathers and under his wings
[1:53:08] shall thou trust
[1:53:10] his truth his word
[1:53:12] shall be thy shield and thy buckler
[1:53:15] thou shall not be afraid
[1:53:17] for the terror by night
[1:53:20] nor for the arrow that flyeth by day
[1:53:22] nor for the pestilence that walketh in
[1:53:24] darkness nor for the destruction that
[1:53:26] wasted that noon day
[1:53:28] a thousand shall fall if they say
[1:53:30] outside and ten thousand at their right
[1:53:32] hand
[1:53:33] but it shall not come nigh thee
[1:53:37] only with thine eyes shall thou behold
[1:53:39] and see the reward of the wicked
[1:53:41] because
[1:53:43] you have made the lord
[1:53:45] which is your refuge even the most high
[1:53:48] your habitation
[1:53:51] there shall no evil befall thee amen
[1:53:55] neither shall any plague come nigh thy
[1:53:57] dwelling
[1:53:58] for he shall give his angels charge over
[1:54:00] thee to keep thee in all their ways
[1:54:02] they shall bear thee up in their hands
[1:54:05] lest thou dash thy foot against the
[1:54:07] stone now i know you got many reasons to
[1:54:10] to not trust this scripture but i'm
[1:54:12] telling you i don't care what you're
[1:54:14] thinking god has never lied amen
[1:54:18] well explain this explain this i don't
[1:54:20] have to explain it i just have to
[1:54:22] believe it
[1:54:23] amen
[1:54:27] thou shall tread upon the lion and out
[1:54:29] of the young lion and the dragon shall
[1:54:31] thou under
[1:54:33] under feet
[1:54:34] because he has set his love upon me
[1:54:37] therefore i deliver him
[1:54:40] set your love upon the lord
[1:54:42] amen don't be satisfied with where
[1:54:44] you're at set more on him
[1:54:47] set your affections on him because if
[1:54:49] you do the scripture says i will deliver
[1:54:52] him what will there be to fear i will
[1:54:55] set them on high because you have known
[1:54:57] my name
[1:54:59] amen one more scripture first john
[1:55:00] chapter 4 verse 16.
[1:55:03] first john chapter 4 verse 16 and we
[1:55:06] have known and believed
[1:55:09] in the love of god
[1:55:11] in the love
[1:55:13] god hath
[1:55:15] to us
[1:55:16] we have known and we believed the love
[1:55:19] that god have towards us god is love
[1:55:22] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[1:55:25] god and god in him now can you imagine
[1:55:29] how many is dwelling in god's love how
[1:55:32] many believes that you are so full of
[1:55:35] god's love that's the only thing that
[1:55:37] comes out of you
[1:55:41] so
[1:55:42] how many believes you have just a little
[1:55:44] bit of love but a lot of times other
[1:55:46] stuff comes out
[1:55:47] amen
[1:55:48] okay so this is where i say this this is
[1:55:51] where we dig into the love of god this
[1:55:53] is the reason we seek more of the love
[1:55:55] of god
[1:55:57] because there's more for us
[1:56:01] herein is our love made complete
[1:56:05] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:56:08] judgment because as he is so are we
[1:56:12] in this evil world
[1:56:15] we can be just like him
[1:56:19] be it onto your faith
[1:56:22] well brother john i'm not going to
[1:56:23] believe this scripture until i see you
[1:56:25] walking perfectly
[1:56:29] it'll be to your doom it'll be to your
[1:56:31] danger
[1:56:33] it's not about me
[1:56:35] it's about you believing it beyond me
[1:56:40] there is no fear
[1:56:42] in love
[1:56:45] but perfect love it just cast out fear
[1:56:48] amen
[1:56:50] because fear has torment
[1:56:52] remember our definition he that feareth
[1:56:55] is not made perfect in love
[1:57:00] our goal
[1:57:02] is to get more in love with god
[1:57:04] it will cast out anything the devil
[1:57:06] throws at us
[1:57:08] now we love him
[1:57:09] because he loved us first
[1:57:12] now god so loved the world but the world
[1:57:14] does not love god
[1:57:17] so the love here that he loved us is
[1:57:20] that we recognize this love we're filled
[1:57:23] with it the only way i can know god's
[1:57:24] love is to be filled with it
[1:57:27] the only way i can know god is to be
[1:57:29] filled with him
[1:57:30] i can't know him through
[1:57:32] human understanding
[1:57:35] it has to be him inside
[1:57:38] come on now
[1:57:40] let's stand together
[1:57:42] hold fast the form of sound words in
