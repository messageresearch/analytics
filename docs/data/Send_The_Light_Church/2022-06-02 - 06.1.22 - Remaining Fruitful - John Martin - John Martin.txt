it's good to be gathered together uh midweek it's good to have our brother mark back with us we we certainly missed him when he wasn't here and what a blessing he is and we're so glad to hear that he had a wonderful time and uh we appreciate those greetings from the church there in the family and uh god will be having uh brother jack duff with us in the fall um i'm not sure is that august or september yeah and so honestly we have a number of ministers going to be coming we're going to have this some service for our children we're going to have a couple's banquet and i'm really needing the help of you all to uh get involved stay involved pray for the services and make the church um as better than what it is today yeah this is your chance you know you weren't here maybe to do all the woodwork and all the stuff that was done but you you're here today you're here now and you can build the church spiritually and i i don't believe that that work is ever ever complete so um god bless you turn with me if you would to the book of luke chapter eight last wednesday we ministered on remaining uh faithful and um today we want to administer on remaining fruitful before we begin reading here in luke chapter 8 if we could um just all of us look to the the author and prayer or our great father in heaven we're solely depending upon you lord to come and break the bread of life to us tonight lord we know that we all have different uh needs and desires and things that we'd even like to hear from you about but lord we just want to place our heart and this time into your into your hands lord that you would speak whatever you would desire to speak and lord we're incapable of receiving spiritual revelation just from our own abilities and understanding so we pray that you would just take our minds and let the thoughts that are in our minds be your thoughts today and may uh our understanding be set aside and may revelation come and take its place and let us be able to receive lord the very message that you have for us today for i believe lord it is important for us lord as you laid it on our heart we pray that we could receive it lord bless your people now as we commit the service in your hands and pray that you bless all the reading of your word now in jesus precious name we pray amen amen luke chapter eight starting with verse number four it's the parable of the sower and when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city he spake by a parable as went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the wayside and it was trodden down the files of the air devoured it so it's useless and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture that we have i don't know if you have areas in your yard but we have some areas where we don't got a lot of topsoil and if it don't rain all the time it don't stay green and it just turns yellow and sometimes can wither away and the only thing that's left is weeds and so we don't want to have a heart that's shallow it needs to be very deep amen and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up and with it and look choked it and others found good ground spraying up and bear fruit a hundred fold and when he had said these things he cried he that have an ear let him hear so he cried it must have been an important thing he he wanted it so bad that he cried and his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of god which we're hearing today amen and those by the wayside are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved they on the rock are they with when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while they believe and in time of temptation trials they fall away and they which fell among thorns are they which when they had heard they have heard they go forth and are choked with the cares and the riches and the pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection now name of our message remaining fruitful but what but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word they don't just say amen but they keep it and bring for fruit with patience god bless you you may be seated we've all been fruitful at one time or another we've all got testimonies of people seeing our lives and being and being um challenged and and being encouraged and and feeling like i can go forward because of you and we could say it's because of christ's inner life being fruitful that these things have transpired but it doesn't mean that not at any time that the cares of life or the or riches or pleasures or or trials or things could come into our life and we can literally become spiritually unfruitful and of course the devil just wants us to keep looking back at our past as if that makes a difference about our present but the lord as we're going to go through some lots of scriptures we're going to see that god wants us to remain fruitful not just to look to our past but to challenge our presence matthew chapter 7 verse 5 beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they're raving wolves now that i looked up that raving wolves and it means aggressively greedy the practice of obtaining something through force or threats so their prophets and they look and appear like a prophet outwardly but inwardly their motive is different and and and and and real true sheep live for others eternal life is living for others it's not about for self it's about for others so we're just not talking about false prophets all of us could be false prophets they don't prophet is just somebody that wants to share with about christ all kinds of prophets people that claim christ are supposed to be living for others people who claim christ but have an aggressive greedy agenda and practice obtaining things through force or even threats it's a false advertisement of the gospel and he went on to say in verse 16 that you're going to know them by their fruits tie their fruits and so then he says do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles grapes do not come upon thorn bushes nor do figs come from thistles so there's something wrong with the fruit if you get pricked right i know when i buy grapes and it it just on a vine and you don't ever have to worry about getting you know some sort of prong a poult when you go to you don't even have to look at him you just put your hand there and you pull it off and you eat it but if if when someone is sharing christ with you this is what you need to do and this is what you're doing wrong or this is what christ wants us to do you know proclaiming christ from them but at the same time you're getting poked you're getting pricked something's wrong with that fruit because jesus is saying you don't you don't pull grapes off those uh thorns you just don't do it something's wrong with the fruit if it comes with an aggressive greedy agenda something's wrong with it even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a crop tree bringing forth evil fruit now here's the thing we're a human being with faults and failures we have good days we have bad days we we try to be sweet as ever and we fly off the handle but let me just say the scripture gives us no excuse to do that in fact it's just the opposite we're not allowed to do that so we are being called to get serious about it a good tree verse 18 cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewed down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits again you shall know them by their fruits he says this two times the fruits that jesus is referring to is not the truth it's not the word of god it's not the words that you say it's the spirit that is it's mixed with amen it's a mixed tree remember it's a tree of the knowledge of good and evil so it has the the the ability like uh satan came to jesus and he said he said uh uh you can command these these stones to be made bread and you can cast yourself off and the bible says the angels will come down and catch you before you you dash a foot so it knows the word but the spirit is not right and that's the fruit that we need to look at with others amen james chapter 3 verse 8 says but the tongue can no man tame it is unruly evil it's full of deadly poison therewith bless we god even the father and therewith curse we men which are made after the simplitude of god out of the same mouth precedes blessings and cursings my brethren these things ought not to be see there's no excuse he doesn't give a reason that it's okay and then he goes and he asks these questions does a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter water has anybody ever came over your house and said is this city water is this uh well water yeah right and no it's like it is what it is and when you go to the faucet you can expect the same thing the next time it ain't going to change and so the question comes out does it the same place sweet water and bitter water come on no then we're not allowed to use our mouth for the devil or let me just say for ourselves to judge somebody to to to to get upset and and at the same time praise god can the fig tree my brethren bear allah berries neither a vine figs so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh water you see these scriptures are causing us we got to try harder we got to make a better decision not just say it doesn't matter and i'll just you know god forgive me there we can't have that type of attitude though the word needs to bring forth fruit and the fruit needs to remain we got to have the word fall see that that honest heart that that good ground they they laughed and they actually started doing what the word said amen so we hear the word and when we say amen to it we're really saying so be it i'm going to start doing this thing i'm going to i'm not just saying i'm not believe it but i believe it to the point that i'm going to start trying to do with all my heart because i know it's the will of god for my life james is demanding a separation from possessing a mixed fruit tree these things ought not to be i believe god wants us to remain faithful don't you first john chapter one verse five first john chapter one verse five then okay this then is the message which we heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say we have fellowship with jesus and then walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth now here's here's the thing we look at others who don't do what we think we they sh that what we think they should be doing and we say they're walking in darkness right because we become we become the standard of who's walking in the light and who's walking in darkness but reality there's no darkness in god at all so with that being said we're all in trouble right he that says that he doesn't have no sin he's a liar but again we have a scriptures that's pointing us that we need to be walking in all the word amen if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ the son cleanses us from all sin so we come to church to find out where we're at where god and it's the light of the word that comes to us and if we can receive that into our heart we can't look at the word i've heard that a thousand times how many want to manifest more christ in your life brother branham said in the message god who is rich in mercy he says and we was speaking the other night and how the seed must die and everything around the germ of life must not only die but rot everything around the germ of life must not only die but rot so now who does the rotting who does the dying who does the rotting who does that part thank you you know we need that more often so we can continue on we don't have to wait that's the only part we play because we can't make the term of life do anything it takes the holy ghost to brood over that and to start bringing forth its life but if we don't die i'm sorry that life is not going to come forth if if that's what if you believe the prophet you have to believe what he's saying he said and everything around that germ of life must not only die but rod if it doesn't rot it cannot live and rot is he defines it completely done away with it's finished wow we have a job to do every day and until we get to the place that our own ideas and our own thinking is completely gone excuse me and it's rotten away from us then the germ of life can begin to live isn't that a beautiful quote now we're just quoting how we can simply manifest more of christ in our life there's what we can do in the message is this the sign of the answer brother branham says i can't go on like this you've got to get desperate amen you've got to get to the place where you want to know what the will of god is and how can you know uh how can you do the will of god if you don't know the will of god so we got to get desperate we want to manifest more of christ we got to okay lord i got to start rottening out i'm going to start doing it i'm going to start praying about it i'm going to ask you to show me it's got to be real it's like god sent the prophet turn with me if you would isaiah chapter five isaiah chapter five verse number one now will i sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard my well beloved have a vineyard now notice it's in a very fruitful hill we ought to have great expectations here and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof what we usually do i i was driving by today and i seen this big field on this side of the e-way on that side of 23 and it was just lined with stones that used to be in the fields and back in the day the farmers took them and they they made a hedgerow of them and planted it with choice vine and built a tower in the midst of it i'm sure that was for the water just just to go out to hit all the the the um the good vines and then the myths also made a wine press so here's the expectation there's gonna we're gonna get grapes and we're gonna make wine from this therein and he looked at it it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes it's awful quiet in here and now all inhabitants of jerusalem and men are judah judge i pray you betwixt me and my vineyard what could i have done more to my vineyard than i have not done in it he did everything possible he put it in the in a in a very fruitful hill the ground was good and fertile he fenced it so no animals could get in he took all the stones out he planted the absolute best vines that he could put in he put a tower to water it perfectly he haven't even had an expectation to make a press that when these grapes come forth he's going to have good wine so he looked that grape should come forth because that's what he planted and wild grapes came that's poison berries by the way and now go to i tell you what i will do to my vineyard i will take away the hedge thereof and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it shall be trouted down and i will lay it to waste it shall not be pruned nor digged and there shall come upon those shall come up briars and thorns and i will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it wow i think god was upset because he did everything in order to bring forth proper grapes and of course we know what wild is wild is the nature that we were born with it's a beastly nature that wants to do its own will and god didn't plant us to do our own will he planted us to do his will briars are a tangled mass of prickly plants and the job of the thorns are to choke out the good vines remember we read that in the parable some of the seed fell among thorns and grew up and choked up the plants so you know it isn't a lot of times when we're listening to the tapes or we're listening to a message or we're reading our bible or we come to church it isn't that the word isn't the pure word but it's the condition of our heart we are allowing certain things certain desires inside of us and they literally choke out the word from coming to manifestation and it will every time we don't think it makes a difference that we can simultaneously put in there but but god is not going to share his glory with the devil not going to allow him to be in there if that's what we're going to choose then that's what he's going to say he wants to be lord of everything amen the word seed could only come forth and remain in the good soil or the good heart where it would produced a crop 100 fold 64 34 where it was sown how important is it is for us to have a good heart a heart to take the word and and take it home with us for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel and the men are jew judah his pleasant plant and he looked for judgment but behold oppression for righteousness but behold a cry let's look at another a parable in the in the new testament it's a parable of the householder demanding fruit from his vineyard very similar to this now we are the spiritual house of israel and god demands fruit to be in our life and to remain in our life and if he doesn't get it similar things happen but in a spiritual realm he just lets it go to waste and hebrews chapter 3 verse 6 says but christ as a son over his own house whose house we are if we hold the hope fast the confidence in the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end now remember i remember when i first came to the lord i was i was the happiest man on the planet that's right we all remember that nobody felt like we felt because our sins were taken away and we knew we were going to heaven and we were told about a rapture and we're going to grow in christ our lives are going to become beautiful and then what happened we lost that confidence somewhere down the line come on where is the amens and then we got to go back and we got to try to cultivate it but we can't stop we cannot stop we got to keep going to the end yes sir amen matthew chapter 21 verse 33 matthew 21 verse 33 here another parable there was a certain householder which planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and digged a wine pressed in it and built a tower and let it out to the husbandmen and went into a far country and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed the other and stoned another again he sent other servants more than the first and they did unto them likewise but last of all he sent unto them his sons saying they will reverence my son but when the husband saw the sun they said unto themselves this is there come let us kill him and and let us seize on his inheritance and they caught him and they cast him out of the vineyard and slew him now when the lord thereof the of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto those husbandmen now we are the husbandmen we have a choice to let god's life the fruit of his spirit be in our life or we can choose not to want him not to have to do his will and do our own will seize our own life he that seeks to save his life shall lose it and he that is willing to lose his life for for our heavenly father shall save his life so he's asking the question what will he do unto these husband men amen they say unto him he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their season so see he's god is expecting to get fruits that's all there is to it if you don't get them there's there's trouble now jesus saith unto them did you did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same as become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing and is marvelous in our eyes therefore i say unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken away from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof so we understand that the kingdom was taken away from israel and it was given to the gentiles they rejected the head cornerstone which he became the corner of our lives the capstone oh i didn't i don't have it we all know about the pyramid right and the top is is is perfect love it's christ the capstone but this is also for us right because if if we reject the headstone of christ's will for our personal lives he's just gonna he's gonna give it to somebody else it's to whomsoever will he deals with gentiles as individuals and he ends up saying this statement and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but whosoever shall shall whosoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder so imagine there's this heavy stone and you're up north and you're looking at the beautiful scenery and there's this rock and you're up on the hill and this rock is huge i mean it is a huge one and you fell on the thing and you would hurt yourself could break an arm a leg an ankle it would hurt but imagine if that same stone was above you and it fell on you you would have more than a broken arm a broken ankle and this is the thing we've we've got to fall on the word of god we've just got to give our will to god just it's going to hurt it it'll break us but a humble and contrite spirit we've got to have that humble ourselves to become a humble and contrite spirit and be broken it's much better than that god coming at the end and we have no chance i have no chance at all every single person is going to have contact with the head of the cornerstone will either humble ourselves or it's going to fall upon us god is wanting us to bring forth a fruit that will remain and it's not just talking about the truth but it's the spirit that we pack with us all day long that we need to be watching because it's by their fruits you shall know them it's not what we know it's not what christ has done in our lives it's not what we can share it's the spirit that we have it's the motive that we have it's are we really laying our down our life for a person are we just trying to tell them what they need to do i want to get a little bit into what this fruit is more john chapter 13 verse 34 john chapter 13 verse 34 a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another so if i got this water and i come over here and i say gabe i want to give you this water and i want you to give this water onto someone like i have given it unto you what are you going to do i want you to give that water to someone as i have given water unto you you give it to somebody all right now that is what jesus meant when he said that you love one another as i have loved you now we all can brag about how much jesus loved us he's done so much for us he forgives us every day when we get on our knees to say god i'm sorry for my sins today and you know what it is the love of god that forgives us and now he turns around to his disciples and he says i wa i'm giving you a new commandment and you've got to love others the same way i'm loving you not almost not if it works out for your convenience but this is a commandment focus on it it's a commandment and then he says in verse 35 by this shall all men know that you're my disciple if ye have loved one for another now brother branham in the unpardonable sin is re he refers to this scripture as that is where there is divine perfect love of god resting in the heart so catch this it takes the divine love of god to love someone anyone the exact same way that god has loved you because god has loved you with an unconditional divine love from the heart of god to you and now he says you take that same love and you love somebody else with it don't try to deal with your own love it's a respect to persons it'll come short and you've got to love with his love now jesus said in matthew that you shall know them by your fruits he says here in john by this shall all men know you're my disciples if you have love one for another so this must be a fruit more than just an episode if it's just an episode then you're going to have the mixed tree again but it this that jesus is referring to it's a fruit if we have love one for another love is the first fruit of the spirit that's talked about galatians but i'll say this is more than a fruit it's the nature of god it's divine love and it is the commandment that jesus gave us that we love one another as jesus has loved us that he also love one another and i'll say so little emphasis is put on this commandment we're sure to knock on the door when we need god's love when's the last time you knocked on the door and said lord i don't even want to face anybody without your love today i don't want to fake it right i don't want to be a storefront i don't want to run i don't want to hide i just want to be so full of the love of god so little is emphasized to this commandment we will fight and argue proving we are god's we will quote the word we will quote the message we'll even judge others using the word but we won't put us under the burden of loving the unlovable of loving unconditionally of giving ourselves regardless if we get slapped hit we have to prove that we're right we're not going to stand there i'm no weaker christian i'm not going to let somebody do that to me then what are you if you won't only a christian can take it only the divine love of god can stand there and have a spirit on his side and thorns on his head and whipped and talked about and still love them you can't do that right amen i can't do that you don't want my love right you want the love of god amen amen and you need the love of god without i mean how many times you just oh i can't love it i can't that the person's doing this and what are you speaking of you're speaking of you're identifying the condition of your love with with all your problems and everybody can have the same testimony but when you get filled talk about having the holy ghost when we get filled with the love of god there is no problem because there's no problem with god we're going to amen about my problem are we going to talk about how great god is amen brother man says and everything around that germ of life must not only die but it'll rot if it doesn't rot it cannot live and rod is completely done away with it it's finished and until we get to the place that our own ideas and our own thinking is completely gone and rotten away from us then that germ of life can begin to live i'll just say whatever you're struggling with it's because something's standing in the way of that germ of life coming to life coming to manifestation and he says you've got to get desperate get desperate john chapter 15 verse number one jesus said i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit is taken away and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit now i know those everybody that's ever worked with me knows have thought that isn't it good enough come on can you say amen it's the truth and sometimes we've heard preaching i say is it is it that's enough can we have something different but the very nature of god does not want you to remain as fruitful as you are can you say amen i'm not taking away your fruit god's not taking away your fruit but what he wants is more fruit we're talking about the way that god his thoughts are higher than our thoughts his ways are higher than our ways and we need to we need to we need the mind of christ it's okay if if god sends a trial our way to make us be more fruitful i'm okay with it i'm okay with it if there's one way we're going to reach perfection it's god's way it ain't going to be me trying to defend myself and saying god i don't i don't think i need to go through the church i don't think this is fair i think i've done more than everybody else who cares who cares if you did more than everybody else god's still calling you a lot higher than everybody else he's calling us to places we can't even see we can't father we haven't experienced yet so we need to believe for it he knows what he's doing now you're clean through the word which i have spoken unto you hmm that's why you take it and live it that's it abide in me and i in you that's the word as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can you except you abide in me how many times have we tried to love somebody when we weren't connected to jesus how many times we just want to throw in the towel we have the answer right here we just need to humble ourselves and get more connected to the lord i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit much fruit he promised to do extremely above all that we would ask or even thank much fruit and let's just get right down to it for without me you can do nothing just get it out of your head he's getting us to rely on him which we should amen if a man abide not in me in other words he's just coming to come just just wants to be forgiven of his sins and that's it no abiding no relationship no working on it no growing no fruit no much more no don't like the pruning if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and you know what that withered means right you just don't got joy you just don't got that love and peace and long suffering and gentleness and meekness you're just all dried up and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you not you speaking his word but his word abiding in you that's totally different you can be so out of the spirit and just use the word use the word but god ain't looking for that he's looking for us to take the word that we hear today take it home and apply it put it in our lives that's the word abiding in you if you abide in me in my words abiding you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you god has reserved something special for the relationship for for an intimate relationship herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit oh my you want to glorify i came to glorify his name we can sing it we can enjoy the praises of it or we can bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples as the father have loved me so i have loved you continue in my love if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full notice closely if we don't keep his commandments we will not remain in the vine of his love we have to be interested in keeping the commandments i don't know you know so many people talk about the love of god the love of god love and they're not even they don't pay any attention to the commandments and that it's just so contrary to what jesus is teaching here if we don't keep the commandments we're not going to remain in the vine of his love and if we don't remain in the vine of his love his joy won't remain with us if we don't keep the first fruit love then we don't get the second fruit joy now i'm just speaking the truth because we want his fruit to remain when you can love the unlovable that is not you that's christ in you that's the fruit of the holy ghost when you got joy unspeakable full of glory that's not you happy that's christ in you when the bottoms falling out when you got the peace of god that passeth all understanding it will keep you amen because it is the peace of god he is our peace this is my commandment that you love one another as i have loved you here it is again we're hearing the same thing again do you love me do you love me it's a good question do you love me the way that christ has loved you do you love the person you're sitting next to the person across the aisle across the the person that's not here do you love them the way that christ loves you why we need to put an emphasis to this i'm telling you this is where christ is taking us before the rapture this is where he's taking us if we don't get there we're not going greater love have no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends how many times did brother branham get up behind the pulpit and he'd say good morning friends everyone was his friend jesus called judas his friend i mean to have the the the love of god so full in your heart that you just love everyone and there's no greater love than this than a man lay down his life for his friends they would come to brother brand they'd say oh brother man i love you but he knew they didn't they were just words but he still loved them because it was no longer brother branham amen he was the first fruit it was christ in him and i'll tell you you can have it i can have it we can have it but we've got to believe that this is what we must do it can't be an option for us it's not an option for the bride it will be for the nominal church but it won't be for the bride ye are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you oh now now now we have this stipulation jesus will be afraid to everybody but we can't be his friend until we keep his commandment think about that we have a part to play henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what is lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you aren't you glad that we have a ministry that just says it like it is not holding back not afraid that not going to be liked better not say this but you can hear the full word of god amen i'm so glad that god sent a prophet that would not hold back at all we can have confidence you have not chosen me jesus said here but i have chosen you i've chosen you and i've ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain if it don't remain it don't do any good it don't matter about the past you don't ever see paul bragging about his past no don't you think he says you know what i'm pressing towards the mark i've got something in front of me i got a prize for the high calling i'm pressing towards that there's a fruit that we ought to be bearing today and you know you don't need to be in church to bear it you'd be right you're home when somebody yells at you are they called for the 13th time and they want to put new windows in your house whatever it is or you ordered a pizza a certain way and they brought something totally different and you can't eat it that's the time to shine right don't let it get under your skin and boil up and the old man come out the new man christ in you he needs to just be manifested see to me trials can be looked at two ways one i don't want it in my life get rid of them shouldn't happen to me why me again oh my oh me and the other way is i have a chance to shine for jesus it's just how you want to look at it it's your attitude it makes a difference but either way we've been called and ordained not to be a church pew sitter but that we should go out bear fruit much fruit amen and that it keeps going it remains that every time god looks he sees the fruit amen everybody you're talking to every situation you're bearing fruit that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you notice how these are always connected to the commandments that we need to do something if we're feeling we're just going to be able to have liberty to use the name of jesus right come on it's about a relationship i mean if my wife she just i saw her step in the back so if she every time she seen me she says give me money give me money but she won't even give me a hug one make me a baloney sandwich i think that would just be unfair you know to use me i don't think jesus wants to be used he's interested in a relationship these things i command you that you love one another so here it is the theme of what we just read in the last 17 verses is love yes that's the fruit that he's looking for are you with me brother brandon says this in the message beyond the curtain of time he said he he said then a voice spoke to me so this is a voice this is what you preached that the holy ghost is this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it so when you're listening to the tapes the messages the holy ghost is preaching you know what you're hearing you're hearing perfect love because that's what the voice said amen this is what you preached is the holy ghost this is perfect love when you're hearing these commandments this is god's perfect love speaking to us through the prophet this is the working of the holy spirit it isn't some feeling is it some emotion it isn't some uh god used me no no it's a perfect love manifested at all times nothing can enter here without it so brother band didn't say that the voice spoke that right so all sudden we got a gatekeeper and the gatekeeper saying yeah i'm glad you've been repented glad you got baptized glad you at the church glad you paid your tithes but i'm telling you nothing but perfect love is coming in amen i think we should be interested in in this fruit remaining in our life then you voice still speaking then you will present us to him and all together we will go back to earth to live forever i asked do i have to go back to earth now face they answered they answered yes but keep pressing on this is really important keep pressing on god as long as we're here and god hasn't taken us god's heart for you you don't need to ask them god wants you to be pressing in towards the mark towards the image of christ towards perfect love that's what he wants you to be doing and not in your spare time because we don't got much time and i'll tell you i don't care if my loved ones don't go with me we still gotta go [Applause] i'm not talking about salvation i'm talking about a rapture suddenly i was back on the bed again now look listen to the heart of the prophet i said oh god help me never let me compromise with the word don't let me just ignore it and go home let me stay straight on the word i don't care what anybody else does i'm so glad he said that i don't care what anybody else does lord let me press on to that beautiful joyful place he didn't leave the podium yes i'm going i'm there i witnessed it i'm lord i've done no his heart was lord let me keep pressing let me keep pressing what is that's the spirit that we're talking about because that's the spirit that came from heaven and told him no you can't stay here right now you got to go back but you keep pressing but you know what keeps us from pressing cares of life pleasures riches goals what we can have down here what we're trying to attain what we're trying to achieve what we're what about the voice from heaven calling us to a perfect love i'd rather i don't care what anybody else does lord i'm going to keep pressing don't wait for the church don't wait to everybody's feeling good don't wait to the atmosphere to say oh yeah that that's a good one be what christ wants you to be amen the holy ghost in you can do that and if it's lacking then just be where i'm at press in press in for more all right brother man says i am more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter in that place there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only supreme beauty and joy whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love and we've read this quote many times get to where you can love every body even your enemy now i love this no matter if the planes are rocking the lightnings are flashing or the guns of the enemy are upon you he said these things do not matter he said get perfect love those are just distractions the world is just distracting you the news is just distracting you the devil is just distracting you get perfect love whatever you do get perfect love we could say like peter said giving all diligence add to your faith virtue we're talk we're talking these virtues they're they're demonstrated they're manifested by the spirit that we live give all diligence in others whatever you do lay aside everything give diligence all diligence add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and then what the capstone of your building of your life charity now that word diligence it means speed eagerness busy earnest care forward haste i want to say have you dispatched yourself for charity that's what it means is it your calling or is it just on your bucket list is it just something you you know or is it really important to you ii peter 1 verse 8 says and if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should neither be barren or nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ this knowledge is not intellectual information of truth this fruitfulness in this knowledge is the recognition of full discernment the full manifestation of christ in your life that you can put on charity you can manifest the life and i'll tell you i wouldn't worry about preaching honestly it didn't cross my my mind for many years brother johnson about preaching many years just never did but i'll tell what was on my mind all the time was manifesting christ that's what's important because our life speaks very loud to people so we need to get to the place can i have a few extra minutes all right what about the rest of you i want to talk to you after service what good would it do a person to have all the knowledge of these virtues but wouldn't be able to manifest them it would be like someone that was given a million dollar account in their life but they went through their whole life and they were never able to touch it or use it it would be fruitless they would die a million dollar account go on to his air that's what the knowledge of these intellectual knowledge of these virtues would do to somebody who could never manifest it when they need them it like does no good i'll say it would be off the tree of knowledge of good and evil see the devil knows and he believes but he does not live right amen said in the message israel and the church he said and where there's tongues it'll cease and where there's knowledge it will vanish away but when perfect love has come into the human heart all demons in hell will never be able to upset it so i'll tell you i'll stick with that quote before i'm gonna let some devil tell me it's okay to get upset and angry all the time perfect love in the human heart all demons in hell will never be able to upset it i want that don't you i want more of that brother man said in the message the inside man he said it will take perfect love to bring us into perfect harmony with god think about that statement our love don't do it our love is selfish i remember when i first made my deal with god i told him i would serve him if he would give me cheryl it was a deal see starting out i had restrictions but i'll tell you what i was not in perfect harmony with god it wasn't until i said lord i do not want anything above you i do not care what your will turns out to be i want you i want you in my life come into my life lord i will serve you no matter what and when i came into perfect harmony amen it was because i had the right love for god not a selfish love not a greedy love not a false prophet love god wants us to remain fruitful let's get all of our past achievements out of the way and start pressing to something you don't have the high calling i'll say it's perfect love it's the full manifestation of christ in you it's the capstone the very thing that a lot of church members just kick it's not a big deal as long as i go to church that's all that matters you know god he wants to be our head he wants to come in just set over here and tell us what to do i want to encourage you to lay aside everything in your in your life i know it's hard to do you got a lot going you're trying to build your future that's right and i like how the brother man says he said just lay aside everything until if you got it and your and you if you don't got it he'll show you just wait till the test comes when you're unwilling to lay something aside and go help somebody when you're busy i'll show you we want to lay everything aside till we don't have any ill towards anybody no negative feelings no divisions no no respect to persons until you're not bothered by people we want to get to that place no matter what they do no matter what the government does no matter what the schools do no matter what happens brother branson says no matter if the planes are rocking the lights flashing the guns of the enemy or upon you these things have do do not matter get perfect love now i see so many people get wrapped up in this world the wrong of this world what's not right and what should be happening i mean 30 years ago i knew it was wrong to blow up an abortion clinic but it's gotten so far beyond that now so far beyond that but they put little emphasis on going after what god requires to make it in it's as if somehow god is just going to give it to them no matter what but if that's true why would we have a prophet in this age tell us to go do what we need to do i think i'd rather believe the prophet than what the devil tells me get to the place where you can love everyone i'm closing get to the place where you can love everyone the same way that christ loves you we can all identify how much christ loves us because we talk about all the times he's forgiven us all the times he's bailed out all the times he's met our needs all the time but can we love others that way so let's get to that place let's start let's start putting some time to that now what i'm asking you for i'm not asking you for for something that we want to look at tonight and then forget about it and go home i'd rather skip tonight go home and live the rest of your life be thinking about it because this is an important important subject there's no greater love that we could have that we could live out that we could manifest than actually taking your life and given it to help somebody every day we have a chance to do that i know we got to work i got to work sometimes you have to get things in order but we have a whole life to lay down for others i told my wife the other day i says i enjoy living for my wife i literally enjoy it and it didn't matter what she'd asked me to do it just it just wouldn't matter and she's she doesn't ask ridiculous things and doesn't have to be perfect there's just a lot of things it's just a lot of things but i enjoy it i thoroughly enjoy it we as the bride should thoroughly enjoy living for god amen the best way we can do it is love his people live for live for one another amen you have not chosen me but stand together but i have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you ask in the father's name he will give it to you these things i command you that you love one another i believe the fruit he's looking for is love one for another it's the capstone amen this thing that little course he's all i need just make love to him he's all i need he's all i need jesus is all i need [Music] is all i need is all i need jesus is all i need he's all i need he's all i need is all i need he's all i need is all i need jesus is all i need everyone lift your hands is all i need jesus is all i need [Music] is i need jesus is all i need amen let's just keep our hands lifted let's just go to him in prayer our heavenly father we're lord we're confessing in song you're all we need you're all we need lord you inside of us is greater than anything in the whole world amen we don't need our days to go good we don't need to have everything perfect in our lives and we don't need everybody to love on us lord but we need you we need you lord and we confess as the lord of our life you're all we need so glad lord that we can we can know you in this matter that you're first and foremost you are the one that supplyeth all of our needs according to your riches and glory you are the one that heals our bodies you are the one that fills us you are the one that loves enemies through us you are the one [Music] and lord we welcome the capstone of your holy spirit in our lives come rest upon each of us lord come settle down on our spirit lord help us help us almighty god that we would manifest you that we would be able to love everyone the same way that you've been so faithful to love us lord we commit ourselves to you we we surrender our we fall upon the rock lord we let you take control the reigns of our life lord and father today is restoring lord if there's any doubts if there's any fears if there's any questions lord i pray the great blood of jesus would come and just take that all

lord bless them we love you we thank you for these things we humbly pray in jesus precious name amen he's all i need ill my cup lord we lifted [Music] amen that's okay [Music] thirsty of my soul
