Happy New Year to to each of you uh it's been a a wonderful time that we had this past year we' we've had a I believe a a really good fivefold ministry here in 2023 we've heard some wonderful messages and uh God has has blessed the bride with his precious word and uh we're looking forward to getting out of here amen that's what it's all for that's what that's what coming to church that's what the five-fold ministry is for is to is to help get us out of here and uh we're looking forward we're looking forward to that the sooner the better the world's going down well turn with me if you would this morning we had two scripture readings the first is in second Peter chapter 3 and the second is going to be in Revelations chapter 21 amen as we're turning there uh we want to speak this morning on God is working in us to make All Things New amen amen amen amen let's just approach him in a word of prayer before we begin reading Heavenly Father we thank you for watching over us this entire year Lord every time we came to church every time we went home when we went to the store when we went to work when we went on vacation Lord thank you for your hand of protection Lord we thank you for giving his health and strength strength Lord we thank you for building your kingdom in us we thank you for the faith you have given us that we we're your wife we belong to you and that you're going to see us through thank you that you're you've made your your word real to us Lord and that Lord you're keeping us out of leoa that Luke warned us father we open you our lives and we just want to thank you today for your goodness father as we approach this this new year coming up we pray that you would instill within us an an inspiration of the new work uh that you're going to do within us father to make us ready for the Rapture Lord every time we we look at the news or we hear something something something's changing worse and worse in the world and even in the church world but oh God we pray that you'd help us to keep our eyes fixed on you you're the not only the author but the finisher of our faith Lord I pray that you would reveal yourself to us this morning encourage us Inspire us Lord to to walk closer to you we thank you for these things and ask your blessings now on the reading of your word we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen second Peter chapter 3 starting with verse number 10 but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise and the element shall melt with fervent Heat their Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what Manner persons ought ye to be in a holy conversation and godliness looking for and hastening until the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness amen then in Revelations chapter 21 we're going to read the uh first 10 verses there and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the new the the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband so notice the bride is getting ready to look more appealing to her husband she's adorning herself she's she wants to get the attraction of her husband amen and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow or crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away can you say Amen to that verse and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write uh for uh for these words are true and faithful amen and he said unto me it is done I am the alpha the Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of Life freely and he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful and the unbelieving abominable B the murders and hor mongers Sorcerers and adulterers and all liars shall have their part in the lake of which burneth with fire and brimstone uh which is the second death and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vows full of the seven last plagues and Tau with me saying come hither and I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me the great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God having the glory of God Amen God bless you may be seated may the Lord just bless us this morning with a freshness of these scriptures here amen God wants to become one with us amen he wants to dwell in us and the Bible tells us that all the former things are going to be passed away right and that all things are going to be new so I can say it like this I believe that the bride her old nature is going to be passed away amen wouldn't it be great one day to wake up and not have to crucify our flesh not have to deny it but just to know that it has passed away amen well many people are afraid to let the word of God control them and the Bible says but the fearful and the unbelieving they are in the same boat as the abominal and the murderers and the Liars so fear is a terrible thing and there are a lot of people that are afraid just to let the word to control them and others simply just don't believe it because they just don't think it's necessary they they they they they repented they got baptized they accepted what Jesus did for them on the cross and that is the extent of their relationship and so many people have lost hope in this world this used to be a great nation and it has fallen amen uh our borders have been open to to terrorists and who knows what else has come in it's definitely made it easier for the the drug drugs to come in and uh I I believe it trafficking human trafficking and all kinds of stuff it just made it easier because the borders have been open and there's problems those who voted for it have have come against it and I'm not into politics but I'm just stating some of the world of Affairs that's going on here in the states fear has gripped the world though Bible says men's Hearts would be failing for fear is there going to be a financial and an econ iCal crash is cyber terrorism going to be our downfall our deadly virus is going to be released is socialism going to take over is Russia or China going to Nuke us and what is our government doing about these things according to a poll in 2015 1ir of the population said that their Congress was corrupt just last year 56% of the survey res uh respondents said that their government was corrupt so it's increased and just this year it has risen over 60% we know politics is corrupt amen but think that those that don't have Christ what do they have to look to where is their hope so they try to grab on to some some politics some government some party but they they're losing hope politics and the government a business a church or home is nothing but selfs serving interest or behavior that's all it is and and the better lobbyist you are the better you can manipulate the more value be you become to those who's willing to pay to get their interest brand said in the the message uncertain sound he said quoting the scripture Babylon has fallen is Fallen become the habitation of every unclean spirit amen he says that's exactly where it's at sure we have no security in our nation it's uncertain everywhere uncertainties uncertain in your job uncertain in your politics uncertain in the Democratic party uncertain in the Republican Party uncertainty in all parties that's right and in the church church it's also uncertainty am we don't want to put our trust in this church amen let me say that again I want to hear amen we don't want to put our trust in this church we want to put our trust in the word of God that that is what we need because if you put your trust in anything but that you're going to miss it there's a fine line this is a vehicle that God has planned to meet us and to deliver the word to us but we don't want to look at church carnally man-made we've got to look at it it spiritually that God is in the body God is is is is washing the body with the body and God is using the the the the th this Pulpit as a as a as a a vehicle to get the word to to uh uh the Bible says to um an entrance shall be ministered unto you and and and this this word that comes forth is truly God speaking to the elect amen I believe that that's right there's been a massive decline just in the very interest of religion multitudes are leaving the church for all sorts of reasons a nation that was once founded on the freedom of religion the people don't even care about religion anymore amen they've lost their moral compass that's right their moral values Paul described this day as a there would be a great fall in way an apostasy today people are watching their uh their denominational values in their churches decline just shrink into more ungodliness they're watching gospel standards disappear and evil slip right into the ranks and I don't want to get into all the things that that people are letting into their churches for you've heard the the news but I believe that the spiritual borders have been let down and have been opened up to every and have become the habitation of devils and a hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird amen Peter said knowing this that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation in other words they feel that nothing's changed I don't feel any closer to his coming now than when I first gave my heart to God because these these are not worldly people that he's referring to that are golfers these are worldly believers who believe in the second coming of the Lord amen but inside their heart they're saying where's the promised I don't see anything changing inside of me that's what they're saying they don't say it out loud but inside see they don't see spiritually the coming of the Lord and if they did they would be gathering all the more as they saw the day approaching amen people as a whole are are losing hope brother Bram said in the message the token he says how can you take any chance on any church membership or anything else how can you afford to do it seeing we're living in a time when there is no hope in politics there's no hope in the future the only uh the only thing lies in the coming of Jesus Christ the coming of Christ to get his church that's the only thing that's got hope in it Amen brother Bram said in the message of man running from the presence of God he says press on we must do it we must get down to it everywhere we go and tell the message and tell people that Jesus Christ is coming and he's God and he's coming soon there's not a hope left in the world right but the coming of the Lord amen but yet people are still trying to find Hope in different things amen there's no hope at all in this life amen that's right the Bible tells us that if in this life only we have hope in Christ right we are all men most miserable that's why some people you look at some Christians and they just don't seem to be very happy we're not living for this age amen we're not living for this life it's all about the life to come and how do we know about that life because our nature is changing inside of us that's right it's changing every week amen eternal life is living for others we're not living for this life can you say amen amen how do you know you have eternal life I mean if I was to ask some people that they would say because I believe St John 3:16 I believe but brother Brandon comes along he says well really eternal life is living for others so we can say we believe but we we should be able to take brother Brand's definition look at our life and see if we're living for others amen you know it's like uh Paul saying that uh we're saved by faith and James says no we're saved by works is both and we should be able to see that we have eternal life by how much we're living for others amen come on now this is just gospel I know our flesh wants to just feel that we're that we're we got eternal life no matter what and I'm all for that but I'm to the bride now the bride is the only group that will be living for others amen amen because there's no other hope except in Jesus Christ and his coming abam tells the story about uh a friend of his his name was Wilmer Snider Wilmer Snider anybody remember that story he was an insurance agent and he went to school with him when he was a boy and of course brother brandom he said he he had a a bad experience the way that he sold this insurance to his dad it didn't work out real well but he told Brother R says you you need to get some some life insurance for yourself Billy and amen and brother brother Brandon says well I I already got insurance he says oh I didn't know what insurance did he get he said well blessed insurance he said it real fast you know his wife looked at him finally coming to the realization he says yeah but brother ran says that won't get you in that won't put you in the ground he says I know but it'll get me out and that's what's really important we need to keep our focus on what's important in our lives it's not living for down here it's living for the other side too many people are focusing on this life they're not recognizing their purpose we shouldn't be just waiting for the rapture we should be preparing oursel we should be adorning oursel right right and when we're not doing that we should be living for others amen see the purpose is completely different it's not just waiting it's occupying till I come amen we need to recogniz recognize ourselves in the Bible brother bam taught us that and that when the bride really sees herself who she is then then the Rapture is going to take place so there's there's a process of Us coming to church and recognizing that that's what we are we are that word brother B told that story about the the chicken that the little Eagle that was in the chicken yard and for so much of its its life it was just amongst all the other chickens and it it would it tried to do the things that the uh other chickens were doing and digging in the dirt and looking for bugs and things like that uh but something never just sat right but couldn't explain it didn't know it one time the the eagle uh mother Eagle came by and uh where she had dropped that egg and and and when she cried out that scream of the Gospel was preached then she recognized that that there was a a spirit inside of her that bore witness with the with the spirit of that mother and recognize that there was a connection there and I believe that's what needs to be happening to us we need to recognize that we are the word we're just not saved but we are that word we're to become that word amen Jesus recognized himself in the scriptures amen says lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God MH that's right we've got to recognize that's what we're to do is to to find our place in these scriptures and then when we do we will obey the word we will we will do the will of God and that's why we've come in this age is to manifest the complete word we I'll tell you what if all you want to do is believe then you really should have came up in Luther's age right amen this age we're to Manifest this is the manifesting age to manifest the word amen we must recognize that we are a part of the new thing that God is doing he says he makes all things new now the world is going down the world is not going to be made new he's going to burn he's going to burn the Earth this whole country is going to be blown up in different places right that's what we know it to be true so the world isn't going to be be made new but we are made new because we're a part of him am and this word is the only thing that can make us new amen we don't believe in the power of the Mind Over the matter we don't believe in selfhelp right we believe in self- crucifixion we we believe in letting God yelding herself to God let him come in and make our life more like his amen God hasn't left us I'm sure we all battle at times Where's God I want to see God more maybe he's left us maybe he's left me have you ever thought thoughts like that yes all right who who's not wanting remember all liars you know where they go we've all battled at some time or another Where's God people lose hope when they feel alone amen but we must remember God said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you amen regardless of what your feelings tell you regardless of what your mind tells you amen regardless of what circumstances tell you I'll be with you even in you to the very end now as we receive the word that's being preached to us into our hearts that is actually what's preparing us to be the Tabernacle of God he didn't choose me because my name was John Martin he chose me because I belong to him that's right amen and now we're in this process where we're we're building together he gives me his word and I say yes Lord not my will but thine will be done and I begin to walk in the truth of that word it becomes important to my life and as I do that now I'm preparing my vessel a place for him to dwell in because I am a part of that Tabernacle amen I'm a part of that Tabernacle I don't know which part but I'm a part part of it now we all have to fight thoughts that make us feel too comfortable that we have already attained that's right the Bible says God's plan is to present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing that but it should be holy and without blemish God wants to dwell in this kind of Tabernacle and the Bible tells us that this church this Tabernacle is called the New Jerusalem prepared as a bride adorned for her husband she keeps receiving the word and she keeps obeying the word and as we do this this is you adorning yourself for Jesus Christ Christ in you the hope of glory not just a a belief mentally not just part of his Spirit but now it's the whole word because remember in this age more is required of the Bride than it was in any other age amen and of course the devil keeps pointing us back to you know something something other so we don't press on that's his purpose that's and and that's why sometimes we look at the the the ministry here sometimes and it's it's it's it it it seems sometimes strong or hard but you'll never regret when you're on the other side ever hearing a a strong messag you'll never regret it on the other side it's only on this side and I'm telling you it's not the inner man that's doing it it's not the inner man all right 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 says but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you suff not even as others which have no hope but if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them which uh also which sleep in Jesus Christ will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that they which are alive and remain this is us this verse is US unto the coming of the Lord shall not pre prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord now look at this verse 18 wherefore Comfort one another with these words am now my question to you when is the last time you said that these words to somebody because we have a responsibility here to comfort one another with these words to talk about it amen because the more we we get our phones out we look at the news the less we're going to talk about it amen our Focus has to be on the New Jerusalem God is coming down to get us amen he wants to dwell on us amen these words ought to be encouraging that we're ever going to be with the Lord that we're not going to be left behind in some tribulation amen we've heard the shout it's w it's woken us up we're we're we're we're going out to meet the bridegroom every time we come to church we're coming out to meet the bridegroom right the word is coming to dress us it's his spirit it's the quickening power and this this message uh shakes us out of our sleep and you know every day our bodies need the rest right and I know as I'm getting older I'm I'm having less and less zip and zap in my life and we need the word to keep quickening us amen now if God makes all things knew don't doubt of what he's going to do in your life the Bible says he which have begun a good work he's going to finish it amen and we can't question it we can't doubt it we can't all a sudden start going by our feelings we St can't go by the news that's out in the world we've got to stay with the word the word says it we believe it and the more we do the more we'll be looking forward to to taking the word into our life and God there's got to be word that I can manifest for you in this in in this coming week we're not just standing behind I believe in in in this message as if that's all we got to do but we got to get the message manifested amen that's the hardest thing the easiest thing is to say Amen to the word when it's being preached the hardest thing is liveing it because the flesh is not going to say Amen the flesh is not saying so be it no no but we are the New Jerusalem we are the house of God we're the Tabernacle we're God's dwelling place and it doesn't seem like much right now we look at our our habits and our faults and our failures and these things should uh motivate us to to get more serious with God to to spend more time with God to to be with him in prayer more and and and and as we each year that goes by each year that goes by it gets harder the world is getting worse but here's the thing the bride is getting closer has to be because when he appear she's going to be just like him amen so we see the world going this way we see the bride going this way and the the question is where are you standing amen do do you see yourself growing more in his nature do you see yourself living more for others do you see yourself adorning yourself for the bridegroom and and thanks thank the Lord that's what we need to hear because look even if we don't see ourselves doing that you need to say Amen to it we need to start doing it because as we're approaching this year this could be the last year for us we don't know things could happen real quick things could happen real quick uh I don't know who they're going to get into the into the government but you know it doesn't matter we know that somehow something is going to be said where they say peace and safety everything's okay now but then sudden destruction's coming it's going to happen I don't know how it's going to happen but I'll tell you we need to just forget about all that stuff it just doesn't matter yes now if God has spoke to you to go somewhere and tell them about Jesus Christ do that get back and and start giving your All to Jesus Christ let's take a look at John 14 Jesus is not wanting us to lose hope he's not wanting his disciples to to lose hope because he was leaving In the Flesh and he says here in John 14 verse1 let not your heart be trou LED ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions so we're talking about this New Jerusalem the new Tabernacle coming down right if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you amen and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also amen and whether I go you know and you know the way now I can put myself in Thomas's shoes here Thomas sayith him Lord we know not where you're going and how can we know the way and Jesus said unto him I am the way I am the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me well there is a million things it seems hundreds of things that we can talk about in these scriptures but where was Jesus going where was he going he's going inside of us to prepare him a Dwelling Place amen that's where he's going he's not going somewhere up there in the sky and we know that by the next three chapters that we read here Jesus said in the same chapter verse 23 Jesus said I if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abold with him see we see this is the process of reconciliation right the word Goes Forth if we love God enough to receive the word the word comes inside then the Holy Spirit comes inside of us to live that word and we're becoming the New Jerusalem amen the new Tabernacle this is the process this is where he's going to to to make a change and this is why we should not be uh ever fearful or or or wondering where we stand God is living inside of us us verse 26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I said unto you so we see that process here that the Holy Spirit comes and he teaches us and he brings things to our remembrance chapter 16 verse3 says how be it when he the spirit of truth that come he will guide you into all Truth for he will not speak of himself but whatsoever ye shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come amen now how does he guide us into all truth is he wanting us to to assemble ourselves in some great Seminary to only preach the truth is that the truth that he's talking about did he tell us to do do that no no this is a an individual working with all of us when he comes and he reproves the first nature that you were born with he reproves that nature he says this should not be in your life and that's him guiding you into all truth amen and he he brings things to your remembrance how does he show you or what things does he show you to come what is that what do is he's showing you the new nature that you're to have you're going to be just like him amen he's showing you things to come these are the things that are to come in your life the new nature of Christ a self Christ centered nature second Peter we've read this before 14 says whereby are given to us great exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so that's what we all want to escape right we want to escape the corruption that's in this world through the desires for those things look it uh brother Bram said eve lusted for knowledge how many times we get on our phones and lust to learn something lust to know what's happening you understand what I'm saying amen I I'm just trying to get us to spend more time with God that's it amen look we've all crossed the line I like what Brother Bruce said here we're all we we all need God we all need the blood to cover us we all need to be cleansed and washed and and filled with his Spirit now in order for us to be the real new Tabernacle the New Jerusalem we must have the same nature that God has because he's not going to dwell in a tabernacle that he feels uncomfortable with that's right so most people want to be saved but they could care less about their nature can you say Amen to that I think most people want to be saved but they're not paying any attention about the character but not the bride she's the only one that's got up she's has the revelation of this important aspect in her life that her nature must become like Christ yes not her knowledge but her nature that she acts the way that God acts when there's a problem I mean what makes God to me so super natural he could hang there on the cross and you could say father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing that he really demonstrated turning the cheek he really demonstrated loving his enemies and that is the nature that we must become that you know brother Brandon went on the other side where uh the the other side where there there was no no crying no pain no hurt everything was beautiful he he said that it was perfect love and there was no way to describe how perfect that love was amen and he said whatever you do go after it and get it because God is love and that's what we need to get amen that's the nature he wants to dwell with who in the world would want to dwell with somebody that just only likes him for certain reasons I I a God who created everything do you think he's going to see somebody that that they want to be saved but they they really don't they really want to keep their selfish nature right I I I can't see God saying yeah I'm going to save him and and and I I for sure can't see it being the bride and so God is yes he's calling us up higher but that's okay come up hither look when that magnet went over everything didn't get connected to it right right amen the aluminum didn't the plastic didn't it the tin didn't it it it it was it was just the the things that was uh magnetized that had a magnetism and only the bride has a has a a part of God inside of them and when the word is being preached inside of them they say Lord that is for me that word that you're preaching it's for me I know because I'm your bride am and I'm I'm going to receive that word I'm G to Adorn myself amen I want to attract attract God in the natural in the natural when you met your your sweetheart there was something inside of you that wanted to attract them to you right what one amen and look you have a desire that God would look upon you you want God to put you in a position that's close to him you you are his wife and you're you don't want just to you appreciate him saving you from your sins so much that you just want to be your best for him amen and so how do you Adorn yourself how do you get to where you you attract God his favor on you well what attracts God what attracts him what attracts them as His word amen now listen to this there's God created everything that's right there's nothing Heaven is his throne Earth Is His full to what house will you build me that's right what can we do for God that's going to say oh yeah I wish I would have had that you understand if there's something that he wanted more it would be already made because he's the Creator it he would it would be in his word there's not God can't make anything better than what he's already done right he can't have a better word today amen so this word is what attracts God and when the bride gets all the word there is nothing more that God could love about you than you becoming the word all the word amen and he's not looking for a bride with part he's looking for a wife that's without spot without wrinkle she's Washed by the Water of the word she takes that word and she manifests that word amen I'll say we' we've heard of love at first sight right yes how many times you heard somebody say oh when I seen her when I seen him it was love at first sight I just knew well what the Lord Jesus to me is love at first sight amen and it's Love at Second Sight and third sight fourth sight and every time you come into the house of God and you hear the word being praise there's a love inside you that says God I love you I want to be that for you Lord amen something inside of us is has going to want to please him it can't be just God pleasing us God giving us that's it's a it's a marriage and there's nothing that pleases God more than laying down our life and living this word for him that's we've heard this scripture before it's in 2 Corinthians 3:17 now the Lord is that Spirit where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty amen a lot of times we we may not feel the presence of God like we want to first thing we want to do is look inwardly honestly I believe I could sit in a church with all around me people selfish but I believe if I give the Lord Liberty right here in my heart when that words being preached I will feel the presence of God that's right I tell you can be alone in your prayer closet it don't take long for the presence of the Lord to come if you're serious with God you get down to business and you give God Liberty how do you do that repent repent his presence will come you'll start crying there's no doubt about it because when God like brother darl War says when God squeezes your squeezes a man's heart tears come out of his eyes something happens but we are with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord amen we're changed into the same image of God from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord right so brother brandom said it would be so simple that many would miss it because they're looking well you know how it is we want exciting things we want something we we don't want to who who has ever watched a movie and said this is boring right and you're like I don't want to this is I don't even want to watch this God is in his word it should never be boring amen but if we have to we have to get God to entertain in front of us see we're going to miss it right we're going to miss it we're attracted to the word we're attracted to the word the word is what's so beautiful for the bride am amen all right turn with me to First Corinthians chapter 2 1 Corinthians chapter 2 now God is continuing to reveal more and more to his bride and she is really coming to be more in the same image of Jesus Christ even though the world's going down there and you know how we were taught by the prophet that there's only going to be like one in a million you know just he's he's sending a message that it's not going to be a lot it's just going to be a few and we all we we're like a family right a lot of the family is missing today but we're we're like a family and the thing is we all want to just just believe that we're all going in a Rapture right you know I'd love to say there's nobody here that can stand up here and say who's going and who's not we don't know but I will say this that the righteous scarcely scarcely so so I believe we need to take this word more seriously amen more seriously all right very beautiful words here 1 Corinthians 2:9 says but it is written I Is Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have it entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him wow isn't that beautiful God has something in store for us but God have revealed them unto us Us by his Spirit I'll tell you when God you feel the presence of God come around you when God opens his word to you that is God showing you what is in store for us when we get to heaven [Applause] amen for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man say the spirit Spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God that's right now we have received not the spirit of the world we were born with it but we got rid of it we're crucifying that out amen but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God now what's freely given to us of God the things that that we want that going to be in heaven I'm telling you a double stacker trusted tool is not going to be in heaven we're not going to have a double story trusted tool that's not what he's given us he's given us his nature amen that's what's going to be with us on the other side amen Christ in you the hope of glory amen all right which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for their foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned amen this nature is continually happening or this this this nature change is continually happening inside of us until our will is completely gone 2 Corinthians 5:17 says therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new amen and all things are of God see God is making all of us new not just a new Heaven not just a new Earth but he's making a new you a new you all things are becoming new I love this beloved what manner of love the father bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure thank God that he's making all things new inside of us he's still working on me I got a few quotes I'd like to read if I could from brother brandom he said in the Easter seal he says notice God's life which is in the Greek called Zoey moving through them and in them quickening their minds to his word now let me say it real quietly now the spirit of God that moves amongst the people quickens the minds of the person to the promise of God see it does it look I'm I'm trying to show you and let you realize that I'm speaking now of the church and also quickened to the life in him so it's a real thing the spirit of God moving in our minds as we hear the word that it is a real thing although they only was his attributes to begin with but if God said in this day back in the beginning John Doe will be my servant millions of years ago now John Doe is born in sin shap in iniquity coming into the world speaking lies because he's mortal but maybe he gets a little religious feeling he'll go join a church maybe he'll He he'll join the Pentecostal Church don't know he might join anything but let him get under the atmosphere of God just once see John Doe is bound to recognize who his father is just as that ego recognized who his mother was amen it's got to recognize it see only that John Doe is God's attribute that's right that's become a word spoken and then the Holy Spirit seeks that word out here it is he calls them and gives them everlasting life and brings them into the presence of God which is God's word amen amen says look God had the same when he when he saw Jesus it was the finished work that God finished with Jesus when he said it is finished all all the plan was finished he's just speaking about that that God God is going to complete the work in us just like he completed in Jesus he's going to complete it in us and when the spirit of God comes upon you and you truly are one of God's attributes then he's uh that he's spoken of now if you're not he says you're wandering and frustrate and run here here and there and everything else and never come to the knowledge of the truth what a scary thing I don't want to be wandering I don't want to be floundering I want to know who I am I want to be in my position in my place he says if you are one of those uh the old things pass away right quick see if you're one of those attributes of God if you're one of those the old things are passed away right quick see and you become new and the Plan of Salvation is finished and then you're ready what to obey every word of God that is ever spoken to you I want to read that again then and your Plan of Salvation is finished you're ready to obey every word that God ever spoke to you see for you'll do it because you're submissive to his word amen amen you're you're getting ready you're adorning yourself for the wedding in the message influence brother R says the Bible said their Works do follow them that's right as the Holy Spirit told John on the the Revelation or in the aisle of piss thou must prophesy yet before Kings and Nations and people The Book of Revelations is still prophesying they rest from their labors but their Works follow them their influence that they had still follows them certainly it is but we can influence before we can influence we've got to recognize God we've got to be clean we've got to be humble we've got to get ourselves down and know just keep imagining and knowing how little you are wow you're nothing I'm nothing and none of us is nothing but he is all amen he is worthy of all praise oh lord of gor oh oh Lamb of God what we need is to get back to the temple we need to to go back to the altar of God and and to make an altar in our own Hearts where that we can surrender ourselves and then see the Lord God of hosts come in these last days and do what he did when he was here first and then you'll understand and cry woe is me amen and he says may we all come to the place of that Tabernacle where we can recognize ourselves unclean and live such a life that will influence others to the love of Christ what that ought to be our desire amen amen God is working in each one of us to make us completely new Jesus prayed in John chapter 17 he said that they all may be one when John saw the the New Jerusalem coming down he saw that the the Tabernacle was with man they became one and here Jesus before he goes he's he's praying as it were this last prayer with his disciples that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee and they Also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me and they uh that they may be made perfect in one notice all three verses say be one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me think about that God loves you just as much as he loved Jesus Christ that's and Jesus was a great pattern for us he just he surrendered his life he didn't do anything unless the Lord showed him first and he he just became obedient now look now look we're all humans we all make mistakes but look it ought to be an example for us to start pressing towards amen amen God is making us one and he does that when we hear the word being preached and we're sincere about that word we sayl I want that I want to live that word lord it's it's that that that simple that quiet that real it's it's not always a bunch of Jumping Up and Shout because look this flesh doesn't want to crucify its flesh a lot of times when you know the jumping up and down and everything is when you're not thinking about crucifying your flesh and the spirit will fall on All Flesh right amen amen God is changing us to be one with him one in Hope one in Doctrine one in charity one in his just like he is in his image I I'll tell you this ought to be our goal for this year is to become just like Jesus to live for others I want to live I want to live for others more than I did this year amen amen I've been praying God help me help me to go out and do your work more my time is running out John said hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren God help us to set our our factions on on things above and don't don't let this world get our attention because uh it'll us till the Rapture comes I don't want to be I don't want to be I don't want to miss it I I want to be ready and I I the only way I know that I'm ready is at this moment I'm giving My All to Jesus this moment that's the only way I know I'm ready I I hope you catch what I'm saying amen don't rely on something yesterday don't think you got tomorrow but right now give your all then you know you're ready right now amen we're not going to always feel like we're ready but we've got to believe that he's going to finish the work that he started in us that's what the Bible says he's going to make All Things New in our life let's Stand Together he's going to as we receive the word he's going to add a little here add a little there things are become new in your life I say every week we should see a change in our life may not be major as as we would think but we need to see a change because each week we hear the word and the word changes us and I know sometimes you know it don't happen real quick so you receive the word you receive the the seed you you Ponder on it you pray about it you you start saying God let it come to pass in my life and you see it down the road I understand that but you ought to be seeing Saint things happening for the same thing that happened two months ago right you understand that every week we need to be seeing a change we need to hold oursel accountable if we're not seeing the change that we' like to be seeing then then call on God God God's wanting us to spend time calling on him and saying God make this thing real to me we don't want to miss it for anything don't want to miss it for anything and you know my prayer because I know that in myself I I I'm insufficient I know that God is able to use this office to get us ready I know that but in myself I'm just saying I feel so insufficient and this is one strong reason I believe in a fivefold Ministry because I don't want us to miss it but I do believe this that no matter what vessel is standing here if you're his attribute God will use that vessel to get you what you need to get ready so our confidence is not in our s our confidence is not in our ability our confidence is in God but we must get dressed in the word we must become this new Tabernacle not wait for it to to come down as if you know he's preparing it in our hearts amen I hope you got the message let's just look to him in a word of prayer our heavenly father Lord our dependency is upon you we thank you for your precious word today Lord that you have showed all of us that it is the only thing that we can put our trust in it's the only thing that is true and Lord we have found precious promises in your word that Lord that you're going to see us through that you're going to finish the work that you're you're not going to leave us behind you didn't start a a work in us just just to to to let it sit aside but Lord we're the only ones that can get in the way of the work that you're trying to do father as we come to a close in this 20 23 Lord I pray for your grace in our life I pray that you would give each and every one of us a greater portion of your Holy Spirit in the year to come Lord that we would be able to see your word unfold more and more in our life and that our hunger and our thirst uh for adorning you would grow in 2024 that we would not be uh caught uh wandering in in the the the news of this world as it's going down but Lord we just
