[0:55] may we just have such a sweet communion
[0:57] lord as your holy spirit would just fall
[0:59] down upon us lord
[1:00] just speak to us the things that we're
[1:03] lacking lord the things that we need in
[1:05] our lives lord
[1:06] and father just fill us so full with
[1:09] your holy spirit lord that's all we're
[1:11] thinking about is your plan and purpose
[1:13] lord and father we open these this this
[1:16] holy word lord
[1:18] any man can turn the pages lord but only
[1:20] you can bring that word to life lord
[1:22] that that word lord just live in us lord
[1:25] let the message that we hear today from
[1:27] you lord that it be it's a lived out
[1:29] life lord
[1:30] we love you and thank you lord jesus
[1:33] christ
[1:35] we can be seated uh real fast
[1:38] um just want to share a little testimony
[1:41] about how we got to this point i guess
[1:42] um you know here today
[1:44] uh so it all started back in september
[1:47] of last year late september i went to
[1:49] the men's meeting
[1:50] and i'll tell you one thing from that
[1:52] men's meeting i was just changed
[1:55] i haven't been the same person since
[1:56] then
[1:58] those those meetings just it just
[1:59] changed me that's all i can say and i
[2:01] remember i think like a week after the
[2:03] men's meeting uh i was sitting on my bed
[2:05] studying from the men's meeting and the
[2:07] lord just spoke and said i want you to
[2:09] preach and i'm like huh
[2:10] and i was just i thought maybe it was
[2:12] just you know maybe just me just you
[2:14] know thinking it and then i just i just
[2:16] couldn't some of my heart i couldn't let
[2:17] it go it just wouldn't stop and then i
[2:19] didn't talk to brother john about it and
[2:23] i just knew the lord wanted me to preach
[2:24] and just like what song leading the same
[2:26] thing i was running away from song
[2:27] leading and i i learned
[2:29] when the lord is calling you to do
[2:30] something don't run away so when i heard
[2:32] the lord speak that to me and i was like
[2:33] all right lord this is your will
[2:35] i want to do it
[2:37] and
[2:38] i also want to just you know it's an
[2:39] honor and privilege to be behind here
[2:41] it's a sacred uh position and
[2:44] i just want to treat you with the utmost
[2:45] respect
[2:47] because you know when the lord you know
[2:48] when the lord calls you something he's
[2:50] entrusting you
[2:51] with this with the people because i'm
[2:53] responsible if i preach anything wrong
[2:56] i'm responsible
[2:57] and so uh i just want to just want to
[2:59] thank the lord for his opportunity to
[3:00] thank brother john for letting me be
[3:02] behind here and having the faith for me
[3:04] to be behind here
[3:05] and uh
[3:06] if we could rise
[3:08] we'll
[3:09] open up in matthew chapter five verse
[3:11] six
[3:13] and uh
[3:14] say amen when you're turning there
[3:21] probably very very familiar scripture to
[3:23] all of us
[3:24] blessed are they which do hunger and
[3:26] thirst after righteousness for they
[3:28] shall be filled now this isn't just
[3:30] something just something that is said
[3:32] but this is a promise that jesus spoke
[3:34] to us
[3:35] so if you're truly hungering and
[3:36] thirsting after righteousness you will
[3:38] be filled
[3:39] it didn't say part way but if the thing
[3:41] is you have to really really hunger and
[3:43] thirst after righteousness and you will
[3:45] be filled
[3:46] i like to entitle this message
[3:48] what's your appetite and for a subject
[3:51] hunger
[3:52] may be seated
[3:54] so i look the word righteousness up
[3:56] it's applied to god the perfection or
[3:59] holiness of his nature
[4:01] exact risk and faithfulness
[4:03] so the thing is we can't be righteous on
[4:05] our own
[4:06] it's the righteousness of god inside of
[4:08] you that makes you righteous so it's
[4:10] nothing that you've done
[4:11] nothing that you you can work towards
[4:13] you know
[4:14] the righteousness the thing is
[4:16] righteousness is always of god and we're
[4:18] called to be holy like god
[4:21] and so i look the word up hunger
[4:23] it's an easy sensation occasion by the
[4:26] want of food a craving of food by the
[4:28] stomach craving appetite hunger is not
[4:31] merely want a food or a person or for
[4:34] the person when he's sick maybe staying
[4:36] long from eating without hunger or an
[4:38] appetite or food hunger therefore is the
[4:40] pain of or uneasiness of the stomach of
[4:43] a healthy person when too long destitute
[4:45] of food question i want to pose to you
[4:47] guys is
[4:49] have you been hungering on the things of
[4:51] god like you need to be
[4:53] has those things have crept in that have
[4:55] caused your hunger to go away
[4:58] because the thing is if we're not hungry
[5:00] for god
[5:01] then we're hungry for the devil in the
[5:03] world
[5:04] and when that creeps in that's when
[5:06] problems start to happen that's when you
[5:07] start to get uh
[5:09] uneasy unrestless
[5:11] the fruits of the holy spirit they don't
[5:13] they're not manifesting their life like
[5:14] they need to be
[5:15] so if we can realize that we need to
[5:18] be hungry daily
[5:20] hourly minutely on the things of god you
[5:23] see god's looking for a believer who is
[5:25] fully sold out to him he can turn the
[5:28] word upside down with one person fully
[5:30] surrendered to him
[5:32] so my question is what are you hungry
[5:34] for what things are you hungry for this
[5:36] very moment is the hungering for the
[5:38] pleasures of this life choking your walk
[5:40] with the lord or is the hungering for a
[5:42] closer walk of jesus christ kicking the
[5:44] pleasures of life about of this life out
[5:48] they say you are what you eat so if
[5:50] you're feeding on the things of god then
[5:52] you're gonna be start becoming the
[5:53] morning image of jesus christ but if
[5:55] you're feeding on the things of the
[5:56] world if you're feeding too much on
[5:58] politics on whatever it is you fill in
[5:59] the blank tv shows then you're gonna
[6:02] become what those tv shows those
[6:03] politics because i mean politics i'm not
[6:06] saying don't be informed but don't let
[6:09] the politics engulf your life that's
[6:11] right because the thing is i want to be
[6:13] engulfed by jesus i want when people see
[6:16] me they don't recognize me but to see
[6:18] jesus in me
[6:19] so
[6:20] i worry a little quote uh that i think
[6:22] really fits along with just this message
[6:24] here not long ago i was in the west
[6:26] heard of an indian got converted said
[6:28] how you feeling chief after a few days
[6:31] he said well pretty good and pretty bad
[6:33] said what do you mean pretty good
[6:35] said uh well since i got saved said
[6:37] there's two dogs in me
[6:39] said one's black and one's white and
[6:41] they just fight all the time
[6:43] said the black dog wants me to do bad
[6:45] and the good dog wants me to do good or
[6:47] the white dog wants me to do good said
[6:49] which one wins chief
[6:51] said huh depends on which one she feeds
[6:54] the most that's it the thing that's in
[6:57] your heart now telling you that is that
[6:59] is god's truth that's the baptism of the
[7:01] holy ghost is the way and god's
[7:03] preparation today is the holy spirit the
[7:06] blood washed church regenerated filled
[7:08] with the holy ghost signs and wonders of
[7:11] vindicating and proving that he's with
[7:13] it that thing that's telling you that
[7:16] feed that a few minutes you'll be number
[7:18] one of them that's right amen so i
[7:20] really i just really love that it's so
[7:21] simple simple
[7:23] the things you eat you're gonna become
[7:26] so the food saying with food if you eat
[7:28] bad food
[7:29] you're going to become that bad food
[7:30] you're going to feel bad all the time if
[7:32] you're feeding vegetables you know baked
[7:35] chicken grilled chicken those things
[7:37] you're going to you're going to feel a
[7:38] lot better and you'll be more sharpness
[7:40] in your mind we don't think of that a
[7:41] lot of times that
[7:43] our body is a temple spiritually and
[7:45] physically so the things you're feeding
[7:47] on so if you like i said before we feed
[7:48] not only on fast food then your body is
[7:51] going to be as sharp as it needs to be
[7:52] just like with sleep as well if you're
[7:54] not sleeping properly then it's going to
[7:56] be hard for you to enter in because your
[7:58] body you're human and you need rest i'm
[8:01] not saying there's not times where you
[8:02] know sometimes you know things happen in
[8:04] your life where you can't get rest but i
[8:06] think sometimes we make such bad habits
[8:08] just like our walk with god we don't
[8:10] spend more time with them and it turns
[8:12] into a bad habit and that's how all
[8:14] these problems happen in our life and
[8:15] the thing is don't wait to get desperate
[8:18] when you go on the when you're in the
[8:19] valley and the hard times but be
[8:21] desperate on the mountaintop
[8:22] because you're desperate on the
[8:23] mountaintop you won't have to you don't
[8:25] have to you know what things won't
[8:26] surprise you as much
[8:29] so
[8:29] um let's turn uh jeremiah 29 probably
[8:32] very affirmative scripture to all of us
[8:37] amen praise the lord and we'll start
[8:40] with verse 11
[8:41] for i know the thoughts that i think
[8:43] toward you sayeth the lord
[8:46] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[8:48] give you an expected end
[8:51] then shall you call upon me and you
[8:53] shall go and pray unto me
[8:55] and i will hearken unto you
[8:57] and you shall seek me and find me when
[9:00] you search for me with all your heart it
[9:02] doesn't say part of your heart 50 in
[9:04] your heart 25 it says all of your heart
[9:06] says that for a reason because the lord
[9:08] he wants first place
[9:10] he doesn't want second place he doesn't
[9:12] want uh
[9:13] he wants first place as simple as that
[9:15] and if if we can get more like i said
[9:17] before if we can get on our knees
[9:20] and not leave until we meet with god
[9:22] that's when the change is going to
[9:23] happen
[9:25] don't just assume oh i think i met with
[9:26] the lord but no say lord i'm not leaving
[9:28] my knees until i know that i met with
[9:30] you that's the type of hunger and the
[9:32] thirsting we need in our walks this day
[9:34] and age is getting darker and darker by
[9:36] the minute
[9:37] and
[9:38] the thing is he's knocking on the heart
[9:39] of your door constantly daily
[9:42] let him in he wants to communion with
[9:44] you wants to sup with you don't be like
[9:45] the other other believers of the
[9:46] churches they're having jesus without
[9:48] you know without he's not even in the
[9:50] church and they think he's in the church
[9:52] same thing in your houses don't just
[9:54] assume he's there know he's there invite
[9:56] him he wants he wants to be invited in
[9:59] uh let's go to deuteronomy six uh we
[10:02] actually read that on sunday actually
[10:09] get there myself
[10:14] you don't realize how far back it is
[10:15] sometimes
[10:19] so deuteronomy 6 verse 4 we'll start
[10:22] right there
[10:24] so it says
[10:25] hear o israel the lord our god is one
[10:28] lord
[10:29] and thou shalt love the lord thy god
[10:31] with all thy heart and with all thy soul
[10:33] and with all thy might
[10:35] you that's a reoccurring theme right
[10:37] there
[10:38] because you know god just really wants
[10:39] to be
[10:41] he wants to be he wants wants to be the
[10:43] soul in your life he wants to take care
[10:45] of you spiritually and physically he
[10:47] wants us to make himself known to you
[10:49] but the thing is you have to make that
[10:51] choice
[10:52] you have to you have to say lord i want
[10:54] to know you more than life itself that's
[10:56] the kind of desperation you need if you
[10:57] want to get to know
[10:59] and i'll go to verse six and these words
[11:01] which i command me this day shall be in
[11:03] my heart
[11:05] see the thing is
[11:06] we we hear a sermon
[11:09] and the thing is sometimes we get so
[11:11] caught up in oh i heard this word before
[11:13] or you know fill in the blank and the
[11:14] thing is
[11:16] every service every wednesday every
[11:18] sunday every special service that's a
[11:20] time for you to hear from god and to
[11:22] apply that to your life
[11:24] thing is this this word isn't just to be
[11:27] read like some encyclopedia or some
[11:29] history book this word is to be lived
[11:31] yet the spirit of this word has to be
[11:33] living inside of you that's how others
[11:34] are going to be won over to christ
[11:36] not by you trying to make a marked
[11:38] convert or whatever it is
[11:41] and it's so easy you know to you know
[11:42] connect with somebody in the flesh but
[11:44] the thing is care about their spiritual
[11:46] well-being
[11:48] because
[11:48] you can have a good conversation all day
[11:50] and all night but that's not going to do
[11:51] anything they're going to forget about
[11:52] that conversation but we're not going to
[11:54] forget about is the impact
[11:56] of you leading them to christ that
[11:58] impact would never be forgotten
[11:59] especially that souls won over they'll
[12:01] never forget that never forget you
[12:03] because you'll be connected to that
[12:04] person
[12:06] let's go to mark 12 29.
[12:14] amen
[12:18] 12 29
[12:20] and it says and jesus answered him
[12:23] the first of all the commandments is
[12:24] hero israel the lord our god is one lord
[12:28] now shall love the lord thy god with all
[12:30] thy heart
[12:31] with all thy soul with all thy mind and
[12:34] with all thy strength
[12:35] if you notice it's
[12:37] i love how he's like you know putting
[12:38] all these things you know because his
[12:40] mind body soul and your spirit all these
[12:41] things you got to love the lord and
[12:43] because many people say i love the lord
[12:45] up here
[12:47] but they lack the love relationship
[12:50] because even the devils believe there's
[12:51] one guy they believe that jesus christ
[12:53] is the son of god they believe all these
[12:54] things but there's no life in that and
[12:56] the thing is he he just shouldn't be
[12:59] your savior but he should be your lord
[13:00] and savior if you give him lordship and
[13:03] ownership shows that you really love him
[13:04] and he can trust you but until we get to
[13:07] that point
[13:08] it can't just be some head knowledge you
[13:10] can't just be like i said reading this
[13:11] word and some head knowledge can't be
[13:12] praying just repetitiously
[13:14] because there's no
[13:16] there's no sacrifice in that as we heard
[13:18] we heard in the men's meeting the lord
[13:19] is looking for an obedient vessel that's
[13:22] willing to sacrifice and get on his
[13:24] knees and suffer get dirty
[13:26] disciple in somebody
[13:28] that's how you truly show the lord's
[13:30] movement in your life
[13:31] not to say i'm a christian for 20 years
[13:33] 15 years 5 years
[13:35] action speaks louder than words your
[13:37] life's going to prove if you really have
[13:38] the goods
[13:40] and do you realize each new day
[13:42] you have a chance to reach new heights
[13:44] with jesus
[13:45] you can develop a closer even more
[13:47] personal walk with him daily be hungry
[13:50] for a deeper walk with god
[13:52] because you're still on this earth for a
[13:53] reason there's still work for you to do
[13:56] you remember when when jesus was on that
[13:58] cross
[13:59] he he literally done everything that he
[14:01] was supposed to do
[14:03] if you were to die tomorrow
[14:05] or an hour could you say lord i've done
[14:07] everything you asked me to do
[14:09] because there's still so much for us to
[14:11] do time is running short there's still
[14:13] souls out there otherwise we'll be gone
[14:15] god's still trying to show you things in
[14:17] your life that you need to work out
[14:18] things you need to add to your life
[14:20] be hungry and say lord show me those
[14:22] things that i'm missing or that i forgot
[14:26] and um i said i'm not talking about a
[14:28] head knowledge walk because you know
[14:30] anybody can say i have a walk with god
[14:32] you know oh yeah you know god said this
[14:34] to me and uh three years ago
[14:37] the thing is i'm not saying don't forget
[14:38] about those past things he's done
[14:40] but don't just focus on those things
[14:42] press towards new testimonies i remember
[14:45] a brother told me at the men's meeting i
[14:47] experienced the brothers he said you
[14:49] should uh have a testimony of god moving
[14:51] every day in your life not just him just
[14:53] waking you up in the morning or giving
[14:55] you this but how is god moving your life
[14:57] right now today what is he doing
[15:01] are you expressing that testimony to
[15:03] others other lost souls
[15:06] and um let's go to romans 5 8.
[15:15] i'm sorry
[15:17] eight five forgive me
[15:24] so verse 5 for they that are after the
[15:26] flesh do the mind the things of the
[15:28] flesh
[15:29] but they that are after the spirit the
[15:31] things of the spirit
[15:33] for to be carnally minded is what death
[15:37] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[15:39] peace
[15:40] because the carnal mind is enmity
[15:42] against god so your head walk is enmity
[15:46] against god
[15:50] it says
[15:51] for it is not subject to the law of god
[15:52] neither indeed can it be so your flesh
[15:57] your flesh walk cannot be
[15:59] you can't get anywhere with it it's
[16:00] vanity at best even a man at best is
[16:03] vanity the scripture tells us
[16:05] so we can realize that
[16:08] that when we come to church we come to
[16:10] worship
[16:11] you understand we have problems all
[16:13] these things but god is over all those
[16:15] problems he deserves your best worship
[16:18] because you think about this you come
[16:19] with a bad attitude it's going to affect
[16:21] the whole service for somebody you can
[16:23] even grieve the presence of god you're
[16:25] not wanting to worship you can grieve
[16:26] the presence of god
[16:27] the thing is he's worth it he literally
[16:29] died upon a cross he even knew what it
[16:32] would took he knew the pain and
[16:33] suffering he had took and he still did
[16:35] it with love right so why can't we come
[16:37] into church and worship
[16:38] i see it sometimes we are just you know
[16:40] just going through the motions
[16:42] it's not about motions it's a love
[16:44] relationship
[16:45] let's get in love with god let's get
[16:47] more in love with god i should say amen
[16:50] uh verse
[16:51] verse eight so then they they're in the
[16:53] flesh cannot please god you can't even
[16:55] please god i mean you can do all the
[16:57] sacrificing you want
[16:58] but if you're in the flesh it's not
[16:59] gonna do anything right obedience is
[17:01] better than sacrifice
[17:04] um so
[17:06] just remember that the flesh
[17:08] our flesh can be
[17:11] we gotta
[17:12] crucify that's what we gotta do simple
[17:13] as that crucify your flesh it's so
[17:15] simple
[17:16] we just make it so hard sometimes
[17:17] because we we just like
[17:19] living in the flesh we like doing
[17:20] worldly pleasure because it feels good
[17:23] sin may be beautiful but it's rotten to
[17:25] the core
[17:28] so let's go to psalm 62
[17:31] verse 1.
[17:34] i love the book of psalms because david
[17:36] was a man of desperation
[17:38] sometimes he may have been up and down
[17:39] but he was honest about being up and
[17:41] down
[17:42] the thing is we got to be honest to god
[17:44] don't try to put some put on that you're
[17:47] some big strong person that nothing
[17:49] affects you
[17:50] we all cry
[17:52] we all have trials we have tribulations
[17:54] we all make mistakes we all disbelieve
[17:56] sometimes be honest like that man said
[17:58] help my own belief i believe you but
[18:00] help my own belief
[18:01] god will be more pleased with that
[18:02] honesty than you trying to put a put on
[18:04] of having faith and not have you know
[18:06] having that faith but not really having
[18:08] it
[18:09] so verse 62 verse 1 says
[18:12] truly my soul waiteth upon god
[18:15] from him
[18:16] cometh my salvation
[18:18] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[18:21] is my defense i shall not be greatly
[18:24] moved amen verse five he repeats it
[18:26] again my soul wait thou only upon god
[18:30] from expectation is from him
[18:33] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[18:36] is my defense and i shall not be moved
[18:39] so we're going through a trial let's be
[18:40] like a tree that's planted by the water
[18:43] let no winds
[18:45] no
[18:46] enemies spears
[18:47] move you
[18:48] let's just be remember branham said
[18:52] you know trials and tribulations are to
[18:53] kind of shake you but to what to deepen
[18:55] your roots
[18:56] get deeper rooted in god
[18:59] um verse 7
[19:01] and god is my salvation and my glory the
[19:04] rock of my strength and my refuge is in
[19:06] god your your safe place is in god
[19:09] your secret pavilion is in god whatever
[19:12] he's a high priest that can be touched
[19:14] by the feeling of infirmities he was a
[19:16] man just like you and i
[19:18] he he cried he felt pain he needed sleep
[19:21] so think about the very god of heaven
[19:22] knows exactly what you're going through
[19:24] and what you're feeling it so don't
[19:26] think god is somewhere out there
[19:28] he's right in here
[19:31] it says trust in him at all times
[19:33] doesn't say trust in him
[19:34] sometimes or part of the time but says
[19:37] at all times no matter the situation
[19:39] don't give me excuses just trust in him
[19:42] ye people says pour out your heart
[19:44] before him god is a refuge for us selah
[19:47] so think about that he says pour your
[19:49] heart out to him
[19:50] hunger forum say lord i need more of you
[19:53] i can't i can't face this trial without
[19:55] more of you i can't wait to witness
[19:58] witness to this person without more of
[19:59] you i need you to be front and center
[20:03] i just want to just be a vessel used for
[20:05] your kingdom
[20:07] verse nine surely men of low degree are
[20:10] vanity and men of high degree are a lie
[20:12] to be laid in balance they are all
[20:14] together lighter than vanity it says
[20:15] trust not no oppression
[20:17] and become not vain in riches or sorry
[20:19] become not vain in robbery if riches
[20:22] increase
[20:23] set not your heart upon them i look at
[20:25] the word of oppression
[20:26] it's the state of being oppressed over
[20:28] burden and misery i think sometimes when
[20:31] we go through hardships in our lives
[20:33] we get overburdened and worried because
[20:35] the thing is we're trying to
[20:37] worry about things that aren't
[20:39] our control worry about the things that
[20:41] you can control i can control whether
[20:43] i'm going to believe god or not i can't
[20:45] control what a b and c person's gonna do
[20:48] to me i can't
[20:49] the thing is we get as humans
[20:52] we're so used to trying to be in control
[20:54] of everything try to orchestrate
[20:56] everything we're not god we're not
[20:58] that's right if god's put you in this
[20:59] trial for a reason let's say lord what
[21:01] are you trying to show me what do i need
[21:03] to work on
[21:04] how what kind of character building do
[21:05] you want me to be shaped and molded in
[21:07] me
[21:08] because all the times we ask god why why
[21:10] why why why say lord i'm in this trial i
[21:13] want a girl
[21:14] i want a girl
[21:16] um verse 11.
[21:18] god has spoken once twice have i heard
[21:21] this that power belonged to god
[21:24] amen also unto thee oh lord belongeth
[21:26] what mercy for thou rendez to every man
[21:29] according to his work
[21:31] we're gonna jump down to verse 63 or
[21:33] sorry
[21:34] uh
[21:35] yeah chapter 63. i said i i always it's
[21:38] one of my i think one of my favorite
[21:40] psalms because i i love this verse one
[21:42] right here
[21:43] oh god
[21:44] thou are my god early will i seek thee
[21:48] my soul thirsted for thee my flesh
[21:51] longed for thee in a dry and thirsty
[21:53] land where no water is let's talk about
[21:54] the desperation and hungering that david
[21:57] had right there just imagine you're in a
[21:58] desert you haven't had water for days
[22:02] you're really thirsty so why can't we be
[22:04] that thirsty for god
[22:06] why can't we be that hungry for god
[22:08] because i think sometimes we make
[22:10] ourselves so busy
[22:12] that god is just kind of just penciled
[22:14] in somewhere
[22:15] and that's not right that's not fair to
[22:16] god he doesn't want to be penciled in
[22:19] you make that time
[22:21] because the thing i think as human
[22:22] beings
[22:23] we make time we make things for other
[22:25] things like whatever it is tv or uh
[22:28] whatever it is you fill in the blank i
[22:29] don't know you guys know what you guys
[22:31] do
[22:32] and the thing is i believe if we would
[22:34] just say lord i don't care how long it
[22:36] takes to get your presence i'm getting
[22:37] in your presence
[22:40] the thing is you gotta humble yourself
[22:41] you have to humble yourself even the
[22:43] scripture tells us to do that even said
[22:44] a humble and contrite spirit and no wise
[22:46] will i despise
[22:48] so he says to see thy power and thy
[22:50] glory let me reverse one again i love it
[22:52] oh god
[22:54] thou are my god early will i seek thee
[22:57] my soul thirsted for thee my flesh
[22:59] longer for thee in a dry and thirsty
[23:01] land where no water is to see thy power
[23:04] and thy glory so as i have seen me in
[23:06] the sanctuary says because thy love
[23:09] kindness is better than life my lips
[23:12] shall praise thee
[23:15] verse 4 thus will i bless thee while i
[23:17] live i will lift up my hands in thy name
[23:20] my soul shall be satisfied as with meryl
[23:23] and fatness
[23:24] my mouth shall praise thee with joyful
[23:27] lips
[23:28] when i remember thee upon my bed and
[23:30] meditated
[23:31] meditate on me in the night watches
[23:33] because thou has been my help therefore
[23:35] in the shadow of thy wings where i
[23:37] rejoice
[23:39] so no matter what things are thrown your
[23:42] way
[23:43] never
[23:44] not be thankful for what god is doing
[23:46] for you
[23:48] i think a lot of times we get so
[23:49] discouraged
[23:50] because we're looking for
[23:52] things that we don't have but we're not
[23:53] looking right now what god has been
[23:55] doing in our life right now
[23:58] god has been so good to us i mean
[24:00] beautiful church
[24:01] your health
[24:03] all these things he's giving you a lot
[24:04] of some people don't even have good
[24:06] health some people are in a hospital bed
[24:09] on ventilators struggling for life just
[24:11] gasping for air
[24:13] use what god is giving you use that
[24:15] health that he's giving you you're you
[24:16] have two arms two feet
[24:18] you have all these things god's given
[24:19] you use it for the kingdom of god
[24:22] dedicate your whole body to the kingdom
[24:23] of god
[24:25] um let's go to psalms
[24:28] i'm sorry psalms 27. i look the word
[24:31] thirst up
[24:32] say want an eager desire after anything
[24:36] and i look love kindness up as well
[24:37] loving kindness it says tender regard
[24:40] mercy and favor that's what god has to
[24:42] you
[24:43] tender regard he has mercy and favor
[24:46] and just think the very god of heaven
[24:48] loved you so much
[24:50] that he wanted to die for you
[24:52] and live inside of you that's love right
[24:54] there
[24:56] this just realizing what it cost every
[24:58] sin that you've committed
[24:59] every sin that the world committed from
[25:01] the beginning and
[25:02] he literally took every sin that adam
[25:04] committed every sin that i'll commit
[25:06] from the day i was born to the day i
[25:07] would die
[25:08] everybody in the world he did that just
[25:09] imagine the pain and agony he did it for
[25:12] you amen did it for me
[25:15] um sorry psalms 27 verse 4
[25:19] says
[25:20] one thing have i desired of the lord
[25:22] that i will seek after
[25:24] notice that seek part
[25:26] you have to seek him that's the key
[25:28] right there he's not going to force
[25:29] himself upon you he's waiting for the
[25:31] believer to truly seek him
[25:34] after that i may dwell in the house of
[25:35] the lord
[25:37] all the days of my life to behold the
[25:39] beauty
[25:41] of the lord and to inquire in his temple
[25:44] verse 7
[25:45] hear o lord when i cry
[25:47] with my voice have mercy also upon me
[25:50] and answer
[25:51] when thou said is seek ye my face my
[25:53] heart said unto thee thy face lord i
[25:55] will seek
[25:56] how many times have you been in prayer
[25:58] and you didn't feel like going on your
[26:00] knees and surrendered to god
[26:02] pretty sure we all felt that quite a few
[26:04] times
[26:05] that's the time pray hardest when it's
[26:07] hard to pray that's the time that's
[26:08] really when the blessing's going to come
[26:10] that pres his presence is going to come
[26:12] more if he's going to come because it's
[26:13] easy to when everything's lined up and
[26:16] you got the time to do it it's easy to
[26:18] do it then but we don't have that time
[26:19] that's when it's really hard to pray you
[26:21] say oh lord you know i'll pray for five
[26:22] minutes maybe seven minutes the thing is
[26:25] when everything's just you know just
[26:26] falling apart
[26:28] just getting your knees say lord i don't
[26:30] care what's going on i don't care what
[26:31] obligations i have right now yeah i want
[26:33] to spend some time with you that's
[26:35] really going to touch the heart that's
[26:36] what touches the heart of god
[26:38] that's when the test really the testing
[26:39] time happens because like i said once
[26:41] again it's easy to when everything's
[26:43] going good you're in a mountain top but
[26:45] we're in that valley how are you
[26:47] reacting to things how are you
[26:49] how's your prayer life is your prayer
[26:50] life subpar
[26:52] or is it you know is it growing
[26:54] constantly
[26:56] um i'm freaking forgive me uh
[26:58] verse seven i've read that already let's
[27:00] go to verse
[27:02] 14.
[27:03] it says wait in the lord be of good
[27:05] courage and he shall strengthen thy
[27:07] heart wait i say on the lord
[27:10] that's another promise in this word
[27:11] right here
[27:12] wait on the lord it says be of good
[27:14] courage
[27:15] and he shall strengthen thy heart
[27:17] and when you're being a good courage
[27:18] you're not worrying about the outcome
[27:20] you're not worrying about situations
[27:23] you're just saying you just lord you
[27:24] promise this he likes to be reminded of
[27:26] his work he loves to be reminded of his
[27:28] word
[27:29] it's claiming in faith
[27:31] so to seek the word seek means
[27:34] to go and search or a quest
[27:37] to look for
[27:38] to search by from going from place to
[27:41] place
[27:42] so just like you know i'm pretty sure
[27:43] you guys watch movies you know they're
[27:45] looking for the king arthur sword
[27:46] whatever it is you know they were they
[27:48] really wanted to find it they were like
[27:50] i'm finding this thing no matter what it
[27:51] takes how much resource it takes how
[27:52] much money it takes so let's be like
[27:54] that with god god i'm willing i want to
[27:56] find you where where are you at where am
[27:58] i missing you
[28:00] if there's anything i've done to grieve
[28:01] you i mean what lord what have i done
[28:04] let's go to psalms 25
[28:07] that's a couple over
[28:09] and we'll start with verse number four
[28:13] shoot me that way shoot me thy ways o
[28:15] lord teach me thy past
[28:17] lead me in thy truth if he knows that
[28:20] that prayer right there
[28:22] it's nothing about my wants my needs i i
[28:25] need a i need a car you know whatever it
[28:26] is he's just saying lord
[28:28] lead me in that truth teach me i'm not
[28:30] saying we can't pray for those things
[28:32] but he said but seek ye first the
[28:34] kingdom of god and there's righteousness
[28:36] and all these things should be added
[28:37] unto you so he knows what you need he
[28:39] knows he needs a house he knows he needs
[28:40] a car he knows you need money he knows
[28:42] all these things
[28:43] but this is the type of prayer really
[28:44] touches god like when solomon when he
[28:46] was praying
[28:47] he didn't ask for all these
[28:49] uh these
[28:50] you know physical things like you know
[28:52] money and prosperity and all these
[28:53] things he just wanted wisdom
[28:56] to help god's people and
[28:58] that's part of discipleship right there
[29:00] ask god for wisdom lord i don't know how
[29:02] to reach this brother just give me the
[29:04] wisdom how can i connect with him to
[29:06] lead him closer to you because iron
[29:07] sharpens iron right
[29:10] says leave me in thy truth and teach me
[29:12] for thou art the god of my salvation and
[29:15] on thee do i wait all the day
[29:17] remember oh lord thy tender mercies and
[29:19] thy loving kindness for they have been
[29:21] ever of old they kind of remind me just
[29:23] reminding god of his his scripture of
[29:26] his his holy precious ways
[29:28] david's just reminding god and i think
[29:30] god loves god's pleas when you do that
[29:32] it says remember not the sins of my
[29:34] youth
[29:35] nor my transgressions
[29:37] according to thy mercy remember thou me
[29:39] for thy goodness sake o lord
[29:42] good and upright is the lord amen
[29:44] therefore will he teach sinners in the
[29:46] way
[29:47] the meek will he guide in judgment and
[29:49] the meek will he teaches way that's
[29:51] right
[29:53] all the paths of the lord are mercy and
[29:55] truth unto such as what keep his
[29:57] covenant in his testimonies if you
[29:58] notice that like uh i won't say a clause
[30:01] but
[30:01] it's all the pastor lord our mercy and
[30:03] truth and it says
[30:05] unto such
[30:06] as keep his covenant his testimonies a
[30:09] lot of people want the blessings of god
[30:11] without paying the price
[30:14] and the thing is god isn't some doty
[30:16] grandfather
[30:17] he's a god who he expects the more he is
[30:20] giving you the more truth he's giving he
[30:22] expects more out of you
[30:23] so don't just be
[30:25] you know just be satisfied with just
[30:27] giving god your bare minimum
[30:29] he expects so much more his standards
[30:31] are up here i think our standards we
[30:32] like to we like subpar
[30:35] he says my ways are not your ways and my
[30:36] thoughts are not your thoughts
[30:38] so if we can get more and
[30:40] holding our standards up here
[30:42] that's when we can grow cause it's so
[30:44] easy to put your standards down here
[30:46] that's easy
[30:47] you know i'm gonna do a bare minimum and
[30:48] just call it a day yeah it's easy but
[30:50] when you go the extra mile that's when
[30:52] it gets harder
[30:54] um
[30:55] verse 10 yeah i'll reverse it one more
[30:58] time all the paths of the lord are mercy
[31:00] and truth
[31:01] so no matter what trial you're going
[31:02] through there's mercy and truth in that
[31:03] trial don't ever forget that
[31:05] unto such as keep his covenant in his
[31:07] testimonies
[31:09] and uh
[31:10] go to ver uh little psalms five
[31:16] amen
[31:17] amen
[31:18] and we'll read one in one verse in here
[31:21] and it says my voice shalt thou hear in
[31:24] the morning o lord in the morning while
[31:26] i direct my prayer unto thee and i will
[31:28] look up
[31:29] something i
[31:30] i love doing is praying in the morning
[31:32] because you're really you're really
[31:33] putting god first because the first
[31:34] thing you get up in the morning your
[31:36] flesh does not want to serve god it
[31:38] never wants to serve god and if it does
[31:40] it wants to serve god the bare minimum
[31:42] way
[31:43] the thing is first thing you should do
[31:44] just get up get in your knees
[31:47] just enter into god
[31:49] and then your day is gonna it's gonna
[31:50] help your day start right then and there
[31:52] because it's so easy to get caught up i
[31:54] gotta do this and that net net be still
[31:57] and know that he's god
[32:00] and i'm going to flip one page back and
[32:02] go to psalms 1.
[32:06] so it says blessed is the man that
[32:07] walketh not in the counsel of the
[32:08] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[32:11] sinners nor sitteth in the sea of the
[32:12] scornful or you can even imagine you
[32:15] know
[32:16] you know blessed is a man that doesn't
[32:18] follow his own will imagine that because
[32:20] because that's ungodliness right there
[32:23] because the thing is your will
[32:25] is not always going to match god's will
[32:27] i'll tell you that probably nine times
[32:28] out of ten it's not i give you maybe one
[32:30] percent so maybe one percent you might
[32:32] but other times it's going to be
[32:34] i want to do this i want to do this i
[32:35] want to do that and we never ask god
[32:37] what can i do for you today how can i
[32:39] help your kingdom increase and grow
[32:41] that's the type of hungering god is
[32:43] looking for that's what he's looking for
[32:44] in a believer especially in this day and
[32:46] age
[32:47] because
[32:47] if you look we go we're going to
[32:48] revelations chapter 3 in a little bit
[32:51] but the believer or the
[32:53] the believer in this day is tempted with
[32:55] so many things
[32:56] you got these on my cell phone we got
[32:57] all these cell phones with
[33:00] anything you could imagine on there
[33:01] internet google anything imagine on
[33:04] there you can do it's a computer
[33:05] literally in your pocket
[33:07] it's a tv in your pocket
[33:09] and they're a blessing and a cursing
[33:11] because i see kids in this day and asian
[33:13] generation they're all just so sucked up
[33:15] in social media
[33:17] and it's poison it's poi it's literally
[33:19] it's poison it's negativity and so i'm
[33:20] not saying social media isn't good
[33:22] because you can keep up with
[33:23] missionaries and family members
[33:24] but i think it's social media is just
[33:27] called such a division in this country
[33:29] and in this world it really has
[33:32] and if we let's uh
[33:34] verse two i'm sorry
[33:36] so it says but his delight is in the law
[33:38] of the lord and in his law doth he
[33:40] meditate day and night
[33:42] in what he should be like a tree planted
[33:44] by the rivers of water
[33:46] that bringeth forth his fruit see thing
[33:48] is as believers we need fruit
[33:51] we have to we need fruit daily
[33:53] god is trying god is
[33:54] cutting off the stuff that's dead
[33:57] and stuff that's live too he wants more
[33:58] fruit out of that he's looking for fruit
[34:00] in your life not just you saying stuff
[34:03] but fruit
[34:05] because people should people shouldn't
[34:06] know people shouldn't have to
[34:08] hear you say you're christian all the
[34:10] time for them to know that you're a
[34:11] christian they should just see your
[34:13] mannerisms your conversations the way
[34:15] you conduct yourself
[34:17] so that's the kind of life that
[34:19] when people saw jesus
[34:21] he had to say oh i got authority you
[34:22] know i'm the son of god i'm the most
[34:24] high he didn't have to say that the way
[34:26] he the way he lived his life showed the
[34:28] authority that he had and god has given
[34:30] each one of us authority and you
[34:32] shouldn't have to husbands
[34:34] you know we we shouldn't you know his
[34:35] husband we don't have to tell our wife
[34:37] i'm not speaking for myself but you
[34:39] shouldn't tell your wife you know i'm
[34:40] the head of this house i have the
[34:41] authority
[34:42] no you know what you shouldn't always
[34:44] have to remind your wife that you have
[34:45] authority
[34:47] because jesus never had to remind his
[34:49] disciples oh i have authority you know
[34:50] this no you know i'm you know i'm head
[34:52] over you he didn't they just saw the
[34:53] things that he did that just made them
[34:56] just see that this is the son of god
[34:58] this is the messiah who was promised
[35:01] so people say oh this is this is john
[35:03] martin oh man i he's i stepped on his
[35:05] toes i spit in his face and he's gonna
[35:07] rile back at me
[35:09] and they're gonna see christ in you like
[35:11] that
[35:12] because in order to see christ you have
[35:13] to be tested your long stuff your long
[35:16] suffering has to be put to test
[35:18] uh you know happiness you know your joy
[35:20] in situations you put the test all these
[35:21] things can be put to test to see if you
[35:23] got the goods
[35:25] and uh remember jesus he had a hungering
[35:27] to please the father
[35:30] and we should have a hungering to please
[35:31] him
[35:32] because he says in the scriptures he's
[35:33] our example
[35:35] we should follow after his footsteps
[35:37] he's paved the way all we have to do is
[35:39] just walk in those footsteps just walk
[35:41] in those footsteps
[35:42] and i'm not saying there's not you know
[35:44] he likes he likes it one step at a time
[35:46] one step at a time the thing is just
[35:48] trust him he knows what he's doing
[35:51] and it says if we have a hungering and
[35:52] thirsting just like david did in psalm
[35:54] 63 there is no reason or excuse for us
[35:57] to not be on fire for the lord there's
[35:59] no excuse
[36:01] we should be all the word all the word
[36:02] that's been preached here
[36:04] we should not have any excuse to be
[36:06] slaughterful or lazy
[36:10] if you want that hunger to stay you must
[36:11] be desperate desperation is so key with
[36:14] your walk with god
[36:15] if you're not desperate that's when the
[36:17] enemy creeps in and you become lukewarm
[36:20] you know david was a man of desperation
[36:23] pattern your life like david i'm not
[36:24] saying we're david but we can be like
[36:26] david because what he was he was like
[36:29] christ
[36:30] i mean he had that desperation to please
[36:31] god
[36:32] he says putting the lord first and
[36:34] everything you do will cause a great
[36:36] hunger daily because you put the things
[36:38] of god before you then you're constantly
[36:40] going to be hungry for him you're going
[36:42] to be his lord their souls i know you
[36:44] placed me in my job for a reason
[36:47] your word has to get across to these
[36:48] people they don't get to know you
[36:50] they're going to die
[36:52] if they don't accept you
[36:53] i rather
[36:55] i really somebody hate me for telling
[36:56] them the truth then for them hate me in
[36:58] the day of judgment for not telling them
[37:00] the truth
[37:00] because the thing is
[37:02] they're responsible if i give them the
[37:03] truth you know
[37:05] with the right motive the right heart
[37:06] and the love and they reject it that's
[37:09] on them
[37:10] i can't force anybody to be a christian
[37:11] i can't give anybody revelation that's
[37:13] not for me to do but it's for me to die
[37:15] trying the least
[37:17] the hunger we can get the more the lord
[37:19] can use us for his kingdom remember
[37:22] jesus always hungered to do the father's
[37:24] will and we are called to follow what
[37:26] that perfect example he left for us yes
[37:29] it's a quote from desperations right
[37:30] here our our dear lord jesus and himself
[37:33] in the world's greatest battleground
[37:34] gets timothy he cried out in despair
[37:37] should he take the sins of the world or
[37:39] should he remain on earth
[37:41] with his beloved disciples what he
[37:43] wanted to do
[37:44] but watch
[37:45] his humility as he humbled himself not
[37:48] my will but thine will be done
[37:51] humbled himself to the word the promised
[37:53] word of god of heaven
[37:55] notice then he went a little further and
[37:57] if he went a little further how much
[37:59] more we ought to go a little further
[38:01] amen
[38:02] see and notice the scripture says here
[38:03] in luke that he prayed what earnestly
[38:07] brother sister if jesus had to pray
[38:09] earnestly how much more have we got to
[38:12] pray earnestly if christ the god of
[38:14] heaven
[38:15] made flesh had to pray earnestly then
[38:17] how much more are we centered saved by
[38:19] grace
[38:20] prayed earnestly
[38:21] and if the decision throw the son of god
[38:23] in despair what will it do to you and i
[38:27] desperately we must cry
[38:30] i suggest we should we should listen to
[38:32] that message sometime desperations
[38:34] it'll really just show you what
[38:35] desperation really is be throwing
[38:37] desperation
[38:39] don't wait until hard times come into
[38:41] your life to be hungry don't wait
[38:44] thing is like i said before on the
[38:47] mountaintop we need to be hungry and
[38:48] desperate
[38:49] because we get to the valley we want to
[38:51] be thrown off surprise could god
[38:53] sometimes we get so comfortable with the
[38:55] blessing god's given us and we kind of
[38:57] look away from him a little bit he has
[38:59] to remind us where your blessings come
[39:00] from where your mercy comes and where
[39:02] your grace comes from amen
[39:04] the problem is we've gotten too lazy and
[39:07] lacks times and good times we get so
[39:08] lazy
[39:10] and there's missionaries out there just
[39:13] this struggling out there is to get the
[39:15] kingdom of god pre just get the kingdom
[39:17] just increase
[39:19] sometimes no shoes not enough food to
[39:21] eat
[39:22] walking uh you know
[39:25] it's just as many many variables they
[39:26] have and they don't use excuses
[39:28] but i think in america we just got so
[39:31] lazy
[39:33] we've got fast food we've got all these
[39:35] things at our fingertips that made us
[39:37] lazy
[39:38] and when you get away from those things
[39:39] that are making us lazy we need to we
[39:41] need to take inventory check inventory
[39:43] in your life
[39:46] pray when it's hardest to pray the enemy
[39:47] is trying to get you to be spiritually
[39:49] malnourished get more into hunger
[39:51] and
[39:52] malnourished means supply with less
[39:56] than minimum or imbalanced amount of the
[39:58] nutrients or food essentials for sound
[40:00] health and growth
[40:02] thing is i think sometimes we get
[40:03] spiritually amount of nervous because
[40:05] we're not feeding enough we're not
[40:06] reading we're just reading the reading
[40:08] the word just to check it off i read a i
[40:10] read a chapter today i read two chapters
[40:11] today uh i prayed you know for 30
[40:13] minutes today
[40:15] and the thing is i'd rather have you
[40:17] pray for just five minutes
[40:19] in the presence of god than you to pray
[40:21] for two hours in your flesh because
[40:23] that's not going to profit you anything
[40:25] the only thing it's going to do is it's
[40:26] going to boost your ego up that's all
[40:28] it's going to do it's going to give you
[40:28] more pride in your life
[40:30] and the thing is
[40:32] why are we satisfied with being
[40:33] spiritually malnourished it's not going
[40:35] to get the job done it's not he's coming
[40:37] for a bride without a spot or wrinkle
[40:39] he's gonna be just like him not not not
[40:41] spiritually malnourished it doesn't say
[40:44] nothing about that
[40:45] so think about this we're in a natural
[40:47] we have not eaten a long time we get
[40:49] weak right
[40:50] and so what makes us think if we're
[40:52] hungry in the spirit we don't need to
[40:53] feed
[40:55] the thing is we're not feeding
[40:56] spiritually we get weak that's when the
[40:58] bars come down i think uh when the bars
[41:01] that's when the goats come in let the
[41:02] bar is down
[41:03] and when you're and you're just if
[41:05] you're doing the bare minimum you're
[41:06] just making it oh man i just made the
[41:08] church who we
[41:09] that's not going to help
[41:11] i i understand you know we all have
[41:14] we're all busy we all have lives we
[41:16] you know we have some people have kids
[41:18] understand that 100 percent
[41:20] the thing is the more you can just make
[41:22] that sacrifice lord i know it's been a
[41:24] rough week but i'm here for you and you
[41:26] alone
[41:27] he's going to bless that
[41:30] if you're not feeding the spirit man
[41:32] then where you're feeding you're feeding
[41:33] your carnal flesh
[41:34] it's no it's no in the middle it can
[41:36] never be in the middle it's either
[41:37] you're serving god or he's hurting the
[41:38] devil it's one or the other either
[41:40] you're hot or cold don't try to be
[41:41] lukewarm
[41:43] um so the key is we need to create a
[41:45] habit thing is we created so many bad
[41:47] habits in our lives
[41:49] let's create good habits let's kick
[41:50] those bad habits out
[41:52] let's create a habit of lord i'm not
[41:53] leaving
[41:54] my prayer closet until i meet with you
[41:56] lord i'm not reading i'm not leaving
[41:58] reading this word until i see you in
[41:59] every line every phrase till you make
[42:01] this word just come to life for me
[42:04] let's go to matthew 10 38.
[42:07] so let's make that habit let's make a
[42:08] decoration tonight i'm feeding my spirit
[42:11] man daily i don't care well how my day
[42:12] has been i don't care what the enemy's
[42:14] throwing at me i'm feeding the spirit
[42:16] man
[42:21] matthew 10 uh 38
[42:23] i'm going the wrong way
[42:26] so it says and matt this is probably
[42:28] very familiar as well
[42:31] if i can find it
[42:35] and he that taketh not his cross and
[42:37] fall after me is not worthy of me
[42:39] so if you're not denying yourself daily
[42:41] if you're not denying yourself of your
[42:43] will daily you're not even worthy to
[42:45] follow him
[42:46] you're not you're not even worthy to
[42:48] bear his name
[42:49] because you're trying to you're trying
[42:50] to serve god
[42:52] while doing your will it doesn't work
[42:54] that way
[42:54] it can't work that way it's impossible
[42:56] god doesn't operate like that way it's
[42:57] not his in that economy it's impossible
[43:00] so the thing is
[43:02] in order for in order to take your cross
[43:03] up you gotta deny yourself that's that's
[43:05] what jesus said
[43:06] you have to do it it's not of i can do
[43:08] it sometimes it's a must
[43:10] if you want to truly serve god and the
[43:12] magnitude he wants you to serve him in
[43:13] you have to die daily
[43:15] you have to you have to kill that old
[43:17] man because old man wants to rile up he
[43:19] wants to
[43:20] show out
[43:22] so matthew 26 41
[43:26] and prayer is that's the key right there
[43:27] prayer is so important
[43:29] it's your lifeline between you and god
[43:32] it's think about it it's a direct
[43:34] connection to the throne room
[43:37] your prayer is greater than any atomic
[43:38] bomb that you can think of any any
[43:41] sniper rifle any machine gun any grenade
[43:43] that's greater than any of that prayer
[43:44] changes things
[43:46] makes situations get light on what you
[43:48] get confusion turns to peace
[43:50] that's when god speaks to you
[43:54] 20
[43:56] sorry 26 41 right
[43:59] so 20 says watch and pray
[44:01] they enter not into temptation the
[44:03] spirit indeed is willing but the flesh
[44:06] is weak
[44:07] so you gotta realize your flesh is weak
[44:11] is you gotta realize that nature you're
[44:12] born was a fallen nature
[44:14] so it's gonna always gravitate towards
[44:16] the things of satan
[44:18] and your your biggest enemy it isn't
[44:21] communism
[44:22] it isn't politics
[44:24] it isn't your brother sitting next to
[44:26] you it's yourself
[44:28] you get in the way of god moving your
[44:30] life yourself you do you're your biggest
[44:32] enemy
[44:34] think about it it's not your brother
[44:35] who's stopping you for praying on your
[44:36] knees it's yourself
[44:38] because you don't want to crucify your
[44:39] flesh you're going to take the easy way
[44:41] out
[44:42] don't make excuses
[44:43] just say
[44:45] i'm done i'm done making excuses
[44:47] take responsibility for things a lot of
[44:49] times we want to
[44:50] just not take responsibility or point
[44:52] fingers when we make a mistake be
[44:54] responsible for it
[44:55] and don't just be satisfied oh i made a
[44:57] mistake but learn from that mistake grow
[44:59] from that mistake god is trying to teach
[45:01] us and
[45:02] god's trying to teach you every day
[45:04] you have to be be more aware in your
[45:06] life be aware of what you're doing
[45:08] uh whatever whatever job you're doing be
[45:09] aware pay attention to detail
[45:11] it's gonna help you be more sharper pray
[45:13] for spiritual awareness lord help me to
[45:15] be more spiritually aware help me to
[45:17] recognize you on a daily basis
[45:21] uh this is uh this is right here from
[45:23] take the rod and gather the people says
[45:25] can we bow our heads heavenly father

[45:28] to this lovely audience of people

[45:32] constantly blessing me and giving me
[45:34] this portion of the gospel standing by
[45:36] me in the hours when we needed and

[48:36] that's from making a valley full of
[48:38] ditches and looky here i've seen a piece
[48:40] in the paper some year ago two years ago
[48:42] where a little baby had eaten erasers
[48:44] off of pencils he pedals off a bicycle
[48:46] they said what's the matter with that
[48:48] child the doctor examined and taken
[48:50] analysis of his blood and come to find

[49:16] formal the great westlake revival the
[49:18] people began to hunger for more god if
[49:20] you hunger for more of god what there's
[49:22] bound to be more of god to respond to
[49:24] somewhere
[49:25] if you only been justified by faith and
[49:27] know nothing but about the baptism the
[49:29] holy ghost
[49:31] and you hunger for it there's got to be
[49:32] a holy ghost somewhere to feel that
[49:33] hunger
[49:34] so if if anybody wants one of the holy
[49:37] ghost there's plenty
[49:39] there's plenty he's like a fish in the
[49:40] ocean he doesn't you know say oh i gotta
[49:42] drink sparingly he keeps drinking it god
[49:45] you can't exhaust god
[49:47] he even disciples got refilled
[49:49] and he gave him boldness even more
[49:51] boldness to speak the word
[49:53] uh that's right and if you believe today
[49:55] there's a god who heals there's got to
[49:57] be a fountain open somewhere for healing
[49:59] or that desire wouldn't be there
[50:01] let's go to proverbs 19.
[50:08] how i'm on time
[50:12] so proverbs 19 15 says
[50:17] slothfulness
[50:18] cast it into a deep sleep
[50:20] so think about we get lazy and slothful
[50:22] that's when your guard gets down
[50:24] that's when the devil enters in
[50:26] it's when the enemy pillages takes your
[50:28] joy your salvation away doesn't take
[50:30] your salvation away but david said
[50:32] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[50:35] and take not that holy spirit from me
[50:38] so thoughtfulness casts into a deep
[50:40] sleep and an idol soul shall suffer
[50:42] hunger
[50:43] he that keepeth the commandment keepeth
[50:45] his own soul but he that despised his
[50:47] way shall die
[50:49] jesus gave us many commandments
[50:51] are you following them
[50:53] are you following him today i'm not
[50:54] saying in the past are you following his
[50:56] commandments today
[50:57] because he's telling me right here he
[50:59] that keeps his commandment keeps his own
[51:00] soul
[51:01] if you choose not to keep his
[51:02] commandment you're disobeying them
[51:04] it's like a slap in the face almost
[51:08] so now to keep hungry and thirsting for
[51:10] god you must feed your spirit man with
[51:12] the things of god you need to be seeking
[51:14] him in the spirit
[51:15] and reading his word
[51:17] and turn the second corinthians with me
[51:19] verse three
[51:26] i'll try to hurry
[51:30] second corinthians three
[51:32] verse six
[51:36] who has made us able ministers the new
[51:38] testament
[51:40] not of the letter but the spirit for the
[51:42] letter kilth but the spirit giveth life
[51:45] that's what's going to make a change in
[51:46] your life
[51:47] the way you read this word is going to
[51:48] change if you're saying lord
[51:51] i need you i need your spirit to bring
[51:52] this word to life lord i need this this
[51:54] word this to be so real to me
[51:56] i don't want to read it like it's some
[51:58] history book i don't want to just read
[51:59] it just to read it like it's a good book
[52:02] this is the blueprint of my life this is
[52:04] the way i need to live my life
[52:06] this this is i want to set a standard in
[52:07] my home my work i don't care what the
[52:10] majority says i don't care the majority
[52:11] leaves leave stop serving god i'm
[52:13] serving god no matter what
[52:15] so this is a spiritual walk with christ
[52:17] how are we going to grow if you don't
[52:18] eat the proper spiritual diet
[52:21] the natural types of the natural types
[52:23] of spiritual for example
[52:25] if you don't eat the right things your
[52:26] body needs eventually going to get
[52:27] malnourished yes
[52:29] so if your spiritual diet is poor then
[52:32] you're eventually going to be become
[52:33] spiritually malnourished
[52:35] and how can god use for his kingdom if
[52:36] you're not properly nourished with the
[52:38] right essential with the word
[52:41] you have a proper balance
[52:43] you gotta have a balance and the balance
[52:45] lies in god they'll be busy balanced and
[52:47] focused that's the key right there my
[52:50] time would be just be busy you know in
[52:51] your daily life working be busy with the
[52:53] things of god
[52:56] uh
[52:56] god is looking for believers who are
[52:58] hungry
[52:59] for more of him
[53:01] and the way you live your life on a
[53:02] daily basis will prove if you're hungry
[53:04] for god
[53:05] the things you're saying on a daily
[53:06] basis
[53:08] the people you're hanging on a daily
[53:09] basis
[53:10] the conversations you're having on a
[53:11] daily basis is going to really prove how
[53:13] hungry you are for god
[53:15] it's really gonna prove it
[53:17] now to keep hungry you must be desperate
[53:19] let's go to samuel uh first samuel
[53:21] chapter one
[53:23] probably very familiar
[53:33] amen
[53:35] yeah
[53:37] let me know you guys are there i think
[53:39] i'm there
[53:42] say amen we're there please
[53:45] so verse 10 says and she was in
[53:47] bitterness of soul and prayed unto the
[53:49] lord and wept sore
[53:50] and she vowed to vow and said o lord of
[53:52] hosts if thou indeed look on the
[53:54] affliction of thy handmaid and remember
[53:56] me
[53:57] and not forget thy handmaid but will
[53:59] give unto thy hand made a man child
[54:01] then i will give him unto you unto the
[54:03] lord all the days of his life see the
[54:05] lord is looking for the motive of why
[54:07] you're desperate for what you need and
[54:10] hannah she got serious
[54:12] she said i'm giving this child back to
[54:14] you
[54:15] the thing is
[54:17] when you get extra time in your life say
[54:18] lord i'm getting this time back to you
[54:20] i'm giving everything you're giving i'm
[54:21] giving it back to you
[54:23] dedicate your car to him your house to
[54:25] him your vessel to him rededicate
[54:27] yourself to him amen
[54:29] it says uh
[54:30] all the days of his life and there shall
[54:32] no razor come upon his head and it came
[54:34] to pass and she continued praying before
[54:35] the lord
[54:37] that eli marked her mouth now hannah she
[54:39] spake in her heart only her lips moved
[54:40] but her voice was not heard therefore
[54:42] eli thought she had been drunken
[54:45] and eli said unto her how long without
[54:47] be drunken put away thy whine from me
[54:50] and hannah answered and said no my lord
[54:52] i am a woman of a sorrowful spirit i
[54:54] have drinking neither wine nor strong
[54:55] drink but have poured out my soul before
[54:57] the lord
[54:58] are you pouring your soul before the
[54:59] lord it's my question to you
[55:02] when's the last time you've done it it's
[55:03] my other question to you
[55:05] count not thy hand made for a daughter
[55:06] of belial for out of the abundance of my
[55:09] complaint and grief if i spoken hitherto
[55:12] then eli answered and said go in peace
[55:14] and the god of israel grant thee that
[55:15] petition that was asked
[55:17] and she said let thy hand find grace in
[55:19] thy sight
[55:21] so the woman went her way and did eat
[55:22] and her countenance was no more sad
[55:25] so look hannah was desperate she was
[55:27] desperate for a son
[55:29] she wanted a son really bad
[55:31] and when she got serious
[55:34] she was willing to dedicate him to the
[55:35] lord
[55:36] so where do you want to dedicate to the
[55:38] lord
[55:39] how many things in your life have you
[55:40] not been dedicated to the lord there's a
[55:41] question
[55:43] the lord is looking for a believer who's
[55:44] willing to sell out lock stock and
[55:46] barrel
[55:48] and remember desperation is a state of
[55:50] despair typically one which results in
[55:52] rash or extreme behavior remember god's
[55:55] looking at your motive while you're
[55:56] desperate
[55:57] we can be desperate for the wrong things
[55:59] remember that we can be desperate for
[56:00] many wrong things in our lives check the
[56:02] inventory and say lord are these things
[56:04] pleasing to the things that i'm desiring
[56:07] because he can give you something that
[56:08] he can give you something
[56:10] that's out of his out of his will but i
[56:12] don't want anything out of his his will
[56:14] i want his perfect his perfect will
[56:17] now if you notice uh it does not say
[56:20] in john 16 13 don't have the title turn
[56:22] there okay
[56:23] actually put in the please put it i'll
[56:25] read off the board if you're online john
[56:26] 16 13. how be it when he the spirit of
[56:29] truth has come he will guide you into
[56:31] all truth for he should not speak of
[56:33] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[56:35] that shall he speak and he will show you
[56:37] things to come now notice it does not
[56:39] say he will force you in all truth says
[56:40] he will guide you so that that meaning
[56:42] you have to choose to follow his
[56:44] leadership when the lord's speaking to
[56:46] you
[56:46] you have a choice to follow it or reject
[56:48] it
[56:49] you can't be in between amen because
[56:52] that's iniquity if you try to go in
[56:53] between amen if you choose not to follow
[56:56] god
[56:57] god does not have halfway believers
[56:59] he doesn't and another another thing too
[57:01] when you're hungry and your mind is such
[57:03] an important thing
[57:04] because you remember the word goes in
[57:06] your mind first and then either take it
[57:08] by faith or you reject it by unbelief
[57:11] so the thing is when you're hungry for
[57:12] the things of god your mind such it's a
[57:14] battle up there daily satan's trying to
[57:16] speak to him god's trying to speak to
[57:17] you
[57:18] you got to get still and try that spirit
[57:20] says in john 4 uh first john 4 1 try the
[57:23] spirit and see to be of
[57:24] me so thing is don't dislike any kind of
[57:27] thought going to your mind
[57:29] when you just do that become lazy
[57:31] take the time don't let your mind be the
[57:33] devil's playground that's right
[57:35] it's so easy just to let thoughts just
[57:36] go willy-nilly but that's when you get
[57:38] off track
[57:40] see the more we renew our mind the more
[57:42] we can stay focused on god
[57:44] that the mind of christ is promised to
[57:46] you but you have to seek after it you
[57:48] gotta desire it
[57:52] you have to get hungry and thirsty after
[57:53] that mind of god don't just expect to
[57:55] magically obtain it
[57:57] it takes a lot of dying out to get that
[57:58] if you want the mind of god it takes a
[58:00] lot of sacrifice a lot of
[58:02] blood sweat tears takes all those things
[58:04] it takes for you to willing to say lord
[58:07] i need this mind
[58:08] i can't function without the mind of
[58:10] christ
[58:12] if we go to revelations 3
[58:15] almost we're going to close in
[58:18] next five 10 minutes
[58:20] might have five or ten more minutes
[58:23] all right
[58:25] let's be preaching a three hour sermon
[58:27] then i'm just kidding
[58:30] all right so uh it's probably very
[58:31] familiar versus uh verse 20 in chapter
[58:33] three it says behold i stand and knock
[58:37] if any man will hear my voice open the
[58:39] door and i will come to him and what's
[58:40] up with him and he with me
[58:43] to him that overcometh while i grant to
[58:44] sit with me in my throne
[58:46] i want to ask you a question
[58:48] how many giants are in your land that
[58:50] you're letting roman
[58:52] whatever they are addiction unbelief you
[58:54] name it fear
[58:55] there's so many giants in our land that
[58:57] we just let this roam around
[58:59] god's god's you're overcomer in this age
[59:02] you can overcome any giant that's in
[59:04] your land
[59:05] thing is you have to want to do it
[59:06] though god isn't going to force it
[59:09] he wants you to
[59:10] you gotta make that first step first to
[59:12] show them what if you're addicted with
[59:13] something the same thing i know when i
[59:14] had addiction in my life
[59:16] i i said god i can't do this anymore i
[59:18] cannot do this anymore i need this out
[59:20] of my life and i got serious with god
[59:22] no it didn't happen this very second i
[59:24] got delivered remember one day
[59:26] it was like maybe like six months seven
[59:28] months later i just felt free
[59:30] that desire was gone
[59:32] i was like well i just felt free that
[59:34] the chains of bondage were just gone
[59:36] so god honors when you're serious
[59:39] the thing is you gotta get serious
[59:41] don't don't just expect god to say hocus
[59:43] pocus and it's gone it doesn't work that
[59:45] way
[59:46] i'm not saying he can't deliver you
[59:47] instantly at times he can i believe he
[59:49] can but it's we we expect god just to
[59:51] move in our in our timing and our timing
[59:54] isn't
[59:55] always god's time remember that
[59:58] so another thing we must be hungry for
[1:00:00] is to conquer those giants in our land
[1:00:03] be hungry to conquer those giants don't
[1:00:05] let the don't let the giants of
[1:00:06] addiction of fear of manipulation
[1:00:08] unbelief roaming your life
[1:00:10] how do you expect to have the mind of
[1:00:11] christ if your mind is the devil's
[1:00:13] playground take back control of your
[1:00:14] mind just because it's the greatest bad
[1:00:16] ever fought
[1:00:17] doesn't mean you have to lose with every
[1:00:18] battle
[1:00:19] you know
[1:00:20] god has called you to be a victor
[1:00:22] overcomer it's like brother aaron preach
[1:00:25] invert
[1:00:26] don't just look at the you know these
[1:00:28] things that devil's tempting with is
[1:00:30] just oh wow what was me look at the
[1:00:32] chance that you can kick that devil out
[1:00:34] you can kick that devil out your life
[1:00:37] get get so on fire with god the devil
[1:00:39] doesn't know what to do with you
[1:00:44] so in john 10 10
[1:00:46] we'll go there
[1:00:52] john 10
[1:00:54] 10. and then after that we'll go to uh
[1:00:58] first samuel
[1:00:59] and we'll try to close
[1:01:02] and time just flies doesn't it
[1:01:07] it says
[1:01:08] the thief cometh not but for distill and
[1:01:10] to kill and to destroy
[1:01:12] i came that they might have life and
[1:01:14] then that might have it more abundantly
[1:01:17] so the thing is
[1:01:19] he's come they have more life more
[1:01:20] abundantly don't live below what god's
[1:01:23] calling you to do brother branham said
[1:01:25] we live so below our privilege is what
[1:01:27] god is calling us to be don't just be
[1:01:29] satisfied with just
[1:01:31] just serving god to bare minimum
[1:01:33] don't just be satisfied once again those
[1:01:34] giants taking control of you don't say
[1:01:37] i'm a grasshopper in their sight no
[1:01:39] you gotta you gotta take control you
[1:01:41] gotta stand up stand up to those giants
[1:01:43] what david did we're gonna we're gonna
[1:01:44] read actually and reading samuel right
[1:01:46] now
[1:01:47] i i love
[1:01:48] i love right here with this uh encounter
[1:01:50] with him and goliath i really love it
[1:01:53] because you look at the enemy
[1:01:55] the enemy when he gets upper hand or
[1:01:56] gets cocky he likes to
[1:01:59] like he proposed he said uh
[1:02:01] if we you know if you defeat us we'll
[1:02:03] serve you you know or vice versa you
[1:02:05] know
[1:02:06] he can see all these things and bluff he
[1:02:08] gets a bluff a lot
[1:02:10] so let's let's read that in the first
[1:02:11] time let me get there myself first
[1:02:12] samuel 17
[1:02:15] and it says
[1:02:17] in verse 26
[1:02:20] and david spake to the men
[1:02:22] that stood by him saying what shall be
[1:02:24] done to that that
[1:02:26] to the man that kills this philistine
[1:02:27] and take away the approach of israel
[1:02:29] for who is this uncircumcised philistine
[1:02:32] that should defy the armies of the
[1:02:33] living god
[1:02:34] verse 31
[1:02:36] and when the words were heard which
[1:02:38] david spake they rehearsed them before
[1:02:40] saul and he sent for him and david said
[1:02:42] to saul
[1:02:44] let no man's heart fail because of him
[1:02:46] that servant will go and fight with the
[1:02:48] philistine and saul said to david thou
[1:02:50] are not able to go against his
[1:02:51] philistine to fight with him father but
[1:02:53] a youth and he a man wore from his youth
[1:02:57] and david said unto saul
[1:02:58] that servant kept his father's sheep and
[1:03:00] there came a lion and a bear and took a
[1:03:02] lamb out of the flock and went after him
[1:03:04] and smote him and delivered it out of
[1:03:06] his mouth and when he arose against me i
[1:03:08] caught him by his beard and smote him
[1:03:10] and slew him
[1:03:12] thy servant slew both the lion and the
[1:03:14] bear and this uncircumcised philistine
[1:03:17] seeing he had to follow the army's
[1:03:19] living god don't let any uncircumcised
[1:03:21] philistine defile your land
[1:03:24] god didn't create you for that he
[1:03:26] created you to kill the enemy
[1:03:31] verse 37 david said moreover the lord
[1:03:33] had delivered me out of the paul the
[1:03:35] lion and out of the paul of the bear and
[1:03:37] he would deliver me out of the hand of
[1:03:39] the philistine and saul said unto david
[1:03:41] go and the lord be with thee and saw
[1:03:44] armed david with his armor and he put
[1:03:46] his helmet on all the stuff he put on of
[1:03:48] the brass upon his head and he got armed
[1:03:50] with his coat of the mail
[1:03:51] and david gerd is so and
[1:03:53] david gird his sword upon his armor and
[1:03:55] say to go for he hath not proved it and
[1:03:57] david said in the saw i cannot go with
[1:03:59] these for i have not proved them and
[1:04:00] david put them off of him and he took
[1:04:03] his staff in his hand and chose him five
[1:04:05] smooth stones of the brook and put them
[1:04:08] in a shepherd's bag which he had even a
[1:04:09] script and his sling was in his hand
[1:04:12] engineered to the philistine
[1:04:14] the philistine came out and drew near to
[1:04:15] david and the man that bear hit the
[1:04:17] shield went before him
[1:04:20] and when the philistine looked about and
[1:04:22] saw david he disdained him for he was
[1:04:24] but a youth and ruddy of fair
[1:04:26] countenance and the philistine said unto
[1:04:28] david am i a dog that thou comest to me
[1:04:31] with staves
[1:04:32] and the philistine cursed him by his
[1:04:33] gods
[1:04:34] philistine said to david come to me and
[1:04:36] i will give you that flesh upon the
[1:04:38] files of the air
[1:04:39] and the beast of the field
[1:04:41] then david said to the philistine thou
[1:04:43] comes to me with a sword and with a
[1:04:45] spear and a shield
[1:04:47] i come to thee in the name of the lord
[1:04:50] of hosts
[1:04:51] the god of the armies of israel whom
[1:04:53] thou hast defile
[1:04:54] this day will the lord deliver thee into
[1:04:57] my hand and i will smite thee and take
[1:05:00] thy head from me and i will give the
[1:05:01] carcass to the host so when there's
[1:05:03] giants in your land you take that sword
[1:05:05] you just cut away that enemy just cut
[1:05:07] him away
[1:05:08] he has no business being in your life
[1:05:10] he is no busy you shouldn't be
[1:05:13] don't don't don't try to coexist with
[1:05:14] satan
[1:05:15] don't try to do that if you try to do
[1:05:17] that you're never ever going to be where
[1:05:18] god wants you to be he wants to be so
[1:05:20] much higher than what you can imagine
[1:05:22] once you read new heights you've never
[1:05:23] seen in your life
[1:05:25] the thing is you have to like you have
[1:05:26] to show god that you mean business thing
[1:05:29] is it's not you doing overcoming it's
[1:05:30] him and you're doing overcoming he's
[1:05:32] giving me that sword to chop away that
[1:05:34] enemy he's giving me that sword to kick
[1:05:35] the enemy out jesus never reasoned with
[1:05:37] the devil when he met him three times he
[1:05:39] never one time he said it is written
[1:05:41] that order if they get behind me he
[1:05:43] never had to reason on the devil when
[1:05:44] you reason the devil he has you right
[1:05:45] there that's what eve did
[1:05:47] she lusted after knowledge he started to
[1:05:48] think about it and right there he had
[1:05:50] her
[1:05:51] so don't when the devil comes you with
[1:05:53] something don't even give him the time
[1:05:55] of day you kick him out right then and
[1:05:57] there
[1:05:58] all he is uncircumcised philistine and
[1:06:00] you know we're gonna finish the story
[1:06:02] in all assembly uh shall i know the lord
[1:06:05] save not with sword and spear for the
[1:06:07] bow is the lord's and he will give he
[1:06:09] will give you into our hands it came to
[1:06:11] pass when the philistine arose and came
[1:06:13] and drew now to meet david that david
[1:06:15] hastened and ran toward the army to meet
[1:06:17] the philistines and david put his hand
[1:06:19] in his bag took us took against the
[1:06:20] stone
[1:06:22] and slang it and smote the philistine
[1:06:23] his forehead then the stone sunk into
[1:06:26] his forehead and he fell on his face in
[1:06:27] the earth so then david prevailed over
[1:06:29] the philistine so i want you to put
[1:06:30] yourself in that scripture
[1:06:32] so
[1:06:33] brother ron prevailed over the
[1:06:34] philistine for the john prevailer
[1:06:36] philistine brother jonathan all you guys
[1:06:38] sister ann sister trisha brother roger
[1:06:41] you can prevail over that philistine in
[1:06:42] your life with a sling with a stone and
[1:06:44] smoth the philistine slew him but there
[1:06:47] was no sword in his hand therefore they
[1:06:49] ran and stood
[1:06:51] upon the philistine and took his sword
[1:06:53] and drew it out of the sheath therefore
[1:06:54] and slew him and cut off his head
[1:06:56] therewith and with the in when the
[1:06:58] philistines saw their champion was dead
[1:07:00] they fled
[1:07:01] so when the devil knows you have the
[1:07:03] real stuff he's going to flee
[1:07:05] because he knows when god is in the
[1:07:06] picture he's weak he can do nothing
[1:07:09] just like when uh jesus was then put
[1:07:11] when jesus was in the presence of the
[1:07:13] legion
[1:07:15] he said you come to torment me this
[1:07:16] early
[1:07:18] so the thing is if god is moving your
[1:07:19] life like that they're going to be the
[1:07:20] same thing
[1:07:22] let's get so on fire for god that when
[1:07:24] when satan comes yeah you come to
[1:07:25] torment me this early let's get like
[1:07:27] that because we can get like that it's
[1:07:29] possible i believe we can reach heights
[1:07:31] there's things that
[1:07:33] we don't think we can get to high school
[1:07:34] we can
[1:07:36] so be like joshua and caleb
[1:07:38] when they went to the we went to to
[1:07:40] despite the land out
[1:07:42] they saw that god had promised they even
[1:07:44] brought back grapes
[1:07:45] but 10 out of the 12 said we're
[1:07:47] grasshoppers we can't do this we're
[1:07:49] better in egypt but joshua kisses a
[1:07:51] different spirit
[1:07:53] if god can be forced who can be against
[1:07:54] us
[1:07:55] if god's promised that land for you take
[1:07:57] it
[1:07:58] i don't care what's in there i don't
[1:08:00] care what giants are in there i don't
[1:08:01] care don't give me excuses just take
[1:08:02] that land he promised me with you and in
[1:08:04] you the god inside you can handle any
[1:08:07] problem any solution that's in your life
[1:08:08] that's right
[1:08:09] you don't have to wait for the pastor to
[1:08:10] help him you have to wait for
[1:08:12] your favorite preacher to come help you
[1:08:14] you want to wait for your favorite
[1:08:15] brother to come help you
[1:08:16] your personal walk can help you this is
[1:08:19] all you need is a personal walk of
[1:08:20] christ that's all you need
[1:08:22] so i guess the
[1:08:25] last thing i'll be we'll close
[1:08:27] dedicate your mind
[1:08:28] dedicate your heart dedicate your
[1:08:30] worship dedicate your whole being to god
[1:08:33] and i'll read this quote brother paul uh
[1:08:36] said this
[1:08:38] worship is more than just singing more
[1:08:40] than just music worship is a life that
[1:08:42] has a revelation the redemptive
[1:08:44] blessings of god and the atonement of
[1:08:46] god
[1:08:47] it shouldn't have to take music for you
[1:08:49] to worship
[1:08:50] i think a lot of times we just worship
[1:08:51] here we try we always worship here at
[1:08:53] church that's enough the thing is if we
[1:08:55] worship at home
[1:08:57] then that our worship in church would be
[1:08:58] so much more fruitful
[1:09:00] we need to worship it at home god
[1:09:03] that is a revelation of the redempted
[1:09:05] blessings of god in the atonement of god
[1:09:08] so the thing is
[1:09:10] i believe it comes from a life that's
[1:09:11] what dedicated close relationship it's a
[1:09:14] sanctified life
[1:09:15] that's what worship is
[1:09:18] and we can get in that state of worship
[1:09:19] when we come in
[1:09:21] we won't just be following the motions
[1:09:22] but really just when you're reading
[1:09:24] those words when we're singing get into
[1:09:25] the words
[1:09:26] don't just sing it because you sung it
[1:09:28] thousands of times get into the worship
[1:09:30] when it says i'm so needy say lord i'm
[1:09:32] needy of you i need you to come here
[1:09:34] tonight i need you to speak to brother
[1:09:35] stones i need you to speak to me most of
[1:09:37] all so i can help somebody
[1:09:39] that's what worship really is and we
[1:09:41] need as a church need to get more into
[1:09:42] worship let's not depend on the song
[1:09:44] leaders and not not depend on uh
[1:09:46] somebody else trying to create
[1:09:47] atmosphere but you be that creator of
[1:09:49] your atmosphere you create that
[1:09:50] atmosphere that's gonna bring god that's
[1:09:52] gonna welcome god because god wants to
[1:09:54] feel welcomed
[1:09:55] you gotta create the atmosphere of faith
[1:09:58] that's gonna welcome every single time
[1:10:00] we could rise uh maybe stand and
[1:10:03] we'll sing
[1:10:04] i am so needy
[1:10:11] i hope you guys uh definitely got
[1:10:13] something off that message
[1:10:16] let's not forget what we heard from the
[1:10:18] lord
[1:10:22] [Music]
[1:10:29] of tonight
[1:10:32] i
[1:10:33] am so

[1:11:08] hearts
[1:11:10] things tonight have just felt they've
[1:11:12] been challenged
[1:11:13] is to have a greater hungering in god
[1:11:15] raise your hand to the lord
[1:11:17] if you feel as
[1:11:18] you haven't been hungering like you need
[1:11:20] to be on a daily basis
[1:11:22] just let that not be known to god
[1:11:24] if you know there could be more done in
[1:11:26] your life to serve god to help his
[1:11:28] kingdom increase
