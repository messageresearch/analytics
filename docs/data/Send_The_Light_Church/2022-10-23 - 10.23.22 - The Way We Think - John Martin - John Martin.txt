the Lord what a beautiful course to be like Jesus that's all I ask that's all that that God asks of us is to be like him and uh if that's all we're asking that's all he's asking why is it so hard and we have something that's in the way between our desire and God's desire and that's this flesh it stands in the way and we have to overcome all things in order you even have to hate our own lives and to death and I believe that's how we'll become more like Jesus well God bless you today it's good for each of us that have gathered to be in God's house we're fortunate others are sick and some uh our our vacation our brother Roger sister Trisha but let's pray for the many that are needing our prayers I'm sure they would much rather feel healthy be in the house of the Lord and enjoy the presence of the Lord amen amen let's turn in our Bibles to Joshua chapter 24. all right very very familiar scripture of course we use that terminology a lot about the whole Bible becomes familiar to us but this scripture about choosing to to serve uh uh the lord it's just a very popular scripture amen before we begin reading in verse 14 of Joshua chapter 24 let's look to the author and just ask His blessings upon our our eyes and our hearts here Heavenly Father we come to you Lord as humbly as we know how we're we're very needy people without you we can do nothing we cannot go anywhere we can't overcome anything we need you for everything and Lord replace ourselves at your feet today and just ask you to take our our minds and our hearts now and Lord may they just be subject to your Holy Spirit as you speak to us through your word may you help each of us in our journey to to to to be prepared for that Rapture Lord and between now and then we we just need your help and we pray that you'd bless the service today you take these these were words Lord this short time of the week that we're spending here together subjecting ourselves to the word we just pray that you'd bless this word to our hearts and help us to be more like you we pray that you'd be with those that are sick and Afflicted and God we just ask that you'd raise every one of them up for your glory and for your honor Lord we love you we thank you for this now we pray that you bless your word to our hearts by the power of Revelation and we'll give you the praise in Jesus name for it amen amen God bless you it's read God's word now in Joshua chapter 24 starting with verse number 14. now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and it if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your fathers serve that were on the other side of the flood of the Gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord so when I think of my father's my father my mother my parents my relatives who they serve they basically serve their flesh right amen and um so the god that you put for your flesh is the god you're serving so even though we're not looking at amorites and things we still need to put away the things that are natural Mom and Dad's had served that wasn't of God Amen and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods for the Lord Our God he is uh he it is that brought us up in our fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight and preserved us all in the way wherein he went we went and among all the people through whom we passed and the Lord drove out uh from before us all the people even the amorites which go out in the land therefore we will also serve the Lord for he is our God and Joshua is unto the people you cannot serve the Lord he's first telling them to choose and and to and to choose to serve the Lord and imagine to choose a certainly made it made the Declaration that he was going to serve the Lord now he's making this statement here you cannot serve the Lord for he is a holy God he is a jealous God he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if you forsake the Lord and serve strange Gods then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that you have done you good our brothers has been talking about jealousy in our men's meetings and here we see a great sign of God's jealousy and the people said unto Joshua nay but we will serve the Lord and Joshua said unto the people your witness is against yourselves that you have chosen that ye have chosen you the Lord to serve him and they said we Are Witnesses now therefore put away said he the strange gods that are among you and inclined your heart unto the Lord of his Lord God of Israel and the people said unto Joshua the Lord Our God will we serve in his voice will we obey amen God bless you may be seated well brother Tim Sean was here we had some some wonderful messages here of late and brother Tim had spoke on speak and go forward in faith just a word of encouragement for us after that we had a a little message on fighting for Faith the Lord had been dealing with us prior to that service and so we felt it fit in and then brother Daryl ministered on hold on so we got going forward and holding on those were encouraging messages for our church Amen brother Mark preached on the the power of decision last Wednesday and uh he talked about maybe doing a little series on that and digging deeper into that and how important it is and so before uh before he was speaking on that uh Monday and Tuesday we were studying the word while we were on our little anniversary and we of course we didn't interfere with Cheryl we did it when she was sleeping and uh but we were studying on this message today and um we want to entitle this message the way we think the way we think we don't put a lot of stock in the way that we think but for a subject we want to talk about serving the lord with our thoughts we're choosing to to serve the Lord uh we we view it one way but we just kind of want to do a little Bible study we're going to be going through a lot but the main thing is for us to see that we just don't serve God outwardly out here but it's constantly in our mind and in our thoughts and we're in the greatest battle ever fought brother Bynum said is so it's difficult to serve the Lord with our thoughts brother Brian set our mind is the womb to our soul it's the place that the devil operates from because he wants to control our nature so if he can control our thoughts he can control our nature and oftentimes we allow the devil if I could say too much Liberty in our mind not that he should ever be there but it's like a child on a playground or a teenager at a concert or a fan at a football game and they they just kind of go crazy and wild and anything goes it's like having a party there's hardly any limitations but if we were in a library or a museum or a church there would be limitations right well our minds need to have limitations as well uh like the love of God it thinketh no evil so it has boundaries it has limitations it's limited to the things that are pure lovely true honest of a good report that brings virtue to us that brings praise to God and so we need to stay in those boundaries and we we notice that if we get out of those boundaries then all sudden we lose our peace true amen that's right and it's all happens in our minds we allow the devil too much space in our minds and when we do he has a way of tricking us we should be practicing more how to resist the devil here instead of fighting out here with people that disagree with us we need to fight the enemy right here because when we fight him here God can show us how to help somebody out here right now just to be honest with you Satan comes and speaks to us he doesn't have any valuable information for us he's trying to trick us now because our thoughts are private we sometimes have this uh this thinking that we can pretty much think whatever we want because nobody knows about it we're safe as long as we don't speak the words out loud to somebody and and and like a uh we can do two things at one time we can think one thoughts here and speak other words here that's true and um our thoughts may be private to one another but they're not private to God in fact they speak louder in heaven than our words do down here Hebrews 4 12 says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword it's piercing even to the dividing asunder the soul in the spirit and the joints tomorrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart if you really want to help your spiritual walk you have to subject yourself to the word now that word is not just when we're here hearing the word being preached yes the word is here but the word is with you amen amen when you're not in church and that word is still a discerner and how many times have you thought something did something wrong and all of a sudden you felt a conviction well that's that's the Lord there letting you know what just transpired wasn't appropriate was it right yeah and and so the more that we can yield to that in our thought pattern the more we'll catch it ahead of time right neither verse 13 neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight for all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do amen I don't I don't want to be carnal but just imagine uh God just looking at all of our thoughts and all the time we can't hide anything we can hide them from one another but we can't hide them from God and what good is it to hide it from one another because it's not going to help us it's not going to help us see the devil is always trying to hide and it's only when he's uncovered does he leave and you've got to call it out call him out and tell him to get out of here but if you don't recognize it's the devil you think it's your brother you think it's your sister you think it's your neighbor think it's so the guy at work or whatever then then you don't really call him out I believe we if we watched our thoughts more with fear and trembling yeah that's right I I believe we'd be more Victorious because we're so used to thinking whatever we want and we're okay because we're hid in this thing that nobody can see but the devil sees it he knows what you're thinking he's the one that put the thought there and the devil devil is he's trying to get control more control because he wants to he wants to destroy right that's right so the way that we think has everything to do with how we serve with how we serve God and and really who we're serving amen brother Ryan says we live in a three-room house it's body spirit and soul and he asked the question who are who are you and he said you are a soul so the scripture says but as for me in my house so for as for me my soul in my house the body I live in the spirit that's around me we will serve the Lord so you have to serve the Lord with your thoughts you have to serve them with all of yourself amen that's right choosing to serve the Lord is the most important decision that a human can ever make many people think because they've chose to get baptized that they're they're presently serving the lord because they this they did this one thing back then but it's only when we can control our thoughts daily can we be successful in truly serving the lord many times people don't know how to handle problems in life because they never learn how to control their thoughts and because the devil is not going to show you how to handle a problem he is the author of confusion he don't know he don't want you to latch into how to solve problems so he confuses the mind he and then he he sends fear and makes it like it's impossible I don't know what to do he traps you so you have to take control of your thoughts if you really want to be successful in serving the lord you have to control your thoughts must always remember that choosing to serve the Lord is a daily decision that we we have in our heart not just I got baptized but a daily decision we have to choose it daily and it's expressed that decision is expressed in how we choose our thoughts to serve the Lord our thoughts have to serve the Lord amen amen it's serving the lord it's a particular way of thinking yes it's a it's it's not just scattered whatever it's a decisive attitude of who is going to control your thoughts you ever have thoughts just going everywhere and you wish they'd stop you can stop it the reason you feel you can't is because you've been so used to not ever controlling them right but the more you get in the habit of taking control the more you'll see you can't control your thoughts you can't stop the bird from flying over but you can stop them from making a nest okay the way we think every day has everything to do with who we're Who We Are and who we're serving Proverbs 23 verse 7 says for as a man thinketh in his heart so is he not he who got baptized or he that goes to church this is who he is no but is is how he thinks in his heart that's who he is excuse me as he thinks in his heart so we must be careful of how we think every minute of Our Lives it's really Who We Are truth when we choose to serve the Lord we must learn to choose to serve him with our thoughts you think this thought you're serving the lord with this thought it's no longer your Switzerland to think whatever you want and bounce things over and to make decisions up there and and no that is not it you got to make sure that you're whatever you're thinking it's serving the lord it's not a Switzerland where you can just kind of do what you want to do for a while and you know think about it and you know a half hour goes by and okay I'm going to go this way no you missed serving the lord for a half hour you got to resist him steadfast in the faith you have to quickly discern what what Spirit it is that's speaking to you is it a good thought that you're thinking and the devil has a way of always starting out you know when he gives you a thought about somebody he always starts out by giving you some some uh true information well this is this is true information we can think about it look what he did she did and then it turns into a little judgment you can't wait till all that happens to figure oh Lord that's wrong you miss serving the lord right so you we got to get rid of that thinking where it's okay to think what you want for a while Romans 6 16 says no ye not that to whom you yield yourself servant obey his servant ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness to whom you yield yourself to whom you yield your mind not just your body but your your thoughts it all starts with your thoughts amen and then it will continue with your thoughts it will end with your thoughts your thoughts are important the way we think every day has everything to do with who we are and who we are serving don't ever ever forget that there are many examples in the Bible where men and women have started out the correct way serving the lord but end up going off and we know David good example Solomon Naaman Moses the children of Israel Saul Peter Balaam Jonah Elijah and the devil can even manipulate us with fear here here was Elijah he was bold enough to stand before 400 450 men right and then a little fear not little fear spirit of fear Came Upon him and then he's running away from one woman and and here Timothy he makes this this desire I'm going to serve the Lord but when he looked at the persecution he began to withdraw himself from service so you can start out correctly and any given time if you allow your thoughts to go the wrong direction you could stop serving the lord in the way that he has made that's right God has not given us a spirit of fear but it can come so we that have chosen to serve the Lord could still be misled by thinking the wrong way that's it you're thinking the wrong way there's it's not he made me do it she made me to the Devil May no by us choosing a wrong way of thinking we could start out on the straight narrow path that leads to eternal life and something begins to something happened and it caused us to slip away into to get off onto the Broadway the way that most people think which is you can think what you want say something different in front of people and they'll never know that leads to death Proverbs 14 12 says there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death now this way which seems to be right unto man I want you to understand it's always lurking around us every day is is looking for an opportunity to get in there it isn't just well it was out there in the world no it's with you in your home it's with you when you you watch that thing when you listen to that thing when you get on your phone when you're when you hear somebody say something about somebody right right it's always lurking that's right we've all experienced many times that we thought we were right about something and then afterwards we discovered that we were wrong amen it's true and we don't put much emphasis in that right right but when you notice somebody else that does it told you you were wrong told you told you told you and you think about it but for yourself when you do it it's not a big thing why because it happens all the time it happens all the time becomes the norm for us scripture in James chapter 4 helps us to learn how to remain humble in the way that we think because we can end up bragging amen James 4 13 go to now ye that say today tomorrow we're going to do this that or the other this is what we're going to do afterwards and we're going to go here and then remember this spirit is not this is not the Holy Ghost right the Holy Ghost doesn't do that it it it's simply the nature of man's the natural man it's Pride right whereas you don't even know what shall be on tomorrow you just don't know well God told me okay God told you how many times have we thought God told us right and found out it really wasn't we can be so tricked by the enemy because he you know the Bible says that he uh he places himself and the throne instead of God acting as if he's God and we think this is like the Antichrist when he comes at the end and he sits on the Roman chair is the Antichrist and here he is but the thing is he tries to take the throne room of every one of us and and as the prophet told us this is where he has chosen this is where he's at and and he he makes it look like it's really God and he wants us to go out there and say yeah God told me God told me this and it not happened why because it brings disgrace to God and that is what Satan wants and that's that's why the Holy Spirit doesn't do that even if the Lord shows you okay we still have to have a spirit I could be wrong we still have to have the spirit if it be the will of the Lord it just it's having that putting God first instead of allowing your chest to be you know pumped up like like you're something special are you with me for what is your life it's even a vapor that appears for a little time in the vanished away we think we know what shall be but often we don't so just follow the scriptures we don't we don't want a yield to that Spirit of boasting because we know something like I don't mean it wrong but who cares who cares that you know if you know if God showed you it's truly the grace of God let's give him the glory let's Magnify Him and let's follow the word amen all right for you all to say if the Lord will we shall live or do this or that see there's no breaking there there's there's no attention to be drawn to yourself something but now you rejoice in what in your bolsteins the very fact that you're you're talking like this the scripture is identifying you it's a boasting and he goes as far as saying that all such rejoicing is from the Devil it's evil it's wrong but we think we're so right we're having like a gale time rejoicing in what evil and don't even realize it therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth not to him that is sin so if you know if you know that you shouldn't be talking like that and you're doing it anyways that's sent to you that is sin to you in the midst of your bolstein of your rejoicing you're sitting Lord help us all right Romans 12 verse 3 for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to I think but to think soberly according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith so when we get all these we know faith is when God's peace to us personally and we think a lot of times God says something to us to find out that it wasn't okay so what we can say is that God really never dealt that Measure of Faith to us we just thought he did you understand so we need to not think higher than the actual Faith he's given us in other words a lot of times we speak by hope I hope this was God sounded good I want it to happen but it doesn't mean it's faith brother John how do I know I'm thinking too high of myself because it says you shouldn't think more highly than you ought to that means I can think somewhat right how do I how do I know how do I know when I'm thinking too high well anytime you're thinking about yourself anytime you're thinking you're more special than someone or someone else is a little bit less than you you're thinking too high we're we're all one in Christ we're all one in Christ and you know it wouldn't matter to me what office or position God put us all in in heaven or here on Earth it wouldn't make a difference why because we're still one in Christ the position has nothing to do with it we didn't have anything to do with it we're not called by we don't call ourselves to a position right to a body we don't God calls us and we're to be content in the calling that he's called us in but we need to be won that's what our Focus needs to be remember the way that we think eventually will lead you to your destiny let's take a look at Lucifer he was perfect until his thought became mixed just became mixed with iniquity in other words he didn't denounce everything about himself and that's a lot of times you know we look at how great we are right yeah God Made You great and sure certainly that the devil doesn't want you to take your your eyes off of that he just wants you to mix that with a little bit of iniquity and basically iniquity is not doing the things that you're created to do that you know that you should be doing the right things you should be doing you simply won't do them I don't feel like worshiping don't feel like going church don't feel like praying don't feel like reaching out that's all iniquity that's all iniquity Isaiah 14 verse 13 Isaiah 14 verse 13. you want to write it for thou has said in what talking about Lucifer's thoughts right now we're talking about the way that Lucifer thinks for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above those stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high you know you can say a lot of things in your thoughts you can have a big conversation in your thoughts and when you exalt yourself in your thoughts you will find you will exalt yourself in your words and in your actions so we need to watch our thoughts they become our words we need to watch our words and become our actions we need to watch our actions because they become our our behavior and our Behavior becomes our destiny it it just it the thought process of what we're talking about is so crucial you can't bypass that and try to correct everything else it just won't work it's like putting peacock feathers on you've got to pay attention to the way that you think it's quite easy to think wrong the devil is the master of Deceit he's capable making Believers think they're right when they're wrong John 16 verse 2 Jesus said thou they shall put you out of the synagogue yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he's doing God service [Laughter] here are people thinking they're doing God a service and they're literally their thinking's all messed up think about the times you've opened your mouth and killed somebody's influence and you actually thought you were doing God a service well I got to tell this person the real truth about it true thinking they're doing out of service the Devil he's a good trainer he teaches us how to send messages to people without using words well I don't but but the body has ability to send the same message by not saying an exact word the Devil he's a good trainer the Bible says in the Book of James our tongue is an unruly evil it's full of deadly poison there with we bless God the father and there with curse We Men which are made just like God at the same similitude of God Amen out of the mouth precedes blessings cursings a Brethren these things ought not to be so so here we are our thoughts need to be consistent they can't be bouncing all over the place you you got to learn from that trick that the devil tries to send to you about something negative about somebody it's a trick get used to it God has allowed it God has allowed the devil to put any thought he wants to in her mind it's up to us to take control we need to learn to hold our accounts accountable our thoughts accountable to try the spirit that's speaking to us to see if it's of God or or not it's impossible to stable our thinking when we just don't care about what we think so if you want to be a stable believer you have to stabilize your thinking don't don't think you just get away and continue to think the way you've always thought and become a stable believer amen amen if you always did what you've always done you're always going to get what you always got so you've got to take control of your thoughts it's not that hard right you just gotta want to amen if you you're lazy and you don't care you're not going to get anywhere right can you imagine how unstable the roads would be if the police only pulled over their favorite brand of vehicles so if everybody knew that the police they love Chevy's well everybody would drive Fords and everything else just so they wouldn't get pulled over it'd be a little unstable wouldn't it or firefighters would only be willing to put out a fire if it was in their favorite neighborhood or companies would be if their workers only came to work when they felt like it of course covet help us to understand a little bit of what it feels like I mean every fast food place you go to they got a help wanted sign and it it just it's confusing it's chaos it's unstable and that's that's what's happening in a world Imagine the grocery stores only putting out fresh produce and meat once a month and you you had to go there weekly to get your food what what that that's not stable enough for you so how do you expect to stabilize your life when your thoughts are it's okay this time to think evil it's okay that just doesn't matter what you think about it does matter that's what this message is about it does matter amen it's impossible to be a stable believer if our thinking is unstable the scripture teaches that a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways we can't respect some people and not others that's unstable amen amen we can't think it's only important to go to church when it's convenient for us that's unstable we can't be subject to part of the word and not then to another part of the word that's unstable amen we can't be accountable some of the times and other times we're not going to be that's unstable if we think if the way we think is inconsistent then our values become inconsistent sometimes we're standing this way believing for something and then sometimes it's not that big a deal you understand parents children need to see stability in your life consistency in your life it's important they don't know what to do if you're here and there and everywhere because there's going to come a time they need you our first nature is basically governed so much by feelings and emotions and our you know anybody that's has feelings emotions which we all do this is not a foreign thing to anybody here they're up and down sometimes you feel like a nut sometimes you don't sometimes you feel like um you know I'm just I'm nothing I just don't feel worth anything and I'm just not good for nothing and the next minute you think you're the best thing same person just hours later That's What feelings and emotions do they're not stable you can't rely on them they're not going to stabilize you it's not well I'm going to control my feelings no it's not about controlling your feelings you've got to control your thoughts the word is what brings consistency to a believer's life we need to let the word be our absolute not the knowledge of it but the submission to it submission to the word with your thoughts knowledge will just puff you up but but you got to submitting to it now think about this look at this word he will keep the imperfect peace whose mind is stayed on the Lord look at the consistency right there the word is keep he will keep you now visit it once in a while he will keep you but you got to keep your thoughts stayed on him when Jesus taught us to forgive those who trespass against us or he would actually reverse our forgiveness he was teaching us that we're not more special than somebody else he's also teaching us to be like him that God is no respecter of persons that he wants us to consistently forgive others not pick and choose who we think is worthy of our forgiveness and who is not worthy of our forgiveness there's no consistency in that there's no stability in that God isn't like that he's he's no respecter of persons he's faithful and just if we just confess our sins he he will he will forgive us of our sins and we praise God for that what's wrong with us being like that right that should be our go to be like Jesus that's what it's all about to forgive like him to know him in that power to be able to forgive like him when Jesus taught us to love everyone including our men our enemies he was teaching us about the father's nature and and that we we can't pick and choose anymore we if we're going to be like and we got to be able to love our enemies we've got to be able to be consistency anybody who who comes to Christ loves somebody but usually hates somebody else and and the more you grow with the Lord the more you learn that I can't do that but we ultimately have to get to the place where we can be consistent with our love and the way you do that is up here you win that battle amen amen this is what the father wants of me this is what I choose up here I choose to serve the Lord it's not just I've made a decision I got baptized down here and I don't have to worry about any other choices no you make a lot of choices every day you you have to choose to serve the Lord in your thoughts if you don't you won't be able to to do it with your life God is consistent we need to be consistent Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we need to learn to be consistent in our thoughts every day and the word is the only thing that can establish and bring more of a consistency to our lives man shall not live by the natural substance but but what but by every word every word of God every word that brings consistency this word doesn't contradict itself if you stay with the word you will be you won't be contradicting yourself how many times we look we've all looked at one another and at some time or another and say that person is contradicting themselves this is what they said this is what they're doing right and it's Lord help us control our thoughts every single day we have to get up in the morning hold our thoughts accountable all the time I often think about my thoughts in the morning because I know if I don't get on my knees quick you you think about the things that you got to do that you want to do that you plan to do thank you things you have to do and you think well that's okay now I'm going to go and pray but when you get down to pray after you've done that it makes it hard to enter in you've just got that much more garbage to go through I'm telling you the quicker we can get along with God and get our thoughts in sync with him the better things will be we need to train the way that we think amen and then our lives will change be consistent try the spirit if the spirit that's speaking to you is 100 the word then you stay with that thought yes but if the spirit that's speaking to you is 99 word and one percent oops crosses the word called out it's of the devil that's that's the the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it just can't stay all the way with the word when you discover the air you have to quickly resist the devil steadfast don't sit there and reason with it because the devil will prove by that one percent is okay God can still be in it oh I'm telling you if this word isn't for anybody it's for me we are not wrestling and fighting against one another against flesh and blood as the spirit speaks but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and I places no that sounds pretty bleak doesn't it that's what we're fighting against but if we're truly fighting against this tell me how you act in your battle in other words if we talk about the Battle that's happened in Ukraine right now we can talk about the things that are getting blown up we talk about new lands that is getting either taken away or or gotten back and and we talk about the artillery we we talk about the damage things have happened talking about how we need more Weaponry you know what I'm talking about right well what about the Warfare that you're in let's do you talk about it do you call it out for what it is or is it always this person that person this situation that situation how come we don't call the battle out for what it is and see the devil don't want you to really know what's going on because when he when you know that he's the author of Confusion And you can call him out when you call up the devil then you can love your brother who's in the air but if you don't call up the devil um there's a resistance second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 for though we walk in the flesh which we do we do not war like everybody else does in the world for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal like everybody else in the world but they're Mighty amen I like that they're Mighty weapons but they're only through God to the pulling down of strong holds did you ever in your mind felt so pulled down by thoughts something happening in your mind you just felt so weighed down so changed so I don't know how to break through okay about a situation okay God's weapons are mighty we don't have to stay in that but you do have to call it out you have to if you don't call it out he's allowed to stay that that's just the the parameters that God set before the world began he prepares a table for us in the presence of our enemies the devil is allowed to be there until you tell him to get out he's not going to do it for you but if you do it he has to leave because that's what the name of Jesus is given to us for in fact you could be the weakest Christian and and Hell still going to tremble right all right casting down imaginations brother John I don't know how to do that they just keep flying around in my well start practicing that's what this is it's a way of thinking casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every well most some of you are thinking they exaggerated no every thought to The Obedience of Christ all we want to do is start practicing that more I believe that we'll be more at peace will will feel set free we'll have more joy I look a man a man born of a woman is a few days in full trouble a man born of Jesus Christ is not eternity full of joy full of peace because he's been born of God we've got to get out of that arrangement of that first nature I don't care what we go through you can have peace you can have joy but you got to get out of the mindset that the devil has has has tried to plague us with see even though we've we've taken to stand for God we've got to take that stand every day in our thoughts every day we had a cast down imaginations and things that exalt itself against the word of God and and not just kind of you know resist it in the in in this in in the in the thought process of just uh devil get out of here no bring it into captivity put it under your feet you keep fighting until he's under your feet now he keeps buzzing back every five minutes sometimes you got to stay there in prayer right they that wait upon the Lord shall renew sometimes you just need a strong arm of Faith you take the sword and and with that devil sometimes we're afraid of the devil turn that around God's on your side amen stay with the word amen and having a Readiness I am ready to Revenge all Disobedience how do I do that how do I how do I make up when your obedience is fulfilled so you're in a battle that's the time that you need to be obedient yeah that's when you need to pull the thing out you need to call the devil out you need to take care of business right now because that's the obedience that needs to happen when you're in the battle there's obedience that's required not a oh man I wish somebody would just pray for me I'm really going through this thing look it's time to stand up right you know you didn't come to the Lord last week a lot of times we're just too afraid to take a stand because we're afraid to be obedient do you look on the things after the outward appearance we certainly don't we're talking about thoughts here today If any man trusts If any man trusts to himself that he is Christ let him of himself think this again that as he is Christ even so are so Eve so are we Christ so Paul is wanting us to understand is I'm not disagreeing with who you are but he was of Christ and the word that he was bringing to us was truth and we've got a we gotta we gotta practice this yes it can't be just a neat scripture that we we apply when things are really bad it's something that we need to think about on a regular basis amen choosing to serve the Lord and our thoughts it's very difficult it's it's easy to say it's it's hard to hold our thoughts accountable our flesh isn't disappearing anytime soon amen it's going to be with us to the end and it's constantly wanting to rise up as it were and pave its own way I'm gonna you know it doesn't matter what victory you had on Sunday Come Monday you're going to do your own thing that's what the flesh is telling us and we got to take a stand about Monday morning where our thoughts are going to go hey man even though we made a choice to serve the Lord it doesn't mean that our flesh is is just going to give up in fact when you get baptized that's when the battle starts ramping up when I was out in the world and this is this this is the um it's always been the lure of the world when you're in the world you don't have to listen to anybody that's why backsliders they love when they're in the world the people that left this message you know what I hear the most about people that leave this message they feel at Liberty Liberty well when I was in the world I felt at Liberty to do what I wanted to do but when I came to Christ you subject yourself to the word you you forfeit your rights now the Liberty that you have is in Christ and we got to remain in Christ don't be fooled by the devil into doing what you want to do become obedient everything that you know to do Psalms 23 says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want we have to learn not to love our lives even unto death we're not getting away from it every day we have to learn to hate ourselves and you have to alert to hate yourself so much that when you're talking to other people they know you hate yourself you know we have a tendency of forgetting that when we're talking other people right because we kind of want to be exalted come on now Jesus gave us a remedy to help us each day he said If any man will come after me that means choose to serve me let him deny himself let him deny the way that he thinks what's important his own will his own desires and he needs to do it daily that's the key amen daily the hard decision to serve the Lord must be decided on a daily basis so much for this thinking well I don't have to worry about the next service I have to worry about until I get together I don't you got to get rid of that we are not serving God like a holiday calendar no it's it's it's it's the way we think when we're not here it's got to become more important to you amen obviously we're not going to serve God by default if we're going to do anything by default we're going to backslide that's default and and the prophet said we backslide what 100 times a day that was back then and maybe he was seeing for this hour I don't know but I'll tell you our thoughts backslide us and and we we can't put too much emphasis on this the nature that's inside of us is going to fight us tooth and nail to The Bitter End it doesn't it it doesn't want to give up to a full conversion just like the devil didn't want the children of Israel to all goal you know just let just a couple of you go all right then the animals or he's always trying to get a compromise but God knows that we need a full conversion the devil knows we need a full conversion we need to be working on the part that's not converted yet right amen we need to be working on the part that's not converted yet we need to be serious about that it's not going to be gifted to us right character is not a gift it's a victory so we must choose to lay down our thoughts right here every day every day are you thinking the right thing is it proper is that a good thought practice it practice it you may think it's silly but I'm telling you it'll give you freedom because all you're doing is trying to get yourself set free from the the chains that the enemy has put us under Isaiah 57 verse or 55 verse 7 Isaiah 55 verse 7 if you want to write down let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts now let me see a a a raise of hands is there anybody here that asked God to forgive you of your sins each day so there means that we're there's times that we do unrighteous things is that is that can we say that not labeling us as unrighteous men because we're saints of God but understand we still deal obviously with wrong thoughts because that's what causes us to say Lord I'm sorry all right let the wicked forsake his way then righteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and that's what repentance does and he will have mercy upon you and to our God for he will abundantly pardon oh man that'll put us on everybody's face right there from my thoughts are not your thoughts wow how many times do we think can we just go through the course of the day God thinks what I think God likes what I like God accepts this never been able to cut the two in half for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my ways your way saith the Lord now imagine if we had the mind of Christ if we were operating by the mind of Christ those would be good thoughts but we don't always have because if you think about the minor Christ is humble it's a servant it's giving it's reaching out if we're doing that we can go with it but to go ahead and claim we got the mind of Christ and kind of doing our own thing it's one big ball of deception for as the heavens are higher than the earth soar my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts now he doesn't say there's a little bit of a distinguish here he says if you want to know the difference as far as the heaven is from the Earth that's how much different my thoughts are than your thoughts that's a huge difference we aren't about to tell the difference right we can tell the difference of black and white right but maybe two Shades of Gray you know it can get difficult but we must remember we have been gifted with knowing God's mind with God's thoughts it's right here and and you want to know more get into it more read more get on your knees pray more listen to a tape say God I want to know you I want to become you all right now the Lord is it I'm going to tell you why it's important for you to control your thoughts you have to agree with God's because God cannot work through you unless it goes through three more agency he's not going to just take his will and impress it into your life you have to say I want what you want for me Lord and that is when your life changes your life changes when your thoughts change and they become the thoughts of God Romans 12 2 says and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind we literally become transformed by just thinking the right thoughts it you accept it right here brother Brian says your mind is the womb to your soul you accept it here the word comes down in here and it begins to make a difference in your life Jesus on the inside working on the outside you you can't you can't look at your mind as the outside as a man thinketh in his heart there is a part that has to free more agency right here in the middle middle of your soul you have to say God I want what you want I want your thought here you know we're trying to get Faith for things and change things and want things better in a life and all these things and we're not taking care of the what needs to be taken care of that's our our thoughts we can't be scattered up here and trying to straighten our life out no we have to be transformed by renewing our mind with the thoughts of God except I need more of the thoughts of God that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God the only way that our life the only way we're going to become more like Jesus is when our thoughts are subject to become more like Jesus amen amen it's through the thoughts that your life the very nature your very nature changes your thoughts play such an important process we it's not like it's a different part of us to where we can just think what we want to think and oh I'm going to have faith for the word I'm going to have faith for this I'm going to come to church I'm going to Faith for this and I'm going to believe for this and then our thoughts are just well it doesn't matter what I think it does matter amen does matter somehow this puzzle's got about to come together sometimes somehow we got to be able to become Overcomers and and become stronger in the things of God Amen all right this is our our last scripture here in second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God so how are we going to become all of God when our thoughts are not all of God it's important it's important what we're thinking not what we're saying not what we're doing but what we're thinking because I I could be doing the right thing but my heart my thoughts are for the wrong motives my thought has to be I have to serve the Lord with the thought this with my hands that'll automatically happen right right but the thought has got to bring him glory that thought has got to please them that thought has got to worship him that thought has got to honor him that thought has to be him can you say Amen we are created for his pleasure right every day we need to get up and hold our our thoughts accountable if we become accustomed and satisfying with just hearing the word leaving and not putting it into practice we're just deceiving herself we're becoming a bigger deception of our own self we have nobody I don't I have no person on this planet to blame for my wrong than me [Music] and neither do all any of us so if we want to cry about our problems we want somebody to help us we need to Humble ourselves before the Lord you can only serve the Lord according to the accountability of your thoughts now remember that statement if you don't remember anything else you can only serve the Lord according to the accountability that you you hold your thoughts accountable I say that right you can only serve the Lord according to the accountability of your thoughts so the more you hold your your thoughts accountable the more successful you'll be in serving the lord and the more it doesn't matter what you think it only matters what you do the more you'll go back into the same old same old so when we say for me and my house we'll serve the Lord what we're really saying is I am holding my thoughts accountable right for me in my house this house this house that God dwells in we're going to serve the Lord not just the body outwardly right but the thoughts inwardly how many religious people have fought Wars killed people thinking they were serving God they never wanted to hold themselves accountable Believers today are are serving the lord but they're not holding their thoughts accountable we've got to hold our thoughts accountable let's choose to serve the Lord every day by the way we think so I guess for some of us it's a new way of serving the lord we think it's a it's it's always been there but has it right right let's choose to control our thoughts let's choose to hold our thoughts accountable this day choose you this day whom you'll serve so choose your thoughts let's make the choice every day to serve the Lord to the best of the ability of how we think the way we think the way we think it just plays a major role with with how are what what our life is becoming let's choose to pray more you know we're talking about Let's uh I'm choosing this day to serve the Lord okay how are you going to do that well choose to pray more choose to lay down our life our will our desires our plans let's choose to lay that down and choose Lord what would you have me do let's choose to present our body a Living Sacrifice let's choose to deny ourselves let's choose to love not our life see that's choice it's a choice we make every day and when you make that choice you're actually serving the lord right let's choose not to be conformed to this world don't let the things that we're watching reading thinking about the news don't let it conform you get into the word get into the message God I got to hear from you what is on your agenda for me today what would you have I need to have your thought we're putting this serving the lord more into a daily basis amen that's what we need to do let's choose not to talk about others it's choose not to murmur complain let's let's choose to come to church prepared don't wait for the few minutes that you had before church starts to prepare yourself you know with all the evil that's out there we need more preparation [Music] we breed the presence of God With Us and we need you to bring God's presence amen let's Stand Together let's choose as the bride of Christ to make ourselves ready by choosing the right thoughts for Life the right way of thinking choose to Love More choose to labor more for the Lord choose to give all that we have to the Lord is that your desire amen all right it's in your hands the way that we think amen let's sing that that little chorus I'm going to live the way he wants me amen I'm going to live away he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to give I'm going to love love till there's just no more love I could never ever out love our Lord I'm gonna live live away he wants me I'm subjecting Lord until there's just no more to give I'm going to love love too there's just no more I could never ever out love our Lord one more time let's just think about it close our eyes I'm gonna live the way who wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to give I'm going to love love till there's just no more love I could never ever [Music] Lord amen is that your desire amen that's certainly my desire and it's the battle is much greater than we think that I believe today the the devil has been uncovered he's been uncovered and he he can no longer nest in our minds amen amen the same fill my cup Lord fill my cup I want my cup so full that the devil doesn't there's no place for him amen [Music] Lord I lifted up Lord come and quit this thirsting of my soul Bread of Heaven feed me too I want no here's my cup give it up and make me whole [Music] heal my Lord I Lift It Up Lord come and quit this thirsting of my soul [Music] Bread of
