word father Lord we thank you Lord for this wonderful time once again bless us all in Jesus Christ precious and holy name I pray amen let us turn to the bible let us turn to the book of Psalm 42 verse 1 and 2. amen Psalm 42 verse 1 and 2. it's a very familiar scripture and uh heard many times from the Lord in many places through your pastor but you know the Lord put it on my heart to just take this verse from the Bible you know I have not come here with any other gospel or any other preaching but what it has already been preached so there's nothing new and there is nothing added or to be taken away you know so let us read from the word of God as the heart painteth after the water broke so panted my soul after thee o God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God may the Lord bless the reading of his holy word you may be seated here greetings to everyone in the most matchless and the powerful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord how many of you are happy to be alive today I am I'm happy to be alive and be strengthened by the Lord and and so are you you know that's why we are gathered here to worship our creator our One and Only God you know brother John spoke so many things about me and highly about me but all glory go to God alone you know we are just his workers you know we are just his vessels trying to do what God wants us to do so that we can you know please him as well as do his perfect will in our lives he's been so good to us you know after the Kobe attacked in India the Lord has been really good to us you know and see we are from a country which has got 33 million gods and goddesses you know right and because I'm online I don't want to say anything further you know but I am happy to serve the almighty God he's the same yesterday today and forever you know amen and in spite of the persecutions we have in our country you know you have persecutions in your country in a different way you know but in our country also the Christians are facing so many issues so many problems you know so please remember our nation in your prayers you know but one thing I have seen lately since and after the covet has come and gone you know but still there is effect you know in the lives of people you know we don't know I myself don't know why the kobit was sent in you know you know it was on a purpose and you know the vaccinations and all those things I don't understand all those things but I truly believe that all these sciences and all these inventions and all these uh things are for the downfall of the human beings you know but there is one thing about the Lord that the devil wants us to fall down but the Lord wants us to rise up and we are living in such a great time that we need to Rise Up from our situations no matter whatever we are going through in our life it's time to get up and Rise you know the Bible clearly says Rise and Shine for the light has come so I'm so thankful to God to serve the Lord in the nation of India thank you brother John and the whole church and the family for your love your prayers and for your sacrifices from time to time the Lord has been good you know the more persecution the more pressure you know as it was in the olden days of the Bible you know how much persecution that much people are accepting Jesus Christ in that country of India you know sometimes we think that oh what will happen if persecution comes you know but I think we as Believers we as the children of the most high God we don't have to worry about persecution you know you know those days during the time of Apostles you know during the times of you know the disciples the people the Believers being killed you know thrown into the lion's den we see how they sang songs and how they you know gladly you know they gave their lives to Christ you know amen and we should come to that point no matter we are persecuted but we are not forsaken we are tried everyone is tried here everyone is going through so many issues in life you know you ask anyone here and if anybody can say I am not having any trouble that means something is wrong with you because you are abnormal but if you have trouble that means the Lord is with you you know you know I understand that we make mistakes in our life we have so many you know things which tries to come against us because of the hasty decisions we have taken in our life you know the mistakes we make but no I truly believe you know he has finished just before we came brother John finished you know we are the finished work of God you know he was exalting in the end you know that's true I want to see weakness in my brother's life you know I want to see the flaws and the mistakes you make you want to see what mistakes and what you know what weaker things I have in life you know we are human beings but God doesn't look at us like that he always looks at us as a finished work we are not the byproduct we are the finished product of God why because we are saved by his blood you know he said it is finished you know amen and what the devil wants today is we should fall we should not you know he wants us to paralyze but a person filled with the Holy Spirit you know the person who has you know word in his life no matter how many circumstances how many situations he has to face or she has to face we will stand up amen and will try to move forward the problem today is you know many people are different drifting away you know from this precious word many people are trying to go you know separate themselves from the message of the hour they are trying to you know go away from the presence of God you know they don't want to come to the church they don't want to be in Fellowship they don't want to listen to the word of God you know many people I'm not talking about others but many of the people we know and I have seen in my life we have learned the art of doing nothing you know that's true we have learned the art of doing nothing because you you count on anyone you you touch anybody you talk to anybody all you can say is oh brother I'm busy sister I'm busy busy for what busy for nothing we have learned The Art of Doing Nothing man is trying to you know drift away from the word of God you know you know but thank the Lord for his word the person who has got word in his life who knows what the revelation of Jesus Christ is will never Drift Away at the end of our destination we are in a journey we are just passerby we are just sojourning in this land this world is not our home we are just passing through Heaven is our home and we have a reward waiting for us you know and the message of the hour it says that one day we are going to meet him either as a masterpiece or as a drifting word drifting on water doesn't know where its destination is if we are thirsting after God if we are longing for God and God's presence I don't say we will not fail we will not fall you know we are humans we have weaknesses in our life we do mistakes you know but I truly believe that no matter how far a person goes there is a point there is a time there is an appointed time in his life that that person has to make a u-turn and if a person cannot realize that he has to come back make a U-turn come back where he started from that's not human that's why many people come to me and he said brother my daughter is gone into the world my son is gone into the world and I always tell them don't worry maybe they are thirsting now after something else that's the devil you know God always wants us to thirst after him and thirst is a painful desire it's painful when you want something so bad until it becomes painful to you you long for it man whether it is the word or the things of the world everything is linked to The Thirst if you are thirsty after God you will be in the presence of God [Applause] since the Kobe detect all over the world most of the churches even today they are not gathering at all to worship God they still go on online but I want to tell you the impact of the Holy Spirit which is now it cannot be online God might speak to you through online but he does it more offline you know you know and today people have stopped going to church they have stopped thirsting after God they have stopped giving to God they will stop their Tidings their offerings they have stopped working serving God in the capacity they were once called why because The Thirst the longing is being decreased day by day and it's true and that is one of the reason you have a greatest enemy with you beside you who is that greatest enemy can anybody tell me it's a it's the it's it's it's ourselves but there's one more enemy you always carry that's your cell phone that's true I saw the other day you know I was just you know going into coming towards here I was in Philadelphia Airport you know and I saw a man he was so busy on the phone he fell down from the escalator what is happening the devil has occupied everybody's mind that's why Paul said let the mind of Christ be in you so that we will know how to use our mind so that we will know what to thrust after every person we are controlled by something we have a control tower and we need to realize today who is controlling us the control tower in the body and in the soul there's a control tower in the body that tells you the need that's needed in your body and it's brought to you by a thirst there is a control tower in your soul that tells you the spiritual things that you have need of something in your spirit and You by this can tell what kind of life is controlling you what you trust for you will go after and if you have passed after something you will do it anyhow whether it is pertaining to the word of God or the kingdom of God or it is pertaining to the things of the world why because your soul is thirsting after something but David in his life he had a longing he had a thirst in his life to see God God working in his life God speaking to him leading his life guiding his life and that's what we need to long for we need to run for the word of God today because this word is life the same David says I meditate day and night when we are thirsty nothing has to tell us to go to the Fountain of water and get I'll go to the refrigerator and you know take the bottle and drink nobody needs to teach you nobody needs to lead you and guide you drink water drink water no it is your body the control tower in your body physically when you are thirsty when you are hungry it tells you the five senses which God has put in US it will lead us to thirst after the things we need amen but the soul also has a control tower and the word of this hour it says that's the Sixth Sense that's the super sense that's the faith if we need to test after God we need to Faith have faith in our life why today people are drifting away from the presence of God why the pews are empty why people don't want to come to church anymore it is because of the unbelief and the Bible says unbelief is sin David says my soul thirsts for God for the Living God to the human beings to demand women we have been halted between two desires the flesh thirst to satisfy the desires that's in the body and the spirit desires for the things that's in the soul desire many times this war won against the other and you find today the great trouble today that too many people tried to live between those two desires for one of them the desires the things of the earth and for the other desires the things of Heaven if you are Earthly bound you will think about the Earthly things if you are Heavenly bound we will think about heaven all the time the Bible says in Jeremiah's chapter 2 13 and 14. beautiful words of God life-changing words he says for my people I've committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and healed them out systems broken systems that can hold no water is Israel a servant is he a home Bond slave why is his spoiled what do we get in the broken system what do we get in the system which is not good all we get is wiggle tails all we get is stinking water the Lord's word the Lord says you're wrong after the fountain which gives you living water but man is wanting he's thirsting after those systems where it's wiggle Tails it's you know that's why you know David compared the human being he compared himself you know to the deer you know a good quality of of that animal that deer is when it is wounded the deer looks for water qualities there are many but the three qualities I want to say when it is wounded it looks for water when the enemy is near it can smell the enemy and when the enemy is trying to approach the deer what does the deer do it jumps into the water it immerses himself totally into the water it's not my words if that deer can't find water water has something in it that when the deer drinks the water it stops the bleeding amen see water is so important for that animal amen and for us animals yes yes we also need water we need physical water without water you will die in the same way we need water called the word of God when it is bleeding it needs water when we are wounded when we are lost in our battles when we are going down day by day weakened in our lives what we need instead of running two and four instead of running Pillar To Post what we need is we need to run to the Water of Life when you run to the Fountain of Living Waters why [Music] why it will stop bleeding it will stop you from damaging your lives look at that quality we can learn from that deer today when it sends the enemy that the enemy is approaching what it does it looks for water we are easily attracted today why even our body has a smell you know many people are attracted towards us today we are attracted towards you know the world the fashion the things of this world and the enemy is like a roaring lion ready to devour whomsoever he can what we need to do we need to find for what yes we need to jump into the water we cannot walk like Peter walked on the water but I can know I know we can we can immerse ourselves into the water walking on the world is not important walking in the word with the word is very important if the deer don't get water to cool him the blood keeps flowing out faster because he's running keeping his heart pumping but if we can ever get to that water the deer will live we find that he also has another sense of smell that sets off an alarm in him when his enemy is near he's possessed this little creature got a sense to protect himself he's got a little alarm in him thank God for that alarm in that deer and I want to thank God for that alarm in US what is that alarm that's the Holy Spirit and is God a little alarm in him a little something something get in the Wind of the enemy and he knows that there you are sometimes a half a mile he can smell you and get away or a wolf or any danger he's able to sense it because that he's made up that way he is a deer he's a dear by nature and that sense in him is just one that God gave him senses to him to live by those senses when the deer runs into the water the Predator can no longer detect its sense in addition to finding safety from its enemies the deer finds relief from thirst in the waters if you want your enemy not to track you down all you need is water all you need is the word of God we need to have intimacy with God when you thirst after God you will have intimacy with God and that intimacy with God is only found in this Unity of spirit Unity of faith the more you thirst the more you long and the more you seek after God God will grant your desire and that is what we need to do we need to seek after him we realize that judgment is striking Great Falls of falling in Nations shaking the earthquakes historical things that we have heard of the days passed of judgment Through the Bible we see it repeating again again today the Bible prophecy said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of lot so shall it be the coming of the son of man and we see with our eyes it's happening man's Hearts filling perplexity of time distress between nations you see the war between Russia and Ukraine you see the earthquake in Turkey you see the signs and wonders science happening as fought all in the word of God of how it will be in the end time but still we are not able to realize that it's time that we need to thirst after something which can bring us close to God to test after something so that we can all be in rapture amen many times in our life God gets us in a tight Corners where we have to look up sometimes we even have to get on our back in the hospital or a bed somewhere so we can look up to see where the great blessings of God comes from the prophet of God said I thought comparing the deer with a man that's thirsting for God before the enemy gets there there is something about the children of God there is something about a child of God that when you once are born into the spirit of God receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit there is something about that person that can sense the enemy you can take a man when he's taking the scripture reading the scripture and trying to inject something to that scripture that's contrary to the scripture a man that's filled with the Holy Ghost can sense that right quick there is something out of the way when he gets into a place and that little certain sense in there that is done to protect your life you mustn't you must never go for anything unless it's exactly the word of God we must stay right exactly with the word of God we are secured with that sense as long as we are in the Holy Spirit what we need is not to be ruled by the five senses it's important but we need a super sense we need the Sixth Sense that's God's provided way for us so that we can thirst more and more after the Living God example in the Bible Samson we all know the story it costed him he had to pay a price because of The Thirst the desire he had but when Jesus was upon the Earth there was another woman who touched it after something else but came to that well uh thank God when she knew that the Fountain of Living Water was just standing right in front of her what she said what she confessed he said give me the water that I will never thirst again we should discern the time we are living in we should discern the day we are in today Sunday after Sunday service after service God is speaking to us we need more women as it was in the day of Jesus Christ who was at the well who can say I don't want to thirst after this world I am fed up involved the world is rationing day by day the one system the government system yes the whole creation is groaning come quickly O Lord if you thirst after God if you know that we are Heaven bound we will also pray that same prayer come quickly O Lord you would say brother boys that means we stop everything no you need to work you need to on you are the breadwinner it's important but everything has time everything has a season there is time to work there is time to play but what we have seen is even people today they are playing in the church playing with God we can't this is not the time to play with God the prophet of God said there are people still playing in the outer Court it's not the time to play in the outer Court we need to step into the holy of holies we need to step into the presence of God we need to thrust up to the presence of God we need to long after his presence my brothers my sister when you when you go into that presence of God you need to shut the whole world behind you you can't say I want the world and I want the word this too doesn't go parallel what we need today is to walk in the middle of the road don't go far right you will be starchy don't go far left you will be worldly what we need to do is walk in the middle of the road the start of the Living God this is the highway this is the gods provided way it's a King's Highway he said I am the door I am the way the truth and the life what are we testing after what is our desire today we need to check it we need to check our desires and if there's anything which is driving you away from the presence of God I think we need to you know ask the Lord so that he can take away that desire that's why the word of God says love not the world for the things of the world what is in the world the lust of Flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life everything is going to pass away Heaven and Earth is going to pass away but one thing which is not going to pass away it's the word of God it's our Lord Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what we need to do then play with God no first up to the wall no sir what we need to do is Rise Up judge rise up desperations you can't be desperate till God speaks to you oh Church rise up and shake up yourself pinch your conscience wake yourself up in this hour not tomorrow not after a week now we must be desperate or perish that is coming forth something from the Lord I know it is the Lord that is coming forth something that we better get desperate it's between life and death it will pass through us we won't even see meet God when he wants to meet you get a touch from him when he wants to touch you he doesn't go by our our timing we have to go by his timing Mercy is given Mercy is given but if you don't pay attention that Mercy will be given to somebody else I really liked it it got goosebumps on my body you know when I Was preparing pinch up your conscience stop dreaming [Music] it's between life and death it will pass through us and we won't even see it my brothers my sisters we need to thirst after God we need to do what we can do to please him as a husband tries his best to take care of his family and his wife and please her in any way so are we need to do as the wife pleases her husband so are we we need to please our husband we need to make him happy we need to thirst after him we need to serve him we need to love him he would say brother what can I give to God I want to say God wants everything from you if you question me if you ask me a question what can I give to God this is the answer what can you give and if you want to give you we want you have to give it all God will receive it God will surely receive what you will give but God there is a condition he wants it all he wants every bit of you he wants it all he wants everything you are he wants your life he wants your testimony he wants every minute you live he wants you to live right act right talk right do right he wants everything perfectly surrendered to him why so that he can lead you and guide you and put you in a place where I want to be no he wants to lead you and guide you and totally surrendered so that he can take you and put you in a place where he wants you to be but human beings we want to be where we want to be we want to do what we want to do that's why we are in trouble today the prophet of God said you have to have the oil in your Lambs yes we need to thirst after God as I told you my brothers my sisters I can see a lot of hunger in many people in India they are thrusting after this word they are thirsting after God they are coming into the light of this message they are coming closer day by day the more they are in trouble they have been pressured three and a half months ago a pastor they got him down from a prayer meeting and they cut his tongue because he was preaching this gospel many many facts many truths it's not coming to the outside world many preachers many ministers are being stoned to death churches are being vandalized but what I have seen that fire is burning more and more yes the more pressure the more fire in their lives because they know if they can only trust after God and his word even though they are tried even though they are in trouble even though they are persecuted they know that they will not be forsaken if you can look into the life of Job in job 23 2 and 3. I really like that verse job is in the heap of Ash thank you troubled on every side don't know what to do looking for you know God can you know help him but look at his desire you know as we read job 23 2 and 3. it says even today is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning look at this next line he says oh that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat where is he he's on the Heap of Ashes he's in trouble but look what he says I want to see where he is so that I can knock at his door to see Jesus 54. he says if I only knew where he lived and I could go up and knock on his door or something on that manner and have a conversation with him why you come into the presence of God to talk to him why you come into the presence of God so that he can talk to you amen look at the desire of that man his friends came and they said you are a secret sinner and because of that all these things are happening in your life wife on the other hand says why don't you curse God and die but look at his desire if I only knew where he lived I could go up and knock on his door and have conversation with him God answered his prayer but in a different way you know God answered him he said job got up your loins for I am going to speak to you and God came down in the form of a whirlwind he says Where Were You job when I was laying the foundation by this by the coming of the Lord speaking to him face to face he got so much of peace he came to a point brother that he said even though the worms slain or even if I'm dead even if I'm rotten I will serve God that should be the desire today that should be The Thirst today no matter what may come or go no matter what happens to us if you are it's a battle with sicknesses praise the Lord if your doctor says you are going to die praise the Lord we need to walk with God Walk In The Light not only send the light we need to walk in the light we need to walk with him walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of this world walk as you walk in Christ if the doctor say you are dying walk with Christ walk with God if your neighbor doesn't like you walk with God yourself up got up your loins judge this is the time we need to cut up our loins have your own armor which God has given to us the helmet of salvation the breastplate of righteousness the belt called Truth the sword of the spirit and the shield of faith and don't forget to wear the shoes you need it because you need to run in this race this race is set in front of us if you thirst after that price you will run in that race there are many who are running but only one gets the price we had a wonderful time in the men's meeting you know where Paul says you know so many beautiful things my brothers my sisters we need to steadfast we need to you know we need to be unmovable in our faith to see Jesus 54 again he says the way it is tonight those who desire to see God must come with a perfect heart with all strange feelings set aside with all my lives towards their neighbor set aside with all my lives towards other churches other individuals and forms of worship you must come with a perfect heart and he says if I I believe that you come with that kind of an intention that God is under obligation to reveal himself to you don't you believe that that God is under obligation to reveal himself to you here that's why we need to thirst after God that's why we need to thirst after the word of God this word is precious amen nothing can match this word no matter how much we try to go astray go away from this word remember if you don't make a U-turn if you don't know how to come back God knows how to bring you back he will take you to a tight corner and it will bring in such a situation in your life that you will have to only thirst after God there will be no options left anymore we are living in the end time closing of the hour we are just three minutes to midnight what we need we need more desire what we eat what we wear what we do we can eat all our life we can wear all our life we can earn all our life but what are we doing today to work for God in his Vineyard Paul says in Corinthians he says abound yourself always in the work of God Amen love one another and you were to keep the unity of the spirit we did more Fellowship we need more Gatherings we need love what is the devil's doing he's trying to play according to your desire he knows what you are looking for once you go on Google and type in something wrong and just go and if you see it is wrong and you shut it down every time you open Google it will be all one after the other one after the other War the devil can smell you he knows what you need he knows what you are Desiring for there are people walking behind once they smell what you need they just it's like a flood which comes in but if you are not like that dear if you can't smell that enemy which is approaching you you will land in trouble when we are wounded we need water we need the word of God when we spell the enemy what we need we need the word of God when the enemy is near is approaching us what we need we need to immerse we need to get into the water we need to get into the word of God my brothers my sister let us not take God's word for granted it's over the time is gone you may say brother Boaz I'm still on Mercy Seat God is still on Mercy see praise the Lord for mercy but that will be not too long we are in the closing what are we thirsting after let us think on that decision let us make it a priority that all we need to do is desire after him desire after his word of this word will bring us faith faith comes by the hearing hearing of the word of God and this word will take us into the rapture the water which destroyed the whole world in the floods that same water lifted up the family the ark and saved Noah and his family and how is God going to judge the whole world today it's by his word what word is going to judge these people in this world that same word is going to take us into the Rapture yeah my exaltation to you my encouragement to you today if you are thirsting after God praise the Lord but don't stop thirst more after him if you're longing for his presence praise the Lord but long after him more you know we should find reasons occasions to worship God I always do brother John you know whenever I get a chance I invite my hidden friends my Muslim friends you know that's my desire what I want to do is I want to sow that seed show them love and in my Ministry you know hundreds and hundreds of being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thank you Jesus and all glory to go to God only but the desire God has put in me he showed them love first yes yes show them the love of God amen when you show them the love of God when they see a change in you they will definitely ask you why you are a changed person why your desire why you are thirsting is different why your longing is different why you are a different person sometimes I preach a very simple message brother but people come to me and they say where do you get this Revelation from and that is the time I tell them there is there was a prophet amen but today you know you don't believe this you're not in the message no we are not here to judge anybody there's a right way to do things and there's a wrong way to do [Music] my humble plea todays continue thrusting after God as David says as the heart planteth after the water broke so planted my soul after the O God he says my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God may the Lord have mercy upon every one of us God bless you all and remember us in your prayers and the ministry the church family there as well as other churches which we have built in all these years you know I have a church permission to be built but the government is still troubling me and giving me a problem you know but I believe in God's timing we'll be able to build a church you know we build about 108 churches my dad and my brother and you know we build 108 churches but I thought you know this is the time that I need to do something for for our church and then and the Lord has made a way given us permission you know to the municipal Corporation but I still have many hindrances from the other departments please please pray please pray for the orphans boys and girls the leprosy you know and the elderly and the old age people you know the widows the widows affected with HIV we are working continuously night and day you know there are a lot of needs for the message books there are a lot of needs there are a lot of calls for Bibles you know keep all this in your prayers because I believe God is able when we do it in the right motive God will always send a help you know in his way in his time that's what I want thank you brother John thank you for the church thank you everybody for praying for us and for your love and for your sacrifices God bless you all [Applause] well I certainly love the message today we could talk about how simple it was but I really want to talk about how needful it was and the rest of that that scripture that he read about our soul thirsting and then the question is when will I see God and I think too often you know we go in the prayer rooms we pray in the morning pray at night come to church and we pray and we don't have a great enough hunger when shall I see God it's like okay well I prayed and we need a greater hunger to see the Fulfillment of what thirsting and hungering is really for to getting the result and um so let's just stand together and keep in mind when we go to seek the Lord I ask that question when shall I see When shall I see God When shall I see the Lord amen let's sing uh
