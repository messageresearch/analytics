So I pray everybody realizes that you have a part to play this morning to bring that sacrifice [music] of praise. Amen. We bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord. [singing and music] We bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of [music] the Lord. And we offer unto you [music] the sacrificees of thanksgiving.

We thank you that we could come into your house and just offer to you, Lord, a a a heart of thanksgiving, a a heart of praise, a heart of gratitude, Lord, that you've given us breath of life today, that you you've given us salvation. you haven't taken it back. And Lord, that you meet all of our needs according to your riches and glory. We just thank you for all things today, Lord. There's not enough hours in the day to thank you for all that you've done for us, Lord Jesus. Oh, we love you today. [applause] Praise [cheering] you today. Praise you today, Lord. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How &gt;&gt; how great is our God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to have brother Ron back. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And uh so good to uh see brother Ferguson as well been on our heart and just so thankful to see him pressing pressing in with all the the big family. And you know, the bigger the family, the more sicknesses, the more things you got to go through and just appreciate him pressing in to be with us because we need them are part of part of this local body. Amen. Now turn with me if you would. We're just going to read one scripture in the book of Judges chapter 6. How many is has stopped halting between two decisions? Amen. [laughter] Beautiful. Beautiful. It's so much easier to walk when you've made up your mind. You don't have decisions. Decisions are very easy to make. It's only when you haven't made that decision that everything becomes complex and hard. Can you say amen if you're there? All right. Judges chapter 6. We're going to read verse number 13 and have a word of prayer. And Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? And where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying, did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? But now the Lord hath forsaken us, delivered us into the hands of the Midionites. Let's a word of prayer. Our heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for your people that have brought the sacrifice of praise today because you certainly are worthy of all the praise that can be given to you. You have never failed. You've never slacked. You've never forsaken. You've never come short. You are the most awesome thing that we've ever experienced. And we thank you that your your people have come this morning to bring you praise for just that, for so great a salvation. Lord, we thank you for thy word. Thy word is spirit and their life. And we ask today that you would come with your anointing and that each of our hearts and our our ears are the the ears of our spirit and soul could hear what you you are saying to the church today. Lord, let us grab Lord the very essence of the message today that we might have more faith in you uh for our personal lives. Father, we commit the service in you. We trust you for these things. Meet needs that would be amongst us. Lord, do above, Lord, what we're even asking in this prayer. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God bless you. May be seated. Well, I knew from the very first song that Brother Ron was singing, uh, very first course that God was with us in this message today. And he's saying, I don't know if you all remember, but he's saying, "Open our open our eyes, Lord." I want to title this message, I am with you always. I am with you always. Israel just had 40 years of rest and prosperity in the land. But through this time of of prosperity, they let the bars down. They allowed their standard to become lower. And what happens when people do that? The enemy has a tendency of coming in. And in Israel's complacency, they began to reverence the wrong spirits and began to do evil things in the sight of God. So what did the Lord do? What he always does, he allows the enemy to bring them into bondage because God does not cross through more agency. And they became servants. And when Israel got into the position, they began to call on God for help, which is exactly what God wanted him to do at the beginning. And uh which is the only chance that any of us have of ever making it because God is not going to come in and and and and take away all of our bad choices, right? We've got to say, uh, I don't want those choices anymore. And and we got to say, I choose I choose good over evil. Let's just pick this up now in Judges chapter 6 verse 7. And it came to pass when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Minionites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel just like he did in our age, right? which said unto them, thus sayaeth the Lord God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage, and I delivered you into the hand of the uh I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land. And I said unto you, I am the Lord your God. Fear not the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell, but ye have not obeyed my voice. There's the there's the criteria right there. And there came an angel of the Lord, and sat under an oak tree, which was in Ofra, and that pertained unto the uh that pertained unto Joash the Abberite, and his son Gideon, threshing wheat by the wine press to hide from the Minionites. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him, The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of value. So Gideon did not recognize that God was with him. And often times we don't recognize that God is with us. And let alone our view of oursel is not always what God's view is. So God calls him a mighty man of valor. And Gideon said unto him, "Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, then you tell me why all this has happened in our life. If God is really with us, why are we in the condition that we're in? Why are we facing? Why are we going through what we're going through in our lives? And if the Lord is with us, then why isn't he giving us a miracle to get us out of this situation? like being shortsighted that the children of Israel had deafly left the Lord. And when you leave the Lord, bad things happen in your life. You don't get a prosperous ending, saying, "Did not the Lord bring us up out of the land of Egypt? But now the Lord have forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midionites." What a testimony. And a lot of times we can get that testimony that the Lord has forsaken us. And I'm telling you, the Lord never forsakes his people. Never. Never. Never. Never. Never. &gt;&gt; Never has happened in the history of all history. &gt;&gt; But we have forsaken the Lord. We have left the Lord. We have backsliden. But God never leaves us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord looked upon him and said, "Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Minionites. Have not I sent thee. Amen." In other words, Gideon, pay attention to who's with you &gt;&gt; because that's all that matters. When you realize that God's with you, then you can believe all things are possible. &gt;&gt; But if you have to think that you have to come up with answers how to fix your problem, &gt;&gt; how to get through this situation all in your own ability, I'm telling you, there is the problem. &gt;&gt; Our trust is in the Lord. &gt;&gt; God will see us through. And all of our lives, we have things that befall us from time to time. How many have something today that is in your life that has befallen you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, God has allowed things in our life. &gt;&gt; And you know, God doesn't have weenies. What does that mean, brother John? He doesn't have babies. &gt;&gt; There's no babies in heaven. He's not marrying a baby. We may come into Christ as a babe in Christ, but we grow up. &gt;&gt; In other words, our character changes. &gt;&gt; It doesn't have anything to do with our age. &gt;&gt; Tell you can be more mature in Christ at 13 years old than you can at a man at 60 years old. &gt;&gt; It's a truth because it's about overcoming. And some people don't like overcoming. They like blaming other people why they haven't overcame. &gt;&gt; So we have things in our life because God wants to see us overcome. &gt;&gt; We have trials. We count it all joy because in this our faith can grow. &gt;&gt; We can we can meet God in our trial because I think brother Ron said it's easy to worship God when everything's going good. But when you when things are down in the dumps and there's nothing really going in your favor and you praise God, there shows something. There's something deeper inside of you. &gt;&gt; Because most people worship God upon feelings and emotions and how they're doing that day and whether they had a good day. You know what? I'm going to I'm going to act like everything's good. I'm going to whistle Dixie. But I'll tell you when you can just live a life of praise. &gt;&gt; It's just genuine. You know, you can't tell if a person's going through a trial or if he's not going through a trial. He's still the same. &gt;&gt; And and that is what God is looking for us to become. So, we all have things that befalls from time to time where something bad happens. it's a tragedy or something hits us out of nowhere and we find ourselves thinking or asking the questions, if the Lord be with us, then why has this situation happened to us? Where is his miracle to take us out of here? Where is the Lord? We're we ponder where is the Lord? How many times we come in the church and we ask where's the Lord? Maybe we're we're wanting something to be ministered on. we're wanting something to be something more direct and we're saying, "Well, where's the Lord? I didn't see the Lord in that." Or maybe because we're not feeling good. We're not feeling encouraged that we we missed the Lord. Or or because we um you know, we we we had some some trial. We didn't even have have time to prepare for service or we come in, we just say, "Well, I just didn't really feel the Lord here." Am I speaking to anybody today? &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] I'll preach it anyways because I know it's the truth. You know, God sent a prophet in this age and that and this prophet was to vindicate that God is not just still the same yesterday, today, and forever, which is a true statement, but that God is where his word is honored. &gt;&gt; In other words, if you believe the word that's preached, &gt;&gt; that God is there. Now, how did he vindicate that? He vindicated it with a prophet to discern the thoughts intents of people's hearts because who else did it? I mean, there have been miracles of healings, but in this man's ministry, there was no man on the planet since Jesus Christ that ever had the ministry of William Brandon. Not even close. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying certain ministers didn't have certain things that, but I'm talking about as a whole. &gt;&gt; And God sent this one wave sheep to vindicate that his word is the same. &gt;&gt; It is the same today for your life, for my life. So we can have confidence in the Bible. So that whatever the word says, we know it's true because all the other churches didn't preach that. They preached the days the miracles are passed or they you don't have to do this. It always this you only have to do the important thing. NEVER TELLING US THAT GOD LOVES HIS WHOLE WORD and he's never changing on it. So God sent a prophet to let us know that this word is is is true and that he's always where this truth is being preached. &gt;&gt; Now since William Brandham's come there's never been another ministry like his. But there don't need to be because we already have the vindication. We don't need it vindicated anymore. All we need to do is believe the vindication when he God sent it. So God is always here. The fact remains that God is always with his people. He never leaves them. He's always there. And I'll just say it like this. He's here. &gt;&gt; He is here right now. right now. He is here. &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel him. &gt;&gt; The invisible God is here. The creator, thinking about it, of heaven and of earth. He is here this morning. The very one that spoke the world into existence. He's here among us. &gt;&gt; Who through faith spoke all things to an existence. who frame the word of God, the worlds by the word of God, so that the things which are seen uh are were not made of things which do appear. So the so the invisible God became flesh, dwelt among us, went to Calvary for our sins in the in the form now he's here this morning in the form of the Holy Ghost. The very God that died at Calvary is here this morning. &gt;&gt; It's not history we're talking about. We're talking about the I am God, the everpresent God. He's here, the one who not only forgave us of our sins, but he's here today to forgive us of our sins if we just ask for forgiveness. &gt;&gt; He's faithful and just to forgive us of all of our unrighteousness. Our advocate, he's here. The very God who's rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us. And he's caused us to to sit together in heavenly places. That God is here today. He just doesn't want us sitting on a pew. He wants us sitting up IN IN A HEAVENLY REALM WITH HIM, CAUGHT UP IN THE WORD THAT'S being ministered to us. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we come into the church and we just don't even care. Now, how is God going to care for you when you don't care for him? Brother Brandon preached that message. He cares. Do you care? Our body's five senses do not declare him to be here today. We don't see him. We don't hear him. We don't smell him. We don't feel him. our conscious, our memory, our affection, our imagination, our reasoning. They may not declare that he's here today. But there is one thing that should declare him here today and that's our faith. &gt;&gt; Our faith because the word says it and I believe the word. &gt;&gt; Forget about what kind of day you had, &gt;&gt; kind of week you had. Forget about everything except one thing. God is here. And he's here because he he loves me. He wants to help me and meet my needs and draw me closer to him and help me to know him more and to see me through the things that have befallen me. But without faith now, it's impossible to please God. Have you ever you ever remember I'm sure has anybody ever experienced this talking to your spouse and you know they're not happy with you. You know they're not pleased with you. You know what I'm talking about, right? &gt;&gt; Well, if you sit in church and you don't have faith, God is looking that way at you. &gt;&gt; So, it's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of a living God. We need to have faith when we come into God's house. We need to have faith when we approach God, not approach him in fear of, oh, I I don't have faith. It'd be better to just get on your knees and repent. Repent of all the unbelief and all the garbage. Amen. That you may approach God and say, "I believe your word. &gt;&gt; I'm going to take you at your word, Lord. You're not a man to lie. &gt;&gt; You're not a man to come short. You're not someone that has failed anybody on the planet. &gt;&gt; There's nobody that's going to stand on the day of judgment and says, "I caught you." &gt;&gt; God is true blue. &gt;&gt; He that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder to them that are diligent about seeking him. &gt;&gt; You know, it's not about coming to church twice. It's about living for God every day. &gt;&gt; Every day, God, what would you have me to do? God is here. Faith in him and in his word is the only thing that would declare him because the other gates won't do it. I would love to, you know, a lot of people they if there if there's a good show, if there's a good concert, if there's a good feeling, you know, there's encouragement, there's um funny, there's, you know, you just feel good. Yeah, that was a good one. But what's good is when the word is revealed to you, when you're in contact with the word because the word is God. He said, "Upon this rock, I will build my church." So, who cares if you feel good? &gt;&gt; Feeling good can only be a distract could could just be a distraction to be honest with you. &gt;&gt; But upon this rock is what I'm interested in. I'm interested in getting closer to God. Imagine there was a dog tied up somewhere in the church. I get your attention now. See that? Just a simple thing about a dog being tied up in church. And everybody wants to listen to me for the first time this morning. Now, we know he wouldn't be able to run around until someone let him loose. Is that true? Without faith, God has handcuffs on and he cannot move in your situation. &gt;&gt; He can't help us. Faith is the only thing that unlocks the handcuffs of God to actually help you personally. Otherwise, he's here. He's invisible. He's here and he's waiting for somebody to believe on him. Someone that will take him at his word. someone that's will say I'm going to unlock God for my life personally &gt;&gt; because we're not about let's do this is I understand when God sent the prophet I'm telling you millions of people long to see that gift in operation and who won it and who won But it's not needed anymore because if it was then God would have every ministry doing it. But he didn't say that. He just said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel. He just said that he would raise up a prophet to do these things. God didn't send 1,000 Jeremiah's or 1,000 Elijah's everything or 10,000 John the Baptist to vindicate that. Yeah, here's Jesus, the Messiah, the lamb of God. He just sent one. And if you didn't pay attention to him, you probably missed it. &gt;&gt; We don't need that anymore. What we're where God is LOOKING FOR IN THE CHURCH today is somebody to believe the word &gt;&gt; take him at HIS WORD &gt;&gt; TO VALUE THE WORD NOT THE gift &gt;&gt; because God is the one that gives the gifts &gt;&gt; but the word is to everybody. &gt;&gt; That means everybody can be on the same page AT THE SAME TIME believing the same way. Faith makes God real for our situations. Faith in God will move him in our lives. And doubt will cause him to just stand still. So if you're ever wondering if God's really with us, then what's going on? Maybe he's waiting for you to have faith. Put the responsibility on your shoulders. Don't don't be blaming other people, other situations, you know, how you're feeling. Faith has nothing to do with feelings. It's a different gate. Faith doesn't feel. Faith is faith. Now, we want to make our feelings faith. Listen to a good song. Start tapping the feet. I like this one. Oh yeah, I feel like going to church tonight. You know there I'm just just speaking the word. How many wants to exercise your faith? Hey, this is it right now. you hear the word, say, "I am going to I'm going to start believing the word." Because that'll draw you closer to God like you've never been before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not that we don't intellectually believe the word, because we do, but so does the devils. They got the same testimony. But the testimony that we're looking for is believing with our life. like this word is precious to me. Like I don't want to cross it anymore. Like I want to spend some more time thinking about how I can better please the Lord. &gt;&gt; Mark 9:23 Jesus said, "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth." Nothing to do about feelings, nothing to do about understanding, nothing to do about being a good person. No, nothing about anything except Lord, I choose right now to believe and God can move in your behalf. But remember, all things are possible for you if you believe. But without faith, God's just not pleased. I mean, you children, have you ever looked at your mother or your father and saw that they were unhappy with you? Yeah. You know how they look, right? It doesn't make you go, "Yeah." No, you know you're in trouble. But when God's like kiss, I don't see. All I see is complaining. All I see is murmuring. Just giving the devil glory about how bad things are in your life. God's not pleased with that. God wants somebody to rise up in the midst of their situation and say, "I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; I'm not just someone that calls myself a Christian. I actually am going to live a life of believing in God and trusting God in my situation." When we're looking to see if the Lord be with us, the only way to look at him is through faith. It's by counting those things which are not as though they already are. God is always, always, always, and I say always with us. Do not doubt that. &gt;&gt; If you realize just for a second that God is really here, it changes your whole perspective. Like if all of us could see that Jesus was sitting right over here in this seat, everybody look over here. [laughter] If we could literally see Jesus in that seat. When he said amen, we would say amen. And we would brother, would you hurry because I want to talk to Jesus after service. I want him to pray for me personally. Your perspective would change if you knew if you saw Jesus here. And your perspective changes when you really believe that his presence is here. &gt;&gt; And it's not just about church, but you need to believe that he's with you in your home, that he's with you in the car. &gt;&gt; And when you start believing like that, then it's just a matter of say your prayer and hold to it. Not where's he at? Where is he at? Where is he at? If you need to ask the question, what have I done to get away from the Lord, I think that's okay because God's never going to leave you. But the prophet did tell us that we can leave the Lord. And he also said you'll find him exactly where you left him. So if you just want to get back, I think that's what prayer and you know, brother Bam, he often rededicated his life to the Lord. &gt;&gt; He wasn't afraid to pray and say, "God, I need you." &gt;&gt; Wasn't like he was a bad prophet. He's our wave sheath. He wanted a closer walk with God. He wanted to be close to God. God is always with us. Turn with me if you would to Deuteronomy chapter 31. We just have a few scriptures, but you know how that goes. It never goes the way I want it to go. Deuteronomy chapter 31, we're going to start with verse number one. That's the fifth book from the beginning. Starting with verse number one. And Moses went and he spake these words unto all Israel. And he said unto them, I am 120 years old this day. I can no more go out and come in. Also, the Lord hath said unto me, thou shalt not go over this Jordan. Brother Bman, we still got some years of our life before we hit 120. But he finally reached to a place that he just could not physically function anymore. Go in and come out. And he says also the Lord said unto me, thou shalt not go over this Jordan. The Lord thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and shall possess them. And Joshua he shall go over before thee, as the Lord hath said. And the Lord thy God, and the Lord shall do unto them, as he did to Shyon and Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land uh of them whom he destroyed. and the Lord shall give them up before your face that ye may do unto them according to all the commandments which I commanded you. So the prophet Moses is telling Israel that God is going to destroy our enemy. Now here's the thing. This is what we must believe for our lives and our all of our enemies. And and it doesn't matter if they're habits, I if they're thoughts, um whatever your enemy is. And your enemy is anything that keeps you from loving God with all your heart. That's who your enemy is. So this promise is on to us. Verse six. So he says that we're to be strong and of good courage. Do not fear. Don't be afraid of them. For the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee. He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. So the enemy is going to be destroyed. And and what he's what Moses is telling all of Israel is that God is with you. The key was recognizing that God is with you. The same as recognizing God's presence in your life. When you know God is with you, I mean, who's going to stand against you? If God be for us, who can be against us? &gt;&gt; But if the devil can get you to think that God's not with you, &gt;&gt; then you'll be scaredy bones. The key is to truly believe that God is with you in your in your life. God cannot lie. He promises to be with him. He promises not to forsake them. It is God that goeth with thee. Brother Brandham said he is here among us even though we can't see him. That's what the prophet said. Now the evidence that God is with you is the victory. That is the evidence that God is with you. Otherwise, God is here waiting for you to believe. And what is the victory, brother Stan? The Bible tells us, "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even your faith." It's you believing that God will move in your behalf. That God will will remove the enemy out of out of your life, that you can serve God with a a clear, sound mind, with power and love, that you can be everything that God has called you to be. Because you know most people in the world, you know why they want God? For what they can get out of them. &gt;&gt; Not the bride. &gt;&gt; But the bride is the only one that has a true love affair with God. &gt;&gt; See the other people, they say, "Well, I want God. I want God. And I love God." They even say they love God. And the Bible say, "You can love God every day and still go to hell. They love God for what they can get out of God. And they love God with their emotions and their feelings. And they like how it feels when God's presence is there. And and they like to dance and speak in tongues and do all these things. They even like when people look at them and they're performing for God. But in reality to the bride, they're of no reputation. They know their reputation is Jesus Christ. [laughter] They have a love affair. They love the word of God. If you love me, keep my commandments. Keep my commandments. So, the evidence will literally be of victory. We're commanded to be strong, to be of good courage. Verse 7. And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him, in the sight of all Israel, Be strong, and of good courage, for thou must go with this people unto the land which the Lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give them, and thou shalt cause them to inherit it. And the Lord, he is, he is that doth go before thee. He will be with thee. He will not fail thee, neither forsake thee. Fear not, neither be dismayed. God is here this morning among us. Only believe, all things are possible. I think if we could just start testifying, God is with me. God is with me. &gt;&gt; I trust God. I'm going to see things move in my behalf. Why? Not because I'm great. I got it figured out. But because I'm trusting God, God's going to go before me. He's going to fight my battle. The only thing he's asked me to do is stay true to his word. Just stay with the word. The word says love him with all my heart, I'm going to love him with all my heart. &gt;&gt; If the word says meditate day and night, I'm going to spend time reading the word of God. And you know, a lot of times I remember I I did have some kids um and we used to have Bible studies and I do remember having Bible studies and I remember some of the kids not wanting to be in the Bible study, but they just they just sat there, but they never entered in. And I could tell that that's not what gets the attention of God. What gets the attention of God is really wanting to know God. Your heart has to be there at whatever age you are. Your heart has to be there. If the heart's not there, it's called religion. Brother Brandham said that's like the bark of a tree. The real life is on the inside. And we don't we don't really care about how, you know, people view us. What we really care about is having a sincere relationship with God. And it all starts with believing that God is with you in those Bible studies. God is with you in your home. God is with you in the Sunday school class. God is with you in the prayer closet. God is with you. Even if the whole family is blowing up, I'm telling you, if you believe in God, he'll be right there. Amen. because it's between you and God. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he prepares a table before us in the presence of our enemies. That means God is not afraid of your enemies. &gt;&gt; God is not afraid of your situation. God just wants you to stand up, be bold, and say, "For me and my house, we're going to serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Though none go with me, still I'll follow." All right, let's turn to another scripture. Let's go to Joshua chapter 1. We're going to see this same spirit move from Moses now over to Joshua. Joshua chapter 1, I'm going to start also with verse number one. And now after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses's minister, saying, Moses, my servant, is dead. Now therefore, arise, you have a part to play. go over this Jordan, thou and all this people, unto the land which I do give them, even to the children of Israel. Now he gives it to them. Anybody want some water? Huh? [laughter] John, what are you trying to do? Ree, you want this water? I give it to you. You're going to need it someday. Here. How about you? It's You got to take it. You got to take it. It's not easy, but if the Lord promised it to you, you'll have it. You can expect everything just to be put on your lap. &gt;&gt; There's things that we need to get rid of our life. The kingdom of God suffer violent. The violent taketh it by force. And we got to get, we know the devil is trying to keep us from getting the joy of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Keep us from getting our healings, keep us from victory. And we got to get in there and just say, "It's mine." We sing it. It is mine. &gt;&gt; Victory is mine. &gt;&gt; But we got to leave here with that attitude, right? I think we got to leave here with that song in our mind and our in our thoughts and say, "I'm going after more of the land." It it's it's not about just I'm in a church that believes the truth. You've been you're here because God has given you the opportunity to receive him into your life because he is truth. And it's not the knowledge of the Bible that we're looking for. Is Jesus said, "My words are spirit and they're alive." We're we're here to receive the life of the word because it's upon that life that he's building the church. All right? So he says here in verse number three, every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon, that have I given you, as I said unto Moses. All right, let's stand together. I want everybody to take some steps. move like two or three feet from your chair. &gt;&gt; Now, wherever you're walking, that now belongs to you. &gt;&gt; But if you just sit there, which you &gt;&gt; you're not going to get it. &gt;&gt; So, just tell the devil &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU'RE GOING AFTER. Because remember the God has already given it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So your confidence is that it's already been given, not that you have to fight for it. &gt;&gt; That's nothing. It's not about your abilities. It's about your faith in a God that's already given it to you. &gt;&gt; He loves you. That's why he's given you the promised land. &gt;&gt; All right. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Okay. We're going to have an opening scripture now. We're going to go another hour. So God goes there in verse four and he defines the the boundaries of the the borders of the promised land. He says from the wilderness of this Lebanon even to the great river of the river Euphrates and all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast. God he declares our safety because of his commitment towards us in verse five. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. &gt;&gt; Wow, what a promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I believe with all my heart there were many people that the devil anointed that went after Joshua from that point forward. So, it wasn't like Joshua wasn't going to have any battles, &gt;&gt; but he knew that none would be able to take him down. That's right. &gt;&gt; That is the God that saved us. &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE God that HAS REDEEMED US. THAT IS THE GOD THAT HAS CALLED us to perfection. &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE GOD THAT'S GOING TO PUT US IN RAPTURE. IT ISN'T US. IT ISN'T OUR ABILITIES. &gt;&gt; PETER WAS ANOR AND UNLEARNED. HE HAD THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; It's all about trusting in a God who's promised us. As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. As God was with Moses, as God was with Peter and Paul and Elijah and Smith Wigglesworth and brother Brandham. So God will be with you as well. &gt;&gt; He didn't stop because your name is John Martin. He said, "Whoa, whoa, WAIT. THIS THAT'S RON CLAYTON. I STOPPED." NO, GOD IS WITH RON CLAYTON. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE REALNESS OF THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; That he is the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's just wanting us to believe &gt;&gt; that he'll DO IT FOR OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; To trust him that he is the same FOR US AS HE was for what Smith Wigglesworth. Now, everybody obviously can't be a Smith Wigglesworth, but God can be with us the same. And did you know God cares about us the same? &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if we haven't performed miracles. God loves us the same &gt;&gt; and we're still part of the bride. &gt;&gt; And the relationship is just as close if we believe him. just as much. &gt;&gt; It's just hard to have a close relationship with God if you don't believe. It's just JJ, can you imagine going a whole week and mom and dad's not happy with you because you refused to do their commandments? Didn't take out the garbage, didn't wash the dishes, didn't sweep the the sidewalk. And every time mom and dad sees you, they go, it's hard to go and talk to your friends at school on Friday and say, "Oh, yeah. I have a close relationship with my mom and dad." Because you don't feel it. And we know we don't feel we have a close relationship with God when we're not trusting him in our life. &gt;&gt; We get in the flesh and we just start murmuring and complaining and talking negative and thinking negative and and before you know it, we don't really feel we have a close relationship with God, but the circumstance comes out right, we'll start acting like it. It's a form. Those are peacock feathers. God is looking for someone to come in the church and show that he is their Lord. that you truly believe that God is here and that you're here for a purpose and that you're determined to leave with more land than when you got here. &gt;&gt; That you're not going empty-handed. You're not coming just to fulfill I went to church. That there's some substance waiting for you and that you're not going to be denied. Verse six, be strong and be of good courage. For unto this people shalt thou divide for inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them. I say this generation, God is going to separate, pull a bride out of the Gentiles for a rapture. And this is what the bride must be doing. Verse seven, only be thou strong, very courageous, &gt;&gt; very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that all the law which Moses my servant commanded. Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. Now, do you see the joy in coming to church? Coming to church to find out how I can prosper in my life, how I can do the next thing that God wants me to do. This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, thou that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein. For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. Have not I commanded you. Be strong and of good courage. Be not afraid, neither be dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee, whether with thee, whethersoever thou goest. I want you to remember this in your life today. Don't complain and don't say anything negative about your situation. Don't think negative about your situation. What I want you to say is the Lord my God is with me wherever I go. &gt;&gt; I want you to Okay. How many's ever worked out before? Why did you stop when you worked out the first week? Tell me how easy it was. Very hard. I don't care what you're doing. I don't care if you're running. I don't care what you're working out. It's not easy because you're not used to exercising those muscles. And if you're not used to exercising, be strong. Be courageous. The Lord is with me. If you're not used to exercising that, it's going to seem hard and difficult. You're going to feel like a hypocrite. You're going to feel, "This is odd. This is not me." Well, what you want to say is, "I'm not murmuring anymore. I'm not complaining anymore. I'm not going to think negative anything more about my situations. I'm going to start trusting the Lord." But what happens after about a week or two? It's a little bit easier your workout. In other words, you feel more comfortable coming to church and saying, "Praise the Lord. I love Jesus today. God's been so good to me." Because you're used to it. You've exercised the right things. and and and God is telling Joshua to exercise courage. Exercise the the fact that God is always with me. It's no longer God is over there and I'm over here doing my thing. God is with me. If God isn't with me, I'm going to get him with me because I don't want to go another day without him. Amen. God is here to do exceedingly above all that we could ask or even think. Matthew chapter 28:16. We have half of our message to do in seven minutes. Now, how is that going to happen? I need to study and how to study. [laughter] I need to study how to properly study. But there's definitely lots of stuff we're not going to be able to do. Hebrew or uh Matthew 28:16 here the 11 disciples went uh then the 11 disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they worshiped him. But some doubted. Okay, so they were having a Bible study. Some believe, some are doubting. We're going to church. Some are believing. Some are doubting. Just a the reality of life, you know, where we're where where God goes, the devil likes to go. But he's going there with a different purpose. He wants to block people from believing. And Jesus came and he spake unto them, saying, "All power is given unto me in heaven and earth. Go ye therefore and teaching all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and of the Holy Ghost, which is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. Let's read this together. And lo, I am with you always, even until the end of the world. How many has been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus? Did you know God is with you? &gt;&gt; All the times you wonder where God is at, God is still there. He's waiting for you to believe that he's there still. Now, if we're going to be that group of people that just wants God, but don't want to do his commandments, we're probably not going to feel too close to him because God here in this great commission is calling us out to to share Jesus with somebody to talk to somebody about Jesus to do everything teach them everything I've taught you because now you are an extension of me. I I'm dead. I I I I'm not here, but my Holy Spirit's inside of you. Now, you go do the same thing. Share Jesus with somebody. I'm telling you, if you want to feel close to God, do his commandment. &gt;&gt; Why? Why was that emphasis there? Hello, I'm with you always to the end. You know what happened after the day of Pentecost? There was just a beautiful outpouring of God's spirit. Everybody was just dancing in the spirit and speaking in tongues and just had a wonderful time. And the commission was given. Now you're ready to go out. What happened when they went out? There was no parades, no fanfare. I mean, right now, you take the most famous singer. I'm telling you, they have a fan club. They have a place you can mail your letters to, and you can tell them how great they are. But these disciples didn't have fanfare. They had persecutions. All they that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. They needed to know through the persecution that God was going to be with them right to the end. The three Hebrew children needed to know that God was going to be with them to the end. Daniel and the lions of the the facing death needed to know God was going to be with him. David needed to know God was going to be with him. Look through everything he went through. Look what Paul went through. He he bore stripes on his back. He was stoned. God says, "I'm going to send you to the Gentiles. You know what? I'm going to have to deliver you when you go there." But God never left Paul. He never left any of his people. He is not leaving us. I don't care what the situation is. God is not leaving us. He is right here to do exceedingly above. Whatever we would ask or whatever we'd think, God is always with us. And let's stand together. He is with us always, even to the end. Let's sing that little chorus. He is here. He is here. Hallelu. He is here. Amen. He [singing and music] is here. Holy, holy. I will bless his name again. He is here. Think closely. Hear him calling out your name. He is [music] here. You can touch him and you'll never be the same. He [music] is here. Hallelu. He is here. Amen. He is [music] here. Holy, holy. I will bless his name [singing] again. He [music] is here listening closely. Hear him [singing] calling out your name. He [music] is [singing] here. You can touch him and you'll never be. Amen. Let's sing it again as we believe he's [music] here. He is here. Hallelu. [singing] [music] He is here. Amen. He is [music and singing] here. Holy, holy. I will bless his [music] name again. He is here. Listen [music] closely. Hear him calling [singing] [music] out your name. He is here. You can touch him and you'll [music and singing] never be the same. Amen. Amen. I like how that song goes. &gt;&gt; Listen closely. He's calling out your name. &gt;&gt; At that point, you doesn't matter who's standing next to you, &gt;&gt; who's behind you, who's in front of you. What's important is that he's he's calling to you. your name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do we know that psalm touching Jesus is all that matters? Can we give it a try? Okay, that's okay. We don't have to give it a try. Let's sing. Reach out and touch the Lord. [music] Reach out and touch the Lord as he passes [music and singing] by. You'll find he's not too busy [music and singing] to hear your heart's cry. He is [music and singing] passing by this moment. Your needs to supply. Reach out and touch the Lord as he [music] goes by. [singing] Reach out and touch the Lord [music] [singing] as he passes by. You'll find he's not too busy [music and singing] to hear your heart's cry. &gt;&gt; [singing and music] &gt;&gt; He is passing by this moment. Your needs [singing] to supply. Reach out and touch the Lord as [singing] he goes. [music] Amen. Let's do it one more time. Oh, reach out and touch the [music] Lord [singing] as he is his. You'll find he's not too busy to hear your [music] heart's [singing] cry. He is passing by [music] this moment your needs to supply. Reach [music] out and touch the Lord as he goes by. [music] Amen. And as they continue to play that real quiet, maybe we could just bow our hearts and think about, is there something on your heart that you really want God to move in your behalf for? [music] He's not too busy to hear your heart's cry. There's something on your heart. just raise your hand [music] as as you were reaching out to him. Amen. Let's just believe with our heart as we go before him in prayer. [music] Our heavenly father, thank you that you're here as the scripture says that we don't have to to pull you down from heaven and we don't have to lift you up from hell. But the word of God is nigh even in thy mouth and in thy heart. And Lord, we believe that your presence is here. Lord, you're here to do what? every what was behind every hand that was lifted. You're you're here to supply that need to to to lift us up above our enemy [music] to have that thing separated from us to to fill us with more of your promise, Lord, to be filled with the love of God, to know you in a deeper way. Lord, I pray for every soul that wants deliverance in this building today. May you deliver them in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, I pray for every soul that every every body, every whether it be a soul or a body that needs healing, Lord. I pray in the name of Jesus that you give them healing, Lord, today. Father, your word has gone forth. You sent your word to heal the people. Lord, I pray for everyone that's just desiring more love, more joy, more peace, more of your Holy Spirit. Lord, I pray, God, that you'd give it to them. Lord, if there's anyone here today that's wanting wisdom, Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus that you give them wisdom, Lord. [music] Father, if there's anyone here praying for someone else, Lord, I pray that you'd hear their prayers for someone else. Lord, I pray that you'd re remember our our our sisters and our brothers that are are some are not even here today because of afflictions in their body. I pray that you would hear their prayers, Lord Jesus. Touch their bodies, Lord. Father, I pray for these uh these members and the various churches around us that got cancer. [music] We pray for brother Bill, Lord. We pray that you'd remember Sister Elizabeth. And Lord, that you remember Sister Sharon today.
