trusting today that we are prepared for What the Lord Has for us I I do believe God is in this service it it's just been confirmed in so many ways and what's beautiful about it is I'm just never looking for the confirmation it just comes and and so we're grateful to the Lord that just we're just a few group few of us in this group would be gathered together he promised to be in our midst and just to supply our needs amen turn with me if you would to the book of First Chronicles chapter 22 can you imagine reading out of the book of Chronicles I think we have something special for us today amen 1 Chronicles chapter 22 amen amen Let's uh look to the Lord in in a word of prayer before before we we begin reading here and just we need him so much to bring this word to our hearts amen our heavenly father we're looking to you only you you are the one that opened our eyes to see that we needed you many years ago Lord you are the still the same God today that's opening their eyes to see more and more of you and we hum L bring this uh service this part of the service to you Lord to ask your blessings upon the reading of the word that you would that it would come forth with Revelation to every heart Lord that's here to every heart that's watching may you speak to us in a personal way Lord draw us closer to you and help us to see what you would have for us Lord we'll be careful to praise you for this Grace now we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen all right 1 Chronicles chapter 22 we want to start with verse number six then he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build the house of the Lord God of Israel and David said to Solomon my son as for me it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the Lord my God but the word of the Lord came to me saying thou has shed blood abundantly and has made great Wars that thou should not build a house unto my name because thou has shed much blood upon the Earth in my sight be Behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his name shall be Solomon and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days he shall build a house for my name and he shall be my son and I will be his father and I will establish L his throne the Throne of his kingdom over Israel forever now my son the Lord be with thee and prosper thou and build the house of the Lord thy God as he have said of thee only the Lord give thee wisdom and understanding and give thee charge concerning Israel that thou mayest keep the law of the Lord thy God then shall thou Prosper if thou take us heed to fulfill the statutes and the judgments which the Lord charged Moses uh with concerning Israel be strong and be good courage dread not nor be dismayed Now Behold in my uh and now behold in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord a 100,000 talents of gold and a thousand thousand tals of silver and of brass and iron without weight for it is in abundance Timber also and stone have I prepared and thou mayest add there unto moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance hewers and workers of stone and Timber and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work of the gold and silver and brass and iron there is no number arise therefore and be doing and the Lord be with thee David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his sons saying is not the Lord your God with you and have he not given you rest on every side for he have given you the inhabitants of the land into my hand and into the land to subdue it before the Lord and before his people now look at verse 19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God Arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord God to bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built in the name of the Lord amen God bless you you may be seated I know that was a little bit lengthy of a reading but we wanted to get a little Foundation here we want to minister on waiting on the lord it's a very simple subject um but I think it's worth diving into what does it mean to wait on the Lord sometimes we we pray about 15 20 minutes so we call it good cuz we're pretty busy people but we need to learn to hear God's voice spoken to us and sometimes 15 20 minutes don't do it no we've all been doing something and all of a sudden we just heard the voice of God now that happens but that is not how Christians operate only because we've been given instructions by the Lord uh to learn to wait on him and that's what we want to get into one time after Jesus finished praying his disciples asked him to teach us how to pray and I I just love the humility of the request and and he he he shares a few things with he says when you pray don't make sure you you don't pray with the intent of other people hearing you it's between me and you uh don't pray repetitious prayer is the same thing that you just always do every morning um you know so a lot of talking really doesn't make a difference because the father is looking at the intent of the heart okay so and then he says these words in Matthew 6:9 and we're not turning there but he starts off by saying after this manner therefore pray ye so he's teaching the manner and I I believe today what I want to do is get and talk about the manner of what we need to do about waiting on the Lord what it really takes what it really means to wait on the Lord so we're living in such a a confusing complex hour men's hearts are failing for fear there's anxiety all over world every every day there's more bad news just coming and exploding into the minds of people and this is the greatest hour I believe that we should be waiting upon the Lord and and and and learning to do it correctly when Jesus was in The Garden of Gethsemane he found his disciples one time just sleeping on the job and he says what could you not watch with me one hour and he says watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak prayer is used to keep us from a wrong spirit coming upon us or from us entering into a wrong Spirit think about that without prayer we're going to miss it because you know our flesh just feels it can handle anything but we notice what happened afterwards they just went crazy right they couldn't handle the situation they all just split up and they were denying that they were Christian and all this all because they didn't take the word more seriously and really pray Jesus speaking of the the time of his return gave us counsel and advice and you Brothers when we were in the meeting I didn't say anything but I was just listening to what you were saying Jesus said in Matthew he said uh but of the day and of the hour no man knoweth know not the angels that are in heaven neither the son but the father and he this is the advice that he gave about you don't know when I'm coming common he says take heed watch and pray for you know not what time it is prayer is what God uses not only to get us ready but to remain ready says take heed be aware look into perceive regard and that word watch means to be Sleepless you know how it feels when you don't get any sleep so it is hard to watch spiritually it means to keep awake brother bam said like this pinch your conscience to always be on guard for the coming of the Lord speaking again of the end time Jesus said in Luke chapter 21 and take heed to yourselves lest any time your hearts be overcharged with surfing and drunkenness basically what this mean is just consuming yourself with the things of the world yes they're just not maybe outright evil evil evil but there could be just so much of it that it just takes you away from from from the coming of the Lord you just kind of learn to get satisfied with living in this life and he said take heed about the cares of this life so that they come upon you unawares for as a snare it shall come upon all them that dwell on the face of the Earth watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be counted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to to pass and stand before the son of man prayer is what God uses so we can escape the spirit of this age amen so he can say that we're worthy prayer is what is used and you know prayer is one thing that we just don't put a lot of emphasis on now David Knew by Revelation that Solomon was going to build the sanctuary but he told him to wait all his helpers wait he didn't say God chose you you got all these helpers you got all this Talent you got all this wisdom you got all this knowledge you've got plenty of gold plenty of Timber plenty plenty you've got more in abundance I can't even number you got it you got everything that it takes you even God the will of God to go do it but he said don't he said wait the first thing his father told him to do is set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord why is it necessary to pray and seek the Lord if you already know what you should be doing if you know you're supposed to be at church or your post a duty why do you need to pray if you know you're supposed to read your Bible you're you're you're supposed to listen to tapes why do you need to pray first you we're we we miss so much because we don't spend the time with the Lord there is a reason David told the men and told Solomon to wait and seek the Lord first why you've got all the instructions you got all the money you got all the means you got all everything behind you let's go no look at after Jesus with his disciples for for three and a half years trained them how to witness and he said don't you go witnessing until you get me inside of you till you get the Holy Ghost wait now David had more going on in his life than we do can you say so I mean he was the king look at all the battles he shed a lot of blood I'll say he had more adversity than what we do he had more trouble than we do he had more enemies he had more problems he had more responsibilities than we did yet David said behold in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord in the midst of everything he had going he still prepared for the house of the Lord troubles or problems in his life didn't hinder David from preparing for church a lack of time didn't hinder him from preparing for church I just wonder if we've been able to prepare ourselves for the house of the Lord you know sometimes we just we make excuses hey you're lucky that I even made it here today I love that this is in there that no matter what the trouble was David made time to prepare he had a heart for God he had a heart to be in in in the house of God Psalms 27:4 we've read this before one time one thing if I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple look at verse 5 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pilion and you don't go to church when it's convenient when everything's going good and you know you got all this time you go when there's trouble because God has a word for you God wants to help you in the situation in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me for He Shall Set me upon a a rock and I'll tell you when God speaks to you that's the rock that is The Rock when he speaks just one word to you you stand on that because the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against that a lot of times when churchgoers get some adversity they decide to miss church but not David for in a time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion David knew where to go when there was trouble not what one thing I like about this is that David this shows that David never tried to handle his problems on his own didn't try to handle adversity and trouble and things on his own he he knew he was no match for the devil that was behind the troubles right he didn't say well you know I'm just going to handle it no matter how much God has blessed us we need God for everything we need to keep God first in our life and that's what that's that's what God wants he knew there was a word for him at church I'm just going to read a a bunch of Psalms if I could do that I'm just trying to set the foundation of of David here he says my soul melteth for heaviness strengthen thou me according unto Thy Word word amen the word is what gives us strength right this is all you find all these verses I'm going to read in Psalms 19 if you want to read it sometime he says I am Afflicted very much Quicken me oh Lord according unto Thy word thou art my Hiding Place and my shield I hope in thy word you can see why he really wanted to get to church he really wanted to get into the Tabernacle he said consider my Affliction and deliver me for I do not forget thy law plead my cause and Deliver Me Quicken me according to Thy word Let My Cry come near before thee Oh Lord give me understanding according to Thy word give me understanding according to Thy word let me let my supplication come before thee deliver me according to Thy word all according to the word of God I Rejoice at Thy word as one that findeth great spoil in other words we have found in this age that people come to church for the wrong reasons and just just cut out this church here for a second but just show you to the extreme they have kicked Jesus out of the church and they brought entertainment in because that's what the people want and if the people come I can get money and and then we can do things with the money yeah and God the word of God isn't even lifted up and and and and and we get this idea of what we think you know we get especially this you know we get our our our our our certain type of preaching right a certain type of a preacher and and we like that and we then we just start to we model this is what the message is and if we're not getting that well then what's the use of coming to church last time brother darl Ward was here and he was just sharing some of the stuff that's going out in the in the message world and sharing how you know some of the the the ministry is is saying that if it's not happening this way you got to get out of that church excuse me you know I guess I'm not mentioning any names it's okay but it's showing what's going on but you know God's a god of variety he does have a fivefold Ministry and I'll tell you the thing is it's your faith in the word it's your relationship with the word and we got to get to the place where God I don't know how you're going to speak to me I don't know who it's going to come through but as long as you speak to me that's all I need and we got to start coming to church with that in mind the word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path David knew that just one word spoken to him was all that he was going to need to make it through but what about today people don't endure sound Doctrine they want church for their flesh they should want it for their soul there's a big difference David said in Psalms 9 have mercy Mery upon me oh Lord and consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me thou that liftest me up from the gates of death said but I will sing of thy power and I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning for thou has been my defense and my refuge in the day of trouble unto thee Oh My Oh My Strength will I sing for God is my defense and God is my Mercy I mean if you got a revel of who God is and what the word is why wouldn't you just long to come to church and get one word from him get away from these feelings and Sensations and all these things that you got to see with these other senses and get in tune from the inside and and connect with God in your heart and soul I think this is one reason we really I believe it's important to get into this this great topic today when Trouble Comes our way we need to prepare our hearts because our hearts is a sanctuary for God right we've got the church right but now we got our vessels we are the church and it this has got to get prepared but we just can't just you know oh I think I should do this and I think I should do that no we got to learn to wait on God to seek him listen for that voice 1 Corinthians 6:19 says know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye are of God and you're not your own for you're bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods I think sometimes we want to meet God on our terms we want to fit God into our time slot however our ude maybe at the time this is the time I got this is the time I'm allowing you know I got a busy day I got a lot going on and and and and I do believe that if you are spending time with God Faithfully every day and that happens one day I believe it's okay and God will still meet you because you've been faithful all the other days but if you're if you're if you're not careful that becomes your excuse excuse of why you're not waiting upon him God bought us he we belong to him it is our responsibility to make time for him think about God created this whole world all the animals and everything without us he didn't need our help he didn't need our time or help or anything and he did it I I think we need to realize we need God a little bit more to give him that respect of spending time with him now God's desire is to have the preeminence inside of us so we must come to God and meet his terms we must learn to to walk with him to let him be preeminent inside of our thoughts and our minds and that it makes a difference every day that goes by we got to give an account to God for that day what did we do in our minds what do we do in our heart what did we do with our Deeds we we've got to get away from this um modern Church world only thing that matters is just going to church twice a week or I'm safe now because I'm in the message what we we got to be thinking about God's supposed to be using this vessel what does he want me to do today Galatians 5:17 says for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh so this is that white dog and and black dog and these are contrary one to another so that they cannot do the things that they would but if you bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one another how many's ever done that before howy doesn't want to participate in this uh this questioner this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh you notice when we get in a habit not a h hope it doesn't become a habit but when we get in the flesh and we start this fighting with with with someone you notice the thing that we're thinking is that we're having this fight because of you we never say the reason um I just want you to know right now right now the reason we're not we're having this fight right now is because I chose not to walk in the spirit which is the true that's what the word says this word is what we need the thing is if our heart is not wanting the word we come to church it becomes boring it takes a great effort to keep the flesh dead in order for us to walk in the spirit it requires a lot of prayer a lot of crucifying the flesh waiting on the Lord we must remember to wait on the Lord get back to a dedicated prayer life what does it mean to wait on the Lord too often Believers will wait on the Lord like they do at the doctor's office just go on there and sit wait for your name to be called eventually it's going to be called you don't have to do nothing just sit there you read any magazine you want do whatever you want and play in your phone you literally even get upset and bothered because you had to wait too long and they'll still call your name they'll still come and get you and that's how sometimes Believers think it is when they wait on God that he's just going to show up Don't Matter What attitude you have there appointment I got an appointment turn with me to Isaiah chapter 40 verse 25 so we're going to get into this waiting upon the Lord you know brother baham said God is hidden Simplicity amen it's not complexed it's simple Isaiah 40:25 says to whom then will you liken me or shall I be equal sayith the Holy One lift up your eyes on high and be hold who have created these things that bring out their host be by number he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power and not one fail think about this eclipse and the sun the sun just doesn't fail well where did that all come from what about all the stars that are Shining that Northstar is still there the one that the uh the Wise Men followed I mean God has power he has power for us why sayest thou oh Jacob and speakest oh Israel my way is hid from the Lord and my judgment passeth over from my God hast thou not known has thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the Creator the ends of the Earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength and then he gives this example we all seen this even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall I mean young men having heart attacks you know we can only go so far I mean I would love to be young again I'm wondering what I would do different but even young run out of strength at some time but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles and they shall run and they shall not be weary and they shall walk and they shall not faint now that's because God is giving the person who Waits on him strength all we got to do is wait that's a pretty good deal I don't got to figure out a way to get the strength I don't got to invent it all I got to do is wait on him but I can't wait like I'm in the doctor's office I can't just wait for him to kind of show up waiting upon the Lord can feel real difficult at times sometimes the Lord feels close and other times you're actually just left with wondering was he even there did he show up did the time that I just spend in prayer did it Avail anything or did it just appease my conscience because I was supposed to pray we left wondering should I prayed longer waiting upon the [Music] Lord is not like waiting for a certain time to show up like an appointment dinner Church to start or the eclipse the solar eclipse we were waiting for the time it was going to happen we heard about this weeks ago and then Monday came and we thought about it it just happened but we can't wait on the Lord like that we can't have that kind of thinking that's not what he's meaning that's not going to give you strength going and sit in the room all day just wait for him to show up so you can have strength it's not going to work like that waiting upon the Lord is completely different when we're waiting for something in this life we don't have to do anything except wait what I mean is simply like I had to meet the um the Livingston County Health Department here this week and and uh I was supposed to meet him here at 1:30 and I I was here and he wasn't here at 1:30 but I knew he was going to show up but that isn't how you wait on the Lord he don't have to show up he don't have to show up because you want him to show up God doesn't move according to our time schedule he has his own time schedule the Bible tells us and we sing about it God does everything beautiful in his time his time when we're waiting on the Lord for strength it isn't like going through the drive-thru at Tim Horton's give me my medium with three creams you know sometimes I go there they just say pull forward they don't even let me talk did you ever have to wait in line a long time and then even Grumble about a little bit your flesh isn't going to like waiting on the Lord then because if we're bothered having to wait to get our food at the restaurant hey Sunday we had to wait a while to get that food it was like consciously a long time and if that bothers you then waiting on the Lord the way he wants is going to really bother your flesh and all we're doing is we're trying to understand that it takes more than just giving God what we want to give them and then we wonder why we don't have strength to spiritually lay down our life the next day I mean we ought to be to a place of having a relationship with God that when we get in prayer we hear from God we literally hear from him we get strength to obey the word we get strength to to to to make right our wrongs to to to move forward to die out to to because we're preparing the vessel the sanctuary for the ark to come in which is which is God to come inside and all the great blessings that come with the Holy Ghost when we wait on the Lord we're preparing our Tabernacle for him and this is the best way to look at this when you truly wait on the Lord you're preparing your Tabernacle for him so how do you prepare yourself we want when the Lord shows up you're happy I don't care if you're crying or not you're happy there's joy Psalm 1611 said in thy presence is fullness of joy Nehemiah 8:10 says for the joy of the Lord is your strength so the very fact that God shows up in your prayer time that he shows up will renew your strength but without it we're on our own trying to figure it out trying to get others trouble how do we prepare our human Tabernacle for him you're coming into the presence of the Lord and he's coming into you when we come into His presence we need to remember what he requires what does it require when we come into His presence well what happens just think about the Tabernacle here I will enter his gates with Thanksgiving I come into his his courts with praise if if you're going to come into church and you're going to be like a a bump on the log don't expect God to bless you spiritually because you're not giv giving God an offering a praise offering sometimes we act like God is is not worthy of a great praise offering we do you know how we act like that when we don't give it to them we're making a statement he's not worthy you think you're making a statement I don't feel good today I'm going through a trial you don't know nothing about it you may be thinking that but what you're really doing is saying God is not worthy of my praise and my troubles David prepared for the sanctuary for God to come in we need to as well we want to prepare ourselves before we get here I like with that one brother he said uh and I don't know which brother it was and please forgive me but it was a brother that was just preaching here not not long ago and he said uh you know people get excited uh they get excited to go to the ball games and and uh you've heard of tailgating right they'll go there hours before to tailgate the game hasn't even started maybe the players didn't even show up yet I don't know they just get there pretty early and they're actually prepared before the game starts to get in tune and I think that's how David was about getting into church he couldn't wait for the doors to be open he couldn't wait to get there because he saw there was a real value there at church a real value we got to get excited we got to praise the lord we got to create an atmosphere for the one who created all things so we come with our praise offering we enter the gates with Thanksgiving I want when you're waiting on the Lord give him a praise offering first forget about what you're going through forget about what you think's important to you and if I could just say this with a little bit of respect God help me here if I'm wrong hey look every time we come to the Lord in prayer we've got sin [Music] right give him praise worship Him Praise Him your your sin your your apology and your sincerity of asking forgiveness will be so much more real and so like I said I'm I'm just saying after this manner okay I'm just after this that's all I'm doing I'm not trying to Jesus J didn't say pray this Our Father s he said after this manner I just think you know we leave out the praise or we wait till the end to say thank you and the thing is he he he deserves uh uh you're this is the church we sing the song enter I will enter his gates with Thanksgiving I'll enter his courts with praise well when you're in your prayer closet and you're you're you're making ready you're preparing the temple for him to come into you've got to do the same thing you've got to praise him and you got to praise him more than you feel like it don't be the judge don't be the judge give him always give him more than what you feel because number one your flesh Don't Want To Praise Him and I'm gonna tell you why it's too proud it's arrogant it thinks it don't have to because God knows your heart look God is worthy to be praised and this is what it requires if you God inhabits the Praises of his people so why wouldn't you want to praise them you're you're you want his presence to come so you have strength in your troubles all right so when we come we want to come with humility I think sometimes we come to God with an attitude like it or not here I am this is all you're getting I'm down in the dubs and you're just going to have to live with it sometimes we don't feel a need to Humble ourselves anymore I understand a lot of times when we come to God we absolutely feel terrible I understand that but God will not accept some excuse like I'm not feeling good so we don't have to Humble oursel you've got to press through all the garbage press through humble yourself for God's presence because you know just think about it God is not going to come and just zap your problem out of your life like a bug zapper he's not going to do that but he will give you strength to go through it and that's what we're coming in to his presence for is for strength so we can get up and face this thing and be an overcomer trust him that he's going to take is through God resisteth the proud but he gives grace to the humble so we come to him with clothes of humility we're wearing those clothes because he said a humble and contrite spirit I'll not despise you have that I'm there you're not going to be the only one that he doesn't come to nobody about to stand before him on the day of judgment and said you didn't keep your word God keeps his word God don't have to change and I be honest with you I don't want God to change for me I am Unworthy of his presence every single time he comes I Feel So Unworthy and I'm willing to wait do whatever I got to do for him to come but I'm going to say this if we want our lives better we want to be a closer walk with God we're going to have to learn to spend more times more often with spending time with him in prayer learning to wait the way he wants us to wait when we come and we're waiting on the Lord we need to have a Zeal to repent a Zeal can you imagine a Zeal you seen somebody with a Zeal they just seem to be happy passionate they're putting their energy in to it they're doing a good job with it they're not well you know I'm kind of sorry you know be zous and repent choose this day which side you're on as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zalias therefore and repent Hebrews 12:5 says and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not the chasing of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him you know I'd rather be in God's presence and get rebuked than to be out of his presence and not get rebuked it's scary it's scary outside of God's presence there's no refuge there's no Comfort there's no peace there's no joy you don't got love to love your enemies it's a horrible thing to be out of the presence of God it's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of a living God so when we come we need to come to God seeking the face of God this is really what I want to get into for the last 15 minutes here seeking the face of God psalms 27 says therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy praise God when's the last time we've offered sacrifices of Joy see amariah she's she's offering one right now it's a sacrifice of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord here oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou sest seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I Seek You know sometimes I I just let me just ask this question when was the last time you literally heard God tell you seek his face like what's the purpose what's the purpose David was King he had everything but God want wanted him to seek his face this is part of waiting on the Lord this is part of getting strength because he's crying Lord help me help me answer me help me with my troubles I I I'm crying out to you with my voice and God just says when you told me to seek your face my heart just said I'm going to do it I'm not going to get beat over the head I'm not going to wait till I got everything caught up my taxes are paid I all this is the day this is the hour to be so close to God that whatever he says we just do it the flesh doesn't find it easy or comfortable to seek the Lord fact a lot of times when we pray it's uncomfortable because the flesh don't want to be there uh for the if I could say this for the most part why haven't we had many people come to the altar lately remember how the people used to come to the altar at the before at the beginning people were coming all the time after a while it's just not fun come on I'm I'm just being honest You' be honest with me too it's not comfortable to pray but we still need to do it amen it hurts to crucify the flesh it's it's hard to Humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God it's so much easier to say I'm a Christian and I'm humble I'm already under the hand of God God's already with me and it by us spending more time in prayer it gives God a chance to deal with us inside because we hear outside we hear outside but we need to get still we need to get still be still and know I am God he wants us to know him he wants us to know what he wants us to do he wants to give us instructions of how to help the Tabernacle that he has made a decision with you a covenant with you to live inside of you through eternity now that's not your flesh and let me just say this it's not just the Tabernacle that he has waiting for you you then what is it brother John it's the character that you're molding right now on this planet brother Bram said that's the only thing you're taking with you and you have a chance to build character by getting more real with God instead of just trying to skip by with you know what feels good to you fall in love with him maybe there's something more he wants you to do praise the Lord Psalms 104 says the wicked through the pride of his countenance he will not seek after God for God is not in all his thoughts so it requires humility and determination to press through the flesh into the presence of God I believe there's a reward for pressing beyond our carnal flesh why should God give the True Believer who Waits on him strength why should he give that to the same person who's unwilling to wait on him so there's a reward for those who wait on the Lord one time Jesus told a woman that she didn't know what she was even worshiping you know in John 4 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father is seeking such to worship him now God is a spirit and they that worship him they must do it the right way must be in spirit and it must be in truth well how do I know I'm there care enough care enough keep going you'll know you're doing it right when his presence [Laughter] comes come on he's a rewarder to them that diligently seek Him waiting is not waiting waiting is pressing into the spirit of God where he's at amen there is a difference waiting in office is like this you could just wait all day tomorrow I'm going to go on then in the morning I'm going to be there at 7 o'clock I'm going to go in the office and I'm going to give my blood just to find out what's wrong with it that's all and I'm gonna wait and it's going to happen I'm going to get the big needle but you know you just can't go into the prayer room and just sit there waiting on God is not like waiting like we wait we ought to be up and doing like he told them be up and doing labor to enter into the presence of the Lord Psalms 34:10 says the Lions do lack the Young Lions do lack and they suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing look at that some a blessing comes from seeking the Lord enough shall not want any good thing I believe you're going to have it amen that that's scripture I didn't write it I didn't make that up you know if you're if you're doubting this you're not doubting me you're doubting the the word Come Ye children hearken unto me and I will teach you the fear of the Lord I think that's one thing that God wants to do when we get down and we stay there long enough labor to enter in God wants to teach us how to respect him more how to reverence him more we may think we do and we do always when we're comparing oursel with somebody that doesn't do it enough but you know the bride is going to be such a special people God wants to commune with us he wants to speak to our hearts he wants us to hear that still Small Voice he wants to teach us to respect him more to fill us with more of his Spirit Luke 11:9 says and I say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open unto you now that word ask when you ask if I'm going to go to you and I'm going to ask you can I please please um borrow your Bible or can I please have a dollar for a coffee I'm I'm gonna ask but this word ask isn't like that this word if you look it up it means beg it means crave it means require call for it's I won't take no for an answer that word seek it means to worship after look it up it means to worship how many times do we wait on the Lord we're seeking him but we just don't want to worship see we're not we're not doing what we need to be doing according to the scriptures so we're searching the scriptures tonight we're knocking can you imagine knocking okay you somebody comes over to your house and they knock on the door they're coming over for dinner but they don't want to barge in they're knocking on the door what are they doing that they're trying to get your attention and they're and and and here's the thing we want God to come into us and we want to come into God so we're knocking Lord hear me I'm knocking we've gotten away from Biblical calling on the name of the Lord and then we don't really get into his presence and we don't feel him and then we just walk out just a in the form of godliness trying to handle life and all of our problems trying to be a a religious person I just I want him inside of me so bad we've got to be willing to do whatever it takes for everyone that askthe findeth and to him that knocketh it shall shall be open see that's the promise if it ain't happening keep asking keep seeking keep knocking because the word of God cannot you know think about this how many people have actually spent time with God asking seeking knocking and God didn't show up God didn't give them what they want and they literally called God a liar but we know God it is impossible for God to lie we have to conclude that that person did not meet the requirement because God can't fail they must have failed that's why when we spend time with them we've got to be clothed with humility because because we can't entertain those thoughts if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone if he ask for fish will for a fish give him a serpent or for uh or if he shall ask an egg shall he give shall offer a scorpion if ye then be evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your heavenly father give you the holy give the Holy Ghost to them that ask him you think about it we're sitting at the dinner table and I say could you please pass me the the pepper we do that a lot at our table because we like pepper I ask the pepper comes but that's not how you ask the Lord now I know it's as simple as it is as simple as that but we don't know if God wants something out of us that's the whole purpose of waiting on him about this a person come to the Altar and offers their gift to the Lord and God's like well this is a wonderful thing you're giving me this this gift you're offering me yourself and and and praise and you want to work for me but before I receive this I need you to go make things right there are things that God may want of us before we get what we want from God and and it's not for me to tell you I don't know but what we do need to do is get serious about developing this relationship with God spend more time with him because anybody can just say well yeah every you know everything's right between me and the Lord until it's not so we come with a praise offer we come with humility come with a Zeal to repent we come seeking his faith and we come with confidence the Bible says without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and he's a rewarder to them that diligently seek Him and the bride of Christ I believe is building their faith just like Enoch the Bible says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found he was not found why what's the reason because God had translated him for before his translation he had a an amazing testimony he didn't see the the the blind race or the blind's eyes come open he didn't see the the dead raay but he had an amazing testimony he he he pleased the Bible says he pleased God that is an amazing testimony the bride will have that testimony right before the Rapture I believe that with all my heart all right waiting on the Lord is completely different than waiting on anything else Psalms 27:13 says I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living verse 14 wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord now look part of this is you know we're just know brother Bram said I'm just hitting the highlights you know other ministers are gonna they're going to dig deep they're going to get the Nuggets they're going to break it to you I'm just going to say it like this I am just hitting I'm just hitting the high spots you need to get in prayer and start putting these things into practice I'll say it like this to let's say to whoever is the most closest one in the church to the Lord for now I say this to that person would you not want to be closer would you not want to be closer this is a good word for all of us it's it's it it all we have to do is do our part because God is faithful to do his part do you believe that God will reward us with his presence it'll give us inner strength and joy and peace and you know what happens when you have joy and peace and love and strength that means if somebody does slap you on the face you can turn the other cheek you're not going to get bent out of shape you're not going to lose it right get so full of God that when you tip over nothing but him comes out right the more of yourself that you're filled with the more of yourself is going to come out but the more you're filled with God the more of him will come out amen oh my my it is time I just want to say this I'm just going to kind of skip some stuff and come down to this I want you to set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of God build it don't don't rely on the preacher I'm gonna say don't even rely I'm just listening to brother brandom tapes brother brandom said rapturing faith lies in the tapes that means when you're listening to the tapes you need to believe you need to and you believe by moving in action and start obeying and putting those things into your life that is what brings about rapturing faith be faithful with what God gives you walk in the light as he has given it to you you are a special people the Bible says you are a chosen generation you're a royal priesthood you're a holy nation you're peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him that called you out of dark dark nness into His Marvelous Light God has brought us into the message I remember at one time I was just like everybody else in the world which was a nobody that thought he was a somebody and then God had mercy on me he he showed me that I was a nobody and I just said yes Lord I am a nobody help me I need you and so he brought into the message and now we're walking we have all this light and I believe God wants us to arise arise and start putting this word into our lives in a greater way than we have and I'm not taking away any spirituality from any person God knows that was that's never in my heart it is in my heart to provoke us to Good Works that is in my heart and I'm okay with that um you're the bride there there's more things expected out of the Bride than there is the foolish virgin and and and God has has blessed us now Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you can you can be there too so where is that place he's preparing it's inside of us it ain't up in heaven somewhere is inside of us that he's preparing we got to take the time to wait on him do the things that he wants us to do because that's how he's preparing he ain't going to have no puppets he ain't going to control us he ain't going to manipulate us he ain't going to do it all himself it's a joint thing so we wait on him and we hear from the Lord what he wants us to do and then we get down and we walk out of that prayer room with an inner strength I'll tell you our head may be bowing down like like the wheat right but I'll tell you there's something inside of us a strength that that will go out and live a humble Christian Life let's Stand Together God bless you God grant this for each of us amen be determined be determined to press through in prayer it may not happen the first two or three times that you pray but you be determined to get to that place that we're promised in Isaiah chapter 40 that we will get strength from the Lord by simply one thing getting into the presence of God waiting for him it will happen and I'll tell you that that'll just make such a difference in our life our decisions and how we live and our priorities and you know coming a church and and all those things Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary it's a little bit warm in here isn't it Lord prepare me to be a [Applause] sanctuary pure and ho tried and true with Thanksgiving I'll be a living [Laughter] Sanctuary for for you Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary pure and holy tried and true with Thanksgiving I'll be a living Sanctuary for you that your desire Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary pure and holy tried and true with Thanksgiving living how be a living [Music] sanary for you amen what an honor what an honor to be a living Sanctuary this is kind of like man-made right blocks wood but to be a living Sanctuary what a great privilege let just bow our hearts and go before the Lord before we pray I just I want you to lift before the Lord your your request and your desire that you have of the Lord I believe God is amongst us and God will hear our prayer our our request I I believe that everyone has a request today have has it has to do with pleasing the Lord and being found spending more time with him and just asking for strength maybe perhaps just to to wait there long enough and to to to worship Him proper whatever it is that you feel in your heart just keep that before the Lord as we go to him in prayer our heavenly father Lord before Thy word had come forth we bowed before you to ask Lord your blessings on the the the this part of the service where your word was ministered father I believe that Lord You've spoken to all of our hearts I know you've spoken to My Heart Lord and Lord I believe that you've spoken to your bride here and perhaps those that are are are live streaming or watching The Archives that believe that you're a real God with the spiritual food and due season God as we see the world falling apart we just want to get so connected to you be so close to you Lord to hear that still Small Voice and just hear what you'd have us to do in our lives that our character might be at a place that Lord you'd be pleased to dwell eternity with father I pray for every heart here with the things that are on their heart the desires that they have Lord I pray that you would answer their request that you would give them of that Grace for Lord you said your word that you give more grace to the humble Lord we have humbled ourselves to your word today we we submit to it Lord we we yield our vessel because Lord we want you to have the preeminence in your church and we are the church I pray that you would Grant the desire of every heart today may they walk from here Lord with a confidence that as they spend time with you in prayer Lord that you're going to show up Lord that you're going to meet that you're going to fill us with the strength that Lord that we could even have uh a testimonies to others in the family Lord that Lord that you're given us strength day by day and we need your strength Lord we we don't want to try to handle this life without you bless your people strengthen them now Lord we commit them into your hands
