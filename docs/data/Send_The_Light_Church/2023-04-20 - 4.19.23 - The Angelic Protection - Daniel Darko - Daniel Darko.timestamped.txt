[0:00] foreign
[0:01] time Jesus was telling the people they
[0:03] should be very careful
[0:05] what they do to those children of his
[0:09] that their angels are always beholding
[0:13] his father's face
[0:15] Hallelujah it tells you that God is
[0:19] always
[0:21] careful about his elect
[0:25] amen
[0:26] and Day by Day and Night by night
[0:29] he does not leave them
[0:31] he can come around them at all times
[0:34] Hallelujah now
[0:37] the the scripture that we read
[0:39] from the 34 chapter
[0:44] David in the spirit
[0:46] was
[0:48] saying or telling
[0:50] every believer whosoever We Believe
[0:53] about the concern of God about his
[0:56] people
[0:57] Hallelujah he says the angel of the Lord
[1:00] and come round about them that fear Him
[1:04] and delivered him
[1:07] the angel of the Lord
[1:09] they encounter around those that fear
[1:14] Him God
[1:16] and he certainly delivered them also
[1:22] in fact if you have respect for God
[1:25] if you fear God if you honor God if you
[1:30] trust and believe in God certainly God
[1:33] also protects you from any oppression
[1:38] from any enemy
[1:40] from whatever that you can call it God
[1:43] will certainly not leave you he said I
[1:46] will be with you till the end of the
[1:49] world
[1:50] amen he said oh taste and see that the
[1:54] Lord is good
[1:55] in fact tonight we are going to taste
[1:57] the goodness of God
[2:00] like you if you want to know the quality
[2:02] of food it's your tongue that determines
[2:06] diet
[2:07] Hallelujah if you want to know what is
[2:10] in the food you have to put it in your
[2:12] mouth before you can do your judgment
[2:15] and David is telling us tonight also let
[2:18] us taste the goodness of God let us
[2:21] taste the love of God let us take the
[2:24] protections of God so that we can also
[2:27] put our judgment whether God indeed
[2:29] protects or not Hallelujah indeed we are
[2:33] going to do that tonight he said oh fear
[2:35] the lord hear his Saints for there is no
[2:38] want to them that fear Him
[2:41] the Young Lions do lack and suffer
[2:43] hunger but they that seek the Lord shall
[2:46] not want any good thing
[2:48] Hallelujah because everything that he
[2:51] has given to us is more than good
[2:54] hallelujah what is good than the name of
[2:56] God when the Bible says that Adam
[2:59] mention of that name every knee bow
[3:01] and if you have that name then you know
[3:03] that everything must bow before you
[3:07] and that is why the same David said also
[3:10] in chapter 27 he says the Lord is my
[3:15] light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear
[3:18] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[3:21] whom shall I be afraid
[3:23] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[3:26] foes come upon me to eat out my flesh
[3:29] they stumble and fail
[3:32] though an host should encounter against
[3:35] me my heart shall not fear though War
[3:39] should rise against me and this will I
[3:43] be confident one thing have I desired of
[3:45] the Lord that I will seek after that I
[3:48] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[3:51] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[3:54] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[3:57] amen hallelujah David was so confident
[4:02] that apart from God's protections
[4:05] nothing else
[4:07] and you know in this world that we live
[4:11] man is conscious of fear
[4:14] yeah man is conscious of fear sometimes
[4:18] even in our physical life we are afraid
[4:23] of certain things
[4:25] in our spiritual life sometimes we are
[4:28] afraid of certain things
[4:29] sometimes people have dreams
[4:32] and when they come out from their dream
[4:34] they think the world has come to an end
[4:37] because of things that you have seen in
[4:38] a dream sometimes you see I mean a whole
[4:42] lot of
[4:43] fearful sight in your dream it puts fear
[4:46] in you
[4:48] but you know remember
[4:49] that the prophet said that
[4:51] not all dreams are from God
[4:55] indeed speak to us sometimes in dreams
[4:59] but anything God does Satan impersonates
[5:02] it
[5:03] sometimes Satan will bring certain
[5:05] dreams to us
[5:07] to to even sometimes make us doubt
[5:09] whether we are standing well
[5:12] many times
[5:14] bridgen will tell pastor I have such a
[5:17] dream and I I say brother I am not a
[5:19] dream interpreter
[5:21] if you have the dream and you are
[5:24] confused about it just pray and commit
[5:26] into God's hand and God will take care
[5:29] of the rest
[5:30] Hallelujah you know so there are so many
[5:33] ways whereby we we are always you know
[5:36] so much as we are in this flesh
[5:38] the flesh will always work for that
[5:40] spirit
[5:42] we aim to go forward we aim to persevere
[5:46] we aim to thrive on the word of God
[5:50] but at the same time there are so many
[5:52] things that sometimes try to pull us
[5:54] back
[5:55] okay and and like somebody want to
[6:00] enter into certain things like business
[6:02] and all that and you you find your your
[6:05] mind telling you are you going to
[6:07] succeed
[6:08] are you going to what the Venture that
[6:11] you want to put yourself in is he going
[6:12] to help you or you are going to lose and
[6:15] you know you can put certain fear in you
[6:18] and if you allow the fear
[6:21] to take over then it means you are going
[6:24] to stay put
[6:25] you are not going to venture at all
[6:28] because you are afraid of losing
[6:31] Hallelujah and because of that many
[6:34] times people have false protections
[6:38] for themselves
[6:40] okay it's common in Africa
[6:42] because of fear
[6:44] somebody's afraid that uh his neighbor
[6:47] is going to you know cause some
[6:50] spiritual attack on him or her
[6:53] and for that matter they go for you know
[6:56] fake protections right they go to idle
[6:59] homes to kind of get certain things into
[7:01] their body that it will protect them but
[7:05] brother no matter what protection you
[7:07] think you can get for yourself there
[7:10] will never be any protections that can
[7:12] supersede the protections of God
[7:14] [Music]
[7:15] because any protections a man will give
[7:18] to you on this Earth
[7:21] it has limits
[7:23] Hallelujah it has limited this thing
[7:27] that I'm talking to you now
[7:29] when you come to Africa there is such
[7:32] that sometimes people have secured so
[7:35] many magical powers
[7:37] all is because of fear
[7:41] yeah
[7:43] somebody can be with you here and
[7:45] something will happen and they'll have
[7:47] to vanish
[7:49] because of fear
[7:51] Hallelujah some go to Idol homes and
[7:55] secure themselves that even when you put
[7:57] a gun on them and you shoot it will not
[7:59] penetrate
[8:01] or it's because of fear
[8:03] Hallelujah but brother what will God end
[8:07] you it has expiry date
[8:11] but the only protections that don't have
[8:14] asparity is the protection of God
[8:17] when God have his protections upon you
[8:19] that is what David is saying he said
[8:22] even when my enemy rise to eat up my
[8:24] flesh because of the protections of God
[8:26] they'll fall
[8:29] amen so the profession that we are
[8:32] talking about beloved is not protection
[8:34] of this Earth it's not protections of
[8:37] man but is the protection of the
[8:39] almighty that you have dispatches Holy
[8:41] Angels to guide us in all our ways
[8:45] now if you check the Old Testament
[8:49] you realize as we are all aware that
[8:53] every year
[8:54] the priest has to go to the holies of
[8:57] holies with the blood of animals why he
[9:01] has to go and seek the face of God
[9:04] and when God accepts that sacrifice then
[9:08] he comes out with the blessing of God
[9:11] upon the congregation
[9:14] when he comes out he bring the favor of
[9:16] God upon the people
[9:18] when he comes out he bring the blessings
[9:21] of God upon the people when he comes out
[9:23] he bring protection
[9:25] Hallelujah even under the blast of
[9:28] animals under the blood of bulls
[9:31] but the Bible tells us in Hebrews that
[9:33] those things were not perfect
[9:36] as compared to what you and I we are
[9:39] enjoying now
[9:41] Hallelujah we are under the protections
[9:43] of the blood of Jesus Christ
[9:45] and so if those people even rejoice and
[9:48] have the power and protections how can
[9:51] we
[9:52] what can we say now that today is not
[9:56] the blood of animals it's not a blood of
[9:59] bulls it's not a blood of cows but the
[10:01] blood of God himself
[10:03] [Music]
[10:04] amen that is why we have entered into a
[10:08] perfect holist of holies
[10:12] Hallelujah that is what our protection
[10:14] says
[10:15] when the minister or when the priests
[10:17] enter in there he go and meet the
[10:20] Shekinah Glory even under the blood of
[10:23] animals but here look at our Assurance
[10:26] we did not enter there with the blood of
[10:29] animals but we have entered by the Lord
[10:32] Jesus Christ
[10:35] in those days
[10:37] the high priest goes
[10:40] there and bring the favor of God upon
[10:42] the people
[10:42] but in this our time we have entered
[10:45] there ourselves by the power of Jesus
[10:49] Christ
[10:50] that's why president got there alone but
[10:52] he went there with all of us
[10:55] and that is where our protections are
[10:58] amen
[10:59] amen now one time
[11:02] when Abraham sent elieza
[11:05] to go to his people and look for a wife
[11:09] for his son Isaac
[11:11] you know
[11:13] it was such that Elisa didn't know the
[11:16] place
[11:17] but then he was directed
[11:19] go this way go that way go that way
[11:23] but there was an assurance by Abraham he
[11:26] said the Lord will send his angel
[11:28] to be your guide
[11:30] oh what a blessed hope
[11:32] so Elisa realized that oh if my master
[11:35] have given such an assurance then my
[11:39] ways will be prosperous
[11:40] [Music]
[11:42] and but that's saying
[11:44] he lives of God to the place
[11:47] and then he prayed a prayer
[11:50] they say oh God
[11:52] Let It Be
[11:54] that the dumb self that will come by
[11:57] and I will ask her of water
[11:59] and she will tell me that drink and I
[12:02] also give to your cameras let that be
[12:05] the wife of my master Isaac
[12:08] it was not Angelic protection
[12:10] Hallelujah because he didn't know where
[12:13] he was going but he knew certainly that
[12:16] there was a god of his master Abraham
[12:18] who always favored his people when they
[12:21] cry unto him
[12:23] oh brother Elisa tasted the favor of God
[12:27] and God manifested that indeed I am
[12:30] let's let's see Genesis chapter 20 24
[12:34] quickly
[12:38] foreign
[12:52] seven
[12:54] this was after Elisa
[12:58] have communed with the family of Rebecca
[13:02] he said and my master made me swear
[13:05] saying Thou shalt not take a wife to my
[13:08] son of the daughters of the Canaanites
[13:10] in whose land I dwell
[13:13] but thou shall go onto my father's house
[13:16] and to my Kindred and take a wife unto
[13:20] my son
[13:21] and I said unto my master para Adventure
[13:25] the woman will not follow me
[13:28] and he said unto me
[13:30] the Lord before whom I walk will send
[13:33] his angel with thee and prosper thy way
[13:37] and thou shall take a wife for my son of
[13:40] mine Kindred and of my father's house
[13:44] Hallelujah
[13:46] good amen there was an assurance
[13:51] that fear not eliada
[13:53] for my God that I serve
[13:56] my God that brought me out from idolatry
[13:59] my God that brought me out from unbelief
[14:03] my God that brought me from the world he
[14:07] will send an angel to guide you
[14:10] Hallelujah and when elieza didn't doubt
[14:15] this saying it really manifested
[14:18] you see the only thing that takes the
[14:20] blessings away is doubt
[14:23] if you doubt the word of God certainly
[14:26] you are going to fail
[14:28] but when you take it by faith and hold
[14:31] on to the promise where God will
[14:33] certainly manifest himself
[14:35] Hallelujah so therefore Elisa pick up
[14:40] and he prayed that prayer and indeed the
[14:43] angel of the Lord sent the answer to him
[14:45] immediately it was not quite long when
[14:48] he saw the young ladies coming up and
[14:50] down and this particular one came around
[14:54] which was Rebecca he said lady will you
[14:58] please give me water to drink he said
[14:59] yes drink and I'll give also to your
[15:02] your animal or your camera whatsoever
[15:05] and you know the volume of drink one
[15:07] camel can drink
[15:09] they were 10.
[15:10] but this lady
[15:12] with humility
[15:14] Hallelujah you have to have to you know
[15:17] water all these animals
[15:20] Hallelujah and and she was so much happy
[15:23] even in doing that service
[15:26] it was God's guidance
[15:28] because God have already linked them
[15:30] together the prophet said when they give
[15:32] collect unto the Deep there must be a
[15:34] deep to respond
[15:35] God has already prepared the way brother
[15:38] sometimes we we we don't even have to
[15:41] question whatever happened to our way
[15:44] God have already prepared our way
[15:48] God have already prepared our way but
[15:51] sometimes because of situation we ask
[15:53] ourselves question oh God why is this so
[15:58] we don't have to ask God any question
[16:02] the only thing we have to keep doing is
[16:04] to believe
[16:06] and that is it when we keep believing
[16:08] God will always manifest himself to us
[16:12] Hallelujah Once Upon a Time
[16:15] when Moses was running away
[16:18] from responsibility
[16:21] and uh he found himself in Media we all
[16:25] know the story while when he got a woman
[16:28] there to marry
[16:30] and he was taking care of his
[16:32] father-in-law jetro's in our flock
[16:35] Day by Day and Night by night and one
[16:38] day he climbed the mountain to go
[16:41] on the same inner Iran
[16:44] but that particular day something
[16:46] happened to him
[16:47] and it has been the same always it's
[16:50] always one day hallelujah it's always
[16:53] one day da you you are we brother Ron
[16:57] was asking me a question today he said
[16:59] how did I come to the message I said
[17:02] brother I cannot even explain
[17:05] I only remember that one day we're in a
[17:08] church a Pentecostal church and all of a
[17:11] sudden my pastor by then came around he
[17:13] said I have got a new thing
[17:15] and we were kind of what Newton is that
[17:19] right he said it's a message of the hour
[17:22] Hallelujah he said well whether you like
[17:25] it or not this is it if you can't
[17:28] believe believe it if you cannot believe
[17:30] also I cannot force you and in fact when
[17:34] you brought it it broke the church into
[17:36] two
[17:37] many people did not believe it but the
[17:40] few of other remain we have believed the
[17:42] message till today and we have a
[17:44] testimony that indeed God reigneth among
[17:48] his people
[17:50] Hallelujah so it's always one day
[17:53] Moses have been going to this place
[17:55] always coming up and down but that
[17:58] particular day something extraordinary
[18:00] happened
[18:02] the Bible said that he saw a bush
[18:04] burning
[18:06] Hallelujah but the the leaves were not
[18:09] being consumed so that was what
[18:11] attracted him he said what kind of a
[18:13] site is this let me turn and look at it
[18:15] well
[18:17] so I mean the Lord saw that he he tend
[18:20] to look then he mentioned his name Moses
[18:21] Moses
[18:24] don't come nearer
[18:26] remove that Sanders for where thou are
[18:28] standing is a Holy Ground and now this
[18:31] is the purpose
[18:32] I've heard a cry of my people
[18:35] I've come down
[18:36] to deliver them but I'm sending you
[18:40] I know you run away from Egypt
[18:43] but I am sending you back to that place
[18:48] every human being
[18:50] will think twice about this
[18:54] why should I go to a place that I am
[18:57] being wanted
[18:59] oh God
[19:00] you want me to go and give myself up
[19:04] that I will be crucified
[19:07] perhaps that was the thought that came
[19:09] to Moses mind
[19:11] Lord I I wish that you sent somebody
[19:13] else
[19:14] not me not me now
[19:17] amen but will God change his mind God
[19:22] doesn't change his mind about his word
[19:23] if God say it is you it is you
[19:26] whether you can't speak or not if you
[19:29] say it is you it is you whether you can
[19:31] see or not if it say it is you it must
[19:34] be you and nobody else
[19:38] Moses trying to give excuse oh Lord I
[19:41] cannot I cannot speak well I'm a stamina
[19:44] you know my my my accent is not even
[19:47] good you can't use me at this time
[19:51] God said you will I use
[19:54] Hallelujah my angel will be with you
[19:57] he will guide you and he'll tell you
[19:59] what to do
[20:01] I am only giving you two signs and go
[20:04] with it
[20:05] and the people will accept you
[20:08] and God indeed gave him the two signs
[20:10] and we all know the Miracles that Moses
[20:13] rotted in the land of Egypt in fact the
[20:16] prophet said all those angels it was not
[20:19] Moses who wrote them but the angel that
[20:22] God dispatched
[20:24] was the one that was doing the Miracles
[20:26] Moses was just a tool in God's hand like
[20:29] you and I we are just a tool in God's
[20:31] hand to make the name of Christ
[20:33] manifested on this Earth brother what
[20:36] are the word like it or not we in front
[20:38] and we are living the testimony
[20:41] oh yes we are living a testimony soon
[20:44] the people are going to look for us they
[20:46] will not see us
[20:47] oh my I knew this brother my Cosby he
[20:52] invited me to church some time ago I
[20:54] refused
[20:55] where is he I've not seen him for some
[20:57] time yes you will not see him
[20:59] he is no more in Fenton he's in the
[21:02] rapture and that is what is going to be
[21:04] in the life of every one of us
[21:06] oh brother we are waiting for that day
[21:09] we are certainly waiting for that day
[21:11] when I will no longer come from Africa
[21:13] to you know America to see you but we
[21:16] will be around the Throne of God with
[21:19] different testimonies Hallelujah and the
[21:22] Bible said that our voices will blend
[21:23] together and we'll sing the same song
[21:26] because right from the from the
[21:30] beginning the Lord dispatched our angels
[21:34] to protect us to guide us by the way
[21:37] have they not been them brother we
[21:40] wouldn't know where we'll be by now
[21:42] and Moses for that matter I realized
[21:44] that there is no way that you could give
[21:47] excuse for that you know work to be done
[21:50] so he has to give it up and the Lord in
[21:54] this sent you know
[21:56] his Angel to guide him
[21:58] now we all know what happened in the
[22:00] land of Egypt when Moses got there
[22:03] there were so many things that went on
[22:06] when Pharaoh was trying to challenge you
[22:09] know the ability of Moses coming down to
[22:12] tell him that let my people go and even
[22:15] ask him which God have sent you right
[22:18] can you imagine
[22:20] which God have sent you Moses said you
[22:22] want to know the god that I've sent me
[22:25] Aaron cast my rod on the ground
[22:29] and Aaron cuts the road on the ground
[22:31] and it tends to be serpent
[22:33] but look at that they were all laughing
[22:35] because to them it's it's a trick it's a
[22:38] magical trick
[22:40] Hallelujah because Janice and Germans
[22:42] were doing that thing often so it was
[22:45] not a new thing for them Hallelujah so
[22:48] they started laughing but one thing they
[22:51] didn't know was that there was an angel
[22:54] standing by Moses
[22:56] and the angel was the one that was
[22:58] performing The Miracles
[22:59] so down they called Genesis and genres
[23:01] to come up okay to come and also tell
[23:05] show Moses that they can do better
[23:08] and they cast their Rush also down and
[23:10] their Road also turned into serpent
[23:14] Hallelujah are you catching it
[23:17] look at the difference now
[23:23] those of genus and Gem race per arms
[23:27] were bigger than that of Moses
[23:30] and that's what the devil can do always
[23:33] trying to supersede that of God
[23:38] by impersonation
[23:41] you know but we believe
[23:43] that is not the size of the dog
[23:48] Hallelujah
[23:49] is not the size of the dog
[23:53] is that not it
[23:55] but the size of the fight in the dog
[23:58] that is the matter
[24:00] so when they also curse their Road and
[24:03] they tend to serpent

[24:14] that of generous

[24:24] Hallelujah
[24:25] they are Rod is still in the road of
[24:27] Moses

[24:31] standed by Moses my brother says that I
[24:34] want to assure you that the angel of the
[24:37] Lord is always around you wherever you
[24:40] are that is why you must take fear out
[24:43] from you
[24:44] don't consider anything as fear
[24:47] because fear will dampen your progress
[24:51] Hallelujah remember
[24:54] that same angel
[24:56] that was standing by Moses at the palace
[24:59] what the same angel that guided him when
[25:02] he was put on the Nile River
[25:04] in that act as a child
[25:07] the prophet said
[25:09] the crocodiles they are the most biggest
[25:11] of all
[25:13] and none of these crocodiles
[25:18] tried
[25:20] okay to swallow up Moses they couldn't
[25:24] have done that easy
[25:25] they could have done that by the
[25:28] protections of the Angel of the Lord no
[25:30] way they couldn't
[25:33] and Moses you know swarmed all over the
[25:36] Nile to Pharaoh's daughter picked him up
[25:40] it was the protection of the angel
[25:44] Hallelujah oh brother
[25:47] God told his people
[25:50] I am sending my angel before thee to
[25:53] guide thee and to protect thee when they
[25:57] came out from Egypt Hallelujah because
[25:59] he want to have a sweet communion with
[26:02] them
[26:03] but there was some instruction given by
[26:06] God
[26:07] to the people hallelujah let's read
[26:10] Exodus chapter 23.
[26:17] Exodus chapter 23.
[26:31] and now let's start from verse 20.
[26:34] he said behold I sent an angel before

[26:39] to keep thee in the way and to bring
[26:42] thee into the place which I have

[26:48] and obey his voice
[26:51] provoke him not
[26:53] for he will not pardon your
[26:55] transgression for my name is in him
[26:59] Hallelujah
[27:01] you catch it he said behold I send an
[27:04] angel this is God speaking to his people
[27:06] to keep thee in the way and to bring
[27:10] thee into the place which I God have
[27:13] prepared is already prepared place and
[27:17] God need his people to go and take it
[27:19] but they cannot go by themselves they
[27:22] need a guardian angel a protected Angel
[27:25] to send their in Hallelujah he said
[27:29] Beware of him and obey his voice provoke
[27:32] him not for he will not pardon me of
[27:35] transgression for my name is in him
[27:38] hear his voice you must hear the voice
[27:41] of your angel
[27:43] Hallelujah when your angels speak to you
[27:45] you must take it and abide by it
[27:49] are you catching it you cannot just say
[27:52] that oh I have an angel of the Lord and
[27:54] you walk in your own way no
[27:57] that will not bring any blessing to you
[27:59] you must listen to the voice of the
[28:01] angel
[28:03] Hallelujah he said provoke him not how
[28:06] do you provoke the angel

[28:15] everything that you want so you no
[28:17] longer care about the way of the Angel
[28:19] no
[28:20] that shouldn't be he said provoke him
[28:23] not
[28:24] hallelujah it's just by Grace beloved
[28:27] that we are all saved
[28:29] but now after our Salvation do we do
[28:32] what we want
[28:34] no
[28:35] we do according to the instructions of
[28:37] God's word
[28:39] that is what makes us children of God
[28:43] Hallelujah
[28:45] because if we're a child of God you have
[28:47] a new parent
[28:48] and your new parent is the word
[28:51] is that not it is it train up a child
[28:54] the way he should go so when you grow up
[28:56] he will not depart from it so you must
[28:59] be obedient to your parent and we must
[29:02] be obedient to God's word
[29:06] Peter say
[29:07] being born again
[29:09] Hallelujah Being Born Again by what by
[29:14] the word of God
[29:15] you must be born again by the word of
[29:18] God and that is where you must stay put
[29:20] to the instructions of the angel of God
[29:23] and when we are talking about the angel
[29:25] of God is the word
[29:27] Hallelujah is a word he said provoke him
[29:31] not for he will not pardon your
[29:33] transgression for my name is in him
[29:36] but if thou shall indeed obey his voice
[29:40] and do all that I speak then I will be
[29:43] an enemy unto thy enemies and an
[29:47] adversary unto thy adversaries
[29:50] for my angel shall go before thee and
[29:54] bring thee in onto the amorites and the
[29:58] hittite and the parasites and the
[30:01] Canaanite the Evite and the jebusites
[30:04] and I will cut them off
[30:07] Hallelujah thou shall not bow down to
[30:11] their gods
[30:12] nor serve them nor do after their works
[30:16] but thou shall utterly overthrow them
[30:19] and quite break down their images
[30:25] Hallelujah this is where the physical
[30:28] Canaanites the jeopardized the Evite and
[30:31] all those
[30:32] but today what will we talk about
[30:34] ourselves
[30:36] there are still jebusites there are so
[30:39] he fights there are still Canaanites
[30:42] that we need to destroy
[30:45] in our lives
[30:47] anything beloved that seems to be a
[30:51] hindrance in our Christian Life is kind
[30:55] of this people
[30:57] we need to destroy we need to clear it
[31:00] from our way Hallelujah in fact God said
[31:03] my angel shall go before thee and today
[31:07] we have the same angel of God going
[31:10] before us hallelujah and that is our
[31:12] faith in the Lord
[31:15] he said thou shall not bow down to their
[31:17] gods not serve them nor do after their
[31:21] works but thou shall utterly overthrow
[31:24] them and quite break down their images
[31:29] and yes Shall Serve the Lord your God
[31:31] and he shall bless thy bread oh yes I
[31:34] want I want my bread to be blessed
[31:38] and certainly you want yours also to be
[31:40] blessed and how will God bless it
[31:44] he will only bless it when we obey the
[31:47] angel Hallelujah God bless you I'm not
[31:51] seeing you
[31:52] later yes I'm talking about you God
[31:54] bless you brother Hallelujah
[31:56] you understand
[31:58] if we want our leg to be blessed blessed
[32:01] then of course we need to listen to the
[32:03] angel of the Lord
[32:05] amen are you catching it
[32:08] he says and Yea Shall Serve the Lord
[32:13] your God
[32:14] and he shall bless thy bread and thy
[32:17] water and I will take sickness away from
[32:21] the midst of Thee
[32:24] that's a wonderful God
[32:27] taken away
[32:28] when we obey the voice of the Angel and
[32:33] we have seen God taking sickness away
[32:35] from among his people because we obey
[32:38] his voice
[32:39] Hallelujah the impossibility of man is
[32:44] always possible when will stay put to
[32:47] God's word nothing can stand our way
[32:49] because he is a God that performs he is
[32:53] a God that state by his word he is a God
[32:55] who don't run away from responsibility
[32:58] he's a God that can make his people
[33:00] happy if only though obey his voice and
[33:05] listen to his instructions without
[33:07] provoking that guiding and protecting
[33:11] Angel Hallelujah
[33:13] he said there shall nothing cast their
[33:16] young
[33:18] nor be barren
[33:22] in thy land the number of thy days I
[33:26] will fulfill
[33:27] I will send my fear before thee and I
[33:31] will destroy all the people to whom thou
[33:34] shall come and I will make all thy
[33:36] enemies turn their backs unto thee what
[33:39] a wonderful assurance
[33:41] and I was sent on it before thee which
[33:44] shall drive out the Evite and the
[33:46] Canaanites and the hittite from before
[33:48] thee
[33:50] all these are blessing and Blessed
[33:52] assurance that God gave to his people
[33:55] because the angel of the Lord
[33:58] was discharged to be with his people to
[34:03] guide them and take them to the promised
[34:05] land
[34:06] God prepared the place for them but it
[34:09] was inhabited by this you know canonized
[34:13] but God need his people to take the land
[34:16] because it belongs to them
[34:18] why will God allow it to go waste no he
[34:21] will certainly not do that
[34:23] and that is the reason why we always say
[34:25] that anything that God has prepared for
[34:27] you nobody else nothing can take it from
[34:30] you
[34:31] Hallelujah any way that God has to guide
[34:34] you to take that God will do it
[34:36] but your only thing to do is to obey the
[34:40] voice of God
[34:41] [Music]
[34:42] amen that is the only thing that God is
[34:46] looking unto that you do for him without
[34:49] that oh my brother God will be very much
[34:53] annoying as he said we should not
[34:55] provoke that guiding angel
[34:58] no he said that God has understanding
[35:02] how to go and what to do
[35:05] God has always sent a guide to his
[35:08] people
[35:09] God has never failed
[35:11] and he will not fail
[35:14] he sends a guide but you've got to
[35:17] accept that guide
[35:19] see you've got to believe it you've got
[35:23] to go the way he says
[35:27] are you catching it beloved you've got
[35:29] to go the way that God says you got to
[35:33] go the way the angel says you got to go
[35:36] the way the word of God says you don't
[35:38] go according to your own understanding
[35:42] Hallelujah
[35:44] if you get into a Wilderness and your
[35:47] God says we go this way and yet you
[35:51] think you go that way you are going to
[35:53] come up lost
[35:54] then when God sends us a guy to guide us
[35:58] we've got to follow that guide no matter
[36:01] what we think what looks reasonable and
[36:05] what looks ridiculous we are not subject
[36:08] to divide that the God is the only one
[36:13] Hallelujah the God is the only one
[36:17] now when we come to the New Testament we
[36:19] realize when Jesus Christ was revealing
[36:23] himself in the Book of Revelation
[36:26] he did not just get up and do something
[36:29] but he Place himself upon the word
[36:31] because he is a word he can never
[36:34] operate without the word
[36:36] Hallelujah I love that thing that you
[36:39] told them for us he said whether you
[36:41] believe it or not I am he
[36:45] whether you believe it or not I am he
[36:48] they were having their mind but Christ
[36:51] knew knew whom he was
[36:55] amen because he was the word the word
[36:58] that was to be fulfilled was him so he
[37:01] would never do anything without the word
[37:04] and now we're the Gentiles when he was
[37:07] revealing himself to us he called on
[37:09] John
[37:10] to the island of Patmos
[37:12] whether
[37:14] the people knew what they were doing or
[37:16] not it was to our favor
[37:19] well they tried to kill John
[37:23] in so many ways they couldn't kill him
[37:25] so finally they decided they decided to
[37:28] take him to the island of padmus and
[37:31] that is where they will leave him and he
[37:33] would die by himself
[37:35] but it was God that was calling John on
[37:38] the island
[37:40] Hallelujah the moment they love John
[37:44] then Jordan had his name mentioned John
[37:47] and he tend to look
[37:49] what
[37:51] who is here
[37:52] me
[37:55] and John turned to look
[37:57] and we all know what he saw Hallelujah
[37:59] let's read a portion of it let's read a
[38:02] portion of it
[38:03] Revelation chapter one
[38:08] amen
[38:13] let me start from verse five and from
[38:15] Jesus Christ who is a faithful witness
[38:17] and the first begotten of the dead and
[38:20] the prince of the kings of the earth
[38:21] unto him that loved us and washed us
[38:24] from our sins in his own blood
[38:27] and admit as Kings and Priests unto God
[38:30] and his father to him the glory and
[38:33] Dominion forever and ever amen
[38:35] he said behold he cometh with clouds and
[38:39] every eye shall see him and they also
[38:41] would Pierce him and all kindreds of the
[38:43] Earth shall well because of him even so
[38:46] amen
[38:48] verse 8 I am Alpha and Omega the
[38:51] beginning and the ending say the Lord
[38:53] which is and which was and which is to
[38:56] come the almighty
[38:59] oh my
[39:01] God he said I John who also am your
[39:03] brother and companion in Tribulation
[39:06] and in the Kingdom of the and patience
[39:10] of Jesus Christ was in the island that
[39:13] is called Patmos for the word of God and
[39:17] for the testimony of Jesus Christ
[39:20] I was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[39:23] and head behind me a great voice as of a
[39:26] trumpet
[39:27] saying
[39:29] I am Alpha and Omega
[39:31] the first and the last
[39:33] and what thou see it write in a book and
[39:37] send it onto the seven churches which
[39:40] are in Asia
[39:42] unto Ephesus unto seminar unto pegamos
[39:46] and onto chiatira onto studies onto
[39:50] Philadelphia and then until audition
[39:54] and I tend to see the voice that speak
[39:57] with me that's why I love
[40:01] and being turned I saw seven golden
[40:05] candlesticks
[40:07] can we imagine
[40:10] and in the midst of the seven candles
[40:12] take one like unto the son of man
[40:15] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[40:18] and get about the paths with a golden
[40:21] gather
[40:22] his head and his hairs were right leg
[40:25] rule as white as snow and his eyes were
[40:30] as a flame of fire
[40:32] and his feet like unto fine brass as it
[40:37] they burn in a furnace and his voice at
[40:40] the son of many others oh
[40:43] include your voice and include my voice
[40:47] and he heard in his right hand Seven
[40:50] Stars
[40:51] and out of his mouth went a shop to edge
[40:54] sword and his countenance was out the
[40:57] sun shine it in his strength and when I
[41:00] saw him I fell at his feet I was dead
[41:03] and he laid his right hand upon me
[41:05] saying unto me fear not I am the first
[41:09] and the last I am he that liveth and was
[41:12] dead and behold I am alive forever more
[41:15] amen
[41:17] and have the keys of hell and of death
[41:21] write the things we thou has seen
[41:24] and the things which are and the things
[41:27] which shall be hereafter
[41:29] The Mystery of the Seven Stars without
[41:32] soweth in my right hand and the Seven
[41:35] golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are
[41:38] the Angels of the seven churches
[41:40] and the seven
[41:42] continents seven churches now what I
[41:46] want us to look at is the Seven Stars
[41:49] are the Angels of the seven churches
[41:53] Hallelujah
[41:55] no you and I know and we believe
[41:58] that in a gentle age
[42:01] God gave us seven dispensation
[42:04] and every disposition had an angel
[42:09] and these Angels were angels in the hand
[42:12] of God
[42:13] and what the prophet said that they were
[42:15] not heavily Angels but they were Earthly
[42:17] angels
[42:19] Hallelujah they were the guiding Angels
[42:23] dispatched to the seven churches
[42:26] and at every Church age God has to live
[42:29] or release an angel to guide his people
[42:33] whether we like it or not we need the
[42:36] protections of the Angels
[42:38] Hallelujah any churches he released an
[42:42] angel
[42:43] and listen carefully in the Old
[42:45] Testament he said be careful don't
[42:48] provoke that angel
[42:51] don't do what provoke that angel
[42:54] because if you provoke that angel he
[42:57] will not pardon you
[42:59] amen
[43:01] so in this our time also
[43:03] when God released an angel like Paul
[43:07] to take charge of the efficient churches
[43:10] in fact Paul said a lot of things
[43:14] and for that matter that same morning
[43:16] went to the people in The False age
[43:19] he said that don't provoke him how do
[43:22] you provoke him you provoke him by these
[43:24] believing what he tells you
[43:27] and it came to a point Paul was one more
[43:30] charged he said what I have preached
[43:32] when an angel come from Heaven any other
[43:35] Angel is I am an angel of the efficient
[43:39] Church
[43:40] God give me authority to set the church
[43:43] in order I have led the foundation
[43:46] anyone that is coming to build upon it
[43:48] must be careful the kind of material
[43:50] he's going to use
[43:51] you don't use any different material You
[43:54] Don't Preach what I have preached
[43:56] contrary but what I'll preach make sure
[43:59] you're preaching the same thing
[44:00] Hallelujah he said even an angel come
[44:03] from heaven and say well Paul said this
[44:05] but I am changing it he said let that
[44:08] angel be a cursed
[44:11] even I Paul I myself if I go and come
[44:15] back and say hey I've got a new a new
[44:18] Revolution so therefore I'm going to
[44:19] change what I preach he said let me be a
[44:22] cast
[44:22] and today beloved can we imagine how
[44:25] many people are kissing themselves
[44:28] a lot of people are cursing themselves
[44:29] because whatever Paul established they
[44:33] have turned it upside down completely
[44:36] amen can you imagine
[44:39] Paul
[44:41] telling us about the way The Church Must
[44:44] Be conducted
[44:45] but today not on idea
[44:49] not on thinking I've turned the word
[44:52] upside down do you know that you are
[44:54] cursing yourself
[44:55] the angel of the Lord
[44:58] the Bible in Old Testament warn everyone
[45:00] be careful don't provoke him
[45:04] and this Angels also in God's hand if
[45:07] you provoke them you will not be
[45:09] pardoned
[45:11] Hallelujah
[45:12] and Paul
[45:15] was that angel of the efficient Church
[45:18] age
[45:19] after him God dispatched another angel
[45:22] as arenas
[45:24] to be an angel to that age which was the
[45:29] second Church age
[45:30] and it went on and went on and went on
[45:33] we we see when you use somebody like
[45:36] Martin we saw when he used somebody like
[45:39] colomba he used Martin Luther can we
[45:42] imagine Martin Luther's time that
[45:44] because of the Revelation that God gave
[45:46] to him somebody told me John Martin he
[45:49] said order what is against you
[45:52] right
[45:53] we are not going to listen to you
[45:55] you are destroying the church but Martin
[45:58] Luther knew where he was standing
[46:00] he said well if the whole world is
[46:02] against me I am also against the whole
[46:05] world
[46:06] it's better to listen to the angel
[46:08] and have your salvation secured
[46:11] then you using your own mind to
[46:14] formulate something that you think can
[46:15] be right for you it will not take you
[46:17] anywhere
[46:18] praise the name of our God
[46:20] Martin Luther went away
[46:23] and then came John Wesley
[46:25] another angel
[46:27] of the sixth Church age
[46:29] and John Wesley also did his best to
[46:32] make sure that you lead the people of
[46:34] God to the promised land
[46:37] and anyone that believed or listened to
[46:39] John John Wesley had their way into the
[46:43] promised land yes amen then came to our
[46:47] faithful time
[46:48] oh I say faithful because this is where
[46:50] God put us
[46:52] and beloved if you agree with me there
[46:54] has never been any age than this age
[46:56] Hallelujah they had never been God knew
[47:00] that this is the time you can hear his
[47:03] word and believe that is why he put you
[47:05] in this age
[47:06] Hallelujah so there had never been any
[47:09] age like this age
[47:11] and he gave us a faithful a faithful
[47:14] Angel by name of William Marion Braham
[47:17] who was an angel of this age brother
[47:19] whether you believe it or not I don't
[47:23] care where your education level is I
[47:26] don't care how intellectual you are I
[47:28] don't care how Professor you are I don't
[47:31] care how you know the English
[47:34] Hallelujah if you don't listen to that
[47:38] angel
[47:39] the Bible says that
[47:41] you'll not be pardoned
[47:44] can somebody say Amen
[47:47] if you don't listen to that angel
[47:50] Hallelujah you will not be pardoned
[47:52] because he is the one that God have
[47:54] given the charge
[47:57] to take care of this age
[47:59] God knew exactly what he was doing as he
[48:02] was yesterday he's the same today and
[48:05] you continue to be the same
[48:07] Hallelujah even on the throne we saw
[48:11] that God you know made it this way
[48:15] that the throne there were four living
[48:18] creatures around it and the prophet they
[48:21] were they were strong guys they were
[48:22] guarding the throne for our sake yeah
[48:25] when the devil came turning himself you
[48:28] know into so many things to deceive the
[48:30] people of God because of those guiding
[48:33] Angels because of those protecting
[48:35] Angels brother we were not lost
[48:38] we were not deceived Hallelujah
[48:42] when the devil went and put white
[48:44] garment upon himself and sat on a white
[48:48] horse
[48:49] with a ball without an arrow Hallelujah
[48:52] and the Bible said that he went to
[48:54] conquer and he was Conquering the whole
[48:56] world
[48:57] many people realize that or they thought
[49:00] that it was Jesus Christ
[49:01] but how can Jesus be on a white horse
[49:05] with a bow without an arrow
[49:08] but I don't use bow and arrow
[49:10] he always have a sword two edged sword
[49:13] that is what Christ have in his hand
[49:17] but
[49:19] for the sake of that angel
[49:22] Hallelujah who called John that John
[49:25] come and see
[49:26] come and see the trick of the liar
[49:31] and when John come to see
[49:33] he realized that he was not an uh he was
[49:37] not Jesus Christ
[49:38] but was a lying angel
[49:40] Hallelujah
[49:43] that same demon went back
[49:46] and came back again with another color
[49:49] this time he came in red
[49:52] and you know the red signifies
[49:54] Redemption
[49:56] Hallelujah
[49:57] he was trying to deceive the world again
[50:01] but the angel
[50:04] the second and you call John again John
[50:07] come and see the liar that same liar he
[50:09] has changed the color
[50:11] he went back and came with black
[50:14] and that was the Dark Ages when they are
[50:16] taking all the truth away and nobody was
[50:19] getting access to the truth but then the
[50:22] angel of the Lord was still there to
[50:24] guide his people
[50:26] Hallelujah that is why we are not afraid
[50:28] of physical Darkness what we are afraid
[50:31] is spiritual darkness when you are
[50:34] spiritual Darkness brother you are lost
[50:37] Hallelujah
[50:39] but thank God
[50:41] the devil was still pursuing and now he
[50:45] went back and missed all those colors
[50:49] and became colorless he came with a pale
[50:52] color now
[50:54] trying to deceive
[50:55] the people of God but the devil didn't
[50:59] know
[51:00] that that was the time that God was also
[51:02] using the angel that have a face like a
[51:06] flying eagle
[51:07] you cannot deceive the eager because the
[51:10] eye is very sharp
[51:12] Hallelujah as far as the eagle will be
[51:15] the clearer he sees everywhere
[51:18] amen so why is the devil was changing
[51:22] his colors to deceive the elect
[51:24] they're flying against was also on a
[51:26] flying all over the place Hallelujah and
[51:29] he saw that no no no no no no Satan you
[51:32] cannot deceive the people of God
[51:34] hallelujah you are the same old demon
[51:37] all liar you cannot deceive the people
[51:40] of God because we have a protecting
[51:42] angel
[51:43] amen
[51:46] oh brother sister let me let me let me
[51:48] just touch on this
[51:50] amen you remember that in the Old
[51:52] Testament
[51:53] when God divided the Army into four
[51:57] groups
[51:58] you remember that he gave them and sign
[52:01] okay
[52:03] divided them into four groups
[52:06] uh uh there was there was Judah at the
[52:09] East remember there was Ruben at the
[52:11] South Ephraim was at the west and Dan
[52:14] was at the North and all this group they
[52:18] had soldiers behind them
[52:20] and all of them have a sign Hallelujah
[52:23] the eagle the lion the face of a man and
[52:27] a flying eagle in the Old Testament and
[52:30] it was a symbol to what happened in this
[52:33] new testament we also have a symbol and
[52:37] today brother when you see the eagle all
[52:40] over the place it's a sign that God of
[52:42] dispatched an angel to guide his people
[52:44] amen
[52:47] amen
[52:51] now listen to what the prophet said here
[52:54] he said and then
[52:56] there was another Danger
[52:59] now he was talking about Mary and Joseph
[53:02] this little company just a young man and
[53:06] his little newly married wife going
[53:09] along the road many robbers were in the
[53:12] land in those days like Barabbas and so
[53:15] forth and what a parable that would have
[53:18] been to them to see just a little man
[53:21] walking along with a little woman to be
[53:24] mother
[53:25] sitting on a little donkey and would
[53:27] have let us take in his hand for a group
[53:29] of wild mean men to write down and
[53:33] through her and throw her off of there
[53:36] and do evil
[53:38] but you know
[53:39] if God is leading the way what
[53:42] difference does it make
[53:45] God will protect you to your destination
[53:48] there is no dangers when you are walking
[53:50] with the Lord oh brother this what I
[53:53] love he said there is no dangers when
[53:56] you are walking with the Lord
[53:58] I will believe easily that there was a
[54:01] host of Ten Thousand Angels walking
[54:03] along there with that man and that
[54:05] little donkey she was just as safe as
[54:08] she could be
[54:11] that is why Debbie said in Psalms 27 he
[54:15] said the Lord is my light and my
[54:16] salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is
[54:19] the strength of my life of whom shall I
[54:21] be afraid if we have God protecting us
[54:24] if God have dispatched angels to protect
[54:27] us who is the enemy to Hamas
[54:30] oh beloved brother let's think about
[54:32] that amen
[54:33] amen all the cares of this world
[54:35] Hallelujah there for a Time but there's
[54:38] nothing that can touch your soul so long
[54:41] as you are a child of God nothing
[54:43] nothing I say nothing
[54:47] when even the devil was asking about job
[54:50] before the Throne of God and God said
[54:53] well you can go and test him but don't
[54:55] touch his soul God gave devil a strict
[54:59] warning he said don't touch his soul
[55:00] because that belongs to me I am holding
[55:03] his soul and you and I our souls are in
[55:07] the hands of God no evil spirit can
[55:10] touch us because we are being protected
[55:12] by God hallelujah amen and amen let me
[55:17] give you a little testimony before I
[55:18] close
[55:20] back home
[55:22] in my church
[55:24] uh only 28.
[55:26] of February
[55:29] um
[55:30] I was coming from Mission
[55:33] from Malawi and
[55:34] when I came by God's grace I went to
[55:37] church the following Sunday
[55:41] and one of our sisters came around he
[55:43] said pastor I have something to tell you
[55:45] I said what
[55:46] he said on the 28
[55:49] I was going to town
[55:51] and I boarded a taxi
[55:53] and when I entered into the taxi when I
[55:56] stopped the taxi
[55:57] I realized that there were three men
[55:59] seated at the back
[56:01] so of course I have to go to the front
[56:03] seat
[56:04] so then she entered into the car
[56:07] and sat at the front
[56:09] then all of a sudden before the driver
[56:11] would make a move
[56:12] one of the men at the back seat said
[56:16] we've got one meat
[56:19] you understand that
[56:20] they got one meat
[56:23] yeah
[56:25] what kind of meat is it a goat meat or
[56:27] cow meat
[56:29] or human meat
[56:31] not knowing they were kidnappers
[56:34] yeah that's why the man made that
[56:35] statement
[56:37] so when this
[56:39] sounded to the sister
[56:41] then immediately
[56:44] he asked the driver to stop because she
[56:47] want to get down
[56:49] and you know their driver was not going
[56:51] to stop
[56:53] and the sister said driver
[56:56] I said I'll get them
[56:58] and the driver said well you just
[57:00] boarded the car why do you want to get
[57:01] down
[57:02] he said yes I've I've forgotten
[57:05] something at home so I won't go get it
[57:07] let me go out
[57:09] and the driver was not stopping
[57:12] he continued to speed up
[57:15] beloved
[57:18] there's not nothing to do he couldn't
[57:20] open the door and you know fall out
[57:23] but when they went for some few distance
[57:28] then they came to meet three men
[57:31] standing by the roadside
[57:34] and they stopped the car
[57:37] okay now when they stopped the car
[57:40] then one
[57:42] of the men told a driver he needed to
[57:44] ask the driver he said I have heard the
[57:48] voice of this woman
[57:49] from afar
[57:51] that she want to get down why are you
[57:54] not stopping the car for the woman to
[57:57] get down
[57:59] surprisingly the driver couldn't say
[58:02] anything
[58:03] so at that point the sister got the
[58:06] chance to open the door
[58:08] and get out from the car
[58:10] and when she bumped the door like this
[58:13] she was telling to say thank you to the
[58:15] man and there was nobody behind her
[58:19] I said sister
[58:21] don't share this with me alone
[58:24] go to the church
[58:26] and give a testimony
[58:28] for God have sent his angel
[58:31] to save you from the hands of the
[58:32] kidnappers
[58:34] Hallelujah and I told the church beloved
[58:37] I remember the same thing
[58:40] in the house of Abraham that day when
[58:43] God was going to destroy Sodom and
[58:44] Gomorrah there were three men that
[58:47] passed by the house of Abraham
[58:50] and one of the men spoke
[58:53] Hallelujah he promised Abraham said at
[58:57] next year by this according to the time
[58:59] of life I will visit you that was
[59:02] personal pronoun I not we three I will
[59:06] visit you Hallelujah and your word Sarah
[59:09] will have a son
[59:11] Hallelujah that was the protective angel
[59:13] in the house of Abraham
[59:15] and in the life of sister Dorcas it was
[59:18] the same thing there were three men but
[59:21] one of them spoke he didn't say we have
[59:24] heard he said I have heard the voice of
[59:27] this woman I want to get down why are
[59:29] you not stopping the car
[59:31] oh brother

[59:39] is always around us

[59:46] to his word don't let us provoke
[59:50] anything that he says don't let us
[59:54] challenge don't let us doubt anything
[59:55] let us listen and abide by it for his
[1:00:00] angels are always around us

[1:00:05] let me finish with my code so that we
[1:00:07] can call it a a day okay
[1:00:10] amen
[1:00:16] amen now

[1:01:58] to Shepherds

[1:02:02] the shepherd to guide them
[1:02:04] a sheep is perfectly helpless he cannot
[1:02:08] go by himself
[1:02:09] and that is why we ought to be like
[1:02:11] ships
[1:02:13] God only guide ships God don't guide
[1:02:16] goats
[1:02:18] God the goat is a stubborn creature

[1:02:33] ship shipwear creatures to be Reliant
[1:02:37] they rely on their Shepherds yes
[1:02:40] in fact they don't act till the Shepherd
[1:02:43] have instructed them amen
[1:02:47] one time when the prophet said that he
[1:02:49] went to a place and that place there was
[1:02:52] uh there was this kind of open market
[1:02:55] that their Wares are not in the shops
[1:02:59] like how you have in America here you
[1:03:01] know Walmart you know uh you know and
[1:03:04] all those no no this it was an open
[1:03:06] market and you see the the the
[1:03:10] foodstuffs all over the pavement and
[1:03:12] people walk through it and he said he
[1:03:16] saw a Shepherd bringing a ship across
[1:03:18] the way
[1:03:21] and when he saw the ship come he said
[1:03:23] wow let's wait till this ship get to
[1:03:25] these food stops they will have to
[1:03:27] scatter it
[1:03:29] but he said to his amazement
[1:03:31] the ship got to those place that place
[1:03:34] where the food stars are pile up on the
[1:03:36] pavement and no ship touch anything
[1:03:40] because they followed the Shepherds this
[1:03:43] way they went away
[1:03:45] Allelujah and Professor that if he had a
[1:03:48] puppy that day
[1:03:50] if the people will understand his
[1:03:52] language he will have preached a sermon
[1:03:54] to them
[1:03:55] Hallelujah yes we are sheep of God
[1:03:59] amen amen we are we are in this world we
[1:04:02] see so many things to attract us but we
[1:04:05] don't put our minds on those things we
[1:04:08] focus on our Shepherd we follow Jesus
[1:04:10] Christ we want to go the way he instruct
[1:04:12] us nothing of this world will have to
[1:04:15] influence us to be unbelievers amen and
[1:04:18] amen are you catchingly beloved
[1:04:22] he said they've got to be guided
[1:04:24] but what what is guiding you
[1:04:28] don't get a goat

[1:04:33] God God never give us a goat he gave us
[1:04:38] his son the holy spirit to guide us he
[1:04:41] is our guide not some mermaid his men
[1:04:44] but a god-giving husband who feed the
[1:04:47] sheep upon sheep food so as to bring
[1:04:50] them under the protections of God
[1:04:53] hallelujah and thank God beloved that
[1:04:57] today we are being protected

[1:05:21] conscious of what we do
[1:05:25] anything that we do must be in line with
[1:05:27] the word
[1:05:28] my fear is that he said we should not
[1:05:31] provoke the angel because when we
[1:05:33] provoke the angel he will not pardon us
[1:05:37] Hallelujah
