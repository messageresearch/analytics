TRANSCRIPT
========================================
being not gonna happen you are now seated in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus because you have been quickened from death unto life amen hallelujah everybody wants to see the power of God but they all you know everybody wants to do Miracles you know what it's amazing everybody wants to see the power of God they want to feel the presence of God they want to see the anointing they want to see Miracles but nobody wants to repent why won't all this stuff well do you want to repent will know well that's the problem for you because you ain't gonna have Resurrection until you're ready to die that's the problem with churches and that's the problem with people they want every they want all the blessings but nobody wants to die you imagine Christ listen I want to have a glorious Church Without spot or monish but I don't want to die for it that's how we act that's how people act and listen Christ himself Hallelujah now help me out somebody he himself said if there's another way if it's possible let this cup pass for me but nevertheless amen and nevertheless not my will thy will be done and brother Ben said he died More Death than Gethsemane than he did the cross why because he died to his own will and if you and I want Resurrection Life if we want this life in us we've got to lay down our own will amen people come to brother Brown law teach our people how to do Miracles teach our sisters how to do all these great things this is why they don't want to learn their ABCs right right they want to they want to raise the dead they can raise their clothes high enough off them to quit showing everything off hey man they don't want to dress modest they don't want to oh well praise the Lord we'll talk about some narcissified men too too much amen we all y'all got a wish Bones have a backbone amen we want the power to do Miracles you only got the power to stand up and say you believe in Jesus Christ you got the power to dress right well praise the Lord I just want big crowds and miracles that's what Pentecost one that's what people wanted amen listen Jesus was not interested in being a paid performer right I mean he's not interested in being a rodeo clown or something at the circus amen he is not interested in being a stand-up comedian he's not interested in doing a TED Talk for fifty thousand dollars a thing because you know what he can he can Inspire somebody to feel good about themselves he's not interested in performing for people even when they took him captive and they smote him with a crown of crown of thorns on his head said prophesy unto us listen it's not that he lacked the ability right that's not why he's there he's not there to clown for somebody you and I we're not here today to entertain one another but with Easter eggs and these ideas about bunnies and all of the Easter is just such a good feel good time listen somebody suffered that we could celebrate this today he suffered and died for us but praise God he rose again [Music] if we didn't rise again we wouldn't be celebrating if he didn't die in the first place we wouldn't be celebrating today man so if we're going to live Godly in Christ we have to surrender ourselves to the plan of God as well Amen brother said that seed's got to die and listen not just die it's got to rot out some of you all looking too much of this hust still he needs to rot out a little bit more mine looks particularly alive this morning amen I had some Mediterranean food last night I tell you what it's it's doing something but I don't know if it's rotten I don't know it's kind of stirring in there a little bit amen listen this thing that we carry around it's got to rot out because it's not fit for the kingdom that's why you're not taking it with you hey man what praise the Lord somebody help me out Mr we get so worried all the time how am I going to make a Rapture you're not gonna make it by your flesh you're not going to make it by what you do in your flesh listen your flesh ain't fit to go on the Rapture that's why you're getting a new body you're not doing it by your flesh it's not by power it's not by my it's by his spirit what's his Spirit The Same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead he shall also Quicken not just in the resurrection but now but now here today in your life he sound quick in your motor bodies what is it brother Graham said he'll throw this Mortal body into subjection this body that used to do the things of the world he's brought it subject by the power of the Resurrection in you amen amen subject to the word of God I want you to understand when Jesus died even his death was according to the word of God Amen to just die willy-nilly he died according to the word of God the scripture tells us that when he died he was he was he was buried according to the scriptures amen he died according to the scriptures and he raised it again according to the scriptures amen praise the Lord Jesus had the power to lay down his own life and take it up again now praise God you don't have to even do that it's not your job to raise yourself up but the spirit that's in you will do it you believe that amen let's see that's not your job to raise yourself listen you've got one job as a Christian amen it's the same thing Jesus did you've just got to die in the right place hey man if you can die in the right place listen Abraham understood if I die and I get buried in the right place I will raise again when his wife's Terror died he went and bought a field from the sons of hath because he knew one day in Jerusalem there'd be a resurrection he wasn't worried about honey he said you know what if I bury her in the right place if I plant myself in the right place God will raise it up when Joseph was done in Egypt and he knew that God's people would be in Egypt for 400 years they're going to lead coffin he said don't you bury my bones down here in Egypt when you go back because you will amen somebody help me out because you're going back because God said you're going back and when you go back you bury me there where my fathers are buried because they believed there was going to be a resurrection and when Christ died on the cross and the earthquake the Bible says that the graves of them would slept there were open why would why did they raise back up they were buried in the right place and man it's not just that you die you die out to the word if you'll hide your life with Christ in God if you'll die out to yourself and be buried this old life that's why Paul could testify I am crucified with Christ I'm not just crucified I'm crucified with Christ when he was crucified I'm identified with that crucifixion when he was married I was identified with that burial and praise God when he rose again that's the resurrection I'm identified with because he lives ye shall live also I'm I so you've got a job you're going to die out the right way you gotta rot out amen listen the more you can get out of the way the more God can have his way I mean you want to see more of God where listen people want to see God all the time well you know what I want I want to see him right here listen if you can't see him here don't go looking for him somewhere else that's the problem people are looking in the desert they look in the bed chamber they're looking for Christ if I can find the right church if I can find the right preacher if I can find the right Ministry I'm looking where God's I want to find where God's at you ought to be able to see him in the mirror maybe not the one in your bathroom but this one you ought to be able to see him in your own life if you can't see him in your own life stop looking for him somewhere else amen reach it hey man well praise the Lord brother it's really hard you know you're talking about dying out yourself brother that's really hard for me to do well how hard was it for Jesus the guy could have called for a legion of angels he could have cleaned the place up he had the ability listen he didn't he so wanted to avoid it he sweat great drops of blood you know you've done that lately listen it's really hard brother it's really hard to submit myself to God like that what do you think it was for Christ you and I don't have an excuse today well listen that that thing you're talking about is just too hard for me well it's impossible with men it is impossible with men but With God all things are possible amen praise the Lord it's like I said if you don't see him in your own life don't look from somewhere else listen that's the very essence of Christianity Amen brother bam says this in the Easter seal he says notice the very essence of this Resurrection is to tell and to show and to prove that Jesus is raised up from the dead he's not dead can I get a witness he's a living he lives here he's in US listen if he's not alive and you don't do you no good he's got to be alive in you for it to do something for you today amen he said I'll be with you even in you a little while in the world sees me no more yet ye shall see me how are you going to see him for I will be with you even in you until the end of the world listen if you ain't got that you ain't got nothing that's everything everything you've got doesn't matter how big your house is it doesn't matter how much you go to church it doesn't matter what your tithing account looks like it doesn't matter what your ministry is if you ain't got this you're you're you've got nothing you're poor you're wretched you're miserable you're blind you're naked and you probably don't even know it see people do this there you know people they try to they try to validate the historical accuracy of Jesus and I'm not against that or anything but you know that's what it is well we need to find some history we need to find some documents that that prove the historical accuracy about Jesus Christ and what he did and this and that but you notice Jesus isn't worried about validating his own historical accuracy hey man when he rose from the grave and he went to his disciples he wasn't over there trying to verify the time in the place of his birth well here's a birth certificate here's some information I've got some records here praise the Lord let's listen the question is birth hey man will they do it today with the prophet well you know he's born three days this way and this I'm not thinking what in the world you're going to fight about him not having a birth certificate because he's born in 1909 it's like my wife's Grandpa was born in 1930 he had to get in in Ohio I don't know how it is here but now you have to have your your birth certificate when you get your driver's license we ain't got one he was born in a house or barn or something or whatever 1930. he listen he had records from being in the service he had records from all the stuff that said no we need the birth certificate I'm thinking the man's here you sent him off to war do you use them for everything else but we don't know if he's really born here I'm thinking oh my goodness they don't mind using you but as soon as you want something yeah well listen we need some documentation that you were born in the United States listen Jesus wasn't worried about trying to get in the BMV get himself a driver's license he wasn't pulling all these papers listen Joseph and Mary not my biological parents and this and that I'm I'm not listen people said that they said he was a legitimate child they call him a Piezo Bob they call him every kind of name and he's not worried when he comes to his disciples at the resurrection listen I need to document all this so there's some historical evidence about me later on that's not how he chose to prove that he was alive again amen he did not choose to say listen I got some photographs from when I was on Mount Transfiguration and the cloud came down that it wasn't a Thor rocket or it wasn't exaggerated This Cloud was really there he wasn't worried about all that that's not how he's going to prove the resurrection amen because you've got like I said you got the same arguments today what about this event and what about this timeline and what about this amen and listen they'll argue with you till you're blue in the face because they want to disprove it amen like I said if Jesus was not exempt from it we're not going to be [Music] like I said I'm not against apologetics people they want to find physical evidence of things in the Bible I say well that's great that's fine amen they can show you the tomb that Jesus was in and things that tie into the Bible that's fine that's wonderful all those things are true and they're important but listen Believers are going to believe it anyway and unbelievers are not going to believe it no matter what you show them hey man praise the Lord so when Jesus rose the first day of the week he was proving the resurrection that he is the resurrection how is he going to prove the resurrection he's going to continue to do what he's always done because only he could do the things he did so he said you know what the works that I do you're going to do also and greater than these how you do because I'd go to the father because listen you can get two historians and they can argue about physical evidence well listen I hate carbonated this for this state well this carbon date says six months difference and they can fly and they can argue about physical evidence all they want but listen when you got somebody that was dead and they raise again it's really hard to argue that when God takes a person that's to get an incurable disease and they get the doctors don't even know how to argue that well I don't know what to make of it hey man listen when God does things that man can't do and he continues today to do things that man can't do that proves the resurrection we've tried so much to prove it by everything else we try to prove my psychology and intellect and Science and all these things but God ordained for us to prove it one way by doing the things that he did come on brother my my when he proved the resurrection he validated everything the word had ever said about him amen and I want you to understand the bad Theology of his day didn't stop him I'm in the wickedness of the Roman government didn't stop him amen amen your interpretation these men's interpretation of the Resurrection didn't stop him the stone didn't stop him the seal didn't stop him Devils couldn't stop him nothing stopped him amen listen if the resurrection is in you you don't need a bunch of excuses for why it's not the same you've got evidence we've got tangible evidence today of the Resurrection your life is hid with Christ and God it's no longer I that live Paul said it's no longer you if you've been there you're a witness it's not me Christ lives in me amen amen hallelujah man I think about the disciples like I said they had doubts that day they had no Direction they didn't know what they were going to do but that morning when they approached the grave they saw the stone had been rolled away amen why the sea was broken when the sea was broken and they ran they saw you know what he's not here praise the Lord now listen listen to the angel there was an angel that testified I love this there's an angel and that seal was broken there was an angel testifying he's not here amen listen Christ didn't need to move the stone back to leave the tomb you understand this the guy could walk through walls at this point he can just appear wherever he wants he doesn't have to move the stone back to leave he moved the stone back for us I want you to look and see he's no longer here my my he wrote it back for a testimony for our sakes because of that seal that was there that said he was dead it was broken and the stone was rolled back he's not there it's a testimony he's alive he's just not alive there amen well we have the same thing in this day amen you know it's it's interesting to me I saw this church billboard or whatever it is outside one time and they've they had the quote there from the angel I think was the Book of Luke we said he's he has risen he's not here I'm thinking well I don't want to go to church there I want to go where he's at hey man if he's not here in this Garden I don't want to be here I want to know where he is so I want to understand now is the sealed testify being broken that Christ is alive it lets you know where he's not at he's not in this tomb amen unless a denomination and man's ideas and crazy they veiled Christ throughout seven Church ages and this book this book of redemption was sealed with Seven Seals but when these seals were broken who broke the seals who lose the seals it was Christ and was it testified testifies where he's not at amen it's amazing to me when I was a young believe when I listened to the seals and I'm reading it I'm like what's this all about what the devil's done that first white horse rider is the spirit of antichrist you know what it's doing is testifying where he's not at don't look for him where he's not at amen that's what God's trying to tell you listen these things where this has happened God's telling you don't look for him there amen praise the Lord amen oh my I tell you what the seals have testified he's not in the Tomb the same thing like I said with with that you know uh where Satan is Satan always wants to be where God's at but you know he he can he can go to church listen Satan can go to church hey man Satan can get into politics he can get the preachers he's getting all kinds of things but there's one thing Satan can't be he can't be the word he can't be the word amen and listen you and I if we're born again by the spirit of God if that seed remains in us then you and I are part of this word and this word is our absolute amen praise the Lord hallelujah you know brother Branham it's interesting because you you know that first seal he talks about the white horse rider brother Brandon himself I love this he himself taught for years it was the spirit of Christ you know the and brothers and the teachers they taught that that was uh I got here he said the teachers taught it was the Holy Spirit conquering in the first stage but when the seals come and the seals are open I said but my revelation my Revelation by the holy spirit amen it's not that way my Revelation by the holy spirit is that Christ and the Holy Spirit is the self same person only in a different form and then what was that white horse right here it was the spirit of antichrist he had a bow but no arrows amen and that first seal revealed where Christ was not at he's not in man-made religion amen he's not in denomination he's not in organization that's why brother Brandon can say listen I was against denomination all those years I didn't know why now I know God's not in it now that doesn't mean the people it's the spirit you're not against the people actually you're for them you're for them that's why you're against the thing that's bound them organize religion amen listen there's all kinds of organized religion when that seal broke it let you know he's not here just like that church billboard he's not there that second seal that second that red horse rider Politics the power of government entering in it's amazing to me how many message Believers their hopes are right on the next election yes it astounds me we'll sit there and we'll argue about politics well listen if so and so gets voted in and so-and-so and this and that listen it doesn't matter who gets voted in this country's done for that's thus save the Lord America's not going to have some big sleeping Revival we're not going to bring it back listen a prophet wouldn't even pray for it anymore and we think we vote the right kind of a guy and listen I love paying lower taxes I love it before 14 inflation said in my my money was worth something I love it amen praise God that's fine but listen my Hope's not built in there those things are going to listen anything that can be shaken is now being shaken there's only one thing that can't be shaken you and I as Believers have received a kingdom which cannot be removed if you're looking for God in politics he's not there quit looking for him there he's not in it well praise the Lord you think about that third seal there they were merchandise he's certainly not merchandise young man praise the Lord you know what what's interesting to me God God put a little something in that third seal for you amen because the devil and the powers the Antichrist they were selling everything they were selling wheat and barley but you know what God Said but don't you touch that oil and don't you touch that wine so listen if you if you sit under a Ministry you go to church that touches the all on the line you listen God's Not There amen listen I heard it years ago I'm sat in a church and they said you know what the spirit of God In Our Generation it's not like it wasn't brother Brandon's really I thought he was the same yesterday today and forever well now listen the anointing is now lifting off the people and the spirit of God's just lifting off the Earth that's not the same I thought that's interesting and I heard a brother his brother Isaiah Brooks is actually preaching about he was preaching one day he was talking about the wise and the foolish version he's talking about this very same thing he said you know some people say that the anointing is lifted but we look at about the five why's the five foolish he said maybe it's lifting off of you but we find it doesn't lift off the wise just lifts off the foolish that's the wise version she's got as much oil and extra she's got oil in her lamp and oil on your vessel and any Ministry or any man that would say the spirit of God if we don't have the spirit of God's day like they did back there he's lying to you God's not in that God's in the place that says he's the same yesterday today and forever my God still raises the dead he still heals the sick he still prophesies he still gives Visions if you take any if you take up deadly servants not saying you should go find some now listen they won't hurt you why because he said it's the same any voice that would tell you what's what brother Bram said any voice that would say he's not the same today as he was it's a voice of discrepancy God's not in that don't look for him there amen they want to see where Christ was listen he was in the Tomb go check it again he's still not there why check it at third time why check it at all the FDA listen if the angel told me it's empty that was good enough for me [Applause] the angel this out this day this messenger said he's not in these things you know what that's good enough for me the Seal's been broken someone listen I didn't roll that stone back right hey man it was the angel he sat on top the thing amen listen he's gone my mind you know what it's it's interesting to me president talks about Peter gave a he gave out a prescription the day of Pentecost I said you know if a doctor would mess with that he's he's writing you something to kill you amen right and that's what you've got today you've got men saying you know what he's not the same he was back at Pentecost he's he's not the same things are different listen that man's killing me whether he realizes it or not amen if he was a doctor we would revoke his license hey man I don't care how many n85 masks you wear or how many vaccines what you need today is a double dose of the Holy Ghost amen if you ain't got that amen you've been sold a lie hurt not the oil and the wine what is the oil it's his Spirit what's the wine I love it brother it's not just wine it's not just Revelation it's the stimulation of Revelation amen listen if you Revelations stimulates you a little bit you ought to be so happy you got the good stuff I mean you got the kind of stuff Jesus gave out the third day Cana and then you ain't got that flat wine that you get from the cheap Dollar Store hope you're not buying that anyway you got the good stuff this Revelation it's got some stimulation in it amen this will change your life amen oh that's that new wine the kind that makes you smile all the time my my well now why would you see that's the problem I said brother Graham said people get just enough religion to be miserable hey man well if Christ isn't raised from that we would be of all men most miserable in other words if he is raised you're not supposed to be the most miserable people on the face of the Earth and that's exactly how some Believers are you think they were the most miserable people in the world and I'm thinking but he's alive you're not supposed to be miserable you should be excited because he lives that means you live also well praise the lord well I'm now I'm just ranting you pray for me brother bam says this rising in the sun it's familiar quote to us hopefully but brother Brown says this he said he speaking of Christ he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was open What's the opening the seal isn't revealing Christ notice the very seven angels which represent the seven churches all completed we couldn't even see it why because it was veiled hey man it's veil by all these things where he's not at they did I love this see he made his enemies testify they took the picture not us talking about the cloud there in the in 1963. there he is standing there Supreme judge showing that he is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us notice quickening power lets us see his coming quickening power snatch us from death to life quickening power gives us discernment to know what's wrong with you and what to do what you've done what you ought not to have done what you should have done what you will be quickening power all these things could that be why people miss it today they ain't got enough quickening power right it's like I said a few moments ago some people say we don't have that kind of power then how are you going to see it only cricketing Power lets you see the Revelation in the first place we've got to have it listen we can't just get a little bit we've got to have so much people want it from us I hope the wise virgin walk up or the foolish version walk up to you listen I want what you got listen I got just enough for me listen I got something for me and man you ought not to be going to get it from somebody else you ought to have so much virtue coming out of your life people want what you got right oh my God our lord Jesus is so full of quickening power he was all of it together he was so full he said you destroy this body I'll raise it up in three days talk about confidence in quickening power destroy this body this Temple I'll bring it up in three days why did he say that he knew that it was written of him see it was written by the word of God which cannot fail the word said I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell and he knowed Hallelujah he know that quickly power would raise him up there wouldn't be one cell corrupt I'm saying this for a reason Jesus didn't just have quickening power he had confidence in it he had so much he said if you tear my body you destroy this Temple listen the them man that killed him then saw his confidence that's why they put a seal on the tomb they said we remember he said this we remember his confidence how he boasted they would raise on the third day that's how much confidence he has it we've barely got enough confidence for one trial we've barely got enough confidence to go to church half the time oh I just don't know if God's gonna show up I just don't know if God's with me this man had enough confidence he died with it it arose again well Hallelujah said you destroy this Temple I'll bring it back in three days why it was prophecy the word of God of Prophecy if it's true word of God cannot fail and the same prophecy the word of God that said he'd raise him up says that we are already raised with him that's why you have confidence because the same word that said he would raise says you already are yeah no wonder he said fear not and it is written that the spirit that is in US was in him now in us also quickens our Immortal bodies is fear not friend the s o n is up the Sun is up amen that's why we're here today we believe in a sunrise not the kind you see 365 days a year we believe the Son of God is up and listen he's up today I believe that's why we're here because if you lift him up he said I'd draw all men unto me listen I didn't draw myself here I didn't draw you hear God Drew you here today the Son of God the son of man has been lifted up We've Got Confidence that the same power that raised them up has already raised us up that means if that same powers in you that same power heals the sick that same power cleanses the leper amen that same power in your life cast out devils listen Jesus is so full of quickening power he'd walk into the building and the Devils would throw themselves on the ground and we act like we're afraid to go in our house we're afraid to do this I tell you what I get so frustrated some believe it's got just enough quickening power him to fill a thimble I mean they got this stuff quickly power to be miserable amen well the devil did this to me and the devil did that and I hear it all the time with the devil and the devil I'm thinking maybe you ought to be scared when you walk in the room man they're begging Jesus to go into a bunch of pigs when he showed up and then you are not the tale today you are the head you have been exalted far above amen somebody say far above far above all principality and power and might and Dominion I'm so tired of beat up Christians oh I'm just fighting the devil this week and the devil this and the devil man he don't even want to come around when you get enough quickening power in you then he wants to run the other way I still believe hopefully not the only one I still believe a man can so completely serve God till the devil don't know what to do with him and I ain't sitting here trying to fight him every day listen he's defeated amen listen you don't defeat him you remind him he is defeated listen the devil torments you he tries to bother you you don't sit there and toggle the war with them that's where people mess up well listen I'll show him and I'll do this you don't have to fight him he's all ready defeated you do what Joshua did you put your foot on his neck and you remind him and you remind the enemy and you remind your circumstances listen this uncircumcised Philistine this enemy of God is already defeated I will not fight with you I will not contend with you I will tell you to leave because the Bible says if you submit yourself to God and you resist the devil he will flee from you I tell you what well praise the Lord submit yourselves to God see that's what nobody wants to do right you know we make great um we make great lofty ideas out of the idea of Liberty because we come from a country that's found on the idea of Liberty right and the Bible talks about Liberty you know we love Liberty amen we love to have Liberty in church we love to have Liberty and preaching we love to have Liberty in our homes but you know we talk so much about Liberty and our idea of Liberty is we're going to run around we're going to shout we're going to do all these great things we're going to have a good time but you know you can do all that and not have what I'm talking about hey man if you've got real Liberty they can throw you into jail like they did Paul and Silas you can be in shackles in the middle of the night you can be beat up and you're the freest person that's ever been because you're free from yourself you're free from sin you're free from Death you're free from Fear it doesn't matter what your natural circumstances you know there's one thing that's greater than Liberty submission listen the Bible says there's lots of people that promise Liberty oh we got we have Liberty in church we have Liberty they promise Liberty but they're the Servants of corruption and Paul says or maybe it's Peter the Bible says the Bible says you've got Liberty but don't use your Liberty as a cloak of maliciousness in other words you can take all these things to disguise a wrong motive you do all the wrong things amen but you submit yourself to God when you've got Liberty and you choose to submit to God that Christ did in that Garden that's real power and the prophet said a man that's fully surrendered to God is omnipotent oh I want Power surrender quit surrender to everything else questioned your misgivings and unbelief surrender to God listen this Bible says things about you and you and I it's not a job to validate the historian or the accuracy of it listen he proves it by doing it if this Bible says you're holy then guess what you're holy this Bible says you're righteous then guess what you're righteous this Bible says you can heal the sick guess what you can heal the sick this Bible says you've passed from Death In The Life guess what that means what it says quickening power lets us see it say we need the quickening power today you know I say this often can you imagine trying to describe color to a man that was blind his whole life you couldn't do it amen until he has the sense to perceive it you can explain it and talk about all you want it doesn't mean anything until he's experienced it and that's the problem with church is we've tried to so explain this Bible and so explain this message and we lead them to all kinds of intellectual ideas and all of our understanding that's not our job to do that our job is leading to Christ where they have a sixth sense and then when you see a man that's born again will see the kingdom of God amen we need less explanation about it and we need to show people the essence of their resurrections to tell and to show amen you cannot educate people into an Awakening no amount of propaganda will create an Awakening for them amen they've got to experience quickening power for themselves amen we have Christians here today we're Christians they praise the Lord we got a few here we gotta hopefully much what changing quickening power did that you didn't do it listen I know what I was I'll guarantee you right now I didn't fix that you can't you can't fix a lot of ways well praise the Lord amen quickening power did that to you amen yes the seal this and there was a seal over your life of sin and death amen this flesh it was hiding something in it when you were in the world when you were sinning when you were doing the wrong things there was something hidden behind this flesh amen there was a predestinated seed that was laying there sin and death and circumstances in the flesh it hit it but one day when the light of this word struck that seed I mean it it removed that old Power from your life the Bible says we've been circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands amen it broke that seal over your life and now you've got a seal not from the world not from your first birth you've been born again and you're sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day of redemption the seal testifies there was a dead man here amen oh my help me out somebody I was dead in sins of trespasses I wasn't alive I thought I was alive I thought I was living I didn't know what life was but when Christ came Christ who is our life came and he revealed the mystery that had been hid through my life it had been hid Through the Ages but it's been revealed now and you and I it's Christ in you he's the hope of glory [Music] the Seal of my life testifies there was a dead man here that guy's gone he's gone never to return again but Christ lives there now and the life that I live in the flesh I live by the faith of the son of God my mind I you know I could sit here and go on about these seals but you know brother Graham talks about the opening the seals what happens when a seal is opened it thundered it thundered and what is a thunder it's the voice of God you know what are you tonight this morning what are you you're the voice of God to this generation that seal in your life now you are brother Graham said Living Voices you're thundering out what are you thundering out rage and we're going to show the politicians with sweetness humility train amen you get smart on the cheek you turn the other cheek listen lots of people can work miracles but they can't turn the other cheek help me out somebody I know a lot of people man they they can prophesy they can do this and that but they can't they can't ever admit they're wrong they can't ever say they're sorry what's real power anyway it's power over yourself and listen Balaam could prophesy but he couldn't give up his love for money now who's in charge of bailam in his money that's his God praise the Lord I'm speaking something to you now a lot of people can do all kinds of things they have no Mastery with their own selves they had no Liberty from their own nature what good is it all anyway amen thundering voices this is the thunder that shakes the devil brother REM said sweetness humility yeah you know I was just talking to a brother the other day this isn't in here so if I butcher it forgive me but you know it's like that time Brother Bear was dealing with the IRS and uh you know one day he just got so fed up with it they were calling you told sister me tell them I'm not here well Bill you're here I'm going out the back door tell him I'm not here none of us have ever been there before I'm sure situation like that well I'm not really here trust me mentally you're as far away as you want to be from it amen you know he went out that door and he said you know a little you you watch how little synonyms and there comes his boy and uh I forget what it was but he he reminds his dad the whole thing oh like you had mom tell the IRS you know brother Berman he recognized you know what somebody's watching my life my life's speaking something you're you're living Epistles today you're the you're the voice you're the thunder in your own life it's speaking something you know and the reason the reason I'm bringing this up like I said this is totally whatever but brother bran went to that man he apologized to him now think about this I I I'm not sure I know a lot of people would do that in the message brother Ryan went to the IRS agent the tax collector and he apologized said you know what and he told me he did and this is the part that strikes me the most you know that man said you know brother brand am I uh Mr Branham I respected you a lot before now he says but I think even more of you now think about that this man he did the wrong thing brother Bram did the wrong thing but he went and made it right and that so impressed this man because I think even more of you now we're so worried about our reputation sometimes why don't people think I did this and that listen they'll think more of you if you're honest amen that means something more to the world because they say you the world will look at your life say you know what if God can do that for them you can do it for me it's not this perfect portrait that we always present well I've always done this and I don't do this and I never struggle with this it's when we have that kind of thunder in our life that humility listen that humility my God help us all amen amen the Bible said he humbled himself Christ to the cross he didn't have to do that for you and I chose to take on that lowliness and we're always trying to one-up one another well I've got a bigger Ministry and I've got this and I've got that friends Christ and he doesn't have to do all that Eternal life's living for others amen right right I don't know I just I just I was thinking about that I don't know why I just I felt go that way but you know we miss it many times that's what real power is the the greatest anointing that ever struck the face of the Earth brother bam talks about Jesus got up he read the scroll where it was written of him the Lord has anointed me to preach the gospel to bind up the broken heart to heal the sick he set the Bible down in gracious words proceeded from his mouth that's the greatest anointing Brother Brad says you know if people talk about power but they don't really know what power is right why are you saying all this all of a sudden this is real power you might sit here and look at your own life say well I'm not I'm not successful like the word I'm not like so and so I don't listen that listen Christ I said it already once he's not trying to perform for others your life is not about how much you impress other people that's not eternal life Eternal life's not trying to measure up to somebody else listen Christ died and rose again that's why we're here today listen he didn't do that so you could be better than the Joneses he didn't so you could be he who he ordained you to be before the foundation of the world you be who Christ made you to be that's his reward you'd be who God made you to be why am I well I'm sorry I just Cobble this all together all of a sudden here but Lord I hope the Lord show you what I'm trying to get out I hope you see my heart amen it's in humility it's an esteeming others better than yourself it's more than just raising the dead although that's great I better be because we're all gonna have to raise up sometime [Laughter] that's what we're depending on Amen but he didn't raise from the edges because he wanted to it was the life in him that did it and that life testifies to these things I'm talking about I believe we've seen that life in the seventh angel in this generation I believe I'm seeing that life in some of you in us today yeah hopefully you see it in me I want you to see listen I want you to be able to see it in yourself I want you to be able to look in the mirror and say you know that's the Son of God that's a daughter of God I see Christ in my life I don't see him in my flesh I see past the Veil the veil that was a ranch by the power of God at rent The Veil it showed where he's at he's not in denomination he's not in all these things he's in you and I if we believe this word that's right that's what brother Ram said I I took this word that's why it was against domination he said I took this word as my absolute when you've made this your absolute you'll see Christ in every scripture you'll see Christ in your own life listen that's worth more than all the money in the world because that'll get you out of the grave amen the world is gathered together many places I did I saw something you know I'm in the breakfast thing there and there's the pope piece he's doing his thing because he was sick or something good Friday or whatever I'm thinking oh glory to God well the pope showed up you've got a whole billions of people looking to this man for leadership and he's as far off the word as anybody you might as well sell drugs in the alley or something no I mean yeah I don't know why you guys made me ran about everything I don't know what this is this is like I'm not trying to bully pull no but I mean it's just this Antichrist can be right amen and all kinds of people they've gathered to celebrate Easter the day that Christ rose from the dead and I'm thinking every day is Easter for you and I that's what the prophet said we've entered into our Easter it's just one day you know what today is for me it's just one day closer to the Rapture that's what it is for me this raps her is the culmination of what took place when he raised again from the third from the grave on the third day that you and I are going to live because he lives That's My Hope that's my Easter that I am our it's listen it's already begun so one day we're gonna have a Rapture listen we've heard a shout yes it's already going on don't miss it that's how I wish I lived back then you're living in the greatest moment that's ever been on the face of the Earth don't miss it he's alive today in you he's looking to take a people the manifestation of the sons of God is upon the scene to bring a resurrection don't miss it oh if we lived in the days of our fathers you're living today you get to see the things that Kings and Priests and and wise men they longed to see this day they wanted to see it we're trying to go backwards they were trying to get here right don't miss it it should be this close this is where Easter's at God made mountains God made planets God made galaxies God made he made stars that are multiple times bigger than our son and our sons multiple times bigger than this Earth God made all these things and yet where did God choose to dwell there's a little room in your heart about the size of a of all the places God could have dwelt of all the places God could have been so you know what that's what I want there's just a little spot there that's just enough it's it's just God's size enough for me to live there and we're so busy chasing after what we think is great things listen God living in you is as great as it gets amen if that's not great to you what is we esteem every we esteem people esteem all kinds of things God wants to live in just a little listen he'll live as much of it as you give him amen but he's got a little bow there if that's not greatness what is that's what brother Brown said that's what makes God so great he's so humble they would live in you and I of all the things not a star not Jupiter not a mountain in your heart amen how historical is the resurrection to use my question I want to close with today how historical is the resurrection to the Pope it's two thousand year old Resurrection that's how historical it is some people it's 150 years ago when their denomination started their gods stopped there gold God did this great thing in the Methodist Church what's he done since then nothing some people's Resurrection was 20 years ago at an altar call and that's that's that's where they that's where they met him and maybe that's where they left him how historical is the resurrection to you today I I say I don't want to even be historical to me I want to live in it now don't ever let this Easter become a historical event to you it doesn't matter how far back you place it when you make it historical you've missed the essence is to show and to tell he's alive right now today April 9th 2023 I won't tell you the time because then you'll start thinking about it I I am rapping up but don't make it a historical event no matter how far if it's yesterday you've missed it don't leave God yesterday don't leave him back there 10 years ago or 20 years ago oh I remember when God used to do this and I remember when I first came to God but what's he doing today in your life is he still are you still letting him have the preeminence today amen listen he's not back there he's right here he's the I am amen don't make him the I was and don't make him the I will be you know I believe one day we're going to have a great thing he's the I am he's great today it's great and you today brother bam says this our message therefore this is in the greatest news flash in history praise the Lord our message therefore is truly the greatest news flash that history has ever known there's been all kinds of make beliefs and so forth but the message the church has is the greatest news flash that's ever struck the world yes sir we buried him dead but he's up and alive again he wasn't just buried he was buried dead but he's alive again he was dead when we buried him and now he's alive forever more it's truly the facts he is not dead but he is Alive forevermore what a message what a flash the church ought to be thrilled the church should be burning this into the hearts of everybody they come into contact with he is not dead but alive that should make headlines everywhere you know what I bet the newspapers wouldn't sell as well if they printed the same thing every day news flash he's still alive I read that yesterday well guess what he's still alive today amen well listen I know don't solo but that's what I'm preaching to guess what he's still alive and the next time you talk to me guess what he's still alive extra extra news flash he is still alive Hallelujah he says they should make headlines of her but they don't believe it that's the reason it don't make headlines what's our headline sound like today well that's what I'm doing with this I'm going through that I'm having this problem well I wish this and I wish that what's your headline today what's your thunder speaking what's thundering out of your heart today you're the voice now you're the voice of the Resurrection what's your life testifying is your life testifying of complaints and defeat and struggle or does your life testify you know what this morning when I got into bed I just want to testify he's the same yeah he's alive when I got out of the bed he got out of bed with me when I brushed my teeth he brushed my teeth with me and then when I put my tire on he put it on with me and he's not upset whether it's crooked or not he's in me when I walked into this church I wasn't waiting for him to come back from the dead I wasn't waiting for him to come in the building he'd come in when I walked in when I go out he's going out with me when I lay down at night he's laying down with me I'm blessed in my Uprising I'm blessing my down setting I'm blessing my growing out I'm blessing my coming in news flash he's still alive in me let's testify a little bit where's he at today well I got problems I got trouble I got Jesus greater is he listen I'm not saying you don't got problems now I'm not saying you ain't got trials but I got good news for you listen that's what gospel is it's good news we've got so much bad news we feel everybody's ears with it but I will remind you no matter what you're going through not saying you're not going through stuff but yet greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world news flash I got troubles but news flash God is still greater this mountain shall be removed by the same God he's alive today they don't believe it that's the reason they don't make headlines I'm gonna finish this quote and you're going to listen to it sorry that's the reason they don't believe it but to the believer it makes a headline in the heart of the believer yes when he sees it and recognize it it Thrills him above everything that could ever be done it throws a headline that flashes everything else of the world dead as soon as he ate as soon as they see he is alive and with his church what a thrilled is to the believer greatest headlines that could ever be headlined right here is our message the Easter message but but we allow Easter from One Day in the year that's our Easter One Day in the year is an Easter every day in the year ought to be an Easter every day should be a thrilled day of the Resurrection but they've got mixed up with colored eggs and corsages and new Bots and rabbits and therefore Easter is just a propaganda amen but to the believer that knows day by day they live in an Easter because he has risen from the dead He's Alive forevermore in their hearts making himself known to his church day by day these signs shall follow them that believe amen if you need evidence of the Resurrection today I pray that you can look in a believer's life here if not your own say you know what Something's Happened listen I pray there's enough evidence that Christ is in me that if I were going to trial they'd find me guilty of being a Christian I pray that it would be a unanimous decision by the jury that man is a Christian amen I hope I'm I hope I'm so past denying it I couldn't deny it if I wanted to amen I want everybody to know everybody ought to know that Jesus Lives amen we ought to get outside and tell somebody Jesus Christ is King today amen you want to celebrate you should go share it with somebody that's how you celebrate it let them know you know what he's the same today you go home maybe you see a family or whatever it is you love no I just want you to just want to inform you in case you didn't know already he's alive today he's alive in you and I do you believe that today let's stand to our feet God bless you today oh my God's just God's looking out for he's looking for a people they believe this so much they want to live it amen let's believe it so much let's let's live like we believe it amen no if we don't live like we believe it we say we do that's just hypocrisy I mean if our words and our actions are not consistent I I told the I told the kids years ago I was talking about somebody I said well this person's I said their behavior is inconsistent I was taught my wife I said that's that's the nice way of saying they're a hypocrite so by the way you're talking about well Jesus called people hypocrites um our lives and our words and our actions should always be consistent amen you know I could start here for about an hour and talk about fake news and we all laugh because it's a big thing nowadays you know they go to print whatever is going to make money they go to print whatever and some people over here say this is fake news and vice versa I don't want our lives to testify like fake news organizations amen let's not say one thing and do another okay let's not live one thing and say another amen do you believe he's alive today do you believe it by the power of the Resurrection that's in you that when you go out here I want you to remember that Christ is in you and Christ does the same things today I'm not asking you to empty out the graveyard today although that power does lie within you it does lie within you see we laugh but it's true amen it's going to empty out not every well actually it will empty I agree at one point listen everybody that's ever died is going to raise just not all for the same reason someone to life and someone to judgment but that power whatever who whatever you're doing in your life it's in you it's not in this building it is currently but when you leave this building guess what it goes out because it's in you and I okay we're not going to church we are at the church and I want to remind you that's what Easter is really about today Christ is in you and he does the same things and I want to remind you in the midst when you go to your next trial that might be five minutes from now I don't know might be three minutes from now whatever you're going through remember greater is he that's in you and he that's in the world amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we're such a privileged people today Lord I pray you just take this this broke up thought it went a different way than I I thought it would but I'm trusting that something was said to to be a help to your people Lord may we not be like that hog that had all them apples drop on his head and didn't know where his blessings were coming from well we are certainly a blessed people probably everyone here could acknowledge that we're blessed people but Lord many times we live below our privilege we fail to realize just how blessed we really are but I pray today Lord that it would just stir our hearts Anew with the great thrill of this Resurrection Lord I lay in bed this last night just thinking about how how easy it is to get distracted how easy it is to make it a historical event how easy it is to look back and say that God has done certain things in our lives it's easy to get that way and not look to what you're going to do today well we get distracted so easily we we have many cares in this life and if we're not careful the cares of this life will drown in them it'll it'll sap from our lives the joy and the stimulation of the blessings of God Lord I pray we just take a little time today time everybody to reflect that you're a very present help your present help in time of trouble you're with us today you're in us today many times we forget like the disciples you're in our boat when we go through the storms of life we begin to panic and we become concerned Lord I pray you'd help us to be mindful may you stir our Pure Minds by way of remembrance you're in the ship with us today you're in the hearts and the lives of these your children today Lord if there'd be needs here today Lord I I pray that people understand I I'm not trying to marginalize that need I'm just trying to exalt the one that can answer it look we are a needy people we go through many things in life we have many things that we could cry out and complain about and no doubt many of them are valid Lord we I I would never want to take that away from people you're David he complains to you he cried out to you about things in the scripture but Lord beyond that we testify you are more than able to help us in the time of trouble Lord you are greater than any adversary any opposition that we would face you overcame hell death in the grave if you overcame those things you can overcome in us today whatever we go through we are more than sufficient for the challenge of this hour through Christ Jesus we are more than able to fulfill the word of God through Christ Jesus today what I pray you take this little group of people just the cream of the crop just just some real wonderful people lord they're wonderful because you live in them Lord there are great people because the great God lives in them the holy God on the Holy Mountain made a holy people here today we thank you for that we want to just give you all the praise and glory we thank you Lord we're so happy we're so happy to know that you're risen from the dead not just today but every day Lord when we're in the darkest trial of our life we're in the worst situation Lord we want to give up Lord I'm so thankful you didn't give up on us Lord you could have walked away from the cross you could have walked away from all these things but you chose to suffer and die from us and when you Rose again on that third day you rolled back that great stone and you broke that seal as a testimony for our sakes because you wanted us to know you want us to tell a Dying World Jesus Christ is alive may that be the very theme of our lives in the very Cry of our hearts this day and every day I pray that the tomb is still empty he's not in a tomb Lord you're not in a tomb you're not a man's ideas but you're in our hearts because we believe your word Lord may this word be ever ever greater ever more real to us Lord may we not slack may we not slide back from it may we press forward Lord we thank you for a rapture we thank you for the Blessed hope of the church the very culmination of all these things that were spoken of that you would take a people that have passed from Death unto life and they would not taste of even physical death but you would Quicken these mortal bodies we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed Hallelujah
