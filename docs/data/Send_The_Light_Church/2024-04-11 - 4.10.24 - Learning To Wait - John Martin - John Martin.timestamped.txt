[37:04] Christ's name amen
[37:07] amen all right 1 Chronicles chapter 22
[37:10] we want to start with verse number
[37:14] six then he called for Solomon his
[37:20] son and charged him to build the house
[37:24] of the Lord God of
[37:26] Israel and David said to Solomon my son
[37:31] as for me it was in my mind to build a
[37:35] house unto the name of the Lord my God
[37:38] but the word of the Lord came to me
[37:41] saying thou has shed blood
[37:44] abundantly and has made great Wars that
[37:46] thou should not build a house unto my
[37:50] name because thou has shed much blood
[37:53] upon the Earth in my
[37:56] sight be Behold a son shall be born to
[38:01] thee who shall be a man of rest and I
[38:05] will give him rest from all his enemies
[38:08] round about for his name shall be
[38:11] Solomon and I will give peace and
[38:15] quietness unto Israel in his days he
[38:20] shall build a house for my
[38:22] name and he shall be my son and I will
[38:25] be his father and I will establish L his
[38:27] throne the Throne of his kingdom over
[38:30] Israel forever now my son the Lord be
[38:33] with thee and prosper thou and build the
[38:36] house of the Lord thy God as he have
[38:40] said of thee only the Lord give thee
[38:43] wisdom and understanding and give thee
[38:47] charge concerning Israel that thou
[38:48] mayest keep the law of the Lord thy God
[38:52] then shall thou Prosper if thou take us
[38:56] heed to fulfill the statutes and the
[38:58] judgments which the Lord charged
[39:02] Moses uh with concerning Israel be
[39:06] strong and be good courage dread not nor
[39:10] be
[39:11] dismayed Now Behold in my uh and now
[39:15] behold in my
[39:18] trouble I have
[39:20] prepared for the house of the Lord a
[39:24] 100,000 talents of gold and a thousand
[39:28] thousand tals of silver and of brass and
[39:31] iron without weight for it is in
[39:35] abundance Timber also and stone have I
[39:40] prepared and thou mayest add there unto
[39:44] moreover there are workmen with thee in
[39:47] abundance hewers and workers of stone
[39:50] and Timber and all manner of cunning men
[39:53] for every manner of work of the gold and
[39:56] silver and brass and iron there is no
[40:00] number arise therefore and be doing and
[40:05] the Lord be with
[40:06] thee David also commanded all the
[40:09] princes of Israel to help Solomon his
[40:12] sons saying is not the Lord your God
[40:16] with
[40:17] you and have he not given you rest on
[40:21] every side for he have given you the
[40:23] inhabitants of the land into my hand and
[40:27] into the land to subdue it before the
[40:29] Lord and before his
[40:32] people now look at verse 19 Now set your
[40:37] heart and your soul to seek the Lord
[40:42] your
[40:42] God Arise therefore and build ye the
[40:46] sanctuary of the Lord God to bring the
[40:50] Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and the
[40:52] holy vessels of God into the house that
[40:55] is to be built in the name of the Lord
[40:59] amen God bless you you may be seated I
[41:01] know that was a little bit lengthy of a
[41:03] reading but we wanted to get a little
[41:07] Foundation here we want to minister on
[41:10] waiting on the lord it's a very simple
[41:14] subject um but I think it's worth diving
[41:20] into what does it mean to wait on the
[41:23] Lord sometimes we we pray about 15 20
[41:26] minutes so we call it
[41:28] good cuz we're pretty busy people but we
[41:32] need to learn to hear God's voice spoken
[41:36] to
[41:37] us and sometimes 15 20 minutes don't do
[41:41] it no we've all been doing something and
[41:44] all of a sudden we just heard the voice
[41:46] of God now that happens
[41:49] but that is not how Christians operate
[41:53] only because we've been given
[41:55] instructions by the Lord uh to learn to
[41:59] wait on him and that's what we want to
[42:01] get into one time after Jesus finished
[42:04] praying his disciples asked him to teach
[42:07] us how to pray and I I just love the
[42:10] humility of the request and and he he he
[42:14] shares a few things with he says when
[42:16] you pray don't make sure you you don't
[42:19] pray with the intent of other people
[42:21] hearing you it's between me and you uh
[42:24] don't pray repetitious prayer is the
[42:26] same thing that you just always do every
[42:29] morning um you know so a lot of talking
[42:33] really doesn't make a difference because
[42:35] the father is looking at the intent of
[42:36] the
[42:37] heart okay so and then he says these
[42:40] words in Matthew 6:9 and we're not
[42:42] turning there but he starts off by
[42:45] saying after this manner therefore pray
[42:48] ye so he's teaching the manner and I I
[42:51] believe today what I want to do is get
[42:53] and talk about the manner of what we
[42:55] need to do about waiting on the Lord
[42:59] what it really takes what it really
[43:01] means to wait on the Lord so we're
[43:04] living in such a a confusing complex
[43:08] hour men's hearts are failing for fear
[43:11] there's anxiety all over world every
[43:13] every day there's more bad news just
[43:16] coming and exploding into the minds of
[43:19] people and this is the greatest hour I
[43:22] believe that we should be waiting upon
[43:25] the Lord and and and and learning to do
[43:27] it
[43:29] correctly when Jesus was in The Garden
[43:32] of Gethsemane he found his disciples one
[43:34] time just sleeping on the job and he
[43:37] says what could you not watch with me
[43:40] one hour and he says watch and pray that
[43:43] you enter not into temptation the spirit
[43:47] indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
[43:50] prayer is used to keep us
[43:54] from a wrong spirit coming upon us or
[43:58] from us entering into a wrong Spirit
[44:01] think about that without prayer we're
[44:03] going to miss it because you know our
[44:06] flesh just feels it can handle anything
[44:09] but we notice what happened afterwards
[44:11] they just went crazy right they couldn't
[44:14] handle the situation they all just split
[44:16] up and they were denying that they were
[44:18] Christian and all this all because they
[44:21] didn't take the word more seriously and
[44:23] really
[44:25] pray Jesus speaking of the the time of
[44:29] his return gave us counsel and advice
[44:32] and you Brothers when we were in the
[44:34] meeting I didn't say anything but I was
[44:35] just listening to what you were saying
[44:39] Jesus said in Matthew he said uh but of
[44:42] the day and of the hour no man knoweth
[44:45] know not the angels that are in heaven
[44:48] neither the son but the father and he
[44:51] this is the advice that he
[44:54] gave about you don't know when I'm
[44:56] coming common he says take heed watch
[44:59] and pray for you know not what time it
[45:03] is prayer is what God uses not only to
[45:06] get us ready but to remain
[45:11] ready says take heed be aware look into
[45:14] perceive regard and that word watch
[45:17] means to be
[45:19] Sleepless you know how it feels when you
[45:21] don't get any
[45:23] sleep so it is hard to watch spiritually
[45:28] it means to keep awake brother bam said
[45:30] like this pinch your conscience to
[45:33] always be on guard for the coming of the
[45:38] Lord speaking again of the end time
[45:40] Jesus said in Luke chapter 21 and take
[45:43] heed to yourselves lest any time your
[45:45] hearts be overcharged with surfing and
[45:47] drunkenness basically what this mean is
[45:49] just consuming yourself with the things
[45:51] of the world yes they're just not maybe
[45:54] outright evil evil evil but there could
[45:57] be just so much of it that it just takes
[45:59] you away from from from the coming of
[46:01] the Lord you just kind of learn to get
[46:04] satisfied with living in this life and
[46:07] he said take heed about the cares of
[46:09] this life so that they come upon you
[46:13] unawares for as a snare it shall come
[46:15] upon all them that dwell on the face of
[46:17] the Earth watch ye therefore and pray
[46:21] always that ye may be counted worthy to
[46:25] escape all these things that shall come
[46:26] to to pass and stand before the son of
[46:28] man prayer is what God uses so we can
[46:32] escape the spirit of this age
[46:34] amen so he can say that we're
[46:38] worthy prayer is what is used and you
[46:42] know prayer is one thing that we just
[46:44] don't put a lot of emphasis
[46:48] on now David Knew by
[46:52] Revelation that Solomon was going to
[46:54] build the
[46:55] sanctuary
[46:58] but he told him to
[46:59] wait all his helpers
[47:03] wait he didn't say God chose
[47:07] you you got all these helpers you got
[47:10] all this Talent you got all this wisdom
[47:12] you got all this knowledge you've got
[47:13] plenty of gold plenty of Timber plenty
[47:16] plenty you've got more in abundance I
[47:17] can't even number you got it you got
[47:19] everything that it takes you even God
[47:21] the will of God to go do it but he said
[47:24] don't he said wait
[47:28] the first thing his father told him to
[47:30] do is set your heart and your soul to
[47:34] seek the
[47:37] Lord why is it necessary to pray and
[47:40] seek the Lord if you already know what
[47:42] you should be
[47:43] doing if you know you're supposed to be
[47:46] at church or your post a duty why do you
[47:48] need to
[47:50] pray if you know you're supposed to read
[47:52] your Bible you're you're you're supposed
[47:54] to listen to tapes why do you need to
[47:56] pray first
[48:02] you we're we we miss so much because we
[48:05] don't spend the time with the Lord there
[48:07] is a reason David told the men and told
[48:10] Solomon to wait and seek the Lord first
[48:12] why you've got all the instructions you
[48:14] got all the money you got all the means
[48:16] you got all everything behind you let's
[48:17] go
[48:19] no look at after Jesus with his
[48:22] disciples for for three and a half years
[48:25] trained them how to
[48:27] witness and he said don't you go
[48:29] witnessing until you get me inside of
[48:32] you till you get the Holy Ghost
[48:38] wait now David had more going on in his
[48:41] life than we do can you say so I mean he
[48:44] was the king look at all the battles he
[48:45] shed a lot of
[48:47] blood I'll say he had more adversity
[48:50] than what we do he had more trouble than
[48:55] we do he had more enemies he had more
[48:57] problems he had more responsibilities
[48:59] than we
[49:01] did yet David said behold in my trouble
[49:05] I have prepared for the house of the
[49:09] Lord in the midst of everything he had
[49:12] going he still prepared for the house of
[49:14] the
[49:15] Lord troubles or problems in his life
[49:18] didn't hinder David from preparing for
[49:21] church a lack of time didn't hinder him
[49:25] from preparing for church
[49:27] I just
[49:29] wonder if we've been able to prepare
[49:32] ourselves for the house of the
[49:40] Lord you know sometimes we just we make
[49:45] excuses hey you're lucky that I even
[49:47] made it here
[49:50] today I love that this is in there that
[49:54] no matter what the trouble was
[49:57] David made time to
[50:00] prepare he had a heart for God he had a
[50:03] heart to be in in in the house of God
[50:07] Psalms 27:4 we've read this before one
[50:09] time one thing if I desired of the Lord
[50:11] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[50:15] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[50:16] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[50:18] and to inquire in his Temple look at
[50:21] verse 5 for in the time of trouble he
[50:25] shall hide me in his pilion and you
[50:27] don't go to church when it's convenient
[50:29] when everything's going good and you
[50:31] know you got all this
[50:33] time you go when there's trouble because
[50:36] God has a word for you God wants to help
[50:39] you in the
[50:40] situation in the secret of his
[50:43] Tabernacle shall he hide me for He Shall
[50:45] Set me upon a a rock and I'll tell you
[50:49] when God speaks to you that's the rock
[50:51] that is The Rock when he speaks just one
[50:53] word to you you stand on that
[50:58] because the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[51:01] against
[51:03] that a lot of times when
[51:06] churchgoers get some adversity they
[51:08] decide to miss
[51:10] church but not David for in a time of
[51:13] trouble he shall hide me in his
[51:17] Pavilion David knew where to go when
[51:19] there was
[51:21] trouble not what one thing I like about
[51:25] this is that
[51:27] David this shows that David never
[51:32] tried to handle his problems on his own
[51:36] didn't try to handle adversity and
[51:39] trouble and things on his own he he knew
[51:43] he was no match for the devil that was
[51:45] behind the
[51:47] troubles right he didn't say well you
[51:49] know I'm just going to handle
[51:53] it no matter how much God has blessed us
[51:56] we need God for everything we need to
[51:59] keep God first in our
[52:01] life and that's what that's that's what
[52:04] God
[52:06] wants he knew there was a word for him
[52:08] at church I'm just going to read a a
[52:11] bunch of Psalms if I could do that I'm
[52:13] just trying to set the foundation of of
[52:17] David here he says my soul melteth for
[52:21] heaviness strengthen thou me according
[52:25] unto Thy Word word amen the word is what
[52:29] gives us strength right this is all you
[52:32] find all these verses I'm going to read
[52:33] in Psalms 19 if you want to read it
[52:35] sometime he says I am Afflicted very
[52:38] much Quicken me oh Lord according unto
[52:42] Thy word thou art my Hiding Place and my
[52:45] shield I hope in thy word you can see
[52:48] why he really wanted to get to
[52:51] church he really wanted to get into the
[52:54] Tabernacle he said consider my
[52:56] Affliction and deliver me for I do not
[53:00] forget thy law plead my cause and
[53:03] Deliver Me Quicken me according to Thy
[53:06] word Let My Cry come near before thee Oh
[53:09] Lord give me understanding according to
[53:12] Thy word give me understanding according
[53:15] to Thy
[53:16] word let me let my supplication come
[53:20] before thee deliver me according to Thy
[53:23] word all according to the word of God I
[53:26] Rejoice at Thy word as one that findeth
[53:29] great
[53:30] spoil in other words we have found in
[53:33] this age that people come to church for
[53:35] the wrong
[53:38] reasons and just just cut out this
[53:41] church here for a second but just show
[53:42] you to the extreme they have kicked
[53:44] Jesus out of the church and they brought
[53:46] entertainment in because that's what the
[53:48] people
[53:50] want and if the people come I can get
[53:53] money and and then we can do things with
[53:55] the money yeah and God the word of God
[53:59] isn't even lifted
[54:02] up and and and and and we get this idea
[54:06] of what we think you know we get
[54:08] especially this you know we get our our
[54:10] our our our certain type of preaching
[54:12] right a certain type of a preacher and
[54:15] and we like that and we then we just
[54:17] start to we model this is what the
[54:19] message
[54:22] is and if we're not getting that well
[54:25] then what's the use of coming to church
[54:26] last time brother darl Ward was here and
[54:28] he was just sharing some of the stuff
[54:29] that's going out in the in the message
[54:33] world and sharing how you know some of
[54:37] the the the ministry is is saying that
[54:40] if it's not happening this way you got
[54:41] to get out of that
[54:43] church excuse me you know I guess I'm
[54:46] not mentioning any names it's okay but
[54:48] it's showing what's going
[54:51] on but you know God's a god of
[54:55] variety he does have a fivefold Ministry
[54:57] and I'll tell you the thing is it's your
[54:59] faith in the word it's your relationship
[55:03] with the
[55:04] word and we got to get to the place
[55:06] where God I don't know how you're going
[55:08] to speak to me I don't know who it's
[55:10] going to come through but as long as you
[55:13] speak to me that's all I need and we got
[55:17] to start coming to church with that in
[55:19] mind the word is a lamp unto my feet and
[55:23] a light unto my path David knew that
[55:27] just one word spoken to him was all that
[55:30] he was going to need to make it
[55:34] through but what about
[55:36] today people don't endure sound
[55:42] Doctrine they want church for their
[55:47] flesh they should want it for their
[55:50] soul there's a big
[55:53] difference David said in Psalms 9 have
[55:56] mercy Mery upon me oh Lord and consider
[55:58] my
[55:59] trouble which I suffer of them that hate
[56:02] me thou that liftest me up from the
[56:04] gates of death said but I will sing of
[56:07] thy power and I will sing aloud of thy
[56:09] mercy in the morning for thou has been
[56:12] my defense and my refuge in the day of
[56:15] trouble unto thee Oh My Oh My Strength
[56:19] will I sing for God is my defense and
[56:22] God is my
[56:24] Mercy I mean if you got a revel
[56:26] of who God is and what the word is why
[56:30] wouldn't you just long to come to church
[56:32] and get one word from him get away from
[56:35] these feelings and Sensations and all
[56:37] these things that you got to see with
[56:38] these other senses and get in tune from
[56:41] the inside and and connect with God in
[56:44] your heart and
[56:45] soul I think this is one reason we
[56:48] really I believe it's important to get
[56:51] into this this great topic today when
[56:54] Trouble Comes our way we need to prepare
[56:57] our
[56:58] hearts because our hearts is a sanctuary
[57:03] for
[57:04] God right we've got the church right but
[57:07] now we got our vessels we are the
[57:10] church and it this has got to get
[57:13] prepared but we just can't just you know
[57:15] oh I think I should do this and I think
[57:17] I should do that no we got to learn to
[57:19] wait on God to seek
[57:22] him listen for that
[57:25] voice
[57:26] 1 Corinthians 6:19 says know ye not that
[57:29] your body is the Temple of the Holy
[57:31] Ghost which is in you which ye are of
[57:34] God and you're not your own for you're
[57:36] bought with a price therefore glorify
[57:39] God in your body and in your spirit
[57:42] which are
[57:45] Gods I think sometimes we want to meet
[57:47] God on our
[57:48] terms we want to fit God into our time
[57:54] slot however our ude maybe at the time
[57:57] this is the time I got this is the time
[57:59] I'm allowing you know I got a busy day I
[58:01] got a lot going on and and
[58:04] and and I do believe that if you are
[58:08] spending time with God Faithfully every
[58:12] day and that happens one day I believe
[58:15] it's okay and God will still meet you
[58:18] because you've been faithful all the
[58:20] other
[58:21] days but if you're if you're if you're
[58:23] not careful that becomes your excuse
[58:26] excuse of why you're not waiting upon
[58:33] him God bought
[58:36] us he we belong to him it is our
[58:39] responsibility to make time for
[58:42] him think about God created this whole
[58:45] world all the animals and everything
[58:46] without
[58:47] us he didn't need our
[58:50] help he didn't need our time or help or
[58:53] anything and he did
[58:55] it I I think we need to realize we need
[58:58] God a little bit more to give him that
[59:01] respect of spending time with
[59:03] him now God's desire is to have the
[59:07] preeminence inside of
[59:08] us so we must come to God and meet his
[59:14] terms we must learn
[59:16] to to walk with
[59:19] him to let him be preeminent inside of
[59:22] our thoughts and our
[59:23] minds and that it makes a difference
[59:26] every day that goes by we got to give an
[59:29] account to God for that day what did we
[59:33] do in our minds what do we do in our
[59:34] heart what did we do with our Deeds we
[59:37] we've got to get away from this um
[59:40] modern Church world only thing that
[59:42] matters is just going to church twice a
[59:46] week or I'm safe now because I'm in the
[59:49] message what we we got to be thinking
[59:51] about God's supposed to be using this
[59:53] vessel what does he want me to do today
[59:58] Galatians 5:17 says for the flesh
[1:00:01] lusteth against the spirit and the
[1:00:03] spirit against the flesh so this is that
[1:00:05] white dog and and black dog and these
[1:00:08] are contrary one to another so that they
[1:00:10] cannot do the things that they
[1:00:13] would but if you bite and devour one
[1:00:16] another take heed that you be not
[1:00:18] consumed one another how many's ever
[1:00:19] done that
[1:00:21] before howy doesn't want to participate
[1:00:23] in this uh this
[1:00:27] questioner this I say then walk in the
[1:00:30] spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[1:00:32] lust of the flesh you notice when we get
[1:00:35] in a habit not a h hope it doesn't
[1:00:37] become a habit but when we get in the
[1:00:40] flesh and we start this fighting with
[1:00:42] with with
[1:00:43] someone you notice the thing that we're
[1:00:47] thinking is that we're having this fight
[1:00:49] because of
[1:00:51] you we never say the reason um I just
[1:00:54] want you to know right now right now the
[1:00:56] reason we're not we're having this fight
[1:00:58] right now is because I chose not to walk
[1:00:59] in the
[1:01:01] spirit which is the true that's what the
[1:01:03] word
[1:01:06] says this word is what we need the thing
[1:01:09] is if our heart is not wanting the word
[1:01:12] we come to church it becomes
[1:01:15] boring it takes a great effort to keep
[1:01:18] the flesh dead in order for us to walk
[1:01:20] in the spirit it requires a lot of
[1:01:22] prayer a lot of crucifying the flesh
[1:01:24] waiting on the Lord
[1:01:26] we must remember to wait on the
[1:01:30] Lord get back to a dedicated prayer
[1:01:35] life what does it mean to wait on the
[1:01:37] Lord too often Believers will wait on
[1:01:40] the Lord like they do at the doctor's
[1:01:43] office just go on there and sit wait for
[1:01:45] your name to be
[1:01:49] called eventually it's going to be
[1:01:51] called you don't have to do nothing just
[1:01:52] sit there you read any magazine you want
[1:01:54] do whatever you want and play in your
[1:01:56] phone you literally even get upset and
[1:01:59] bothered because you had to wait too
[1:02:02] long and they'll still call your name
[1:02:05] they'll still come and get
[1:02:07] you and that's how sometimes Believers
[1:02:11] think it is when they wait on God that
[1:02:14] he's just going to show up Don't Matter
[1:02:16] What attitude you
[1:02:18] have there appointment I got an
[1:02:23] appointment turn with me to Isaiah
[1:02:25] chapter 40 verse
[1:02:27] 25 so we're going to get into this
[1:02:30] waiting upon the Lord you know brother
[1:02:34] baham said God is hidden
[1:02:37] Simplicity amen it's not complexed it's
[1:02:41] simple Isaiah 40:25 says to whom then
[1:02:45] will you liken
[1:02:47] me or shall I be equal sayith the Holy
[1:02:51] One lift up your eyes on high and be
[1:02:56] hold who have created these things that
[1:02:59] bring out their host be by number he
[1:03:03] calleth them all by names by the
[1:03:05] greatness of his
[1:03:07] might for that he is strong in power and
[1:03:11] not one fail think about this eclipse
[1:03:14] and the
[1:03:15] sun the sun just doesn't
[1:03:18] fail well where did that all come
[1:03:22] from what about all the stars that are
[1:03:25] Shining that Northstar is still there
[1:03:27] the one that
[1:03:28] the uh the Wise Men
[1:03:31] followed I mean God has
[1:03:35] power he has
[1:03:37] power for
[1:03:40] us why sayest thou oh Jacob and speakest
[1:03:44] oh Israel my way is hid from the Lord
[1:03:47] and my judgment passeth over from my God
[1:03:50] hast thou not known has thou not heard
[1:03:52] that the Everlasting God the Lord the
[1:03:54] Creator the ends of the Earth fainteth
[1:03:56] not neither is weary there is no
[1:03:58] searching of his understanding he giveth
[1:04:01] power to the
[1:04:03] faint and to them that have no might he
[1:04:07] increases
[1:04:10] strength and then he gives this example
[1:04:13] we all seen this even the youth shall
[1:04:17] faint and be weary and the young men
[1:04:20] shall utterly fall I mean young men
[1:04:23] having heart
[1:04:24] attacks you know we can only go so far I
[1:04:27] mean I would love to be young again I'm
[1:04:30] wondering what I would do
[1:04:33] different but even
[1:04:36] young run out of strength at some
[1:04:40] time but they that wait upon the
[1:04:44] Lord shall renew their strength they
[1:04:47] shall Mount up with wings as Eagles and
[1:04:50] they shall run and they shall not be
[1:04:53] weary and they shall walk and they shall
[1:04:55] not faint now that's because God is
[1:04:59] giving the person who Waits on him
[1:05:05] strength all we got to do is wait that's
[1:05:09] a pretty good
[1:05:10] deal I don't got to figure out a way to
[1:05:13] get the
[1:05:15] strength I don't got to invent
[1:05:19] it all I got to do is wait on him but I
[1:05:22] can't wait like I'm in the doctor's
[1:05:25] office
[1:05:26] I can't just wait for him to kind of
[1:05:29] show
[1:05:33] up waiting upon the Lord can feel real
[1:05:37] difficult at
[1:05:41] times sometimes the Lord feels close and
[1:05:44] other
[1:05:45] times you're actually just left with
[1:05:49] wondering was he even there did he show
[1:05:54] up did the time that I just spend in
[1:05:56] prayer did it Avail anything or did it
[1:05:59] just appease my conscience because I was
[1:06:01] supposed to
[1:06:04] pray we left wondering should I prayed
[1:06:11] longer waiting upon the
[1:06:13] [Music]
[1:06:14] Lord is not like waiting for a certain
[1:06:17] time to show up like an
[1:06:20] appointment dinner Church to start
[1:06:24] or the eclipse the solar eclipse we were
[1:06:28] waiting for the time it was going to
[1:06:31] happen we heard about this weeks
[1:06:34] ago and then Monday came and we thought
[1:06:38] about
[1:06:41] it it just happened but we can't wait on
[1:06:44] the Lord like that we can't have that
[1:06:46] kind of thinking that's not what he's
[1:06:47] meaning that's not going to give you
[1:06:50] strength going and sit in the room all
[1:06:52] day just wait for him to show up so you
[1:06:55] can have strength it's not going to work
[1:06:57] like
[1:07:03] that waiting upon the Lord is completely
[1:07:08] different when we're waiting for
[1:07:10] something in this life we don't have to
[1:07:12] do anything except
[1:07:16] wait what I mean is simply
[1:07:19] like I had to meet the um the Livingston
[1:07:24] County Health Department here this week
[1:07:26] and and uh I was supposed to meet him
[1:07:29] here at 1:30 and I I was here and he
[1:07:34] wasn't here at
[1:07:35] 1:30 but I knew he was going to show
[1:07:42] up but that isn't how you wait on the
[1:07:45] Lord he don't have to show
[1:07:50] up he don't have to show up because you
[1:07:52] want him to show
[1:07:54] up
[1:08:00] God doesn't move according to our time
[1:08:04] schedule he has his own time
[1:08:07] schedule the Bible tells us and we sing
[1:08:10] about it God does
[1:08:11] everything beautiful in his time his
[1:08:17] time when we're waiting on the Lord for
[1:08:19] strength it isn't like going through the
[1:08:21] drive-thru at Tim Horton's give me my
[1:08:24] medium with three creams
[1:08:26] you know sometimes I go there they just
[1:08:28] say pull forward they don't even let me
[1:08:35] talk did you ever have to wait in line a
[1:08:37] long
[1:08:42] time and then even Grumble about a
[1:08:46] little
[1:08:47] bit your flesh isn't going to like
[1:08:50] waiting on the Lord
[1:08:54] then because if we're bothered having to
[1:08:57] wait to get our food at the
[1:09:00] restaurant hey Sunday we had to wait a
[1:09:02] while to get that food it was like
[1:09:03] consciously a long
[1:09:07] time and if that bothers
[1:09:10] you then waiting on the Lord the way he
[1:09:13] wants is going to really bother your
[1:09:17] flesh and all we're doing is we're
[1:09:19] trying to understand that it takes more
[1:09:22] than just giving God what we want to
[1:09:25] give
[1:09:26] them and then we wonder why we don't
[1:09:28] have strength to spiritually lay down
[1:09:32] our life the next
[1:09:34] day I mean
[1:09:36] we ought to be to a place of having a
[1:09:40] relationship with God that when we get
[1:09:42] in prayer we hear from
[1:09:45] God we literally hear from him we get
[1:09:49] strength to obey the word we get
[1:09:51] strength to to to to make right our
[1:09:55] wrongs to to to move forward to die out
[1:09:58] to to because we're
[1:10:00] preparing the vessel the sanctuary for
[1:10:03] the ark to come in which is which is God
[1:10:06] to come
[1:10:08] inside and all the great blessings that
[1:10:10] come with the Holy
[1:10:14] Ghost when we wait on the Lord we're
[1:10:17] preparing our Tabernacle for him and
[1:10:20] this is the best way to look at this
[1:10:23] when you truly wait on the Lord
[1:10:25] you're preparing your Tabernacle for him
[1:10:28] so how do you prepare
[1:10:33] yourself we want when the Lord shows up
[1:10:36] you're happy I don't care if you're
[1:10:39] crying or not you're happy there's
[1:10:44] joy Psalm 1611 said in thy presence is
[1:10:48] fullness of
[1:10:49] joy Nehemiah 8:10 says for the joy of
[1:10:53] the Lord is your strength
[1:10:55] so the very fact that God shows up in
[1:10:58] your prayer
[1:11:00] time that he shows up will renew your
[1:11:05] strength but without
[1:11:08] it we're on our own trying to figure it
[1:11:11] out trying to get others
[1:11:13] trouble how do we prepare our human
[1:11:17] Tabernacle for
[1:11:18] him you're coming into the presence of
[1:11:21] the Lord and he's coming into you
[1:11:26] when we come into His presence we need
[1:11:28] to remember what he
[1:11:31] requires what does it require when we
[1:11:33] come into His
[1:11:35] presence well what happens just think
[1:11:37] about the Tabernacle here I will enter
[1:11:39] his gates with Thanksgiving I come into
[1:11:42] his his courts with praise if if you're
[1:11:45] going to come into church and you're
[1:11:46] going to be like a a bump on the
[1:11:49] log don't expect God to bless you
[1:11:53] spiritually because you're not giv
[1:11:55] giving God an offering a praise
[1:11:58] offering sometimes we act like God is is
[1:12:01] not worthy of a great praise
[1:12:04] offering we do you know how we act like
[1:12:06] that when we don't give it to
[1:12:09] them we're making a statement he's not
[1:12:12] worthy you think you're making a
[1:12:15] statement I don't feel good today I'm
[1:12:18] going through a trial you don't know
[1:12:19] nothing about it you may be thinking
[1:12:23] that but what you're really doing is
[1:12:24] saying God is not worthy of my praise
[1:12:27] and my
[1:12:29] troubles David
[1:12:31] prepared for the
[1:12:34] sanctuary for God to come
[1:12:37] in we need to as
[1:12:40] well we want to prepare ourselves before
[1:12:44] we get here I like with that one brother
[1:12:46] he said uh and I don't know which
[1:12:49] brother it was and please forgive me but
[1:12:51] it was a brother that was just preaching
[1:12:52] here not not long ago and he said uh you
[1:12:58] know people get
[1:13:00] excited uh they get excited to go to the
[1:13:03] ball games and and uh you've heard of
[1:13:06] tailgating right they'll go there hours
[1:13:10] before to tailgate the game hasn't even
[1:13:12] started maybe the players didn't even
[1:13:13] show up yet I don't know they just get
[1:13:14] there pretty
[1:13:15] early and they're actually
[1:13:19] prepared before the game starts to get
[1:13:22] in
[1:13:24] tune and I think that's how David was
[1:13:26] about getting into
[1:13:28] church he couldn't wait for the doors to
[1:13:30] be open he couldn't wait to get there
[1:13:33] because he saw there was a real value
[1:13:37] there at church a real
[1:13:42] value we got to get
[1:13:45] excited we got to praise the
[1:13:48] lord we got to create an
[1:13:52] atmosphere for the one who created all
[1:13:56] things so we come with our praise
[1:13:59] offering we enter the gates with
[1:14:02] Thanksgiving I want when you're waiting
[1:14:04] on the
[1:14:05] Lord give him a praise offering
[1:14:08] first forget about what you're going
[1:14:10] through forget about what you think's
[1:14:12] important to you and if I could just say
[1:14:15] this with a little bit of respect God
[1:14:17] help me here if I'm wrong hey look every
[1:14:19] time we come to the Lord in prayer we've
[1:14:22] got
[1:14:24] sin
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:14:27] right give him
[1:14:30] praise worship Him Praise Him your your
[1:14:35] sin your your apology and your sincerity
[1:14:38] of asking forgiveness will be so much
[1:14:41] more
[1:14:45] real and so like I said I'm I'm just
[1:14:48] saying after this manner okay I'm just
[1:14:51] after this that's all I'm doing I'm not
[1:14:53] trying to Jesus J didn't say pray this
[1:14:56] Our Father s he said after this
[1:14:59] manner I just think you know we leave
[1:15:01] out the praise or we wait till the end
[1:15:03] to say thank you and the thing is he he
[1:15:05] he deserves uh uh you're this is the
[1:15:08] church we sing the song enter I will
[1:15:11] enter his gates with Thanksgiving I'll
[1:15:12] enter his courts with praise well when
[1:15:13] you're in your prayer closet and you're
[1:15:16] you're you're making ready you're
[1:15:18] preparing the temple for him to come
[1:15:20] into you've got to do the same
[1:15:23] thing you've got to praise him and you
[1:15:27] got to praise him more than you feel
[1:15:29] like it don't be the
[1:15:31] judge don't be the
[1:15:33] judge give him always give him more than
[1:15:36] what you feel because number one your
[1:15:38] flesh Don't Want To Praise Him and I'm
[1:15:39] gonna tell you why it's too
[1:15:42] proud it's arrogant it thinks it don't
[1:15:46] have to because God knows your
[1:15:50] heart look God is worthy to be praised
[1:15:54] and this is what it requires if you God
[1:15:57] inhabits the Praises of his people so
[1:16:00] why wouldn't you want to praise them
[1:16:01] you're you're you want his presence to
[1:16:04] come so you have strength in your
[1:16:06] troubles all right so when we come we
[1:16:09] want to come with
[1:16:11] humility I think sometimes we come to
[1:16:13] God with an attitude like it or not here
[1:16:15] I am this is all you're
[1:16:18] getting I'm down in the dubs and you're
[1:16:20] just going to have to live with
[1:16:23] it sometimes we don't feel a need to
[1:16:28] Humble ourselves
[1:16:32] anymore I understand a lot of times when
[1:16:34] we come to God we absolutely feel
[1:16:36] terrible I understand that but God will
[1:16:40] not accept some
[1:16:42] excuse like I'm not feeling
[1:16:45] good so we don't have to Humble
[1:16:49] oursel you've got to press through all
[1:16:51] the garbage press through humble
[1:16:54] yourself
[1:16:55] for God's presence because you know just
[1:16:58] think about
[1:17:00] it God is not going to come and just zap
[1:17:03] your problem out of your life like a bug
[1:17:08] zapper he's not going to do that but he
[1:17:11] will give you strength to go through
[1:17:13] it and that's what we're coming in to
[1:17:17] his presence for is for strength so we
[1:17:20] can get up and face this thing and be an
[1:17:22] overcomer trust him that he's going to
[1:17:24] take is
[1:17:27] through God resisteth the proud but he
[1:17:30] gives grace to the humble so we come to
[1:17:33] him with clothes of humility we're
[1:17:36] wearing those clothes because he said a
[1:17:39] humble and contrite spirit I'll not
[1:17:42] despise you have that I'm
[1:17:44] there you're not going to be the only
[1:17:47] one that he doesn't come
[1:17:49] to nobody about to stand before him on
[1:17:52] the day of judgment and said you didn't
[1:17:54] keep your word God keeps his
[1:17:56] word God don't have to change and I be
[1:17:59] honest with you I don't want God to
[1:18:01] change for me I am Unworthy of his
[1:18:03] presence every single time he comes I
[1:18:07] Feel So Unworthy and I'm willing to wait
[1:18:10] do whatever I got to do for him to
[1:18:13] come but I'm going to say this if we
[1:18:17] want our lives better we want to be a
[1:18:22] closer walk with God we're going to have
[1:18:25] to learn to spend more times more
[1:18:31] often with spending time with him in
[1:18:34] prayer learning to wait the way he wants
[1:18:37] us to
[1:18:38] wait when we come and we're waiting on
[1:18:41] the Lord we need to have a Zeal to
[1:18:44] repent a
[1:18:46] Zeal can you imagine a Zeal you seen
[1:18:48] somebody with a
[1:18:49] Zeal they just seem to be happy
[1:18:52] passionate they're putting their energy
[1:18:54] in to it they're doing a good job with
[1:18:58] it they're not well you know I'm kind of
[1:19:01] sorry you
[1:19:03] know be zous and
[1:19:06] repent choose this day which side you're
[1:19:10] on as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:19:13] chasten be zalias therefore and repent
[1:19:17] Hebrews 12:5 says and ye have forgotten
[1:19:20] the exhortation which speaketh unto you
[1:19:23] as unto children my son despise not the
[1:19:27] chasing of the Lord nor faint when thou
[1:19:30] art rebuked of
[1:19:33] him you know I'd rather be in God's
[1:19:35] presence and get
[1:19:37] rebuked than to be out of his presence
[1:19:41] and not get
[1:19:44] rebuked it's scary it's scary outside of
[1:19:46] God's presence there's no refuge there's
[1:19:50] no Comfort there's no peace there's no
[1:19:52] joy you don't got love to love your
[1:19:54] enemies it's a horrible thing to be out
[1:19:56] of the presence of God it's a fearful
[1:19:59] thing to fall in the hands of a living
[1:20:02] God so when we come we need to come to
[1:20:05] God seeking the face of
[1:20:11] God this is really what I want to get
[1:20:14] into for the last 15 minutes here
[1:20:16] seeking the face of God psalms 27 says
[1:20:20] therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle
[1:20:25] sacrifices of
[1:20:26] Joy praise God when's the last time
[1:20:29] we've offered sacrifices of
[1:20:32] Joy see amariah she's she's offering one
[1:20:36] right now it's a sacrifice of Joy I will
[1:20:40] sing yay I will sing praises unto the
[1:20:42] Lord here oh Lord when I cry with my
[1:20:46] voice have mercy also upon me and answer
[1:20:49] me when thou sest seek ye my face my
[1:20:53] heart said unto thee thy face Lord will
[1:20:58] I
[1:21:00] Seek You know sometimes I I just let me
[1:21:03] just ask this question when was the last
[1:21:05] time you literally heard God tell you
[1:21:09] seek his
[1:21:12] face like what's the
[1:21:15] purpose what's the
[1:21:19] purpose David was King he had
[1:21:22] everything but God want wanted him to
[1:21:25] seek his
[1:21:27] face this is part of waiting on the Lord
[1:21:31] this is part of getting strength because
[1:21:33] he's crying Lord help me help me answer
[1:21:36] me help me with my troubles I I I'm
[1:21:39] crying out to you with my voice and God
[1:21:41] just
[1:21:42] says when you told me to seek your face
[1:21:45] my heart just said I'm going to do
[1:21:47] it I'm not going to get beat over the
[1:21:49] head I'm not going to wait till I got
[1:21:51] everything caught up my taxes are paid I
[1:21:54] all
[1:21:57] this is the day this is the hour to be
[1:21:59] so close to God that whatever he says we
[1:22:02] just do
[1:22:04] it the flesh doesn't find it easy or
[1:22:07] comfortable to seek the
[1:22:10] Lord fact a lot of times when we pray
[1:22:12] it's
[1:22:12] uncomfortable because the flesh don't
[1:22:14] want to be
[1:22:17] there uh for the if I could say this for
[1:22:19] the most part why haven't we had many
[1:22:23] people come to the altar lately
[1:22:26] remember how the people used to come to
[1:22:27] the altar at the before at the beginning
[1:22:30] people were coming all the
[1:22:33] time after a while it's just not
[1:22:37] fun come on I'm I'm just being honest
[1:22:40] You' be honest with me
[1:22:41] too it's not comfortable to pray but we
[1:22:45] still need to do it amen it hurts to
[1:22:47] crucify the flesh it's it's hard to
[1:22:50] Humble ourselves under the mighty hand
[1:22:51] of God it's so much easier to say I'm a
[1:22:53] Christian and I'm humble
[1:22:55] I'm already under the hand of God God's
[1:22:57] already with
[1:22:59] me and
[1:23:06] it by us spending more time in prayer it
[1:23:10] gives God a
[1:23:11] chance to deal with us inside because we
[1:23:15] hear outside we hear outside but we need
[1:23:19] to get
[1:23:20] still we need to get still be still and
[1:23:24] know I am God he wants us to know him he
[1:23:28] wants us to know what he wants us to do
[1:23:30] he wants to give us instructions of how
[1:23:33] to help the Tabernacle that he has made
[1:23:36] a decision with you a covenant with you
[1:23:40] to live inside of you through eternity
[1:23:42] now that's not your
[1:23:48] flesh and let me just say this it's not
[1:23:52] just the Tabernacle that he has waiting
[1:23:54] for you
[1:23:55] you then what is it brother John it's
[1:23:58] the character that you're molding right
[1:24:00] now on this planet brother Bram said
[1:24:03] that's the only thing you're taking with
[1:24:05] you and you have a chance to build
[1:24:08] character by getting more real with God
[1:24:11] instead of just trying to skip by with
[1:24:13] you know what feels good to you fall in
[1:24:16] love with him maybe there's something
[1:24:17] more he wants you to
[1:24:19] do praise the
[1:24:22] Lord Psalms 104 says the wicked through
[1:24:26] the pride of his countenance he will not
[1:24:29] seek after God for God is not in all his
[1:24:34] thoughts so it requires humility and
[1:24:37] determination to press through the flesh
[1:24:39] into the presence of
[1:24:41] God I believe there's a reward for
[1:24:43] pressing beyond our carnal
[1:24:46] flesh why should God give the True
[1:24:49] Believer who Waits on him
[1:24:52] strength why should he give that to the
[1:24:54] same person who's unwilling to wait on
[1:24:56] him so there's a reward for those who
[1:25:00] wait on the
[1:25:02] Lord one time Jesus told a woman that
[1:25:05] she didn't know what she was even
[1:25:07] worshiping you know in John 4 but the
[1:25:11] hour cometh and now is when the true
[1:25:13] worshippers shall worship the father in
[1:25:15] spirit and in truth for the father is
[1:25:18] seeking such to worship
[1:25:20] him now God is a spirit and they that
[1:25:24] worship him they must do it the right
[1:25:28] way must be in spirit and it must be in
[1:25:31] truth well how do I know I'm there care
[1:25:34] enough care enough keep going you'll
[1:25:38] know you're doing it right when his
[1:25:39] presence
[1:25:41] [Laughter]
[1:25:43] comes come on he's a rewarder to them
[1:25:47] that diligently seek
[1:25:50] Him waiting is not waiting waiting is
[1:25:55] pressing into the spirit of God where
[1:25:57] he's at amen there is a difference
[1:26:00] waiting in office is like this you could
[1:26:02] just wait all day tomorrow I'm going to
[1:26:04] go on then in the morning I'm going to
[1:26:05] be there at 7 o'clock I'm going to go in
[1:26:07] the office and I'm going to give my
[1:26:11] blood just to find out what's wrong with
[1:26:13] it that's
[1:26:16] all and I'm gonna wait and it's going to
[1:26:19] happen I'm going to get the big
[1:26:21] needle but you know you just can't go
[1:26:24] into the prayer room and just sit
[1:26:27] there waiting on God is not like waiting
[1:26:32] like we
[1:26:33] wait we ought to be up and doing like he
[1:26:36] told them be up and
[1:26:39] doing labor to enter into the presence
[1:26:42] of the
[1:26:43] Lord Psalms 34:10 says the Lions do lack
[1:26:48] the Young Lions do lack and they suffer
[1:26:50] hunger but they that seek the Lord shall
[1:26:54] not want any good thing look at that
[1:26:58] some a blessing comes from seeking the
[1:27:00] Lord
[1:27:02] enough shall not want any good thing I
[1:27:06] believe you're going to have
[1:27:07] it amen that that's scripture I didn't
[1:27:10] write it I didn't make that
[1:27:11] up you know if you're if you're doubting
[1:27:14] this you're not doubting me you're
[1:27:15] doubting the the
[1:27:17] word Come Ye children hearken unto me
[1:27:19] and I will teach you the fear of the
[1:27:21] Lord I think that's one thing that God
[1:27:23] wants to do when we get down and we stay
[1:27:27] there long enough labor to enter in God
[1:27:30] wants to teach us how to respect him
[1:27:33] more how to reverence him more we may
[1:27:37] think we do and we do always when we're
[1:27:40] comparing oursel with somebody that
[1:27:42] doesn't do it
[1:27:44] enough but you know the bride is going
[1:27:47] to be such a special
[1:27:49] people God wants to commune with us he
[1:27:52] wants to speak to our hearts
[1:27:54] he wants us to hear that still Small
[1:27:57] Voice he wants to teach us to respect
[1:28:00] him more to fill us with more of his
[1:28:03] Spirit Luke 11:9 says and I say unto you
[1:28:07] ask and it shall be given you seek and
[1:28:10] you shall find knock and it shall be
[1:28:12] open unto you now that word ask when you
[1:28:16] ask if I'm going to go to you and I'm
[1:28:18] going to ask you can
[1:28:22] I please please um borrow your Bible or
[1:28:27] can I
[1:28:29] please have a dollar for a coffee I'm
[1:28:33] I'm gonna ask but this word ask isn't
[1:28:35] like that this word if you look it up it
[1:28:39] means
[1:28:40] beg it means
[1:28:43] crave it means
[1:28:45] require call
[1:28:48] for it's I won't take no for an
[1:28:53] answer that word seek it means to
[1:28:56] worship after look it up it means to
[1:28:58] worship how many times do we wait on the
[1:29:01] Lord we're seeking him but we just don't
[1:29:03] want to worship see we're not we're not
[1:29:07] doing what we need to be doing according
[1:29:09] to the scriptures so we're searching the
[1:29:11] scriptures
[1:29:14] tonight we're knocking can you imagine
[1:29:18] knocking okay you somebody comes over to
[1:29:22] your house and they knock on the door
[1:29:26] they're coming over for dinner but they
[1:29:27] don't want to barge in they're knocking
[1:29:28] on the
[1:29:29] door what are they doing that they're
[1:29:31] trying to get your
[1:29:33] attention and they're and and and here's
[1:29:36] the thing we want God to come into us
[1:29:39] and we want to come into God so we're
[1:29:42] knocking Lord hear me I'm
[1:29:47] knocking we've gotten away from Biblical
[1:29:51] calling on the name of the Lord and then
[1:29:55] we don't really get into his presence
[1:29:57] and we don't feel him and then we just
[1:29:59] walk out just
[1:30:01] a in the form of godliness trying to
[1:30:04] handle life and all of our problems
[1:30:05] trying to be a a religious
[1:30:10] person I just I want him inside of me so
[1:30:14] bad we've got to be willing to do
[1:30:17] whatever it takes for everyone that
[1:30:20] askthe findeth and to him that knocketh
[1:30:23] it shall shall be
[1:30:25] open see that's the promise if it ain't
[1:30:29] happening keep asking keep seeking keep
[1:30:32] knocking because the word of God cannot
[1:30:35] you know think about this how many
[1:30:37] people have actually spent time with God
[1:30:41] asking seeking
[1:30:43] knocking and God didn't show up God
[1:30:46] didn't give them what they want and they
[1:30:48] literally called God a
[1:30:52] liar but we know God it is impossible
[1:30:55] for God to
[1:30:57] lie we have to conclude that that person
[1:31:00] did not meet the requirement because God
[1:31:02] can't fail they must have failed that's
[1:31:06] why when we spend time with them we've
[1:31:08] got to be clothed with
[1:31:09] humility because because we can't
[1:31:11] entertain those
[1:31:14] thoughts if a son shall ask bread of any
[1:31:17] of you that is a father will he give him
[1:31:19] a stone if he ask for fish will for a
[1:31:22] fish give him a serpent or for uh or if
[1:31:26] he shall ask an egg shall he give shall
[1:31:29] offer a scorpion if ye then be evil know
[1:31:31] how to give good gifts to your children
[1:31:33] how much more shall your heavenly father
[1:31:35] give you the holy give the Holy Ghost to
[1:31:38] them that ask
[1:31:40] him you think about it we're sitting at
[1:31:43] the dinner table and I say could you
[1:31:47] please pass me the the pepper we do that
[1:31:50] a lot at our table because we like
[1:31:52] pepper I ask the pepper
[1:31:56] comes but that's not how you ask the
[1:32:00] Lord now I know it's as simple as it is
[1:32:05] as simple as that but we don't know if
[1:32:09] God wants something out of
[1:32:12] us that's the whole purpose of waiting
[1:32:14] on
[1:32:18] him about
[1:32:22] this a person come to the Altar and
[1:32:24] offers their gift to the
[1:32:27] Lord and God's like well this is a
[1:32:29] wonderful thing you're giving me this
[1:32:31] this gift you're offering me yourself
[1:32:34] and and and praise and you want to work
[1:32:36] for
[1:32:37] me but before I receive this I need you
[1:32:42] to go make things
[1:32:49] right there are things that God may want
[1:32:52] of us before we get what we want from
[1:32:57] God and and it's not for me to tell you
[1:33:00] I don't
[1:33:02] know but what we do need to do is get
[1:33:05] serious about developing this
[1:33:06] relationship with God spend more time
[1:33:09] with him because anybody can just say
[1:33:12] well yeah every you know everything's
[1:33:13] right between me and the Lord until it's
[1:33:18] not so we come with a praise offer we
[1:33:21] come with humility come with a Zeal to
[1:33:23] repent we come seeking his faith and we
[1:33:25] come with
[1:33:28] confidence the Bible says without faith
[1:33:30] it's impossible to please him for he
[1:33:33] that cometh to God must first believe
[1:33:34] that he is and he's a rewarder to them
[1:33:36] that diligently seek
[1:33:38] Him and the bride of Christ I believe is
[1:33:41] building their faith just like Enoch the
[1:33:45] Bible says by faith Enoch was translated
[1:33:48] that he should not see death and was not
[1:33:52] found he was not found why what's the
[1:33:55] reason because God had translated him
[1:33:58] for before his translation he had a an
[1:34:02] amazing
[1:34:05] testimony he didn't see the the the
[1:34:07] blind race or the blind's eyes come open
[1:34:10] he didn't see the the dead
[1:34:13] raay but he had an amazing
[1:34:17] testimony he he he pleased the Bible
[1:34:21] says he pleased God that is an amazing
[1:34:27] testimony the bride will have that
[1:34:30] testimony right before the Rapture I
[1:34:33] believe that with all my heart all right
[1:34:36] waiting on the Lord is completely
[1:34:38] different than waiting on anything else
[1:34:40] Psalms 27:13 says I had fainted unless I
[1:34:44] had believed to see the goodness of the
[1:34:46] Lord in the land of the living verse 14
[1:34:50] wait on the Lord be of good courage and
[1:34:53] he shall shall strengthen thine heart
[1:34:56] wait I say on the Lord now look part of
[1:35:00] this is you know we're just know brother
[1:35:02] Bram said I'm just hitting the
[1:35:05] highlights you know other ministers are
[1:35:07] gonna they're going to dig deep they're
[1:35:08] going to get the Nuggets they're going
[1:35:09] to break it to you I'm just going to say
[1:35:11] it like this I am just
[1:35:14] hitting I'm just hitting the high
[1:35:17] spots you need to get in prayer and
[1:35:20] start putting these things into practice
[1:35:26] I'll say it like this to let's say to
[1:35:30] whoever is the most closest one in the
[1:35:33] church to the Lord for now I say this to
[1:35:37] that
[1:35:38] person would you not want to be
[1:35:41] closer would you not want to be closer
[1:35:44] this is a good word for all of us it's
[1:35:47] it's it it all we have to do is do our
[1:35:51] part because God is faithful to do his
[1:35:54] part do you believe that God will reward
[1:35:57] us with his presence it'll give us inner
[1:36:00] strength and joy and peace and you know
[1:36:02] what happens when you have joy and peace
[1:36:04] and love and strength that means if
[1:36:07] somebody does slap you on the face you
[1:36:09] can turn the other cheek you're not
[1:36:12] going to get bent out of
[1:36:13] shape you're not going to lose
[1:36:17] it
[1:36:19] right get so full of God that when you
[1:36:21] tip over nothing but him comes out
[1:36:25] right the more of yourself that you're
[1:36:27] filled with the more of yourself is
[1:36:29] going to come out but the more you're
[1:36:31] filled with God the more of him will
[1:36:35] come
[1:36:36] out
[1:36:38] amen oh my my it is time I just want to
[1:36:42] say this I'm just going to kind of skip
[1:36:44] some stuff and come down to
[1:36:50] this I want you to set your heart and
[1:36:53] your soul to seek the
[1:36:55] Lord arise therefore and build ye the
[1:37:00] sanctuary of God build it don't don't
[1:37:04] rely on the preacher I'm gonna say don't
[1:37:08] even
[1:37:09] rely I'm just listening to brother
[1:37:11] brandom
[1:37:13] tapes brother brandom said rapturing
[1:37:16] faith lies in the tapes that means when
[1:37:19] you're listening to the tapes you need
[1:37:21] to believe you need to and you believe
[1:37:25] by moving in action and start obeying
[1:37:27] and putting those things into your
[1:37:30] life that is what brings about rapturing
[1:37:34] faith be faithful with what God gives
[1:37:37] you walk in the light as he has given it
[1:37:39] to
[1:37:40] you you are a special people the Bible
[1:37:43] says you are a chosen generation you're
[1:37:45] a royal priesthood you're a holy nation
[1:37:48] you're peculiar people that you should
[1:37:51] show forth the Praises of him that
[1:37:52] called you out of dark dark nness into
[1:37:54] His Marvelous Light God has brought us
[1:37:56] into the
[1:37:59] message I remember at one
[1:38:02] time I was just like everybody else in
[1:38:05] the world which was a nobody that
[1:38:07] thought he was a
[1:38:10] somebody and then God had mercy on me he
[1:38:14] he showed me that I was a
[1:38:17] nobody and I just said yes Lord I am a
[1:38:19] nobody help me I need you and so he
[1:38:22] brought into the message and now we're
[1:38:25] walking we have all this light and I
[1:38:29] believe God wants us to
[1:38:31] arise arise and start putting this word
[1:38:35] into our lives in a greater way than we
[1:38:38] have and I'm not taking away any
[1:38:39] spirituality from any person God knows
[1:38:42] that was that's never in my heart it is
[1:38:45] in my heart to provoke us to Good Works
[1:38:49] that is in my heart and I'm okay with
[1:38:52] that um
[1:38:55] you're the
[1:38:56] bride there there's more things expected
[1:38:58] out of the Bride than there is the
[1:38:59] foolish
[1:39:01] virgin and and and God has has blessed
[1:39:05] us now Jesus said I go to prepare a
[1:39:08] place for
[1:39:09] you that where I am you can you can be
[1:39:13] there too so where is that place he's
[1:39:16] preparing it's inside of
[1:39:19] us it ain't up in heaven
[1:39:22] somewhere is inside of us that he's
[1:39:25] preparing we got to take the time to
[1:39:28] wait on
[1:39:29] him do the things that he wants us to do
[1:39:31] because that's how he's preparing he
[1:39:33] ain't going to have no
[1:39:34] puppets he ain't going to control us he
[1:39:37] ain't going to manipulate us he ain't
[1:39:39] going to do it all himself it's a joint
[1:39:41] thing so we wait on him and we hear from
[1:39:44] the Lord what he wants us to do and then
[1:39:46] we get down and we walk out of that
[1:39:48] prayer room with an inner strength I'll
[1:39:51] tell you our head may be bowing down
[1:39:54] like like the wheat right but I'll tell
[1:39:57] you there's something inside of us a
[1:39:59] strength that that will go out and live
[1:40:03] a humble Christian
[1:40:05] Life let's Stand Together God bless
[1:40:09] you God grant this for each of us
[1:40:22] amen
[1:40:24] be determined be
[1:40:27] determined to press through in prayer it
