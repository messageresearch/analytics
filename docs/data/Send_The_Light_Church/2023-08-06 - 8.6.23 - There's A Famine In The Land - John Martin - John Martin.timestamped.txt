[38:47] stream
[38:49] makes you visit them and
[38:51] Grant a piece of yourself into each
[38:54] Heart Lord
[38:56] father we thank you for these things now
[38:58] and ask your blessings not only on the
[38:59] reading of this word but Lord this
[39:02] entire message now we pray in Jesus
[39:04] Christ's name amen amen
[39:09] Amos chapter 8 starting with verse
[39:11] number 11.
[39:15] verse number 11 behold the days come
[39:19] saith the Lord God
[39:21] that I will send a famine in the land
[39:26] not a famine of bread nor a thirst for
[39:30] water but of the hearing the words of
[39:34] the Lord
[39:36] and they shall Wander from sea to Sea
[39:40] from the north even to the east
[39:43] and they shall run to and fro
[39:46] to seek the word of the Lord
[39:50] and shall not find it
[39:53] in that day shall the fair virgins and
[39:56] young men faint for thirst
[40:00] amen may God add His blessings to this
[40:03] word as your be seated
[40:06] amen
[40:09] we want to entitle this message there is
[40:12] a famine in the land
[40:16] and for a subject God has sent a famine
[40:19] into churches
[40:21] yeah
[40:22] something we don't think about very much
[40:25] but you know I was thinking this morning
[40:26] every time we come to church there's a
[40:28] funeral
[40:29] and there's a birth
[40:32] because we are presented with the word
[40:34] and that word
[40:36] is either going to cause us to die out
[40:38] to self
[40:40] or to become bring forth a new life to
[40:44] that word
[40:46] it just all depends on where we're at
[40:52] during the Days of Elijah
[40:55] the Bible says that Ahab had done more
[40:58] evil in the sight of the Lord than all
[41:00] the other kings that were before
[41:03] to make matters worse he married Jezebel
[41:06] who we understand according to
[41:07] scriptures was fed to the dogs
[41:10] God did not think highly of her
[41:14] God had brought down judgment upon the
[41:16] land
[41:17] and Elijah said to Ahab as the Lord God
[41:20] of Israel liveth before whom I stand
[41:24] there shall not be do nor Reign these
[41:28] years but according to my word
[41:31] so God sent a judgment in that time and
[41:35] there was no rain for about three and a
[41:37] half years and this
[41:38] having no rain caused the famine
[41:42] and this famine affected uh the poor
[41:46] the widows the sick The Afflicted people
[41:49] as well
[41:51] but God took care of even a widow woman
[41:56] amen amen
[41:58] and I believe God took care of her
[42:01] because she gave all she had
[42:05] to support the message of the hour
[42:09] the Bible tells us in Kings 17 for thus
[42:12] saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel
[42:15] of meal
[42:16] shall not waste neither shall the crews
[42:19] of oil fail until the day that the Lord
[42:22] senteth rain upon the Earth
[42:25] and she went and did according to the
[42:28] saying that Elijah of Elijah and she and
[42:32] he and her house did eat many days
[42:35] during this famine amen and the barrel
[42:38] of meal wasted not neither did the crews
[42:41] of oil fail according to the word of the
[42:44] Lord which he spake by Elijah
[42:48] so as God shut up the Heavens of rain
[42:50] and caused this famine in the Days of
[42:52] Elijah Amos prophesied that there would
[42:55] be a famine in our day
[42:59] this day that we're living in brother
[43:01] Brandon said in the message thy house he
[43:03] says I want to say this that I believe
[43:05] too that the Bible said in the last days
[43:07] there will come a famine in the land and
[43:10] that famine won't be a bread and a water
[43:11] but for the hearing of the true word of
[43:13] God
[43:15] and people would run from the East and
[43:18] the west from the North and the South
[43:20] seeking to hear the word of the Lord
[43:22] and
[43:24] he said and we're just about living in
[43:29] that day
[43:30] that's what he said now he said that
[43:33] 62 years ago this Tuesday
[43:37] so I could say that
[43:38] officially we're living in the day of
[43:42] amos's Prophecy
[43:45] where God himself has sent a famine in
[43:48] the land
[43:49] it's not a famine of bread
[43:51] nor The Thirst of water
[43:53] but of the hearing of the words of the
[43:57] Lord
[43:59] not the speaking
[44:02] but of the hearing
[44:06] people who believe in God cannot hear
[44:08] the words of the Lord that's what this
[44:10] prophecy is about right because if
[44:13] you're seeking going here and there and
[44:15] you're looking
[44:16] there have to be someone that believes
[44:18] in God right right
[44:20] I know there's a lot of mixed up
[44:22] preaching going on in this world
[44:25] but the famine is not for the preaching
[44:32] it's because God has withheld his word
[44:34] to be heard
[44:36] the famine is of the hearing of the
[44:39] words of the Lord and God has sent the
[44:42] famine
[44:44] it's a famine happening to the ears
[44:48] to the ears
[44:50] amen
[44:52] God has restored his true word through a
[44:56] prophet in this age amen
[44:58] amen the heart of the children have been
[45:00] turned back to the original faith of
[45:01] their fathers
[45:03] Elijah has come first and restored all
[45:07] things as Jesus said amen
[45:09] all the Mysteries have been finished
[45:12] according to Revelations 10 7. amen but
[45:15] the famine is of the hearing of the
[45:16] words of the Lord
[45:19] the days have come when people don't
[45:22] want to hear the word of the Lord
[45:25] they'd rather have entertainment in the
[45:26] church
[45:29] they'd rather have things to make him
[45:31] laugh and feel good about themselves
[45:35] they rather
[45:37] hear things that
[45:39] help them to do what they want to do in
[45:41] their flesh
[45:43] and not have to do everything that the
[45:45] Bible says
[45:47] are you with me
[45:49] and still make it to heaven
[45:52] second Timothy chapter four
[45:55] Paul talking to Timothy here says I
[45:57] charged thee be therefore before God
[46:01] and the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:03] who shall judge the quick and the dead
[46:07] at his appearing and his kingdom
[46:11] preach the word be instant in season out
[46:14] of season reprove rebuke exhort with all
[46:17] long-suffering and Doctrine
[46:20] in other words don't hold back
[46:23] don't hold back just give it your all
[46:26] why for the time will come
[46:31] I believe that time is here
[46:33] when they will not endure sound Doctrine
[46:38] but after their own lust shall they Heap
[46:42] to themselves
[46:43] teachers having itchy ears
[46:48] and they shall turn away their ears
[46:53] from the truth
[46:55] and shall turn unto Fables
[47:02] their own ears don't want to hear the
[47:05] truth because it brings too much
[47:07] conviction to them
[47:10] so the famine is of the hearing of the
[47:13] words of the Lord amen
[47:15] the time is here where certain Believers
[47:17] can't stomach the full word
[47:21] the same word that the prophet has
[47:23] restored to us but they don't want it
[47:26] sound Doctrine but they can't do it
[47:29] they want a different lifestyle for
[47:32] themselves
[47:33] they want to do their own thing their
[47:36] own will
[47:37] and so they want to believe in God that
[47:40] fits their suit
[47:44] the thing is we need the complete Bible
[47:46] to make it man shall not live by bird
[47:49] alone but by every word we must have it
[47:52] we cannot make a Rapture with part of
[47:54] the word
[47:56] because he's coming for a bride without
[47:58] spot without Rinko
[48:00] one that has been dressed in the full
[48:02] word
[48:05] second Timothy 3 says all scripture is
[48:08] given by the inspiration of God and is
[48:12] profitable for Doctrine for reproof for
[48:16] correction for instruction in
[48:18] righteousness that the man of God may be
[48:22] perfect and thoroughly furnished unto
[48:24] all good works
[48:27] amen and that's what we want
[48:29] and instead of tallying up with the word
[48:33] their pride leads people to desire a
[48:37] certain type of teaching
[48:39] that fits their personal desires
[48:44] their personal lust their Personal
[48:48] Agenda the way they want to be more of a
[48:51] modern Christian
[48:53] one where faithfulness isn't really
[48:56] required anymore one where you don't
[48:58] have to pay tithes one where you don't
[49:01] have to worry about Holiness one where
[49:05] you don't have to love your enemies you
[49:08] don't have to die out every day like
[49:10] Jesus said
[49:12] see they're wanting a teaching that fits
[49:15] them
[49:16] they want to live the way their flesh
[49:19] wants to live
[49:20] and nobody is going to change their mind
[49:24] but after their own lust shall they Heap
[49:28] to themselves teachers having itching
[49:31] ears
[49:34] there's a famine in the land today for
[49:36] the hearing of the word of the Lord
[49:40] and God has sent it
[49:43] second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 10.
[49:47] and it's okay to say Amen to the word
[49:53] of course I do not recommend you ever
[49:55] saying Amen to my words
[49:58] because my words fail
[50:01] but if it's the word of the Lord you can
[50:03] say Amen to it
[50:06] II Thessalonians 2 10 and with all
[50:09] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[50:12] them that perish because they love not
[50:15] the truth that they might be saved
[50:20] because they received not the love of
[50:24] the truth I mean that they might be safe
[50:26] so it's not just here receiving the word
[50:29] of God we must receive the love of the
[50:32] word
[50:33] there's the key
[50:35] and for this cause God shall send them
[50:38] strong delusions
[50:41] that they should believe a lie
[50:44] that they all might be damned who
[50:46] believe not the truth but have pleasure
[50:48] in unrighteousness
[50:51] so God sends this famine and he sends
[50:55] these strong delusions that they were
[50:56] believable a lie
[50:59] but why
[51:00] why would God do this
[51:02] it's because they haven't received the
[51:05] love of the truth
[51:07] it's not in their heart they want to
[51:09] make it to Heaven they want to go to
[51:10] heaven they want to believe they're
[51:12] doing the right thing by going to church
[51:15] but there are certain aspects that they
[51:16] don't want to tally up to right and if
[51:19] we're missing the love for the truth
[51:21] we're going to miss God
[51:28] it's a heart condition
[51:31] the reason that people can't hear from
[51:34] God is because of a heart condition
[51:37] it's a spiritual heart disease and you
[51:40] know what it's caused by
[51:42] by it's caused by a love for yourself
[51:45] that's what causes the spiritual heart
[51:48] disease notice their pleasure was loving
[51:52] to do their own will amen
[51:55] and when we come into church all of us
[51:57] should be on this page God no matter
[52:00] what happens I want to please you more
[52:03] than anything
[52:05] amen
[52:07] because that's all that's going to
[52:08] matter when it's all over
[52:13] when a Believer chooses the broad way
[52:15] basically do whatever you want to do God
[52:18] will send them strong delusions
[52:23] strong evidence that is contrary to the
[52:27] truth did you ever like believe in
[52:30] something it was like so real when you
[52:31] found out it was wrong
[52:34] yep but you were willing to like fight
[52:36] for it at the time well that's what this
[52:39] is It's a powerful false belief
[52:43] and God is sending that upon people
[52:45] who've already made a choice in their
[52:48] heart that they don't want the word
[52:55] all because they didn't receive a
[52:58] perfect love for the truth
[53:02] having truth without love will only
[53:04] bring a man into bondage
[53:09] these church goers never pursued a love
[53:12] affair with the Lord
[53:14] and they didn't pursue a love affair
[53:16] relationship with the word
[53:20] it was like the word
[53:22] is different than God
[53:25] and church is different than God
[53:29] is what I think and feel and it's a
[53:32] parcel between me and him but God has
[53:34] given us his word to tell us who he is
[53:37] and God has given us this place for
[53:40] Perfection yes
[53:42] he's given us a five-fold Ministry
[53:45] man these these people these churchgoers
[53:49] they didn't want to lay everything aside
[53:51] and go after perfect love
[53:53] they didn't want to seek the things
[53:55] which are above they didn't want to
[53:56] accept their affections on on the Lord
[54:00] Jesus Christ they'd rather put their
[54:02] affections on the things of the Earth
[54:06] so God sends a famine of hearing the of
[54:09] hearing the words of the Lord
[54:11] and with it he sends strong delusions
[54:13] because of of a heart condition and
[54:17] Jesus gives a parable about heart
[54:20] conditions there were four different
[54:22] types of conditions of a heart that the
[54:25] same word fell upon
[54:27] and Believers are coming to church I'll
[54:31] say it like this without proper heart
[54:33] preparation and that's the problem
[54:35] they're not hearing from God that's the
[54:37] reason they're not hearing from God
[54:39] they think they can just pop into church
[54:41] and they ought to be hearing something
[54:43] to encourage them or help them and I'll
[54:45] tell you God is God he's serious and he
[54:48] means business
[54:49] he deserves reverence and respect and he
[54:52] deserves our hearts to be prepared
[54:55] now it's different if you've never been
[54:57] here before and you don't you've never
[54:58] heard the truth
[55:00] amen God understands that but after a
[55:03] while God expects you
[55:06] Amen to come into His Sanctuary with a
[55:09] heart that's prepared for his word to
[55:11] fall into
[55:15] I think more good will happen to our
[55:18] lives the better we can prepare
[55:21] we've already tried getting the best
[55:23] ministers there were in this message
[55:26] and I'm thankful for them I love them I
[55:29] do every one of them
[55:30] but that isn't enough to change us right
[55:34] Jesus himself could be standing here
[55:36] teaching the word of God the same word
[55:40] but if our heart isn't prepared to
[55:42] receive it if we're not in love with
[55:44] that word what good would it do
[55:47] amen
[55:48] so when these people don't find the word
[55:52] of the Lord
[55:54] or they don't find God in the word
[55:56] that's being preached
[55:59] when they can't hear with their hearts
[56:01] the word of the Lord they wander off in
[56:04] the wilderness
[56:06] the Bible says they wander
[56:09] and run to and fro and seek the word of
[56:13] the Lord in other things
[56:15] but the Bible says they can't find it
[56:19] people are looking for something that's
[56:22] already here
[56:28] they just don't see it
[56:30] now we know the culmination of the
[56:32] Rapture is just around the corner but
[56:34] the kingdom has been coming all along
[56:37] the kingdom has been being preached to
[56:39] us all along
[56:43] Luke chapter 17 if you like to turn
[56:45] there with me
[56:48] Luke chapter 17 verse 20 and when he was
[56:51] demanded of the Pharisees when the
[56:56] kingdom of God should come he answered
[56:58] them and said the kingdom of God doesn't
[57:00] come with observation
[57:03] now there's such a powerful message in
[57:06] this the kingdom of God cometh not with
[57:09] observation too many people today are
[57:12] looking for God with these eyes
[57:16] well what did you see in church what
[57:18] happened
[57:20] that word observation means inspection
[57:25] it also means of
[57:27] oscarla akuler I'm sorry
[57:31] o-c-u-l-a-r acular evidence
[57:34] what does that really mean I had to look
[57:36] it up
[57:38] it means connected with the vision of
[57:41] the eyes
[57:44] so the kingdom is not coming with an
[57:47] inspection of what these eyes can see
[57:53] it's not by inspecting to see evidence
[57:56] with our eyes whether God is with us or
[57:58] not
[58:03] if
[58:05] people are looking to see something
[58:07] outwardly when they come to church
[58:10] they're going by their feelings they're
[58:12] going by their looks they're you know
[58:14] what happened to this person what
[58:15] happened to that person and by these
[58:18] things they can believe a little bit
[58:20] more
[58:22] so that's what psychologically is going
[58:24] on inside of them but that is not how
[58:27] the kingdom of God is coming
[58:30] too often believers who don't prepare
[58:32] their hearts right before service they
[58:34] come into service with a carnal mindset
[58:38] inspecting to see evidence with your
[58:40] eyes instead of hearing from God through
[58:43] the word
[58:45] separating the two
[58:47] not recognizing God in the word
[58:51] verse 21 says neither shall they say Lo
[58:54] here or there for behold the kingdom of
[58:56] God is within you we ought to be looking
[58:58] inside here to hear from God
[59:04] this is where he's coming it doesn't
[59:06] matter what happens out here that's
[59:07] right
[59:08] this doesn't change you if everybody
[59:11] stood up spoke in tongues and ran from
[59:13] one side to the next side all said
[59:15] Hallelujah we were dancing in the spirit
[59:17] for two hours that doesn't mean the
[59:19] inside of the inside is going to change
[59:23] the word has to change our nature on the
[59:26] inside
[59:31] the kingdom of God is within you the
[59:35] voice is heard on the inside
[59:38] we ought to be paying attention to the
[59:40] inside
[59:42] that's where the famine is happening
[59:44] today
[59:45] the famine is happening in here
[59:49] the errors are shut off
[59:55] didn't you say something about that to
[59:58] the laodicean church age
[1:00:00] right get something so you can hear
[1:00:05] and he said unto his disciples in verse
[1:00:08] 22 the days will come when ye shall
[1:00:11] desire to see one of the days of the son
[1:00:14] of man you shall not see it and they
[1:00:16] shall say unto you see hear or see there
[1:00:18] he said go not after them nor follow
[1:00:23] them
[1:00:25] see they're running to and fro
[1:00:28] in Matthew
[1:00:30] Matthew said it like this Jesus said If
[1:00:32] any man shall say unto you Lo here is
[1:00:34] Christ or there believe it not
[1:00:39] it's not about being in the right
[1:00:41] location
[1:00:42] it's about having Jesus on the inside
[1:00:45] it's about being in the right place in
[1:00:48] your heart
[1:00:49] that's the place you're going to meet
[1:00:51] him
[1:00:51] [Applause]
[1:00:55] look you could meet him in your car you
[1:00:56] can meet him in your bedroom
[1:00:59] why would you entertain a thought God
[1:01:01] ain't here
[1:01:02] why would you do that
[1:01:05] because carnally you're not sitting
[1:01:08] right
[1:01:12] you're sitting in the flesh
[1:01:15] your heart's not right
[1:01:20] get your heart right you'll see Jesus
[1:01:22] and everything get your heart right
[1:01:24] you'll see Jesus in everything you do
[1:01:27] because as I'll be with you even in you
[1:01:30] to the end of the world
[1:01:32] I don't care if you're in the Lion's Den
[1:01:34] I don't care if you're in the belly of a
[1:01:36] fish
[1:01:37] I don't care if you're going through a
[1:01:38] fiery furnace I'll never leave you I'll
[1:01:41] never forsake you
[1:01:45] it's dropped down to verse 32 in Luke 17
[1:01:49] here Jesus said remember Lot's wife
[1:01:52] all right
[1:01:55] talking about the last days now
[1:01:58] famine strong delusions he said
[1:02:01] whosoever shall seek to save his life is
[1:02:04] going to lose it
[1:02:06] and whosoever shall lose his life shall
[1:02:09] preserve it
[1:02:10] so Jesus is telling us the way that we
[1:02:13] escape the judgment is to forsake loving
[1:02:16] ourselves
[1:02:18] amen lose it
[1:02:20] just lose it who cares
[1:02:25] because you're gonna find him
[1:02:27] you're going to find life
[1:02:30] but you stay in love with yourself that
[1:02:32] means you have to get rid of the word
[1:02:34] because the flesh
[1:02:37] is always going to be enmity with with
[1:02:39] God
[1:02:40] the Cardinal mind the carnal way of
[1:02:43] looking at things
[1:02:45] verse 34 I tell you in that night there
[1:02:48] shall be two men in one bed the one
[1:02:51] shall be taken and the other shall be
[1:02:53] left two women shall be grinding
[1:02:55] together the one shall be taken the
[1:02:57] other left two men shall be in the few
[1:03:01] the one shall be taken and the one shall
[1:03:04] be left
[1:03:07] and they answered and said unto him
[1:03:12] where
[1:03:15] where first it was when
[1:03:17] right the beginning it was when so the
[1:03:20] kingdom of God come now it's where Lord
[1:03:22] where is this going to happen
[1:03:25] and Jesus answered them
[1:03:28] wheresoever the body is
[1:03:31] there another the Eagles would be
[1:03:34] gathered together
[1:03:39] do you catch that
[1:03:41] it's happening right now in our midst
[1:03:45] right here
[1:03:50] the Eagles are being caught up into
[1:03:52] Heavenly places
[1:03:54] and the the unbelievers being left
[1:03:57] behind
[1:03:59] I don't care if you're in a field I
[1:04:01] don't care if you're in a bed
[1:04:04] it's invisible happening Among Us
[1:04:08] summer in the famine
[1:04:11] some are given their heart to Jesus
[1:04:13] Christ
[1:04:16] others are left down here to wander
[1:04:18] Where's God I didn't see God where was
[1:04:20] God today did you get anything out of
[1:04:22] the message
[1:04:23] wandering
[1:04:27] but not the Eagles
[1:04:31] because they're an eagle
[1:04:33] the elect or the elect those that love
[1:04:36] God love God
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:39] that's all there is to it
[1:04:41] you know we all want to just believe I
[1:04:44] love God I'm an eagle I'm predestined
[1:04:46] and I'm happy let's get on that
[1:04:48] bandwagon but when it comes down to it
[1:04:50] we gotta start living that word
[1:04:53] that word has got to be real in our
[1:04:55] lives it's got to be manifested in our
[1:04:57] lives
[1:04:58] [Music]
[1:05:01] so here it is in our midst God is hid in
[1:05:04] simplicity
[1:05:06] God knows how to hide himself from the
[1:05:08] wise and prudence and he knows how to
[1:05:10] unveil himself to babes who are the
[1:05:12] babes they just love the truth
[1:05:15] they have a love for the word
[1:05:19] it means a lot to them it means
[1:05:22] everything to them amen
[1:05:25] look back at Amos 8 12 again what
[1:05:28] happens who can't hear the words of the
[1:05:30] Lord and they shall Wander from sea to
[1:05:32] Sea and from the north even to the East
[1:05:34] and they shall run to and fro and to
[1:05:36] seek the word of the Lord and shall not
[1:05:38] find it
[1:05:42] shall not find it
[1:05:44] because they loved their will more than
[1:05:47] they love the truth
[1:05:50] that's why you that's why people can't
[1:05:52] find it they're stuck in their own life
[1:05:57] they're not about seeking first the
[1:05:59] kingdom of God
[1:06:04] it's a scary place to be being a
[1:06:09] instead of loving the word and tallying
[1:06:12] up with the word they've turned their
[1:06:14] ears from the truth
[1:06:16] you know what I'll just I'll just leave
[1:06:19] I'll just shut it off I'll just leave
[1:06:22] the sanctuary I just won't come come on
[1:06:25] now this is what's happening
[1:06:28] amen they're turning their ears from the
[1:06:31] truth and shall turn onto Fables
[1:06:38] untruths things that are not real for
[1:06:41] the time has arrived that they will not
[1:06:44] endure sound Doctrine but after their
[1:06:48] own desire their own lust they shall
[1:06:50] Heap to themselves teachers having
[1:06:53] itching ears
[1:06:55] you ever have an itch
[1:06:58] I have I'll tell you for whatever reason
[1:07:01] all my life
[1:07:03] I mean like
[1:07:05] 30 years before I started preaching my
[1:07:07] ears always had an itch
[1:07:12] and you just kind of got to get a
[1:07:13] steroid or something just to like calm
[1:07:15] that down
[1:07:16] but you know how it is when you're
[1:07:18] you're hearing something you ever had a
[1:07:21] talk with your mom and your dad and your
[1:07:23] mom and dad who's trying to tell you
[1:07:25] something and you're going
[1:07:29] to relate sometimes we're sitting Church
[1:07:31] yeah I've heard this
[1:07:36] sometimes when we're hearing something
[1:07:39] you know we just get bothered by it
[1:07:41] that's irritating that preaching is
[1:07:43] irritating me
[1:07:47] and we just like want to turn from that
[1:07:49] and we want something different
[1:07:51] can you understand what's happening here
[1:07:54] in the presence of God that attitude
[1:07:59] he's God's got to correct that attitude
[1:08:01] before he's going to bless you
[1:08:05] it's just all there is to it
[1:08:09] so after Jesus shares the parable of the
[1:08:12] four different types of heart condition
[1:08:13] right here in Matthew 13 if you want to
[1:08:16] turn there verse number nine he says who
[1:08:19] have ears to hear Let Him hear
[1:08:26] not everybody can hear
[1:08:28] There's a Great Famine in this hour
[1:08:33] and look verse 10 the disciples came
[1:08:36] and said unto Jesus why do you speak
[1:08:40] unto them in parables
[1:08:45] why are you talking in a way
[1:08:48] that is hard to understand
[1:08:52] just tell us plainly
[1:08:56] and he answered and said to them because
[1:08:58] it's given unto you to know the
[1:09:00] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[1:09:02] unto them it is not given
[1:09:04] God is always in a place where he's
[1:09:08] trying to give the truth to somebody and
[1:09:10] keep it from somebody else
[1:09:12] amen always
[1:09:16] but why
[1:09:17] because some love him
[1:09:20] and some do not right amen
[1:09:24] It's A Love Affair it ain't how smart
[1:09:26] you can it ain't where you came from
[1:09:28] it's not about your education it's not
[1:09:30] how old you are it's not how many
[1:09:31] chances you've had
[1:09:34] it's about your heart condition
[1:09:37] if you just love the Lord thy God with
[1:09:40] all thy heart with all they sow with all
[1:09:42] they might God wants to reveal himself
[1:09:43] to you
[1:09:44] [Music]
[1:09:48] very well
[1:09:49] and God knows the condition of all of
[1:09:52] our hearts today
[1:09:53] every day when we wake up every day we
[1:09:56] come to church and that's what he's
[1:09:58] looking at and everything that's based
[1:10:00] that happens I'll tell you this is how
[1:10:02] important what I am telling you is all
[1:10:05] things work together for the good to
[1:10:07] them that love the Lord thy God
[1:10:09] amen and are called according to his
[1:10:12] purpose of course if you love him with
[1:10:14] all your heart the only thing you want
[1:10:16] to do is what he has called you to do
[1:10:21] but if you only love them so much and
[1:10:23] you want to do your purpose there's
[1:10:25] something missing in that love affair
[1:10:26] yes
[1:10:31] now I know this is like a strong message
[1:10:34] but that doesn't mean you can't be happy
[1:10:36] you can still be happy it's the word
[1:10:41] is still the word verse 12 for whosoever
[1:10:44] have to him shall be given
[1:10:49] and he shall have more abundance
[1:10:51] that sounds good
[1:10:53] but whosoever have not from him shall be
[1:10:56] taken away even
[1:10:58] away even that which he have well that
[1:11:01] don't sound
[1:11:02] Fair what's Jesus referring to here
[1:11:06] he's referring to whosoever has love
[1:11:09] who's been given a love for the truth is
[1:11:12] given them a portion of Truth
[1:11:18] if you love you will be given more truth
[1:11:23] but if you don't love like you should
[1:11:25] love the truth and that which you have
[1:11:27] will be taken away from you
[1:11:33] remember Jesus told Pilate
[1:11:35] before it was crucified
[1:11:38] and asked them
[1:11:40] Jesus said everyone that is of Truth
[1:11:43] hereareth my voice remember when he said
[1:11:44] that
[1:11:45] if you're of truth you're going to love
[1:11:48] truth
[1:11:52] it don't matter if it takes the hide off
[1:11:54] of you
[1:11:55] it don't matter how it makes you feel
[1:11:58] because it is the truth that sets us
[1:12:01] free I am the the truth and the life
[1:12:06] verse 13
[1:12:08] therefore speak I to them in Parables
[1:12:11] because they seen see not and they
[1:12:15] hearing they hear not neither do they
[1:12:18] understand and in them is fulfilled the
[1:12:20] prophecy of Isaiah's word saith by
[1:12:22] hearing you shall hear and shall not
[1:12:23] understand and see and you shall see and
[1:12:25] shall not perceive
[1:12:28] for this people's heart
[1:12:31] is waxed growth
[1:12:35] and their ears are dull of hearing and
[1:12:38] their eyes they have clothes see look at
[1:12:40] us all three more agency amen all three
[1:12:43] more agency They Don't Love
[1:12:45] the truth
[1:12:49] this people's heart is wax gross did not
[1:12:52] Jesus say because iniquity abound in
[1:12:55] this age the love of many would wax cold
[1:13:00] and what brother van tell us iniquity it
[1:13:02] was
[1:13:05] two free more agency is not doing what
[1:13:07] you know you should be doing
[1:13:11] whatever it is that God has spoke to you
[1:13:13] God is revealed it's still important to
[1:13:15] him today as the moment he told you
[1:13:21] this is the hardest age to live in
[1:13:24] it's so easy to have iniquity iniquity
[1:13:26] is not you know some going to the bar
[1:13:28] and doing some real bad thing
[1:13:30] iniquity can be simply I I don't feel
[1:13:32] like praying very much today it's true
[1:13:35] you think it's not that big a deal
[1:13:38] well because iniquity is more and more
[1:13:41] and more in people's life the love of
[1:13:42] many is waxing cold
[1:13:45] their ears are dull that means heavy of
[1:13:48] hearing their spiritual senses are not
[1:13:52] in tune with the lord they're not
[1:13:54] interested in what God has been telling
[1:13:56] them but after their own lust and their
[1:14:00] desires they've turned away
[1:14:04] their ears from the truth did you know
[1:14:07] before Eve could ever fall
[1:14:10] she had to turn away from God right amen
[1:14:14] before we ever do anything bad remember
[1:14:17] this we first had to turn down God
[1:14:22] so
[1:14:24] if the word is irritating you
[1:14:27] get in love with the word
[1:14:30] don't blame the preacher
[1:14:33] don't blame the messenger
[1:14:35] don't blame the source well that's not
[1:14:38] how I seek out it doesn't matter how you
[1:14:40] see God it matters what the word says He
[1:14:43] is search the scriptures for in them you
[1:14:46] think you have eternal life but they are
[1:14:48] they that testify of me the word
[1:14:50] declares who God is
[1:14:53] yes
[1:14:54] verse 15 for this people's heart is wax
[1:14:57] gross in their ears are dull of hearing
[1:14:58] their eyes have been closed let's say
[1:15:01] anything they should see with their ears
[1:15:03] see with their eyes and hear with their
[1:15:04] ears and should understand what their
[1:15:06] heart and should be converted
[1:15:08] that's what the word does it's perfect
[1:15:10] it converts the soul and I should heal
[1:15:14] them
[1:15:15] it's the word we need the word
[1:15:20] but blessed
[1:15:22] are your eyes
[1:15:24] for they see
[1:15:26] and your ears for they hear
[1:15:28] [Music]
[1:15:30] you have been put in a different
[1:15:32] category
[1:15:36] you are sitting in a category that is
[1:15:38] hearing the voice of God
[1:15:42] that something is registering in here
[1:15:46] and you want to please that word that's
[1:15:49] inside
[1:15:51] because that word is the Holy Ghost it's
[1:15:54] the Living Word of God is God in you the
[1:15:56] hope of glory
[1:15:58] so I say I want to say Amen to what
[1:16:02] Jesus is saying blessed are your ears
[1:16:07] your ears are different
[1:16:10] because you're the truth no they're the
[1:16:13] truth hear my voice
[1:16:16] you've got to agree with the word you
[1:16:18] got to believe it look at if you're
[1:16:19] sitting here waiting for feelings to
[1:16:21] change before you're going to create the
[1:16:22] word you're going to miss it it doesn't
[1:16:24] come with observation you've got to be
[1:16:26] connected to this word you got to be
[1:16:28] born of this word you're born again by
[1:16:31] the word of God and Incorruptible see
[1:16:34] that abideth forever
[1:16:36] we ought to be so happy to know that our
[1:16:38] ears
[1:16:40] can hear in our eyes can see because
[1:16:42] we're a blessed people
[1:16:44] verse 17 forever saying to the many
[1:16:47] prophets and righteous men have desire
[1:16:48] to see the things which you see and have
[1:16:50] not seen them and to hear the things
[1:16:52] that uh which ye hear and have not heard
[1:16:54] them
[1:16:56] that we're living in the greatest hour
[1:16:57] this is the hour that's ushering in the
[1:17:01] coming of the lord and there are so many
[1:17:03] people who are not hearing the voice of
[1:17:06] God they just come to church lead the
[1:17:08] church and they don't realize that
[1:17:09] they're in worse shape
[1:17:12] you're one or the other when you come to
[1:17:13] church
[1:17:17] but here we are in the greatest age when
[1:17:19] there's a famine
[1:17:21] when there's strong delusions around us
[1:17:24] when people are just wandering around
[1:17:26] aimlessly have no purpose not he they're
[1:17:31] certainly not being called to the
[1:17:32] purpose of God
[1:17:34] and God has opened your eyes
[1:17:38] God has blessed your ears
[1:17:41] God has given you an understanding heart
[1:17:45] in the midst of this Darkness here we
[1:17:48] are the children of light
[1:17:51] my sheep hear my voice
[1:17:53] and they follow me
[1:17:55] John 10 verse 3 says to him the porter
[1:17:59] openeth
[1:18:00] and the sheep hear his voice
[1:18:05] and he calleth his own sheep by name
[1:18:10] and he leadeth them
[1:18:12] out
[1:18:14] now
[1:18:16] he might not say John Keith Martin
[1:18:22] but when he speaks
[1:18:26] something in here tells me
[1:18:29] I'm Mrs Jesus
[1:18:31] okay
[1:18:32] I'm connected to him
[1:18:35] though all heaven
[1:18:38] is named under Jesus right that's what
[1:18:42] the scripture tells us
[1:18:44] he calls his own Sheep by name and he
[1:18:48] leads them out
[1:18:51] praise God
[1:18:53] what's he lead him out of
[1:18:57] does he lead him out of a man-made
[1:18:59] system we could say Amen
[1:19:02] leads them out of the world we could say
[1:19:04] Amen
[1:19:06] but it leads them out of themselves
[1:19:11] I want to be set free from this bondage
[1:19:13] right here this this flesh that's always
[1:19:16] in getting in the way
[1:19:21] that's what he's leading us and the word
[1:19:23] is setting us free
[1:19:25] he that the son is set free is free
[1:19:27] indeed don't desire to be in bondage
[1:19:31] verse 4 and when he put it forth his own
[1:19:33] sheep he goeth before them
[1:19:36] and the Sheep follow him
[1:19:39] for they know his voice
[1:19:43] so he's going out
[1:19:45] and the voice is saying
[1:19:48] follow me
[1:19:49] and the Sheep are following
[1:19:53] but is he just taking him on a trip in
[1:19:57] the pasture just hey we're gonna go out
[1:20:01] come back get inside the what is he what
[1:20:04] is he
[1:20:07] telling them to follow what is he at
[1:20:10] what is he telling them to follow
[1:20:15] well Jesus said If any man will follow
[1:20:17] me let him deny himself
[1:20:20] amen pick up his cross and follow me so
[1:20:23] when God is speaking to you he's
[1:20:26] speaking you to die out to self to pick
[1:20:29] up his will and follow him wherever he
[1:20:32] leads you
[1:20:33] I'll tell you live in a Christian life
[1:20:36] is not easy right
[1:20:38] when you're hanging on to your flesh
[1:20:42] but when you're willing to give up
[1:20:43] everything
[1:20:45] you're happy you're so happy Jesus set
[1:20:49] me free
[1:20:51] tell me you love the word
[1:20:54] so here we are we're sitting in church
[1:20:56] today with three types of believers
[1:20:59] not saying just every church has three
[1:21:02] types of Believers you heard that you
[1:21:03] know the you know it right
[1:21:06] we know that two of them end up in the
[1:21:08] same spot they'll make the make-believer
[1:21:10] and the unbeliever they end up in the
[1:21:11] same spot
[1:21:13] but then there's the believer and that
[1:21:16] believer is you
[1:21:18] and your eyes are blessed because you're
[1:21:20] a believer
[1:21:23] your ears are blessed because when you
[1:21:25] hear the word you say Amen to it because
[1:21:27] the Holy Ghost says Amen to every word
[1:21:29] of God
[1:21:30] why when the Holy Ghost and you say Amen
[1:21:32] to every word of God
[1:21:34] well brother John I say Amen more if you
[1:21:36] help me just say Amen more
[1:21:39] well then that wouldn't be the Holy
[1:21:41] Ghost and you saying amen would it be
[1:21:43] it'd be some enthusiastic
[1:21:46] fun joke
[1:21:50] it's the word it's it's coming without
[1:21:52] observation
[1:21:58] we don't want to be bothered by anyone
[1:22:02] in church
[1:22:04] we got to be mature
[1:22:07] as far as I'm concerned unbelievers are
[1:22:10] allowed to be here
[1:22:12] make Believers are allowed to be here
[1:22:15] because this is not my house
[1:22:18] this is God's house
[1:22:21] and he would at all would be saved
[1:22:23] all would come to him
[1:22:25] and God is good to the
[1:22:27] to his enemies to the good to the he's
[1:22:29] good to everybody he's the same you
[1:22:31] can't tell who's a Believer who's not a
[1:22:34] Believer by God's goodness he's so good
[1:22:37] but sometimes
[1:22:40] we can look at one another and tell
[1:22:43] whether it's God operating to us
[1:22:45] I always like what they said about
[1:22:47] Brother Band they couldn't tell us
[1:22:48] enemies from his friends
[1:22:51] because it was the same holy ghost in
[1:22:53] them treating everybody the same
[1:22:57] God has personally provided a place for
[1:23:01] every one of us here
[1:23:03] to meet with God
[1:23:05] to hear his voice and to receive the
[1:23:09] word into your heart
[1:23:10] now God has provided that for you
[1:23:12] personally
[1:23:15] if nobody else was here except you it
[1:23:18] would be between you and God
[1:23:21] and that's the way you need to come to
[1:23:23] church
[1:23:25] not about I wonder how things are going
[1:23:27] to be when you know I hope you know
[1:23:29] everybody no you be the one to meet with
[1:23:32] God it's all about you
[1:23:36] brother Brandon said in the message God
[1:23:37] has provided a way he said just pray
[1:23:42] I'm reading this quote because I don't
[1:23:43] want us to ever be bothered by anybody
[1:23:46] he said just pray sincerely
[1:23:49] he said don't be nervous
[1:23:52] if you do you'll never catch it
[1:23:55] just be simple just say Lord It's the
[1:23:59] Simplicity that they overlook
[1:24:01] they make it so complicated that's the
[1:24:04] reason they miss Jesus in the first
[1:24:06] place
[1:24:06] [Music]
[1:24:08] he's hid right here in Simplicity it
[1:24:11] just takes belief
[1:24:13] a belief that it is God speaking to me
[1:24:16] we're not here at church listening to
[1:24:19] John Martin's study
[1:24:22] John Martin's interpretation of the
[1:24:25] Bible
[1:24:26] no our faith is much higher than that
[1:24:32] look at the children of Israel when they
[1:24:34] were in Egypt one of the plagues is that
[1:24:36] there was darkness in the land of Egypt
[1:24:38] but in the uh where the children of
[1:24:41] Israel were staying in their homes they
[1:24:42] had light
[1:24:45] God is able to give one person light and
[1:24:49] let another person just roam in darkness
[1:24:53] in the same place the same word
[1:24:56] it's the word that gives light to us
[1:24:59] his word is a lamp to our our uh our our
[1:25:03] feet a light to our path uh a lamp to
[1:25:07] our path you know the scripture
[1:25:10] even if I don't know the scripture you
[1:25:12] know the scripture
[1:25:15] Zechariah 14 6 says now just listen to
[1:25:18] these words here as I try to get through
[1:25:19] this quick and it shall come to pass in
[1:25:21] that day
[1:25:23] that the light shall not be clear in the
[1:25:25] dark
[1:25:26] but it shall be one day which shall be
[1:25:29] known to the Lord
[1:25:32] not day nor night
[1:25:35] but it shall come to pass that at
[1:25:37] evening time
[1:25:39] it shall be light amen
[1:25:42] amen this is the evening time God has
[1:25:45] sent a message to just Shine the Light
[1:25:48] on everything not just the mysteries in
[1:25:51] the Bible
[1:25:52] not just making sure that you know we're
[1:25:56] baptized the correct way because you
[1:25:57] know there is an incorrect way to be
[1:25:59] baptized
[1:26:02] but To Shine the Light
[1:26:04] on Jesus Christ being the same
[1:26:07] today in my life as he was yesterday
[1:26:10] amen
[1:26:14] now what it's really going to take to
[1:26:16] make the rapture
[1:26:18] to to not elect this famine affect me
[1:26:23] hey hey if somebody doesn't want to love
[1:26:25] the word don't let it affect you love
[1:26:28] the word
[1:26:30] if you you've been caught up in in in in
[1:26:33] in issues and you haven't been coming to
[1:26:35] church just make her coming to church
[1:26:37] right make it right with God just say
[1:26:40] from this point forward I'm going to
[1:26:41] start coming to church with a love for
[1:26:43] the word
[1:26:45] not just part of the word
[1:26:47] can you imagine Jesus staying here
[1:26:49] standing here and says I love you and I
[1:26:52] give you this I'm going to meet this
[1:26:53] need and I'm going to and and and and
[1:26:55] and I want you to do this
[1:27:00] it's the word
[1:27:02] we should be interested in the in doing
[1:27:05] the word that we're not doing because
[1:27:07] the Bible says when he the spirit of
[1:27:09] truth will come he will lead and guide
[1:27:11] you into all truth
[1:27:14] hey
[1:27:15] now look I'm just going to be honest
[1:27:16] with you I've been baptized the correct
[1:27:18] way
[1:27:20] I've been baptized in the name of the
[1:27:23] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:24] now there was a time in my life that I
[1:27:27] was baptized incorrectly in titles
[1:27:31] father son Holy Ghost
[1:27:34] and the spirit of Truth came and led me
[1:27:37] into the correct baptism amen
[1:27:40] and so I just got back re-baptized the
[1:27:43] correct way according to the scriptures
[1:27:44] according to the example given in in the
[1:27:47] book of Acts by all the apostles there's
[1:27:49] no question in my mind there's no doubt
[1:27:50] in my mind and here I stand today but
[1:27:53] you know the holy spirit is not leading
[1:27:55] guide me into that anymore
[1:27:58] because I'm already walking into that
[1:28:00] light
[1:28:01] so the holy spirit is here leading and
[1:28:04] guiding you out of Darkness into his
[1:28:06] light
[1:28:08] it ain't good enough to say I'm in the
[1:28:10] message
[1:28:12] he's trying to get the message in you
[1:28:14] all the message
[1:28:17] so let him speak to your heart let him
[1:28:20] bring conviction because that is the job
[1:28:22] of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:25] and we welcome him
[1:28:27] Isaiah 60 verse 2 says for Behold The
[1:28:31] Darkness shall cover the Earth
[1:28:33] and gross Darkness the people pull this
[1:28:36] up
[1:28:37] but the Lord shall arise upon
[1:28:40] thee
[1:28:42] notice the whole
[1:28:44] world the whole Earth
[1:28:47] is in darkness
[1:28:49] and it's on all the people but the Lord
[1:28:53] we found favor in the sight of the Lord
[1:28:56] God has brought this truth to you and he
[1:28:59] shined his light upon you
[1:29:02] we ought to be the happiest people
[1:29:05] we shouldn't be waiting for something to
[1:29:07] make us feel good we he's already given
[1:29:09] us eternal life he's already showing us
[1:29:12] the truth
[1:29:14] just
[1:29:15] keep rejoicing in what he's given you
[1:29:18] [Music]
[1:29:19] now here's what we got to do it's verse
[1:29:21] one arise
[1:29:23] and shine
[1:29:24] for thy light has come in the glory of
[1:29:27] the Lord is risen upon thee
[1:29:30] amen if God is in your life
[1:29:33] then seek those things which are above
[1:29:36] arise and let others know that
[1:29:40] that God is real and he wants to save
[1:29:43] them
[1:29:44] to bring them into a greater truth
[1:29:47] I'd rather spend my life trying to help
[1:29:50] somebody to this word than spend any
[1:29:53] time
[1:29:55] anything else and I know we got to work
[1:29:58] we got to clean we got to eat but did
[1:30:01] you know that somehow gets mixed up
[1:30:05] like we don't know where the line is at
[1:30:07] right
[1:30:09] I'll tell you where the line is at is Is
[1:30:11] Your Love Affair
[1:30:13] the more you love them the more you
[1:30:15] can't get your mind off of them
[1:30:18] take this whole world but give me Jesus
[1:30:20] how's that that song that sister Lucille
[1:30:22] had often sung
[1:30:24] about uh
[1:30:26] the shutters need to be repaired
[1:30:30] This Old House
[1:30:32] is in need of repair but for some reason
[1:30:35] I just can't get motivated to do it I
[1:30:37] got leaving on my mind
[1:30:39] that he's coming soon
[1:30:42] and we just got to remind one another
[1:30:44] remind one another he's coming soon
[1:30:47] don't wait for the pulpit to tell you
[1:30:50] Christ and you can help one another
[1:30:52] we're a body Ministry
[1:30:54] amen
[1:30:58] so if you want to Feast during this
[1:31:00] famine
[1:31:01] fall in love with the truth amen the key
[1:31:04] is love to love the Lord thy God with
[1:31:07] all that heart with all they sow with
[1:31:09] all they might
[1:31:10] oh my
[1:31:12] too many people are missing hearing the
[1:31:14] words of the Lord
[1:31:17] because their heart is not prepared
[1:31:20] they're not in love with why they're
[1:31:22] here
[1:31:23] brother Brian said in the third seal he
[1:31:25] says not the others
[1:31:28] they sure won't do it they'll miss it a
[1:31:31] million miles we've been through all
[1:31:33] that and show how they missed John they
[1:31:36] missed Elijah they missed Jesus how they
[1:31:38] uh
[1:31:40] how they miss them all the way along
[1:31:44] and they'll do the same thing because
[1:31:46] the Bible said they would see
[1:31:49] so then in that time it'll be very
[1:31:52] humble
[1:31:53] it'll be so simple
[1:31:55] that'll make people fall away from it
[1:31:57] it's too simple for them we find out and
[1:32:01] always when people get smart and
[1:32:03] educated and know a whole lot then they
[1:32:07] they just miss it you know
[1:32:10] Jesus never took them kind of people
[1:32:14] for to be his disciples
[1:32:16] he took unlearned people fishermen and
[1:32:18] nobodies that was connected with their
[1:32:21] church and things he just got ordinary
[1:32:24] men Tax Collectors Farmers fishermen and
[1:32:26] so forth to do his work see
[1:32:29] because they know they're nothing
[1:32:31] then he can make something out of them
[1:32:34] as long as they keep knowing that
[1:32:37] they're nothing
[1:32:38] then God can work through them
[1:32:41] so it's something that we gotta every
[1:32:44] day nowhere nothing
[1:32:48] Romans 10
[1:32:51] 16 says but they have not obeyed the
[1:32:54] gospel for Isaiah said Lord who have
[1:32:56] believed our report so then Faith cometh
[1:32:59] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:33:01] God
[1:33:03] so faith comes when we hear the word of
[1:33:05] God but there's a famine in the land for
[1:33:08] the hearing of the word so if we're not
[1:33:09] hearing the word we're not getting faith
[1:33:11] and Jesus said when he returns shall he
[1:33:13] find faith on the Earth
[1:33:16] you know who's going to hear it his own
[1:33:19] elect that are crying day or night help
[1:33:21] me Lord
[1:33:22] I really want you
[1:33:26] but if we're not crying day and night we
[1:33:28] don't we're not that hard for God
[1:33:35] no no this may not be what you want to
[1:33:37] hear
[1:33:39] but this is what we need
[1:33:41] it I say to the bride here blessed are
[1:33:44] your ears for they hear your eyes for
[1:33:48] they see
[1:33:50] I say to the bride fear not little flock
[1:33:53] it's the father's good pleasure to give
[1:33:56] it to you regardless of what's going on
[1:33:58] in your family
[1:34:02] if you're going to wait till somebody
[1:34:03] straightens up in your family
[1:34:05] you're making a mistake
[1:34:10] two will be in the bed one will be taken
[1:34:12] two will be in church one's going to be
[1:34:15] caught up in Heavenly places just
[1:34:16] praising God for the word and the other
[1:34:18] is going to be like what's going on just
[1:34:20] kind of wandering around
[1:34:23] help us Lord
[1:34:25] Jesus said he's coming as a thief in the
[1:34:28] night
[1:34:33] and the bride
[1:34:36] is going to be ready that's the only
[1:34:37] group that's going to be ready
[1:34:40] she's the little flock
[1:34:43] and she's going to get ready without any
[1:34:46] observation
[1:34:48] because the kingdom is coming into her
[1:34:51] without observation
[1:34:55] the Rapture is going to be a secret
[1:34:59] the nature change is going to be a
[1:35:02] secret
[1:35:03] now I know we'll see the manifestations
[1:35:05] and you'll see the manifestations in
[1:35:07] your own life when something happens on
[1:35:10] the inside
[1:35:11] but you know there's churches out there
[1:35:13] that say they didn't have a good service
[1:35:15] because they didn't see the spirit of
[1:35:17] God move
[1:35:20] I'll tell you when God just speaks one
[1:35:21] word to your heart you had a good
[1:35:23] service
[1:35:23] [Music]
[1:35:25] it's coming without observation
[1:35:30] the Rapture has already started we've
[1:35:33] already heard the shout
[1:35:34] we're putting our clothes on
[1:35:36] as brother Batman has said there's
[1:35:38] there's a voice behind that voice we
[1:35:41] didn't just hear the voice of a man we
[1:35:43] heard the voice of God in that man
[1:35:45] now God's entire coming is a secret
[1:35:49] and we got to get this it it's not a
[1:35:53] even though there's
[1:35:55] this message is full of publicity
[1:36:00] there's people who just want to be
[1:36:03] something and they want to be recognized
[1:36:06] and shown I am telling you
[1:36:10] that
[1:36:12] this Rapture is not going to be a public
[1:36:16] show
[1:36:21] our heavenly father is revealing this
[1:36:26] message to the bride in secret
[1:36:32] it's happening in here
[1:36:34] they're like literally believing the
[1:36:36] word that's being preached and they're
[1:36:38] going home and saying God let me live
[1:36:40] that word
[1:36:41] [Music]
[1:36:44] It's A Love Affair
[1:36:47] brother Brandon said the third poll will
[1:36:48] not be a public show
[1:36:51] the seventh seal the seventh seal came
[1:36:54] in three measures three parts which the
[1:36:57] last part is the coming of the Lord and
[1:36:59] he said that won't be a public show
[1:37:01] so we need to look at Christ in this
[1:37:04] word not with observation
[1:37:08] but we need to come in the spirit it's
[1:37:10] almost like if we could just have
[1:37:12] service the whole service and close our
[1:37:14] eyes
[1:37:15] and do nothing except listen for that
[1:37:18] voice to speak because every time our
[1:37:21] eyes open we're distracted about this
[1:37:22] and that right
[1:37:24] brother Brandon said in the message why
[1:37:26] are people so tossed about
[1:37:29] he said there was that the voice spoke
[1:37:31] to him and says now the first time I
[1:37:32] spoke with you you put your hands on the
[1:37:35] people and you told them what was wrong
[1:37:37] with them and the second poll why when
[1:37:40] you did you know you know the secrets of
[1:37:43] their hearts and I made you a seer
[1:37:46] before the people but you know you're
[1:37:48] always trying to explain it and you
[1:37:50] ought not to have done that
[1:37:51] said you made a public show of it
[1:37:57] brother Branham says I'm very sorry
[1:38:02] says I noticed to my left
[1:38:04] which would be to my right
[1:38:08] if I was on the platform a little a
[1:38:12] little wooden building
[1:38:14] and I seen that light
[1:38:16] and you all have a picture of it you
[1:38:18] know it I I have one picture in my
[1:38:21] office anybody wants to see it it's
[1:38:23] always in the meetings I've seen that
[1:38:25] light leave me and go to that building
[1:38:29] and the voice said to me I'll meet you
[1:38:33] there and that'll be the third poll
[1:38:37] and brother Brandon said why
[1:38:39] and he said
[1:38:41] it won't be a public show like the
[1:38:43] others
[1:38:47] what God is going to do for the bride
[1:38:50] isn't going to be a public show
[1:38:54] we have got to start getting serious and
[1:38:57] sincere with God Alone
[1:39:01] this word has got to mean more to us
[1:39:03] it's a love affair and we've got to meet
[1:39:06] God in that secret place
[1:39:10] in the message the seventh seal he said
[1:39:12] we're at the end
[1:39:15] the opening of the seventh seal
[1:39:18] now how did I know the other day last
[1:39:21] Sunday a week ago today when I was
[1:39:23] preaching on be humble be humble
[1:39:25] remember God deals with those little
[1:39:27] things he says I didn't realize it
[1:39:30] what I was talking about and now I see
[1:39:33] it it's in such a humble way so if you
[1:39:36] want to read that that was God hidden
[1:39:38] Simplicity then revealed and the same so
[1:39:41] God was saying things that he didn't
[1:39:43] even realize why he was saying it but
[1:39:44] God Was preparing the bride for the for
[1:39:47] the for the masses for the seals
[1:39:52] now at the end seal the seventh seal
[1:39:54] when it starts it's a three-fold manner
[1:39:57] will be absolutely a total Secret
[1:40:02] it's according to the Bible That's What
[1:40:03] brother Brandon said he said it was so
[1:40:06] great
[1:40:07] tilt was Kept Secret from the angels
[1:40:14] now why if Satan should get a hold of it
[1:40:16] he might do great damage there is one
[1:40:19] thing he don't know
[1:40:21] he can interpret anything he wants to
[1:40:23] and he can personally any kind of gift
[1:40:26] but he can't know this it's not even
[1:40:29] written in the word it's a total Secret
[1:40:34] the Bible says that not no man knoweth
[1:40:38] the day or the hour not even the angels
[1:40:41] in heaven know when he's coming
[1:40:48] it'll be impossible
[1:40:51] for any minister to stand up and say
[1:40:55] he's coming tomorrow
[1:40:58] and even if it were to happen my
[1:41:02] question to you is
[1:41:04] would you be ready
[1:41:06] in 24 hours
[1:41:13] what is the purpose for coming to church
[1:41:15] heavy service
[1:41:18] we're coming to get the word to hear the
[1:41:21] word to become the word
[1:41:25] when Jesus told Peter he said flesh and
[1:41:28] blood is not revealed this to you Peter
[1:41:30] but my Father which is in heaven he has
[1:41:33] revealed it and Upon This Rock I'll
[1:41:35] build my church his church and the gates
[1:41:38] of hell should not Prevail against it
[1:41:40] well the Rapture is a revelation it will
[1:41:44] be given to you by the father
[1:41:47] now I want to just say this don't sit
[1:41:49] around waiting hoping that that last
[1:41:52] moment time that God will just give you
[1:41:55] the okay to hear that voice
[1:41:59] you ought to come to church every
[1:42:00] service with that expectation amen God I
[1:42:04] want to hear from you because I know the
[1:42:06] word that you're giving me today is
[1:42:07] going to get me dressed for the Rapture
[1:42:09] coming tomorrow
[1:42:12] and this this message is is to provoke
[1:42:15] us
[1:42:16] to provoke us
[1:42:19] to dig in with Christ
[1:42:22] dig in more don't allow this famine
[1:42:25] that's in the land this I'm not hearing
[1:42:28] from the Lord will do something about it
[1:42:31] do something about it I got to hear from
[1:42:33] you Lord I got to get more serious
[1:42:35] God is not going to come by
[1:42:38] John Martin's house and says hey look
