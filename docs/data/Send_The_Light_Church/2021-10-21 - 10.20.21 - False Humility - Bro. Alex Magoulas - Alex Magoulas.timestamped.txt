[0:14] possible
[0:16] jesus
[0:18] is here
[0:21] aren't you glad for that tonight
[0:23] i know that he's here and our gathering
[0:25] together is not in vain
[0:27] amen if he weren't here we would just be
[0:29] having a lodge meeting or something
[0:31] tonight
[0:32] i mean you could go do that anywhere but
[0:34] to know that he's here amen that's what
[0:36] makes all the difference since he's here
[0:38] and we're here why don't we just go
[0:39] ahead and bow our heads for word of
[0:40] prayer this evening look to him now
[0:44] lord we are so grateful that you've
[0:46] brought us here tonight lord even in the
[0:47] natural that you've kept us safe
[0:49] throughout the day and washed over each
[0:51] of us different ones that have gone to
[0:53] jobs and have driven in different things
[0:55] lord we look at our life on this earth
[0:57] our it's like a vapor lord our frame is
[1:00] but dust we're such fragile beings in
[1:02] the natural and we don't even realize it
[1:04] so many times
[1:06] how how closely we uh we come to even
[1:09] the end of our our natural life on this
[1:11] earth but lord the scripture says that
[1:14] you shall give your angels charge over
[1:15] us to keep us in all our ways the
[1:17] scripture says all so that the angel the
[1:19] lord campeth around about them that fear
[1:22] him and delivereth them and we're
[1:24] thankful for deliverance tonight we're
[1:26] thankful that you've ordered every
[1:27] footstep the footsteps of a good man
[1:29] there ordered of the lord father and
[1:31] you've brought us here to this place
[1:33] this divine appointment this evening and
[1:35] father since we've gathered together we
[1:37] know that you keep all of your
[1:39] appointments and we just ask now as
[1:40] we've invited you and we've made a place
[1:43] for you tonight that you'd be welcome
[1:44] into our midst lord what a travesty
[1:47] would be to invite you and to come
[1:49] before you in prayer and ask you to come
[1:51] tonight and then let you sit with
[1:53] unwashing feet tonight to let you be
[1:55] neglected we want to give attendance to
[1:57] the reading of the word into doctrine to
[1:59] your presence tonight and father in the
[2:01] name of jesus christ we just ask that
[2:03] you would be magnified in this place
[2:05] that something of eternal value would be
[2:08] said to edify and to encourage your
[2:10] believers to give direction
[2:12] and strength to us and father we would
[2:15] be remiss if we didn't thank you lord
[2:18] for all that's said and done tonight we
[2:19] committed into your hands we give you
[2:22] all the praise and the glory and the
[2:23] honor bless the reading of your word now
[2:26] and the utterance thereafter we ask in
[2:28] jesus christ's name
[2:30] amen if you have your bibles this
[2:31] evening we'll just get straight into
[2:34] i'll have you turn to colossians the
[2:35] second chapter
[2:37] while you're turning there i want to
[2:38] read psalm 118 i'll just go and read it
[2:40] to you for the sake of time but
[2:42] the scripture says the lord is on my
[2:44] side
[2:45] i will not fear
[2:47] what can man do unto me amen
[2:51] colossians chapter two we're going to
[2:53] read verses 18 and 19 tonight i didn't
[2:56] know if i was going to preach this or
[2:58] what and sometimes as a minister you
[3:00] you're just not real sure but
[3:02] i i've kind of had this i've ministered
[3:05] on and kind of studied it recently and i
[3:06] felt real good about it so i'm just
[3:07] gonna preach it
[3:08] again tonight so the bible says here in
[3:11] colossians chapter two and we trust the
[3:13] word is always a blessing to us
[3:16] verse 18 the apostle paul by the spirit
[3:18] speaking he says let no man beguile you
[3:21] of your reward
[3:22] in a voluntary humility and worshipping
[3:25] of angels intruding into those things
[3:27] which he hath not seen
[3:29] vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind and
[3:32] not
[3:33] holding the head amen
[3:35] from which all the body by joints and
[3:37] bands having nourishment ministered and
[3:40] knit together increaseth with the
[3:43] increase of god
[3:45] so it doesn't just increase but it
[3:46] increases with the increase of god amen
[3:48] may the lord bless the readings words
[3:50] you're seated tonight
[3:52] i'd like to take a thought this evening
[3:54] based off this idea of voluntary
[3:56] humility or false humility tonight
[3:59] i thought i would look up the definition
[4:00] of this being of course the resident
[4:02] expert on humility
[4:05] i was talking to brother here one time a
[4:07] while back and he let me know that he
[4:09] was he was an expert on humility he said
[4:11] i'm so humble brother i wrote a book on
[4:13] he was joking of course but he said he
[4:15] wrote a book on it so that's that's
[4:17] about how some people are they're so
[4:18] humble they're proud of it
[4:20] so that's not what i'm trying to present
[4:22] tonight no don't get all skittish but
[4:23] god has a sense of humor too and
[4:26] god's got a sense of humor too amen some
[4:28] people they're so proud or they're so
[4:30] humble they're proud of it and they'll
[4:31] let you know that they're more humble
[4:33] than you and so that's kind of what this
[4:35] definition this idea of voluntary
[4:37] humility i looked it up and trying to
[4:39] get a better sense of it in the greek
[4:40] and it's akin to what jesus talked about
[4:42] he said when a hypocrite he said he said
[4:45] don't be like the hypocrites he said
[4:46] when they fast they disfigure their
[4:48] faces and now why do they do they have a
[4:51] purpose in doing that when they fast or
[4:53] they do religious things they want you
[4:55] to know just how miserable they are
[4:57] because and jesus tells you what they
[4:59] want to appear unto men to fast so
[5:03] they're not doing it for god they're
[5:04] doing it for you to see them do it
[5:07] and that's the idea this idea of
[5:08] asceticism or voluntary humility or a
[5:11] false humility jesus says they fast and
[5:14] they want you to know they fast so that
[5:16] you know they fast and jesus said their
[5:18] reward is that people see them do it
[5:21] so the reward is to be seen that way
[5:23] amen but he says but when you do it and
[5:25] when you pray whatever you do you're not
[5:27] doing it to be rewarded by men you do it
[5:29] so your father will see in secret and
[5:32] your father will reward you openly amen
[5:35] so the whole idea here of of a false
[5:37] humility is it's something that you do
[5:40] so that people will look at you and see
[5:42] something that you're not
[5:44] right amen
[5:45] so praise the lord the prophet isaiah
[5:47] talks about the same thing in isaiah the
[5:49] 15th chapter about a chosen fast there's
[5:51] a wrong reason to do it and there's a
[5:52] right and i'm not preaching on fasting
[5:54] and different things tonight but this
[5:55] idea of a self-imposed sense of humility
[5:59] it's for the express purpose to appear
[6:02] humble to others amen so this is why i
[6:04] say this what appears humble to men is
[6:07] not necessarily what is humble before
[6:09] the lord
[6:10] amen
[6:11] amen and so i preached the sermon a
[6:12] while back i don't know if i mentioned
[6:14] that but i just just throw this out here
[6:15] real quick it ties into this very idea
[6:17] there's a real difference between our
[6:19] reputation
[6:20] and our character
[6:22] our reputation is what everybody thinks
[6:25] about us
[6:26] but our characters who we actually are
[6:29] and it's not that your reputation is
[6:30] unimportant but it's unimportant
[6:32] compared to your character amen because
[6:35] we came into this world with nothing and
[6:37] when we leave the prophet said the only
[6:38] thing you're taking with you is your
[6:40] character
[6:42] you're not taking your reputation with
[6:44] you what everybody thinks about you oh
[6:46] he's just an anointed brother he's a
[6:48] great preacher she's a great singer
[6:49] they're this to that what people think
[6:51] about you doesn't matter amen
[6:54] we see it so many times we go to a
[6:55] funeral somebody wants to preach
[6:57] oh he was a good man he did this and he
[6:59] was like this and he might have been the
[7:01] lowest guy in town
[7:03] i mean we preach everybody into heaven
[7:05] it's like i told somebody a while back
[7:07] oh we gotta preach everybody who wants
[7:09] to stand there and say they're not in
[7:10] heaven i said well if you want me to say
[7:12] nice things about you the funeral give
[7:14] me something to work with
[7:16] because i'm not going to lie for you in
[7:18] the pulpit you know amen but we present
[7:20] this oh they're such a great person and
[7:22] they are dedicated and they are helping
[7:24] the community but i want you to
[7:26] understand those things don't put them
[7:28] anywhere
[7:29] and they don't put you there and then
[7:31] what a person thinks about you does not
[7:33] determine your eternal destination but
[7:36] the character that you have and many
[7:37] times this is why i'm saying this many
[7:39] times your character might not always
[7:41] match what people think is your
[7:43] reputation
[7:44] i want you to understand our lord jesus
[7:46] had a reputation as an illegitimate
[7:48] child as a renegade as a troublemaker he
[7:52] wasn't the kind old priests
[7:54] that come and kiss the names and come
[7:56] when you were sick he's the one flipping
[7:58] tables and causing trouble i did preach
[7:59] about that last time
[8:01] amen he had a
[8:02] bad reputation get any good thing come
[8:06] out of nazareth
[8:08] praise the lord amen
[8:11] so your reputation is what people think
[8:13] you're about your characters who you are
[8:15] and i want you to notice jesus lets you
[8:16] know hypocrites are more concerned about
[8:19] their reputation than their character
[8:22] their great need is not to be humble but
[8:25] for you to think that they're humble
[8:27] that's their need
[8:28] amen praise the lord brother branham
[8:30] says this and the meanest man i know in
[8:32] 1962 he says i think
[8:34] that's what's the matter with all of us
[8:36] today the churches we don't associate
[8:39] our associate ourselves in enough in
[8:42] real humility not a false but something
[8:45] that you stay there until something's
[8:47] happened to you humilities is too much
[8:49] wind and thunder and not enough still
[8:52] small voices i think that's true we look
[8:54] and now he tells you this we look and
[8:56] see that it's true because the fruit
[8:59] that it bears upon our people somehow
[9:02] it's just isn't what it i'm sorry
[9:03] somehow it isn't just like it used to be
[9:06] right
[9:07] and then we sit here all the good old
[9:08] days it's not like what it used to be
[9:10] used to be this way well what changed
[9:12] amen people's at it thank you brother
[9:14] people's attitudes their expectations
[9:16] their approach to god has changed amen
[9:19] god didn't change
[9:21] the word of god didn't change but
[9:23] people's approach to god what people
[9:25] value amen this nation was founded on a
[9:28] principle of religious freedom and
[9:29] people suffered and died for this and
[9:31] you can't hardly get in the mood for the
[9:33] word of god nowadays they're moved by
[9:34] entertainment they're moved by politics
[9:37] moved by every false show of humility
[9:39] and and you gotta this guy's you know he
[9:41] gets up here and he kisses the babies
[9:43] and we're gonna sign this bill and we
[9:44] gotta get all these people we're
[9:46] impressed with hollywood and glitter and
[9:48] glamour all the wrong things
[9:51] and then we sit there wondering why is
[9:52] it different it's because the people
[9:53] have valued the wrong thing
[9:56] what changed people embraced pretense
[9:59] over authenticity
[10:01] we've accepted edificate or
[10:03] entertainment
[10:04] over edification amen we took this very
[10:06] concept of humility like these pharisees
[10:09] like these hypocrites we took the very
[10:10] concept of humility and we we
[10:12] homogenized it we packaged it we market
[10:15] it and we labeled it we advertise it you
[10:17] can be as humble as me if you buy my
[10:19] book amen
[10:21] well if you can do this if i could be
[10:22] like this person i and we we we've
[10:24] marketed like we do everything else in
[10:26] america we've marketed this idea of
[10:28] humility until it looks nothing like
[10:30] what the bible said
[10:32] now i'm saying this for a reason because
[10:34] our culture pushes this especially upon
[10:37] our men
[10:38] you know listen if a man gets up and he
[10:40] voices his opinion he's a he's
[10:42] aggressive and he's a toxic man
[10:45] but it's okay for the woman to do that
[10:46] now
[10:47] so if the woman acts like a man supposed
[10:49] to it's okay but if a man acts like a
[10:51] man he's a bad person
[10:53] our whole culture is now centered on
[10:56] this idea of taking away a man's
[10:58] masculinity
[11:00] and even in the churches
[11:02] we're not allowed to say what we want to
[11:04] say we're not allowed to preach this
[11:06] bible because it's a hate crime but they
[11:07] can push every kind of nonsense and
[11:09] every kind of perversion and if you say
[11:12] something about it you're a troublemaker
[11:14] well you're just some stuck up holy
[11:16] roller no i'm humble enough to believe
[11:18] the word of god
[11:20] i just believe it the way god says it
[11:25] amen
[11:26] and many people even in churches they
[11:28] they compromise and they change this why
[11:31] because they're not looking to god for
[11:32] their reward
[11:35] they're looking at the almighty dollar
[11:36] or whatever it is popularity amen
[11:39] but for a person this is the thing when
[11:41] a man is truly humble a man that's truly
[11:43] humble or a woman that's truly humble
[11:45] they humble themselves to the word and
[11:47] the will of god because there's only one
[11:49] reward they're interested in
[11:50] it might not be the biggest church it
[11:52] might not be seven figures in their bank
[11:54] account but they've got one reward
[11:56] they're looking for at the end of the
[11:58] day at the end of their earthly journey
[12:00] they're looking at the guy in the
[12:01] balcony
[12:02] and they're looking to hear him say well
[12:03] done
[12:05] they're not worried about their
[12:06] reputation as much as they're worried
[12:08] about what the man in the balcony has to
[12:09] say
[12:11] listen what does it matter
[12:13] if the whole world embraces you
[12:15] and god rejects you
[12:17] what does it profit a man if you would
[12:19] gain the world and lose his own soul
[12:24] amen
[12:25] i think about brother talk about the
[12:26] value of a soul why would a man sell his
[12:28] soul it's only because he doesn't really
[12:30] realize the value of it
[12:32] it's no different than a modern day esau
[12:34] sold his birthright for a mesopotamia he
[12:36] didn't realize what the birthright was
[12:37] really worth
[12:39] that's why he didn't esteem the
[12:40] birthright
[12:41] amen
[12:43] and that's why you see so many churches
[12:44] today that either take grace and they
[12:46] turn into disgrace and lasciviousness
[12:48] and you can do whatever and all kinds of
[12:50] nonsense or we'll go the other way
[12:51] towards some sort of legalism and this
[12:53] and that they can't stay with the true
[12:55] message of grace amen i believe that's
[12:58] the message we have it's a true message
[13:00] of grace not a man's idea of a message
[13:02] of grace but it's the true grace of god
[13:05] amen and listen this is what i'm coming
[13:07] to you tonight listen churches they
[13:09] don't like the true preaching of grace
[13:11] do you know why churches don't like the
[13:13] true preaching of grace i'll tell you
[13:14] why because real grace biblical grace
[13:17] makes everything of jesus christ and
[13:19] nothing a man
[13:22] that's why they don't like it they want
[13:24] to have something to do with it or
[13:25] something they can they can inject their
[13:27] own ideas
[13:28] they can't just lay down and say you
[13:29] know i had nothing to do with this i'm
[13:31] here tonight by the grace of god and god
[13:34] alone
[13:35] you didn't choose him he chose you and
[13:37] he called you and he brought you out of
[13:39] the murdery clay
[13:41] but sea man wants to have a reputation
[13:43] oh he's you know he's a better this or
[13:45] he's a greater than that that's got
[13:47] nothing to do
[13:48] with the message of grace
[13:50] amen now listen your reputation might
[13:53] get you far in this life but it's
[13:55] meaningless before an almighty god who
[13:56] knows the very thoughts and intents of
[13:59] the heart because only your character
[14:00] will come i made this point the other
[14:02] day and i'm going to make it again you
[14:03] know sometimes i preach this stuff and
[14:05] huh maybe i've been thought of or
[14:07] accused at some point say brother you
[14:09] you come off kind of suspicious
[14:10] sometimes and i i made this point well i
[14:12] mean to
[14:13] amen
[14:15] listen this is the most ungodly
[14:17] deceiving wicked age there's ever been
[14:20] you've got five people a day that call
[14:22] you on your cell phone wanting to get
[14:24] your social security number or sell you

[14:38] internet everything son of god is trying
[14:40] to pull you away from this kingdom it's
[14:42] more deceiving today
[14:44] than it's ever been help me out somebody

[14:53] home right in your church right into
[14:55] your own life if you let him right
[14:59] well praise the lord
[15:01] listen uh a youth of growing up outside
[15:04] of church a youth of watching television
[15:07] advertising and and and watching the
[15:09] news tonight has filled me with a great
[15:10] sense of disbelief and the power of man
[15:12] to tell the truth i think it was georgia
[15:15] of course i'm not here to quote george
[15:16] orwell tonight but he said i noticed
[15:18] from an early age every time i read a
[15:19] newspaper it was wrong
[15:22] and that's about listen they're looking
[15:24] to sell you something and if they can
[15:26] lie to you and sell you more they're
[15:28] going to lie to you because they want
[15:29] money
[15:31] and churches preachers many of them in
[15:33] the same way
[15:36] oh praise the lord
[15:37] well listen brother brown saw an ad one

[16:39] what did he do he warns and he said i
[16:41] warned you day and night
[16:43] is that right don't forget watch listen
[16:46] paul he tells timothy amen i'll read it
[16:48] to you first timothy chapter four paul
[16:50] says now the spirit speaketh expressly
[16:53] that in the latter times some shall
[16:55] depart from the faith giving heed and
[16:57] seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
[17:00] speaking lies and hypocrisy having their
[17:03] conscience seared with a hot iron go to
[17:06] verse six for the sake of time but he
[17:07] goes through some of these things and
[17:08] paul makes this point i want you to
[17:10] catch this now he says if you put the
[17:12] brethren in remembrance of these things
[17:15] remind them of the deception remind them
[17:17] how it's supposed to be in the latter
[17:18] times if you remind them of these things
[17:20] put them in remembrance of these things
[17:22] thou shalt be a good minister of jesus
[17:26] christ nourished up in the words of
[17:28] faith and of good doctrine whereunto
[17:31] thou hast attained
[17:33] amen listen paul did not tell timothy
[17:36] that if you present some deep
[17:38] reasoned intellectual i'd be a
[17:40] theological argument and you just
[17:42] confound the people you'd be a good
[17:43] minister
[17:44] neither did he tell somebody listen if
[17:46] you just preach like a house on fire and
[17:48] get the people excited and they all just
[17:49] get behind and they love you oh man that
[17:51] should be a good ministry he didn't say
[17:53] that right
[17:54] amen
[17:55] see that's what we do listen well he
[17:57] this brother brother brown talks about
[17:59] that actually oh this brother he's so
[18:00] annoying and he just preaches like this
[18:02] and he makes the point hitler was
[18:03] anointed
[18:05] christian's annoyed listen heaven was a
[18:08] good preacher
[18:10] kirsten's a good preacher
[18:12] stalin's a good preacher listen they
[18:14] might listen
[18:15] that's what i'm coming to man there's a
[18:17] lot of difference between a good
[18:18] preacher and a good minister
[18:20] there's a lot of people they're good
[18:21] preachers but they're not very good
[18:23] ministers
[18:25] well praise the lord see that's their
[18:26] reputation oh he's a good preacher i've
[18:28] never heard anybody preach oh man he
[18:30] just saw this and he saw that that's the
[18:32] reputation but what's the character say
[18:35] because a minister is a servant and a
[18:37] true minister is looking to hear well
[18:39] then
[18:41] when nobody wants to hear it when nobody
[18:43] wants to believe it amen listen these
[18:45] men these apostles these prophets of old
[18:47] they didn't sit there and preach to a
[18:49] church like i'm preaching to you tonight
[18:51] where everybody just loves everything
[18:52] they had to say
[18:55] the people that pursued hated them for
[18:57] it
[18:57] they killed them for it but they did it
[19:00] anyway because they were faithful to the
[19:02] call of god
[19:05] what is the minister of servant amen
[19:07] listen my goal i'll just say this
[19:09] personally my goal
[19:10] in life is not to be a good preacher so
[19:12] much but to be a good minister to be
[19:15] faithful with the word of god amen and a
[19:17] good minister will remind you of the
[19:20] deception he'll remind you about
[19:22] seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
[19:24] amen because he's not trying to impress
[19:26] you he's not concerned about what you
[19:27] think about him he's concerned about
[19:30] your soul
[19:34] oh man this guy's a good preacher listen
[19:36] there's stadiums
[19:38] full of good preachers there's churches
[19:40] with 50 000 people and they got a good
[19:43] preacher and there's one person in the
[19:45] building even stayed
[19:51] hey man
[19:52] a good minister
[19:54] his reputation
[19:57] is not
[19:58] it doesn't influence his his approach to
[19:59] god amen his appraisal is from god that
[20:02] shall be a good minister amen as i
[20:05] mentioned acts chapter 20 paul he goes
[20:07] to these elders he says don't forget i
[20:09] was i said i warned you day and night
[20:13] hey man
[20:14] maybe they got tied up man paul you're
[20:15] just always saying the same thing but
[20:17] listen there was a reason for it brother
[20:19] ram talks about it in the fifth seal
[20:20] that stern little apostle he said he
[20:23] looked out into eternity and he saw it
[20:25] coming
[20:26] that's why he warned him
[20:28] that's why he put it out there listen
[20:30] i'm i'm not here to tell you tonight oh
[20:32] man you just be able to get away with
[20:33] anything nothing's coming your way
[20:35] everything that satan has
[20:37] all hell is against this revelation
[20:42] this man not only did he warn him day
[20:44] night but he with tears he said
[20:47] tears they warned them day and night
[20:48] what do you want them grievous wolves he
[20:50] said
[20:51] grievous wolves are going to come in and
[20:53] enter in not sparing the don't
[20:55] think for one second you taking a
[20:57] foothold it would be okay well we'll
[20:59] work it out he won't spare one if he
[21:01] could help it
[21:05] not sparing the flock
[21:07] he says also of your own
[21:09] selves
[21:10] oh praise the lord somebody didn't say
[21:12] if you get on cnn listen to don lemon
[21:15] hey man he didn't say if you listen to
[21:17] joe biden you're your favorite
[21:18] politician or your least favorite
[21:19] politician
[21:21] of your own selves
[21:23] shall men arise
[21:25] and what shall they do draw disciples
[21:27] after
[21:28] them
[21:31] amen well jesus says that false prophets
[21:33] they were sheep's clothing
[21:35] listen
[21:36] the grievous wolves don't wear grievous
[21:38] wolves clothing they wear sheep's
[21:39] clothing they look like you they sit in
[21:41] church with you they act like you
[21:43] they're 99.99
[21:46] with you
[21:48] hey man
[21:50] amen that's like i said look cnn's not
[21:52] drawing disciples we're doing this we're
[21:53] worried about everything out there amen
[21:55] what about what's trying to come in here
[21:58] not necessarily this building but i mean
[21:59] we're not exempt is what i'm trying to
[22:01] get at we're so worried about what
[22:02] culture and the popular ideas and
[22:05] hollywood says about it but of your own
[22:09] well praise the lord
[22:11] that's what i'm saying you know i
[22:13] somewhere in the message
[22:15] we got this idea that we're exempt from
[22:17] that like how well it can happen in a
[22:19] message church
[22:21] listen it's happening every age
[22:23] listen wherever men are it happens
[22:25] because that's what satan uses he uses
[22:27] men he's got ministers that look like
[22:29] ministers of life is that right
[22:31] well praise the lord
[22:33] every age they lose their first love men
[22:35] arise in the race they draw men after
[22:37] away from the lord amen
[22:38] and we act like well i'm not in the
[22:40] message church listen it's already
[22:42] happened in message churches
[22:44] you've got two souls and five souls and
[22:46] a hundred this and polygamy this and
[22:48] blasphemy this and thunder you've got
[22:50] every kind of thing
[22:52] and it calls itself message
[22:54] but it's
[22:55] the fruit of it it's not what it was
[22:58] it's not the bible
[23:00] amen and this is what i'm trying to say
[23:02] amen it has already happened
[23:05] and if it has happened before
[23:07] that means it can happen again and
[23:09] likely is happening now somewhere
[23:12] it's likely going on now amen and i it's
[23:15] like i had to i did a youth bible study
[23:18] here about a month or so a couple months
[23:20] back these young people
[23:22] you know they get raised in a certain
[23:24] church and they just they just take it
[23:25] for granted not just young people
[23:27] but even older people we just take it
[23:28] for granted oh you know the pastor would
[23:30] never lie to me well that's what all
[23:32] these people thought in their church too
[23:36] well the deacon or this star brothers oh
[23:38] brother so-and-so he's he's got this
[23:40] many people he's got a twitter account
[23:42] or whatever it is listen all these
[23:45] people thought the same thing and they
[23:46] were all deceived you've got to go back
[23:48] and you've got to see it in the word
[23:50] you've got to have a revelation for
[23:52] yourself amen
[23:55] well praise the lord brother graham says
[23:57] this
[23:58] he said anything that's unusual
[24:00] it springs up if it's called into
[24:02] question
[24:04] and i think it's no more than right it
[24:05] should be calling the question is it i
[24:07] think that pastors sometimes are
[24:09] suspicious of things that they hear and
[24:12] i think they have a right to be listen
[24:13] if your pastor's looking at something i
[24:15] don't know about that listen let's see
[24:17] he's doing his job is why
[24:19] hey man he's going to make sure he's
[24:20] being fed the right way
[24:22] but praise the lord
[24:24] he says they've got a right to be
[24:25] because if i understand the translation
[24:27] of the word pastor it means a shepherd
[24:29] therefore he is a feeder or a herder of
[24:31] a group of men and women of which the
[24:33] holy spirit has made him the overseer of
[24:35] and he has a right to know what kind of
[24:37] a food his sheep is getting and where
[24:39] it's coming from i think he has a right
[24:41] to what's this got to do with me well
[24:43] i'll read the next sentence if a pastor
[24:45] or sometimes people
[24:47] would just seem to be a little
[24:48] suspicious that should never bother
[24:50] anyone it should only be respects to the
[24:53] man's heart for a man of them that's
[24:55] standing there we'd question it amen
[24:58] i tried to be very careful for myself
[25:00] i'm just speaking for myself as a
[25:02] minister i try to be very careful that i
[25:04] don't ask people to trust me i want to
[25:06] trust the word of god some guys go oh
[25:08] you should just take my word for i i
[25:10] don't want you to take my word for it
[25:12] i'm actually kind of insulted like i'm
[25:13] just too stupid to deceive you listen if
[25:15] i say something you say you know what i
[25:17] want to see that in the word i say
[25:18] praise god somebody wants to read the
[25:20] bible
[25:21] somebody wants to hear a quote i say
[25:23] praise god listen paul when he come to
[25:25] the marines they were more noble than
[25:27] those in thessalonica they searched the
[25:30] scriptures they
[25:32] they said they don't offend me
[25:34] if a man wants to see it in the world i
[25:36] say praise god we all know i'll see it
[25:37] there
[25:40] well praise the lord
[25:42] that's the truth amen listen paul paul
[25:46] paul let you know for himself he said if
[25:48] we
[25:49] or an angel from heaven or anybody would
[25:51] preach it let's say he threw himself
[25:53] right in there
[25:54] he said don't even let me do it to you
[25:56] if it's a different gospel let him be
[25:58] cursed
[26:01] amen so i don't need
[26:03] you know people they do this it's like a
[26:05] bandwagon religion amen well we're in
[26:07] this camp we're in this camp we don't
[26:08] not to be doing that we're supposed to
[26:10] know better
[26:12] listen again i'll use paul paul himself
[26:15] at corinth he had the very same thing
[26:17] well we're with apollos's group
[26:19] and you have these other guys oh paul
[26:21] we're with you paul we're not with that
[26:22] group and the church that we're with
[26:24] paul's group hey hey paul we're right
[26:26] here with you we're behind you paul we
[26:28] love you more in that group and paul
[26:29] didn't say good job boys let's get over
[26:31] here we'll show them
[26:34] hey paul we're right behind you you know
[26:36] what you need to go repent
[26:39] you're being carnal amen i don't need
[26:41] you to rally behind me you follow me as
[26:44] i follow christ and if i don't follow
[26:46] christ you don't follow me
[26:47] paul doesn't need the acclamation he
[26:50] doesn't need his own followers he's
[26:52] looking for disciples of jesus christ
[26:58] and while we're being suspicious tonight
[26:59] i'll just be real honest with you some
[27:01] guy and i you know it's like anything
[27:03] else as a minister you have people that
[27:04] say oh brother i'm behind you you'll
[27:07] never fail please don't say that you put
[27:09] me in a bad spot amen oh brother i'm
[27:11] right behind you and i'll follow listen
[27:13] i don't need it and i don't want it i
[27:15] just want you to follow the word
[27:18] amen because even this apostle like i
[27:20] said he rebuked this idea these texts
[27:23] and this division and if he felt that
[27:25] way about then what is it today
[27:29] right and besides that most of the time
[27:31] some guy gets behind him oh man i'm
[27:33] wishing you know i'm right behind you
[27:35] behind you all the way he's usually not
[27:37] actually with you he's trying to sell
[27:38] you something he's a salesman amen
[27:40] brother brad said nine times out of ten
[27:42] he's the one causing the trouble
[27:45] well praise the
[27:46] lord amen what's this all got to do with
[27:48] humility
[27:50] well this is my message tonight amen
[27:53] now you've probably not heard this too
[27:55] many times preached this way but my
[27:57] message to you tonight is to quit being
[27:59] so humble
[28:02] because
[28:03] usually when i preach it somebody gets
[28:04] up and they're like amen
[28:06] somebody was waiting for this i don't
[28:07] wait for a preacher to tell me all these
[28:09] years quit being so humble
[28:12] now let me qualify now amen now i'm
[28:14] making a point we humble ourselves too
[28:17] much
[28:18] towards men
[28:20] and not enough to god
[28:22] because we fear men more than we fear
[28:24] god
[28:27] amen that's why it ain't like it used to
[28:29] be
[28:30] that's the false humility amen it's not
[28:33] what it used to be it's not quite the
[28:34] same because people have lost the fear
[28:36] of god they fear men they fear politics
[28:39] they fear they fear everything in the
[28:41] world but they don't fear god
[28:46] so and that's what i'm getting at i
[28:47] don't believe in being fake humble hey
[28:48] man if i'm arrogant i'm just gonna admit
[28:49] it i guess
[28:51] it's better than being fake humble
[28:53] hey man listen i made this point on the
[28:55] way up here to my wife i said most
[28:56] message people i'm just be real honest
[28:58] with you now most message people they're
[29:00] just too nice
[29:01] we're just too nice we're always trying
[29:03] to be nice to every and get along when
[29:05] we don't cause trouble well the bible
[29:07] says there's as much as within you you
[29:09] should live peacefully with all men and
[29:11] i'm like that supposedly this there's a
[29:13] point somewhere that you can't live
[29:15] peacefully with all men or would you say
[29:17] live peacefully with all men but it
[29:18] doesn't say that if you can do it
[29:21] because there comes a place in a
[29:23] christian life as a christian you've got
[29:25] to stand and be identified and bear the
[29:28] reproach of this word
[29:29] listen there are going to be times in
[29:31] your life where you can't play nice
[29:33] because you've got to stand for the
[29:34] truth
[29:37] praise the
[29:38] lord well hallelujah
[29:42] see most people in church are just too
[29:44] nice that's why so much foolishness goes
[29:47] on in the first place we just permit it
[29:51] well praise the lord i'll give you some
[29:52] quotes so you can say amen tonight it's
[29:54] like i heard a brother the other day if
[29:55] you can't say amen you should at least
[29:57] say ouch
[29:58] amen
[30:00] brother braham says this a lot of people
[30:01] has the wrong impression of christ some
[30:04] people think that christ was a
[30:06] christ was the greatest of all men he
[30:09] was the example man not only was he man
[30:13] but he was god man he was god with us
[30:16] emmanuel he was the humblest of all men
[30:20] but
[30:21] you can be too humble
[30:25] oh there that's a good quote
[30:27] phew you can be too humble you can get
[30:30] so humble until the devil would make a
[30:32] puppet out of you
[30:35] he was humble enough to wash the
[30:36] disciples feet he was forgiving enough
[30:38] to pray for those who drove spikes in
[30:40] his hands but he was man enough to plate
[30:42] ropes and run the money changers out of
[30:45] the house
[30:48] now i'm just i'm just using these quotes
[30:50] and these this one's like about deacons
[30:52] but this pertains to us because he's
[30:54] talking about this idea here but the
[30:55] mayor talks about this in church order
[30:56] in 1963 he talks about jesus actually
[30:59] he's shown as a type when he does that
[31:01] as a type of being a deacon and he's
[31:03] ordained these deacons and brother bram
[31:04] says this he says now i know he says
[31:06] look i'm not saying it dishonorably by
[31:08] you trustees or deacons or pastor but
[31:11] i'm just telling you see what's truth
[31:13] and this is what it must be he says what
[31:15] does it he says no everybody's talking
[31:17] to these deacons and stuff these
[31:18] trustees he says everybody you all good
[31:20] natured every one of you men are good
[31:23] natured if it wasn't so i'd say well all
[31:25] but brother stone so in other words if
[31:27] you weren't good nature we'd yeah we're
[31:28] not going to have this guy
[31:30] all the brothers so he's not got a good
[31:32] nature we're all praying for him
[31:35] it's funny he says but you do have good
[31:37] natures and you're long-suffering
[31:40] gentle quiet sort of men that's fine but
[31:43] don't be a with that
[31:48] amen jesus was good in nature too
[31:51] but when it come time to say things it
[31:53] is written my father's house is made a
[31:56] house of prayer and you're making it a
[31:58] den of thieves see he didn't know when
[32:00] to speak and when not to now i'm just
[32:03] going to drop this in here that's
[32:04] usually where we get it mixed up we
[32:05] usually speak when we shouldn't and we
[32:07] don't when we should
[32:09] but jesus knew when to speak and when
[32:11] not to
[32:13] that's what we got to do never was a
[32:15] person like jesus he was god and
[32:17] remember talk about being a dick in the
[32:19] church he took over he put some ropes
[32:22] together and he didn't wait to gently
[32:24] walk them out he beat them out of the
[32:26] house of god
[32:30] amen praise the lord
[32:32] again brother brahma says in 58 church
[32:34] order the pastor must be a man that's
[32:36] got a very humble way about him but not
[32:39] too humble
[32:40] but what it could be like the lord jesus
[32:42] when he seen wrong going on in the
[32:44] church he played the ropes and ran them
[32:46] out of the church
[32:49] amen again brother graham says the very
[32:51] first step to successful christianity to
[32:54] show that a man has received the holy
[32:55] spirit is humility real god given
[32:58] humility it must be given humbly but yet
[33:02] a church without a doctrine it's like a
[33:04] jellyfish it has no backbone you've got
[33:08] to have a backbone in it
[33:11] god talked to moses brother man says
[33:13] that's what's the matter with the church
[33:14] tonight we got a wishbone instead of the
[33:16] backbone what we need is something in
[33:18] there that'll stand you up
[33:20] he says amen
[33:22] every man that's ever amounted to a hill
[33:25] of beings had to fight for what he got
[33:28] god don't give it to you on a silver
[33:31] platter
[33:33] listen we own ourselves too much to men
[33:36] and not enough to god amen we're gonna
[33:38] humble ourselves to god and a man that
[33:40] will humble himself to god will
[33:42] occasionally humble himself to man and
[33:44] sometimes he'll stand right up in their
[33:46] face
[33:47] depending on what the will of god is
[33:48] amen
[33:49] if you humble yourself to god god might
[33:51] have you humble to this man if you're
[33:52] wrong or he might have you getting his
[33:54] face in tom he's wrong just like john
[33:56] the baptist did king ahead
[34:00] if you're humble to god then you're pro
[34:02] the whole thing praise the lord i'll
[34:04] give you this example brother brand was
[34:05] at the chicago ministerial association
[34:07] one day and you probably know this story
[34:09] but the lord showed brother man i think
[34:10] it's three days prior that they were
[34:12] laying this trap for him they were going
[34:13] to question him on the serpent scene the
[34:14] preaching of grace and predestination
[34:17] and all these different things the
[34:18] initial evidence and so he saw this in
[34:20] the vision he knew there was a trap they
[34:22] were going to change the location
[34:23] they're going to try to trap him he
[34:25] tells these two other brothers and
[34:26] they're like well man we don't even want
[34:27] to go now and the one quarter of the
[34:29] rams talking about is billy paul come up
[34:30] to him and it's funny how a teenage son
[34:32] how he acts but billy paul says oh
[34:34] you're going to go over there and fuss
[34:35] with him
[34:36] because you know how brother man thought
[34:37] about fuss and see we do that we justify
[34:39] that well i don't want to fuss with
[34:41] people but the map said we don't fuss
[34:43] well that's true but that's not what
[34:44] brother bram was going to do
[34:46] oh daddy you're gonna go over there and
[34:47] fuss with them people he said no i'm not
[34:49] going to fuss i'm going over there to
[34:51] guard the mercy seat i've got the word
[34:54] of god i'm anointed by the spirit i'm
[34:55] going over there to guard that mercy
[34:57] saint
[34:59] listen there's a time to be silent but
[35:00] there's a time to speak
[35:02] what we need is some men of god what we
[35:05] need is some women of god that'll go
[35:07] mercy seat in their homes guard this
[35:10] mercy seat in their church go to this
[35:11] mercy seat in their own lives don't let
[35:14] the devil take one thing from you
[35:17] if god give it to you if it's your
[35:19] possession by the grace of god you don't
[35:21] have to humbly well you know i better
[35:22] share with the devil he don't have one
[35:24] thing to do with it
[35:27] that's not you being nice that's not you
[35:29] being humble that's a compromiser
[35:32] it's a compromising cowardly unbelieving
[35:35] spirit that's right amen amen
[35:38] well praise the lord
[35:40] there's a time to be silent but there's
[35:41] a time to speak amen that's what peter
[35:43] dealt with then the booger acts when
[35:46] they when he goes and raises the man up
[35:47] to the gate beautiful and the elders
[35:48] take him aside
[35:50] he said we don't want you to teach in
[35:51] this then we don't want you to do this
[35:52] and peter said listen we can't but speak
[35:55] the things which we have stealing hard
[35:58] i'm obligated to speak what i've seen
[36:00] whether it be right in the sight of god
[36:03] to listen unto you more than god you
[36:05] know judge we cannot but speak the
[36:08] things which we have seen and heard
[36:11] that's why i can't hold my peace about
[36:12] this message that's why i can't
[36:14] compromise it i'm a witness of what it's
[36:16] done for me i'm a witness of what it's
[36:18] done for others i can't hold my peaks i
[36:21] can't back up on it i can't change it
[36:23] for no man
[36:26] not arrogance that's humility when you
[36:28] used to say you know what i'm going to
[36:30] stand on the word of god no matter what
[36:31] anybody says about it no matter what
[36:33] anybody thinks the word will accuse you
[36:35] of being arrogant but that's humility
[36:42] amen
[36:43] listen the prophet samuel one day he
[36:45] he'd been crying all night
[36:48] kind of like paul
[36:49] he got up one day and
[36:51] the next day he goes down to
[36:52] the armies of israel and king saul's
[36:54] down there he's just gone to the uh
[36:57] malachites and
[36:58] god had told him to utterly destroy
[37:00] everything man woman child whatever and
[37:02] he goes down there he defeats these
[37:03] armies but he takes the best of the
[37:05] flocks and the women and all these
[37:06] things he picked them for a spoil and
[37:09] samuel he shows up at the camp knowing
[37:11] that he's known this man has been
[37:12] rejected he shows up and says what is
[37:15] the meaning this bleeding of the sheep
[37:17] and the longing of the oxen and samuel
[37:20] he says i've taken these things
[37:22] before the lord i did this for god
[37:24] oh i know god said this but i did this
[37:26] thing but i did it for the lord it's
[37:28] okay
[37:29] i'm here to bless god
[37:32] since what we do well yeah i know the
[37:34] bible says this but listen we we can
[37:36] have a bigger meeting we have a bigger
[37:37] this we can we can do we can do more if
[37:40] we just do this we're doing it for the
[37:42] lord
[37:44] samuel says does god delight in
[37:46] sacrifices
[37:47] and burn offerings
[37:49] to obey is better than soccer buddies
[37:53] amen
[37:54] oh what's the big deal god will accept
[37:56] it right
[37:57] brother bam talks about that young
[37:58] fellow said come to me but the man said
[38:00] that young fellow come oh god he just
[38:02] loves me so well
[38:04] brother graham said god is a good god
[38:06] that's true but he's a god of anger oh
[38:08] the god i think that'd be a good sermon
[38:10] title
[38:11] he's a god of anger too he's a god of
[38:14] judgment he's a god of wrath we
[38:17] fail to get that
[38:19] amen
[38:22] you make him so good till you make him
[38:24] some old dodie grandpa
[38:27] he's not a dirty grandfather he is
[38:30] almighty god he don't have no
[38:32] grandchildren he has sons and daughters
[38:34] of god not shook hands and adopted him
[38:37] you must be born again and the blood
[38:40] applied amen
[38:44] samuel tells him listen
[38:46] you've rejected the word of the lord
[38:48] god's rejected you from being king
[38:51] amen
[38:52] and it's at that point saul admits
[38:55] i want you to really catch this now
[38:57] saul admits the reason i did this
[38:59] actually says i feared the people
[39:02] amen
[39:03] i feared the people that see he feared
[39:06] the people more than he feared god
[39:09] he was so worried about brother bram
[39:10] says his pride and his popularity he
[39:13] feared what the people well the people
[39:14] are going to think something about it
[39:16] doesn't matter what the people think if
[39:18] god made you king only god can take you
[39:21] out of it
[39:23] amen
[39:27] he was more concerned about what men
[39:30] thought of him than what god did
[39:32] brothers and sisters that's not a humble
[39:34] man
[39:35] am i looking that's not a humble man
[39:37] that is a coward amen and i'd rather
[39:40] meet god as an infidel than a coward or
[39:42] a hypocrite
[39:44] amen
[39:46] real humility is not how much you can
[39:48] humble yourself to other men it's how
[39:49] much you can humble yourself to god
[39:52] and the will of god and as i said
[39:54] earlier sometimes that will cause you
[39:55] also to humble yourself to men amen
[39:58] but true humility the root or the cause
[40:01] of it it's it's that you humble yourself
[40:03] to god first amen
[40:05] amen
[40:06] to prove this just a few days later here
[40:09] comes another battle israel's got
[40:10] another battle just a few days later and
[40:12] there's a little shepherd boy by the
[40:13] name of david going now we all know the
[40:14] story of david and we love the story of
[40:16] david he goes down there and he sees
[40:18] this philistine and he tells king saul
[40:20] let no man's heart fail thy servant will
[40:23] go and fight
[40:25] amen
[40:26] and notice david's reputation
[40:29] with his own brethren oh we know the
[40:32] naughtiness of your heart
[40:35] you're just a not you're a troublemaker
[40:37] david oh he's the youngest of course so
[40:39] yeah no offense to the youngest here hi
[40:41] moses
[40:44] oh he's the youngest he's just he thinks
[40:46] he's a big shot he's trying to play with
[40:48] the big boy oh we know the naughtiness
[40:50] of your heart we know your pride david
[40:54] now notice they accused him not of
[40:55] humility but of pride
[40:58] and yet he was humble because he
[41:00] believed god because true humility
[41:03] always looks like pride to an unbeliever
[41:07] i mean if you're trying to look humble
[41:09] it's not going to look humble to the
[41:10] world they're going to think you're
[41:12] arrogant
[41:13] oh it's the pride of us david's pride
[41:16] he's just so stuck up believing god and
[41:19] he thinks he's all that now he was just
[41:21] humble enough to take god at his word
[41:27] he's just doing this to cause trouble he
[41:29] just thinks he's all that but i love
[41:30] david's response is there not a cause
[41:34] do i have a reason to do this listen
[41:36] i've got a reason to be here i'm going
[41:38] to reason listen tonight you and i
[41:40] haven't got a reason to be here what am
[41:42] i here because we think we're better
[41:43] than somebody we're not here for some
[41:45] religious pretense we're here because
[41:47] there's a reason we've got a cause to
[41:50] stand and believe this message and to
[41:52] preach a token and to confess it over
[41:55] our homes
[41:56] we've got a reason to stand and fight
[41:58] tonight
[41:59] not against flesh and blood blood
[42:01] principalities
[42:03] powers rulers of darkness
[42:08] god chose a few handful of people out of
[42:10] michigan
[42:11] defining its demon powers which if it
[42:14] existed since time immemorial
[42:18] you've got to cause the fight you're not
[42:19] arrogant you just believe god
[42:22] let them say what they want
[42:24] because at the end of the day they
[42:26] weren't singing songs about king saul
[42:28] they weren't singing songs about david's
[42:30] brethren they were singing solace saying
[42:32] the thousands but david ten thousands
[42:39] you might get called a renegade you're
[42:41] gonna you're gonna get accused of being
[42:42] arrogant but you're going to have a
[42:43] testimony
[42:45] and that testimony you're going to
[42:46] overcome by the blood of the lamb and
[42:48] the word of your testimony
[42:52] amen
[42:53] that's why paul could say i am not
[42:55] ashamed
[42:56] i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ
[42:59] it is the power of god and the salvation
[43:01] i don't have one reason to apologize or
[43:04] back up for this gospel
[43:08] now listen if david had gone there and
[43:10] said i'm going to do this brother said
[43:11] oh well we just think you're being
[43:12] arrogant he kind of well
[43:14] i don't want to think that about me
[43:16] what would have been the result of it
[43:19] i mean see he wasn't moved by what
[43:21] his brethren thought about him or even
[43:23] what the king thought about it
[43:25] now i'm just going to drop this in here
[43:26] real quick if you want to see if a
[43:28] person is really humble
[43:30] as opposed to fake humble or whatever
[43:33] you want to really know if a person has
[43:34] humility or they're humble you look at
[43:36] how they respond to two things how do
[43:38] they respond to criticism
[43:40] and how do they respond to flattery
[43:43] right because the way they respond that
[43:44] will show you if they're concerned about
[43:46] their reputation or if they're concerned
[43:47] about the will of god
[43:50] amen brother brown makes this i i i use
[43:52] this for a while i thought martin luther
[43:54] said brother graham talks about it
[43:55] actually it's a sermon the law having a
[43:58] shadow but he said brother bram says you
[44:00] are dead your life it's hid in god and
[44:03] sealed by the holy ghost he said how
[44:05] could the devil ever get to him brother
[44:06] ben uses this example he said did you
[44:09] ever hear a dead man tell a lie
[44:11] he said did you ever hear a dead man
[44:12] fuss back at you you could stand at his
[44:15] casket and fuss at him all night he will
[44:17] never say a word why he's
[44:20] dead listen if your life is hidden with
[44:23] christ and god and you're dead to the
[44:25] things of the world i can make fun of
[44:27] you all night long i can try to lift you
[44:29] up oh you're just so great and flatter
[44:31] you they don't move you any more than a
[44:33] dead man in a casket you're dead
[44:36] it doesn't affect you
[44:40] and if you've really died to the things
[44:41] of the world it don't matter if they
[44:42] love you and they make a god out of you
[44:44] or whatever or they want to make you the
[44:46] devil and shoelace they can say whatever
[44:48] they want it doesn't move you
[44:50] because you were never motivated by what
[44:52] they said in the first place
[44:58] amen
[45:00] it astounds me i drop this in here this
[45:02] astounds me it's incredible because
[45:04] people they they go to church and we sit
[45:06] here and people that sing songs about
[45:08] the devil and they testify with the
[45:09] devil this and then we'll just sit here
[45:11] talk about the devil all day long we'll
[45:12] fuss about the devil we'll shout about
[45:14] the devil we'll call him every kind of
[45:15] name in the book and run them down and
[45:17] listen
[45:19] i i see people do this i'm thinking why
[45:21] do they care
[45:22] what the devil says about him amen
[45:25] people in church i noticed this now even
[45:27] around the message message people forgot
[45:30] church people forgot the devil's not
[45:32] your biggest enemy
[45:34] satan is not your biggest enemy tonight
[45:37] you are your biggest enemy tonight
[45:40] well they said this
[45:42] listen if you're dead it doesn't matter
[45:44] you get this guy under submission
[45:47] you crucify this thing that stuff won't
[45:49] move here no more
[45:53] i can preach a whole nother sermon on
[45:54] that but people want to do that they
[45:55] want to fuss and they want to fuss and
[45:56] they want to fox we're going to fuss
[45:58] with the devil and brother brahm said he
[45:59] wants you to foster them as much as he
[46:01] wants
[46:02] if he could he gets you to fuss with
[46:03] them day and night he says it's like a
[46:05] snake if you got a snake you don't punch
[46:07] it you leave him alone
[46:09] listen he's already defeated
[46:12] we act like he's the boogeyman you are
[46:15] your own biggest enemy
[46:18] see we love to preach this oh it's us
[46:20] versus this and that's versus the no you
[46:22] crucify this guy
[46:24] you put him on a cross every day and you
[46:27] make sure he's dying and write it out
[46:29] the rest of that won't even move you
[46:31] brother ram said you're like a mystic
[46:32] you walk in a world alone you and god
[46:35] amen
[46:39] oh we love beating up the devil what
[46:42] about yourself no one wants to die
[46:44] like i always say we all want
[46:46] resurrection life but none of us want to
[46:47] die
[46:53] listen if you have died to self and you
[46:56] can rot out satan can't move you
[46:59] pop culture can't move you men's
[47:01] opinions can't move you politics can't
[47:03] move you you're not moved by what you
[47:05] see you're not moved by what you feel
[47:07] you're moved by one thing what you
[47:09] believe
[47:11] that's the only thing that moves the
[47:12] believer we walk not by sight but by
[47:15] faith
[47:19] so who is your real enemy then i'm
[47:20] saying this because i want you to
[47:22] understand where i'm coming from this
[47:23] idea of deception and all these things
[47:25] going on
[47:26] this this false humility why this is why
[47:28] i'm preaching the same and we we come
[47:30] from a country that's where i'm gonna
[47:32] kind of bring this to a head tonight we
[47:33] come from a country we went to the henry
[47:35] ford museum today we saw the
[47:37] the replica of the declaration of
[47:39] independence we live in this great
[47:40] country a country as i said earlier it
[47:42] was founded on religious freedom it was
[47:44] founded think about these men some of
[47:46] them were businessmen some of them were
[47:48] shopkeeps some were 39 years old some
[47:50] were 70 years old these men signed their
[47:52] name on a paper and defied the greatest
[47:55] nation and kingdom that was in the world
[47:57] at the time because they believed in the
[47:59] call that they were standing for
[48:02] this country out of this country america
[48:05] this i don't i've haven't checked out
[48:07] the number but we have sent more money
[48:10] for missions i'm talking about the whole
[48:11] country now throughout there are 200
[48:13] some years of existence we've sent more
[48:15] money we've had more preachers with some
[48:18] some of the greatest ministry that's
[48:19] ever been
[48:20] come out of this country
[48:22] will you bring it on this last church
[48:25] come out of america
[48:28] and i'm saying all this for a reason you
[48:30] look in america you look what god could
[48:32] have done with it and yet today in
[48:34] america
[48:35] by and large you go to most churches
[48:36] most of what calls itself christianity
[48:38] most of what calls itself christianity
[48:40] and america today has failed
[48:44] it's failing brothers and sisters it's
[48:47] hardly anything like it used to be amen
[48:49] it's not what it used to be
[48:52] amen we've we've done more we've god is
[48:54] god has waved every kind of assignment
[48:56] from this generation
[48:57] let's we've got the message in our own
[49:00] language and yet it's more and more
[49:03] christianity has failed in america
[49:06] most churches today are about as
[49:08] christian as disney and hallmark
[49:12] i'm saying all this now listen
[49:14] churches in america used to be the
[49:16] primary influence of our culture
[49:18] amen people went to church on sunday
[49:20] they went to church on wednesday they
[49:22] heard the word of god they based their
[49:24] lives and their decisions maybe they
[49:26] were even just raised that way and they
[49:27] weren't even it but they were our laws
[49:30] in this country the women conducted
[49:32] themselves that was the greatest
[49:33] influence in our country but somewhere
[49:35] that changed amen now america's greatest
[49:38] influences of their culture is media and
[49:40] entertainment and all this stuff
[49:43] now this is why i'm saying this we tend
[49:46] in church we blast that all these the
[49:48] the television and the news and the
[49:50] radio and all the stuff but here's what
[49:52] i want you to understand christianity in
[49:54] america has not failed because of
[49:56] hollywood
[49:59] it's not failing because of liberal
[50:00] politicians or socialism or communism or
[50:04] foreign interference america in america
[50:07] christianity is failing
[50:09] because christian men stopped acting
[50:11] like men
[50:12] amen
[50:14] well these guys do this no you've got it
[50:16] backwards christian men stopped acting
[50:17] like christian men that's why all these
[50:19] influences took over
[50:21] they let the bars down the goats listen
[50:23] we we want to demonize everything else
[50:26] but christian men stopped acting like
[50:28] men christian women stopped acting like
[50:30] ladies that's why it all come in
[50:33] you've got no one to let not us
[50:35] personally i'm saying necessarily but
[50:36] we've got no the churches they've got no
[50:39] one to blame but themselves
[50:42] why is the wise why does america listen
[50:44] to the hollywood star why are they
[50:45] listening because you all let the bars
[50:47] down
[50:50] well praise the lord
[50:52] you say i don't know about that i got a
[50:53] quote for you here so praise the lord
[50:56] i'm ready i got my ammunition
[50:58] brother man says don't worry
[50:59] about communism whipping us
[51:01] we done whipped ourselves
[51:04] it's our own rotten morals and where did
[51:06] it start from because the gospel was let
[51:09] down at the pulpit where it began
[51:12] sissified preachers with not enough real
[51:14] baptizing of the holy spirit in their
[51:16] soul to stand and tell the word of god
[51:21] listen i get it we see all these
[51:23] millennials and this that and they're
[51:24] dumb they don't know anything well who
[51:25] didn't teach them that's right that's
[51:27] good
[51:28] brother brown said don't spank the child
[51:30] for juvenile delinquently speak the
[51:32] parents it's parent delinquency they let
[51:35] them get by with it
[51:37] he said that's the reason i wreck across
[51:39] that clergy there how can you read the
[51:41] same bible i am
[51:44] some of those 400 prophets down there in
[51:46] israel read the same bible that mike kai
[51:48] read but he was willing spiritually to
[51:51] take his stand
[51:53] amen
[51:54] he said amos in his day that fearless
[51:57] prophet of god he walked up there to
[51:59] samaria he looked over that city he's
[52:02] seen all the corruption that was in it
[52:04] he said the very god that you claim that
[52:07] you love will destroy you
[52:15] well that's denomination that's
[52:16] pentecostals listen like i said i'm
[52:18] saying with them nothing more to come
[52:19] right into message church he's done it
[52:21] before
[52:22] you are not exempt because you have a
[52:25] 1963 cloud on the wall or the hoffman's
[52:28] head of christ inside that does not
[52:29] accept you
[52:32] it takes the baptism of the holy ghost
[52:34] and the word of god and if we let down
[52:36] the bar one inch
[52:38] we have allowed a place that's why the
[52:40] bible says be angry and sin not don't
[52:43] give place to wrath amen don't let the
[52:46] sun go down your wrath neither give
[52:48] place to the devil
[52:50] listen he can only take what you let him
[52:53] take
[52:55] it's no different than israel today
[52:57] they've had a six days war they've had
[52:59] all kinds of aggressors and they have
[53:00] possessed land but over the years
[53:02] they've compromised for peace well we
[53:04] just need to give up a little bit we
[53:06] just need to give this back and their
[53:08] enemies are the ones that come against
[53:09] them first
[53:11] and we'll do the same thing with this
[53:12] model
[53:14] well you know i know the message says
[53:15] this but i don't want people to think
[53:16] i'm a fanatic
[53:18] why do you care they're not the ones
[53:20] that dictate where you're going to the
[53:21] end of your life
[53:24] well i don't want to get persecuted well
[53:25] all that live gothic christ listen we
[53:28] don't i'm just gonna be real honest with
[53:30] you we don't even have it hardly as bad
[53:33] as they have some places even the world
[53:34] today we get so worried well i don't
[53:36] want to offend somebody well woe under
[53:39] them who are offended in him we should
[53:42] be worried about attending god and not
[53:44] other man
[53:46] that's right i know what this preacher
[53:48] to do
[53:49] a bunch of sissies
[53:51] that's all it is
[53:55] well praise the lord you look at our
[53:56] food you look at you look at men in
[53:58] their estrogen
[54:00] i'm gonna go on a rant now i guess
[54:02] hey man listen it's like i said our
[54:03] whole culture has been designed to
[54:05] sissify the man do you know why because
[54:08] he's more pliable when the government
[54:10] wants to do whatever we want well we
[54:11] don't want to fight we don't want to
[54:12] hurt nobody man we used to shoot people
[54:15] for raising our taxes
[54:19] what's the truth
[54:21] i got in trouble for this last time i'm
[54:23] not advocating violence tonight
[54:27] listen it's it's it's by satan's eating
[54:30] is by design
[54:32] he doesn't want you to stand on the word
[54:34] of god in the face of adversity
[54:36] he wants you to go with the flower well
[54:38] don't hurt nobody's feelings
[54:40] moving to safe space there's no safe
[54:42] space in the tribulation but a rapture
[54:45] to get you out of here
[54:52] listen brother brown said if we can
[54:55] you know we would preach or an
[54:57] invincible army brother bram said so
[54:58] well what he actually said was if she if
[55:01] the bride knows who she is what she
[55:03] stands for she can do the great works
[55:05] she'll be an invincible army if she can
[55:08] discern and withst stand
[55:12] not discern and politely ask well you
[55:14] know maybe we could maybe we could
[55:16] compromise a little bit maybe we could
[55:17] just you know
[55:19] get along with people you know brother
[55:20] you just you're just you're just always
[55:22] causing trouble so did jesus
[55:25] listen when they come to the house of
[55:27] jason the book of acts they said these
[55:29] that have turned the world
[55:30] upside down that have come
[55:33] bunch of rivalrizing troublemakers
[55:39] well praise the lord
[55:42] discern and with listen if you can
[55:44] discern and withstand
[55:46] the antichrist spirit satan is just as
[55:49] powerless before you
[55:51] as he was back there on the shores of
[55:52] galilee
[55:54] hey man
[55:56] i said we get rid of the fear and the
[55:58] scare in our lives and our homes let's
[56:00] serve god let's let's humble ourselves
[56:02] according to the word of god amen
[56:05] my humility i don't oh there's a brother
[56:07] he's so humble he's just so sweet what i
[56:09] want is there's a brother that believes
[56:10] god no matter what anybody else says
[56:12] about it there's a sister that takes god
[56:14] at his word and believes what she's
[56:16] prayed no matter what everybody else
[56:18] says about it
[56:20] that's the kind of testimony we gotta
[56:21] have tonight amen
[56:23] familiar quote tonight brother branham
[56:25] says this he says how we need in
[56:27] jeffersonville i see how we need here
[56:28] tonight in fenton
[56:30] how we needed jefferson for thousands of
[56:32] live voices the thunder of god
[56:34] thundering on sweetness and holiness
[56:37] purity
[56:38] undefiled lies walking around the earth
[56:41] today without a blemish
[56:43] yes sir real christians that's thunder
[56:46] against the enemy
[56:48] i'm going somewhere he says the devil
[56:50] don't care
[56:51] how loud you can holler
[56:54] the devil we do i'm gonna show the devil
[56:56] listen i don't need to show him anything
[56:59] what i praise the lord
[57:01] we do this like we're gonna give him
[57:02] well hallelujah
[57:04] somebody's gonna get mad at this i guess
[57:05] we do this well i'm gonna go give him a
[57:07] black guy i'm gonna show him i'm gonna
[57:09] show him nothing he's already defeated
[57:13] you you don't have to defeat him tonight

[57:18] he's defeated
[57:21] oh i'll show him you want to show him
[57:23] live this kind of a life
[57:25] oh i could shout i could listen so could
[57:27] the prophets are male but only one of
[57:29] them people could call down fire from
[57:30] heaven
[57:33] why at your word lord i've done this
[57:38] the devil don't care how loud you can
[57:40] holler i mean you can still holler now
[57:42] man but i'm just saying
[57:44] satan's not impressed but he's not
[57:45] impressed
[57:47] by how loud you can get or how smart you
[57:49] are doesn't even move him
[57:53] i gotta finish this quote sometime
[57:54] tonight
[57:55] you don't care how much you can jump or
[57:57] how much you can do this or shot but
[57:58] what hurts the devil is to see that
[58:00] sanctified holy life consecrated to god
[58:04] say anything to him call him anything
[58:07] just as sweet as can be and move right
[58:09] on
[58:10] oh my that throws him away that's the
[58:13] thunder that shakes the devil
[58:17] now watch this because the people like
[58:18] this he said the same quote keep going
[58:20] here he says just like well you say well
[58:23] if he could preach like a billy graham
[58:24] or an oral roberts or somebody a great
[58:26] influential speaker he'd be oh no
[58:29] sometimes the devil just laughs at that
[58:33] oh i wish i could be like so-and-so i
[58:35] wish i could sing like sometimes the
[58:37] devil just sitting there laughing
[58:39] it don't mean nothing to him
[58:43] he don't pay no more attention to that
[58:46] than nothing
[58:49] you get all the theology you want to and
[58:51] all the seminary training the devil just
[58:53] sit back and laugh at it but when he
[58:55] sees that life
[59:00] look at those disciples
[59:01] down there that maniac child that day
[59:03] with epilepsy saying come out of them
[59:05] devil come out of them devil come out of
[59:07] them double the devil sitting there now
[59:08] aren't you just making a pretty shame of
[59:10] yourself

[59:13] you he commissioned to cast me out now

[59:24] didn't have to say nothing
[59:27] the devil was already scared right then
[59:32] that's the kind of you don't have such a
[59:33] reputation to help you don't even have
[59:34] to open your mouth
[59:36] you walk in the room and they start
[59:38] crying out how did you come to torment
[59:40] us before the time
[59:42] didn't have to sit there and kick the
[59:43] pulpit and get mad and run around he
[59:45] just walked up
[59:51] that's why even when the weakest
[59:52] christian gets on the knees the devil's
[59:54] tremble
[59:58] the devil was already scared then he
[1:00:00] knew he had to leave right there because
