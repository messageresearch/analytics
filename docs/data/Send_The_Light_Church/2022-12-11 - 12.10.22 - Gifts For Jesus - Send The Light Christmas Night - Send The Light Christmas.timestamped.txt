[5:41] and impress everyone with your giant
[5:42] know-it-all brain let's see
[5:45] you know Cooper never comes to anything
[5:48] I feel like he has the right idea I feel
[5:51] like I have nothing to offer either I'm
[5:53] sorry everyone but maybe God just didn't
[5:55] give me any special gifts after all I'm
[5:57] just not good at anything
[6:02] teacher reminds everyone about upcoming
[6:04] presentation and dismisses class for
[6:07] lunch
[6:15] yeah YouTube do you two plan on

[6:20] absolutely not what about you George I
[6:23] want to but I can't think of anything to
[6:25] do I don't have any talents and I don't
[6:27] want to make a fool out of myself I see
[6:29] well George God has made you a unique
[6:32] person and gifted you with certain
[6:34] talents you aren't required to do
[6:35] something on stage but maybe you can
[6:37] help in another way thank you Miss Baker
[6:39] I'll keep thinking about it
[6:42] thank you
[6:45] Cooper returns with a lunchbox in a
[6:47] surprise to see George still in the room
[6:48] he goes to a chair and starts to eat
[6:51] George watches from afar
[7:12] do you have a staring problem or
[7:15] something
[7:15] no I was wondering why you're eating in
[7:18] here instead of the cafeteria with
[7:19] everyone else they're too nice to me in
[7:22] there it gets on my nerves too nice you
[7:25] wouldn't understand you're one of them
[7:26] one of them what are you a parrot I said
[7:30] you wouldn't understand I'm not like
[7:32] everyone else here I don't even believe
[7:33] in God after my mom got all religious
[7:36] she made me come to this place
[7:38] I understand more than you may think
[7:40] yeah right do you want to know why my
[7:42] parents homeschooled me for all these
[7:44] years
[7:45] um
[7:46] I was so full of anger until I was 12. I
[7:49] kept getting into fist fights and my
[7:50] parents had to keep me away from anyone
[7:52] I might hurt you're making this up do I
[7:55] know how I got this
[7:57] roasting marshmallows around the fire
[7:58] and saying Jesus Loves Me No I burned
[8:01] down my dad's chat after a fight
[8:03] now you're really making stuff up
[8:06] I'm sure look it up online I'm sure you
[8:08] can find the news article maybe even the
[8:10] police report your dad called the cops
[8:12] on you
[8:13] yeah he settles for my own good I spent
[8:15] two months in a Detention Center oh so
[8:18] that's what made you all religious no
[8:20] not even close so what was it
[8:24] those two months I was gone he rebuilt
[8:26] the shed all by himself
[8:28] he sent me a letter every day I was
[8:30] there
[8:31] I read them all on the way home
[8:34] then I realized how much my Dad loved me
[8:36] and how much God really loved me and how
[8:38] much he can forgive me for the awful
[8:39] things I have done
[8:41] so just like that you changed no not
[8:44] even close but when I asked so what was
[8:47] it
[8:48] but when so when I asked God to forgive
[8:51] me the change in my heart was instantly
[8:56] nice story bud I'm going to shoot some
[8:58] hopes
[9:04] Lord I remember the days before I knew
[9:06] you I remember feeling just like Cooper
[9:09] Lord I I pray that you was soft and
[9:11] Cooper's heart and show him that you're
[9:12] real
[9:13] Lord I pray that you'll use me to be a
[9:15] light in his life in Jesus name
[9:17] amen

[12:09] Brothers
[12:31] foreign
[13:24] we have one final presentation from
[13:26] George
[13:34] I wasn't sure what to do for tonight
[13:36] because I don't feel like I am good at
[13:38] anything I used to be really good at
[13:40] breaking the rules but then I realized
[13:42] that God had given me something else a
[13:44] change chart so I decided to share my
[13:46] testimony I used to think Christmas was
[13:49] all about vacation from school and
[13:51] getting cool stuff I was greedy selfish
[13:53] and very angry inside
[13:55] that all changed when I realized it was
[13:57] all about God himself coming down to our
[13:59] little world he paid for our sins and
[14:01] mistakes then he forgave us and changed
[14:03] us now Christmas has a brand new meeting
[14:05] it's a reminder of his patience and
[14:07] undeserved Grace Upon Our Lives I'm so
[14:09] thankful he gave me another chance I'd
[14:12] like to remind you all that if God can
[14:14] change someone like me and give me a new
[14:16] lease on life he can help anyone no one
[14:18] is beyond his reach and his care today I
[14:21] invite you to come walk with Jesus he
[14:23] will take your burdens your Brokenness
[14:25] and uncertainties it will truly be the
[14:27] greatest privilege you will ever know to
[14:28] happen by your side for the rest of your
[14:30] days
[14:33] [Applause]
[14:38] thank you for sharing that with us
[14:40] George we now look like the crowd to
[14:42] sing with us as we sing yes Cooper
[14:45] presentation all right
[14:52] I never really understood God or
[14:54] Christmas or being good until I listened
[14:56] to George tonight I was sitting there
[14:58] and I realized I want what he has a
[15:01] changed heart please forgive me for
[15:03] being rude and uncaring
[15:05] I I want to invite Jesus inside and have
[15:08] that life that George was talking about
[15:11] I now know that Jesus has been waiting
[15:14] for me tonight I want to give him my
[15:16] heart
[15:17] I invite the cash to come and sing with
[15:19] me
[15:39] what can I give him
[15:43] poor as I am
[15:46] if I were a Shepherd I would bring him a
[15:53] lamb If I Were A wise man
[15:57] I'd sure do my part
[16:01] so what can I give him I'll give him my
[16:08] heart give him my heart
[16:12] giving my heart
[16:15] what can I give him but all of my heart
[16:22] I'll give it my heart
[16:26] giving my heart
[16:30] what can I give him but all of my heart
[16:37] what can you give him what can you bring
[16:43] what can you offer that's fit for a king
[16:50] bow before Jesus
[16:53] that's where you can start so what do
[16:59] you give him just give him your heart
[17:03] and by other room to sing with us give
[17:06] him your heart
[17:09] give him your heart

[17:19] heart

[17:22] heart give him your heart
