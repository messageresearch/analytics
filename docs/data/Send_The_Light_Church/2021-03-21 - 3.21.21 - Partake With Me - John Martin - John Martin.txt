that one more time lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe amen very very simple but yet it makes everything work amen without faith personally it doesn't work for us that's right god still moves forward god still has a bride there's still a city but in order for us for us to be affected we have to believe amen it has to be personal for us and i'm glad that he put it in our our free more agency that we can't believe no matter what the devil tells us so much how much he lies to us we still can't believe all things are possible amen god bless you i want to say it's good to be in god's house i i we're a few a number here i'll say there's probably many more that are live streaming god bless you all that are in your homes and uh wherever you might be those if there be those that are uh live streaming for the first time we want to welcome you god's word can be here there and everywhere it's not bound and but i believe that that god wants to bless us exceedly above all the people that are here [Laughter] amen and as we get as we go further we don't know what's going to happen with this this cove this nation we just know that there's a squeeze coming times are going to get hard and we just we need to receive all of christ that we can amen turn with me if you would to the book of saint peter chapter 2 saint peter chapter 2 we want to read verses 3 uh through 7 verses 3 through 7 before we read let's look to the author just a moment heavenly father lord we bow our our hearts and our attitudes and our spirits mind our thoughts everything that we are we humble them before you we come before you unworthy to even approach you and worthy to read your word lord you provided a great sacrifice for us calvary we thank you for that and today lord we ask that you forgive us of any trespassers or sins any unbelief anything that would stand in the way of you having free course to reveal to us your precious word lord i pray that you not only be with us here to be with those in the homes those that are gathering lord that you meet the various needs that would be amongst us for we are perhaps a more needy people today than we ever been but lord you're able to exceedingly meet those needs and we pray that faith would reach out and touch the hem of your garment today that needs would be met according to thy great riches and glory give us eyes to see ears to hear heart to understand and become more one with your word today let us leave here with a greater faith in you lord through the ministry of the word we commit this service in your hands we give you the praise and honor in jesus precious name we pray amen amen second peter chapter one starting with verse number three according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain into life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue hereby are given to us great exceedingly great and precious promises that's right that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now let's just look at the divine nature right here and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge temperance temperance patience patience godliness and godliness brotherly kindness and to brother kindness charity amen this is the divine nature of god for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen god bless you may be seated eve was beguiled by the serpent and as eve beguiled as eve was beguiled to take or partake of the tree of knowledge god wants us to partake of the tree of life today amen and we've been invited through these scriptures here in in peter we want to entitle this message partake with me now at that time that adam and eve partook of that tree they would have done anything they could to get back and partake of the tree of life but they couldn't flaming swords went up to protect it that's right amen and now today men have a chance to partake of the tree of life and they don't want nothing to do with it but jesus said whosoever will let him come and drink of the waters of life freely we have a chance to partake of the tree of life god invites us for a subject we want to talk about standing on the promises of god amen he's given us exceedingly great and precious promises and that by these promises we might be a partaker of god a partaker of the divine nature a partaker of the tree of life one thing is sure that god keeps his word he keeps his promises and god has made it possible for us to partake of those our human nature cannot we cannot keep our word completely right not completely every man's a liar we just get little thoughts and we won't share exact motives and we try to hide things and that's the nature of humanity but god keeps his word amen i want to just lay a little foundation as we get into this further that with abraham and god made abraham a promise in genesis chapter 12 when he was 75 years old and in verse 1 now the lord had said to abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house onto a land that i will show thee now notice this is a very good type of the believer we have to separate when we come to god and i will make thee notice a great nation and i will bless thee and make thee a great name and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee and in thee shall the families of the earth be blessed the original promise that god made was i will make thee a great nation amen not nations but a great nation and abram separated from his family but he took a lot with him and after a number of years god had to separate from him as well genesis chapter 13 verse 14. i'm going to go through a lot of scriptures today i want to encourage you don't get too involved with writing them all down you can but there's just a lot i want you to catch i want you to catch and abram said and the lord said to abram after the lot had separated from him lift up now thine eyes and take and look from the place where thou art northward south or eastward westward for all the land which thou see us to thee i will give it and to thy seed singular right forever and i will make thy seed singular as the dust of the earth so uh that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall this thy seed also be numbered so about 14 or 15 years after lot had pitched his tent towards the worldly things the world had consumed him it took a while but he pitched his tent towards worldly things now during these many years as abraham was becoming more holy and more perfect la soul was being vexed daily that's what the bible tells us he was being oppressed wore down plagued tormented troubled provoked that's what that word means seeing and hearing the filthy communications of the world right pay attention to what you're looking at when you pick up that phone because it will vet you it will bring you down you know what eventually happened he was eventually taken captive right i'll say stay away from the world but what did abram do when he heard that his nephew was captured he went after him amen he had a burden he loved him and he put his own life in rest getting him and in genesis chapter 14 verse 16 and he brought and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his not his nephew his brother think about that his brother amen what a what a burden and his goods and the women also on the people he restored his brother lot right amen god was so pleased with abram's labor of love that that he actually met him on the way back in the form of melchizedek paid tithes he was pleased with him i'll say god god is pleased when you labor for the lord amen amen abraham was still without a natural seed but i believe he had the spiritual seed if we could understand the difference here the seed of faith and this the natural seed we can see why things happen the way they did more in the bible and it's hard to become a great nation without having a son to continue to multiply in genesis chapter 15 verse 3 abraham said behold to me thou has given me no seed that was given no seed and lo the one that born in my house is not my heir and the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine air but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowels shall be thy heir it's just if i could read verses five and six if you could just go to the next verse and he brought him forth abroad and said look now to the heaven and tell me of the stars that thou can be numbered and he said unto him so shall thy seed singular be and he believed in the lord and it was come to him to righteousness so he had the seed of faith he did believe amen in the in the promise that god gave him amen just didn't understand how it was going to come amen next they had hagar now that eventually brought a lot of trouble in the house she got kicked out and while hagar was alone struggling in genesis chapter 16 verse 10 the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thy seed exceedingly the same thing he told abraham that it shall be numbered that shall not be numbered for multitude now this is a different seed it's not the same seed and the angel of the lord said unto her in verse 11 behold thou art with child and shall bear a son and shall call his name ishmael because the lord have heard thy affliction and he shall be a wild man look at the type of this seed is a wild man and every man hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of his brethren it's it's a different seed amen i will multiply thy seed exceedingly abraham was 86 years old when his son ishmael was born 86 and abraham and ishmael they bonded together for about 13 years and god appeared unto abram again in genesis chapter 17 verse 1 and when abram was 99 the lord appeared unto abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk be walk before me and be thou perfect this is 24 years after he left separated and god's still telling him to be perfect i say don't you ever entertain a spirit that that that says you don't have to press in to be perfect don't listen to that thing amen verse two and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thy seed exceedingly speaking of sarah now in verse 16 and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea and i will bless her and she shall be a mother nations king of the people shall be of her and abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto unto him that is a hundred years old and sarah that is 90 years old there and abraham said unto god oh that ishmael might live before thee now it shows this statement really shows where abraham was was at he believed in the promise that he was going to have a son he believed that god was going to give him a son he believed what god had told he just didn't understand how it was going to happen it's a lot of times we we we believe the message we're we we believe this is the nh we we believe that we're going to be we just don't know how this stuff's going to happen but we believe it verse 19 and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him nothing to do with ishmael gonna multiply that seed gonna bless her naturally but the covenant is established with this seed now god is speaking of the seed of faith that's what this seed is not a natural seed because ishmael was the natural seed esau was the natural seed even though same mom and dad it was still natural seed god is referring to the seed of faith that's in you and that seed is christ in ephesians chapter 3 verse 17 says that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that seed of god is in there by faith verse 20 and as for ishmael i have heard thee though and i blessed him and will make him fruitful and we'll multiply him exceedingly 12 inches shall be begot and i will make him a great nation so here it is of course that nation became other nations and many nations eventually but you notice the covenant is with not ishmael and his seed it's not in the natural it's by the seed of faith amen abraham went 25 years without a clear or complete understanding of how this promise was going to come to press but abraham he kept believing he kept obeying he kept pressing towards perfection until a complete surrender and that happened when he was ready to kill isaac and the lord stayed his hand but then he received his promised son in which abraham became not only the father of many nations through ishmael but became the father of our faith which is a holy nation amen that's the nation we're interested in first peter chapter 2 verse 9 says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation amen i percue your people that you should show forth the praises of him that have called you out of darkness into his marvelous just as god called abraham out god is calling us out amen amen to be a holy nation what makes us a holy nation we believe god's promised word amen that's what separates us from the natural believer first ten which in times past were not a people but are now the people of god which have not which had not attained mercy but now have obtained mercy all through faith isn't that beautiful as abraham was predestined to bring forth his seed through isaac so have we been predestined to bring forth the same seed amen which is jesus christ the same seed amen spiritual seed amen abraham had two seeds one was sown through the flesh to his efforts without any help of god and it brought forth ishmael the other was sold through faith in god and it brought forth isaac and brother bran made it real clear in this message that when you mix yourself with the word it becomes a hybrid and it cannot bring forth the son of god amen we must believe the word for what it is galatians chapter 3 verse 16 now to abraham and to his seed was the promise made he saith not intercedes as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ god only made the covenant through the seed that was sown in faith amen he did not make the covenant that was sold to the flesh now god still blessed the natural seed of abraham that was sown in the efforts of fish and that was ishmael inside of eve they're laid as we know two seeds one of god that was able and one of the devil and that was cain one was sowed in the flesh her own will to bring forth the lust of the flesh now catch this the other was sold by faith it was the will of god to bring forth salvation because if if hey if adam would not have gone in to eve and had that relationship eve would have been annihilated it was inside of adam the seed of god to bring restoration to make a way of redemption for his wife amen just as as christ made a way for us to redeem us at calvary it was inside of him and there was no way that the angels or anybody could see the expression of the attributes of salvation unless man fell isn't that beautiful two seats a seat of faith genesis chapter 3 verse 15 and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and mercy now they both lied in there notice her seed her seed it was the seed of god it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel i am sorry but something's going on inside of god is everything he does is by faith everything amen we're so used to everything happened with understanding with your building block you start at the bottom you build your way up and here it is we cannot see beyond understanding but faith don't need to see anything it just needs to believe it amen and that seed of faith is so important that it lies within us to believe the word of god for what it says because it's by the promises of god that we obtain the nature of god amen i just want to go through romans chapter 4 quickly very quickly what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh have found for if abraham would have been justified by works he aware of to glory but not before god what saith he the scriptures would saith the scriptures abraham believed god it was accounted him for righteousness for to him that worketh is the reward not reckon of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth god the right the faith is counted for righteousness so we must believe even as david also described the blessedness of the man who god imputeth righteousness without work saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man whom the lord will not impute sin cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness how was it then reckon when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision so it's not to the circumcision but to the uncircumcision notice it he he was circumcised afterwards and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of righteousness of faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe that's you and i though they be not circumcised that the righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who all this is us but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised are we walking in the steps of that faith we don't need to understand how god's going to do things we just need to believe it we need to believe that it does not yet appear but we know that one day we're going to be just like him amen we don't know how but we believe it we believe it because we're walking in the steps of that faith amen for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to him to a seed to the law but to the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law the heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none of that because the law worketh wrath but where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is a faith that it might be of grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the the seed seed one seed seed of faith not to that only which is of the law but to that which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all now don't get mixed up when i say seed of faith it is the seed of christ but it is one and the same it is one and the same i mean you can divide it but don't divide it and then you'll understand more as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being that weak in faith he considered not his own body now being dead when he was about a hundred years old neither the deadness of sarah's womb now look a lot of times the lord will speak something to us we read in the bible where there was a a question there was how is this going to be and it takes time for that seed sometimes to to get planted brother branham said when he saw that vision of that bride and he saw the bride get out of step he yelled out get back in line does that mean she wasn't bright doesn't mean she wasn't filled with the holy ghost it doesn't mean that she wasn't um predestined to become conforming to his image what it meant is that there's times that there's a staggering that takes place he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that he that had promised what he had promised he was able to perform amen now i know this hum we've all been promised things did you know everybody in the world is promised us something good by doing their own will is that the truth everybody in other words the devil makes promises right god makes promises and the bible tells us that the devil sits on the throne acting like he's god oh i'm going to give you this i'm going to give you that and sometimes we don't know which is which and i just say it like this there's a reason that we've been taught god interprets his word by bringing it to pass amen there's a reason for that there's a reason we've been taught the same with dreams what is interpretation we will know when it comes to past why do we need to know it before because we can still exercise faith trust i believe in you lord thy will be done amen i'm sorry i am not spiritual enough i am not even close to being spiritual enough to discern every single thing that goes on inside my brain and nobody is that's why we say if it's the lord's will we shall go here we shall go there we shall do this we should do that we make plans like we know we don't know i'm not saying sometimes we don't sometimes we do amen a lot of times we don't that's true i'm just saying here we've got to trust god amen so all the times that i thought that we thought how many has ever thought something was from god and found out that it wasn't i mean it's i say countless countless it's just the devil trying to get us off track amen the one thing god remains faithful he's true he's never lied amen he will bring us through and being fully persuaded what he has promised he was able also to perform now the devil can't perform it but god can and therefore was imputed unto him for righteousness and now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification isn't that beautiful romans chapter 8 verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that lives inside of you and it lives by faith by faith not by works therefore brethren we're debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortified the deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god this spirit will never ever lead you to live after the flesh amen that's right amen it will always lead you to mortify the deeds of the body amen why so god can have free course amen he wants he wants to have his way in her life he just wants a vessel that he can use abraham let's turn to romans chapter 8 verse 29 abraham kept believing he kept surrendering he kept obeying he kept mortifying the deeds of his flesh he kept pressing towards the promise that god gave him and one thing we do know that god has promised us is right here he promised us that we should we'll be like him amen that's really all that really that really matters when it's all when it's all said and done nothing else is going to matter we can hold to that promise romans chapter 8 verse 29 for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that we might be the firstborn among many brethren we're going to have the same nature as christ romans chapter 8 verse 22 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain until now why what's happening and not only they but ourselves also inside of us we're groaning which have the first fruits of the spirit even uh even we all also ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body we're waiting for completion to happen amen there's a there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond and so this is the climax of what what heaven's waiting on what the whole creation is waiting for it ain't waiting to see who's going to be the next president or if they're going to take us into socialism or what the world is going to be happening i mean do we really want to hear the news of what was happening in sodom and gomorrah when the two angels went down there do we really want to know the ins and outs of what was happening does it really matter let's just escape amen let's just escape praise the lord verse 18 for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us amen for the earnest expectation of the creation creature waiteth for the manifestation of us they're waiting for a manifestation of us that's where our focus should be manifesting christ amen while the world is going insane trying to figure out what's happening is this the end trying to make has your tails out of things the bride is focusing on manifesting christ it's the only way she'll be ready it's the only way she makes herself ready while the creation is waiting for this to happen there's an invisible union taking place between the bride and the bridegroom amen so let's not waste any more time let's start partaking of the promises of god that we can have as divine nature amen according this is divine power i've given to us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these promises we might be partakers of the divine nature of god our avenue to becoming more like jesus is through the promises of god amen it's through them that we become more like god we can't do it on our own amanda's very best is all vanity we need something greater and that's god's promises it's no different for our healing the avenue uh to healing is through the promises of god that's right god's word says that uh by his stripes we're healed it's a promise it's through that promise that we obtain healing yes amen we have to personally believe god's promise for our healing we know the word is true we know the debt was paid we know one person can be healed by believing it and another person not by not believing it amen we have to believe the word of god personally amen so our avenue to become more like jesus is through the promises of god as well number one god has given to us promises and he keeps his promises we've all failed to keep our word but god has never failed one time god cannot lie right amen heaven and earth will pass away but god's word will never pass away it will never fail god keeps his number two god's promises are not christmas gifts there are gifts that are attained they are gifts but they're only obtained through faith without faith we can't reach them we need faith to better cash in on the promises of god don't you think about the children of israel they were delivered out of the egyptian world but they never used faith to enter into the promised land which is a type of the holy ghost which is a type of god's divine nature amen yes and god he got us out of the world amen he got us out of the world but you need faith to enter into the promised land right it's you willing to deny yourself and go after the nature of god it's not a gift without faith it's not a gift without faith you've got to believe for hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 let us therefore fear last a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with what faith in them that heard it we must we must mix this gift that god's given us with faith to receive it amen and we need to literally fear fear coming to church fearing less a promise being left us at church when we leave and go back home amen you need faith to pick up that promise of god you need faith to walk out and say it is mine it is mine i'm holding to it sometimes i'm afraid because we're not using the promises of god to kick the devil out of our life let the devil hang around in our minds bother us keep us down the bible says in my name you'll cast out devils the promise of god says submit yourself therefore god resist the devil and he'll flee sometimes you've got to tell the devil get behind me in the name of jesus when's the last time you said that i'll tell you say it more often you'll feel better because the devil will stay there as long as you let him to stay there now god has given us this promise that the devil will flee if we resist them if we rebuke them but we got to take that promise by faith and apply it to our lives as any promise of god god fore knew that the children of israel would not continue their walk with god to overcome and enter in the promise god knew that he foreknew that yet when they were standing at the red sea and they couldn't go any other way god still provided for them yes a way of escape amen amen but after a while god says you need to start believing in me that's it and he deserves that he's god he created us he is our creator we are his creation we were created to please him without faith we can't please him god expects us to take him at his word amen now god would do that for someone who would turn their back on god how much more shall he avenge his own lack that cried day and night for him amen he says i tell you that i will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth right the promises of god are yeah amen but our faith has to be gay and amen those promises let us therefore fear last a promise being left us of entering into his rest and if you should seem to come short partake of the promises of god don't let one promise behind claim it stand on it stand on the promises in this laodicean age our common faith must grow into what is called a rapturing faith a perfect faith for rapture now enoch was the type of the bride in this last age hebrews chapter 11 verse 5 says by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death amen and was not found because he had because god had translated him but before the translation he had a testimony and that testimony was that he pleased god we cannot go into a rapture without the same testimony we need to please god amen how do i do that brother john i mean i'm coming to church paying my tithes you could come to church and pay your tithes and not have faith in god but without faith it is impossible to please him amen for he that cometh to god must believe that he is look at and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him this is important because we want to cash in on the promises of god that we might obtain the nature of god the divine nature of god and if we we don't if we don't know that god's a rewarder we may not get it but we know he's a rewarder all we got to do is believe believe the word believe the promises god is faithful he's not slack in his promises amen he loves to hand out rewards i mean as a they they say as a leader a leader is always looking for opportunities to congratulate somebody on something that they've done right leaders do they look because you can't reward the wrong thing hey good job for coming in late today you know it just doesn't work but you're looking you're looking for things to reward and god's the same way amen he's a reward of them that are diligently seeking him amen i love that all right number one god has given to us promises that he keeps it insults him when we doubt or don't trust him he keeps his promises amen number two god will reward you if you keep diligently seeking him number three don't try to squeeze god in don't try to squeeze god in your life seek the promises of god first make time for god first jesus never encourages to lay up treasures here on the earth that's right amen matthew chapter 6 verse 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you so we got to seek him first even when jesus taught us to pray he taught us to seek the promise of his kingdom first in matthew chapter 6 verse 10 thy kingdom come in his prayer thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven thy kingdom come right amen and when the kingdom does come it comes inside of us jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change that's right amen divine nature inside of me amen the kingdom of god cometh not with observation behold the kingdom of god is within you amen that's what jesus said number three seek first the promises of god's divine nature seek god's kingdom first no peter handed out the keys to the kingdom of god's divine nature in acts chapter 2 verse 38 repent be baptized and you shall receive god's divine nature so i want to say this it requires humility repentance is a humility it's a dying to self it's a picking up of god's will for your life amen so following the instructions of repentance and baptism through faith will inherit god's divine nature it's the beginning of your walk with the lord now it's no different key for this last age same key jesus said i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire what do we do be zealous repent be zealous in other words get effectually hot and repent sure it means turn around but it's a humility you got to be humble if you want to receive from god follow god's instructions through faith and we inherit gold amen the deity of god the life of god the nature of god he's the only one that can give us him amen it's him it's no different today wherever you are at with god your walk with god first peter chapter five verse five likewise younger submit yourselves to the elder yay all of you just every one of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility amen that should be first and foremost not fitting them in right for god resists a proud nature and he gives his grace to the humble right amen the conclusion verse 6 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time amen grace to receive god's divine nature requires the respect of humility god expects us to humble ourselves and die out to ourself and as we follow his instructions for the respect of humility he will re we will receive more grace he giveth grace to the humble more grace more i want to be more like jesus not in power to go zim boom boom but the power to handle the devil who's got me in such a rotten place that i can defeat the devil in my mind amen that i can overcome all things that's the divine nature i want seek first the promises of god's divine nature with much more humility galatians chapter 6 verse 9 let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season you shall reap if you faint not so there is a period where we're going to be tried before we receive the promises of god amen amen as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them whoever the household of faith yes amen do you have opportunity to do good unto all men you know a lot of us kind of avoid well-doing i've always agreed with thomas edison he said opportunity is missed by most people because it's dressed in overhauls and it looks like work but i'll say partake with me don't be weary in well-doing you see look for opportunities because god is pleased god is pleased when you labor for him amen we have precious promises and if we're not weary we're going to reap if we faint not well revelation chapter 3 verse 20. look at this promise behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and i will sup with him and he with me now that's what's really important here is that fellowship with jesus amen it's a promise amen to him that overcometh why grant to sit with me on my throne even as i overcame this with my father in israel what a promise amen that that promise is going to take you all the way [Laughter] don't let the devil steal your peace john 14 verse 27 peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you that's a promise he is our peace that divine nature of god living inside of you he is our peace that's christ in you faith in that word gives you peace faith in the promises of god helps brings back brings to you the partaking of the divine nature of god come on amen philippians chapter 4 verse 9 those things which you have both learned received heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you amen isaiah 26 3 thou shalt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is staying on thee because he trusteth in thee this is god inside of you amen as our trials can discourage us rob us of our joy first peter chapter 1 verse 7 that the trial of your faith is being much more precious than gold that perish though it be tried and fire might be found into the praise and on and the glory at the appearing of jesus christ whom having not seen you love him amen in whom though now you see him not you believe with all your heart and you believe so much that you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory amen amen receiving the end of this faith even the salvation of your souls john chapter 15 verse 10 if you keep my commandments he shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoke unto you that my joy might remain with you right amen that your joy might be full this is my commandment that you love one another as i've loved you sometimes we just need a restoration of the joy that we once had amen amen david prayed one time he said restore unto me the joy of my salvation so i say partake with me whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises that by these we might be partakers of joy of peace receiving joy sometimes requires humility amen remember he giveth more grace to the humble our shortcomings can make us feel resentful and our trials can make us feel bitter sometimes i'm glad somebody's saying amen to the word because it's true despite david's shortcomings he moved forward with humility he was willing to submit to the work of the kingdom of god again now i want to give you scripture for that psalms 51 verse 12 and 13 verse 12 says restore unto me the joy of my salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit look at the very next verse then then then then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee wow his motive for joy he wanted to you can you imagine trying to win somebody over to the lord amen i just it really stinks you know what i'm going through but hey you know you want to serve the lord with me but if you've got something if you've got joy they want joy we're living in a world where there's hardly no joy there's hardly no love there's hardly no peace but i'm telling you god hasn't changed he's still the same yesterday today and forever and we can obtain this to his promises and we just believe the word for ourselves it doesn't matter what happens to the right what happens to the left who leaves who stays what happens it is for me and my house i will serve the lord we can't let these promises slip their precious promises romans chapter 8 verse 1 there is now no condemnation to them that walk which are in christ jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit see the two different seeds for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus it has made me free from all my efforts of trying to do right and wrong galatians 5 16 this i say walk in the spirit and you should not fulfill the lust of the flesh now this is a promise of god amen i want to be able to express the divine nature of god and if i walk in the spirit i'll not fulfill the lust of the flesh it's through this promise i can have his divine nature it's important to the bride to have the nature of christ whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises i say partake with me partake of this promise with me partake of philippians chapter 4 verse 13 i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me amen all things the divine nature of christ in me i can do all things i can overcome i can believe when everything is is stacked against me like abraham against hope believed in hope and then he's staying out of the promises of god through unbelief we are the children of abraham through faith not through sight not through feelings not through emotions it doesn't matter i want to stand like job he had that divine nature he said though the lord slay me yet while i trust him something inside of him was willing to stand with the word regardless if he didn't understand why he was being slain he's faithful to the lord psalms 46 verse 1 god is our refuge and our strength a very present help in trouble partake with me this promise don't let it don't let it slip don't let it just be a word don't let it be seen like idle tails do you believe he's a present help in a time of trouble don't make god a liar he's not a liar he's a present help in a time of trouble if he's not for you it ain't because god isn't right it means you're not believing for it i'll say do you get in trouble sometimes you could use this scripture right here you could use the divine nature of god because i tell you when i'm in trouble i really want god on the scene i want god oh at very least you're trouble i mean you caused it you sinned you're bad you're in trouble at the very least you need the divine nature of mercy of grace of longsuffering of god be patient with me amen psalms 32 7 some of these some of these we haven't heard before thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me for trouble thou shalt come past me about with songs of deliverance amen you ever get thoughts in your head they just seem to come bombard you and all sudden you start singing a song song of deliverance the devil just leaves and all of a sudden you're free from that negativity amen songs of deliverance i will instruct thee now look at this promise i will teach thee in the way which thou shalt go that's right and i will guide thee with my eye yes these promises are yea and amen we've got to believe them i i understand we all honestly we all have things in our life that seem unbearable can you say amen to that just want to make sure that you're with me but god said he'd not put anything on you that could bring you down he'd make a way of escape did he not he'd make a way so you could bear that situation you you it may not vanish but greater is he that's in you that divine nature than he that's in the world and the thing is if you don't stand up by faith and say it is mine that demon will stay there because it is not god there's only two there's only two seeds one's the flesh one is spirit right you gotta take a stand amen well brother john i just don't feel like it well it's not my feelings if i if the gospel was by feelings i would never step up here i was i was telling my wife i said you know when i first started out i used to tell a lot of stories my whole message was just one story after another but it just seems that i've gotten so far away from that but stories and things they really help you feel good help you feel like believing but if you're not going to have faith based on the word of god what good is feelings helping you believe right right amen that's right it's the word that's you're in love with you're not love with this you're not in love with this person you're not loved the way he speaks you not love the way he looks you're not the way in love with the way he delivers you're in love with the word amen the word and it doesn't matter the the uh who god uses to bring you the word what matters is that you love the word with all your heart with all your soul with all your might and you believe it it's for you personally because it's your relation you have a relationship with the word now your feelings the relationships with you with the word of god joshua chapter 1 verse 5 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with you would you like god to be with you just like god was like moses it's a promise by these promises we can have god's divine nature i'm telling you before god came along moses was a scaredy cat but when he got in the presence of the holy ghost he could stand there in the face of the head of the whole world right amen fearless even when things was happening in front of him that god didn't tell him about right he still believed god was with him he still believed greater was god inside of him than what was ever happening in front right amen in the world amen amen i want god i want god with me i want this promise for me i want to have the boldness of god's holy spirit in my life have not i commanded thee be strong and be of good courage it's a commandment verse 9 i'm so sorry verse 9 have not i commanded thee it's a commandment be strong be of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with you whatsoever thou goest now that word dismayed means bewildered about something ever been bewildered about something i can't believe brother john just did that why did he do that i'm bewildered don't be dismayed god is with you wheresoever you go with right amen i thought you'd like that because i was pointing a finger at me we can get dismayed about a lot of things the devil wants to dismay you confuse you right amen be it's a commandment be strong be courageous god's with you wherever you go he's not going to leave you he's not going to forsake you amen isaiah chapter 41 verse 10 fear thou not for i and with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness it's a promise of god for us hebrews 13 verse 5 let your conversation be without i want i want and be content with what you got for he have said i will never leave thee and i will never forsake thee so that we may boldly say amen god is my helper amen not man god is my helper i will not fear what man shall do to me stick and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me doesn't matter what man tries to do you matthew chapter 11 verse 28. we're getting real close here i know this is a lot of stuff but i just want to try to you know bring some promises to your thoughts that by these you can become more like jesus amen come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke my word and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find the rest that your soul is desiring for my yoke is easy and my burden my way what i place upon you it's it's light yeah you still got to do something you still have to do what god has you to do but it's light he gives you the reward of his presence after you do it i was working with brother larry yesterday at the church we had been talking for some hours then he just says out of the blue he says do you feel his presence do you feel do you is it just me he will reward you with his presence it's happened many times with brother stan and i working together when you come together and you're talking about the things of god something happens you create a presence you create an atmosphere i mean where his presence just comes and he rewards you with himself amen his divine nature and it's something more lasting than just listening to a song don't let the promise of healing for our body our spirit or our soul get left behind we have promises first peter chapter 2 verse 24 first peter chapter 2 verse 24 who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes we were healed right amen we were already healed we don't have to wonder if god is in favor of our healing he already said i'm in favor i would above all things that thou may prosper and in being health even as i so prospered right amen isaiah 53 verse 5 but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities talk about healing for body soul and spirit here amen the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen by this promise we can be a partaker of god's divine nature i say partake with me don't leave this promise here take it with you luke chapter 11 verse nine we're we're we're we're coming down to a close here i know it's a few minutes extra but i hope to you it's worth it amen luke chapter 11 verse 9 and i say unto you ask and it shall be given to you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for everyone that asketh he receives and he that seeketh finds and he that knocks it shall be open amen just if you haven't got what you wanted keep asking keep seeking keep knocking if abraham did it for 25 years you should be able to do it for well you fill in the blank your children of abraham you're just going to keep asking you're going to keep seeking you're going to keep believing in god it's his word if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father all right this is to the fathers good example would you give him a stone and say ha ha ha ha or if you ask a fish would you give him a serpent and say ha ha ha i don't think so or if he ask an egg would you offer him a scorpion fish for serpent egg instead of a scorpion instead of an egg wow no one in the right mind would do that no one yet if you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your own children how much more shall your heavenly father give you the divine nature if you ask for it so i'm saying we live in a world where people don't even want the divine nature of god it's so sad they're very content with their own will but god has promised us the holy ghost and jesus invites us to partake of the tree of life partake of the divine nature it's through the promises of god that we can be a partaker of god's nature and i'll ask this morning invite you this morning partake with me get into the word start going through this word there's so many promises in here thousands there's thousands of promises that through these promises we might be partakers of god's divine nature i want to be like god i'm gonna be honest with you it's not that i'm worried about what some man is gonna do to me i don't want the devil slapping me around right right i'm just being honest with you because that all happens up here i want to be so full of god's divine nature that i just put in order his disorder when he comes to my mind tell them to get out of here this is god's property this is god's sanctuary amen amen and through and though our flesh is weak we may want to say oh that ishmael might live in other words our fleshly will might live but as abraham was predestined to bring forth a son that was naturally impossible for him to do so are we predestinated to bring forth the son of god which is naturally impossible to do but through the same faith that he had to bring forth isaac is the same faith that will bring forth the second isaac through us christ we exercise that same faith and it's much harder now no we're not old in age going through that trial but we're in the hardest age there ever was you got every distraction that's could be thrown at you trying to get you off track of becoming like christ amen satan's got a deck of cards just you know whatever you want whatever you want whatever you want and he spends all week just flooding our minds with doubts fears read the news never lifts you up never makes you feel better just vex is your soul but god has given us precious promises that by these promises we can be a partaker we can have the divine nature of god that we can add to our faith virtue virtue knowledge and knowledge temperance patience godliness probably kindness to probably kind of love we can have that inside it won't be something we just read about on the pages or we just hear about at church we can now say i am the living word of god it dwells inside of me today amen the whole earth is in travail let's stand together waiting for this manifestation and we've been predestinated by the word of god to bring forth this divine nature as sons of god now the bride is making herself ready how she doing it she's partaking of these promises because it's by these promises that we become his divine nature revelations chapter 19 verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife have made herself ready amen how did she do it well number one she didn't do it on her own that's because that would be called man-made religion god is coming for this denomination or that denomination but she made herself ready by believing the promise that god gave her and when you believe it you seek him diligently will be rewarded with his divine nature and he's coming back for a bride that's in his image without spot without wrinkle we need these promises we need to fear unless any of them slip right amen amen amen let's let's sing standing on the promises this morning before we go and pray i want us to stand on the promises of god amen
