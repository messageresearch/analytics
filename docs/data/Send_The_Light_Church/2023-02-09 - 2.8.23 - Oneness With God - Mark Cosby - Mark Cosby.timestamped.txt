[34:48] amen like this to greet you and the
[34:51] president of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[34:52] Christ says once again it's an honor
[34:54] privilege to be here just thank you
[34:57] brother John for the opportunity
[34:59] and um this is about our heads and word
[35:02] of prayer before we open up the holy
[35:04] word
[35:05] dear Lord Jesus we uh discounted a honor
[35:09] privilege to to be in your presence Lord
[35:11] just to being your house Lord and we all
[35:14] come for one reason and that is to meet
[35:16] with you Lord
[35:18] May each believer that will be here
[35:20] tonight there will be live streaming
[35:22] lore
[35:23] just have a testimony they met with God
[35:25] that they heard personally what God had
[35:28] for them and Lord as your Prophet said
[35:30] we come to church to see where we're at
[35:32] with you Lord may we each come with that
[35:35] direct motive Lord just to see where
[35:37] we're at with you Lord
[35:38] I pray Lord as we open the word Lord may
[35:42] you just bring it to life send your Holy
[35:43] Spirit Lord and let's bring the words to
[35:45] life off the very page of your word Lord
[35:48] help us to receive the engrafted word
[35:51] that's able to save our souls
[35:53] and Lord just bless this service from
[35:55] the opening prayer to the ending prayer
[35:58] Lord move your unworthy servant out the
[36:00] way Lord and may your voice be heard
[36:02] Lord throughout the congregation
[36:04] throughout the live stream
[36:06] we ask all these things in Jesus Christ
[36:08] and we pray amen amen
[36:10] so we want to turn to Genesis 11.
[36:15] and we'll read verses uh one and five
[36:19] through seven so Genesis 11 verses 1 and
[36:22] then five through seven
[36:24] very familiar scripture
[36:27] and the whole Earth
[36:29] was of one language in one sweet speech
[36:31] so we see at one point the Earth
[36:34] uh every man and woman was in in Oneness
[36:37] we're gonna see that wasn't a type of
[36:40] Oneness that God was looking for they
[36:42] were in unity but not the type of unity
[36:44] God desired his plan his perfect purpose
[36:48] I'm gonna go to verse five
[36:51] and the Lord came down to see the city
[36:53] in the tower which the children of men
[36:55] build it and the Lord said behold the
[36:57] people is one so we notice right there's
[36:59] a a Unity but not the type of unity that
[37:03] is like the body of Christ's Unity
[37:06] and they have all have one language and
[37:08] this they begin to do and now nothing
[37:10] will be restrained from them which they
[37:12] have imagined to do verse 7.
[37:15] go to let us go down there and confound
[37:17] their language they may not understand
[37:19] one another's speech and that's why we
[37:21] have so many languages now today
[37:24] but God can still speak in any language
[37:26] to any believer
[37:28] anywhere across the world
[37:30] let God bless his word and you may be
[37:32] seated
[37:33] so uh the title of our little message is
[37:36] we uh Oneness with God so I think it's
[37:40] going to be a little serious
[37:43] um it's just so I was just the studying
[37:45] I just realized how much
[37:48] it is until the being one with God it's
[37:50] just so much and it's such a beautiful
[37:53] thing that God desires us to be one with
[37:56] him so he's going to speak Oneness with
[37:59] God how important it is for each one of
[38:01] us to be one with God on a daily basis
[38:04] let's go to Genesis chapter one
[38:09] and we'll actually uh
[38:11] forgive me sister Amanda let's go
[38:13] Genesis 1 verses 15. let's try let's
[38:16] start with verse 15 first
[38:19] and let them be for lights in the
[38:21] firmament of the heaven to give light
[38:23] upon the Earth and it was so
[38:26] and God made two great lights the
[38:28] greater light to Rule the Day and the
[38:30] Lesser light to rule the night he made
[38:32] the Stars also and God set them in the
[38:35] firmament of the heaven to give light
[38:37] upon the Earth
[38:39] Verse 18 and tour over the day and other
[38:42] the night and to divide the light from
[38:44] the darkness and God saw it was good so
[38:46] we notice in these scriptures that they
[38:49] have to work in continuity they have to
[38:51] work in Oneness
[38:53] in order for it to be played out
[38:56] properly so God even created everything
[38:58] in one it has to work in accordance
[39:00] together in a Unity so we see God knows
[39:04] what he's doing when God does something
[39:07] it does not return void it's going to
[39:10] come out how it's set to be how he had
[39:12] it in his mind he had that there were
[39:14] thoughts in his mind and he expressed it
[39:16] and it became light so let's go to verse
[39:18] verse 20. and God said let the waters
[39:21] bring forth abundantly the moving
[39:23] creature that hath life and the file
[39:25] that may fly upon the earth and the open
[39:28] firmament of heaven and God created the
[39:31] whales and every living creature that
[39:32] moveth which the waters brought forth
[39:35] abundantly after their kind in every
[39:37] winged foul after his kind and God
[39:41] thought it was good and God said and God
[39:43] blessed them saying be fruitful and
[39:45] multiply fill the waters in the scene
[39:47] that the foul multiply in the earth in
[39:50] the evening in the morning were the
[39:52] fifth day for verse 24 and God so that
[39:55] the Earth bring forth the living
[39:56] creature after his kind cattle and
[39:58] creeping thing and the Beast of the
[40:00] earth after his kind and it was so and
[40:02] God made the beasts of the earth after
[40:03] his kind and the cattle after their kind
[40:05] and everything that creepeth upon the
[40:07] Earth after his kind and God saw it was
[40:09] good now verse 26
[40:11] and God said let us make man in our
[40:13] image
[40:15] after our likeness and let them have
[40:17] dominion over the fish of the sea see
[40:19] see Brother Joseph didn't know that that
[40:21] that verse was in it was in the sermon
[40:25] after dominion over the fish of the seed
[40:27] over the fall of the air and over the
[40:28] cattle and over all the Earth so we see
[40:30] at one point that man
[40:32] before the fall was in Oneness with God
[40:35] see now if if we went into a jungle and
[40:37] saw a lion
[40:39] we would probably want to do that
[40:40] because it might attack you but at one
[40:42] point Adam could pet a lion pet a tiger
[40:45] and no fear would be in there
[40:48] and so we're going see God is trying to
[40:50] take us back to that so when Jesus came
[40:53] on the Earth
[40:55] and died and rose again he put it in
[40:58] place so we could get back to how we
[41:00] were before the fall see God had when
[41:03] Adam fell God already had a plan to
[41:05] bring man back to Oneness with him it
[41:09] took thousands of years but that's how
[41:11] it had to be in order for it to be
[41:13] fulfilled so we have to strive for that
[41:16] Oneness
[41:18] we have to look and we have to every day
[41:20] we have to say Lord I need to be one
[41:23] with you I need to have the mind of
[41:25] Christ because Adam at one point had the
[41:27] mind of Christ every day before the fall
[41:31] but when sin crept in
[41:34] it made it so that now we have to fight
[41:37] to achieve this Oneness with God every
[41:40] day it's a battle a battle of Faith
[41:43] every day
[41:45] so let's go to Genesis 2.
[41:48] and we'll read verses eight through nine
[41:52] so it says and the Lord God planted a
[41:54] garden Eastward in Eden and there he put
[41:56] a man whom he had formed and out of the
[41:58] ground made the Lord God to grow every
[42:01] tree that is Pleasant to the site and
[42:03] good for food the tree of life also in
[42:06] the midst of Garden in the tree of
[42:08] knowledge of Good and Evil notice he
[42:09] distinctly
[42:11] um
[42:12] separated these two trees from the other
[42:15] trees
[42:17] and we know we know what that is where
[42:19] those two trees are
[42:21] and we'll go to verse 15 though and the
[42:23] Lord God took the man and put him into
[42:25] the Garden of Eden to dress it and to
[42:27] keep it and the Lord God commanded the
[42:29] man saying of every tree of the garden
[42:31] thou Mays freely eat so every man and
[42:35] woman on this Earth today has a choice
[42:38] of what tree they eat from every day you
[42:41] have that choice and at the day of
[42:43] judgment
[42:45] um when other when the the great white
[42:47] Throne judgment
[42:48] no one can say they didn't have a choice
[42:50] no one can say that God didn't give them
[42:52] a chance he presents it to you do you
[42:55] want the tree of knowledge or of life
[42:58] and you have to you need if you want to
[43:01] be one with God you have to eat off the
[43:04] tree of life because that's the only
[43:06] thing that can bring you to Oneness with
[43:09] God because God doesn't mix good and
[43:13] evil together
[43:14] God is good end of the story
[43:19] so let's go to verse 18 and the Lord
[43:20] said it is not good that man should be
[43:22] alone I will make him a help meet for
[43:24] him and out of the ground the Lord God
[43:26] form every beast of the field and every
[43:28] fowl of the air and brought them unto
[43:30] Adam to see what he would call them and
[43:32] notice that Adam had the mind of Christ
[43:34] and that's what he named each animal
[43:36] that Adam named that's what God wanted
[43:39] because they were one
[43:42] and when we can get in in the
[43:46] Supernatural the in the spirit be in in
[43:49] one with God then his thoughts will
[43:51] become our thoughts because it's no more
[43:54] your thoughts taking over but it's a
[43:56] mind of Christ taking over you
[43:58] and that's what the Holy Spirit was sent
[44:00] for and I'm getting a little ahead of
[44:01] myself
[44:03] um let's keep going amen verse 20 and
[44:06] Adam gave name Saul Catalan to the
[44:08] father of the air and to every beast of
[44:10] the field but for Adam there was not
[44:12] found a help meet for him and the Lord
[44:14] God caused a deep sleep to fall upon
[44:16] Adam and he slept and took one of his
[44:18] ribs and closed up the flesh instead
[44:20] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[44:22] had taken from man he a woman and
[44:25] brought her unto the man and Adam said
[44:27] this is now bone of my bone and Flesh of
[44:30] My Flesh she shall be called a woman
[44:33] because she had taken out of the man
[44:34] therefore shall a man leave his father
[44:37] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[44:39] wife there shall be one flesh so it's a
[44:41] beautiful type of the church in Christ
[44:44] being one
[44:46] that's what we're trying every day one
[44:48] we're trying to be Oneness with God
[44:50] and they were both naked and the man and
[44:52] his wife were not ashamed
[44:54] so we noticed in the beginning
[44:57] God created a Oneness for mankind to be
[45:01] in
[45:02] but in order for him to for this
[45:04] attributes to be manifested of him being
[45:08] a savior A Healer a deliverer how many
[45:11] can testify that he's delivered you amen
[45:14] he had to let man fall he didn't have to
[45:18] force man to make this decision but he
[45:21] gave man three more agency just as he's
[45:23] given each one of us free more agency
[45:25] and man chose
[45:29] the sin obviously because Adam was a
[45:32] type so Adam
[45:34] So Adam that's what his Calvary was Eve
[45:37] so he loved Eve so much he was willing
[45:39] to sacrifice everything and when she has
[45:42] a beautiful type of Christ giving his
[45:44] all for us that we may become one with
[45:46] him
[45:47] but in order for Adam to be redeemed
[45:50] Christ had to come in order for Adam to
[45:53] get back for Adam's race to get back to
[45:55] Oneness Christ had to come and live in a
[45:59] body of Flesh a tabernacle of Flesh and
[46:02] he did it so we could become one with
[46:04] him he showed us that you can live a
[46:07] life of an overcoming
[46:09] through the power of God through the
[46:11] power of the father he showed us how to
[46:13] do it and he's our perfect example for a
[46:15] reason and we have to follow that
[46:17] example if you want to be one with God
[46:19] follow the example of Jesus Christ
[46:21] because it will lead you to Oneness in
[46:23] fact he said I'm the way I'm the door no
[46:27] man can come unto me unless the father
[46:28] draw him
[46:31] amen so I got a couple quotes you mind
[46:33] if I read some quotes
[46:35] if Jesus said go back to the beginning
[46:38] there was only one pair of anything on
[46:41] Earth there was one Adam one Eve and
[46:44] they were joined by God Alone one female
[46:47] horse one male horse one female parent
[46:49] one male at the beginning as he told us
[46:52] to go back there was only one pair of
[46:55] anything is that true congregation says
[46:57] amen then we find out everything in the
[46:59] beginning was running in perfect order
[47:02] and harmony with God nothing was out of
[47:06] cater amen everything in heaven still is
[47:09] in order all the stars the galaxy the
[47:11] solar system this imagines one thing
[47:14] gets off a cater it will cause
[47:16] catastrophic events happening so just
[47:20] imagine if you imagine having
[47:23] there's there has to be perfect order
[47:24] you don't see some of the angels that
[47:27] say holy holy holy someone were over
[47:29] there saying I want to roast for lunch
[47:30] today no they're in Perfect Harmony
[47:32] because that's the way God created them
[47:34] too
[47:36] now listen
[47:38] do you see one Interruption spoils the
[47:41] whole entire program now when human
[47:44] beings is running in continuity with god
[47:46] with one man and one woman this woman
[47:49] sinned and throw the whole Earthly
[47:50] program out of continuity with God
[47:53] therefore one word added to this book or
[47:55] one word taken from it throws a
[47:58] Christian out of continuity continuity
[48:00] with God so if we come into service and
[48:03] don't receive and accept all the word
[48:05] then we are therefore thrown out of
[48:08] continuity with God because our our
[48:11] spirit has to agree with every word and
[48:13] stamp it with the amen it has to you
[48:16] can't just pick and choose with a
[48:18] pitchfork you got to rate the word in
[48:22] amen
[48:23] therefore one way one word added to this
[48:26] book or one word taken from it there was
[48:28] a Christian out of continuity with God
[48:30] throws a church out of continuity with
[48:32] God there's a family out of continuity
[48:35] with God so if you want God to do Mighty
[48:38] things in your family you got to make
[48:40] sure that you're in continuity with him
[48:42] you have to it's no other way God's only
[48:46] one who can can protect the family
[48:48] restore a family he's in a restoration
[48:51] business
[48:52] every every believer can be thrown out
[48:55] notice that he said every believer can
[48:59] be thrown out by not accepting every
[49:03] word of God so we have if you want to be
[49:07] one with God you have to accept every
[49:09] word no matter how hard it is to accept
[49:12] it or not because you need that word
[49:14] it's going to get you to the next level
[49:16] that God is calling you to which he's
[49:18] calling you to a deeper Oneness a deeper
[49:20] Unity with him a deeper personal walk
[49:23] with him the more personal we can get
[49:25] the more God can reveal to us the more
[49:27] God can use us in a way he couldn't use
[49:29] us
[49:31] um three months down the road a year
[49:32] down the road see God has has a vision
[49:35] to use us
[49:37] and we have to distrust in that Vision
[49:39] wherever he takes us that he's going to
[49:43] give us the the words that we need the
[49:45] maturity that we need oh everything that
[49:48] we need he's going to give us at the
[49:50] perfect time amen
[49:52] that was from uh marriage and divorce
[49:54] secondly to have the preeminence in his
[49:57] body of Believers that is his bride that
[50:00] he might live in people notice that now
[50:03] he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin
[50:05] separated them so now there had to be
[50:08] some way to get get it back again who's
[50:11] thankful that there's there's a way back
[50:12] amen oh my oh my when this is Rich to me
[50:16] just even think of a see what was God's
[50:20] purpose was now why didn't he just keep
[50:22] Adam and Eve like that then he would
[50:24] never be able to express his fullness
[50:27] his full attribute because
[50:31] he could have been a father there that's
[50:33] true but also he's a savior you say how
[50:35] do you know he was because I've had that
[50:37] experience amen he's a savior and he had
[50:40] to express that and how could he do it
[50:42] only through Christ how could he be a
[50:46] son only through Christ how could he be
[50:48] a Healer only through Christ so we see
[50:51] that's why our life has to be engulfed
[50:54] in Christ surrounded in Christ
[50:57] see all things are wound up in that one
[51:00] person Jesus Christ oh my
[51:03] amen that was from Christ The Mystery of
[51:05] God revealed like one more quote now
[51:07] when Adam and Eve listen to the LIE of
[51:09] the devil the holy image of God left
[51:11] them their Fellowship was broken with
[51:14] God their Fellowship of Oneness with God
[51:18] was broken the very minute they listened
[51:20] to the LIE of the devil that broke their
[51:23] fellowship and notice right here he says
[51:25] and the very minute that you so the
[51:27] moment that you and I listen to the LIE
[51:30] of the devil it'll break our fellowship
[51:32] with God and the crazy part is we might
[51:34] not recognize it at that very moment
[51:36] just like when Samson he didn't
[51:39] recognize that he broke the fellowship
[51:42] of God by not listening to the
[51:44] commandment and and telling his secret
[51:46] and he didn't realize until his eyes
[51:49] were put out because he got up like
[51:51] nothing happened and they put his eyes
[51:54] out and then he had to say once more
[51:56] Lord he got in that condition because he
[51:59] wasn't spiritually aware he didn't give
[52:01] his heart to God he gave it to Delilah
[52:04] and we got to make sure that we're
[52:05] giving our heart to God every day it's
[52:07] not a One-Shot deal brother Brandon even
[52:09] said that there's many doors of your
[52:11] heart that you haven't opened to God yet
[52:13] so every day we've got to give our heart
[52:15] to God and open those doors that we have
[52:17] not opened yet
[52:20] that's the very minute that you go from
[52:22] the presence of God notice that like she
[52:24] did when you fail to take God's word
[52:26] just as it is it's good Isaiah 28.
[52:35] so we wanted to see how important it is
[52:37] for us is to be in Oneness with God no
[52:39] matter the situation you're going
[52:41] through no matter the struggles we got
[52:43] to strive to be one with God because if
[52:46] we keep our eyes on Christ everything
[52:49] else is going to fall in place he
[52:50] promised it in his word that it would
[52:52] take place and we have to believe that
[52:55] this word can directly help us not just
[52:58] in the physical but also in here in the
[53:01] soul
[53:02] amen so Isaiah 28 verses 10 through 18.
[53:07] so this is probably a very familiar
[53:09] scripture as well to us
[53:10] so it says for preset must be upon
[53:13] precept precept upon precept line upon
[53:17] line line upon line here little and
[53:19] they're a little so we gotta we can't
[53:22] just take scriptures out we want we
[53:24] gotta the word has to dovetail from
[53:25] Genesis Revelation that's how God made
[53:28] his word too he's not a man that would
[53:30] lie verse 11. for with staring lips and
[53:34] other tongue will he speak to this
[53:36] people to whom he said this is the rest
[53:39] wherewith he may cause the weary to rest
[53:41] and it's not talking about a vacation
[53:43] rest but it's talking about a inner man
[53:46] rest the Holy Ghost is at rest and we
[53:49] gotta that's the type of rest that we
[53:51] need because a vacation can come and go
[53:53] and you wish you were back there but
[53:56] that Holy Ghost rest is there it's
[53:59] personally there for you
[54:02] to whom he said let me finish with uh
[54:05] William calls to worry to rest this is
[54:07] their refreshing yet they would not hear
[54:10] but the word of the Lord was upon them
[54:12] precept upon precept upon precept blind
[54:15] upon line upon line here little and
[54:16] they're little that it may go and fall
[54:18] back or and be broken and snared and
[54:19] taken so at the end of the day there'll
[54:21] be no excuse
[54:23] why we didn't make it because God has
[54:26] placed it plainly lying upon the line
[54:30] precept upon precept he's not trying to
[54:32] trick us he's just he's not an author of
[54:34] confusion the scripture tells us in fact
[54:37] he wants you to live a Victorious Life
[54:39] he wants you to overcome any and
[54:42] everything that the devil throws at you
[54:44] but if we're not in Oneness and
[54:46] continuity with God then we can never
[54:48] overcome the enemy in his Wicked tricks
[54:51] see you can't fight the enemy with flesh
[54:53] and blood he'll laugh right in your face
[54:55] because he knows you can but see his his
[54:59] job is to get you away from that Oneness
[55:01] with God we must strive like I said
[55:04] Oneness with God on a daily basis but
[55:07] like I said before the fall Adam and Eve
[55:09] have that Oneness
[55:11] we have to like Christ said go back to
[55:13] the beginning and see that with the
[55:15] recognize with everything was in order
[55:17] everything moves smoothly but when Adam
[55:20] and Eve got out of order that's when
[55:22] trouble happened and when we get out of
[55:24] order that's when trouble trouble that's
[55:26] when trouble will happen as well
[55:30] so I'm so thankful that he made it
[55:32] possible for us to get back to that
[55:34] but remember this Satan will fight tooth
[55:38] and nail for us not to be in unity with
[55:40] God he will because he knows if we can
[55:43] get Unity with God he's powerless and we
[55:47] have to remember what Jesus said he said
[55:49] power is given to me in heaven and in
[55:50] Earth so there's no demon there's no
[55:53] sickness there's no nothing that can
[55:55] stop you only thing that can stop you is
[55:58] yourself
[55:59] from being one with God
[56:02] if Satan can get you to compromise see
[56:04] Satan wants you see if he can't get you
[56:05] to disbelieve God or or all the word he
[56:09] wants you to disbelieve this a portion
[56:11] of it he wants you to compromise with
[56:14] the word and when he gets you to
[56:16] compromise you will lose your Oneness
[56:19] with God at that very moment
[56:21] until you get back to the word
[56:24] so it's so important for us to be one
[56:27] with the word we have to submit
[56:28] ourselves to the word of God even though
[56:31] we don't want to our flesh doesn't want
[56:33] to we got to bury that man bury that
[56:35] that Wicked Man our flesh
[56:39] God made God Made You to thirst after
[56:41] him and God made the church knows that
[56:44] to be Oneness under his Dominion that's
[56:48] what he made the bride for to be Oneness
[56:50] under his Dominion but the devil makes
[56:53] them Oneness under his Dominion notice
[56:55] that if we look in history all the
[56:57] dictators Hitler was able to get Germany
[57:01] to be in Oneness with him
[57:04] but the reason why that Oneness did not
[57:06] stay because it was not of God and it
[57:10] broken disbanded
[57:12] and just how this how he God disbanded
[57:15] the Tower of Babel he did the same thing
[57:18] to Hitler and all the dictators
[57:20] disbanded them even though they had
[57:22] Unity for a second Satan thought he had
[57:25] it but God disbanded it because it
[57:28] wasn't in the play it wasn't pleasing to
[57:30] God
[57:31] so we can't just we're not going to
[57:33] agree on everything you might like
[57:34] different foods I might different foods
[57:36] you might like a different song I like a
[57:38] different song
[57:39] but the thing is we got to lay aside
[57:41] those things and come agreement upon the
[57:43] word of God that's what's important
[57:45] that's that's that's what how they're
[57:47] one according to Upper Room every one
[57:49] mind one body one Spirit they're in
[57:51] agreement that they knew that this that
[57:52] Jesus that he promised this promise and
[57:56] they were tearing on they were tearing
[57:57] for that promise
[57:59] amen
[58:02] amen God made a man to thirst that was
[58:05] from the Oneness of unity 1958 God made
[58:07] a man to thirst but to thirst after him
[58:10] that's why there's a thirst place in a
[58:12] man but the Devil comes along and
[58:14] perverts that cause the people to thirst
[58:17] after him with the things of the world
[58:19] the Bible said if you love the world or
[58:21] the things of the world the love of the
[58:24] father is not in you and then you see
[58:26] the devil
[58:27] created the devil is not a Creator he's
[58:29] just a perverter of the original
[58:31] creation and what is this sin is
[58:33] righteousness perverted amen as I was I
[58:37] was just we were just studying I was I
[58:39] think I was it was Tuesday
[58:41] and I was reading I forgot I think it
[58:43] was in John I was reading and I was just
[58:45] I was in the Brows in the break room and
[58:47] I was just like just I just want to get
[58:49] up and click my heels just reading the
[58:51] word I was like man just God wants this
[58:52] Oneness it's so beautiful and I was just
[58:55] like let me let me not let me add two
[58:56] crazy people might think I'm a little
[58:57] crazy but it's okay though but I was
[58:59] just just guys just showing me how
[59:01] important it is for us to be one if we
[59:03] want the body of Christ to work the way
[59:05] it's supposed to work we have to be one
[59:07] with God first God's Gonna teach us
[59:09] unity and Oneness
[59:11] amen amen we'll go to John chapter 15.
[59:17] so now in the Tower of Babylon if you'll
[59:19] notice at the tower it was the beginning
[59:21] of Babylon which I'll speak on later
[59:23] this week the Lord will Babylon the very
[59:25] city was patterned out of heaven and in
[59:29] there had the river Euphrates falling
[59:31] right by the throne in the garden
[59:33] swinging garden and that's the pattern
[59:35] off of Heaven of the River of Life that
[59:37] flows off the throne and you see the
[59:40] achievement that men was doing was
[59:42] making a pattern perverted see even
[59:45] denominations they'll take a truth of
[59:48] God then they'll start to pervert it
[59:51] because they stop right there and God
[59:54] can't reveal anything more to them and
[59:56] the same thing can have we could become
[59:57] a domination with ourselves
[1:00:00] see we gotta let the spirit let the
[1:00:02] spirit lead and guide you into all truth
[1:00:04] not just the truth that you want to and
[1:00:06] settle right there I'm good enough but
[1:00:08] let God lead you into all truth because
[1:00:11] if if we were if it was our time
[1:00:13] if it was our time to go God would have
[1:00:15] taken us up he would have called us off
[1:00:17] the scene but there's more word that God
[1:00:19] wants to reveal to you that you can walk
[1:00:22] in but you have to want that you have to
[1:00:25] yearn for that because each time we
[1:00:27] follow the god with God's word he
[1:00:28] reveals it to us we become more one with
[1:00:31] him notice that I just love that let's
[1:00:34] go to John 15 like I said before in
[1:00:36] reverses sorry verse one
[1:00:39] I am the True Vine and my father is the
[1:00:42] husbandman
[1:00:43] every branch in me that beareth not
[1:00:46] fruit he taketh away and every branch
[1:00:48] that bearth fruit he purchased it that
[1:00:51] it may bring forth more fruit amen now
[1:00:54] you are clean through the word which I
[1:00:56] have spoken unto you so you have to
[1:00:58] receive that word it can only clean you
[1:01:01] if you receive just like a pardon it's
[1:01:03] not a pardon unless received as a pardon
[1:01:05] so you got to receive that word and let
[1:01:07] it wash you let it cleanse you
[1:01:10] it says abide in me and I in you notice
[1:01:13] that's Oneness right there
[1:01:15] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:01:17] itself except it abide in the vine so we
[1:01:21] cannot bear fruit unless we abide in
[1:01:24] Jesus Christ we cannot have life and
[1:01:27] unless we recognize that life comes from
[1:01:29] him everything that we have all that any
[1:01:32] good that's in US comes from Jesus
[1:01:34] Christ I don't care how good of I
[1:01:36] remember before I gave my heart to the
[1:01:37] Lord I thought I was a good person I
[1:01:39] thought it was a good Joe
[1:01:40] but that's not to get the job done
[1:01:42] because just because there's been many
[1:01:45] good people that can go to hell I'm
[1:01:47] sorry to say it is many good people
[1:01:48] there's religions out there that would
[1:01:51] probably outshine any America any
[1:01:53] American out there just the things they
[1:01:55] do even some brother Bram said some
[1:01:57] Heathen tribes
[1:01:59] um if if a woman had sex before marriage
[1:02:03] they would kill her because that's how
[1:02:06] sacred it was to them so it's not just
[1:02:08] about how good your morals is or how
[1:02:10] good your integrity is but it's about
[1:02:12] once again abiding in Christ Oneness
[1:02:15] with Christ because if that is not your
[1:02:17] main target main goal all those other
[1:02:19] things aren't going to do you any good
[1:02:21] because even the Rich Young Ruler was a
[1:02:23] good man he followed the he followed the
[1:02:26] Commandments but Jesus gave him this
[1:02:29] trying to give him this revelation
[1:02:31] and he couldn't receive it because he
[1:02:33] was so in love with the world and the
[1:02:36] goods
[1:02:37] and so he probably he probably lived a
[1:02:39] good life after that but we find out
[1:02:41] where his destination was it was hell
[1:02:44] so he's a good man he probably even gave
[1:02:45] to the poor so let's go to verse five
[1:02:48] let's finish verse four abide in me and
[1:02:51] I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[1:02:54] of itself except it abide in the vine no
[1:02:58] more can you except you abide in me so
[1:03:01] Jesus is telling us right there you
[1:03:03] cannot be
[1:03:04] you can't bear fruit unless you abide in
[1:03:06] him unless you're one with him it's the
[1:03:08] only way it's only life
[1:03:10] he's the only way he said before verse
[1:03:12] five I am the vine you are the branches
[1:03:15] knows the branches are connected to the
[1:03:17] life
[1:03:18] he that abideth in me and I in him
[1:03:23] same bringeth forth fruit for without me
[1:03:26] you can do nothing that's why it's so
[1:03:28] important to go on to get the Holy Ghost
[1:03:30] because if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:03:32] you can never become one with God
[1:03:35] for without me knows he said for without
[1:03:37] me you can do nothing
[1:03:39] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[1:03:42] forth as a branch in his withered and
[1:03:45] Men gather them and cast them into the
[1:03:47] fire
[1:03:48] and they are burned if you abide in me
[1:03:50] and my words abide in you he shall ask
[1:03:53] what you will
[1:03:55] so you hit his word has to abide in you
[1:03:59] and then you can ask what you will and
[1:04:01] it shall be done unto you
[1:04:04] hearing is my father glorified that ye
[1:04:07] bear much fruit so shall be my disciples
[1:04:10] so the Lord is calling us to bear fruit
[1:04:14] when you plant a tree brother John an
[1:04:16] apple tree you expect it one day to grow
[1:04:19] into maturity into what bear fruit so
[1:04:23] same thing with God
[1:04:25] he expects us to to grow into maturity
[1:04:29] and start bearing fruit and that fruit
[1:04:31] isn't for yourself but it's for others
[1:04:35] that's what eternal life is is living
[1:04:37] for others
[1:04:39] and we gotta get that we got to get in
[1:04:41] that vision of that Oneness and unity if
[1:04:44] we can get that Oneness in unity with
[1:04:46] God that we can work together
[1:04:48] because that's what God is trying to get
[1:04:50] his people to be in one Accord one mind
[1:04:53] one Spirit one body so he can use us
[1:04:56] because we're an invincible Army because
[1:04:58] what God has done it's God's powers that
[1:05:01] makes us Invincible nothing that we can
[1:05:03] do no seminaries that we can go to but
[1:05:06] it's God everything's God at the
[1:05:09] beginning the end of the day is all God
[1:05:12] says Heron is my father glorified that
[1:05:14] ye bear much fruit so shall you be my
[1:05:16] disciples as a father had loved me
[1:05:20] so I have loved you and he's he's
[1:05:23] calling us come continue in my love
[1:05:27] if you keep my Commandments you shall
[1:05:30] abide in my love no it's a stipulation
[1:05:32] we have to keep the Commandments keep
[1:05:35] his word in order to abide in his love
[1:05:39] it's like I always use this example it's
[1:05:41] like you wanting to get fit lose weight
[1:05:45] and not do the things you need to do
[1:05:47] guess what's going to happen you're not
[1:05:49] going to get there if you if you want to
[1:05:51] lose 50 pounds if you want to uh shaping
[1:05:54] up tone up and you're going to the gym
[1:05:56] once every two months guess what's going
[1:05:58] to happen you're not going to do it
[1:06:00] you're not going to lose weight so the
[1:06:02] same thing you want to take it with
[1:06:03] spiritual eyes if we're not
[1:06:05] feeding on the word for not praying if
[1:06:08] we're not Desiring to be one with God
[1:06:10] thirsting hungering you've got to have a
[1:06:12] desperation to do that though you can't
[1:06:15] see you can't just have it up here but
[1:06:16] it has to be a hungering
[1:06:19] because how many people at the on a day
[1:06:21] of judgment had the knowledge that they
[1:06:23] needed to have a personal walk with God
[1:06:26] but they thought that they could go
[1:06:28] through a back door
[1:06:29] and what God desired was not just to do
[1:06:32] those Mighty Works in them but to have
[1:06:34] Oneness with them that's what God is
[1:06:36] Desiring in his he created us to be one
[1:06:39] with him
[1:06:40] he didn't create us to go do our own
[1:06:42] thing
[1:06:44] so it says verse 11. these things have I
[1:06:47] spoken unto you that my joy might remain
[1:06:50] in you that your joy might be full
[1:06:53] so I want you to notice that
[1:06:55] so if we're not keeping his Commandments
[1:06:58] for not reading like we need to for
[1:07:00] looking at our problems for looking at
[1:07:02] all these things in the cares of life is
[1:07:04] overwhelming us
[1:07:06] then of course your joy is not going to
[1:07:09] remain
[1:07:10] you have to do what Jesus has given us
[1:07:12] direct Commandments what to do to keep
[1:07:13] this Joy
[1:07:15] we got to look to him we got to be one
[1:07:17] with him
[1:07:18] we got to do what he's telling us to do
[1:07:20] it's it's so hard but it's so simple at
[1:07:24] the same time we just make it hard
[1:07:26] because we don't bury our dead men every
[1:07:28] day we don't bury this flesh every day
[1:07:30] now if we were to bury this flesh every
[1:07:32] day it'll be a lot easier for us to keep
[1:07:36] that joy to abide in his love but if
[1:07:39] we're just doing it every other day
[1:07:40] every other week I don't care how hard
[1:07:42] it is I don't care what you're going
[1:07:44] through keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:07:46] he promised him he meant he made a way
[1:07:48] for you
[1:07:49] his blood shed made a way for you
[1:07:54] so these things have I spoken unto you
[1:07:56] that my joy might remain in you thing is
[1:08:01] he wants to give you the joy it's your
[1:08:02] strength the joy of the Lord is your
[1:08:04] strength don't ever forget that
[1:08:07] this is my uh this is my commandment
[1:08:09] that ye love one another notice that's
[1:08:12] Unity
[1:08:13] absolutely
[1:08:14] and this doesn't say this is my
[1:08:16] commandment that you love one another
[1:08:18] only if they love you or when they do
[1:08:21] good to you or they buy you Christmas
[1:08:22] gifts it doesn't say any of that and it
[1:08:25] says that you love one another as I have
[1:08:28] loved you think about Jesus loved Jesus
[1:08:32] knew all the faults that the disciples
[1:08:33] had he knew that Peter was gonna
[1:08:36] um curse curse and then deny him he knew
[1:08:38] Judas was gonna uh sell them for silver
[1:08:40] or silver right
[1:08:43] gold silver silver but he still loved
[1:08:46] them
[1:08:46] he didn't have respect for persons but
[1:08:48] he loved them so he's telling us do the
[1:08:50] same thing but the thing is your human
[1:08:52] love cannot get it done
[1:08:55] that's why brother Branham said lay
[1:08:57] everything aside until you receive
[1:08:59] perfect love because our love can never
[1:09:02] get the job done it's it can only go so
[1:09:05] far so I love that song Love of God
[1:09:09] so it says greater love hath no man than
[1:09:12] this
[1:09:13] this is eternal life right here that a
[1:09:15] man laid down his life for his friends
[1:09:18] and knows right here how many wants to
[1:09:20] be a friend of God
[1:09:22] you are my friends if notice that
[1:09:26] if
[1:09:27] you do whatsoever I command you and
[1:09:30] that's why Abraham could be called a
[1:09:31] friend of God because he took God at his
[1:09:34] word and believed it did he have did he
[1:09:37] have mistakes yes do we have mistakes
[1:09:39] yes so we're just like Abraham
[1:09:42] and he's a father of our faith and he
[1:09:45] was called a friend of God because he
[1:09:46] was obedient to the Commandments of God
[1:09:49] so we want to follow on the same
[1:09:51] footsteps of Abraham and be obedient to
[1:09:54] the voice of God
[1:09:56] let's go to John 17.
[1:10:01] and we'll go to verse verse one
[1:10:03] I I I really love this I love the word I
[1:10:06] love this chapter right here I I love it
[1:10:09] these words fake Jesus and lifted up his
[1:10:11] eyes to heaven and said father the hour
[1:10:14] has come glorify thy son that thy son
[1:10:18] Also may glorify thee as thou has given
[1:10:21] him Power Over All Flesh notice that
[1:10:24] that he should give eternal life to as
[1:10:27] many as thou has given him and this is
[1:10:31] life eternal that they may know the the
[1:10:35] only true God in Jesus Christ whom thou
[1:10:38] sent Oneness notice that Oneness when
[1:10:42] one with God we were we can fill eternal
[1:10:45] life which is what living for others
[1:10:47] because you're going to have a
[1:10:48] revelation
[1:10:50] that they might know the the only true
[1:10:52] God and what was Jesus a servant
[1:10:56] he didn't care what he had to go through
[1:10:58] but he wanted to see his disciples see
[1:11:01] he saw that perfect
[1:11:03] say that glorified body he saw the
[1:11:06] finished product of what they were going
[1:11:08] to be so he knew he had to die for them
[1:11:11] to get to that point
[1:11:12] so when he died it made a way that we
[1:11:14] could have a intimate personal
[1:11:16] relationship with him
[1:11:18] and he and he he's trying to show us and
[1:11:21] tell us what it is
[1:11:23] I've glorified thee on Earth
[1:11:26] and we got to make sure that our life
[1:11:29] is glorifying God the way we think the
[1:11:31] way we conduct ourselves the way we
[1:11:33] speak the way we Act
[1:11:35] because if Jesus's mission was to
[1:11:39] glorify the father and to do what the
[1:11:41] father told him to do he said I do
[1:11:43] nothing but the father shows me notice
[1:11:46] he just wanted to do what the father he
[1:11:47] had such a hungering and thirsting to do
[1:11:49] exactly what the father said we've got
[1:11:52] to have the same exact uh desire and
[1:11:55] Desperation to exactly what Jesus is
[1:11:57] telling us to do as well
[1:11:59] I have glorified thee on Earth I have
[1:12:02] finished the work which thou gavest me
[1:12:05] to do
[1:12:07] I don't know if tomorrow's promised or
[1:12:09] how long we're going to be in this Earth
[1:12:10] but the end of our life can we say the
[1:12:13] same testimony I have finished the work
[1:12:15] which thou gave us me to do
[1:12:18] and now oh Father glorify glorify thou
[1:12:22] me with thy own self with the glory
[1:12:24] which I had with thee before the world
[1:12:27] was
[1:12:28] in the mind of God
[1:12:30] I have manifested thy name unto the men
[1:12:34] which thou gavest me out of the world
[1:12:36] thine they were and thou gavest them me
[1:12:40] and they have kept Thy word now they
[1:12:43] have known that all things what Surah
[1:12:46] whatsoever thou has given me are of thee
[1:12:49] amen for I have given unto them The
[1:12:51] Words which thou gave us me and they
[1:12:54] have received them
[1:12:56] so we got to make sure each time we're
[1:12:58] coming to service we're receiving the
[1:13:01] words that God has for us
[1:13:05] and have known surely that I came out
[1:13:08] from thee and they have believed that
[1:13:10] thou did Ascend me love is right here I
[1:13:13] pray for them I pray not for the world
[1:13:16] but for them which thou has given me for
[1:13:18] they are thy
[1:13:20] in all our mind all our all our mind are
[1:13:24] thine in thine are mine now that's a
[1:13:26] little tongue twister and I'm glorified
[1:13:28] in them
[1:13:30] and now I am no more I love it I am
[1:13:32] glorified in them
[1:13:35] Christ the hope of glory the Christ
[1:13:37] revealed the mystery in you
[1:13:39] him being glorified through you I love
[1:13:42] that that's what Jesus wants is to be
[1:13:44] glorified through our vessels he wants
[1:13:47] to use our hands our feet our eyes our
[1:13:49] lips to be to glorify himself to others
[1:13:53] and now I am no more in the world but
[1:13:56] these are in the world I come to thee
[1:13:58] Holy Father keep through thy own name
[1:14:01] Those whom thou has given me
[1:14:06] given me that they may be one notice
[1:14:08] that whom thou has given me that they
[1:14:11] may be one amen I swear Oneness that's
[1:14:17] what God desire Oneness he says as we
[1:14:22] are notice that
[1:14:24] while I was with them in the world I
[1:14:27] kept them in thy name those that gave us
[1:14:29] me I have kept and none of them is lost
[1:14:31] but the Son of Perdition that the
[1:14:34] scripture might be fulfilled and now
[1:14:36] come I to thee in these things I speak
[1:14:39] in the world that they might have my joy
[1:14:43] fulfilled in themselves I said before
[1:14:48] we can't let trials we can't let the
[1:14:51] cares of this life overcharge us because
[1:14:54] the minute that we do that we lose the
[1:14:57] joy we start to lose the Oneness with
[1:14:59] God
[1:15:00] he gave us a perfect formula and we're
[1:15:03] going to read that a little later
[1:15:05] says
[1:15:08] I have given them verse 14 Thy word and
[1:15:11] the world hath hated them because they
[1:15:13] are not of the world even as I am not of
[1:15:16] the world we not we are not of this
[1:15:18] world
[1:15:20] we're not
[1:15:21] we're here to be Witnesses ambassadors
[1:15:25] we're here to bring people to Unity
[1:15:30] I pray that I would just take them out
[1:15:32] the world but thou shall keepeth them
[1:15:34] from the evil
[1:15:36] they are not of the world even as I am
[1:15:40] not of the world
[1:15:42] sanctify them through thy truth Thy word
[1:15:45] is truth that's what we said before
[1:15:48] you've got to receive you gotta accept
[1:15:50] all the word of God you got to eat eat
[1:15:52] the book
[1:15:53] because all this word is truth only
[1:15:55] thing this word is going to do for you
[1:15:57] is help you I promise you it's going to
[1:16:00] help you
[1:16:01] it may not feel like it may not feel
[1:16:03] as if it's helping right now but it is
[1:16:06] helping
[1:16:08] it's like when brother Brandon would
[1:16:09] take that castor oil
[1:16:12] it helped may not taste good it made a
[1:16:14] burn or it would but it helped and the
[1:16:18] word of God not only helps but it
[1:16:19] restores you
[1:16:21] it brings you to a finished product
[1:16:23] because we're going to a finished
[1:16:24] product whether we like it or not we're
[1:16:27] going to a finished product that God has
[1:16:30] thou has sent me into the world
[1:16:33] even so I've also sent them into the
[1:16:35] world so the things that we're going
[1:16:37] through the trials the tribulations
[1:16:38] they're for a reason perfecting of our
[1:16:42] faith so we can get christ-like
[1:16:44] character
[1:16:45] and that's why if you look how Paul he
[1:16:48] said I glory in my persecutions I glory
[1:16:50] in my trials afflictions weapons and if
[1:16:55] we would more just look to God during
[1:16:57] the trial instead of how hard it is
[1:17:00] because God it says brother brother John
[1:17:02] read this uh in Philippians 2 says do
[1:17:06] all things without murmurings and
[1:17:08] disputings notice that it says do all
[1:17:11] things not just the things that you want
[1:17:14] to but all things
[1:17:17] see if we looked at this price we had so
[1:17:20] many afflictions oh we can probably go
[1:17:21] to our life and to see all the things
[1:17:22] we've been through or even right now we
[1:17:24] might be through some hard times but if
[1:17:27] we can keep our eyes on the Oneness with
[1:17:29] God keep our eyes at Lord I'm going
[1:17:31] through these things to be closer to to
[1:17:34] be brought closer to you because your
[1:17:36] trials only can either they can bring
[1:17:38] you away from God or closer to God and
[1:17:40] we look at the children of Israel
[1:17:42] most of them
[1:17:44] brought them away from God but not
[1:17:45] Joshua and Caleb it brought them closer
[1:17:48] to God Amen and in fact we just see even
[1:17:52] after the 40 years Joshua and Keith were
[1:17:54] probably even more in love with God than
[1:17:56] what they were before
[1:18:00] as for their sakes I sanctify myself
[1:18:03] that they also might be Sanctified
[1:18:05] through the truth
[1:18:07] right he's speaking to us he's talking
[1:18:09] about us neither pray for for I for
[1:18:11] these alone
[1:18:13] but for them also which Shall Believe on
[1:18:15] me through their word he's he's praying
[1:18:17] for us
[1:18:18] he's praying for us I'm really one more
[1:18:20] time neither pray for for I for these
[1:18:23] alone but for them also We Shall Believe
[1:18:26] on me through their word
[1:18:29] ready to know something that they all
[1:18:32] may be one
[1:18:34] notice that as thou father are in me and
[1:18:39] I EnV that they also may be one
[1:18:44] in US
[1:18:45] the world may believe that thou has sent
[1:18:48] me
[1:18:49] so we could become one with God that's
[1:18:52] when we become an effective witness in
[1:18:55] the kingdom of God we have to have
[1:18:58] Oneness to Be an Effective witness of
[1:19:00] God when the disciples were witnessing
[1:19:03] and establing churches they were
[1:19:05] effective because they were one with God
[1:19:07] they didn't care about in fact they even
[1:19:10] sold all they had and they were still
[1:19:12] one they didn't care what they had to do
[1:19:15] to get the gospel across the world they
[1:19:18] were willing to do anything
[1:19:20] to make help to to be one with God
[1:19:23] says that they all met we were there
[1:19:25] verse 22 and the glory which thou gave
[1:19:27] us me I have given them who amen that
[1:19:31] they may be I love us one even as we are
[1:19:35] one notice is how many how much is one
[1:19:38] Oneness Oneness Oneness Oneness is so
[1:19:40] important
[1:19:42] and especially not just when you're
[1:19:44] wearing a hard time or a trial but even
[1:19:46] the good times you want that to carry
[1:19:48] over you want that to be consistent
[1:19:51] because a lot of times man we have a
[1:19:53] tendency of calling on God desperately
[1:19:56] when we're in a time of need but if we
[1:19:58] can call God
[1:20:00] in the on the Mountaintop and in the
[1:20:02] valley we're not the trial wouldn't
[1:20:04] surprise us because the scripture tells
[1:20:06] us exactly what a trial does the trying
[1:20:09] of your faith
[1:20:12] father I will
[1:20:14] oh I'm sorry verse 23.
[1:20:16] i in them and thou in me that they may
[1:20:21] be made perfect in one and if the world
[1:20:26] may know that thou has sent me and has
[1:20:30] loved them as thou Hast loved me
[1:20:34] God God loved you so much that he made a
[1:20:38] plan that he would have to die for you
[1:20:41] to be one with him tell me if that's not
[1:20:43] love
[1:20:44] that's the definition of love right
[1:20:46] there
[1:20:47] not even a human definition can describe
[1:20:50] the love of God it can't even scrape the
[1:20:52] surface of the love of God not even that
[1:20:54] love of God song Can scrape the love of
[1:20:57] God
[1:20:59] not even if you knew a hundred languages
[1:21:01] there's over 7 000 different languages
[1:21:03] that are recorded and even then it still
[1:21:06] could not escape the love of God
[1:21:10] father I would they also whom thou has
[1:21:12] given me be with me where I am notice
[1:21:15] that's a promise that they may behold my
[1:21:18] glory which thou has given me for thou
[1:21:20] love has been before the foundation of
[1:21:22] the world o righteous father the world
[1:21:25] has not known me but I have known thee
[1:21:27] and these have known that thou have sent
[1:21:30] me and I have declared unto them thy
[1:21:32] name and will declare it
[1:21:34] that that the love foreth thou has loved
[1:21:37] me notice that may be in them and I in
[1:21:43] them I can see why our Prophet said lay
[1:21:46] everything aside until you get perfect
[1:21:48] love
[1:21:49] amen let's go to
[1:21:52] John 3 30.
[1:22:02] notice what the the prophet said here
[1:22:04] John the Baptist
[1:22:06] he says
[1:22:10] he must increase but I must decrease
[1:22:15] so we have to decrease in order for God
[1:22:18] to increase and when we decrease that's
[1:22:21] when the Oneness of God Amen happens
[1:22:25] so the Way Up Is Down
[1:22:27] so you gotta we gotta humble ourselves
[1:22:32] it's like Jesus is so through all we
[1:22:34] read right now Jesus the main theme what
[1:22:37] Jesus is trying to get to us we have to
[1:22:40] keep that Oneness with him
[1:22:42] because he he did all these things that
[1:22:44] we could have the Oneness and now we
[1:22:45] have to fight for that Oneness because
[1:22:47] this is the hardest age we live in but
[1:22:49] it's not impossible to live in because
[1:22:51] you got to do it through God he has to
[1:22:53] be your Source your power source your
[1:22:55] main power source
[1:22:57] not not some self-help book some
[1:22:59] motivational speakers but God has to be
[1:23:01] your main source
[1:23:03] if we are so overwhelmed in life's
[1:23:07] issues so distracted then we're going to
[1:23:09] lose that Unity with God when you lose
[1:23:12] that Unity with God you start to lose
[1:23:15] what your joy and your peace don't let
[1:23:19] the cares of Life take you away from
[1:23:21] your personal walk with God it's the
[1:23:24] only thing that's going to matter at the
[1:23:25] end of the day
[1:23:26] remember I do not care how hard it gets
[1:23:29] you keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:23:31] he told us in Matthew 6 33 we can all
[1:23:34] probably quote this
[1:23:35] but it's it's a lot more than quoting it
[1:23:38] and living it it's a big difference
[1:23:40] but it says so we read in this chapter
[1:23:42] all these things that he knows we have
[1:23:44] need of he said even he said behold the
[1:23:47] fowls of the air for they Soul not
[1:23:48] neither do they reap nor gather into
[1:23:50] barns check this out yet your heavenly
[1:23:53] father feedeth him he says are ye not
[1:23:55] much better than they that's Jesus
[1:23:57] speaking right that's not me speaking
[1:23:59] that's Jesus speaking
[1:24:01] but seek ye first the kingdom of God you
[1:24:04] might say well brother Mark I've seek in
[1:24:06] the Kingdom
[1:24:07] well if you're really seeking the
[1:24:09] kingdom then you wouldn't be looking and
[1:24:10] be distracted by the cares of this life
[1:24:12] you wouldn't be overwhelmed or you would
[1:24:15] we wouldn't be
[1:24:17] I hate to say this church wouldn't be
[1:24:18] empty
[1:24:20] if we were really seeking God like he's
[1:24:22] telling us to seek the church wouldn't
[1:24:23] be empty I know it's hard words but it's
[1:24:25] the truth
[1:24:26] and we got to God to seek first the
[1:24:29] kingdom of God he knows we have need of
[1:24:31] all these he knows you need strength to
[1:24:33] to fight through this trial he knows you
[1:24:35] need all these things uh whatever a car
[1:24:37] or maybe money to pay the bills or or
[1:24:41] whatever it is you fill in the blank he
[1:24:43] knows we have need of all these things
[1:24:44] but he says and his righteousness and
[1:24:48] all these things shall be added unto you
[1:24:50] he wants to add these things unto you
[1:24:51] but if we can't be faithful to God how
[1:24:54] can he be faithful to us I'm saying one
[1:24:56] more time if we're not faithful to God
[1:24:59] then how can he be faithful to us he
[1:25:01] told us in
[1:25:02] John 17.
[1:25:04] about the commit following his
[1:25:05] Commandments and you abide in his love
[1:25:08] you have joy you have all these things
[1:25:10] but if we're not following what God is
[1:25:12] telling us to do then how do we expect
[1:25:14] God to move in in our situation
[1:25:17] when Jesus was a walk here to pass by a
[1:25:20] town because there was so much unbelief
[1:25:22] there he couldn't do anything so God
[1:25:25] can't do anything in your life if you're
[1:25:27] doubting him if you're not seeking him
[1:25:29] his hands are tied he's not a God who
[1:25:32] forces himself but he's a God who moves
[1:25:34] by your faith by your confession by your
[1:25:36] profession
[1:25:38] that's the only way that God can move in
[1:25:40] your life if you profess that he can
[1:25:41] move you profess as he that he's your
[1:25:43] healer that he's your deliverer
[1:25:46] see you can't just get you can't get God
[1:25:47] because brother John said he's his
[1:25:49] deliverer or healer you have to claim it
[1:25:52] personally that when he said blessed are
[1:25:54] they who hunger and thirst after
[1:25:56] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:25:57] you have to claim that for yourself
[1:25:59] personally that's a promise that God has
[1:26:01] written to you personally
[1:26:03] and there's so many promises but they
[1:26:06] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:26:07] their strength that's a promise you have
[1:26:09] to claim you have to wait there's no
[1:26:11] time limit on how long you have to wait
[1:26:13] it says wait
[1:26:16] don't be discouraged don't be dismayed
[1:26:19] he knows what you have neither Daniel
[1:26:21] Prayed for 21 days straight
[1:26:23] and he let that one time discourage him
[1:26:27] the angel even said God said I heard
[1:26:29] your prayers from the very first day
[1:26:31] but there are some things that had had
[1:26:33] to happen there's some a little
[1:26:35] roadblocks that had to happen and the
[1:26:37] same thing maybe you're praying for
[1:26:38] something for a long time God has heard
[1:26:41] it from the very first time you prayed
[1:26:43] it did not fall it did not fall to the
[1:26:46] ground he knows what you have need of
[1:26:48] it's just waiting for the perfect timing
[1:26:50] for it to be fulfilled
[1:26:52] amen hallelujah
[1:26:55] amen pray hardest when it's hardest to
[1:26:58] pray
[1:27:00] serve
[1:27:01] when his heart is to serve read when
[1:27:04] it's hardest to read listen to a tape
[1:27:07] when it's hard hardest to listen to a
[1:27:09] tape notice that it's so easy to to read
[1:27:12] the word of God when all your time is
[1:27:14] just open it's so easy to pray when you
[1:27:17] don't have anything really going on is
[1:27:18] Easy Street it's easy listen to a tape
[1:27:21] when you're not that busy but I'll tell
[1:27:23] you what the real Victory is doing it
[1:27:26] when your time is so eating up but you
[1:27:28] still make sincere time to God because
[1:27:31] that's what's gonna get the growth
[1:27:33] that's where the growth happens when
[1:27:35] you're doing things when it's hard as to
[1:27:36] do
[1:27:37] that's how that growth happens
[1:27:40] let's go to Luke 21.
[1:27:46] I feel like I even like even
[1:27:48] scaved this that's why I could see why
[1:27:50] the Lord once wants a series because
[1:27:52] it's so much
[1:27:55] I just love that
[1:27:57] that God just wants us to be one with
[1:27:59] him I just love that
[1:28:02] so here's another a remedy verse 21 or
[1:28:05] vert sorry chapter 21 of Luke verse 34.
[1:28:08] and take heed to yourselves less at any
[1:28:10] time your hearts be overcharged with
[1:28:14] surfeiting notice that
[1:28:16] and drunkenness and the cares of this
[1:28:19] life
[1:28:20] and so the day come upon you unawares
[1:28:23] for as a snare shall come on all them
[1:28:26] that dwell on the face of the if
[1:28:28] notice that so nobody is excluded for uh
[1:28:33] having cares of this life troubles
[1:28:35] problems everybody is going to have
[1:28:37] those and whether you're serving God or
[1:28:38] not serving God you're going to have
[1:28:40] these problems but Jesus is trying for
[1:28:42] us to take heed so these things don't
[1:28:46] overwhelm us they don't distract us he's
[1:28:48] trying to warn us that's what God that's
[1:28:51] what Jesus is trying to do in his in his
[1:28:52] exit right here he's trying to warn us
[1:28:54] of these things that will take you away
[1:28:56] from the Oneness of God for the snare
[1:28:58] should compound all of them that dwell
[1:29:00] on the face of the Earth
[1:29:02] of the whole earth watch right here is
[1:29:04] the remedy watch ye therefore and pray
[1:29:07] always that is the remedy right there
[1:29:09] you got to be watching and praying
[1:29:11] always says that ye may be accounted
[1:29:14] worthy to escape what all these things
[1:29:18] that shall come to pass and to stand
[1:29:19] before the son of man so right here
[1:29:22] that's a remedy to any fiery trial
[1:29:24] you're going through any uh you feel
[1:29:26] like you can't break through you just
[1:29:27] keep praying until you have a
[1:29:28] breakthrough keep praying keep praying
[1:29:31] so my brother Brandon said neology
[1:29:33] that's the key
[1:29:34] amen let's go to Psalms 27.
[1:29:39] we'll go it's our last scripture then
[1:29:40] we'll close with a quote
[1:29:42] I'm going the wrong way
[1:29:52] so I don't know here maybe somebody here
[1:29:54] tonight uh I don't know the secrets of
[1:29:57] your heart but maybe some tonight or
[1:29:59] maybe going through a struggle
[1:30:01] but whatever you're going through I love
[1:30:03] this in Psalms 27. so let's start with
[1:30:06] verse 1.
[1:30:07] this is my this is my life the Lord is
[1:30:10] my light and my salvation Whom Shall I
[1:30:13] Fear so what trial do we have to fear
[1:30:15] he's our light in our Salvation the Lord
[1:30:18] is the what the strength of my life of
[1:30:21] whom shall I be afraid when the wicked
[1:30:24] even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me
[1:30:26] to eat up my flesh they stumbled and
[1:30:28] fell
[1:30:29] though a host shouldn't Camp against me
[1:30:32] my heart shall not for we give you say
[1:30:34] like this though fiery trials should
[1:30:36] just engulf my life
[1:30:39] against me my heart shall not fear
[1:30:42] though War should rise against me and
[1:30:45] this will I be confident
[1:30:47] one thing have I desired of the Lord
[1:30:50] that I will seek after that I may dwell
[1:30:53] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[1:30:57] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:30:59] and to inquire in his Temple Oneness
[1:31:02] with God that's how you strive for
[1:31:04] Oneness you got to seek after that
[1:31:06] Oneness that you may dwell in the house
[1:31:08] of the Lord all the days of your life
[1:31:10] and behold the beauty of the Lord and
[1:31:12] inquiring his Temple verse 5.
[1:31:15] for in the time of trouble knows that
[1:31:17] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[1:31:20] me in his Pavilion but if our eyes are
[1:31:22] not on Christ how can he hide you
[1:31:24] because that's where your strength is at
[1:31:26] is in Christ and if we're not faithful
[1:31:28] to Christ how do you expect him to hide
[1:31:31] you in this Pavilion
[1:31:33] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[1:31:36] hide me he shall set me upon a Rock Amen
[1:31:41] amen we're going to verse seven or
[1:31:44] number six and now shall my head be
[1:31:46] lifted up above my enemies round about
[1:31:48] me therefore I offer in his Tabernacles
[1:31:51] sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will
[1:31:54] sing praises unto the Lord Praise when
[1:31:56] it's hardest to praise lift him up when
[1:32:00] his heart is to lift him up glorify him
[1:32:02] when his heart is to glorify him
[1:32:04] we got to praise and worship the Lord
[1:32:06] I'm our brother Joseph
[1:32:08] said this statement to me uh I think it
[1:32:10] was like last last two Saturdays ago a
[1:32:13] lot of times we just go to God with our
[1:32:15] needs but let's just go god let's just
[1:32:16] go to God and just just thank him praise
[1:32:19] and worship let's just don't even ask
[1:32:21] anything but that just thank him and
[1:32:22] praise and worship him I guarantee the
[1:32:24] atmosphere will just change I'm I
[1:32:25] remember doing that I was like wow I
[1:32:27] feel so selfish I was doing it before
[1:32:29] just go to God and thank him for his
[1:32:32] goodness praise him for his word his
[1:32:34] holiness yeah
[1:32:36] oh Lord when I cry with my voice have
[1:32:39] mercy also upon me and answer me when
[1:32:42] thou says when thou said it's seek ye my
[1:32:45] face my heart said unto thee thy face
[1:32:48] Lord will I seek
[1:32:52] amen
[1:32:54] in verse 14 says wait on the Lord and be
[1:32:56] of good courage and he shall strengthen
[1:32:58] thy heart wait I say on the Lord David's
[1:33:02] telling us to wait
[1:33:03] last quote I'll sister show you can come
[1:33:06] up
[1:33:08] we got to put this flesh under
[1:33:09] subjection
[1:33:11] you control your flesh not your flesh
[1:33:13] control you remember that
[1:33:15] God is calling us to a daily Oneness a
[1:33:18] daily Unity with him and it takes us
[1:33:20] fully surrendering to him if we don't
[1:33:23] surrender then we lose our chance to be
[1:33:25] one with him for the day we need to make
[1:33:27] it a number one priority to achieve this
[1:33:30] every day each time you wake up he's
[1:33:33] inviting God is inviting us to Oneness
[1:33:36] into Unity
[1:33:37] don't don't Adam Adam Eve Adam let me
[1:33:40] cry out to you don't listen to a lie of
[1:33:42] the devil anymore
[1:33:44] stay with God's word he's talking to us
[1:33:46] it's thus saith the Lord stay with his
[1:33:49] word to separate from it is breaking
[1:33:52] your fellowship with God God's Oneness
[1:33:55] by the Holy Spirit but if you say you
[1:33:58] got the Holy Spirit and it's not in
[1:34:00] agreeance with the agree with the word
[1:34:03] then you're not Oneness with God
[1:34:05] this is God's Oneness when you the
[1:34:08] spirit that you got agrees with this
[1:34:10] word
[1:34:11] and Manifest this word and makes this
[1:34:15] word power to act the same way it did
[1:34:18] there let's say it together Oneness with
[1:34:21] God is to have God's spirit in you
[1:34:24] agreeing with the word all the word the
[1:34:28] whole word and to make it manifest in
[1:34:30] power there you are that's Oneness with
[1:34:33] God
[1:34:34] the power Works in me Works in you we
[1:34:37] are one Amen brother kid when the power
[1:34:40] of the Holy Ghost In Me Works in you
[1:34:42] there is no disagreement the words there
[1:34:45] praise God it works amen and it makes
[1:34:48] what it is God made flesh in You by his
[1:34:53] word amen I'm ready again God made flesh
[1:34:57] in You by his word the word made Power
[1:35:00] among you every word
[1:35:04] amen so this closing thought
[1:35:07] we gotta strive for that Oneness we want
[1:35:09] to see unity in the body of Christ we
[1:35:11] got to be one with God first we got to
[1:35:14] make sure everything's in order every
[1:35:15] day we got to be one with God no excuses
[1:35:17] we just got to do it because I promise
[1:35:20] you the quicker we get to that the more
[1:35:23] God can begin to use us and the
[1:35:25] magnitude that he wants to use us so
[1:35:27] Oneness is so important even Jesus
[1:35:30] prayed for us to be one
[1:35:32] so that's how much you want us to be one
[1:35:34] let's just rise and maybe it's just a
[1:35:37] Cheryl can just play something Softly As
