you this morning how good it is to be in the house of the Lord amen amen let's turn in our bibles if you brought yours to Psalms uh 267 and if you haven't but we do put some of the scriptures on the board but it's always good to have your sword with you right if you go to battle amen good to see each and every one amen good to be in God's house good to be with our Brothers and Sisters in Christ so good to have um our friends Charlie and Debbie with us again God bless you may the Lord bless you again for coming being with us let's look to the Lord in prayer before we read words Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for giving us your word that's why we've come here today is to hear from you not from man but from you and we pray Lord that as we look into these words we know that we need the author the very Holy Spirit to to unveil these things that we would hear so we ask now Lord that you would remove every hindrance that would be in our life forgive us of any sins any unbelief any doubts or fears we pray that you take them far from this place and Lord we ask that you would give us a faith like never before in your word Lord to take a hold of the promises that you have given for your your children the Believers in this age that are holding true to you please come Lord in a supernatural way to every one of our hearts May there be just a vindication that your presence is here Lord we'll be careful to give you the glory and honor as you you purpose your will this morning in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen Psalms 26 and we're just going to read the very last verse and continue on chapter 27 Psalms 26:1 says my foot standeth in an even place right in the congregations well I bless the Lord so if you just notice this morning our feet are standing on an even place you know what you're in the hill a rock a hole you know can be unstable but here in the house of the Lord amen amen in the congregation we standeth in an even place now let's read the Lord is my light in my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the Wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell and though a whole should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War even War should rise up against me in this will I be confident one thing if I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up Upon A Rock Amen and now shall my head be lifted up I want to take our text from this verse and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me there will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord amen God bless you you may be seated uh I do want to read one more verse and that's Philippians chapter 4 verse 19 Philippians chapter 4 verse 19 they kind of go along with our our text today and is a familiar scripture Philippians 4:19 says but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus amen amen God is the one that takes care of us amen well there's a lot of problems all over the world Amen we could spend all day talking about the things that are happening all over and we don't know honestly the half of it that's true there's just so many terrible things happening in the world problems that seems like this world is going on a roller coaster down we could talk about those things and we could talk about the things that would make those situations perhaps better but you and I as individuals there's not a whole lot that we could do to change like we would like to see the change in those things I want to focus on the problems that can make a real difference in our personal lives today how many can agree that there's a a lot of stuff a lot of drama that can that goes on in our personal lives amen and I I believe it's something that we could we could focus on today I want to en title this message looking beyond our problems amen and for a subject it's all in your head amen how many times have we heard that that's all in your head often times what you're meaning is that you're you're making that stuff up in your head that's what they're meaning but it's not always the case but I will say this when I say it's all in your head really what I'm saying is that our mind is a dangerous mind field it has the ability to imagine the worst case scenario how many times we've done that it has the ability to dramatically change the reality in our minds to reason why it's it's really okay to not follow all the word of God can you say amen amen yes it it has the ability to leave out important details to to actually to do harmful thing to to actually think ill of others and feel okay with it you ever do that just well they shouldn't have done that so it's it's a dangerous mindfield right here it's the ability to brag and vaun ourselves and be arrogant and selfish and self centered and be okay with it I think these are some things that we can help the change in our lives to make our lives our minds better I believe we can get so caught up in our personal desires that we can EAS easily ignore reality now out in the world it is a massive confusion I don't care what subject you take you get on one side of that subject and then will'll point out things to the other side of the subject that make sense doesn't make what they're doing right but it makes sense and you go over here and they could do the same thing any subject you want anywhere around the world because see Satan is the author of confusion and he wants you just out there spinning your wheels and going nowhere fast but see our mind was not made for that God wants our mind to be at peace to Be steady to be sound but our mind can be a dangerous mind field God God gave us amazing power to make decisions in our mind as long as we make the right decision everything is well but as soon as we begin to make selfish decisions then disaster awaits us amen said that power without character is satanic power with character is to be able to choose God's will over our own but when we take that power that he's given us and choose our will over the word of God that is what's satanic amen are you with me amen the devil wants to get into the thoughts of our mind and begin to manipulate our decisions we've all watched Sports before most of us have and the other team the opponent is always trying to get in the other person's head to manipulate them to you know to get them scared I remember brother Bill telling about a story he used to go to school here in South Lion they had a terrible football team they just were always losing they were playing this real big team and they were down I don't know some great number to nothing something like that and and he's up at the line and the guy from the other team who's bigger and Bolder and and winning looks over at brother Bill and says we coming over to get inside the mine and to manipulate the Devils that's the devil's job said the message is the greatest battle of her fault speaking of God and the devil fight he said there has to be a place selected in this place there's a mutual ground no man's land they fight here at this place they just don't uh they just don't one fight over here and one over there and and run and run here there's a battle where where they meet and test their powers where each Army test its strength against the other a mutual meet meeting place don't miss this he says now this great battle started on Earth there had been a a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and the battle to rage and the battle Grand began in the human mind right this is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it is to begin and that is because that decisions are made in the mind the head the Battlegrounds where you got to meet your enemy is in your mind you've got to make your choice it it it it it meets you and I want this little girl that's very sick here to be sure to listen now to this very closely decisions are made in the mind the head this is where Satan meets you and decisions are because God made man that way if the church right now could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be in one Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere there would not be one feeble person in our midst in the next five minutes true amen there would not be nobody here Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would receive it if you could just get that certain thing fixed and there is where the battle begins right in your mind uh whether you will so we have a power in our mind today we don't have to listen to the devil we don't have to listen we just got to recognize amen that they're not our thoughts that the the enemy puts them there brother Brandon praying at the end of the invasion of the United States he says oh father while the great darkness is on the battle and the devil invading the countries invading the pulpits invading the churches invading the peoples invading the businesses invading the cities and the schools and the homes oh God help us to stand and pull the sword quickly and fight for God as Moses and the Levites did sit down there with sin in the camp help us Lord forgive us now and bless us and keep us humble break us up Lord of Lord oh God you said he that goeth forth sowing tears shall doubtless return again rejoicing bringing with him sheep oh God break us to Pieces mold us a new Lord we're getting too much out of the way out of God's way amen amen stay humble that's how you that's how you beat the devil that's how you beat the devil is humble not because the more you can go like this the more you're going to miss doing what the word wants you to do so the mind of man can be a dangerous mindfield amen uncontrollable unstable wavering back and forth on subjects are you with me amen I I want you this morning to say Amen to the word James 1:6 says for he that waver is like the wave of a sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man is UN stable in all his ways we've seen people that are just unstable they can't seem to get anywhere in life and it's not because God made them different they just never recognize the Enemy talking to them amen because if the devil can ever get you to think it's God you'll listen but we we've got to try the spirit see because God is not going to author confusion to anybody amen he's going to take somebody in a confused State and bring them out in a sound in a sound mind amen some people are like the weather they changed their mind a lot wherever they're at today you just can't count on it tomorrow they have a hard time following through or being committed with things going from Pillar To Post from this idea to that idea from this person to that person Proverbs 163 three says here's an answer not being negative this morning I'm trying to find answers for our lives amen amen commit thy Works unto the Lord and thy thoughts shall be established that's right commit your ways commit your life remove everything out of the way that isn't this word and walk with the word amen don't well this is how I feel this is get away from that that's where the danger comes in amen we've got to make sure it's the word of God now just as the devil can mess up a man's life God can take that same man's mind and straighten it out that's right he has power God can take the biggest mind mess there is and straighten it out amen amen we need some amens with that one amen because there's no situation that's too too great for our Goden second Timothy 1:7 says for God have not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind a sound mind now is really capable of doing the will of the Lord while you're suffering amen but an unsound mind can't do that an unsound mind is not willing to suffer if you just you look at Peter Peter he said oh I'm so sold out to God but when it came down to to the acid test where he had to actually Suffer Well then he started walking away from the word which was walking away from Jesus even denied even swore that he didn't know Jesus Anymore amen because he had not received the spirit of a sound mind and that comes by the Holy Ghost amen comes by it's not a it's not a gift you're born with it's a gift that's it it it's part of the Holy Ghost amen amen A sound mind has the capability of doing God's will when things are stacked against you amen when everyone's against you when you feel alone when things aren't going your way a sound mind can still do the will of God Faithfully through adversity amen that's the why it's so important to have a sound mind amen A sound mind comes from God it does not entertain spirit of fear amen amen it trust in God no matter what I'll say it's easy to serve God on our terms right it's very hard to serve God on his terms his terms are a full commitment to the word our terms is a partial commitment are you with me amen amen that's why just because we're we say we're a Christian we're serving God we got to make sure that that we're making the decisions that the Bible tells us to make amen amen and when a man surrenders his his life to the word of God he chooses to obey the word more than he's been doing God is going to bless him with blessings that he hasn't received yet amen because that's just how God is the more you give God the more that God gives you amen true now who is our Real Enemy now if no body had ever heard the message before they would never get this right thank God that he sent a message amen amen it's not our brother it's not our sister it's not even our pastor amen it's not her wife it's not her husband it's not her neighbor it's not her coworker it's not our boss it's not the other political party it's not the government or our taxes we have the ability to call anything or anyone our enemy who we choose but brother BR said our greatest enemy is ourselves brother R said my greatest enemy is William brandham amen and here's the scripture right here I want to give you for this Romans 8:7 because because the carnal mind is enity against God that means hostile our carnal mind is hostile against God everybody's born with that carnal mind right yes Amen in other words for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can it be it's Lawless it just does its own thing uncontrollable hatred against the truth against the will of God in other words it doesn't really want to esteem others better than itself it doesn't want to lay down its life for others it it doesn't want to reach out because it doesn't have enough time to live for itself come on it's the word of God now you understand we all battle the enemy within us amen amen the enemy up here he uses our mind amen the enemy of our carnal mind is what keeps us from obeying what God wants us to do amen and it's always there you come to church and hear the truth and the devil's right there trying to get you to doubt it I'll say it's time to take a stand not against others but against the enemy that's in our mind against the enemy who manipulates our mind to judge others to not care about others to be selfish to be lovers of our own selves and not willing to crucify the flesh how many times have we heard you know you should spend some time praying you should die out you know you shouldn't be acting like that you just kind of Shake It Off I ain't got time maybe later right amen come on we're we're just trying to deal with the reality that happens inside of our minds I want you to take a look at our opening scripture now shall my head my head be lifted up above my enemies that are round about me amen they're circulating inside our head amen trying to get us off track that's the enemy amen it's the Battleground it's where he meets us we need to lift our heads our our the mindset that we're in we need to lift up our heads above the enemy who is trying to get us to lift ourselves amen amen our selfish nature need to lift our our heads out of the carnal state of doubts and fears yes stubbornness and Rebellion procrastination and negativity and those things that we we learn to be content with that is not the Holy Spirit that's the end enemy that has gotten into our minds and that drives us down to a hopeless condition amen 2 Corinthians 10 chapter 4 it says for the weapons of our Warfare they're not carnal amen but they're Mighty through God Amen to the pulling down of strongholds amen we're not choosing to use the weapons that this world uses every day we don't choose to yell and scream and manipulate and hate and give the silent treatment or talk negative give a cold shoulder give a storefront fakeness the list goes on and on we don't choose to use those weapons dealing with others amen not choose these weapons in our mind in fact we pull hold down these strongholds amen we don't yield to the feelings that bring the wrong weapons right if you yield to your feelings you want to straighten them out you're going to let them know nobody talks to you that way I'm telling you power to turn the cheat to go the second mile to give us off all all that is character amen amen am some people may look at that as just a little wishy-washy no when you can keep that devil from raging in your mind when you can lift your head up above that amen hallelujah amen right I'd rather have that than all the money in the world look at verse five casting down imaginations right and every High thing that exalts itself against what against the knowledge of God Amen and bring it into captivity every thought Amen to obey the word of God Amen and having a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when when you obey the word when your obedience becomes fulfilled right when our mind starts to engage in a battle maybe somebody acts wrong towards us or says something that upsets us the word of God says a soft answer turns away raft true right that means we've got to cast down every thought that says they're wrong or we're right or I'm going to prove something you got to cast that down you got to lift your head up above your enemy amen amen you got look beyond your current problem and you've got to give that soft answer that is the answer to that that's the solution to that problem see I believe in a I believe that we should be putting our time to building the character of Jesus Christ in our lives amen amen because God is not coming back for an earth that's in order a world that's in order he already made it clear I am not of this world and he prayed for us and he said we are not of this world we're in it but we're not of it and I think we're wasting our time if we're not building the character of Jesus Christ inside of us amen amen we have to make a decision in our minds I'm not going to let the devil Advance I'm not ignorant of his devices if somebody steps on your toe you want this thing to escalate step on theirs yeah that's right but you remember real character is being able to do the will of God in adversity amen and the will of God sometimes can say let me get out of your way right when he had every intention to hurt you let me get out of your way all of a sudden you diffuse the situation that's right will you take that mentality with your relationships at home your relationships with your spouses your kids those that you work with your brothers and sisters and I'm telling you it's a reality you can look beyond the problem and see the answer that God is going to supply the need can you say amen amen now I'll tell you I know this is not as enjoyable as sitting and listen to a lot of mysteries unfold but you know that there's no character there's nothing you have to do except listen and enjoy you can know all the Mysteries and it one profit anything the Bible says you could hear a great sermon feel really really good you heard one last Sunday I trust but I I believe that God wants us to be Overcomers amen amen the promise to making a Rapture is overcoming all things and and the enemy is not out here it's no I like this person a little bit more than I like that one or I get along with this one more than that one you know that is just nonsense thinking what we need is to love everyone amen and we need to hate ourselves amen I'm talking about that car own nature right I that's what I'm talking about that that that man that gets in the way and says I don't have to do the will of God yeah when our mind start to engage in a battle and the devil tells us that we don't have to follow through with everything the Bible said or everything the message said when the devil tries to exalt my reasoning above the word of God you know what I'm going to bring every thought into captivity amen I'm going to say this does not pass the word test amen because what the devil's trying to do is stir up a problem in my life he's trying to Calla something and if I listen to him and I start to just compromise with the Bible over here or compromise with the Bible over here compromise my prayer life if you begin to compromise you're just you're you're you're standing in a mindfield anything's going to happen amen so we need to take a stand against the devil we need to lift up our head above where the enemy wants us to be bring those thoughts into captivity bring them down call them mouth this is not the truth these thoughts are theil you know we're so afraid to call out the devil in our own mind I don't understand that as if we're so perfect and we don't get thoughts from the devil or something true but we have no problem calling out the devil out here right all over here look the devil's the devil here as well as anywhere the difference you know here's the thing you don't go out and murder anybody right because you wouldn't let the even and the devil has probably told us all that he's told us so many things that we have not done right we know that's the devil but he tells us things that we do do that's right and that's what this is for this this service today is to help us not listen to recognize it's the devil and to get our head above that type of thinking amen David said I will I lift my head above my enemy I'm not going to stay down here with the chickens not going to stay down here God has called me to be an eagle to Fly Above these things I'm a Believer in the word of God Amen I'm going to tell the devil it is written I have decided to live by every word of God Amen that's a choice we must make that's back up by faith in other words we're not just saying it because the devil knows whether you mean it or not amen we got to trust that God's really going to supply our need right now right now brother bam said in the message seeking after Jesus he's speaking under the discernment here he says you're suffering with a nervous break isn't that right lady laying there in the cot isn't that true true a nervous break he says Don't Let The Devil defeat you if you have faith tonight you can go home and be well in the message the resurrection brother Brandon says do you know the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere anytime night or day any place the written word amen God's going to back up his word don't you believe that Amen in the message expectation now and now you remember that you don't have to wait for an Evangelistic service or a person coming through the prayer a person coming through praying for the sick he says you have a right to it yourself amen remember gifts and callings are wonderful but remember here is the greatest thing that God gave the world outside of Jesus Christ is the Bible am do you know what the word of God will defeat the Devil any place anywhere anytime on his own ground did you know that the word of God Alone Jesus made it so simple until the weakest Christian could do it amen amen think about it now nobody in here is the weakest Christian on the on the planet so I don't care what your situation is if you just simply do what the prophet said if you just do what the word says stop listening to the devil amen if you don't take a stand for him somebody else ain't going to get inside of you and take a stand you've got to do it you're the only one that can help your mind I'm the only one that can help my mind you can sit here and encourage me all day long but I still got to leave these doors and go out there and make my own decisions when thoughts come to me in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother BR says and let me say this now that the word of God will defeat the Devil anywhere any time or any place he will defeat the Devil and the right mental attitude this is in your mind now towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass amen amen if you can look at it the way that God wrote it and accept it in your heart God will make the word become life amen now that's a reality that's reality that's when the word becomes real to you yes and look I know we all want to see great things happen but I'll be honest with you I just want to see me please the Lord right hereen first amen first first first we must learn to defeat the Devil in our own minds were the greatest battles ever fought I wouldn't be worrying about the battle of Armageddon I'd be paying more attention to the Battle of doubts that rage in our own mind amen Ephesians chapter 6 ver 10 very Frome your scripture we all know this but I think it'd be encouraging to us to read it finally my brethren be strong strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil amen he's certainly wild isn't he amen for we don't wrestle against one another right but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places you know the people are going around the world they're getting up many of them even go to church and don't even recognize the devil amen they just they they just said oh that that that person didn't shake my hand that that person went through the door before I did that person took my seat at church where for take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and and having done all to stand stand therefore amen having your loins G about with truth and having the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of Faith where wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked yes am amen see he's coming at us we're in a battle the greatest battle ever fought and we need the shoeld of faith and we need the helmet of salvation amen and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God we need to we unfortunately we have to call the devil out amen the devil can't take us he can't do anything unless God allows it God has allowed the devil to talk to mankind that means we must learn our enemy learn when he's trying to bring confusion learn when he's trying to get us away from doing God's Will and call him out and say it is written I'm staying with the word amen Satan comes by and he starts to question our identity like we're not really saved like we're not really a Christian Christian we need to lift our heads above the enemy that's around about us with all these thoughts and tell them it's written I'm a Son of God I'm a child of the king I'm covered by the blood amen I belong to him in fact the Bible tells me I'm a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people I've been washed by the blood amen I'm going to lift my head up and look beyond my problems the scripture tells us and now shall my my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me amen therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing and I will praise sing praises unto the Lord right our feet are in Solid Ground here this is God's house you know God had to kick Satan out of heaven right sometimes we got to kick him out of our house that's right amen all brother brother bman I hope it's okay just sharing this number of times he's made a mention of a little testimony when he'd go into a restaurant and they would be using foul language and carrying on in a wrong way and and the god inside of uh him would rise up and say I don't have to listen to this yeah and just rebuke that spirit and then his testimony was and then I notice they never said another word or one time they said at one time and that was it see God honors faith amen and there's a reality Satan will try to get to us any way he can now we can spend our time looking at all the problems that are happening in the world or we can just lift up our heads above that am Jesus said when these things begin to come to pass all the problems that are happening in the world when these things begin to come to pass what things as it was in the days of Sodom gomorra so shall it be in the second coming of the Lord right as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man Romans 1:27 men men leaving the natural use of a woman amen burned in their lust one toward another men with men were working that which is unseemingly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their air which was meat amen that's right I'll tell you when I first got saved I I'll tell you I've been serving the lord a long time and I never ever ever ever ever ever heard about transgenders it's a wonder what's going to happen the next 10 years from now if God would carry amen second Peter 3:3 knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own desires all their own lust and having the attitude saying where is the promise of God's coming Amen brother for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation amen but what an attitude not being able to see the hour that they're living in the bible promises this bible promises that in this day that we're living that there's going to be a great Falling Away righten second Timothy 3:1 says know this that in the last days perilous time shall come churchgoers shall be lovers of their own self Covetous bolsters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unth thankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers just get upset at somebody that's doing good traitors hey highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God Amen this is the things that are happening in the world amen amen what things these things Jesus said in Luke 21: 26 men's Hearts failing them for fear wow here God has not given us the spirit of fear but men's hearts are failing for fear amen and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken I'll tell you I don't think the problem I believe if the people on this planet would stop looking at all the bad things that are going on I don't think they would be their hearts would be failing so much for fear if they would just simply go to church and read their Bible instead every time they get a bad thought have to go to church read your Bible that would straighten things up around here verse 35 as a snare anxiety right is going to come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth verse 28 and when these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your heads for your Redemption draw nigh we've got to lift up our heads above these things amen don't look at the problems of the world the problems in the church the make Believers look up lift up your head above your enemy that's trying to make you look at those things our Redemption is closer than what we realize look up and beyond our problems Jesus is the answer the Bible says that my God shall supply all of your need that's all of your need not by your ability not by your bank account not by your talent not by your popularity it's through Jesus Christ that every need is met in our lives amen amen I will lift up my head beyond my problems now shall my head be lifted up above my enemy round about me the thoughts that are circulating round in my mind that happen so often that devil gets in there he looks for a little crack and he gets in there the thoughts that are trying to bring me down or discourage me or depress me or thoughts that are are trying to build an anxiety or or get me to be too busy or I I I I just don't got time to wait on the Lord I got too much going on to serve other people I am telling you that's nothing but the devil you got to recognize it amen it's time to turn things around for in the time of trouble shall he hide me in his pilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock this word is the rock he's pointing us to the word of God Psalms 912 says now I will say of the Lord he is my refuge he is my Fortress in him will I trust I can't overcome the thoughts in my mind I can't in that's right amen when he comes in like a flood the Bible says that God will raise up a standard amen I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me amen because he set me upon a revelation I don't have to listen the devil's allowed to go out there and do his stuff but he's not allowed in here I got power I got control if you can control your mind you got a good chance you can help somebody amen but if you can't control your own mind how are you going to help somebody we can resist the devil in our mind the Bible says resist the devil and he'll flee amen I can do this because there's somebody inside of me that's greater than he that's in the world do you believe that amen amen the Devil he's always trying to break us down 1 John chapter 4 this the be first three verses we went over this but there's a there's Spirits out there that are trying to get us to compromise right trying to to to to to show that the days of Miracles are passed that that God doesn't really heal that God doesn't really perform Miracles anymore that God uh cannot deliver that that you if you got a vice it's there with you forever I mean there are many many spirits out there that refuse to be manifested in the flesh and verse four says that you are of God little children and have overcome them them Spirits right because that's what we're talking about beloved believe not every spirit and youve overcome them how because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen that's how you overcome the devil in your mind right there Amen to whom you yield yourself servant to obey his servant you are amen amen right verse five they are of the world and they speak of the world and you know what the World Hears them but we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error that's right I'm so glad that we have the Bible I cannot imagine being in the world where you got people all around the globe saying God told me to tell you this and they all contradict one another that's what really got me when I was going to a denominational Church by the grace of God there was just something dealing with me inside that I was lost no matter if I was going to church or not amen and I would hear this about this church I I go to this church and I hear about that church and they're all claiming they got the truth but there can only be one truth amen only one truth and something inside spoke as clear as could be I am not in the church I am in my word amen and from that moment this became my amen I attached my soul to this and not a church amen and it's never changed I haven't changed it since that time I'm so glad that we have God's word amen amen it wasn't written by just men Bible says holy men of old were moved on by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost wrote the word amen that's why we can have confidence when we read it it is God speaking to us amen amen amen Psalms 21121 I hope to get through this quickly but you know how that goes I try to outsmart myself what do I mean by that you know the Bible says study to show thyself approved well the more I study the more notes I get the more time I put into it the more pages I get am so I try to like fake myself out work on other things Psalms 121:1 I will lift up my eyes to the hills amen from whence cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord am which made Heaven and Earth I will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not Slumber that's right behold that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep that is right we know one thing we can ignore we can forget what's going on in Israel we can doubt what's going on but I'll tell you what God's got his eye on Israel amen amen The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shade upon thy right hand the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the Moon by Night the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil look at that promise he shall preserve thy Soul the Lord shall preserve thy going out thy coming in from this time forth and even forever more amen praise the Lord amen God be with us who could be against us we got to remember that no matter what thoughts are going on in here there's a God that's greater amen amen not mind over matter not you know my mind no God is with me I'm trusting you Lord I'm not listening to that amen sometimes that's hard the thought comes you know what if you just start singing a song Start quoting the scripture get your mind on doing something for somebody before you know it but you get lifted up above those things because there's a reality when you put God first in your life 1 Timothy chapter 6 if you want to turn with me there's a big trick that Satan gets a lot of Believers in is to go after other things to get your life involved in other things do you believe that I mean we we need to be making time for God but we're just I the more gadgets we get more microwaves phones everything more we get the more it seems like we're we're we're busier now we're busier now I used to be less busy when I when I first came to the Lord I was less busy right I love that life right and back then I can imagine I can imagine in the 70s watching a John Wayne movie and saying man can you imagine back then not having any phones just on a horse just going along the devil wants to get us busy First Timothy chapter 6 verse 6 but godliness with contentment is great gain yes great gain amen for we brought nothing into this world and cly we can carry nothing out and having food and Remnant that's right let us be there withth content but they that will be rich not necessarily just just money but going after something right just money buys you anything but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare into many foolish and hurtful desires which they actually drown men spiritually now into destruction and predition you talk about your mind being a landmine a dangerous L landine For the Love of Money is the root of all evil you've all seen shows before where they steal the money they get this money they look at one another we could retire we could change our life right right nobody will know we'll split it just by their eyes looking at it true the devil has a way of coming into our mind and getting us to go after things when the word says be content amen be content for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have aired from the most important thing the faith and Pierce themselves through with many Sorrows amen but thou oh man of God flee these things right now if I told you there was a fire in here get out of here flee you wouldn't be sin H are you sure brother John I I want to consider being rich for a moment things would my life would be easier blee these things and follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience meekness fight the good flight of Faith lay hold of eternal life amen where unto where unto Thou Art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses God is trying to lay his word into our hearts this morning now Satan is trying to get us to doubt it amen so we need to keep fighting we need to to lay hold of each brother John already have eternal life if I understand what Jesus meant he said my words are spirit and they are life amen amen and to me I don't have all his word amen because I the only way I can get all his word is to have it revealed to me by God himself amen so I want to lay hold of more word for my life his words are spirit and they are truth that was my last scripture but I want to read a quote if I could from the greatest battle ever fall brother bam says it must be accepted in the mind speaking of the word now the word that we hear the word we heard this morning it must be accepted in our mind then it is believed with our heart then the word of God becomes a reality then every sense of the soul in the body is just scoured out with the Holy Spirit then you your sense of God and your consciousness of God and everything that's Godly it just flows through you right there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing that can rise up but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it that's it friends now he says God let none of them miss it see it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door right yeah and listens to your conscience and listens to your memory and listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to those things and let God the Holy Spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of that stuff out amen every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and S Satan can't battle against it am knows sir he cannot battle against it now we know that's the truth amen these battles have raged since the day of the Garden of Eden that battle in the human mind Satan started it yes what did he do uh what did he do when he met Eve yes he didn't deny God's word he just whitewashed it amen he got her to just a little bit consider we don't want that we want to cast down all reasoning amen let's Stand Together amen praise the lord we want to lift up our heads above our problems you've heard the story of mind is a terrible thing to waste an idle mind is a Devil's Playground we need to use our mind to win the greatest battle that was ever fall engage in the the reality that I'm going to be a manifested son or daughter of God that I am going to bring forth more of Christ in my life this week this month this year than I did last that it's a reality that if nobody in this church has that mind made up my mind's made up if nobody in my family has that in their mind I've made my mind up because when it comes to us God deals with us as individuals two will be in the bed one will be taken two will be grinding two will be working one will be one will be taken and one will be left we can't change the world but we can change our lives amen God's with us to help us through it let this word stay in your heart meditate upon it pray about it just ask the Lord Jesus Keep unfolding it through the week and amen and and try to put little things into practice right take take take the real little things when when some you don't put the salt shaker where it's got to go you know what I'm trying to say that it's it's amazing you know this is the truth it's amazing how simple and small a problem is that the devil can actually get into and make it such a wide problem true he doesn't ever come in like this yeah you but he starts with those little things that you know pushes your button amen let's let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer your desire is to to see this word manifested and you just keep it before the Lord as we go to him in prayer our heavenly father we thank you for your word this morning Lord not that you like we said in our first prayer that you preserved it that we could read it but Lord that you could open it to us that it could benefit our lives today and Lord I pray as brother Brandon made mention may you always remember this he said may this stick with you may you not forget Lord my humble prayer is that you would bring these things that we heard this morning to our remembrance down the road you spoke when the spirit of truth will come he will lead and guide you in all truth he will bring all things to your remance bring your word to our remembrance Lord when the enemy begins to engage in our minds trying to get us off track Lord may you help us not only to recognize the enemy but help us to fight that good fight of faith I pray that you'd bless each and everyone here Lord with that right mental attitude amen with a sound mind amen Lord we're living in a day as you know that the world has never been as crazy as it is today and Lord we need a sound mind we need your spirit to give us power love and a sound mind Amen Let bless your people bless the Sheep of your pasture bless each one here Lord father let us walk out of these doors this morning fortified we know not what tomorrow holds we know not the things that the enemy is going to throw at us but Lord if we're walking with you we can we can you're walking with us Lord we can go through anything because you promised to lead us through hold our hands Lord as Brother Bruce May mention at the beginning Lord you don't you don't let us go amen you promis never to leave us never to forsake us we praise you and we thank you for it Lord we commit oursel to you bless us we worship you now for we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen am amen amen I Think Jesus is alive haven't seen that one in a while Jesus is alive Jesus is aive sin and death must go they are conquered for for Jesus is alive Jesus is alive Jesus is Alive sin and death must go they are conquered for
