And let's just uh remember brother Roger's dad, Bob, with uh stage four cancer. Amen. And we just pray that uh the Lord would just meet him wherever he is. that he will not only just heal his body but heal his soul and whatever need there would be. Amen. Or as our brother Orlando said with this church uh shooting last week, we don't know. We need to be God with right with God now, &gt;&gt; not wait till tomorrow. &gt;&gt; We definitely don't have a promise of it. Let's just remember our our sister Elizabeth Murphy. Amen. With the with how she's dealing with it and the cancer and just faith to keep going. Amen. And that God would just uh help her along the journey. Amen. Also, our sister Linda Helms. Don't know she went in the hospital, but I don't haven't heard anything that's going on there. So, let's just keep her lifted up in our prayers. Amen. all those that would be live streaming. Amen. Whether they can get here or not, um we know that uh the Lord can meet them wherever they are. &gt;&gt; And let's just remember all the saints that are here that are not here. and uh spend some time in prayer for for all for everybody for our children for those that we know that aren't saved and for even those that are saved and just need a deeper deeper walk with Christ for we all need strength in this hour. Also, uh we're so thankful once again to see our sister Donna. We just pray God's peace be with her. Let's just lift up our brother Marty. I think he's got an appointment to get his hip replaced at the end of the month. So, we just pray that uh wisdom for the doctors. Amen. For that. And also for me, I'm going to see a n knee uh doctor tomorrow to see if I can figure out what's going on with my limbs. Um all these bodies will pass away, right? So, as many doctors as we can see, and we're still subject to the to the flesh. Amen. But we have a heavenly father that loves us and we're looking forward to seeing one day. Amen. If we get to the faith, let's remember all the missionaries. Amen. All their efforts. If uh we feel that somebody's coming against us, I I truly believe they're coming against them more. So, let's just remember them. my prayer. Let's lift them up. Let's lift up all the souls that's coming in. Amen. And just pray for more as the hour approaches. Amen. So, let's just stand. Let's remember our brother uh John as as the word would come that uh we would get a uh a revelation that it's not our brother John, but the spirit that lives with him, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh preparing us for his coming. Let's go on one accord. Dear heavenly father, Lord, as we come before you tonight, this morning, Lord God, we pray, Lord, that our hearts are tender, Lord, that through that Lord, we have good ground. And as that word would come, Lord, that it would just take hold, Lord. It would not be a fleeting word, Lord, or just be robbed up by some some uh crows, Lord, that would pick it away, Lord, as we leave, but it would just stay with us, Lord, through the week, Lord, and that we could just grow closer and closer to you, Lord. We pray that your spirit Lord would just work upon each and every one of us. Whatever need there would be here Lord this morning Lord we know that you are more than capable of meeting each one of those needs. Lord Lord we just have to have faith and to believe that Lord you are capable of doing what you said you would do Lord God. And this morning, Lord, as we come to you, Lord, on one accord this morning, Lord, we just pray for each need that would be here, Lord, for every Lord, soul that would be uh Lord, live streaming this morning, Lord, that Lord, they could just believe as the as we're standing here, Lord God, that uh your arm is a mighty arm, Lord, that it can reach through no matter where it is, Lord, and and touch a person. Lord, we love you, Lord. We praise you, Lord. and we just lift you up in the precious name of Jesus Christ this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Jonathan, can you just lead us with tithes? Amen. You may be seated. Amen. Let's just sing uh springs of living water. Amen. I thirsted for the barren lands of sin and shame and nothing satisfies me there I found. But to the blessed cross of Christ one day I came when living waters tended there abound. [Music] Drinking at the springs of living water. Oh, happy now am I. My my soul they satisfy. Drinking at the springs of living water. Oh wonderful and bountiful supply. How sweet the living waters from the hills of God. It makes me glad and happy all the way. Now glory, grace, and blessed marked the path I tried. I'm shouting hallelujah every day. Oh, drinking at the springs of living water. [Music] Happy now am I. My soul they satisfy drinking at the springs of living water. A wonderful and bountiful supply. Oh sinner, won't you come today to Calary? A fountain there is flowing deep in wine. The Savior now invites you to the water free where thirsting spirits can be satisfied. Amen. Oh, drinking at the springs of living water. Happy now and my soul they satisfy. Drinking at the springs of living water. Oh, wonderful and bountiful supply. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He can lead you, but you got to drink. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the battle's over. Amen. I am a soldier of the cross, a foul of the lamb. And share I fear to own his cause or blush to speak his name. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown in the new Jerusalem. Oh, wear a crown. Wear a crown. wear a bright and morning crown. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown in the new Jerusalem. Must I be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease? While others fight to win the prize and sail the bloody seas. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown in the new Jerusalem. I'll wear a crown. Hallelujah. Wear a crown. Wear a bright and shining crown. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown in the new Jerusalem. Are there no foes for me to face? Must I not stem the flood? Is this our world a friend to grace to help me unto God? And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown in the new Jerusalem. Oh, wear a crown. Wear a crown. Wear a bright and shining crown. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown in the new Jerusalem. Sure, I must fight if I would reign. Increase my courage, Lord. I'll bear the toil, endure the pain, support it by thy word. And when the battle is over, we shall wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown. In the new Jerusalem, oh, wear a crown. Wear a crown. Wear a bright and shining crown. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown in that new Jerusalem. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's a promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand as we get ready to change order of service and let's just sing open our eyes. Amen. Open our eyes, Lord. We want to see Jesus to reach out and touch him to say that we love him. Open our ears, Lord. and help us to listen. Open our eyes, Lord. We want to see Jesus. Open our eyes, Lord. We want to see Jesus to reach out and touch him to say that we love him. Open our ears, Lord, and help us to listen. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; unless he does, &gt;&gt; we can't see. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He did say, "Blessed are your eyes." &gt;&gt; Blessed are your ears. So, we are blessed people. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; If I knew she was going to be here, I would have preached a different message. I knew you were preach. I knew you'd be here. This message is for you. &gt;&gt; God's word is for all of us. We can receive from him exactly what he has for us through his word. I've experienced so many times hearing something that didn't have anything to do with what God was speaking to. &gt;&gt; But he used the scripture, used what was spoken, but he spoke to me about something different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he just he used that to bring forth the revelation. And we serve a God that's supernatural. &gt;&gt; His ways are beyond our ways. &gt;&gt; That's right. We could sit down with our children and try to talk to them and reason with them. They know the language and A and B and C and one and two and three. And but when God speaks to us, it's like, well, where did that come from? &gt;&gt; But it makes perfect sense when he speaks to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's good to be in the house of God. So good to have Donna back. And I know it's going to be real hard, but um I just say um I and I say this really to everybody. Um no, no matter what you're going through and enter into the praise and worship of the word &gt;&gt; because in that is where our comfort comes &gt;&gt; and our strength is through the word. Of course, it's the enemy's job to get our focus on on the wrong things on on the things that hurt us, right? They hurt us. He wants to capitalize. Imagine if somebody um okay, somebody hits you on the side of the face with the first, you know, what are you doing? That's not right. And then you you get stung and it you know, you you know, I'm not going to shake your hand no more. I'm going to hit you back. Something's going to be going on in the natural realm like that. But in in God's realm, you get hit in the face, you turn the cheek, &gt;&gt; you look to the, you know, the good side of a situation. And um I believe the word has strength for us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you would to the book of uh Ecclesiastes chapter 3 for a very familiar uh scripture. Amen. How many believes God's going to bless you today? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's through faith. It's through the faith in God all things are possible. Amen. Ecclesiastes chapter 3. Maybe before we begin reading there. We're just going to look to the Lord in prayer. Our dear heavenly father, we thank you that you've given us strength and health to be here today. And we thank you that you've placed a desire in our heart to want to be here. a love, a longing, &gt;&gt; a desire to be more like you and and to get ready for your soon coming. And Father, we invite your presence in this part of the service, Lord. Uh may we continue to worship you by worshiping your word. For we know that you are your word and we love you, Lord. We love your word. We pray Lord that your anointing would rest upon each each of us today Lord not only the the the hearer of the word but Lord the speaker unless you come and minister Lord there's no words that I could give that could be of any benefit to your bride. But only you can feed your bride. And so we're looking to you in the spirit Lord to minister to us. And Lord, we pray that you would accomplish the very purpose in which you've uh set aside this service today. Pray that you'd be with all those that are missing today. Lord, we ask that your Holy Spirit would supply every need. Bless our our sister Linda Helms. Lord, whatever condition, every situation, pray that you remember those that are battling cancer. Remember Brother Bill Bailey and Sister Elizabeth Murphy. Lord, we just ask that you remember all those that need you, Lord. for your God that is is able Lord to to meet and exceed all the needs that we could possibly have. We thank you ask your blessings now on this service and the remainder of this service now in Jesus precious name we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ecclesiastes chapter 3 starting with verse number one. to everything. There is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven. A time to be born, a time to die. A time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted. A time to kill and a time to heal. A time to break down and a time to build up. A time to weep and a time to laugh. A time to mourn and a time to dance. A time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together. A time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing. Time to get, a time to loose, a time to keep, and a time to cast away. A time to rent, and a time to sow, a time to keep silence, and a time to speak. A time to love and a time to hate. A time of war and a time of peace. Just drop down to the first part of verse 11. He have made everything beautiful in his time. &gt;&gt; God bless you. May be seated. We want to talk about walking in his purpose. Walking in God's purpose. We see here in the scriptures that uh Solomon used the word time 24 times. 24 different times he uses a a space of time for things. Time is limited. Time is one thing that you cannot get back. You can't reuse. You can't redo it. We could say that time stinks because it has an end of all good things. But we all soul could say that time is a lifesaver when you're going through what we would call hell on earth &gt;&gt; and you want it over with. You want the pain done and you want to move on. &gt;&gt; We're glad that it's over. We've heard the saying this too will pass. &gt;&gt; Something to always bear in mind when you're suffering. Time is limited. One thing for sure is that time is limited. Time is for a season and to everything there is a time. Brother Brandham said time is an allotted space. &gt;&gt; In other words, time is just allotted a space in eternity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we got a couple quotes on that that we want to talk about. But we've heard the saying only what's done for Christ will last. &gt;&gt; And then it's kind of been maybe perfected um that only what's done for Christ and by Christ will last. So everything that's um that we we do down here on earth, anything that has a beginning has an end. In other words, um it's it's not going to matter in eternity. It ju it just doesn't matter in eternity. Now, here's what is to me the such a beautiful thing this morning. That down here in the temporal life that we live in, that we can tap into eternity and literally perform eternal things that will matter on the other side. Amen. &gt;&gt; That we're literally tapping into heaven down here &gt;&gt; and be able to be part of eternity down here. &gt;&gt; It's not just everything's temporal. We wait to get to heaven to find out, you know, what's going on. No, we can be in tune down here because God is down here with an eternal purpose. Ephesians 3 talks to us about an eternal purpose. Revelations 10 verse 5 says, "And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven. And he swear by him that liveth forever and ever, who created heavens, and the things that are there are that therein are, and the earth, and the things that uh there are uh therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer. no longer an end of time, but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin the sound, the mystery of God should be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets. So, we do not have to look any further than this message to know what's going on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This message has everything that we need to make a rapture. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for another messenger. We're not looking for another message. What we're looking for is that this message that God sent be revealed to us, be manifested inside of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said like this. He says, "We come out of eternity and we step into a little space of time here and step out of time back into eternity." &gt;&gt; That's where we could say we we never had a beginning. We were with God in his thoughts before there was ever a foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; So everything is moving towards the end of time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everything's moving towards the end of an allotted space or the end of what I want to share with us today is an opportunity, an opportunity to fulfill our purpose. There's only a lot of space of time to make ourselves ready. And the Bible tells us that the righteous scarcely make it. So they scarcely make it with the allotted time they have &gt;&gt; to get ready. They don't have an abundance of time and they're just going to take part of their time and get ready and they can spend the rest of time doing whatever they want. It just it just doesn't work like that. And uh Revelations 19:7 says, "Let us be glad, rejoice, and give honor for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready." So she took advantage of the time that she had on earth and actually got ready for the rapture. You know, there are a lot of people who are going to come at that day at the end and and say, "Why didn't we go? Why weren't we in the rapture? Why? Why? I thought and look, I got this and this and this and this just like the rich young ruler could prove that he had some sort of relationship with God. But it is to me, you know, Brother Brandham talks about that boy who's whistling in the graveyard, just whistling, but he's scared. And to me to go ahead and and and be um so um uh whistling when you don't have the fear of God. I I I think the righteous scarcely make it. That means uh we should serve God with reverence. &gt;&gt; Right? Because that's what the Bible teaches. Our God is a consuming fire and and and what he would ask us for us to do, we should be careful to make sure that we do it. So Jesus said in Matthew 24:44, "Therefore, be ye also ready, for in such an hour as you think not the Son of Man cometh." So he's not going to be coming 15 times. Okay, you're not ready. I'll come back. Like at our at our shop, we have our heat treat guys come. They pick up jobs on a regular basis. And sometimes he he comes and say, "We're not ready. Get us on the way back." But with God, there's one coming. That's right. &gt;&gt; There's no oops, I I'm going to I should have tried. &gt;&gt; This is the time that we need to care about what the word says we should care about. &gt;&gt; Now, a space of time was a allotted and only the bride, catches this, only the bride seizes the opportunity to make herself ready. And and she does. She does. Remember, there were 10 virgins. Five were wise, five were foolish. Five seized the opportunity to get more oil in their lamps. In other words, they they came to church and it was more, more, more, more of you, Lord. More. I need more. I want more. And they weren't they weren't thinking intellectually they have enough. Their attitude was I need more. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it was that group of people that kept pressing in, that kept wanting to know God in a deeper way. They kept wanting to become more and more in his image from glory on to glory, from service onto service. And it was that group that was ready to meet the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the others, they were inspired, but they were inspired by a proud spirit of I have enough to make a rapture right now. I have enough right now. In fact, I'm in need of nothing. That's how Jesus proposes it. They felt no need to really press in anymore for me. I've done enough pressing. So just coming to church and living pretty clean lives was really all that they felt they really needed to do. They they didn't need to seize the opportunity that was given to them. And when they realized that they didn't have enough oil, right, it was at one point at the end that they realized that they didn't have enough oil as the rapture was beginning to take place. The bridegroom came out and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut. The time that was allotted for them was now gone. the door of their opportunity was shut. Can you say amen this morning? &gt;&gt; So opportunity is all around us. We live in a land of opportunity. We've heard about that in America. We all have an opportunity to grow, to succeed, to make things better, and and to get ready. Thomas Edison, I've quoted this many times, said, "Opportunity is all around us. It's It's missed by most people because it's dressed in overhauls. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it looks like work. Like, whoa. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh uh. Would you do something for me? I don't know. What is it first? Tell me. &gt;&gt; You know, to to to someone who wants to serve, it's an opportunity. But to most people, it's tell me first and I'll let you know. Most people fail to recognize opportunities because they don't appear to be real easy or glamorous or up uplifting. They require hard work, perseverance, and dedication to succeed. And the idea that you you have to be willing to put effort uh into things is it doesn't appear to be opportunities for people. People are always looking for a quick a quick a quick one, right? Let's do the ladle the lottery. That's that's a good example. I mean, if I could just get this become rich, you know, it it's just it's the thinking is different. But I I'm saying that when you're not when you're not worried about pulling up your sleeves, you're not worried about working hard, you're not worried about giving more of your heart, you're not worried about spending more time in prayer, you're not you're not worried about working hard. That is when God can bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you just you take the story that brother Brandham gave in in the choosing of a bride where that uh all the all the ladies were going out to meet this rich rancher when he was going to come by and they were going to choose him and they were all just thinking that they were going to be the one that would be chosen. And and this girl uh this one girl she just she didn't have that type of attitude of um I'm look look at me I'm I'm I'm the best. &gt;&gt; Right? She she had a humble attitude and uh she just uh kept busy working in the background. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that was the one that was chosen. &gt;&gt; And you think that you know God is God um you know everybody wants to sit on the right hand left hand of Jesus, right? And and Jesus is it's not for me to give it. It's but of my father. He says, but I I I think you know God he his bride his bride works labors &gt;&gt; in the opportunity that's given and we all have an opportunity here today to become more in his image &gt;&gt; and we're called to be in his image. It's an opportunity. It it it's a matter of of of becoming one with the word and and marrying the word and um bring having that word bring forth life inside of us. So it may require hard work, the hard work of faithfulness uh to to pray, to read your Bible, to listen to the tapes, to to come to church, to teach your family how to love God. But it will pay off in the long run. &gt;&gt; It will dress you and get you ready for a rapture. I like how God told Joshua, "This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth." In other words, everything you talk about, have it associated with the word of God. But thou shalt meditate therein, day and night, and that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein. For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. Don't you think God holds the key to our lives? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like God is not going to you if you let if you just speak the word all the time. Word, word, word, word, word, word. I love the word. And you meditated upon it day and night. Do you think God is going to hold back success from you? &gt;&gt; No. The Bible says he would not withhold any good thing from them that walk uprightly. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's his promise. &gt;&gt; And the thing is, we we're trying to do as least as possible and get the blessings of God. &gt;&gt; I I mean, how would you like to have a relationship with somebody? They want to do the very least and get the blessings. No, you don't want that. That that's that's that's not right. Do you know that people miss opportunities because they're not aware of what's going on around them? &gt;&gt; We got a scripture for that. Hebrews 13:2 says, "Be not forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares." So we need to be careful. I don't want to forget. It might be somebody God sent by for us. Paul, like all of us, before we meet God, he was walking around in his own purpose. And I just want to pick up a little bit here in Acts 26:15. And I believe that at this point that Paul is relaying to King Agria his testimony, his conversion. And he's speaking here and he says um and I said who art thou Lord and he said I I am Jesus whom thou persecutest but arise and stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness of those things which thou has seen and those things which in which I will appear unto thee. delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles on unto whom I now send thee. I'm going to deliver you from them to open their eyes to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they might receive forgiveness of sins and the inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. There's so much that could be said about this, but here was a man, his name was Saul, and he was going about serving God the way he wanted to, but he was not in the purpose of God, but he thought he was. But it wasn't until he met God, he had a real close encounter with God that God was able to show him this is the proper way. &gt;&gt; This is this is this is my purpose for your life. Literally, I can't give you your purpose for your life and nobody can. It can only come from God. But it should behoove us to put effort, energy, time, Lord, show me your purpose for my life. &gt;&gt; Because if we don't, we're going to waste our life. &gt;&gt; And then when we get on the other side, what are we going to have? &gt;&gt; We can't go back and say, "Look what I did on earth." I mean, the earth's going to pass away. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The former things are going to be passed away. there's not going to be any bringing up of, you know, how many jobs we shipped out of trusted tool. It's just not going to be there. And so, we need to be uh storing up treasures in heaven. Jesus said &gt;&gt; where where rust doesn't uh corrupt and and and and be be careful to consider our eternal purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it's amazing to me that, you know, so God calls Paul to be a prophet and he sends him to the Gentiles and he says, "I'm going to send you there, but I have to deliver you." Now, if I was God, this is what I would do. All right, my predestinated seed, I'm going to send a little message to your mind through a thought. when you get it, come on over to my church and we'll just have a service here. That would be so much better because see, there'd be no persecution. Paul wouldn't have to be persecuted. But God's way is I'm going to give the word out to everybody. &gt;&gt; And when you give the word to everybody, you get persecuted. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's God's way. It's not our way, but it's his way. Now, so turn with me to Luke 19. Jerusalem missed their opportunity to receive God's grace. Just I just want to go through some examples here. Luke 19:41. And when he was come near, he beheld the city and he wept over it. And this is what he said about Jerusalem. If thou hast known even thou at least at least in this thy day the things which they belong unto thy peace. You've ever wanted peace before. God has a peace that belongs to you. I believe that with all my heart. But now they are hid from thine eyes. For the day shall come upon thee, that thine enemy shall cast a trench round about thee, and capest thee round, and keep thee in every on every side, and shall lay thee even within the ground, and thy children within thee. And they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another, all because thou kneest not the time of thy visitation. If thou has known the things that really belong to you, then you you would have received them. But because you weren't really paying attention when you came to church, you missed your time of visitation. So there was a time that Jerusalem, the door was shut on Jerusalem and the door opened up to the Gentiles. I want to pick that up in Acts Acts 13:46 here. Acts 13:46. Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said, "It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you, but seeing speaking to the Jews, but seeing that ye put it off from you, and judged yourself unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. For so have the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and they glorified what? The word of the Lord. They just didn't say, "I glorify God." They glorified the word. The word is what God is. We need to be born by the word. The word is if we want to know God, know the word. &gt;&gt; Receive the word. When you receive the word, you automatically receive the Holy Ghost. When you receive the living word, not not just an intellectual word, right? That that just puffs you up. But the Holy Ghost is will bring the manifestation of God to your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. So they glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life, they believed. It's real simple. When you believe, that's evidence you got eternal life. It's that simple. It's the fact that you believe, but when you're you're you're you're you're not taking that word seriously and you're just maybe intellectually believing certain parts of it or you wanted to pick and choose what you're going to believe. You know, that that is such scary ground. That's all I can tell you because that there's no scripture for that. As many as were ordained to eternal life believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're seed, you're going to believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just love the word today. &gt;&gt; The door to the Jews was shut and the door to the Gentiles was opened. &gt;&gt; The Jews missed their time of visitation. They just they did they weren't paying attention. You know, the the worst thing to do is come to church and not pay attention. &gt;&gt; You know, I say, you know, the because I believe that God has ordained he's ordained a five-fold ministry to get us perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um the way that brother Bronham taught it in church order that everybody ought to have a home church, everybody ought to have a pastor, everybody ought to be under a local body and &gt;&gt; and to be able to function together as a family and learn how to work out problems and care about one another and pray for one another. &gt;&gt; It it it's it's like you would have a natural family. You wouldn't want, you know, your your your children not caring about the other children, right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, it it's it's no different in a spiritual family that there there needs to be a love one for another. That's why Jesus said, "Love one another. By this shall all men know you're my disciples." So, there was a time for the Jews and and now there's a a time for the the Gentiles. To everything, there's a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven. And God's purpose for this season was to take a bride out of the Gentiles &gt;&gt; for eternity. &gt;&gt; He couldn't take him out of the Jews. Taking them out of the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Now soon that door is going to be closed. &gt;&gt; The time for the Gentiles is going to be closed. &gt;&gt; And he's going back to the Jews &gt;&gt; to get a remnant. And so I I'm I'm just saying this because there's a time for you, James. There's a time for you, Joy. There's a time for you, brother Ron. There's a time for all of us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We only have an allotted time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you know, I don't know what that time is. &gt;&gt; By the grace of God, I'm living here. I can go I I can take we can all just take a bus down to the cemetery and I can show you many tombstones with ages younger than you. &gt;&gt; We have no promise of tomorrow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But God is here with a real voice who really wants to speak to our hearts and show us our purpose for his economy. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we got examples of many people in this Bible who missed their opportunities. Turn with me to Matthew chapter 19. Most people want to know to get to heaven. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But they don't want to pay the admission. &gt;&gt; They don't want to pay the mission. &gt;&gt; There is an admission. You know there is Most people got the understanding Jesus died for me on the cross. I got I accept it and I got eternal life. In other words, I I I I accept this and I got eternal life. And that's it. That intellectual belief has Satan has used to deceive a lot of people. So, Matthew 19:16, we see here we we know this this man is a rich young ruler. Behold, one came and said unto him,"Good Master, what shall I do that I may have eternal life?" And he said unto them, "Why callst thou me good? There is none good but one that is God. But but if but if thou wil enter into life, keep the commandments." That's a little bit more than accepting the blood. Right &gt;&gt; now you got to start doing something if you do believe in the blood. He saith unto him which and Jesus said thou shalt not thou shalt do no murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother. And this man said uh and and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. So he didn't even say all the commandments, right? I don't think that's all 10 of them. I didn't count them. Okay. So, I'm just that that makes a difference here. But the young man saith unto him, "All these things have I kept from my youth up." So, what am I lacking? I mean, I believe that Jesus died for me. What am I lacking? And Jesus said unto him, "If thou will be perfect, go and sell sell that thou has and give it to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come and follow me." But when the young man heard that saying, notice he was a young man, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. And Jesus said unto his disciples, verily I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. I just want to say that this man met Jesus. There was a visitation. There was an opportunity. There was a lot of time given to him. And all he had to say is yes, but he did not want to pay the admission fee. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he missed his time of visitation. Now, we know this. We know this because a prophet came on the scene. And let's pick it up in Luke chapter 16. This rich man missed his purpose on earth. He missed his personal visitation. You know, we all I say this for sure. Did you know every person gets visited by the truth in their life? &gt;&gt; Most of them do not recognize it, &gt;&gt; but it ain't God's fault. And and I you know talking about the beginning if I know you would have been here. Did did you know did you know that whether you're here or not here God's still preaching to you &gt;&gt; and you're still accountable to the word even though you're not here. &gt;&gt; A lot of people think like this. Well if I don't go I don't I don't have to worry about I don't have to pay tithe. I don't have to pay my offering. I don't have to worry about because I'm not there. That's not true. &gt;&gt; That's not true in God's economy. We have a position. We have a post of duty. We're to be here. And um because God has a family, it's not a part-time family. &gt;&gt; All right. Luke chapter 16 verse 19. There was a certain rich man was clothed in purple and fine linen. Did you understand? This is why I'm wearing purple today. Brother, do you know brother Ron and I match again today? This like the second service. Like that's I thought that's pretty neat. No, it just happens. You just you end up going to church and you find out who you match. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at the gate full of sores, and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, the dogs came, and he licked his sores. And it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. And um the the rich man also died and was buried. Now in hell, notice he's already identifying where he's at. In hell, he lifted up his eyes being in torments and saith to Abraham a far off so he could see into the other dimension at this point. Um and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, "Father Abraham, have mercy on me." and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am in torment in this flame. But Abraham said, "Son," now this is the part we want to get to. There was a a time of visitation. Abraham's calling him son. And he's he's in hell. Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivest good things and likewise la Lazarus evil things. But now he is comforted and thou art tormented. And besides all this between us and you there's a great gulf fixed. It's fixed. You can't change it. So that they which would pass from hence ye cannot come. Neither can they pass to us that would come from thence. And he said, I pray thee therefore father that thou would send him to my father's house. If this is the real truth and I I can't get any water, we can't get connected, we can't ever have fellowship again, then please go back and tell my brothers, tell my family so they don't come to this place of torment. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For I have five brethren that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. And Abraham saith unto him, they have Moses and the prophets. Let them hear them. And he said, "Nay, Father Abraham. Nay, nay, Father Abraham." They don't listen when they go to church. They They don't listen when they go to church. &gt;&gt; But if one went to them from the dead, they will repent. And he said unto them, "If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead." time of visitation. There's a time of visitation. It's not not just serious and sober, but it's it's really glorious. I I'd rather hold hands with Jesus than wonder, is he with me? Right now, it's not all up to Jesus. It's it's up to me to want Jesus to hold my hand. &gt;&gt; Now, here is a man who looked for his time of visitation and he took opportunity of it. It's in Luke chapter 19. If you want to turn with me, Luke chapter 19. He had a purpose to fulfill and he came uh to the conclusion that his life wasn't going to really amount to anything down here. It was just temporal and he wanted to be a part of eternity. And we can pick it up here. He felt he was created to serve the Lord. And Jesus entered in verse one of chapter 19 of Luke. And he passed through Jericho. And behold, there was a man named Zach Zakius, which was the chief among the publicans. And he was rich. And he sought to see Jesus who he was. And and he could not for the press, for he was of little statue. So he was a chief. He was rich, but he was little. And um so he ran before and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. And when Jesus came to that place, he looked up and saw him and said, "Zakius, make haste and come down, for today I must abide at thy house." What a privilege. What a privilege. What an what a privilege. And you know Jesus lives in every one of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and when we invite one another over, what you've done to the least of these, you've done unto me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus said. And he made haste and he came down and received him joyfully. And when he when they saw it, they all murmured. They all murmured and said that he has gone to be with a guest with a man that is a sinner. And Jesus knew he was a sinner. He knew I was a sinner. He knew you were a sinner. &gt;&gt; It didn't stop him from coming by and getting us. &gt;&gt; And Zakius stood and said unto the Lord, "Behold, Lord, the half of all my goods, I I give it to the poor, and if I've taken anything from any man by false acquisition, I restore him four-fold." And Jesus said unto him, "This day is salvation. Come to this house, for as much as he also is a son of Abraham, for the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost." So Zakius recognized his day of visitation, his time of visitation. He took advantage of that and didn't he didn't say,"Well, you know, Brother John, I'm going to take some time and I'm going to think about this. I'm going to think about it. You know, I'm going to just spend a little bit of time praying about it and thinking about it." Well, how many times we spend time thinking about it, praying about it, and we forgot it like a month ago. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a trick from the enemy. Today is the day to respond to God. &gt;&gt; Do not wait till tomorrow. That's right. &gt;&gt; You You've given the devil 24 more hours to work with you and give you reasons not to move forward with God, not to move, you know, giving you the the thought that you can you always got tomorrow. Like, get me that scripture and then I'll believe it. But it's not. Satan's always trying to get us off track. We have only a set time to do what God's called us to do in his eternal purpose. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to miss that. Another story here is in 2 Kings chapter 2. Elisha, he was a prophet and he wanted a double portion. You know how many how many knows what he wanted a double portion of? He wanted a double portion of what? the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He wanted a double portion of the Holy Ghost. He was a prophet and he wanted a double portion. &gt;&gt; And I don't understand it why, you know, we're content with how much spirit we have. &gt;&gt; He was a prophet. I want a double portion of what Elijah had. &gt;&gt; We have not because we ask not. &gt;&gt; I think I'd rather ask I'd rather ask in and come short &gt;&gt; then then not ask and and come way way way short. &gt;&gt; So we can pick it up here in 2 Kings chapter 2 verse 9 says and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha I I want to help you. I want to bless you before I leave. ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you what's missing today is a hunger. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For more of God. &gt;&gt; People are too satisfied with what they got. the but Jesus said blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled and he said you've asked a hard thing nevertheless if you see me when I'm taken away from you it shall it shall be so unto you but if you don't see me when I'm taken away it shall not be so Elisha did not want to miss this opport opportunity this I mean there's one thing there's one thing that was important to Elisha and that was having more than what Elijah had not a little bit more but twice as much and so he couldn't he couldn't just say let me know when you feel that spirit you know when you when you're starting to feel that rapture you know start to leave give me a call I'll be right It wasn't that that carnal, &gt;&gt; but I could just imagine Elisha being stuck next to Elijah like sleep sleeping with one eye open &gt;&gt; like I'm not leaving you out of my sight. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're going to the bathroom. Let's go. &gt;&gt; You're going to the store. Let's go. you're going to your mom's. Let's go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it he didn't want to miss his time of visitation. &gt;&gt; Because it only, you know, a raptures in the twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And if he would have just turned a little bit, God was able to take him up in the rapture and him not get it. &gt;&gt; That's right. But I think God was looking at Elisha and seeing the desire was so strong that he was sincere that he wanted to really work more for the Lord to it's what he he did, right? He literally did. He performed twice the amount of miracles. And I think that's what is needed today is we're we're needing a heart and a desire to not miss our visitation. Like I'm going to meet God when I go to church. Something's going to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We we we we we serve a living God. But you notice we have to get into the spirit, right? &gt;&gt; They that worship me must worship me in the spirit. It it's not good enough to just only meditate. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we got to break through into the spirit and and get in the presence of God and let him come down. And this is the truth. Um, I was praying um this morning and something happens when you pray. &gt;&gt; When you pray, things come to you that you weren't even thinking about. &gt;&gt; But when you're just trying your best, you know, you know, to study and what would be good and you know, that only lasts so much. You really got to ask God to come in and have his way. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that prayer, that time of humility where you get on your knees and you just say, "God, I need you. I need you." What What do you want for your people? What do they need, Lord? And the inspiration comes. This is why I believe in serving a real God, &gt;&gt; not just uh some formality of going to church and when church is over. But no, we serve a real God. I believe that Elijah, you know what he had to do to get his visitation? He had to give up a lot of things. He he probably had his his volleyball, his um his um his bowling, his knitting, his um fishing club, his um his hunting. I mean, he he he had to suffer a lot. He had to give up a lot. &gt;&gt; That's right. because he had to keep his eyes on Elijah. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm gonna say this. We need to get serious about our visitation. &gt;&gt; We got to spend some more time at home in prayer and get ready to meet God when we come to churchmen &gt;&gt; because I believe we can receive more if we empty out more. We can just empty out of the things of the world and and and and say, "God, fill me with the eternal things of God." &gt;&gt; There's a purpose for you, a purpose for your life. Did you know it's not for you to choose what your purpose is? &gt;&gt; I remember as a child I I wanted to be a number of things and you've heard me and like most people that are in the world they you know what do you want to be when you grow up and what do you want to do and and all these things and to someone who doesn't know God it's just natural. It's just natural. What do you you got you got to choose. But when you come into God's economy, it's not about you choosing what your purpose is. It's you finding out what his purpose is for your life. And it takes God, I don't know what you want me to do, but I believe you can show me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll say it like this. Even when you know like Moses's mother taught Moses that you're going to be a deliverer. And so he with all his ability, I'm a deliverer. I'm going to deliver my people. He still didn't have God on the inside showing him how to do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So even if we have the knowledge of what we're supposed to be doing, we still need the Holy Ghost inside directing us how to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, and the longer we wait, did you know the longer you're going to spend time in the wilderness, &gt;&gt; you know, going through hardships, you know, Moses went through what, 40 years? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Of hardships to get the old, brother Ram says, to get that old system out of him. &gt;&gt; That's right. that whole way of thinking, that carnal way of thinking. He finally got to a place where Lord, I I can't go down there. Very humble. In fact, he was the meakest man on the earth to the time of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what trials eventually do to you. Now, all things were created for God's purpose. So, it's not about us choosing what kind of purpose we want to have in life. It's about finding what God's purpose is for us. Um, you know, when you're trying to get some information and back in the day, brother Ron, when we went to school, we went to what's called a library. And in the library, we would check out books and we would learn about things by reading books. Well, today, you know, you just pull your phone out and you can learn the same thing and probably a lot of other stuff that's not true. God is here to reveal to us our purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Colossians 1:16 says, "For by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, the visible things and the invisible things. You know, the atoms and all the things that we don't see, God created them. And whether they be thrones or dominions, principalities or powers, all things were created by him and for him." Now, usually moms, how many moms we got here? Well, and dads, how many when you make dinner, you do not just make it for yourself, but you make it for others. But now when you go and you're going to go to a restaurant and you order something and uh you know brother brother Marty he's a very very he's a very cordial guy. He is he's my mentor. and he goes to the restaurant and he says, "I would like uh some fish." Because that's the last we got some fish when we went out. And if they they bring out some lobster tails and some shrimp and they say, "Here, well, at this point, I didn't order that." And when you go to a restaurant, you order stuff and they don't give it to you. You don't say, "Oh, yeah. Thanks. This is what I wanted." In fact, you're thinking about, "I should let them know this is not what I ordered." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to think that God would create you for his purpose and you say, "Well, Lord, I got my own thing going on." &gt;&gt; How is he going to feel about that? So now, I'm not saying this for you. You're God's children. You want to do God's will. But we we live in a world out there with people that are just full of doing their own thing. That's right. &gt;&gt; Doing their own purpose. In fact, many of them stand behind the pulpit because they want money. They want popularity. They they it's let's do a concert. Let's do entertainment. There's a lot of lot of things that that really are not just for his glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to say that God is a jealous God. &gt;&gt; And he does not want to share your time &gt;&gt; with your purpose. &gt;&gt; He wants you to seek to find out what your purpose is. And I'm telling you, your purpose in Christ is going to be connected to his eternal purpose because you were created for him. The flowers, God creates the flowers for him. The trees, the animals, everything brings God glory and honor because they're displaying his beauty. We as his children, we when we're with with the mind of Christ talking about the word, meditating upon, wanting to bring God honor through our lives, then we can fulfill the purpose of God. But we can't do it with a carnal mind. Right? All right. The So I just want to read this uh verse 17. Um for he is before all things and by him all things consistent. He is the head of the body, the church who is the beginning of the firstborn of the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence. So if I was to say to brother Ron, brother Ron, what does God want in your life? That preeminence. Brother James, what does God want in your life? Preeminence. It's through the preeminence that he can take free more agencies who can go either way and fulfill his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's only if he gets preeminence because he's God. He created us. He could make us a robot if he wanted to. But you know what that would remind me of? That would remind me of a manipulator. But he says, "Her if if you would like to serve me, then I put it in your heart. You serve me." 24 elders in heaven cast their crowns down and said, "Thou art worthy, oh Lord, to receive glory and honor and power. For thou has created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created." So now we were created for the pleasure of God. the very pleasure of God to make him happy. Ephesians 1:1, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. I want to be part of that. Uh, you know, Judas was used to fulfill the purpose of God. But notice where he ended up, the third of the angels to fulfill a a a purpose, but it wasn't eternal, right? It wasn't eternal. They they they they have a beginning, they have an end, but we have been called to an eternal purpose. It's not just naturally down here, but eternal purpose. And it's up to us to dig in and find out what that is for us. It's not for us to choose what we want our purpose to be. We do not tell God what we what his purpose is for our lives. We do not pick and choose what we want. God has a perfect will for our lives. And as long as we are alive, God has a purpose for our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he's done, he's never taken anybody before it was time. And it is his pleasure and not our not ours. God created us for his good pleasure, not for our pleasure. God's creation, as God's creation, our responsibility is to love the Lord with all our heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, to seek God's pleasure, to seek the good pleasure of his will, to seize the opportunity that we have when he comes and he visits us. To walk in God's purpose for our lives. We never want to miss when God's visiting because God is the only one that can give us power over our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And is how many times have we said, "I wish I wouldn't be like this. I I wish I wouldn't say that. I wish I wouldn't act like that. I wish I wish I was different. You know what I'm talking about? Well, God is the only one that holds that power. And if we humble ourselves be be underneath the mighty hand of God, he will lift us up in due season. The Bible tells us. The last verse I want to read here is in Romans chapter 8 28. And we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God and to them who are called according to whose purpose? &gt;&gt; His purpose. &gt;&gt; His purpose. His purpose. So at least give yourselves a chance every day and ask God what his purpose is for your life. Take the time to ask God, God, what is your purpose for my life? because I I I not only want to love you, I I I want to be I want to be doing your purpose. You're you're calling me to your purpose and I want to fulfill it. As the bride of Jesus Christ, our purpose can only be his purpose for our lives. It could only be h his because everybody else wanted to do their own. That's what it means to pick up your cross and follow him. To die daily. To seek those things which are above and to develop a more meaningful and purpose relationship with what? The word of God. To develop a more meaningful relationship with the word of God. The only way you can have a relationship with God is to have a relationship with his word. You can't just say I got a relationship with God but ignore his word. The word is what needs to become real more real for all of us. So we want to walk in his purpose. Walk with a purpose that matters. His purpose is the only purpose that matters. Only what's done for Christ by Christ will ever have be recognized in eternity. I just just imagine for a moment. I'm gonna take a minute here and I'm gonna I'm gonna say some joke. And really what I want is I want I want to get glory. I want people to look at me and say, "Wow, that was a good joke. I you know, I really that was a really good one. Oh, John, you know, that was a best one I ever heard." Do you actually think that's going to be an eternity? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. stealing glory from God, that ain't going to be an eternity. But if I share something that gives honor and glory to Jesus Christ, that will be in eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we see here that we want to walk in the purpose that God has for us. They that win souls is wise. That is the eternal purpose of God is to get our family together, our spiritual family together to be ambassadors for Jesus Christ to bring the word of God to somebody who doesn't have it. And I said, "This is my prayer." And let's just stand together as we pray that we would all find it in our heart to put towards our purpose of bringing the Bible to somebody, to bring the word of God to somebody. Wouldn't you want to have people on the other side that said, "I wouldn't have made it if it it hadn't been for you." That's right. &gt;&gt; And um Amen. Amen. And and and that God just wants to use our body to share his own word with somebody who's not saved. It's it's it's that simple. So, we have an eternal purpose to walk in. And let's just um let's begin to walk in it, I guess, if I could say it like this, with a with a purpose. you know, uh, a as we leave here, as we go on our next week, that this message would not fall to the side, but that we would think about it and begin to ask God, Lord, show me more of your purpose. Show me more of your purpose. Fill me with more of your spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that little chorus. Teach us to number our days. [Music] Teach us to number our day. Teach me to number our day [Music] that we may apply our hearts on to wisdom. Lord, teach us to number our days. Teach us to number our days. Oh, teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts on to wisdom. Lord, teach us to number our days. Oh, teach us to number our days. Teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts on to wisdom. Lord, teach us to number our days. Imagine any one of us here knew how many days we had no I don't care what the number is knowing that number would put us in a position to apply our hearts unto wisdom &gt;&gt; to make the best of our life and to fulfill how many's how many's um actually in your lifetime has put money in a bank or a CD or something for retirement Keep your hands up for a second. Okay, you better be thinking about it. Okay. And why do we do that? We do that because we want something for the future. &gt;&gt; We want something for when we're done working, we have something to live on. Well, we want something on the other side. Amen. &gt;&gt; That on the other side is put in down here when we're working on something eternal. &gt;&gt; It's not working on the natural, but it's working on the eternal. Amen. Let's sing that little course. Learning to lean. Learning to lean on Jesus. Learning to lean. I'm learning to lean. I'm learning to lean on Jesus. [Music] Gaining more power than I've ever seen. I'm learning to lean on Jesus. Oh, learning to lean. I'm learning to lean. I'm learning to lean on Jesus. Gaining more power than I've ever seen. I'm learning to lean on Jesus. Let go and let God have his wonderful way. Let go and let God have his way. Your sorrow will vanish. Your night turn to day. Let go and let God have his way. [Music] Let go and let God have his wonderful way. Let go and let God have his way. Your sorrows will vanish. Your night turn to day. Let go and let God have his
