[33:05] positionally placed positioning place so

[33:16] that she could be here today amen before
[33:19] we begin reading in verse 25 let's look
[33:22] to the author of this great word
[33:25] Heavenly Father we are unworthy Lord to
[33:29] even look upon this word it's
[33:32] it's holy it's pure it's
[33:34] it's you've kept it from man
[33:40] it was your anointing that moved upon
[33:43] holy men of old as they wrote your word
[33:47] Lord and you stand behind this word
[33:50] and today Lord we're approaching you
[33:53] humbly asking that you would bless our
[33:57] eyes to see our ears to hear and our
[34:00] hearts to receive the engrafted word
[34:02] today
[34:03] Lord we ask that you would forgive us
[34:06] and cleanse us from anything that would
[34:09] hinder that from happening you just take
[34:12] away all doubts from Lord and just bless
[34:16] the the sanctuary now with your great
[34:20] presence in the opening of the word
[34:23] father we thank you for the time of
[34:26] worship that we've had that we could
[34:28] express ourselves and worship you in
[34:31] spirit and in truth and now Lord we're
[34:34] Desiring to receive the Living Word into
[34:37] our our bosom and father unless you
[34:40] would come and break it to us Lord Lord
[34:42] it'll come short so we're leaning upon
[34:45] you and trusting you for each need now
[34:48] Lord
[34:49] we commit the service now to your hands
[34:51] for your honor and Glory we pray in
[34:53] Jesus Christ's name amen
[34:56] amen First Corinthians chapter 15
[34:58] starting with verse 25 he must reign
[35:02] till he have put all enemies under his
[35:06] feet amen
[35:07] amen The Last Enemy shall be destroyed
[35:10] is death amen for we have put all things
[35:12] under his feet but when he saith all
[35:15] things are put under him it is Manifest
[35:17] that he is accepted which did put all
[35:22] things under him and when all things
[35:25] shall be subdued unto him then shall the
[35:29] son also himself be subject unto him
[35:32] that put all things under him that God
[35:35] may be all in all amen God bless you may
[35:40] be seated
[35:43] Jesus said I have power to lay down my
[35:48] life
[35:49] and I have power to pick it up again
[35:53] in other words he said I am the
[35:55] resurrection and the life
[35:58] he had a power and we all want
[36:01] power
[36:03] to fix our problems
[36:06] we want Power
[36:08] when the Devils bothering us in our
[36:11] minds and we just can't seem to get the
[36:14] Victory and so we're all searching for
[36:18] that power
[36:20] and I believe the answer to standing on
[36:23] top of our problems is to get
[36:25] positionally placed in Christ amen which
[36:29] is to get underneath his word
[36:33] that's where you have true power over
[36:36] the enemy
[36:38] Jesus said in John chapter 10 verse 17
[36:40] therefore doth my father love me because
[36:44] I lay down my life that I may take it up
[36:47] again he says no man I taketh it from me
[36:50] but I lay it down of myself I have power
[36:53] to lay it down and I have power to take
[36:55] it up again this commandment have I
[36:57] received of my father
[36:59] amen
[37:06] Jesus loves us
[37:09] when we lay down our life
[37:13] amen and it is the hardest thing to do
[37:16] is to lay down her life
[37:18] but we're always searching for a power
[37:21] that can fix our problems right and I
[37:25] believe God is hidden Simplicity amen I
[37:27] believe the answer to Victory is to
[37:30] empty out of ourself and to come under
[37:33] subjection to God
[37:35] Jesus said in Matthew 28 18 He said all
[37:39] power is given unto me in heaven
[37:43] and in Earth
[37:46] and he in Luke chapter 9 I'm just laying
[37:49] a foundation here he gave that power to
[37:52] his disciples some power to his
[37:54] disciples in Luke 9 1 then Jesus called
[37:57] his 12 disciples together and gave them
[37:59] power and authority over all devils and
[38:05] to cure diseases
[38:07] and he sent them to preach the kingdom
[38:10] of God and to heal the sick so here
[38:13] Jesus has power he has power to lay on
[38:16] his life he has power to raise it again
[38:18] and he gives this he gives a power a
[38:23] portion of that power now to his
[38:25] disciples
[38:27] isn't that beautiful amen
[38:29] amen and uh how many is a disciple of
[38:32] Christ today amen
[38:33] amen I mean I believe that we that God
[38:36] has given us power he's given us a force
[38:40] he's given us Authority which to me is a
[38:43] privilege if you look up that word
[38:45] Authority it means privilege what a
[38:48] privilege we have that we can use the
[38:51] name of Jesus Christ amen in our lives
[38:54] to benefit Our Lives
[38:56] now brother Branham said that Judas was
[38:59] among them who received this power and
[39:02] this authority to have dominion over the
[39:04] enemy
[39:06] and if God would do that for Judas
[39:10] how much more would he do it for you me
[39:12] amen
[39:14] now we can have power and get out of
[39:17] position with God
[39:19] and and Judas did that and brother
[39:21] Brandon said that power without
[39:23] character or satanic and and
[39:25] Satan himself Lucifer he had a a power
[39:30] God had given him a power but he he took
[39:34] that power and he used it for himself
[39:37] at any time we take something that God
[39:40] has given us and we're not trying to
[39:42] point people to Christ
[39:45] you understand that that is the wrong
[39:48] way to use the power that God has given
[39:51] you because God has created all things
[39:52] for his glory
[39:57] now we all need to be in our spiritual
[40:00] position
[40:03] too many Believers are out of their
[40:05] position
[40:07] amen that's the truth Amen brother
[40:10] Brandon said preaching attracts The
[40:13] Sinner
[40:14] and it's it's just you know preaching is
[40:17] really more enjoyable than teaching
[40:21] but brother Brown said that teaching
[40:23] places us
[40:24] in position with Christ places Us in the
[40:29] body
[40:30] so what is our position what is our
[40:33] place what is our our ranking
[40:35] if if we look at the word
[40:38] sanctification we are taught by the
[40:41] prophet that it is a cleansing it's a
[40:44] washing and it sets us aside for the
[40:47] service of God so it actually places us
[40:50] in a position to be used by God
[40:54] and Jesus has given us power and he's
[40:57] given us Authority but are we in our
[41:01] spiritual position
[41:04] brother random I got a few quotes here
[41:06] if I could read this one is in the
[41:08] position of a believer in Christ brother
[41:10] Branham says and the tree is planted in
[41:14] Christ Jesus the unexhaustible Fountain
[41:18] of Life
[41:20] and in everything that a Believer has to
[41:25] do after he's placed in Christ Jesus
[41:29] everything he has need of in this
[41:32] Earthly journey is given to him when he
[41:35] is placed in Christ now how important it
[41:39] is to be in position amen
[41:42] that's right
[41:45] and all he has to do is drink and drink
[41:48] and push out and drink to every fruit of
[41:52] the spirit every gift of the spirit
[41:54] everything that's in Christ Jesus that
[41:56] belongs to you will be in you for the
[42:00] entire Journey wow
[42:05] Brandon said in the message Jehovah
[42:07] Jireh he says and them baptized by the
[42:09] Holy Ghost into the Church of the Living
[42:11] God and positionally placed into the
[42:15] body as a position to work with the
[42:20] members of the body of Christ
[42:24] so when we get in position
[42:27] with Christ we are actually working
[42:30] together with one another amen
[42:34] so you know it just kind of stuffs out
[42:36] you know the thought process of of
[42:38] coming to church being a part of a
[42:41] church but not working together you're
[42:44] not really in in position uh when you're
[42:48] not working with the members of the body
[42:50] of Christ there has to be a working
[42:51] together
[42:53] message India trip report brother
[42:55] Brandon said when God has positionally
[42:58] placed you stay there amen
[43:01] and be loyal to that word as you know
[43:04] how to be and God will bless it
[43:07] Amen in the message hear ye him Brothers
[43:10] says oh I wish I had the ability to
[43:12] grind that into the people's heart God
[43:15] is looking for time tested Christians
[43:20] amen every son that cometh to God must
[43:22] be tried
[43:24] child trained tested
[43:26] and you who jump from Pillar To Post
[43:30] and this to that and in and out how can
[43:35] God ever adopt you into his family or
[43:39] positionally place you right
[43:42] right now think of that for a moment he
[43:45] said
[43:46] how can you be positionally placed when
[43:49] you won't stand still long enough for
[43:52] God to do it
[43:55] I believe as we come to church and we
[43:57] hear the word this word is what
[44:01] is is God is speaking to us to
[44:04] positionally place us
[44:06] but if we just ignore we we do what we
[44:08] want to do we take what we want we kind
[44:10] of make it a smorgasbord because we're
[44:13] just too busy
[44:15] they were not standing still long enough
[44:17] to get serious with the word
[44:23] you remember the Centurion
[44:25] we all remember the ceterian
[44:28] he was positionally placed
[44:33] he was clothed with humility
[44:35] he felt Unworthy of God's authority to
[44:40] come underneath his roof think about
[44:42] that I wonder how many times we go home
[44:45] and we feel unworthy to take the word
[44:48] that God just gave us at church
[44:54] I mean he was in his position
[44:57] he understood rank
[45:00] and that the word of God was the final
[45:02] absolute
[45:04] Jesus said the word that I've spoken
[45:07] shall judge you in the last day it is
[45:10] the final absolute Matthew chapter 8
[45:13] verse 8. let's look at this Matthew 8
[45:15] verse 8 the Centurion answered and said
[45:18] Lord I am not worthy that thou should
[45:21] come under my roof
[45:24] but just speak the word only that's all
[45:28] that's needed it just speak the word
[45:30] only and my servant shall be healed
[45:34] he says for I am a man under Authority
[45:37] having soldiers under me and I say to
[45:39] this man go and he goeth and to another
[45:41] come and he cometh and to my servant do
[45:43] this and and he doeth it and when Jesus
[45:46] heard it he marveled and said unto them
[45:48] that followed those that were around him
[45:51] verily I say unto you I have not found
[45:53] so great of Faith No not in Israel
[45:58] it takes great faith to know your
[46:00] position
[46:01] and to remain in your position
[46:06] it takes Faith to do that you're no
[46:08] match for the devil
[46:11] brother Brian son the principles of
[46:13] Divine Healing he says the word of God
[46:15] will defeat the Devil any place anywhere
[46:18] anytime or on any condition
[46:21] the word of God is what defeats the
[46:25] devil not us
[46:28] that's why we have to get into our place
[46:32] and that Centurion knew his place
[46:38] amen maybe you have children under you
[46:43] maybe you tell them what to do and they
[46:45] do it
[46:47] maybe you tell them what they're doing
[46:48] they don't do it
[46:52] maybe have a wife
[46:54] maybe you have workers under your
[46:56] Authority at work
[46:59] the word has authority over the devil
[47:04] not you
[47:06] you're no match for the devil
[47:08] but God gives us authority over the
[47:11] devil when we are under the word
[47:18] can't separate them
[47:20] a man is only as good as his name we
[47:23] heard a little bit about that last
[47:24] service
[47:26] his name is Jesus
[47:29] his name is good
[47:32] in my name you'll cast out devils
[47:35] you're only as good as your word and
[47:37] Jesus's word is so good that even the
[47:40] Devils have to come under subjection to
[47:42] it and they don't want to
[47:44] amen Jesus said they shall take up
[47:46] serpents they shall drink deadly uh if
[47:49] they drink any day anything it shall not
[47:51] hurt them they shall lay hands on the
[47:53] sick and they shall recover all in the
[47:56] name of Jesus
[47:58] his name is a high tower
[48:01] the righteous could run into it the name
[48:04] of Jesus is our security
[48:08] but the question is are we under
[48:11] that name
[48:13] are we under that name or do we just use
[48:17] that name
[48:19] because we know the people in the world
[48:21] they use that name in vain
[48:24] even Jesus said in vain do they worship
[48:27] me
[48:30] in vain they worship me so to be to
[48:33] worship God correctly and I don't have
[48:35] the quote right now but I do got it back
[48:38] in my office that you can only worship
[48:40] God correctly when you're in your
[48:43] position
[48:45] and he's Jesus said that you they that
[48:47] worship me must worship me in spirit and
[48:50] in truth
[48:52] so God is looking for us to take our
[48:54] positions not just over the devil but
[48:57] under his word
[48:59] we can't
[49:00] halfway get into our position right amen
[49:03] I mean just using the word to benefit
[49:06] Our Lives
[49:09] but not using the word to please God in
[49:12] all things
[49:15] the only thing that's above the devil is
[49:17] God we need to remember that
[49:20] brother Brandon said in the message
[49:21] going beyond the camp he said when God
[49:24] fortified his church in the Garden of
[49:25] Eden his people they had one wall to
[49:31] stand behind
[49:32] and that was the word
[49:36] they had one Shield one armor one thing
[49:39] because God known what would defeat the
[49:42] Devil and that's the word
[49:44] and that's why we have to get underneath
[49:46] the word
[49:49] because the word is our protection
[49:53] or behind the word as
[49:55] brother Brandon is saying here
[49:59] when we take our position over the devil
[50:02] we want to rebuke him and we want to
[50:05] tell them to get out
[50:08] and not be subject to God's word
[50:12] we're trying to lift ourselves up above
[50:15] both the devil and God wow
[50:18] truth the truth
[50:21] and that and God that's where God draws
[50:24] the line
[50:25] it's true amen amen God is looking for
[50:28] us to take our position of laying down
[50:30] our lies first give me some scriptures
[50:32] brother John humble yourself under the
[50:35] mighty hand of God that he may exalt you
[50:37] in due time
[50:39] submit yourselves therefore to God
[50:43] resist the devil and he will flee from
[50:45] you notice the order here be clothed
[50:48] with humility for God resisteth the
[50:51] proud and gives grace to the humble
[50:53] so we got to take our position under the
[50:57] word under the mighty hand of God Amen
[51:00] and God will take care of our problems
[51:02] amen
[51:04] now just as a centurion since uh the
[51:07] Centurion knew his place we've got to
[51:10] know our place we've got to be in our
[51:12] place of God's Great spiritual body and
[51:15] it's our own personal responsibility to
[51:19] make sure that we remain in that place
[51:23] we just can't you know come in on
[51:25] Sundays we got to remain in our place
[51:28] which is under the word
[51:30] in First Corinthians chapter 11
[51:33] verse 1 we know that uh turn with me if
[51:37] or just write it down every every man
[51:40] has a head and I just want to bring this
[51:43] scripture
[51:44] Paul is saying be followers are me even
[51:47] as I also am of Christ so he's telling
[51:51] stay in your position
[51:54] get behind me
[51:57] because I know that what I'm preaching
[51:59] is the truth if an angel from heaven
[52:02] comes preaching any other gospel than
[52:04] what I've ordered even if I preach
[52:06] something different he's let him be a
[52:09] curse
[52:12] so
[52:14] we have the gospel it was given by Paul
[52:16] be followers of me even as I am of
[52:18] Christ remember when brother Branham had
[52:21] that that vision and he saw the bride in
[52:24] this age get out of line
[52:26] and then he screamed get back in
[52:29] position get back in line is really what
[52:32] he said
[52:33] but get in position and so when we got a
[52:36] five-fold Ministry and when they're
[52:38] yielded to the Lord they will scream out
[52:41] this message
[52:43] and if we're true blue and we want to
[52:46] please God we will get back in line with
[52:48] the word of God
[52:49] yes every time verse two now I Praise
[52:52] You Brethren that ye remember me in all
[52:55] things and keep the ordinances now you
[52:59] remember this and keep the ordinances as
[53:02] I've delivered them to you
[53:04] but I would have you to know that the
[53:07] head of every man is Christ and the head
[53:08] of the woman is the man in the head of
[53:10] Christ is God so you have God you have
[53:13] Christ you have man you have the uh the
[53:17] woman under the man
[53:19] now there's positions Every Man Has a
[53:23] headship
[53:26] and of course Christ is the head of
[53:28] every man
[53:29] but he has placed a spiritual leadership
[53:32] over us and that is a pastor amen
[53:37] now for you that did not say Amen to
[53:41] that
[53:42] I know some things are hard to accept
[53:47] but there's a reason for it
[53:50] brother Brian said that man
[53:52] is the man that God has ordained to lead
[53:55] us through
[53:57] we certainly don't want to be without
[53:58] the man that is ordained to lead us
[54:01] through
[54:02] we need to find a scripture that says uh
[54:05] God has ordained me to lead me through
[54:10] and and then you can have confidence not
[54:13] being under that headship
[54:17] uh
[54:19] it's I hope it's okay that I'm preaching
[54:21] this to me
[54:30] there's a reason that God gave us
[54:32] headship amen amen and here's the reason
[54:35] it's not too usurp authority over
[54:37] anybody right but God is not the author
[54:41] of confusion
[54:44] that God works because look I can go
[54:46] through on to a number of people and get
[54:49] a number of different opinions about
[54:51] something
[54:52] and then all they got to do is pick what
[54:55] I want
[54:56] whatever appeals to me whatever I think
[54:59] but it's not going to be Christ
[55:03] because that's not how God operates God
[55:05] has offices and we must remain under the
[55:10] office that he's placed us in
[55:13] and God will use that office somehow
[55:16] some way to meet the need that you have
[55:21] amen he will direct you
[55:25] have you ever wondered why God has given
[55:28] us a pastor
[55:34] I mean I I've said this years ago but
[55:36] you know a pastor really isn't a
[55:39] financial institute
[55:43] he's not the handyman that fixes all the
[55:45] problems
[55:48] I asked someone one time
[55:51] what they thought headship was
[55:54] the purpose of headship not a pastor but
[55:58] headship
[55:59] and they said to protect or comfort
[56:03] or Shield them
[56:06] and I thought well you know there's
[56:08] truth to that but that's only part of it
[56:12] that's missing something
[56:14] it carries a greater meaning than that
[56:16] headshep also means leadership for our
[56:19] lives
[56:22] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 and I just
[56:25] we're talking about positions right
[56:27] we're talking about being positioned
[56:29] there's certain things that we we must
[56:32] get in position with
[56:34] it says wife submit yourselves to your
[56:37] own husband as unto the Lord Brother
[56:39] John are you read that because you're
[56:41] having a problem with your wife right
[56:42] now no I'm not things couldn't be better
[56:44] right now between me and her
[56:48] for the husband is the head of the wife
[56:50] even as Christ is the head of the church
[56:53] and he is the savior of the body so
[56:55] showing us position
[56:57] I looked up that word head you know what
[57:00] it means the husband is the head of the
[57:02] wife when I looked up that word head if
[57:04] you look it up
[57:05] there's just one word that it means you
[57:07] know what it means head
[57:10] means head
[57:12] in other words the wife is not
[57:16] she doesn't do the thinking
[57:18] the church doesn't do the thinking the
[57:20] church doesn't call the the shots Christ
[57:23] is the head of the church it is his mind
[57:25] his thinking his direction for us
[57:28] he is the head period that's all there
[57:30] is to it
[57:34] therefore as the church is subject unto
[57:37] Christ
[57:38] so let the wise be to their own husbands
[57:41] and everything now this is so so
[57:43] mightily important I remember the
[57:45] prophet I don't got the quote here but I
[57:46] remember the prophet saying that you
[57:48] wives need to be subject to their
[57:49] husbands even if they're wrong
[57:51] wow that's true why
[57:54] because God doesn't want you to get out
[57:58] of position
[58:00] and there's no excuse for it
[58:03] because we all day could say well I
[58:05] think you're wrong I don't agree with
[58:06] you I think you're wrong
[58:08] God's not going to honor that
[58:12] so God will honor your place God will
[58:16] correct your head
[58:18] he will
[58:19] the church may say the church must stay
[58:22] subject to the word it must it must
[58:26] reverence the word it must obey the word
[58:28] amen
[58:30] now as we near the end more and more
[58:33] people
[58:34] feel they don't need a pastor they're
[58:36] staying home
[58:37] they don't need headship they kind of
[58:39] keep their distance from the pastor they
[58:41] they don't like being told what to do
[58:43] but God will hold every person
[58:45] accountable
[58:48] to their head
[58:51] and a good example of that is Jezebel
[58:55] brother bran said that Elijah was
[58:58] Jezebel's pastor
[59:00] now she didn't go to church she didn't
[59:03] come under subjection but she was still
[59:06] held accountable by God
[59:09] that's right
[59:12] now the pastor cannot give you a
[59:14] revelation of who your pastor is
[59:19] only God can show you who your head is
[59:23] if you don't have a head or you don't
[59:25] want a head
[59:27] then you're basically headless
[59:31] and will become Lawless in some way
[59:37] I want to give you some scriptures to
[59:38] help to help us make sure that we're
[59:41] positionally placed because God uses the
[59:45] office of a pastor to lead us amen
[59:48] Hebrews chapter 13 Hebrews chapter 13
[59:51] verse 17 if you want to write it down
[59:53] now he doesn't just use it from the
[59:56] pulpit right
[59:57] the offices of a pastor let me just say
[1:00:00] this Saints am I your pastor
[1:00:04] only when I'm behind the pulpit no
[1:00:08] no am I your pastor just Wednesdays and
[1:00:11] Sundays
[1:00:13] am I your pastor when I'm on vacation
[1:00:17] okay pastor's pastor Pastor is a is an
[1:00:21] office it's a position it's a place so
[1:00:23] God can use that in any conversation
[1:00:28] at any time
[1:00:32] amen all right Hebrews 13 verse 17 obey
[1:00:35] them
[1:00:36] that have the rule over you
[1:00:38] and submit yourself notice get in
[1:00:41] position
[1:00:42] for they watch for your souls
[1:00:48] now we find out the real
[1:00:51] the real purpose here
[1:00:53] is for the soul
[1:00:55] it's not all the other things it's for
[1:00:58] the soul now it doesn't mean he can't
[1:01:00] help it the other things
[1:01:03] but there's a watching over the soul and
[1:01:06] if we get the spirit or the attitude
[1:01:08] that I don't need help over my soul
[1:01:10] because I already gave it to Christ
[1:01:11] you're really missing
[1:01:14] your relationship with God
[1:01:18] as they must give an account that they
[1:01:21] may do it with joy and not with grief
[1:01:25] for that is unprofitable for you can you
[1:01:28] say Amen to that all right Romans
[1:01:30] Chapter 13 Verse number one
[1:01:33] Romans 13 Verse 1 let every soul be
[1:01:35] subject unto the higher powers for there
[1:01:37] is no power but of god the powers that
[1:01:40] be ordained of God
[1:01:44] let every soul be subject unto the
[1:01:46] higher Powers whosoever therefore
[1:01:49] resists the power
[1:01:51] resisteth the ordinance of God now
[1:01:55] remember Paul said keep the ordinances
[1:01:58] and they that resist shall receive to
[1:02:01] themselves a damnation
[1:02:03] for the rulers are not a terror to good
[1:02:06] works but to evil will thou then not be
[1:02:09] afraid of the power do that which is
[1:02:11] good and thou shall have Praise of the
[1:02:13] same for he is the Minister of God to
[1:02:16] thee for good but if thou do that which
[1:02:18] is evil be afraid he beareth not the
[1:02:20] sword in vain for he is the Minister of
[1:02:22] God a Revenger to execute wrath upon
[1:02:24] them that doeth evil wherefore ye must
[1:02:28] needs be subject not only to not only
[1:02:30] for wrath but also for conscious sake
[1:02:34] and for this cause payee tribute also
[1:02:37] for they are God's ministers attending
[1:02:39] continually upon this very thing and
[1:02:41] render therefore to all their dues
[1:02:43] tribute to Tribute is due custom to whom
[1:02:45] custom feared unto whom fear honor to
[1:02:48] whom honor oh no man nothing but love
[1:02:51] one another for he that loveth another
[1:02:53] have fulfilled the law it kind of you
[1:02:56] know we're living in these perilous
[1:02:58] times and Paul told Timothy that one of
[1:03:01] the great uh things that you would find
[1:03:03] in the church is unthankfulness
[1:03:06] and people are just basically more in
[1:03:08] love with themselves people don't feel
[1:03:11] like they owe anybody anything
[1:03:14] it's kind of like every man from himself
[1:03:17] now I just say one way to help you to
[1:03:20] remain thankful
[1:03:23] is just pray for your head
[1:03:26] amen pray for your head pray pray for
[1:03:29] your pastor not that he'll just you know
[1:03:31] bless us with a in more of an enjoyable
[1:03:34] service
[1:03:37] but pray for him
[1:03:39] it was the very camels that Rebecca
[1:03:43] water that carried
[1:03:45] her to her destination
[1:03:50] amen but if you just use the church for
[1:03:52] what you can get out of it see God sees
[1:03:54] right through that thing how how is God
[1:03:57] ever going to honor that
[1:04:00] we find today that more and more people
[1:04:02] are forsaking going to church
[1:04:05] the assembling of themselves together
[1:04:06] they got their reasons
[1:04:09] but you know you can't find any
[1:04:10] scriptural ones
[1:04:12] I'm so glad that God sent a Prophet by
[1:04:15] and said well if you can't get to a
[1:04:17] church that can get a whole loaf get to
[1:04:20] a church where you can at least get a
[1:04:22] slice of bread amen he showed us the
[1:04:26] importance of staying in church
[1:04:29] so when a person forsakes going to
[1:04:32] church
[1:04:33] they're getting more and more out of
[1:04:35] their position with God
[1:04:37] brother Brown says that every Christian
[1:04:39] should have a home church that he
[1:04:41] belongs to
[1:04:43] right and he said to become a good
[1:04:45] member there
[1:04:47] amen find a home Church
[1:04:50] and become a good member
[1:04:53] we're going to be talking a little bit
[1:04:54] about members
[1:04:56] when a Believer is positionally placed
[1:04:58] in Christ they will undoubtedly support
[1:05:01] from their position but if you're not in
[1:05:03] position
[1:05:05] you're not going to support
[1:05:07] are you with me
[1:05:09] 's enjoying this
[1:05:11] amen praise the Lord I got some quotes
[1:05:13] here four different messages brother
[1:05:15] Brandon first one I greater than Solomon
[1:05:17] is here brother Brandon says that's
[1:05:19] right support your pastor support your
[1:05:21] church support the cause
[1:05:24] that stands for the right thing
[1:05:27] that's right if it's right I owe
[1:05:31] something to it
[1:05:32] that's the way we should feel if this be
[1:05:35] of God not only our money our money is
[1:05:38] little
[1:05:40] but we owe him our hearts
[1:05:42] our time amen time amen amen our talents
[1:05:47] and everything we have we owe it to God
[1:05:51] if it's right let's go into it with
[1:05:54] everything we got
[1:05:55] if it isn't right go find what's right
[1:05:58] then get into it amen
[1:06:01] you're not allowed to go anywhere
[1:06:04] without getting into it
[1:06:06] that's that's what he's saying
[1:06:09] in God manifesting his gifts brother
[1:06:11] Brian said if Christian religion is
[1:06:14] right it's worth everything that you can
[1:06:16] do for it
[1:06:18] support your church support your pastor
[1:06:20] support your missionaries
[1:06:22] do everything that's in your power to do
[1:06:25] and give God the best you got
[1:06:28] [Music]
[1:06:30] I think we all of us have more
[1:06:33] than just showing up the church to hear
[1:06:36] the word I think we all got more than
[1:06:37] that don't you
[1:06:39] in the message God's provided away
[1:06:41] brother Brian says go to church
[1:06:43] every day
[1:06:45] that they have service
[1:06:47] go
[1:06:51] attend your church be real loyal amen
[1:06:55] amen just stand by your church stand by
[1:06:59] your pastor help them out with
[1:07:01] everything you've got
[1:07:03] give them spiritual support
[1:07:06] fast and pray for him and have faith in
[1:07:10] him and God will lead the church aunt to
[1:07:13] that glorious day that we're looking
[1:07:15] forward to come
[1:07:17] in the message why brother Graham says I
[1:07:20] believe that every person should join
[1:07:22] the church
[1:07:25] I absolutely I absolutely believe that
[1:07:28] every person should stand at their post
[1:07:31] of Duty
[1:07:33] and when they're pastors they're
[1:07:34] preaching or an evangelist or something
[1:07:38] I think they ought to stand at their
[1:07:41] post of Duty
[1:07:43] they ought to support that church with
[1:07:45] everything they got in them
[1:07:47] with their ties with their offerings
[1:07:50] with anything that they that they're
[1:07:54] called on to do
[1:07:56] now we're talking about being called
[1:07:58] unto do he said be willing and be happy
[1:08:03] if your pastor asks you to do something
[1:08:05] in your church you should do it
[1:08:11] not only be willing but be you got to do
[1:08:13] with a smile
[1:08:16] good quotes good quotes he's he's
[1:08:19] positionally placing us amen
[1:08:23] now we have message Believers today that
[1:08:25] ignore their position
[1:08:28] in the church
[1:08:29] and yet struggling with their problems
[1:08:34] they take on
[1:08:36] a
[1:08:38] an attitude that isn't doesn't line up
[1:08:40] with these quotes or what the word has
[1:08:43] said
[1:08:44] I don't need to listen to that I'm
[1:08:46] already baptized in Christ then give you
[1:08:49] scripture
[1:08:51] for by one Spirit we're all baptized
[1:08:53] into the body that's a good that's a
[1:08:56] good scripture and that's the truth
[1:08:59] but brother Brian says when you're
[1:09:01] become baptized with the Holy Ghost you
[1:09:03] become positionally placed in the body
[1:09:05] of Christ
[1:09:07] and in the message this great warrior
[1:09:09] David he said positionally placed here
[1:09:11] on the Earth
[1:09:13] for a purpose
[1:09:15] to do the will of God
[1:09:18] isn't that precious
[1:09:20] I mean to me I love these teachings
[1:09:24] this helps us this places us
[1:09:27] the very holy spirit that baptizes us
[1:09:30] into the body will positionally place us
[1:09:33] see we still need a church
[1:09:36] in the message the voice of the sign
[1:09:38] brother Brandon says we believe that
[1:09:40] every Christian
[1:09:42] ought to have a home church that they go
[1:09:44] to
[1:09:45] every Christian ought to meet somewhere
[1:09:47] with believers
[1:09:50] another place he said that they ought to
[1:09:54] be in church every time the doors are
[1:09:55] open
[1:09:57] so every person needs a church and they
[1:10:00] need a pastor
[1:10:01] where they can come under the authority
[1:10:04] of the word and it be the absolute for
[1:10:07] their life because look outside of the
[1:10:10] trueness of this message
[1:10:12] people are looking for Fellowship Halls
[1:10:15] they're looking for a place they can
[1:10:16] come either enjoyment be entertained and
[1:10:21] feel good when they leave get pumped up
[1:10:23] be feel good about their lives
[1:10:27] and they're missing Holy Ghost
[1:10:29] leadership
[1:10:31] so we need a place
[1:10:34] that we can come under authority to
[1:10:36] whatever that word says
[1:10:39] it's the way that God has ordained it to
[1:10:41] be
[1:10:42] just pushing play at home won't work
[1:10:48] God won't respect that God has given us
[1:10:51] a five-fold Ministry to get us out of
[1:10:53] here and if we don't
[1:10:55] we don't follow his way we try climbing
[1:10:58] up some other way
[1:10:59] you you can't just look it you'd be
[1:11:03] absolutely wrong just to listen to me
[1:11:08] you'd be absolutely wrong
[1:11:11] and I'll say it like this you couldn't
[1:11:13] make it by just listening to me
[1:11:16] and I'll be honest with you I couldn't
[1:11:18] be who I am without the prophet
[1:11:21] amen and I couldn't be who I am without
[1:11:22] sitting under other pastors
[1:11:28] so we need the whole five-fold Ministry
[1:11:30] amen
[1:11:34] no God has given us headship not only
[1:11:36] for comfort and protection but also
[1:11:39] Direction
[1:11:40] for our lives
[1:11:42] God is not the author of confusion and
[1:11:46] I'll say it like this headship
[1:11:47] eliminates confusion
[1:11:50] headship eliminates confusion remember
[1:11:53] that
[1:11:55] this word eliminates confusion
[1:11:59] you know if our idea isn't lining up
[1:12:02] with something in the word brother
[1:12:04] Brandon says go back read it because
[1:12:06] this word needs our ideas need to
[1:12:09] dovetail with this word from cover to
[1:12:11] cover from Genesis to Revelations
[1:12:15] so to be positionally placed brother
[1:12:18] Brandon said we must be at our pulse of
[1:12:20] Duty
[1:12:26] we are not going to be at our pulse of
[1:12:28] Duty if we're not a member of the church
[1:12:32] so if you're a member of the church
[1:12:35] you got to be at your post to duty
[1:12:37] there's just there's so much Spirits out
[1:12:40] there that I don't have to come to
[1:12:41] church
[1:12:43] and we just don't we don't want that
[1:12:45] Spirit to get on us
[1:12:47] because it's not right
[1:12:51] what constitutes us as being a member of
[1:12:53] this church
[1:12:56] now we know everybody's welcomed here
[1:12:59] but what makes you a member here
[1:13:02] anybody got any ideas
[1:13:06] it's awful quiet
[1:13:09] can I tell you what makes you a member
[1:13:11] here
[1:13:12] it was the same thing that made somebody
[1:13:15] a member in brother branham's Church
[1:13:18] I figured I'd go with that what's the
[1:13:20] best thing I know
[1:13:23] brother Brian said the message church or
[1:13:25] he says we are responsible for our own
[1:13:29] our own
[1:13:31] and now he's going to Define what's on
[1:13:34] what our own is he said that's steady
[1:13:37] constant members of the Tabernacle that
[1:13:41] come here and worship with us we are
[1:13:44] Duty bound to them as our brothers and
[1:13:46] sisters who have proven to be our
[1:13:51] members of this Gathering so we got a
[1:13:55] little a little clue here it's not
[1:13:57] everything but we got a little clue it's
[1:13:59] constant members
[1:14:01] steady constant members
[1:14:06] amen amen and they have to they have to
[1:14:10] prove
[1:14:14] two things were required to be a member
[1:14:16] at brother randoms Tabernacle
[1:14:20] at Brandon Tabernacle on the placings of
[1:14:22] deacons brother Brandon said and the
[1:14:24] church are those who come and support
[1:14:27] the church with their presence
[1:14:30] with their ties and their offerings
[1:14:32] amen every member of this church that
[1:14:35] comes here regularly and supports it
[1:14:38] with your tithes and offerings which is
[1:14:41] which is considered and I'm quoting a
[1:14:44] member of this church
[1:14:46] it it's pretty clear-cut
[1:14:49] so you can go to church never pay your
[1:14:52] tithes and you're really not a member
[1:14:55] you can come to church pay your tithes
[1:14:57] don't come here regularly and you're
[1:14:58] really not a member right
[1:15:01] it goes both ways
[1:15:03] you got to have both amen
[1:15:07] amen I looked at that word regular
[1:15:10] it means arranged in a constant or
[1:15:13] defined pattern especially with the same
[1:15:17] space between interval incidences
[1:15:21] Wednesday Sunday Wednesday Sunday
[1:15:24] Wednesday Sunday
[1:15:27] I think that's sane don't you
[1:15:32] systematic or well ordered another way
[1:15:35] is faithful all right
[1:15:38] another way to define it is faithful
[1:15:40] a person that didn't attend church
[1:15:43] regularly or didn't support the church
[1:15:45] with their tithes and offerings were not
[1:15:46] even allowed to vote
[1:15:49] about church matters in brother
[1:15:51] branham's Church
[1:15:53] weren't even allowed to and if I
[1:15:56] remember correctly when I went to
[1:15:57] Brother Johnson's Church you had to be
[1:15:59] going there two years
[1:16:01] um not only going there two years you
[1:16:03] had to be faithful for two years
[1:16:05] because a lot of times people come in
[1:16:07] slow
[1:16:08] and they don't even get on track of
[1:16:09] paying their ties or get on track or
[1:16:11] coming Faithfully but you got to be
[1:16:13] doing that thing for two years
[1:16:16] and that doesn't mean that you did it
[1:16:18] you know six months last year
[1:16:21] and stop doing it
[1:16:22] that don't work now I want us to really
[1:16:25] take inventory are we in our position
[1:16:28] and I know you know you all here you're
[1:16:31] you're all in your position you're here
[1:16:33] okay I I I told one brother I said I
[1:16:37] don't even know who pays tithes it's
[1:16:38] none of my business
[1:16:40] it is God's business and it is my
[1:16:43] business to get across the importance of
[1:16:45] paying your ties
[1:16:47] I will say we've in our men's meeting
[1:16:48] someone brought up tithe pain and I
[1:16:51] don't know who it was
[1:16:52] it doesn't matter but uh
[1:16:57] uh it was concluded that you know we
[1:17:00] need to talk about tide paying next
[1:17:02] men's meeting because it's an important
[1:17:05] issue
[1:17:10] amen all right Hebrews chapter 7.
[1:17:15] he says you see what a strict thing it
[1:17:17] is to pay tithes
[1:17:19] tithing is right every Christian is Duty
[1:17:23] bound to pay tie he said that's right
[1:17:25] that's never changed
[1:17:30] Redemption by judgment Brethren said in
[1:17:33] his prayer Our Kind Heavenly Father
[1:17:35] thou has taught us in the word that let
[1:17:38] every man lay aside that which God has
[1:17:41] prospered him
[1:17:43] and when the first that when the first
[1:17:46] day of the week when he when we come
[1:17:49] together that we should bring in our
[1:17:51] tithes and our offerings into the place
[1:17:53] your house
[1:17:56] and the message my life story brother
[1:17:58] Brian says I worked and I paid my tithes
[1:18:01] right at the church
[1:18:03] I believe in paying tithes and God has
[1:18:06] blessed blessed it to me many millions
[1:18:09] of times
[1:18:12] what a testimony
[1:18:14] in the message the pilgr the pergamon
[1:18:17] church age
[1:18:18] God bless our brother here I I you're
[1:18:22] not a member of our church but you're
[1:18:24] hearing if you ever wanted to be what we
[1:18:27] believe in but this is not to you you
[1:18:30] know this is not to you but if it if it
[1:18:34] if it's uh
[1:18:36] bearing witness in your heart just you
[1:18:39] know praise the Lord amen but I just
[1:18:40] want to know we're not preaching to you
[1:18:42] okay
[1:18:44] okay
[1:18:47] um the pergament church age if people
[1:18:49] were taught to pay their tithes that
[1:18:52] would be all there would be they would
[1:18:54] all uh would be to it that's God's plan
[1:18:57] but God but God has a plan but man wants
[1:19:02] to make his own plan
[1:19:04] hi breading God's plan
[1:19:08] right your ties belong to God
[1:19:11] they are to be brought to the into the
[1:19:14] storehouse of the church
[1:19:16] that feeds you that you attend
[1:19:20] to the pastor that God has given you
[1:19:24] what your pastor does with it now that's
[1:19:26] his business
[1:19:28] now there are pastors out there that
[1:19:30] take that money
[1:19:33] and they they don't use it the way God
[1:19:36] wants them to use it I'll just say it
[1:19:37] like that
[1:19:39] that's why it's important to
[1:19:45] get a revelation of your pastor because
[1:19:48] if you if if if a man is taking money
[1:19:51] and he's just using it on himself to get
[1:19:53] more Cadillacs and more gold chains and
[1:19:56] more houses and whatever he's doing with
[1:19:59] it then it's kind of hard to have
[1:20:01] confidence to stand behind that Pastor
[1:20:03] and support him
[1:20:06] okay Malachi chapter 3 verse 6 for I am
[1:20:08] the Lord I change not
[1:20:13] therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
[1:20:16] consumed
[1:20:17] even from the days of your father's
[1:20:20] you're gone away from my ordinance so
[1:20:22] here's the statement now you've gone
[1:20:24] away from my ordinances remember Paul
[1:20:26] said keep my ordinances
[1:20:28] and have not kept them
[1:20:31] return unto me and I will return unto
[1:20:34] you notice get underneath the word and I
[1:20:36] will support you amen right return unto
[1:20:39] me get in your place and I will return
[1:20:41] unto you saith the Lord of hosts but ye
[1:20:43] said wherein shall we return
[1:20:47] people don't even realize when they
[1:20:49] leave God
[1:20:50] right
[1:20:51] right well a man rob God
[1:20:56] yet you have robbed me but you say
[1:20:59] wherein if you rub wherein have we
[1:21:02] robbed thee Lord and he says in ties and
[1:21:07] in offerings
[1:21:11] and because that you you you stole from
[1:21:14] me
[1:21:16] you're cursed
[1:21:19] you're cursed you don't even know it
[1:21:22] you're cursed with a curse
[1:21:24] for you rob me even this whole nation
[1:21:32] see when we don't submit ourselves under
[1:21:35] the mighty hand of God's word
[1:21:38] we can be cursed
[1:21:41] and if we're cursed with a curse then
[1:21:44] how are we going to have authority over
[1:21:45] the devil
[1:21:47] amen how are we going to get all of our
[1:21:50] other problems underneath our feet
[1:21:53] are we just going to preach a gospel
[1:21:55] that just says use the name of Jesus and
[1:21:57] do this and take care of this and you
[1:21:59] don't got to listen to him and forget
[1:22:01] about coming under subjection to the
[1:22:03] word of God
[1:22:07] the only thing that's stronger than the
[1:22:10] devil
[1:22:11] is God
[1:22:13] and God requires us to have submission
[1:22:16] to the word
[1:22:19] so part of the equation of putting your
[1:22:22] problems underneath your feet
[1:22:24] is getting under all of God's word
[1:22:28] amen verse 10 bring ye all your tithes
[1:22:31] into the storehouse
[1:22:34] that there may be meat in my house and
[1:22:39] prove me now we're with saith the Lord
[1:22:41] of hosts if I will not open you
[1:22:44] personally the windows of heaven and
[1:22:47] pour you out a blessing that you that
[1:22:50] there shall not be room enough to
[1:22:54] receive it
[1:22:58] he promised to do exceedly above all
[1:23:00] that we would ask or even think
[1:23:02] and now he's given us a promise that you
[1:23:05] can't even you don't even have room
[1:23:07] enough to receive it and I will say this
[1:23:09] anybody that's been faithful paying
[1:23:12] their tithes because we all started out
[1:23:13] at least I did I started out with
[1:23:15] nothing
[1:23:16] and I'll never forget as long as I live
[1:23:18] being in brother Johnson's Church
[1:23:22] one time they took up a little offering
[1:23:25] for me the only offering that I've ever
[1:23:28] accepted in my life
[1:23:30] because I didn't have nothing I didn't
[1:23:31] have a job I just came in I didn't
[1:23:34] understand what was going on I just knew
[1:23:36] the love of God was in this place God
[1:23:38] was in this place
[1:23:40] and I didn't have work I didn't have a
[1:23:42] job they took up I'll never forget it as
[1:23:44] long as I live
[1:23:46] but since that time in my life
[1:23:49] it has been a multitude of I cannot hold
[1:23:53] I can't I don't have room for this
[1:23:55] blessing
[1:23:56] and God had to provide so I'd have room
[1:23:59] and then I'd go on and then there would
[1:24:01] be more and I couldn't take it I
[1:24:02] couldn't take and there was just kept
[1:24:05] happening and multiplying and increasing
[1:24:08] to my life
[1:24:12] put God first
[1:24:13] you can't out give God
[1:24:16] doesn't get to a place and say okay you
[1:24:19] know what you've given so much now i
[1:24:21] that's enough I can't give you any more
[1:24:24] you keep giving and he'll keep giving
[1:24:28] we serve an endless God
[1:24:32] when you are positionally placed under
[1:24:35] the authority of the word then you have
[1:24:39] all the word on your side
[1:24:43] and that's what we want
[1:24:46] yeah I just this just came to me and I
[1:24:49] God helped me to get through everything
[1:24:50] I want to get through today
[1:24:53] but I remember
[1:24:58] one time
[1:24:59] I I believe brother Brandon had a dream
[1:25:02] or a vision or somebody did
[1:25:05] and
[1:25:07] I I believe it was brother Branham and
[1:25:10] there you know he was trying to take
[1:25:11] care of this one problem get it under
[1:25:13] his feet
[1:25:15] and he had a dream of this black mamba
[1:25:20] snake
[1:25:22] and for some reason you know it was the
[1:25:25] most deadliest snake and he just he just
[1:25:27] couldn't take care of it
[1:25:29] and God spoke to him and told him that
[1:25:33] he needed to be more sincere
[1:25:37] now think about what take takes care of
[1:25:39] this worst snake in the whole world was
[1:25:43] just more sincerity with God
[1:25:47] come under subjection to more of the
[1:25:49] word amen
[1:25:51] amen amen and God will take care of of
[1:25:53] whatever problem we might have
[1:25:57] all right
[1:25:59] when we tried to take our position over
[1:26:01] the devil and not come under subjection
[1:26:04] to the word
[1:26:05] we can't have perfect faith
[1:26:09] because we know we're not we're not
[1:26:11] under some ordinance we're not we're not
[1:26:13] we're not doing what God wants us to do
[1:26:16] it's like trying to lift ourselves up
[1:26:18] above the devil which we want but we're
[1:26:21] also doing it above God
[1:26:24] and the message be not afraid
[1:26:27] brother Adam says you can never serve
[1:26:30] God correctly
[1:26:31] till you get every little thing out of
[1:26:34] the way where you can stand free
[1:26:38] and I'll say it like this God knows the
[1:26:42] things that are standing in the way
[1:26:43] between us and him
[1:26:46] and I'm so grateful that God takes care
[1:26:49] of us
[1:26:52] I tell you he takes care of things
[1:26:55] that we can't even take care of
[1:27:00] because he wants to see us free
[1:27:05] if there's anything in your way in your
[1:27:09] way hindering you you just can't do it
[1:27:12] because that thing Rises up in front of
[1:27:15] you
[1:27:16] all the time see
[1:27:18] and so be honest truthful serve God with
[1:27:21] all your heart laying aside every sin
[1:27:24] that easily beset you that you might run
[1:27:26] with patience the race that's set before
[1:27:28] you look into the Altar and the finisher
[1:27:30] of our faith the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:35] God is looking for us to take our
[1:27:37] position
[1:27:38] of laying down our life
[1:27:41] [Music]
[1:27:43] lay down your life
[1:27:45] Jesus said in Luke 9 he says if any man
[1:27:49] come after me let him deny himself take
[1:27:51] up his cross and follow me notice the
[1:27:55] first thing in getting in a position
[1:27:56] with Christ is lay down your life
[1:28:01] lay down your will
[1:28:04] the second thing is obey the word
[1:28:09] pick up your cross whatever God tells
[1:28:12] you to do pick it up and carry it
[1:28:15] then and only then can we follow Christ
[1:28:19] in our position
[1:28:22] remember the man who was using the name
[1:28:25] of Jesus to profit his life and his
[1:28:28] reputation there in the book of Acts
[1:28:32] he was using the name of Jesus
[1:28:36] to cast out demons
[1:28:39] but he his mold of
[1:28:43] it was just about his reputation and for
[1:28:46] his own personal life
[1:28:49] and the demons spoke out and said Jesus
[1:28:52] I know
[1:28:53] Paul I know
[1:28:55] but who are you
[1:28:57] in other words I know the authority of
[1:29:00] Jesus
[1:29:02] and I tremble at it I know the authority
[1:29:05] of Paul who was submitted or Sub in
[1:29:08] submissioned to Jesus and I tremble at
[1:29:11] it but I don't recognize your Authority
[1:29:17] in other words you're not over me
[1:29:19] you're still underneath me I only bow
[1:29:22] before Jesus
[1:29:24] I'm going to tear your life apart
[1:29:30] he wasn't in position
[1:29:33] and we we must make sure that we're in
[1:29:36] our right position underneath the word
[1:29:39] of God
[1:29:40] so I say to the church humble yourself
[1:29:42] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[1:29:44] that he may exalt you
[1:29:47] above your problems
[1:29:49] in due time
[1:29:51] submit yourself therefore to God resist
[1:29:54] the devil and he will flee from you
[1:29:57] remember submit yourself first
[1:29:59] be clothed with humility for God
[1:30:03] resisteth the proud and giveth grace to
[1:30:05] the humble make sure you have power to
[1:30:08] lay down your life
[1:30:10] before you try taking power to rise it
[1:30:13] up against an enemy
[1:30:19] I mean if you've got a demon that's
[1:30:20] bothering you better tell him to get out
[1:30:24] amen you got a demon in your home you
[1:30:26] got a demon yeah yes
[1:30:29] use the name of Jesus but I'm telling
[1:30:32] you if you want to go anywhere with God
[1:30:34] you you want to make sure that your life
[1:30:36] is submitted to all the word
[1:30:39] and that you're you're looking God what
[1:30:42] would you have me to do you're working
[1:30:43] out your salvation with fear and tremble
[1:30:45] God what would you hand me to do just
[1:30:47] speak to me your word and be looking for
[1:30:50] it because if you're going to follow
[1:30:51] Jesus from afar you're not going to get
[1:30:53] very far
[1:30:57] when we come under subjection to God
[1:31:00] then God will give us the grace that we
[1:31:02] need he'll exalt us over our problems
[1:31:04] and we can get rid of the devil that's
[1:31:07] bothering us
[1:31:09] when we are positionally placed
[1:31:12] amen
[1:31:15] I believe when we're positioning placed
[1:31:17] we'll live for others
[1:31:20] we'll love others just like Christ loved
[1:31:22] amen
[1:31:24] amen and will be steadfast unmovable
[1:31:26] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[1:31:29] now that's positionally placed not any
[1:31:31] time we can get out of our place and
[1:31:33] think about it when you're out of your
[1:31:35] place you're out of the protection of
[1:31:38] the Holy Ghost
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:41] now look at the laodicea church age
[1:31:44] they were more at a position than any
[1:31:46] other Church
[1:31:50] she was the most deceived
[1:31:53] and she got out of her position
[1:31:57] because she was deceived and she she
[1:32:00] wanted she was looking for the easier
[1:32:02] path
[1:32:04] she thought she was in need of nothing
[1:32:06] she didn't know that she was miserable
[1:32:08] naked and blind
[1:32:10] she she had to get now here was what she
[1:32:13] had to do to get right she had to get
[1:32:16] under the anointing of God to see
[1:32:19] straight
[1:32:20] thank you
[1:32:21] in other words
[1:32:23] it's still your responsibility to get
[1:32:27] into the spirit
[1:32:29] and it's not a Feeling
[1:32:31] I'm not saying God won't bless us
[1:32:34] with a who following presence here
[1:32:38] but there's
[1:32:41] more that God expects out of us
[1:32:44] than to get blessed because of an
[1:32:46] atmosphere
[1:32:49] she had to repent to get into the right
[1:32:52] position with Christ
[1:32:55] be zelious and repent she needed deity
[1:32:59] and that was the only thing that can
[1:33:01] overcome the devil amen
[1:33:05] Christ is the only thing that can over
[1:33:08] and when we recognize didn't didn't
[1:33:10] isn't there some quote and maybe Brother
[1:33:13] Bruce knows this or brother Ferguson
[1:33:17] but when the the bride knows who she is
[1:33:23] the Rapture will take place
[1:33:26] we got to know our position
[1:33:31] all right
[1:33:33] in the message Jesus Christ the same
[1:33:36] yesterday today and forever
[1:33:39] brother Brian says and let me say this
[1:33:41] now that the word of God will defeat the
[1:33:44] Devil anywhere anytime or any place amen
[1:33:47] amen he will defeat the Devil
[1:33:51] and he said the right mental attitude
[1:33:52] towards any Divine promise of God will
[1:33:54] bring it to pass amen
[1:33:56] amen so if you can look at it the way
[1:33:58] God wrote it and accept it in your heart
[1:34:02] God will make the word become life
[1:34:14] hmm
[1:34:15] you know something just came to me and
[1:34:18] if I could I just want to go there I
[1:34:21] think it's first John
[1:34:25] first John
[1:34:32] okay
[1:34:35] um
[1:34:39] and and
[1:34:48] I don't know and I'm so sorry I don't
[1:34:51] know where it is but the scripture talks
[1:34:52] about that God is greater
[1:34:56] than our conscience
[1:34:59] he is able to speak to us
[1:35:02] whatever is not in its place
[1:35:05] so in order for me to have the right
[1:35:07] mental attitude I've got to be concerned
[1:35:09] about the things that God wants me to
[1:35:11] take care of remember we're in a
[1:35:14] relationship with Christ this is all
[1:35:16] about a relationship this is not about
[1:35:18] us of how we can attain to be super
[1:35:21] duper full of Faith just you know
[1:35:24] constantly have this great ability no
[1:35:28] we're just human beings
[1:35:30] Sons and Daughters of God that are
[1:35:33] building a relationship with Christ
[1:35:35] putting on character getting ready for
[1:35:37] the Rapture so in this process of us
[1:35:41] manifesting the word there's things that
[1:35:44] God wants us to come under subjection to
[1:35:46] and so if they're like like I remember a
[1:35:49] time in my life that I was listening to
[1:35:52] worldly music I had long hair
[1:35:56] I mean I I you you name it I was in the
[1:36:01] world
[1:36:03] and when God began to deal with me with
[1:36:05] those things he was not just pulling me
[1:36:08] out of the world but he was he was
[1:36:11] positionally placing me
[1:36:13] I couldn't remain in that condition and
[1:36:17] just say well I've been baptized
[1:36:19] I'm a Christian now
[1:36:21] and so so God is continuously
[1:36:25] bringing us more into position
[1:36:28] in the message convinced and concerned
[1:36:31] we're wrapping it up here he said that's
[1:36:33] right
[1:36:34] and God
[1:36:36] and the god that could defeat the Devil
[1:36:38] in my life Brother Brad I'm saying
[1:36:41] and pour into me the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:43] Ghost
[1:36:45] can slay that uncircumcised devil out
[1:36:48] there
[1:36:49] that's trying to defy the armies of the
[1:36:51] Living God
[1:36:53] that's one way to help somebody
[1:36:57] is
[1:36:58] get the devil out of your life
[1:37:01] amen let's Stand Together
[1:37:04] if you all want the benefits of Christ
[1:37:06] Place yourself underneath all of his
[1:37:10] word
[1:37:11] place your problems under his feet
[1:37:16] Place yourself underneath his word when
[1:37:20] we're positioning placed in the word
[1:37:22] then we can stand on top of our problems
[1:37:25] I remember a story I used to tell lots
[1:37:27] of stories and I hardly don't tell them
[1:37:29] anymore and I'm sorry about that but
[1:37:31] there was a story one time about this
[1:37:34] donkey
[1:37:35] and this donkey he was just
[1:37:38] kind of old
[1:37:40] and he wasn't very useful much anymore
[1:37:44] but he was still a donkey he was still
[1:37:46] alive but he got tripped up and he fell
[1:37:49] into this well it was kind of a deep
[1:37:51] well
[1:37:53] and when the owner of the donkeys went
[1:37:56] out there
[1:37:57] because he heard this yapping and
[1:37:59] yelling and oinking and whatever they do
[1:38:02] whatever sound they make from the bottom
[1:38:06] of that well coming up he recognized
[1:38:09] that his donkey was down there and
[1:38:11] instead of trying to help the donkey get
[1:38:13] out because he'd been faithful to him
[1:38:15] all those years
[1:38:17] he just thought well you know he's just
[1:38:20] no use to us anymore
[1:38:22] we mouths were just bury him there
[1:38:26] and so this man went back to his barn he
[1:38:28] got the shovel out and he's just started
[1:38:30] putting shovel shoveling the dirt into
[1:38:34] the well to cover up the Donkey
[1:38:37] and this donkey had a choice at that
[1:38:40] moment
[1:38:42] is he going to let these problems
[1:38:45] bury him
[1:38:49] or is he going to have a right mental
[1:38:51] attitude
[1:38:54] is he going to observe these line
[1:38:57] vanities and forsake his own Mercy
[1:39:00] but you know what he did with each
[1:39:03] shovelful that went down inside of that
[1:39:07] well and hit his back he just shook it
[1:39:10] off
[1:39:11] and he stood on top
[1:39:14] and that guy who his owner who really
[1:39:18] just didn't care about him anymore
[1:39:19] thought he was going to bury him
[1:39:22] was surprised that eventually he started
[1:39:24] rising up and went out of the well and
[1:39:27] just said thank you
[1:39:29] and I'll tell you it doesn't matter if
[1:39:31] anybody's not helping you or not
[1:39:33] it's you and God that's a majority and
[1:39:35] if you just have the right attitude God
[1:39:38] will see you through
[1:39:41] it seems like often
[1:39:43] our trials are long and stretched out
[1:39:47] but you just got to keep shaking things
[1:39:49] off
[1:39:50] keep keep yourself in a position
[1:39:54] that God can use you and he will use you
[1:39:58] amen shake off discouragement shake off
[1:40:01] disappointment
[1:40:03] shake off everything that the devil
[1:40:06] throws at you
[1:40:07] amen let's say I know the Lord will make
[1:40:10] a way for me
[1:40:15] I know the Lord will make a way for me
[1:40:26] I know the Lord will make a way for me
[1:40:35] if I live a holy life shun the wrong and
[1:40:42] do the right I know the Lord will make a
[1:40:47] way
[1:40:49] amen let's sing that again
[1:40:52] I know the Lord will make a way for me
[1:41:00] know the Lord will make a way
[1:41:05] amen get in position now
[1:41:08] if I live a holy light
[1:41:12] shunned the wrong and do the right I
[1:41:17] know the Lord will make a way for me
[1:41:24] I know the Lord will make a way for me
[1:41:30] I'm counting on it I know the Lord
[1:41:34] Will Make A Way
[1:41:36] for
[1:41:38] we
[1:41:40] if I live a holy life
[1:41:48] know the Lord make a way for me I know
[1:41:53] the Lord has placed his hand on me I
[1:41:57] know the Lord
[1:41:58] Lord's laid his hand on me
[1:42:04] I know the lord has laid his hand on me
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:19] I know the Lord is laid his hand on me
[1:42:27] I know the Lord is coming back
[1:42:31] for me
[1:42:35] I know the Lord
[1:42:39] for me
[1:42:42] if I spend my life in prayer I will meet
[1:42:48] him in the air I know the Lord is coming
[1:42:53] back for me
[1:42:59] do you believe that with all your heart
[1:43:03] amen
