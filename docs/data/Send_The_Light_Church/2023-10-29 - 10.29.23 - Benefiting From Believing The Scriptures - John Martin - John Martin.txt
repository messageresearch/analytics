name amen amen if you ever feel like you're being swallowed up his name is a high tower the name of Jesus well praise the Lord everyone I I heard it's a kind of like a pastor appreciating day so I just want to say I appreciate every single one of you thank you for for putting up with me uh I'm counting on your prayers to make it and you're and you're you're counting on the ministry to make it and uh together we're going to make it amen amen I do appreciate each and every one of you this morning I want to say that this scripture uh you know there's a lot of people here and I want to single one person out today because I believe the service is for this person and that person is you it's for every one of you and I want you to believe it that way amen turn with me if you would to the book of second Timothy second Timothy so good to see brother Johnson amen we've been praying for you brother Johnson amen amen God give you strength day by day and also sister Johnson we lifted her up this morning in prayer as well amen amen we're going to read a a few scriptures here and then we're going to have a word of Prayer amen 2 Timothy Chapter 2 and just one verse there verse 15 study to show thyself approved a Workman that needeth not be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth and I want us to focus on rightly dividing the word of Truth amen all right second Timothy chapter 3 2 Timothy chapter 3 starting with verse number 12 y all that will live God in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of known of whom thou has learned them and that from a child thou has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus now all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works amen amen let's look to the author in a word of prayer our heavenly father Lord we thank you that you've given us health and strength to be here in the house of the Lord today father as we stand here you know the how needy we are all the things that are going on in our lives the things that are going on in our our minds the things that are going on in our our families and Lord we don't have to look very far to to see that we need you we need you Lord Lord amen and and this time Lord that we've come to assemble ourselves here together we believe in your scriptures we believe you've inspired them and they're here for us to receive that inspiration for our lives and the find help that we have need of Lord and I just pray that you would bless this service to the hearts of your people today Lord let them hear personally from you Lord you are the great Pastor you are the great Shepherd and we appreciate you today Lord thank you for watching over this little flock for keeping us Lord and Lord we we trust that you'll take us on to to that Rapture morning Father that there' not be one left behind granted Heavenly Father we love you we thank you for these things now open the word these scriptures to US Open the bread of life and we'll give you the praise for it in Jesus precious name amen amen God bless you you may be seated remember hearing the prophet saying that uh breaking the bread of life is the revelation of Jesus Christ amen we want to talk about uh continuing in the scriptures turning to the scriptures and for a title benefiting from believing the scriptures we know the scriptures don't work if you don't apply Faith they don't work so it's it's important that we bring to the scriptures our faith in them and especially this world that we're living in it's getting worse isn't it you can't hardly pick up the news without hearing more bad news it just seems like how is enlarged itself the lid has popped off and and evil is just rampant everywhere we're living in the most Godless age of all of history and the spirit of hate is it's like a fog going everywhere hate is just everywhere it it I it doesn't matter what's uh going on in Israel and in Gaza we we see it just spreading here and spreading all over the world nowadays if you if you don't accept somebody in their sin if you don't accept their sin in other words they think it's okay they're happy with it but if you don't accept it like they accept it then they hate you for it the spirit of hate is on a rise people hate the police why why they they got a preconceived idea about them that is the truth people hate the Jews they hate Ukraine they hate the Americans they hate the Mexicans Russians Palestinians why is there's so much hatred cuz people have preconceived ideas about everybody UK has recorded a 10year high records of hate crimes hate crimes around the world are on a rise hate crimes have reached an all-time high in the US last year according to the FBI so there's just chaos everywhere there's no rest there's just hate amen people are missing the peace of God that's right I just I want to read here because for us it's important that we don't get caught up in that because the Bible says that that there's such an anxiety going to come upon the world that it's if we're not careful it will catch us unawares Jesus said so we know what's going to happen and he's warned us so we need help for our lives and I believe it's contained in these scriptures and it's for each one of us to find that personally when we open the scriptures and we read them verse one of Hebrews chapter 4 I just want to read two verses here let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it it just seems the whole world's in chaos and they're they just they don't know what to do they just can't have peace they can't have rest they got to be doing something and it's causing so much trouble am For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it and so this today this is I'm not asking you the question do you believe the scriptures do you believe the word do you believe the message do you believe William brand what I'm really asking you has you taken the word into your life because that's the type of belief that brings about the results that we're needing in our lives God may not take our trials away like he wants us to but the answer is in the word yes it and we got to put our faith that God will speak to us through his word now we've read about the things some of the things that are happening in the world but you know too many churchgoing people have brought the Same Spirit of hate into the church I'll say whatever spirit that you live with in your home is the same spirit that you bring with you to the church if you have a selfish Spirit at home you'll have a selfish Spirit here if you have a an angry Spirit at home you have an angry Spirit here if you have a proud Spirit at home you'll bring that same Spirit here you cannot turn it off like a light switch if you're arrogant at home you're arrogant here if you're hateful at home then you're hateful here you may not try to show it but it's there Jesus said and in Matthew 24 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and hate one another so we see this this spirit is is not going away right it's prophesied to be here we just don't want to be a part of that are you with me Luke chapter 6 verse 22 says blessed are you how many wants to be blessed this morning amen blessed are you when men shall hate you you're actually blessed when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake but Jesus said rejoice in that day and leap for joy amen for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did they their fathers unto the prophets I would rather be filled with God and be hated all day long than to be separated from hate and be missing God you understand what I'm saying why avoid when alls we need to do is get filled he'll take care of it am now these two seeds the seeds of the world and the seeds of God they grow simultaneously together we see the world waxing worse and worse and hating deceiving and being deceived but the Bible tells us that there's perilous times for the church that men and women in the church will actually be in love with themselves amen right inside the church we see people boasting heady high-minded proud traitors truth Breakers Unfaithful unth thankful and even despisers of those who are good false accusers Fierce and without self-control that's what incontinent means right inside the church now they're just little Spirits right but the thing is they shouldn't be here somehow the enemy gets us to think that we are Justified because of what somebody said somebody did to us growing yeah growing they're getting worse and worse amen deceiving and being deceived yes they're ever learning but never able to come to the manifestation of the word that's right amen they feel they're growing in their head but their life is missing love joy peace longsuffering generous meanness Temperance we need the manifestation of the truth so I want to say this this message the reason we want to get into the word is for one reason we need to manifest the word am why why use the word just for your benefit if there's no love there to live out what Jesus wants us to do it's a love affair Believers are carrying a form of godliness but they're they're lacking the power to live the life of Christ and what did Paul tell us to do about this Spirit what did he tell us to do he turn he told us to turn away from that Spirit to turn away from it don't don't have a fellowship with that spirit because that spirit will teach you it's just it's okay if you just have a form it doesn't provoke you to Good Works the scriptures are given to us that we may be fully furnished unto all good works but a form of godliness it just helps us to settle down into a a form no life in it it in other words that that piano can't meet any needs until somebody's behind it using it in a life that's missing the the Holy Ghost is like that piano it can't be used to meet the need unless the Life of Christ is in that human being meeting the needs amen so we understand we got to stay away from the head knowledge you know that just Puffs you up I mean we've all seen it amen but we're looking for the life Jesus said in Matthew Chapter 13 Verse 30 if you want to write it down let both grow together how about both these seeds let both grow together to the Harvest and in the time of the Harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat unto my barn so there's a growing process happening but praise God the seed of God is growing inside of us growth is always taking place it's always taking place I've often said there's no Switzerland there's the when it comes to God there's no neutrality Jesus said in Luke 16 no servant can serve two masters for either will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and serve yourself it's one the other am there's no room for complacency with the believer there's no room for mediocracy no room for taking it easy no room for just coming in and making it to church I'm sorry brother Stan he just comes in and sits down and that comes out I you need to know that was not spoken withstanding my thoughts or my mind but he I did see him in my eyes so I need to make that right but you know we've all just you know I'm so filled with problems I'm just you know going to come in church I'm gonna plop in here it's dangerous the people who are stuck in Leo DEA are waxing worse and worse Jesus told us they're blind they're deceived and they're and they're they're deceiving others I mean you know how it is when somebody's living the life and you're not how that makes you feel you had that tendency of wanting to bring them down right because you're convicted they're praying they're on fire people hear the word and they don't follow they're just growing in deception that's what the scriptures teach us James says but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourself so to come into church hear the word and not go out with a burning desire to live it you've just come in and sat yourself for a greater deception in your life and don't really realize it wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word amen which is able to save your soul so I'll say today when the word is being preached find a place of it in your life graft it in leave here with it grafted in it's a part of you because that's the only way you're going to be benefited you've got to take it you know sometimes we come here with preconceived ideas this is what I need this is what I want and and and then if we don't hear it we don't feel God was there I mean if you want to just be honest it would be a good time to say amen that's the truth brother John it is and the thing is it's you don't got to look hard to see that Spirit you don't you ought to rejoice in the word the the the problem is the spirit and the attitude isn't right we God could be right there sitting there right next you and you wouldn't even know it God may not back me up but he'll back the word up as long as we stay with the word we should all be able to rejoice say Amen complacency is not neutral complacency is moving away from God so slow that you can't see it you know brother BR talked about take your ores out of the water it you know when you take your ores okay you're you're fighting against the current of the world that's trying to take you this way I'm not saying go to the bars I'm not saying stay home watch TV instead of going to church what I am saying is just take the ores out of the water just like be neutral and you'll slowly but surely get away from God it's a slow withdrawing from God's responsibility that he's given to you brother B said in a message a man running from the presence of the Lord now listen to this he says you have got a responsibility everybody has and you may face up to these things and when you see then in this day now when the word of God has made these promises of things and we see them happening now then we've got a responsibility to either face up to it or to get away from it he says you can't stay neutral amen you've got to do something about it some move has got to be made brother brandom said he says you can't come in that church door and go out the same person you came in you're either further away or you're closer to God every time you come in now to me that puts the fear of God in Me that quote that helps me see the reality because it don't matter what I think it don't matter what I feel it matters what the word is so am I a better person when I leave church I'll tell you if you are not drawn closer if you don't feel like I'm leaving church today and I'm going to give more of my life to God I'm going to tell you you're probably drifted back and you don't even realize it I'm sure I'm sure the devil is never going to come to you and tell you yeah you're a bad bad shape after that service he's not going to do that he'll come and he'll say you know what that was for somebody else there no God didn't speak to you know God didn't speak to me he's very deceptive Hebrews 10 says but if any man draw back my soul has no pleasure in him God has no pleasure in the man who takes his ores or the woman that takes her oares out of the water amen you got to keep fighting but we are not of them praise God we are not of them who draw back under predition but of them that believe what to the saving of the Soul right you know how how does the devil get so many people just to like stop quit take their ores how does he do that he does that by simply giving him his Revelation that they're saved they're saved no matter what they don't need to they don't need to walk in further truth they don't need to do this they don't need to do they're already saved I tell you that is not a revelation from the Holy Ghost the H the Revelation from the Holy Ghost is we got to keep going we're saved we got to get away from this world we live by faith what does that mean we live by manifesting the word more and more every day to the believer that's the most important thing now there's a person caught in Le to see it they're hardly even thinking about it yeah this world is about survival it's going down the tubes Jesus said in John 15 ver8 if you want to write this down John 158 herein is my father glor IFI how many wants to glorify the father that you bear much fruit that's the way it happens bear the fruit so if you go to the store and you buy fruit you're going to come home and you're going to have pears and apples and bananas and tangerines and grapes there's going to be an Evidence the evidence of God being glorified in your life is the fruit of the Holy Ghost amen not by Church attendance not by saying I'm in the messenger this is what I believe there's no glory in that the fruit is what glorifies the father because if you don't have any fruit you know what it is it's a form it's just a form verse 16 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you what for and I've ordained you that you should go and and bring forth fruit I got to keep putting my ores in the water and that your fruit it needs to remain that whatsoever you ask of the father in my name he will give it to you do you like that promise isn't that a precious promise you know what brother Braham said in the message the absolute he says if you are Gods you are Gods you are filled with God you have word in you you will never ask anything out of his will so this thought process of just I'm G to ask God whatever I want to I'm gonna have it I'm that is not really dividing the word of Truth praise the Lord I believe we need more of a humble spirit amen a spirit of I could be wrong I'm wrong in the way that I view things the way that I'm looking at things I think if we spent more time doing that things would work out it opens the door to give God a chance see the fear of the Lord is the beginning of all wisdom Proverbs 16:5 says everyone that is proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord though hand look at this though hand join in hand he shall not be unpunished in other words you might be able to find somebody that agrees with you right you may be able to find 10 people that agree with you but if it's wrong it'll still be wrong by Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged yes I I love brother brother Bruce was just sharing about it how thankful he is that God has taken his iniquity away in his Mercy I tell you if it wasn't for the grace of God if it wasn't for the blood of God none of us would be here but now after we receive that blood After we receive that Grace God has an expectation of us to to wrap his truth and his Mercy around our lives and to walk in in the light of it and today we ought to know more about God than we did a year ago that means we ought to be walking more in it by mercing truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the Lord men what do they do they depart from Evil yes that's what the fear of the Lord does they depart they don't say well yeah but I know I know I'm getting out of here they depart they depart from unbelief they depart from just saying it's good enough to to just think no I've got to live the word now just as the lukewarm believer is growing away from the reality of God the bride is growing in getting wiser because they're fearing God more they're growing into the manifestation of the word now see they're both growing in different directions amen now brother brandham well and the Lord Jesus said in the last days those two Spirits would be so close how how can they be so close yet they're so different well this is how because they're both able to preach the same word they're able to quote the same scripture they're able to say I believe the same thing but only one of them is living it right only one of them is living it you've got to take the word in your heart it's there for our instruction for our Repro for our correction that we may be perfect entire and then wanting nothing a man that's in the image of Jesus Christ that's what he's called us to be and it's these scriptures that can do it for our homes for our lives we've got to start taking the word more serious Paul told Timothy the holy scriptures are able to make thee wise unto salvation there were 10 versions five foolish five wise they were growing simultaneously many of the Believers are wise enough to receive salvation I want you to catch this but they're not wise enough to receive salvation from tribulation they're not wise enough to receive salvation from their situations they're not wise enough to receive salvation from this particular problem they have with somebody yes sir are you understanding where I'm coming from but the word of God is Not lacking for our situations and we shouldn't be just satisfied with salvation if you love God love his word love to want to manifest the fruit in this hour that he's called us to when everybody's growing worse and worse and more evil don't compare yourself with them compare yourself with the word and live that word if you're living the life and there's nothing more for you to do praise the Lord I tip my hat to you I just say come and help me live the life for me help me wash my feet help me I'm a brother in need that's part of the life that's part of the life too many have remained in foolish thinking that they have enough to make the Rapture I can't I I I I believe the scripture the scripture that he will take us through that's the scripture but I don't see Paul ever having the attitude I've made it he's always had the attitude I'm pressing towards yeah I got a part to play as long as I got breath I need to press into that here's just a thought I threw this in here for all of our foolish thinking and I'm guilty of it if God gives us another day to live what are we going to do at that day so if God gives you one more day to live what would you do at that day how would you think we all we all believe we're going to get up and go to work and service is going to be over tomorrow and and we're just going to go on doing our own thing but if God if you knew you only had one day to live would you do the same thing thank you thank you how about if you had two days okay five days two weeks that's all you get and would you do the same thing tomorrow if you knew you only had two weeks so let me ask ask you a question what day does it turn how many days do you need before you're going to do right what you what you plan on doing tomorrow I just I just want us to Lord teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom now the believer's resource for growth is these scriptures this is all we got to go by this is all I want you to ever go by this is the one book I'm so glad God sent a prophet to tell us what that book meant to rightly divide it but you understand what I'm saying if you with I don't care how un I don't care how young you are how how much knowledge you're lacking and I don't really care how smart you are or how much you do know if you could just have a sincere heart God I am totally lost without you I need direction for my life you go to this book and you say God help me that's the heart he's listening to and that's all you need you don't even got to be a good reader somehow God will take the few scriptures that you look at and he'll start directing you to the right place that you need to be I'm not saying that God is just going to give you one scripture and all your problems are going to be solved but he'll take that one scripture and he'll start inspire in you because all the word of God is inspired and he'll inspire you and he'll ordain your footsteps and he'll lead you to walk where he wants you to go next and you know what he's going to do you're going to come right back to the word and you're going to read another scripture and he's that scripture is going to be inspired to you and this is how God leads his bride not the world the world's leaning to their own understanding but not the bride he's a present help in a time of trouble these scriptures tells us that he's a present help in a time of trouble so what do we got to do believe it amen believe it not say well he's got to get me out of trouble and then I'll praise God for him no believe it I don't know how he's going to do it the Bible has all the equipment that we need for our emergencies whatever the emergency is whatever the problem is it's here well brother John I'm having this I just don't know I don't know where to slow down trust the scriptures you're you've got to put God first when you put the word first you're putting God first right you got to have confidence in God in you amen God has not called us has not called us to make a way to have the Rapture God has not called us to figure out a plan hey let all the Bride come together and they're going to just make a plan and this is how the Rapture is going to happen no God's got all that handled alls we have to do is start dressing ourselves with the word be become faithful to the word not be satisfied with I'm just saved come on you know I I'll say this God hates the person sitting in your seat God also loves the person sitting in your seat there's two people sitting in your seat one is enity with God and one is the seed of God you you need to learn to hate the person in your seat like God does you understand you need if because if you love that person you'll never bring him under subjection our lives need direction the Bible is a lamp it's a lamp it gives us light for our feet a light for our path it's it's a it's a road map it's a compass it it it shows us how to get where we need to get to and you know sometimes we just got to make the right first step the right first step you know brother Braham talked about having three lights lined up when you're coming to the arbor you're just trying to find the will of God and there's three lights that got to line up and I'm just thinking to myself if we take the word of God I'll start with prayer if you you get that first light prayer you read the word of God and make sure that that last Light you have humbled yourself to the word of God because a humble and contrite spirit I'll not desp look just take the first step in that aspect you know our problems get so big so mighty so so many so compounded that we don't think there's an answer in the word of God how does that how does that make God feel is there anything too hard for our god look there may not be anything in this Bible that says you know trusted tool needs to do this and do that and and it may not say that but I believe it can inspire me to go to work and do that I believe that with all my heart because God cares about each of us he cares about our situation he cares about where we're at what we're dealing with the thing is a lot of us have lost hope in the scriptures I'm just being honest with you these scriptures need to be inspired to us amen God wrote them with inspiration and they need to be inspired to us we just we lean to our own understanding we try to figure things out in our way we try to handle things our way we try to make priorities our way I'm thankful when we can make it to church but don't you think God would be so much happier if we come here with a hunger and a thirst don't you think that can you can you imagine your kids coming up the table ready to eat dinner hey can I pick on you boys for a second imagine coming up to the table and you just had attitud I don't really care about being here I just know I have to be I'm going to get a whipping um dad's going to call me out food's placed in front of you and it's I don't want this now here's the thing our Spirits speak every time we come into the service every time we get up at the table we show whether we're thankful or we show that we're unth thankful we show what Spirit we have and so I'm saying these Spirits at home they come into the church it is your job and your job and your job to make this church better to make the atmosphere a place that God wants to come and dwell amongst us don't put it off on somebody else you know what I love about today I I saw everybody everybody's like working really hard and with bringing your food and decorating and and cleaning and doing all the things to make today happen that's the functioning of of the body so beautiful so beautiful now that's how we need to be spiritually come together function do something for somebody help somebody get in the prayer room with a burden for somebody grab somebody pray with them it's you know in the denominations it's just about fellowship with one another but to the bride it's about fellowship with Christ and it's Christ in you the hope of glory that we're having fellowship with help us Lord help us Lord you know what happens when we lean to our own understanding we get in trouble thank god he's a present help in a time of trouble but it if if when we lean to our own understanding if it gets us in trouble what do we need to do humble oursel and not lean to what we think there's the key lean to the word acknowledge the Lord in all your ways lean not to your own understanding and depart from Evil well what's evil evil is my will my understanding is evil it'll get me in more trouble it has has gotten me in more trouble I've repented for my understanding I've never repented for God's understanding my repentance has always been because I lean to my understanding whatever we need we can find it in the word peace Comfort if we need joy we can find it in the word there's there's a there's a word for that I I if we need strength we can find it in there amen if we need uh God to take care of a problem he can direct us what to do from that word to for that problem to be taken care of I believe that with all my heart now he may allow a problem to remain there for a season but he will give you what you need to get through that the right way the right mental attitude he'll give you peace and comfort we we don't control God we don't control his will adversity don't mean we're out of the will of the Lord having it made On the Sunny Side of Florida doesn't mean everything is good doesn't mean we're in the will of God but I will say this God is able to speak to [Music] us he's able to speak speak to us he's able to make all grace abound and he's able to get our attention the thing is let him have his ways have a real meeting with God get serious more serious with God now the word of God is our Armory I mean Gaza or Israel they they're we got the allies of America over there and I don't know it might be eight warships over there I don't know how many there are over there last I counted there was like eight of of them and there's an Armory they're helping Israel we have an Armory it contains weapons for offense and for defense now you need offense when you're going against the devil now you need the weapons of Defense when you're going against a brother who has the enemy working through him come on are you with me we're set for the defense of the Gospel but you don't use your offense on people come on you use the defense of the word I love this word 2 Corinthians 10:4 read it with Me 2 Corinthians 10:4 for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but they're Mighty through God to the Ping down to of strongholds where's the greatest stronghold that happens to us in our minds sometimes we just wish the devil would leave us alone that's when you go on the offense casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the word of God and bring it into captivity every thought what what what what what to The Obedience if we don't obey the word it this word will not profit you God is looking for one thing in my life obedience he don't need my smarts he don't need anything about me just obey him having in a Readiness to Revenge all disob obedience when your obedience is fulfilled this scripture helps me to understand that I must the only way I'm going to bring forth fruit is by obey the word okay you know you brother Mark's always sitting there so I always want to just grab somebody let's just say someone hits Us in the face well the first reaction why did you do that that wasn't right I didn't deserve that well we could have a lot of thoughts along those lines and we through our own understanding we would be right with those thoughts but where's the fruit where's the fruit what does the word say I should do where's The Obedience what obedience do I have to fulfill huh come on I here turn the cheek now turn the cheek I've obeyed the word now I'm bearing the fruit of love you understand what I'm saying I don't have to go there and straighten the person out why they hit me come on I love this word I if you bring yourself under obedience to the word you will glorify the Father in Heaven 2 Samuel chapter 22 says as God as for God his way is perfect the word of the Lord is tried he is a buckler to all them that trust him now I'll tell you to go ahead and turn your cheek what are you doing you're having trust God yes if you don't turn your cheek you're trusting in yourself I'm GNA back away I'm not going to let them do that anymore to me see the seeds are growing the more we can take a look at our life and say where you've come from in the last month the last two months the last six month months the more you can start comparing yourself with the word that's wisdom the more you compare yourself with somebody that's out in the world not even coming to the church you're in trouble amen all right Ephesians chapter 6 vers 11 I promise to go faster if you if you get into the word more all right Ephesians 6:1 put on the whole armor of God this is the whole word of God put on this whole armor right here that ye may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not with one another right amen we don't wrestle with our neighbor we don't wrestle with our government amen we don't wrestle with anything that's flesh and blood but we wrestle against principalities against Powers against the rulers of this a world the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand are we living in the evil day the Bible is telling me I cannot leave out part of the word in this day this is the only day that I cannot leave out all the word we're not living in justification we're not living in sanctification we're not living in Wesley's age we're living in the bright age we need the whole armor of God we have to have it we have to have a love to want to live this word and we need the humility I could be wrong maybe I'm not doing maybe I'm not putting enough effort maybe I'm not trying maybe I'm not praying maybe I'm not reading maybe I'm not getting into it like I should we need to have that or else it won't happen it won't work for us stand therefore having your La Girt about with truth truth not he hit me the truth I've turned my cheek amen you see what I'm saying not the truth he did me wrong she did me wrong but the truth that I love them even though they did me wrong amen that's the truth amen and having the breast rate of righteousness amen we need to do right with everything every day and our feet Shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace you know what that means to me that whatever you set out to do whoever you set out to talk to whatever you set out to do make sure your intentions are peaceful yes if your intentions are wrong it ain't it ain't going to work you've got to put those shoes on amen Above All Things The Shield take Above All Things taking the shield of Faith wherewith you may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked am wow that means my God is able to take me through yes just put that that Shield up amen no matter what you feel no matter what the devil says no matter what your emotions are saying put that Shield up because that Shield is able to stop the darts from penetrating and making a negative difference in your life you have to believe the word all right and take the helmet of salvation the helmet of salvation not the helmet of yeah God saved me back at Calvary or God saved me when I got baptized 5 years ago but this day is the day of salvation I'm walking in the light of today the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God and I love that scripture because the you know there is no difference no difference between the Holy Ghost and this word there is a difference difference between quoting the word and not living the word and the word of God can never help us if we just quote it if we just had knowledge know it but in fact brother Brandon makes these statements that you could spend years in a seminary learning the Bible quoting the Bible have the knowledge of the Bible and be further away from God God than when you started because at the beginning you had a chance and that's why I'm saying all you need to do is open that book with a sincere desire God I need you and I need I believe in you it's between me and you God you are my savior these scriptures can make me wise unto salvation God is able to direct our paths I believe that if we need healing the word of God is our medicine the Bible says by his we are healed not only we are healed we were healed it was it's already done if we got hurt we got pain we got sorrow the word of God is a has a remedy for us yes whatever we need just turn to the scriptures for what for inspiration that's why you're turning to the scriptures for inspiration what to do you ever try to put something together together and you're having a hard time and you just instructions didn't work or they didn't come with it I mean we're I'm putting these chandeliers together and it had like thousands of pieces and I never knew it had so many pieces and it didn't even had the lick bit of instructions on it not one and I'll tell you I needed inspiration I still need it I'm in the middle of it all scripture is given by the inspiration of God and it is profitable for our lives for everything that's going on in our life yes our Doctrine so we know how to live what to live by but it knows how to if we're wrong it knows how to correct us get us on the right path get us looking at the thing the right way you know man did not have anything to do with this Bible that's right right no inspiration came from man second Peter 1: 19 says we have also a more sure word of Prophecy where un until we do well if oh no I'm sorry where unto you do well that you take heed right as unto a light that shineth in a dark place and until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your heart now this is what I'm saying every one of us got situations every one of us got situations in our life that we desire the light of God's word to help us with Lord what do I do with this what do I do with that how do I help this relationship with my my my wife my husband my daughter my son my father my mother my neighbor the my teacher how do I help how do I how do I get inspired shine some light on my situation lord it's just it's so dark where I'm at the word of God can Shine for You amen I personally cannot tell you what to turn to I can't tell you what book to read I can't give you the scripture I'm sorry but I believe more in God that your heart being turned towards him he can lead you to what scripture because we serve a God that loves you we serve a God that wants to help you that's right and it's the scriptures are inspired to do that that's why God wrote them God wrote them for our help to help us the problem is we're not spending enough time looking to the only source that can give us help we don't need to look to one another we don't look we don't even need to look to the church I would I would get more respect for the word being preached though when it's happening for you personally you understand in other words when you come to the house of God and you hear that word being preached if there's nobody in the church you believe that word's for you and God can use that word to help you if you have the the belief for that help verse 20 knowing this verse that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation in other words don't tell me what you think it means just live it just manifest it just manifest it for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so God moved men to pen this yes in other words God may not even gave them understanding but he wrote it and it was a love letter to you and what are we doing with our time at home how often do we pick up this word and say God I need inspiration from above this word is here to help us if we leave it go A pardons without a a pardon not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon I believe God has given us the answer for all of our lives for all of our situations it's contained in that word I believe it with all my heart I will preach it with all my heart and we're we're we're allowing some other means to help us I want to look to the Lord we need to get the scriptures living through our bodies it's not about knowing it it's about living it right and I I know I understand in our personal lives we may not be to see our actual name the place that we live the problems going on exactly that we're enduring right here in the scripture but I believe as we read the Scripture it will inspire us about our situation amen and that's I believe it is when we come to church and we hear the word of God you know we we love it when somebody says oh yeah you know I just felt so inspired I just prayed this shirt in prayer and it was exactly what I needed at that me and I'm that's wonderful that's wonderful that God God can do anything he can certainly do that but shouldn't we give more respect to the word of God that the word can do that I want us to put our faith in this word not in a man not in me preaching the word that is being preach no matter who stand behinds the bullpit now if you focus your life more in believing the word for yourself personally it will work but if you don't it won't work it can't be intellectual you can't just agree with the word you can't just say Amen to the word I appreciate Brother Bruce and all the amens I I miss the amens because some people hardly say amen and brother Bram said the Holy Ghost says Amen to every word of God but you know it's not just saying amen it's your life says amen your life is saying amen so be it my life is Amen in it we need to submit to the word we need we need to let the word have pre preeminence in our life so where do I start what do I do brother John just pick up the word get serious with God and just say God show me let it start with that but brother John it just it doesn't seem like it has anything to do with my situation it doesn't matter you know we want answers for our lives but you know God wants a relationship if you just open the Bible and you sayl show me what you want me to do you're you're working on the relationship part who how do you feel when somebody just ask you to do something all the time but they're they're never grateful you feel used right God God doesn't want to feel used he wants to be loved and adorned all right you got a few more minutes how much time do I get this is like I got one going like this I got one going like this and you know which one's which right John 15 says abide in me Jesus said abide in me and I in you he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for you could do nothing without me that's right the you ever have the knowledge of the scripture but you couldn't live it for whatever reason you were too angry you you couldn't give a soft answer at that moment but when he's inside of you there's like it's it's effortless right because it's it's no longer you trying to do it it's it's him in you Jesus said in John five he said and ye have not his word abiding in you and ye have not his word abiding now he now these Pharisees they knew the word but he's still saying you know you don't have the word abiding in you so we're talking about manifestation for whom you have sent him ye believe not search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they that testify in me so we've got to rightly divide this word what does God want me to do with my life Jesus said verily verily I say to you he that believeth on me in other words he that has the word abiding in him the works I that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than the shall he do because I go to my father I want to Bear the fruit of God I in myself can't do it I've got to be filled with his Spirit that's why every morning in my prayer I say God fill me with you fill me with your spirit I I mean sometimes you get up up in the morning you you just feel like his presence is so near sometimes you get up in the morning and you wonder what happened where did he go and you just got to labor and labor but it is the right thing to do don't just ignore it and get up and go because then the next day it'll be easier to let go Jesus said he that believeth on me as the scripture have said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water so I need to believe the correct way I can't just say I believe I need to believe the correct way and if I do out of my life is going to throw the fruit of the spirit yes but if I'm not believing it right it's not going to flow and I just say like this if every one of us I'm sure there might be somebody saying yeah he's speaking right to me I am not speaking directly to anybody because I lifted everybody's name up in prayer this morning I say God would you let this word bless brother so and so sister so and so and I called each one out today even those that are not here but look look at your life do you see rivers of Living Water just flowing out praise God praise God if you think you got a kink in the holes I want you to say God let your word be manifested in me because when you start obeying the scriptures it'll start flowing because that's the word and God can't lie all scripture is given by the inspiration of God and is profitable profitable you want more answers for your life start pressing into the scriptures submit to the word obey the word get inside the word let the word inside of you don't just go to church and say yeah I heard the sermon leave the doors with the sermon leave the doors with the sermon leave the doors with God I want to live this word I want to get into scriptures more I want to see your life flowing through me more I want to be I want your word to inspire me for my situation I want to profit my life I don't want it just to be something I just you know pick up my daily bread and that's it I want some I want my motive to be different behind that daily bread when I pick it up are you with me praise the Lord all right Philippians chapter 2 we're going to try to hurry and I know you'd all be happy with that Philippians chapter 2 verse number 12 the word works if you let it work in you that's right it works if you let it work in you Philippians chapter 2:12 wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not my presence only but now much more at your home right work out your own salvation with fear and trembling now look if you've always obeyed the word in the presence of Paul and even more not in the presence of Paul why do you need to work out your salvation see see what I'm saying here it's not about you're saved or not saved it's about God saving you from your situation now what do I mean by that is yes we've been saved but our character needs to be molded into the image of Jesus Christ so there are things in our life that are not pleasing that are not right and we've got to work that out with fear and trembling look at verse 13 for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure so do all things without murmurings and disputings that you may be blameless and harmless as son of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ I have not run in vain neither labored in vain let these scriptures be alive inside of you just do it don't complain about it if God speaks something just do it let God work out what he wants to work out in you if you always go by your own understanding this is what happens when you lean to your own understanding well I prayed yesterday and nothing happened well I prayed all last week and nothing happened that's what happens when you lean to your own understanding so don't lean to it just do it and now believe it each day begin to believe it more and more this is the only way the word will come alive to us amen if we're going to go off of a song to inspire us make us feel good it may last for a while but we want that word to actually become alive in this so God uses the song praise God he uses a song and if God uses our F our our our famous uh our favorite preacher a a favorite quote a favorite message I'm good with with it something's got to get the thing started but once it gets started now you got to let this word become your inspiration right amen you must this is God's love to you if you want profit from your time being here in church leave the doors with I'm going to follow this word leave the doors with that leave your prayer with that 1 Thessalonians chapter 2: 13 says I believe this is my last scripture for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when you receive the word of God which he heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is truth the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe it work Works in you if you take it in you receive it not if you believe it here don't work here the word works if you take it in to your heart amen let's Stand Together God bless you can I uh read second chronicles 20:20 hear me oh send the light church and the inhabitants of Fenton Michigan believe in the Lord your God so shall you be established believe His prophets so shall you prosper believe as the scriptures have teaching us to believe a message that God has for us continue in the scriptures they're able to make us wise to save us from the situations that we're in am don't try to handle them on your own we're not big enough for the devil right we need God we need God's help God is just calling us to look to him for inspiration you remember brother bandam taught us about inspiration he said the Way Up Is Down our understanding says want to go up I'm going to go this way I'm gonna let you know how great I am but God but brother says no no it's going down amen see so God's inspiration is not going to be what we think it's going to be it'll be humbling to us but it will glorify him amen it's saying I love him I love him you love the Lord amen I love him I love him because he first loved me and P is my [Applause] Sal [Music] un amen we all our lives I love him I love him because he first love me and for just my salvation [Music] un amen let's close your eyes this time and sing it to him love him I love him because he first loved me and P just my [Music] salvation amen with our heads bowed as my wife continues to play that quietly I love him I love him because he first loved me and he purchased our Salvation there at Calvary he saved us but I can say today every day I need God's Saving Grace for my life I wonder if there'd be anybody here today that God spoke to you and you desire prayer today for your situations God bless these hands God Seize Your Hands praise the Lord I believe our God is able to do exceedingly above all that we ask all that we think let's trust God as we believe with all of our hearts now as we take this request our request before the Lord our heavenly father we bow before you with Thanksgiving for Calvary because we know that Calvary paid the price that your Holy Spirit could come back and now have its Abode with us Lord we have raised our hands we love your word and now we're asking God would you come and help us save us from our situations Lord God give us inspiration only through your word father let your word inspire us Lord let your word save us Lord let your your word profit Our Lives Lord that we may be complete Lord father you saw the hands that were raised father you see the Heart Lord you see the many nights that were spent crying in prayer Lord some of these needs are great you're touched by the feelings of our infirmities

ahead Lord that there's going to be a victory for them today and we're claiming it by faith today Lord we're believing it we're believing that Prayer Changes Things Lord may you give encouragement and strength to each one to Keep On Believing Lord and may you inspire every one of us to spend just a little bit more time in the scriptures reading this week Lord just to find steal away some time cuz we know we don't always have it but Lord if we could you would just give us the grace to spend more time reading your word father and that through that word Lord you give us the help that we have need of Father Grant it we submit our life to you we give you our life Lord and we thank you Father for giving us your precious word
