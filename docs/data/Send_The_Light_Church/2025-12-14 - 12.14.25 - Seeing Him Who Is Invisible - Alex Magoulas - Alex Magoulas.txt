TRANSCRIPT
========================================
THESE GUYS ARE GETTING TOSSED IN FLAMES. They're like, "WE'RE NOT BACKING UP ANYHOW." &gt;&gt; LOOKED RIGHT AT THAT KING. LOOKED RIGHT AT NEBUCHADNEZZAR. SUPPOSED TO LOOK RIGHT AT PHARAOH. IT DOESN'T MATTER. I'm doing it anyhow. &gt;&gt; GOD SAID SO. GOD SAID IT. I BELIEVE IT. AND THAT SETTLES IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We just give up to, you know, Well, praise the Lord. Well, [laughter] I'm trying to think how to not throw everybody under the bus here. You know, Brother Bam talks about stubbornness. It's not of God. And stubbornness is just perseverance that's not submitted to God. Amen. When it comes to serving God, we'll we will lack perseverance. We get wishy-washy. We have a little trouble. Well, I can't go to church. I can't pray. I can't do this. We we BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IF IF you like a Oh, praise the Lord here. If you were a drinker in the world and you like TO DRINK, GUESS WHAT? You might not have a dime in the bank. Let me ask somebody. YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BEG AND YOU'LL FIND A WAY. AMEN. AND IF YOU WERE A SMOKER, YOU IF YOU LIKE ROCK MUSIC AND you want to go to that concert and YOU ONLY SLEPT TWO HOURS, YOU DON'T GOT A DIAMOND, YOU'LL BEG AND BORROW AND STEAL. YOU WON'T LET NOTHING STOP YOU FROM GETTING WHAT YOU WANT because you want it. IF WE WANTED GOD THE WAY WE wanted the world when we were in the world, WE'D HAVE AS MUCH OF GOD AS WE COULD GET. THERE'S NO LIMIT to it. AMEN. THE PROBLEM IS NOT GOD HOLDING BACK ON US. IT'S THAT WE DON'T WANT IT BAD ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; WELL, if I HEAR FROM GOD, I GUESS I HOPE IT WORKS OUT. And if I don't, I'll go on WITH MY LIFE. NO, I FOR MYSELF. AMEN. I had to hear from God or I was dying. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like Paul already talked about he's praying that field. HE SAID, "GOD, YOU GIVE ME THE HOLY GHOST." HE SAID, "IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME THE HOLY GHOST, THERE'S GOING TO BE A PILE OF BONES HERE. WHEN YOU COME BACK, I'M NOT MOVING. I'M NOT GIVING UP. &gt;&gt; WE GIVE UP SO EASY." &gt;&gt; AND GOD NEVER ONCE GAVE UP ON US. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE. LOOK AT OUR OFFENSE. LOOK AT OUR WRETCHEDNESS. Look at OUR FAILURE IN FRONT OF A HOLY [screaming] GOD &gt;&gt; WHO'S NEVER SINNED. HE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT HE KNOWS YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF. HE HAS EVERY [screaming] REASON TO GIVE UP ON US. BUT HE'S NEVER ONCE given up ON YOU AND I. HE'S NEVER LEFT YOU. HE'S NEVER FORSAKEN YOU. HE'S NEVER TURNED you down. We're the ones that give up. &gt;&gt; Well, that's all extra there. I don't put that addendum in the book later. Brother Ram said that when God when he was talking about Moses and he met God at that burning bush, he said five minutes talking with God. Oh my, hear me now. FIVE MINUTES TALKING TO GOD. He was more equipped. HE WAS MORE equipped to go to Egypt than 40 years had made him of himself. 40 years of training, 40 YEARS OF EFFORT. FIVE MINUTES. AMEN. LISTEN, I'm talking about pressing through that. I'm not even asking FOR A LOT OF IT. YOU JUST GET IN GOD'S PRESENCE FOR FIVE MINUTES AND WATCH [screaming] HOW MUCH DIFFERENT YOUR LIFE WILL BE THAN WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH IT YOUR WHOLE LIFE. GOD DID MORE IN FIVE MINUTES in that man's life than he'd ever had happen the first 80. My God can do more in seconds. we could do in a whole lifetime. And here we are batting at the air. I'll get it done. I can live right. I can be holy. No, you can't. But God in you can. &gt;&gt; Well, it's just so hard. It's so hard to serve God. It's so hard to give this up. The hardest thing you'll ever do is not do it. Because you'll struggle and you'll fight your whole life and you you you'll get tired. You're always running from trouble, always running from your problems. And listen, you'll get tired way before they do. Moses wore himself out for 40 years running from trouble. Amen. But five minutes, all of his complexes, all of his weakness, all of HIS PROBLEMS, IT DIDN'T MATTER. FIVE MINUTES IN the presence of God made him ready. Amen. That's what happens when a man or woman meets God. Amen. I believe he does the same thing today. That's what the message of the hour did for me. Amen. Listen. BUT IF AN INVISIBLE GOD can make himself seen, if a bush can burn and not be consumed, then it's a small MATTER FOR GOD TO TAKE MY LIFE and make it what he wants it to be. IT'S A SMALL MATTER FOR GOD TO TAKE YOUR PROBLEM and change it into a blessing. Amen. It's anything too hard for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. That fire that was in that bush, now he's saying, "I'm come down. to deliver this people. Amen. That pillar of fire was going to go before him. It was going to defend him from behind. And listen, like brother Bram said, you can't get warm with a painted fire. Me telling you about fire today won't make you warm. Maybe the furnace will. I don't know. But see, I'm getting sweaty already. [laughter] A painting of a fire won't make you warm. Amen. But a real fire will make you warm. Not only will it make you warm, it'll give you light. It illuminates things that were hidden. It illuminates the darkness. there's a heat IN A REAL FIRE. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE FIRE FOR YOURSELF. It's not enough to say, "Oh, I believe there was a pillar of fire in that day." It's not enough to say there's a that the THE TONGUES OF FIRE CAME down the day of Pentecost. IT'S NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO SAY, "WELL, I believe in 1950 that pillar of fire was photographed in Houston, Texas over a prophet's head." But that SAME PILLAR OF FIRE HAS got to be in you today, right now. &gt;&gt; If it's not, you'll die. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; All there is to it. &gt;&gt; Listen, if that fire is in you, it'll equip you &gt;&gt; in five minutes, maybe. &gt;&gt; He'll equip you. HE'LL FORTIFY YOU. HE WON'T LET YOU STAND STILL. HE WON'T LET YOU SIT IN SIN. HE WON'T LET YOU BE COMPLACENT. There's a restlessness. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. Listen, Jeremiah one time said, "You know what? I I'VE BEEN A PROPHET, BUT THEY THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY." AND HE got concerned. He was tired of getting yelled at all the time. AMEN. LISTEN, JEREMIAH SAID, "I'M I'm not going I'm not going to preach in his name anymore. I'm not going to make mention OF HIM. I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT." BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? The more he tried to hold it back, THE WORSE IT GOT. HE SAID, "IT'S LIKE A FIRE. SHUT UP IN MY BONES." AND THE MORE I TRIED TO FOREBEAR, [screaming] THE MORE I COULDN'T HOLD IT IN. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT CRIES OUT IN THE BELIEVER TODAY. There was SOMETHING IN MOSES SAID, "I CAN'T TURN BACK. I CAN'T WALK ALL THE WAY HERE TO PHARAOH, WALK UP TO HIS FACE, tell him, "Thus say the Lord, let my people go, and then WALK AWAY, AND GIVE UP NOW. I CAN'T DO IT." &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I'M NOT here today just because I was invited, although I appreciate that. Talk about on THE EARTH TODAY. I'M NOT HERE TODAY just because I wanted to BE HERE. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE SOMETHING IN ME, I ALLOWED IT TO TAKE AUTHORITY, a resonance above, and I COULDN'T HELP IT. AMEN. I'VE GOT TO BE WHAT GOD MADE ME TO BE. AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH POWERS OF DARKNESS TO STOP IT. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH IN YOUR LIFE THAT'S AGAINST YOU TO STOP IT. BECAUSE IF GOD BE FOR YOU, WHO CAN BE AGAINST YOU? [laughter] Praise the Lord. I love this defiance. Amen. MOST PEOPLE ARE DEFIANT IN THE face of God's will, but I love BECAUSE MOSES IS DEFIANT IN THE FACE OF THE ENEMY. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of defiance we want. Amen. Not defiance against that which is right and holy, which is what most of us did in our sinful lives, or all of us actually. Amen. Defies the powers of darkness. Amen. There's people sitting here today. You different ones that are here today. You're not hopefully you're not here because of a religious obligation. You're not here to be seen and heard by others. It's more than just a position or a claim. Brother John, you don't do this because you love the fame and the not. Oh man, everybody just thinks I'm He's [laughter] Well, praise the Lord. Poor guy. I was trying to make you feel bad either. Listen, God called man. He's not doing it because of all the the things that people will say and all the nice Listen, they suffer through things. They go through Listen, they deal with hardships that not everybody knows about all the time. And he can't just get up here and I'm going through this. Amen. He can't do that because there's a mission in his life to help and equip the people of God. AND IT SUPERSEDES all that. Amen. And and as a minister, AS CHRISTIANS, YOU WATCH PEOPLE, THEY SAY AND do things and you try to help THEM OUT AND THEY WALK AWAY FROM WHAT'S SENSIBLE or right and then they turn around and they make it LIKE YOU WERE THE BAD GUY. AND AND ALL THAT'S COMING AT YOU. THERE'S got to be something in us at the end of the day that refuses to give up. Cuz I would have gave up a long time ago, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But God in me won't give up. &gt;&gt; He never gave up on you. He never gave up on me. And God Emmy is not going to give up now. &gt;&gt; Causes him to endure. There's a power in you. It caused you to get out of bed this morning real early. Some of us, you know, get up and sing and put your hands together. You say amen to the word in church. It's something that's bigger than you and I. Amen. And I thank God for that. I'm glad it's not depending on me. See, I'm actually happy about it because if it depended on me, I would be worried because I'd have done messed it up a long time ago. Amen. Don't be upset that it doesn't depend on you. You should be so glad that God was smart enough not to let it depend on what you want to do all the time cuz you'd have made a mess of it like you do everything else. Well, you know, I got quiet on that one, but it's truth anyhow. &gt;&gt; Most of our problems in our life, whether we realize it or not, we cause most of them. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it takes a little wisdom, but you finally realize, well, praise the Lord, this happened and this happened. All these people, they all Well, may maybe I'm the problem. That's a good That's a tough realization. But you have to come to that. Amen. If you don't come to that, you'll never receive what he's trying to give you because you'll always think, "Nah, I'm I'm good. I don't need it." You do need it. You just don't realize it. Amen. I'm glad it's not dependent on me or you today because I'd ended up the way 40-year-old Moses did. Amen. I'd have looked at the whole thing and I messed it up. Amen. But when Moses sees this one that's invisible, he doesn't fear. And the Bible says this, too. We read this. He said, it says that he esteemed the reproach of Christ. Everybody know what reproach is? It's the it's the bad part. It's the part that, oh, you look dumb. You look bad. Oh, you're a holy roll. Oh, you're a Bible thumper. Oh, you're one of them Christians. The reproach or the shame of it. Amen. But he esteemed. Think about this word esteem. He He esteemed it. He valued it. He esteemed the reproach of Christ greater than the treasures of Egypt. Amen. And when he did that, it made a decision for him. &gt;&gt; See, what you value affects what you decide. Amen. And the Bible says he chose. Oh my. He chose to suffer affliction. MOST OF US JUST SUFFER AFFLICTION WHETHER we want to or not. We go through trouble. WE GO THROUGH. BUT HE EMBRACES IT. THIS IS HIS DECISION. I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH SOMETHING AND IT'S REALLY BAD, BUT I'M GOING TO CHOOSE TO DO IT BECAUSE I VALUE [screaming] THE PRIZE OR THE REWARD FOR IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He chose to suffer affliction with THE PEOPLE OF GOD RATHER than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. Amen. Because it's just a season. It's temporary. Right. All these things the world chases after, it's temporary. You get that bottle and you think that this will make my day. And you get to the bottom of that bottle and then before you know it, you're looking for another one. You're [snorts] looking for another syringe. You're looking for another this, you're looking for another that. It's never ENOUGH CUZ IT'S TEMPORARY. But he looked at the unseen, the eternal, AND SAID, "I WOULD RATHER SUFFER TO GET WHAT THAT IS." LISTEN, I'M NOT asking you all day to go in chains and bondage. Now, you might have to. I don't know. But Amen. THIS MAN CHOSE [screaming] TO SUFFER TO GET THE PRIZE, TO GET THE TREASURE. AND THE THE TREASURE was the reproach of Christ. &gt;&gt; It's not EVEN THE BEST PART. AMEN. WELL, praise the Lord. Brother Bam says this, looking at the unseen, Moses, when he become 40 years old, a young man, as far as sight was concerned, MOSES HAD THE WORLD IN HIS HAND. NOW, think about this. Now, we're not talking about just a a guy working at the 7-Eleven. We're talking about an Elon MUSK OR SOMEBODY SOMEBODY'S GOT EVERYTHING AT HIS FINGERTIPS. The world's his oyster. Amen. Moses had the world in his hand. He was the next pharaoh of Egypt. He had all the lands of the world right in his hand to be king over the entire earth, knowing of at that day. And yet, oh my, it's marvelous. Yet, he looked through the window that Pharaoh looked out of. Same window, same scene. He looked out the the window that Pharaoh looked out of and he saw those Hebrews. To Pharaoh who looked upon them, there was nothing but a bunch of mudbers down there in the mud making brick. To the celebrity as they passed by, they said the SAME THING. THE WELL-DRESSED PEOPLE, WELL, THAT'S A BUNCH OF SLAVES. NOTHING BUT MUD WALLOWERS. But when Moses looked out the same window, amen, think about this now. He saw them different because he looked at the unseen and KNOWED THAT GOD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD deliver them out of that place and take them to a land of promise. This is why you sit in a church and you got all kinds of different responses. Some people sit there like, "Man, that guy's nuts. He's just reading the Bible and looking like a and that's all they think about it." Amen. But there's some people they see they they they relate to it and energize them. Why? They're looking at the same thing, but they're not seeing the same thing. They have two different perceptions. Amen. One is looking at a natural man, the foolishness of preaching. It's the reproach of Christ. This looks LIKE THE WORST. AMEN. WHY WOULD ANYBODY in their right mind want to do that? But if you can look beyond that, if you can look beyond the man, YOU CAN SEE WHAT GOD'S TRYING TO DO. IT'S THE BEST THING EVER. I WILL TAKE THE WORST. I get ahead of myself here for a second. I'LL TAKE THE WORST THAT GOD has because it's still better THAN THE BEST. SEE, IT'S NOT THE SITUATION or the circumstance. It's what you're looking at. It's all how you perceive it. They saw the same thing through the same window. Same circ. But Moses perceived something that's not mudbers. That's the people of God. He said this. He looked at the unseen and know that God had promised he would deliver them out of that place and take them to a land of promise. He looked at THE UNSEEN. HE SAW the years that were coming ahead. He saw Egypt destroyed. Yet, she's in her blossoming time. Think about that now. When mo even when he comes back to Egypt, Moses sees the height of Egypt. He's not looking at ruins and destruction, but yet WHEN HE LOOKS AT THAT'S what he sees. He knows it's already over. I'm so glad I was born in the US. I thank God for this country. I thank God for imminent blessings. But listen, it's over. The whole thing, the whole world even. It's all going to be destroyed. It's all going to be renovated. Amen. We've seen it ahead of time through the word. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO, YOUR PERCEPTION changes what you value. [snorts] He didn't value that cuz he saw it laid waste. And he sees these mudbers. They're going to come out. He says he saw Egypt destroyed, yet she was in her blossom time. He saw Egypt as she is today. And he saw Israel all comfortably seated around Abraham in glory. AND BY FAITH, HE chose to take, watch this, the worst the religion could give him and compare with the best the world could give him. And he chose to suffer the reproach of Christ and considered a greater treasure than all Egypt could afford to give him because he endured his seeing him who was invisible. God had SPOKE TO MOSES AND MOSES knew who God was. So he did not look upon the brightness. And here might I say to the church tonight, Moses had in one hand the best the world could give him. There could have been no better. This is the apex. Amen. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE HIGHEST OFFICE. IT WAS THE BEST THE WORLD. Some of us sold out for a lot less than that. I'll raise my hand. Amen. Amen. I wasn't even the best. I just wanted to get by. Amen. He's got the best before him. Amen. And religion offered him the worst that could be given. Bunch of slaves in a mud pit. And now if a man was looking, what side would he take? Let me say this without sincerity and without any malice. But let me say this so you'll understand today. He says, don't look at the big church. Don't look at the great denomination. Don't look at the well-dressed. Look at Christ. who was rich and became poor that through his poverty you might be made rich. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And when you're seeking a church, don't go where all the celebrity goes or the big PhDs, DDS, but look down upon the people who are looked down upon. Behold these people. They're so looked DOWN UPON. THEY'RE DESPISED. THAT'S THE ONES that are valuable. That's the ones you should be paying attention to. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. Moses when he had them in both hands, the best the world could give to what he could look at. And yet when he looked at the unseen, the worst the church could give him, he chose to walk by faith. And he chose to walk by the unseen. God counting it a greater treasure than all his sight could afford to show him. Here was the kingdom. Here was the kingship. Here was the throne. HERE WAS THE CROWN. HERE WAS EVERYTHING in his hand. But yet by faith when he CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF CHRIST OUT THERE IN THE MUD PITS HE went to his people. He said now here's another this is really good too. Here's another little lesson on Moses. Now Moses didn't just sit back and say I sympathize with those people. Those are good people. You know I I would not speak one word against them. Now that's the way a lot of religionists does today. When they hear a strict message about the real God, they'll say, "Well, oh, I have nothing against those people who believe in divine healing. I have nothing against those people who believe in miracles, but that's not enough. Moses didn't just sympathize with them and stay on the throne. He went out and become one of them. Brother talks about his own life. He was a bapt he was in the he was in the Baptist church. He was a minister and the Presbyterian one was paying for schooling for him and this and that. He had an option to do that. But when he saw them people that his mother-in-law called holy rollers, called them fanatics, CALLED THEM TRASH, HE SAID, "THAT WASN'T TRASH. That's the cream of the crop. Amen. He said, "I went out to them. I become one of them. Now I'm a holy roller. Now I'm one of them, too." Let them say WHAT THEY WANT. I I DON'T WANT TO JUST SAY, "WELL, THOSE ARE GOOD, fine people. I'm sure that cuz that's what people do. All them message people, they're good, fine people. You know, I'm I'm sure they got some good things they teach and these people do." NO, YOU YOU HAVE TO BE identified with it. &gt;&gt; Well, I believe that God is real. Well, SO DID THE DEVIL. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST SYMPATHIZE. You've got to go out to them. And you've got to become one of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; So much of life, like we were just talking a moment ago, it's it's based on your perspective. You know, uh it's that time of the year people go hunting and stuff. Now, now gun season's pretty short. And now I like to shoot guns. You knew that already, of course. But anybody ever looked for binoculars or a scope or something like that? You get this thing and you can see real far out. It's real crystal. It's great. You can see that. But there's one problem with it. the other 290 degrees around you, you don't see nothing. Something runs by, you can't see it. Your your perspective is really strong, but it's so narrow. Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE LOCKED IN, OH, LOOK AT THE WORLD. LOOK AT RICHES. LOOK WHAT PEOPLE WANT. AND YOU'RE MISSING THAT God is right there trying to deal with you cuz your perspective is limited. Amen. So much of life, and I preach this a lot anyway, but it's the truth. So much of life is perspective. Amen. You can be you can be begrudging of the things that happen in your life or you can be grateful for your blessings. You have to make that choice. &gt;&gt; I can't make you grateful for what God has done in your life. You have to choose to do that. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO GET UP AND choose to do that. You have to go to bed at night and choose to do that. I choose to be grateful. Amen. BECAUSE I SEE WHAT God has done my life. I acknowledge it. I thank God for it. Amen. I want to give him praise and thanks because I've seen what God has done for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. My wife, she's not here today, so I can say this. She wouldn't care anyway. But you know, all the time, listen, I'll say this, brother. We're living in the most insane age it's ever been. People are going insane. And if you didn't believe that five or 10 years ago, you sure do now. People are nuts. They're all over the place. They They've got no common sense. Maybe that's why I stopped making pennies. They ain't got no sense, I guess. I don't know. BUT NO COMMON SENSE. NO SOUND REASONING. AMEN. And you watch people, my wife, we do this all the time. She'll watch somebody do something, said, 'I don't understand why they do that. That doesn't make sense. I said, 'Honey, you're not supposed to understand. If it made sense to you, you'd think it was it was reasonable. Listen, Moses is an oddball to Pharaoh. PHARAOH'S LIKE, "WHY WOULD A GUY THAT COULD DO WHAT I'VE GOT NOW? LOOK AT WHAT I'VE GOT AND YOU GAVE IT UP FOR THIS. WHAT AN IDIOT." &gt;&gt; But you know what? Pharaoh was an eyeball to Moses. You think this is great? This is all GOING TO GET DESTROYED. THIS [screaming] AIN'T NOTHING. THIS IS GREAT. As he points at a bunch of guys covered in mud, [snorts] &gt;&gt; they're odd. Neither one makes sense to the other. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO MAKE SENSE. IF YOU'RE SANE, THEN INSANITY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO YOU. AND IF YOU'RE INSANE, a sane person doesn't make sense to you either. &gt;&gt; There's no way to reconcile it. THE THE CARNAL MIND, IT'S enmity with God. Amen. the the flesh and the spirit, THEY'RE AT EMITY. THEY THEY'RE NEVER going to line up. IF YOU'RE IF YOU WANT YOUR FEELINGS AND YOUR FLESH AND your your your ego TO VALIDATE YOUR CHOICE TO [screaming] SERVE GOD AND TO LOVE GOD, NEVER GOING TO WORK. AMEN. YOU'VE got to choose. Amen. Is this the real me or is there SOMETHING MORE? And if there's something more, then we should be more concerned about that than this. Listen, I just went to the doctor this week. I'm going to sit here and tell you all my health issues, but let me say this. Amen. You get sick in your body, you're taking pills, you're eating different, YOU'RE GETTING MAGNETIC BRACELETS, AND YOU'RE YOU'RE GROUNDING NOW, AND YOU'RE DOING ALL THIS STUFF FOR YOUR BODY, WHICH IS EVENTUALLY GOING TO DIE ANYWAY. BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING MORE TO YOU, LISTEN, that's going to that's the thing that you should really be concerned about. WE'LL GIVE HOURS [screaming] A WEEK TO OUR PHYSICAL CONDITION. Not saying you shouldn't, but we'll pay we'll PAY SO MUCH ATTENTION. WELL, I was just looking at medical journals yesterday. Amen. We'll we'll pour OVER LITERATURE AND VIDEOS AND WE'RE GOING TO LEARN WHAT TO EAT AND WHAT NOT TO. But we've neglected the soul. &gt;&gt; The thing that really matters. &gt;&gt; People are out of their minds running around doing all that praising God like that. THEY'RE OUT OF THEIR MINDS. THEY'RE GOING TO THINK that because they thought the way you did they'd be here. [laughter] Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I I just tell him I am out of my mind. I got the mind of Christ now. &gt;&gt; It's better. Let me say once again, it's better than the one I had. Amen. WE HAVE THE MIND OF CHRIST. SO, YOU ARE OUT OF your mind, but you're in the mind of Christ. Amen. That's why brother B said, "You look like a mystic to the world." Amen. They think you're some sort of weird spooky whatever. But the Bible says THAT PERFECT FAITH, YOU LOOK LIKE A MYSTIC. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE SHUT away in a world WITH JUST YOU AND GOD. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE INVISIBLE God and you're talking to them and you're making decisions and you're basing your life. You're orienting it AROUND THIS WORD AND THEY think you're nuts. Then people believe in praying FOR THE SICK. WHO DOES THAT ANYWAY? WELL, TELL YOU WHAT, YOU GET desperate enough, the the biggest unbeliever will pray for the [laughter] somebody, God, would you help me out? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like I said, people call me all kinds of names in my life, but you know what? They call me when they're sick. [snorts] &gt;&gt; They call me when they want prayer. Amen. You know, I'm not talking about I'm talking about us today. Amen. They'll call you a BUNCH OF ODDBALLS. YOU guys are nuts. But without the nuts, it's nothing but a pile of yunk. &gt;&gt; Something's got to hold it together. SOMETHING'S GOT TO KEEP IT GOING. AMEN. They go on heedless of their lives thinking that they're getting by, but it's because there's a praying people on the face of the earth today. And the people they hate the most are the ones that are keeping them alive. &gt;&gt; That's Moses's whole story. Even out there in the wilderness, he's constantly God, don't kill them. God don't destroy him. AND THEY WANT TO KILL MOSES. &gt;&gt; The thankless job as far as men are concerned. You know, it's got good benefits. It's got an eternal life package. Blessed assurance. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to bring this all full circle. I I'm I'm not even halfway through, but I'm not going to keep you all day. But this is what I'm coming to. Moses endured because he saw him who was invisible. You endure when you see the invisible God. Amen. It is not, as we like to think, based on our ability to see our outcome or our circumstances. That's where we make our mistake. We try to look at all our options and look at the circumstances. We look at the problems. We look at the symptoms. we get discouraged. Well, if you look at those things, you will. But if you look at the invisible God, you will endure. You're not going to endure based on your ability to perceive the outcome of your circumstances or your ability to figure it out. We try TO FIGURE IT OUT AND THEN WHEN WE DO TRY to do what we did that we figured it out and it doesn't work. I just don't know what happened. I know. I know what happened. YOU HAPPENED. YOUR IDEA HAPPENED AND YOUR IDEA LIKE MY IDEA was terrible. WE LOOKED at partial data. We looked at our perspective and we made a decision without any sort of knowledge of what's really going on. But see, God doesn't have that problem. God knows all the things. God sees the beginning from the end. Amen. He's not making decisions based on partial information, but God is making, he's already made his decisions based on perfect knowledge. So, you don't endure from seeing your circumstance or even seeing the outcome. You endure because you've seen God. That's why the Bible declares in Isaiah uh chapter 26:3 that thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee. Now, this this Hebrew says perfect peace. They don't actually have a word for that in the Hebrew. It's actually peace. Peace. Because when you want to emphasize something in the Hebrew, you say it twice like Moses. Moses instead of an exclamation mark. So thou will keep him in peace. Peace. Or in other words, peace. Amen. Thou will keep him in shalom. Shalom. Whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusts in thee. Amen. So, we're not enduring today because we know how it's all going to turn out. and we've studied it and we figured it out and we all of our problems we know what the solution is. We we we know what problems we're going to encounter at what point in our life and it's all m we don't know. Amen. Probably if you saw ahead of time all the things you were going to go through in this life you might not have wanted to go through them. Moses foraw some things but he chose to suffer affliction for the treasure of Christ the reproach of Christ. Amen. So God, I love this because the Bible, even Jesus does this, you know, he he endured the cross, he despises the shame, but he does it because of the joy that was set before him. In other words, he chose to suffer because it was worth it for the prize. &gt;&gt; You ask a good athlete, you ask a businessman, you ask somebody wants to be successful, there's sacrifice, there's suffering. Amen. Not everybody's willing to do it. That's why not everybody achieves it. Amen. There's a price to be paid for great things. Amen. And Jesus endures THE CROSS. HE DESPISES THE SHAME. BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF THE JOY that was set before him. BECAUSE OF THE PRIZE. YOU ARE THE JOY THAT WAS SET BEFORE HIM. PRAISE GOD. THAT OUGHT TO MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD TODAY. ALL THAT HE WENT THROUGH, HE WENT THROUGH because he looked at you and said, "You're worth it." &gt;&gt; We don't see all things like that, but we do know how it ends. Like that old song we used to sing. I read the back of the book and we win. &gt;&gt; Listen, even Paul talked about this in Romans chapter 8. I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. &gt;&gt; Now think about this. He reckons. In other words, he doesn't have a perfect knowledge, but he reckons. In other words, we consider that no matter what you're going through, it's not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us. Amen. IN OTHER WORDS, I'LL take the worst of religion over the best that the world has. Amen. He's not saying this because he's in a glorified body. HE'S NOT SEEING IT ALL LAID OUT IN FRONT OF HIM. But he reasons it's no matter what I go through, it's got to be worth it. It's got to be worth it. You believe that today? Whatever you're going through right now, whatever you've been through, listen, if it's for the Lord, it's got to be worth it. &gt;&gt; It will be worth it. It's It's even worth it in this life. How much more the one to come? Amen. Man, I'm way off here. Who's got another hour? No. Brother says this, "God don't tell his prophets everything." No, this is prophets. He just tells them what he wants them to know. Not everything. They can do nothing in themselves. Just what God shows them. He said, 'Could you imagine Isaac sitting blind, blessing Jacob instead of Esau. Can you imagine Jacob holding Joseph's coat for 40 years bloody thinking that an animal killed him? Being a prophet proves God just reveals his prophets what he wants them to know and nothing else. Prophets are not infallible people. Prophets are not angels. They are men. &gt;&gt; I I just want to I'll do this real quick. I just want to throw this in here, but Jacob's whole story is so interesting for you that know it. Of course, Joseph has a dream. He has a couple dreams. And he sees himself ruling over his brethren, his and and Leah and and his father and and his brethren. They hear about this because, you know, Joseph exercised all the wisdom of a 17-year-old. He sees this dream, this vision that he's going to rule over the earth, rule over his brethren. And what's he do? He tells him, "Probably wouldn't do that myself at 42. I might have at 17." Hey guys, guess what? YOU KNOW HOW IT IS. YOUR BROTHER takes my my kids fight over socks. THE DUMBEST THING. PROBABLY ONE DAY. OH YEAH. WELL, I CAN PICK up more than you. I Well, that's my land. Oh, yeah. Well, I'm going to be your boss one day. I'm going to rule the earth. And the Bible said they love No, THEY HATED THEY HATED THEIR BROTHER FOR EVEN JACOB'S LIKE, MAN, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. THAT SEEMS KIND OF BUT THE BIBLE says this, we we gloss over this. The Bible said he considered the matter. In other words, like Mary, she kept it in her. That's what it means in the Hebrew. He he took the matter and he he held on to it. Amen, my son. Because there was something different about Joseph and it caused Jacob to love him. He saw visions. He saw dreams. He was spiritual like his dad. And his dad, he couldn't relate to the other kids on, you know, how you have different kids. Some of them like certain hobbies and other ones LIKE THIS IS HIS ONE KID. They can relate to him about all VISIONS AND DREAMS. YOU GET IT? SO, HE MAKES HIM THIS COAT OF MANY COLORS. And now his brothers hate him even more. &gt;&gt; One day they said, "THAT'S IT. WE'RE KILLING THIS GUY." These patriarchs are some fine guys, by the way. Real sweethearts, I tell you what, I got family like that, too. So do you. WE'RE GOING TO KILL HIM. AND UH I can't remember. Was it Judah? Which I probably have it in here somewhere. One of them says, "Let's not kill him. Let's just let's just sell him into slavery. We can make some money off of it. &gt;&gt; Sell him for 20 pieces of silver, whatever." So they sell him into slavery and he goes off and this is what I'm getting at. Amen. Jacob begins to weep and lament. He's lost Rachel, his beloved wife. He's lo all this stuff's happened. But when it comes when it comes to Joseph, it's something different. It just hits him. Amen. He he couldn't he would not be comforted. The Bible said his sons would come to him and he would not be comforted. and he sees this bloody garment. Now, here's what here's what I want to get you to real quick. He sees the bloody garment and he begins to imagine. He doesn't know. God didn't show him. He doesn't even have any He has a bloody garment and he begins to imagine, "Oh, something must have killed my son. Something has run him apart." And his imagination begins to take him somewhere that God never told him to go. Amen. How many times do we think about a certain thing and we have our idea of oh God must not love me or oh God this or this or that and we let our imagination build this scenario in our minds and we'll lose peace. We'll lose sleep. We'll get heartache. Listen, Jacob for years he lost sleep. He he he would not be comforted. He he was miserable. Amen. He lost he he he so many things he missed out on. Amen. But thank God there's one thing he never lost. Never lost his faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew that he'd have to reap what he sowed. But there was some plan for it. But but this God, God had shown him this was going to be the case. And I think this is I think this is why it hurts him so much. It's not just that his beloved son dies. But he believed the dream. He believed the dream his son had showed him and now he sees his son is gone. Maybe he didn't really see anything. Maybe it was all a lie. Maybe everything I believed was all just made up. You know what's funny about that? That's not what Abraham did. Amen. Abraham knew that if Isaac died, God have to raise him back up. Amen. But Jacob's imagination allowed him to think that God had done this thing to him, that God had hurt him. Now you say, "Listen, that he's on talking terms with God. It looks cruel to us. It looks cruel. Any moment God could have been like, "Hey, by the way, Joseph's alive. Pass it on. God, you you got 20 YEARS TO GOD. [screaming] ANYTIME NOW you want to LET ME KNOW. THAT'D BE GREAT." NOTHING. GOD, WE SAID, "GOD, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HIM JOSEPH'S ALIVE?" JUST JUST JUST three words. JOSEPH IS ALIVE ANYTIME. WHY [screaming] DOESN'T GOD TELL HIM? I'LL TELL YOU WHY GOD DIDN'T TELL HIM. The same reason he wouldn't tell me because I'd went right down to Egypt and said, "Give me my SON BACK. I DON'T WANT HIM DOWN THERE. I LOVE MY BOY. I wouldn't do that to him." God knows it. That's why he didn't tell him because he had to go DOWN THERE TO PRESERVE LIFE. IF JOSEPH HAD NOT BEEN THERE, THEY WOULD HAVE [screaming] ALL DIED AND MUCH OF THE WORLD WOULD HAVE DIED OF FAMINE. AMEN. So God PUTS HIM THERE. HE DOESN'T SHOW HIM BECAUSE HE NEEDS HIM THERE. HE NEEDS JACOB TO NOT GO GET HIM OUT OF TROUBLE. &gt;&gt; JACOB, YOU NEED TO LET ME DO WHAT I WANT IN HIS LIFE AND NOT WHAT YOU WANT. And it SEEMS CRUEL, BUT GOD HAS TO DO IT THAT WAY BECAUSE HE KNOWS. JACOB, you're going to run run right down there the first chance you get if I tell you. Amen. We don't always see everything, but we know the one that does. And sometimes you don't hear from God. Listen, I'll say this for us that, you know, for believers especially, sometimes you're praying about stuff. You ever, Brother Bruce has taught me about this here a couple years ago. You ever pray about something? Sometimes you pray for something, you're praying for an answer, and God answers just like that. Praise God, I got the answer. Oh, you go out like a warrior. Yeah, we've got the will of the Lord, crushing enemies. But sometimes you pray about something and months go by and years go by and years and years go by and there's certain things you pray about. Listen, there's times, even brother Brandham dealt with this. There's times your life, God feels so far away. This is a vindicated prophet. He's been around the world seven times. preached a king, seen miracle after miracle, discernment after sermon, and yet God feels so far away from him. You prayed and you prayed, the heavens are brass. Amen. We love it when we come to church. We feel the presence of God. The anointing sweeps over US AND WE'RE HAVING A GREAT TIME. NOBODY WANTS TO BE JACOB. WE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN WE SIT quiet and we pray. We don't hear a thing. We don't feel a thing. But I submit to you today, many times as a believer, that's actually when God's the closest to you. Amen. Many times you don't feel God or or sense him or anything at all. Many times that's when he's actually the closest because you're called to walk by faith, not by sight. And many times when God's got his hand on you, that's when you realize it the least. Man, it just feels like I'm in this place right now. Maybe God's put you there for a reason. Maybe he's closer than you realize and you think he's so far away. Amen. That's when you have to listen, even Jesus, brother talk about this. The spirit left him in the garden of Gethsemane and he goes up to the cross and he dies as a man. That's when you've got to know when you don't feel something. Because listen, I I like good feelings, but my feelings have also lied to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't make that a basis for what I believe. I have to see the plan of God for myself. I have to have heard from God. And now he doesn't have to show you everything, but I know enough to trust him. Even like Jesus, he's hanging on a cross, yet he's Think about that now. Jesus is the spirit has left him. Friends have left him. He's suffering like no man has ever suffered. HE'S HANGING ON A CROSS NAKED, REJECTED. WHERE is he at? The very center of the will of God. The worst moment of his life was actually the best moment. Let me say this for me. Maybe you can relate. I can look back at my life. The worst moments of my life, they were actually the best moments of my life. I just didn't realize it at the time. Some of the worst things I ever went through, I look back now, I'm so glad God let me go through that. I wouldn't be who I am today. I wouldn't be where I'm at today if I hadn't gone through that. And if I could go back again now and tell the old me, "Keep going. It's worth it." I would. Amen. If I never had a problem, I wouldn't know that God could solve them. I wouldn't know what faith in God could do. Amen. Many times, it's the best things in our life. Amen. Won't you stand to your feet with me today? Well, this went all over the place. I apologize. Hey. Yeah. Well, like I said, I can do part two if you want. Here, [laughter] let people go eaters. We praise the Lord. Amen. Maybe today you're in a situation like that. I've been there before. All of us have been there at some point. And I'm really going through it right now. It seems like I'm going through the ringer. People don't even know what that is anymore. They don't no longer the ringer really. [snorts] Sound effects help. You're ringing the clothes out. Feels like YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE RINGER, MAN. I just I'm in this spot. I'm going through this and and and you know, nobody likes it. I didn't at the time anyway. [laughter] No, no. Uh correction seems pleasant at the time. That's the time to say, "What is God trying to do in my life?" Amen. We're always trying to figure out what we should do or what we want. God, how does this glorify you? What are you wanting to do in my life? What are you trying to say to me? Don't miss what God's doing. Listen, the worst that God has to offer is still better than the best the world has to offer. Amen. Let's pray. Lord, we thank you today. Sometimes we sit like Jacob even and in our minds we begin to invent. We begin to imagine. We build these scenarios and we convince ourselves of things that you never told us. Lord, maybe we were convinced at one point as sinners. We thought to ourselves, "I couldn't serve God. I I couldn't give up all those things. I couldn't walk away from that. But Lord, I found out I couldn't afford not to. It was all what my mind had told me, all imagination and flesh. But we find today, Lord, as we've read about it, I believe that you're still able to make yourself seen. [snorts] I believe you're still able to declare, Lord, not just a man in this pulpit reading a book today, but that you're real and that you're present and that you're still the same. The same yesterday, today, and forever. still have power today to heal the sick and to raise the dead. YOU HAVE THE POWER TODAY TO cleanse our filthy hands and our filthy hearts and change our lives if we'll just if we'll just seek for it. Lord, now's a time whether we're a Christian, not a Christian, whatever it is today. Lord, we've got a moment here. I believe you're trying to get our attention. Let us fix our hearts at this very moment just now. Let us turn our eyes upon you and consider the Lord of glory. May we not be weary and discouraged today in welloing, but may we press for the prize for the mark of the high calling, Lord, for the different needs that are represented here today. Lord, you have every answer that we would ever need if we only look to you, Lord. Speak to the hearts of these your children now. I pray and bless them we ask. We thank you in Jesus name. Amen. key of F I think it is. You know that song, Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus. Let's just sing that for a moment. Just real sacred for just a moment. I I didn't know the service was going to go kind of this direction, but let's just let's just reverence him for a moment. Amen. Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus. Look full in his wonderful face. And the things of earth will grow strangeely dim in the light of his glory and grace. Oh, turn your eyes upon Jesus. Look full in his wonderful face.

I've had my fill. And yet I hunger [music and singing] still empty and bare. Lord, hear our prayers for more of you. Let's believe it now. More of you, Lord. We're going to receive more of you. I've had it all, but what I need is just more of you. Of things I've had, my fill. And yet I hunger still empty and bare. Lord, hear my prayers for more of you. Amen. If anybody, let's just sing, please. If anybody wants prayer, come forward. Brother Alex will pray with you. He's a man of faith. Amen. pleasing. Let me be pleasing to you.

Deep within my soul, I want to know you. Oh, I want to know you. And I would give my final breath. Know you in your death and resurrection. Oh, I want to know you more. Oh, I want to know you more. Amen. Oh, I want to see him. Oh, I want to see him. I want to see that invisible God. Amen. As I journey through the land, singing as I go, pointing souls to Calvary, to the crimson flow. Many arrows pierce my soul from withoutin. But my Lord leads me on, and through him I must win. Oh, I want to see him look upon his face. There to sing forever of his saving grace on the streets of glory. Let me lift my voice. Cares all pass. Home at last, ever to rejoice when in service for my Lord. Dark may be the night. We heard about it. But I'll cling more close to him. He will give me light. Satan snares may vex my soul. Turn my thoughts.
