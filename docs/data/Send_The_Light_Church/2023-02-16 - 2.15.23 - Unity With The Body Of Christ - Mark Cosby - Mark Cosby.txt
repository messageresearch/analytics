in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen God bless you may be seated let's sing since Jesus came into my heart amen how many is happy since Jesus came in amen just let him know as you sing this all the wonderful change in my life has been raw since Jesus came into my heart I have light in my soul for which long I have sought since Jesus came into my heart [Music] it's Jesus came into my heart since Jesus came into my heart floods of Joy or my soul like the sea below since Jesus came into my heart I'm possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure since Jesus came into my heart and no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure since Jesus came into my heart [Music] came into my heart since Jesus came into my heart floods of Joy oh my soul like the sea below says Jesus came into my heart there's a light now me since Jesus came into my heart and the gates of that City Beyond I can see since Jesus came into my heart since Jesus came into my heart says Jesus came into my heart floods of Joy or my soul like the sea billows oh [Music] he just came into my heart amen I know there was a time that Peter wanted uh Jesus to take care of a situation just come don't don't leave don't die just stay here with us but and we all would want Jesus to take care of certain situations we all got quite a few of them but the greatest thing is for Jesus to come into our heart because he can give his joy in the middle of everything one trade that for nothing amen praise the Lord let's sing lift him up lift him up that's what we want to do amen how to reach the masses every birth for an answer Jesus gave a key and die if I be lifted up from the earth will draw on man unto me lift him up up lift him up Jerry Speaks from eternity and die if I be lifted up from the earth will draw on men unto me oh the world is hungry for the living bread If the Savior up for them to see trust him and do not doubt the words that he said I'll draw on man not to me lifting up lift him up so he speaks from eternity yes he does and I if I be lifted up from the Earth [Music] own exalt the preacher don't exalt the Pew preach the gospel symbol for and free prove him and you will find that promise is true I'll draw all men don't you need [Music] love still [Music] peace from eternity and uh if I be lifted up outer me lift him up by living as a Christian Lord help us Lord let the world end you the Savior see amen will gladly follow him who once thought I'll draw oh man unto me [Music] from eternity and I if I be lifted up from the Earth amen every time we sing that song that last verse is always a challenge to me and I I think it's the way it should be because I don't think we can live too high the higher you live the more you'll draw amen let's stand together and take our offering before the Lord you know the prophet said that no service is complete without an offering amend and I think it would just be perfectly in order to pray over the offerings that we give and that God will go to bless them amen let's just look to the Lord in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we want to thank you for all that you provide Lord sometimes you bless us bountifully and sometimes Lord it is uh we're we're we're looking to you Lord more because we're in a greater need but Lord in everything you know what you're doing and you always you've always provided for your own your word declares that your your children would never go begging bread and father we're here to testify that that is a true that's a true promise and Lord we thank you for all that you provided for us and Lord as we give tonight in the offering we just pray that you would bless the offering that we would give Lord no matter the size I just pray that you would multiply it to meet the needs father the needs of the church and Lord if there'd be any that would be give giving to the the mission view we just pray that you'd bless it for the mission for you Lord we also pray that you just remember Lord the uh our brother that would be ministering here we just pray that you would also bless the offering to meet his needs as well father we commit this offering into your hands and Lord we trust you for all your blessings now Bless The Giver those that give in Jesus Christ name we pray amen cannot give God amen let's sing only believe as our brother comes to give us the Word of Life how many is glad to be here and take take advantage you create an atmosphere so you create the one that you want God to be in amen [Music] all things are possible only believe oh [Music] leave all things are possible only believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe amen how many believe that God has called our brother amen not believe that that God is going to use them to help us tonight we just appreciate his ministry here wow so thanks for those kind words I don't feel worthy of them such an honor and privilege is to be with you guys once again and just to receive Christ we're all receiving it's because I'm ministering I'm still able to receive amen we're working together um brother John he opens up in a word of prayer for the scriptures please my brother Lord we just pray that Lord that each ear would be accompanied by your voice Lord that we would hear Lord not as it were brother Mark's voice but Lord we would hear your voice speaking amen God you would give us Revelation that would help us in our walk with you that we would come closer to you and mourn your image we pray these things now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen we got two scripture readings for receded uh first one is John 17 21 then the second will be in Genesis 11 5-7. so very familiar scriptures so the title of this uh little part two Unity with the body of Christ amen so the first part we talked about Unity with God our Oneness with God and how important it is for us to be one with God before we even know what true Unity really is because God is true unity and for one with God then we can help be one with the body of Christ so go to John 17 verse 21. that they all may be one as thou father are in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me so Jesus is really pointing us to this Oneness and unity that we need to have not with this people you like between one another even the people you don't like in fact amen let's go to Genesis 11. we'll read two verses in there verse 5 and the Lord came to see the city in the tower which the children of men builded and the Lord said behold the people is one notice that statement and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do verse 7 go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech you may be seated so we see we talk a little bit about last week about this uh this verse but we see that man they were trying notice Gods said they were one but it's not the type of Oneness that God was looking for it was a man-made Oneness God bless you Sister Tasha it's wonderful to see you um so we look at this this Unity that God is trying to strive for that he his perfect plan is for and it can't be anything man-made in between it can't be anything of us in there to create that Unity because our nature um is fickled it's it's faulty and it has selfish motives and God's Unity does not have selfish motives it's to make the people one but in his images One his word in one and so we got a quote gotta quite a few coats quotes to go with this I just felt like it was uh just perfect for this you know God has made man to achieve so there's something inside of us that wants to achieve something and we got to make sure that we're achieving what God wants us to because otherwise you'll be in a substitute trying to achieve something that you can never achieve because you're not trying to achieve what God has placed in your heart that desire that that this hunger just to please him so that was what man was made for and all down through life he has tried to achieve something and his achievements the reason he tries that is because he was so designed to do that so we realized we were designed we were fearfully and wonderfully made God made him that way but the trouble of it is and his achievement he tries to do something within himself so we said before we can't do anything with ourselves we got to recognize like our brother Joseph said or where we came from we got to recognize of the cross that Jesus died upon for us so that we could be here tonight and our strength comes from him everything we have comes from him so if we recognize that then we won't lose sight of what we're called for because we recognize that this life that we're living is not for us but it's for him we're here to serve him and serve God's people that's true servitude it's a true a true servant is that's what that that's where he makes this mistake with me there's where he makes his mistake and he gets in trouble that's from the unity of God in the one Church 1958. now in the beginning Genesis which is the sea chapter of the Bible we find in there that when God made a man he made him in the way that he knew that he was supposed to be so God had a made a perfect man in the Garden of Eden and I believe that perfect man was in harmony with God ends with harmony with all creation because that's how when God makes something that's always perfect no flaws no nothing just perfection at his finest he made him in the way that he knew that he was to be and he could never be any greater design than what he was than what he is when he began to make life he made it from the lowest life which is more or less the pollywog the Frog and unto the highest life is man which is the image of God you know I found this other little this little quota says if we can only get in spiritual Unity with his word and with him so God is always pointing us to the word because he is the word amen and so we got to be in line with the word we said the statement before that the word is not going to conform to your life you must conform to the word and so when we do that we throw all of us out and put all of God in here like John the Baptist said I must decrease so he can increase I was really blessed by the word on Sunday what we're doing to you guys is this that statement I remember brother John has talked about how that what Antichrist is is um not the word not being manifested in here and it's just you know so so simple but so profound because that word has to just live inside of us and I just love that the word just has to constantly live inside of us it can't just be on this paper us just reading it but the thing the word that we're reading has to really just sink inside so that we could become what Christ has caused to be which is the word amen so God's plan from the beginning was to have us in harmony with him that's what we're trying to get back to is everything in harmony once again but we're slowly getting back to it we're slowly God is just shaping us refining us and molding us that we can be in harmony with him because when that that great day comes when he comes in the air and takes us up um it's not always going to happen then but everything we're doing every decision we're making is going to lead us to that Rapture because the Rapture is happening right now and we got to make sure that we're ready for that Rapture because any day we could be called home tomorrow you know we I it's my last term like we preaching this today so we got to make sure that our calling and election is sure is so important and a man can achieve better when they're United so we look at the Tower of Babel they were United in one but once again that's not the even God said the Lord came down to see the City verse six and the Lord said behold the people is one but that Oneness like we said before was man-made we look at Hitler Mussolini Stalin Hitler got the people to be one but it wasn't the right kind of Oneness he he his his whole motive was to make everybody like him everybody not sees every all these things and we see that that Unity he got the people to stand with him for a little bit but eventually that whole regime fell just like the Tower of Babel it fell because it was not pleasing to God and God isn't looking for that type of Oneness in the world he's looking to everybody to be American everybody he's looking at everybody to be born In His Image born again and filled with the Holy Ghost and that's the only way we can achieve a Harmony is the spirit of God dwelling inside of us and we've got to bury that old man daily so we could become one with God and one with one another because God's heart is to see the whole body of Christ working together thinly jointed together because if everybody knows if you break something uh say if you get knee surgery you can't walk or somebody's missing a limb they can't walk but the body of Christ we need all of us we need the big toe we need the arm we need the eyes to have the body functioning and I love how that's how God designed it and we're going to make sure we're following that we all need one another I don't care if we're weak strong whatever it is we need one another we got to come together we got to cry together pray together all these things we've got to come together and man can achieve better when they're United notice that now you take one man by himself his power is limited to one man two men makes him twice his strength four men makes him four times his strength and God wants us to be one praise God God made man that we should be one our motives should be one and our objectives should be one and our achievements should be one he just designed that way that's from the unity of God in the one Church let's go to that uh quote reminded me of Deuteronomy 32 verse 30. see the more we can be Unified that's when the devil can't get in but when we're not unified everybody's doing this thing over here that thing over there that's when the devil can get in and slip things in but if we come together but Lord bind us together there's no devil no demon that can stop the bride working in one Unity so Deuteronomy 32 verse 30. amen so it says how should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand the flight except that Iraq has sold them and the Lord had shut them up so it is see that Unity we can chase more we can accomplish more in the kingdom of God and that's why how God designed it he didn't design for to be a one-man show but he decided to be a United show and and the world see it's so it's so hard because Society always points us to it's you you all about you but when you come into Christ it's not all about you anymore it's all about others because the very God Of Heaven humbled himself and became a servant and who do we think we are if we don't match that same image following those same footsteps because God came to serve and we need to come to serve one another we got to wash one another's feet spiritually and physically amen and all these things are going on the spirit of living God is striving with flesh trying to get man away from his own achievements so God is constantly trying to to get us away from looking at all our problems like we can't overcome them he's trying to get us away from being all about ourselves and self-conceited and he's trying to get us to see him and who he is he's a provider he's a Waymaker he's all these things Jehovah Raphael Jehovah Jireh he's all these things he wants to be to us but if we can't get our thoughts over our thoughts off off these problems and issues in our life and put our eyes on him then he can't be those things God wants to be all those things in our life but his hands are going to be tied if we can't have faith in him that he can be those things in our life and so faith is such a key point in a Christian's life it's in fact it's the the foundation of a walk because if you don't have faith you can't even please God and so you got to believe and have faith that the body of Christ here can be one you gotta have faith that God can move in any situation in your life no matter how hard you think it is or impossible you think it is he can part any Red Sea in fact he part of the Red Sea for the children of Israel imagine they had probably thousands of Egyptians chasing behind them and so our God is a mighty God he's a powerful God who can't be stopped I love what Jesus said all power is given to me in heaven and in Earth so let's never forget that amen God is striving with flesh trying to get man away from his own achievement trying to get man away from his own selfish motives just like our pastor preached about this our motives we got to make sure our motives are pure and pleasing to God because a mo a wrong motive will lead you down a wrong path as we saw what happened to David that wrong motive let him down a wrong path and as long as a man Works in his own plan he will be a failure every time as long as a man Works in his own plan he will be a failure any man can only achieve right when he comes back with the right objective and the right emotive one more time a man can only achieve right when he's come back with the right objective and the right motive so if you decide if you want unity in the church don't do it just because brother John said or or somebody else said it but do it because you want to please God that's your sole motive we heard that sermon that brother John preached on your motive has to be to please God don't please somebody don't be a man please or be a god pleaser because the end of the day we're serving God and we're not serving we're serving God not Mammon but while we're serving God we are serving others amen when he comes back with the right objective and the right motive that is according to God's plan for him uh any other Foundation is on sinking Sans amen I just suggest me each read this listen to this sermon I love this um this my brother Brandon the unity of one God and the one church I just suggest to listen to that is such a a beautiful just showing what that Unity really is so we must lay aside what we think Harmony is and Oneness and we need to become in unity with God and his word so we got to lay every thought aside that we think what God wants and just really find out what God really wants because I believe that he's given us a blueprint of what he exactly he wants but that blueprint must be quickened in our heart for us to really uh live it out because how many churches are out how many I think there's over like 30 000 Christian denominations who say they're in the truth and I believe brother Brandon in his time in the 60s it was 900 so I'm not sure what the math is on that but that's a lot of math and we got to recognize that when we're not we're not a man-made Church we're a holy ghost-led church and the Holy Ghost is leading our church here at sin the light and we have to believe that the Holy Ghost is here speak into our hearts and leading us into the spirit of unity with him because on the other side everything is going to be in unity in one that's what God is trying to prepare us for is for that other side amen and we have to recognize that God is love and we need that love to even get over there on the other side we need that love to love one another the proper way because God's love is Limitless our love has its limits it can only love so far but God's love is you could stretch it from Sky to Sky and it still wouldn't even escape the surface of that love so we got to recognize we've got to take our love out and let God's love fill us all the way up and the thing is we must be in great desperation and desire for this Unity it has to be something that you you have to desire for you have to be desperate for and we're going to just pick that up in psalm 63. 63 verse 1. and it says oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee notice this uh this uh what David's saying right here my soul thirsted for thee My Flesh longer for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is how many has been really thirsty and very parched and you just you just needed water you just couldn't live without water that's how David feels when he's seeking and searching for God and that's what we need as well to be one with God and to be one with the body of Christ we got it at his hunger and thirst for that because I believe the the spirit of the the spirit of the Living God wants his people just to be one and this is such a beautiful thing just to see that to see thy power and thy Glory verse two so as I've seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness love loving kindness is like favor is better than life my lips shall praise thee verse 4 thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name verse 5 my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips verse six when I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings will I rejoice I just love the book of Psalms that's one of something that's about the book of Psalms is one of my favorites because you just see a a man after God's Own Heart but you realize that he's human just like you and I and he he had ups and downs and he just wanted God to be present in his life at all times of his life no matter if he messed up he would truly repent and turn away from his ways and I believe we can relate to all these Bible characters because they were like us with like passions and we got to just recognize and see that these men weren't called because they were perfect that's right no but God called them to Perfection just like he's calling his bride which I believe all the bride's here tonight and he's calling us into perfection in that uniting time but we still have work to do while we're in going into perfection amen Ephesians 4. the very familiar scriptures and we'll start with verse one and we'll actually go to verse six sorry about that Anne say Amen when you guys get there I love to hear the the pages turn so verse 1 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord how many are prisoners of the Lord tonight amen amen I love that amen prison of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called so we're called to something much higher than we can even realize a high calling that goes beyond all our emotions and all our feelings when we should be Dishonored and privileged that God would even call us who are we to even be called to in this vocation in this life that we're living verse 2 with all lowliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another in love so I know we all have we all have flaws and we could probably sit here and maybe even Point each other's flaws out but that's not what the love of God does it doesn't point out flaws it doesn't maybe somebody choosing here too loud maybe somebody chooses their mouth open God doesn't look at those things he looks as his bride being one and we don't come together because we all like chicken or we all like hamburgers but we come together because we love God and we love his word and want to see his word fulfilled in our lives in our church in our body and that's why we come together but we got to lay aside everything that's right that is contrary everything that's fleshly and just want what God wants verse 3 endeavoring notice that word endeavoring so it's something you gotta fight you got to fight to keep you you gotta fight to keep peace because the enemy was so loved to take away Unity he was so loved to seek kill and destroy in this church but we got to Endeavor to keep him out we got to be sober be vigilant because our enemy he's crafty and cunning but we serve a god who's powerful who is defeated this creature he's a defeated creature he has no power over you if you're in Oneness with God because if we're Oneness with God then the body of Christ can be won and that enemy is he's false he's a liar keep going this is one body knows this is one body it's not a five-man show a two-man show but it's one body one Spirit even as ye are called and one hope of your calling is talking to all of us verse five one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father over all who's above all and through all and in you all notice all that one one one one one one one he's calling us to Unity to Oneness and we got to recognize that in order for our body to function properly we got to work together if we're on a basketball team and I had the ball and I'm just ball hogging and not passion the ball ever and I may be scoring 40 points but we're losing about 50 points every game there's no chemistry so it's like in sports there has to be a chemistry in order for you to win the gold win a championship so the same thing in the body of Christ there has to be a spiritual chemistry for us to work together not every person not not just one person can just do every single thing in the church that's why God has a set up and established for churches to have many members it's a mini body remember church for a reason so we all can play our part and do our role not everybody be become a minister not everybody can become a deacon everybody become this but there's so many roles that we could become but I know one role that we all are called into is being ambassadors to help one another to encourage one another to disciple one another all these things are part of the body jobs in the body even cleaning the church that's a job so all these things it's not just one thing one one of these things but it's all these things that God is looking at in in a church because in order for a church to work properly there certain roles have to be filled and not everybody can be a Indian or a chief there's Indians you know so we all can't be the head honcho in Chief that's why God has said brother John is a pastor for a reason he was the only man that for the job God chosen for a specific reason to lead us and so we got to trust that the office that God has called him into the Holy Ghost is using Brother John to lead us to the Rapture to lead us to a closer walk with God so we got to have faith in that that the office that he's called in let's go to um Acts 2. 2 so we see in the day of Pentecost we see that they were all in one Accord one mind everything was one it was all about God they all recognize and realize that they they needed that promise before they could become what God wanted them to become they had to be one in order to receive the one Holy Ghost baptism that's a mouthful to say but we see in verse one and when the day of Pentecost was fully come come they were with all one Accord in one place all the people up there was a hundred and some people just imagine they were all in one Accord one Unity and look what happened to them and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house they were sitting and it appeared onto them cloven tongues like it's a fire and it set upon them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance so notice I believe the same thing can happen in our church the Holy Ghost can give us a refilling it could baptize us and that's scriptural because the Holy Ghost baptized them again if you look throughout the Book of Acts and I believe that we need a refilling constantly because we see that Parable with the the wise and the foolish virgins they had some oil in their lamps the foolish but they never got refilled over and over again like the wise did and so I believe that we're wise virgins and I believe we need a refilling daily I believe so we find out going back to the tower Babel and we found out that they've tried to unite they begin to come one person but in this United they did that time it was under political power so we see the UN United Nations they're trying to unite under man-made conditions and they wonder why it doesn't work out because for for instance for one instance every man is right in his own eyes that's number one right there if they'll recognize that how many wars have we been fought over religion you see um all we can name all these great um so-called what they call Great Attila the Hun uh Genghis Khan all these Empires that what fell Napoleon fell all these Powers because they don't recognize and realize that they're going the wrong way to try to bring Unity you can't bring Unity based upon your your selfishness and your selfish motives but you have to go the way God intends for you to make Unity that's why they will always fall kingdoms will always fall under political power Man became one the only objective was one their achievement was one but it was a wrong kind of one because his reason it was against the plan of God but he continued to go on so we see all throughout history man is always trying to rule and unite and every time leaves to death and destruction every single time death and destruction and finally when you when you find Unity amongst the people like that they do great things you just look over the world today when people unified themselves together yet under the wrong plan they do great things so we see Hitler he he conquered a lot of Europe he did these great things that he thought were great but eventually he fell so he they see man when they United together they can do great things they uh automobile airplane uh we got buildings all these things they can do but the problem is they're all perversions of God see that that Unity see the devil is trying to get people in unity as well as well even though his Unity may look like chaos and all these things but his Unity is division yes Discord yes and if he can get people to be in division and Discord then his his plan is working out for Unity and so we got to recognize when the devil is trying to slip something in because when he slips something in that's when division happens isms and schisms and we want to just kick all those things out of our church and just kick Satan out and just want to just put him on blast as they would say yeah now they built a tower which I doubt that modern science could build today with all their machines and things because they were United together they had one Mind One Soul one purpose one mode of one objective now imagine this if they could have all those things in being one imagine what the body of Christ could accomplish could achieve being in one mind one body and one Spirit One Faith one baptism it's imagine the things that we we can't even comprehend that God can do in our church and move in our church just by being one with him and they tried to build a tower so high notice this the uh just notice this the cardinality behind this tower that if God ever took a notion to destroy them again they run them right up into the heavens with them so I just like so so so man recognize and realized that God flooded the Earth right but they don't look and realize why he did that because they were Wicked they were sinful they turned their back from God so now they have this idea where I can build this Tower to Heaven that God if he would try to destroy him again he can't but this is so this is God they don't realize how powerful God is they run up them right into Heavens with him and there'd be no way that they could keep him from doing it or he could keep them from doing it as they thought and we find out that they organize themselves together and we find them again completely out of the will of God see if man would just surrender and submit itself to the Living God they would avoid so Much Death and destruction unnecessary death and destruction in this world but we know what Spirit they're influenced by and whoever you yield yourself servant to your servant to go to Psalms 133. and we'll read verses one through three it's very familiar scripture you guys say Amen when you get there behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity I mean I love that read that again behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity verse two it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of His Garment as the Dew of Herriman and as the Dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commanded the blessings even life forevermore so we notice how displeasing it is for God's bride to dwell together in unity I believe it just pleases his heart it touches his heart because he feels welcome there because it's only love there and not division but it's love I'll look the word of unity I was just curious what um I like using the Webster's I think 1828 dictionary I just I just love this to just the words because a lot of times they nowadays they change the words and all these all these things but this is the definition that it gives it Unity of spirit is the Oneness which subsists between Christ and his Saints by which the Same Spirit dwells in both and both have the same deposition and aims and is the Oneness of Christians among themselves United under the same head I love as having the same Spirit dwelling in them and possessing the same Grace Faith Love and Hope and Etc and in another definition the state of being one Oneness Unity May consist of a simple or existing between as the soul but it usually consists in a close Junction of particles or parts Consulting a body detached from other bodies Unity is a thing undivided itself but separate from every other thing so the world is just pushed out and it's all Unity I love that let's go back to um Ephesians 4 again so it is seeing in heaven there has to be unity and Oneness so we see somehow the devil was able to get a third of the Angels so he was able to get them in unity and Oneness with his uh selfish plan and we see that as we see we got to recognize how cunning our enemies like I said before if we don't recognize we got to realize that he's a good enemy and we got to recognize that we cannot defeat him ourselves and we can only defeat him through the power of God and God is the only one who can defeat the Devil in fact he's defeated him already he's a defeated creature and if we can recognize that more than more we can say boo back to the devil and we got to realize and recognize that God is using the devil for us to get closer to God through the fiery trials opportunity for us to get christ-like character so the devil isn't going to realize that he's being used to help us get one step closer to the Rapture I'm saying one more time the devil doesn't realize that he's being used to help us to get one step closest to the rapture so we should be glory in our tribulations and our trials because it's taking us one step closer to being eternally in the presence of God never to leave no more sorrow over there I love that what a day glorious day that will be amen uh let me get to Ephesians 4. can we uh put up verse 1 Ephesians 4 verse 1. therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called I look at the word vocation up among divines a calling by the will of God I love that so you're called by the will of God I love that or the bestowment of God distinguishing Grace upon a person or Nation by which that person or nation is put in the way of Salvation as a vocation of the Jews under the old dispensation and the Gentiles under the gospel verse 2. with all lowliness and meekness with long-suffering forbearing one another with love so there's going to be before we're called home I guarantee you one of us is going to say something that's gonna hurt a little bit it could be uh whatever it could be you fill in the blank it could be something love through scripture or it could be something we just weren't in the right spirit and we said something bad and we got to be willing to Long suffer we gotta be willing to forgive because it's it's actually so much harder actually to hold on to a grudge it actually hurts you more than you realize you holding on to The Grudge and it's we look in the scripture Jesus said in Matthew 6 let's go to that Matthew 6. it'll go with a verse 15 6 15. but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses so for not feel for not willing to forgive then how can God forgive us because I guarantee you we did so many things to hurt him in fact when he died upon that cross he bore every sin Hallelujah every lie everything every addiction that you had he bore on the cross for you and you you see what he said he said father forgive them they know not what they do he didn't say how dare you mark for doing this uh when you were 15 years old or 17 years old he doesn't look at those things what he looks as is that finished product when he died upon that cross he he saw a finished product of you a Finnish Masterpiece of you so he's constantly sculpting us molding us and just shaping that that perfect sculpture because he knows exactly what it's going to look like he's just refining it and he's building it until that day when it's complete completely finished amen you take a fine piece of Machinery like a watch and let every piece of that Machinery work in harmony notice that in order for even a car to work properly all the Pistons the engine has to be set properly the tires have to be on properly every piece has to be in order in order for a car to fully function and if not the check engine light is going to come on or the car might not start so we we got to recognize and just kind of type that because if if the see the world is trying to type something that God is already perfect see the world is trying to mimic God Satan is always trying to mimic God uh we got Carl's the horsepowers and they still use horsepower we got a man over here trying to rush her trying to conquer the world all these things we see man is trying to do which is a perversion of what God has already done it's very forever settled in heaven and we have to recognize we can't take a substitute for what God has already because any substitute will leave you wanting and lusting for more but if it's what God has given you it will fill you up your cup will overflow as the scripture tells us but when one piece gets one way in one another it won't keep time no matter how good the jewels are it's all got to be unified together we look at our bodies everything has to be in unity your brain has to be put in the right signals to your body for your heart to pump and then your brain has to move so your legs can do this so we see all the how God has made the body it's beautiful the anatomy of a body and now we look at the anatomy of a spiritual body of Christ how beautiful it is when it's all working together in harmony God just begins to pour blessings he begins to answer prayers he begins to see things can be hindered when we leave things undone in our life so we got to make sure that every stone is unturned so God can move freely in our church and that's God's purpose for us to unify together and be one let's go to Ephesians 4 16. amen For Whom the whole body notice right here fitly jointed together it doesn't say off-centered doesn't say the legs over here missing and the big toes over here what it says from whom the whole body fitly jointed together notices and compacted by that which every all of us joint supplyeth according to the factual effectual working in the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so it takes love for the body of Christ to be fitly jointed together we can't say this person is better than this person that person is better than that person but we're all big important inside of God God all loves us the same he doesn't love you more than he loves you or me he loves you with all his heart so we got to recognize that that it's it's not about how how big we are or how little we are it's just about how big is God in our life how big are we making God in our life that's what the most important thing is you see the center of your life or is he just a part of your life say it one more time is he the center of your life or is he just a part of your life see God desires to be the center of all that you do not just 98 not 99 but a hundred percent of your life verse 17. this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that he henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart so we saw these dictators and everything that's the reason why they're blinded and God God said he'll give you over to to believe a lie if you want to and so we have to recognize and realize that that we need to our minds to be clear we need our minds to be free from the devil we could the greatest spell ever thought is in your mind and if Satan get one thought in there and get you to feed on it then he has you but we got to be like brother like the brother John said in John 4 1 you got to try the spirit we can't decide anything that's coming to our minds we got to be willing to if a negative thought comes in about a brother you kick it out and you pray for that brother or sister because prayer because getting the presence of God all those thoughts will vanish away but we got to kick him out though that's the thing God isn't going to do it for you because you're a Son of God or a daughter of God alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart verse 19 who being passed feeling have been giving themselves over until lasciviousness to work all uncleanliness uncleanness with greediness but ye have not so learned Christ it's time it's talking to us but you have not so long Christ I love that if so be that you've heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus how many believe they have been heard him and been taught by him how many believe that tonight says that you put off concerning the former conversation of the old man we got to bury that old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lust no to verse 23 right here and be renewed in the spirit of your mind so you don't have to your mind does not have to be a Devil's Playground amen amen your mind can be dedicated to God your mind can be dedicated to just positive thoughts about others about just seeing a vision of others coming into uh the unity with Christ but we got to lead by example though we can't just talk the talk we gotta walk the walk we heard that saying before so and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man I love that which after God is created in righteousness and truthness in verse 25 wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor if we are members one of another for we are members one of another let's go to Philippians 2. so if they're yeah if there'd be there for any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels in mercies verse 2 fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded it's not talking about the like-mindedness of you like Cedar Point I like Six Flags it's not that kind of you like Chevy's I like GMC's or you like Chevys I like the Ferraris no none of that stuff matters not talking about that it's talking about spiritual mind spiritual Accord spiritual Oneness so it's the same love those have the same love so we've got to have that love of Christ in US because our love only goes so far but the love of Christ will mend or men something that we thought that couldn't be mended amen it will create something atmosphere that we thought that never could be created we gotta recognize that God can he doesn't patch up he makes new we got to recognize that he doesn't patch up he makes new so it says of one Accord of one mind verse three let nothing be done through Strife or vainglory so when we're doing something for God we're not here to get an award or have a standing ovation or flowers thrown but we're here for God to get the glory and honor let him get all those things let him get praised and worshiped says but loneliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves one more time let each esteem other better than themselves let's edify one another let's build one another up and not tear down because the enemy job is to tear one another down if he can get us to bite and devour then the unity can't be had in a church but if we take that out of a church the body and devouring and just coming together and loving one another the natural in unity can be truly achieved the way God wants it to be verse 4 looking at every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others verse five I believe reverse five is so important this is that's the mind he was talking about in uh verse two that you be like-minded that's what he's talking about right here let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus imagine we all have the mind of Christ and guess what the mind of Christ did it served it was willing to take weapons beatings it was willing to uh be ridiculed it was willing to suffer for living for God so that that Minds in us then it's going to strive and look for how to get more unity in a church it just has to be that's the mind of Christ who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but look at verse 7 says the very God Of Heaven came off his throne came out from being worshiped in heaven to being to made himself no reputation he didn't care about reputation all he cared about was you and I all he cared about was you and I being like him he became you that we could become him but made himself no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross we got two more scriptures and we'll close first Peter 3 or First Peter 1 3 because there's no such thing as first Peter three three Peter don't worry I'm not making scriptures up I promise verse 8. notice this finally be all of One mind I love that mind of Christ having compassion notice that one of another love as Brethren be pitiful and be courteous not rendering evil for evil or rallying for rallying but contrast blessing knowing that you are there and to call that you should inherit a blessing so when somebody does you wrong don't do wrong back to them because that's not that's not christ-like the devil does things like that says for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil like you said brother Jonathan power and life in the death of tongue in his lips that they speak no guile verse 11. let him eschew evil and do good let him speak peace and ensue it and the word issue means to flee from to shun to avoid in verse 12 for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil amen and our last person will close Matthew 22. verses 37-39 say Amen when you get there is that it this one person [Laughter] Jesus said unto them thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment so knows that's why we're talking about in the first service the Oneness we got to make sure that we're loving God with everything that we have and the thing only we could truly love God obviously we could play that part and we play that part he can fill you with his love so you can reciprocate that love back to him precipitate that perfect love back to him because we can only love so much but when God gives us that love we can love Limitless because it's his love dwelling inside of us verse 39 and the second is like unto it thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself so if you're truly loving God with all your heart with all thy soul and all thy mind then you can truly love your neighbor it's just because you can't say you hate your brother and have love of God and you the scripture tells it's impossible so if you're truly loving God truly seeking God with all your heart then that love is going to be in you so richly that you can't stand to even think one thought negatively about your brother about your neighbor out there on these two Commandments saying all the law and the prophets think about that on these two Commandments saying all the law and the problem we're following these two Commandments right there then all the other Commandments are going to fall in line see Jesus didn't have this name all every single commandment because if you're following these two Commandments is going to be organic because he says I'll write the laws upon your heart even says in Ezekiel I want to give you a new spirit a new heart then he says I put my spirit in you he's going to write the I love that just write those Commandments you're going to be following line with God and so he's had to recognize how important it is for a body to function together we have to come together set aside any differences or dislikes and just come together because we come together and pray for one another that prophecy can be fulfilled in our church and I believe it will be fulfilled this year I believe it but we got to just humble ourselves and come together everyone I have to humble myself everybody we got to just come together we'll get to stand and disinvite sister Sherlock and we'll just uh we'll just sing when sister show gets there just Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus we keep our eyes on him and we'll be successful have a successful spiritual walk have a healthy spiritual walk [Music] Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus look full in his wonderful thing is and the things of Earth will go strangely down in the light alive is glory and grace turn your eyes Upon Jesus look full in his wonderful faith [Music] anything's over we'll go strangely dim [Music] and Jesus continues to play that soft listens by our heads oh Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for you being here tonight Lord just thank you Lord for your word just thank you for just pointing us Lord to how important Unity is Lord Lord just please forgive me Lord anything that I've done Lord to not help establish that Lord Lord let us from this day forth let us work together as one body Lord one hope one Accord One Faith

individuals we want and needs you Lord Jesus we can't do this without you we can't have Unity or Oneness without you we're doing this because we want to please you and only you Lord may you be I pray father you'll be pleased Lord with your children Lord as we would just strive for this on a daily basis Lord may we love one another Lord may we not pick and choose and have respective persons of love when we when we love Lord because we're not looking at the outside we're looking at that person's soul that's how much we would love them Lord and father help us to be disciples help us to be ambassadors help us to be all the things that your word is calling us to be Lord and Lord you're calling us the things that we never have been but Lord you can lead us and guide us into those things and we have faith Lord help us Lord Jesus I pray we need you Lord and we ask all these things in Jesus Christ and we pray amen oh God is so good good God is so good let them let them let to know God is so good he's so good to me how many can declare that God answers prayers God answers prayers God answers prayers he's so good to me oh I love him so let him know tonight [Music] I love him so I
