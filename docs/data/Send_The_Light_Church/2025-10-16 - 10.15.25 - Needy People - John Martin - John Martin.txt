White as snow. White as snow. Though my sins were a scarlet, Lord, I know. Lord, I know that I'm clean and forgiven through the power of your blood. Through the wonder of your love, through faith in you, I know that I can be white as snow. Just think about it. White as snow. White as snow. Though my sins were as scarlet, Lord, I know. Lord, I know that I'm clean and forgiven through the power of your blood. Through the wonder of your love, through faith in you, I know that I can be white as snow, white as snow, white as snow. Though my sins were a scarlet, Lord, I know. Lord, I know that I'm clean and forgiven through the power of your blood. Through the wonder of your love, through faith in you. white as snow. Amen. Let's just thank the Lord for his blood. Heavenly Father, we just thank you, Lord, for the blood that we can stand here today white as snow. Lord, for Lord, though our sins were as scarlet, Lord, you are the one that makes us clean and whole again. And Lord, by your grace, we all can stand here as people that have been washed by the precious blood of the lamb today. God, we thank you that that power is just as strong as the day that it was shed at Calvary. Lord, that we could bathe in it today and that we be washed in it today. We could stand here and just have faith in you, Lord. Oh God, come now. Just meet the needs in our midst. We worship you and we thank you for these things in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you would to the book of St. John chapter 15 and and also Philippians chapter 4. Last service we had three scripture readings. This service we have two. As you're turning, we just want to welcome Sister Cynthia Seraniano with us here today. Um what a blessing. We miss brother &gt;&gt; Roel. &gt;&gt; Actually, I was you had sent a a clip to me. Um, and I was looking for it because I wanted to play play part of that here and for some reason it wasn't on my phone. So, um, I waited too long to look. But, um, how would you like to just say praise the Lord, sister? [Laughter] You can say more if you'd like. I should have like warned you I was going to call on you. It's a a great blessing to have you and a great honor to have you with us. Amen. And let's um just uh read two scriptures here. Um the first one is in um St. John chapter 15 verse number five. Jesus speaking, saying, "I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit. For without me, you can do nothing." &gt;&gt; And then Philippians chapter 4 verse 19, no verse 13. Uh Paul reading to the Philippian church. I can do all things through Christ which strengthenth me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just if we could um look to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you for thy word. Thy words are spirit and they are life. And we've come to your house today to receive the living word into our lives, Lord, and to to be drawn closer to you and to to know you by experience a little bit more than when we came. Father, I pray that you would bless each one that has made it out to the service today. May your anointing continue to be with them, be upon them. Give them ears to hear. Lord, take this unworthy servant of yours, Lord, and bless these lips that they would speak the words of life to each of those ears. We pray that you'd be with those that are not able to be here today, but are uh afflicted by some way. Just ask that your Holy Spirit would supply the need that is needed for their bodies, Lord. and comfort them and help them. We commit the furtherance of this service and trust you for your anointing. Now we pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And God bless you. May be seated. We want to entitle this uh needy people. We are needy people. We will always be needy people. And for a subject we want to talk about we were never made to make it on our own. &gt;&gt; God has so arranged things in life that we are totally helpless without God. The Bible even tells us that a man at his very best is all vanity. So from our birth uh we have become very dependent on someone. take our every one of us that when we were born uh we didn't we weren't born and then just you know get over I'm taking over this is what I want to eat and this is what I want to do and this is where we're going. &gt;&gt; We were helpless if it wasn't for mom or the the dad or the the hospital or wherever we were. Uh we would be dead. I mean we we we totally were dependent on somebody. And as we grew up, even though we were 6 months old and we were still dependent and uh as a child um we we grow, we still are dependent and uh we have this age of 18 that the the children are dependent upon the parents until that age and then they're that on their own. Um uh so we can see naturally that um we were born needing someone to help us naturally all through life. It wasn't for our parents uh we would have turned out terrible. Right? So our parents helped us and u most of of us here feel that our our parents could have did a better job. But that's that's just normal, right? Because and then we have children and then we look at how they turn out and we see, well, I thought I did better than my parents. And we're just very needy of the Lord. So it is spiritually. We we cannot make it on our own without God. And we were never made to make it uh on our own without God. We were born in sin, shapen in iniquity. And we just want to read a few verses here in Psalms 51:5. Behold, I was shapen in iniquity. I was shapen in it. And in sin did my mother conceive me. Behold, thou desires truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden parts. Thou shalt make me to know wisdom. Purge me with hissup, and I shall be clean. Wash me, and I shall be wider than snow. We were never made to make it on our own. Make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice. Hide thy hide thy face from my sin and blot out my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. If it wasn't for God, where would we be? We were never made to make it on our own. Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free spirit. Then I shall teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says that by nature we were the children of wrath even as others. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 5653:6 says all we like sheep have gone astray. We have turned everyone to his own way. And the Lord laid upon Jesus the iniquity of us all. &gt;&gt; We We're like sheep that need a shepherd. &gt;&gt; And if God had not put in in in uh come looking for us, we would still be lost &gt;&gt; because there was nothing in us to go looking for God. Even though there was a seed inside of us, it couldn't sprout out until God overshadowed us &gt;&gt; and and let us know the ego scream. &gt;&gt; We're totally dependent on God. &gt;&gt; Doing our own thing, as we learn, is iniquity. Brother Brandham said in the message power of transformation he said iniquity is something that you know that you ought to do and you won't do it. &gt;&gt; You know better but you won't do it. It's iniquity. See knowing what you ought to do and you refuse to do it. So if the Bible says forsake not the summoning of yourselves together and all the more you see the day approaching and you do forsake the assembling of yourselves together, you are walking in iniquity. Now the the Bible tells us plainly that if you're going to do that that God's not going to hear your prayer. &gt;&gt; How many people are doing what they want to do thinking that God's still with them. So, we we learned a little bit that uh iniquity could be not worshiping God in church. &gt;&gt; And uh we we learned that uh Satan has literally filled the sanctuaries with iniquity. you know, people would rather be um come to church and be entertained &gt;&gt; and and and have enjoyment &gt;&gt; uh than to follow what the scripture says. So, no matter uh where we're at, we need God. We need God to cleanse us of our iniquity, cleanse us of our transgressions on a regular basis. By the way, &gt;&gt; amen. On a regular basis. Now, we have power to be transformed by the renewing of our mind. &gt;&gt; We just take a different attitude. &gt;&gt; The right mental attitude will change a lot of situations. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says it'll bring every divine promise of God to pass. So if we're predestinated, then we need to turn around our thinking if it's going the wrong way. Right? Second Timothy chapter 2 verse 19 sells tells us, "Let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity." So depart from the attitude of even though I know I I should do this, I don't want to do it. to turn away from that and say if that that's what I should do, I'm going to do it. &gt;&gt; And we have that power to change our situations by just changing our attitude. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 53:5 says he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. So our our transgressions are the crossing of God's rules. Just crossing the boundaries of what God said, crossing the word. Whereas iniquity is is is not doing the things that we know we should do. And and the Bible says that the way of a transgressor is hard. &gt;&gt; You take somebody that's just constantly just ignoring the word and crossing the word. They're they're if you look at their life, they got a hard life. &gt;&gt; But Calvary paid the price for all of our sins. Now it does. It does uh pay the price for our future sins if we walk in the light, &gt;&gt; right? Because in the past, remember when we came to Christ the first time, we didn't even know the light. &gt;&gt; So, it wasn't required for us to walk in, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We just accepted the blood of Calvary. But once we come to Christ, we learn the ways of God. He expects us to walk in them. And he says if it if we don't, it'd be better if you didn't know it &gt;&gt; than to know it and to walk away from it. &gt;&gt; So we walk in the light as he is in the light. Then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all of our sins. &gt;&gt; So see, the blood of Calvary still cleanses us, but God requires more for us. &gt;&gt; But we were never made to make it on our own. In in uh Genesis 3:15, I'm just going to quote it. This is the first prophecy about um Calvary here. And I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel. The only purpose I'm trying to say is God even telling us right after the fall, look, I'm going to make a way for you. You're not you were never made to make it on your own. Ephesians 2:4 says, "But God, who is rich in mercy for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, he's quickened us together with Christ. By grace you are saved and have raised us up uh together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." God, that the Holy Spirit has has brought us to the place that we are in our life today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen to that? I believe that 1 Peter chapter 2 24 says, "Who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness by whose stripes we were healed. For we were as sheep going astray, doing our own thing, but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of our souls. So now we're returned because God drew us to where we needed to be. With the help of the Lord, we've returned back to God. We were never made to make it on our own. I'm just going to say this, but at any time we can go astray. &gt;&gt; If we don't abide in Christ, we don't abide in the vine, we don't walk in the spirit, if we don't stay where we need to stay, then we get off of God's territory and uh we can go astray. And all you got to do is take a look at yourself at any time that you saw yourself backsliding. We can't blame that on God, right? Because God said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you." &gt;&gt; So, it had to be us. So I the this whole thing of this message is to try to get us to be more dependent on the Lord to look to the Lord to be more dependent instead of feeling we can make it on our own. Romans 3:10 says it is written there is none righteous know not one. There is none that understandeth. There is none that seeketh after God. So God shown us here what happens if we don't seek after God. They are all gone out of the way. They are allto together become unprofitable. There is none that doeth good. Know not one. God is the only thing that can keep our life straight. &gt;&gt; The only thing he sent the Holy Ghost to keep our life straight. We were never made to make it on our own. God does not want us to lean to our own understanding. That's right. our own wisdom, our own intellect, our own knowledge to make it through life. He doesn't want that. He wants us to look to him. Proverbs 3:1, "My son, forget not my law, but let thine heart keep my commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee. Uh let not mercy and truth forsake thee. Bind them about thy neck. Write them upon the tables of thy soul. Shalt thou find favor and good understand the sight of God in men? Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own understanding. See, we were created not to make it on our own. The very our very beings, we we we've the quicker that we just get away from trying to handle everything oursel and look to the word. What does the word say? do what the word says. The quicker we can do that, the quicker we can get on solid ground. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. &gt;&gt; Be not wise in thine own eyes. Fear the Lord and depart from evil. &gt;&gt; See, God's saying, don't be wise how you look at yourself that you can handle the situation. You were not created to make it on your own. You go out there, you're going to see you're going to fail. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 59:19. I like this. The Bible says, "When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall raise up a standard against him." &gt;&gt; That's letting us know that we were not made to make it on our own. that God has set something there to fight against the devil. And we all have the devil come and beat us up, try to take us down, try to slip us up, banana peels, however you want to say it. But we are promised that God has provided something that we're not on our own. &gt;&gt; We don't have to feel alone. We're not left on our own. that God is there to make a way of whatever our situation is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; James 4:6, "But he giveth more grace, wherefore he saith, God resists the proud, but giveth grace to the humble." &gt;&gt; Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. There it is. We were not made to make it on our own. Submit yourself therefore to God and then you'll have the strength to resist the devil and the promise is he'll flee. I mean we have all experienced that we want the devil off our back. Here it is. Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to thee. Draw nigh to God and he'll draw nigh to thee. Cleanse your hands you sinners. Purify your hearts, ye double-minded. Be afflicted, mourn, weep, and let your laughter be turned to mourning, your joy to heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. God so arranged it that we cannot make it through life without him. Can't be successful. Not if you're a child of God. If you're in the world, you can prosper. You can prosper as a sinner, but when you belong to the Lord, if you're not where you need to be, God has so arranged it that he'll get you to look to him. Ezekiel chapter 36. Ezekiel chapter 36 26. God has promised us something so we don't have to make it on our own. He says, "A new heart also I give you. A new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will put my spirit within you, and I will cause you to walk in my statutes, and you shall keep my judgments and do them, and you shall dwell in the land that I give your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God. See, we were never made to make it on our own. God has already said, "I am going to give you my spirit. You're going to live with my spirit. You're going to live with my heart. My spirit. My heart. A heart of flesh. One that is pliable, but one that is tender. One that is not stubborn, rebellious, disobedient, not caring about the the right things. I'm going to give you a heart that cares. I'm going to give you a spirit that that says, "I want to please you, Lord. I will I want to do your commandments, Lord. I don't want to be a transgressor. I I I I don't want iniquities. God promised us himself. When he promised us the Holy Ghost, he promised us himself. Think about that. The God of creation living inside you. &gt;&gt; No wonder, Brother Brandon said, "There's enough power inside you to go create a world, live on it." It's God. &gt;&gt; It's God. John 14:15 says, "If you love me, keep my commandments." We were never made, understand this, we were we were never created, we were never made to keep God's commandments by ourself. &gt;&gt; We need God inside of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will pray the father. Verse 16. And he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever. We were not made to make it on our own. He promises another comforter. God has created us to walk in his spirit. Not our spirit, not our ways, but his spirit. And we're to have another comforter. Oh, you talk about being fearless. You talk about not worrying about anything. You talk about let the bombs let let anything happen that's going to happen. If you got the comforter, you're okay. &gt;&gt; St. John 14 verse 26. St. John 14:26. But the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, it's the same thing. The comfort of the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name. He's going to teach you all things and bring all things to remembrance whatsoever I've said unto you. So, we weren't made to figure everything out on our own. We're not to look to humans to teach us how to live for God because God sending himself to live inside of us to teach us all things. The Holy Ghost is our teacher. &gt;&gt; We were made to be taught by God all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love this. We were made to be taught by God all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, no matter what it is that you're facing, God's got the answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's got the uh the the solution to the problem. God's got the victory. God's got the deliverance. God's got the help. God is our answer. No, not just some things, not just spiritual things, but I'm telling you, God can be your wisdom and how to handle natural things in life. &gt;&gt; That's right. Verse 27. Peace I leave with you, and peace I give unto you. Not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. So God is through this comforter. There's going to be a peace because now we can rely on God. We don't have to rely on human beings. We can rely on God and he's our peace. Because on the world, you got to rely on somebody to get peace. &gt;&gt; You have to rely on another human being. Circumstances got to be right. Everything's got to be just perfectly in order. I'm not going to get thrown in the lion's den of the fiery furnace. There's no giant for me to face. &gt;&gt; Okay, I got peace. &gt;&gt; Nations are okay. &gt;&gt; But the peace that God gives you, things could be blown up in front of you, but something inside, whoa, there's a peace that passes understanding. &gt;&gt; We were never made to make peace on our own. &gt;&gt; God is our peace. He is the prince of peace. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he is our peace. &gt;&gt; He is our source of peace. I to give another scripture on God teaching us. It's in 1 John chapter 2 26. 1 John chapter 26. These things I write unto you concerning them that seduce you. Okay. These things I write unto you concerning them that seduce you. Now, who's that going to be? Somebody that seduces you is someone who is trying to outsmart, outwit, manipulate, control. But it starts in the spiritual realm as demons and demonic spirits, false anointings, principalities, rulers in in darkness, spirits that lie to us. They get inside of people. They lie. They become fake impos in impersonators and imposters and we don't know it because they're smiling. [Laughter] They're they're saying, "Boy, I like your tie. They're you don't always know them by what their words say, how they're dressed. They could be in sheep's clothing uh Jesus said, but inwardly they're a wolf. So these things I write unto you concerning them that seduce you, but the anointing which you have received of him abides in you. &gt;&gt; And you need not that any man teach you. &gt;&gt; So who cares about these seducers? But as the same anointing teaches you all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it have taught you, you shall abide in him. So our job is to abide in the Holy Ghost. Our job is to abide in the word. Our job is to abide in the love of God. We have a part to play in order for the teacher to teach us &gt;&gt; because brother Brandon made it real clear that if we decide we're going to go do our shenanigans that the Holy Spirit was going to lift off of us and he's going to go sit there on a on a on a pole or a line and he's going to wait for us to get done acting so worldly. That's what he said. Now, that ain't God leaving us because he promised never to leave us. That's us leaving God. And God says, "Okay, you made a choice." &gt;&gt; That's why we got to keep seeking more Holy Ghost until we get to the place that we become sealed with this Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; until the day of redemption. &gt;&gt; And too many people just fall short in in in getting more and more of God. So you have a major part to play that God is going to be with you. We just can't do whatever we want and claim that he's not leaving us. We got to abide in the word continuously. Always checking up, always making sure. Brother Ram says, "Turn over every rock. Make sure. Make sure." &gt;&gt; Not assume. To assume is to venture without authority. And to to think that everything's okay without checking is a false sense of security. Now remember the the Pharisees, they were very selfrighteous. They were also hypocrites and they felt secure. They felt so secure they were able to come up to Jesus and say, "Who do you think you are?" They didn't even recognize the word of God. So, we just want to stay humble. God gives grace to the humble. John 15 26 next chapter. But when we're still speaking of the Holy Ghost here, this we're never able to make it on our own. We weren't made that way. But when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from my father, even the Spirit of truth which proceeds from the Father, he's going to testify of me. In other words, if the Holy Ghost is speaking through you, you're not going to be speaking about yourself. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be about you. It's going to be about God &gt;&gt; because that's what Jesus said. And you also shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning. So something inside of us is going to also bear witness of it. All right. Next chapter 16. Chapter 16 of St. John verse 7. Nevertheless, I tell you, it is expedient for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you. But if I depart, I will send him unto you. So we remember the disciples were so afraid that Jesus was leaving. Let not your heart be troubled. Everything's going to be okay. I'm not going to leave you by yourself because you were not made to make it on your own. That's what he's telling his disciples. He says, "But I'm going to send you another comforter, but it's going to be him in spirit form." &gt;&gt; So, we got the same Jesus inside of us that walked the shores of Galilee. &gt;&gt; Amen. that that that that literally spoke the stars into existence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where he could say, "Where were you, Job?" When the stars shouted for joy, &gt;&gt; we were with God. And when he is come, verse eight, and when he has come, when this comforter is going to come, he is going to reprove the world of three things. sin, righteousness, and judgment. So, this job of the comforter is to reprove you. I just want to get this story straight. This, if you look that word up, reprove, it means to conflute. Confute, which means to prove that you're absolutely wrong. The job of the comforter is to prove that you're absolutely wrong. to convict, convince, to tell a fault, to rebuke or reprove. That is going to be the job of the comforter. &gt;&gt; Now, we think of comforting like it's going to be okay. &gt;&gt; I'm with you. But here's the thing. When you're born with an evil nature that's totally selfish &gt;&gt; and the only thing you think about is what you want, &gt;&gt; you need something to help you get away from that nature. &gt;&gt; From living for yourself to living for others. &gt;&gt; You need something to help you with that. And it can't be a person. &gt;&gt; God sends the Holy Ghost in your life. He sends something on the inside of you that says, "Whoa, that's not right." That tells you a fault. That convicts you. That reproves you. That that that says you're doing something that's absolutely not according to the scriptures. And we we testify of that as the comforter. &gt;&gt; That's someone that's telling us the right way to go. that's leading and guiding us into the all truth. Because as a unconverted person, we're in total sin. &gt;&gt; And it's not a matter of just, oh, I accept Jesus as my savior. Jesus wants to come inside of us by the form of the Holy Spirit. And we begin to talk like him, walk like him, act like him, start doing things that he wants us to do. &gt;&gt; And you know, our nature is to do what God wants, but it's also to do what we want. And there's struggle that's going on inside of us. And then we wonder why we're having some problems when we're trying to do good. And and but here's the thing, God wants to be Lord of everything, &gt;&gt; right? He he he just doesn't want to be our savior, but he wants to be lord of everything. So it's crucial that we seek the Holy Ghost. Without the Holy Ghost, we're depending on what? We're depending on our own ability to be a good enough Christian. We're we're depending on uh what the what on two days a week coming to church and hearing the preacher what he's got to say. No, it ain't going to work to make a rapture. We need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And we and I'll say to everyone that's got the Holy Ghost, we need more Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We need more Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I don't think God would ever say to one human being in existence, you have enough. &gt;&gt; You have enough. I will say this when it's all over. We will hear the words well done. &gt;&gt; But what he told the prophet, you need to be more sincere. What? Four years before he passed away. You're you're you're just you're just you're just getting started. Press on. &gt;&gt; What what what Paul say? I I haven't attained. I'm still pressing towards the mark. So, I really feel that God is he's always pulling us closer to him and and I don't think we should be afraid of the comforter because he's going to reprove us. That's his job. No wonder the church world has to bring some sort of entertainment into the church &gt;&gt; to make them feel good. &gt;&gt; No wonder our church here isn't fun for our flesh. We should better say amen to that. &gt;&gt; If the comforter shows up, there's going to be some proving that's going on inside of us. &gt;&gt; I remember, you know, there was a a woman that was caught in adultery. And the man was caught in adultery, too. But for some reason, they wanted to crucify the woman. And they brought the woman before the elders and before Jesus. And they were all expressing how she was a did something worthy of death according to the word of God. And they were pointing right in the word. This is what the Bible say. This is what the word says. This is what Moses says. And then they looked to Jesus and they said, "Jesus, what do you say?" And Jesus full of wisdom from above. Not worldly wisdom, but wisdom from above. He said, "Let him I I agree with the word that you're just saying." So let him that's without sin, let let him be the one that cast the first stone. &gt;&gt; And they all began to think, "Whoa, I wasn't caught in adultery, but I'm I'm guilty. I can't cast the stone. And the from the oldest person to the youngest, they began to drop their stones. And when they dropped their stones, they had nothing to accuse. So they walked away. And they all walked away. And Jesus was left with the woman. What made them walk away? The Holy Ghost came and reproved &gt;&gt; the sin in their life without speak without even calling it out. &gt;&gt; That's the power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It can speak right to our hearts without calling it out. &gt;&gt; I'm sure Jesus could have called out every one of their sins. &gt;&gt; What about this? What about this? What about this? What about this? But he didn't. That's not that's that's not how you do it. We love the comforter. &gt;&gt; We love him when he speaks to us. We if we if we do not have him on the inside directing our life, then it's us directing the ship, us directing the car, us directing the train. We're just not going to make it to our desired rapture. We need the word of God. It's why the prophet could say to us, we come to church to learn spiritually now where we're at with him. That's why we come to church to learn where we're at with him because the Holy Spirit will speak to our hearts. All right, let's continue on. Verse N, he's going to reprove the world, the worldly nature inside of us of sin because they notice they believe not on me. Did you know the spirits that Okay, I don't know when you all got converted. Just pick a day that you got converted. Until that day, did you know you there was demons living in you? demonic spirits and you know they didn't believe the word of God. I remember as a teenager uh drinking and smoking and doing the things I did and th those spirits that were in me, they did not believe in God. That's why I did them. &gt;&gt; You know, you're you're you're cursing, you're swearing, you're getting upset. All these things that you're doing, these are just spirits that don't believe in God. But when the Holy Ghost comes, don't do that. It reproves you. It says we don't do that. And then we put on the Lord Jesus Christ. We we start listening. We start yielding. We start becoming born again and we grow into the nature of God &gt;&gt; through this simple transformed by the renewing of our mind as the scripture tells us. So the spirits that are all worldly spirits, they don't believe. But brother Brand said, "What sin is is unbelief of righteousness because I go to my father and you shall see me no more." In other words, Jesus in the flesh is not going to be here to point us. This is the righteous way with the Holy Spirit. Now we have the living word telling us how to treat our brother, how to treat our sister, how to act right, of judgment because the prince of this world is judged. When the Holy Ghost comes inside of you, you guarantee that devil's going to be judged. He's coming out. That's just all there is to it. Thank God for the comforter. And he says,"I have many things to say unto you." You know, you got a lot of stuff in your life, but you can't bear it now. How be it, when he, the Spirit of truth, has come. He's going to be doing these things. He's going to guide you into all these truths. For he shall not speak of himself again. For whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and he shall show you things to come. We were never ever made to make it on our own. Never. He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of of mine, and shall show it unto you. All things that the father have are mine. Therefore said I, that he shall take of mine and show it unto you. God didn't even want us to witness, be a witness for him without God inside of us. He didn't want us to do it on our own. &gt;&gt; I don't think God wants us to do anything on our own. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Luke 10:3 Jesus said, "Go your ways. Behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. Just like God sent Paul to the Gentiles of whom he was going to deliver have to deliver him at one time, he sends them as lambs in the midst of wolves. Can you believe God would do that to us? It isn't that he has confidence in you. He's got confidence in himself, in you. He's going to deliver you. &gt;&gt; That's why we should never be afraid, don't take this the wrong way, of a fight, &gt;&gt; of something getting out of order. &gt;&gt; Because all we have to do, we were never made to make it on our own, to be alone, to feel alone. We got God on the inside of us. We can do all things through Christ who strengthen us. We're not afraid. God sends us forth as lambs among wolves in this world. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you." Matthewapter 8:18 Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, "All power is given unto me in heaven and earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I command you. And lo, I'm with you always, even unto the end of the world." So he tells them to go and do his work, do teaching, do baptizing. In fact, tell him to do everything to observe all things whatsoever I command you. So now he wants us to spread everything, not just baptism, not just uh uh certain things, but really all things and to all nations that that that God is the same everywhere. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. So he tells them to go do this. And then in Luke 24:46, and he said unto them, "Thus it is written, and thus it behold Christ to suffer, to rise from the dead the third day, and and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And you're witnesses of these things." And so, you know what I want you to do? I want you to go out there and do it. And behold, I send the comforter, the promise of my father upon you. But tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high. &gt;&gt; Well, that word is just as powerful today as it was the day it was spoken. &gt;&gt; We need to spend more time tearing and waiting until we're endued with power from on high. &gt;&gt; Power to defeat the thoughts, the negative things that come to our mind. the the the the the things that the enemy tries to hold us down with. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They they shall not be weary and faint. They shall they walk. They they'll they'll be able to handle the task. You know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; That's what God has in store for those that are willing to tar and wait for his Holy Spirit. I'm not ever saying we don't have the Holy Spirit. I would never think those thoughts at all. What I am saying is that we need to make sure that we're staying filled up, that we're spending time with God, getting energized. You know, we can't come to church and expect everybody else to make us feel better at church. We are the church. And it's okay to come in once a year and be down in the dumps. I'll let you do it once a year. But I'm telling you, that is it. After that, you better be bringing something to the church &gt;&gt; cuz we need you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need you. We need every one of you putting forth your best to create an atmosphere where God just wants to come and fall amongst us. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Um and we're just going to do Luke 24. Uh oh, no, we did that. We're going to go to Acts chapter 1. I'm sorry. We're still doing this this theme here that that we weren't ever able to make it on our own. We weren't intended. God never wanted to leave us on our own. He always was intended for us to have the Holy Ghost. Acts 1:3. To whom also he showed himself alive. that Jesus showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them 40 days, and speaking of things pertaining to the kingdom of God, and being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which saith he, you have heard of me. For John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't depart from Jerusalem, but come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because these spirits that living inside that are doubting and questioning and going through all, you know, we just want to give up. &gt;&gt; Wait a little bit longer. It'll happen the next service or No, today is the day. &gt;&gt; Come on. God is an I am God. &gt;&gt; Verse eight, but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you. &gt;&gt; And you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth. Notice, we're not to be a witness for God until we receive the power of God. &gt;&gt; That's why a lot of people turn people off. &gt;&gt; They have this intent. They want to do good. They want to bring Christ to somebody, but because they don't, you know, they get slapped on the face and they want to slap them in the face. &gt;&gt; They ask them to go a mile says, "I ain't doing that. I'm just going to tell you what you need to do." They just they don't have the power of the Holy Ghost. They still live for themselves. They don't want to live for anybody, right? Let's close with this. St. John chapter 15. What we started out with, St. John 15. We were never made to make it on our own. God sent the Holy Ghost for every possible thing so we could do whatever he's called us to do with the power of God inside of our life. John 15:1 says, 'I am the true vine, and my father is a husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away, and every branch that beare fruit, he purchase that that may bring forth more fruit. I thank God number one, he's interested in us bearing the fruit of the spirit, &gt;&gt; which the first is love, right? By this shall all men know you're my disciples. Bear the fruit of God. And that if you you don't bear it, you make the choice. If you're not bearing fruit, here's the only reason you're not bearing fruit. Because the spirit is not alive in your life. &gt;&gt; God is not going to be alive in your life and not bear fruit. I it it's impossible because every spirit has a fruit. evil or good, &gt;&gt; it's going to bear it. And if you do have his spirit and you are bearing fruit, he's not going to leave you in that condition. &gt;&gt; Because we just heard when the spirit of truth is going to come, he's going to reprove you. &gt;&gt; In other words, he's going to do some pruning. &gt;&gt; He's going to do some purging. He's gonna He wants more &gt;&gt; and he should be able to get it. He created us for his pleasure. Amen. Bible says, "Now you're clean through the word which I have spoken." &gt;&gt; When you say amen to the word of God, you know what you're actually doing? You're being cleansed at that moment by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So be it in my life, Lord. A cleansing is happening spiritually. Abide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, no more can you except you abide in me. We were never made to make it on our own to bear fruit of God. We don't believe in putting peacock feathers in. &gt;&gt; We need the juice from the inside. We're not a form of godliness. We We got God on the inside. We should be able to to to stand tall and and live a life that's ex pleasing to to to those that are around that they can see Christ in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am the vine, you are the branches. He that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit. For without me, he sends this message. For without me, remember you can do nothing. Don't get to a place in your Christian walk that you think you can make it on your own. If you abide in me and I in you say if you if you abide not in me if any man I'm sorry if a man abide not in me if I could just you know read the words I would be fine right if I think I know what I'm Lord help me if a man abide not in me is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned. So I'd rather fail and depend on the Lord, &gt;&gt; be in him and fail than act feel I can make it on my own now. I don't need I don't need the the Holy Ghost because at the end I'm going to be burned. If you abide in me and my words abide in you, look at the look at this precious blessed promise. You shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you. But it comes from a union, from being one with God, &gt;&gt; from abiding in the word and the word living in you. Herein is my father glorified, that ye bear much fruit. So shall ye be my disciples. As the father have loved us, so have I loved you. Oh, sorry. As as the father have loved me, so have I loved you. Continue ye in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, yet as I kept my father's commandments, and I abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. We've all experienced the joy of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We all have. We've all experienced not having the joy of the Lord. And I believe that we can step out of walking with the Lord and trying to just do things on our own. And when that happens, we leave the abiding. We leave that. It's almost like this. We've all had children that we've w had had walking in our hand. We hold them in our hand when we're walking, right? Through a store, through an airport. you know, we don't want anybody to steal them &gt;&gt; and or crossing, you know, we're going to cross the street. The last thing that we want is our child to say, "I got it handled. I'm going." &gt;&gt; They But you see them do it. &gt;&gt; Like, what's going on? What's going on is in their human mind, they think they can make it without help. But they don't real. I mean, I sat there at therapy in in the car and I was just waiting for my time to go in there and I saw this lady had a child and they were way over here on the sidewalk and and they were they were talking soon as just a one second that child went right towards the road like four times it happened. We as you know strong Christians can have that tendency. I can handle this when I'm We got to stay abiding. Get do things according to the word. Stay with the word. Keep keep the love of God in your heart. That's why the Bible says, "Speak the truth in love." When you're correcting, h have that love flowing. Abide in his love. The Bible says, "These things have I spoken unto you that your joy might remain with you. That your joy might be full might be full. This is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love have no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends. And you are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you. That kind of sounds like a conditional friend, doesn't it? But it is. It is. It is. And he loves everybody, but not everybody's going in a rapture. Not everybody's going to heaven. It's those who who who allow the Holy Spirit to reprove the world out and for him to abide the word to abide when the word when you when you see something in the word of God just anything I don't care what it is if it's you know you shouldn't steal you say you know what I'm never going to steal my life. Did you know you got Jesus living inside you? You got part of Jesus. You got part of Jesus living inside of you. Not the fullness. &gt;&gt; But I'm saying this is how easy it is to get God abiding in you. Now, you can't just say, um, I I'm I'm not going to steal. I got Jesus. And then go lie constantly. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? When you're being told, don't lie. So when you hear don't lie, stop lying. And that's how Jesus is in you. Because if you're not stealing, but you're lying, I'm sorry. Jesus isn't in you. &gt;&gt; You know, so you just you got to understand. I'm just trying to encourage you that when you hear the word of God, you say, "Amen." You're accepting the living word of God. Let's stand together. We will always be a needy people. &gt;&gt; We were never made to make it on our own, nor will we ever make it on our own. We've got to build ourselves up in the most holy faith. Brother Brandham said that we're going to need a perfect love to produce a perfect faith to make a rapture. Jesus made it very clear for without him we can do nothing. Paul made it clear that we can do all things through Christ. Amen. I am so needy, Lord. I am so needy, Lord. So needy of you. I am so needy, Lord, to be more like you. She all my rights away in this world of sin. I am so needy, Lord, to be pure with him. I am so needy, Lord. So needy of you. I am so needy, Lord, to be more like you. tear all my rights away in this world of sin. I am so needy, Lord, to be pure within. Amen. As they continue to play that, let's bow our hearts for a word of prayer.
