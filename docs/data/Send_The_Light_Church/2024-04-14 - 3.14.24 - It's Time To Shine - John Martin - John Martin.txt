will not amen praise the lord it's good to have Brother Bruce back amen it's good to see everybody amen praise the Lord God is good amen he's faithful when we're not faithful I think the Bible says that if uh if we are not faithful to him he still remains faithful to us God makes up the difference that's what makes him one one thing that makes him so great and I'm think about everything that we do through the week that we could gather together with brothers and sisters of light precious faith and uh just have freedom and liberty in our heart to worship God and and not to worry about how what somebody you know at the store we might wonder what somebody's going to look you know look at us like what are you doing but we can come here and have Liberty because we're we're one family amen God bless you this morning turn with me if you would to the book of Isaiah chapter 60 Isaiah chapter 60 amen H's been praying for the service how many has since last service if you've been if you were here or you live stream how many's was here or live stream the last service okay praise the Lord now how many has tried to spend some extra time seeking the Lord since then okay that is absolutely wonderful wonderful I believe that that is what we need to get where we want to get to whether it's in our church or in our private lives the Lord is the answer and for whatever reason it is he just wants us to spend more time seeking him and he deserves it because he's the Creator we are the creation amen let's look to the Lord in prayer before we read this here our heavenly father once again we want to thank you for the opportunity that you've given us to gather together Lord and we're not just gathering in in in in in some some place but we're gathering in a place that's been dedicated for you for your glory for your honor that you could be glorified worship praise and that human lives could yield themselves to to you the great holy spirit that you could move inside of us and Reveal Your word to us Lord we just thank you for this place where your word is honored Lord we ask now that you would come and anoint our eyes We Know Thy word is already anointed but Lord come now and anoint our hearts God Lift us up into a realm that we can have spiritual fellowship and communion with you Lord Lord Lift Us above all the pressures and Lord all the worries and anxiety the things that we've been facing through the week just Lift Us above that for Lord these few moments and help us just to be wrapped up in your arms today Lord bless us now as we invite your spirit Lord to have the prevence for we pray these things in Jesus Christ's name amen Isaiah chapter 60 verse number one and to arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee amen God bless you may be seated well well I don't I don't believe in coincidences but we just had an eclipse and some of us some of us had the privilege of seeing it totally get dark and and and just the Bible says that Darkness has covered the Earth Jesus said in the last days that that there would be a term o Nation would rise against Nation we see Israel and Iran Iran rising up against Israel Russia against Ukraine China against Taiwan North Korea is just threatening Christians are being persecuted and displaced read this morning and killed in 28 of Africa's 54 countries and Nigeria is one country that has seen a massive rise in attacks against who the faithful the they say the faithful the Bible says that Satan has weakened the Nations once we were a great nation and now literally we are the laughing stock of the world terrorism from within our own borders immorality and Corruption is rampid I believe the lid has been lifted off hell and it's affected the Earth Darkness has covered the earth now it's a spiritual Darkness we see naturally what's happened but it is a spiritual darkness and the Bible says we read this morning that gross Darkness the people can we really trust anyone anymore I remember a day that I I was just young and I I I made a a a a a $35,000 deal on a handshake uh I wouldn't think about doing that anymore people are are lying they're manipulating they're they're they're stealing they're killing confusion about people's own identity not because God made a mistake but because their own lustful flesh and Satan's ability to C confuse especially young people's minds there's a massive decline in in Christianity and the Bible tells us that this is the day where the apostasy the final apostasy has set in now we know it already started I in the first church age but we're at the climax and there's a great Falling Away evil spirits are getting inside of Christian homes and beginning to deteriorate and tear apart from the inside out selfishness and hatred iniquity has become the new Norm Jesus said in Matthew 24 that many shall be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and and many people shall be deceived gross Darkness upon the people and he said because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold am the church world is full of Darkness as well can you say Amen it was just be honest Jesus looked at the church in this age and said it's lukewarm miserable people he said they're miserable spiritually blind walking in darkness and on top of it they don't know it they they they don't know their condition their spiritual condition in fact they think they're doing so good that it's okay to come in church and just be entertained just you know this is what we want to feel like when we leave here and we they don't want the word anymore we're told there's coming a time that people will not endure sound Doctrine they just they don't want anything that's going to challenge them that's going to hurt them that's going to make them have to give up something they want a Ministry to fit their appetite you know you go to going to go eat today right and if we go out to a restaurant even if we go home we're probably going to look for something that we want to eat nobody's going to like I'm gonna let's cook this I hate it nobody's going to do that you're looking for something you want right and unfortunately there's only one word there's only one word there is no choice but people want to rip out part of it we need to eat the whole word right that's the only way it's hard to find a preacher who's willing to forsake money popularity reputation to preach the full truth and I'll say it like this with a balanced message not just on one side gross Darkness has covered the church amen amen Paul told Timothy this know also that in the last days perilous time shall come now this is this is what's happening in the church for the men of the church shall be lovers of their own self Covetous bolsters proud blasphemers right in church disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy in a holy church there's Unholy people unthankful people having a hard time to worship come on it should be the easiest thing to do is to Worship the Lord without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers you know the devil's just looking for somebody he can use to accuse somebody incontinent fears despisers of those that are good traitors Petty high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God so see there church people they love God but they have a love for other things having a form of godliness as long as I got a form long as I go to church long as I do this I should be okay but Paul told him he says get away from them turn away sir because God has called us to be all his you know we got to make that decision all in I'm all in for God praise the Lord on top of this grow Darkness God has also hid his word from the wise and The Prudent think about this darkness in the church they're blind but then God has also hid it from the wise and prudent it makes it difficult to hear from God do you believe that amen Amos 8:1 says behold the days come sayeth the Lord that I will send a a famine in the land not a famine of bread not a thirst of for water but of hearing the words of the Lord amen and they shall Wander from sea to Sea from from the north even to the East and they shall run to and fro and seek the Lord seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it amen look the word is here it has been given given to us but what we're missing is hearing it come on am the word is the word but we're missing the hearing people are struggling with hearing from God personally in their lives they don't want to take the time to make it real and coming to church and expecting God to just unfold everything that we want to unfold is not God's nature that he's just going to do that that's why he's he's calling us to seek him to spend time with him people don't want to take the time to wait on the Lord they don't want to pay the price and this is the the gross Darkness that's covered the church today I don't want to be part of those that just are satisfied with not hearing the voice of God and coming to church and hearing the word preach hearing the word preach is not hearing the voice of God personally what we have to do to hear the word of God personally is when the gospel is preached that it hits here and says that that that I see the Lord in that that is for me God is speaking to me right there this isn't just coming and fulfilling some some obligation that's right but there's something happening now because I heard and God said he' sent a famine in other words that one time there was a zuza street at one time you know it it just fell everywhere but now you got to pay the price got to pay the price second Timothy 3:13 says but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but look at this but continue thou in the things which thou has learned has been assured of knowing of whom thou has learned them if we continue to press into the Living Word of God then God will see you through amen if you step away from the Living Word and oh yeah just another service again yeah we're hearing the you know the gospel you know brother John is's saying the same old thing you're not you're not you're there you're not going to be protect protected God is sending a Living Word and it's it's got to be alive to us amen now Satan is keeping people in spiritual Darkness there's chains and it's through their unbelief he's deceiving them Revelations 12:9 says and the Great Dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the the whole world Amen he deceiveth the whole world he was cast into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him well when he was cast out of Heaven he didn't stop deceiving he's in every he's got his fingers in everything and his goal is dece to deceive man from what to keep man from giving their whole heart to Jesus Christ that is it because if they get serious about a relationship he knows he's going to lose them if I could just keep them religious keep them distracted in the things of the world let them think that family is more important than God God business is more important than God hobbies are more important than God that's deception there's nothing more important than God Satan is also called the accuser of the Brethren anytime you go accusing somebody you're walking in spiritual darkness and you don't even know it just the mere fact that you're accusing now it's not whether the person that you're accusing is wrong wrong or right it doesn't matter what matters is don't accuse them it's the accusing that makes you guilty it doesn't matter how much they do wrong you don't want that Darkness on you 2 Corinthians 4:3 2 Corinthians 4:3 there's a lot of scripture today but that's that's just the I hope that's okay that the the the gospel is what helps me to know who Jesus Christ is but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in other words Our Gospel is not hid to those that are saved that's right amen it's hid to them that are lost in whom the God of this world right the god who's deceiveth the whole world in whom the God of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not so it's real easy who he's blinding he's blinding those who choose not to believe the truth that's how scary it is to come to church and really not believe the word because now you just opened your door for BL kindness it starts with our choice amen lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who's in who is in the image of God should shine on to them unbelief keeps the light of God from opening up and helping us to see greater things so you know if we if if God shows us a a a a scripture let's just say this God shows you the the scripture that um that uh you need to be baptized the correct way okay say you've been baptized but it was incorrect and God shows you the correct way to be baptized now it's not good enough just to know it that's a light but you got to walk in that amen now once you walk in that light what that does is now that just opens the the door o that more light shines in your p pathway so you can see more amen but if you don't walk in the light that God speaks to your heart because I'll say it like this standing here is as surely as anything this I know God speaks to every person amen there is no doubt and no question now do we hear do we hear are we sensitive are we are we we we we catching what he's saying that's that's that's what why we should come prepared that's why we should come more prepared and not you know not just show up to church show up the right way imagine for a moment that when that tomorrow you're literally going to die and you're going to meet God are you just going to go home and just show up no you're literally going to go home and you're going to think about that you're going to meet your maker amen amen and you will begin to think about is there anything that needs to be taken care of because it now becomes the most important thing look if we really believe God is here and God is we're going to have a meeting with God God's going to speak to us we're going to do the same thing amen we're going to prepare we're going to say Lord I don't want to miss what you have for me because it is too easy to come to church and just kind of like we're lay back and just you know listen to the word being preached but you know it's not just the word being preached the enjoyment or or or whatever we our our our natural man can get out of it but you know it's it's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of a living God and I'm sure God has something for me that he wants me to do have I done all that he's asked me to do or have I brushed something out of the rung have I forgot about it have other things become uh more important to me amen just things begin to slip we don't want that I believe that we are a chosen people here we're a little different than anybody else Jesus said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and I ordained you he chose us above all other people on the Earth the Bible says and he did it because he loved us and you know I just can't WRA my hand around that I just I I I don't I don't know if I'll ever comprehend that we've been predestinated to be just like Jesus and Jesus gave us a Commandment that we're to love one another just like he loved us which is I can't comprehend how much he loves me I still fail him every day and he's loving me and then he gives me this big Commandment that I don't know if I could fulfill these shoes that I actually got to love you the way that he loved me and not just you but out there in the world because you know the love of God is without respect to persons he loves every he loves those out there just like he loves me but not only did it give us a commandment to to to love us to love one another like he loved us he he said I want you to be perfect Jesus said I want you to be perfect like my Father in Heaven is perfect I want you to love your enemies now well you know that takes work you know what kind of work that takes that takes you dying out so much the only thing you want to do is please God that's the work is getting yourself out of the way so God could come inside and actually do the job he's the only one that can do it his love is the greatest love on the planet it endures all things right it believes all things it it doesn't vauth itself it there's nothing about it about itself it lives for others now the Bible calls us a special people calls us precious we're the apple of God's eye amen amen we are his bride 1 Peter 2:9 says that we are a chosen generation if you want to write that down we are different we're a chosen generation he chose us a royal priesthood a holy nation yes A peculiar people a holy nation now we're not talking about the USA we're not talking about that Nation we're talking about individuals yes right amen his chosen they are a holy nation amen be ye holy even as I am Holy amen without Holiness no man shall see the Lord Holiness is a part of God's special people yes now we are 100% different than the people that are in the world come on you going to help me or am I you know we want the we don't want to have a three-hour service here we are 100% different than the people in the world now we're flesh and blood and everybody will have a chance to hear the gospel but what makes us different is we believe the gospel we believe what God said that's what makes us different and we it's not a mental belief it's not some religion it's not some covering is it but it is it's something inside of us Bears witness with this word that it is it is 100% true not just for everybody but it's 100% true for me that if my brother or my sister choose not to live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God I have made my choice I will live by every word that proceedeth of the mouth of God well what about them that's not between me and them that's between them and their creator but the bride is 100% different than the world while Every Nation on Earth is decaying morally we have been called to be a holy nation right we are part of a group that goes around the world now part of this nation part of this nation has already gone on to the reward amen but there is still a living bride here and they're going to be caught up in a moment in the twinkling of an eye there's going to be a Rapture and there's going to be a few here and a few there all over the world they make up a holy nation now we're strange we're we're strange Bible says we're pilgrims and strangers that's right but you know we're really strange to people brother Dennis is always telling us little testimonies that always always bringing out the facts how different he is than the people of the world Amen we're supposed to be we're we're odd we're unique we're unusual we're different we're distinct but we're set apart just for God and what makes us different is that people do not love God the way we do the bride of Christ is a peculiar people a chosen Generations to show forth the Praises of him who called us out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light amen now to me coming to church and not worshiping that's the norm that's the worldly way but for us we've been chosen to show forth the Praises of him that called us out of Darkness into his Mar Marvelous Light this is the hour to praise him well I don't want you to feel bad maybe that you didn't praise him the way that you should have when Brother Bruce gave you opportunity I don't want you to do that but what I want you to do is start praising him right now that's right give glory to his word let him know you're you're uniting with the word and you're thankful for the word you know a lot of people say well you know I'm thank I'm thankful but they don't show it or I love you but they don't show it what good is having anything if it's not shown right all the people that have gone by the way of the grave and they're not here today have no opportunity to show anything it's a it's just a memory but we have an opportunity to manifest love manifest I Praise You Lord and there's so many ways to do it but if you read the Bible in the Book of Psalms and in the New Testament you will find that praise yes it does originate from the heart but it's not supposed to be just there in the heart it needs to come through the body through the lips through the hands it's a sacrifice of praise and the thing is um the world the world knows how praise just go to any sports game or or so many different things out there I mean I was at Applebee's yesterday and you know they got the old TVs up there and they're just like playing golf and you know they hit it and everybody there's watching it's going good job good job that they're giving praise to that person that shot a good shot right you know God blessed us today with mercies new mercies that's a great shot no man can shoot like that no God can shoot like he can shoot no one can forgive like he can forgive and I tell you there ought to be so many reasons that I can't wait to get to church I'm going to praise him I'm going to worship him like I've never done it before you know today I'll say today I am more debt today to God than I was 20 years ago 20 years ago I had sinned less I've sinned more in the last 20 years I haven't been perfect I praised him back there 20 years ago I would be praising him more now today he's revealed more of his word to me I've got more light to walk I I I got a lot of reasons to praise him he gave me breath today he put a desire in my heart to put him first above all the things of this world he's worthy to be praised amen I got to get back to my message God has called his people out of gross Darkness he's called have you heard his call amen now if you want to know the very nature of the Holy Spirit is to lead and guide you into all truth he is not satisfied that you're in a message Church job said I'll not be satisfied to awaken his likness John said I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children Walk In Truth The Very nature of the Holy Ghost is when he the spirit of Truth truth is come he will lead and guide you into all truth amen now we in this flesh are always wanting to just stop wherever we're at like I I'm I I'm paying my ties now I you know I wasn't doing that for for 20 years I'm paying it now and you know what that should be good enough it should be in our carnal mind but in the mind of God he has a he wants to see us in His image with his character so that means he wants us to walk in more light so when I ask the question have you heard his call yet what was the last thing that God asked you to do what was the last thing because that whatever he asked you to do whatever he asked you not to do anymore that was light that was light that he's saying here see this I want you to walk in this and look our flesh just wants to go to a church and hear somebody say your bride you're there you're in don't change and that that is what they say is encouraging I'm just speaking of the world now not speaking the message look I'm so glad God God has a vision for me greater than where I'm at today I'm glad that my God thinks more of me than what I am today because I know I'm not there yet I don't want to be satisfied with this what is this all you got to do is take five minutes and look at the things you're thinking about the things you're Desiring and and where you're going the bride is different than the church it's different than the foolish virgin it's different than waiting a thousand years and hoping you make it through judgment the bride has been chosen she's chosen to follow the whole word amen 2 Corinthians 6 2 Corinthians chapter 6 verse1 17 wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate sayeth the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you notice before God ever saved us we had to do something we had to make a decision to separate oursel from the world we had to say okay I'm not going to live the way I want to live anymore and I had to separate myself before God would receive me and he says in verse 18 and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters sayith the Lord Almighty amen today God is still separating he's still calling for a separation can we identify now look I I'm just going to be honest with you every one of us is very good at identifying and sorry for moving around so much God is we all we are very good at identifying of what other people need to separate from right you know we didn't even go to college for that and and we don't even go to you know a place to learn that but you know we have a hard time recognizing what we are being called by God to separate from now remember if God was through with you now I believe as long as we got breath we ought to be pressing towards that Mark and I mean pressing not not just you know on a skateboard and somebody's has to push us that we actually got to do the work press in all right 1 John Chapter 2 ver verse 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father's not in them Bo that's pretty pretty cut and dry there isn't it amen for all that is in the world now we're we're not talking about Earth we're talking about world nature here is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life is not of the father it's of the world so he's trying he said that there so we could see if that we're we're Desiring something that isn't God to recognize that's not of God right no matter what it is if God's not in it stay away from it it'll bring it'll bring damage and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever amen ever second Timothy 2:4 no man that worth entangleth himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who have chosen him to be a soldier a soldier uh of what the the gospel of the of the light that he has brought to us now when Jesus said he taught us there and I believe uh well I know he taught us this I was just trying to figure out which book it was in but it's in the book of the Bible that's where he taught us and he said uh he told us to go out and and and baptize all and um uh and to teach them all things whatsoever I command you amen so now he give us light we've got to help somebody in the same light he's given us now we can't force it we can't push it we can't make them but we can teach it we can teach them to observe the same light that God showed us because you know God's no respector persons God doesn't want me walking in more light than you and God doesn't want you walking in more light than me his desire is that we all walk in all the light all the light what's different between me and you it's our callings and it's a time that God reveals himself to us I can't give you Revelation you can't give me Revelation but we can pray together that God gives us Revelation now God has given us a Marvelous Light we ought to be the most grateful people on the planet look we're all born in homes we had family members and not all of them are walking in the light we know people that had the same opportuni sat in the same church they're not even here now right that right there that thought process ought to make us so grateful for the light we ought to be the most happy grateful people on the planet amen it should be easy for us to come into church and just worship freely now God didn't just give us a little bit of light but God gave us a Marvelous Light a marvelous light now before I knew about this light I went to church in fact I went to a number of churches before I came into the the truth of this glorious light and we read the Bible in the churches I went to in fact I read the Bible at home and although I could tell you uh the the words that I was reading I really couldn't tell you what it meant what it really really meant now you would think for me going to church me reading the Bible that I had light but just because I go to church and I read the Bible doesn't mean I have the light are you with me unless God speaks to our hearts and he opens our eyes to what the word says we're still in spiritual Darkness so that's why I never want you to get comfortable with just being in church and saying okay we did our duty for the day no I want to hear his voice I I want to make sure I'm connected I want to make sure that it's opening to me Matthew 13:10 please read follow along with us on this and the disciples came and said unto Jesus why speak thou unto these people in Parables and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but unto these other people it is not given that's right now here's a God that's saying look I want some people to know the truth and some people not now why would he say that because they don't love him now look the real answer to hearing from God is fall more in love with him fall in love with him make it real it's not about doing things for the church it's not about giving more money right amen it's about love I love the word now how do you know you love God is when you love the word you can't love God and and and not love his word even Jesus said you call us me Lord Lord and do not the things I say if you love me keep my Commandments There's A Love Affair there verse 124 whosoever have to him it shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever have not from him shall be taken away even that which he haveth now what what is that mean it's like he's talking in Parables to his own disciples let me just throw a word in there for a second for whosoever have the love of God to him shall it the word be given and he shall have more abundance amen but whosoever have not the love of God from him shall be taken away even that which he already has amen therefore speak I to them in Parables because they seen they don't see and hearing they don't hear neither do they understand and in them is the is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and seen you shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is whacks gross their ears are dull of hearing their eyes have been closed they just like sit in church and they go yeah whatever L at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their hearts and should be converted and I should heal them you know it takes the word the believing of the word to bring forth a conversion you can't just say I oh yeah I go to church I'm born again I I I I I I I believe the message that doesn't do it the word has to become open to you when I say the word I don't mean you got to um know from cover to cover that is not what I'm saying what I am saying is when God speaks to you something in this word you've got to start doing it because by you following the word that he tells you to do what you're doing is you're opening your your character your your nature to become completely born again completely converted if you notice there are people who go to church but they go out there they live like The World God is looking for a full conversion now I'm not saying it didn't start right but you know what we got to we got to finish this race it's it's not he that starts the race we got to to finish the race am and it what it takes to finish the race is the same thing that took the started your heart your love amen now look what he says here about us but blessed are your eyes for they see there's light that's com into you that you see and your ears for they hear I'm thankful for the eyes that God has given me the ears that God has given me now I'm not saying that you're going to walk out of here completely different and if you don't you know something was wrong no no this this message goes out and it just covers the thing is if you're willing to start putting forth more effort to walk in the things that God has shown you God is going to bless you but look the the spirit of this age this lukewarmness yeah it's not hot it's not cold it ain't where you just stay home all day and it ain't where you're just you know you're you leave here and you never go home and you're on the mission field it's lukewarm it it it's it's it's a knowledge of the truth but it's it's an unwillingness to put it into practice praise the lord it's exactly what it is it's it's it's a it's a it's a it's a form but I want the life I want the life for verily I say to you that many prophets and many righteous men have desired to see the things that you see today and have not seen them and to hear the things which you hear and have not heard them right I go back to all the churches that I used to go to before I came into this message and I'll tell you to to think about that they don't have what we have today you have been blessed somehow God has chosen you above everybody of all the people on the planet to give you this truth and I I say as Jesus said blessed are your eyes they see blessed are your ears for they hear we ought to be so happy what God has done for us in our lives I'll tell you you know brother B say all make a Methodist shout it all make us get in our seats and just be so thankful for the Lord we get so comfortable we just want you know when's the service over he's getting kind of excited today wish you would just stay by in the whole and just you know you know to be honest with you I wish I stayed behind the pulit too actually God knows I just just alls I can says I don't want to face the Lord not preaching other than that if he wasn't involved I certainly would never be here God has given his eyes to see God has sent a Bible profit in this generation am that's why we're a chosen generation a chosen generation most people don't know but Amos 3:7 says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his Secrets unto his servants the prophets you know so people that think they don't need to go to church they don't need a prophet to make it are so deceived because it is the way that God chose and we've got to follow God's pattern Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord you know there's not a week that goes by that I'm not dealing with somebody that's talking about the end time that we're at the end and when you look at some of these people there's a dread on their face it's like a I I don't want the end to be here there's just more stuff that I want to do I want to I want to see things we are approaching the great and Dreadful day of the Lord it's it's about us it's going to happen but praise God that he sent us a Marvelous Light when he sent us Elijah 45 in the in the form in the office of a prophet now he was just a man like you and I but he held an office that was higher than ours and God forgive me I don't want to do this I don't want to stand on that place where we give our our heart but he he could stand up a little bit higher and see from God things that we could not see and then he came down here and he he started giving it to the people now I never I was never fortunate enough to be in one of his meetings brother Dennis but you know what God preserved the word and he sent somebody by my way to tell me about this messag and when I read it something clicked on the inside I can't explain it but there was a connection there amen I felt like I was a part of this that I was chosen for this amen and it was a greater light than I ever seen in all the churches I was in I'll say it's a marvelous light that God has chosen us to be a part of and you know what the purpose of this message or or what brother abam was supposed to do he was to to get us turned completely to the Lord that's it not another church not another religion but completely to him to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might Amen to give him everything that to that the word of God is is never changed and that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he turned us to the truth he re turned us back and you know if it wasn't needed God would have never said but it was needed it was needed Matthew chapter 17:9 are you with me amen Matthew 17:9 after Jesus was transfigured uh before his disciples they came down from the mountain and Jesus charged him he said tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and all of a sudden that just sparked something inside of them and said whoa whoa whoa whoa wait a minute wait a minute the disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come before this all happens why why do why do the disciples say uh or why do the scribes uh why then the scribes say uh that that Elias must first come they had this question they wanted it answered and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things now because of Malachi 4 six which is a due prophecy Jesus is talking about two comings of Elijah because God uses the coming of Elijah five times and I know this this can get kind of deep for for some of us that don't know these things but just try to take the words that are spoken here okay he's saying why why say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered Elias shall truly first come and restore all things so Jesus is talking about something in the future amen the spirit of Elijah will bring a Marvelous Light because it takes a Marvelous Light to restore all things does it not but this could not have been the prophet John the Baptist John the Baptist did not restore all things the Bible says that John did no Miracles he was just the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord first coming at this time this is Matthew 17 in Matthew chapter 4 John the Baptist was in prison and they did well let's just let's just just read this why then say the scribes that Elias must first come Jesus is referring to a future tense right so it's not about John the Baptist but then he goes right back to what they were talking about in verse 12 but I say un to you that Elias is come already past tense and they have done and they knew him not see that's why they were asking why you say that that this why say the scribes that El was first come they didn't recognize it and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them and the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist so here Jesus in his ministry he's referring now to Elijah Ministry that's going to come in our age he was taking us back to the word he was taking us back to Malachi 4 amen Jesus said search the scriptures and God will always take you back to the word always after Jesus died he resurrected and he went back into heaven in Acts 3: 21 the Bible says that the heavens must receive uh the heavens must receive Jesus until the times of restitution of all things which God have spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began amen so this is just spoken by one man by all the all the holy prophets since the world began it wasn't time for restoration yet but God promised in this age I will restore sayeth the Lord all that Satan had deteriorated God was going to restore it back to the church Revelations 10:7 we're talking about The Marvelous Light in our age but in the days of the voice of the seventh Angel this is the seventh Church age messenger now when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he have declared to his servants the prophets right that means this message is going to clear up every question you're going to have amen if you're wondering about something it the answer is in that message there's no doubt about it it's a glorious light a marvelous light and you know time has slipped away to where I can't even get to where all I want to get to so we're going to be skipping some stuff turn with me to First John chapter 1 this glorious message was sent to us and God wants us to walk in this truth 1 John 1 verse 5 this then is the message which we have heard of him and now we're declaring unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all not even a little bit none now the problem is we all got Darkness but who cares enough about that Darkness who cares enough to start getting it out because what we need to do is arise our light has come we need to arise out of our Darkness amen amen if we say that we have fellowship with God and walk in darkness we actually lie and we do not the truth amen but if we walk in the light that God has shown us as he is in the light that's what that means he will we have Fellowship one with another and then the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sins my how how happy we ought to be right if we say that we have no sin I don't need to come to the altar I don't need to pray I don't need to seek the I don't need to say sorry I don't need to we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness praise the Lord such a simple thing we got to do you don't have to worry about doing cartwheels back flips stand on your head hold your breath for three minutes just be honest with God it's it in order to in order to just confess your sin it takes love because it's not our nature to want to say yeah it was wrong in fact if if I do something wrong to Jonathan I it would Pro My Flesh would probably say well the only reason I did it because blah blah blah blah right that's what my flesh wants to say so you go against nature but if I love God and I know it displeases God to have something between me and Jonathan I'm just going to confess it I confess I'm just getting it out there amen and then I can approach god with boldness God I am sorry cover me with your blood amen cover me with the blood from Calvary and it's that simple that's what a love affair is with God it's not nothing special where you know all the Bible it's living what you do know praise the Lord Matthew Chapter 5 verse1 14 and is this has this been good enough to where I can hold you just a couple minutes okay because we you know we had a we had a special and we had extra things going on they got started late and all right Matthew chapter 5:14 Jesus speaking to us he said you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid how many has you know gone over maybe like uh in in that Hill there in can Cincinnati and that at night you come over that hill and it just opens up and all the lights are on oh you we've we've seen pictures at night we've been in a plane at night you're coming down you see the city the if all the lights are off you can't see but when the lights are on you can see and here Jesus is saying this saying to us a city that's set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick that it giveth light into all that are in the house the gospel is not something to be hid from others let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven am now I know if there were some people they would have probably wrote the word like this let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify you on Earth but God deserves all the glory if you've got any light inside you that is the grace of God why would you want to steal Glory from God now that word shine when Jesus said let your light so shine shine means to give light not to say I've got light to give it it means to beam it amen in other words you got your low beams in the car and your high beams you beam it it means with radiant brilliancy God wants to see all of us beaming in the light beam it not just beam it to people that don't know the Lord but beam it to me Paul told Timothy to be an example unto the believer right be it one to another I need you that's right you need one another I was I was going to say you need me but I'm not going to say that we need one another we need one another we need to beam and help one another am and you know part of that light is Love part of it is forgiveness part of is I unconditionally accept you without respect to persons part of it is given a helping hand part of it is when somebody knocks on the door and says something you're there but you've got Light Beam it now it's hard to beam the light if you're filled with self selfishness Strife anger hatred wrath anxiety it it's it's hard to Shine the Light if you're filled with Darkness all right 2 Corinthians chapter 4 now believe me I'm going to go through I'm going to bypass a lot of this but we got some good word word here in 2 Corinthians CH 4:6 about this light that God wants us to shine for God who commanded the light to shine now notice it's a commandment to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but but we have this light or this treasure in earn vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us now look this is how you shine it we're troubled on every side but we're not distressed right we're perplexed about what's going on but we're not despair we're persecuted all around we're getting persecuted but we're not forsaken God's still with us we're cast down people cast us down but we're not destroyed always bearing about in the body our body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered to the death of Jesus sake for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you amen I say today it's time for us to arise out of the darkness that we're in now remember if we say we have no Darkness we lie think about what God has been speaking to you what just take a look at your life what are some of the things that you know has not been pleasing it's time to rise out of ourselves out of the darkness out of the out of the flesh the selfishness or out of our will out of our anger our Strife our our our our hopelessness our our anxiety are are getting upset it's time for us to rise out of that because the light of God has come to our hearts now we got to take the step and it's arise and get and move away from that amen you can't wait for your circumstances to be better before you choose to walk in the light that's not love that's not love that mean you know take all the demons away take all my Temptations away surround me with such loving people and I'll be a good Christian no put me in the worst condition and Let Me Shine for Jesus put me in the greatest Temptation Let Me Shine for Jesus it's time to arise to rise oh rise like we're sitting down eventually we're going to rise up right you're probably hoping brother John I wish we would have rise I've been sitting here a while uh just write this down Romans chapter 3 13: 11-14 it's the the night is far spent the day is at hand it's time to cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light Colossians 3:8 through1 15 we're supposed to put off anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of our mouth lie not one to another see you put off the old man as he take those things off and put on as the elect of God bows of Mercy yes you know hatred is of the devil amen put it off it's a work of Darkness the spirit of hatred literally binds people from seeing straight and if you you just you read this 1 John Chapter 2 verses 8- 11 if you say that you're walking in the light you hate somebody you're lying you're deceived you're blind and you don't even know it that's I want you to read that oh my it's time to arise for thy light is come and thy and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee can you say that the light of God has shined on me amen he just wants us to rise and start walking in it start walking in that light our light is come it's time to live for God it's time to win souls it's it's time to be about the father's business amen it's time to put away childish behavior childish behavior is I don't like what they did to me can you say amen amen it's time to put that away it's obvious we don't like what they did to us you know what that just opened the door for me to beam a light yes to love the unlovable to give to let people use you amen right hey pray for them yes you know the not only people are going to use you they're going to despitefully use you it's okay it's okay that's between them and God God never said if things were going to be easy he just told us to rise and let our light shine and we all I I I just want to be a billion Watt [Laughter] I want to I want to have so much light that that I don't have to worry about making the wrong move right just give what you have for the service of the Lord God's calling you to to do anything just do it do it because I'll say like this you know we're done here we're not going to hold you any long but listen to this God is hid in Simplicity amen if we're looking for something that we agree with we're probably going to miss God because we wouldn't need the Holy Ghost then see yeah the Holy Ghost is here to show us what he wants us to start doing and it's in every one of our grips we we can walk out of here and beam the light think about Lord what would you have me to do Lord what Darkness would you have me to get out of how would you have how what you want me to rise to that I haven't been doing because it's our opportunity and it shows that we love God let's Stand Together the light isn't meant to be kept under the bushel of yourself right the bushel of your life your home your wants your desires it's time to shine it's time to shine amen let's sing We Are The Generation amen we are the generation praise the lord we are the J generation where the

hearts to want to be what that song was saying amen do I just I felt that Spirit as we were singing it and that's what's important I want to go before the Lord in prayer today and maybe there would be someone that would just say brother John I want to start walking in more light than I've been walking and you want to be remembered in prayer amen God bless your hands God sees this beautiful desire I don't know another desire than to please the Lord that would be is important as that amen Heavenly Father we come to you thanking you Lord that you have brought your light to us when we were in darkness and didn't care about anything but ourselves Lord you sent somebody by our way to let us know that you were calling us that you had a word that you wanted to give us that without you we could not make it and that you loved us in our our our situ ation that even though we weren't perfect that we were we weren't even caring about you you still had a love for us like we've never seen before God because of that love you stayed there even Lord just looking back on my own self I remember the times just rejecting you rejecting that call but you kept calling you didn't give up Lord by your grace we don't want to ever give up but Lord we want to continue to shine more light than we've ever shined before you saw our hands you saw our hearts our our desire to be a greater light for you Lord because you're worthy you're worthy of the light that you brought us into Lord we all we we just feel our heart this indebtedness to go share this light with other people that they may too know you the way that we know you to experience your love the way that we experience it to have this joy in our heart to have this this peace that pass all understanding to have this this willingness to be longsuffering and forbearing and and and and to be gentle with others and Lord it's our yearning and our desire to be that for others God may you you give us more of the Holy Ghost that's the true the true light of your word is the The Living Word of God the Holy Ghost I pray that you would feel every one of us Lord everyone that just raised their hand and said God I want to walk in this light give them Lord that that uh that power within the inside of themselves to to just knock over any Bush or to to put that uh that low beam on high beam and just to to be a radiant vessel for your kingdom and for your honor Lord we commit all of our Lives into your hands we commit this purpose that we have now Lord may you add to it may you multiply it may you bless it bless our lives Lord that when you return that you'll be pleased we'll give you all the praise for it we do now in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
