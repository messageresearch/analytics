the lord well we're so grateful to have brother bruce ministering we had asked him to minister when we were going to be gone but he was unable there was possibility something would be coming up and he didn't want to take a chance and so we just decided that tonight's the night and how many's been praying for the service let's believe with all of our heart as we sing only believe to have our brother come let's believe that god will minister directly to us amen amen believe all things are possible only believe only [Music] things are possible only believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe amen praise the lord so the devil tried to make sure i couldn't come and expressway was shut down people don't know how to drive praise the lord amen so if you turn me tonight to exodus 12. um you know when you come to church god has a word for each and every one of you it takes a long time for us to learn that we we think that was for this guy over here or this guy over here or whatever else and so brother johnson had read these uh scriptures two weeks ago on a wednesday night and then i saw something in there i said hope that's something interesting so we'll share that with you amen so starting with verse 1 and it says and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speak ye unto all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb fern house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the house wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the flesh and that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not of it raw nor sodden nor all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinence thereof and you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins skirted your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand you shall eat it in haste it is the lord's passover amen that's just our heads dear lord jesus heavenly father we realize that none of us are worthy lord none of us are worthy even to look into the book but heavenly father we're so grateful that you sent a lamb lord that we can put our hands on and the lamb of god his blood taketh away all of our sins and based on that you have made us worthy lord we're so grateful for that we just pray you'll come tonight you'll be gracious to us that you'll break the bread of life with us lord may you come and be our guest we pray you forgive us of every sin every shortcoming in jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen you may be seated so i'd like to speak to you tonight about the full armor of god so in israel and the church brother branham said so now we're coming down to the last plague so you have to see that this is the last thing god said i'm tired of fooling now i'm going to give you the last plague and now i want you to notice the last plague was death and now we've had earthquakes and we've had wars and rumors of wars and not too many hours ago we just had a great major earthquake in afghanistan a thousand people lost their lives just wiped them out gone so he said so we've had earthquakes and we've had wars and rumors of wars and we have this military operation in ukraine and if you've seen some of the pictures i mean the believers best we know all the believers have been safe but russia's just i mean if you want to take over some country why would you completely destroy the country before you take it over i want to take over fenton i'm not going to just bomb it to smithereens so it shows the insanity of the world amen so we've had wars and rumors of wars and we've had tidal waves as jesus said would be the sea roaring men's hearts failing and more heart trouble number one disease well back in 1953 that might have been the number one disease but now we have fentanyl now we have drugs we have i see yesterday thailand just passed a national law that they can all grow marijuana it's going these people are insane so they just they're just looking at the money it'll get me out of poverty if i can just sell marijuana to somebody fear perplexity of time distress between the nations horseless carriages on the broadways yes driving crazy all these things have been fulfilled but the last plague is death and it's not physically speaking but it's spiritually speaking death spiritually in the church so you notice it was amongst the sons the spiritual death the church had got more members than it's ever had it's thriving better than it ever did and yet the weakest in spirit than it ever was i mean the church is just it's grown by members leaps and bounds but the spirit of god is is not amongst them amen that's true that's just like it was in egypt so now notice the last thing but oh before oh amen amen before god let the spiritual death reign he made a way of escape for those who wanted to hallelujah and i love that god making a way of escape for those who desire to walk in it and now those that don't desire well okay they got death amen so we want to look here at luke 21 amen as we kind of set a little background on this um luke 21 verse 34 it says so it says so take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life so that that day comes upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth so watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man so you see there's no escape clause in those scriptures are not immune to anything in there he said it's going to come and it's going to come as a snare and a snare is how you trap things it looks very appealing and when you reach for it it's got you amen the greek says your hearts he says in verse 34 there he says take heed yourselves lest at that time your hearts be overcharged or your hearts be oppressed by gluttony and drunkenness and that greek word for drunkenness said and the side effects of a hangover after the drunkenness you know how like you know we all get together at thanksgiving we have a great big feast and we get all stuff full of turkey and everything else and the after effect is you all fall asleep and sometimes when you come to church you know you if you're not careful you'll fall asleep oh the word was so good it was so wonderful but then when you walk out of the door you forget amen so he says your hearts be oppressed by gluttony and drunkenness and the hangover after drunkenness and the anxieties of life you think about people are all anxious the anxiety and and we are not free of that and that day come unexpectedly upon you amen so you don't want that day to come unexpectedly because it's going to come as a snare and like i say if you're a good hunter a good trapper you make sure that your trap is well covered up you don't want to write out there big flags here's a trap it's not like that amen so he says in verse 36 there he says so watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and you're not getting out of it you're not getting out of it we're all going in this together amen and then let's look at revelations three i always think this is quite amazing revelations 3 verse 10 and 11 he says because thou hast kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth the hour of temptation the snare the anxiety the pressures of life the uncertainty of the economy men's hearts failing for fear earthquakes you don't know when you get if you're gonna get killed on the expressway you don't know if if you go to the gas station the guy next to you because you got to the pump before he did right pulls a gun and follows you into the store right and that's the hour that we live in and we're not immune to that if the holy spirit doesn't go with you everywhere you go you are totally unarmed amen amen so he says to try them upon the earth behold i come quickly see it's a snare he says i'm gonna this thing's gonna happen and i'm going to come real quick when you're not expecting me when you're not looking hold out fast which thou hast that no man can take thy crown the original says because thou has kept the word of my patient endurance i like that i also will keep thee from the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole habitable to try those who dwell on the earth amen because the next thing that happens if we go back here to luke 12 amen if we go back here to luke 12 we see the after effects of not expecting the unexpected the after effects of not expecting a snare so he says here in luke 12 45 he says but and if that servant say in his heart my lord delayeth is coming and shall begin to beat the men servants and the maidservants and see to eat and drink and to be drunken take heed unless your hearts be overcharged with the anxiety and the things and start to expect that well maybe this maybe this isn't so bad maybe i can make a better deal out of this thing and he says and then he said they start to eat and drink with the and be drunken and the lord of that servant what did he say there in revelation he will come in a day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him in asunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers amen so it's a dangerous hour that we're living in it's an hour when brothers if you don't have the holy ghost you need to get it you need to get it amen amen and the third exodus brother branham said so you see they'd had many exoduses of course but i'm speaking on the time that god called for an exodus a separation from where they were so where they were in egypt at the present time and here god is making ready to fulfill his divine promised word that he had given to abraham and to isaac and to jacob years hundreds of years had passed 430 years that's a long time i mean most of us were alive when the world trade center went down right that's not a long time 21 years ago it's not a long time people have had babies after that people have gotten married after that people have had gone in and got careers they've been in in their career for 10 or 15 years since 2001. just think of the things that have happened since 2001 but here's the children of israel they had rehearsed this promise this prophecy for 400 years amen but god never yes years hundreds of years had passed but yet god never forgets his promise in the season in the due time god always makes his promise right amen therefore you can rest assured that what god has promised in this bible he's going to do it there's no need of trying to think anything else and say well the prophet was maybe he was wrong or this couldn't happen in this day looked almost impossible more impossible than it does now but god did it anyhow because he promised he would do it he has promised we've read the promises right we just read them so let's go back here to exodus 12. let's take a look and see what god has for us amen praise the lord amen so in verse 1 it says in the lord speaking to moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you and we all came out of egypt but when you hear the voice of moses when you hear his voice and aaron and they start to talk to you about the word of god that is the beginning anything that you did before that don't count this is the beginning of your life this is the beginning of your life is when you respond brother branham said he says coming down god said i'm done fooling around with you guys the time where i'm calling for the last this is it we're going now how are we going to get there so this is the beginning of the month so he says this is the beginning of months and it should be unto you the first month of the year to you and he says now speaking unto all the congregation of israel everybody worldwide the very first thing you got to do if you want to be in the exodus get a lamb well i don't i don't i don't know if i want to no no this is an optional get a lamb he says speaking under the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this this first month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for the house that house you'll notice that this lamb that that moses told them to get was large enough for everybody in your house and if it's too big there's enough lamb to go around for you and your neighbor but if you don't get the lamb you're not going on the journey you have to have the lamb amen amen he says and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next into his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make you count for the lamb okay everybody we're all going to sit down and have a meal and he says in verse 5 he says so your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year and you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening brother branham says so he says watch this in type this lamb figuratively speaking was the lamb of god the atonement just before the destruction how are you going to get by without a lamb how are you going to get by saying well i i you know my dad he he's a pastor or are my my aunt she's really faithful or or you know my brother he you know years ago his uncle's second customer they fished with brother branham no you've got to have the lamb amen the atonement just before the destruction and notice it must be a young lamb it must be a male the first from the mother you and that was jesus the first from the virgin mary and it must be without blemish it must be kept up and tried every one of us must try our lamb you can't just say i accept jesus as my savior without testing him you got to test him it's a requirement test him and see if the lord is good test him and see if he'll keep his word you know people that are real believers when they start god starts to draw them and starts to call them the very first thing he does is he delivers them from something so they say oh i didn't know it before but i know it now there is a god there is a god and all of your drunk friends smoking pot and everything else go what i'll tell you what car fell on me when i was 17 and i should be dead but after that after i got out from underneath that i said you know what i don't care what any you guys say i'm not swearing i'm not saying that because i know there's a god i heard his voice he talked to me he told me what to do and i was still a sinner but you've got to know you've got to try your lamb you've got to try him if you what good is to come to church and pay your tithes and come and do all this stuff and still not know the reality that your lamb can take care of every situation you have amen listen what brother branham says i just love this he says he must be about blemish he must be kept up and tried to see and all how perfect that prefigured him he was the perfect one he everyone had to testify that he was the lamb even pilate said i have found no fault in him bring me some water and notice you talk about him i could call tonight i could say zechariah what do you think about him and he would give his expression and i could call eve and she could say oh it's the seed that was promised to me back in the garden of eden eve had to test the lamb zachariah had to test the lamb isaiah had to test the lamb jeremiah had to test the lamb and you think you don't have to test the lamb well you're not going amen he said i could call daniel daniel what about you i'll put him on trial with you said he is the rock that was hewed out of the mountain daniel saw that amen he could call isaiah and isaiah said that's the one that i said unto you a child is born a son is given that's the fulfillment that is the lamb amen amen isaiah saw him amen i could call ezekiel he said what do you think about him oh he says i saw him like clouds with his freedom moving amen a fire a wheel inside of a wheel amen i could call john the baptist and say what do you think about him and he said i didn't even know him but he see he that told me in the wilderness he'd already had a connection before he even got to his lamb there was something already there pulling on him he that talked to me in the wilderness said upon whom thou see the spirit descending and remaining he's the one that will baptize you with the holy ghost and fire amen praise the lord amen i like that upon whom thou shall see have you seen the spirit of god fall on your land god doesn't want you just to be a church member amen we're talking about we're talking about an exodus amen i could call mary and say mary what do you think about it mary would say i didn't even know a man but the holy ghost overshadowed me and said that thing that's born in you will be called the son of god i could call those different ones i could call the roman now see he started with the believers he says and i could call the roman what do you think and you would say well his friends will always testify but what about his enemies okay let's call pilate after taking a pen and washing his hands and saying i find no fault in him but take him away do whatever you want to he he tested the lamb and then rejected it yeah tested the lamb and then said nope let me wash my hands i wasn't here i didn't see it i didn't feel it i didn't know that he was i didn't know uh-uh trying to find a political favor he plunged himself to death up there in norway or in sweden and when every year they go there to watch this blue water bubbling up again and claim it's the water he washed his hands from christ you can't wash your hands off of him no sir you can't i looked at the roman centurion what do you think about him you're the one of his enemies he put his hand on his heart he said truly this is the son of god pilate said i find no fault in him first he was standing there very bad always ready to condemn everything and i hear a horse come running galloping down the street and here comes one of the temple guards he jumps off his horse he goes a little piece he's got a little piece of paper folded he runs up before a pilot he bows down hands in the piece of paper an old pilot you know he takes it he opens it up he was was early that morning kind of you know he even had his coffee yet he got up there and he looked he began to turn white his knees begin to beat together let's look over his shoulder and see what's in the matter what's written on that piece of paper his pagan wife had said have nothing to do with this just man for i've suffered many things in a dream today because of him amen the lamb has to be tested by every one of us not good enough that your husband tested the lamb not good enough that the wife tested the lamb not good enough that the deacon board tested it's not good enough you have to get a lamb you have to test it you have to test it oh judas iscariot what do you think about him he said i betrayed innocent blood he got a rope and was man enough to hang himself he tried him what do you think about him god said to he that's what do you think about him god he said this is my beloved son hear ye him kept up no fault in him sure first one from the old mother the mother you the lamb was jesus was the first child of the virgin born of a virgin birth and of course he had to be a virgin notice this now i want you to notice again that all the assembly then was to kill him and that's what we saw here first of all he says go get you a lamb everybody get a lamb for the house and then it and make sure that the lamb you get is um is big enough for all the souls that are in your house and if you get the one that's you know you get the super size one then share it with the guy next door to you and then test him test him and try him and after you've tested him and tried him then the high priest he also got a lamb because there's one lamb for the whole nation because the bible says and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it that's one in the evening and then everybody killed their lambs the whole congregation and he says and i want you to notice again that all the assembly was to kill him the assembly the whole assembly now if you notice watch how this reads you can see it in a pre-figure see watch 14th day the same month the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening and you'll notice all israel stood there and said away with him let his blood be upon us and upon our children and they from cahiaphus all the way down witnessed his death every one of them did away with him give us barabbas you notice that and he died at three o'clock in the evening and they and they shall kill it in the evening how beautiful you see that end of verse six there shall kill it in the evening but it's not just good enough to kill the lamb because we're going on an exodus this is just before the last plague and now we're getting out well we saw the the frogs we saw the darkness that you could touch with your hands we saw the water turn into blood we saw the plagues we saw the the boils on on all the animals and everything we saw that but now the last plague the la it's time to leave egypt so now there's a separation there's something that god wants you to know about that he's testing this is different than all the rest because it requires a lamb and it requires that after you've taken and killed the lamb so they're going to kill the lamb in the evening and he says and thou shalt take the blood so now if and i'm me i'm i'm a wuss brother johnson and i we were talking about the squirrels in his backyard i said oh brother johnson i said i went to iowa one time i said went squirrel hunting brother invited me says come and go squirrel hunting with me i said i killed a squirrel i felt sorry for the squirrel then i picked this poor thing i liked him and they put him in my bag and i take him home and eat him i said no i just want to go to sam's and say i'll take that i like that roast right there like that pork and i said i don't i don't want to kill the lamb but you got to kill the lamb jesus said we just took communion he says if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part you've got to kill the lamb so when they took the lamb you know you got to do it humane how many are your pet lovers yeah right now all of you that are pet lovers you got a pet at home okay try this when you go home grab your pet and just sit down in a chair and just hold him just hold on to him and see what he does just see what he so you think this lamb is going to lay down for you so you already picked the lamb you take the lamb you're going to have to tie its feet together and all the time it's fighting for life because everything wants to live so then what you do is you take a lamb and you want to be humane about it this is back in egypt you want to be humane about it so you don't have a 357 or a shotgun or something no you got to get a very sharp knife and you got to grab that lamb right up between his ears and you slit his throat and blood's gonna come out because his heart's beating you gotta let him bleed out so you put a pan down there because you gotta catch the blood you got to see it shaken for its life and you catch the blood now the blood in the pan moses didn't say just take the blood and put it in a pan and then let's go on and eat the lamb he said ah no take the blood of your lamb that you have proven the lamb that you have kept up for four days because it's on the 10th day of the month and this is the 14th 14th day of the month and now evening of the 14th day kill the lamb and now take the blood and take it and put it on the doorposts one on each side and across the lentil on the top he says so that everybody can see that you have slain a lamb people think somehow they can be a christian without the blood being on display are you kidding me it's got to be applied in your life it's got to be on display and we're not talking about jehovah witness on display we're not talking about that we're not talking about the guy that that walks around the factory floor with the bible underneath his hand and anytime you talk to me so let me tell you about a scripture here that is what we're talking about we're talking about blood being applied and the blood is what sanctifies the believer and sanctification means i no longer chew tobacco it means i no longer smoke it means i no longer swear it means i no longer run with the people they think it's strange that's what scripture says that says they think it's strange that you're no longer running with them now see sister lynn you amazed me you just absolutely amazed me i only talked to her once she told me she said 20 years as in flint she said you'd have to tell me she said i got a book and bang she proved the lamb and then the blood was applied the pants went out the window everybody said what what are you doing my god what god is this god the one that's got the blood see he's applied he's on display amen the blood's got to be applied it's got to be on display everybody's got to recognize it amen the sinners your friends everybody amen and not just for a week or two now you know a lot of people like that too well i got baptized i feel really good about it but then they just kind of slide back into the old muck and mire amen amen praise the lord that's what was in egypt that dreadful night just before death struck there isn't anybody that can tell you you can meet him at the gas you can meet them anywhere they all will tell you something is wrong because there's an oppression there's something happening just before death comes just before it comes just before the last plague god had showed his great signs and wonders in egypt his long and his kindness to pharaoh and all of his people he had sent many great signs through the land he sent him a prophet he showed them signs and wonders a pillar of fire and all the things that he did and yet in all that he had did they would not repent they would not come to god they ignored all of his signs they ignored his prophet they ignored a message they wanted their own way so god had been fed up with them so he said you know what i'm going to make a separation now between those who do believe and those who do not believe he said i'm going to make a separation and it was a lamb the lamb was the separation amen and brother branham says and i think we're living in that time now what now i thought we were talking about exodus and moses and many many many many no brother branham said it's now now god is making a choice and man will believe or he won't believe and then god required a token and this token was an innocent lamb that he had substituted for your death that's what the lamb is for if the if the children of israel found the lamb and they slayed the lamb and they applied the blood and they finished everything that moses said then god would spare their life the firstborn but if they did not if they one place in the token brother brandon preached a token i think four or five times he said one place he said the three there's three jews are all standing there and he says and the one brother he's he's stirring up the blood he said this is the blood of the lamb of god and the other two brothers said yes sir brother we believe that and he said then this will deliver us the death angel when he sees us he'll pass over our house tonight they say oh yes brother i believe that and he said he'd start putting it on the doorpost and on the little and everything else we believe that we believe it amen now you go do it well you know i got standing i got standing i i'm you know i'm popular amongst my friends i i my family will reject me who wants to put blood on my 200 000 400 000 house who you know who wants to do that who wants to clean it up who wants to do all oh i mean you know it's nice i i'm glad you believe the message like that but but that's not that's not for me that's your choice god required a token in that day because a death angel was coming amen and now when the lamb was killed the blood was to be placed upon the doorpost and on the lintel and it was to show that the requirement had been carried out oh i think that's a great lesson for us as we look at it see the believing worship as he was identified by the token of the blood he had to the believer had got the lamb he slayed the lamb a lamb for a house he took the blood with hyssop which is just a little brush that grows up there in the country and there's just a common weeds as we call it and to apply the blood it shows that the applying of the blood with the hyssop hyssop represents faith and many times listen many times people think they have to have some kind of supernatural faith and he said no all you've got to do is take him at his word and trust him prove him prove that lamb amen he says you think you need some supernatural faith to be a believer it isn't the hyssop speaks for that this common weeds that you could just get it anywhere pick it up dip it in the blood and apply the blood praise the lord amen you've got to do that every one of us you saw i don't know and that's kind of fanatical i'm okay with that i'm okay with that i'm okay with that so verse seven it says so you take of the blood and strike it upon the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein you shall eat it it's got to be applied where you're eating the lamb in revelations 10 1-7 it says the book was closed but he said i saw one sitting on the throne and he said and he had a book and he handed it to this other guy and this other guy took the book and he opened it up and he come down and stood upon the land in the sea put one foot on the land and one foot on the sea and said the book is no longer closed it's open now well that's great that's wonderful but that isn't what the next scripture says the next scripture says take the book jesus said i am the book right take the book and then eat it in the house where you sacrificed your lamb amen you got to eat this book you got to become one with your lamb you can't just oh it was a nice lamb it was really nice lamb and i had to kill him because moses told me i had to i didn't really wasn't what i wanted to do but you know i don't want to look like an oddball so i'll follow everybody else i'm going to kill the lamb and now i'm going to do just like every no there's no faith in that amen so what look what he says in verse 80 says and they shall eat the flesh in that night roasted with fire with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it now i want you to notice something i went i want you to turn over and look at verse 11. and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand and you should eat it in haste it is the lord's passover i thought we were supposed to roast the lamb first no you got to get dressed when brother johnson read that i looked down and said wait a minute what he's he says when you eat the lamb verse 8 said and they shall eat the flesh verse 8 says eat the lamb but before you can eat the lamb you got to get dressed you can't just eat the dress any old way you can't eat the lamb any way you want you gotta have the blood applied and then you gotta get dressed you gotta get dressed amen you gotta you gotta have your loins girded that's the first thing get your loins girded you know get a nice big belt put it on there hold your pants up right get your loins girded and put some shoes on your feet because they're going on a journey and the stones are in the road and some of the places we're going people have thrown beer bottles out of their cars and there's glass in the road and there's nails in there there's all kinds of things in the road so get you some good red wing shoes or go down an army surplus store get something with some really good souls that you can walk on these things because we're going and he says then take your staff take your staff too thy rod and thy staff they do comfort me because when you're out there walking and we're going in haste so we're going to be running he said because we're doing that you're going to have to have something to comfort you when the trials get tough because we have just started on this journey we just started amen so let's let's read verse 8 let's do this so he says you should eat the flesh in that night roast roast with fire unleavened bread and with bitter herbs you shall eat it eat not of it raw nor sodden it all with water i'm sorry if you like medium rare meat no you like your prime rib raw no no he says no not sodding at all with water but roasted with fire his head yes all the intelligence and his legs amen how he walks and all the insides everything yeah yeah when you kill the lamb and you become one with the lamb he wants your brains he wants how you walk he wants how you think he wants everything and no medium rare not good enough not good enough amen and you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning because you know that after the death angel came the battle it was new the next day do you realize that we're in the last age of the last day of the last hour and when the morning comes there is to be no lamb left because he that is filthy remains filthy he that's wicked remains wicked he that's righteous remain righteous because the lamb has been eaten and if anything's left because it's the last age it's roasted and burnt up with fire and that's what the scripture says and the righteous shall walk out on the ashes amen brother sister my then leave nothing of it till the morning if you haven't listened to the seals what if you haven't listened to the church ages what have you been doing you know you're not going to get out of here without the whole lamb you got to eat the whole lamb amen praise god brother branham said you know see i was standing here not long ago by a big smelter and i noticed how hot that fire was and it just cooked and cooked and cooked and as the hotter it got all the dross and the metal it all come it's in the gold and it will all come to the top god is going to put us all in the smelter puts us in the smelter and he says all the things i like how he says it all comes to the top and they skimmed it off oh good well they got all the dross out he said but that ain't enough so i'm going to turn the heat up even more because there's other things there's other impurities in there he says so he says they would heat the fire up a little hotter in the smelter and then when that boil would come then they would have some more stuff pyrite and stuff and they'd take that out of it so he says in the next paragraph he says so you see the first thing that comes up was the dirt so when you heard the voice of god and you tested the lamb and then you heard the blood you put the blood on the door and you started to eat the lamb the very first thing you're wondering you're wondering wait a minute i like to do this this i like to this is something i like to do but if it's not what god wants to do he just turns the heat up so all of a sudden that thing that you like to do get it away and he just skims it off and then he looks at you and he says oh you're kind of prickly you don't get along with your neighbor you're looking along with the people in the church he turns the heat up he turns the heat up yeah they bring all kinds of things can we rub their metal together brings that together brings disagreements and everything that's fussing and everything else these gods just standing back they said turn the heat up some more yes oh my praise the lord you know nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar god sent nebuchadnezzar down to egypt or down to israel to to clean them up because they had rejected god and rejected all of his prophets everything else in jeremiah the last prophet they had he said guys he says let me tell you when you see jerusalem compassed about by nebuchadnezzar when he comes down here go out and surrender it'll be good with you they said ah you got to be kidding we got a big god we got a god that can take care of oh nebuchadnezzar he's a bad guy he's a false he's false everything they believe is idol worship they're all wrong you better believe what the prophet said and if you don't know what the prophet said you better go find out what the prophet said what if you didn't listen to moses ah moses i don't want to put the blood on my doorpost moses i don't want to kill my innocent lamb moses i don't want to get dressed so when you know they took the children of israel they took them all down to babylon and i was looking at this i'm saying about this yesterday because i was thinking about the smelter and i said oh yeah i remember that and god just turned the heat up and i'd say oh lord i can't take it he'd say oh yeah you can because you may not have the same thing i'm made out of you're part of the rock that was chewed out of the mountain amen amen and you just turn it up turn it up and you know they got down there one day and they were all worshiping nebuchadnezzar he thought he so he he made an image he made an image brother adam said he said that image he says was of a holy man he said the image was of daniel that's what he said he says the image of daniel and he says when he called madrak shirak and abandoned out there he said hey brothers he said now you know what we're going to do we're going to play some nice music something you're really going to like and he says and then what you do want you to bow down to the the image and all will be good for you amen you know what in the first the first age all them people died nebuchadnezzar said what so he turned the furnace up to number two and he went and got some more israelites and he said hey look i got this image over here he said we're going to play some nice music and he says when we play the music you go down and you wish me to be well with you and they said nope and he killed them all and he turned it up to three and he did it again and he turned it up to four and when he got all the way up to seven he turned it up to seven and it was really hot and he found shadrach meshach and abednego he said hey boys i got an image here you need to bow down to it and they said you know what this is the age this is the hour we're not bowing down your image our god will deliver us in this hour if we just have the faith of a mustard seed and he said you're nuts he's so mad he said throw him in the fire in the first age not in the second age not in the third age not in the fourth age the fifth age the sixth age but in the seventh age he threw him in the fire and who was there the lamb the lamb the lamb was in the fire oh brothers yo everybody's all upset it's all in the word of god amen praise the lord amen so the first thing that comes up is dirt dirt and mud next thing that comes up was like no good some quick silvers and all these things they come up they skimmed it off and he keeps turning the heat up and he keeps turning the heat up and he keeps turning the heat up and he keeps turning the heat up i was thinking about that you know there's his brothers going around saying brother branham he was a false prophet everything else call you up say hey you know i checked the records brother branham said 14 guys fell off this bridge we can't find any record of it oh really yeah we can't find any record of it that makes him a false prophet i said well let me see what brother branham told me to do he didn't tell me to go back and see what a prophet said he said go back and see what the word of god said and when i went back and i looked in the word of god it said behold the day cometh that burneth like a heat and i will send you elijah the prophet and he will turn your hearts back to the fathers and i said don't see no 13 men falling off the bridge but if that'll stumble you good i'll stay with malachi 4. i'm going to stick with him amen they said well you know he made this mistake over here well let me see what that says in the bible let me see what this says in the bible brother sister come on the people don't realize we're in a smelter right now and the heat is going to keep turning up and more people are going to leave the church and more people are going to leave the message and more people are going to go away they're going to go away because it's going to get so hot after a while but jesus is in the fire just remember that's where he's at amen praise the lord amen you know there's a lot of things people try to fool one another when you're a christian see acting like it anyhow see but you just let that holy ghost go to boiling everything out it'll take all the fool's gold out of you too see fool's gold many people they go out west they find some fool's gold they think they struck a gold mine it shines better than the gold does but it's fool's gold it doesn't have any value to it amen praise the lord let's go here to first peter oh i love the lord first peter 4 look at what he says here and this is where people stumble and fall first peter 4 12 says beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you eat it not raw eat it without any water in it eat it not sodden but roasted completely with fire that means he's gonna bring you to a test and you know what it's your test now he brought me through one i've been through a couple of tests myself but my test is my test and your test is your test and your test is your test by the market and your test sister manna got that he's got a fiery trial he's got something in there that will make i mean look at what it did to the disciples them disciples thought they really understood jesus christ they really thought they had it but when they saw the word made flesh on a cross they all ran because there was a trial god was turning the heat up he's turning the heat up and turning the heat up they were so scared they hid out in the upper room for 10 days they had takeout who's going out i ain't going out they were afraid of everything their own shadow and everything and jesus had already come and met with them you ever think about that in the book of acts they were hiding out and they'd already seen him risen from the dead so why weren't they testifying huh why weren't they out testifying hey i saw him he rose from the dead no they weren't afraid because the fire's got it it's got to come and touch your life it's thinking not strange concerning the fire trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened on you but rejoice that's a trial in itself right there i feel like crying i feel like quitting i feel i just but god says rejoice and then again i say rejoice rejoice in the lord always right inasmuch as you are partakers of your lamb's sacrifice see that's what he told them in exodus 12 kill the lamb eat the lamb amen right he says rejoice because you are partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceedingly joy you think of how those three hebrew children and that fire was so hot seven times hotter than it ever been the trials in this age hour minute right now is hotter than it's ever been in any other age and those three hebrew children said are you going with me yeah shadrach let's go and when the glory was revealed to them they said hey you know what i don't even feel the fire and look there's the lamb he's in here with us and when they came out they were happy go and read it in the book of daniel they come out rejoicing amen amen joy cometh in the morning amen brother sister oh praise the lord look at romans 8. let's take a look at that one praise god oh my okay and and we'll go fast romans 8 verse 18 he says for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us amen in second timothy 2. let's go over there ii timothy 2 chapter 2. he says verse 1 he says so thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in jesus christ and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who should be able to teach others also if the lamb is too big for your house share it with your neighbor yes thou therefore endure hardship as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that worth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier you know when you join the army the first thing they do the first thing they do they love this they say brother first i know it's all about this they say here sign right here brother ferguson get a free college education yes sir buddy you got a va bill we're gonna get you a house ready to do everything do everything for you brother ferguson thank you side right here and as soon as he sat right there he said now you got no identity you go where i go you sit when i say sit you shut up when i say shut up stand up straight when i'm talking to you that's right because i own you and when you come into god's house brother branham said the smelter comes he says the first thing you got to lose your identity brother john you lost your identity get rid of that long hair yes get rid of all your old friends get rid of them but i like them i'm sorry i didn't ask you if you liked them i didn't ask you that get rid of them as a good soldier endure hardness brother ferguson sorry i think you failed but you was in the wrong army that's all i got to say wrong army he says so he says no man that worth entangled himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier god has chosen all of us amen amen and if a man also strived for masteries yet he's not crowned except you strive lawfully so that's very easy verse five is about you wanna you wanna become a lawyer well you go to school and get a law degree and don't cheat because we got tests to find out who the cheaters are and if you don't do it right right brother roger brother roger knows yeah i'm not trying to embarrass you but i'll tell you brother roger i understand he was training to be an electrician right couldn't pass the test but you might have been a good electrician could have been but if you can't pass a test i'm not giving you the certificate if you can't pass the test of god's word you're not getting the certificate if you can't pass it amen paul says to timothy he says he says listen he says the husband that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits and what that means is before you even even dream before i could even get behind here god says guess what brother bruce you're gonna get all their tests so that you know how they feel so that you can have compassion on them when you preach and not just beat them over the head oh yeah we're not talking about that verse 7 says consider what i say and the lord give the understanding in all things oh praise the lord all right look so we so let's go back here what are we talking about oh yeah full armor of god okay can you hang on for 15 minutes quick all right let's look at exodus 12. you don't have to answer because i'm i'm not stopping i remember you says brillo fontaine cervelo fontaine are you done he says i'm done when i'm finished all right so verse 11 says and thus shall you eat it with your loins skirted your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand you shall eat it in haste it is the lord's passover that what we see what we have been looking at tonight is how the believer is actually living out exodus 12 right now what about the rest of you guys come on come on come on amen right okay so now look let's go over here to ephesians six and keep your hand there on ephesians 12 or on exodus 12. so if you go over here to ephesians 6 now i don't know if you know this this little nugget but if you have a scofield bible and you read the footnotes at the beginning of the book of ephesians the theologians believe that the book the letter to the ephesians was never it was never labeled it wasn't labeled the letter to the ephesians and they actually believe that the book of ephesians was written to the lady of sans the same letter that went to the first church is the same letter that goes to the last church amen amen so look here he says in ephesians 6 10 it says finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power is might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil right because we're in the last stage the fire's been turned up right it says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities powers the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places therefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand he says stand there for having your loins gird about with truth okay exodus 11 says shall eat it with your loins girded okay so when they put this on you back in the roman days when they put this on you they had this it's like a uh a vest and they put it on over the over you put it on underneath and then you buckled it and then all of your armor attaches to that so if you don't have your loins gird about with truth you're lost you forgot your girdle you got to start with oh just put the breastplate on no no no because see the breastplate attaches to the truth the breastplate goes on the truth but you'll notice in exodus there is no breastplate because you know when they left egypt that night they weren't going into a battle they were going out into the wilderness i want you to notice something else he says put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in the evil day says therefore stand having your loin skirt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness so when you put on the breastplate that means the blood is covering your heart right because you're not righteous without his blood you put the breast plate on and that that protects all your good organs yeah it takes care of your heart takes care of your your ribs your liver your kidneys your gallbladder your stomach everything's all covered up with the breastplate you have the breastplate on but you see the children of israel in the first exodus they were going into a battle they didn't have a breastplate they didn't need a breastplate but you need one he says and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace okay so we look back in exodus 12 right have have your loins girded and your feet shod right the children of god will be known as peacemakers we're not separators we don't argue in fuss sometimes we do but that's only the flesh the heat needs to turn up because when the heat turns up we'll argue less and he says above all taking the shield of faith so now he says so now you've got the shield of faith i'm going to read you this quote brother branham says so he says the last plague is death not spiritually it's but spiritually speaking death spiritually in the church you notice amongst the sons spiritual death he says and now in christianity versus idolatry he says now he says no you got to put this on with an individual ought to be dressed let us put on the whole armor of god amen the helmet of salvation amen we got to put on the helmet of salvation that's the only way to protect you know somebody who's really saved they got a helmet on if you can convince somebody that they're not saved they'll take their helmet off you know what happens if you're in a battle and somebody's shooting at you with a a gun it'll take the whole you know if it shoots you here take the whole back of your head off but if you have the helmet of salvation on you're protected because we are in a battle brother branham said he says so he says you you put on the helmet of salvation he says and then he says put on this get this great big shield he says it's the size of a door oh you're oh praise lord a shield now when a christian comes in this army and you're issued all your stuff did you get issued all your stuff brother ferguson they gave you clothes they gave you boots they gave you everything well when you come in this army because you've never been in a battle before we're going to give you a shield this big that's right you know what happens in a roman army when they used to fight like that they just had their footmen foot men were expendable and so the footmen had the biggest shields and not only did the footmen have a big shield the idea was they had this really long spear because they didn't want to get close to the enemy so i got a big shield and i get this long spear now from here i can kill brother mark he can't get near me and then my brother next to me his she'll go right next to mine and we can all line up and then we can push the enemy back we don't have to get close to the enemy we don't have to fight with him we're just going to be here like this but see after you pass a test a while the sergeant comes out and says what are you doing do you want to fight like that are you fighting in the army of god first thing he does he takes away that big shield he says what do you want to be i think i might want to be an archer i said okay archer can't walk around with a shield the size of a door what's he gonna do with that so he maybe he don't get a shield maybe he gets a quiver and a bow and he hides behind the foot man yeah and they shoot the arrows up in the air they also back then what they used to do they'd all get back and they'd have like a thousand archers and they'd all pull back and they'd say fire and the enemy on the other side they're standing there with their shields and their spears and them arrows come down from the ceiling and if they don't have their breastplate on it goes right in their collarbone and kills them because the arrows are coming right down that's why you gotta have the shield ahead you gotta have the helmet of salvation on that's why you gotta have the shield of faith okay but now let's say you don't want to be archer maybe you want to be a commando you know see the commandos they're fearless commando he don't care i'll get right in front of that devil i want to fight him so you know you give that guy you give him a little shield maybe big enough that he can just strap it on his arm now he's flexible he can move that thing around because he's fast and they give him they don't give him a 10 foot long sword they have a little tiny sword because he's skilled at that and they train him and then when they go into battle they have this the guys that are weak in faith that have the big shields and the long spears they're in the front they're pushing the enemy back but then the commandos i say this guy archers shoot they shoot then the commandos come up the commandos sneak around they're fast they go out there and they just get right they get right in the face of the enemy yes look that's what paul is talking about here in the lady hussain book ephesian book he says verse 16 he says above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked that's what the shield's for a commando he can look because he's looking he's looking everywhere and when he sees the enemy coming in he's got he moves his shield up to block the dart to block the arrow and then he takes and he can cut into the enemy he can cut he can cut he can go he can push him back because he's got intelligence he's got the helmet he knows what god wants done with his word he has a strong arm of faith he's not hiding behind a shield he's right out there amen amen he says wherein you should be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god amen the word of god belongs to those that are of age right people come in they come into church they don't even i mean it's a sad thing it's a really sad thing this is a curse i'm telling you right now none of you that you didn't bring your bible tonight my bible is marked up yellow purple green blue yellow i got things underlying i got a little footnotes in there and and people that that's all they got is this they don't even look in the bible me i i kind of know where that one is it's on the right hand side of page of ephesians and it's the second column and it's marked somewhere i i may not know where the scriptures are but i know where they are in my book amen amen you know people don't even bring their bible no more they don't even do that they don't even buy bottles you see those people back there in in exodus they weren't going into a battle the battle didn't come until they had been tried and weeded out and they crossed over jordan into the promised land and then they had to put on the full armor but the christian church we're not going out like they did we're going right straight when you come in this church you coming right into a battlefield you're coming right in you
