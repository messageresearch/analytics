to him in a word prayer our heavenly father Lord we're about ready to read your word but we pray for the spirit of the word today that you would come and bring life into us your children Lord we welcome you to bring to manifestation The Living Word that we may walk out of here different than when we came Lord we pray for this grace we pray that you would come in a special way not only here in this room but also Lord be with those that are they're watching right now on the live stream makes you visit them and Grant a piece of yourself into each Heart Lord father we thank you for these things now and ask your blessings not only on the reading of this word but Lord this entire message now we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Amos chapter 8 starting with verse number 11. verse number 11 behold the days come saith the Lord God that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of the hearing the words of the Lord and they shall Wander from sea to Sea from the north even to the east and they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst amen may God add His blessings to this word as your be seated amen we want to entitle this message there is a famine in the land and for a subject God has sent a famine into churches yeah something we don't think about very much but you know I was thinking this morning every time we come to church there's a funeral and there's a birth because we are presented with the word and that word is either going to cause us to die out to self or to become bring forth a new life to that word it just all depends on where we're at during the Days of Elijah the Bible says that Ahab had done more evil in the sight of the Lord than all the other kings that were before to make matters worse he married Jezebel who we understand according to scriptures was fed to the dogs God did not think highly of her God had brought down judgment upon the land and Elijah said to Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be do nor Reign these years but according to my word so God sent a judgment in that time and there was no rain for about three and a half years and this having no rain caused the famine and this famine affected uh the poor the widows the sick The Afflicted people as well but God took care of even a widow woman amen amen and I believe God took care of her because she gave all she had to support the message of the hour the Bible tells us in Kings 17 for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the crews of oil fail until the day that the Lord senteth rain upon the Earth and she went and did according to the saying that Elijah of Elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days during this famine amen and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the crews of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah so as God shut up the Heavens of rain and caused this famine in the Days of Elijah Amos prophesied that there would be a famine in our day this day that we're living in brother Brandon said in the message thy house he says I want to say this that I believe too that the Bible said in the last days there will come a famine in the land and that famine won't be a bread and a water but for the hearing of the true word of God and people would run from the East and the west from the North and the South seeking to hear the word of the Lord and he said and we're just about living in that day that's what he said now he said that 62 years ago this Tuesday so I could say that officially we're living in the day of amos's Prophecy where God himself has sent a famine in the land it's not a famine of bread nor The Thirst of water but of the hearing of the words of the Lord not the speaking but of the hearing people who believe in God cannot hear the words of the Lord that's what this prophecy is about right because if you're seeking going here and there and you're looking there have to be someone that believes in God right right I know there's a lot of mixed up preaching going on in this world but the famine is not for the preaching it's because God has withheld his word to be heard the famine is of the hearing of the words of the Lord and God has sent the famine it's a famine happening to the ears to the ears amen God has restored his true word through a prophet in this age amen amen the heart of the children have been turned back to the original faith of their fathers Elijah has come first and restored all things as Jesus said amen all the Mysteries have been finished according to Revelations 10 7. amen but the famine is of the hearing of the words of the Lord the days have come when people don't want to hear the word of the Lord they'd rather have entertainment in the church they'd rather have things to make him laugh and feel good about themselves they rather hear things that help them to do what they want to do in their flesh and not have to do everything that the Bible says are you with me and still make it to heaven second Timothy chapter four Paul talking to Timothy here says I charged thee be therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and Doctrine in other words don't hold back don't hold back just give it your all why for the time will come I believe that time is here when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itchy ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall turn unto Fables their own ears don't want to hear the truth because it brings too much conviction to them so the famine is of the hearing of the words of the Lord amen the time is here where certain Believers can't stomach the full word the same word that the prophet has restored to us but they don't want it sound Doctrine but they can't do it they want a different lifestyle for themselves they want to do their own thing their own will and so they want to believe in God that fits their suit the thing is we need the complete Bible to make it man shall not live by bird alone but by every word we must have it we cannot make a Rapture with part of the word because he's coming for a bride without spot without Rinko one that has been dressed in the full word second Timothy 3 says all scripture is given by the inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect and thoroughly furnished unto all good works amen and that's what we want and instead of tallying up with the word their pride leads people to desire a certain type of teaching that fits their personal desires their personal lust their Personal Agenda the way they want to be more of a modern Christian one where faithfulness isn't really required anymore one where you don't have to pay tithes one where you don't have to worry about Holiness one where you don't have to love your enemies you don't have to die out every day like Jesus said see they're wanting a teaching that fits them they want to live the way their flesh wants to live and nobody is going to change their mind but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears there's a famine in the land today for the hearing of the word of the Lord and God has sent it second Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 10. and it's okay to say Amen to the word of course I do not recommend you ever saying Amen to my words because my words fail but if it's the word of the Lord you can say Amen to it II Thessalonians 2 10 and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they love not the truth that they might be saved because they received not the love of the truth I mean that they might be safe so it's not just here receiving the word of God we must receive the love of the word there's the key and for this cause God shall send them strong delusions that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but have pleasure in unrighteousness so God sends this famine and he sends these strong delusions that they were believable a lie but why why would God do this it's because they haven't received the love of the truth it's not in their heart they want to make it to Heaven they want to go to heaven they want to believe they're doing the right thing by going to church but there are certain aspects that they don't want to tally up to right and if we're missing the love for the truth we're going to miss God it's a heart condition the reason that people can't hear from God is because of a heart condition it's a spiritual heart disease and you know what it's caused by by it's caused by a love for yourself that's what causes the spiritual heart disease notice their pleasure was loving to do their own will amen and when we come into church all of us should be on this page God no matter what happens I want to please you more than anything amen because that's all that's going to matter when it's all over when a Believer chooses the broad way basically do whatever you want to do God will send them strong delusions strong evidence that is contrary to the truth did you ever like believe in something it was like so real when you found out it was wrong yep but you were willing to like fight for it at the time well that's what this is It's a powerful false belief and God is sending that upon people who've already made a choice in their heart that they don't want the word all because they didn't receive a perfect love for the truth having truth without love will only bring a man into bondage these church goers never pursued a love affair with the Lord and they didn't pursue a love affair relationship with the word it was like the word is different than God and church is different than God is what I think and feel and it's a parcel between me and him but God has given us his word to tell us who he is and God has given us this place for Perfection yes he's given us a five-fold Ministry man these these people these churchgoers they didn't want to lay everything aside and go after perfect love they didn't want to seek the things which are above they didn't want to accept their affections on on the Lord Jesus Christ they'd rather put their affections on the things of the Earth so God sends a famine of hearing the of hearing the words of the Lord and with it he sends strong delusions because of of a heart condition and Jesus gives a parable about heart conditions there were four different types of conditions of a heart that the same word fell upon and Believers are coming to church I'll say it like this without proper heart preparation and that's the problem they're not hearing from God that's the reason they're not hearing from God they think they can just pop into church and they ought to be hearing something to encourage them or help them and I'll tell you God is God he's serious and he means business he deserves reverence and respect and he deserves our hearts to be prepared now it's different if you've never been here before and you don't you've never heard the truth amen God understands that but after a while God expects you Amen to come into His Sanctuary with a heart that's prepared for his word to fall into I think more good will happen to our lives the better we can prepare we've already tried getting the best ministers there were in this message and I'm thankful for them I love them I do every one of them but that isn't enough to change us right Jesus himself could be standing here teaching the word of God the same word but if our heart isn't prepared to receive it if we're not in love with that word what good would it do amen so when these people don't find the word of the Lord or they don't find God in the word that's being preached when they can't hear with their hearts the word of the Lord they wander off in the wilderness the Bible says they wander and run to and fro and seek the word of the Lord in other things but the Bible says they can't find it people are looking for something that's already here they just don't see it now we know the culmination of the Rapture is just around the corner but the kingdom has been coming all along the kingdom has been being preached to us all along Luke chapter 17 if you like to turn there with me Luke chapter 17 verse 20 and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God doesn't come with observation now there's such a powerful message in this the kingdom of God cometh not with observation too many people today are looking for God with these eyes well what did you see in church what happened that word observation means inspection it also means of oscarla akuler I'm sorry o-c-u-l-a-r acular evidence what does that really mean I had to look it up it means connected with the vision of the eyes so the kingdom is not coming with an inspection of what these eyes can see it's not by inspecting to see evidence with our eyes whether God is with us or not if people are looking to see something outwardly when they come to church they're going by their feelings they're going by their looks they're you know what happened to this person what happened to that person and by these things they can believe a little bit more so that's what psychologically is going on inside of them but that is not how the kingdom of God is coming too often believers who don't prepare their hearts right before service they come into service with a carnal mindset inspecting to see evidence with your eyes instead of hearing from God through the word separating the two not recognizing God in the word verse 21 says neither shall they say Lo here or there for behold the kingdom of God is within you we ought to be looking inside here to hear from God this is where he's coming it doesn't matter what happens out here that's right this doesn't change you if everybody stood up spoke in tongues and ran from one side to the next side all said Hallelujah we were dancing in the spirit for two hours that doesn't mean the inside of the inside is going to change the word has to change our nature on the inside the kingdom of God is within you the voice is heard on the inside we ought to be paying attention to the inside that's where the famine is happening today the famine is happening in here the errors are shut off didn't you say something about that to the laodicean church age right get something so you can hear and he said unto his disciples in verse 22 the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man you shall not see it and they shall say unto you see hear or see there he said go not after them nor follow them see they're running to and fro in Matthew Matthew said it like this Jesus said If any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not it's not about being in the right location it's about having Jesus on the inside it's about being in the right place in your heart that's the place you're going to meet him [Applause] look you could meet him in your car you can meet him in your bedroom why would you entertain a thought God ain't here why would you do that because carnally you're not sitting right you're sitting in the flesh your heart's not right get your heart right you'll see Jesus and everything get your heart right you'll see Jesus in everything you do because as I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world I don't care if you're in the Lion's Den I don't care if you're in the belly of a fish I don't care if you're going through a fiery furnace I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you it's dropped down to verse 32 in Luke 17 here Jesus said remember Lot's wife all right talking about the last days now famine strong delusions he said whosoever shall seek to save his life is going to lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it so Jesus is telling us the way that we escape the judgment is to forsake loving ourselves amen lose it just lose it who cares because you're gonna find him you're going to find life but you stay in love with yourself that means you have to get rid of the word because the flesh is always going to be enmity with with God the Cardinal mind the carnal way of looking at things verse 34 I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken the other left two men shall be in the few the one shall be taken and the one shall be left and they answered and said unto him where where first it was when right the beginning it was when so the kingdom of God come now it's where Lord where is this going to happen and Jesus answered them wheresoever the body is there another the Eagles would be gathered together do you catch that it's happening right now in our midst right here the Eagles are being caught up into Heavenly places and the the unbelievers being left behind I don't care if you're in a field I don't care if you're in a bed it's invisible happening Among Us summer in the famine some are given their heart to Jesus Christ others are left down here to wander Where's God I didn't see God where was God today did you get anything out of the message wandering but not the Eagles because they're an eagle the elect or the elect those that love God love God [Music] that's all there is to it you know we all want to just believe I love God I'm an eagle I'm predestined and I'm happy let's get on that bandwagon but when it comes down to it we gotta start living that word that word has got to be real in our lives it's got to be manifested in our lives [Music] so here it is in our midst God is hid in simplicity God knows how to hide himself from the wise and prudence and he knows how to unveil himself to babes who are the babes they just love the truth they have a love for the word it means a lot to them it means everything to them amen look back at Amos 8 12 again what happens who can't hear the words of the Lord and they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from the north even to the East and they shall run to and fro and to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it shall not find it because they loved their will more than they love the truth that's why you that's why people can't find it they're stuck in their own life they're not about seeking first the kingdom of God it's a scary place to be being a instead of loving the word and tallying up with the word they've turned their ears from the truth you know what I'll just I'll just leave I'll just shut it off I'll just leave the sanctuary I just won't come come on now this is what's happening amen they're turning their ears from the truth and shall turn onto Fables untruths things that are not real for the time has arrived that they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own desire their own lust they shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears you ever have an itch I have I'll tell you for whatever reason all my life I mean like 30 years before I started preaching my ears always had an itch and you just kind of got to get a steroid or something just to like calm that down but you know how it is when you're you're hearing something you ever had a talk with your mom and your dad and your mom and dad who's trying to tell you something and you're going to relate sometimes we're sitting Church yeah I've heard this sometimes when we're hearing something you know we just get bothered by it that's irritating that preaching is irritating me and we just like want to turn from that and we want something different can you understand what's happening here in the presence of God that attitude he's God's got to correct that attitude before he's going to bless you it's just all there is to it so after Jesus shares the parable of the four different types of heart condition right here in Matthew 13 if you want to turn there verse number nine he says who have ears to hear Let Him hear not everybody can hear There's a Great Famine in this hour and look verse 10 the disciples came and said unto Jesus why do you speak unto them in parables why are you talking in a way that is hard to understand just tell us plainly and he answered and said to them because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but unto them it is not given God is always in a place where he's trying to give the truth to somebody and keep it from somebody else amen always but why because some love him and some do not right amen It's A Love Affair it ain't how smart you can it ain't where you came from it's not about your education it's not how old you are it's not how many chances you've had it's about your heart condition if you just love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all they sow with all they might God wants to reveal himself to you [Music] very well and God knows the condition of all of our hearts today every day when we wake up every day we come to church and that's what he's looking at and everything that's based that happens I'll tell you this is how important what I am telling you is all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord thy God amen and are called according to his purpose of course if you love him with all your heart the only thing you want to do is what he has called you to do but if you only love them so much and you want to do your purpose there's something missing in that love affair yes now I know this is like a strong message but that doesn't mean you can't be happy you can still be happy it's the word is still the word verse 12 for whosoever have to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance that sounds good but whosoever have not from him shall be taken away even away even that which he have well that don't sound Fair what's Jesus referring to here he's referring to whosoever has love who's been given a love for the truth is given them a portion of Truth if you love you will be given more truth but if you don't love like you should love the truth and that which you have will be taken away from you remember Jesus told Pilate before it was crucified and asked them Jesus said everyone that is of Truth hereareth my voice remember when he said that if you're of truth you're going to love truth it don't matter if it takes the hide off of you it don't matter how it makes you feel because it is the truth that sets us free I am the the truth and the life verse 13 therefore speak I to them in Parables because they seen see not and they hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah's word saith by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and see and you shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is waxed growth and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have clothes see look at us all three more agency amen all three more agency They Don't Love the truth this people's heart is wax gross did not Jesus say because iniquity abound in this age the love of many would wax cold and what brother van tell us iniquity it was two free more agency is not doing what you know you should be doing whatever it is that God has spoke to you God is revealed it's still important to him today as the moment he told you this is the hardest age to live in it's so easy to have iniquity iniquity is not you know some going to the bar and doing some real bad thing iniquity can be simply I I don't feel like praying very much today it's true you think it's not that big a deal well because iniquity is more and more and more in people's life the love of many is waxing cold their ears are dull that means heavy of hearing their spiritual senses are not in tune with the lord they're not interested in what God has been telling them but after their own lust and their desires they've turned away their ears from the truth did you know before Eve could ever fall she had to turn away from God right amen before we ever do anything bad remember this we first had to turn down God so if the word is irritating you get in love with the word don't blame the preacher don't blame the messenger don't blame the source well that's not how I seek out it doesn't matter how you see God it matters what the word says He is search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they that testify of me the word declares who God is yes verse 15 for this people's heart is wax gross in their ears are dull of hearing their eyes have been closed let's say anything they should see with their ears see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand what their heart and should be converted that's what the word does it's perfect it converts the soul and I should heal them it's the word we need the word but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear [Music] you have been put in a different category you are sitting in a category that is hearing the voice of God that something is registering in here and you want to please that word that's inside because that word is the Holy Ghost it's the Living Word of God is God in you the hope of glory so I say I want to say Amen to what Jesus is saying blessed are your ears your ears are different because you're the truth no they're the truth hear my voice you've got to agree with the word you got to believe it look at if you're sitting here waiting for feelings to change before you're going to create the word you're going to miss it it doesn't come with observation you've got to be connected to this word you got to be born of this word you're born again by the word of God and Incorruptible see that abideth forever we ought to be so happy to know that our ears can hear in our eyes can see because we're a blessed people verse 17 forever saying to the many prophets and righteous men have desire to see the things which you see and have not seen them and to hear the things that uh which ye hear and have not heard them that we're living in the greatest hour this is the hour that's ushering in the coming of the lord and there are so many people who are not hearing the voice of God they just come to church lead the church and they don't realize that they're in worse shape you're one or the other when you come to church but here we are in the greatest age when there's a famine when there's strong delusions around us when people are just wandering around aimlessly have no purpose not he they're certainly not being called to the purpose of God and God has opened your eyes God has blessed your ears God has given you an understanding heart in the midst of this Darkness here we are the children of light my sheep hear my voice and they follow me John 10 verse 3 says to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and he leadeth them out now he might not say John Keith Martin but when he speaks something in here tells me I'm Mrs Jesus okay I'm connected to him though all heaven is named under Jesus right that's what the scripture tells us he calls his own Sheep by name and he leads them out praise God what's he lead him out of does he lead him out of a man-made system we could say Amen leads them out of the world we could say Amen but it leads them out of themselves I want to be set free from this bondage right here this this flesh that's always in getting in the way that's what he's leading us and the word is setting us free he that the son is set free is free indeed don't desire to be in bondage verse 4 and when he put it forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice so he's going out and the voice is saying follow me and the Sheep are following but is he just taking him on a trip in the pasture just hey we're gonna go out come back get inside the what is he what is he telling them to follow what is he at what is he telling them to follow well Jesus said If any man will follow me let him deny himself amen pick up his cross and follow me so when God is speaking to you he's speaking you to die out to self to pick up his will and follow him wherever he leads you I'll tell you live in a Christian life is not easy right when you're hanging on to your flesh but when you're willing to give up everything you're happy you're so happy Jesus set me free tell me you love the word so here we are we're sitting in church today with three types of believers not saying just every church has three types of Believers you heard that you know the you know it right we know that two of them end up in the same spot they'll make the make-believer and the unbeliever they end up in the same spot but then there's the believer and that believer is you and your eyes are blessed because you're a believer your ears are blessed because when you hear the word you say Amen to it because the Holy Ghost says Amen to every word of God why when the Holy Ghost and you say Amen to every word of God well brother John I say Amen more if you help me just say Amen more well then that wouldn't be the Holy Ghost and you saying amen would it be it'd be some enthusiastic fun joke it's the word it's it's coming without observation we don't want to be bothered by anyone in church we got to be mature as far as I'm concerned unbelievers are allowed to be here make Believers are allowed to be here because this is not my house this is God's house and he would at all would be saved all would come to him and God is good to the to his enemies to the good to the he's good to everybody he's the same you can't tell who's a Believer who's not a Believer by God's goodness he's so good but sometimes we can look at one another and tell whether it's God operating to us I always like what they said about Brother Band they couldn't tell us enemies from his friends because it was the same holy ghost in them treating everybody the same God has personally provided a place for every one of us here to meet with God to hear his voice and to receive the word into your heart now God has provided that for you personally if nobody else was here except you it would be between you and God and that's the way you need to come to church not about I wonder how things are going to be when you know I hope you know everybody no you be the one to meet with God it's all about you brother Brandon said in the message God has provided a way he said just pray I'm reading this quote because I don't want us to ever be bothered by anybody he said just pray sincerely he said don't be nervous if you do you'll never catch it just be simple just say Lord It's the Simplicity that they overlook they make it so complicated that's the reason they miss Jesus in the first place [Music] he's hid right here in Simplicity it just takes belief a belief that it is God speaking to me we're not here at church listening to John Martin's study John Martin's interpretation of the Bible no our faith is much higher than that look at the children of Israel when they were in Egypt one of the plagues is that there was darkness in the land of Egypt but in the uh where the children of Israel were staying in their homes they had light God is able to give one person light and let another person just roam in darkness in the same place the same word it's the word that gives light to us his word is a lamp to our our uh our our feet a light to our path uh a lamp to our path you know the scripture even if I don't know the scripture you know the scripture Zechariah 14 6 says now just listen to these words here as I try to get through this quick and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear in the dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light amen amen this is the evening time God has sent a message to just Shine the Light on everything not just the mysteries in the Bible not just making sure that you know we're baptized the correct way because you know there is an incorrect way to be baptized but To Shine the Light on Jesus Christ being the same today in my life as he was yesterday amen now what it's really going to take to make the rapture to to not elect this famine affect me hey hey if somebody doesn't want to love the word don't let it affect you love the word if you you've been caught up in in in in in issues and you haven't been coming to church just make her coming to church right make it right with God just say from this point forward I'm going to start coming to church with a love for the word not just part of the word can you imagine Jesus staying here standing here and says I love you and I give you this I'm going to meet this need and I'm going to and and and and and I want you to do this it's the word we should be interested in the in doing the word that we're not doing because the Bible says when he the spirit of truth will come he will lead and guide you into all truth hey now look I'm just going to be honest with you I've been baptized the correct way I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now there was a time in my life that I was baptized incorrectly in titles father son Holy Ghost and the spirit of Truth came and led me into the correct baptism amen and so I just got back re-baptized the correct way according to the scriptures according to the example given in in the book of Acts by all the apostles there's no question in my mind there's no doubt in my mind and here I stand today but you know the holy spirit is not leading guide me into that anymore because I'm already walking into that light so the holy spirit is here leading and guiding you out of Darkness into his light it ain't good enough to say I'm in the message he's trying to get the message in you all the message so let him speak to your heart let him bring conviction because that is the job of the Holy Ghost [Music] and we welcome him Isaiah 60 verse 2 says for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people pull this up but the Lord shall arise upon thee notice the whole world the whole Earth is in darkness and it's on all the people but the Lord we found favor in the sight of the Lord God has brought this truth to you and he shined his light upon you we ought to be the happiest people we shouldn't be waiting for something to make us feel good we he's already given us eternal life he's already showing us the truth just keep rejoicing in what he's given you [Music] now here's what we got to do it's verse one arise and shine for thy light has come in the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee amen if God is in your life then seek those things which are above arise and let others know that that God is real and he wants to save them to bring them into a greater truth I'd rather spend my life trying to help somebody to this word than spend any time anything else and I know we got to work we got to clean we got to eat but did you know that somehow gets mixed up like we don't know where the line is at right I'll tell you where the line is at is Is Your Love Affair the more you love them the more you can't get your mind off of them take this whole world but give me Jesus how's that that song that sister Lucille had often sung about uh the shutters need to be repaired This Old House is in need of repair but for some reason I just can't get motivated to do it I got leaving on my mind that he's coming soon and we just got to remind one another remind one another he's coming soon don't wait for the pulpit to tell you Christ and you can help one another we're a body Ministry amen so if you want to Feast during this famine fall in love with the truth amen the key is love to love the Lord thy God with all that heart with all they sow with all they might oh my too many people are missing hearing the words of the Lord because their heart is not prepared they're not in love with why they're here brother Brian said in the third seal he says not the others they sure won't do it they'll miss it a million miles we've been through all that and show how they missed John they missed Elijah they missed Jesus how they uh how they miss them all the way along and they'll do the same thing because the Bible said they would see so then in that time it'll be very humble it'll be so simple that'll make people fall away from it it's too simple for them we find out and always when people get smart and educated and know a whole lot then they they just miss it you know Jesus never took them kind of people for to be his disciples he took unlearned people fishermen and nobodies that was connected with their church and things he just got ordinary men Tax Collectors Farmers fishermen and so forth to do his work see because they know they're nothing then he can make something out of them as long as they keep knowing that they're nothing then God can work through them so it's something that we gotta every day nowhere nothing Romans 10 16 says but they have not obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who have believed our report so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so faith comes when we hear the word of God but there's a famine in the land for the hearing of the word so if we're not hearing the word we're not getting faith and Jesus said when he returns shall he find faith on the Earth you know who's going to hear it his own elect that are crying day or night help me Lord I really want you but if we're not crying day and night we don't we're not that hard for God no no this may not be what you want to hear but this is what we need it I say to the bride here blessed are your ears for they hear your eyes for they see I say to the bride fear not little flock it's the father's good pleasure to give it to you regardless of what's going on in your family if you're going to wait till somebody straightens up in your family you're making a mistake two will be in the bed one will be taken two will be in church one's going to be caught up in Heavenly places just praising God for the word and the other is going to be like what's going on just kind of wandering around help us Lord Jesus said he's coming as a thief in the night and the bride is going to be ready that's the only group that's going to be ready she's the little flock and she's going to get ready without any observation because the kingdom is coming into her without observation the Rapture is going to be a secret the nature change is going to be a secret now I know we'll see the manifestations and you'll see the manifestations in your own life when something happens on the inside but you know there's churches out there that say they didn't have a good service because they didn't see the spirit of God move I'll tell you when God just speaks one word to your heart you had a good service [Music] it's coming without observation the Rapture has already started we've already heard the shout we're putting our clothes on as brother Batman has said there's there's a voice behind that voice we didn't just hear the voice of a man we heard the voice of God in that man now God's entire coming is a secret and we got to get this it it's not a even though there's this message is full of publicity there's people who just want to be something and they want to be recognized and shown I am telling you that this Rapture is not going to be a public show our heavenly father is revealing this message to the bride in secret it's happening in here they're like literally believing the word that's being preached and they're going home and saying God let me live that word [Music] It's A Love Affair brother Brandon said the third poll will not be a public show the seventh seal the seventh seal came in three measures three parts which the last part is the coming of the Lord and he said that won't be a public show so we need to look at Christ in this word not with observation but we need to come in the spirit it's almost like if we could just have service the whole service and close our eyes and do nothing except listen for that voice to speak because every time our eyes open we're distracted about this and that right brother Brandon said in the message why are people so tossed about he said there was that the voice spoke to him and says now the first time I spoke with you you put your hands on the people and you told them what was wrong with them and the second poll why when you did you know you know the secrets of their hearts and I made you a seer before the people but you know you're always trying to explain it and you ought not to have done that said you made a public show of it brother Branham says I'm very sorry says I noticed to my left which would be to my right if I was on the platform a little a little wooden building and I seen that light and you all have a picture of it you know it I I have one picture in my office anybody wants to see it it's always in the meetings I've seen that light leave me and go to that building and the voice said to me I'll meet you there and that'll be the third poll and brother Brandon said why and he said it won't be a public show like the others what God is going to do for the bride isn't going to be a public show we have got to start getting serious and sincere with God Alone this word has got to mean more to us it's a love affair and we've got to meet God in that secret place in the message the seventh seal he said we're at the end the opening of the seventh seal now how did I know the other day last Sunday a week ago today when I was preaching on be humble be humble remember God deals with those little things he says I didn't realize it what I was talking about and now I see it it's in such a humble way so if you want to read that that was God hidden Simplicity then revealed and the same so God was saying things that he didn't even realize why he was saying it but God Was preparing the bride for the for the for the masses for the seals now at the end seal the seventh seal when it starts it's a three-fold manner will be absolutely a total Secret it's according to the Bible That's What brother Brandon said he said it was so great tilt was Kept Secret from the angels now why if Satan should get a hold of it he might do great damage there is one thing he don't know he can interpret anything he wants to and he can personally any kind of gift but he can't know this it's not even written in the word it's a total Secret the Bible says that not no man knoweth the day or the hour not even the angels in heaven know when he's coming it'll be impossible for any minister to stand up and say he's coming tomorrow and even if it were to happen my question to you is would you be ready in 24 hours what is the purpose for coming to church heavy service we're coming to get the word to hear the word to become the word when Jesus told Peter he said flesh and blood is not revealed this to you Peter but my Father which is in heaven he has revealed it and Upon This Rock I'll build my church his church and the gates of hell should not Prevail against it well the Rapture is a revelation it will be given to you by the father now I want to just say this don't sit around waiting hoping that that last moment time that God will just give you the okay to hear that voice you ought to come to church every service with that expectation amen God I want to hear from you because I know the word that you're giving me today is going to get me dressed for the Rapture coming tomorrow and this this message is is to provoke us to provoke us to dig in with Christ dig in more don't allow this famine that's in the land this I'm not hearing from the Lord will do something about it do something about it I got to hear from you Lord I got to get more serious God is not going to come by John Martin's house and says hey look just you know get ready make sure you you got your animals fed and everything the Rapture is coming tomorrow it's not going to happen we have to live close with them at the love them we got to come into church with a renewed heart I love this word I'm going to fall in love with this word I'm not going to allow things to to become secondary I'm not going to let the word just fall off my back uh it's going to mean much God wants this word to mean as much to you as it means to him the same amount just love that word as much as he does and if you do everything is going to be okay amen do you believe that blessed are your ears for they here let's Stand Together foreign watching that story or maybe even the movie about The Ten Commandments and just thinking that there was Darkness everywhere but the children of Israel had light brother bam talked about these two people I think it was a story the two people came out of his meeting they heard the same message and one of them got all bothered and offended about what was preached he said I can't believe it he called me some chicken and the other said are you really I was in the same mean I he called me an eagle the same message at the redeemed of the Lord say so if you've been redeemed rejoice amen create such an atmosphere around you that your body will have to start listening to you amen it's saying open open our eyes Lord [Music] open our we want to see Jesus to reach out and touching to say that we love him open our ears Lord and help us to listen oh open our eyes Lord I want to see amen let's

says that he is able to make all grace abound to you I believe he's just looking for more of a surrender now I know we've all given our heart to the Lord but I believe it's always in order to check up
