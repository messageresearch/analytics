[14:28] amen
[14:29] hallelujah well let's change the order
[14:32] of service
[14:32] here we just have one request but
[14:36] i think there's many on our hearts and
[14:39] i think everybody knows that jerry mead
[14:43] passed away
[14:45] so let's just keep the mead family
[14:47] lifted up and the chenault family lift
[14:49] it up
[14:54] it brings reality home when
[14:57] somebody really close to your passes
[14:59] away like that
[15:01] because all of a sudden
[15:04] wow you know you're just talking to them
[15:06] the day before or you were just
[15:08] you know fellowshipping with them or
[15:11] maybe even on the phone
[15:12] and all of a sudden they're not there
[15:13] anymore it shows us how
[15:16] frail our lives really are and how
[15:21] about a short time you know
[15:24] we're going to meet jesus you know for
[15:27] him he's on his way to glory
[15:29] for us we're so here and it shows us
[15:32] that
[15:33] you know if there was something that we
[15:34] wanted to do the next day we couldn't do
[15:36] it
[15:37] if there's somebody we wanted to
[15:40] talk to the lord about it's gone you
[15:43] can't do that now
[15:44] so we need to be diligent about
[15:48] just following what the holy ghost says
[15:50] he says go talk to that person
[15:52] stop what you doing go talk to that
[15:54] person don't make
[15:55] well you know i'll do that tomorrow
[15:59] because tomorrow comes and then tomorrow
[16:01] the next day comes
[16:02] right so
[16:06] if there's ever a time that we need to
[16:08] be
[16:09] winning souls for christ it's now it's a
[16:12] lot of people
[16:13] looking for an answer to just a lot of
[16:15] people
[16:16] looking for peace and out there because
[16:18] there is no peace out there
[16:20] other other than christ amen

[34:55] direction and then when this

[36:55] your hands for your honor and glory we
[36:57] pray
[36:58] in jesus precious name amen
[37:02] amen exodus chapter 33
[37:05] and this is the time that
[37:09] moses was seeking
[37:12] a a clear vision of the lord
[37:16] and we'll start with verse number 20
[37:20] and he said thou canst not
[37:23] see my face god's speaking to moses here
[37:26] for there shall no man see me
[37:30] and live and the lord said
[37:33] behold there is a place by me
[37:37] amen and thou shalt stand upon a rock
[37:41] and it shall come to pass while my glory
[37:44] passes by
[37:46] that i will put thee in a cleft of the
[37:49] rock
[37:50] and will cover thee with my hand
[37:53] while i pass by amen god bless you may
[37:56] be seated
[38:02] god wants us to stand by him
[38:05] he has a place for us amen
[38:08] there's a little cleft in the rock
[38:11] praise god
[38:13] well we've mentioned this i believe
[38:16] in past but most people know
[38:19] dwayne johnson as the rock
[38:25] he was a professional wrestler he later
[38:28] became
[38:29] a hollywood icon as an actor that fans
[38:32] grew to love and people saw him as
[38:35] very muscular his body was described as
[38:39] being chiseled and swollen
[38:41] cut and and ripped and jacked
[38:45] and there's definitions for all of them
[38:49] he carried his own image of toughness
[38:52] and strength and when people saw him in
[38:55] film
[38:57] they knew when he was there that he was
[38:59] going to take care of business
[39:01] he was the go-to man he brought a a
[39:05] sense of feeling of security
[39:08] that everything was going to be all
[39:09] right and and heroism
[39:12] and when it comes to entertainment that
[39:14] is exactly what the world is looking for
[39:18] but when it comes to real life issues
[39:21] that hollywood image doesn't help
[39:27] to the believer he has found jesus
[39:30] to be the rock of ages
[39:34] now jesus he didn't have much of a
[39:36] physical
[39:37] physique his body wasn't chiseled or
[39:40] ripped
[39:42] there wasn't much to behold isaiah 53
[39:46] verse 2 says he had no form
[39:48] nor comeliness and when we would see him
[39:52] there's no beauty that we should desire
[39:54] him
[39:55] so quite contrary to dwayne johnson the
[39:59] rock
[40:00] we're talking about two different rocks
[40:02] here amen
[40:05] he didn't have the fame and fortune like
[40:08] dwayne johnson
[40:11] he was just the opposite actually
[40:15] verse three said he was despised and he
[40:18] was rejected of men
[40:20] a man of sorrows acquainted with greece
[40:24] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[40:26] in other words
[40:28] people didn't want to watch jesus on tv
[40:33] he was despised and we esteemed a knot
[40:37] they mocked him in in many ways they
[40:39] ridiculed him they whipped him they
[40:41] called him
[40:42] beelzebub an illegitimate child
[40:45] a carpenter's son he was a a
[40:48] troublemaker
[40:49] a liar he was accused of a lot
[40:57] why he looked about 20 years older than
[41:00] his age
[41:04] he packed the sins of the world on his
[41:07] shoulders
[41:09] verse 4 he had borne our griefs and he
[41:13] carried our sorrows amen
[41:17] hollywood would have passed them up
[41:20] but to those who really know him oh
[41:23] they're singing past me not
[41:24] old gentle savior hear my humble cry
[41:28] one others are calling do not pass me by
[41:33] he could never compete with the culture
[41:36] of hollywood
[41:39] people in hollywood they love horror
[41:41] films
[41:42] killings comedy gay and lesbian
[41:46] relationships
[41:49] hey that's what's on you don't hear that
[41:52] people
[41:52] are boycotting the tv no
[41:57] that's what they want
[42:00] no he would never have had a star rating
[42:04] on tv
[42:06] but those who know him know him as the
[42:09] bright morning star
[42:12] he's the north star that always points
[42:14] us true north
[42:16] right back to the word he is the star
[42:19] that is shining
[42:20] in our own world he's the star that
[42:23] gives us light in the midst of the
[42:25] darkness that's all around us
[42:27] psalms 27 verse 1 the lord is my light
[42:31] and my salvation
[42:32] whom shall i fear the lord is the
[42:35] strength of my life
[42:36] whom shall i be afraid good questions to
[42:40] ask
[42:42] there's nothing to fear when god puts us
[42:45] in the cleft of the rock
[42:47] and covers us with his hand there is
[42:49] nothing to fear
[42:51] amen there's nothing to be afraid of
[42:54] who's going to get to us
[42:57] what's going to penetrate the armor of
[42:59] god nothing can
[43:00] nothing he holds us in the palm of his
[43:03] hand and no man
[43:04] can pluck us out amen he has tucked his
[43:07] way
[43:08] in the cleft of the rock second timothy
[43:11] chapter 1 verse 7 says for god have not
[43:13] given us
[43:14] the spirit of fear but a power and of
[43:17] love
[43:18] and of a sound mind fear is
[43:21] not of god we read in our men's meeting
[43:25] first john chapter 4 verse 18
[43:27] that there is no fear in love
[43:32] but perfect love cast out fear because
[43:35] fear of torment
[43:36] and he that feareth is not made perfect
[43:38] in love and when you're standing
[43:40] on this rock that he's placed by him
[43:44] there is no fear on that rock
[43:48] there's only love because you're in the
[43:51] presence
[43:51] of jehovah so there's nothing to fear
[43:55] when you're standing on the rock amen
[43:58] amen amen praise the lord
[44:01] jesus really wasn't fitly framed
[44:05] but he sure framed our lives he took her
[44:08] lives which were
[44:09] without uh form and
[44:12] and they were void and he took him and
[44:15] he gave us
[44:16] uh a frittly a a frame a life
[44:19] a nature change and he made us uh
[44:22] made us new if i could say it like that
[44:26] he chiseled he chiseled
[44:30] a new creature out of us
[44:36] wasn't chiseled but he
[44:39] he was chiseled out of god
[44:42] brother man said he came from god he
[44:45] came out of god the longest that came
[44:48] out
[44:51] he became our savior no doubt
[44:55] we're living in a very troubled time
[44:57] very
[44:58] troubled world it's perilous times
[45:01] the bible says it's going to get worse
[45:03] and worse we can see today that we're
[45:05] living in an
[45:06] hour that the love of many has wax
[45:09] cold they're no longer getting it
[45:12] they're they're waxing cold there's less
[45:15] and less
[45:16] love more and more hatred
[45:20] we all keep wanting to hold on for for
[45:22] something to be better things
[45:24] to turn around but it's not going to get
[45:26] better for the world
[45:28] we ought to be focusing on getting ready
[45:30] to leave that
[45:32] jesus is coming soon
[45:35] just let that go with all the confusion
[45:38] going around
[45:39] there's a place there's
[45:43] a place of shelter in the midst of the
[45:46] storm
[45:48] god has prepared a place for you and i
[45:50] to stand
[45:52] it's a rock it's a rock for you
[45:57] we want to focus on that rock because
[45:59] it's it takes
[46:00] god to show us what that rock is
[46:06] we'd like to say it is this word we know
[46:08] this word is the rock we know
[46:10] jesus is the rock but i'm talking about
[46:13] the rock for your situation
[46:17] there's a rock when we're in our place
[46:22] when we're standing on the rock next to
[46:23] god nothing
[46:25] can touch us isaiah chapter 32 verse 2
[46:29] says
[46:29] a man isaiah 32 verse 2 a
[46:33] man shall be as in hiding place from the
[46:37] wind
[46:39] and a cover from the tempest as the
[46:43] rivers of water in a dry place
[46:45] is the shadows of a great rock and a
[46:47] weary land
[46:48] a man can be so one with god
[46:51] that he himself can be a hiding place
[46:54] from the storm
[46:57] in christ amen when christ is in you
[47:00] you are a hiding place
[47:04] john 14 verse 20 at that day ye shall
[47:08] know that i am in the father and ye me
[47:09] and
[47:10] i in you it's a union together amen
[47:14] isaiah uh i'm sorry uh psalms 91 verse 1
[47:19] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[47:22] the most high
[47:24] shall abide under the shadow of the
[47:26] almighty i will say of the lord
[47:27] he is my refuge my fortress my god
[47:31] in him will i trust amen
[47:35] trust is the key amen no matter what
[47:37] you're going to
[47:39] trust is the key when you're dwelling
[47:42] in the secret place you're dwelling with
[47:44] christ you're dwelling in the rock
[47:46] that trust
[47:50] nothing can move you because god won't
[47:54] let anything move you
[47:56] when you put your trust in him that's
[47:58] all he wants you to do
[48:00] you don't got to sit there and and fix
[48:02] the problem all
[48:03] you got to do is trust the lord he'll
[48:05] fix the problem
[48:09] he don't want competition with you you
[48:12] know if you think about that's the
[48:14] nature we were born with i'm going to
[48:15] handle i'm going to do this i'm going to
[48:17] control this god wants us to forfeit
[48:20] that and just
[48:21] trust him for the situation
[48:24] he is my refuge and my fortress in
[48:28] god i will trust now when you're
[48:31] standing on the rock
[48:33] think about this i believe
[48:36] it's isaiah
[48:40] tells us that he dwelleth in the high
[48:44] and lofty place but he also dwells with
[48:47] them
[48:48] of a humble and contrite spirit
[48:51] so what does god do he brings us up
[48:54] to how many places with him
[48:58] so when we're on the rock i want you to
[49:00] imagine
[49:01] you're not down here in your situation
[49:06] you're you're in a high place
[49:09] you're standing you're risen now you've
[49:11] risen
[49:12] with christ the bible says when you set
[49:16] your affections on things above
[49:18] then you're risen with christ for you
[49:21] are dead colossians 3
[49:23] 3 says and your life is hid
[49:26] with christ in god and nobody can see it
[49:29] nobody knows it but you know because
[49:32] you're hid away with god
[49:34] nothing is affecting you
[49:40] nothing
[49:43] can you imagine god
[49:47] being affected
[49:52] because the check didn't come in
[49:55] because you got a flat tire
[49:59] god is not affected
[50:05] when you're in christ all is well
[50:08] but the thing is it's not knowing
[50:13] it's not knowing not knowing the message
[50:16] not knowing the bible
[50:17] is that knowing that christ is the rock
[50:22] the rock is hearing his
[50:25] voice right now for your situation and
[50:28] where to stand
[50:29] in that situation that's the rock it's
[50:31] an invisible rock
[50:38] it doesn't matter the troublesome time
[50:40] that we're living in
[50:41] we have a rock in the midst of
[50:44] of of the confusion and chaos and
[50:46] persecution people trying to
[50:48] destroy us and destroy our reputation i
[50:50] say
[50:51] we have a rock to stand on we're not
[50:54] left alone
[50:57] turn with me if you would to first kings
[50:59] chapter 19.
[51:01] verse number nine first kings chapter 19
[51:04] verse 9.
[51:11] elijah was kind of in a turmoil
[51:14] situation very troublesome
[51:17] and wasn't clear you'll see here as we
[51:20] read and he came thither
[51:21] into a cave and lodged there and behold
[51:24] the word of the lord came to him
[51:26] and he said unto him what doest thou
[51:29] hear
[51:29] elijah and he said i have been very
[51:32] jealous for the lord god
[51:33] of hosts for the children of israel have
[51:36] forsaken thy covenant
[51:37] thrown down the altars and slain thy
[51:40] prophets with the sword
[51:42] and i even i only am left
[51:46] and they seek my life to take it away
[51:49] how many times have
[51:50] you felt you're left alone nobody
[51:53] understands
[51:58] it's not the first time that this
[52:00] feeling has been felt
[52:03] we all experience this we all go through
[52:06] times to where we feel alone
[52:10] that gives god a chance and if we learn
[52:13] to look to him
[52:15] we can find the rock if we learn to
[52:18] trust in him
[52:19] there is a rock to stand on
[52:24] and he said go forth and stand upon the
[52:26] mount before the lord so notice where we
[52:28] gotta stand
[52:32] and behold the lord passed by and a
[52:35] great
[52:37] and strong wind rent the mountains
[52:41] it was so strong it break in pieces the
[52:45] rocks
[52:46] before the lord but
[52:49] the lord was not in
[52:52] the wind
[52:59] you know there's things always happening
[53:01] in our life
[53:05] and they're so loud they're so vicious
[53:08] they're so strong we actually see the
[53:10] effects of things happening
[53:12] about us and we're trying to figure it
[53:16] out what does this all mean
[53:21] but maybe we shouldn't be looking to
[53:23] that
[53:27] and after the wind an earthquake
[53:31] but the lord was not in the earthquake i
[53:34] mean you
[53:34] you hear about earthquakes going on the
[53:37] oh this is what the number was on the
[53:39] richter scale and
[53:40] all the news goes out and we're
[53:44] wondering
[53:47] and after the earthquake was a fire
[53:50] but the lord was not in the fire
[53:54] and after the fire a still
[53:57] small voice
[54:01] that's the rock that's the rock
[54:04] that's what we need to be listening for
[54:06] that's where we need to stand amen
[54:10] and it was so when elijah heard it that
[54:12] he wrapped his
[54:14] face in the manner went out and stood in
[54:16] the entering of the cave and behold
[54:17] there came a voice unto him and said
[54:20] what doest thou hear elijah now i want
[54:22] you to understand
[54:24] something it does not matter what
[54:26] anybody else says
[54:30] it doesn't matter what the news says it
[54:32] doesn't matter what's going
[54:34] on out there it doesn't matter the
[54:36] opinions of very smart people
[54:40] it doesn't even matter
[54:43] what the government says
[54:47] doesn't matter what a family member says
[54:51] what matters is that you're willing to
[54:54] be still long enough
[54:56] with all this going around to hear his
[54:58] voice because once you hear it
[55:00] you know where to stand you know where
[55:02] the rock is
[55:04] until that voice comes you're shaken
[55:07] you don't know and god don't want us to
[55:10] figure it out on our own
[55:13] he wants us to trust him
[55:20] one time there was a contest of who
[55:23] could paint the most
[55:25] peaceful scene you've heard the story
[55:30] and there was a a number of beautiful
[55:32] pistol pictures
[55:35] paintings and there was just
[55:38] wonderful sun
[55:42] sunsets over the over the water and
[55:46] over the horizon and with the different
[55:48] uh
[55:49] pastel colors in the sky and uh there
[55:53] was a
[55:53] a a picture of a children a plane
[55:57] just there was no fighting they had
[55:59] smiles on their face they seem to be
[56:02] happy and you know children you know
[56:04] people look at children
[56:05] they just feel sometimes there's a real
[56:08] peace with that
[56:09] there was some with uh a a brook
[56:13] through the wood and there's a deer
[56:16] drinking
[56:17] from the brook and that just looked
[56:19] peaceful
[56:21] just real there was there was one where
[56:24] uh there was this beach and the ocean
[56:26] was there and there was this little
[56:27] beach chair
[56:29] all sitting by itself thinking oh
[56:31] wouldn't it be just so peaceful to be
[56:32] sitting there right there
[56:34] just real peaceful pictures
[56:40] a number of different ones
[56:44] and there happened to be another one
[56:47] that just seemed to be out of place
[56:49] it was a dark stormy painting
[56:53] with rain and streaks of
[56:56] thunder going through around all these
[56:58] rocks
[56:59] and it looks so scary it just it really
[57:01] looked out of place
[57:03] but when you looked real close in the
[57:06] middle of these
[57:07] rocks was a little cleft in the rock
[57:11] and there stood a bird
[57:15] that didn't look scared at all
[57:18] wasn't afraid of the storm
[57:22] he was protected amen
[57:25] he was sheltered
[57:29] and that won the contest and i'll say
[57:31] today
[57:32] when we get in the cleft of the rock
[57:34] when we stand on that rock when we know
[57:37] where to stand by him
[57:40] our place by him when we know where to
[57:42] stand
[57:43] we are not bothered no matter what
[57:45] happens what is said
[57:47] we can stand there and know our god
[57:50] lives
[57:52] look what job went through man he went
[57:55] through so much
[57:56] though the skin worms destroy this flesh
[57:59] i shall still see
[58:00] god amen we all got
[58:03] a a trying time and it's getting worse
[58:07] and
[58:08] worse think about it it's coming so bad
[58:11] on the earth that people are going to
[58:13] want to seek death
[58:18] we it's it's going to get worse
[58:22] that's right i'm not going to tell you
[58:25] that rock moves
[58:27] but every time you got a situation you
[58:29] need to seek the lord
[58:31] where to stand
[58:35] that's the job we have to do stand in
[58:38] that class stand on that rock
[58:40] when problems escalate stand on the rock
[58:44] next to god
[58:48] when there's a surge of turmoil
[58:52] we're supposed to rejoice
[59:00] when everybody forsakes you and you're
[59:02] left alone
[59:03] god's with you what does it matter
[59:08] you're going through things that nobody
[59:10] understands god
[59:11] is there with you he not only
[59:14] understands it
[59:15] he allowed it to happen to you for a
[59:18] purpose
[59:19] beyond the flesh about her character
[59:23] about
[59:23] about becoming his bride he said i'll
[59:27] never
[59:27] leave you i'll never forsake you
[59:31] i'll be with you even to the end
[59:34] so i'll say like this when god shows you
[59:36] something when he speaks to you
[59:41] you need to learn to stand there
[59:44] don't just say oh yeah stand there
[59:48] stand where he tells you
[59:51] stay put on the rock
[59:54] because that rock is there for a reason
[59:56] he spoke that for a reason
[59:58] it's a rock in a weary land
[1:00:02] we're in a weary time
[1:00:05] if you stay on the rock you will remain
[1:00:07] protected
[1:00:09] it's a calm from the storm it's a piece
[1:00:11] in a world full of
[1:00:13] anxiety and fears and the cares of this
[1:00:16] life
[1:00:16] it's it's like a trap coming on the
[1:00:18] world
[1:00:19] yes sir isaiah 26
[1:00:22] 3 says thou will keep him in perfect
[1:00:25] peace
[1:00:27] whose mind is stayed on thee because
[1:00:30] he trusteth in thee that little bird
[1:00:34] didn't have anything to worry about
[1:00:39] he wasn't like whoa what if i was out
[1:00:43] there
[1:00:44] no i'm right here protected
[1:00:51] we need to keep our mind on christ
[1:00:54] don't need to figure out anything amen
[1:00:57] all we got to do is hear his voice
[1:01:02] now the rock is his word revealed
[1:01:06] to you personally
[1:01:11] god told me to stand here on this
[1:01:14] but he didn't speak it to you you don't
[1:01:16] know where to stand yet
[1:01:20] we could read it we could read something
[1:01:23] out of the bible
[1:01:26] uh
[1:01:29] confess your faults one to another pray
[1:01:31] one for another
[1:01:33] but if that's not spoken to you
[1:01:35] personally you're not sure how to
[1:01:36] interpret that
[1:01:41] so the rock is not just well
[1:01:44] it's the bible it's the message it's
[1:01:50] christ
[1:01:53] it's got to be spoken to you personally
[1:01:57] that becomes your rock
[1:02:01] it's god's rock but when he speaks it to
[1:02:04] you
[1:02:05] it now becomes your rock
[1:02:08] he shares the rock with you and nothing
[1:02:12] can move you
[1:02:15] until then you're not sure where i where
[1:02:17] i stand where do i stand lord
[1:02:22] when he speaks to you personally that's
[1:02:25] god showing you
[1:02:27] where to stand where the rock is
[1:02:29] actually at
[1:02:32] my opinion doesn't get the job done
[1:02:37] i can give you three or four different
[1:02:39] ideas what we can try to do to fix this
[1:02:41] problem
[1:02:44] but what we need is the rock we need his
[1:02:47] voice
[1:02:50] and i'll tell you it's around us
[1:02:53] the world fumbling around in darkness
[1:02:56] trying to figure out
[1:02:57] how to survive they don't even
[1:03:00] know who to look to for leadership
[1:03:05] sometimes they want to quote somebody
[1:03:06] and sometimes they don't depend if it
[1:03:08] agrees with them or not
[1:03:12] but god has not left
[1:03:15] his little bride in the dark
[1:03:18] he has given her a rock to stand on
[1:03:23] a light to see and ears to hear
[1:03:26] he is speaking to her his will
[1:03:30] and that has become the rock for her
[1:03:33] amen amen she's standing right there on
[1:03:36] the rock of his word and you know what
[1:03:38] she's obeying it
[1:03:41] because that's it isn't just
[1:03:44] i don't got a rock here iraq isn't just
[1:03:51] knowledge of the bible
[1:03:56] it's he's a person and that
[1:04:00] person individually customizes
[1:04:05] the rocks for you
[1:04:09] because he knows what you're going
[1:04:10] through he knows your situation he knows
[1:04:14] what you're battling
[1:04:16] but when he speaks differently it's
[1:04:19] still the same rock
[1:04:21] customized for you
[1:04:26] but nothing can take that place
[1:04:31] not a person's opinion
[1:04:34] not experience
[1:04:38] what he usually has me do do he may want
[1:04:40] you to go this way
[1:04:45] sometimes he wants me to say maybe he
[1:04:47] wants to not say anything
[1:04:49] we don't know that's why we gotta
[1:04:55] we gotta wait on the lord until he
[1:04:58] speaks to us personally
[1:05:00] in other words it's no longer just
[1:05:02] saying wow i spent some time in prayer
[1:05:03] but i know i need to pray some more
[1:05:05] what we need to do is stay there until
[1:05:07] we hear from god
[1:05:10] it's something that we need to practice
[1:05:11] because all of us could stand
[1:05:13] we for hours could talk about all the
[1:05:15] needs that we have
[1:05:19] so we're not lacking things to talk to
[1:05:22] the lord about we're lacking
[1:05:24] spending time getting serious with the
[1:05:26] lord
[1:05:28] without that voice
[1:05:32] church attendance doesn't do it
[1:05:36] and even jesus said they think
[1:05:39] they're going to be heard for their much
[1:05:42] speaking in their prayers
[1:05:45] so it's about being real with god
[1:05:48] it's about being real with god being
[1:05:50] sincere with god
[1:05:51] being being lord i place myself on the
[1:05:54] altar here today
[1:05:56] when he speaks to you it's now your
[1:05:59] vision it is clear
[1:06:00] as anything there's the rock there's
[1:06:02] where i stand
[1:06:03] and here i'll stand until he tells me to
[1:06:06] move
[1:06:12] his rock has become her rock
[1:06:15] and she shall not be moved hebrews
[1:06:19] chapter 12 verse 28
[1:06:21] hebrews chapter 12 verse 28 wherefore
[1:06:24] we receive a kingdom which cannot be
[1:06:28] moved
[1:06:31] let us have grace
[1:06:37] whereby we may serve god
[1:06:41] acceptably with reverence
[1:06:45] and godly fear
[1:06:52] you would think if we receive the
[1:06:54] kingdom we can do what we want
[1:07:00] but the first thing we need to do is
[1:07:03] have grace
[1:07:05] serve god acceptably and you do that
[1:07:07] with reverence
[1:07:09] and godly fear
[1:07:12] the world is groping in darkness
[1:07:16] not knowing what to do where to go who
[1:07:19] to look to
[1:07:21] but the bride has found the only
[1:07:25] rock that can stand
[1:07:28] everything that this world is going to
[1:07:29] be going through
[1:07:31] and when god speaks to her it becomes
[1:07:35] personally her rock amen
[1:07:39] i'll say it like this stay put when he
[1:07:42] gives it to you
[1:07:45] it's for you and you alone psalms 119
[1:07:49] verse 105 says thy word is a lamp
[1:07:52] unto my feet it is a light onto my path
[1:07:57] when he speaks then you can see
[1:08:00] because that's the word we know this
[1:08:03] word
[1:08:04] is a lamp we know that we know god sent
[1:08:07] a prophet
[1:08:08] to interpret to rightly divinely
[1:08:11] interpret the word we know that but the
[1:08:14] bride
[1:08:16] my sheep hear my voice
[1:08:20] that's the rock for them
[1:08:23] god is not going to come and speak to me
[1:08:25] about your situation
[1:08:30] i don't know why there's so many people
[1:08:32] that want to discuss
[1:08:34] everything that they think about
[1:08:36] somebody in somebody's situation
[1:08:40] i'm not saying god don't do that but i'm
[1:08:43] here to tell you
[1:08:44] god hasn't called me to tell you what to
[1:08:46] do with your
[1:08:51] i situations god keeps that for himself
[1:08:55] he doesn't want to share his glory with
[1:08:57] nobody
[1:08:59] he wants you to get alone with him now i
[1:09:02] know this is children we've all had
[1:09:03] children
[1:09:05] except you
[1:09:12] and you and you
[1:09:18] and player
[1:09:22] but the point that i'm trying to say is
[1:09:24] sometimes you got to tell your children
[1:09:26] this is what you got to do
[1:09:28] they need a little help a little a
[1:09:32] guidance
[1:09:34] but how would you like it if your
[1:09:36] neighbor came all over
[1:09:37] all the time and said this is what i
[1:09:39] think i would have been watching your
[1:09:40] son out my window
[1:09:41] and this is what i think he should be
[1:09:43] doing
[1:09:46] you as a parent would say you know thank
[1:09:48] you but mind your own business
[1:09:51] is that right okay let let god be god
[1:09:56] let god be god let's begin to believe
[1:09:59] we need to pray one for another that god
[1:10:02] would speak
[1:10:03] to each one of us personally lead and
[1:10:05] guide us into all truth
[1:10:07] look he called you here
[1:10:10] he'll take you through he that began a
[1:10:12] good work in you is going to finish it
[1:10:16] we need to put our trust in god
[1:10:20] every other voice can bring confusion
[1:10:25] god's voice is the only voice that
[1:10:27] straightens the thing out
[1:10:29] amen oftentimes we
[1:10:32] really don't know what to do we learn to
[1:10:36] to make the best decisions ourselves
[1:10:38] because we have to go through life and
[1:10:40] we handle natural things the same way we
[1:10:43] try to fix something we don't know how
[1:10:44] to do it we fix it we make it worse we
[1:10:46] we learn how to do it we do it right
[1:10:48] sometimes it costs us more money and
[1:10:50] we learn that's kind of life how life is
[1:10:54] but we ought to be practicing asking god
[1:10:57] more
[1:10:58] what to do amen
[1:11:02] sometimes we're a little bit too wise in
[1:11:04] our own eyes
[1:11:06] we think we already know what to do we
[1:11:07] don't need to listen to google maps
[1:11:13] we don't need to uh read the
[1:11:15] instructions
[1:11:17] we don't need to uh ask uh
[1:11:21] we don't need to pull out the the recipe
[1:11:24] we know it by heart
[1:11:26] or we think we do well we don't we don't
[1:11:29] need to
[1:11:30] you know ask our parents anymore because
[1:11:32] you know we're on our own
[1:11:35] come on
[1:11:40] how about uh we don't need to talk to
[1:11:41] the pastor it's not his job
[1:11:49] proverbs chapter 3 verse 7
[1:11:52] be not wise
[1:11:55] in your own eyes
[1:11:59] fear the lord and depart from evil
[1:12:03] so what is evil what do we what do we
[1:12:05] need to depart from
[1:12:07] evil can be making our own choices
[1:12:11] doing our own will god handle thank you
[1:12:14] don't need you
[1:12:17] that's what evil can be be
[1:12:20] not wise in your own eyes in other words
[1:12:25] don't think you know what to do all the
[1:12:28] time
[1:12:31] proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 trust in
[1:12:34] the lord with all thine heart
[1:12:37] and lean not to thine own understanding
[1:12:40] in all thy ways acknowledge him and
[1:12:42] he shall direct thy path
[1:12:47] we're talking about the rack we're
[1:12:50] talking
[1:12:51] about the rock amen
[1:12:54] we've got to go beyond jesus is the rock
[1:12:58] we've got to get to the place where he's
[1:13:00] leading us what to do in our life
[1:13:07] that's the rock to you personally
[1:13:12] the choice to fear the lord opens the
[1:13:15] door
[1:13:16] to wisdom is that what the bible teaches
[1:13:20] us and godly wisdom
[1:13:24] starts with i could be wrong about this
[1:13:29] as the prophet taught i could be wrong
[1:13:31] to me that's godly wisdom
[1:13:35] that respect to god that you could be
[1:13:37] wrong opens the door
[1:13:38] now for god to give you direction
[1:13:43] but we try to bypass that but this is
[1:13:46] what i
[1:13:47] think and i should be able to handle
[1:13:49] this and this is probably what god wants
[1:13:51] like it doesn't matter what you think
[1:13:53] god probably wants you to do
[1:13:54] do you care enough to to wait on the
[1:13:57] lord and listen to the lord and see if
[1:13:59] he speaks about
[1:14:00] ask him about lord what would you want
[1:14:02] this time
[1:14:08] making the choice to lean not to your
[1:14:11] own
[1:14:11] understanding it opens the door
[1:14:15] to trust it's really hard to trust the
[1:14:17] lord
[1:14:18] if you keep leaning to your own
[1:14:19] understanding
[1:14:22] you've got to make a decision i could be
[1:14:24] wrong
[1:14:25] i'm not going to lean to my own
[1:14:26] understand this situation
[1:14:28] that opens the door to trust amen
[1:14:33] now when you trust the lord with all
[1:14:35] your heart it opens the door
[1:14:37] for a conversation with god amen
[1:14:42] you begin to acknowledge him lord you
[1:14:44] see the situation you know what i'm
[1:14:46] going through
[1:14:46] i need direction from you amen
[1:14:52] that gives a chance for the lord to
[1:14:54] direct your path
[1:14:56] but without it how is he going to do it
[1:14:59] he's not going to use my proud mind
[1:15:01] brother mark
[1:15:04] he's not going to use what i think
[1:15:09] i could be wrong
[1:15:14] i'm not going to lean to that
[1:15:15] understanding
[1:15:17] i'm going to take time to knock on the
[1:15:20] door
[1:15:20] lord what would you have me to do here
[1:15:24] show me i could be wrong
[1:15:29] you've got to talk to the lord first
[1:15:34] he's not going to direct you don't
[1:15:35] expect god to direct your path without
[1:15:37] talking to him
[1:15:39] he wants a relationship amen
[1:15:43] and it all starts at the beginning of
[1:15:46] wisdom
[1:15:46] i could be wrong if any man lack wisdom
[1:15:51] in any situation let him ask of god
[1:15:55] liberally and and god will grant it
[1:15:59] but he's got to ask he's got to start
[1:16:02] the
[1:16:02] conversation with god he's got to say
[1:16:05] lord i don't know what to do here i need
[1:16:07] wisdom i need you to direct me and god
[1:16:10] says okay i'll just give it
[1:16:11] why the mere fact that he's asking in
[1:16:14] faith
[1:16:16] that he's putting his trust in god that
[1:16:19] god was going to give it to him because
[1:16:21] a double-minded man
[1:16:23] is unstable in all his ways
[1:16:32] once god has spoken to you and giving
[1:16:34] you direction
[1:16:36] that is the rock where he wants you to
[1:16:39] stand
[1:16:41] now stand on what he has shown you and
[1:16:44] stay put amen
[1:16:48] this is important if you just you just
[1:16:51] going through all the things that we've
[1:16:52] we've read about can you imagine if that
[1:16:55] bird said okay
[1:16:56] here's the cleft of the rock this is
[1:16:58] where i'm supposed to be and he just
[1:16:59] decides to
[1:17:00] dash out in the storm and sail through
[1:17:02] the storm and
[1:17:03] oh yeah i'm some big bird because i know
[1:17:05] where the cleft is at
[1:17:08] you stay in the cleft until the storm is
[1:17:10] over yes
[1:17:12] that's what the club's for
[1:17:17] we don't want to be blazing some new
[1:17:18] trails
[1:17:23] upon this rock i'll stand and the gates
[1:17:26] of house shall not prevail against it
[1:17:30] when god speaks to you personally this
[1:17:33] is
[1:17:33] what to do this is my will
[1:17:36] for your life
[1:17:42] stand on the rock amen
[1:17:45] everyone's standing somewhere
[1:17:48] everyone stands up everybody's following
[1:17:50] somebody and everybody's standing
[1:17:52] somewhere
[1:17:55] we just need to take inventory of who
[1:17:58] we're following
[1:18:00] and what we're standing on matthew
[1:18:02] chapter 7 verse 24
[1:18:08] therefore whosoever heareth
[1:18:11] these sayings of mine and do with them
[1:18:20] in other words you're standing on the
[1:18:21] rock you're not just
[1:18:24] being a hero of the word but a doer
[1:18:27] i will liken him unto a wise man
[1:18:31] which built his house upon a rock
[1:18:36] and the rains descend the floods came
[1:18:38] the winds blew and beat upon that house
[1:18:40] and it fell
[1:18:41] not for it was founded upon
[1:18:44] a rock a solid
[1:18:48] foundation this is what god wanted i
[1:18:52] i could go back in my life and i could a
[1:18:55] number of things
[1:18:56] hearing the voice of god telling me what
[1:18:58] to do
[1:19:01] i do not expect god to tell you
[1:19:04] what i need to do
[1:19:08] and do not expect me to tell you what
[1:19:11] god wants you to do
[1:19:15] but i hope you have faith in the office
[1:19:17] that god has put for your leadership
[1:19:19] [Music]
[1:19:21] because if you have it right god will be
[1:19:23] speaking to you
[1:19:24] from this place
[1:19:25] [Music]
[1:19:30] and everyone that heareth these sayings
[1:19:33] of mine
[1:19:35] and doeth them not just add one more
[1:19:38] word
[1:19:40] shall be likened unto a very very very
[1:19:43] very very foolish man
[1:19:46] which built his house upon
[1:19:49] the sand now did you
[1:19:53] know that sand are just little pieces of
[1:19:56] rock
[1:19:59] same material but they're just little
[1:20:02] pieces
[1:20:08] think about that just little pieces
[1:20:11] take a little here a little this little
[1:20:13] that a little this
[1:20:16] but just not solid
[1:20:21] i don't think i really need to do
[1:20:23] exactly what god's telling me to do
[1:20:29] i mean for the most part i do but you
[1:20:32] know
[1:20:32] i don't need to
[1:20:36] let's see what happens well the rains
[1:20:39] descended the floods came the winds blew
[1:20:41] and beat upon the house
[1:20:42] and it fell it didn't fall a little
[1:20:46] the bible says and great was the fall of
[1:20:50] it
[1:20:54] in other words there is no comfort in
[1:20:56] just taking
[1:20:57] little bits and pieces of the bible
[1:21:01] and say this is what i believe you've
[1:21:04] got to take
[1:21:06] from cover to cover word upon word line
[1:21:09] upon line
[1:21:10] you need it all we need it all
[1:21:14] the rock becomes our comfort it becomes
[1:21:17] our shelter
[1:21:17] it becomes our refuge it becomes the
[1:21:20] direction for our life
[1:21:21] it becomes our peace
[1:21:24] there's no peace outside of christ
[1:21:29] the benefits of trusting in the rock
[1:21:35] isaiah 26 verse 3 isaiah 26
[1:21:38] 3 the benefits of trusting in iraq thou
[1:21:42] will keep him in perfect peace whose
[1:21:45] mind
[1:21:45] is stayed on me why because he trusteth
[1:21:49] in thee the benefits of trusting
[1:21:54] you know it's hard to do
[1:21:57] i remember all of my children
[1:22:01] driving for the
[1:22:04] first times in the vehicle with them
[1:22:09] i was so used to getting the back seat
[1:22:11] buckle up i'm driving
[1:22:13] and now they reach that age where you
[1:22:16] got to sit in the side seat over here
[1:22:18] and hand them the steering wheel
[1:22:21] and then you got to trust
[1:22:29] trusting the lord is hard
[1:22:32] but he's he's not a baby
[1:22:37] it isn't like he's learning to guide
[1:22:40] your life
[1:22:41] he already knows how to guide your life
[1:22:49] the reason it's hard to trust the lord
[1:22:50] is because we're so full of trust in
[1:22:52] herself
[1:22:56] he does a much better job if i look back
[1:22:59] i just say this with all my heart
[1:23:01] i'd make some major changes in my life i
[1:23:04] would have made some different decisions
[1:23:06] think about that
[1:23:10] the devil's still the devil he still
[1:23:13] tries to trick us deceive us
[1:23:16] we have a rock
[1:23:22] but the word that he speaks to us is
[1:23:25] so real it is a solid foundation for our
[1:23:30] life
[1:23:30] it's not about now how we feel it's
[1:23:32] about our future
[1:23:34] that's the reason that we got to stand
[1:23:37] on what he told us to do
[1:23:38] amen if we don't
[1:23:42] anything else is going to sink and
[1:23:44] eventually whatever we're building
[1:23:46] is going to deteriorate and come down
[1:23:49] are you with me
[1:23:50] proverbs chapter 16 verse 20
[1:23:55] he that handleth a matter
[1:23:59] wisely shall find good and who so
[1:24:02] trusteth in the lord happy
[1:24:07] happy how many wants happiness
[1:24:13] trust the lord
[1:24:16] when you can really give it over to him
[1:24:23] happiness comes
[1:24:28] you may not know exactly what's going to
[1:24:30] happen but you know it's going to be
[1:24:32] good
[1:24:33] it's like our brother was saying in our
[1:24:34] men's meeting everything that god did at
[1:24:36] the beginning he said
[1:24:38] it is good everything he created it is
[1:24:40] good
[1:24:41] so whatever you committed to god's hands
[1:24:43] it's going to be good
[1:24:46] and whatever you try to get involved
[1:24:48] with it'll turn up not as good
[1:24:50] maybe even bad amen
[1:24:56] having a rock is something worth
[1:24:59] praising god for
[1:25:07] we need to thank the lord for the rock
[1:25:09] psalm 62 verse 6
[1:25:12] he only is my rock psalm 62 6
[1:25:15] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[1:25:18] is my defense
[1:25:23] you don't need to defend yourself he is
[1:25:26] your defense
[1:25:27] i shall not be moved
[1:25:30] because you're on the rock in god
[1:25:35] is my salvation my glory
[1:25:38] the rock of my strength
[1:25:42] strength as a rock my
[1:25:45] and my refuge is in god
[1:25:50] amen i am scared
[1:25:54] honestly i'll be honest with you i am
[1:25:56] totally scared
[1:25:57] of making my decisions
[1:26:06] but when he makes it
[1:26:09] that's my refuge that's my rock
[1:26:15] the gates of hell it doesn't matter what
[1:26:18] happens
[1:26:21] because he's made the decision he showed
[1:26:23] me where the rock is and i just okay
[1:26:25] this is where i stand this is what i
[1:26:26] believe this is
[1:26:27] right here why because this is the light
[1:26:30] he showed to me
[1:26:31] when he spoke to my heart about the
[1:26:33] situation and he says stand here
[1:26:43] in time we'll see
[1:26:48] amen trust in
[1:26:52] him at all times not just
[1:26:55] when it's easy not just when it's
[1:26:58] obvious
[1:27:00] trust in him at all times she people
[1:27:02] pour out
[1:27:03] your heart before him amen
[1:27:08] god is a refuge for us i just don't know
[1:27:12] how
[1:27:13] god you expect god to ever ever guide
[1:27:16] you
[1:27:17] to show you if you don't bring before
[1:27:20] him
[1:27:21] your heart he wants a conversation with
[1:27:25] us
[1:27:26] amen
[1:27:31] when david's son died
[1:27:35] he didn't rejoice over the fact that he
[1:27:38] died
[1:27:41] and in fact i can imagine david felt
[1:27:43] very bad
[1:27:44] that he died because it was for david's
[1:27:48] sin
[1:27:50] and he felt responsible that the death
[1:27:51] of his own son was because of him so i
[1:27:54] imagine
[1:27:54] that he felt bad so he didn't rejoice
[1:27:57] over the fact that he died
[1:28:00] but david rejoiced because he had a rock
[1:28:03] to stand on he knew one day
[1:28:06] i would see him i would go to him he
[1:28:09] rejoiced because
[1:28:10] death wasn't going to separate him
[1:28:14] nothing is going to separate us from the
[1:28:16] love of god
[1:28:18] nothing romans chapter 8 verse 38 for i
[1:28:21] am persuaded that neither death
[1:28:23] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:28:27] or powers
[1:28:28] nor things present or things to come
[1:28:31] nor height nor death nor
[1:28:34] any other creature shall be able to
[1:28:38] separate us
[1:28:39] from the love of god you talk about a
[1:28:42] rock
[1:28:43] you talk about a clef which is in christ
[1:28:47] jesus
[1:28:48] our lord david had a rock
[1:28:52] it was invisible
[1:28:56] he knew what to do for his situation
[1:29:02] it didn't matter if he fell he knew what
[1:29:05] to do
[1:29:10] it's important for us to know
[1:29:13] what he wants us to do in our situation
[1:29:17] it's not good enough to come to church
[1:29:20] and say
[1:29:21] well i came to church i heard the word
[1:29:26] if you don't take it home personally if
[1:29:28] you don't hear personally from god what
[1:29:30] he wants you to do
[1:29:32] i'm going to ask you what is the rock
[1:29:36] what is the rock to you

[1:37:59] one time in my life where i didn't even
[1:38:03] know there was
[1:38:04] a rock that existed
[1:38:08] i didn't know that that there was a
[1:38:11] truth

[1:38:17] know
[1:38:17] what that truth was
[1:38:21] and lord we thank you from the bottom of
[1:38:24] our hearts
