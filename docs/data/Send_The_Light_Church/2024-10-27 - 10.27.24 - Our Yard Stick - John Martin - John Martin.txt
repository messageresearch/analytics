Ephesians we'll have two um um two scripture readings the first is going to be in Ephesians 2 and the other is going to be in St John Chapter 13 How many has been trying to put in practice cashing in with your attitude since Wednesday amen one two praise God you know it it it's amazing what just a little bit of effort will actually start producing CU everything's like a habit right your mind is like a habit amen Ephesians chapter 2 now I better get to the scriptures here amen let's look to the Lord in prayer and then we'll read these his word amen our heavenly father Lord we thank you that you've given us the health and strength to be here Lord we think of those that are are are are are less fortunate Lord we pray that you'd be with Brother Bruce and sister Donna Lord that you'd be with brother Johnson sister Johnson Lord with each one Lord that we don't even know we just ask that you'd be their their strength and their healing father Lord we thank you that you've given us as brother Ron had said this desire to be here and that we could just come and worship you with brothers and sisters of light precious faith and Lord we just ask ask you to take a full control full preeminence of the of of of our hearts at this time and the remainder of the service as your word comes forth Lord help our our mind and our spirit uh just to be United with your word today as you speak Lord though they may be coming from these lips of clay we just ask that you would take them now and and anoint them to speak only those things that you'd have to be spoken and may all of us just be drawn closer to the love of God today where we commit the service each of our hearts into your hands now give you the praise in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Ephesians chapter 2 starting with verse number one through six and you have he quickened who were dead and trespasses and sins were in times past were in in time past you walked according to the course of this world we all remember that right according to the prince of the power of the it's actually the spirit that now is working in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of our flesh and of and of the mind and whereby just nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins and have quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved and have raised us up together uh and it's raised us up together and made us to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus just notice before we go to St John notice now here in the scriptures he he gives us a a real good picture of where we all were in the past and then it was love that changed us it was his love we didn't have nothing to do with it it it was his love that changed us and that it it it it it something happened to us the scripture says it quickens something happened to us that we could not control it quickens and that quickening caused us to sit together with a new nature and and and and to to be raised higher than where we used to live amen amen St John Chapter 13 St John chapter 13 Jesus speaking of this love here in verse 34 35 St John 1334 and 35 a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another another with that same love that I've loved you with and by this shall all men know you're different that you're my disciples if ye have love one for one to another amen amen God bless you you may be seated amen we want to entitle this message our yard stick kind of a different type our subject is really the love of God manifested what we want to talk about and before we get into this I just want to say thank you for thank you for the cakes the cookies and the things that you made for us for pastor appreciation uh day or month I mean you can keep doing it even if you missed it you can keep doing it for the next month I'm just kidding but thank you so much and it's uh really hard to stay inbalanced with all these things um but we just had to keep eating it before it went bad right I wanted to say thank you it's it's well recognized and may God bless you for your love amen amen here in this scripture God is saying this is how I will be identified by this is the only identification of a disciple of Jesus Christ this is the yard stick that people are truly going to know where you stand with God Bible says we are written Epistles read and known of all men so we really can't hide the love of God you can't say you have it nobody knows about it you just can't do it there's something about the love of God that people know they know it's not human love anymore that's right because it has sacrifices that that human love just doesn't do it's a universal communication that has no language barriers it doesn't matter how much civilization has changed from the time that Jesus walked uh on the road with just sandals without any luxuries to the time that we have now we have cell phones we have TVs computers games Rockets trains cars fast food automation washer and dryer microwaves we have all that stuff now but you know God's love and his communication with love has not changed it's always remained the same throughout every age you could know exactly that someone was a disciple of Jesus Christ simply by the love that they loved with it was the same exact love that God loved them with and it it's a love that you can actually love somebody when they're dead in sins and trespasses and keep loving them to a nature change are you with me and I'll just say if you want to get into this message you'll get blessed more out you'll get more out of it I'll tell you that my my goal and my desire is to help it's all it's it's really people change civilization change times change but God's love it never changes that's and it never will change first John 4 tells us that God is love and people will know that we're his disciples by manifesting that same love and we're going to if we could have I'd like to ask brother James if he'd pass out some yard sticks we're gonna we're going to just I want us to have like a something to take home with us something to kind of remember this this Service uh we're going to kind of measure our our life as a disciple with the love of God today and uh I hope that's okay is that okay I I don't think anybody's going to be hurt or offended do you amen amen so uh if there's enough every everyone should can get one except the youth you're going to have to bow the the adults but I will say this this is actually is just as much for you as for the adults today this love of God that he has for us he had not just for the adults but he had it for us I remember as a child how many can remember God speaking to you when you were a child sometime amen God speaking to you so God is here now first of all we want to make sure that we're using the right stick when we're measuring in other words we don't want to be using the wrong stick these are just some different measuring sticks that we can measure with but if you notice that these cannot measure what those yard sticks can measure this is limited I can only measure a little bit but those sticks you have there can measure a great deal more so we don't want to be using the wrong stick we want to use the the correct one because if we use the wrong one we're going to get a a a a f a false calculation or indications or or misguidance or or and end up with a false sense of security because I've got what I feel I got the love of God now we all feel we have the love of God right in our hearts how many can say amen I have the love of God and and for you that don't want to participate I'm going to ask you to stand up now we've all been touched by the love of God because God you know he's so good that his love just pours out even to the enemies so we've all experienced the love of God but this here is God is wanting to be identified in our lives by love and nothing else not by what we know but what we manifest so let's measure our love have you ever experienced being treated bad by someone who had a bad attitude yeah good I love I love I love people entering in love that absolutely we all have this unfair treatment can grind on us and it can actually make us want to lash back right on the other hand being treated amazingly by someone who might have happened to be in a good mood this kind of treatment usually lifts us up and causes us to repay them with a kind gesture you ever you ever done that now most people reflect back to others what is projected to them come on say amen and this is the love that most people operate and it's called FAL love it's human love it's it's Foundation is selfish it's a selfish nature that's the that's the root of it and so most people love others based on how they are loved and that's what I think that about these little measuring things when we're trying trying to measure whether we got God's love inside of us how we treat people it's it's you know these things are like respector persons and I'll be nice to you if you're nice to me but that's not God's love if someone is always friendly or kind towards them then most likely they'll be friendly back but if someone is usually rude or forward towards them then they won't most likely be friendly back to them amen it's just just being honest if you give an extremely good tip to a waitress usually you're going to get a greater expression of gratitude than if you give them a poor tip you ever give somebody a tip and they just kind of like this it they don't say it but that's the expression they give you know what I'm talking about and then you have to go back you have to recalculate how many what percent was that if a person usually doesn't like to return things that they borrow and they want to borrow something from someone well they're going to do what they can to avoid lending that to that person is that true these are just a few examples of how our our selfish love it's love but how it works it's still love but it's under the nature of selfishness it works under the law of condition it's a conditional love I will consider loving you if you love me but you don't then don't expect me to love you back if you're going to treat me like that then I'm G right so we this is fial love it it's a conditional love it has limits it it it can only exercise in a unlimited capacity because of that we can conclude that this love is shallow there's no depth to it it's limited it's seasonal it's temporal it starts and it stops all the time you can't even depend on it its boundaries are never defined because it's it changes with moods and emotions this love is 100% selfish in fact this love will manipulate others to get what it wants this love will actually hurt others to get what it selfishly wants but yet it's still love but it's not God's love that's right human love is selfish which makes it limited and conditional therefore we cannot measure our discipleship to Christ based upon our human love what we kind gestures that we do for others where we bend over backwards and help somebody sometime and say well you know I'm just being you know a Christian there are people who do not believe in God that do nice things for people because inside of human love there is the ability to have somebody go through the door first or open the door or you know I'm telling you I don't know how many times people have paid for my coffee or my food at a fast food place and they say well that guy in front of you who he paid for you you ever go through the Across The Mao bridge and everybody that goes through they got paid for because they're paying for the guy behind so I'm just saying we can't measure the love of God based on nice things that we do for people you know the Bible says that Christ did not even want his own disciples to try and go witness until they were indued with power from on high think about that his own disciples he would not let them go and witness until they received a power and that power is the power of of love we know it as the Holy Ghost but it is the power of love because notice their Spirit would just quit as soon as they got persecuted right soon as the problem start they would quit well this is it for me I'm going to go find another church but when they got filled with the Holy Ghost see it didn't matter what the persecution happened they had power they had so much love that they could stand there get persecuted for the name of Jesus Christ that is the love of God the power of the Holy Ghost is the love of God it's agape love it's a unconditional love Jesus said in Acts 1 18 but you shall receive power you shall receive the power after that the Holy Ghost which is agape love the love of God is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and Judea and in Samaria and the uttermost parts of the earth you're equipped now to show others that you're my disciple when you have the life of God in you how can you have the Holy Ghost and not the love of God they're they're the same now we know you can have the word and not have the spirit because the devil has the word he he knows the word more than all of us combined he is so good he can take that word and confuse our minds if we if we let the wrong Spirit around us too long but you know what he he doesn't have the life because he'd have to fall in love with Jesus he doesn't love Jesus he hates Jesus he's selfish remember when Jesus was talking about the power he had class that was a question by the way it was a question I got a question mark the power he was speaking about was really the power of agapy love amen it can constrain a man to literally lay down his life for others that's right it'll cause him to to even leave his occupation just like the the the the the the Peter and James they just they left their occupation it can make you leave your dreams your Ambitions this power is so great that it can change the very nature into God's Own nature calls us to clean up our lives there's no power like the power of God the power and that helps us gives us strength to lay down our own life in the message God's commission commissioning Moses brother bam says and one of the doctors said well I tell you I find this that the greatest power in the world is not the atomic bomb but a Believer with a believer in contact with his maker so a Believer that's not in contact with his maker is no power that's why we're told walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh because you're in contact brother Brandon says it changes the whole attitude it changes his mental it changes his habit it changes his body it changes his nature everything when we come in contact with the maker and this is why it's important when we're in church it's not good enough you know just to come to church oh my my just to come to church to say we went to church we need to learn quickly that doesn't accomplish anything we need to be prepared to come in contact with God Amen because that's the only time things are going to change in our life Jesus speaking of the power said in John 1018 he says no man takes my life from me but I lay it down of myself he said I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again this commandment have I received of my father and I you know Jesus gave us the same commandment he gave us the same commandment I just wonder how many people sit in church but they never receive it from God they never received the Commandment from God you cannot you you absolutely cannot lay down your life with your love it will not lay down its life unconditionally it doesn't have that kind of power but when you love God God sees that love he gives you strength it's a reciprocating effect that goes back and forth and it grows and it grows and it gets stronger and stronger and before you know it you love God so much you'll just do whatever he ask you to do that's the love of God you don't just you know come to church one time become a Christian say oh I got the love of God I'm going to try to practice it don't work like that it's an ongoing process that you build on a daily basis that's who God wants to spend eternity with John 10:17 therefore doth my father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it again we know God loves unconditionally but I think he has a special love just for his bride he reserves it just for those who give their all back to God what a privilege that we have in Christ to share a love that God has only reserved for his bride think about that we know that God for God so loved the world that he gave but to think that he is reserved a love just for his bride unfortunately we see too many people trying to witness with only a conditional love a love that's not willing to lay down their lives a love that will not give its all just give a little bit try to see a nature change brother brand said the message hear ye him and when the Great trials are going on God wants children who will display his love it's easy to do something for somebody when it's convenient when you've got money when you've got time when you can maybe you get something out of it but when the Trials come well we're too busy thinking about self but that's the time that God wants children who will display his love love that quote no wonder John said in 1 John 3:16 hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our life for one another we ought to that's the expectation that's what Jesus said so perceive we are we going to perceive the love of God with this or we're going to use the word amen the true love of God inside of us will lay down our lives for other people's nature change amen it's one thing to help somebody build a deck to fix a car to bake a cake and those are all good things they're nice and I'm telling you people who don't know God do those things but when you are willing to work with somebody with the purpose and your focus and your whole mind your whole thoughts everything is on them getting a nature change well then you're willing to do what you got to do to get that done but understand God is not interested in how much money trusted to makes just like it's not interested in numbers how big a church is but it is interested in one Soul being changed in fact all Heaven rejoices all the angels are rejoicing there's something going on when just one person repents and says God I want to be I want it to come back to the way it used to be I love that song a new commandment I give you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another and by this shall all men know that you're my disciples I just think about the last time that you really knew that you laid down your life and you stayed there you stayed there with the purpose of changing somebody's nature think about that that's the that's the other brother Ron I got to borrow your yard stick here this is this is the yard stick that God wants us to measure with because his Love Changes nature our love is limited it starts and it stops all the time but God's love just keeps going and that's why no matter how much we've got away from God like Jonah if we just turn our heart towards the Lord his love is faithful he will will receive us and we can begin to build again that's what that Psalm was all about that we heard today it starts with that desire Lord I want it to be like it was before I want to be fresh we got some scriptures on thaten Amen turn with me if you would to First John chapter 4 these are not those scriptures but they're coming we're born again by God's Own nature and when we're born again by God's nature you know what happened our nature automatically starts to be like his it automatically happens you know brother BR talked about if you if you get baptized as a sinner which we all get baptized as a sinner but I mean if you go down without a True Heart of I'm going to give you my life he says you'll just come up a wet sinner and uh there's many people that just come to church because they feel obligated to be part of a church but they're not even focusing on the change of why they're going to church but when you become born again something happens to the nature and we're supernaturally transformed by the love of God into his divine nature 1 John 4:7 says beloved let us love one another for love is of God and one thing I wanted to say and I'm sorry for interrupting my own self have you ever interrupted your own self the reason I got this is because I I really want to point out 36 things that the love of God will do that human love won't do and we'll probably have more of them we go through more than 36 but I'm not going to take time to like analyze which ones they are but I'll I'll bring out a few beloved let us not let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth the way that God loves is born of God and knoweth God so we just got to love the way he does and he that loveth not the way that God loves knoweth not God for God is love and we know this in John 3:16 in this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God Sent His only begotten son into the world that we might live through him now here in is love not that we loved God but that he loved us and he sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another now we know not everybody's going to fulfill that that scripture right there but God did love the whole worlden but the whole world is not going to love one another praise God praise God we're Believers amen if we're truly born again we will love the way that God loves we will lay down our lives to see other people's nature changed into God's nature that's what it really means to lay down your life I want us to get a a real good glimpse of what it means to lay down your life you know some people go through the course of the day and they're not even thinking about a soul they're not thinking about seeing a soul changed so let me just say this how in the world can we lay down our life for somebody when we're not even thinking about a nature change see you see all the denominations they take the scripture and they say well we just need to do kind things one to another be nice to one another and you know just kind of show that you know by being nice that that God's with you and hopefully you know you'll be able to like invite him to church and and I'm I'm All understand that but laying down your life is giving yourself your time your money your mind all that God has placed your life into his hands that you can help somebody get saved and that if they are saved that you can bring them to the next level to become more like Christ to deal with them with their habits that are just so ungodly and say look God has called us to this pray with them spend time with them this is what it means to lay down her life it doesn't mean anything else don't let it mean anything else to you and that's a Vindication right there so let's let's take a look at God's yard stick agape love the unconditional love for other people's soul brother Brandon said eternal life was living for others I think about that when we when we're when we think about eternal life brother understand will there be any paint brushes will there be any tile will there be any drywall will there be any Machinery will there be any bolts will there be any guns when we think of eternal life we don't think of those natural things right so when we think about living for others don't be thinking Natural Things think about the invisible thing the spiritual thing which is the nature of every human being amen because that's unless it's converted Jesus said unless you're born again you're not going so our interest needs to be in seeing other people saved amen a new commandment I give you that you love one another as I have loved you so God wants us to use his yard stick and not ours the greatest characteristic of God's love is giving is the giving of oneself to see someone else's nature change to me that is the greatest characteristic of God's love because for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so whether it's your life your time your resources everything is with the purpose that I want to see this person's nature change because that's the bird that God has on that for that person you know we may be thinking of a way that we can get Advantage you know with this person but God is interested in trying to get their nature changed am amen amen Jesus said in John 15:12 and 13 John 15:12 said this is my commandment that you love one another as I loved you we need to practice that to really really practice that Greater Love have no man than this here's God defining the greatest love that a man can have Greater Love have no man than this than a man laay down his life for his friends now Jesus did this for us but he's also telling us that we can do this too if God's love is inside of us then we can do what Jesus did amen God's love is really a love for others it's not a selfish love it's for others and he's given us so much opportunity Matthew chapter 5 you know here in Matthew Chapter 5 we're going to read about 12 in just in this little this little part we're going to try to measure up our life with God's yard stick here Matthew 5:38 ye have heard that had been said and ey for an eye in a two for a two but I say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on their right cheek turn to him the other also that's that's that's inch one so what what it means to somebody hits you on the cheek is they literally said something mean to you they disrespected you they did something bad to you and the love of God says I'm not going to pay attention to that I'm just going to turn the other cheek and that's how a a disciple of Christ is measured and if any man will sue you at the law and take away your coat let him have thy cloak also wow so somebody wants to do you harm take you to court well don't just give them what they're taking from you give them more give them more wow brother John this is not a 21st century uh gospel [Laughter] but you know what the word never changes the nature of God never changes and if any man oh okay that's verse 40 in verse 41 and whosoever shall compel you to go a mile go to amen go somebody ask you to do can you come over and help me Rake some leaves yeah I'll come over and help you make rake some leaves and you want me to help with the wood and uh let me go ahead and let me just do this for you and and wash your windows and and let me do this for you now that's just scripture Saints that's just scripture and so you're you're measuring see a human love will do that sometimes but God's love will do this God's love will do this the around we're going to share this okay if you want to grab it you can verse 42 give to him that ask thee and from him that would borrow of of thee turn uh turn not thou away and there's I don't have the scripture right here but you can read in the in Jesus talking about is you want to give to people who are not going to give back to you you know you you still give it to them I mean I I got people that I've given stuff to that I've never and I got quite a few of them that never got back am and if you're a Christian you will and they that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer that type of all kinds of persecution not honestly so this is what this is what it means to have the love of God in your heart now ye have heard that have been said verse 43 that thou shalt love thy neighbor and be against the one that is your enemy but I say unto you love your enemy bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you now there's five of them right in that verse five inches right in that verse so we're at nine already that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he makes the sun to rise on the evil and the good and he sends the rain on the just and the UN there's two more that's what the love of God will do now most people probably want to go to church and hear about how God loves them but we also believe in going to church and making sure that we're doing what God wants us to do which is love others amen for if you love them which love you where's your reward do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brother only you God bless you I love you and greetings what do you more than others do not even the Publican soul see in other words don't use the stick that everybody else uses the publicans chuse this they they'll greet you yeah if you're a friend you want to you know hang out have a good time I'll do that with you yeah I can connect that's the stick they use but God stick is I'm going to love I'm going to give I'm going to salute I'm going to give my very best knowing that the person is going to not use me knowing the person is going to use me I'll tell you one of the hardest things to do is know that you're being used it is one of the hardest things to do because you're faced with the word now nobody wants to be used but the word just told me I'm going to be used right and I can try to be a Christian without being used but then I ain't really a Christian I'm really not Christlike and I really can't be identified as a disciple of Christ amen because I'm not loving like Christ loved for verse 48 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect there's number 12 use God's love to determine where your love is at amen all right just going to touch on forgiveness if a man trespasses against you seven times in a day seven times in a day the love of God will forgive him is that true that's right and if he goes on for 70 days that's over two months the love of God will still forgive him is that true seven time 7 that's what Jesus said now this is this to me this is such an eye opener brother on that I mean I expect God to forgive me every time I go on my knees I I forgive him to be faith I mean I forgive him excuse me I I count on him to be faithful he's known to be faithful that if I confess my sins he's faithful and just to forgive me of my unrighteousness but can I be that way towards others because if I can to the degree that God has said which is to me endless because the love of God Bears all things endures all things it just doesn't stop it is it is endless it is unconditional that's what I want you want that today amen say amen God I want this word did you know love the love of God will actually correct and did you know the love of humans will actually correct boys you know what I've told you before you do that again you made me so mad you made me look bad in front of that person human love will correct but it's all with a selfish motive now I'm not saying that we as a we as parents only have selfish that's not what I'm saying because I trust the love of God in parents to be using the love of God to correct but I'm just trying to bring a point human love corrects and usually it it's it's without love right that's the Bible says speak the truth in love because you can speak the truth and hurt somebody but speak it in love can you say Amen to the word I the more you say Amen the less it hurts right Revelation 3:19 as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zelous therefore and repent in other words there's a direction to go when God speaks to you right you want to go in that direction you don't want to resist it John 163 says how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth verse 8 says and when he comes he will reprove that means convict tell a fa or rebuke the worldly nature that's inside of you the very fact that that the holy spirit is inside when you let the holy you how many times have you kind of like didn't want to go to church because you knew you were going to get you know convicted you didn't want to go and be convicted you know what I'm saying well I don't want to talk to them right now because they'll probably just say something about God you've talked to people that don't want to talk to you because you know you're going to bring up Christ you understand what I'm talking about and see that that is what the Holy Ghost doesn't want to sit around and make friends I'm sorry it's not interested in having a big campaign he's not a politician he wants to see Souls changed Nature's changed so there is a motive that God has and when we come together and have family devotions and pray and read the Bible we should be looking for a change to take place that's why we do it we need to do it the Bram said in the message why he says and if we can't love one another how are we going to love God who we haven't seen we must find the thing we've got to love one another though we differ you got to love anyhow you can't Bluff it you got to be you got to really do it the greatest power I have found in healing how many wants healing the greatest power I found in healing is love and when you have sympathy and love for the people trying to help them sometimes I scold them and I go back home and just think this is Brother Bram talking now he says Lord what did I what did I do that for question mark well I could relate to that one I don't know how many times I thought why why did I do that but it's because I love them brother Ren said if I have to scold my little boy for running out into the street if I he says if I have to scold my little boy for running out in the street he will get killed if I don't get him off the street sometimes I have to whip them correct them and say son stay off the street not because I don't love that child it's because I do love that child right and that's the way that God has to do with us he scolds us he shakes us and he has to make it real a person that lets his child just do anything is not good uh a person that just lets his child do anything is not a good parent that's right there's too much of that in America today yes sir we need the oldfashioned mothers praise the Lord so glad this word has been preserved for us Look what Jesus said in Revelations 2:4 if we can put that up Revelations 2:4 for nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love so I when brother Gordy was singing this song I couldn't help but to think about this the scripture that I already had in my notes and and how many how many feels that you've gotten away from the love of Goden before amen amen you know the feeling and and I'll say it like this have you ever been so close to God that you would just do anything have you ever been so close to God that you just do almost everything have you been so close to God that you just do maybe half have you been so close to God that just you a part your quarter have you been so close to God that you didn't want to go to church right you know what I'm talking about and the and the thing is we ought to be on fire the love of God should cause us I can't wait till the doors are open I can't wait to get in there I can't wait to get close to God and if you're feeling that way I'm just going to tell you the Holy Ghost has preeminence in your life and if you're not feeling that I think God came and ministered to us through a song today and all we need to do is just hunger God draw me back to that place so here Jesus nevertheless I have so much to say against thee because thou has left thy First Love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come quickly and remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent I thank God for Grace you know what Grace is Grace is a time to make things right amen and I'm so thankful for God's grace but but we know one day it's going to be all over people will still be coming to the altar thinking they're getting saved and they're not because they let their time slip away we've got to recognize the time of our visitation when we come to church it is if our heart isn't I want to enter into you Lord you know it's just not going to you got to have a heart that I want more more of you today Lord than I've ever had before in the message hear ye him brother Brandon says come with come come with it with love the world is dying today for love Christians today we've got fine scly churches wonderful buildings but we got weak pulpits he said there's something wrong the congregation don't feel to one another like they used to preach it brother brandham he said there's something missing the world is looking to that Christians what we need today is the baptism of Love on one another and he said this will all men know you are my disciples when you have love one for another and no man have greater love than this than a man lay down his life for his friends here ye him appreciate that quote we're living in perilous times church people are literally in love with themselves and in love with Pleasures more than they are with God so how how how can we get more of God when we just I'll give you some God but I really want this Jesus said in the last days because iniquity in our lives iniquity in our minds iniquity in our hearts because it would abound the love of many would wax cold where I don't even feel like trying and and and loving put my arm and and and being affectionate and and telling somebody hey I've been praying for you I care about you what can I do to help you why is that missing because iniquity iniquity Jesus told us why we don't we don't we don't need to go any further than the word the word tells us right but yet at the same time that this is happening and and the people are Falling Away there's a a caps Stone that's coming down on the Bride of Jesus Christ and that Capstone is perfect love it's what we've been talking about it's why we're measuring today because it's a paradox why the world is is is is an apostasy and is going away from the love of God there is a small a very tiny little group of people who love God with their heart and they're calling on God God fill me with your love that I can that that I could be your wife because God wants to marry someone that loves him as much as he loves them that's what's happening right now it's a paradox the rest of the church don't even recognize it they're just they're satisfied with going to church satisfied with being in the message brother bam said the mess is the statue of a perfect man he says then they're waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love in the message god making his promise we need Christians like that who will display Jesus Christ that's right the love of God in our hearts that's what we need the Manifest the display I tell you if there's something that warms my heart is when I feel somebody loves in me but somebody just telling me the word just telling me something I don't always feel it and not that we go by feelings but you know brother brandom says you can't fake it you can't Bluff it you've all seen those pictures where they got that fake fire going you walk in and this thing's going like this and it's Amber lights and they're moving you go up there and you don't feel a thing it's not real right but there's something about the love of God when it's being projected towards you you know it you know it God is calling us to manifest love not just well I think the church should be doing this and brother Gordy you should have played my favorite song today you know I asked you to do it and you sister Genie you you know I've been you know what kind of cookies I like no it's not about what everybody else should be manifesting it's about what you should be manifesting it's not what should the what can the church do for me is what you can do to to be a part of the church to help the church church I love the word 1 John 3: 1 says and we need to hurry because time has gotten way too far too far too far 1 John chapter 3:1 be behold what manner of love the father have bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God it does not yet appear what we shall be but but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is so we're going to be we're going to be bestowing love upon others the same manner of love the father has bestowed upon us we're going to be bestowing upon others that's how we're going to be like him it's it's not going to be I I believe God I know God in the message is a manifestation of that love towards others and every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure amen how many has that hope this morning that you're going to you're going to be like Christ and I'll tell you if you do have that hope if it's a hope inside of you I know today that you're working with a a desire to make yourself better to purify yourself if that if that hope is there you you just are you're just you are ra said the message Blasphemous names he says first foundationally is Faith second add to your faith virtue to Virtue Knowledge from knowledge Temperance from Temperance patience patience godliness and from godliness Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and and then love being the Capstone now seven of those seven of those things seven Church AG see seven stars seven Church ages all of it tempered together by the Holy Spirit now that's what it takes to become a servant of Christ I read that and I just about fell over it takes that to be a servant of Christ don't just try to take one don't try to be a servant without it you know we got so many self-proclaimed servants right but the prophet said it takes this to be a servant of Christ Christ builds his church in seven Church ages his bride a person a woman a church seven Church ages constitute and makes the bride and some of this age and some out of that age some out of another age and all together and shaping it like a pyramid I believe the bride of Christ is the absolute best servant on the planet now she is she will be she is the only one that will be fit to ruin Reign she'll have the character but you know she just followed her her husband Jesus right who who made himself of no reputation laid down his life became obedient took on the the the the form of a servant of a man and he he just served and the and the bride that same Spirit comes upon the bride and it's been building there's more expected in this age than there was the first church age and she will manifest what it means to be a true servant and God says that's the one that's going to sit on my throne and Rule and reign with me amen the one that's working her tail off to see other nature change because that's God's priority right and we need to get our priority sunk in with God's because I tell you when it's all over when Jesus comes he really ain't going to care how many jobs they got out the door how much money I made how many cars I had then there's going to be no interest there with God his interest is is going to be the the jewels come from the souls that we get saved so how many Souls have we have we got saved how many souls are we working on Amen how many souls are we working on I I know this is this this but look look I would I I would not be I would not do you any justice in my life if I'm measuring your life with this and I don't want to face you on the other side with a watered down gospel I'd rather have the facts up front amen Galatians 5:13 for brother we have been called unto Liberty only use not your you only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another is't that beautiful God's given us all Liberty we got Liberty what are we dealing with it nobody's going to tell me what to do I'm going to do this I'm going to you with your Liberty you're supposed to serve one another for all the laws fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself we've been called to Liberty so we don't want to use that liberty for ourselves we want to use it for one another we want to serve the body we want to esteem others more than ourselves we want to focus on trying to help somebody get closer to God and not just become a good friend with him we want to be spiritually washing people's feet I know we had foot washing but we need to be practicing the spiritual foot washing find somebody's feet that you can help walk labor and prayer carry a burden for somebody's nature change when we're living and walking and laboring to see somebody changed we know that we're walking with the love of God in our heart and that's what it means to serve one another all right we can't we can't go we can't stop the service now there's a lot I'm not going to get to but we can't stop the service without going 1 Corinthians 13 because in this there's like 15 inches in these verses 15 points that the love of God will do that human love it's not even on the stick you can't even get it on there 1 Corinthians 13 starting with verse four charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself and is not puffed up there's quite a few right in that one verse it does not behave itself unseemingly it seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil but it re it rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth see as much as you may not like maybe a strong message this is really not a strong message but it could be the love of God inside you should be rejoicing just rejoicing for this truth that we're hearing today it beareth all things it believeth all things it hopeth all things it endureth all things charity never faileth that's it right there and uh we don't got time to read it but as as you know this is being typed in verse 11 when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away the childish things in other words this is the message charity grows up Charity grows up it don't stay like a baby it grows up and I I believe the bride the bride grows up but there's a lot of other people remember there was only Joshua and Caleb there was those were the only two that that really grew up because they wholly followed the Lord they had a different Spirit where the other ones they just no no I want to stay baby I want to go back into Egypt I wanna I I want to you know back there at least I could you know do this and do that and I could at least have this kind of out here in the wilderness in between right supposed to be serving God supposed to be going to church but you know think my knees aren't getting taken care of murmuring complaining we got to grow up Romans 5:2 we we need to read this because you had you said you have a hope in you right all right we need to read this five Romans 52 by whom also we have access by faith into this great where in We Stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations knowing that tribulation it works patience how else are we going to get to the love of God right we because love of God is patient so we need the trials to get there and then impatience experience and patient and patience experience and experience brings more hope you ever been to a place where you just seem like all hope is gone start exercising just a little bit and that will produce a little bit more and before you know you'll have more amen and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us so you cannot have the you cannot have the love of God in you if you don't have the Holy Ghost In You now you can have it on you you can experience it but I'm talking about if you just if you focus on one thing I know we talked about a lot of things and I'm not asking you to go home and make sure you put all 36 things into practice today but what I am asking you to do is if if you want truly to be a disciple of Christ to where you line up with the word just seek more of the Holy Ghost get serious about about you make make a decision today I'm going to come to the altar I I I'm going to the altar is in Your Heart by the way you don't got to necessarily come up here I but I'm GNA dedicate myself to God and I'm really I I know that God is speaking to me because God may not be speaking to you right God may not right there's three types of Believers he may not be but if God is speaking to you and you want to become the manifested bride of Christ we're running out of time we've got to take this word serious we've got to we've got to start I I want this I want I I want to dedicate myself all right just got a couple quotes can you bear with me for a couple quotes no more scriptures thank you thank you thank you for your patience and those who said no brother Bram said the rejected King he said I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in the room now this is a voice from Heaven this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it that means if you have the Holy Ghost you're going he said I'm more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter in there oh my precious friends my my beloved my darters of the Gospel my begotten children unto God listen to me as your pastor I wish there was some way I could explain it there's no words I I couldn't find them how many has ever experienced the love of God before now can you can you define it can can you explain it can you can you convey it to another person to where they they know what you're you're saying it's literally impossible the only way you can know the love of God is only by experiencing it from God himself the only way somehow there's got to be I I believe in this and I want it and I'm going to seek after it and then when you do it'll come he said but just beyond this last breath and the most glorious thing that that you've ever there is no way to explain it there's just no way I can't do it but whatever you do friends lay aside everything else till you get perfect love now as we most of us are aware we've read this quote before a number of times so my question to you at this point that have heard this quote before what things have you laid aside that's a good question don't you think brother Ron what things have you laid aside because I I'll say it like this how are we going to get there if brother B says what we need to get there is perfect love amen there is no other way he said get to a spot that you can love everybody love your enemy everything else he said this one visit has made me a different man and I can never never never never be the same brother Bram that I was he says whatever you do in the beyond the curtain of time lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even your enemy no matter if the planes are rocking Lightnings flashing the guns the enemy are upon you these things don't matter get perfect love so I'll just say it like this I don't care what's going on in your home I don't care what's going on in your job I don't care what's going on in your bank account I don't care what's going on in your family I don't care what's going on in your health I I I don't care let come what may my focus is to get perfect love amen that's what you need to get it because if you have to wait till everything's kind of the way you would like it to be before you start getting more serious with God I'm telling you it'll never ever happen as sure as anything he says and if you have not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit receive it now press on to that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain time let's Stand Together God bless you brandom said in the message Victory days says let God conquer You by his power of love let God conquer You by his power of love amen let's sing that it is no secret what God can do what he's done for others he'll do for you and you may not feel you may not even feel the presence of God right this second but as sure as anything he is here and you must just believe the word believe the word it is no seet what

his ears are open to their cries I wonder if there' be anyone here today say brother John would you pray for me I am Desiring to have the fullness of God's love in my life amen God bless these hands God sees your your sincere desire to press forward into God's love praise the Lord praise the Lord you may put down your hands for just a moment I wonder if there be anyone here today feels that you've got troubles in your life life things are standing in the way of you getting to the place where you feel that you could just let go and let God have his way in your life and you say brother John God knows all about what you pray for me lift up your hands and I'm going to remember you in prayer God bless these hands amen don't don't be ashamed God God sees your heart God sees your heartache God sees your trial then I'm going to pray with you the Bible says that we're just two or three would agree in Touching any one thing it' be established let's unite our heart in prayer one for another as we go before him and ask God just to move mightily in these requests Heavenly Father Lord my hands are lifted with the hands of your your people [Music] today Lord there is a longing in the heart of each one to be so full of your love that nothing could bother them no fear could come into their Tabernacle because perfect love would cast out all that fear and father I pray at this moment in your presence as this song that's being played right now in your presence troubles vanish hearts are mended needs are met Lord like that one man that quoted that brother brother Brandon quoted that one man that is when we make contact with you that's the greatest power there is on the earth and Lord we're making contact with you right this moment we know you're a God that answers by prayer and Lord we lay our heart to you our petition before you today and these needs that were behind the hands that were raised the sincereness this the the the seriousness behind it Lord I pray
