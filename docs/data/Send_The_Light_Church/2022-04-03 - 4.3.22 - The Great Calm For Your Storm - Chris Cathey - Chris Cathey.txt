set my timer where i don't where i'll well rush you out of here but so praise the lord matthew 8 chapter 23 or 8 23 the verse 23 we're going to go to it says and when he he was entered into a ship his disciples followed him and behold there rose a great tempest in the sea and so much that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying lord save us we perish and he said unto him why are ye fearful oh ye of little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds in the sea and there was a great calm but the man marveled saying what a manner of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him you may be seated i want to speak to you this morning just a few minutes i felt led to speak on a great calm before your storm he's our calm in our storm we serve a god that's the same yesterday today and forever not just it's because it's on the tabernacle it's because it's in the bible this morning not because it's in jeffersonville and the tabernacle says we are he is the same yesterday today forever it's because the prophet of god had the word of god and he and that was his absolute this morning the word of god he says he'll never leave us or forsake us he said that heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not so i want to be basting basking in his presence always in the word of god amen amen says the mighty conqueror he says oh satan tried and tried again to do everything one night laying on the back of the ship he said seen him asleep and he said oh i'll destroy him right now but he couldn't he tried to tip him into doing the wrong thing but he couldn't do it he said why he said he'd been sprayed with a repellent a predestination and i want to tell you this morning you've been sprayed with the repellent of predestination this morning i tell you you always go out in the woods and the boys get ticks on them so my boy my wife sprays them down with off and the the the whatever it's called the woods or wild for whatever it's called but i'm telling you jesus christ sprayed something on you this morning he's prayed spray the repellent of predestination and i'm not believing i'm not talking just to the world this morning i believe i'm talking to the saints of god this morning i believe i'm calling people that's called out called out of this the latest sea of this late hour but there's a light and gosh in here today as it fit in michigan i tell you there's a light and gosh in here this morning and i believe i'm here with you this morning for proclaiming that there's a great there's a great storm but there's a calm to our storm i think sometimes in our life we we start the storms we we want to get involved in storms we we create our own storms but i tell you god wants to be your calm this morning god wants to calm your storm he said oh a repellent of predestination i love that he said i can't be deceived it can't be deceived he said no no the word said he'll be here amen there ain't no devil going to bother him no other son of god that's predestinated to take his place he is sprayed with a propellant satan's poison denomination doctors don't even touch him at all he moves right along nothing going to bother him see he's a man he was laying out there on the ship that night it floated around ten thousand devils on the sea swore that they would drown him think about it that little old ship bobbing up and down like a border bottle stopper the devil says i got him now he's a laying there he's a he said he's asleep laying there how much more do we not think the devil wants us he said he's so tired from healing the sick until he couldn't can't move he said he was a man he said when he was laying there asleep that's true he said but when he put his foot on the braille of the bolt he looked up and said peace be still that's more than a man that was god speaking out of the sign hallelujah he said it's true he was a man that night laying in the back of the little boat on the stormy sea he said the little boat was tossed about like a little bottle stopper and ten thousand devils of the sea had swore they would drown them he was tired he was a man he was laying on the back of the boat he said but when he arose he walked forward he put his foot on the brow of the bolt and looked up towards heaven and said peace be still and the winds and the waves obeyed them he said that was more than a man speaking there that was the great mighty conqueror he said he spoke to the wind and it went to the cave like a puppy dog oh he spoke to the wind and it went to the cave like a puppy dog i love how brother brown just brings it down to just it seventh age uh great education because it'd be over my head he said like a puppy dog in the sight of the lion he said he spoke to the waves and they folded their hands in perfect rest upon the sea bosom he said it folded their hands he spoke to it he was more than a man he was a mighty conqueror he said he could conquer nature he could conquer death he conquered the waves he conquered the air and i want to tell you this morning he can incarcerate your situation he can conquer your trials and go wherever you're going through this morning he's more than able i tell you we've got to start putting our faith in jesus christ this is oh eve of little faith i tell you the bride of christ should have the strongest faith this morning i'll tell y'all we're not listening to the tapes are we not in the word of god i tell you we got to get rested in jesus christ it's not by my ability but it's by his ability it's not about your ability it's by the one that created the stars that spoke to the waves that split the waters i tell you rob ramsey says hey i was just there he said when he was down at the river in jeffersonville he said i was just there when it happened he never said it was him that did it he said i was just the one there when it came down and i tell you i just want to be there when he comes down all right every situation every storm you got i'm here to tell you he'll calm your storm he said there's never been one like him oh i don't know you think i'm excited maybe i am oh praise god i am too he said but let me alone he said you may think i'm crazy but i'm a lot happier this way he said i was the other way so i'd rather be this way oh my when you think of how he is i tell you if you want to get excited i tell you people can go to ball games and travel all over the world and get excited but we go to church we have a frown on our face we come through the doors and we're we're down and out and we look like we've been eating on a sour apple all day or something but i tell you it's time to put a smile on your face and say god woke me up this morning walk through the hospital and you i tell you you want to get a little down this morning you think you got a storm just start walking through the er right i was at the er the other day my wife's brother got put in the er he had a 42 years old having heart trouble and i was walking in there i got flew in from florida and i said rachel take me to the hospital i went to the hospital as one o'clock i walked through the security guard i started walking walked to the ccu icu i heard walking down the halls and i started thinking lord listen to these people lord i said lord you know brother brown when he had that car wreck he was in the hospital they said their bed started emptying and i said it's because jesus christ and i said lord may you empty these beds may you touch these people in here but most of all would you go to their soul and touch their soul and i'll tell you lord i said thor thank you for letting me be healthy this morning so we have something to be happy about this morning but i love what jesus said he said the storm he said he said behold there was a great tempest in the sea and that ship was covered with waves but he was asleep and then finding that all these waves are on but the lord of christ jesus christ is sleeping oh don't you think he knew about coven before it started don't you think he knew about cancer before it started don't you think you know about everything that's going on in the world that putin over here i'm not scared of putin i'll tell you what i just trust jesus christ he said before the first bomb falls we'll be out of here oh i'm rested on that this morning i'm rested on the thus saith the lord that that prophet brought in this day and it's just from the word of god and malachi and i tell you i didn't come i come from a broke up home kids and i tell you god can mend it back together i don't care if you come from a broke up home don't let the devil lie to you and say you can't live a better life because i tell you god wants to take your storm and he wants to give you a calm in your storm and i'm telling you kids keep your keep your heads up okay if you come up with any kind of relationship i got the school bus one time my dad just a little bit about us we actually grew up in toledo ohio as a kid and now we were coming through there brother john lafontaine's the other day rachel was working on their cd and i said thank you lord for your saving grace dad dropped me off on the highway right there and said son i never want to see you i went walking for miles but i tell you god still had his calm hand on me and you guys just calm him on you this morning every storm every trial every temptation you're going through i'm telling you he's the calm to your storm but look what he said verse 25 and his disciples came and walked him saying lord save us or we perish have you think about disciples have been with them they've done this they've seen every miracle and they're ever here shaking to death if you ask you ask peter james john you asked all these disciples where's your faith i bet you before the storm they'd say we love jesus christ we we think about it we we've been with them we're not scared of anything we got jesus on our side i'm going to sound like us this morning we're like oh we so big and then the next day on monday so the storm starts erasing the storms start to raging on monday and tuesday and my wednesday comes you go oh well i was all talk and the devil knows that sometimes we all talk but i tell you he said when the weakest christian gets on their knees the devil trembles imagine you if you're prayed up and you trust god and you believe jesus christ i believe it you get on your hands and knees and you start praying i tell you next can you imagine what it trembles with satan this morning and he said to him why are you fearful i could imagine i mean he i i would say he would say the same thing imagine you and your son and you gave him all this and you've done this and you've been through all this and you gave him whatever and he questions you you i do the same thing with my boys why why are you doing this son you know how i am it's the life behind the name amen i don't have to sit here about being behind this pulpit this morning i told rachel another boy said that i said it's about five percent behind this it's 95 percent i'd say it's probably more than that it's probably the opposite because it's more of a life behind the name it's behind closed doors of how you live it's not because you just can't say some good words this morning it's about living for jesus christ and he said why are you though fearful he's questioned then he arose and you broke the winds and he's he's a c and there was a great call there was a great calm but i love what he says he said he went there he says in the verse 24 he says a great tempest but i'm glad when there's a great tempest there's a great call when there's a great tempest in your life there's a great calm to call on and i'll tell you you need to try to call them up my wife sings that song call them up tell them what you want i think sometimes we don't tell them enough what we want problems said ask for big things he said he likes your children to ask for big things he said sister rebecca would get in his lap and he said daddy show me your muscles he said i felt all old and ready he said but i tell you i liked it rebrand said i liked it he said that's how the father is this morning he wants you to get in his lap and tell you what you want oh i tell you because he's got everything you have need of this morning and that's what i was thinking this morning when i was writing i said god the only real piece i have is in you and i said play that song and your brother played in the singing this morning i said thank you lord i said because everything that i got my bank account everything you got everything rest in you jesus christ you pay my bills you everything you're my life insurance i tell you can't put you in but he'll take you out this morning oh he'll put you on the other side so if you come down in the press this morning we'll lay hands on you so lay hands on the sick and they shall recover i tell you call me a fanatic on the word of god but i tell you i love the word of god i love jesus christ i love this message i grew up in a broken home in a baptist church didn't know the message at all wife grew up around the world traveling for the for the with the message and i'm thankful this morning amen i'm thankful i we travel a lot of places and i'm thankful to have the message of the hour i'm so thankful my dad told me he said that my grandmother 85 years old still i'll call her today and she'll be sitting on the rocker and you hear the message in the background and i say grandma i call her sister lois to the bible i said grandma say sister lois to the bible i said listen i said what are you listening to because i want to know i want you to tell me what you heard today because i tell you i tell you it's a grandma a mom or a dad this morning that you can be thankful for that's been praying over you it might not be someone in your family this morning whatever it is that's been praying for you and trusting in you saying hey if you've got a wayward child this morning i don't care if you got a wayward child in this world he says your inheritance is yours this morning okay it's time to pick our heads up the devil wants to tell you lies and brother brown says we accept the lies we accept this package this morning this ain't amazon this morning i tell you why you need to trust god trust jesus trust his word this morning put all your faith in jesus christ so every storm you're going through this morning trust him with all you got in you i tell you it might be feeling stormy out there you look on the you look on every app you look on the news stations it wants to drown your sorrows make you feel like your dog died your wife died your animals died but i tell you get in the word of god and it will lift you to higher places higher places that you can walk that you can swim whatever you have need is in jesus christ but i'm glad he says he was a great great temptus but there was a great kong and it wonderful when you're going through a great tempest there's a great calm for you i'm so great now in the greatest tempest he is our great calm but the man marveled saying the matter of this man even the winds and sea obey him so why is we as the bride of christ we get so burnt out and tired and weary and we get so depressed about going through situations but he said this is there to shape us it's there he said they're more precious than gold the word of god says they're more precious than gold so when i get up and i'm going through trials and tribulations and tomorrow they'll be fighting me left and right but i tell you i say lord i'll still serve you if you take this you think about job he said you speak like a foolish woman she said curse god he said you speak like a first he knew where his rest was he knew where his rest if you turn over to mark i was thinking about these storms this morning turn over the mark mark four praise the lord mark for another storm it's all these they're all writing all all three of them writing about different storms in a different angle look in the saint verse 35 4 35 and the same day when the evening was come he has said let us pass over to the other side and when he sent away the multitude he took him even excuse me as he was in the ship and there was also with him with other little ships and there rose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full think about that his boat was full do you feel like you came to church this morning your boat's full your life's full of troubles and jowl and sorrow but you know what you can empty that boat out this morning you can there's a drain plug you can pull out this morning there's a drain plug inside that you can pull out and leave your cares at this altar this morning there's a drain point i tell you i think sometimes we need to forget the drain plug we need to forget it pull it out and say lord drain my life but i tell you sometimes we get in the midst of the storm we do forget the drain plugs we let the devil just start filling our life up we start filling with cares of this world and things of the world but i tell you god says greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world amen but verse 4 he says 37 and there arose a great okay here he's speaking again here goes from another angle and it rose a great storm of the wind that waves it beat into the ship so it was now full and one and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow think about that this morning i sound silly this morning but i like my pillow i lay down i said lord you like a pillow i like a pillow too praise god i know it was pretty funny pretty simple this morning but i tell you he was asleep on the pillow this big old storage coming along and he's on his he's on this temporary pillow just lay there praise god because he he's the master of all the storms he knew about the storm he knew about your storm he knew about your situation this morning before you woke up this morning he knew who you were going to be here this morning he said he was in the hinder part of sleep on the pillow and they alone came and said master cares now now we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto them peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm i tell you there was a take about verse 37 said there was a great storm in verse 39 it said there was a great call and i'll tell you guards you might have a great storm but there's a great calm for your storm this morning that's jesus christ it ain't me it ain't what i can bring a brother john it's jesus christ that can calm your storm you've got a great great storm give him the great calm and he said unto them why are you so why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said unto another what manner of man is this and the wind and then we'll see obey them let's turn over to luke and see what he had to say luke 8 22 it said now it came to pass on a certain day they went to the ship with his disciples and he said unto him let us go over and to the other side of the lake and they launched forth but as they sailed he fell asleep he keep everywhere he looked he's falling asleep well now my wife knows hey when i'm resting and i'm tired and i'm weary she said honey don't don't let chris sit down because if he sits down one minute he's out he's out he'll hear no storms the stars could be raging tornado can rip the house off and i'm still sleeping rachel could be up don't matter she opened the windows open the doors i don't matter if the thief could come in we'd still be asleep i would be because i tell you i believe there's a great calm to my storm when i go to sleep and we read our bible we pray and we claim that we say lord forgive us of everything god we cleanse our lives because our heartbreak could stop in the morning right and i believe that brother says when we get down to the river and he says the devil could take us all the way down to the river of death he said but now after that it's god's time he takes us from death and to life and i tell you that's why i sleep like a baby because when i'm out i'm out and rachel's like i don't know what's the storm's coming on but i tell you he's a great con to your storm a great calm but like we said now kate bliss go verse 23 but as they sailed he fell asleep and they came down the storm of wind on the lake and they were filled with water and they were in jeopardy and they came and they woke him saying master master we perish then he arose and rebuked the wind and he raging of the water and they ceased and there was a con and he said where is your faith everything was linked to their faith everything he said you came and pleased god without having faith you can't hebrews 11. it's all based on faith abraham had faith all of them had faith that all they all throughout history noah had faith every one of them had faith in god because when he tells us to do something they did it they believed god they took god at his word i'll tell you but you know what i was thinking this morning as i was studying last night late until late hours i was thinking jesus i said you know what even if you're in my boat even if you're in my boat we're still going through storms even if you're in my boat this morning i thought about that i was praising god last night she was asleep it was three o'clock in the morning i said lord thank you lord we're going through treacherous waters we're going through times that we haven't seen before the prophet has already even said it it's just sometimes we don't listen enough we don't read the all these messages on there they're not just made for the bookshelf they're on this bookshelf over here you know i just made it for the pastor this morning they're made for every laity they're made for every pastor maybe every kid this morning to press forward i provoke you to get in that word or to get in that message because it will change you it'll give you a different fulfill it'll make you talk different talk different it'll make you act different i'll tell you i'm like hattie wright i'm doug how you writing this morning that brother brown that's nothing but the truth i'm like hey right just call me crazy this morning but i said that's nothing but the truth brother i tell you i come from a baptist church broke up home but when i heard the truth i went in the military for eight years i was in the army i left house very early i said dad sign this waiver get me out of this broke up home he come home he said son all right let's sign it i said science cause i'm out of here and i tell you i went to the military my grandmother handed me two tapes she had my jezebel religion while we're in all the nomination i'll tell you why i was tearing up barracks i was going around every barrack i'd say we had bible study every day i tell you what i open the word of god we have people in the cafeteria they came where's philippians 4 13 because they called me one night about midnight praying over them reading philly because well i can do all things through christ and i tell you whatever storm you got this morning you could do all things through christ not yourself this morning and we just went up to fort leonard wood missouri we were riding through there was preaching for a brother and we were up through there and i brought my kids on the base i said that is where daddy's barracks were and i saw him marching through and i said praise god i don't know how many kids or what have been influenced but i want to be a right for you jesus and my dad told me about we've been married 15 years now my dad looked at me about seven years ago and he said the very thing the very thing that i traveled the world they try to keep you boys away from the very thing that are trying to keep you away from this message you went into he said i kept you from your grandmother i traveled the world i was he ran plastic plants all over the world then he was in orange corn and as a director over in toledo ohio and i'd tell you i said dad i said i'd rather have love and i'd rather have the truth than have any money that i don't care about and i tell your kids won't love the kids don't care about material things they might ask for it always but they want love of jesus in your life they want the love of jesus in your life praise the well i lord what he said matthew said it was a great tempest mark said it was a great storm luke said waters were raging think about it this morning they all said it was some great situation isn't it funny that we always even us today even myself even myself saying oh we're going through a great great trial but god is shaping us he's shaping us but i'm glad that jesus went through the storm with him i'm glad he didn't jump out of the boat and run off i'm going to think about it this morning he is anywhere to sleep on her pillow i tell you what jesus come in my house sleep on my pillow this morning lord i was praying last night i said lord sleep in that bed right there while my wife sleeps while i keep studying sleep on that pillow that pillow's yours lord because i want you i'm like joshua for me and my house will serve the lord and i tell you that's how we're going to live i said boys as long as i live as long as i have breath you're going to stay in fellowship with jesus christ you're going to go to church when the doors are open i tell you the closing churches even in this message and it breaks my heart tears my heart apart because he says more so as the day is approaching to come to the word house of god more so support your ministry short your pastor i'll tell you i was so blessed when i saw another lighthouse that i've never been to i was thinking about you might not heard that that thing called g.i joe you might never heard of that but g.i joe you ever heard of g.i joe i had little army mans my grandmother gave me iron mans and all she gave us was 12 hours out there with a half a sandwich and some kool-aid and she mixed it up that stuff be hot she said son you're staying out there all day now the kids want to get on their games i say boys will limit it to about an hour because they want to be on them all the time the devil wants to take their minds and their kids i don't know why i'm saying this tomorrow but i'm telling you they want to take us the devil wants to take their minds and wrap it in video games and things of the world but i'm telling you limit that stuff limit that stuff they can spend an hour on the game they can spend an hour in the bible they can spend an hour in prayer amen i tell you limit it and see what god will do but he always said i remember saying he was saying gi joe it would say at the end of it would say now you know and no one's half the battle you know what you know what the truth is you know what the truth my wife sings a song about the truth and i tell you we know what the truth is this morning and we know and knowings half the battle i believe we just take what we know and we take the word of god with brother we could the bible take the word it'll affect satan any place anywhere any time so tossed about 1956 he said let the storms rage he said my anchor holds with the veil can't tell you why he said we have a lot of storms on the seas this day but i'm thankful for an anchor that holds steadfast within the veil oh he said when she's rocking and she looks like every move would send her to the bottom yet my anchor is in the veil he said i'm anchored in the bell i'm anchored in jesus the storms of life i brave i'm anchored in jesus i fear no wind or wave i'm anchored in jesus for he have power to save i'm anchored in the rock of ages amen oh church yeah i'm telling you young kids you'll realize you start having aches and pains and this and that i'm maybe not not that old but i tell you start to realize lord you need more jesus more than you think you do i say lord every to every breath i get every now every next day devil i get up out of the bed i say lord here i'm coming for you devil we're going to fight again but i tell you what i'm coming after you brother baby said jesus meeting his brother in 1956 he said when the sea was blowing and storming did you ever i guess maybe some of you has never been privileged to see a ship anchored oh my i wrote them when they when they throwed out the sea anchor like that until he said until the little craft couldn't even go over the top of the wave he said it wouldn't go through the wave he said but as long as the anchor held that's all it makes any difference he said whether we go over it under it around it or through it doesn't matter the anchor holds he said that's the way when storm of ice begins to shake us he said we may have to go through he said we may have to go over we may have to go under or around it he said but just let the anchor hole within the veil to the unseen we just they said we don't know just exactly where it is at but it's it's a holding just like the little boy he said you know he said that kite oh i love this right he said you heard the old proverb the story said oh how do you know that the coyote he said there's a kite on the end of there he said i can feel it talking i talked about that last night i heard him say that he said oh the little boy is walking can you imagine i was just sitting in there i'd say i know my wife was probably tossing because i was traveling on hallelujah last night he said i just see him flying the kite he said i couldn't see the kite but i could feel it tugging have you felt god talking your life lately have you felt god in your storm i'll tell you sometimes just pulling the kite when you're going through hard times pick it up and just say lord are you still there and he says hey i'm still there he says i might be asleep in your boat but they call me on the scene he said if you feel it still tugging god's dealing with your hearts oh he said then we know our anchor still holds praise god 1961 revelation chapter 5. he said but now he said they've been through all these years until now we have the earnest of our inheritance he said oh my what do we have we have an evidence that god lives we have the evidence that god is with us we have the evidence that god has not forsaken us that we are his and he is ours praise god he said we're anchored in christ he said now the trees don't have to have to he said don't have it nature doesn't have it but yet we are still groaning with him because as yet we we haven't received the fullness of our adoption you know what we're going through storms we're going through trials and i want to hear you this morning i'll tell you what we need to trust in jesus christ trust in every storm every battle every situation every family every marital problem i don't care what you got this morning there ain't nothing too great for god i tell you he'll create you be your calm to your greats but we had the earnest of it he said we're picked up from the things of the world and now become sons and daughters of god i tell you i love coming around message believers because i told my wife i was telling everybody everywhere we travel they're the cream of the crop they're the cream of the crop the way they act the way they talk the way they carry themselves you know what it's because jesus truly lives on the inside it's because it ain't just a denomination spirit it's what cause the lord jesus christ reigns and i tell you you need to let him reign more in your life and they'll release the storms that are in your life and the cares and when the kids get sick and things of the lives carries we start franking and the first thing we do is start worrying about this and worry about that when we should just put our hands and just say lord calm this storm calm the storm i love cursed peter 4 12 and 13. he said beloved think it's not strange concerning the fiery trial which is try you as though some strange that happened unto you but rejoice oh that's hard to do but it but rejoices so much as you partakers of christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also in exceedingly joy amen oh he said rejoice when you're going through storms you're going through trials can you imagine he tells you the opposite right instead of being down and out he tells you to rejoice amen because you know god is still working with you what ramp says in this right in this school right in this this uh this verse the unchangeable god working in an unexpectable way 1962. he said when god makes a promise on the opposite he said he said he makes a promise that's only test you whether you really got the word or not the man he said the man that's good he said got good gold don't mind going to testing stone he said when he's got good gold he wants to test it he wants to rub on it and see how it shines i said that brother brandon say that he said that's true he says see only at peter said i believe it was that these trials are come to test us he said try us see what we'll do with it that's right he said when you get the holy ghost and husband's going to run run you out of the house or mother's going to make you leave home these things don't give up don't give up the prophet of god said don't give up so i tell you this morning don't give up i don't care what you're going through but i tell you don't give up i'll tell you we got code within the land and i'll tell you shut even message churches down right and it's sad i told right down the road i don't know if i've ever y'all heard me say this but i always say it because i believe god gave it to me i told you what i told rachel i said right on the road and god said you know what colbus stands for honey i said christ overcomes viruses infectious and diseases this is what it stands for this morning uh whatever trial brotherham said cancer will be a drop in the bucket this morning amen they're always saying the delta virus is coming the american viruses is coming the american airlines viruses all these viruses you everywhere you go it's like we'll be in line at the airport we get in line and wherever where we travel you get in line and you're six feet apart and then you get on a sardine can and you're four inches apart but you can hold your mask down while you're eating you see where the devil has tucked our minds and i bet you he sits there and laughs he's on the back road just eating popcorn he's like look at these crazies brother brown called them idiots yeah i'm telling you he's on the back row laughing going watch them they're eating they cause their masks down i guess cover don't fly over when you're four feet up down when you're sitting in a restaurant i hate to go there but i'm saying when you're sitting on purple we're all tired of hearing about it but you're sitting on the airplane and you're holding your mask and all of a sudden you don't it don't train you don't go around the airplane then as long as you're eating and drinking water i said what the devil has sold us is a bunch of lies he sold you a bunch of lies this morning and if you come with a wayward child or a messed marriage or whatever it is he's selling you lies this morning and i'm here to tell you this morning you could take them lives and put them back to hell where they came from he said greater is you that he that's in the world that's right i'll tell you we just got to trust god more i'm here to tell you how we traveled more and colder than we ever traveled i tell you what we got calls everywhere i said i guess they thought chris was just crazy enough to get in the car and come or get in the airplane i said well god i tell you you said lay hands on the sick they shall recover i'm not gonna do it from six feet away i'm not gonna say we gotta stay six feet we'll pray for you i'll pray lay hands on you and i'll tell you that demon will depart and if he doesn't depart and i've had loved ones pass away with it and i'll tell you you know what they're on a better side and you know what jesus just like this boat and just like this storm just like the storm we're going through in this generation you don't think he saw it coming he hung everything young the stars he owned the moon he has the keys he has everything this morning why don't we trust him this morning why don't we trust him with everything we got and believe god with all our heart we have this great message and we travel we we say we believe a message but i tell you do we truly have the message in us i know your spirit because i'm not saying i know all the quotes this morning but i know the author this morning barbara said in victory day he said when it looks like everything's gone wrong god's given you a trial he said he's got confidence in you and you he said he's got confidence in you oh well i'll tell you i had to underline that three times he said he don't have to baby you around you're not a hotbed playing a hybrid you're a real christian god's given you a test to see what you're all about you think about job you read job for the sake of time you think about job this morning job he said you can do everything you can but don't take his life but then he asked him he asked the lord permission can you think about it the devil asked him for permission so when he's messing with you this morning and you're going through his trials he has to walk up to him and say lord can i mess with his sister this morning can i mess with brother john this morning can i do this because he asked for permission from god he said you could take everything but not his life he said but god there's a problem here there's a hedge of protection around them he said yeah because i don't want you to take his life thank you jesus that's why you're still here this morning that's why you still have breath in your body i'm not saying these diseases and covenant all this stuff ain't real i'm just telling you we serve a real god i'm tired of hearing the nonsense of craziness on this out in this world and we can't take god at his word i tell you we're supposed to be bible believing saints that believe everything from genesis to revelation to trust what the prophet said was true i'll tell you they questioned the cloud they questioned it i said look brother brown said 99 is a lie i said well just call me a fanatic i'll be like how do you write everything he said whatever this that well hey he might have messed up he was still a man he even said he was a man brother brother said he was a man i tell you he was born in a with a birth he wasn't born like jesus christ but i tell you he always pointed us to jesus christ he pointed us to jesus christ and i'm so thankful that he did because you wouldn't know that all the mysteries throughout the entire bible amen without the prophet of god i'm not ashamed of it amen amen he said no wonder peter said these fiery trials why count it a joy it's more precious than you gold and many times we hum he's in hall he said oh well if we just well he said well it's just something god give you to overcome he said he knows you'll do it he's put his trust in you he's put his trust in you put his trust in me he said the lord jesus thou found an exhaustible fountain life he said flows through us today lord cleanse us from all unbelief in all sin that we might be able to stand in that presence knowing that there is no need there is a need among us he said we know that we are sinners not worthy of any blessing i thought about last night's her cry i said lord i don't receive i i i'm a sinner saved by grace by the way you called me from a broke up home in the baptist church that you called me to the truth amen i said lord if you don't do anything for me i'll still love you lord reverend save you send my soul to hell i'll still serve you and honestly i struggled with that for years but now i really have that heart praise god after many years of studying and praying and seeking god now i know why brother brown says it because when you fall in love with jesus when you love him more than your wife when you love him more than your kids when you love him more than material things you say lord even whatever you do with me lord i still love you lord hell couldn't handle you this morning if you truly love jesus christ if you sent your soul to hell he knew he couldn't handle you because you loved jesus christ so much it would ooze out it would stop every flame if you think about the hebrew children this morning you don't think they went through a fire you don't think they went through a trial well i love what he said they said they brought them up there and that never knezer brought the boys up there he said put them in that put them in there he said he said they want to serve my gods he said i want to serve their gods and he said well guess what i heat it seven times hotter i'm paraphrasing time tonight this morning but he said he hit seven times on he said they got him up to there and he said the guard in the bible says the guardian there it is he said the guards were dying they couldn't throw them in but you know what i love what god does for us he said when two or three are gathered he's in our midst and i tell you he knew not to throw them one by one in the fire he knew that he had to throw three of him in the fire because he said if he either threw one in the fire he wouldn't have came on his word think about it this morning he said when two or three are together but when he threw all three of them in that's his problem if he was smart he would have threw one and wanted one at a time because he couldn't honor his word so he threw them all in there but you know what in the storm jesus christ was already in the fire in the flames cooling it up before they arrived think about it he's in your boat this morning he's laying on a pillow i don't know what's that thing called mr pillow he's laying on mr pillow this morning we just need to wake him up amen we just need to wake him up have you woke him up lately have you woke him up in your life and your marriage and the way your work wherever you have have you woke him up he said but then when we think of him oh he came and looked at us took our sins and with his blood there he said oh it's not us in their presence of god it's him just our voice through his blood his blood speaking aren't you thankful that his blood speaks it's like cain and abel abel kill uh canaan cain killed abel he said where did you put him his blood speaks but i'll tell you think about if his blood speaks what the blood of christ speaks this morning oh it speaks volumes this morning the blood that shed on calvary this morning he'll cover every situation every storm every trial you got this morning i tell you speaking this morning he said oh god then cleanse our hearts from sin and unbelief give us the desires our heart for we truly have the desires to serve you oh that was my prayer in these awakening conditions weakening conditions afflictions and things of the world that's put upon us oh i tell you i love this message i told rachel i said it's more current than the newspaper i don't need that junk throw that junk away give me a message book give me something to tell me about the world falling apart he said we've been told that we think that it's not strange to think of these trials come he said there's only he said there's only working out for our good it's true he said to he said and to perfect perfect us bring us into that place these great deserts of experience where righteous men are molded into saints oh he said and when the burdens are so heavy we can't go far no farther then we raise our hands and scream to our father then hear from heaven lord kill us make us as well for the kingdom of god's sake the masterpiece the masterpiece you think about it this morning brother brandon was sitting there in that bed i tell you know what the devil wants to lie to us in our storms he wants to tell you you're not saved i'm telling you he fights me too yeah it's the same devil that fights me and fights you just because i'm up here speaking this morning doesn't mean he come to my house he comes to every one of our house sometimes we bring him to church with us we sit him beside us but i tell you he wants to tell you this morning be telling you that you're not saved say get behind me satan say i'm a child of god he wants to lie to you he wants to put you in a dark room by yourself somewhere in your storm where people think they don't care anymore the pastor of this don't care but i tell you they do care there's people in this church this morning that do care for your soul you think about brother brandon if he didn't kill the brother brandon with his little daughter in the bed she's passing away and she started to pass away and the devil started to get in his ear got on his shoulder and said look hey won't you give up why don't you do this why don't you do that think about it he's telling the prophet he said your daughter can't save her he said look at her he said blessed be the lord that giveth and take it take it give it away take it away i'll tell you i think about that this morning lord let me be in that presence but you know what really matters in these storms i was reading all three of these throughout different the way they brought it forth you know what really matters he says what we rely on on the storms amen amen amen what are you relying on this morning what are you relying on this morning are you relying they didn't rely on jesus christ jesus christ was in the boat but they didn't rely on them you think about it he rebuked them but they weren't relying on them matthew wasn't fearful think about it think about it each disciple they said they have faith think about it when the boat fills up you know you could just you could have the worst storms i tell you it's in the greatest storms that you still give to god you still give to the house of god you give the missions you still pray no matter what storm you go through you give to jesus christ i don't care it's not his prayer i tell you he said he's shaping us his formula are you i've read the quotes to you he said he's he's got confidence in you this morning so when you're going through a trial it ain't jesus's fault i tell you jesus is tempted just showing us he loves us he's showing us he loves us but i thought throughout this i wrote some things down last night about it all we can rest turn to luke 8 back to luke kate real quick i love what he said luke 8 22 we can rest in his commands we could rest his commands because look in that verse 22 right there in the red now it came to pass on a certain day within the ship and his disciple he said to him let us go over into the other side of the lake he commanded them let us go over amen so he's commanded even in revelations i'll read the revelation back there earlier right you don't have to turn to it but revelation 17 or 19. it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and the wife had made herself ready and what you're doing this morning is making yourself ready and we came to rest on his commands we're resting on his commands mark 4 turn to mark it says math mark 4 35 it said here here's another command he said say to them even if it was come he said to them let us pass over unto the other side he's given you a command this morning he said look you put my faith in me and you let rest in me and let me take care of your storm hebrews 13 5 let your conversation be without covetousness and be he said be content with such things he says as ye have for he has said i will never leave thee nor forsake me hebrews 13 6 i read on last night so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do to me amen i tell you just call me crazy or fanatic this morning but i believe every word of this this morning i tell you wherever i go wherever i live i tell you what i believe the word of god we gotta take what he says this morning don't take what the social media says this morning don't take what facebook says this morning because i tell you most of facebook is fake anyway i need to be fake book because usually it's pictures from 19 it's back from high school pictures and then when you see them they don't even look that same way it's like gosh they're living in a real view mirror their whole life brethren said yeah you will crash when you live through a rearview mirror but you know how big a windshield is this morning when you look to a windshield this morning god wants to give you that view this morning god's gave you a view he's gave you manna from above he's gave you plenty of messages he's gave you a minister that loves the lord he's going to be a church to trust the lord in and when these doors are open come and worship lord i tell you we get in our own stores because we're starting to create them i create them i create them i get all upset about some things that i shouldn't even get upset about sometimes the lord's like why calm down you're creating your own storm i'm going to send you some storms you don't need to create them that's what he told me last night she was in the bed the way he told me he said chris you need to quit creating them i'm talking was preaching to me this morning too hey i'm telling you romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good that love that to them that love god and he says and then they were called according to his purpose you were called for his purpose you were if you wouldn't you'd be in the baptist church or you'd have your pajamas on this morning sitting there drinking a thing of coffee while you're watching church but i'm telling you they ain't church call me old school this morning but that ain't church the pastor can't look at you no one can talk to you the holy spirit can't deal with you i'm sorry if you're streaming this morning i don't mean to come against it but hey if you're sick and you're in the bed hey have at it because i'm thankful for it but if you can get in the car and you feel good and it's just being lazy and you're using it as an excuse i tell you i provoke you to get in the car and get a blessing i'm telling you i'm thankful for it because when i get up we got sick we were down in the bed but we turned on service it ain't the same i hate it i said lord give me if i could just get out of here i'd go i try to use wisdom in that but i'll just tell you the devil devils use this every bit of this as an excuse for us saints to not come together because he said when two or three are gathered he's in the midst i tell you that's when cancer starts to drop that's when depression starts to leave that's when your marriage starts to heal that's when kids life start to change i tell you why i want to keep my kids always in the presence of god the resurrection of jerius 1954 he said that's the way he does just about the time he gets to the very darkest of hours then jesus comes along we fret and worry we we christians and the babies get sick or something listen listen this is so true or something happens or something don't show up he said we'll just go so nervous and upset we should just sit quiet he said he's the one he's the one who commanded it oh lord help me just to sit quiet in his presence he said we're living under his desperation living under his grace just sit still he'll be alone after a while he said just be still and he'll come show up brother braham said one place he said the angels came to i love how brother brown can bring it all out and he says he said the angels came to him and asked permission think about this the angels came to god and said can i go down to the fiery furnace they came to him and said hey woodworm and all these other angels came to him and said can i have permission to go down there he said you see them three were hebrew children about to walk in that fiery furnace and brother brown said yes i see him he said i see him he said but that job is for me not y'all he said i thank you for the offer thank you think about it they were going through the store and barbara upstairs they came and asked for permission could they come blow it out with the water blow the blow the storm away blow the fiery furnace jesus said no i'm going down there because he had to honor his word he said he'll open you up in the healing service somewhere he'll be guided somewhere you'll pray for the sick and you've got a sickness he said if not he'll just put it on you're upon your heart so bad he said you'll just kneel down in the room and ask him about it yourself that's right so just remember he works all things together for the good i said lord help me when i get my kids get sick oh if something goes on lord not to panic he said just to sit there and be quiet wait for him wait for him i'm here to tell you we need to start waiting for jesus wait for jesus john 16 36 these things i have spoken to you that ye might he said ye might have peace in the world you see you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world we're over here stressing about the world but he said i've overcome the world yes i've overcome it he says in the uh patriot abraham 1964 he conquered both death and hell he rose up on the third day saying i've overcome and because i live you live also oh what a promise he said the seat of america he conquered grave rose up on the third day i don't understand why we stress so much i don't get i'm starting to realize that every day i'll go through life they're like chris why are you not worried about it listen i can't control it but i know who's got the control towers i know who's controlling the control towers this morning amen he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave he conquered temptation amen oh no he said oh now we are more than conquerors through him that loved us and gave us his life he said be in the royal seat of abraham he said with the same spirit of god i'm going to skip through this for time i want to read this john 14 27 he said peace i leave you with leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth listen i give i he's a give eye unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid i said lord you're dealing with me so much lord let me not be troubled let me have all my rest and every storm and every situation be in you to whom should we go he said if we ever ever got a real peace you've got jesus brother bram said to whom shall we go 1960s if you ever got real peace you've got jesus i said lord that's what i want i want to walk through this life like my brother here i saw him at brother brad burgess's and he got out of the car i helped him out of the car and i said god bless this brother brother johnson i said you know how many years probably on the battlefield just keep pressing on i said if he can come to church we all have no excuses we have no excuses i said lord if i get that old lord i want to come to the house of god because i bet you if you ask brother johnson today he said i know where my peace comes from i know where my breath comes from i know where my healings come from i know where my paychecks come from and when you realize all your storms are covered by jesus christ you'll show up no matter what age you are no matter how old you are no matter what situation you got this morning you'll come expecting great things amen i said god bless them pick it calm we have no excuses sorry brother that was free i don't know they went in my notes but i just thought about the brother i said man lord give me more of a heart give me that heart when i'm that age to always no matter what it takes if someone has to drive me to church if i have to pay uber or whatever car service they got i'll let me get there probably i'm saying the key to the door there's only one door to healing and jesus is that door there's only one door to peace in my peace i give it to you he's only one door to genuine peace you might think you got peace you might accumulate enough money to buy your home you might accumulate enough money to get your children closed have food to eat you might have accumulated enough popularity to be popular amongst people but when you slip off your shoes at night you and get ready to lay down there's only one thing can give you peace he said that is if you know that you're dying that night that's only one piece that's jesus is the peace he is our peace brother branham's sin he said he's our healing i'm the lord that god it heals all that he's he's at the door to heaven and there's no other door or no other way through jesus jesus christ he is that door to heaven and now jesus is the door to all these things and faith unlocks the door that's what they had they had problems with their faith they saw all these miracles even in brother brown's meetings you asked all these old-timers you ask them this and ask them that and they didn't see this they didn't realize that until he's off the scene they didn't realize this because they saw all the wonders and the miracles they realized that jesus was working through this man rachel's grandmother rachel's grandmother was taken off a clot not in columbia south carolina where we're originally from before we moved eight years ago she got taken off a she was in the pentecostal church bro brown called her off a cot you can hear it on the tape he called and rachel my wife's grandmother alpha cot and she still didn't believe it she said he was a good man but i don't i don't i that's all i see but her mom and dad and all them came out of it and believed it with all their heart and her dad's 75 years old in a retirement home now preached the message all around the world but had a mom that got saw that because you just saw a little bit of wonders but i tell you when you see jesus christ and when this becomes a love letter and then messages become real to you and this becomes your heart and every everything you read in between the lines you see jesus christ he said if you don't see jesus christ he said read it again amen number two musicians can come number two you write this down we can rest in the crowd we can rest in the crowd and you might think it's crazy i say that this morning but look at number four look at uh verse mark 4 36 listen to this this is great he said when they had sent away the multitude they took him and even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships there was little ships i'm referring to you this morning that i you need me and i need you we can rest one another when we go through trials and we go through storms we have one another to rest on now we can look at my brother back here and say how did you make it when you when they said you had this how did you make it when you had this how did your kids get saved when you hired this and they tell you they started to tell you because there was little ships at bay there was little people like me and you and there's other little ships at bay this morning that's going through trials going through storms this morning that we can rest in this morning so we can rest with within the bride that little song that says rest little bride rest for all as well we can come together in our storms lastly i want to leave we can rest in his companionship we can rest in jesus companionship and all three stories jesus was in the boat think about it this morning just for a minute i know we're probably getting starving we're getting getting hungry but i tell you what i tell you what but we can rest in this boat jesus was every story jesus was in the boat jesus says are you in the boat and what i love about it was jesus didn't show up in the boat he was already in the boat and every story jesus was already in the boat and he's in your boat this morning you just need to wake him up amen we just need to wake him up think about genesis 7 real quick does it play something softly i love this genesis 7 you know what was built in the ark and he said the lord said unto noah listen come did you know that jesus was already in his boat yes oh i was having a time last night rachel said you never come to bed i couldn't handle i couldn't stand i've read a book and i kept reading this i read this word and i read this book i couldn't stay up all night i said boy i tell you what we're having a good time over here i said cause i thought about art i saw about noah he said come that means he was already there so whatever situation you brought in this church i'll tell you what you can leave without it he said come because when he started building the note no one started building 120 years he kept not you don't think he had a storm or a trial you don't think they told him you crazy you lost your mind you believe a message you believe malachi 4 and then all of a sudden he kept building anyway he can't build it and he said come and he kept coming and then when he got in the boat and the star coming then fanatics didn't look at him any crazy anymore they said that fanatic was right they're fanatically right i believe jesus christ is close i believe he's closing the ark this morning that was 20 we were in seattle at brother john andy's about three weeks two weeks ago he started a little work there brother john andy's and i'm not bragging i'm giving it to god this morning over 24 people gave their heart to jesus christ i said god i believe you're calling i said i believe your election is so close i believe we're so close and i don't just to scare you this morning i believe we are going through storms and trials to get the bride of christ to get every kid in to get every family member in to get every believer in that's in the boat that's predestinated to be in that boat but i want to tell you just like jesus said you come this morning amen right now if you haven't been baptized i provoke you to be baptized this morning i'll tell you brother john i know he'll turn the water on and we'll baptize you in jesus name i'll tell you what i'll tell you get in the boat just get in the boat jesus says are you in the boat i tell you to step in this morning amen god didn't say go get in the boat he said come on jesus was already waiting for him i love what psalms 37 said david said i've i've been young i've been old he said yet i've not seen the righteous forsaken. amen oh i know i didn't see this seed begging for bread i'm so thankful in closing i'll read this second corinthians 12 9 and he said it to me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness church we don't have no strength it's all in jesus strength it ain't what i could say it ain't what i can do it's all in jesus christ most gladly therefore i will rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ must rest upon us so i tell you out all these scriptures i read he was rested jesus christ was rested because he knew his peace do you know who your peace is in i'm not just saying just because you know all the quotes or you say i've been in the message for 40 years it's more than just saying that do you really have a true peace you have so much of peace that whatever storm you go through every trial every battle you go through you can take every scripture that i read this morning and say lord thank you lord thank you for what i've been through thank you for trying me thank you for bringing me through every fire you know what you didn't say i would go through the fire but you were already in the fire when i went through it so i'm here to tell you he's a calm for your storm this morning but you know what i thought when he said he was at the hinder part of the ship and closing this i just thought about this he was in the hinder part of the ship he said jesus was in the hunger park you know what's in behind hinder part the controls the controls are in the hinder part the the even the motors in the hinder part is he in the hunter part of your life is he is he running the control station this morning he was in the hinder part of the ship he was controlling the ship he's controlling your ship you just gotta get in and believe you gotta rest in him and say lord i ask you to be the control tower i ask you to be the hindu lord whatever ship i just want you to be in this ship whatever part you want to be in just be in it all eyes closed maybe there's someone here this morning that's going through a storm where just says lord i need to rededicate my life maybe someone says i need jesus if someone says lord i i need you to save me oh god oh lord hands are up oh god once more lord maybe you're refilling this morning my hands are up i say lord you probably said there's many refillers oh god father may you take these words that broken up lord and father that that you come every storm you come every trial but god i thank you for being in the boat i thank you for being in the control tower i thank you for controlling our lives lord and when everything seemed lost and we thought our life was that destruction lord and we thought we've lost it all and we think we we come from broken up homes and you mending them back together lord or god there might be a broken home here this morning i asked you would go to their house lord amend it together hold god if there's one here that represents a child lord may they take your word and keep praying over them lord and say lord i i claim my inheritance i claim them this morning
