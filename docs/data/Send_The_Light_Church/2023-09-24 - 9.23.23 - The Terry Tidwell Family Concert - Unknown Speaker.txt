a problem he can't solve can we give him one more great big hand clap [Applause] and and Terry always I mean he makes a list and I'm standing here you know looking at the list I don't even think we I don't even know if we even we've never seen that song we just sung and probably not probably hardly anything on that list to Be Sung tonight so if I don't know the words I'm sorry because I don't even know we were gonna sing them so it's fresh every time we're fresh we're like we're like a dog chasing a rabbit what the hottest Trail would go down [Music] we hear about the wars there's questions in the little children's eyes trouble in the East again the whole world is shaking with no ship place to stand there are mournful sounds that are heard throughout the land [Music] here's what I'm listening for but I keep listening for a different sound the sound of the city that Johnson coming down the sound of the Bride being united with the lamb I keep listening I keep listening I keep listening for a different sound I remembered the preacher saying it shall come to pass that will come a generation that will be the last I can't believe we're standing here to see the end of time and that preacher's voice it's set going in my mind [Music] [Music] coming down the sound of the Bride being united with the lamb so I keep listening I keep listening I keep listening for a difference [Music] being united with the lamb sound of a chorus Singing Glory to the lamb I keep listening I keep listening I keep listening I keep listening I'll tell you what since the last time we were here I've gained about 30 pounds and uh where are we anyway and you know what uh actually when I was here last time I had a full head of hair I mean it was black and looked good and fixed and so now uh that's not the case anymore and tell me you were here last time you had a full head of hair it was black it was black you know Just For Men it's keeping it black but I'm glad he's he's here tonight would you make Tim welcome praise God Tim has been singing with us well he started on 15 he's been singing with us for all these years and he's a great blessing to us if we need it fixed we caught him but I'll tell you what he's got a lovely wife and two children and he made a great sacrifice to fly in to be with us so we sure appreciate that also um this guy standing right beside him he was running around chasing dogs and cats last time we was here but now he's married he got three kids got a lovely wife into his name is Caleb Caleb not only does Caleb sing but Caleb's rights and he's got some great songs you're going to enjoy his singing tonight would you make Caleb welcome [Applause] praise God and I've waited for the last one to introduce her because uh I was 12 years old we were singing in a little town called Calhoun George anybody ever heard of Calhoun it's just a bump in the road and I was only 12 and we pulled Our Big Bus who was traveling full time with my family then we pulled up beside this church by railroad tracks and I tell you what our bus was longer than the church and that's the truth and we got all set up and I went back to the bus and got dressed and came back in and I said how did I miss that it's just sitting on the back row all by herself the hair way down to their knees big brown beautiful eyes I didn't know her from nobody but I said I'm gonna marry her one day that's the truth six years later she came to Tennessee and asked me to marry and I said yes that's not how it happened but we didn't get married and we're celebrating 45 years of marriage [Applause] now I'll tell you what folks a lot of like brother John said a lot of waters went under the bridge and when it comes to heartache pain and trials she's had a double portion in her life I don't know very many people that would have a blood transfusion on Thursday this Thursday check out the hospital drive all the way to Dayton and we drove the rest away yesterday and she's here to sing for you tonight could you give her one more one for tonight so we're way off of the program so we're just going to do what we're going to do [Music] [Applause] [Music] I've been wandering through a Barren land [Music] I've been looking for water or just a place where water's been if I could see a stream where the water once flowed it'll take me to a place I've long to go beneath those old Pines everything will be mine and I will be home home I can see home from here I can see the lights so clear been a lot of miles looking behind a whole lot of tears that burn me blind we're almost to them end of the road get more homesick the further I go I can see the signs it's going home time I keep looking for my Chariot ride getting more anxious to step one foot on the other side the darker the world gets the brighter I see this old world don't have a hold on me in a moment's time I'll leave it behind and I will be home I can see home from here I can see the lights so clear been a lot of miles looking behind a whole lot of tears that burn me blind we're almost to them end of the road get more homesick the further I go I can see the signs oh it's going home time home I can see home from here I can see the lights so clear been a lot of miles looking behind a whole lot of tears that burn me blind we're almost to them end of the road get more homesick the farther I go I can see the size oh it's going home time I can see hope I see praise God Amen aren't you glad we're just about home I'll tell you what I'm already feeling good they sounded awfully good over Kitty and Isaac you don't want to take folkson I can't say enough about these two guys uh actually they are lafontained you know the lafontains everybody in the world knows a lot contains and they're the real deal now I appreciate them coming and playing some country gospel with us actually I think they sound better with us and do the Laughing tanks what about y'all so you're hired uh John Paul you hope you're not listening but I tell you what we really appreciate it would you have Kenny and I'll ask a big hand tonight and uh Kenny's Kevin up all of my mistakes you see I don't I I can't read music not a note and so I'll play Everything by ear and so I'll just go all over the keyboard somebody says why don't you just stay in one spot and sit there going all the well I just hit everything that feels good to me and so anyway I want to sing this song it's an old song and uh you know what we've dug some of these songs we'll sing some new songs we'll sing some old songs but what we're going to do is send a telegram to your soul that God still loves you he's got everything under control whatever song we sing tonight I hope you get that message this song says my heart's already gone and we sung in about the last time it was here 24 years ago so we dug this out of their archives we'll start in uh B uh is it good the good anyway I'll play in bed y'all play whatever key I want to play [Music] foreign [Music] you're saying that it won't be long but long I've carried these troubles and trials yet today I'm just as strong I'm not worried about tomorrow if I'll ever make it to the throne cause God don't take just part of a man and my heart's already gone [Music] I can't wait for the living days nothing here satisfies it's just a few more days to sing his brains and we're going down [Music] somebody say Amen [Music] some folks are laying up Treasures they're getting all that money can buy they're getting into still watch it for you see every man born must die I'm not taking nothing with me I think this world is not mine Treasures are waiting on the other side where my heart's all ready gone I've been laid [Music] late I am by now I can't wait for my living date nothing here satisfies there's just a few more days to sing is praise and we're gonna go together what you see is just a part of me cause my heart's already all right [Music] [Applause] we want to sing Caleb I want Caleb to come and we're going to sing a song that he wrote every time I hear this song it just moves me because if God knows when a sparrow Falls and he does how much more does he know about your problem tonight if it greets him when a little bird falls out of the sky how much more valuable are you him to him tonight he knows all about what you're going through you may wear a big smile and inside just be breaking all apart but God knows and he loves you he loves the sparrow just think if he loves a sparrow that much how much more does he love you God's good to see brother Samuels God bless you let's give them a big hand would you just a patriarch of a mess [Applause] [Music] the mind is such a Battleground and soldiers laws need to be found you stumbled and you dropped your sword you feel that you have failed the Lord tears are streaming down your soul your true desires to be whole but you ain't you wait take no thought in what you say it's not you speak in any way the spirit of life within is rising up to combat sin so let the master take control to reach out to An Empty Soul Don't Wait Don't Wait For he knows when the sparrow Falls and how much more to him you are there's rips and tears from when you fell but his focus is that this world may bring we will remind you of Earthly things would you remember [Music] [Applause] see there comes a fork in life's Road where there's two men standing both alone one offers Earthly things the pleasures that this world can bring have what you want today and there'll be no price to pay but you wait for there's passion in the other's eyes to crosses laying by his side the character in his countenant shines from in your heart is Mercy binds everything that sets you down you feel again that you've been found always don't wait he beckons you his way for he knows when the sparrow Falls how much more to him you are there's rips and tears from when you fail but his focus is that this world will bring will remind you of Earthly things but you remember you're a child of the king for he knows when the sparrow Falls how much more to him you are the strips and tears and when you fell put his focus is behind the veil and the Sorrows that this world will bring we will remind you of Earthly things but you remember you're a child of the king oh your child of the king each other [Music] we wrote a song of kind of unusual song and it's the title of our latest CD uh you know folks uh When the Children visit across the Red Sea they had the right song but there's a little wrong side you see they should have been praising and dancing God when they came down to the river just to think of all that God had led them through all the plagues he put on pharaoh to get him out of there all the Miracles she performed but they waited till they got to the other side to worship God when you come down and there is power and just as there's healing and praise when you come down to a trial just start praising God right then that's the time to praise God and you know what just watch the clouds the sea will part back for you I wrote a song called singing in the rain and you put your hands together we may fumble fumble through the words but we'll start in the key of one two three what key is that I think it's a we'll start in a and we'll just move on up to the the I will keep singing until we get the right kid all right Singing in the Rain how many is ever sung in Trials this is all about that [Music] forecast might be the same but I'll lift my voice in sing in the rain sing it with us [Music] yelling through my pain [Music] to complain it's been days since the sun has shown I've never been alone tomorrow's forecast might be the same I'll let my voice and sing in the rain I don't know why I feel so bad when everything seems to go so bad because it's not like I haven't seen clouds before but the next time my trouble comes my way I wanna lift my voice you'll hear me say I've learned in everything to praise the Lord [Music] Singing in the Rain [Music] smiling through my pain [Music] it's been days since the sun is shown I've never been alone tomorrow's forecasts might be the same but I'll let my voice and sing in the rain when the children of Israel cross the sea they were shouting and dancing for victory they should have danced when they came down to the shore after all that they had seen God do they should have known he would see them through while I wait to the victory side to praise the Lord I don't know what tomorrow may bring but I know who knows everything he says he's working all things for my good so one drop two drops let it Pour I'm gonna stand right here praising more rain or shine I'm gonna praise the Lord she sit in the rain sing it with us smile into my pain [Music] it's been days since the Sun and sun is might be the same but I'll lift my voice in sing in the rain smiling through my pain [Music] might be the same but I lift my voice [Applause] that is that is hot Singing in the Rain you know we sing some of these songs that uh some of these older songs we sing I told the boys are there son you can't expect me to play that song in the same key I did 30 years ago and they said yeah Dad you can so I put Tim on how I know he said that's too high I said no it's not you can sit here that's slow let's loaded this song here I wrote this song One Day many years ago Vicki went to the doctor we hadn't been married too long maybe 10 15 years is that a long time but we've been married a while I guess but I she went to the doctor and the doctor said we found a lump in your breast and they wanted to take it out and so that was on uh during the week we went to the church on the weekend just got got it took care of the preacher played hands on her went back to the doctor the next week to get ready to take the X-ray again and the lump was gone let's say that now you know what it always don't happen like that sometimes you may pray and pray and pray like Daniel did Daniel Prayed for 21 days he thought God then forgot about him but God said Daniel the first time you started praying I sent the angel your way now the Prince of Persia tried to block him he just sent Michael and his prayer came through you might be there tonight you might be thinking man God has just not forgotten about me he's already sent the answer your way we're gonna sing this song and it's going to be high for me so I'm gonna drop it in a flat so it'll be D how y'all liking all these keychains I was just thinking man what keys you want to do next but this song is called there's power in prayer when a child of God falls on his knees and begins to pray the devil goes into a nervous fit there is power in prayer [Music] [Music] oh Daniel turned his head and prayed but no answer came for 21 days he thought that God I heard his servants pray in there but an angel sent from God that same day but the Prince of Darkness stood in his way the angel overthrew him I can hear Daniel say there's power and prayers there's power in prayers he Caleb if you believe he's all that you need there's power and praise he's a God that don't fail when you are down so cast all your cares on him cause I found he can take a heartache somebody shout hallelujah praise God foreign but no answer came my days turned to weeks my Greeks turned to pain and I cried oh Lord it seemed that you haven't heard my prayer here's what I like but God said I said our first time you call but Satan tried to block your answer to stall reinforcement's been made Satan's had to withdraw there's power in prayer there is power in prayer if you believe that you're not there for you to receive the problems [Music] he's a God that don't fail that's right when you are down cast all your cares on him cause I found he will take a heartache foreign and I fit my notes better but I I know it probably might have looked better I don't know y'all look pretty good tonight but I'll tell you I've never felt any better I never felt the love of God as much as I feel in this place done I I drop this let's see what key was in let's go back to D [Music] problem you're facing tonight I want you to know this I prayed and prayed but no answer King my days turn to weeks my grief turn to pain you ever been there and I cried Lord it seemed that you haven't heard my prayer oh here's the good news but God said I heard the first time you call but Satan tried to block your answer to Soul reinforcement's been made Satan's had to withdraw there's power somebody say praise the Lord sing it Caleb there's power in prayer if you believe [Music] he's all that you need there's power in Praise when you get down to cast all your cares on him cause I found he would take your heartache and turn it around I pray [Music] [Applause] God we'll sing a song I don't think we've ever sung this song publicly they're going on no no we recorded it but it's just to put it on the album you know like because we just I like the song and they let they let I wrote it so they said okay let's put it on them so but you know what several people like this song I Like It okay we can't even sing the song from practice Yeah well we're going to sing this because I want to sing it in the god hasten today when we'll be called away now I got a handkerchief here are y'all hot I'm a sweater but I won't tell you this no problem uh if I could lose about 25 pounds I'd still sweat because I'm just a sweat but I want to sing this song God hasten today and then we'll be caught away you look around the world today you just wonder how in the world is we are we still here that's right how in the world is things keep going I tell you we're one day closer Home than we've ever been before this song says God hasten the day I think we're gonna do this in the normal key [Music] some days my faith seems so strong and it's easy to believe leave all the promises you've made I'm blessed more than I can receive and then there's days that seem so long and life gets the best of me so here I am alone calling out on being dead [Music] when will be called away when time on Earth is through he's coming back for me and you know he's never land sometimes it seems so hard to wait wait for the clouds to roll away [Music] today [Music] are you ready for him to come back oh yes foreign gets crazier each day that's the truth sometimes I feel so out of place and my friends can't understand they say you need to get away oh yes I like this part here it's true I'd like to get away go spend one Eternal day and never return to this whole place on the day God hates on the day when we'll be called away when time on Earth see I know he's never left sometimes it seems so hard to wake up waiting on the clouds to roll away [Music] [Applause] with my time on Earth [Applause] okay God hey son the day [Music] great you believe he can do it again you may be down and feel like God somehow forgotten you are faced with circumstances that you can't get through right now it seems so well there's no way out your going under oh yes but God's proven time and time care ers oh he'll do it again he'll do it again if you'll just take a look at where you are now and where you've been hasn't he always come through for you he's the same God as then God has changed God knows the things you're going through he knows how you're hurting [Music] and he knows just how your heart has been broken into see he's the god of the Stars the god of the seas he is your father he'll calm that storm and he'll find a way [Applause] he'll do it again he'll do it again [Applause] [Music] where you've been hasn't he always come through for you he's the same God as this but he'll do it again yes [Applause] it came a long ways to be here and I tell you what we start singing and you start acting like you're acting we'll sing all night how long you got what times y'all's church start tomorrow I'm just kidding but we want to do a Melody for you uh when I talked to Brother Martin he give me a list of songs and wanted to sing and so well you did you really really truly did go in the archives and pull some of these songs out but here's a little group of songs that I think so you'll recognize some of them and we're going to start and uh what do you want to say it'll be a key we'll start in a key yeah the key I got to sit here we'll start in um I started in d d this is this is the first song that I ever wrote that uh was recorded by everybody or anybody ever heard of the Paris Paris no uh the cooks okay we are we're way way you've probably not heard of the cook said oh yeah okay and then uh the singing nickel several groups recorded this song and that's how it all got started so we're gonna walk you through some of the probably the most recognizable songs and when we come to the song you know you sing along with us okay now if nobody sings I hope you hope somebody sings we're starting in the key of D let's flatten that [Music] [Music] you need to control one day with the master just him and the Lord alone they got so close to the borders of Heaven that God just took him on home he keeps leading me home dancing for the throne no time to slow down she will be home he keeps leading me [Music] he keeps leading me [Music] the handwriting's on the wall can't you see it the message tells the story again today [Music] don't be waiting the balance if I want it don't turn down that's true true [Music] [Music] [Music] and there's no way to erase it no way to do it the handwriting writings on the wall again today foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] someday we'll leave behind us this way no more somewhere it's called the sweet voice [Music] [Music] there has to be a reason for the changing of the season and every living thing we see that grows [Music] but don't grow old things there has to come that child that will try the very hard and test all there has to be a reason and in God's Own time and season you tell us why it's so much [Applause] and every living thing we see that grows there has to be a reason why Little Children Are Born but don't go home there has to come that trial oh yes that will try the very hard and test your soul [Music] oh there has to be a reason and in God's Own time and season [Music] he'll tell us why it's so Caleb why am I so homesick for I'm not myself here anymore I'm looking for an open door that leads to that list so let's try these weeping eyes and lift our heads to warn the skies farewell to this world goodbye I'm going to do this [Applause] [Music] on that Shore there is [Music] some far off distance but I'll speed up thank God and they'll slow down there is we're gonna drop the music way back and I want to hear you sing that with us there's a land there is [Music] [Music] there is [Music] miles away down there is we're going to sing one more song and then uh Sherry is not here so Isaac's gonna sing his name Kimmy I know Kenny sings so but we want to sing one more song get this song here when I wrote it I never realized the impact it would have not only on other folks lives but on my own life sometimes you gotta live the song before you know but I tell you what the Bible said man this morning there's few days are full of trouble so it doesn't matter who you are what status you have in life trouble is coming your way but I'm glad we found the answer tonight let the sun bless your heart [Music] I just came into a valley one like I've never seen before I keep searching for a way out seems like there's padlocks upon the doors oh must be another sunrise sunset Sunset that I'll see God will make this trial a blessing foreign [Music] [Music] I was not the first man to come into this place you see every child of God he has a test that he must face but it is here that God will moan you and make you what you ought to be God will make your trial a blessing just be patient you will see oh God will make this trial a blessing don't
