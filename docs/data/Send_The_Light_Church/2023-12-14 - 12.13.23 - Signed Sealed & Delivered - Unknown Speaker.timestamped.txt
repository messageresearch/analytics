[39:11] um dictionary tells us it's a device or
[39:15] substance that's used to join two things
[39:17] together as to prevent them from coming
[39:21] apart or to prevent anything from
[39:24] passing between them amen our our
[39:28] vehicles that we drove here has seals in
[39:30] them amen uh but this word sealed in
[39:34] this verse means to stamp with a signate
[39:39] or a private
[39:41] Mark for security or
[39:45] perservation by implication to keep a
[39:48] secret to attest to set a stop now
[39:51] that's what it means and of course when
[39:54] God seals us it's a a private Mark it's
[39:59] the he's the one that's puts the stamp
[40:02] on it amen and we're just for him
[40:06] amen now often uh seals just in life are
[40:11] required by the state or federal laws
[40:14] and even some corporations uh require uh
[40:18] a seal and if you've ever had any a
[40:21] notary republic had a need for that that
[40:24] they have to be present when you're
[40:26] signing something and so they can put a
[40:28] seal on it that it every everything they
[40:31] have to make sure all the papers are in
[40:33] order and then they can uh e execute a
[40:37] final uh stamp or or seal and sometimes
[40:41] uh we've been asked to provide our birth
[40:44] certificates uh or marriage license to
[40:47] get things you ever have to do that you
[40:49] know where you should be saying amen
[40:51] these are not hard hard things uh but
[40:54] there are times that when and they ask
[40:57] for these things that they cannot use a
[41:01] copy they need an original with a
[41:04] original seal upon
[41:06] it and I'm sure if you've ever bought
[41:09] property or house you know how many
[41:11] there's a lot of documents that you have
[41:13] to go through amen and there there must
[41:15] be a clear abstract of the the title de
[41:19] before we can ever receive um uh a clear
[41:23] deed to be handed over to us to say it's
[41:25] ours now
[41:26] and when it is then they can put a seal
[41:30] of uh aity a authenticity yes one of
[41:36] those seals on there saying that it is
[41:38] good to go and uh a seal it brings a a
[41:43] certificate uh to the documents that
[41:46] everything is guaranteed and is in order
[41:49] amen now court of law sometimes will
[41:52] actually seal up certain documents that
[41:56] contains sensitive
[41:58] information uh they call it classified
[42:01] and when God you know covers Us with the
[42:04] blood it just it seals up amen and and
[42:08] our sins are put in the in the SE forget
[42:10] from us we they can't even be brought up
[42:13] anymore right amen and uh even though
[42:16] the devil you know he remembers them and
[42:18] he tries to you know bring them to our
[42:20] our thoughts but we must remembered that
[42:24] God can't even remember them it's sealed
[42:27] amen the Bible says that the foundation
[42:30] standeth sure having this seal the
[42:34] foundation of God s Sure having this
[42:36] seal it's a seal the Lord knoweth them
[42:40] that are his amen it's a seal God just
[42:43] knows you don't ever have to wonder if
[42:46] God knows that you belong to him he
[42:48] knows in fact Jesus said all that the
[42:51] father has given me will come and I'll
[42:54] lose nothing right
[42:57] so if you belong to God God knows about
[42:59] it don't worry about it amen now God
[43:03] literally puts a spiritual seal upon
[43:07] believers who have all their spiritual
[43:10] documents in
[43:14] order in other words they have applied
[43:17] the word of God to their lives amen not
[43:20] just some of the word not just most of
[43:23] the word but man shall live by every
[43:26] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[43:29] God now we know a man can have some of
[43:33] his documents in order but not have all
[43:36] of them in
[43:39] order in other words a man can be
[43:41] justified completely have a signed
[43:44] document wrot in the blood of Jesus
[43:46] Christ this man is Justified as if he
[43:49] never done it and still not have his
[43:52] sanctification documents in order right
[43:56] man can be justified and Sanctified in
[44:00] the sight of God and still be waiting
[44:03] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:06] amen amen and I'll just say like this we
[44:10] all should be saying Amen to the
[44:12] Scripture it just say I receive it
[44:16] Lord a man can can have the baptism of
[44:20] the Holy Ghost every hour in his life on
[44:23] the outside Realms and still miss it
[44:25] that's right
[44:26] amen that's in the in the message
[44:29] leadership a man can have the Holy Ghost
[44:32] working in his
[44:33] life and still be waiting for the Seal
[44:38] of the Holy
[44:39] Ghost so I'm trying to bring a
[44:42] distinction to the
[44:48] seal not only that but a man can be
[44:50] saved and Justified and he can still
[44:53] lose his salvation
[44:58] so you can be justified Sanctified still
[45:01] waiting for the seal but you can also be
[45:05] justified and Sanctified and you can
[45:08] lose your
[45:10] salvation I know this is
[45:13] strong but
[45:16] look we've got to stay with the
[45:19] scriptures Revelations 3:5 says our
[45:22] names can be blotted out of The Book of
[45:24] Life
[45:29] so we need to go on and get the seal
[45:32] because it's only the seal that holds us
[45:34] to the day of redemption amen so I
[45:37] believe in eternal security but I
[45:39] believe you need to be sealed to have
[45:41] that right
[45:45] amen now remember before God ever seals
[45:48] anyone he has to make sure he does make
[45:51] sure that everything is in order that
[45:54] this person has met all the scriptural
[45:57] requirements amen the Bible says he
[45:59] gives the Holy Ghost to them that obeys
[46:01] him right so he's the one that
[46:04] determines whether we've obeyed him
[46:08] enough I don't you don't he does it's up
[46:11] to us to say
[46:13] Lord have
[46:15] I have I done everything that you've
[46:17] asked me to do is there anything more
[46:19] you want me to do because it's in that
[46:21] process of Lord here's my heart I want
[46:23] to please you more that that God is able
[46:26] to to to reveal to you what he wants you
[46:29] to do next and this is vital because if
[46:31] we don't go on to get the seal we're not
[46:34] going to make a Rapture amen amen
[46:40] amen we he makes sure that all the
[46:42] worldliness is out of us that the old
[46:45] Nature's been stripped away and that a
[46:48] man has died to himself
[46:54] G Brenham said in the message the breach
[46:58] between the seven Church ages and the
[46:59] Seven Seals he says now you just went to
[47:02] the borderline and come back you're
[47:04] still lusting for the things of the
[47:06] world you never went all the way over
[47:09] into
[47:10] Canaan you see across Jordan which is
[47:14] death to South amen remember the
[47:18] children of Israel that came out of
[47:19] Egypt they went so far with God but they
[47:22] were afraid to go all the way because in
[47:25] honest they were afraid of losing their
[47:27] life and what happens to most Christians
[47:28] that don't go all the way they're afraid
[47:30] they don't want to give up their will
[47:33] right they're afraid to give up their
[47:35] will they're afraid of the Giants what's
[47:37] going to happen if I can't do what I
[47:38] want to do anymore in my
[47:41] life in the message the law having a
[47:44] shadow brother Brandon says for you're
[47:46] sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day
[47:48] of
[47:50] redemption and you are dead amen and
[47:55] your life life is hid in God through
[47:58] Christ and sealed there by the Holy
[48:01] Ghost now that's all one
[48:02] sentence I love it and the next sentence
[48:05] only two sentences this quote he said
[48:08] your destination is determined right
[48:11] then when you are sealed by the Holy
[48:15] Ghost this is this is to me can be
[48:18] confusing because we know that we've
[48:21] been predestined from the foundation of
[48:23] the world right right but he says here
[48:26] your destination is determined right
[48:29] there Then when you're sealed by the
[48:32] Holy
[48:35] Ghost so what's what is God getting
[48:39] across to
[48:41] us
[48:44] that we shouldn't just go by a a a
[48:48] understanding or a mental belief that
[48:51] we've been
[48:52] predestinated and we know where we're
[48:55] going
[48:59] right God does not want us to determine
[49:02] our
[49:04] destination until we've received the
[49:08] Seal of the Holy Ghost amen and then
[49:10] that
[49:11] itself is the proof of where you're
[49:14] going right come on we don't want to sit
[49:18] here and try to you know make well
[49:21] because we're in the message we're going
[49:23] and because they're not in the message
[49:24] they're not going no we have scripture
[49:27] the scripture says when we're sealed
[49:29] then we know we're going amen so we stay
[49:32] with the
[49:33] word don't leave the word because Satan
[49:36] wants us to get us to
[49:39] reason bam talked about a train
[49:42] inspector how he had to inspect every
[49:45] box card to make sure that everything
[49:47] was in order before he sealed it you
[49:50] remember that amen and the seal could
[49:53] not be broken until it reached it its
[49:55] final
[49:56] destination either can the seal be
[50:00] broken if God seals us it can't be
[50:03] broken this ought to make us the
[50:05] happiest people on the
[50:09] planet in the message Jehovah jbra
[50:12] brother BR says before a car can be
[50:13] sealed a box car just everything has got
[50:16] to fit in their good and
[50:21] tight that's the reason so many don't
[50:24] get the Holy Ghost because they're too
[50:29] loose think about
[50:33] that I'm sure most of you remember in
[50:36] January 28th of 1986 the
[50:39] Challenger broke apart just 73 seconds
[50:43] after it took
[50:46] off and all seven of the crew Men lost
[50:49] their life
[50:52] because of a faulty seal right
[50:59] amen and I'll tell you I think there's a
[51:01] lot of people who think they're
[51:06] sealed but if you don't get the seal
[51:09] you're going through
[51:10] tribulation amen the seal is the only
[51:14] thing that's going to bypass tribulation
[51:16] it's not being in the message it's not
[51:19] knowing god son a prophet right it's not
[51:23] whatever you want to fill in the blank
[51:24] there is only one thing that can fill in
[51:26] the blank and the Bible says You must be
[51:28] sealed with the Holy Ghost amen that is
[51:31] the only thing amen amen because if
[51:34] there was an easier way we would all
[51:35] take the easier way but there
[51:38] isn't God identifies us here on this
[51:42] side before the other
[51:45] side I cannot emphasize how important it
[51:48] is to keep moving on and receive more
[51:51] and more of the Holy Ghost don't settle
[51:53] for what you have that's right become
[51:57] sost that's right hungry thirsty
[52:02] inoculated with the Holy Ghost that
[52:05] nothing but God comes out amen amen amen
[52:10] we're not automatically sealed with the
[52:13] Holy Ghost when we're serving the lord
[52:15] that's not what sealed
[52:17] means we get too too comfortable with
[52:20] how much of God we
[52:22] got and when we look at somebody that
[52:25] you know maybe doesn't have as much as
[52:26] we have we feel okay but that is the
[52:30] worst
[52:32] thing if if there if there isn't a
[52:34] Hunger for More that's the first thing
[52:36] you need to deal with
[52:40] Amen in the message Jehovah Gyra brother
[52:43] B says brother that's the only way that
[52:46] God ever makes you a Seed of Abraham
[52:49] ever makes you a Seed of Abraham I
[52:52] thought we when the spirit of Christ
[52:55] comes into you then you become a Seed of
[53:04] Abraham now it's just just as pure and
[53:07] right is the Bible tells us that by
[53:10] faith we're children of Abraham through
[53:12] faith we're children of
[53:14] Abraham well it's when you
[53:18] believe but this belief is is not just I
[53:23] believe but it's when God comes and he
[53:27] testifies of your faith right by giving
[53:30] you his Spirit into your
[53:33] life
[53:35] amen the way that brother random
[53:37] expressed it is that when we get
[53:39] baptized that's us saying I accept you
[53:42] Lord right but it's not until God fills
[53:46] you with the Holy Ghost that he's saying
[53:47] to you I accept
[53:49] you into the bride Genesis 15:6 says and
[53:54] Abraham believed believed in the Lord
[53:56] and he counted it to him for
[53:59] righteousness that's
[54:01] right amen so Abraham had faith and his
[54:05] faith Justified him amen but I want to
[54:08] say it like this his faith was not made
[54:11] perfect until he offered up
[54:15] Isaac and that was many years
[54:19] different are you with me okay we're
[54:22] going to prove that James chapter 2 ver
[54:24] 2 says but will thou man will thou know
[54:27] oh vain man that faith without works is
[54:30] dead was not Abraham Our Father
[54:33] justified by works when he offered up
[54:35] Isaac his son upon the
[54:37] altar see thou how Faith wrought his
[54:40] works and by works his faith was made
[54:43] perfect so amen we see before he even
[54:47] had Isaac he had faith and he was
[54:50] justified before God but it wasn't until
[54:55] his faith turned into Works down the
[54:58] road that God said okay it's
[55:02] perfect are you with me verse
[55:05] 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which
[55:09] sayith Abraham believed God and it was
[55:11] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[55:14] he was called the friend of God you see
[55:17] then how that by works a man is
[55:20] Justified and not by faith only right
[55:25] you know I'm so glad for all the
[55:28] word it's hard to get a good
[55:30] understanding if you're only looking at
[55:32] part of the word you need the whole word
[55:36] right now we know that Abraham obviously
[55:39] believed in
[55:41] God at at age 75 when he was called out
[55:45] of the earth of the chales is that right
[55:47] amen and Abraham was probably in his
[55:51] 80s when God said that his faith was
[55:54] counted unto him him for righteousness
[55:56] there in Genesis CH
[55:58] 15 and a little bit later in his age
[56:01] when he was 86 years old ishmail was
[56:05] born now Abraham didn't receive the sign
[56:08] or the
[56:09] Seal of circumcision until he was 99
[56:14] years old think about
[56:18] that and then the promise you talk about
[56:21] Standing on the Promises it was then
[56:23] that the promised son was manifested
[56:26] amen we're never going to manifest
[56:29] Christ completely until we are sealed
[56:32] with the Holy Ghost and it's Christ that
[56:35] has the preeminence in our lives
[56:42] amen we've got to go on we've got to go
[56:46] on
[56:48] Saints receive more of the Holy Ghost
[56:51] amen don't you determine you have enough
[56:54] don't do do that let God be the one that
[56:56] determines it you keep hungering you
[56:58] keep thirsting you keep saying Lord I
[57:01] need to manifest more of you I see it my
[57:03] life I see it my thoughts I see it my
[57:05] action I see it with my selfishness how
[57:08] I spend so much time just doing what I
[57:10] want to do you just be honest with God
[57:13] that's
[57:16] right Galatians chapter 3 verse 5
[57:20] says he therefore that miners to you the
[57:23] spirit and worketh miracles among you he
[57:28] asked the question doeth he by The Works
[57:32] of the law or by the hearing of
[57:38] faith God is working amongst us God does
[57:42] things in our lives we hear we've heard
[57:45] some testimonies and I'm so thankful for
[57:47] the testimonies that we're hearing so
[57:50] the question we could ask does does God
[57:53] is God doing that by The Works of the
[57:54] law or is he is he doing it by the
[57:57] hearing of
[57:58] Faith it's when God
[58:02] speaks right God speaks that's Faith
[58:08] amen amen even as Abraham believed God
[58:13] and it was accounted unto him for
[58:15] righteousness know ye therefore that
[58:18] they which are of
[58:21] Faith the same are the children of
[58:23] Abraham
[58:25] and the scripture foreseeing that God
[58:28] would justify the Heathen through faith
[58:30] preached before the uh preach before the
[58:33] gospel unto Abraham saying in thee shall
[58:36] All Nations be blessed so then they
[58:39] which be of Faith are blessed with
[58:41] faithful
[58:42] Abraham Bible says the just shall live
[58:44] by faith look at verse 14 that the
[58:47] blessing that the blessing this is such
[58:50] a powerful verse to me that the blessing
[58:52] of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
[58:56] through Jesus Christ that we might
[59:01] receive the promise of the spirit
[59:04] through faith
[59:09] amen God wanted Abraham to continue on
[59:14] yes he didn't say you know uh it was
[59:18] counted unto you for righteousness and
[59:20] you know everything's going to be okay
[59:22] you're going to be uh you're going to be
[59:24] a father many nations and you don't have
[59:25] to do anything
[59:28] more there were still
[59:31] more for 25 years he was being
[59:36] tried and somehow he had to get up in
[59:39] the morning as the prophet
[59:43] said anything yet to Sarah Sarah just
[59:47] kept making the booties getting ready
[59:50] for the sun to
[59:53] come and yet he went through the trial
[59:55] well maybe you know maybe I got to do
[59:57] this and maybe we got to do that maybe
[59:59] we got to help make this thing come to
[1:00:01] pass God don't need anything us to do
[1:00:04] except be obedient to the word and he
[1:00:06] will bring it to pass
[1:00:12] amen that's right when we get involved
[1:00:16] outside of the word of
[1:00:18] God trouble
[1:00:21] Calamity problems happen every time we
[1:00:24] triy to do something outside of the
[1:00:29] word Romans chapter
[1:00:32] 4:10 now was Abraham's Faith then
[1:00:36] reckoned how was Abraham's Faith then
[1:00:38] reckoned it's a question when he was in
[1:00:42] circumcision or in
[1:00:48] uncircumcision not in
[1:00:50] circumcision but in
[1:00:53] uncircumcision
[1:00:55] so Abraham's Faith was reckoned before
[1:00:59] he ever received the Seal of
[1:01:04] circumcision just like our faith can be
[1:01:06] reckoned before God before we ever
[1:01:09] receive the Seal of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:11] that's why we can be yet in our sins God
[1:01:14] come down and say I you belong to me you
[1:01:19] need to uh give up your life Surrender
[1:01:23] Your Life uh or or or you're going to
[1:01:26] miss it you're going to go to
[1:01:28] hell and at that point something happens
[1:01:32] yes there's a connection I belong to God
[1:01:34] something inside of me is bearing
[1:01:35] witness with this truth that I belong to
[1:01:38] God and I need to give my get my life
[1:01:40] straight I give my heart to God and it's
[1:01:42] at that time in your uncircumcision that
[1:01:45] God can justify you he can sanctify
[1:01:52] you it doesn't mean we've receive the
[1:01:54] Seal of the Holy
[1:01:57] Ghost anything in the Old Testament is a
[1:02:00] type to the New Testament this is what
[1:02:02] Abraham went
[1:02:05] through it's assigned to us and this is
[1:02:08] you know brother Brenham dealt with this
[1:02:09] with ministers during his
[1:02:13] time and I'm afraid that there's too
[1:02:15] many people that are stopping short of
[1:02:17] getting the seal the Holy Ghost and
[1:02:19] they're wondering what's going on and
[1:02:20] why it brings so much confusion in their
[1:02:23] lives
[1:02:26] there's more for us yes there's more for
[1:02:29] the people of God Amen let's not let a
[1:02:32] promise slip us let's go
[1:02:35] on Amen verse 11 and he received the
[1:02:40] sign of
[1:02:42] circumcision see it's a sign then he
[1:02:44] calls it a seal of righteousness of
[1:02:47] Faith which he had yet been
[1:02:49] uncircumcised that he might be the
[1:02:51] father of them all that believed though
[1:02:54] they be not
[1:02:56] circumcised that the righteousness might
[1:02:58] be imputed unto them also and the father
[1:03:01] of circumcision to them who are not of
[1:03:04] the circumcision only but this the
[1:03:06] Gentiles but who also walk in the
[1:03:09] steps of that Faith of Our Father
[1:03:12] Abraham which he had been yet
[1:03:16] uncircumcised so no matter where we're
[1:03:18] at we can take the first step and come
[1:03:21] into justification amen amen men for the
[1:03:25] promise that he should be heir of the
[1:03:27] world was not to Abraham or to his seed
[1:03:30] uh through the law but through the
[1:03:33] righteousness of Faith just believing
[1:03:36] that God provided a way for us okay
[1:03:38] verse 16 therefore it is of faith that
[1:03:41] it might be by grace to the end the
[1:03:44] promise might be sure to all the seed
[1:03:48] not to that only which is of the law but
[1:03:51] to them also which is of the faith of
[1:03:53] Abraham who's the father of us all the
[1:03:58] promise is sure to all the seed that's
[1:04:03] right and we must walk in the steps of
[1:04:06] Our Father
[1:04:08] Abraham the first step we take is in our
[1:04:12] uncircumcised State he will forgive us
[1:04:16] and he will justify us in that
[1:04:20] state of being uncircumcised he has to
[1:04:25] but the next step is a step of of Grace
[1:04:29] also and this is sanctification it's a
[1:04:33] step and that's where our nature becomes
[1:04:37] cleansed and we're set aside for the
[1:04:39] service of God where he can use us this
[1:04:42] is in the second step of Grace are you
[1:04:45] with me this is walking in the steps of
[1:04:48] our father abraam brother Bram actually
[1:04:49] goes through
[1:04:51] these the next step of Grace is
[1:04:53] receiving the the Holy
[1:04:56] Ghost I'm going to say this no matter
[1:04:58] how much Holy Ghost you've received
[1:05:00] don't stop seeking
[1:05:05] more you will on the other side you will
[1:05:08] never find one person there that made it
[1:05:11] in the Rapture that said you know I put
[1:05:13] the pedal to the metal too much and I
[1:05:15] was I didn't really have to seek all
[1:05:17] that but you will find many who miss it
[1:05:20] will say I wish I would have sought God
[1:05:23] more amen
[1:05:25] I wish I would have sought more of the
[1:05:26] Holy
[1:05:29] Ghost so don't stop
[1:05:34] seeking don't stop seeking until you
[1:05:37] know that you know that you know that
[1:05:38] you're sealed that's
[1:05:42] right all you just be honest all you got
[1:05:45] to do is look at your life and look at
[1:05:47] the times that the Satan has lied to you
[1:05:50] deceived you you thought you were right
[1:05:52] and found out you were wrong amen that's
[1:05:55] enough evidence to make me want to be
[1:05:59] sure are you with me I don't want to
[1:06:02] gamble on
[1:06:04] that I don't want to gamble on
[1:06:09] that I'd rather be seeking more of God
[1:06:14] am in the message the
[1:06:17] Masterpiece what a wonderful message
[1:06:20] brother man says now notice here the
[1:06:22] life that was in the
[1:06:25] in the stalk and in the
[1:06:28] tassel all gathers in the seed yes and
[1:06:34] the light that was in the stalk went one
[1:06:38] went into the other justification made
[1:06:40] way for sanctification sanctification
[1:06:43] made way for the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:45] Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made
[1:06:49] a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come
[1:06:53] right down in into Perfection amen back
[1:06:56] to the word again Amen to manifest
[1:07:00] itself amen see why the whole world is
[1:07:03] just looking at Calvary and saying Lord
[1:07:05] thank you for Calvary thank you for
[1:07:07] dying for me thank you for saving me
[1:07:09] that's all I need there's a bride that
[1:07:11] wants to manifest Jesus Christ amen amen
[1:07:15] that life comes back into her changes
[1:07:17] the nature All Things become of God
[1:07:22] Amen now when the Holy Ghost seals you
[1:07:27] you're sealed to the day of
[1:07:29] redemption that means God himself will
[1:07:32] not break the
[1:07:35] seal the seal that he's put on your life
[1:07:37] he will not break it his word is forever
[1:07:40] settled in heaven it will not return
[1:07:42] void if he said it cannot be broken it
[1:07:45] it won't be broken he won't break it no
[1:07:47] matter what you
[1:07:49] do because you will fall you will make
[1:07:51] mistakes right it's really good but the
[1:07:54] seal is there and it he won't break
[1:07:58] it there's not a human being in the
[1:08:00] world that can break that
[1:08:03] seal Jesus said no man can pluck you
[1:08:06] from the father's hand no hand no man
[1:08:08] can pluck you from my hand right that's
[1:08:11] what he said amen here's the big one the
[1:08:14] devil can't break the
[1:08:17] seal he'll try everything he can to get
[1:08:19] into your
[1:08:21] life brother bam said when you're sealed
[1:08:24] with the Holy Ghost the devil sealed
[1:08:28] out I like
[1:08:30] that so when he comes to your mind and
[1:08:33] he tries to torment you up here just
[1:08:36] remember there's a seal you don't have
[1:08:38] to listen to
[1:08:40] [Music]
[1:08:41] that St will try to steal your joy and
[1:08:44] steal your
[1:08:46] peace and if you let him in your mind he
[1:08:49] will do it
[1:08:51] right but the seal
[1:08:54] right keeps that stuff
[1:08:58] out come on the holy let me just say it
[1:09:01] like
[1:09:03] this the devil already got kicked out of
[1:09:07] heaven that means God didn't want him
[1:09:09] there doing any more stuff that he was
[1:09:11] doing he already
[1:09:14] disrupted if the Holy Ghost is in you
[1:09:17] sealed in you do you think he wants the
[1:09:19] devil coming in there
[1:09:22] no so when he comes to your mind you
[1:09:25] already matically know what God wants
[1:09:27] you to do
[1:09:31] amen and it's we're free more agencies
[1:09:34] now we're not robots it's a joint
[1:09:37] meeting you and God Have Become One amen
[1:09:40] don't expect God don't expect God to do
[1:09:44] what you can do and and God don't expect
[1:09:47] you to do what only he can
[1:09:51] do that's why we use the name of Jesus
[1:09:53] Jesus amen that's he has given his power
[1:09:57] right all power is given unto me and he
[1:09:59] gives his power over the
[1:10:00] enemy and when God is sealed in you
[1:10:03] don't have to listen to devil I don't
[1:10:05] care what he's
[1:10:07] saying just say you're sealed out in my
[1:10:10] life now when you fall and you
[1:10:14] will you can be a righteous man sealed
[1:10:17] with the Holy Ghost and
[1:10:20] fall but you'll get back up amen right
[1:10:24] you'll get back up amen that's a good
[1:10:28] indication where you're
[1:10:31] standing because the Holy Ghost Inside
[1:10:34] of You says don't stay
[1:10:37] down get back
[1:10:42] up now when the Holy Spirit is sealed
[1:10:45] inside you to the day of redemption that
[1:10:46] means everything that comes with the
[1:10:49] Holy Ghost is already inside of you so
[1:10:51] peace is inside of you Joy Bo is inside
[1:10:54] of you love is everything that is of god
[1:10:57] is in you when you receive the Seal of
[1:10:59] the Holy
[1:11:01] Ghost now that's how come we can see
[1:11:03] people sometimes you know sometimes
[1:11:05] they're on cloud nine they're praising
[1:11:08] and shouting and you know God is with me
[1:11:10] and and then the you know next week
[1:11:13] they're just down in the
[1:11:18] dumps when you're sealed you're
[1:11:22] sealed
[1:11:26] and I think we
[1:11:29] need to make sure we don't got any
[1:11:31] faulty
[1:11:32] seals we need to make sure we got a good
[1:11:36] seal
[1:11:37] amen
[1:11:39] um check everywhere hold yourself
[1:11:43] accountable let the Holy Ghost inside of
[1:11:45] you hold you
[1:11:47] accountable now when Satan starts
[1:11:49] flooding us with negativity The Living
[1:11:52] Word is going to stand up against it the
[1:11:54] Bible says when the enemy shall come in
[1:11:56] like a flood the spirit of the Lord
[1:11:58] shall raise up a standard against him
[1:12:00] amen well if the Holy Ghost is in you
[1:12:03] then you're going to raise up that
[1:12:06] standard you're not going to allow this
[1:12:08] enemy the enemy to come and just torment
[1:12:11] you with negativity and tell you that
[1:12:13] things are you know things aren't going
[1:12:15] to work out and things are bad and you
[1:12:17] know you might as well just quit and you
[1:12:19] know nobody's listening all that stuff
[1:12:23] is not of
[1:12:25] God it's not of
[1:12:27] God don't wait for God out here to
[1:12:30] change your
[1:12:31] circumstances that ain't the way he
[1:12:33] raises up a
[1:12:35] standard let me say it like this this
[1:12:38] man that said the wrong thing and
[1:12:44] died can you imagine every time we had a
[1:12:47] wrong thought what would happen to us if
[1:12:48] the grace of God wasn't
[1:12:52] there
[1:12:54] amen God is wanting to raise up the
[1:12:57] standard inside of us and say devil I'm
[1:13:00] not listening to you
[1:13:05] anymore the devil wants to try to break
[1:13:08] that
[1:13:10] seal if you're sealed the devil wants to
[1:13:13] break
[1:13:14] it he does look if he could talk to
[1:13:18] Jesus the way he
[1:13:22] did if if if he could do that to the
[1:13:27] Green Tree how much would he do that to
[1:13:28] the dry
[1:13:30] tree look the devil's out to destroy
[1:13:33] us and it's a real
[1:13:39] thing we just need to tell them I'm
[1:13:41] sealed to the day of redemption amen I I
[1:13:45] I'm I'm not turning back I'm going to
[1:13:48] press in all the more as I see the day
[1:13:50] approaching amen amen because that's
[1:13:52] what the word tells me to
[1:13:54] do the devil tries to get us to doubt
[1:13:57] question bring confusion unravel us but
[1:14:03] remember we're
[1:14:05] sealed that's right brother R remember
[1:14:08] we're sealed we've got to remember we're
[1:14:12] sealed we know where we
[1:14:14] stand brother bam said in the message
[1:14:16] the breach between the seven Church ages
[1:14:19] and the Seven Seals he said a seal
[1:14:22] signifies is a finished work amen a
[1:14:26] finished
[1:14:28] work and that only be done at the end
[1:14:32] time right to the day of redemption
[1:14:34] you're sealed to the day of redemption
[1:14:36] another thing is Seal signifies is
[1:14:39] ownership see the seal has a mark on it
[1:14:42] it shows
[1:14:43] ownership when you're bought by the
[1:14:46] blood of Jesus Christ and sealed by the
[1:14:48] Holy Ghost you no longer belong to the
[1:14:50] world or anything that pertained to the
[1:14:52] world you are owned by
[1:14:55] God another thing is a seal is
[1:15:01] security seal means that you are
[1:15:05] secure so we must receive the Seal of
[1:15:08] the Holy
[1:15:10] Ghost the Seal of the Holy Ghost is our
[1:15:13] token that the price has been
[1:15:17] paid we belong to God Amen we're secure
[1:15:21] now no most people accept
[1:15:24] Jesus uh Christ and what he did for them
[1:15:28] at Calvary they accept the blood because
[1:15:30] it washes away their sin and that's what
[1:15:32] every Christian Church
[1:15:34] preaches but the life that was in that
[1:15:38] blood hardly ever comes back upon the
[1:15:41] believer
[1:15:46] right because you've got to die out God
[1:15:50] is not going to come on you if you're
[1:15:51] not he's not going to share the throne
[1:15:53] room of your heart with
[1:15:59] selfishness it's like accepting the gift
[1:16:01] of God's love and sacrifice but they
[1:16:04] never want to accept the word that he
[1:16:06] spoke how can you accept
[1:16:09] Christ how can you accept Christ and not
[1:16:11] his word amen see so what they're doing
[1:16:14] is they're taking out a page of the
[1:16:15] Bible and says you know uh St John 3:16
[1:16:18] he died for me God love me that he died
[1:16:21] for me and I accept that
[1:16:24] but there's more to it than that
[1:16:26] amen but that's why so many people
[1:16:29] believe that but their life doesn't
[1:16:34] change if the Life of Christ doesn't
[1:16:36] come upon a
[1:16:39] person he's just a
[1:16:44] beast he's just a literal
[1:16:48] Beast
[1:16:52] right
[1:16:53] remember the Old Testament they killed
[1:16:55] an animal in the Old
[1:16:56] Testament to cover their sin didn't
[1:16:59] remit them but covered them brother
[1:17:02] brandham taught us it's because the
[1:17:03] light that was in that animal could not
[1:17:06] come upon the human right
[1:17:09] amen and if Christ Spirit doesn't come
[1:17:12] upon us we're just a beast to him I
[1:17:14] think the Bible calls it brute
[1:17:20] Beast an animal life cannot come
[1:17:26] upon a a a a a
[1:17:29] self-willed human
[1:17:34] being only the life of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:38] coming into a human heart can destroy a
[1:17:42] self
[1:17:45] willed
[1:17:47] nature and you got to be in unison with
[1:17:50] god with that you've got to say God I
[1:17:53] don't want my life what I want is you am
[1:17:56] where the majority of the church world
[1:17:57] that's confused they want God but they
[1:18:00] want their will that's the confusing
[1:18:03] thing and so they look for a church that
[1:18:06] fits them well they believe the way that
[1:18:08] I believe and you don't got to do this
[1:18:10] and you don't got to do that and you can
[1:18:12] do this and you can do that in
[1:18:14] church and so they really have taken
[1:18:17] their soul which is worth 10,000 world
[1:18:21] and they put it on a roulette t
[1:18:29] a knowing the terror of the lord it's
[1:18:32] our job to persuade
[1:18:42] men most people accept the sacrifice
[1:18:46] that Christ has done for them but they
[1:18:49] never go on to apply the blood to their
[1:18:52] life amen that's it they think that God
[1:18:55] has accepted them but their nature never
[1:18:56] changes so my question is has God really
[1:18:59] accepted
[1:19:01] them I do believe this that if someone
[1:19:04] truly repents they accept Christ as
[1:19:07] their savior in two seconds later they
[1:19:09] die they're gone
[1:19:12] amen but if they God gives them more
[1:19:15] time to prove how much they're they've
[1:19:19] repented how much theyve want to turn
[1:19:22] their life around
[1:19:23] and they don't choose to walk in the
[1:19:25] light the scripture says the blood of
[1:19:27] Jesus Christ will not cleanse
[1:19:29] you that's what the Bible
[1:19:32] says when we walk in the light as he is
[1:19:35] in the light then the blood of Jesus
[1:19:36] Christ cleanses us from all our sins so
[1:19:40] this is a real serious situation amen
[1:19:43] God requires his life to come and live
[1:19:46] back inside of us amen it's a
[1:19:48] requirement he said when I see the blood
[1:19:50] I'll pass over you and it's a
[1:19:53] requirement today when God sees the
[1:19:56] spiritual Life of Christ coming back and
[1:19:59] living inside then he will pass over us
[1:20:02] what does that mean we don't have to go
[1:20:03] through tribulation that's what that
[1:20:05] means we don't have to stand before him
[1:20:07] on the on the
[1:20:10] Judgment the token is the Life of
[1:20:13] Christ in a human being amen it's a sign
[1:20:17] that the blood has been applied to our
[1:20:19] personal life brother Braham said it
[1:20:21] this token must must be on displayed for
[1:20:24] everyone to see right and he said be
[1:20:28] sure the token is
[1:20:31] showing so this thing about being
[1:20:33] personal God knows my
[1:20:37] heart no it needs to be on display right
[1:20:41] in the message the token brother B asked
[1:20:43] the question what is a
[1:20:45] token he said the token is a sign of a
[1:20:48] debt been paid a price required has has
[1:20:52] been paid the price of our Salvation was
[1:20:56] death see and no one could pay it but
[1:20:59] Christ
[1:21:01] amen so my question to you is how do you
[1:21:05] know your debt has been
[1:21:09] paid how do you know that your personal
[1:21:12] debt has been
[1:21:19] paid the Bible I believe that with a
[1:21:22] Bible question there's got to be a Bible
[1:21:24] answer right all right the only way we
[1:21:28] can
[1:21:29] know is if the Life of Christ comes back
[1:21:32] upon
[1:21:33] us that's the only
[1:21:39] way how many believe that how many
[1:21:42] struggling with that
[1:21:48] one well remember when we accept Christ
[1:21:52] is our savior that's us our faith in God
[1:21:55] we're accepting Christ but it's not
[1:21:57] until he gives us the holy ghost that
[1:21:59] Christ has accepted us
[1:22:02] amen so am I saying that if you don't
[1:22:06] get the Holy Ghost you're going to hell
[1:22:09] that is not what I'm
[1:22:10] saying I'm saying you will stand before
[1:22:13] God in
[1:22:14] judgment after going through tribulation
[1:22:17] if your alive and you will plead your
[1:22:19] cause and you'll be between you and God
[1:22:22] at that time you'll never be able to
[1:22:23] call your best friend your best pastor
[1:22:25] your most Spirit person who spiritually
[1:22:28] counseled you to come and help you at
[1:22:30] that time it's going to be between you
[1:22:31] and God but if you want the assurance
[1:22:34] that you will make it you must receive
[1:22:36] the Life of Christ
[1:22:39] today that is the only way right in
[1:22:43] other words you've got to find his
[1:22:45] acceptance on this side of death not
[1:22:48] wait till you get on the other side and
[1:22:50] you can find it on this side
[1:22:53] when he comes and seals you with the
[1:22:55] Holy Ghost
[1:22:57] amen praise the
[1:22:59] Lord in the message desperation brother
[1:23:02] Bram said the token is the
[1:23:05] token that sound sounds like something I
[1:23:07] would
[1:23:08] say he said it's you and Christ as
[1:23:12] persons together see it's the Holy
[1:23:16] Spirit the life is in you working his
[1:23:21] own life through you right that's the
[1:23:25] token he said this
[1:23:28] morning the message this morning it was
[1:23:31] called the
[1:23:32] token he's saying this in the message
[1:23:34] desperation in the evening he said was
[1:23:38] to me the Highlight message of my entire
[1:23:41] Ministry and I know that everything has
[1:23:44] worked for months and months and months
[1:23:48] up to that one
[1:23:51] message moving up to come to that place
[1:23:55] that was the capping off time of it you
[1:23:58] see so I'm going to say here that
[1:24:00] whatever he's going to say has a lot of
[1:24:02] weight to it to
[1:24:04] me he says now I'm sure or hope that you
[1:24:07] got what the token meant see the token
[1:24:11] is the sign that the blood has been
[1:24:15] applied okay we I accept Jesus at
[1:24:17] Calvary okay everybody's saying that
[1:24:20] I've been born again everybody's saying
[1:24:21] that but the token is the proof that has
[1:24:26] been that you that that been
[1:24:29] applied without it you're just
[1:24:32] talking the token is a sign that the
[1:24:34] blood has been applied that the price
[1:24:36] that's been asked for required of God
[1:24:38] Jesus Paid the price by the shedding of
[1:24:40] his own blood he did that then from him
[1:24:43] from his life came the Holy Spirit and
[1:24:47] when the blood is applied to you the
[1:24:51] holy spirit is the to token that your
[1:24:54] that your price personal price is paid
[1:24:57] God has received you and that's the
[1:25:00] token yes
[1:25:02] amen so God
[1:25:05] vindicates us that we've been forgiven
[1:25:08] that we've been we've been accepted by
[1:25:13] him I love that God has given me
[1:25:17] time to seek more of him to get more of
[1:25:21] him in my life
[1:25:23] that he just didn't leave me in in a
[1:25:26] denominational Church which most of us
[1:25:28] probably
[1:25:29] were and and and with the thought
[1:25:32] process all is I got to do is accept
[1:25:34] John
[1:25:36] 3:16 and never know the person of Christ
[1:25:41] never know what he really wants out of
[1:25:51] me

[1:25:54] right God has received you and that's
[1:25:57] the token now remember that that is the

[1:26:18] Braham says and the Holy Ghost is our
[1:26:21] identification that's right it's what
[1:26:23] identifies us as
[1:26:25] Christians not our membership in our
[1:26:27] churches not our understanding of the
[1:26:30] Bible not how much we know about the
[1:26:33] Bible it's how much you know about the
[1:26:38] author see how much the author is living
[1:26:41] in

[1:28:00] has been accepted right now you can't
[1:28:03] get the token from the railroad Fair

[1:29:36] be oh I love it that token that's a
[1:29:39] great
[1:29:40] message you know a lot of times we when
[1:29:42] we read the message we're listening to
[1:29:45] the tapes we should really take the time
[1:29:47] to think about what's being said I know
[1:29:49] a lot of times we're we're looking for
[1:29:51] certain things things you know looking
[1:29:53] for maybe help encouragement Faith uh
[1:29:57] looking for direction in our lives
[1:29:58] looking for S but I tell you it's
[1:30:00] important to sit there and just say Lord

[1:30:11] me into that when I put when I put the
[1:30:14] tape on or I'm
[1:30:16] reading all right now we have to
[1:30:18] identify ourselves with the sacrifice we
[1:30:21] have to
[1:30:22] identify him in his death when a Jew
[1:30:25] placed his hand upon the sacrifice he
[1:30:27] was ident he identified himself
[1:30:29] transferring the sins to that
[1:30:32] sacrifice and the sacrifice died now we
[1:30:35] place our hands by faith upon Jesus
[1:30:38] Christ and identified with him in his
[1:30:41] death not only is death but if we are
[1:30:44] accepted but if we are
[1:30:48] accepted we are identified not only in
[1:30:51] his death
[1:30:52] at Calvary right but in his
[1:30:55] resurrection by the light that was in
[1:30:58] him is sent back upon the believer as a
[1:31:01] token a memorial that his death has
