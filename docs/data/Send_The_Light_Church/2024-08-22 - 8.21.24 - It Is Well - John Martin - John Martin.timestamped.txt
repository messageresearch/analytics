[32:28] afraid when the wicked even my enemies

[32:42] should rise against me in this will I be
[32:46] confident one thing have I desired of

[32:51] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[32:54] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[32:57] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[33:00] for in the time of trouble he shall hide

[33:27] just bound a word of prayer Heavenly
[33:29] Father we thank you for your precious
[33:32] word we find
[33:35] consolation we find
[33:38] comfort and we find a light for our path
[33:42] to guide us
[33:43] Lord and we pray that you would
[33:46] come this at this time of the service
[33:50] Lord as only you
[33:52] can anoint only you can reveal yourself
[33:57] and
[33:58] only you can we are looking to you from
[34:01] whence cometh our
[34:03] help Lord Our Help Cometh From you
[34:06] please come Lord as we have come here to
[34:10] subject ourselves to your word and may
[34:13] this word become real and alive and each
[34:15] that we may leave the building today uh
[34:19] with more faith than when we came God
[34:22] will be careful to give you the praise
[34:24] for these things for we ask them humbly
[34:26] now in Jesus Christ's name name amen
[34:29] amen you may be seated want to entitle
[34:31] this message it is well and for a
[34:34] subject the fruit of trusting God Amen
[34:38] we know God is Almighty created
[34:40] everything right he can handle every
[34:42] situation there's nothing too hard for
[34:45] God as he spoke to uh Abraham there is
[34:49] anything too hard for God but the the
[34:53] the the true problem is our part of the
[34:56] relationship
[34:58] amen that we lose uh confidence in God
[35:02] we lose trust in God uh he still uh uh
[35:07] has the ability to to do his word's
[35:10] going to come to pass we don't like
[35:12] really question that but we question God
[35:14] for us and our
[35:15] lives and David here is talking in in
[35:20] Psalms
[35:21] 27 about his relationship with God that
[35:26] the Lord was he says my light my
[35:30] salvation not that he's just the God of
[35:33] Light but but his personal light and his
[35:36] personal salvation and and that the Lord
[35:38] wasn't just strong and mighty but he was
[35:42] my strength amen and and because of this
[35:46] internal relationship that he had with
[35:49] God that he could conclude that there
[35:52] was nothing to fear there was nothing to
[35:54] be afraid of and even though uh his
[35:57] enemies and his foes would come upon him
[36:01] to do to to to to make him fall or to
[36:04] falter uh that he he he still had
[36:07] confidence that God was going to take
[36:09] him through and he makes this statement
[36:12] though a host in other words an army
[36:14] right though an army would encamp around
[36:17] about me it I'm just not
[36:20] moved he had confidence of where he
[36:24] stood his relationship was in a was in
[36:28] the Tabernacle of God now I'm not
[36:30] talking about a building I am not
[36:33] talking about church I am not even
[36:34] talking about this
[36:35] message I am talking about where God
[36:40] dwells amen and where he dwells there's
[36:43] nothing to be afraid of
[36:46] Amen it's only when we're outside of
[36:49] that and we can see why David's yearning
[36:53] and his desire was one thing have I
[36:55] desired of the Lord and that why seek
[36:57] after I will actually I will actually
[36:59] seek for it because I know it's not just
[37:02] going to flood me be handed to me or
[37:05] just when I go to church it's going to
[37:06] be there no because I still have to
[37:09] enter his gates with Thanksgiving his
[37:11] courts with praise I still got to get
[37:13] Beyond this veil of Flesh because there
[37:14] is something there for me to where if
[37:17] once I get into that presence all is
[37:19] well amen there's calm there's peace
[37:23] there's no more I wonder what's going to
[37:26] happen because because you're in the
[37:28] presence of God this place where really
[37:32] all was well amen all was well he says
[37:36] for in the even in the time of trouble
[37:39] he's going to hide me in his
[37:42] pilion this the revealed word the the
[37:45] the place where nothing can touch you
[37:48] because you're in the palm of God's hand
[37:50] and and he said that no man can pluck
[37:52] you out nothing can pluck you out the
[37:54] devil can't pluck you out because you're
[37:57] in the hand of God you're you you have
[37:59] chosen as a a a son and daughter of God
[38:02] to to enter into a relationship that
[38:06] that relationship is the presence of
[38:10] God see so many people Jesus said all
[38:13] that come before me just thieves and
[38:15] robbers all that ever came before me
[38:17] they want me for what I can give to them
[38:20] but they're not interested in a
[38:23] relationship and this is the thing that
[38:24] really can really cut us and I don't I
[38:27] don't mean to to do that but God is
[38:30] continuously calling us into that
[38:33] relationship with him and that
[38:35] relationship is the is is where when you
[38:39] submit yourself to God you are in his
[38:43] Tabernacle right amen the
[38:46] word the word becomes your Hiding Place
[38:50] amen the word becomes your shelter
[38:52] becomes your light it becomes your
[38:55] strength amen no matter what comes
[38:58] against you no matter what the devil
[39:00] throws at your mind your heart has been
[39:03] submitted to the word of
[39:06] godmen for in a time of trouble shall
[39:09] hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of
[39:11] his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall
[39:13] set me upon a rock a
[39:18] rock we know that's Revelation amen
[39:24] and when you know that you know that you
[39:27] know that you're saved there is nothing
[39:30] that can shake you from it
[39:33] amen
[39:36] it's a revelation is what God gives us
[39:42] so we don't We're Not Afraid so we don't
[39:46] fear because we are all going to you
[39:49] know walk through the doors we're going
[39:50] to go home and we're going to encounter
[39:53] situations and and problems as the week
[39:56] progresses as the month progress as the
[39:58] as the the New Year comes along we're
[40:01] we're we're going to encounter problems
[40:04] all sorts of problems health problems uh
[40:07] financial problems um uh political
[40:10] problems government problems job
[40:12] problems neighbor problems kid problems
[40:15] adult problems spouse problems we're
[40:17] going to have problems amen there's a
[40:20] place for
[40:21] us there's a place for us and and it is
[40:25] our job that we we
[40:28] our part of the relationship now is we
[40:30] got to seek after we just can't just
[40:33] expect God to come and fix all of our
[40:35] problems because we got these problems
[40:36] and we're we're we're whining and
[40:37] complaining and and just God why are
[40:39] they here God that is not abiding in the
[40:43] Tabernacle of the
[40:45] Lord that's just saying look I got a
[40:48] problem and I don't got faith and
[40:49] confidence in you Lord now look this can
[40:52] be hard because a lot of times in a home
[40:57] or at a job sometimes even in a church
[41:00] not everybody's on the same
[41:02] page and you're you're
[41:05] left to enter in to this type of
[41:09] relationship on your own am but it's
[41:12] important that you do it if you're
[41:15] waiting for anybody else to do it it may
[41:18] never happen
[41:21] amen and and to be honest with you there
[41:24] is only so much strength and so much
[41:26] comfort you can give
[41:28] from a human
[41:31] being and I I like the way that David is
[41:33] saying
[41:35] here though everything come against me a
[41:38] host I mean when I think a a whole Army
[41:41] can you imagine the whole United States
[41:44] Army encamped around against your
[41:47] house and you're not afraid or all of
[41:50] Russia or all of China and you're not
[41:53] afraid
[41:54] am I mean you have to be in a special
[41:57] place place not to be
[41:59] afraid and look I believe that God has a
[42:02] place for us with everything that we're
[42:04] really going through in life I don't
[42:06] think that that this this Bible is is
[42:10] made just for ideal situations and
[42:13] people who got lots of money and and and
[42:16] a perfect relationship in their home and
[42:19] and children got all A's and everybody
[42:21] from school is coming and saying your
[42:22] your your Stu your your children are the
[42:25] the the the the the the pacle of of
[42:28] example in our schools
[42:31] no I I think this word is is applicable
[42:34] to our lives amen I believe what we got
[42:37] to do is do what David
[42:39] did we've got to enter into that part of
[42:42] the relationship God is Not
[42:46] lacking and we're lacking if we're
[42:49] waiting on God to make us our situations
[42:52] better before we're going to serve him
[42:53] with all of our heart something is
[42:55] lacking here amen
[42:58] it's it's it's free more agency turn
[43:01] with me if you would to Second uh Second
[43:04] Kings amen second Kings chapter
[43:12] 6 and we're going to start with
[43:15] verse number
[43:24] 18 this is kind of a a natural story but
[43:27] really it it it has a little uh
[43:31] Supernatural into it but I want it to I
[43:34] want it to relate to our lives
[43:37] here all right 2 Kings chapter 6 verse
[43:41] did I say
[43:42] 18 okay I just want you to know that was
[43:45] my first mistake because or maybe it was
[43:48] like my 10th mistake since I've been up
[43:49] here I don't know but I'm starting with
[43:51] verse number
[43:55] eight all right then the king of
[43:58] syrial wared against Israel and took
[44:01] counsel with his servant saying in such
[44:04] and such a place shall be my camp and
[44:06] the man of God sent unto the king of
[44:08] Israel saying beware that thou pass not
[44:12] such a place for there the syrians are
[44:14] come down and the king of Israel sent to
[44:17] that place which the man of God told him
[44:20] and warned him of and saved himself
[44:23] there not once nor twice therefore the
[44:26] heart of theing king of Syria was sore
[44:28] troubled for this thing and he called
[44:31] his servants and said unto them will ye
[44:34] not show me which one of us is for the
[44:37] king of Israel there's a there's a spy
[44:40] and one of the servants said none my
[44:43] Lord oh King but Elisha the prophet that
[44:47] is in Israel he tell the king of Israel
[44:50] the words that thou speak in thy Cham in
[44:53] thy bed chamber amen and he said said go
[44:58] and spy where he is that I may send and
[45:02] fetch
[45:03] him and it is and it was told him saying
[45:07] behold he is in Dolan now it is kind of
[45:11] weird that he still believed that
[45:14] somehow he could spy on him and he' not
[45:16] know about it right therefore sent he
[45:19] there the horses and chariots and a
[45:21] great host and they CA and they came by
[45:23] night and Compass the city about and
[45:26] when the servants notice that they come
[45:28] past the city about and when the servant
[45:31] of the man of God was risen early and
[45:35] had gone forth Behold a host Compass the
[45:38] city both with horses and chariots and
[45:42] his servant said unto him alas my master
[45:46] how shall we do what's going to go on
[45:48] what how we going to how we going to get
[45:50] out of here and he answered fear not for
[45:54] they that be with us are more than they
[45:57] that be with them
[46:00] amen
[46:02] no and Elisha prayed and said Lord I
[46:05] pray thee open his eyes that he may see
[46:10] that what I'm saying is the
[46:13] truth and the Lord opened the eyes of
[46:16] the young man and he saw and behold the
[46:19] mountain was full of horses and Chariots
[46:23] of Fire round about Elisha
[46:28] amen Elisha was in that same
[46:32] Tabernacle amen he was in a place where
[46:36] though a host encamped round about him
[46:40] he did not
[46:41] fear now his
[46:44] servant his
[46:46] servant which believed in
[46:50] Elisha still his eyes didn't hold you
[46:53] understand you can come to church and
[46:54] not
[46:55] see you can be in the presence of God's
[46:59] prophet and still not see you can be in
[47:01] the presence of God and still not see
[47:04] amen and Jesus said if we would come
[47:07] into His presence and say Lord I am
[47:09] blind I cannot see he said I would open
[47:12] your eyes but because you come in and
[47:14] you think you have life figured
[47:17] out now just say it like this God is
[47:21] here to open our eyes to see how great
[47:23] our God is amen that he is true greater
[47:27] than our situation
[47:29] amen he wants our faith to
[47:33] rise because God put the situation there
[47:37] for a purpose
[47:40] right he doesn't want us to
[47:43] fear he wants us just to enter the
[47:48] Tabernacle because inside his presence
[47:52] you have strength
[47:55] amen now thing about this servant his
[47:58] eyes were not open therefore he could
[48:02] not believe right but you see we don't
[48:07] believe with these
[48:09] eyes we don't need to see somebody
[48:12] jumping up and down we don't need to we
[48:14] don't need to think you know 90% of the
[48:16] church is on fire so I guess it's okay
[48:18] for me to get on
[48:21] fire no God is the one that opens our
[48:24] eyes it's an individual walk
[48:28] and God is calling us to it that that's
[48:30] what's beautiful about this thing God is
[48:33] calling not John Martin God he's calling
[48:36] for that closeness with him
[48:39] amen and I believe that I don't care how
[48:42] bad our situation is if we're willing to
[48:47] choose to enter into a relationship with
[48:50] Jesus
[48:52] Christ I believe he'll be there to take
[48:55] care of our problems the Bible said he
[48:57] is a present help in a time of need
[49:00] amen but you got to seek you got to have
[49:04] that one desire if I desire toore one
[49:06] thing if I desire to you can't have why
[49:08] I have 15
[49:10] things you got to put God first amen
[49:13] seek ye first the kingdom and every
[49:16] single thing will be added to you that's
[49:18] right and only God knows our heart amen
[49:21] you know you you may you may you may
[49:23] think you know my heart well you know
[49:25] brother John he's like a a really good
[49:26] guy he certainly put God first you may
[49:28] not that may not be
[49:33] true God knows our heart and I'll just
[49:36] say it like this God has never failed
[49:40] right now I may
[49:43] think I I put God first in my heart but
[49:47] my heart is deceitfully
[49:49] wicked there there may be times that I
[49:51] don't I don't catch it and that's why I
[49:54] need to say Lord open my eyes amen help
[49:58] me to see what you
[50:00] see because if we mean business with God
[50:03] I'm telling you all is well we're going
[50:04] in a Rapture that's just all there is to
[50:06] it we're going to fly away right Psalms
[50:10] 91 Psalms
[50:15] 91 David's
[50:17] desire was to dwell in the house of the
[50:22] Lord and the
[50:25] promise of God was that David would be
[50:29] hid in his
[50:30] Pavilion when the trouble
[50:33] came and he called this
[50:36] pilion a secret it's the secret of his
[50:42] Tabernacle and I like this is Psalms 91
[50:46] ver1 says he that dwelleth in the secret
[50:49] place of the most high shall abide under
[50:53] the shadow of the almighty amen we've
[50:56] all heard and seen the pictures of what
[51:00] uh the the Tabernacle that Moses made
[51:04] which represented in type what was
[51:07] happening in heaven right amen it was he
[51:10] said that he showed him and it was a
[51:12] pattern of what was in heaven and then
[51:14] there was the uh in the holiest of
[51:18] holies you had the Ark of the Covenant
[51:22] and in the ark um
[51:25] was uh the God's word it was it was
[51:28] preserved and it was life right there
[51:32] and then you had the two cherubin that
[51:34] stood on both sides and it protected it
[51:37] and everybody that was in the Tabernacle
[51:39] they knew that was the Holy place and
[51:42] the angels on both sides were crying
[51:44] holy holy holy just constantly hour
[51:47] after hour just continuously saying holy
[51:50] holy holy because God views himself as
[51:53] being holy those angels they don't know
[51:56] they were created by God but God but God
[51:59] gave them the revelation of how holy is
[52:02] and he wanted the whole uh heaven to be
[52:06] to to to to be sounding forth of the
[52:08] Holiness of God
[52:10] Amen and sometimes we can't come in the
[52:13] church and say Lord you're
[52:16] worthy come on and you expect God to
[52:19] meet your need give me scripture on that
[52:26] we've got to dwell in the secret place
[52:29] we just can't tiptoe
[52:31] in dwell that that takes commitment on
[52:34] the
[52:36] relationship he that dwelleth in the
[52:39] secret place of the most high shall
[52:41] abide under the shadow of the Almighty I
[52:43] will say of the Lord he is my refuge and
[52:48] my Fortress he's my God in him will I
[52:52] trust you've seen children sometimes
[52:55] playing with a
[52:57] toy and they say no that's mine the
[53:00] other says no that's
[53:03] mine and they just they they want it for
[53:06] themselves I believe that's how we need
[53:08] to be with God Amen though none go with
[53:12] me I'll
[53:14] follow amen th though they fall to the
[53:17] side I'm still going amen because he's
[53:21] my God he saved me I don't know how
[53:23] other people feel about salvation but I
[53:25] know how I feel about it amen I know
[53:28] he's he's brought me as that song
[53:30] Amazing Grace he's brought me through
[53:32] many trials he's going to take me
[53:34] through am it's amazing grace amen
[53:39] surely he will deliver thee From The
[53:43] Snare of the follower and from the noise
[53:45] and pestilence you know you can just
[53:47] fill in whatever you're whatever you
[53:50] want to be delivered from right there he
[53:53] shall cover thee with his feathers just
[53:56] a imagine
[53:58] imagine a an ego covering his her little
[54:02] babies right just protected from the
[54:04] wind and the storm
[54:08] so so taken care of he shall cover thee
[54:11] with his feathers and under his
[54:14] wings you're going to
[54:17] trust under the wings you get out from
[54:20] the presence of God you get out of his
[54:22] will you start you start just only going
[54:25] to church because it's the thing to do
[54:27] you get outside of God it's hard to
[54:32] trust under his wings shall thou
[54:36] trust and his truth shall be thy
[54:40] shield and buckler
[54:44] yes and I just I'm just dropping down to
[54:47] verse
[54:48] 14
[54:50] because he have set his love upon me
[54:57] therefore conclusion I will deliver
[55:01] him you know God really delivered all of
[55:05] us right when we were in sin we gave our
[55:08] heart to God he delivered
[55:11] us and there were still things in our
[55:14] life that he continued to deliver us and
[55:17] we begin to change right as time went on
[55:20] it was like a growing process until
[55:23] until he we could stand back and say
[55:26] we've been delivered a lot by God and I
[55:29] I I can say we set our love upon Him
[55:33] amen we said God we want to serve you
[55:35] you your your word is the truth your way
[55:37] is the right way we're going to serve
[55:39] you we're setting our love upon you and
[55:41] we're going to move in your direction
[55:43] you see these needs we hear you hear the
[55:45] word being preached and you it brings
[55:47] conviction and you say God I got to get
[55:49] rid of this out of my life God help me
[55:51] with the situation and God delivers and
[55:53] that's the way God moves amen you know
[55:56] we can get to a place in our walk with
[55:58] God that we think we got it okay and I
[56:01] want to tell you what happens things
[56:03] creep
[56:04] in things creep in you know what happens
[56:07] after things creep in you need
[56:08] Deliverance again you need to be and now
[56:11] here the key is the same thing set your
[56:13] love upon them set your love upon them
[56:16] you're part of the
[56:18] relationship I want to be where you're
[56:20] at
[56:21] Lord therefore I deliver I will set him
[56:24] on high
[56:26] because he have known my name he shall
[56:28] call upon me and I will answer I will be
[56:31] with him in trouble I will deliver him
[56:33] and look at I will even honor
[56:36] him he shall call upon me and I will
[56:40] answer him there are
[56:44] certain there are certain rewards that
[56:46] we
[56:47] [Music]
[56:48] get from trusting
[56:50] God and I say the biggest one I just
[56:53] want to say like this the fruit of
[56:55] trusting God is that it is
[57:00] well what else could we
[57:04] want what else could we
[57:08] want the bottoms falling out on
[57:11] Earth we don't
[57:13] know who's going to come in who's going
[57:16] to stay who's going to be serious with
[57:18] it we don't know any of
[57:21] that but you've got to make
[57:24] sure that you trust God to the point
[57:30] that you follow the word every day amen
[57:33] anybody can say well you know I'm I'm
[57:35] I'm trusting God the the the the the
[57:37] Rapture is going to come and and I I
[57:39] trust God that he's real and I I trust
[57:42] God that he's the he's the Savior but
[57:44] can we trust God for our life every
[57:47] day because this is a challenging
[57:49] thought for me I I trust it is for you
[57:52] well as well amen let's go back to
[57:55] Second Kings but this time I want to go
[57:56] to chapter
[58:00] 4 so I hope this is okay it's going to
[58:02] be more of a
[58:05] laidback reading the scriptures
[58:10] today this is about the great shite
[58:13] woman the thing is she had a
[58:17] reward and we we have a reward too for
[58:20] trusting God Amen so I just want to take
[58:22] our time and try to read this 2
[58:24] Corinthians chapter 4 starting with
[58:25] verse verse number
[58:27] [Music]
[58:29] eight and it fell on a day that Elisha
[58:33] passed to shunin where was a great
[58:38] woman and she constrained him to eat
[58:42] bread and so it was that as often as he
[58:46] passed by he turned in thither to eat
[58:50] bread and she said unto her husband
[58:53] behold now I perceive that this is a
[58:56] holy man of God which passees by us
[58:59] continually let us make a little chamber
[59:02] and I pray thee on the wall and let us
[59:05] set for him there a bed and a table and
[59:09] a stew and a Candlestick and it shall be
[59:11] when he cometh to us that he shall turn
[59:14] in thither and it fell on a day that he
[59:18] came thither and he turned into the
[59:21] chamber and he laid there and he said to
[59:25] G uh gazi his servant call This
[59:31] shunamite And when he had called her she
[59:33] stood before him and he said unto him
[59:37] say now unto her behold thou has been
[59:40] careful for
[59:42] us with all this care what is it to be
[59:46] done for thee wouldest thou be spoken
[59:50] for to the king or to the captain of the
[59:53] host and she answered I dwell among my
[59:57] own people and he said well what then is
[1:00:01] to be done for
[1:00:02] her you
[1:00:06] cannot you
[1:00:08] cannot help the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:00:12] without being
[1:00:15] rewarded
[1:00:17] God does not forget your labor of love
[1:00:21] amen in any in any scenario and I see
[1:00:24] this this this spirit you know coming
[1:00:27] out of Elisha and he's telling his
[1:00:30] servant it's I believe that's God in
[1:00:34] Elisha working through gazer to to be a
[1:00:38] blessing to this shite woman do you
[1:00:40] believe that
[1:00:43] amen and he said what then is it to be
[1:00:46] done for her and Gesa answered verily
[1:00:48] she have no child and her husband is old
[1:00:51] and he said call her and when he had
[1:00:54] called her she stood in the door and he
[1:00:56] said about this season according to the
[1:01:00] time of life Thou shalt Embrace a son
[1:01:04] and she said nay my Lord thou man of God
[1:01:08] do not lie unto thy
[1:01:11] handmade and the woman conceived and
[1:01:14] bear a son at the season that Elisha
[1:01:18] said unto her according to the time of
[1:01:20] life isn't that
[1:01:23] beautiful yeah
[1:01:26] God understands we we doubt
[1:01:31] amen the thing
[1:01:33] is we don't want to continue just moving
[1:01:37] in
[1:01:39] a in a vicious way
[1:01:42] doubting in other words we want to do
[1:01:45] our best to exercise the fear of the
[1:01:48] Lord right like I I maybe don't got
[1:01:51] perfect faith for this but I'm going to
[1:01:53] have hope I'm going to walk in this
[1:01:55] direction
[1:01:57] and I'm going to trust the Lord amen and
[1:02:00] God God will see us
[1:02:03] through and when the child was grown it
[1:02:06] fell on a day when he went to his father
[1:02:12] uh to the Reapers where they were
[1:02:14] working and he said unto his father my
[1:02:16] head my head and he said to the lad
[1:02:20] carry him uh to his mother and when he
[1:02:23] had taken him and brought him to his
[1:02:25] mother he sat on her knees till noon and
[1:02:29] then
[1:02:31] died she went up and laid on the bed of
[1:02:34] the man of God excuse me and shut the
[1:02:37] door upon him and went
[1:02:42] out wow she laid him on the same bed
[1:02:46] that the man of God laid in
[1:02:51] amen and the door shut upon him and and
[1:02:55] they and she went out and she called
[1:02:57] unto her husband and said send me I pray
[1:03:00] thee one of the young men and one of the
[1:03:02] asses that I may run to the man of God
[1:03:05] and come again and he said wherefore
[1:03:07] will thou go to him today what what what
[1:03:10] what what what are you doing this
[1:03:12] for it is neither new uh New Moon nor
[1:03:17] Sabbath as she
[1:03:19] said and she said it shall be well amen
[1:03:26] I want you to understand what's
[1:03:28] happening in the side of this
[1:03:31] woman who just lost her
[1:03:35] son she's
[1:03:38] projecting that all will be
[1:03:45] well look we can make a decision in our
[1:03:48] trials that things are going to be well
[1:03:52] or we're going to be
[1:03:57] battling this
[1:04:00] unsureness because we're staring at the
[1:04:04] circumstances well this this woman was
[1:04:07] not staring at her
[1:04:09] circumstance this woman was staring at a
[1:04:13] promise
[1:04:15] amen God made a promise to her through
[1:04:20] that
[1:04:22] prophet and she was going to hold him to
[1:04:24] it
[1:04:26] I I I I love that all right what verse
[1:04:30] we
[1:04:31] on 24 see I need you for this Bible
[1:04:36] study then she saddled and asked and
[1:04:40] said to her servant drive and go forward
[1:04:43] slack not thy writing for me except I
[1:04:47] bid thee so she went and came into the
[1:04:49] man of God to M Mount Carmel and it came
[1:04:53] to pass when the man of God saw her a
[1:04:56] far off that he said to Gaza his servant
[1:04:59] behold Yonder is that shite now run I
[1:05:03] pray thee to meet her and say unto her
[1:05:08] is it well with
[1:05:11] thee is it well with thy
[1:05:15] husband is it well with the
[1:05:19] child and she answered it is well amen
[1:05:28] now I'm telling you I look at this woman
[1:05:30] and I believe she's a great
[1:05:33] woman great is thy faith Jesus said to
[1:05:37] that woman for I've not found so great a
[1:05:40] faith know not in
[1:05:43] Israel you want to be great trust God
[1:05:46] Amen you want to be great trust God more
[1:05:49] than you trust anything trust God more
[1:05:52] than you trust in yourself trust God for
[1:05:54] your situation
[1:05:56] that's what makes you great amen it puts
[1:05:59] you in a place that all will be
[1:06:04] well and she could have confidence now
[1:06:07] that all not is going to be well but she
[1:06:11] now was
[1:06:13] bringing that future into
[1:06:17] present because she was now with the man
[1:06:20] of
[1:06:22] God she finally arrived in it is well
[1:06:27] and when she came to the man of God to
[1:06:30] the hill she called him by the feet but
[1:06:33] gazer came near to thrust her away what
[1:06:36] are you doing and the man of God said
[1:06:39] let her
[1:06:40] alone for her soul is vexed within her
[1:06:45] and the Lord has hid it from me and have
[1:06:49] not told me isn't that something God
[1:06:52] doesn't tell uh His prophets
[1:06:56] nor his preachers or all the pastors
[1:06:59] everything he just
[1:07:03] doesn't but it is the
[1:07:06] office it is the office and you'll see
[1:07:10] here
[1:07:12] that eventually it's made
[1:07:18] known then she said did I desire a son
[1:07:22] of my Lord did I not say to you do not
[1:07:27] deceive do you remember a long long time
[1:07:30] ago I'm bringing it to your
[1:07:33] memory then he said to cesa gird up thy
[1:07:37] loins and take my staff in thy hand and
[1:07:41] go thy way if thou meet any man salute
[1:07:44] him not if any salute thee answer him
[1:07:47] not again and lay my staff upon the face
[1:07:50] of the
[1:07:53] child and the mother of the
[1:07:57] child said as the Lord
[1:08:00] liveth as thy soul liveth I will not
[1:08:04] leave thee and he arose and followed
[1:08:09] her it was the
[1:08:11] relationship she was stuck on the
[1:08:19] relationship I we we we don't want to be
[1:08:22] outside of the presence of God's
[1:08:24] anointing amen for our age for our time
[1:08:27] we don't want to just you know try to
[1:08:29] live our life you know seven days a week
[1:08:31] try to enter into church and try to
[1:08:34] become a better Christian it won't work
[1:08:36] like that it'll never work like
[1:08:38] that you can't even find a message that
[1:08:41] that that vindicates
[1:08:45] that that that is a a false
[1:08:49] conception
[1:08:51] of of of that's all we need to do
[1:08:57] we got to make
[1:08:59] sure that that our whole relationship
[1:09:03] with God is moving forward with him and
[1:09:07] not assuming because I've done this in
[1:09:09] the past I must be okay where I'm at
[1:09:12] with
[1:09:15] God and I know in this in this aspect it
[1:09:19] can be a little bit strong and I'm not
[1:09:23] meaning to put that upon you as a burden
[1:09:26] but look I know the
[1:09:29] devil I've met him
[1:09:32] before and he wants to get us to a place
[1:09:35] where we're we're sleeping in Zion we're
[1:09:38] relaxing in
[1:09:40] Zion and before you know it things are
[1:09:43] just falling apart and we don't know how
[1:09:45] to gain control of the situation we
[1:09:47] don't know how to get it back to
[1:09:49] normality we don't ought to get back to
[1:09:51] that place where we trust God and not
[1:09:54] fear against our
[1:09:58] problems you know if we're not careful
[1:10:00] pretty soon our problems can be those of
[1:10:02] our own
[1:10:06] household so I'm saying the answer is
[1:10:10] submit to the word whatever God told you
[1:10:12] submit to it start trusting him and hold
[1:10:16] to that no matter what happens amen
[1:10:19] trust him and hold to him because that's
[1:10:22] what this woman did
[1:10:28] and G Gaza passed on before them and
[1:10:32] laid the staff upon the face of the
[1:10:38] child but there was neither voice nor
[1:10:41] hearing wherefore he went again to meet
[1:10:45] him and he told him saying the child is
[1:10:47] not
[1:10:48] awakened but now notice she still said
[1:10:52] it is
[1:10:53] well and when Elisha was come into the
[1:10:57] house behold the child was dead and laid
[1:11:00] upon his bed and he went in therefore
[1:11:04] and shut the door upon the twain B upon
[1:11:08] them Twain and prayed unto the Lord and
[1:11:13] he went up and laid upon the child and
[1:11:16] put his mouth upon his mouth and his
[1:11:18] eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon
[1:11:20] his
[1:11:21] hands and he stretched himself upon the
[1:11:24] child and the Flesh of the child waxed
[1:11:29] warm and he returned and walked in the
[1:11:32] house to and fro and went up and
[1:11:34] stretched himself upon him and the child
[1:11:37] sneezed seven times and the child opened
[1:11:40] his eyes and he called geser and said
[1:11:43] call this this shite so he called her
[1:11:47] and when she was coming unto him he said
[1:11:51] take up thy son then she went in and
[1:11:54] fell at his feet and bowed herself to
[1:11:57] the ground and took up her son and went
[1:12:00] out that is the
[1:12:03] fruit of trusting God all will be well
[1:12:07] now it now notice it started in her
[1:12:11] heart and what was she leaning Upon A
[1:12:14] promise that was given to
[1:12:16] her by God's Prophet amen and so she
[1:12:20] held on to that you don't just hold on
[1:12:22] to the word of God for a little while
[1:12:24] until things are you know Saucy better
[1:12:27] you keep holding on to the word of God
[1:12:29] and you don't ever let go of that
[1:12:31] because you may need it down the
[1:12:36] road and her faith was not in the
[1:12:42] staff her faith was not in
[1:12:46] Gesa but Elisha was the represented God
[1:12:52] on Earth to the people right
[1:12:55] and her faith was in that word that came
[1:13:00] from God himself because it was thus
[1:13:02] sayeth the
[1:13:05] Lord and we've got to treat the
[1:13:08] message and treat the word of God as if
[1:13:11] it is
[1:13:13] God not just some nice story this is put
[1:13:19] in here to give us Faith to hold on to
[1:13:22] God and that's the only time we could
[1:13:24] ever say all is as well right amen cuz
[1:13:28] Faith's final resting place is in the
[1:13:30] word of God
[1:13:32] right and the result of of of everything
[1:13:35] being well in our life it comes from
[1:13:38] trusting God no matter
[1:13:41] what a't that beautiful
[1:13:45] amen there are benefits only given to
[1:13:49] those who trust God in his word you know
[1:13:52] everybody gets blessed of God but
[1:13:54] everybody does not receive the
[1:13:57] benefits that only come from trusting
[1:14:02] God now here's the thing we all trust
[1:14:04] God
[1:14:07] right but how much do we trust him you
[1:14:11] remember the story about the the the one
[1:14:14] guy who was real talented and he could
[1:14:16] take a wheelbarrow you know over this
[1:14:18] rope and without falling over Niger
[1:14:22] Falls and everybody just applauded him
[1:14:25] and they were just you know cheering for
[1:14:27] him and he would even put some weight in
[1:14:29] the in the wheelbarrow and and go across
[1:14:31] and everybody just thought he was just a
[1:14:34] great person and they really believed in
[1:14:36] him and he said well how much do you
[1:14:39] believe I believe there's nobody that
[1:14:42] could do what you
[1:14:43] do I believe you could you could do it
[1:14:46] again and
[1:14:47] again it says do you believe enough that
[1:14:50] you would get in the wheelbarrow and let
[1:14:51] me take you
[1:14:56] so I say to you how much do you trust I
[1:15:00] say I'm in a place I I am in a place I
[1:15:03] feel I need to trust God more that
[1:15:06] there's more that I need to trust
[1:15:10] him it's it's one thing to sit in the
[1:15:13] car and say you know son you're going to
[1:15:15] be a good driver you know I just know
[1:15:18] you're I know you're just starting to
[1:15:19] take your test and get your your license
[1:15:22] and I'm encouraging you and you're going
[1:15:24] to I I believe that you're going to be a
[1:15:25] good
[1:15:27] driver but eventually you have to turn
[1:15:29] that wheel over to your
[1:15:32] son and you got to
[1:15:35] sit in the passenger seat and you got to
[1:15:41] go you got to you're going to see how
[1:15:44] much you trust am are you with me so I'm
[1:15:48] telling you we're going to go through
[1:15:49] trials we're going to get sicknesses
[1:15:50] things are going to happen in our life
[1:15:52] things are going to fall apart and we
[1:15:53] got to stand up and Trust
[1:15:56] am though he slay me I still
[1:16:02] trust though this person's yelling at me
[1:16:05] though I just lost my job though this
[1:16:07] though that though nobody care I'm G to
[1:16:10] trust God
[1:16:14] Amen it's it's really something it's
[1:16:16] ironic to me that our character is so
[1:16:20] important to God that he would allow
[1:16:22] everything our bottom to fall out in our
[1:16:24] life
[1:16:26] lose every friend lose every job lose
[1:16:27] our money lose everything because he's
[1:16:30] interested in one thing character
[1:16:31] because that's the only thing he can
[1:16:33] dwell with on the other side he ain't
[1:16:34] going to dwell with any of our our
[1:16:37] abilities of what we've done with
[1:16:40] anything he wants to drawell our
[1:16:43] character and he'll cause things to
[1:16:45] happen so we learn to trust
[1:16:50] him I just I I I think we can have
[1:16:54] confidence in our life where we're at
[1:16:56] whatever we're going through God knows
[1:16:57] everything about
[1:16:59] it and that we we do not have to fret we
[1:17:02] do not have to we don't have to fear we
[1:17:05] don't have to say how am I going to
[1:17:07] handle this
[1:17:09] situation all we have to do is trust
[1:17:12] trust and the more that you trust the
[1:17:15] more that God moves in your behalf and
[1:17:17] the less you
[1:17:20] trust the more you're going to find
[1:17:22] yourself
[1:17:23] complaining yes
[1:17:25] that's that's the truth the less that
[1:17:28] you trust God the more you're going to
[1:17:30] complain about your
[1:17:31] situation all right Psalms
[1:17:34] 37:3 trust in the Lord and do
[1:17:37] good oh responsibility trust in the Lord
[1:17:41] do good so sht thou dwell in the land
[1:17:44] and verily Thou shalt be fed that's
[1:17:49] right I tell you I've been in Catholic
[1:17:53] churches being being fed by God Amen
[1:17:57] because of one reason because I trusted
[1:17:59] God was going to meet me amen that's it
[1:18:02] not that I had this was the all for all
[1:18:05] the best Catholic Church no not because
[1:18:07] of that because of my relationship with
[1:18:09] God Delight thyself also in the Lord and
[1:18:14] He Shall give Thee the desires of thy
[1:18:19] heart there's another thing we've all
[1:18:22] trusted we've all done good we've all
[1:18:25] delighted but have we done it
[1:18:28] enough
[1:18:29] right it doesn't say Delight thyself
[1:18:32] once in a while Delight thyself also in
[1:18:35] the Lord he shall give the the desires
[1:18:36] of th heart commit thy way unto the Lord
[1:18:39] trust also in him and he shall bring it
[1:18:43] to pass these are the benefits of
[1:18:47] trusting
[1:18:50] God all right now I want us to take a
[1:18:53] look at something here in Galatians 6 if
[1:18:54] you want to turn there Galatians
[1:18:59] 6 we have a part to play to get back
[1:19:02] from God what he wants to give
[1:19:06] us there is there is in our life there
[1:19:09] are
[1:19:10] times that uh I'm G I'm gonna just uh
[1:19:14] we've got some young we got Luke we've
[1:19:16] got James we got the two sleeping boys
[1:19:19] uh over here and and we got one in the
[1:19:23] back I can't see you
[1:19:27] you is that Gabe Gabe we missed you
[1:19:31] Sunday all right so there are times that
[1:19:36] our parents when we asked our parents
[1:19:38] for something can I have this and they
[1:19:41] said
[1:19:42] sure they didn't Sint they didn't
[1:19:44] question they they yes you're my son
[1:19:47] you're my you're my daughter I want to
[1:19:49] give it to
[1:19:51] you and then we like that so we keep
[1:19:56] asking and they keep giving and then
[1:19:59] there comes a time that we ask and they
[1:20:07] say but if you do this and this and this
[1:20:13] I
[1:20:15] will now that's just them teaching you
[1:20:20] how to
[1:20:23] mature because
[1:20:25] you know if if you wanted
[1:20:28] this and the parents knew that you would
[1:20:31] do your what they want you to do they
[1:20:34] would just give this to you and say do
[1:20:35] this this and
[1:20:37] this but because we're learning we're
[1:20:41] not always going to do want to do
[1:20:43] everything that we're asked to do so our
[1:20:46] parents do have
[1:20:48] to withhold certain
[1:20:52] things before all is well
[1:20:57] well but when you learn to sow seeds of
[1:21:01] doing well then you will get well are
[1:21:04] you with me all right Galatians 66 let's
[1:21:06] look at it let him that is taught in the
[1:21:09] word communicate unto him that teacheth
[1:21:12] in all good things be not deceived God
[1:21:14] is Not mock whatsoever a man
[1:21:17] Seth that shall he reap so if a man is
[1:21:21] sewing I doubt I question I I I'm I'm
[1:21:25] complaining this shouldn't be a a
[1:21:28] murmuring and that you that's exactly
[1:21:31] what you're going to read you cannot
[1:21:33] plant corn and really want watermelon
[1:21:36] that's right amen if you want watermelon
[1:21:39] you got to plant watermelon seeds and
[1:21:42] you can't just say well I want the
[1:21:43] blessings of God but I'm going to seow
[1:21:45] all these seeds of of of negativity
[1:21:49] right amen just it's it's just a law
[1:21:52] it's a law amen
[1:21:56] for he that so to the flesh shall of the
[1:21:58] flesh reap corruption but he that soow
[1:22:00] to the spirit shall of the spirit reap
[1:22:03] life Everlasting and let us not be weary
[1:22:07] in what in welld
[1:22:12] doing don't get tired of
[1:22:15] it it's the way of
[1:22:17] life for in due season we shall reap if
[1:22:23] we faint not
[1:22:26] so you got to keep doing well and you
[1:22:29] can't back
[1:22:31] up you can't faint you can't say well I
[1:22:35] can't go on
[1:22:40] anymore I mean you can say that but
[1:22:42] don't believe
[1:22:44] that because you're fainting right men
[1:22:48] all ought to always pray and not faint
[1:22:52] so you feel you're you're losing grip on
[1:22:54] the Promises on the on the relationship
[1:22:57] with God the first thing we need to do
[1:22:59] is
[1:23:01] pray get back to him get back to the
[1:23:04] importance of of of putting God first in
[1:23:07] your relationship with
[1:23:10] God forget the church for a second
[1:23:13] forget the home forget your work it's
[1:23:16] between you and
[1:23:17] God you put God
[1:23:20] first everything else gets in line then
[1:23:23] right all right let's not be weary and
[1:23:25] well-doing God is faithful for in due
[1:23:27] season we shall reap if we faint
[1:23:30] not as we have therefore opportunity let
[1:23:35] us do good unto all men especially unto
[1:23:40] them who are of the household of faith
[1:23:44] right you can guarantee God is going to
[1:23:47] be behind that so if we continue to be
[1:23:50] faithful God will give us a good crop
[1:23:55] amen that's what that means be not not
[1:23:57] be not weary in well-doing for in due
[1:24:00] season you shall reap if you faint not
[1:24:02] if if we stay
[1:24:04] faithful in other words our heart is
[1:24:07] where it needs to be when we come to
[1:24:09] church when we put on the tape when we
[1:24:11] read our Bible when we get on our knees
[1:24:13] because we're entering in the Tabernacle
[1:24:16] that's that one thing that we're
[1:24:17] Desiring and that we're seeking after
[1:24:20] that we will be in his presence right
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:24] all right we got just a little bit time
[1:24:26] for one more
[1:24:27] Parable this I'm I'm telling you Brother
[1:24:29] Bruce this is the less notes that I've
[1:24:33] had in so long and I still didn't make
[1:24:36] it
[1:24:38] through but that's that's just the way
[1:24:41] it is all right turn with me if you
[1:24:42] would to Matthew 25 Matthew
[1:24:47] 25 oh my my there is so much here there
[1:24:51] is so much
[1:24:53] here um
[1:24:57] H
[1:25:00] H I'm just going to I'm just going to
[1:25:02] trust the Lord right now because I'm
[1:25:05] looking at my notes and the things I I
[1:25:07] got here at the end are kind of like you
[1:25:09] know a good good thing but I I'm just
[1:25:12] I'm just going to read this this is a
[1:25:14] starting with verse 14 it's it's the
[1:25:16] parable of the talents and the reason
[1:25:19] I'm I'm wanting to get into this is
[1:25:22] because each one of these
[1:25:25] servants becomes addressed at the end of
[1:25:29] their life when they stand before the
[1:25:32] Lord
[1:25:34] um how they did with their life with
[1:25:38] with the things that God gave him and I
[1:25:39] think the biggest thing that God's given
[1:25:41] all of us exactly the same you know I I
[1:25:43] can't I can't play instruments and I
[1:25:45] can't do a lot of stuff but the one
[1:25:47] thing that we all have in common is we
[1:25:49] have
[1:25:52] time and it's a gift when you wake up in
[1:25:55] the morning how many says Lord thank you
[1:25:57] for this new day you've given me that
[1:26:00] shows it's a gift it's a
[1:26:02] gift and and you God wants us to occupy
[1:26:07] until he returns right that's what what
[1:26:09] he said all right for the Kingdom of
[1:26:12] Heaven is as a man traveling into a far
[1:26:16] country who when called his own servants
[1:26:18] he delivered unto them his goods and
[1:26:22] unto one he gave five talents on to
[1:26:24] another two and unto another one and to
[1:26:26] every man according to his several
[1:26:29] ability and straightway he took his
[1:26:32] journey did you know the Bible tells us
[1:26:35] that God has given every single person
[1:26:38] spiritual gifts that's
[1:26:41] right we've got natural gifts we know
[1:26:43] that but he has given each one spiritual
[1:26:46] gifts that's right you can find that in
[1:26:48] First Corinthians 12:11 severally as he
[1:26:52] will
[1:26:54] and even though at the end of that
[1:26:55] chapter he tells us to covet earnestly
[1:26:59] the best of gifts he says yet I show
[1:27:02] unto you a more excellent way and we
[1:27:04] know that more excellent way is perfect
[1:27:06] love and that when we have perfect love
[1:27:09] even chapter 13 says those other things
[1:27:11] shall be done away
[1:27:14] with but as we said before that perfect
[1:27:19] love is not going to
[1:27:22] come if we're not being faith to do the
[1:27:25] things that we should be doing it just
[1:27:27] it just won't
[1:27:30] come all right verse 16 then he that had
[1:27:34] received five talents went and he traded
[1:27:36] with the same and made them other five
[1:27:39] talents it kind of sounds like he stole
[1:27:40] the other guy's five talents because he
[1:27:42] traded with him the same but through his
[1:27:45] trading through his ability through his
[1:27:47] time through his effort he literally won
[1:27:50] five more
[1:27:51] souls and likewise he had
[1:27:54] he that had received two he also gained
[1:27:57] another
[1:27:58] two and he that had received one went
[1:28:02] and died in the earth and hid his Lord's
[1:28:05] money his
[1:28:07] talent and after a long time the Lord of
[1:28:11] those servants cometh and reckon with
[1:28:13] them and he and so he had and so he that
[1:28:17] had received five talents came and
[1:28:19] brought other five talents
[1:28:22] say Lord Lord thou deliver unto me five
[1:28:26] talents behold I have gained beside them
[1:28:30] five talents
[1:28:33] more
[1:28:36] H and his lord said unto him well
[1:28:40] done thou good and faithful servant thou
[1:28:43] has been Faithful over a a few things a
[1:28:48] few things that was God's testimony I
[1:28:51] didn't put too much on you that you
[1:28:52] couldn't bear
[1:28:54] I I will make you ruler over many things
[1:28:57] enter thou into the joy of the Lord and
[1:28:59] He also that had received two talents
[1:29:01] came and said Lord thou deliver unto me
[1:29:04] two talents and behold I I've gained two
[1:29:06] other talents besides them and his lord
[1:29:09] said the same thing well
[1:29:13] done good and faithful servant in other
[1:29:17] words he sold the right seeds amen he
[1:29:21] sold good and he received good amen he
[1:29:25] received I'm trusting God that He gave
[1:29:28] me this time this Talent this ability to
[1:29:31] share Christ to to help the kingdom to
[1:29:34] to move forward and give God something
[1:29:37] more than what he had and I'm going to
[1:29:39] do it and if I do it he's going to
[1:29:41] reward me it's exactly what
[1:29:45] happened thou has been faithful for a
[1:29:47] few things I'll make the ruer over many
[1:29:49] things enter thou un into the joy of the
[1:29:53] Lord that he which received the one
[1:29:56] Talent came and said
[1:29:58] Lord you know my situation was a little
[1:30:01] unique I'm I Bas I I know you understand
[1:30:05] everything I'm going through because I
[1:30:06] told everybody on Earth God knows my
[1:30:11] heart
[1:30:12] well because God knows your heart
[1:30:15] doesn't mean you're exempt from
[1:30:16] following the
[1:30:18] word it's still required of
[1:30:21] you Lord I knew
[1:30:24] now now listen to this I knew that thou
[1:30:27] art a hard man now this is the
[1:30:30] description of
[1:30:34] the the side of accountability of God
[1:30:37] that's what you're reading right here
[1:30:39] this is how how God is going to be in
[1:30:42] judgment when he holds us accountable
[1:30:45] this is the side that we don't see
[1:30:47] because see Jesus never said I come to
[1:30:49] condemn I come to judge I come to
[1:30:52] destroy he didn't say that he said I
[1:30:54] come to
[1:30:55] save he said but the same word which
[1:30:57] I've spoken unto you now that is the
[1:31:00] same word that's going to judge you at
[1:31:01] the
[1:31:02] end so we see here this is the the the
[1:31:05] side of God that maybe we don't we don't
[1:31:08] spend enough time maybe thinking about
[1:31:10] because I think it's a provoker right
[1:31:12] for those who are are are are scared or
[1:31:16] who just want to live their life for
[1:31:17] themselves Lord I knew that th are a
[1:31:19] hard man reaping where you did not sow
[1:31:23] and Gathering where you did not straw in
[1:31:26] other words God is expecting
[1:31:31] you to labor and give it to
[1:31:34] him is that really any different than us
[1:31:36] going to work getting a
[1:31:40] check or
[1:31:42] getting Social
[1:31:44] Security and we still give God 10% and
[1:31:48] he didn't do any of the
[1:31:50] labor it's no different God owns our
[1:31:53] life
[1:31:54] amen we belong to him and he's he's a
[1:31:58] hard man he's a hard man and because he
[1:32:01] has an expectation that we need to
[1:32:05] multiply whatever God has given us and
[1:32:08] give it back to him at the end and I
[1:32:11] what I love about this message and this
[1:32:12] word is we don't have to wait till the
[1:32:14] end to find out how important this is we
[1:32:17] can we can know about it today all right
[1:32:20] now and I was afraid he said I was
[1:32:22] afraid so he why was he afraid why was
[1:32:26] he afraid because he knew that he wasn't
[1:32:30] doing what God wanted him to do that's
[1:32:32] why he was
[1:32:34] afraid and look if you make God your
[1:32:38] Tabernacle if you abide in his presence
[1:32:41] you won't be afraid amen it's only if
[1:32:43] you're just wanting to do your own thing
[1:32:46] then you're going to be
[1:32:49] afraid and I was afraid and went and hid
[1:32:52] thy town in the earth and lo
[1:32:55] there there's yours there's my life I
[1:32:59] what I gave you here here it is I'm I'm
[1:33:03] here what an
[1:33:07] attitude notice this believer also
[1:33:10] called Jesus Lord it was a
[1:33:14] churchgoer but he did not allow God to
[1:33:18] be Lord over him and that's why he was
[1:33:22] afraid and his Lord answered and said
[1:33:24] unto him thou Wicked and slothful look
[1:33:27] at that
[1:33:30] slothful he could have been a
[1:33:33] millionaire but thou Wicked and sful
[1:33:36] servant thou knew that I reap right did
[1:33:39] not so and I gather where I did not
[1:33:40] straw thou owest therefore to have put
[1:33:42] my money to the exchangers and then at
[1:33:44] my coming I should have received my own
[1:33:47] with Usery take therefore the talent
[1:33:49] from him and give it unto him that had
[1:33:51] 10 talents for unto everyone that have
[1:33:53] shall be given and he shall have
[1:33:57] abundance but from him that have not
[1:34:01] shall be taken away even that which he
[1:34:02] have and cast ye the unprofitable
[1:34:05] servant into outer Darkness there shall
[1:34:07] be weeping and nashing of teeth now it
[1:34:11] wasn't that I wanted to end on this
[1:34:13] Parable because it kind of has a sad
[1:34:17] ending but I I'll say it like this do
[1:34:19] not look at this one
[1:34:22] servant as
[1:34:24] as who you are only look at this last
[1:34:26] servant as who you do not want to
[1:34:29] be and and look at being faithful to do
[1:34:35] something for the kingdom of
[1:34:37] God because if you
[1:34:41] sow well then you will reap well done if
[1:34:46] you s trust you will reap all as well
[1:34:51] amen let's Stand Together
[1:34:59] I'd like to go ahead and uh sing it is
[1:35:02] well everybody has probably heard at one
[1:35:06] time or another but brother Stafford sta
[1:35:10] spafford I think it's how you pronounce
[1:35:13] it he was a presbyterian brother and he
[1:35:17] also was a
[1:35:19] businessman and he had lost uh a lot of
[1:35:25] money uh just through the down of the
[1:35:29] economy and then after that he had some
[1:35:33] real estate and that got burned up in
[1:35:35] the Chicago Fire and he he basically was
[1:35:39] drling down to anything so he wanted to
[1:35:42] send his wife and his four uh children
[1:35:47] uh to to hear D Moody uh over
[1:35:51] overseas and while they were going
[1:35:54] overseas their
[1:35:57] ship uh came in contact with another
[1:36:00] ship and it
[1:36:03] literally uh broke and it it it it fell
[1:36:07] apart and uh the four daughter or the
[1:36:11] four children they all perished they all
[1:36:13] drowned and the the mother was saved and
[1:36:18] when she was able to get a note back to
[1:36:21] her husband that was just two words and
[1:36:24] the words was saved
[1:36:28] alone saved
[1:36:32] alone and so now after losing everything
[1:36:36] and trying to do good and help his
[1:36:38] family he's now faced with losing all
[1:36:42] his
[1:36:43] children and so he gets on the ship to
[1:36:45] go over to the other side so he can be
[1:36:47] with his grieving
[1:36:50] wife and as he was traveling on this sea
[1:36:55] he couldn't but help to think this was
[1:36:57] this was the waters that took my
[1:37:01] children and it was when they passed
[1:37:04] over the the the place where they felt
[1:37:07] this is where the ship went down he went
[1:37:09] back into his cabin and he he penned
[1:37:12] this song it is well now I'm thinking
[1:37:14] about this and
[1:37:17] see he must have been thinking about
[1:37:19] that shut woman
[1:37:24] he must have been looking Beyond certain
[1:37:27] current
[1:37:28] circumstances and I'm saying Saints look
[1:37:31] we can't be coming to church hoping just
[1:37:33] something is just going to change we've
[1:37:37] got to start applying Faith to the word
[1:37:39] of
[1:37:40] God because if you believe it'll work
[1:37:44] amen so let's think about these words as
[1:37:45] we sing it it is
[1:37:48] well when
[1:37:51] peace like a
[1:37:54] River

[1:39:03] come let this bless
[1:39:08] Assurance
[1:39:10] control what
[1:39:13] assurance that Christ ha
[1:39:18] regarded my
[1:39:21] helpless estate
[1:39:24] and have
[1:39:25] shed his own blood for my
[1:39:33] soul It Is
