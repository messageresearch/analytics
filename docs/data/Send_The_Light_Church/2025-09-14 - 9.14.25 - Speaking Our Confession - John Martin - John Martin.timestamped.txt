[31:17] our heart. And Lord, we want you to
[31:19] build your church in us a little bit
[31:21] more. We want to come up a little bit
[31:23] higher. We want to uh dig a little
[31:25] deeper. We want to fall in love with you
[31:27] a little bit more.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; May nothing hinder that today, Lord. So,
[31:31] we're trusting in the blood of Calvary
[31:34] today. And Lord, may you prepare our
[31:37] hearts now. May the anointing of your
[31:40] spirit be Lord upon our ears, the ears
[31:44] of our heart and upon uh these unworthy
[31:47] lips, Lord, as they speak, Lord, we
[31:51] trust not our thoughts. Lord, we don't
[31:53] want our thoughts. We don't want our
[31:55] pins, our minds, but Lord, you we pray
[31:58] that you'd help us to get out of the
[31:59] way, Lord, that you may uh speak through
[32:04] uh this unworthy vessel, the thoughts of
[32:06] God, the mind of God to your people,
[32:09] Lord, that the connection may be made
[32:12] and Lord, that the word would get across
[32:14] and that your people would be
[32:16] strengthened, Father, that they would
[32:18] leave here fortified
[32:20] and uh putting into practice, Lord, the
[32:24] things that you've spoken today. And
[32:26] Father, we will give you the praise and
[32:28] honor not only now in advance,
[32:32] Lord, not only after the service, but
[32:35] Lord, we're going to remember we're
[32:36] going to remember the word, Lord, that
[32:38] you've given us this week, Lord. And
[32:40] we're going to praise you for it this
[32:41] week. In the wonderful name of Jesus
[32:44] Christ, we commit the furtherance of
[32:46] this service into your hands now for
[32:48] your honor and glory. We pray in Jesus
[32:50] name. Amen.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And turn with me if you would to
[32:54] the book of Hebrews, chapter 10.
[32:57] Amen. Amen. Just looking around. Is our
[33:01] sister Donna here or No, she didn't make
[33:03] it. Okay. I know it was her heart's
[33:05] desire to make it and um
[33:10] we we believe she's with us online. Um
[33:14] and we want to continue to pray for our
[33:16] sister. Amen. Amen. I would like us here
[33:21] uh today to imagine that you are the
[33:24] only person in the church
[33:29] and God is speaking directly to you
[33:33] &gt;&gt; because that's how this service is for.
[33:35] I believe it's to call everyone of us a
[33:38] little bit higher and give us a greater
[33:40] victory. We want to uh speak on uh
[33:45] speaking our confession.
[33:47] speaking our confession and just we want
[33:49] to learn to deal with fear
[33:52] a little bit better. So let's just have
[33:54] that in mind as we read here in Hebrews
[33:56] chapter 10 verse starting with verse
[33:58] number 19. Having therefore, brethren,
[34:01] boldness, to enter into the holiest by
[34:05] the blood of Jesus, by a new and living
[34:07] way, which he hath consecrated for us
[34:11] through the veil, that is to say, his
[34:13] flesh, and having a high priest over us,
[34:18] the house of God, let us draw near with
[34:20] a true heart in full assurance of faith,
[34:24] having our hearts sprinkled
[34:27] from an evil conscience, and our bodies
[34:29] washed with pure water. Let us hold fast
[34:33] the profession of our faith without
[34:35] wavering, for he is faithful that
[34:38] promised.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; And let us consider one another. In
[34:44] other words, let's care about one
[34:45] another
[34:46] &gt;&gt; to provoke
[34:48] um unto love and to good works,
[34:52] &gt;&gt; not forsaking going to church
[34:56] as the manner of some is, but exhorting
[35:00] those and so much the more as we see the
[35:03] day approaching. God bless you. You may
[35:05] be seated today. We want to
[35:08] talk here about everybody um has a faith
[35:13] and and assurance but I like how the
[35:15] scripture tells us here let us draw near
[35:18] with a true heart in full assurance of
[35:20] faith and I feel feel there's like
[35:22] always room to get full to get a little
[35:26] bit more faith to get a little bit more
[35:28] assurance and uh there's a way I believe
[35:31] to get there
[35:33] um and I we we can't really draw nigh to
[35:36] God when there's fear in our life.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; And we need to draw near with full
[35:43] assurance of faith. The Bible says, "For
[35:45] without faith, it's impossible to please
[35:47] him."
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; So, we need to uh we need to deal with
[35:52] fear.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; A lot of people don't deal with fear.
[35:56] They just kind of leave it in their
[35:57] life, kind of uh ignore it. But we need
[36:00] need to deal with it. God is not
[36:03] attracted to our doubts and our fears.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; So, we must learn to exercise and to
[36:09] build confidence to to to exercise and
[36:13] build assurance. There's things that we
[36:15] can do that they're not gifts.
[36:18] They're not gifts. So, we got to build
[36:20] and we're living in perilous times. We
[36:22] know that the Bible tells us that God is
[36:25] shaking heaven and earth. and everything
[36:27] that's been uh holding on to God through
[36:29] emotion or through feelings or just
[36:32] through human intellect is being shaken
[36:35] off now. We're seeing people they're
[36:36] just leaving
[36:39] &gt;&gt; and and and only that which is held on
[36:43] by revelation is going to stay.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; And and this is why church needs to be
[36:49] serious to us. The word of God needs to
[36:51] be serious to us. our relationship uh
[36:54] with God needs to be more serious.
[36:57] Now, we've all felt fear before
[37:00] &gt;&gt; and we've all had to deal with fear at
[37:04] one time or another.
[37:07] I would venture to say that many people
[37:09] who are listening harbor fear,
[37:14] actually harbor fear inside. Fear often
[37:17] cripples people right in their tracks.
[37:19] It freezes them unexpectedly.
[37:23] and its message that it sends. It
[37:25] startles you when it first appears and
[37:28] it leaves you in a state of panic.
[37:33] Fear's intention is always to manipulate
[37:37] you. Whether it's a thought in your head
[37:40] or the devil's using another human
[37:42] being,
[37:44] &gt;&gt; but fear's intention is always to
[37:47] manipulate you. And it opens the door
[37:50] for waves of negative thoughts to rush
[37:52] in all at one time. And it it causes
[37:56] confusion in our minds, building
[37:58] anxiety, leaving us with we don't know
[38:00] what to do with the situation. And and
[38:02] having no confidence or no peace about
[38:04] what to do. And this is what fear is.
[38:06] And I don't care what you know what
[38:08] we're talking about. That is pretty much
[38:10] what fear is.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Fear is a horrible thing. Amen.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; And when it shows up, it manipulates us
[38:18] and it keeps us from doing what we would
[38:21] rather be doing. It just kind of it it
[38:24] goes in there and it says, "I don't care
[38:26] about your free more agency. I'm going
[38:27] to just take control."
[38:29] &gt;&gt; That's really what's going on. We know
[38:31] that fear is 100% completely of the
[38:35] devil. That's right.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Satan is the master manipulator
[38:40] and he knows how to get people to do
[38:42] things unlawfully.
[38:44] In other words, the devil can't come to
[38:46] you and say, "Hey, I'm the devil.
[38:49] I I this is the wrong thing that I'm
[38:52] telling you. Uh would you would you want
[38:55] to consider it?" You don't do that.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; When fear comes, you feel off guard.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a there's a scare.
[39:04] there's a what do I do and and you got
[39:06] to make a decision quick and that I
[39:09] think this this subject if we can really
[39:11] dive into it be honest with ourselves it
[39:13] can really really help us
[39:17] Satan knows how to accomplish things
[39:19] outside of using our free moral agency
[39:23] he knows how to bypass that thing and
[39:26] get us to do things that we don't want
[39:27] to do and if you think about it
[39:32] those of you that have children
[39:34] at an early age.
[39:36] Your children learn how to do things to
[39:40] manipulate you.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Fear is real.
[39:54] John said fear has the substance of
[39:58] torment.
[39:59] Fear has a substance of torment. So when
[40:02] we get scared, we get afraid, we know
[40:04] there's a a a a torment there. So God in
[40:08] God does not torment.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Torment comes from the devil.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; And torment is simply when you torture
[40:17] someone's mind.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; So if the devil ever uses you to torment
[40:25] your your spouse, understand what you're
[40:28] doing. You're tormenting their mind.
[40:34] So, we've been we've touched on these
[40:36] things before that some human beings are
[40:38] so infected by fear themselves that they
[40:42] have the same mindset the devils have
[40:44] and they use manipulation on other
[40:47] people.
[40:48] They bring a fear there to get them to
[40:51] do what they want them to do.
[40:54] And it's unlawful.
[40:58] And
[41:00] um
[41:05] you know we hate when we're when fear
[41:07] comes to us, right? We hate it. We don't
[41:10] want to deal with it.
[41:12] But sometimes we end up using it on
[41:14] others.
[41:18] You know, a little threat, a little
[41:19] this, a little that.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. And so we understand that when we
[41:24] use it, it just is it's actually worse
[41:27] than when it attacks us.
[41:29] But we want to take a look at fear. We
[41:31] got to we want to realize it's not as
[41:33] big as the devil makes it.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Fear is truly a horrible disease that
[41:40] has infected countless of minds around
[41:42] the world. And people use fear to
[41:45] manipulate their spouses, their bosses,
[41:47] their family members, their so-called
[41:49] friends. I mean even nation nation
[41:51] manipulating other nations.
[41:54] We can say with confidence that fear is
[41:57] power without character.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; In Luke 21:16 Jesus said, "And ye shall
[42:05] be betrayed
[42:06] both by parents
[42:09] and brethren
[42:11] and kinsfolks and friends.
[42:15] And some of you shall they cause to be
[42:19] put to death, and you shall be hated of
[42:22] all men for my name's sake.
[42:26] It it's that's not enough to make a man
[42:31] uh to to reconsider about being sold out
[42:34] to Christ. I mean, if you're going to
[42:35] give your heart to Christ, this is
[42:37] what's going to happen.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; You're going to be alone.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't expect your whole family
[42:44] to be on board with you.
[42:47] Dropping down to verse 26. And men's
[42:50] hearts failing them for what? Fear.
[42:55] Fear is a very powerful thing
[42:57] &gt;&gt; for looking after those things which are
[42:59] coming upon the earth. For the powers of
[43:01] heaven shall be shaken and and then they
[43:04] shall see the son of man coming in a
[43:05] cloud with power and great glory. When
[43:07] you see these things come to pass, look
[43:09] up. and lift up your heads for your
[43:11] redemption drawth nigh.
[43:14] In verse 35 says, for as a snare shall
[43:17] this fear come on all them that dwell
[43:21] upon the face of the whole earth. I
[43:24] think it's a I think it's a good thing
[43:26] this morning that we could take a look
[43:27] at fear as in a globe. You know what I
[43:30] mean? like not like wow I can't deal
[43:34] with it but in a globe
[43:36] that I can see it
[43:39] and and I can conquer this and and this
[43:43] cannot have its dominion over me
[43:49] &gt;&gt; now through manipulation
[43:51] of the devil the world has been taught
[43:54] to accept fear in their lives and they
[43:57] have this they they there's a common
[43:59] theme I would probably say in every in
[44:02] every town of every city of every state
[44:05] of this nation and that would be well I
[44:08] can't do nothing about it.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; That's how fear is presented to us.
[44:15] You're stuck. You can't do nothing about
[44:17] this situation.
[44:21] Most people do not face fear headon.
[44:25] They don't call it out. They don't stand
[44:27] against it. but rather they are
[44:30] succumbed by it. They end up being
[44:33] reactive by its manipulation. Instead of
[44:36] taking control and and creating a better
[44:38] outcome through a confidence um or or
[44:42] being prepared or proactive against
[44:44] repeat offenders, they fail to resist
[44:47] the pressure and they end up yielding to
[44:50] a superior force, an overpowering appeal
[44:55] or a destructive influence. And that is
[44:57] what the devil is.
[44:59] giving way to the pressure that they can
[45:02] no longer resist and they end up
[45:04] surrendering against their own will. And
[45:09] this is how powerful fear is and this is
[45:13] how evil fear is.
[45:17] I think one of the hardest things to do
[45:19] is to face fear with a right spirit.
[45:23] Because most people who who get fed up
[45:26] about it, you know, they come back with
[45:29] a with a wrong spirit against it.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[45:34] &gt;&gt; And and you you don't want to face fear
[45:36] with a
[45:38] with fear.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; You want to face fear at God.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. with with a right spirit
[45:48] to be able to look fear right in the
[45:50] face and just say, "I am not going to be
[45:53] moved by you.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you're presenting.
[45:58] I'm standing on the word of God.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; There's many examples in the Bible. The
[46:07] three Hebrew childrens, they faced uh a
[46:10] fearful situation. and Daniel in the
[46:12] lion's den. Elijah when he faced those
[46:14] 450 prophets, you you saw them all stand
[46:18] there in the face of fear and said, "I
[46:20] will not be moved." But you take Elijah
[46:22] after that happened, he ran away from
[46:24] one woman, Jezebel.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; So, so fear can attack anybody.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; It's something that we deal with.
[46:34] And you notice when Elijah stood on the
[46:38] word of God, hearing God's voice, he was
[46:41] able to stand against 400 religious
[46:43] prophets.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; But when he didn't hear from God or
[46:50] didn't
[46:52] yield to God concerning this wicked
[46:55] Jezebel, he got scared.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:00] And
[47:02] God wants us to be able to stand
[47:05] no matter what the devil does to us.
[47:10] A young Christian named Timothy, he
[47:12] dealt with fear.
[47:14] He feared being persecuted, afflicted,
[47:17] and being left alone as a Christian.
[47:21] Anybody ever dealt with feeling left
[47:23] alone as a Christian? Yes.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; For standing in what he believed in. He
[47:29] didn't want to end up like like Paul did
[47:32] in prison. Basically, Paul was in prison
[47:34] and he says, "You know what? I don't
[47:36] know if I want to go through this. I
[47:38] think I'm going to find maybe another
[47:40] church.
[47:42] You know, where it's a little bit
[47:43] easier." And a lot of times the reason
[47:46] people are succumb to fear is that they
[47:48] don't want to feel alone.
[47:52] Truly,
[47:53] &gt;&gt; you don't want to stand up against
[47:54] something because you know you're not
[47:56] going to be liked by that person that
[47:58] you're standing up against.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Personally, I'd rather be alone with God
[48:03] than to be together with others that
[48:05] that fear the Lord
[48:07] &gt;&gt; or or that that others that that that
[48:09] continually fear.
[48:12] And I I'm sorry. Let me just say that
[48:14] one more time. I'd rather stand alone
[48:16] with God, be alone with God, than to be
[48:18] with others who operate through a spirit
[48:20] of fear.
[48:22] because I don't I don't need I don't
[48:24] really need anybody to make it.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; I don't need to be friends with anybody
[48:31] to make it.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; But I do need to be a friend with Jesus.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; I got to have that. Amen.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; David said in Psalms 84:10, "For a day
[48:44] in thy courts
[48:47] is better than three years
[48:50] without being in church."
[48:52] Now, that's exactly what that is saying.
[48:55] For a day in in God's house is better
[48:58] than a thousand not being in God's
[49:00] house.
[49:02] Think about that.
[49:04] That's how important it is to be in
[49:07] church.
[49:10] And I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the
[49:12] house of my God than to dwell in the
[49:14] tents of wickedness.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 15:16 says, "Better is a little
[49:23] with the fear of the Lord than great
[49:25] treasures with trouble therewith."
[49:30] And in verse 17, better is a dinner of
[49:33] herbs where love is than a stalled than
[49:38] a stalled ox and hatred therewith.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; So you see, I'd rather be alone with God
[49:44] and have nothing.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; That have everything that I could
[49:49] possibly want.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Did you know that the disciples actually
[49:53] feared
[49:55] being alone? And Jesus told him, "Let
[49:58] not your heart be troubled, neither let
[50:01] it be afraid."
[50:04] So Jesus is dealing with it and he uses
[50:06] this word let. In other words, they had
[50:09] a choice.
[50:10] We have a choice about fear.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Always remember fear is a choice that we
[50:18] make alone.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; A lot of times the devil leaves us with,
[50:24] well, you know, what was I gonna do?
[50:26] What can I do? This is the way it is.
[50:28] No, you you made the wrong choice.
[50:31] You got to stand up against fear.
[50:35] We cannot blame anyone for the choice
[50:38] that we make to feel fear. That's all on
[50:41] us.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Now, the devil will try and influence
[50:46] us, but the choice is never made for us.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; We make the choice.
[50:55] Now we may become startled
[50:57] but we are never forced to fear
[50:59] anything.
[51:03] Jesus said let not your heart be
[51:06] troubled neither let it be afraid. Let
[51:08] means
[51:10] not prevent or forbid. So Jesus is
[51:14] saying um forbid it
[51:19] for forbid your heart to be troubled for
[51:22] forbid your heart to be afraid. Take a
[51:24] stand against it. Don't wait for
[51:27] circumstances to have to be perfect for
[51:29] you to say, "Okay, yeah, you know what?
[51:31] I don't fear."
[51:33] No. Look fear in the face and say, "No,
[51:37] I'm not going to be moved by you."
[51:42] &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus is telling us that
[51:44] you're in the driver's seat.
[51:47] You're in complete control of how you're
[51:49] going to feel about this situation. Now
[51:52] there's two things that's going to
[51:53] happen.
[51:57] There's always two things that are going
[51:58] on. One is the situation that's being
[52:00] presented to you. Like you may
[52:03] absolutely hate it, may be absolutely
[52:04] evil. It shouldn't be happening. And we
[52:06] can say amen to that
[52:09] and you may not have control of that,
[52:13] but you have control of how you're going
[52:15] to be affected by it.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:20] Because if you can protect yourself,
[52:24] fear will not have dominion over you.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; And you can't have fear and peace at the
[52:31] same time.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; So if you want peace, you got to learn
[52:35] to deal with fear.
[52:38] Fear is something we must overcome.
[52:40] Revelations 21:7 says, "He that
[52:43] overthmeth shall inherit all things."
[52:45] And if you could put this up on the
[52:47] board, I don't know if it's there. Uh,
[52:50] Revelation 21:7, he that overcometh
[52:52] shall inherit all things, and I will be
[52:54] his God, and he shall be my son. Now
[52:56] look at verse eight. But the fearful and
[52:59] the unbelieving,
[53:02] they end up in the same place.
[53:06] So fear to be fearful is a is just as
[53:10] bad as being unbelieving.
[53:14] It's the abominable murders, hormongers,
[53:16] sorcerers, idolattors, liars shall have
[53:19] their part in the lake of fire which
[53:20] burnth fire and brimstone which is the
[53:22] second death. So I'm just saying, you
[53:24] know, to be, you know, fearful is a
[53:27] terrible thing.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; And and you got to face it. You say, I'm
[53:32] not going to be fearful. I'm not going
[53:33] to be unbelieving. Just like you would
[53:34] say, I'm not going to be a murderer,
[53:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be a liar. I'm also not
[53:40] going to be fearful.
[53:47] When you look at Joshua, fear attacked
[53:49] Joshua
[53:51] when they first spied out the promised
[53:53] land with 108
[53:55] uh 1.8 million uh of his congregation
[53:59] said, "We're not able to take this giant
[54:01] problem out of our life. We're not able
[54:03] to deal with it. We're not only
[54:06] grasshoppers in our sight, but we're
[54:08] also grasshoppers in their sight. He was
[54:11] left alone with
[54:14] Moses and Caleb
[54:16] and the younger ones who really weren't
[54:19] even able to vote
[54:22] basically. So, he's left alone facing
[54:25] fear.
[54:26] So, Joshua dealt with fear.
[54:30] He didn't have the majority of the
[54:32] congregation with him.
[54:34] He's still alone. It'd be like me
[54:36] standing up here and everybody said
[54:42] &gt;&gt; and sometimes we're afraid to face one
[54:45] person.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; That's how come easy we get succumbed by
[54:50] fear.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Joshua had to deal with fear 40 years
[54:55] later.
[54:58] And this is how we deal with fear.
[55:01] Joshua chapter 1,
[55:03] God said, "As I was with Moses, so I
[55:07] will be with thee. I will not fail thee.
[55:10] I will not forsake thee." He said, "Be
[55:12] of good courage and uh be strong and be
[55:15] of good courage. Only be thou strong and
[55:17] and very courageous." And in verse 9,
[55:19] "Have not I commanded thee? Be strong
[55:21] and and of good courage. Be not afraid,
[55:23] neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord
[55:25] thy God is with you whethersoever thou
[55:27] goest." So when a situation happens in
[55:30] your life and oh did you hear about this
[55:33] God is with me wherever I go
[55:36] &gt;&gt; you don't forget that when fear pops up
[55:40] when fear pops up that's the time you
[55:42] need to be courageous there's a time you
[55:44] need to be strong it it's a time to
[55:48] stand there and say I'm facing fear and
[55:51] I will not be moved
[55:55] &gt;&gt; I don't care what age we are we deal
[55:56] with fear
[55:59] Even children are afraid that they're
[56:01] not going to get their own will.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; And
[56:05] you you think of of a child, it wants
[56:08] something so bad that if it doesn't get
[56:11] it, what does it usually do?
[56:14] What?
[56:17] Throws a fit. It It cries. It It It
[56:20] whines. It says it it gets angry. It It
[56:24] goes off in the bedroom. It it it it it
[56:29] feels like it can't handle the
[56:31] situation.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; It it can't accept that I'm going to be
[56:35] without this thing that I'm wanting so
[56:37] much. So fear is all around us.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; And it is our job as parents to teach
[56:44] our children to fear not.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; That God is with us in our home.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; That there's nothing to be afraid about,
[56:53] but we have to deal with it.
[56:55] We deal with fear the way that God tells
[56:58] us to deal with fear. And that's the way
[57:01] the word instructs us to deal with fear.
[57:04] And the Bible says that the scriptures
[57:06] are given by the inspiration of God and
[57:08] are profitable for instruction and how
[57:10] to deal with fear. That the man of God
[57:13] may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
[57:14] unto all good works. God does not want
[57:17] us to be stunned or paralyzed with fear
[57:23] &gt;&gt; because fear is nothing more than a lie
[57:28] from the pit of hell.
[57:35] And what I mean by that is
[57:39] we take this this man, this great man.
[57:42] and I don't don't know his name, but
[57:43] they just shot him.
[57:48] And
[57:50] of course, when it happened, you know,
[57:52] fear just kind of struck
[57:56] and it
[57:58] and it was a terrible thing.
[58:02] And we can't deny the situation,
[58:06] but the devil wants to take that
[58:08] situation and say something worse.
[58:13] You you understand what I'm saying? So,
[58:14] I'm trying to separate the the real
[58:17] actual problem and what the devil's
[58:19] trying to make about it.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Fear is nothing but a lie from the pit
[58:24] of hell.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; So, we don't have to be afraid. It isn't
[58:28] like God coming to tell us to get, you
[58:30] know, tormented.
[58:32] It's the devil that's trying to scare us
[58:34] and manipulate us.
[58:37] So God wants us to stand up to fear and
[58:41] say, "Get behind me, Satan.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Cast it out." If we could put this on
[58:46] the board. First John chapter 4. 1 John
[58:49] chapter 4:8. I'm sorry this wasn't my
[58:51] notes.
[58:53] Let's Okay. The Bible says, "There is no
[58:56] fear in love,
[58:59] &gt;&gt; but perfect love, it cast it out."
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Because fear has torment. And he that is
[59:07] he that fearth is not made perfect in
[59:11] love.
[59:13] So the key somehow the key in dealing
[59:16] with fear is to have the love of God
[59:18] inside you.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Because when you got the love of God,
[59:22] you trust God.
[59:24] But without the love of God, what are
[59:26] you trusting in?
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Your own ability to figure out how to
[59:30] fix the thing.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Your own ability how to to cope with the
[59:34] situation.
[59:36] It ain't going to cast out all fear.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; It may it may dilute it and put it aside
[59:42] for a moment, but what really gives you
[59:44] the peace of God is the love of God.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Don't try to face fear alone.
[59:57] Face fear with the love of God. Face
[1:00:00] fear with trusting in his word. Psalms
[1:00:04] 91:14 says, "Because he has set his love
[1:00:09] upon me, therefore I will deliver him."
[1:00:12] See, you've got all of heaven behind
[1:00:14] you. When you're all for heaven,
[1:00:17] [Laughter]
[1:00:20] when you're all for God, you got all of
[1:00:22] heaven.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; But when you're not not all for God, how
[1:00:25] are you going to get the benefits?
[1:00:29] Jeremiah 17:7, "Blessed is the man that
[1:00:33] trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the
[1:00:37] Lord is."
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; You're a blessed man when you trust in
[1:00:41] the Lord.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16:20, "He that handle a a
[1:00:48] matter wisely shall find good,
[1:00:52] and who so trusteth in the Lord, happy
[1:00:56] is he."
[1:00:58] Tell me a man that is full of fear and
[1:01:00] is happy at the same time.
[1:01:07] Happy is the man who trusts in the Lord.
[1:01:12] Sad, scared, whatever is the man who
[1:01:14] doesn't trust in the Lord.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; He's on his own.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; A and and when you're trusting in the
[1:01:22] Lord, you can handle a matter wisely.
[1:01:26] But when you're not trusted in the Lord
[1:01:28] just
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; and it's like crazy situation,
[1:01:34] you got to step back. God is with me.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going to wait on the Lord.
[1:01:42] I'm going to give a a a soft answer. I'm
[1:01:45] going to be real. I'm going to be I'm
[1:01:47] going to be honest. I I'm going to love
[1:01:49] God. I'm going to I'm going to trust in
[1:01:51] him.
[1:01:54] And we're going to get into some
[1:01:55] powerful things that is so easy to do
[1:01:57] that will really build your faith.
[1:02:01] We're either going to fear the unknown
[1:02:04] or we're going to trust in the Lord
[1:02:09] when we when we don't know. It's still
[1:02:12] unknown.
[1:02:14] But either we're going to fear the
[1:02:15] unknown or we're going to trust God with
[1:02:17] the unknown.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; It's still unknown. We don't need to
[1:02:21] know
[1:02:23] to be okay with it.
[1:02:26] But we either got to look we gota we got
[1:02:29] to learn to trust the Lord when we don't
[1:02:31] know something.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Either be scared of the unknown or be
[1:02:36] happy because God is under control. God
[1:02:40] has everything under control with the
[1:02:42] unknown that we don't know nothing
[1:02:43] about.
[1:02:45] You know if we just take for instance
[1:02:49] um I'll just you know for myself when my
[1:02:51] brother had passed away my mother had
[1:02:53] passed away my father had passed away
[1:02:55] even my other brother when he had passed
[1:02:56] away
[1:02:59] I am still left with why did that happen
[1:03:05] and why did that happen then why
[1:03:07] couldn't it been down the
[1:03:15] God doesn't tell us those things. He
[1:03:17] don't tell us a lot of things.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean we can't trust
[1:03:20] him.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; So, so we don't need to know to trust.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Peace I leave with you, not
[1:03:31] as the world give I give you peace as I
[1:03:34] give it to you.
[1:03:36] Peace I leave with you, not as the world
[1:03:38] gives you. God gives us a peace that
[1:03:41] when we're in the middle of a trial,
[1:03:43] every peace is still there. The peace
[1:03:46] that the world gives you is everything's
[1:03:48] okay right now, but as soon as the trial
[1:03:49] starts, there's, you know, problems.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; And in other words, peace only is
[1:03:55] remains there as long as you got, you
[1:03:57] know, you see everything and
[1:03:58] everything's under control and you got
[1:04:00] all understanding and all that.
[1:04:04] So,
[1:04:06] But we're believers.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; We're we're believers that believe in a
[1:04:12] higher power than our own understanding.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Peace I leave with you. Peace I give
[1:04:19] you. Not as the world giveth give I you.
[1:04:23] Isaiah 26:3 says, "Thou shalt keep him
[1:04:27] in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[1:04:30] thee, because he trustth in thee."
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God's peace can keep you
[1:04:36] through trials, can keep you through the
[1:04:40] boo, watch out. Whenever the devil
[1:04:43] appears before you and comes with this
[1:04:46] thing that you never saw coming, that's
[1:04:48] usually when it happens, right? This
[1:04:50] just kind of came out of left field.
[1:04:51] Didn't even know it was going to happen.
[1:04:52] Boom. It's there.
[1:04:55] You can still have peace.
[1:04:59] That's why it's more valuable than
[1:05:01] anything. All the you gota have all the
[1:05:02] money in the world or have peace. What
[1:05:04] would what would you take?
[1:05:10] It's valuable.
[1:05:15] Fear is a powerful manipulative tool of
[1:05:18] the devil that must be recognized when
[1:05:22] it appears. And if you don't recognize
[1:05:24] it, what will happen?
[1:05:26] It will manipulate you
[1:05:30] because fear, if I'll say it like this,
[1:05:34] it's the it's stronger than anything but
[1:05:36] God.
[1:05:38] It's stronger than anything but God.
[1:05:42] And you need God
[1:05:47] to not let it affect you.
[1:05:50] Some of you might remember the story I
[1:05:52] told when this um mother went to go get
[1:05:55] some groceries down uh the road and she
[1:06:00] left the the kids there in the house and
[1:06:04] by the time she got back uh um
[1:06:09] she didn't hear any noise at all. Like
[1:06:12] what is going on?
[1:06:15] I mean when you got kids you got noise
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; and there was no noise. they weren't
[1:06:20] running around. So, she's like
[1:06:23] wondering what's going on. So, she, you
[1:06:26] know, gets inside the door and she
[1:06:28] notices there's like seven of the kids
[1:06:32] there in a circle and they're all
[1:06:33] holding a baby skunk.
[1:06:36] There's a family of skunks and they're
[1:06:38] all holding just putting. Now, the kids
[1:06:42] have no idea what's going on,
[1:06:46] but the mother does. So she walks in
[1:06:49] there and she just panics.
[1:06:51] Oh no. And she screams like that and all
[1:06:53] a sudden they all sprayed.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; She got succumbed
[1:07:01] by the fear
[1:07:06] instead of just that's there.
[1:07:09] Now let's handle the the matter wisely.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; What Lord? What should I do here?
[1:07:18] Because if you think about it, one
[1:07:19] minute before she walked in the door,
[1:07:20] there was not that going on.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; When she came in, started dealing with
[1:07:26] it, she dealt with it wrong.
[1:07:30] So, we have to face fear with trust
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; in God, not our own
[1:07:38] our own wisdom. Like, we're going to
[1:07:39] teach the kids right now, and we're
[1:07:40] going to we're going to show we're upset
[1:07:42] right now. We're going to teach the kids
[1:07:43] right now. We're going to just do it all
[1:07:44] at one time. They better get it
[1:07:46] straightened out. It's not going to
[1:07:48] happen.
[1:07:53] Fear
[1:07:55] is of the devil.
[1:07:58] Paul told Timothy in 2 Timothy 1:7, "For
[1:08:01] God has not given us the spirit of fear,
[1:08:05] but of power and love and of a sound
[1:08:08] mind." If I can just say this, this this
[1:08:10] woman's driving home with her groceries
[1:08:12] right now. She don't know it, but the
[1:08:14] devil has something lined up for her.
[1:08:18] She's just driving home, got the
[1:08:19] groceries,
[1:08:21] probably happy that she's got something
[1:08:23] for dinner,
[1:08:28] but the devil had something lined up for
[1:08:31] her.
[1:08:34] And when she saw the skunks,
[1:08:39] that is when the spirit of fear
[1:08:41] appeared. in the most time that it could
[1:08:44] come in.
[1:08:46] Now, of course, if she's driving home
[1:08:48] and uh she gets the thought, you know,
[1:08:52] what would I do if there was, you know,
[1:08:53] skunks in the house and the kids were
[1:08:54] holding them? What would be the best?
[1:08:57] Would she have time to think about it?
[1:08:59] Right? But fear don't do that to you.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Fear doesn't give you a warning.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; It just appears
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; and you've got to be instant in season,
[1:09:10] out of season. You got to be ready to
[1:09:11] deal with that thing.
[1:09:14] So when we feel fear or the spirit of
[1:09:16] fear, we're actually feeling the effect
[1:09:18] of the devil.
[1:09:21] It starts in our mind, our thoughts, our
[1:09:23] feelings, our emotions,
[1:09:25] and our bodies actually become infected
[1:09:27] by it. Have you ever been so full of
[1:09:30] fear that you actually you had to use
[1:09:33] the bathroom more?
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; If I could just say it like that. Fear
[1:09:39] affects your body.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Did you know stress, worry, fear,
[1:09:44] anxiety can weaken your heart?
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; It can even cause cancer.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; And think about it. Fear is nothing but
[1:09:54] a lie.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; It's nothing but the spirit of the
[1:09:59] devil.
[1:10:03] Jonathan Wensley often quotes this.
[1:10:05] Proverbs 18:21, "Death and life are in
[1:10:08] the power of the tongue.
[1:10:11] They that love it shall eat the fruit
[1:10:13] thereof."
[1:10:14] Death and life are in the power of the
[1:10:16] sun. I just wanted to just take a second
[1:10:18] on this. Now, it's not it's not just
[1:10:22] what comes out of your mouth. That's
[1:10:24] powerful
[1:10:26] because Jesus said, "With their lips
[1:10:28] they do worship me, but their heart is
[1:10:30] far from me."
[1:10:32] Now, if you just don't think about what
[1:10:34] you're saying and you say something
[1:10:35] negative about somebody, it's going to
[1:10:37] have a negative effect on them.
[1:10:41] But it's not just speaking
[1:10:44] where the power is against the devil.
[1:10:46] Now, I'm just speaking of against fear.
[1:10:50] It's learning to speak what's in your
[1:10:52] heart. God is wanting you wanting your
[1:10:54] heart to speak. Uh you God is wanting
[1:10:58] your mouth to speak what you're what's
[1:11:00] in your heart. If I can say it like
[1:11:02] that.
[1:11:04] You can't just you know what's in your
[1:11:06] mind. It's got to be in your heart. In
[1:11:09] other words, there has to be
[1:11:13] the the seed comes from the heart.
[1:11:17] Isaiah 55:11 says, "So shall my word be
[1:11:20] that goeth forth out of my mouth. It
[1:11:22] shall not return unto me void, but it
[1:11:25] shall accomplish that which I please,
[1:11:27] and it shall prosper in the thing
[1:11:28] wherein I sent it. There is power when
[1:11:32] you speak from your heart.
[1:11:37] Good or bad, righteous or evil, there is
[1:11:39] power when you speak from your heart.
[1:11:42] Out of the abundance of the heart, the
[1:11:44] mouth speaketh. That doesn't mean
[1:11:45] everything you say is from your heart.
[1:11:49] It will either build or it will destroy.
[1:11:53] If you speak negative, something
[1:11:55] negative to somebody, you're actually
[1:11:58] going to feel yucky inside.
[1:12:01] You will,
[1:12:02] whether you address it or not, you're
[1:12:04] going to walk away and you're going to
[1:12:05] feel yucky.
[1:12:08] But if you esteem somebody better than
[1:12:10] yourself, you're literally going to be
[1:12:12] building yourself up and you weren't
[1:12:13] even trying.
[1:12:16] That's how it works,
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:22] And so God, he wants us to be little
[1:12:24] gods.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; He speaks the word and it's not going to
[1:12:30] come back void. God says to my children,
[1:12:32] I want you to start speaking the word.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Speak it. Speak to that situation. Speak
[1:12:40] to fear.
[1:12:43] So I need your cooperation. We're going
[1:12:46] to minister a little bit together this
[1:12:48] morning.
[1:12:49] So, I want you to say this with me.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Fear is of the devil.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; And I want you to think about the words
[1:12:58] as you're saying them.
[1:13:00] Ready? Believe it. Remember, have it
[1:13:02] come from the heart.
[1:13:04] God has not given me the spirit of fear.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; I do not have fear.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; I do not have fear.
[1:13:17] I choose not to fear.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; I choose not to fear.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; I will not fear.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; I will not fear.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Fear shall not reside in me.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Fear shall not rule inside of me.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; And don't make this, you know, just a
[1:13:40] regular Catholic church here. I really,
[1:13:43] really want you to believe in what
[1:13:45] you're saying.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; All right, we're gonna have a few more.
[1:13:49] If God be for us, who can be against us?
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; And that's what he told Josh, I'll be
[1:13:56] with you wherever you go.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; God has given me the power of love
[1:14:04] and a sound mind.
[1:14:11] Fear shall not be able to separate me
[1:14:14] from the love of God.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; God's perfect love inside of me casteth
[1:14:23] out all fear.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; How does it feel to minister with me?
[1:14:31] Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Now, this is not weird or silly or
[1:14:35] strange to say these things.
[1:14:37] The devil comes to our mind and he
[1:14:39] speaks negatively all the time.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; We don't give him we're not asking him
[1:14:43] to come. He just comes.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; We We should come to the that
[1:14:48] battleground in our mind and we need to
[1:14:50] confess where we stand with him.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; We don't let him just stay there and and
[1:14:56] talk to us.
[1:14:58] We need to we need to say no fear shall
[1:15:02] not be a part of my life.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; On this date in September on Sunday, I
[1:15:09] made a decision. I am not having fear
[1:15:12] part of my life anymore.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; And it needs to start with a a heart of
[1:15:19] belief and a confession out of your
[1:15:21] mouth.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Don't try to do it without a confession.
[1:15:26] It just doesn't work. You need to speak
[1:15:28] it. Hebrews chapter 3:1 says,
[1:15:32] "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of
[1:15:35] the heavenly calling, I want you to
[1:15:37] consider the apostle and the high priest
[1:15:39] of what?
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Our profession."
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Our profession.
[1:15:46] We need to speak it.
[1:15:51] You ever just, you know, go in the room
[1:15:53] and and you you you you're having a hard
[1:15:56] time and you you you you want to go
[1:15:58] pray, but your mind wanders and it
[1:16:01] bounces all thoughts just bounce all
[1:16:03] over the place.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; And sometimes you just got to this is
[1:16:08] enough nonsense and you start praying
[1:16:10] out loud
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; and before you know it, you're actually
[1:16:14] in tune to what you're saying. But it
[1:16:17] was hard at the beginning
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; and and it took you speaking it out loud
[1:16:21] to have it happen even though your heart
[1:16:23] was there
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; because there's a battle going on in
[1:16:26] your mind.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; So you need to speak it. I can't express
[1:16:30] this enough. We don't we need to just
[1:16:33] tell the devil where we're standing.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Who was faithful to him that appointed
[1:16:41] him. So, so
[1:16:46] who was faithful to him who appointed
[1:16:48] him as also Moses was faithful in all
[1:16:51] his house. So God was faithful. The
[1:16:54] father was faithful to Jesus. Amen. Now
[1:16:56] that word profession, the high priest of
[1:16:59] our profession, it means acknowledgment
[1:17:02] or confession.
[1:17:04] So when you acknowledge
[1:17:07] God in your situation that God is with
[1:17:11] me and I I will not fear. You're
[1:17:15] confessing it. Then God says, "Okay, I'm
[1:17:17] going to make sure this happens."
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; But if you just like, "Well, I know I'm
[1:17:23] not supposed to fear. Why is this thing
[1:17:25] happening to me? This shouldn't be
[1:17:27] here." No. Go to battle. Go to battle.
[1:17:30] God is with me. This is where I'm
[1:17:32] standing.
[1:17:37] verse uh uh Hebrews chapter 13 verse
[1:17:41] number five.
[1:17:46] Let your conversation be without
[1:17:49] covetousness and be content with such
[1:17:51] things as you have for he have said I
[1:17:55] will never leave thee nor forsake thee.
[1:18:01] So, do you think God ever gets scared
[1:18:04] when
[1:18:05] the devil comes and he taunts him?
[1:18:13] No, he's not afraid.
[1:18:16] And when God
[1:18:18] when we yield to the word of God, when
[1:18:21] we have the spirit of God in us, when
[1:18:23] we're full of God's love,
[1:18:27] we're not going to be succumbed by the
[1:18:30] fear that attacks us in our minds.
[1:18:35] Verse six, so that we may boldly say,
[1:18:39] the Lord is my helper, and I will not
[1:18:42] fear what man shall do unto me.
[1:18:46] Now that word boldly, it means to
[1:18:49] exercise courage and confidence. That's
[1:18:52] what we just did when we were saying
[1:18:54] those things that we said together.
[1:18:57] We were exercising,
[1:19:00] courage,
[1:19:02] confidence. We were building assurance.
[1:19:06] Sometimes we just have to say it out
[1:19:08] loud to get going and to get a greater
[1:19:11] faith, a greater belief to to get it to
[1:19:14] the place that we can look uh fear in
[1:19:17] the face and say, "I will not be moved."
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Because the devil wants to put us in a
[1:19:24] corner.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Don't know what to do. No hope. What's
[1:19:28] going to happen?
[1:19:31] I trust in my God.
[1:19:39] So we need to exercise. We need to put
[1:19:42] spiritual effort to improve our courage
[1:19:45] and our confidence by strengthening our
[1:19:47] mind and just
[1:19:51] we at one time I brought a a a picture
[1:19:53] in and it was about this little kitty
[1:19:57] who was looking in the mirror. You all
[1:19:59] seen that? And in the mirror was a
[1:20:02] picture of this great big lion.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; And and and sometimes
[1:20:10] we don't recognize that God is really
[1:20:13] with us.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; But we need to put into practice every
[1:20:20] day. I will not let fear in my life.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Just get up and speak it. If if if you
[1:20:27] if you feel you you you you you
[1:20:30] uh can't accomplish something, just say,
[1:20:33] "I am not fearing. I believe that God is
[1:20:36] with me."
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; You don't got to have all the answers,
[1:20:39] but it needs to start out with faith
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; with a confidence. You need to exercise.
[1:20:43] You can't wait till your situation is
[1:20:46] all taken care of to say, "Oh, yeah.
[1:20:48] Yeah, I knew it was going to work out."
[1:20:51] No.
[1:20:53] God wants to show you off in the middle
[1:20:55] of your problem.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; He He wants you. He wants you. There's
[1:21:00] my daughter. There's my son. Look at the
[1:21:02] way they're standing right now in the
[1:21:04] face of the devil.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; That we may boldly say, "The Lord is my
[1:21:11] helper. I will not fear what man shall
[1:21:13] do unto me." Psalms 921
[1:21:17] or 92 verse2 says I look at this I will
[1:21:22] say of the Lord that's what we were
[1:21:24] doing by the way we were saying it
[1:21:28] we were saying I will not let fear in my
[1:21:30] life
[1:21:32] I choose not to have fear we're saying
[1:21:34] it and here David says I will say of the
[1:21:38] Lord he is my refuge he and my fortress
[1:21:42] my God in him will I trust
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; God is looking for our personal
[1:21:48] confession.
[1:21:51] He knows what what he can do. He's
[1:21:54] waiting on us to say my God can do it.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; So we just we're going to be like Paul.
[1:22:01] I'm going to give you some or or like
[1:22:03] David.
[1:22:04] He I'm give some examples that he
[1:22:07] actually uses the words of speaking.
[1:22:11] It's not odd. It's not weird. We just
[1:22:13] need to practice it more.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; I, John Martin, will say of the Lord, he
[1:22:19] is my helper, and I will not fear what
[1:22:21] man shall do unto me. He is my refuge.
[1:22:24] He is my rock. He is my strength.
[1:22:28] He is my confession.
[1:22:32] Surely, he shall deliver me from the
[1:22:34] snare of the follower and from the noise
[1:22:36] and pestilence.
[1:22:38] You know what to me what noise and
[1:22:39] pestilence is.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; That's that fear buzzing around in your
[1:22:44] head.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. Always
[1:22:47] telling you about the problem.
[1:22:50] But the Bible says that he will deliver
[1:22:51] us.
[1:22:54] You know, we've heard you can't stop a
[1:22:56] bird from flying over your head, but you
[1:22:59] can keep them from making a nest in your
[1:23:01] hair. Surely shall deliver thee from the
[1:23:05] snare of the follower and from the noise
[1:23:06] and pestilence.
[1:23:11] He shall cover thee with his feathers
[1:23:14] and under his wings thou shalt trust.
[1:23:20] His trust shall be thy shield and a
[1:23:22] buckler.
[1:23:23] I I don't want It's hard to trust God
[1:23:26] when you're away from him.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; But it's easy to trust when he's with
[1:23:33] you.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Like I don't care what problem you've
[1:23:36] ever faced. That was the the hardest
[1:23:38] fearful thing. If you could literally
[1:23:40] see Jesus standing next to you,
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; that's why the disciples were so afraid
[1:23:44] when he was leaving.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Like what's going to go on? What's going
[1:23:48] to happen? Let you know let your let not
[1:23:51] your heart be troubled. either be
[1:23:52] afraid. I'm going to send back the
[1:23:54] comforter. He's going to be with you.
[1:23:55] He's actually going to be in you now.
[1:23:57] And you're it's going to be just like um
[1:23:59] it's actually be better than me standing
[1:24:01] here next to you. I'm going to be inside
[1:24:03] of you.
[1:24:05] And because I am with you, I'm never
[1:24:08] going to leave you. I'm never going to
[1:24:09] forsake you. You can boldly say, "The
[1:24:11] Lord is my helper."
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; And I shall not be moved.
[1:24:20] I will dwell in the secret place of the
[1:24:23] most high. I shall abide under the
[1:24:26] shadow of the most of the almighty.
[1:24:30] Jesus said in Matthew 18:18, "Verily,
[1:24:32] verily, I say unto you,
[1:24:34] who whatsoever you shall bind on earth
[1:24:39] shall be bound in heaven,
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; and whatsoever you loose on earth shall
[1:24:44] be loosed in heaven. Again,
[1:24:48] I say unto you, that if two of you shall
[1:24:50] agree on earth as touching anything
[1:24:54] that they shall ask, it shall be done
[1:24:57] for them of my father which is in
[1:24:59] heaven.
[1:25:02] You have power to bind a situation.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Say, get out of my life.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; That may exist over there, but not here.
[1:25:14] I am not going to be affected by that.
[1:25:18] I choose peace. I choose to trust God.
[1:25:26] Sometimes we're not taking the word
[1:25:29] that's been given to us and using it
[1:25:32] against the devil.
[1:25:35] David boldly exercised courage and
[1:25:38] confidence. He said in Psalms 27:1,
[1:25:41] "The Lord is my is my light and my
[1:25:45] salvation. Whom shall I fear?
[1:25:49] The Lord is the strength of my life. Of
[1:25:51] whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked,
[1:25:54] even my enemies and my foes came upon me
[1:25:56] to eat of my flesh, and they stumbled
[1:25:58] and fall fell. Though a host should
[1:26:01] encamp against me, my heart shall not
[1:26:05] fear."
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:09] And we got to say the same thing. Though
[1:26:11] I got this huge problem in my life, I am
[1:26:14] not going to fear.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; The war should rise up against me. In
[1:26:20] this will I be confident.
[1:26:24] Psalms 56:3.
[1:26:28] What time I am afraid,
[1:26:30] I will trust in thee.
[1:26:33] Right there, you have a choice. That's
[1:26:35] telling you you got a choice.
[1:26:37] When fear appears to me, I'm going to
[1:26:40] trust.
[1:26:42] I just love that. In in God, I will
[1:26:45] praise his word. In God, I put my trust.
[1:26:47] I will not fear what flesh can do unto
[1:26:50] me. So, don't let fear paralyze you
[1:26:53] anymore.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; I mean, if you can get serious with
[1:26:56] this, you know how happy a person you're
[1:26:58] going to be.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Because this is a real thing.
[1:27:03] Take a stand. take a stand and and make
[1:27:06] a positive confession in your heart and
[1:27:10] and God will God will move on the behalf
[1:27:14] of your profession.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; If you confess that I'm an overcomer,
[1:27:19] you will start to be an overcomer.
[1:27:23] I
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; if you if you confess I I am not going
[1:27:28] to have fear part of my life anymore,
[1:27:30] you'll see a as time goes on, you will
[1:27:33] grow and fear will be less a part of
[1:27:36] your life. Now it may not happen
[1:27:37] overnight
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; because you know character is not a
[1:27:41] gift.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; It's a victory
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; and you have to learn to deal with fear.
[1:27:49] Don't become by it. Don't say, "I don't
[1:27:51] want to deal with it." Don't put it off.
[1:27:54] Just say, "It's there, but it ain't
[1:27:55] touching me.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; I've taken a stand.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[1:28:03] Whom shall I fear?
[1:28:08] I If I This is what I want you to do. I
[1:28:12] want you to look forward to the next
[1:28:14] time you the devil tries to scare you.
[1:28:17] And I want you to take this word that
[1:28:19] you heard today and just say, "I'm not
[1:28:21] going to be afraid because God is with
[1:28:23] me. He's my shield.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my strength. What time I'm
[1:28:28] afraid, I'm going to trust him. I will
[1:28:31] not fear." And I want you to practice
[1:28:33] saying this every day.
[1:28:36] You know, I actually I started going to
[1:28:39] therapy. I'm kind of off right now till
[1:28:41] I get it straightened back out, but I'm
[1:28:43] going to be going. And what they do is
[1:28:44] you you have to practice exercising your
[1:28:46] muscles,
[1:28:48] right?
[1:28:50] I I think we have to start practicing
[1:28:54] spiritually exercising our muscles
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; because look, the the devil is not going
[1:28:59] to stop ta taunting you.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; He's not going to just leave you alone.
[1:29:04] He's not going to say, "Okay, you've had
[1:29:06] enough now, John. You're you're you're
[1:29:08] you're 50 years old. You got enough
[1:29:10] now."
[1:29:12] He don't stop. So what you have to do is
[1:29:15] stop him.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; And you stop him by exercising your
[1:29:20] faith, your confidence, your trust,
[1:29:24] and not just some
[1:29:27] um
[1:29:28] imagination.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Like I'm I'm some some
[1:29:34] um some Christian that that knows the
[1:29:36] Bible. But when you come and face the
[1:29:38] devil, you you get all upset, you get
[1:29:40] angry, and you start yelling at at
[1:29:42] people.
[1:29:44] It doesn't matter what you know.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; It matters what you possess.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; And and and we need to really possess
[1:29:55] the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Psalms 118:6, the Lord is on my side. I
[1:30:01] will not fear what man can do unto me.
[1:30:05] Last verse here in Mark 11:22.
[1:30:08] And Jesus answering saith unto them,
[1:30:11] have faith in God.
[1:30:13] Have faith in God. Faith, this word
[1:30:16] faith means persuasion and confidence.
[1:30:21] So if we don't have faith, the faith
[1:30:24] that we desire,
[1:30:25] then we need to humbly start exercising
[1:30:28] courage and confidence. Just start
[1:30:32] saying it. Even though you don't maybe
[1:30:34] feel it, say it.
[1:30:37] And before long, you're you're going to
[1:30:40] believe it more.
[1:30:42] And you say it more and then you believe
[1:30:45] it more. And before you know it, you
[1:30:48] begin to grow in your confidence.
[1:30:51] And this is what pleases God.
[1:30:54] Doubts, fears, you know, waiting for God
[1:30:57] to come and and and and just um you
[1:31:00] know, give you something. That ain't the
[1:31:02] way he works.
[1:31:05] That's why when he stood on the earth,
[1:31:06] he said, "If thou cast believe, all
[1:31:08] things are possible." Do you believe me?
[1:31:10] I can do this. He's always What was the
[1:31:13] theme of of brother Brandham's ministry?
[1:31:18] Only believe,
[1:31:21] trying to get the people to believe.
[1:31:23] when when there would be somebody coming
[1:31:25] through the the the prayer line and they
[1:31:27] didn't quite have the faith,
[1:31:30] he would stop and he would go out there
[1:31:32] into the audience, something would
[1:31:33] happen, to increase their faith. God is
[1:31:36] always pulling us to trust him more, to
[1:31:38] believe more, to grow because the devil
[1:31:42] through fear shrinks our faith, shrinks
[1:31:45] us. And people are falling away.
[1:31:48] Apostasies everywhere. Just a a a great
[1:31:51] falling away.
[1:31:53] And it's those that are going to fall in
[1:31:55] love with the word of God. Stay with the
[1:31:57] word.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Those are the ones that are going to be
[1:31:59] here.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Had a chance to talk to Sister Levantine
[1:32:04] and she was sharing these these same
[1:32:06] things. People just don't love the word
[1:32:09] like they used to.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Have faith in God. Start
[1:32:17] confessing it out loud. Start speaking
[1:32:19] it out loud. Start testifying out loud.
[1:32:22] This is who you are. This is what you
[1:32:24] believe.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; And don't wait till you have a good day
[1:32:28] to do it.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; And don't be afraid that you're going to
[1:32:31] fall after you after you say it.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Get up again and say it. Get up again
[1:32:37] and say it. Because if you don't save
[1:32:39] yourself, nobody else will.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Verse 23. For verily I say unto you,
[1:32:46] that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:32:48] mountain, I'm going to say this, fear,
[1:32:50] it doesn't matter what it is,
[1:32:53] this mountain of fear, be thou removed,
[1:32:56] and be thou cast into the sea, and shall
[1:32:59] not doubt in his heart, but shall
[1:33:02] believe
[1:33:04] that those things which he saith,
[1:33:07] notice, which he saith, I love that, not
[1:33:11] what he he thinks in his head, but what
[1:33:13] he saith shall come to pass. He shall
[1:33:16] have whatsoever what he saith.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; You got to confess it.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; You got to speak it. You can't just You
[1:33:25] can't let the preacher do it.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; You can't let brother Brandham do it.
[1:33:29] You can't let somebody else do it.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; The devil is not going to somebody else
[1:33:34] to get permission to come to you with
[1:33:36] fear. He's coming directly to you.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; So, you got to be able to be equipped to
[1:33:40] tell the devil, "Get behind me.
[1:33:42] Therefore, I say unto you, what what
[1:33:45] things soever you desire when you pray,
[1:33:49] believe that you will receive them, and
[1:33:51] ye shall have them. Amen. Let's stand
[1:33:54] together.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Have faith in God.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; You want to exercise faith, confess it.
[1:34:04] I'm a believer.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Fear is not a part of my life. I gave
[1:34:09] that up a long time ago. How many's How
[1:34:12] many's given up a habit that you used to
[1:34:14] have? Like you used to have a habit. You
[1:34:16] knew you had it and you don't have it
[1:34:18] anymore. Let me see your hands. Okay.
[1:34:23] And that was the power of God, right?
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; And I don't care if it's smoking,
[1:34:28] drinking, cussing. I don't care what the
[1:34:29] habit was. You had it. You gave it up.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; You can give up fear. Amen.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; You can give that habit up of that habit
[1:34:38] of listening and and and and listening
[1:34:40] to what the devil says.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Like your whole life can change
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; because fear is a manipulator
[1:34:50] and it has no part with a child of God.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that chorus. Learning
