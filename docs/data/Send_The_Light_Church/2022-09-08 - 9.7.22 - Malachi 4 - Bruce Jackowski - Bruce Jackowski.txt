possible jesus is here oh jesus is here all things are possible jesus is here amen amen praise the lord amen if you're turning me tonight to the last book the last chapter in the old testament tonight we'd like to do just a little bible study on malachi 4. amen for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it leave shall leave them neither root nor branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet and the day that i should do this saith the lord of hosts remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel with the statutes and judgments behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse amen let's just bow our heads dear lord jesus we're we're grateful lord that we can stand together father tonight and and read the words out of the book the lord our hearts our hearts go out to brother marty and sister kathleen lord jesus what a shock but lord we know that you are that bearer of our burdens lord jesus we lay our our burdens at your feet father and we know that you are faithful you are faithful and true and father everything is done lord that you might be glorified so i pray you'll bless brother marty sister kathleen bless the family those that are left behind lord i pray that you be merciful to them and tonight lord may you be merciful to us lord we're just we're just dirt we're just here father lord you put a spirit in us and lord your blood cleansed us and you changed us and lord jesus we just pray that you'll be merciful tonight and that you just come and break the bread of life lord may you just feed us may you open our eyes in our understanding lord that we might glorify you in all things in jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen you may be seated praise the lord amen amen most all of us should know malachi 4 5 and 6. but there there is a lot in malachi 4. it's good to know that the book of malachi it was the last of the prophecies to the restored remnant that was after the 70-year captivity in babylon and it was during the time of nehemiah and ezra and the repairing and the rebuilding of jerusalem and the restoration of the temple worship it was during that time that these prophecies were given and it's very important to know that because if you know that then you can understand the attitude later on when we get into other details and start looking at things then the things that are written in the book are become very enlightening so the space of time between malachi and the birth of christ is about 400 years so the the patriarchs through the ages martin luther and wesley and and knox and finney and all these ones that you know because the scriptures was written originally all written in the new testament was written in greek and then of course it was translated into latin and then the people never got to see it because the priests understood latin but the common people didn't know latin so we thank the lord that god one day he he went and translated it into a language that we could understand why am i telling you that because the book of malachi which is only four chapters and it is the last book in the old testament that god chose to preserve that book for this age he chose to choose that there was probably many other minor prophets or other people that they could have put in the book but malachi is put in there amen amen malachi 4 has three distinct parts in it the first part is verse 1. so we'll just read this again so that so it says for behold the day cometh that you'll burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and that day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch so verse one is the first part the second part is but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the souls of your feet in the day that i shall do this saith the lord of hosts remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horeb for all of israel with its statutes and judgments that's the second part and then the third part is behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse amen so verse 1 it talks about he says says so behold the day cometh that you'll burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts and it shall leave them neither root nor branch i mean i don't really want to be here for that but god right away he starts speaking in the other parts he says but unto you that fear my name but means before that happens you that fear my name i will do something when you look at verse 5 and 6 he says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord so i kind of i agonized over this i thought well maybe maybe the verses are out of order but you got to understand so when nehemiah and ezra when they came out of babylon they came down and the city was ruined the walls were knocked down the temple was burnt to the ground and everything and when nehemiah you if you go back and study the book of nehemiah and ezra you'll find out because ezra was the priest but nehemiah was the governor who was trying to rebuild the walls and while they were there and they were doing that people rose up to fight with them about restoring the city so during this time malachi comes and says behold the day cometh that the world is going to burn up like a flaming fire so it wasn't unusual for them to hear that because they could look around and see the evidence of that the city was destroyed so they're looking at that and and they thought what another battle's coming amen another battle's coming so we want to take a look here let's now there's many many many scriptures that talks about the day of the lord but we want to go to daniel 12 we're just going to look at at two settings in the scriptures otherwise we'll be here for weeks we don't want to do that if you look at daniel 12 verse 4 it says but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased and daniel looked and said and behold there stood another two one on this side of the bank of the river and one on the other side of the bank of the river and one said to the man clothed with linen which is upon the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders so daniel at the end of his life he sees these visions he sees these prophecies and he asks god a legitimate question when will this be when will be that end of it and i heard a man clothed in linen that was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever that it should be for a time times and a half and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished and i heard but i didn't understand well i'm glad you told me that but i don't know what it means so we asked god again oh my lord when shall be the end of these things and he says sorry daniel it's not for you the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end so the only clue that we have in daniel 12 is verse 4 where he tells him to shut up the words seal the book even to the time of the end and when the time of the end comes many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased now don and i the other night were watching an old john wayne movie and they were flying from hawaii to san francisco and they were flying in a dc-8 and they had 3 400 gallons of fuel and it was going to take them 12 and a half hours and they only flew at 9000 feet i said wow that's hardly you can almost jump up 9000 feet and then we compared it with today and today you can fly from hawaii to san francisco in five and a half hours and it sets at 600 miles an hour at 37 000 feet so they shall run to and fro we can travel the world i'm always amazed i'm amazed at the power of this phone i can call somebody in africa and they pick up and then i can facetime them and actually see them without it going i mean it's actually quite good so he says the only two clues i'm going to give you about the time of the end is that many will run to and fro and that knowledge shall increase that's the only clue i'm giving you daniel now here's the disciple here's here's the the issue so to speak malachi prophesies and then everything goes on like it always has they expected maybe you know the king of assyria or the king of persia they expected somebody to come up and just burn the place back down to the ground so they were looking for that because malachi was a vindicated prophet otherwise the book wouldn't be in the bible but it is there and so 400 years god was silent and at the end of the 400 years jesus christ came on the scene and it was so their expectation every time that god started to move and they recognized the move of god was they were looking for behold the day of the lord is at hand he's going to burn this place up because that was the last thing that god told through a prophet to his people amen so we find out then that through the life of jesus the disciples continually were saying are you going to set up the kingdom now are you going to set up the kingdom now when can i be the leader when can this one be the leader i'm the greatest and when are you going to run the romans out and everything else and they were all the jews were looking for that but it never happened when he went to calvary it was a shock because it was not what they had thought out it was just a shock to them and we but we find that god was not without a witness because i want you to go to ii peter 3 praise the lord amen amen when we go to ii peter 3 and we go down here to verse 10 it says but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night amen which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with the fervent heat and the earth's also and the works that are therein shall be burned up and that's exactly malachi 4 1. he's quoting malachi 4 1. amen and he says when this happens seeing then that all of these things should be dissolved what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness amen and we know that holy conversation means holy living amen not just about what we talk about but we know god is going to destroy the world by fire and we know that according to daniel's prophecy that we're getting close to the season amen amen brother branham and super sign he says but you see now what happened all at once 6 000 years has been the same man but right here in the last 50 years he's come from a horse to a buggy to a jet to a rocket i mean it is absolutely amazing if you spend just a little bit of time looking at how much the world changed from the civil war all the way up to the first world war how much it changed after the beginning of the of the 19th century how much it changed when electricity i mean they entered into the 1900s with gas kerosene lights and whale oil lights and coal fires and everything else and within just a very very very short time electricity started going up around everywhere after a very short time somebody was able to make a telephone and talk 25 miles which they thought that was great because that's a lot better than writing a letter it was such a short time that things started to happen very quickly and in super saiyan brother branham said you need to take a notice of that he says only in the last 50 years so he was this was in 1962. he says only in the last 50 years he's come from a horse and buggy to eject and then a rocket why the bible said that they would run to and fro in the last days and knowledge shall increase it's a sign of the end time now we all believe that this is the end time but if you can't set it in the scriptures then you're just guessing everybody's just guessing you know the the we're going to see that later on the disciples the scribes the pharisees everybody was guessing but when they could place it right in the scriptures then we have thus saith the lord amen amen so i want you to notice that the world was going in a breakneck speed just fast fast fast creation making things making things making things making things making things and then in 1945 some men got into god's cabinet and they came out with a bomb and their biggest concern was if we drop this bomb what will stop it will the reaction start and it won't stop will it fulfill malachi 4 1. amen in 1945 they had never they had just they had done it scientifically in the lab they had calculated it out mathematically and everything else but they didn't even know if it was going to blow up when they dropped it at hiroshima but when they dropped it everybody even to this day is terrified of nuclear war you i the russians ukraine i don't care who they are i see they're they're bombing the nuclear power plant as we speak which is like okay we're all afraid in nuclear power do you notice god stopped them he stopped him he demonstrated malachi 4 1 and then he stopped him let's go back to malachi 4. so we see that verse 1 talks about the day the last day when god will come and finally clean this filthy world up he's going to completely clean it off there are so many i mean there's so much but we only have so much time and our brains can only handle so much so i went through and said nope can't do that can't do that can't do that can't do that so but we can do this we know the day cometh that it shall burn as an oven verse 2 says but don't be don't you be afraid verse 2 says don't don't you be afraid because you fear go ahead put the second verse up on the screen he says but unto you that fear my name the son of righteousness shall rise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that i shall do this saith the lord of hosts remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel with the statutes and the judgments amen now i just did a little quick google on the internet and i put in healing revival so verse 2 says for everybody that fears the name of the lord once they saw hiroshima and nagasaki everybody was afraid the catholics were afraid the baptists were afraid everybody was afraid because they saw the awesome power that a nuclear annihilation could be now the words of the book was right in front of them and all the papers they could see it but god says but unto you that fear my name before the day of the lord i will rise up with the son of righteousness with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as calves in the stall i put in healing revival and the healing revival is a term used by many american charismatics to reference to a christian revival movement that began in june of 1946 a year after the bomb was dropped and it continued through the 50s in 1956 the healing revival reached its peak with 49 separate evangelists held major meetings around the world and see they couldn't do that in luther's day they couldn't do that in wesley's age because they're all going around by horse and oxcart they were walking johnny appleseed walked all over the united states planting apple trees by foot right that's what he did people just they were not daniel 12 was not fulfilled but we see that all of a sudden when people could go to and fro so we we see that lord yep knowledge shall increase yup we see that all of a sudden we see an example of total annihilation and the next year god rises up out of the ashes of history rises right up out of the ashes of history and there's such a huge healing revival that the whole world takes notice of it amen which is what malachi 4 2 says it continued through the 50s in 1956 the healing revival reached its peak as 49 separate evangelists held major meetings by 1960 the number of evangelists holding national campaigns dropped to 11. because god had fulfilled his word what is the importance of the healing revival well let's look what the bible says and then those that saw the healing revival and belong to the healing revival salvation went hand in hand with it they saw the healing revival and said the god that's in that bible must be alive because i don't got cancer anymore i'm giving my heart to the lord and when you do that you start to go forth and grow up as a calf in the stall because when you come to god you don't know how to live for god you don't know about the bible you don't know about you don't even know about the creator you don't know anything but when you see the healing if you love god and you see the healing and it catches your attention brother adam said that is what jesus did in the first bowl he said he went around with a healing campaign you see when when jesus did that the scribes and pharisees went back to malachi and they said hey look what's happening amen but they misplaced the scriptures because daniel's prophecy wasn't in the right place and he puts us in here in verse three he says and you shall tread down the wicked for there shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that i should do this you know now see you think oh wait a minute he's talking about malachi 4-1 but no the healing revival is before the great and dreadful day of the lord so then what he tells you is that once you start to grow then you find out that everybody no weapon shall prosper against you all your enemies will come and bow at your feet they will become you you get so much power you don't have to worry about these things because all of a sudden you find out that god is in control of everything amen praise the lord amen amen in the day that i shall do this i shall do this that's what i like about god when i came and said lord save me he did and then when he did that then he did all the other things too it wasn't me trying to figure out well how do i do this he said you know brother branham told a story about the eagle he says that little eagle is in the chicken yard he was an eagle to begin with but he all the chickens had convinced him he was a chicken i wonder how many of us are still chickens and then one day he heard the mama scream he saw the healing revival and he's and he heard that scream because the scream was inside of his heart already so the scream in his heart answered the scream that was up there and when that happened he said mama how do i get up there she said just jump donna and i we were watching we had some house friends in this little uh birdhouse and we could hear them and then after a while they were building the nesting and the husband was always singing for the bride and the bride would come by and then then she'd fly away you know because that's how they are they're kind of hard to catch the brides and he'd sing even harder he said i got a house for you i got everything ready for you please come be my bride and she finally came and after a couple weeks then we could hear the little the little chicks they started to peep they started to peep and i said well done i said now i got to keep our eye real close on this because i said i want to watch this and after a while after about five six days all of a sudden this one little he got up and jumped on our front banister and i sat down i said i think it's one of the babies when he started to fly he just he's flapping his wing think think he doesn't know what flapping your wings means a baby when he gets up he he just there's something inside of him i don't want to crawl anymore he'll get up and he'll stand and do something because he says there's more to life than just crawling down here in the dirt amen amen and that little birdie come on he flaps his wings he went right down to the grass and i said okay boy jump because mom was sitting up in the one branch singing to him and papa was over here he was singing to him and then the other one came out and it fell down into the flowers and then we i said okay we got to stay away because we want to scare the parents away and we come back couple hours they were long gone long gone praise the lord when he saved me he started me on this and he said i'm going to take you everything that he started he's going to finish amen he's going to finish it so he says in verse 4 now there's there's a caution to this he says when you see the son of righteousness rising with healing in his wings he says then you've got to learn to walk with me you've got to learn to eat what i feed you you've got to learn these things and then he says remember ye the law of moses my servant why would he say that because up till that time moses was the greatest prophet that israel ever had not only was the greatest prophet but he was the lawgiver god god when you know miriam and aaron they they chided with moses about something and god got so mad he come down he says make them come over here by the because they're not listening very well and when they came down god came down in the pillar of fire and he said don't you even fear me what is wrong with you he says if there be a prophet amongst you if there be someone else he says i'll talk to them in dreams or i'll give them visions but he said not so with moses he said how to come down i talked from my lips right to his ears amen and it was moses god cursed miriam with uh leprosy god would have never healed her without moses's prayer moses stood in the gap for his foolish sister and god healed her so malachi when he said this remember the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel not just whoever pick and choose or whatever he says all of israel with the statutes and the judgments amen amen i want you to notice let's go over here to luke 24. this is the last chapter of the book of luke and now it's important now you could start to see so it's been 400 years since malachi has died his prophecies are read in the church services jesus has come on the scene they know that the son of righteousness is here he died which was a surprise to them he rose from the dead they're still expecting the burning of the world because that is exactly how the scriptures are written they're expecting god to destroy the world verse 41 he says and while they yet believed not for joy isn't that amazing they didn't they weren't even happy that he erased them that they were just happy because it says they wondered they were this man who had died and been dead for three days and rose from the dead and now he appears to them and they you know you would think you would be happy for joy but they were not happy for joy luke said they weren't happy for joy they were just happy because they said you know what jesus is the answer now i can go back to just doing whatever what i was doing before fighting about who's going to be the biggest one in the church now i can go back to just being because jesus here we've got any questions we get in the boat and the storm comes up we'll just call jesus so we're happy but it's not very joyful and while they believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have you hear any meat and they gave him a place of broiled fish and of a honeycomb and he took it and he did eat it before them and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the what what the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me then open he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures oh my oh my look at matthew 5 this is very familiar but you'll see they they their expectation was different because there was no prophet after malachi and that's all they had was malachi 4 to look at and when you go over to matthew 5 17 it says think not that i have come to destroy the law or the prophets i didn't come to start a new church or anything that i did not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily i sent you till heaven and earth pass one jut or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled and that's malachi 4 4. remember the law of moses with all the judgments and all the statutes and everything because heaven and earth the day of the lord verse 1 can't happen until every scripture every jot every tittle everything the prophet said everything's in the psalms everything that's in the proverbs everything that's in ecclesiastes it's all got to be fulfilled and then the end shall come amen amen because look now let's go to hebrews 10 and talk about the law of moses amen hebrews 10 verse 26 so here are these people let's presume they see the healing revival in 1946 and they come into the message well not the message but they come into the churches by like just thousands brother branham talk he thought he had a million come in come into the kingdom of god and they all came in but what if they forgot the law of moses they came in but they forgot about the law of the prophets they forgotted the statutes they forgot the judgments they forgot the history of david and daniel and the lions then and they forgot all those things in the old testament because now we're in the new testament verse 26 says for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin and how shall we know that you're sinning if you don't know the law because if there is no law there is no sin but by the law sin came in how was i to know that i was a sinner until i read the law of god and found out i was a sinner and now look at what he says he says there remaineth then no more sacrifice for sin but but i saw the healing revival i saw it yes but if you don't stick with moses and the prophets if you don't hear his voice there is no more sacrifice but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery [Music] malachi 4-1 indignation that's how god's going to destroy the world he's finally going to get fed up i'm when you're indignant you're just i've had enough fiery indignation which shall devour all they that are proud and do wickedly and they shall be stubble he that despised moses's law died without mercy under two or three witnesses how much more sore or punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the son of god and have counted the blood of the covenant where when he was sanctified an unholy thing and have done despite under the spirit of grace wow so now we've gone from the law of moses to the king of kings the lord of lords the only sacrifice that you can ever accept that'll get you into heaven and if you spit on that thing if you do anything against that how much more sore punishment look at what he says for we know that him that hath said vengeance belongeth unto me i will recompense saith the lord malachi 4 is plain that this is the day of the lord and that is god i will do these things in verse 3 that's what he said he said he said you will walk on the ashes of these people in the day that i do these things vengeance belongeth unto me i will recompense and again the lord shall judge his people it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god amen amen in the unpardonable sin 1954 brother branham said so how much more punishment will it be when under the dying lamb that a man that despised or done rejected to the law of moses when he rejected to the law of moses he had to die without mercy because the lamb had died instead how much more is that man rejected who despises the blood of jesus christ and saw the healing campaigns amen so let's go back to malachi 4. praise god so we see malachi 4 1 is a it's going to happen and then in verse 2 he says but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness so if you fear god then god will make a way for you amen but when he gets down to verse 5 now this is the third part he says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord well why isn't that verse one it should be verse one he should you know verse two should be i don't know verse six and then if the chapter should end up with when the day of the lord comes everything's gonna be done way we're gonna burn this place down but god he hides it from the wise and the prudent he puts it in there so his children can hear the voice of god when god speaks so before the dreadful day of the lord god said i will send you elijah the prophet and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse and god says there will be this this healing campaign thing happening and then also behold i will send you elijah the prophet amen i want to go here to matthew 17. praise the lord matthew 17 verse 5. so he says so while he had spake now remember the disciples james john and peter who had all gone up into the mount of transfiguration they had all been raised by their parents to believe the prophets and one of the prophets that they believed was malachi and they all knew malachi 4. they all knew malachi the scribes of pharisees quoted malachi they so so now here jesus comes and and they follow him because who else has the words to eternal life jesus goes and takes peter james and john and he takes them up to the mount transfiguration he gets them up there and verse 5 says it's important that you know that that setting it's important that you see that while he had spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice came out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and they were sore afraid because they were afraid of god they were afraid to look on god but god clearly identified who jesus was clearly identified and they fell on their face and jesus came and touched them and he said arise and be not afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead but they didn't believe that because they didn't believe he was going to die they just didn't believe that it's hard to comprehend the spiritual things of god it's just hard so he told them that he says so don't tell the vision to anybody until the son of man be again risen from the dead and the disciples starting to look back at malachi said wait a minute the scripture says because what were they looking for they were looking for malachi 4 1. they were looking for malachi 4 1 and malachi 4 5 said before i destroy the world i will send you elijah and they said well if you're christ then where's the elijah it's a reasonable question where is he where's the elijah where's he at praise the lord so verse 11 says and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things but i say unto you that elias has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist and they put john the baptist in malachi 4 5. they put him there but that isn't where he was that wasn't where he was at all and they also had forgotten the scriptures because because jesus told them he said they have done unto him whatsoever they listed or whatever was prophesied by the prophets and moses in the old testament it wasn't you got just a choice you're going to just do something it's got to be according to the scriptures because he said and the reason why i say that it says likewise shall also the son of man suffer the same death the same problem amen so they asked this question they said well if you're the son of god where is elijah so let's go to matthew 3 verse 1. so we want to go and look now remember the world did not burn up like they thought it should it didn't happen like you know they they when malachi prophesied they thought within a few years the world will burn up but it didn't and then time went on and and it just didn't happen and then finally one day jesus appeared and and they were kind of surprised well matthew 3 1 says so we're going to read all so in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judea now the last thing that jesus said in matthew 17 was the disciples then understood that he spoke about john the baptist but they thought he was elijah of malachi 4 5. and john the baptist came preaching in the wilderness of judea saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand and this is he that was spoken by the prophet isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his path straight there is no mention of elijah in that prophecy in isaiah amen let's go to luke 3. we'll come back to mark but we go to luke 3. in luke 3 starting verse 3 and it says it came into all the country about jordan and he came into all the country about jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins as it was written in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his path straight every valley shall be filled every mountain hill shall be brought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough way shall be made smooth and all flesh shall see the salvation of god because there is no other salvation outside of jesus christ amen so we have two witnesses matthew identifies john the baptist as isaiah i think it's isaiah 40 verse 3 to 5. he identifies him there luke identifies him there now let's see what mark says about him so mark chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god as it is written in the prophets behold i send my messenger before thy face which should prepare thy way before thee the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his path straight john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins but verse 2 when he says behold i will send my messenger before thy face that's not isaiah 40. that's malachi chapter 3 amen malachi 3 1. let's go there and read it because because when you see that had been 400 years they had no prophet all they had was the pharisees and the sadducees interpreting the scriptures and reading the scriptures to them they thought they had the right interpretation but malachi 3 says behold i will send my messenger that's exactly what it says behold i will send my messenger before my face and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to the temple even the messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts amen amen so we've got this little bit of a problem here now where is elijah of malachi 4 and 5 or chapter 4 5 and 6 where is that elijah because john the baptist is not malachi 4 5 and 6. so let's go here to luke 1. uh nope nope we're going to john 1. so let's listen to john's or uh yeah john the baptist let's listen to his own testimony john 1 verse 19. it says and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who art thou now you know why they asked him that question because it didn't quite fit in the scripture interpretation that they had they were they were saying wait a minute if if this is this and this is this and i'm looking here and i'm looking here because that was why the scribes and the pharisees always argued with jesus because they said wait a minute we look in the bible and you're not him because we're not born of fornication you are that's against moses's law your disciples picked corn on the sabbath day and ate it you healed a man on the sabbath day that's against the law it's against see they couldn't place him in the scriptures and so when when john showed up john showed up and it's an amazing thing he just comes down and he starts preaching and all of judea everybody they go wait wait wait wait wait wait there's a prophet there's something going on down at the river jordan and they all run out to see him and they want to place him where does he fit in the scriptures he says who art thou and he confessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ because that's who they thought he was that first thing they said are you the christ and he says nope not the christ and then they ask him what then art thou elias are you elijah and he said nope i am not art thou that prophet that comes before the great and dreadful day of the lord and he said no i'm not that one either. see they totally misplaced him in the scriptures and if you misplace john you misplace jesus and if you misplace jesus there's no salvation you have to know where you stand amen then they said unto him well who are you then we don't know what to do because we got to go tell these guys that sent us please what should what do you say about yourself and john said i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as said the prophet isaiah amen john knew who he was amen so elijah this is kind of a this is kind of jesus said he was and jesus said he's going to come first and restore all things but he's already calm and that confused him because they couldn't figure out what is he here is it gone is it calm is what what's happening here so we found out that john knew exactly who he was so i want to go to luke 1. when i when i read this scripture i knew about this but this just really blessed me luke 1 now here's zachariah zachariah and his wife elizabeth they were well old and stricken in age kind of like sister don and me or maybe brother johnson's sister johnson and they never had any kids they hadn't been but he was a faithful priest he believed the word of god he believed the law and the prophets he did his duty he came in he lit the candle and the in the shoe bread and he made sure that the lamp didn't go out inside and on the day of the sabbath day he goes in and he goes in to do the priesthood things so he goes into the outer it's it's inside the outer veil he goes in because he's not going into the holiest of holies but he's going in where the shoe bread is and where the seven golden candlestick is and the altar is and and those things and he goes in there to to do the ablation and it says according to the custom of the police office oh i got verse 11. okay so we'll skip some of that verse 11 it says and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense so he's inside there zacharias saw him and he was troubled nobody's supposed to be in here this is a sacred place what are you doing in here brother mark and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not zechariah for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he should be given he should be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine or strong drink and he should be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb wish i could have had that prophecy yeah even from his mother's womb he's going to be filled with the holy ghost and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elijah the angel identified john as elijah what a and look look go back here to malachi 4. oh it's beautiful it's a beautiful thing so verse 5 says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord so they knew if elijah shows up the dr great and dreadful day of the lord is next if he shows up and then and when john showed up they said oh this is is is he so so the romans we're not going to be under the romans anymore praise the lord praise god yes it's great to be great because we've got prophecy for it look at what verse 6 says and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children the angel in luke 1 17 says he be will go before him in the spirit and power of elijah to turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just but he misquoted the scripture because malachi 4 6 says he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the fathers but the angel didn't misquote the scripture because that elijah did just that the first half to make ready a people prepared for the lord amen amen amen amen so god has fulfilled or fulfilled the first half of malachi 4 6 in john the baptist but he didn't fulfill the second half of 4-6 he didn't and jesus at the end of luke said remember remember brothers remember sisters not one jot not one tittle not one prophecy nothing can fall to the to the ground every word has to be fulfilled before i come back now i want you to go to acts 3. when we go to acts 3 we find out that this is a sermon that peter made and peter had already given that prophecy in this in second peter he peter knew that when the day of the lord came the world was going to be destroyed by fire and and we read that but peter here um we're going to start at verse 18. he says but those things which god before had showed by the mouth of all of his prophets that christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled remember ye the law of moses and peter is quoting that to the jews he says so repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord because the time of refreshing hadn't come if they weren't born again and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you went whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which god had spoken by the mouth of all of his holy prophets since the world began so when peter quotes this he's telling them everything that malachi 4 talks about he said if you see the healing revival rejoice rejoice when you see it but remember the law of moses and the prophets i wonder why because it had been lost it had been destroyed it had been mixed up in all these ages but when god brought elijah on the scene when after 1945 that's why he only let them go as far you know i mean it wasn't long and russia had the nuclear weapons and what was stopping them from dropping them somewhere what was stopping anybody from what's stopping a terrorist from dropping a nuclear weapon all the word of god has to be fulfilled and the second half of malachi 4 must be fulfilled because it says if i don't do it look at malachi 4 6 he says if i don't send you elijah and let him restore everything if i don't do that i will come and smite the earth with a curse and no one will be saved no one will be saved why would god do this with elijah because elijah is the only prophet that you can find in the old testament that called fire down from heaven that was that was one of his gifts and one of the things he did when the children of israel had lost their way and forgotten the law of moses and everything else and they were following after baal and everything else and and they were blind and naked and cold and and they didn't know it they didn't know if they were just they were exactly hostile they didn't even know it god had an elijah come and repair the altar he repaired the altar and he showed him he showed him he went and got the sacrifice he put the sacrifice on there he poured the water on there he poured all kinds of water on there when water was a very very precious thing because it didn't rain in three years it's pretty precious i want to know where they got all that water from i think that king ahab was hoarding it yeah you know how the rich hoard stuff and then so he came and they poured it all on there and elijah said he said now let them know that i have done all these things at thy command and he said then the fire came down that's malachi 4 5 and 6. the fire can't fall till everything is restored everything is back in its perfect place everything is in order every one of you is in the right place amen the whole elect god knows where his seat is mama eagle knew where every eaglet was he knew where you were sister linda he knew he knew where we all were he knew where we were at right by the ferguson he knew where we were at but when it's all completely restored and elijah can say i've done everything you told me to do believe me the fire is going to fall amen amen amen that's bar heads lord jesus lord so many so many years we've just looked at malachi 4 and just looked at verse 5 and 6 but we find that there's a great message in the whole chapter there's a great message in the whole book lord you're hidden in simplicity in many different places but we're so grateful tonight that lord you could open our understanding and father you could show us these things lord let us take that warning if you misplace john you can't find christ and if we misplace the elijah in this age where's no salvation there's no salvation this world is quickly it's going like a madman right to hell it's it's just falling apart around us but lord you already gave us a promise you already gave us a promise you would watch over us you would keep us i pray lord that you just lord let us consider these things and may you just speak to us help us lord to just walk with you and
