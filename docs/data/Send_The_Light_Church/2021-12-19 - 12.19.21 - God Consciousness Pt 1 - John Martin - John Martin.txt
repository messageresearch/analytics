promised to be here [Applause] just just two of us gathered think about that he doesn't have the same expectations that we would all like which is we'd like everybody to be here and if they're not here we're not going to have a good service jesus said just two of you we're going to have a good service amen praise the lord turn with me if you would to the book of philippians uh brother timothy o'shawn sends his greetings and also brother samson from india um often when we talk to them they always say send the greetings to the church and it's it's hard every time they say it because we're in contact with so many so often but just so you know that those missionaries that we're supporting overseas they pray for us they love us and they want always us to know that they're praying for us they love us and they're saying their greetings to us so if i say that that way when i miss it it's covered amen we want to re i don't know if it been announced but there's no service next sunday and that our christmas service is this wednesday coming up december 22nd and it's also we're going to have a baptism uh during that that service and we're grateful for what god is doing in our midst amen amen before we begin reading in philippians chapter 2 let's look to the author of this this holy book amen heavenly father we stand here today absolutely unworthy of you lord we thank you that you've given us power to cast out demons and in your name we cast out all demons of unbelief in our life and our thoughts anything that's been contrary to your mind we cast that out right now in the name of jesus we thank you've given us that power we cast out all doubts that we may have faith in your word today cleanse us wash us of all of our sins lord lord as we approach your sacred book lord we don't want to to be watered down we want it to be roasted with the holy ghost we want to be able to take this word with revelation we don't want to try to lead our own understanding try to make it fit to the way we think lord we're depending on you to come in your great power and reveal your word to us be with those that are sick and afflicted many not here today because of sickness lord realize that you touch their bodies that you be with them in their homes and lord that you would do a work there inside of them both their bodies their spirits and their hearts and minds lord bless this word now as we look to you and give you the praise for all that you desire to do that you will do in the service today we ask in jesus christ's name amen amen philippians chapter 2 i love these scriptures are very familiar very helpful for us if there be if there be therefore any consolation in christ if there be any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels of mercies fulfill god's joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one accord and of one mind now we want to do a series on god's consciousness so he wants us to be of one mind let nothing now here is the the mind of god the the the uh the god's conscious mind that nothing would be done through strife not just uh a little thing here and there you don't understand no let nothing be done through strife let nothing be done to give you just a little bit of glory personally that's the mind of god but in lowliness of mine take the time to esteem somebody better than yourself and look not every man on hey let's just talk about what i want no uh but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in in the form of god thought in that robbery to be equal with god but he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross and god bless you may be seated so think that you know a lot of times um you know jesus could jesus could have just walked around said you know i'm god you better listen to me or i'm just gonna wave my magic ron and destroy you no but he became the other part of god which was meek and lowly and humble and a servant the things we don't we god is an invisible spirit and we don't know who he is until we look into the face of jesus christ and then we know the very nature of god and so there's this part of god that he was willing to become because he was all of all of god was poured into jesus right yes and now all that was in christ is being poured into the church and now if i say it like this it is poured into the church but now she's learning to become all of christ in the process god consciousness let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus human consciousness is the awareness of one's own existence sensations thoughts feelings and the of the surroundings that's human consciousness so we are aware that we're in this church we're sitting by who we're sitting um we know why we came here we know how we're feeling we know the feelings we have the thoughts that we have we're we're we're conscious of a sound mind in that department some people are self-conscious that someone who's extremely or excessively aware of being observed by others like i know you're all observing me but when i become self-conscious that's all i'm thinking about and then there's god consciousness is the acute awareness of the definition is the acute awareness of god's thoughts desires intentions in what's presently happening we can know that god would god it was in god's mind to build an ark to keep it from reigning for so long that made people to just question whether god could make it rain and then he builds the ark and he and he does it but if we were back then we would say god would never do that you know god would never have some people walk around the walls of jericho seven times god would never have some men put a light in a lantern just walk around god would never take 30 000 men and bring it down to 300. god does it is it like that this series is to help us open our mind to more of being god-conscious we need to be more god-conscious how many times have we thought we knew what god wanted and found out that we were wrong many times how many times have we thought god spoke something to us but found out it didn't quite happen that way too often we think that we have god's mind on the subject only to find out that it was just our thoughts or the thoughts that the enemy put in our head satan disguises himself all the time trying to get us confused in our mind in our lives that's his purpose he's trying to get us to confess something that was of god when it wasn't why so our very light can call god a liar see because see satan don't have a problem coming to to god and calling him a liar oh yeah yeah the only reason job's serving you is because you're doing this calling him a liar and he he he wants to get inside of us so we mock the same god come on he's trying to get us comfortable satan's trying to get us comfortable with being double-minded unstable and it really doesn't matter satan don't have a problem with all the thoughts that we get thinking we have the mind of christ when simply we just have our own mind on the subject how many times have you heard people say god told me this and you know it's not even scriptural how can it be god when it's not scriptural we've all had that we've all heard that every single one of us here we've all experienced this so if god has done it in others or or or satan has deceived others that we see it's happening in others who are we to say that it couldn't happen in us thank you for that amen because that's the thing we need to consider where we're at this this sermon is for us amen how could god ever tell us anything that wasn't according to his word oh i'll tell you satan he did it to eve he does it to us if he did it to when there was just adam and eve just two people his own creation how much more would satan try to do it to us he's if he was capable to do it to eve he's much more capable to do it to us and the subject about baptism a man told me one time because the the bible uh if you don't understand the bible correctly it almost sounds like there's two different ways to get baptized according to the bible but there's only one way i had a man tell me one time he said i'd rather take the way that jesus said to get baptized which is father son holy ghost titles verses over how the apostles said but that's the carnality i had another man tell me one time he says it really didn't matter which way you get baptized as long as you get baptized when the bible clearly makes it known to us that there's no other name given among men the name of jesus christ whereby we must be saved people need to be more god conscious some people don't believe in anything of the old testament like it's completely done away with for instance the old testament commands us that we shouldn't commit adultery we can't do away with that the mind of christ never did away with that in fact the mind of christ said in matthew 5 28 here's the mind of christ matthew 5 28 says but i say unto you that whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her what already in his heart i'll tell you we all should be stoned we all deserve to be stoned right here by the by what christ was saying the new testament magnifies the word of god the mind of god if brother mark got up here and he said you know it's okay to drink liquor and to take recreational drugs we would know that brother mark would not have the mind of god on that subject even though he may think that it's okay man came by when we were working on the church and he was looking for a church that believed in drinking i don't know who was here when that happened but somebody some of you some of somebody was here and uh well he's never been here because we're just not that church we could have a man-made church and we could just decide get together have a committee what would you like this church to be we'll just kick god right out and we'll have church the way you want to have it but there would be no power of god in that church if my wife stood up and said god told me that i was called to be a preacher of the gospel with you and to be a co-pastor with you we would know that she would not have the mind of christ on that subject because god said in genesis chapter 3 verse 16 that thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and if she stood up and said well that's just the old testament we're in the new testament now we would still know that she was not god conscious on the subject why because paul told timothy in first timothy chapter 2 verse 11 let the woman learn in silence but i suffer not in other words i don't allow a woman to teach nor to usurp to take authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression we can't get any more old testament than that here's paul in the new testament bringing up something to happen in the old testament a lot of believers think they are god conscious about things but when you take it back to the word we learn that it's just satan in disguise why are there times that we wouldn't consider laying down our lives for someone to disciple someone that we have a problem with i'd rather disciple somebody i don't got a problem with why would we not consider it because we're not god conscious enough see how we done we start to make our own personal religion in our church because we are the church god wants us to be god conscious not john conscious not self-conscious not human conscious but god conscious very important thing to remember is be careful be very careful about saying god told me god showed me god revealed to me god i'm not saying don't believe it what i'm saying is be careful about saying it keep it between you and god how many times have we said those things only to learn it wasn't him but yet we just keep doing it we're not learning what we're doing is satan is getting us to mock god that sometimes he's right sometimes he's wrong and to go on as if no big deal oh we just you must not beat him so no big deal but look what we did we testified to somebody we testified to somebody that god was turned out to be a liar and we would never say that would we so be careful about saying that satan uses us as a vessel of god to just mock god and we don't want that branham taught us what god consciousness was when he said that we always should have a spirit that says i could be wrong i could be wrong through this series god will provide all of us an opportunity to become more god-conscious but it's up to us it's not just the knowledge of the truth but it's our behavior and how we handle things the more proud a believer is because we're believers right the more proud we are the more we're going to miss the mind of christ why because god giveth the grace of revelation to the humble we can sit here and say i'm not going to move i'm not going to do nothing you can't br how is god going to help us with a proud spirit but he'll the bible says he gives more grace to the humble lord if this is you talking to me lord show me open my eyes give me revelation amen praise god now we need some more amen today because we're missing some people today so you know what happens um like um when anne is gone on vacation somebody's got to pick up her duties and and so when somebody's missing here we got to pick up their duties and so we need more amens we need to enter into the word amen now when we were born we were born without the mind of god we're not hey we got to say amen quicker because we got a lot of a lot of hay here to to push when i look back at all the stupid things i did in my life how can i say that was the mind of god i was totally nuts i thought it was right when i did it i thought i was cool i felt good i i i got people's attention all the things i did when i was younger i still do sometimes i thought it was right but i was actually nuts you ever steal something you think you're right ever do harm to somebody and think you're right that's nuts ephesians chapter 2 verse 12 says that at that time in our life we were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenant of promise having no hope and without god in the world can't get any closer than that we're without christ without god but yet we thought we were right just because we came to christ doesn't mean we spent the whole uh the rest of our the life before then thinking we were wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong i'm so wrong i just need to find christ no we didn't want christ we didn't care about christ we were right just fine don't mind your own business please but the bible tells us that we were without him we without the mind of christ verse 3 of the same chapter says among whom also we all that's all of us here had our conversation in the times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and look and of the mind and we're by nature children of just fighting with one another to get what you wanted i don't get what i want i'm going to turn you off even as others our very nature abhorred the thought of being submissive to god's will we ran away from it on top of all that we thought we were right when we were doing it how many people are not coming to church today haven't been to church in a while because they simply don't want to come under subjection to the word of god and they think they're right staying home proverbs chapter 21 verse 2 says every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the lord pondereth the hearts i'm so glad that you have enough love in your heart to have god come deal with our hearts today dropping down to ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 but god who is rich in mercy for his great love for what he loved us even when we were dead in those sins he's quickened us together with christ i like that quickened us together he didn't say quickened us god wants us together he wants us to be a family amen and have raised us up again together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus when we have been uh he is the blood of christ has made us i just i i think about and if it be the will of god i believe it it is we want to have some some services on parenting and one thing i remember um brother joseph saying to me about how his dad handled uh confusion and things that was trying to take place in his home and he would said brother brandon would just get us and set us down and and just settle us down and he would just set us down and he would just settle us down and he said it like that and that was the end of it settling the spirit you know god just wants us to get together in heavenly places just get with him in heaven everything will be okay if we just get in heavenly places with christ jesus not going off on our own thing got our own things just settle it down instead of everybody going in 13 different directions god this god i'm over no god wants us together unified the same mind let this mind that was in christ be in you and when the holy ghost came upon us our old nature began to die and a new nature began to be quickened romans 8 11 says but if that spirit of but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwells in you so god is in this and what is he doing he's working he's quicken us he's making us to be more like him he's just not drawing there and saying i'm there he's not a picture on a wall he's a living god he's quaking in us he's doing a work inside of us not he he just did a work he's doing a work he will do a work it's a process as god's nature is developed old things the bible says is passed away a new thing and all things become new this quickening of the holy ghost i want to say this is the process of being born again we begin to think more like god to obey more god first peter chapter 1 verse 22 says seeing you purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brothers and see that you love one another fervent with a pure heart fervently so if the holy ghost is inside of us and it automatically happens the seed just comes up automatically which it does it's all god it's not us it's all god but if it is just all god without any of us then why would peter say see that because if we don't see it happening in our life if we don't see that love just coming more and more and laying down our lives for others and and and esteeming others better than ourselves if we don't see that something is wrong verse 23 being born again not of a corruptible seed but incorruptable by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever we're going to get a little a little deeper into what it means to be born again but when we're born again it doesn't mean that everything that we do now is completely of god it doesn't mean everywhere we go god is leading us to go there it doesn't mean everything that we hear it's god telling us it doesn't mean the way we act all the time the way we talk all the time the way we think all the time is god being born again it has a beginning it has a process and don't you ever think it has an end for you that is the biggest problem with saying i'm born again the statement i'm born again can be so deceptive when we say i've got my hunting license i got a car i got a gun i got a bottle of water that's all there is to the subject but when we say we're born again what we ought to be thinking in that statement is god has started to work in us and he's in the process of bringing about his divine nature throughout our lives not oh yeah i'm born again i'm a christian message born again it's like end of deal to god it's not the end of deal job said i will not be satisfied to awaken his likeness the bible says that one day we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is there is a process that we're in the middle of and we need to focus on the things that is not happening in our life that god wants to happen right amen god wants us to focus on getting the things out of her life that we haven't gotten out of i mean he's happy i got rid of my smoking my drugs my rock and roll he's happy with that but there's still things in my life he wants out there's still things he wants in my life in so i'm in the process i'm not saying i haven't been born again but too many of us satan wants us to look at i'm born again then it doesn't matter what you do doesn't matter what you do you're still born i spoke in tongues i got the holy ghost doesn't matter what you do everything is about i'm already there never i'm in the process of becoming more light that should be the the true christian's greatest desire is to grow in grace to grow in this nature to better handle things the way jesus did if that hunger and that thirst for god's righteousness isn't in our lives how are we going to be filled i'll say it like god told the philippian church he which have begun a good work in you shall perform it unto the day of jesus christ the reason that our flesh doesn't like this ministry here is because it simply challenges us too much our flesh wants to feel like it doesn't have to die anymore to do anymore to lay down his life anymore to disciple anymore that's what our flesh wants it always wants to feel good enough i'm already born again enough it's the truth that's why our flesh doesn't like it we like something that makes us feel good well that ain't god consciousness necessarily that could just be human consciousness the ministry is not for our flesh that's what we need to remember as much as we'd like it to be at times this ministry here is for the perfecting of our character amen if i could say it like this it's for the perfecting of the new birth people don't like to look at it as there's anything more than i've been born again well there was more to jesus being born then that day in the the cave there was more to jesus than being born jesus said or god yeah jesus said for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son not just borne him into the world he said for this purpose i came to give his life so there's more to it than just saying i'm born again it's the beginning it is the beginning of god's nature coming inside of you now you're going to become obedient to the complete will of god that's what the new birth is and we're going to come back to this i'll say very extremely important point but i want to get a little bit of encouragement in just in case we don't get back in time what i want to say is don't ever let the devil tell you that you cannot have the mind of christ you're in control of how much you want to be god conscious we're told in control whether or not the mind of christ will operate through us or not paul said let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus let you have control you may not know what god's what the outcome is going to be what the answer is going to be but you know how he wants you to act so god told abraham i i'm i'm taking you to a land that's gonna you're gonna inherit the bible says he didn't even know where he was going he didn't walk around say god told me god told me the only thing god told him was go come out from your p and go and he marched in obedience in fact he went past where he should have went and had to come back we may not know exactly what god wants us to do in everything everywhere about every but we know how to act till he gets there we know how to put one foot on the front of the other and say i'm gonna be obedient to what you told me until you tell me more god has never called any of us to figure out to be scientists with the word of god and try to figure out the mind of christ no he's looking for obedience jesus himself said i do nothing except what the father shows me first it's very humbling to think like this that this is the mind of christ we are the only ones that can stop god consciousness in us romans chapter 6 verse 16 says know ye not that to whom you healed yourself servants to obey his servant you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience under righteousness i'll be honest with you i have obeyed the devil before thinking i was doing the will of god how disgusting for john martin that's for me that's how i feel about it and i yielded to it it was absolutely wrong every time we fly off the handle every time we want to throw in the towel it's not the mind of the lord there's a lot to be said about letting the mind of christ in but i want to say the first thing that we have to do to let god's mind is we have to deny our own mind both coexist in our life and satan says it's okay that way he's okay with both coexisting he believes in closest but it's not okay with god he is not okay with both coexisting romans eight verse seven says the carnal mind is enmity it god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so just being in your flesh can't even please god it can't coexist this is what god wants colossians chapter 1 verse 18 jesus christ is the head of the body which is the church who is the beginning of the firstborn of the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence jesus don't want to coexist with our carnality with our pride with our opinions with the way that we want to do things our selfish nature wants total control and there should be such a love in our heart to want god to have control of our lives so i want to say that the mind of christ is not operational or preeminent in every believer or every professed believer joshua and caleb were two people that let the mind of christ in them amen the other preachers couldn't humble themself enough to be willing to suffer to do the will of god the will of god was go take the land go get the giants out i've given you that land but they were too proud they were too scared to be willing to suffer that chance you understand you know where flesh doesn't want to suffer the other preachers viewed themselves as grasshoppers in their sight and in the sight of the giants these other preachers were walking by sight not by faith they were walking in the flesh and not in the spirit second corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare they're not carnal but they're mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds i mean we're dealing with the same giants they they they look like giants in our in our sight how am i going to overcome this situation how am i going to overcome this bad habit in my life how am i going to overcome this flesh this carnality this will well we're knowing here what to do casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ now that's the mind of god right there that's god consciousness and having a readiness something about you ready get set go and having a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled amen like i come to church i'm ready for the word i'm ready i'm so sick and tired of what this flesh gets me in to it was a real battle for joshua and caleb they weren't there just sit there there's no big thing that was a battle but they chose the mind of christ they let the mind of christ in were more than able they said they just agreed with the word they didn't make a new word up they didn't hear a different word they heard the same word the same word that god told they just agreed with it they stayed with it they didn't question it the mind of christ is always doing the will of god it's having a readiness to revenge all disobedience and often that includes suffering they were willing to suffer to see the will of god prevail it was the will of god for them to take the land it wasn't like you know we want to we give gifts out at christmas right and sometimes we get a gift for christmas or for our birthday that you know we kind of turn our nose up a little bit like what am i going to do with that you obviously don't know me and they the children of israel they looked at this promised land as you don't really know me i can serve god over here on this side of jordan you can't do that to god's gifts that's why when sister cheryl was saying we all got gifts god doesn't ever expect us to take our gifts and bury him he said occupy till i come occupy shall i come and give you further word when we let the mind of christ be in us we're not just letting the right doctrine in but we're letting the right spirit in so we can handle the situation the right way that to me is what we need the bible says a false balance is an abomination to the to the lord right and and and and doctrine like strong meat it can choke choke you what there should be a greater hunger in all of us is for the spirit of the living god inside of us so we can live out our situations the right way paul said let all things be done decently and in order that's a very tall order that's the mind of christ that's god consciousness it's not just being right and doctrine but right in your spirit so that means being humble lowly me self-sacrificing obedient merciful loving at all times so you just let this mind be in you except this is the will of god for your life not well i know i should be doing it's kind of hard something i've been growing into the last 30 years no you need to start saying as a believer i believe i can do all things through christ who strengthens me that i am an overcomer that this is the day i put my foot here and take this mountain you know we want to get uh spiritual and religious and and and and in in in certain things and other things we just kind of push under the rug god needs you on the front line living the life that's where he needs you he don't need you in some dark room developing your intelligence amen i want to get back to my point we established in our earlier net hopefully is going to continue next year but god consciousness is that the mind of god will always be pressing to manifest all of god's will when if i take this statement how many believes that god wants you to be just like jesus how many believes that jesus wants you to be just like him raise your hand i know you believe it to be the truth yes good scripture be holy even as i am holy now the thing is we're not there why are we satisfied with that why are we content with just i'm in the message i believe the word i i believe this part of the word what about the other part their emphasis and our desires needs to be there that's the mind of christ let the mind that was in christ be in you the mind of christ doesn't want us to stop after repentance or baptism he wants us to go on to perfection the very characteristic of god's mind is not to go halfway to be lukewarm to be wishy-washy double-minded up and down that is not the mind of christ the mind of christ will always be leading us higher than where we're at to manifest more than we're manifesting not just being in the present truth but walking towards the truth that we don't have yet god didn't stop with me just because i got baptized just because i found the message no the word of god says that when he the spirit of truth he will lead and guide me into all truth now that's not all knowledge of the truth that's all the nature of the living god living in me amen now in order for that to happen i gotta learn to die out i gotta learn to say no i'm not doing this so god can come in i just thinking you know god can't do anything until you agree with the word god can't help you with your situation until you say and i'm so disgusted with it i'm done with this i want you god and then god can come in the bible says the whole creation groaneth and travails and pain they're waiting for what the manifestation of you and me not the knowledge not for the sons and daughters to get the knowledge but to get the manifestation of that knowledge if the whole creation is groaning why are we so satisfied with only manifesting the little right just a question just a question the more we let the mind of christ operate through us the more of god's nature will be manifested the old nature will be dying at the same time the new nature will be growing it just happens simultaneously the old nature of strife vain glory building our own reputation esteeming ourselves will die out at the same time the nature of humility lowliness will grow into the new mind of christ being like-minded having the same love being a one accord in one mind esteeming others more caring about others more serving others more loving others more christ took upon him the form of a servant amen preaching to others is not the form of a servant that paul was referring to here it's not jesus did more than become a preacher jesus laid down his life for us he became a servant to all his life preached the mind of christ inside of us will operate the very same way it's not going to change he's the same yesterday today and forever first john 3 16 hereby perceive ye the love of god because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for who for who brethren when's the last time you lay down your life for your brother think about that let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus you know the mind of christ is not stuck on self i tell you if the mind of christ ever gets stuck it's stuck on others it's stuck on living for others if you're going to get stuck ever back in the day we used to play records some of you have never seen a record before but it gets to the one spot and it just plays over and over and over and over you just get so mad at it there's one area that i believe all heaven wants us to get stuck on is living for others just get stuck on it now when paul addressed this letter to the philippian church he addresses it to the not only to the unbelievers and the babes in christ but the bible says that he addressed it to the bishops and the deacons so this let the mind be in you which was also in christ he was addressing this to the deacons as well as to the bishops and he said in verse 6 and i've quoted it being confident this very thing he which began a good work in you will perform it he will execute it he will complete it until the day of jesus christ so he's sending a message that is a continuation be confident he's going to continue to perform the work paul didn't believe in just coming out of egypt or just stopping at the red sea paul believed in pressing towards a mark and growing into the statue of a perfect man the perfecting of the saints he said let us go on unto perfection not can you imagine you're going to go brother just take for instance brother mark is someone i've never met before i seen him he just acts so worldly and so ungodly and i come up to brother mark and i say brother mark let's go on to perfection he's gonna think i'm crazy and none of us witness like that we find out where they're at we try to work on something a little bit lower and bring them to that place when paul's telling the hebrew church or the writer might have been luke let us go on to perfection he was talking to a mature church we need to have the mind of let's go forward amen not just let's hear a word that's more forward a new doctrine a new thing to make us feel like we got something that we didn't have when we didn't come but our lives our nature being able to live something today that it couldn't live yesterday that's the perfection that god is looking for philippians chapter one verse nine this i pray so he's speaking to the bishops and deacons and all the saints that philip he says this i pray that your love your love may abound should have brought my ball yet more and more in the knowledge and in all judgment think about that your love would abound in the knowledge and in the judgment a lot of times we judge others without love a lot of times we just eat up knowledge without love but the message that's being given is that our love needs to abound more and more in other words i don't care bishops and deacons how much love you got you need more you need to bound more we need to think about manifesting this word that word abound this means super abound think about superman you think nobody can do that but superman super abound only the bride can super abound in love it's the truth only the bride will have that it means to superbound to excel in quality and quantity to be excessive to be super fluish not just a little more and be done with it oh yeah i'll do this just be done with it i'm sorry that's not the right spirit but more and more paul told the thessalonian church in chapter 4 verse 1 he says furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the lord jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please god so that ye would abound more and more how many times have you had the spirit i know how to walk with god i know how to please god thinking that was enough that's human consciousness but god's consciousness is is we need to go on from that i know as as a father of my children and we just had our like our christmas time yesterday and of course you look at your children as they as they grow and you just get thoughts and as a father i want all my children to be beyond ah i'm not gonna it's just in me to see them better than me i i told my son jonathan that he thought i was crazy it'd be impossible i'm sorry i would not let my mind go any lower than that i won't i will believe for what the bible says for me to believe whether they choose or not that's their own business god wants us to be just like him and he's depending on us to put away our flesh and the previous chapter chapter 3 verse 12 the bible says on the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men even as we do toward you so to make you increase and abound in love so when you leave church you're supposed to feel like man i gotta increase my love i gotta i gotta bound in this i gotta give more because that's the mind of christ but when we come to church we've been so down so bad so without being in his presence that i just need so much encouragement today and you know that's great i'm all for that but we can't remain there we can't remain there if we may remain there we're getting away from being god-conscious from the mind of christ a lot of times we're in this state we're in because we're willingness we're not willing to humble ourselves and spend time suffering on our knees to get a hold of god because the bible says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength we come to church for strength but why don't we just do what the bible says wait on the lord well i don't got that kind of time we're talking about being god conscious verse 10 philippians chapter 1 says that ye may approve the things that are excellent approve them that's excellent you did an excellent job that ye that ye may be sincere approve it that you may be sincere and without offense how long do i got to do this for to the day of jesus christ he doesn't want us to be offensive i don't know how to do it brother don get on your knees get a hold of god don't tell me how much you know god be god be be god we're gonna go through all of our life and say i don't know i don't think we should say i don't know we should be saying really i don't want it that bad god wants us to have his mind just let the mind of christ start with this is what god wants me to do i'm ready to to revenge all disobedience when this obedience is fulfilled i'm casting down every imagination every high thought that exalted itself saying i can't do it i'm going to take these giants i can live the life of christ i asked the question today without offense that you may be sincere are you still offending today are you still being pretentious are you still building your reputation i say the mind of god we need to super bound in god's love we need to excel in in sincerity we need to humble ourselves to grow with becoming more born again instead of just saying i'm born again i'm born again lay off me i'm born again i'm being more born let your word be born in the stable of my heart i don't know if we're going to get through all this but we just want to take our time galatians chapter 3 verse 29 galatians chapter 3 verse i should say verse 24. we're going to read through galatians 4 19. just this our theme now and our thought is to have all of christ's nature in inside of us and this is the the main we're going to be getting into church order and different things about god's consciousness but the one thing that i want us to establish is as a firm foundation well i want us to always number one believe that it can happen and number two that the mind of christ is always growing it's we're just not there we the more we can say i need more i'm missing god help me god fill me god open my eyes he told those pharisees he says because you say you see you're blind if you would say i'm blind and i need help then you would see it's an attitude thing and the quicker we humble ourselves to say i just want more of you lord nobody's downgrading what we have what we're doing is trying to kick out the attitude in the spirit that says i have enough i'm born again enough i'm thankful for that we're all born again thankful i'm believe we're in the process don't ever get to the place where you think it's ended come hungering as much as the first day somebody told you about jesus because that's where growth can really take place galatians chapter 3 verse 24 wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to unto christ that we might be justified by faith so it had its purpose right but after faith is called we're no longer under the schoolmaster because what we know the faith is the voice of god spoken to us personally before the bible the law said do this so we don't so we do it don't do that we don't do it that just brought us to christ now faith we have faith which is christ speaking to us now once christ speaks to us it becomes a revelation understand but after faith has come we're no longer under the schoolmaster but you know everybody's not there christ has come but christ has not come to everybody yet that's why some people when they come in here they say oh i believe in jesus and uh the the the the guy like i say a guy comes in here he's got long hair he's wearing shorts he's got earrings in his ears he's got a a a a whiskey breath all over him smoke all over his clothes and he says i i know jesus well i'm not going to debate the question but i know he needs more and you know that too and you just got to believe that there's things in you maybe you don't even know yet that needs to be more christ and when you hear jesus speak the truth speak to you you'll know then when faith comes and speaks for year all the children of god by faith in jesus christ for as many of you as have been baptized into christ you've put on christ right by one spirit we're all baptized into there is neither jew nor greek there's neither bond or free there's neither male or free meal for all are one in christ jesus and if he be christ then are you abraham's seed and errors according to the promise chapter 4 verse 1 now i say that the heir as long as he's a child he's no different than a servant though he's heir to be lord of all think about that so there's a time in our walk with christ that even though we're a son of god we always was the son of god we're born again we haven't come to the place of maturity yet are you with me but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of who the pastor no your time what you think your opinion no how many times does your child say oh i'm ready for it i can do it no it's appointed of the father he's the one that tells you when you're ready so that word tutors and governors it's like a commissioner a manager a guardian a steward or an overseer even so we when we were children we were in bondage on the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons in other words we'll take our place god sends his son into our hearts look at him because your sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart so what's he doing he's crying abba father i belong to you i'm your son i recognize my position my place wherefore thou are no more a servant but a son you've taken a position and if a son then you're an heir through christ right where joint heirs were christ how be it then now notice this how be it then when you knew not god you did the service unto them which were by nature no gods so when we didn't we didn't know god we we our whole nature we just served our own gods but after that ye have known god or rather are known of god how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements where unto you desire again to be in bondage how can we go back in the world and the things of just trying to become perfect in christ through works or carnality our own mindset he says you observe days and months and times and years i'm afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labor in vain you know you can labor in vain paul labored a lot in vain in one sense he did he said i became all things to all men that i might win film but you have to to everybody so the other sense is not vain but in one sense to the people who the people who reject it it's in vain to them it really is brother and i beseech you be as i am for i am as you are you have not injured me at all you know that through infirmity of my flesh i preached the gospel unto you at the first in my temptation which was in my flesh he despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of god even as jesus as christ jesus wherein is that blessing that she spoke of what happened i bear you record that if it had been if it had been possible you would have plucked out your own eyes and give them to me so you were at a place in christ that you should have been what happened to that he said am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you i'll be honest with you that's why i'm not afraid if everybody hates me if i'm interested in friendship i shouldn't be at this pulpit that's not what that's for i'm so glad paul told us the truth i'm so glad brother branham told us the truth i'm so glad for every man that tells us the truth they zealously affect you but not well yay they would exclude you that ye might affect them now he's talking about other people but it is a good to be zealous and affected always in a good thing and not only when i'm present with you i'll get this next verse my little children of whom i travail in birth again how long how long i've accepted christ isn't that good enough no until christ be formed in you there was an expectation that god has it's the completion of that new birth and it don't say don't ever think that it's good enough until you're out of here cause that's what gets us in trouble that's what makes us put down the guard and just doesn't matter anymore because i'm saved i'm in the message um there should be something in every one of us that's travailing in birth until we see christ formed in us until we see christ formed in one another there should be one theme among us let christ be formed in this more not being satisfied with having church that's not it just could be a domination just go make the best entertainment the best church you want to have god's god's mind is for us to be totally christ wouldn't it be nice if people looked at you and they mistake you for jesus that's what we want that should be our goal of course we'd correct them wouldn't we amen it's late i want to stop there paul said when i was a child i thought like a child but when i became to my place in christ i put away childish thinking human consciousness and i became more god-conscious god is calling us into that realm to be more god-conscious not taking away anything where we're at praise god for it but he's calling us higher and the more that we have the attitude i know that's where god wants me the more we'll hunger for it the more we'll thirst for it and i'll tell you like this i believe the more we'll get revelation of it and then the more it'll be manifested inside of us and that's what it's all it's all about i'd rather have be able to live more of the life of christ than to ever know any more new things to live more is so much better than to know more so when i listen to those tapes it's all about living more it ain't about knowing more brother branham said he what did he say about those tapes he said rapturing faith lays in the tapes it's given us faith to get ready right because he's coming back for himself a bride without spot or wrinkle only thing she's taking with her is her character so it's not we're not getting more of this out of the message we're getting more faith to believe what we know to be the truth to live that life the bible says the bride his wife have made herself ready that's where you come in you he that have this hope in him he purifies himself he's getting ready let's stand together god bless you praise the lord praise the lord for his wonderful word i want to be god conscious next time somebody says to you um god told me this and you know it's not the word it's just right there in the word it's an obvious thing and you see that happen step back and say how could somebody be so convinced of something when they're so wrong it's important to ask that question because it happens to us it happens to us if it can happen to them it can happen to us and it just teaches us teaches me to have a humble spirit i could be wrong i could be wrong the way i'm seeing this and this just opens the door for god's mind to come into me that's letting the mind of christ in amen to be like jesus on earth i long to be like him [Music] all through life's journey from earth to glory [Music] to be like him to be like jesus to be like jesus [Music] on earth all through life's journey from earth to glory [Music] i only eye to be like him to be like jesus to be like jesus [Music] earth i love to be like him all through life's journey from [Music] amen what a precious desire
