appropriate song to enter into the service today in fact I had just written it down right before I um came up here to sing at the end of the service um and then the Lord was just using our brother after he started said a few things and it just I just it just melted me began to cry because I I believe with faith God is here and as long as he's here I'm okay he he can use all the imperfect vessels that there is as long as he's here yeah without him no matter how perfect everything is you're still missing the most important ingredient amen well God bless you it's good to be in God's Health amen and uh you believe too that's why you're here today in my my prayer desires that God would help all of us to be connected closer to him amen that's what it's all about it's just we got to get prepared for the catching away uh turn with me if you would in the in the Bible uh Romans chapter 1 Romans chapter one we got three scriptures three scriptures to read as we're turning there first is Romans 1 the next is Galatians chapter 2. and then third is Corinthians second Corinthians chapter five uh brother Andrew Glover will be with us in March Amen brother Daniel Darko will be with us in April amen brother Gerald Ward will be with us in may talk to him uh this week and he asks us to remember his wife Cheryl who got in a car accident and totaled the car and has a concussion and has some back injuries so if we could just remember her she he has prayed for all of us and for so many people let's pray for for his wife amen God bless her um today we want to speak on eyes of faith we want to look at faith more than just I got faith for this situation or I've got faith in my heart I want to take a look at having eyes of Faith to where we continuously look at things through eyes of Faith just a little bit different um but here in our opening scripture uh this let's well let's look to the Lord in in prayer and then we'll we'll read his the scriptures Heavenly Father Lord we counted a great privilege to be your sons and your daughters today that you called us out of a world of sin and you that you brought us into your Marvelous Light and by the grace of God we're all here today because you have called us you have Justified us you have Sanctified us and you have set us apart Lord for the work of your kingdom and Lord Jesus we just want to be used more by you yes Lord we want you to use each uh each of us Lord to win somebody for the cause of Christ Lord you paid such a great price at Calvary shortly Lord you give us the Grace today to pick up our cross and go share the gospel with somebody father as we've gathered together this morning Lord those of that that were able Lord together together in this place those that are able to gather together around the computer Lord to live stream father we just asked that the great Holy Spirit would come today and reveal yourself to us in a much more closer way just take the the bread of life Lord the words that would be spoken May there be something in this message as I believe there is for each and every one of us just Quicken it to us in our personal relationship with you father that your kingdom may be further that our relationship with you may be closer and that we'll walk out of this place Lord just better children of God children that you're more pleased with children that you're more happier with God we committed all to UNS for Revelation uh this morning now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen in Romans chapter uh one here verse starting with verse 16. this is basically the the foundational message to Restoration that God gave um Martin Luther for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it as the power of God unto salvation it's to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just people the people of God the just those that God has Justified shall live by faith so they continue their journey by faith it isn't just at the beginning it's a walk amen and then let's go to Galatians chapter 2. here Paul goes on to testify of his personal walk with Christ he says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I saw Christ that lives in me and everything that I'm doing in my life I live by the faith of the Son of God Amen the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me at one time Paul walked by his own understanding his own intellect his own thoughts this is what I'm going to do this is the I got this figured out this is the right thing to do and he had to give all that way through all that away that he might gain Christ but it wasn't just a stamp oh I got Christ I've got salvation and now everything's okay his whole life began to be governed by the things that God spoke to his heart so it was in every day of fear where it was hearing the voice of God and he says the life that I now live I live by God's speaking to me and I know it's Faith because we know that's what faith is amen second Corinthians chapter five starting with verse number six therefore we are always confident knowing that whiles we are at home in our body we are absent from the Lord for we walk by faith not by sight now this being the case we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord wherefore we labor that we pray that whether we're present or absent we may be accepted of him so obviously God puts things on our heart amen amen and and we do those things and and it's the labor of the Lord and uh if we don't do it we can't be accepted of him so that's part of really walking by faith and not sight God bless you may be seated today brother Brandon said in the message of the trial he says don't look at me now you you can look at me but let your faith look beyond that you can look to me with physical eyes but look at him with your eyes of faith that he is the word and he has just changed his mess he from what could not be seen to what is absolutely declared the word made flesh and he said have faith have faith I want this message to stimulate our faith because without faith we're not going to go anywhere with God Amen right no matter if we're going to church in the will of God if I could say it like that if we don't have faith in what we're doing we're not going to get anywhere now when we have no physical sight at all we're considered blind we walk in darkness everything is black no matter if the lot if the room is full of lights and praise God we almost got all the lights and I got a couple more lights done it's getting brighter up here even if the room is full of light if you're blind it's it doesn't seem light to you because you can't see beyond that Veil so no matter if a blind man is staring at the sun it's still black to him right right everything is black to us because our eyes are not capable of seeing the things that they really are it's almost like when um uh people say I wish that I wish the sun would come out I wish the sun would come out the sun is always out it's just clouds are in the way from keeping us from seeing the Sun it can be described to us somebody can describe to us things but we can't fully comprehend it until we experience it ourselves okay now when we have sight we're able to walk in the light of our surroundings we're not going to step over the chairs or stumble out or hit one another as we're walking out of the church and this is because our eyes are open to the natural world that's around us and we're able to comprehend things so much greater than somebody just trying to describe something to us we're limited when somebody tries to describe something to us try to describe a changing sunset I mean you you sat there and you watched the sunset over the ocean and you watch that sun go down so fast you just you just can't believe it it happened so fast or the moon if you stayed up long enough to see that it just it goes fast but wonder when a sunset is transpiring the the colors in the sky are rapidly changing it's like a living picture and how do you describe that to somebody to where they really catch and comprehend exactly what you're seeing it just can't be done it just can't be done no matter how good you are at describing uh communicating you cannot bring the full detail because your eyes can't see it so we got some pictures we want to show you I want you to think about trying to describe some of these pictures to somebody try to describe that to somebody who's never seen it before I mean your eyes make it real clear all right let's let's keep going we got a number of these now try to describe that to somebody you know they're not going to get it no no matter how good you are at your communication okay it takes eyes to see it a butterfly that you can see through I mean how are you going to see that or describe that without seeing it you got to see it look at that try to describe that to somebody you're going to come short look at the different colors God is amazing isn't he look at this this is like this this peacock or not a peacock but this is a what is this again peasant yes this fashion I mean look at the detail maybe this is where the Pharaohs got it I don't know but this to describe this to somebody to where they go oh yeah I see the beauty of it can't be done all right try to describe that to somebody it it just you would come way short uh we had a couple of pictures of uh of of some look at this this this this lake is showing the other it looks like the other half of the Sun but it's just a reflection of the top but try to describe that to somebody even if it's standing still like a picture is that all of them okay look at that Lake Michigan we got to get or Lake Superior we got to get that one in there you know describe that that water and what it looks like in the sky you we need eyes to see and comprehend the full world that we live in and it is no different with God's world to go ahead and listen to some man trying to describe the things of God without having spiritual eyes to see is certainly going to come short of seeing exactly what it is some quotes from blind people said many blind people feel they lost their freedom it was taken away from them you know what would be like if you couldn't see anymore you'd be limited one said the worst thing for them was not being able to see details of what were described to them not being able I got that cold after I had come across but it's a vindication one said not being able to see who their grandchildren are really looking like you know Mom or Dad or them or you know one one said the worst thing is one cannot see different colors of life the worst thing you can't see the different colors of life another said good thing one can't see the different colors of humans I like that when a person is blind or Limited in being able to see and comprehend things the way they are and it's no different when a person who is spiritually blind to the word and they can't see and to be honest with you we are all here depending on the Holy Ghost to open these eyes these the spiritual eyes of our heart so we can see amen you see why that course was so fitting that brother Mark I just I'm so grateful that God is amongst us I don't want to be limited to my own understanding to make it to heaven to become the statue of a perfect man to make a Rapture I don't want to depend on my uh own feelings telling me I'm ready and I don't have to do anything else I really want God to open my eyes to see things the way they are amen yes sir there was a Pharisee ruler his name was Nicodemus who wanted to understand spiritual things and Jesus answered and said unto him verily I saying to you except a man is born again he cannot see the king of God he cannot perceive it he cannot be sure he cannot comprehend it it takes a born-again experience now of course being born again it's not entering into your mother's womb again it's when your eyes become opened to a new nature the nature of God hey it's it's when old things are passed away and things begin to not just begin to develop but after they begin to develop they continue to be developed and they keep going until you're out of here and that to me is truly being born again and stopping short of that is way stopping short of God's definition of being born again okay too many people stopped short still claiming to be born again First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 14 says the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God so to sit here and listen to the things of God in a natural state you're not going to be able to receive Everything Jesus said I have many things to tell you but you can't bear it now why why it's too hard for you your natural man can't take it but when he the spirit of truth comes now he'll be able to receive it he'll lean guide y'all because he'll be inside of you amen and you won't be easily offended right great peace have they that love my law and nothing shall offend them amen for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they're spiritually discerned our eyes can really tell the difference between those two peacocks right but if we just felt them but we were told the physical size of them you need something our eyes help us discern things so we don't run into them so we if we want a Big Mac we don't go to Burger King we need help hearing from God when we come to church when we read the Bible when we listen to the tapes you know I'm just so astonished we listen to the tapes and we're so interested in finding certain things about what God has said to that prophet and we miss the message the message is the whole thing don't emphasize one let the other go say God I need it all because he gave it all so when the natural man hears about surrendering his will giving his life living for others picking up your cross I don't know that's like foreign to me I think I can be a Christian be in this message still go to heaven I'm going to make a Rapture and I don't have to do that foreign foreign I remember coming to church sitting in church and saying hearing you got to give up that world of music I had long hair when I was at came to church and so I came to the Lord I didn't come all dressed up came as I am and hearing about how a man needs to cut his hair and how a woman needs to let her hair grow out that was foreign to me but when God begins to open your eyes you don't just pay tithes once a month come on when God opens your eyes you become faithful to the word of God faithful to the word of God the problem is we want to have our own man-made religion do what we want when we want to do it justify ourselves when we don't want to do it God ain't in that that is not the holy ghost that is not the faith of God that's not living by the faith of God Amen time verse number 11 for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man what's in him how many times you ever said well yeah you know how you know how children are you know how parents are you know how my wives are how husbands are well you know how salesmens are right well you know how men are they just don't know the spirit of God right right for what man knoweth the things of a man say the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God so to go ahead and try to use your ability to figure out God it's an insult to God is looking for heart God I need you and this relationship that I have with you only God can open our spiritual Eyes Only God can give us Revelation only God can give us eyes of Faith it's only him our dependency is on him trying to get Revelation from a man it's in vain God said Upon This Rock I'll build my church not upon us trying to figure it out upon the Revelation from Heaven that's where he builds his church today we ought to be looking at him amen the prophet said yeah you know take your eyes off of me if you want to look at me that's fine but God's revelation comes from above amen that's right he can use any vessel he wants to use God is the only one that can open blind eyes [Music] wanting some man or some book to help us see and understand explain or describe truth to us without God Opening Our Eyes is no different than someone trying to describe a peacock who's never seen it before in his life and when you're seeking something about God that means you don't know it amen you've never seen it before no one's got to tell them anymore about that I need to cut my hair right no one needs to tell me anymore I need to pay my tithes nobody because I've got a revelation on it and when you've seen a peacock before you said insult for someone to try to tell you what a peacock looks like trying to figure out on your own trying to figure out God in this close walk and how I can be an overcomer and I can get all get rid of these things in my life that I don't want then how I can live a Victorious Life you need God you need to humble yourself before almighty God that's what's needed [Applause] nothing short of that other than that we're going to come up way short of seeing things the way they really are we can get a better sense from hearing somebody talk about God perhaps than what we had but remember if somebody can talk you into something that means somebody can come and talk you out of it that's why sometimes we are faithful and sometimes we're not because somebody talked you into it and somebody talked you out of it God is looking for faithfulness try to think about God not being faithful his children are faithful well brother John I haven't been real faithful I don't feel I'm a Child of God okay good I'm okay with that what I'm not okay with is you not doing something about it you're not getting up to the Altar and say God I need to get serious I obviously need a spirit in me that creates the faithfulness that I own God God fill me with the Holy Ghost not the knowledge of faithfulness but the spirit of faithfulness amen it's a power greater than knowledge for we walk by faith and not by sight walking by sight spiritually speaking is walking by our own understanding what we think this is my opinion this the way I view it and none of that means anything because that's all Paul had that's all Saul head and he had it all figured out he was taught by the best he was he was the best at everything the only thing is he didn't have the spirit of Christ in him he did it religious as could be works as can be faithful to all that his flesh could do he had zeal but he did not have the spirit of Christ but when he had the spirit of Christ he took on a different nature and no longer accusing others he became a servant to all yes different makeup so instead of looking to man to give us help so depending on the church instead of depended on somebody that you look up to I'm telling you God wants us to start looking to him through eyes of Faith it's a little bit simpler to call somebody say you know what what about this don't tell me I haven't been tempted to call some minister and ask him what he thought about this quote that brother Brandon said was there anything wrong with it no but I'll tell you what if God wants me to know if I seek him and I'm sincere and he wants me to know I believe he'll lead and guide me God's looking for heart in the relationship why are we missing things that we're why do we feel like why do we miss Joy why are we missing the intimacy with Christ that closeness that that love that Joy why are we missing it because it all takes heart it doesn't take knowledge it takes heart and God's looking for heart instead of relying on others or some book God wants us to Humble ourselves and get more serious with him God is the only one that can give us eyes to see the only one that can open her eyes that we can have eyes of faith believe in the Lord so shall ye be established second chronicles 20 20. I always thought that was good Vision believe in the Lord so shall you be established I believe that I believe as the scripture said right A lot of people out there who believe say they believe can't seem to get established in anything Believe In His prophets so shall ye Prosper there's a reason God sent a messenger in this age when we're relying on man's understanding whether it's our own or somebody else's because we can rely on our own we're really not walking with eyes of Faith amen we're walking by sight and we're Limited we limit ourself we limit the power of God in her life brother Brandon said in the message the power of the devil he says how I like to see this little mother with her little Ark speaking of Moses's mother they're all pitched inside and out and slime and pitch on it and now she comes down to the river she's not willing she's not ready to make her little boy and have to to hide them out somewhere but by eyes of faith she's seen what God was going to do she took her right down to the river in this little Ark and no doubt we couldn't think that was a natural act no one would do that naturally he said it's got to be a supernatural act now the reason I'm reading this is God is never going to ask any of you to go take your little child and put him down by the river no but this is in here to let us know that God can make contact with a human being to let them to know what they need to do in their difficult situation [Music] because when you got the devil and every evil thing coming at you that there's a God there that can lead you out of it there's a supernatural God that can lead us to do it and we've just got to do it by faith you can't say oh God this doesn't make insane there's crocodiles down there that'll kill my boy I'd rather give him a chance we can't figure things out we've got to start hearing from God then it doesn't matter if you understand it or not lean not your own understanding trust in the Lord with all thy heart he promised to guide us to lead us in all things majority of people go to church unprepared spiritually the majority hoping to intellectually try to get something in other words they're not willing to pay the price spiritually but they still have this sort of expectation of God I want you to help me at this situation I want you to you know provide this show me that help me with this give me a good feeling help me to get out of this depression I'm in but they're not willing to put in what they got to put in and I'll say it like this God said You shall search me and find me you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart to love the Lord thy God with all that heart with all their soul with all they might God is looking for more out of us I know it's hard it's not a gospel everybody wants to hear they'd rather hear a gospel about how good you are and how what you got inside of you right now you can take and you can prosper in your life you can become anything you want you you don't have to listen to those knuckleheads that's it people love that building their natural self-esteem people try service after service to figure things out no matter how hard the gospel is preached they're looking for an easier way they'll maybe talk about it for an easier way and they even though God is good to everybody he still holds and reserves the right of what he's going to do now many of us can testify about our mother or our father when we were growing up we could see how one of them was such a role model in being nice to everybody else that was in the neighborhood right sister Joyce was here she would let us stay and testify that and God is good to everybody right the scripture tells us that he's good to everybody he's even good to his enemies to an extreme Called Love to prosper them right there's a prosperity in the wicked but you know what a real father doesn't want his child to be without true character so there's something on his mind and what's on his mind is he wants to build a character that can handle things that can go through the test that can resist the wrong and do the right and we're in a building process amen amen God requires heart [Music] he said strive to enter in because I say unto you many will seek to enter in and shall not be able even though he's good to everybody 's not able to enter in I'm so glad Prophet taught us that we create atmospheres that we can create an atmosphere around us no matter who's sitting here you can create an atmosphere here where God can come in and build such a powerful relationship with you that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it that's the God we serve yes Matthew chapter 11 verse 25 at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee Oh father Lord of Heaven and Earth because you hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and has revealed them unto babes now I'll tell you a lot of times we feel like we're not we're somebody else is at we feel more like a babe compared to where they're at I read this scripture brother Marty it would make me want to just shout for joy that I don't have to attain to something to get God to reveal himself to me I mean if I went up to one of brother Ferguson's children or brother James in the back or brother Luke and I said you know what who do you think you are you can't drive this car okay I can't drive the car but now say that to brother Stan say that to an adult you can't drive a car I'll show you I can drive a car foreign prudent now here's the thing it's not about us knowing how to drive a car it's not about the things that we know that he's talking about here it's about all the things that we don't know yet the things that haven't been revealed the things that hasn't been told to us well we think we got it figured out even so father so it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of the father and and no man north of some but the father neither knoweth any man the father saved the son and he to whomsoever The Sun Will Reveal him unless God comes and reveals word to us we're not going anywhere the real Church isn't being built I don't care how smart we get I don't care how much I don't care how much God uses us we cannot survive without the revelation of Jesus Christ amen we cannot survive we cannot be Overcomers we cannot make a rapture we can't be what God has called us to be right how many wants God to choose you to reveal himself too and it's real simple God we're taught that God has chosen to hide himself in simplicity right so don't be wise in your own eyes the scripture says be not wise in your own eyes depart from that evil what is that evil that way of thinking that you you got things figured out all the time don't try to be shrewd and prudent don't rely on yourself or your Keen discernment or your good judgment on situations because you're getting yourself away from where God is really at and God's with that little bait that says God I need you I think I know but you know what God I need you whether I know or not I need you and I need you to to to to stamp it to indicate to to confirm it it's HD notice these are spirits or attitudes humble proud negative positive it's an attitude it's I know or I don't know and one draws God's attention a humble and contrite it broke I will not despise I'm drawn to that I want to help that but the person who's just all kind of figuring oh yeah this is it that's it yeah yeah yeah yeah God resists that he hides himself from the wise and prudence and he reveals himself to someone who's got a babe-like attitude like okay I know I don't know how to drive I've never driven a car okay yeah I've never seen this Revelation before but you know what I want to be faithful with it I haven't been faithful with this I know it I know it but I want to be Lord help me to be that's what God's looking for and that's who God chooses to reveal himself and you know God will hide himself from the person who says I don't need to be that how can we get the things we desire it's through an intimate relationship with the word when the word becomes important to you when God's word that's important to him becomes important to you that's when you get things that you're looking for Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments it's important to him Heaven and Earth is going to pass away but the word is never going to pass away it's forever so in heaven it's going to judge the whole world the word is everything to God because it is God [Laughter] but to us it always becomes a choice well I I like that but you know that's not that necessary and it becomes Choice when we come to church it's like a smorgasbar we're going to take what we want to take and we're going to let go and just let kind of go in one ear and out the other ear or is what brother Johnson you should say like water off a duck's back God is looking for us to have a a heart that's humble humble enough humble enough I like that to follow the word not follow the word that you're already following God is Not Looking you looking to us to correct us with the word that we're following he's interested in the other part because he's coming for a bride without spot a wrinkle so obviously God is looking to to help us in the areas that we need help with amen all right so he says here in verse 28 come on to me all ye that labor in our heavy laden and I will give you rest now we should all be able to say that's me Brother John I'm in labor and just to help my life to get it all fixed up to make things better and I feel like I get this this heavy laden I mean I just I just can't seem to get peace and rest comes from God but we've got to come to him I'm not going to keep coming to brother Mark to get my rest I got to go to God so when we come to God this is what he says now that you've come to me you got the promise I'm going to give you rest now you're going to have peace you take my yoke upon you in other words you're not all scot-free you don't leave church thinking you don't have to do anything because God did it all it's not one of these love grace mercy and no cross to bear no you have a cross to bear you have a yoke to put up to take upon you and you've got to do it yourself because God is no manipulator he doesn't grab us Hold Us by the neck run us down last us yoke upon him and then let you go he doesn't do that he's not a manipulator he's a gentleman and so you got to just Lord this is the word that you gave me today I place this upon my life I will take this word home with me I will dress myself with this word and I will come to church the next service now we'll listen to the next tape and I will hear your voice and the next time I get on my knees and I will live by the faith of the Son of God Who Loved Me died for me gave his life for me I will take this yoke take my yoke upon you and learn of me in other words you don't have it all figured out yet you don't know it all yet and the only way you can really learn of God Is by taking the yoke you have to obey the word you hear don't wait for God to give you complete understanding about paying your tithes when you don't have money to pay your tithes commit don't wait to have complete understanding to obey Church order you either believe the word and you have a chance to show and prove that you believe it or you doubt it and you're walking by sight my yoke upon you learn to me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest for your souls for my yoke it's easy and my burden is light now we know the devil presents this easy way to go right the broad way it's easy it seems very fun and enjoyable and you don't got to worry about anybody right you don't gotta you you don't have to bear one another's burdens you don't have to care about other you don't have to live for anybody you can kind of just stay at home and do your own thing and it seems pretty light but it ends up being depressing it ends up bringing you down because you can only have true Joy when you're living for others I believe it [Music] but God has a yoke and he has a burden so don't think he doesn't the beauty of it it's so much easier and so much lighter than the devils the devil shows you know hey just drink this stuff take this stuff and get high I'm free from all my problems keep doing that long enough you'll find out you've got cancer a little quicker see it comes at the end and it's no different spiritually I'm going to try to figure it out I mean Saul's trying to figure it out and and he thought he had it figured out but at the end he found out he was wrong we got to walk by faith and not by sight so let's get used to coming to church and just obeying the word yes amen that's it no I've never heard that that's being said I didn't feel that nobody else told me that that doesn't matter the word says it you're in love with the word not me you're not in love with a man you're loving God [Music] is your husband the word is your husband bad things happen when you leans your own understanding you literally blind yourself more the Bible says when you hear the word and you don't do it you deceive yourself amen right the world is is full of spiritual blindness people are walking by sight by their feelings by what they want people who refuse to believe the gospel their people without eyes of faith second Corinthians 4 verse 3 says but if our gospel be hid it is hit to them that are lost in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who's in the image of God should shine on them so who blinds our minds look we were born in sin shapen in iniquity we didn't know right from wrong even when we were told right from wrong we still didn't want to do it still didn't believe it still doubted our parents still wanted to do what we wanted to do Satan that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it is the author of blindness and if our gospel be hid it's hid to them that are lost now that's just scares me because if something's hid from me I want God to show me that means I got to get in a state of humility a state of neediness I am so needy Lord so needy of you and I've got to stay there and and wait until his presence comes because it is a supernatural act every time you feel the presence of God it's the supernatural God coming down and visiting you through Humanity I love this word our churches today they're a blind people blind leaders leading the blind right Matthew chapter 15 verse 10 we're not going to have a chance to get through everything that we have here today but that's just the way it always goes here at Sun Delight Outreach Matthew 15 verse 10 and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand Jesus said and that which goeth into the mouth not that which goeth into the mouth defiled a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man thank you then came his disciples and said unto him don't you know that there were people in the congregation that got offended when they heard you say that and he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up I'm going to tell you what if you love the word you are not going to get offended if you get offended that means your love has been towards something else and it needs to get back to Christ because God is not going to separate his word from a relationship with you just because you don't want to hear it he's not going to do that that means there's the change that has to take place is is inside of me I've got to love the word whether I agree with it or not I've got to want it in my life whether it's there or not whether it's hard or not I've got to want it he said let them alone they'd be blind leaders of the Blind and if the blind lead the blind both fall into the ditch now I want to take a look at this word blind how many's ever dealt with stain before okay or paint s you know usually understand have you ever worked with paint before hasn't he done a great job brother Stan he's done such a wonderful job here there are paints that are solid paints and when you got a real bad thing that you want to cover up you you want a thick paint right a paint that covers that doesn't bleed through and then sometimes we have to use that stuff called kills that's killed the stains but they also have stains and paints that are opaque opaque am I saying that right opaque and and in other words it's not total that color but semi and sometimes they'll put that on wood to give it the old-fashioned look in this word blind when you look it up means opaque so there are these these blind leaders they have truth of them they see certain things but they also have a of a blindness to other things and here they are they know Christ in a certain way but they're missing out in another way so there are leaders who simply don't know everything they're talking about come on say amen amen I want to move on I got a lot of stuff to hear I got a lot of hay start eating there are leaders who think they see things clearly and they really don't there are people trying to tell you what to do who aren't leading you correctly now come on I need this word to penetrate your heart and when you choose to follow their enticing ways you'll end up falling into a ditch just like them they just don't know it just because our heavenly father hasn't planted them doesn't mean they don't have the ability to lead right Hitler had the ability to lead I mean you got great leaders out there they got the ability to lead but that doesn't mean that God planted them eventually they're going to be rooted up because they didn't stay a lot of Christians they don't stay by the rivers of Living Water amen turn with me if you would to Matthew chapter 13. if we could just I didn't give in the the scripture but if we could get this on the on the screen here today Matthew 13 verse 14 Matthew 13 verse 14. this came to me just before we came up and in them is the fulfilled the prophecy of isaiahs which saith by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand in sin you shall see and not perceived now that this is a lot of people in church right a lot of leaders a lot of people he said for this people not all people but this people's heart is wax girls now why don't they see because the condition of the heart this is what I want to get to if you want more with God start dealing with your heart for this people's heart is wax gross their eyes are dull of hearing they're jealous they just they come in they hear and they they just don't want to listen anymore and their eyes have been closed less of any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand what their heart and should be converted and I should heal them he said but blessed are your eyes I want you to think about where you're at in the economy of God compared to the world when you read this scripture but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I was saying to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which you see and have not seen them and to hear the things which you hear and have not heard them we have been blessed with the truth of this message we are so blessed and yet we take things for granted you should you ever go up to the table eat food dinner after dinner after dinner after dinner and just expect it yeah because you lived there because because you're part of the family however you want to say that imagine life's wives imagine being married to somebody who you feed over and over and over clean their dishes over and over prepare over and over and over and they are not thankful right they're blessed but they're not thankful so when Jesus is saying it blessed is your eyes for they see you have been brought into the message of the hour by the by the supernatural power of the Holy Ghost leading you to this message why is there other people in my family that can't see it why did God open my eyes why can I see it because my eyes are blessed and what are we doing with our blessings taking things for granted not being thankful to God enough come on he comes and he gives you his heart when you come to church he gives you his heart he's given you his word that he's been preparing for weeks to this day and we think well that's just some man's view about the scriptures and you're missing the very God that's sitting among you and where is he at in your heart and not recognizing it because you're not looking through eyes of faith I say today that there are many people that wish they could have taken our place in here that's what Jesus said all right do we still have some time amen it's not even it's not even over yet I mean it's crew you got time I say that after gotta gotta hold on all right Matthew 23 verse 23. this is boy I'd like to try to get through this subject of we can just I suppose we can just take our time with this one and and just come come back to it all right Matthew 23 verse 23 woe unto you scribes and Pharisees so it's a group of people he calls hypocrites for you pay tithes of mint and Ennis and conman and have omitted the weighty matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these things all ye have done and not to leave the other undone ye blind guides those are conductors a guide a conductor a shower and we're all guides we all talk to somebody and tell somebody what to do right all right which strain at a net and swallow a camel now that is real small right you'll spend time making sure you take care of this wonderful thing that's on your mind that bothers you but then you'll just gallop a hole another subject that is so much weightier and greater and more important to God he calls it a weightier matter so however you want to Define that a more important it's all important the words all important but there's nothing more important than our relationship with Christ nothing amen nothing more important and our conduct and how we love God how we love the word how we want to display the word so these blind guides it's not just discipling others but their own lives some people try to filter out some small detail that's wrong and they miss being able to love everybody it's a weightier matter so they strain at a certain thing and swallow a camel Jesus says you have admitted the weightier matters judgment Mercy faith these things what you have done and not to leave the other undone so what's let's just take judgment judgment sometimes we leave out judgment now I'm going to be honest with you so often not so often but you ever get down on your knees you're getting ready to pray and all sudden you start thinking about other people how they're doing wrong come on now that's not God right and that's not you that's Satan he's he's going to give you some reason to think negative about somebody and he ain't going to take some lie he's not going to tell me that brother Mark is over here stealing a vehicle right brother stands stealing about out of the bank it's not going to give you that thought he's going to give you a thought of something that you've seen at church last time how somebody acted towards you he's going to bring that up in your mind so this judgment is not about judging others because honestly we have no problem judging others we have a hard time stopping ourselves from judging others but where the thing that we've left out is judging ourselves judging our own motives taking time to to look and am I really following the word am I holding myself accountable to laying down my life to bear in my brother or sister's burden to helping others to esteeming others better than myself like sometimes we omit the things that we should be doing but will stand proud as a peacock and stare at the things that we do do and say I don't need to do that right so I'll say you don't got to be a Pharisee or Republican or sadducee or one of the religious per all you got to do is just get away from an intimate relationship with Christ and you can let these important things going we need to be dedicated to the to God's house we need to be laboring for souls and we don't even hold ourselves accountable to those things we need to judge ourselves to see if we've omitted anything from our walk with God Mercy how many how many really really really has omitted wanting Mercy For Your Life how many has really omitted wanting Mercy for your life hey I know why let me say it again how many has omitted wanting Mercy I mean have you ever said God I don't want your mercy I don't need your mercy everybody in this world Christian or not Christian wants Mercy when they need it when they realize they need it they want it but they they don't admit omit it we omit being merciful to others when they need it when they need Mercy we omit it because we hold this power of I'll be merciful to who I'll be merciful to right and so a lot of times people are not very merciful to others that's why they speak negatively or think negatively of others so the reason they're light that is because they don't hold very much Mercy in their heart they only got a limited amount and so what they do is they hold it now for certain people certain situations more of a respecter of persons who they're going to have mercy on but Jesus taught us at the end if we're not merciful if we don't forgive that God wasn't going to forgive us but these Pharisees and Sadducees and people who get this spirit which we ask hey look it this word hits us right your name don't got to be Pharisee for it not to hit you all you got to do is fulfill the same thing we omit being merciful to others but we we don't have a very hard time saying well this is what I think of that brother the sister what they did you know and are thinking these thoughts about one another brother sister we're mid omitting the weightier matters of life because we're not seen through eyes of Faith that's why that's why faith we can't omit faith without faith we can't even please God don't come to church without faith so I'm going to hear from God and not only am I going to hear from God I'm going to go do it whether I feel like it whether I got what I want or not I'm here because I'm a soldier of the Cross and I'm going to follow through with what he said okay verse 25 for woe unto you describes Pharisees Hypocrites for you may clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within their full of exhort extortion and excess Thou blind Pharisees cleanse first that which is within the cup and the platter and the outside of them may be cleaned that the outside of them may also be clean in other words you automatically live a good life when it's happening from the inside but too often we try to do the right thing on the outside and it's really hasn't been settled on the inside so what is really Jesus warning us of here that there are religious people out there who can talk or walk in such a way that the emphasis is only on part of the word and if you notice when somebody's talking to you when somebody says something negative to you about somebody else and don't tell me it doesn't happen because it does assures the devil is around it happens he'll find somebody it's always about some minor thing not always but a lot of times it's about some minor thing that you'll strain out that gnat just strain it out make sure that you know we shouldn't have that in our church that shouldn't be like that now brother that shouldn't be like that in that sister and if omitted getting on your knees and praying omitted uniting with that person that you're telling and saying look at I don't I can't talk I just got something out of my heart let's go to God In Prayer admitted that admitted Mercy omitted Mercy oh message you know what I'm not guilty of that but I'm probably guilty of a lot more omitted the reality right the big picture don't leave the important things that God is trying to speak to you don't admit them don't leave them don't leave them at church don't go home and forget about what was spoken to you today take it home pray about it let God speak to you because if you think God is okay about just coming to church and going home and living the same old life you need to find another church that unites with that thought process God's in the cleanup business God is interested in seeing Our Lives become more like him Proverbs 3 verse 3 we're going to be we're just going to have to find a spot here let not mercy and Truth for safety bind them upon thy neck write them upon the table of your heart look at that mercy and Truth for sake let not mercy and Truth forsake you wear a necklace when people look at you let them see on you this thing that's called Mercy I don't really I don't really mean a real necklace that says Mercy I'm talking about something that's invisible where you're whole you're how you handle things people say well that was God that was Mercy and the truth about Mercy that we've not omitted it bind them upon thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart so shall thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and Men amen God bless you let's just stand together if we don't long for all the word we're going to end up following someone who just takes part of the word now that statement that I just said is a big warning to us we're all following somebody I don't want to be a part of just God's a part of God's word I don't want just a part of God's peace I don't want just part of God's joy part of God's love I I want to be filled with God we all got friends and we all got people we hang out through they say that you are a combination of The Five People You do you talk to the majority of the time I want to say this if you don't love the word more than anything you will end up following someone who loves the word as much as you do because birds of the feather flock together you'll find somebody that's like you but I don't want to be like anybody here I want to be like Jesus I want to be like the word he's our Mentor he's our example so let not mercy and Truth forsake you if it forsakes somebody else that's okay pray for him but you you have a choice free more agency you stick with it by you staying with all the word you have a chance to help that person amen do you love the word all right I I I I do I feel bad that I wasn't able to you know do the whole uh service today but it would just say it's like a a a part and if God would will um and we we don't know but if God will we could try to take another part but because I do believe God wants us ultimately to be walking with eyes of faith eyes of faith and we really really haven't dove into it like I want we've been talking about some natural eyes that are religious eyes and eyes that are looking at things maybe the things of God in a natural way and how upsetting it could be and leaving out weightier matters and not paying attention to to the big picture which is which is all his word but by the grace of God I believe that he's going to to help us don't you amen let's look to the Lord in just a word of Prayer say with every eye closed every head bowed our eyes are closed I trust every every person here is reverencing the Lord just this time between us as individuals and the Lord perhaps there's someone here today that knows God has spoken to you you know God is calling you get more serious start paying attention to the things that God is speaking to you and this morning you're responding back to him just lifting up your your hand the hand of your that's in your heart God sees your heart God sees your desire God Will Make A Way God is calling the humble the Bible says the humble shall hear and be glad God is calling us his bride and he's he's a real gentleman to us but I do believe that we we need to make a commitment to him we need to leave here determined not to let Satan control us control our time and our Direction and our philosophies and but just to take this word and to get dressed in it and to become more like him you believe with me now as we pray we go to our Heavenly Father in prayer father there was a reason that Jesus prayed I thank thee father Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent we don't know all things but we know that there's no fools they're going to stumble into heaven you are the door you are the door keeper and Lord that door is open for your sheep to go in and out to find good pasture and Lord we are we have been blessed with eyes to see this message in this hour the and we've received it that God we know the things of the world can distract us from pressing in to all that this message has taught us father you see our hearts your hands have been raised the hands that are in her heart and we're asking you today Lord that you would take our lives with the word that you have just given us today and Lord we by faith are writing them upon the tables of our heart we're putting on the chains of Truth and mercy we're binding them Lord we want to be associated with you and your word we want to mature and to grow up we want to become the body that you you're going to marry Lord I pray for every heart here today that's Desiring this may you come and Grant it for them Lord as they look Through The Eyes of faith believing that it was you that has spoken to them they now will receive it and have received it may you now Prosper their life Lord bring these things to Remembrance in the days to come and help us all Lord as we're growing into that statue of a perfect man more and more and more father I pray for the hearts that aren't here today those that are watching in the live stream and those that will watch the I archives Lord of this surface Lord feeling your presence there where they're at I pray that you would answer and hear their prayers and Grant to them the desires of their heart as well Lord we commit ourselves to you we love you we thank you for blessing us Lord and bringing us in the truth of this message in this hour we are truly blessed we say Amen to your word today we love you in Jesus precious name amen amen amen foreign don't you love them amen amen let's sing um look to the Lamb of God look to the Lamb of God oh what happened huh you know we're just playing slow play it real slow if you from sin are Longing To Be Free look to the Lamb of God he to
