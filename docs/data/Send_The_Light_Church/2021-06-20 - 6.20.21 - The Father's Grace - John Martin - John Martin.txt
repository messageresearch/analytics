the lord just love you jesus well if you would turn with me in the book of ephesians chapter 2 today we want to talk about the father's grace amen amazing grace amen ephesians chapter 2 we'll read like the first 10 verses there as you're turning there we want to make an announcement that brother alex magoulas will be with us the next two sundays so let's be in prayer for those services that the lord will come and just have his way among us amen let's look to the lord in prayer before we read his word heavenly father lord again we're not worthy to look upon this book because we know that this book is pure it's perfect you you used man to pen it but lord this is your word there's no blemishes in it there's nothing wrong with it and in it lord we find life we find out who you are we find out who we are and you told us that if we would read your word that we were just blessed to read it yes we thank you for the blessings this morning we've been able to open this book read the precious promises that we have we humbly pray that you come in the furtherance of this service lord you've prepared a heart lord through this wonderful worship and now we pray that you give us the revelation of your word that we might grow thereby we commit the service to you with every need and give you the praise and honor for in advance in jesus wonderful name amen amen ephesians chapter 2 verse number 1 and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in times past you walked according to the course of this world everybody remember that according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that is now working in children the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in other words we could relate to these things and the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind were by nature our very nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy he owns a cat on a thousand hills but he's also rich in mercy amen for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead and sins have quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and have raised us up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast about it for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god had before ordained that we should walk in them amen and god bless you may be seated for a subject today we'd like to take grace for growth god has given us grace to grow god is good it's one thing we can come together and agree on that god is good amen psalms 86 verse 15 says but thou o lord art a god full of compassion and gracious long-suffering and plenteous in mercy and in truth that's the god that we're serving this morning the god that we serve is full of grace amen he's rich in mercy one of the major reasons that almighty god allowed man to fall was to be able for him to express certain attributes that he had inside of him that he would never be able to express in a perfect setting so he had to allow a setting to happen where other attributes could come out and paul described it like this in our opening scripture he says to show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus in other words if man would never about a fault those those riches of his grace would never be able to show towards his kindness through his kindness and he used it was all through jesus christ god is rich in mercy he's rich in grace for his great love we're with he loved us we could all say that god is good all the time even even when we're being corrected god is good amen he's worthy of our praise jesus became the very expression of the father's attribute of grace john chapter 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was with god in the word was god and in verse 14 that same word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld the glory the glory is the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth that word manifested in the flesh was full of grace amen jesus became the very expression of his father which was full of grace right an abundance of it and and when we behold the glory of god today we will see that it is full of grace amen the father gave grace for his son jesus to grow in other words he gave him grace to grow luke chapter 2 verse 40 says jesus grew and wacked strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him from the get-go the grace of god was upon him and as jesus matured because we know that jesus learned obedience by the things he suffered he became the expression of the same grace that was in his father amen and the word that was made flesh in jesus christ was full of grace and that grace made a way and gave an opportunity for growth to take place that's what grace is for it gives a chance for growth there are many examples of god's grace manifested in the flesh when that woman was caught in adultery we don't have time to go through all the stories but you just read the new testament you'll see lots of examples of grace's seat in the old testament even the the god and the children of israel but here is this woman she was caught in the very act there's no doubt that she was wrong and and and and god gave grace and that grace was for growth because he said go and sin no more but see even her accusers receive grace on that day he could annihilated them all he could have said well i'm i'm judging you for this but i'm not going to because i haven't come here to judge i've come to to give a time of grace and just he that's without sin let him do it little zacchaeus in that tree he received grace to grow and when he received that grace he just he expressed it i'm gonna give back i'm gonna give four times as much because you know i i did this wrong and i want to i want to pay what i owe jesus faithfully went to nazareth the bible says and he read the scriptures in the synagogue yet he was rejected by the people by the majority of them one time after he read the scriptures he closed the book and he and you know the scripture and he gave it to the minister and he sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him in luke chapter 4 verse 21 we'll pick it up and he began to say unto them this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears amen and all bear witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is this not this is this not i'm sorry is not this joseph's son just trying to relate him to joseph's son instead of our heavenly father and he said unto them look at the very next thing and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this proverb position heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in camponium do you also hear in thy country in other words they doubted him it was because of their own unbelief they couldn't get the blessing amen they were blaming it on him amen but gracious words still proceeded out of his mouth and it gave them an opportunity to grow amen so much of the father's grace was manifested in the life of jesus christ he said in matthew chapter 11 verse 28 come unto me all ye that labor and our heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you learn to me for unique and lowly in heart ye shall find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light he said one time how often i would have uh gathered you together and or or uh yeah gathered you together as a a a a hen a check does this brew you know just come together and let's just be together a family but he would not he had so much grace he was given out he was just full of grace but but people are full of pride even up to the time of his crucifixion we i've you know me i always got lots of scriptures if we could just read a little bit here in isaiah 53 verses 1 through 10 i think we could do this of our father i think he would appreciate his word amen isaiah chapter 53 verse 1 who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of the dry ground he have no form or commonness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with greece and we hid it as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for us for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with the stripes we are healed you talk about the amazing grace we sung about all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord have laid upon him the iniquity of us all in other words when we go do our own thing that's iniquity same thing as lucifer did he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened out his mouth amen he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as the sheep before the shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth grace grace grace he was taken from prison and from the judgment who shall declare his generation for he was cut off of the land of the living for the transgressions of my people was he straightened for he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was deceit in his mouth any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him that was for you and me he have put him to grief when thou shalt make a and when thou shall make a soul make his soul an offering for sin his soul became the offering for adam and eve's sin in the garden we were trapped right we were just born with this nature that they entered into and this offering became his soul became the offering for you and i he shall see his seed i just want to read that yet it please the lord to bruise him he have put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul in offering for sin he shall see his seed that's you and i he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand we are the seed of god amen we are the seed of grace jesus became the very expression of his father full of grace and truth grace was abundantly manifested in the life of jesus christ and this grace gave an opportunity for everybody to change which is a a an opportunity to grow one of the first things that came out of brother ron's mouth when he was leading i don't know if be right at the beginning of the worship talking about an opportunity to worship the lord amen we have such an opportunity all the time i wonder if we if we just didn't take advantage more of of worshipping the lord more he would inhabit us more he would he would be faithful to his word because we're following the steps of his word amen brother branham says if you want to know who god really is you'll know him only through jesus christ matthew chapter 11 verse 27 jesus said all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father saved the son and this is where we come in and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him so if we're going to know god we've got to know through the revelation that jesus christ gives us that's right brother man says all that was in god he poured in to christ and all that was in christ he poured into you and i yes now we're just like jesus just like jesus was just like the father as the father gave grace for his son jesus to grow jesus manifested that same grace towards others those same attributes that was in the father at the beginning when there was no sin when there was no world there was attributes in there and there were attributes of grace and he waited so long to express them and when jesus was manifested in the flesh we began to see that god was full of grace full of grace jesus was the very seed of god matured and manifested and he gave this same grace to his disciples to grow he chose them and they were just so full of sin and and and and yet he gave them grace to grow look at matthew he was just sitting at the seat of customs look at saul he was just he was on his his his high thinking his horse of high thinking thinking that he was something and he was so proud he just was compete with everybody and yet god gave that man grace to grow come on can you say amen we ought to be the most thankful people in the whole world that god gave us grace to grow we also are the seed of god that has received grace to grow amen and as we mature in christ we begin to manifest the same grace and eventually become the very expression of our heavenly father before there was ever a world yes think about it he's taken us back to where he was this is going to be a little bit different sermon about grace today as the word becomes flesh and you and i it will be full of grace and truth because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever we are an expression that's what this every seed brings forth of its own kind we will be like christ now before the seed is matured still a seed but before it's matured it will always want to take out the sword and cut the wrong things just like peter did peter not having enough power to stay with christ during his trial right it was just all coming at him at once you know the satan was coming in like a flood and he just denied him deny he knew him but god's grace was still with peter he gave him grace to grow he didn't call peter out on the spot and said you you changed rate this sucker i'm just i wouldn't i should have never chose you right right that's good but some reason we feel we're the vengeance of god or something i'm telling you jesus christ is full of grace he's full of grace today amen ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 god is rich in mercy for his great love we're with he loved us i'm so glad that god hasn't stopped loving us even when we were dead in sins have quickened us together he changed our nature that quickening it changed our nature by grace are you saved grace doesn't stop with us that's the thing that satan has plagued over the the world as far as uh a carnal believing what grace is for it it just it it saved me and that's all that matters as god wanted to express his amazing attributes of forgiveness of mercy and grace he has long to see those same amazing attributes being expressed through his children through his seed it didn't stop with us it continues out with us because god in us is the same as god that was in jesus name and have raised us up together and now we're not sitting in the carnality of the of the bible we're sitting in a heavenly realm together together when we get to heaven it's going to be together there won't be any of this it's going to be together i'm longing for that day that in the ages to come he might show the ages to come we're in those ages right now we're in those ages to come that he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through christ jesus exceeding riches yes that's that means to pass or throw beyond the usual mark in other words i did not deserve this he threw it beyond the angels amen he threw it beyond heaven and he he conned and sent it to men of low estate he lifted us up into a heavenly place with him that we could be with him because he wasn't coming to live down here in our muck right now we will meet him in the air for by grace are you saved amen and it's through faith we've got to believe it we can't be saved without believing it and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast no man will be able to say i did this i did that and it merited what god offered i love verse 10 because if i could just get us to have a revelation of this verse here for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus onto good works not stopping not just stopping we got salvation but just go on now and live our lives now we've been created in christ jesus unto good works which god have before the foundation of the world before ordained that we would walk in them now we got to just determine what is that good works are we talking about god not only wanted to show his grace and his kindness towards us through jesus christ but he also wanted us to show that same grace towards others we were ordained before the foundation in the world to walk in good graces expressing grace full of grace towards others how will the world ever see jesus if they don't see him in jew he saved us he redeemed us back he bought us with the price of his own blood that we don't even own herself anymore i wish we had a revelation of that one amen can you imagine going and buying a brand new car paying cash for it brother mark getting a new equinox is that what you have trained off the lot and you're driving by you're driving at home an hour after you get home they come by and they pick it up and they take it back to sell to somebody else i've got the deed i bought it it's right here well no no i want it we would fight tooth and nail because we bought it why are we fighting tooth and nail when god wants to use our life to show grace to somebody but we say no i'm not going to do it we belong to christ we have become his workmanship we start doing the things he wants we start acting the way he wants and he created us in christ right he created us in christ paul said it's not me anymore but the life that i now live in the flesh i live by the faith and son of god so now we begin to do as he does we're just another vessel if we all stood up and jesus came and he stepped inside of every one of us we'd end up acting the same way we really would we one of us still may be a carpenter one stone may be uh this or that a housewife but i'm telling you we still act the same way because it's christ that liveth in me amen and he created us and he has created us onto good works jesus said the the works that i do shall you do also in greater works that uh you shall do because i go to my father and i'm leaving you here to do them right amen so we're going to do the works of christ now the works of christ were full of grace that's something we all can do the word that was made flesh in jesus christ was full of grace and the living word today inside of us will be full of grace something that we maybe don't exercise very much something we don't think about sometimes very much something we just think is is uh not that big a deal as if grace stopped with you usually people that are judgmental grace stops with them but if you're not being judgmental towards other that's you're full of grace god gives grace for his children to grow and god is no respecter of persons he will abundantly pardon whosoever will just say lord i need you i'm a sinner and i need your grace come into my life lord and he will because he's no respecter of persons he will give every man grace to grow grace is like a time period in which god has allowed it for us to get things right amen to make things right that's what grace is yes and i'll tell you if it wasn't for the grace of god i wouldn't be here today i'd like to say that there are our men and women who are much more worthy than i but when it comes to worthiness none are worthy none are right none are righteous holy if it wasn't for the grace of god none of us could stand in this hour none of us but the devil would like us to get down here and just start showing who's got the bigger problems the bigger faults the bigger sins and before you know it we start exercising the greatness who's the greatest to be among us oh we need a jesus to come by and say let him that's greatest let him be the servant among you let him get down and wash the feet we need jesus here the majority of the human race will not benefit from the grace that god has given them they will spurn it they will waste precious time getting things right in their life they will ignore it they're too proud to think that they're a wretched sinner they're too proud to think that their nature is that bad that they need to do something about it brother branham taught us that a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon so we have in order to receive it you gotta you gotta feel you gotta realize you're locked up that you're in prison with the devil john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life amen for god sent not his son into the world to condemn it but that the world through him might be saved yes a time period a man that got a time period we don't know how long we're going to live but as the tree falls that's where it lies it can't change it cannot change after death everything that's determined for eternity is already done down here the only thing the white throne judgment does is tell us what what happened down here come on he that believeth on him is not condemned it's all you gotta do is believe but he that believeth not is condemned already because he have not believed in the name of the only begotten of the son of god so you see the majority of the people will not benefit from god's grace the bible says straight as the gate narrows away and that leads to life and few be that findeth and and broad is the way why does the least destruction and many many many many going there at yet the grace was for the world amen the pardon was available to everybody but only those who admitted their condition that repented that forsook their ways they were the ones that were abundantly pardoned and this is the only formula to becoming born again god hands out grace to grow into a mature son and daughter of god he gives us grace to grow we've all tasted that the lord is good we've all tasted the grace of god and today we're we're here as as testimonies of god's grace amen there had been traces throughout our life even before we knew god we could see traces of grace but you know none of us really met grace until we got salvation that's when we met grace face to face we'd received grace in a way that we've never experienced before it was unmerited grace wasn't anything that we could do at that time god didn't want us boasting a human nature is proud and it wants to oh yeah and i have something to do with it always wants to get that little thing in there i burnt so many candles i did all these deeds look at me god says i don't want anybody in heaven like that somebody that don't realize that they were lost and undone and had such an evil selfish nature and they don't want to even come to grips with that you don't want anybody boasting amen don't get quiet on me we did not go hunting for god he came hunting for us john 15 verse 16 ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and have ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain in other words don't stop amen that whatsoever you ask in the father's name he will give it to you for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works and god wants us to continue those good works to continue them we've all been blessed with god's grace but let us this morning be courageous enough to answer this question how amazing is god's grace to you how amazing is god's grace to you amen grace saved us but we know it doesn't stop there is it amazing enough to be full of grace is it amazing enough for you to be full of grace [Music] is it amazing enough to you to express grace to others is it amazing enough to provide others with time to get things right when they're not right or do you want to cut them off amen how amazing is grace to you grace allowed us time to get things right grace allowed us time to grow to become more mature and this is a great purpose of grace it is a great purpose of grace so my question to you is grace amazing enough to be gracious towards others to be a believer today that people can look at and say he's full of grace grace is given to us that we might grow but it's also given to us that we might be the express image of the almighty god who is full of grace i've always felt indebted to god and you've heard that many times from this pulpit indebted because of his amazing grace and to me it is that indebtedness in our lives that fuels personal growth and it distributes god's grace to others without feeling that indebtedness i don't need to i don't know just because a man receives the grace of god in his life it doesn't mean he feels greatly indebted or more in love with god you can receive the grace of god at your life and not even love god it is the truth matthew chapter 18 verse 21 do you love the word amen i love the word i don't know where i'd be without it then came peter to him to jesus and said lord how often should my brother sin against me and i forgive him is seven times complete enough is seven times complete enough and jesus said unto him i say not unto thee until seven times it is not enough but if you want to talk about completion until seven times or seventy times seven get the idea peter peter you don't know my nature yet you think my nature is i only have to forgive somebody a little bit but i have ordained you to go on to good works you're going to be the workmanship of my hands i'm going to create in you the same nature that i have so you can do the same works that i do because it is not the work of god to forgive somebody only seven times that may be your works yes that may be your thoughts of god's nature but that is not god's nature amen here is the story of a man who rejoiced and believed in the grace and mercy of god for his life but didn't believe that he needed that same nature to be manifested through his life towards others in other words you you got this attitude of believing in grace one way towards god but then you have a different attitude with that same grace towards somebody else like we're not quite full of grace he rejoiced he rejoiced just like everyone else rejoices when they receive grace but because his nature never changed he was too selfish to forgive other people they're wrong oh i want that to sink in and it's hard in this age for people to manifest a life full of grace and mercy it's slayer to see a spirit so strong they're in need of nothing it's rights the spirit of the colonel church has become so unthankful one of the great attributes that's being expressed by the carnal church is unthankful and all because their own iniquity is out of control the love of many is waxing cold let's look at verse 23 therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him that owed him ten thousand talents that's a lot but for as much as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and his children and all that he had and payment to be made right now and the servant now notice this is the kingdom of heaven he's likened it to the kingdom of heaven the servant therefore fell down and worshiped him saying lord have patience with me and i will pay thee all amen he was seeking the mercies of god amen now remember he asked for patience what is patience he was asking for grace a time to get things right then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion imagine what a humble and contrite spirit would do for the lord move with compassion and lose him and forgave him the debt didn't say okay start paying it he forgave him the debt god who is rich in mercy jesus christ is full of grace i want you to notice the attitude of this servant this this recipient of god's grace his life began to express just how amazing he thought god's grace was you know when you don't show the same grace god gives you you belittle his grace i know you don't want to hear it and you don't believe it but it's the truth but the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him a hundred pence and he laid hands on him and he took him by the throat he must have meant business saying pay me that thou owest and the fellow servant fell down and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him the same thing have patience with me and i will pay the all now look at the difference and he would not and he would not god has put in our hands the ability to love to hate to forgive to hold grudges to be graceful not to be graceful that's all in our power don't don't tell me the devil made you do it and that that that's that so when his fellow servants his other brothers and sisters saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done and then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o thou wicked servant well here was at one time god was moved with compassion and just gave him grace but because of his attitude how he expressed grace to others he now became a wicked servant in the sight of god see your attitude really determines how god thinks about you not how you feel about god loving you notice this servant didn't turn around and say wait a minute you gave me grace to you i i you had compassion on me what do you do and call me wicked now because he knew he was wrong something inside of him told him he was wrong amen oh oh thou wicked servant i forgave all that debt because you desired me too now look at the expectation that god has from every one of us should us not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow brother and sister even as i had pity on thee amen sure is not my grace been amazing enough to have compassion on others to to forgive others now this wicked servant i went and did the math he owed 270 today's today's he would owe 271 million dollars and his lord just forgave him but he came across a person who owed him just one dollar one dollar and he had such an ungracious attitude i just don't think that sits good with god do you and i'll tell you there you know there ain't a person in here a person in our world the life that we live in outside these buildings i don't care what wrong they do to us can compare with the debt that we owe god he forgives us daily amen amen his mercies are new every day god is full of grace who are we to say anything to anybody that does this any harm nothing but when we lift ourselves up to begin to be a judge over one dollar one little baby little thing that just wasn't he didn't he did he wore his his tie was too short come on let's hold it against him you're right that's that's not god that's the other god that's the other other guy trying to trick us verse 34 and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him so at one time when he received this amazing grace yes his name was taken out of the book of life he sent him back to prison and said you're going to pay back every 271 million dollars that you owe me well you knew he's going to rot in prison think about this god changes his attitude when you do when you're on your knees saying god i need your mercy i need your grace god will abundantly pardon but you walk up from there go through a little something somebody steps on your toe and all of a sudden you want to call down fire with your attitude changing god's attitude changes towards you god's grace stopped with this wicked servant think about that i don't want god's grace to stop with me i know the only chance i got is to let him live his life through me yes amen and when he does it he'll show mercy on who he wants to show mercy he'll be gracious to me once i'll tell you he is full of grace i don't want anybody looking at my life and say that was you were not very gracious i'd rather be guilty i always remember brother johnson brother brother bruce may remember he always says i want i'd rather be guilty of keeping the door open for somebody right then closing it on somebody right amen god give me that grace amen grace was not given to remain in the same nature think about that grace saves us but grace was never given to us to remain in the same nature that we have it was given to us as a space of time to change our nature and our nature is only going to change when we want to just this example you come up to the altar and you say god i need forgiveness i need your grace come and and please forgive me take this this guilt away from me and set me free and god comes and he blesses you amen and as soon as your attitude changes things begin to change in your life good or bad but if you would continue to come to god and say god change my nature i want to be more like you i i i thank you for helping me with that what you did for me there i know you can do with me for there and my my life i just want to be just like you and if you keep that humble desire in your life god will change you all things will become new in your life it's a promise of god amen god wants his grace to continue being expressed through his seed because we are the seed of god every seed brings forth of us of its own kind verse 35 so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if you from your heart not your lips not your head but your heart where your love is at right if you from your heart forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses don't you feel like you know the lord you see these scriptures and it's like this is the god i know because this is the god who revealed to me who he was when he saved me when he had mercy on me it's okay for him to expect that same devotion and a commitment out of me towards others and if you let god have his way in your life he'll turn your world upside down god is expressing that his seed is been ordained to manifest his nature should is thou not have had compassion on thy fellow servant so next time you have a problem with somebody and you have these thoughts going on in your head i want you to remember the words of jesus should has not thou had compassion on thy fellow servant i want to be reminded by god when i get wrong thoughts yes if we're not careful to maintain these good works of grace god's compassion and god's mercy god will eventually ask us to give an account of our works if we're not careful to maintain good works we can lose the vision of what god had actually done for us at calvary if we're not careful to keep building up his nature inside of us if we're not careful to keep manifesting more of his grace we're going to lose the complete meaning of calvary now you may not lose the partial meaning of calvary but you'll lose the complete meaning 2 peter chapter 1 verse 9 says but he that lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins that's exactly what this man had happened he was forgiven he went away rejoicing he had 271 utah that was a testimony in church he could you know god just i just i don't know that money anymore i'm i'm set free right but he forgot about that one he was reminded that somebody owed him something he forgot it he forgot that he was purged forgiven amen he lacketh he that lacketh these things like what are these things the good works of christ faith temperance patience kind kindness all these things if we lack the living word of god right right we can forget that we were even purged don't ever lose focus of the complete meaning of calvary paying off your debt was not the complete meaning of calvary it is a vital and crucial part but it's far from the complete meaning of calvary cavalry was to lead us to a complete nature change where all things become new all things become god everything about our old selfish nature is passed away holding grudges passed away respective persons passed away amen not caring passed away not being merciful pass away not wanting to forgive pass away not you know struggling with with with being thankful passed away it's gone because you are the seed of god and you are manifesting christ now shouldn't be hard for you to manifest christ if it is don't blame it on your circumstance don't blame it on those around you don't blame it on how people make you feel i'm gonna tell you one thing brother mark has no control over the way i feel like i don't care what he does to me i am not going to let anybody control me outside of god now he may step on my toe he may make me cry for a few minutes that's normal you ever just run into something you go ow normal right but you don't sit there for five days going ou wow well he pushed me into it he stepped on me full of grace amen full of grace turn with me to luke chapter 7 verse 41. calvary led us to be just like jesus luke 7 verse 41 there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed five hundred pence and the other fifty and when they had nothing to pay frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most jesus here is expecting a love in return for forgiveness we see that this is nature when he when when he forgives somebody he expects him to love him that's it it's none of this disgrace it's grace it wants to be recognized as the riches of god-giving it's terrible when somebody receives something and they're not thankful but god expects something out of this simon answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most jesus answered him thou has rightly judged the situation love comes from a heart that's been forgiven and forgiveness comes from a heart that is learn how to feel in debt in other words if you walk around thinking you're not that bad at all you don't feel that much debt how are you going to love much i'd rather feel in debt so much lord i need you please forgive me i got a chance of loving god more her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth a little now we heard it from the creator's mouth the facts from the book do you want to be able to love more than you do here's the key take a good look at humbling yourself aware what you need from god try to discover a greater debt in your life i tell you i don't want others out loving me i don't want to be sitting in heaven with god and thinking look at all those people they're loving god more than me all you got to do is recognize how terrible you are amen how much you need him father forgive me and i'll tell you there'll be such a love that swells up inside of you you just want to worship him even if everybody else isn't that's right it was grace that saved a wretch like us it's going to be grace that takes us to the rapture we got to continue to build god has given us grace to grow take this time that that god has given you and grow grow don't don't use grace like a lot of people think grace is oh i need grace to forgive me when i do wrong i'm going to just keep going out there and doing what i want to it comes real bad and make the mess out of it and then i'm going to ask for grace no take this time grace is a time allowed to get your life closer to god to get things right this is the father's grace being bestowed upon us we're gonna need grace to grow we're gonna need more grace we all got the secret to get more grace right he giveth more grace to the humble humble more grace to grow i need more grace i'm running out of time peter said if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should be neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ many are called to this grace but few are chosen god has chosen us and ordained us the bible says that we should go and bring forth fruit and that our fruit should remain john 15 verse 8 says here is my father glorified that you bear much fruit and you shall be so shall ye be my disciples what kind of what kind of fruit hey men that's a right answer amen life in them you hold the words of life gracious words are full of life amen amen we're going to need grace for our lives i want to express more grace in my life i want to give opportunities we all have had most of us have had children if not we have played with children and sometimes the children do not do what we want them to do and but as a father as a mother you know that that child is going to grow up eventually not only when they're 35 but i i mean when they're when they're real little and um you as a father or a mother you understand the importance of grace it's needful for time to grow even in god's correction towards us it's full of grace amen there's nobody i know like god amen it's full of grace now when we get on the other side at the white throne judgment there will not be no grace there it's already done you're either on one side or the other but today we have a chance to grow in grace so take opportunity to grow and let god exercise his grace through through you if you can understand that through your by being a natural father and a mother it should be quite easy for you to understand that spiritually for your brothers and sisters in christ god is bringing the capstone of this building zechariah 4 7 says and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it that should be all that we want to express is grace grace god will take care of it the bible says my grace his grace is sufficient jesus said my grace is sufficient for thee amen his grace is all that we have need of yes last the very last verse in the whole bible the very last turn with me to the very last verse before we stand and have a word of prayer revelations chapter 22 verse 21 how important is grace the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen let's stand together amen amen let's just let's go to the lord in prayer i'm sure we all feel the same way just desiring more of the grace of god in our life he's been so good to us i'm just looking for an opportunity to express that grace to somebody amen heavenly father as we come to you today in prayer there is a thanksgiving in our heart because of the indebtedness that we feel lord we can't forget what you've done for us at calvary you paid a debt that we could not pay you didn't know it but you paid it freely for us what a great expression of your love and god we're on this side of this thought that you had before the foundation of the world where you wanted to express these attributes that you had there's a reason that you wanted to express them it wasn't to be some show-off or to act like you got something but you wanted to be loved back in a way that the angels couldn't love you loved back with from a condition of sin to be able to step out of that condition accept you as a savior as a redeemer and to be able to hear praises from the redeemed saying thank you jesus for saving my soul thank you for the grace that you've had in my life today thank you for the grace that you gave me yesterday amen thank you for helping me through all my tests and my trials for for providing a waving through lord the hardships your grace is always there we thank you for being full of grace lord as we approach you at this time we're we're asking lord that that same grace could now be manifested inside of each one of us lord that when the world looks at us they won't see us anymore but they'll see you in us full of grace expressing grace to them to situations lord that our conversation when we talk about others could also be full of grace oh god let us be a living testimony lord we don't want you to come back to us and say pay up because we were unwilling to consider what you've done for us when we talked about others oh god i know this isn't easy for our flesh but god we didn't come here for our flesh today we come here lord that we might grow in grace we want to be an express image of that grace and everything that we say and everything that we think and everything that we do may you be seen lord lord we remember what the angel of the lord told brother branham tell the people that their thoughts think louder in heaven than the words here on earth lord may our even our thoughts be full of grace our works be full of grace all that we think say and do may it just bring you honor and glory heavenly father we commit ourselves to you as a body of believers here keep your hand upon us lord as we grow in this grace we ask now these things and give you the praise form in jesus wonderful name amen amen heavenly father i appreciate heavenly father i agree she ate you i love you adore you i bow down before you heavenly father
