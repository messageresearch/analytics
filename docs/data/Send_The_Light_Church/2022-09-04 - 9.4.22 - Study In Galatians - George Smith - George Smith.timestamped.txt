[37:40] [Music]
[37:45] good morning
[37:46] it's good to be here this morning
[37:50] right
[37:52] if you have your Bible we're going to
[37:54] look in the book of Galatians
[37:57] and um
[37:59] it's right after Corinthians
[38:03] and I think brother John for the
[38:05] invitation
[38:06] and to be
[38:08] one of them
[38:11] some people say well which one of them
[38:12] we're the ones going up
[38:15] we're not part of the other ones
[38:17] I just want to read these first five
[38:19] verses here to get started Paul an
[38:21] apostle not of men neither by man but of
[38:24] Jesus Christ and God the Father who
[38:26] raised him from the dead and all the
[38:28] Brethren which are with me unto the
[38:30] churches of galatia Grace speak to you
[38:32] and peace from God the father and from
[38:34] our Lord Jesus Christ
[38:36] who gave himself for our sins that he
[38:38] might Deliver Us from this present evil
[38:40] world according to the will of God and
[38:43] our father to whom be glory and ever
[38:45] forever and ever amen you may be seated
[38:49] now the
[38:51] um
[38:52] last time I was here was last year about
[38:55] this time
[38:56] we were in another church the first time
[38:59] I've actually ministered in your nice
[39:01] new church it's beautiful and the beauty
[39:04] of the church is in the beauty of the
[39:06] people
[39:07] but um
[39:08] we finished the book of Acts
[39:11] and if you don't remember then we'll
[39:12] have to start over
[39:15] but it was a good journey we had through
[39:18] the book of Acts and I'm not a
[39:20] theologian I don't you know put this
[39:22] together for certain reasons but I see
[39:24] where the way the Lord has directed this
[39:27] it's it's designed to make you want to
[39:31] go and read more of the word you see and
[39:34] Jesus himself said over next in John 8
[39:37] 32 you shall know the truth how are you
[39:40] going to know the truth because you were
[39:41] in the truth you got in there and you
[39:43] studied it you shall know the truth the
[39:45] truth shall make you free now the
[39:47] alternative to that because there's the
[39:50] A and the B you know so you shall know
[39:52] the truth and truth shall make you free
[39:53] but the alternative
[39:56] is to remain captive
[39:58] and possibly very deceived
[40:01] ignorant and with a no care attitude
[40:04] I'm sure you know a few people like that
[40:06] you know but God has employed the spirit
[40:10] of Elijah five times I don't know of any
[40:12] other Ministry that he
[40:14] um
[40:15] love so much that he used that many
[40:17] times but God employs the spirit of God
[40:20] the spirit of Elijah five times
[40:22] throughout history and the promise of
[40:24] our age is in Malachi 4 verses 5 and 6.
[40:27] now this isn't new to most of you but
[40:29] just to you know lay the groundwork and
[40:33] Jesus referred to this same verse
[40:36] when he's speaking over in Matthew 17 11
[40:39] and he clarified it a little bit made it
[40:41] a little more clear to turn the hearts
[40:44] means to restore to bring back to
[40:46] original and so we've been brought back
[40:49] to the original Apostolic Faith the
[40:52] apostolic Doctrine and the scripture you
[40:55] see so your homework for this week is to
[40:59] study Matthew 17 verses 10 through 13.
[41:04] keep in mind that Mr Schofield was a
[41:07] trained lawyer just like Martin Luther
[41:10] and so he looked at things in a a
[41:12] certain way
[41:14] and so
[41:15] all his all the work that Mr Schofield
[41:18] did or brother Schofield was with pen
[41:20] and pencil they didn't have a computer
[41:22] okay he had a few friends had paper that
[41:25] had pencils and they did all this work
[41:27] and they finished all their work
[41:30] on January 1st 1909.
[41:33] so yeah all that was already done
[41:36] and then you go study those verses see
[41:39] what he says about it in the in the
[41:41] bottom of the page and it's amazing
[41:43] because that has always been there for
[41:45] the last 110 years or so
[41:47] and why didn't we read it they yet
[41:50] unfulfilled yeah it's right there in the
[41:52] Bible but anyway God fulfilled his word
[41:55] in our generation and he sent
[41:58] his restoration Prophet exactly in the
[42:01] spirit of Elijah
[42:03] we knew he was William Branham
[42:05] and He restored the faith back to the
[42:07] scripture and so now we can know the
[42:10] truth
[42:11] and the truth sets us free it's not
[42:13] because so-and-so said so no because the
[42:15] word says so you see now in Acts chapter
[42:18] 15 we had a situation where there was
[42:21] controversies came up with yearly
[42:24] Believers and so the apostles had a bit
[42:26] of a conference and they came up with an
[42:28] epistle or a letter to be read in the
[42:30] groups back then and we would call it
[42:33] today we would call it Church order
[42:36] and so um so brother Paul and brother
[42:39] Barnabas stayed there in Antioch for a
[42:41] while and they had completed their first
[42:43] missionary journey they were resting
[42:45] enjoying the Revival and Paul was
[42:47] receiving letters from places where they
[42:50] had been
[42:51] now he was their father in The Gospel he
[42:53] had brought the gospel to them and
[42:56] um
[42:57] uh so he wrote letters back
[43:00] planting doctrinal seeds correcting
[43:02] situations and their trips were all on
[43:05] foot either on foot on a donkey maybe a
[43:08] horse but nothing like today
[43:11] so if we look at Acts chapter 15 for a
[43:14] minute
[43:15] uh let's see here
[43:17] you'll have to bear with me I'm getting
[43:19] used to these new progressive lenses
[43:22] and uh
[43:24] so chapter 15 of Acts verse 36 and some
[43:30] days later Paul said unto Barnabas let
[43:32] us go again and visit our brother in
[43:34] every city where that we have preached
[43:36] the word of the Lord and see how they do
[43:38] so they'd finished one Journey they
[43:40] stayed there a while and that's when he
[43:43] was getting these letters so between
[43:44] verses 35 and 36 is where we find him
[43:48] writing this letter to the Believers in
[43:51] several areas of galatia
[43:53] this was an area that was under Roman
[43:55] rule at the time and he described it in
[43:58] his first trip in Acts 13 and 14 and
[44:00] later in chapter 16 of Acts but of great
[44:03] significance at this point I'd like to
[44:05] say that
[44:06] um Martin Luther
[44:09] um
[44:09] said the words of Saint Paul are not
[44:12] dead words they're living creatures and
[44:14] they have hands and feet they are alive
[44:18] you know it's not just flat you know
[44:20] and so um
[44:22] so we must read the word carefully not
[44:25] like a newspaper you see and if you
[44:27] remember when brother Brown was telling
[44:29] about beyond the curtain of time it was
[44:31] all based on the fact that he preached
[44:32] what Paul preached
[44:34] and we all that were there we said we're
[44:36] depending on that not that you knew my
[44:39] name and my grandmother's and all that
[44:40] no that you preached but Paul preached
[44:42] you know so it's very important now back
[44:45] in those days they did not have the um
[44:49] advantage of voice recordings or video
[44:51] recordings
[44:53] with the luxury that we have to hear the
[44:56] changes in voice and and decide for each
[44:58] one of us what he really meant no they
[45:01] didn't have that it was letters they
[45:03] wrote it very carefully and that's why
[45:05] and keep turning in First Corinthians
[45:07] chapter one
[45:10] um
[45:11] First Corinthians chapter 1 verse 21 he
[45:14] says for after that in the wisdom of God
[45:16] the World by wisdom knew not God it
[45:20] pleased God by the foolishness of
[45:21] preaching to save them that believe so
[45:24] preaching is Forever part of the word of
[45:26] God and you know not everyone today
[45:29] understands Kentucky English
[45:31] uh I know it's hard to believe but uh
[45:34] I've been to different parts of this
[45:35] country and uh and other countries
[45:38] around the world
[45:40] and we have you know we have the English
[45:42] recordings
[45:44] but there's still an infinite number of
[45:46] interpretations even in English and but
[45:49] he plainly said say what the tapes say
[45:51] so you know it's my uh it's my opinion
[45:56] at least that you must pray before you
[45:58] even open your Bible you know you must
[46:01] get into the proper spirit before you
[46:04] even listen to God's Prophet you don't
[46:06] just turn on like changing the stations
[46:08] on a radio you know and so today uh with
[46:12] your permission we're going to preach
[46:13] out of brother randoms absolute it's
[46:15] called Holy Scripture
[46:17] now these people in galatia which is
[46:20] currently a part of Turkey
[46:22] these people were Greek citizens okay
[46:24] but they were descendants
[46:27] from the Gauls that's g-a-u-l-l-s
[46:32] um people from the north from France
[46:34] Belgium Switzerland along with original
[46:37] Celts and they were a blend of Italian
[46:39] Greek and Jew as one historian writes a
[46:42] stream from the torrent of Barbarians
[46:45] which poured into Greece in the third
[46:47] Century before Christ
[46:49] so not real Pleasant people but that's
[46:52] that's what the Galatians were so even
[46:56] though they had been in the area for 200
[46:57] years
[46:58] they did they just had a different set
[47:00] of values you know when somebody moves
[47:02] in here from Canada or from wherever
[47:04] they just see things a little
[47:06] differently you know they go through
[47:08] Walmart and they pick up different stuff
[47:09] than you do different set of values and
[47:12] uh so as new believers they were not
[47:14] totally settled in this new way they had
[47:17] heard they were baptized and they
[47:19] believed but they weren't totally
[47:20] settled and therefore they became easy
[47:22] pickings for these judaizing
[47:25] missionaries
[47:27] that came up from Palestine which were
[47:29] converts from very strict Jewish
[47:32] religion following the exact words of
[47:35] Moses
[47:36] converted into the liberty of Christ and
[47:38] what they were proposing to these people
[47:40] no you can't just come into this you've
[47:42] got to come through Judaism okay
[47:44] something's wrong here so these wheel
[47:46] these well-meaning legalists were intent
[47:49] on bending the minds of the new
[47:51] believers
[47:52] and um these lovely people were just
[47:55] simply out of balance
[47:58] and that's why we brought our friend
[48:00] here
[48:01] to there's nowhere earlier to put it
[48:03] we'll put it down here and you can
[48:03] imagine but
[48:06] um
[48:07] that's to give you a visual
[48:10] when I say balance that's what we're
[48:11] talking about got to be even
[48:13] can't be you know lopsided and no
[48:16] everything's got to be even so these
[48:18] people were out of balance so Paul had
[48:20] to administer the grace of God to bring
[48:23] the situation back level again refocus
[48:26] on Calvary okay
[48:28] and um I'll try not to get lost here in
[48:31] order pages but um there's two things he
[48:34] had to deal with in the book of
[48:35] Galatians one they were teaching strict
[48:37] obedience to the law of Moses which must
[48:40] be mingled with faith in order for the
[48:42] sinner to obtain
[48:44] justification
[48:46] in their narrow of you they could not
[48:48] see Jesus as a replacement for the law
[48:51] of Moses they did not understand the
[48:53] scriptures and the grace of God and they
[48:56] were not flexible and able to turn the
[48:58] corner
[49:00] they couldn't stay balanced they
[49:01] couldn't just follow what the word says
[49:03] see and two
[49:06] um then the Justified believer is made
[49:07] perfect by keeping the law
[49:10] so they were teaching that Christ Alone
[49:11] was not sufficient this message needs
[49:14] our help
[49:15] and I have heard that a lot of times in
[49:18] my short lifetime
[49:19] brother Brandon's okay yeah he didn't
[49:21] really know his Bible too well so we're
[49:23] going to help him
[49:24] that's not the way it works no he had
[49:26] the Vindication we're just repeaters and
[49:29] so when Luther came along you know in
[49:31] the the fifth messenger his message was
[49:34] Christ Alone we don't need all these
[49:35] Trinkets and all this stuff and candles
[49:37] and blah blah blah you people that came
[49:39] from Catholicism you know exactly what
[49:41] we're talking about so he had to stand
[49:42] against all that stuff but we've come
[49:44] full circle now and we've got all the
[49:47] trinkets again
[49:48] under the guise of Malachi 4. it's
[49:51] pathetic we're going to get to that why
[49:53] we're doing that so after prayer
[49:56] Paul wrote what we know is six chapters
[49:58] to bring balance
[50:00] to these followers in galatia
[50:03] so we've read the salutation of
[50:06] um
[50:07] uh Paul over here in first in chapter
[50:10] one and so it's a lengthy salutation but
[50:14] with all respect and love of the
[50:16] Brethren you know it's it's all one
[50:18] sentence he was great at using words
[50:20] what we read there verses one through
[50:22] five is one sentence you see so we could
[50:25] eat we could learn even from that and um
[50:28] and the fact is that we always have the
[50:31] twin that shows up anytime you have a a
[50:33] move of God whatever size or small or
[50:35] big there's always the twin to try to
[50:38] knock it down every time you see
[50:41] so
[50:42] um verse six and seven I Marvel that you
[50:46] are so soon removed from him that called
[50:49] you into the grace of Christ into
[50:51] another gospel which is not another
[50:55] but there are there be some that trouble
[50:57] you and would pervert the gospel of
[50:59] Christ you see so they had gone off on a
[51:04] side road of imagination they they
[51:06] wandered off the track thinking that
[51:09] it's going to be okay yeah we we love
[51:11] Paul we love Christ but you know this
[51:13] this law this sounds a little more
[51:14] something we can do we put our two
[51:16] dollars into it no
[51:18] so
[51:20] acts 4
[51:22] says neither is there salvation in any
[51:25] other for there's no other name under
[51:28] Heaven given among men who are most
[51:30] whereby we must be saved so there's only
[51:33] one way to God by the cross that's why
[51:35] it's up here so you can see it every
[51:36] time you come to church
[51:37] there's no other way Allah will not take
[51:40] you to the Cross Allah will take you to
[51:41] the hot place
[51:43] guaranteed
[51:44] sorry but it's true there's only one way
[51:47] to heaven you see and so to keep the
[51:50] foundation steady and level uh we can
[51:53] look at over a second second Timothy
[51:55] that's right back here
[51:58] um Second Timothy chapter 3
[52:02] where he um he's writing a letter to
[52:04] Timothy
[52:06] he says over here in verse 16 all
[52:09] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[52:12] and is profitable for Doctrine for
[52:14] reproof for correction for instruction
[52:16] for righteousness that the man of God
[52:18] may be perfectly thorough be perfect
[52:20] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[52:22] so bottom line is God Is Not the author
[52:25] of confusion
[52:27] that's comes from somewhere else you see
[52:30] so our messenger plainly said you read
[52:33] your Bible and pray every day
[52:36] and uh if you study the message at all
[52:39] you'll find it where he says back to the
[52:41] word over 200 times so it might be
[52:44] important it wasn't just a little hint
[52:45] back to the word over 200 times
[52:49] and um
[52:51] the the fact is that God knows what is
[52:54] going on he knows how to take care of
[52:57] things
[52:58] and he's a god of order
[53:00] he's not a god of disorder and however
[53:02] it falls no and that's why brother John
[53:05] took so much care to you know make
[53:06] things look nice here there's a reason
[53:09] you know and so um uh verse 8 and 9
[53:15] but though we okay that's him his
[53:18] helpers
[53:19] you know John Martin George Smith
[53:21] William Brandon whoever we or even if an
[53:24] angel comes out of heaven
[53:28] um preach any other gospel unto you then
[53:31] that which I already have preached to
[53:32] you by Revelation let him be accursed in
[53:35] other words you don't pay attention you
[53:37] don't try to reason with him you cut it
[53:38] off you see yeah and if you wasn't
[53:41] paying attention verse 9 as I just said
[53:43] to you so say I now again if any man
[53:46] preaches any other gospel uh unto you
[53:49] then that which we have than what you
[53:51] have received let him be accursed so
[53:54] that is why we have so many problems
[53:56] today worldwide in churches around the
[54:00] world not just the people carrying these
[54:01] books but
[54:03] big and small churches because they're
[54:05] not sticking with Paul said
[54:08] my brother branham's the only person I
[54:09] know that God took beyond the curtain
[54:11] time brought back and told what he saw
[54:13] and it was in line with scripture and so
[54:16] that was the that was the Crux of it
[54:18] right there I preach what Paul preached
[54:21] no problem well if if we would examine
[54:24] our experience in our Doctrine by
[54:27] scripture we wouldn't have so many
[54:29] problems it's got to be it's got to be
[54:31] Bible or forget it you see so
[54:35] um
[54:36] I'm you know it's too bad that that it
[54:38] uh hurts people's feelings but we're not
[54:40] playing games
[54:41] we're not giving out gold stars you
[54:43] don't get free coffee if you come to
[54:44] church you come you listen you live it
[54:46] you know
[54:48] so if we apply the magnifying glass
[54:50] we'll find that every confusing issue
[54:54] that we have leads right back to verse
[54:56] 8. which is because they're not saying
[54:59] what Paul said that's the filter that's
[55:01] the verse for the time that we're living
[55:04] in and so if any issue doesn't pass
[55:07] through the word test with the message
[55:10] with Paul forget it I don't care how
[55:13] nice it sounds what the promises are you
[55:15] gotta stick with the truth that's right
[55:17] okay so 11-23 is where
[55:22] he testifies of his apostleship being
[55:24] called of God because Vindication is
[55:27] very important
[55:28] either you're with God or you're not and
[55:31] you can't pretend this isn't this isn't
[55:34] Disney no it's reality
[55:37] and um that is why we're very careful
[55:39] about what we hear what we speak because
[55:42] many people today have great ideas you
[55:44] know convictions they'll fight you for
[55:46] their version of the truth I've seen
[55:48] them they will literally fight you and
[55:50] burn your house down for their version
[55:52] of the truth
[55:54] but if it doesn't square with Paul we're
[55:57] not interested you see I hate to be very
[56:01] repetitious but it has to be said so
[56:04] I have one simple question of them for
[56:07] them okay where is your Vindication now
[56:09] you're fighting for this version where's
[56:11] your Vindication where's your picture of
[56:13] the pillar of fire right you know so
[56:15] it's not there so the word has not been
[56:18] quickened so it's only words on paper to
[56:21] a lot of people
[56:22] and um it will never be quickened until
[56:25] you're born again
[56:26] now if you don't enjoy the word then you
[56:28] need more time in prayer you need to get
[56:31] closer to God so that his word can feed
[56:33] you
[56:33] so anybody with Elementary education can
[56:36] open the Bible That's not hard to do
[56:39] but the word has to be revealed to you
[56:41] personally brother Brian says look for
[56:44] Revelation more than anything else it's
[56:46] more important than your job your wife
[56:47] anything because if God's not revealed
[56:50] to you then it's just words on paper you
[56:51] see so that's why we take our time and
[56:54] go through this uh slowly if we can and
[56:58] to be sure that everybody understands
[57:00] because we didn't come here to waste
[57:02] time
[57:02] when you come here just to see what
[57:04] George looks like or why did you know
[57:06] John where what is that purple
[57:09] whatever it's not blue yeah
[57:13] did you dress yourself
[57:16] so we have to
[57:18] create the atmosphere for the work you
[57:20] see Hunger for the word okay let's look
[57:23] at verse 13 of chapter one it says here
[57:25] for ye have heard of my conversation in
[57:29] time past that means my lifestyle
[57:32] with the Jews religion
[57:34] how the beyond measure I persecuted the
[57:36] Church of God and wasted it because he
[57:38] was zealous for what he believed he was
[57:41] a follower of Moses and anything that
[57:44] didn't line up with Moses out of here
[57:46] and of course we have movies and
[57:48] everything else about it but he was very
[57:50] zealous
[57:51] and uh profited in the Jews religion
[57:53] above many my equals in my own Nation
[57:56] being more exceedingly zealous of the
[57:59] traditions of my fathers so right there
[58:01] traditions of my fathers he knew it
[58:03] wasn't it was revealed to him there
[58:04] wasn't word but they had it was so
[58:07] ingrained in them so ingrained
[58:10] just like when Peter uh you remember
[58:13] back in chapter 10 of Acts
[58:15] Peter being you know come from Judaism
[58:17] and he wasn't a real educated person but
[58:19] just in their everyday life
[58:21] just like you the you guys were in
[58:23] Catholicism it's just your everyday life
[58:25] we do it because that's what they told
[58:27] us
[58:28] they didn't have to match the Bible and
[58:30] so Peter back there
[58:32] um no we don't eat these things we don't
[58:33] eat those things and then that sheet
[58:35] came down from heaven with all these
[58:36] animal centers you know because that was
[58:39] his vision it wasn't mine
[58:40] he had to get the interpretation to it
[58:42] but
[58:44] no Lord I'm I'm holy I'm Jewish I've
[58:47] never touched that kind of stuff
[58:49] but God was showing him it's time to
[58:51] turn the corner it's okay to go to the
[58:52] Gentiles now and you know the whole
[58:54] story okay verse 15. but when it pleased
[58:57] God who separated me from my mother's
[58:59] womb and called me by his grace to
[59:01] reveal his son in me that I might preach
[59:03] him among the Heathen that's us
[59:05] immediately I conferred not with flesh
[59:08] and blood neither one after Jerusalem to
[59:10] them there were Apostles before me but I
[59:12] went into Arabia and returned again unto
[59:14] Damascus
[59:16] then after three years I went up to
[59:18] Jerusalem to see Peter in a boat with
[59:20] them 15 days that's two weeks
[59:22] but other of the Apostles I didn't see
[59:24] any except James the Lord's brother now
[59:27] the things which I write to you behold
[59:30] before God I align on afterwards I came
[59:32] to the regions of Syria and celicia and
[59:37] was Unknown by faith unto the churches
[59:39] of Judea which were in Christ but they
[59:40] had heard only that he which persecuted
[59:43] Us in times past now preaches Faith
[59:47] which ones he destroyed
[59:49] and they glorify God in Me
[59:52] now that had to be a big challenge for
[59:54] those people back there yeah
[59:55] because here's the guy
[59:57] and he killed Grandma it was that simple
[1:00:00] and then these people are in jail and
[1:00:02] everything because they're part of the
[1:00:04] way
[1:00:05] and so uh now he's preaching the truth
[1:00:08] well it would take a little bit of time
[1:00:10] to adjust to that you know
[1:00:12] um brother Ryan who says we with our
[1:00:15] American Spirit would have never picked
[1:00:16] Paul forget it bad boy
[1:00:19] but God says don't touch him he's my man
[1:00:21] now why God let him do all these other
[1:00:23] things
[1:00:24] only God knows why did God permit
[1:00:26] William Branham to to listen to his
[1:00:28] mother-in-law and all those thousands
[1:00:30] and thousands of people destroyed in the
[1:00:31] flood that he could have avoided all
[1:00:33] that God knows he didn't ask us to
[1:00:36] figure it out
[1:00:38] so all the Church of Jesus Christ back
[1:00:40] at that time would have been very
[1:00:42] suspicious of this guy Paul
[1:00:44] but once they had Fellowship once they
[1:00:46] heard him defend the name of Jesus
[1:00:47] Christ they were at peace and they
[1:00:50] glorified God in Me
[1:00:51] it was all settled it was back balance
[1:00:53] okay chapter two
[1:00:55] we're only having one service today
[1:00:57] right
[1:01:01] is there any food left over from Allison
[1:01:02] last night
[1:01:04] so chapter two is all about the
[1:01:06] circumcision and the Face-Off he had
[1:01:09] with Peter and you can read it very
[1:01:11] carefully verses 20 through 21 where are
[1:01:15] we at here at the end of the chapter
[1:01:17] he says I am crucified with Christ
[1:01:19] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[1:01:21] lives in me in the Life which I now live
[1:01:23] in the flesh I live by the faith of the
[1:01:25] Son of God Who Loved Me gave himself for
[1:01:28] me
[1:01:29] I do not frustrate or contradict the
[1:01:32] grace of God
[1:01:33] for if righteousness comes by the law
[1:01:36] then Christ is dead in vain
[1:01:38] so the law was over here that's all they
[1:01:40] knew just remember all they had was the
[1:01:43] Bible down through Malachi they didn't
[1:01:44] have a new testament they were living it
[1:01:46] out it wasn't written
[1:01:48] you know they had they had the um the
[1:01:50] testimonies of the Apostles
[1:01:53] but the scriptures was back here that
[1:01:55] that's the only Bible they had
[1:01:57] and so
[1:01:59] um if that's if that's all there is and
[1:02:02] we have to obey these these rules well
[1:02:05] then why did Christ die but the message
[1:02:06] was you all memorize this back here
[1:02:09] here's the Fulfillment of it here this
[1:02:11] day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:02:14] same thing we're preaching today the
[1:02:16] Bible says it we saw it we heard it and
[1:02:20] people still don't believe because they
[1:02:22] like their Traditions they like the the
[1:02:24] Baptist the Methodist the whatever you
[1:02:26] know they're going around around Circle
[1:02:27] and not really getting out of their
[1:02:29] comfort zone but you've made a bold step
[1:02:31] to come away from whatever you were to
[1:02:33] believe the truth amen so God knows what
[1:02:36] he's doing so in his explanation of the
[1:02:39] truth he had to deal with uh items of
[1:02:42] the law
[1:02:44] that these people wanted to impose on
[1:02:46] these new Believers these people in
[1:02:47] galatia so if we focus on Father Abraham
[1:02:50] for example uh Romans 4 Galatians 3 and
[1:02:53] James 2 Abraham believed God and it was
[1:02:56] counted or attributed like credit to
[1:02:59] your bank account attributed to for
[1:03:02] righteousness and second Corinthians 5 7
[1:03:05] we walk by faith not by sight so a plea
[1:03:09] a Believer simply believes God by faith
[1:03:12] Revelation not because you learned it by
[1:03:15] memory anybody can read and memorize but
[1:03:18] what about being revealed you know get
[1:03:20] on inside to where it's a part of us
[1:03:23] so that's what chapter two has to deal
[1:03:25] with chapter 3 verse 1
[1:03:29] all foolish Galatians
[1:03:31] who has Bewitched you
[1:03:34] that you should not obey the truth
[1:03:36] before whose eyes Jesus Christ have been
[1:03:38] evidently set forth crucified among you
[1:03:43] great question you know and see most
[1:03:46] people back then couldn't read
[1:03:49] so it's not like today
[1:03:51] uh they sure didn't have cell phones or
[1:03:53] anything they couldn't read and they
[1:03:54] depended on the clergy to tell them you
[1:03:56] know the truth and um uh in verse two he
[1:04:01] says this only what I learn of you
[1:04:03] received you the Spirit by The Works of
[1:04:05] the law or by the hearing of the faith
[1:04:08] ah another good question
[1:04:10] are you so foolish having begun in the
[1:04:12] spirit are you now made perfect by the
[1:04:15] flesh
[1:04:16] so he's he goes right to the point
[1:04:18] doesn't fool around see and um
[1:04:22] on down through five have you suffered
[1:04:24] so many things in vain if it be yet in
[1:04:27] vain he therefore that ministereth to
[1:04:30] you of the spirit
[1:04:32] and works miracles among you
[1:04:34] does he do it by The Works of the law or
[1:04:36] the hearing of faith
[1:04:38] so what Paul was doing he was making
[1:04:40] Christ real to those people yes this is
[1:04:43] only uh probably 50 years after the
[1:04:45] crucifixion more or less and it was
[1:04:48] something very fresh this is the new
[1:04:49] religion you might say but it's based in
[1:04:51] their scripture it wasn't based on on
[1:04:53] anything else and so brother bran says
[1:04:56] today that The Minister's job is to make
[1:04:59] Christ real to the people so we read it
[1:05:02] we try to make it real too he had you
[1:05:04] know he had his many ways of making
[1:05:06] Christ real so we Gentiles are the
[1:05:09] children of Abraham and we walk by faith
[1:05:12] just as Paul did you know and it's like
[1:05:15] he told us over here in chapter two I'm
[1:05:18] crucified with Christ now it's not me
[1:05:21] it's Christ's living units so it all
[1:05:22] fits together and yes there's some
[1:05:25] repetitions necessary so verse 6 of
[1:05:28] chapter 3 even as Abraham believed God
[1:05:31] it was accounted to him for
[1:05:32] righteousness now there's one there's
[1:05:33] many other places know you therefore
[1:05:35] that they which are of Faith the same
[1:05:38] are the children of Abraham
[1:05:40] and the scripture for seeing that God
[1:05:43] would justify the Heathen through faith
[1:05:45] preached before the gospel under Abraham
[1:05:47] saying in these shall All Nations be
[1:05:49] blessed
[1:05:52] so then they which be of Faith are
[1:05:56] blessed with faithful Abraham
[1:05:59] so yes we are children of Abraham we're
[1:06:01] living in the 21st century not under
[1:06:04] Traditions not under customs of the
[1:06:06] elders and God does not expect us to
[1:06:09] dress like Abraham and then live in
[1:06:11] tents and so forth but to have the same
[1:06:13] Faith perfect faith we believe right
[1:06:17] alongside Abraham you see and um
[1:06:21] what Abraham Christ uh
[1:06:25] would they be or even William Brandon
[1:06:27] would he be comfortable walking
[1:06:28] alongside you
[1:06:30] know would you be comfortable if Abraham
[1:06:33] was walking beside you one day or if
[1:06:35] Christ or brother ran him you know so we
[1:06:38] are of the same of the same uh thinking
[1:06:44] um
[1:06:45] verse 8 and the scripture foreseeing the
[1:06:48] god justify the Heathen yeah we read
[1:06:49] that okay so that's referring back to
[1:06:51] Genesis 12 3 where that God made the
[1:06:53] promise to Abraham let's look at that
[1:06:55] real close
[1:06:57] uh Genesis 12 and verse 3.
[1:07:00] and if you didn't bring your Bible well
[1:07:02] I'll say shame on you because you came
[1:07:04] to battle without a gun
[1:07:06] uh 12 and 3
[1:07:09] and I will bless them that bless thee
[1:07:10] and curse him the curseth thee and
[1:07:13] indeed shall all the families of the
[1:07:15] earth be blessed
[1:07:16] there's the promise right there now we
[1:07:19] have in the Middle East we've got the
[1:07:21] Jews which are children of Abraham and
[1:07:24] we've got the Arabs which are children
[1:07:25] of Abraham yes
[1:07:27] because if you study your Bible you'll
[1:07:28] find out that
[1:07:31] um you know uh
[1:07:34] Hagar brought Abraham a son and his name
[1:07:37] was Ishmael
[1:07:39] okay the Seed of Abraham
[1:07:41] and
[1:07:43] he had 12 sons and Isaac had 12 sons
[1:07:47] so now God's got to divide things up and
[1:07:49] when he divided the land he gave the
[1:07:51] children of Ishmael more square miles
[1:07:54] than he gave the children of Isaac
[1:07:59] and they're not happy with that they
[1:08:01] want to push Isaac's people into the sea
[1:08:03] and be done with them well it's not
[1:08:05] going to happen but um uh
[1:08:08] the fact is they're all children of
[1:08:10] Abraham you see and they have the
[1:08:13] promise now when you go over there
[1:08:15] some of you have been there
[1:08:17] um you're going down the road okay
[1:08:18] here's the Israelites living here the
[1:08:20] Jewish people and the Arabs living over
[1:08:22] here
[1:08:23] so the Israel people they have the nice
[1:08:24] painted fence cars washed trees trimmed
[1:08:27] houses painted but over here you've got
[1:08:30] people living in misery
[1:08:33] yeah the car's on blocks the weeds are
[1:08:35] grown up and so the tourists ask how
[1:08:38] come
[1:08:39] and the tour guide says very simple
[1:08:41] Genesis says I'll bless those who bless
[1:08:43] thee I'll curse those that curse thee
[1:08:46] so if I was a if I was you know Arab
[1:08:50] um I saw there's an obvious difference
[1:08:52] here
[1:08:53] I would I would say well let's try it
[1:08:55] for six months see if it works
[1:08:57] let's just let's just honor the god of
[1:08:59] Israel see if if the promise works you
[1:09:01] know
[1:09:02] but um uh they um
[1:09:06] they live the way they do and so Christ
[1:09:10] alive in your daily life shows which
[1:09:12] side of the fence you live on Amen okay
[1:09:15] we're in chapter three and verse 10. for
[1:09:18] as many as are of works of the law are
[1:09:20] under the curse for these written curses
[1:09:22] everyone that continueth not in all
[1:09:25] things which are written in the book of
[1:09:27] the law to do them but that no man is
[1:09:30] justified by the law in the sight of God
[1:09:32] it is evident but the just shall live by
[1:09:35] faith and see he didn't make that up
[1:09:37] he's quoting scripture which is in
[1:09:39] habakkuk 2 4.
[1:09:41] and the law is not of Faith but the man
[1:09:45] that doeth them shall live in them
[1:09:48] so
[1:09:49] he's quoting from a scripture written
[1:09:53] 600 years before Christ the scripture
[1:09:56] that Paul also uses in Romans 1 17 and
[1:09:59] in Hebrews 10 38 and we're most familiar
[1:10:02] with you know when Martin Luther you
[1:10:04] know was reading it it struck him about
[1:10:05] 500 years ago
[1:10:07] God's word is living it's got fingers
[1:10:10] and toes it's moving it's real
[1:10:13] verse 13 Christ hath redeemed us from
[1:10:16] the curse of the law being made a curse
[1:10:18] for us for it is written cursed to
[1:10:20] everyone that heneth on a tree that The
[1:10:23] Blessing of Abraham might come on the
[1:10:24] Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we
[1:10:27] might receive the promise of the spirit
[1:10:29] through faith you see so Christ suffered
[1:10:32] and died we all believe that and he was
[1:10:36] buried he rose again the third day
[1:10:38] for you and for me to bring the blessing
[1:10:40] of Abraham unto us the Gentiles it's all
[1:10:43] by faith there's nobody here that's seen
[1:10:46] God we have his word this is where we
[1:10:48] see him you see
[1:10:50] so we jump down to verse 24.
[1:10:53] of chapter three wherefore the law was
[1:10:56] our Schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ
[1:10:58] so there was a good purpose in the law
[1:11:00] it kept us in the word it brought us to
[1:11:03] Christ that we might be justified by
[1:11:05] faith okay
[1:11:07] but after that faith has come we're no
[1:11:11] longer under the Schoolmaster okay
[1:11:13] that's that's finished we graduated to
[1:11:14] Faith you see and uh verse 26
[1:11:18] for you are all the children of God by
[1:11:21] faith in Jesus Christ for as many as you
[1:11:24] as you have been baptized unto Christ
[1:11:26] have put on Christ
[1:11:28] that's the purpose of the baptism is to
[1:11:31] show the world what has been done on the
[1:11:32] inside
[1:11:33] look over at Romans
[1:11:36] chapter 6 real quickly here
[1:11:39] just for a minute
[1:11:41] let's see Romans 6
[1:11:45] and verse 3.
[1:11:49] of Romans 6.
[1:11:51] know you not that so many no you're not
[1:11:53] that so many of us were as were baptized
[1:11:56] in the Jesus Christ were baptized unto
[1:11:58] his death therefore we are buried with
[1:12:00] him by baptism unto death that like as
[1:12:04] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[1:12:06] glory of God the Father even so we also
[1:12:09] should walk in newness of life and
[1:12:11] that's the whole purpose of water
[1:12:13] baptism
[1:12:15] so back to Galatians chapter 3 verse 28
[1:12:21] there's neither Jew nor Greek
[1:12:24] that's what he was dealing with there or
[1:12:25] we could say today neither
[1:12:26] African-American Mexican whatever
[1:12:28] there's neither uh Bond or free there's
[1:12:31] neither male or female for we all one in
[1:12:34] Christ Jesus and if we beat Christ then
[1:12:37] are you Abraham's seed and heirs
[1:12:39] according to the promise
[1:12:41] so God looks at us differently than we
[1:12:43] see each other he only sees redeemed
[1:12:46] people he sees you know redeemed people
[1:12:49] worshiping him all focusing on the Lamb
[1:12:52] of God and that is one of the benchmarks
[1:12:55] of this wonderful message that we
[1:12:57] Proclaim
[1:12:59] the um
[1:13:03] the attention was never on the messenger
[1:13:07] it's my personal opinion because I was
[1:13:09] there when he died
[1:13:11] that one of the main reasons God
[1:13:14] probably took him at that time because
[1:13:15] idolatry was gaining strength you see
[1:13:18] the attention was never on William bran
[1:13:20] it was on Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:13:22] see and we have The Loving Story of of
[1:13:25] elies are going to seek the bride for
[1:13:27] Isaac in Genesis 24. brother REM said
[1:13:30] that's an exact
[1:13:31] picture of my Ministry aliens are going
[1:13:34] to get the bride for the bridegroom
[1:13:36] okay
[1:13:38] so and yes we're breezing through this
[1:13:41] so that you can go back and read it for
[1:13:42] yourself but chapter four uh more
[1:13:45] comparisons of Grace versus law verse 8
[1:13:48] for example how be it then when you knew
[1:13:52] not God okay you didn't know God
[1:13:54] you did service unto them which by
[1:13:56] Nature are no Gods which okay they're
[1:13:58] worshiping idols
[1:14:01] um but now after that you have known God
[1:14:04] or rather are known of God I'll turn you
[1:14:07] again to weak empirically elements where
[1:14:10] until you desire again to be in bondage
[1:14:12] why are you going back to that stuff
[1:14:14] You observe days and months and times
[1:14:16] and years
[1:14:18] and he says I'm afraid of you lest I
[1:14:21] have bestowed upon you labor in vain
[1:14:23] Brethren I beseech you be as I am
[1:14:27] for I am as you are you have not injured
[1:14:30] me at all you know how though through
[1:14:32] infirmities of the flesh I preached the
[1:14:34] gospel unto you at the first and my
[1:14:37] Temptation which was in my flesh you
[1:14:39] despise not nor rejected but received me
[1:14:42] as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus
[1:14:46] verse 28. now we Brethren as Isaac was
[1:14:50] are the children of promise
[1:14:53] but as then
[1:14:55] but as then he that was born after the
[1:14:58] flesh persecuted him that was born after
[1:15:00] the spirit even so it is now and it's
[1:15:03] going on to this day and will go on to
[1:15:05] the last day
[1:15:07] because you can never appease the enemy
[1:15:10] if you had a if you had a map with a
[1:15:13] thousand pieces to it
[1:15:15] 999 would be the the Islam people and
[1:15:19] one is Judaism they can't stand that
[1:15:22] they want to wipe that one out also
[1:15:25] so God is in charge of this whole thing
[1:15:27] see we don't have to bite our
[1:15:30] fingernails he's in charge he's got the
[1:15:32] whole thing under control because he
[1:15:33] sees the whole thing on one page
[1:15:35] he knows the end from the beginning
[1:15:38] okay chapter five uh verse one what do
[1:15:41] we have here
[1:15:43] Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty
[1:15:45] where with Christ have made us free and
[1:15:47] be not entangled again with the Yoke of
[1:15:50] bondage
[1:15:51] verse 6 for in Christ Jesus for in Jesus
[1:15:54] Christ neither circumcision available
[1:15:56] anything or uncircumcision but Faith
[1:15:58] with which worketh by love
[1:16:02] and then verse 13 for Brethren ye have
[1:16:06] been called unto Liberty only use not
[1:16:09] Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but
[1:16:12] by love serve one another
[1:16:14] for all the law is fulfilled in one word
[1:16:16] even in this Thou shalt love thy
[1:16:19] neighbor as thyself
[1:16:21] but if you bite and devour one another
[1:16:24] take heed that she be not consumed
[1:16:27] because you will be if you keep it up
[1:16:30] verse 16. this I say walk in the spirit
[1:16:33] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[1:16:35] the flesh and that's why when Temptation
[1:16:38] comes things start to get tough go back
[1:16:41] to the word put on the proper music
[1:16:43] change the atmosphere
[1:16:45] we are miserable because we make it that
[1:16:48] way a lot of times we we go to the wrong
[1:16:50] websites we we do things no get back to
[1:16:53] what's right
[1:16:55] to see
[1:16:57] where are we at here 15 16 yeah 17. for
[1:17:01] the flesh lusts against the spirit and
[1:17:04] the spirit against the flesh we all know
[1:17:06] that we're adults and these are contrary
[1:17:08] one to another so that you cannot do the
[1:17:11] things that she would
[1:17:13] but if you be led of the spirit you are
[1:17:15] not under the law now the works of the
[1:17:18] flesh are manifest which are these
[1:17:19] adultery fornication and cleanness
[1:17:21] lasciviousness idolatry which care for
[1:17:24] hatred variants and relations wrath
[1:17:25] strife seditions heresies and things man
[1:17:28] it's a whole big list of bad things
[1:17:29] right he says here of the which I tell
[1:17:32] you before as I have also told you in
[1:17:34] time past that they which do such things
[1:17:36] shall not inherit the kingdom of God
[1:17:39] so there it is it's black it's white you
[1:17:42] got a choice
[1:17:43] verse 22 but the fruit of the spirit is
[1:17:47] love joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[1:17:50] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[1:17:52] against such there is no law
[1:17:55] and they that are Christ have crucified
[1:17:58] the flesh with the affections and lusts
[1:18:01] if we live in the spirit let us also
[1:18:03] walk in the spirit
[1:18:05] let's not be desirous of vain Glory
[1:18:07] provoking one another envying one
[1:18:09] another no no contention no bad
[1:18:12] attitudes those aren't fruits of the
[1:18:14] spirit those aren't you you can't be
[1:18:17] hateful and read the word of God
[1:18:19] one is going to win and you're going to
[1:18:21] lose out you know
[1:18:23] so
[1:18:24] there's a lot of good instruction in
[1:18:27] these six chapters and in six and verse
[1:18:31] one Brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[1:18:33] fault okay it happens you which are
[1:18:36] spiritual restore such a one in the
[1:18:39] spirit of meekness considering thyself
[1:18:41] lest also thou be tempted Okay so
[1:18:45] is possible and we've we've known
[1:18:48] there's people fall into traps you know
[1:18:50] and but they have a genuine desire to be
[1:18:52] free unless they're lying to you and
[1:18:54] then of course you're going to get worse
[1:18:56] but those that are strong spiritually
[1:18:58] the clean life restore such a one in
[1:19:01] meekness in other words in humility not
[1:19:04] with power not with shaming and you
[1:19:06] sorry thing no in meekness
[1:19:09] do as you would want to be treated
[1:19:11] because we're all human you know so uh
[1:19:15] just imagine Jesus stopping by and
[1:19:17] washing your feet
[1:19:18] that would make you pretty humble that's
[1:19:20] right you know
[1:19:21] so verse 2 very ye one another's burdens
[1:19:24] and so fulfill the law of Christ
[1:19:27] how do we wear one another's burdens
[1:19:29] it's a good question by staying in
[1:19:31] prayer
[1:19:33] okay stay in prayer with the correct
[1:19:35] atmosphere around you at all times so
[1:19:38] that you are there when you're needed
[1:19:41] you can't be
[1:19:42] excuse me can be fighting in court and
[1:19:46] all kinds of bad things and then called
[1:19:48] on for service no you gotta you got to
[1:19:50] stay in in the spirit of Christ so that
[1:19:54] you're there when you're needed
[1:19:56] and in that capacity you can help those
[1:19:58] that are in need of comfort be a help
[1:20:02] when possible be patient with all and
[1:20:05] when needed we can warn the ones that
[1:20:08] are acting inappropriately
[1:20:10] uh-huh
[1:20:13] that's true first Thessalonians chapter
[1:20:15] five let's look at that
[1:20:17] must be a good reason to be in here
[1:20:18] first first Thessalonians
[1:20:22] um chapter five
[1:20:26] uh we got here
[1:20:30] uh
[1:20:32] first Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse
[1:20:34] 14.
[1:20:36] now we exhort your brethren warn them
[1:20:39] that are unruly
[1:20:40] in other words acting you know
[1:20:43] why they shouldn't Comfort the
[1:20:45] feeble-minded support the weak be
[1:20:47] patient towards all men
[1:20:49] that's that's the order of things of how
[1:20:52] we can help people you see
[1:20:54] uh
[1:20:55] I'm sure you're familiar with alums of
[1:20:58] Bible it's another translation which is
[1:20:59] very similar to ours Brethren knew the
[1:21:01] man he says now beseech you my brother
[1:21:04] and correct those who offend now this is
[1:21:06] this is from first Thessalonians 5 14. I
[1:21:10] beseech you my brother correct those who
[1:21:12] offend comfort those who lack knowledge
[1:21:14] I'm sorry correct those who lack courage
[1:21:17] bear the burdens of the weak and be
[1:21:20] patient towards all men
[1:21:22] so thus we fulfill the law of Christ as
[1:21:25] spoken by our master in in Matthew 5 44.
[1:21:28] love your enemies bless them that curse
[1:21:32] you
[1:21:33] so do give to them they hate you pray
[1:21:35] for them which despitefully use and
[1:21:38] persecute you now that sounds impossible
[1:21:40] but those are that's Jesus commands it's
[1:21:43] not just you know bless those that take
[1:21:46] you out to supper bless those that you
[1:21:48] know buy you something no you got to be
[1:21:50] nice to everybody see we don't know we
[1:21:53] don't know who the elect are
[1:21:54] we don't know who the enemy are we kind
[1:21:57] of okay looks like it might be them but
[1:21:59] you gotta be nice to everybody until
[1:22:01] they just cut you off entirely you know
[1:22:04] and the devil doesn't know who the good
[1:22:05] people and bad people are so he just
[1:22:07] smacks everybody you know yeah so the
[1:22:10] law of laodicea is hold a grudge
[1:22:13] wait to get even never show any weakness
[1:22:16] that's laodicea but that's contrary love
[1:22:19] your enemies bless them that do good
[1:22:21] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:22:24] them that hate you
[1:22:26] pray for them which despitefully used
[1:22:28] you and persecute you and if you read
[1:22:30] any church history you'll see how that
[1:22:32] the Saints of the past that's what they
[1:22:34] did they went the extra mile they they
[1:22:37] suffered
[1:22:38] so
[1:22:40] uh we don't want to be part of laodicea
[1:22:42] no
[1:22:43] so verse 3 of chapter six
[1:22:46] if a man thinks himself to be something
[1:22:48] when he is nothing he deceives himself
[1:22:52] now we've seen some of those people you
[1:22:54] know we call them one abuse you know you
[1:22:57] know some of them just be yourself
[1:23:00] I mean if you can't do nothing else but
[1:23:02] but just straighten up the chairs or run
[1:23:04] the vacuum just do something
[1:23:08] I don't know how to build a place but I
[1:23:09] know how to you know keep clean you know
[1:23:12] so
[1:23:13] um because you see others can see right
[1:23:16] through you they know when you're a
[1:23:18] wannabe they know when you're a fake
[1:23:20] and small children especially can see
[1:23:22] through you you can't lie to those
[1:23:24] little kids they can see through you
[1:23:28] yeah
[1:23:29] yeah okay verse 4. but let every man
[1:23:33] prove his own work and then shall he
[1:23:36] have rejoicing in himself alone
[1:23:38] and not in another for every man shall
[1:23:41] bear his own burden so we should not
[1:23:43] compare ourselves to others we we use
[1:23:46] the measuring stick of the word am I
[1:23:49] Measuring Up am I level with the word
[1:23:50] you see not with a b and c because each
[1:23:54] one of them will give account to God by
[1:23:56] themselves
[1:23:57] they will give account to God you do as
[1:23:59] God leads you and he will bless you
[1:24:02] because when we get there now why didn't
[1:24:04] you do this John well because you know
[1:24:06] this and that sorry
[1:24:09] I showed you to do this you should have
[1:24:10] done that you know
[1:24:12] yeah
[1:24:13] and he will bless you okay verse six let
[1:24:16] him that is taught in the word
[1:24:17] communicate unto him that teacheth in
[1:24:19] all good things so we got to be positive
[1:24:21] never competitive never looking down on
[1:24:24] anybody just be positive say good things
[1:24:26] about one another
[1:24:28] nice beard you got brother you know
[1:24:32] nice haircuts you got
[1:24:35] verse 7 be not deceived God is Not
[1:24:38] mocked for whosoever whatsoever of man
[1:24:40] soweth that shall he also reap
[1:24:44] for he that soweth through his flesh of
[1:24:46] the flesh reap corruption he that soweth
[1:24:48] it to the spirit shall of the spirit
[1:24:50] reap life Everlasting
[1:24:52] okay
[1:24:53] and let us not be weary well doing for
[1:24:56] in due season we shall reap if we faint
[1:24:58] not
[1:24:59] verse 10 as we have therefore
[1:25:02] opportunity let us do good unto all men
[1:25:04] especially unto them that are of the
[1:25:07] household of faith so first we get
[1:25:10] things done here then we can help those
[1:25:12] people overseas you got to be sure
[1:25:13] everything's done correctly here you
[1:25:15] know verse 14.
[1:25:18] but God forbid that I should Glory save
[1:25:20] in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:25:23] whom the world
[1:25:25] uh by whom the world is crucified unto
[1:25:27] me and I unto the world so we Glory only
[1:25:31] in the cross not in anything else
[1:25:34] anywhere we glory in the cross
[1:25:37] Verse 18 Brethren the grace of the Lord
[1:25:39] Jesus Christ be with you with your
[1:25:41] spirit amen so that is our brief
[1:25:45] uh run through of the book of Galatians
[1:25:48] and if you read it carefully you will
[1:25:50] probably get more out of it but um
[1:25:53] there's only so much person can take in
[1:25:55] one sitting you know
[1:25:57] you don't eat so much chicken so if you
[1:25:59] don't take so much word at one time
[1:26:01] so may God bless you and we'll see you
[1:26:04] again soon
[1:26:12] together
[1:26:18] wow that was the speed through the book
[1:26:22] of Galatians wasn't it
[1:26:24] but really really good really good thank
[1:26:27] you
[1:26:28] praise the lord we heard some more about
[1:26:31] Abraham and about faith and I do believe
[1:26:34] the Lord
[1:26:36] is
[1:26:39] is calling our faith to rise higher in
[1:26:43] our church
[1:26:44] and I believe it's because he wants to
[1:26:46] do more
[1:26:48] that we have to believe more
[1:26:50] there's a requirement first
[1:26:52] and um
[1:26:56] we have to keep our eyes
[1:26:59] on the word
[1:27:01] on Christ and get get them basically off
[1:27:04] of one another
[1:27:05] or off our problems
[1:27:07] are off our difficulties or even the
[1:27:11] very thought of I can't believe I'm
[1:27:13] having a hard time believing
[1:27:15] um
[1:27:16] our Brotherhood instructed us today that
[1:27:19] we need to spend
[1:27:21] more time in prayer more time in the
[1:27:24] word
[1:27:25] so that Christ can become more real to
[1:27:28] us
[1:27:30] because ultimately
[1:27:33] uh we've got to we've got to put on
[1:27:35] Christ we've got to Manifest this this
[1:27:37] love for one another this burden for one
[1:27:40] another this being Christ to one another
[1:27:43] and put off the old man
[1:27:46] um and so may today we take heed to the
[1:27:50] things that we heard the what our
[1:27:52] brother brought to our attention to our
[1:27:54] memory may we just be stirred
[1:27:57] to to put on Christ and to want to be
[1:28:00] our very best for him not you know
[1:28:03] sometimes we go to somebody's house and
[1:28:06] we want to we want to just we want to be
[1:28:08] respectful and and be our best uh
[1:28:11] behavior when we're in their house
[1:28:15] um but it's it's yes this is God's house
[1:28:18] but
[1:28:20] we just want to be on our best for Jesus
[1:28:22] no matter where we're at what we're
[1:28:25] doing and
[1:28:27] um what a a blessed people we are to be
[1:28:30] in the truth and to better come to a
[1:28:33] place and and hear the word of God and
[1:28:35] her brother mentioned over and over and
[1:28:37] over it's it the word is our absolute
[1:28:41] the word the word the word and and
[1:28:45] um
[1:28:46] and and many are fighting over over what
[1:28:50] brother Branham said
[1:28:52] and if we just get the revelation of the
[1:28:54] word our life will manifest what he
[1:28:57] really said
[1:28:58] and we don't have to prove anything our
[1:29:01] life will do it and
[1:29:03] um the very the very fact that you can
[1:29:07] love like Christ
[1:29:09] late on your life like Christ to serve
[1:29:13] like Christ
[1:29:15] that what greater manifestation do we
[1:29:18] need
[1:29:20] and you don't have enough to be a
[1:29:22] theologian for that you just the love of
[1:29:25] Christ shed abroad in a heart you know
[1:29:27] amen so we really appreciated that word
[1:29:31] let's let's sing
[1:29:33] to be like Jesus I know that's our
[1:29:36] desire today to be like Jesus
