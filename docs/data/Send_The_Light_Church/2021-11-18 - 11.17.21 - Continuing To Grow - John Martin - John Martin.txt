let's look to the lord in prayer as we get into the word our gracious heavenly father we come to you very needy we're human beings lord that have weaknesses and faults and there's so many things lord that could that really hinder us lord and we're asking that you would just remove all the humanity out of the way today lord that that you could come and just be the be the one that's living in our tabernacles through the service lord be the hearer of our ears the receiver of our hearts be the speaker of our lips and lord be preeminent amongst us to pray lord if there is any thing that could hinder us from receiving from you i pray that you would forgive us of any unbelief that you would cleanse it from this from the sanctuary lord lord take control of every spirit all our thoughts and our minds and give us the mind of christ tonight lord we have uh separated ourselves unto you for the service today and we pray now that you come and feed us from the bread of life you you said where the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together and lord today we have gathered around your word and we just pray that it would just be fresh and opened up to each one of us that we may eat from the bread of life to tonight and be be strength and be directed and lord will be ever grateful for this grace today we pray that you bless the reading of the word now as we look further into it and meet every need that would be amongst us for your god that is able to do exceely above all that we would ask or even think for that word declares it and we're believers in your word amen lord we pray that you be with those that are not here that are live streaming we just pray that your presence lord will be in their midst and that lord you would reveal yourself to them and in the way that they need you tonight we thank you for these things and all things now for we pray them in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you turn with me for kind of a lengthy scripture reading in second peter chapter one second peter chapter one uh so good to see our sister linda with us tonight it's uh been a few services and i just say we have missed you amen amen well tonight we want to talk about continuing to grow and if we could just do everything that we could to just try to relax um through this message and get the importance that we're all in a spot today that we can grow and and that's what's so wonderful about growing in the lord we don't get ever to a place that we feel comfortable in fact the closer we get to the lord the more we see we need the lord so just try to relax as we go through these these scriptures we want to read them very quick and have you be seated simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue notice where the the calling is to whereby are given unto us exceeding great precious promises that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge to knowledge temperance to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see it far off and it's forgotten that he was purged from his own sins excuse me you know it just happens you know as you are getting ready to come up here is we're for the rather brother give diligence there it is again to make your calling and your election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth yeah i think it means as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly i must put off my tabernacle this my tabernacle even as the lord jesus christ have shown me god bless you may be seated i just want to read the the last verse verse 15 moreover i will endeavor that ye may be able moreover i will endeavor that you may be able after my depar after my decease to have these things always in remembrance wow peter was wanting us to remember peter was an ignorant and unlearned disciple but he believed in continuing to grow his relationship with god he was compelled by the holy ghost inside of him to remind other believers always to keep building your character and under no circumstances are we allowed to float by in our christian walk without the mindset of building our personal character this is a very strong statement because we're often tempted as long as this as long as that i'm good but the mindset needs to be we need to keep adding to what we already are now it doesn't matter how long we've been a christian how long we've been in the message or how far along we think we are peter said in verse 12 wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth now why would there be such a need to tell someone who already knows who's already heard who's already established in the message of the hour about continuing to build god's divine nature why because it's the human tendency to close by in our christian walk without thinking about adding more of god's nature to us because we think i'm saved i'm in the message i'm bright as if there's a settlement there and we're forgetting what this christian walk is really about it's about becoming in his image amen and so a stirring is needed a constant reminding of one another look at this was such a concern on on peter's on peter's heart i'm not going to be i'm i may forget a lot of things i may not do a lot of things but i am not going to be negligent about stirring you up about reminding you about how important it is that you go through the course of the day and you're thinking about adding the nature of god to your life and i'm so concerned about this that even when i'm not here and i shouldn't be worried about anything i'm concerned that it stays in your mind so it's an important issue to peter this burden for the saints to keep adding god's divine nature on a regular basis it was it was so strong on peter being established in the present truth has no bearing on being established in the present truth has no bearing on the reminding so i want to make that statement so it doesn't matter how established you are how much you're in the message how much of the message you know you still need to be reminded and you know it's not by the preacher if i could say this i believe it was the holy ghost in peter that was directing it to rem to remind the saints how many times have we sat in church we heard something oh yeah i've already heard it i know it i've heard that so many times yeah yeah love yeah yeah and it just kind of like water off of a duck's back because it's a it's a head knowledge and it's not a nature so the manifestation of really being established is the evidence of truly believing the manifestation of really being established is the evidence that we truly believe second chronicles 20 20. i just want to spend a couple minutes on believing and getting established and prospering because this is all part of growing in christ ii chronicles 20 20 says believe in the lord your god so shall you be established believe in his prophets so shall you prosper now there's a lot of private interpretations of what it means to really believe but this word believe means that you trust and that you are certain that you are firm that you are faithful that you are steadfast and that you are permanent because a lot of people say they believe that they are not established they're not steadfast they're not permanent they're not faithful they're not firm they're not certain but they they're still in the message still go to church still say they believe but the real proof of believing is when you become established because the scripture says but if you believe on the lord your god so shall ye be established it ain't for some christians it's for everyone that believes amen in other words when you hear the truth and you confirm that you believe it or you say amen what should happen is our lives should change it's that simple to truly believe means that the word becomes steadfast in our life now it becomes a a permanent fixture we become faithful to live it this belief is not like the devils believe because the devils believe in the lord our god right come on when the devils believe they never become established in christ their belief never helps them with their relationship with christ their belief is only a knowledge of the truth they don't ever become faithful to the word they hear that's why christians can sit in church hear the word of god or believers hear the word of god and they never change because they're believing like the devil believes we need to become steadfast and a fixture permanent to the word that we're hearing today and that's why everything that this depends on your heart to god to say god i'm really here because i want what's being spoken amen that's right now that i'm here because it's church night and i got to get to church when we truly believe it's not something that we just agree with that it's the truth but it's something that actually becomes added to our life i wish now brother branham said the holy ghost says amen to every word of god but but that doesn't mean the devil don't say amen and i love brother bruce so much because he's such an amen amen a word amen and brother ben said the holy ghost will say amen to every word of god so it has to happen but that doesn't mean the devil don't say amen remember those uh those people that followed uh paul and said these be of the most high god they were saying amen to the word but it wasn't the right spirit did not the devil tell eve amen yeah god said that but what about this see so the amen is not good enough what is really needed is the manifestation of the word that we hear now there was a time in my life that i had long here and i i do you remember me having long hair brother bruce i don't know if it would have been close to that time but i my wife remembers me having long hair because but she just remembers me at that time that i had long hair and when i went to church and i heard the gospel preached about it and i said amen so be it but if i never manifested it what i truly say what i truly believe it so i can sit in church and i can say amen yeah a man should not have long hair because that's what the what the bible says but if i left my hair long would i really believe it no therefore i cannot become established in that scripture and that's why we need to keep adding it's not because we're not believers and we don't believe in jesus here it's there's so many things in our life there's so many things in god's divine nature he wants to see inside of us and and we've got to receive the word notice when the devil believes he has no interest in adding god's divine nature to himself and that's because it takes a crucified life to actually add god's divine nature because everything that god wants you to do in here i'm telling you it ain't for your flesh it ain't going to make you feel good if it does you've got a misunderstanding of what he's really wanting you to do the devils have no interest in crucifying their will in fact they're out there to stop you from doing god's will but yet they believe and this is what's scary about it says you want us to relax and understand what it really takes to believe the word of god with this in mind we can better see why peter was always reminding the saints that we need to keep adding the divine nature not the knowledge not the head knowledge right but the actual life the actual life to us as individuals now we believe in a god that can take our our nature no matter how corrupt it is how bad it is and literally change it he's the only one that can do it man has never been able to do that by himself might be certain things in a person's life that he can correct or overcome but when it comes to that desire to do your own will only god can change that peter knew that the devil would always be trying to give the believers the same knowledge of god but without a revelation he loves for us just to soak in the knowledge in fact if the devil can get you the knowledge before god can give you the revelation don't you think he's going to go for it we know so you know we've heard this that there's you know certain people churches certain they know the bible so well but you don't see the life the devil don't care how many seminaries there are you don't care how many bible universities there are you don't care about how many bible studies there are knowledge doesn't bother him amen brother brahm taught us that eve lusted for knowledge and you know what satan gave it to her the thing that she wanted satan gave it to her so we can sit here and want the knowledge of god without wanting to please god with that knowledge it's just the enemy you're opening the door to the enemy to come in if you receive knowledge from the wrong source which is the wrong spirit it will not bring forth life inside of you it's not true knowledge of the truth that sets us free it's the spirit of truth that sets man free and what does it set him free from from himself peter was wanting to make sure that the saints weren't just adding head knowledge but that they were adding to god's divine nature or adding god's divine nature to their lives one step at a time one after the other make sure you understand that your calling and your election is about god's divine nature that's what we've been called to that's what our election is we've been called to be in this image it's christ in you the hope of glory and not just a knowledge of god's word believe in the lord your god so shall ye be established so shall you be firm faithful steadfast and permanent believe in his prophets so shall he prosper someone that is not faithful and steadfast is someone who's just believing from the head it's a head knowledge but when you believe from the heart in other words it's a love relationship now god will establish you now all of us are established to appoint all of us are believers to a point all of us have god's nature to a point and eight we say amen to that to every one of us but we're talking about what's lacking and when we come to church the word is preached to us and that word kind of sees where we're at in the balance right and so we're not we're not wanting to to to to get uh to uh to get re-baptized if you've been baptized we're not wanting to to to cut your hair if you already got the revelation but if i if i see it start to grow up grow out again [Laughter] you understand god is dealing with us where we're not right because he's calling us higher and so when we hear the word we shouldn't be offended or being hurt or bothered because god is just trying to add to our lives a double minded person will always be unstable because as a man thinketh so is he it's important that we make up our minds on things quickly now i know there's certain things that god has yet to show us but too often our life becomes wishy-washy we need to make a decision and we need to stick with it tell you if we want to get our lives more established we need to practice these little things it could start when you go to the restaurant and you're trying to decide what you're going to eat what are we going to eat tonight honey well i don't know i kind of want this but what do you hey let's just ask the waitress what do you think i should have yes as if they know your feelings and emotions but how many times have we done that tell me what's the best we have to practice being single-minded and and take a stand this is it this is where i'm at and walk forward now not with such a bullheaded that god can't speak to us if we're wrong but when we you know pretty soon the devil is just gonna you're never gonna become established and if you don't become established how are you going to blossom so i want to push a little bit further in this believe in the lord your god so shall you be established believe in his prophets so shall ye prosper now when we believe in those who god has sent to us the same way that we believe god's word god will reward the believer with prosperity now that's your scripture god will honor those that he sends god honors those that he sends to you if we don't believe that then we don't believe that god is in us helping anybody jesus said as you've done to the least of these my little ones you've done unto me he also said whosoever shall give give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward in the name of a disciple wasn't even in the name of jesus but jesus is standing behind that disciple and when god tells you to do something no matter how great or how small it might be do it when brother bram tells the story that he he could go get up in the morning and and go preach to to thousands and god told me i just want you to go over to your neighbors and start chopping wood for her and give her some wood it was the will of god and god was behind it now but what about when god sends us a matthew chapter 10 verse 41 if you want to write it down matthew chapter 10 verse 41 he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward you get the same reward as the prophet gets just to receive them amen that is amazing doesn't seem fair the prophet does all the work gets all the criticism and yet by just believing the message that god gave him to us we get the same reward that the prophet gets i don't know if i'll have time to get back to this but i want you to think when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time and he was you could tell that he was not all there because he said is these all branhams so he wasn't fully seen what actually was happening to him and these were his converts you talk about that that song look around look at your reward the reward were the souls that came in through his ministry and they received the same reward he did eternal life god don't send a prophet with well you could take it or leave it and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward now what kind of reward would you like verse 40 he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me so here jesus is sending us his disciples out two by two or go ye out into all the world jesus was sending them and if they receive you they're actually receiving god his father are you with me we're talking about what it means to believe the prophets is to actually receive the word that they spoke now god uses his body to get the message over to other members of the body right that's how you and i came in matthew or malachi chapter 4 verse 5 if you want to write it down malachi chapter 4 verse 5 this is a a prophecy of a it's actually a twofold prophecy these next two verses but this one here is strictly to our age he says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord now we all the whole world is feeling it's got to be close got to be close so we know that it's prophesied to have a prophet on the scene before the coming of that great and dreadful day of the lord and the next verse verse 6 and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children the heart of the children of the fathers lest they come and smite the earth with a curse now this may seem kind of backwards why would you want to go right back to where you started but this is a twofold prophecy this verse referring to the prophet that came before his first coming as well as the prophet before his second coming so the first coming was the fathers to the children and in our age it's the heart of the children back to the pentecostal apostolic fathers of our faith amen on the day of pentecost that's that's what he has to bring us to that or else or else lest i come and smite the earth with a curse so it's mighty important that our faith is turned back to the apostolic fathers you can you say amen to that now remember when jesus was transfigured before his disciples and peter john was having a supernatural experience but their minds weren't in the spirit because they wanted to build three tabernacles they were having a supernatural experience but their mind wasn't in the spirit think about that didn't have the mind of god they just were so caught up spilled three tabernacles but the lord didn't want three tabernacles let's pick it up in matthew 17 verse 5. we're gonna read about seven eight verses there matthew chapter 17 verse five now while peter was speaking you know god just cut him off god just cut him off right in the middle of his speaking a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased lovely here here's the message hear ye him this is who you got to listen to don't listen to what's in your head i don't care how much you think you've had the supernatural experience and this is you think you should do this because you had this and only it was you and two other brothers i don't care hear ye him stick with the word and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and they were sore afraid they were afraid they didn't have it right this voice from heaven that spoke out of the cloud it was preeminent it was real and jesus came and he touched them and said arise and be not afraid and when they lifted up their eyes they didn't see moses and elijah anymore they saw no man save jesus only if god has his way in our speaking when whoever we're speaking to when we get done people are going to see jesus only they're not going to see a man's reputation they're not good they're not interested in that and god is not interested in giving them that it's jesus only i believe in the jesus only and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until i die and be risen again so you can share this little testimony but wait sometimes we have experiences there's a time to share them and the time not to and his disciples asked him saying why then not notice after this great experience why then and his disabled assassin saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come and they're talking about this this scripture here in malachi and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and what's his job going to be restore all things going to restore that faith back that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't changed he's still as much god today as he ever was through history now when he makes this statement john the baptist was already dead i think it was chapter 4 that he died this is chapter 17. but since malachi was a two-fold prophecy hid in the scriptures jesus said but i say unto you in verse 12 that elias has come already and they have done and they knew it not they knew him not and have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall they also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist but understand john the baptist did not come before that great and dreadful day of the lord another thing is john the baptist did not restore the bible says he didn't do miracles so this is definitely talking of a prophet in this age jesus said that the job of the end time prophet was to restore all things in this late hour that we're living in such confusion in this religious world they need to be restored to the original word the original faith revelations 10 7 speaking of the same messenger same prophet but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he have declared to his servants the prophets now we've all played clue or watch shows or you put three things up here and you put something on it and you go like this and you're trying to we've all wondered at the end of the movie who the real killer was are you with me well we are promised in the bible that at the at the the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound the mystery of god is finished we understand baptism we understand the godhead everything is finished now that's why it's so important to listen to what that messenger sent because that is going to restore our faith amen amen we need it brother branham said rapturing faith lies on those tapes i know i i love it too when a a minister gets up here and he's fiery and telling the stories and you just you're just soaked right into it you know you just feel like you believe so much more when you leave and i like that too but rapturing faith is in the tapes and we need to give respect to the man that god sent because if we receive the message of the prophet we will receive a prophet's reward believe in the lord your god so shall ye be established believe in his prophets so shall ye prosper now that word prosper means to push forward now i want you to think i want you to think of your nature your divine nature of god now prosper means to push forward to break out mightily to be profitable now i'm not talking about money monetary after we plant a bush or a flower and everybody's done this the first step after we've accepted it into the ground is for the plant to become established the first thing has got to happen if it don't become established what does it do it dies it's in the realm but it dies so it has to become established and then when you see it prosper you're seeing it push forward new growth it breaks out with with with mighty flowers that it it's profitable for everybody that comes by and says wow that's a beautiful hydrangea it has to become established and then it begins to grow and we see when we see plants that are like this and they become like this we see what happens out here but did you know growth is taking place under the ground in the roots coming to church god's dealing with you inside you you go through tests and trials and the roots go down deeper and before you know it you're becoming more established it never stops you take an oak tree that's 40 years old i am telling you the roots are much deeper and greater than when it was 20 years old we never stop growing we got to continue to grow continue to be established in new things that god shows us new things god wants us to do and then we need once we become established in every one of them we need to start prospering in every one of them and the prophet taught us how to do that it's no different when we receive the message that god sent through the prophet all sudden our spiritual life prospers as if it never could have never could he's he he's opened up certain things that i've never ever seen in the scriptures when i read because the word prophet he's a seer he sees and he comes and he gives us what god gave him the devil has got too many people stuck on god sent a prophet and have missed believing the message focus on the belt buckles and the hats and the the the mysteries and and i'm in the message and have missed the actual message the brand preached the message running without the message something like that how'd that go amen no no running without a message so sorry i just know that scriptures we can run run i'm in i'm in the message but not have the message we got to get into the message it's not good enough to say i'm in the message i'm stirring up your mind hey man it's just stirring it up that's why there are so many people tossed about so many double-minded unstable they're ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth which is the full discernment that's what this message brings you it brings us the full discernment of the word turn with me back to first peter chapter one are you are you staying with me i haven't lost anybody have i simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith so he's speaking to us like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace just multiply it get the calculator out be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord now we're going to talk a little bit about knowledge in in a little bit but through proper knowledge through the knowledge of god not the not uh the knowledge of god through a wrong source but grace and peace is multiplied when you get the knowledge strictly from the holy ghost according as his divine power have given unto unto each one of us all things whatever we never need him that pertaineth unto his life and his godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue i just love the scriptures peter wants us to give diligence and to make our calling an election a sure thing so he's saying to give diligence and this calling is the divine nature according as his divine nature has given us all things i'll tell you i don't know the hill beans most of the time and it's never bothered me i ain't got much of a reputation and that is it just doesn't bother me i make a lot of mistakes i don't mean it wrong but it doesn't bother me i don't want to wake up and be without his divine nature inside of me i won't better handle anything amen that's what i need is his divine nature in me i don't need to know anything else to save jesus christ and him crucified amen whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises we've got the word of god now that by these promises we can partake of the divine nature of god having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now how we get more of the divine nature of god is when we take when we read the bible and the bible says i can do all things through christ that strengthens me and i say amen to that and all of a sudden i can do things that i never thought i could do i could handle things that i thought i could never handle before and i don't need to google i don't need to call the pastor i got a hold of god his divine nature he don't need help we don't attain god's nature through human efforts when we have tried that all of us have we have miserably failed we attain his divine nature through faith in the promises of god it's when we decide we really believe it not with the head knowledge but believe it now here's i just want to say this we can't muster up faith all we can do is die out cry out let god know that i want the faith that you have delivered to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints it's a battle and and paul said fight the good fight of faith lay hold of eternal life it's a battle it's not faith is not a gift in the aspect that you know you're you're born and you can you can really really play the guitar it's not that kind of way or you can sing or you can faith is a gift but when we're trying to grow our spiritual life is not handed to us and you've got to fight for it you can't just defeat the devil with knowledge he'll whip you every time now if god said i can do all things through christ or that word strength means virtue of god then i believe it so we start out with faith i'm just going to read that real quick and besides this verse 5 giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and knowledge temperance temperance patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity now i don't have it and sister amanda uh got the thing laminated for me and i don't know i thought about it eight times uh before today's service the last few days to get this back up we used to have it in the other church and it's like a little pyramid and at the bottom of this pyramid it starts out the foundation is faith now you cannot build god's divine nature on anything but faith it has to be the foundation of it you can't learn your way into god's nature you can't you can't force yourself you can't do works it it all starts with faith that you believe that you are part of god that you believe that that you are a seed of god that you are a child of god that that all that god is you are it starts with faith and if god said i can do all things through strength his strength or his virtue then all's we have to do is believe it so you add to your faith virtue virtue is strength i'll tell you we all want more strength in our life right and inner strength not muscles but an inner strength that we could just you know tell the devil to leave and have have we know how to get rid of them that that strength we all want strength that but that strength will not come without first you have to believe that you can do all things through christ now you see what i'm saying it's through the promises of god that we get the divine nature if the word says grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord then now you have strength to do it because you need strength in order to grow because you're going to have trials and you're going to deal with a lot of stuff you see how it's building off of the other if the word tells me to add self-control temperance tempers that means self-control you look it up if the word tells me to add self-control to my strength i have uh i have the the strength to do that now just please forgive me please forgive me add to your faith virtue and to your strength knowledge and to knowledge temperance self control and you you have self-control now now you can learn how to exercise patience because a lot of times we want patience but we have we want it now and temperance gives us the self-control to be more patient to let patients have its wonderful work amen it's work inside of us and then when we've got patience then we can we can add godliness to it that's a little ways down the road but now that godliness what that is is respect and reverence to god that's what that is if you look that up because you need to be patient and let god have his way in your life you need to respect what he's doing you need to respect the test and the trials he's put in your life you need to respect god god knows what he's doing you don't see the three hebrew children you know lashing out against god they committed themselves to god you don't see daniel just say quit i'm closing the doors i'm gonna pray quietly silently it's between me and god anyways nobody else needs to know about it he knew what he was getting himself into but he committed himself to god a lot of times we can't commit ourselves to god we're still in control but but you need that self-control and that patience to to respect god enough to let him have his way that's that godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness well now i'm going to tell you brotherly kindness most of us look at brotherly kindness is is i'm going to do something kind for my brother and uh and and then there's times that i'm thinking you know what i'm not gonna do that anymore to that brother and we think it's okay because of what they did to us but can you imagine god being that kind of kind to you so brotherly kindness is to all and to be honest if you can't do that you can't love god you can't put charity on john said if you can't love your brother who you have see how can you love god who you haven't seen so you've got to put loving your brothers to a manifestation before you claim you got the love of god because the love of god will lay down his life for the brother i think it's first john chapter 3 verse 16 says he lay down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren when he's living in you he's going to do the same thing hereby perceive we the love of god because he lay down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren oh i've heard this story when the certain the apostles found out that peter they were going to take peter and they were going to crucify him and they told him to leave remember just like they did with paul but paul said what do you mean to break my heart i'm not only willing to go to jerusalem i'm willing to die there for him but peter when he received word he he goes and he escapes to jerusalem he he runs out of jerusalem and god meets him there jesus meets them there and when peter sees jesus jesus peter asked jesus what are you doing here what are you doing here and jesus said i've come to be crucified again and at that moment peter turned around and walked right back into jerusalem to be crucified and when he was crucified he was he wasn't film worthy to be crucified the same way so he was hung upside down but the point that i'm trying to say christ in you will lay down your life for the brethren no matter what the crucifixion is and i'm i'm thankful that we don't go to really die as it were physically but we have to die to ourself and our will every day to see somebody come to christ and that's what christ is in you for today it's to give the word to the rest of the body we need our life capped off with the love of god but we need to learn to build build to the divine nature that we have i want to just talk a moment about knowledge because the bible says that one of the things that we're supposed to add to our nature our divine nature our character is knowledge and you add it to your strength i want to talk about knowledge for a moment i want to say that not all the knowledge of god is good and i know this is a strong statement but not all knowledge of god is good any knowledge that is mixed with unbelief question or doubt is not good the bible tells us that knowledge puffeth up and i'm sure peter was not wanting us to add puff up and i'm sure a knowledge that puffs us up is not god's nature he dwells with the humble so even though it's the knowledge of god we can get so puffed up with it i wonder why because we did not receive that knowledge at that moment from the right source remember back in the garden there were two trees one was the tree of life and the other was the tree of knowledge of good and evil bold trees had as much knowledge about god i mean lucifer dwelt with god he was the right hand man of god he had the knowledge of god so when we're thinking about adding knowledge it's not about sitting and just because satan has a lot of ddlds that come out of seminaries that know the word backwards and front words and satan knows the word backwards in front ones how do i know that because when you sin he reminds you he hits you over the head he tells you you're no good you're just a hypocrite he knows the word and we can know the word we can have the knowledge of the word and not build anything with our divine nature here's the thing when you believe you become established when you receive the knowledge of god it ought to produce life if not it's just puffing you up and you just got to tell everybody about it it's too it's the same word coming from two different sources the tree of knowledge of good but it doesn't stay good it's a mixed tree because there's doubt there's questions there's you don't have to do it you don't have to be faithful it doesn't matter you're still christian jesus is your personal savior but when god speaks to you true knowledge there's growth that takes place it adds to your life it's not a head knowledge it's a heart knowledge i want to please you lord i want my life to represent you more the next time i go through this same trial i want to make a different decision for you that's what the knowledge of god would do for us through the source of the spirit of life the spirit of life there's the spirit of truth how many loves the truth let me say how many loves the truth harmony loves the truth when it hurts come on come on how many loves the truth when it corrects see you don't say oh lord i love this but we don't write but we don't have a problem saying i love the truth set me free now when god speaks the truth he never that source his intent his motive is never to hurt never to hurt that's why we should never ever speak the truth without love because when the holy ghost speaks the truth it's in love it's in love because god is love and god is the spirit of truth and he said as many as i love i rebuke and chase him that love will correct us but understand the devil has the capability of using every one of our vessels at any given time he wants to if we yield it to him and try to speak the truth to somebody with the wrong spirit and feel religiously right and that's what's bad about the knowledge of god with the wrong spirit so understand when we're thinking about adding knowledge to our nature don't study the bible naturally study the bible lord how can i better please you it's a relationship when you listen to a tape lord i want out of this tape with something i don't have in my life not something i agree with not something i want but our motive is to get what we don't have which is the rest of god's divine nature and we need to keep stirring that in our lives help one another remind one another we're not discouraging one another but we're trying to get one another to get ready for the wedding i'll tell you something about this wedding you know you go to you go to college excuse me first thing you know you go to college you go to class and the teacher teaches the whole class this is what this is we're going to start in this chapter we're going to go to this chapter and then we're going to have an essay at the end and then we're going to have an exam and we're going to find out who wins or who who gets an a and you can sit there as long as everybody else sits in class and you can just go this is so this is so dumb and see if that helps you or you can go home and and and and read again and meditate look at your notes of the things that were spoken to you now here's the thing the rapture day is already set no man knows the day or the hour but it's already set god is not waiting on any single person why because he's no respecter persons and when the time has come that the last one has come in the last one is saved things are going to start happening so i say to you that are really interested in building god's divine nature stir up your minds about this don't wait for it to be preached to you this is a message that peter gave it's the same message for us we're the ones that hold whether that divine nature is going to happen quickly or slowly depends how much we want to die out brother jonathan was bringing out a good point in our men's meeting about when we really really want to display the love of god the key is to die out to ourselves because in all honesty if we're not in the way we're not wanting to build another tabernacle hey what about me my name is john martin what about my tabernacle i want to put my tabernacle you know with jesus's tabernacle that's the problem that we have how about jesus only in my life it's up to us to die out more the more we get to know how ugly our nature is the more that we realize that we are a greatest enemy the more we're like i i really want to get more serious with having god in my life stir stir your minds make it your prayer amen let's finish this reading then we're going to have a word of prayer and for if these things be in you verse 8 and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of the lord jesus christ when i looked up that word knowledge you'll see there's two one talks about science right and the other talks about the full discernment and when god shows you something it'll bring forth life you'll see the picture real clear when the devil tells you something it just brings more confusion to your mind it just does but he that lacketh these things he that lacks this nature these steps is blind he's just kind of going to church he really hasn't had a vision he can't see very far of what he's supposed to become before jesus returns and has forgotten how bad he really was that he that he was purged from his own sins so he says but wherefore the rather instead of being like that rather give diligence to make your calling and your election to this divine nature a sure thing amen don't try to worry about your other things that you feel to do when this is really the priority well there was no amen so what i'm going to do is say amen brother john for if you do these things ye shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and our savior jesus christ now i want to say i do believe with all my heart that god has ministered abundantly how to have god's divine nature amen we may not preach a prosperity message here we may not be preaching how you can get this that and the other but i believe that we have been ministered what it takes to have the divine nature of jesus christ abundantly wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth yeah i must i think it meet as long as i'm in this tabitha you know what i'm just going to keep doing the same thing i'm going to stir you up how am i going to do it i'm going to put you in remembrance and you're going to say i already know and i'm going to say but are you already living it's not what we know it's what we're manifesting knowing that i short that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as the lord jesus christ have shown me noticed notice god showed peter god showed paul and i'll tell you god needs to show every one of us we need to put off this tabernacle we need to put on the lord jesus christ moreover i will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance i just want to say after we leave here i want these things to always be in your remembrance amen god bless you let's stand together praise the lord how many wants this divine nature amen it's something that we can be working on daily one in seeking the lord one in prayer one calling on god one reading one praying one listening to tapes but you know what then you're put into action to see if that divine nature is going to come out because you will have to yield to god in order for it to happen because it don't happen on its own this flesh is kind of in the way it don't want to lay down its life don't want to die out amen let's look to him in prayer dear father we thank you for this precious word we thank you for stirring our minds our thoughts for showing us that there's more of you to have living inside of us lord we don't know when that that end is that limit is but we know there's something inside of us that just wants to keep pushing out keep magnifying the name of the lord with our life how we live decisions we make and how we act and how we handle things and god is in every one of our hearts here today to do this i pray that you would equip this lord with a greater portion of your spirit lord that you bring these things to our remembrance in the days to come that you'd help us to to be mindful that where we're at lord there's still more for us you know how we can get so busy lord get so so caught up as it were in the cares of this life and taking care of business and things family in the home god remind us lord we give you liberty we give you preeminence remind us lord that we need to be focusing on adding and adding and adding that we may spiritually grow spiritually prosper lord we're we also want to say thank you to you for establishing our lives yes for being in our lives for helping us to be where we're at today for certainly lord if it not been for you we would be so out in the world lost and doing the things of the world and not even caring about a god but it was you that came and got our attention one day when we all had our conversation in the things of the world in the nature of selfishness lord you let us know that there is a different nature a nature that can live for others and not have to get anything out of it to love for others and not get anything out of it and lord we just thank you for revealing yourself to us we thank you for where we're at today and lord we thank you for pointing us where you want us to be the direction you want us to go by your grace lord we're forgetting those things which are behind i'll pray for every heart here lord there's someone here
