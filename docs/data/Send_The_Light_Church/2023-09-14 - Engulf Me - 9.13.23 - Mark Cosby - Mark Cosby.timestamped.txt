[38:11] having a heart sprinkled from an evil
[38:13] conscience and our bodies washed with
[38:16] pure water
[38:17] let us hold fast the profession of our
[38:20] faith without wavering for he is
[38:23] faithful that promise and that is
[38:25] considered one another to provoke unto
[38:28] love and to Good Works
[38:31] not forsaking the assembling of
[38:33] ourselves together as a manner of some
[38:35] is but exhorting one another and so much
[38:37] to more as you see the day approaching
[38:39] you may be seated
[38:42] so the little title of this uh sermon is
[38:44] engulf me
[38:46] so something we want the Lord to be able
[38:47] to do is engulf our life we can get
[38:49] engulfed in so other things so many
[38:51] other things but the main thing we need
[38:53] to be engulfed in is the Lord and so
[38:56] let's go to verse verse 20. so it says
[38:59] by a newly Living Way which he hath
[39:01] consecrated so I looked the word up
[39:03] consecrated means separated for a common
[39:06] to Sacred use devoted or dedicated to
[39:10] the service and worship of God so you
[39:12] have to dedicate and devote yourself to
[39:16] God every day because his mercies are
[39:18] new each day each day is a brand new day
[39:20] you can't write the coattails of
[39:22] yesterday or last week but you got to
[39:24] dedicate and as soon as you get up in
[39:25] the morning you got to dedicate yourself
[39:27] because it the Devils this is real is
[39:30] God and he wants to come and Sidetrack
[39:32] you he wants to come and stop you
[39:34] destroy you any way he can and so we got
[39:37] to recognize that we have an enemy and
[39:38] we have to fight the enemy the right way
[39:40] which is dedicate yourself to God and so
[39:43] verse 22 it gives you the word Assurance
[39:45] so we'll read that let us draw near with
[39:47] a true heart and full Assurance of Faith
[39:51] so notice that word Assurance means the
[39:53] act of assuring or making a declaration
[39:57] in terms that furnace ground of
[39:59] confidence as I trusted to his
[40:02] insurances or the act of Furnishing any
[40:04] ground of full confidence so you got to
[40:06] have full assurance that God is going to
[40:08] answer that need in your life full
[40:10] assurance that God is who we say he is
[40:13] and so that Assurance has to be coupled
[40:15] with faith it has to be together because
[40:17] you can't have faith if you're wavering
[40:19] so you gotta have full assurance that
[40:21] God is going to move in the exact need
[40:23] that you need him to move in but first
[40:25] just seek him first and then let him
[40:27] fulfill that need
[40:29] and they'll go to verse 23 it says
[40:31] profession so profession is an open
[40:33] declaration a public a vow or
[40:36] acknowledgment of one's sentiments or
[40:38] belief as professions of friendship or
[40:40] sincerity a profession of Faith or
[40:42] religion so you could have profession
[40:44] that Jesus is your high priest so you
[40:48] gotta not just somebody else's high
[40:50] priest but he's your high priest
[40:51] personally and he knows how you feel he
[40:54] knows the thoughts that you go through
[40:55] and you got to believe that with all
[40:57] your heart
[40:58] now look the word up in golf says to
[41:00] flow over and enclose to surround and
[41:04] cover something or someone completely
[41:06] just like a body of water and it
[41:08] surrounds everything and ghosts
[41:10] everything and that's how Jesus needs to
[41:12] be in our life but you have to give him
[41:14] the okay the go-ahead to be able to do
[41:16] that he's a gentleman it's like in
[41:18] Revelations 3 it says he knocks at the
[41:20] door and he's waiting for the believer
[41:22] to let him in and so
[41:25] so in order for something to engulf your
[41:26] life you have to give a permission it
[41:29] could be issues in life problems in life
[41:31] whatever it is but you have to first
[41:34] give it permission to engulf your life
[41:36] so
[41:37] let's go to James chapter 4.
[41:41] amen
[41:42] so you must
[41:44] see in order to something engulf your
[41:46] life you must make it a priority in your
[41:48] thoughts see it all starts in your
[41:50] thoughts whatever you're thinking about
[41:51] the most is going to be what you're
[41:53] going to become so if you're if you have
[41:55] bad thoughts negative thoughts if you
[41:57] keep feeding on those things you're
[41:58] eventually going to slowly start
[42:00] becoming those things
[42:02] so go to James 4 and we'll read chapter
[42:04] verses seven through eight very familiar
[42:07] scriptures
[42:08] so it says submit yourself therefore to
[42:10] God resist the devil and he will flee
[42:12] from you so for having negative thoughts
[42:13] the devil is bombarding us the first
[42:16] thing we need to do is to what does it
[42:18] say submit yourselves therefore to God
[42:21] that's the key that's the math equation
[42:23] you want to say that's the formula if
[42:25] you want to have over if you want to
[42:26] overcome anything the devil's throwing
[42:28] at you you first have to submit yourself
[42:30] therefore to God and then it says resist
[42:33] the devil and he will flee from you so
[42:35] God so the devil has to flee
[42:38] in the presence of God every time we saw
[42:40] when Jesus met with Legion they bowed
[42:43] down and say why do you come to torment
[42:44] me before my time so anytime you get in
[42:48] the presence of God every devil has to
[42:51] Bow before you because it's the god it's
[42:53] God not because it's you but because
[42:55] it's God
[42:55] and so go to verse uh seven or verse 8
[42:58] and it says draw an eye to God and He
[43:01] will draw an eye to you see God has
[43:03] hidden Simplicity he doesn't make it
[43:05] hard but he says if you're really
[43:06] drawing nine to him then he has to draw
[43:08] knights in you because his word declares
[43:10] that and God is not a man that will lie
[43:13] so I think a lot of times we make it so
[43:15] hard but yet God is hid in Simplicity
[43:17] God wants to make it so easy for us but
[43:20] you have to make the choice by three
[43:22] more agency to draw an eye to him and
[43:24] the quicker you can draw an eye to him
[43:26] the quicker you will forget about all
[43:29] those negative thoughts all those
[43:30] problems in your life because you'd be
[43:31] focused on him you got to get in that
[43:33] Channel with him amen so draw an eye to
[43:37] God and He will draw an eye to then it
[43:38] says we have a part to play cleanse your
[43:41] hands you Sinners and purify your hearts
[43:43] ye double-minded so you can't come to
[43:46] God with uh
[43:48] with unbelief without you got to believe
[43:51] that God if God says that right there
[43:53] then he is going to draw an eye to you
[43:55] so we can't have a double mind in
[43:58] anything anything you're asking of God
[43:59] it says in Hebrews 11 you got to believe
[44:02] that who God is and you can't be
[44:04] wavering you got to ask in faith
[44:06] so then we'll go to Romans 6.
[44:09] Romans 6 chapter 6.
[44:11] 6 verse 6. and so the more you seek God
[44:15] the more he has preeminence in your life
[44:17] and the more he has Primus in your life
[44:19] the more he can engulf your life the
[44:22] more you won't be thinking about
[44:23] yourself but you'll be thinking about
[44:25] others and and that's the key what God
[44:28] wants us to think about others because
[44:30] what was the Holy Ghost given for
[44:33] to what
[44:35] anybody
[44:38] all right it was continuing the works
[44:39] that Christ could not do at that time
[44:41] because you and I weren't here and
[44:43] Christ wants to use you to win lost
[44:46] souls to to find the ones whose names
[44:49] are written in the palm of his hands and
[44:51] so we got to be we don't know who those
[44:53] people are so that's why we got to be a
[44:55] servant to everyone Paul said I became
[44:57] all things to all men that I might what
[44:58] win some so Paul knew he wouldn't win
[45:01] everybody but he knew he would win some
[45:04] amen so we'll go to Romans 6 and we'll
[45:07] read verses 6 through 23.
[45:11] amen
[45:14] verse six knowing this that our old man
[45:16] is crucified with him that the body of
[45:19] sin might be destroyed that henceforth
[45:22] we should not serve sin so Jesus Christ
[45:25] gave us a way that we don't have to
[45:27] serve sin anymore we don't have to be
[45:28] bombarded we don't have to be Shackled
[45:30] anymore
[45:32] verse 7 for he that is dead is freed
[45:34] from sin so you can see the importance
[45:37] of crucifying daily verse 9 knowing that
[45:39] Christ being raised from the dead dieth
[45:42] no more death have no more dominion over
[45:45] him you can see why Paul could say death
[45:47] wears out stain grave or is I victory
[45:50] verse 9 knowing that Christ being raised
[45:53] from the dead diet No More Death has no
[45:55] more dominion over him verse 10. friend
[45:58] that he died he died unto sin once but
[46:01] in that he liveth he liveth unto God
[46:03] verse 11. likewise reckon he also
[46:06] yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin
[46:09] but alive unto God through who Jesus
[46:12] Christ Our Lord verse 12 let not sin
[46:15] therefore reign in your moral body that
[46:18] you should obey it in the lust thereof
[46:20] so it has given us so we have a choice
[46:22] every day if we let sin reign in our
[46:26] life in our life so we have to make that
[46:29] choice and the first choice is made we
[46:31] can get up first thing in the morning
[46:34] verse 13 neither yield your members as
[46:37] instruments of unrighteousness so just
[46:40] because you're saved and filled with the
[46:41] Holy Ghost does not mean you can't yield
[46:43] your body to unrighteousness because
[46:45] once again we're still in flesh and we
[46:48] still have uh desires we still have uh
[46:51] goals and all these things that can get
[46:53] in the way of our walk and so we got to
[46:55] be careful who we are yielding our
[46:57] members to our instruments to
[46:59] says but yield yourself unto God as
[47:03] those that are alive from the dead and
[47:05] your members as instruments of
[47:07] righteousness unto God so it's given us
[47:08] a we need to make that choice to yield
[47:10] our vessel to God because then what we
[47:13] yield our vessel to God the more God can
[47:15] move in your life he can direct your
[47:17] path he can give you the overcoming
[47:19] Victory you want I know we all want
[47:21] victory in our life but we got to do it
[47:24] the way that God has set forth and this
[47:26] what he set forth is we have to yield
[47:28] first we have to submit first
[47:30] amen verse 14 for sin shall not have
[47:34] dominion over you so Christ died so sin
[47:37] will not have dominion over you so I
[47:40] said this statement before don't let a
[47:42] defeated creature defeat you I'll say
[47:44] that again don't let it defeated
[47:46] creature defeat you the devil only had
[47:48] you can only give the devil power if you
[47:51] let him have the power that's the only
[47:52] way so don't let don't let a devil who
[47:55] has been defeated his Stinger's been
[47:57] taken out defeat you because amen
[48:01] so it says for you're not under the law
[48:03] but under grace What then shall we say
[48:06] because we are not under the law but
[48:08] under grace God forbid know ye not that
[48:11] to whom ye yield yourselves servants to
[48:14] obey his servants ye are to whom you
[48:17] obey whether of sin unto death
[48:20] or of obedience unto righteousness but
[48:22] verse 17 says but God be think that you
[48:25] were the Servants of sin but you have
[48:27] obeyed from the heart that from the
[48:28] doctrine which was delivered you
[48:31] being then made free from sin you became
[48:33] the Servants of righteousness I speak
[48:35] after the man of a man because of the
[48:38] affirmity of your flesh as you have
[48:40] yielded your members servants Towing
[48:42] cleanliness and to iniquity unto
[48:43] iniquity even to iniquity unto iniquity
[48:46] that's a lot to say even so now yield
[48:48] your members servants to righteousness
[48:50] unto holy so Paul has given us a
[48:52] challenge even so
[48:54] now yield your members servants to
[48:57] righteousness unto Holiness so Paul has
[48:59] given us each one of us that challenge
[49:02] uh to to do that amen
[49:06] verse 20. for when you were a Servants
[49:09] of sin you were free from righteousness
[49:11] what fruit had you then and those things
[49:13] where if you are now ashamed for the end
[49:15] of those things is death but now being
[49:17] made free from sin and become servants
[49:20] to God you have your fruit into Holiness
[49:22] and the unto the end of everlasting
[49:25] for the wages of sin is death but of the
[49:28] gift is eternal life through Christ
[49:29] Jesus our lord
[49:31] so we see just because we're Christians
[49:34] doesn't mean we can't fall in the
[49:35] category so each day we have to make
[49:38] that hard choice of taking the straight
[49:40] and narrow way it's the harder way yes
[49:42] but the harder way will always pay off
[49:45] in life see Satan likes to paint a
[49:47] picture of of fake life but it's really
[49:49] death so don't yield your member to him
[49:52] because the thing is you can yield your
[49:54] member to Satan still because we're
[49:56] still in these fleshly bodies and these
[49:58] fleshly bodies are fickled all these
[50:01] other things that they are so let's go
[50:03] to John chapter 4.
[50:05] first John uh yeah first John Chapter 4
[50:08] verses one through four
[50:10] so
[50:11] we're talking about a men's meeting how
[50:13] many thoughts you know come into our
[50:15] head and I looked it up one time we get
[50:17] thousands of decisions we have to make
[50:19] thousands of thoughts that come into our
[50:21] head and we got to be able to recognize
[50:24] which are from God and which are not
[50:26] from God
[50:27] because the devil likes to come as God
[50:29] as well and we got to be able to
[50:32] identify what voice is speaking to us at
[50:35] that very moment
[50:37] and we'll go to verse chapter one or
[50:39] verse one in uh first John 4. beloved
[50:43] believe not every spirit so it's telling
[50:45] us don't believe every voice that you
[50:47] hear
[50:49] and says but they but try the spirit so
[50:52] it's giving us a challenge but we got to
[50:54] try that thought
[50:57] whether they are of God because many
[50:59] false prophets are gone out into the
[51:01] world
[51:02] hereby know ye the spirit of God every
[51:05] spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ
[51:07] has come in the flesh is of God
[51:09] verse 3 and every spirit that confesses
[51:12] not that Jesus Christ has come in the
[51:14] flesh is not of God and this is that
[51:16] Spirit of antichrist where if you have
[51:18] heard that it should come and even now
[51:20] already it is in the world verse 4 year
[51:23] of God little children and have overcome
[51:25] them because greater is in in he that is
[51:28] in you than he that is in the world Amen
[51:31] amen and so we really got to just take
[51:33] we got to realize that the devil chose
[51:34] the mind and God chose the heart so the
[51:38] devil's job is to get you confused to
[51:40] bombard you to distract you with all
[51:42] kind of thoughts he doesn't it can be a
[51:44] thought from left field but if he gets
[51:46] you just to contemplate and think upon
[51:48] that thought then you start to begin to
[51:50] manifest that thought so it's so
[51:53] important to keep our minds clean
[51:55] because you can't stop the devil from
[51:56] coming but you can stop him from
[51:58] entering in
[52:00] and so in any way he can get us to doubt
[52:02] the word of God that's that's his whole
[52:04] goal is to get you to doubt in one in
[52:06] any kind of fashion whether it's one
[52:08] percent two percent or a half a percent
[52:10] but that's his job and he's really good
[52:12] at it so we have to be in our a game we
[52:14] got to be sober we got to be vigilant
[52:18] so it's
[52:19] so we got to stop letting our problems
[52:22] engulf us because a lot of times we'll
[52:24] let our situation we're in or trial we
[52:27] get into this engulfs us and we started
[52:29] we start to weaken
[52:31] so we can't let the world's condition
[52:33] engulf you we got to realize that this
[52:35] world isn't going to get any better it's
[52:37] going to get worse every day and brother
[52:39] Branham said this statement you could
[52:41] put Abraham Lincoln and George
[52:42] Washington in every position you could
[52:44] think of and it still wouldn't stop this
[52:46] country from going the way it's going
[52:48] and so we can't let that just down on us
[52:51] we can't let that kill our walk
[52:54] because
[52:55] each day is a step closer to the Rapture
[52:58] so we got to give all that we have to
[53:00] Christ stop letting your past mistakes
[53:03] engulf you stop letting your current
[53:05] situation engulf your thoughts
[53:07] see a lot of times we'll get sold caught
[53:10] up in our current situation and why it's
[53:12] like this how it ended up like this that
[53:14] we lose our Focus off Jesus and that's
[53:17] the devil because the devil wants you to
[53:20] get so bogged down
[53:22] with their problems
[53:24] with their trials and then you start to
[53:27] get bogged down you start complaining
[53:28] you start murmuring and you lose what
[53:31] gratitude
[53:33] you lose the attitude of gratitude
[53:35] and we got to really catch ourselves
[53:37] when we get in that situation because it
[53:40] comes so subtle then it becomes into
[53:41] such a uh something so little becomes so
[53:45] big so that's why it's so important to
[53:48] try what you're thinking
[53:50] think where'd that thought come from
[53:51] because whatever you're thinking is
[53:53] going to be what you're going to become
[53:54] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[53:57] amen so don't let your current situation
[54:00] and go for your thoughts
[54:02] see let's start looking to the Lord
[54:04] that's where our strength comes from
[54:06] your strength comes from the Lord not
[54:09] negative thoughts because if you keep
[54:10] doing the same old thing you get the
[54:12] same old result every time
[54:13] let's go to Isaiah 26.
[54:16] so this is the key right here if you
[54:17] want to live an overcoming life
[54:21] I believe this is part of the key right
[54:22] here in Isaiah 26 3-4 and now we all
[54:25] know this
[54:26] and we got a client like brother Beckman
[54:28] said that this is this is my word this
[54:31] is me and so you got to just claim this
[54:33] word for yourself claim it for your life
[54:35] claim it for your family
[54:38] amen
[54:39] verse three and Retail verse four so it
[54:43] says so check this out thou will keep
[54:45] him in perfect peace whose mind is
[54:49] stayed on he doesn't say thou will keep
[54:51] him in perfect peace whose mind is State
[54:53] on negative thoughts it doesn't but it
[54:55] says that will keep him in perfect peace
[54:58] whose mind is stayed on the look what it
[55:01] says because he trusted in me and what a
[55:05] verse 4. trust ye in the Lord forever
[55:08] for in the Lord Jehovah look what it
[55:11] says is Everlasting strength the news
[55:15] isn't going to give you strength uh your
[55:17] best friend is going to give you
[55:18] strength but it says the Lord Jehovah is
[55:22] Everlasting I think a lot of times we're
[55:24] looking for strength in all the wrong
[55:25] places it could be our favorite song it
[55:28] could be our favorite preacher
[55:31] but the thing is your strength comes
[55:34] from God the joy of the Lord is your
[55:37] strength
[55:37] amen
[55:40] see we want peace we all want peace
[55:42] right
[55:43] but oftentimes we aren't willing to pay
[55:45] the price of what that piece requires
[55:48] see it pray it pays what the the slow
[55:51] down
[55:52] what the price we have to pay is is a
[55:54] consecrated life we have to deny ourself
[55:57] we have to stop waiting for God to wave
[56:00] some magic wand God doesn't always wave
[56:02] some magic wand but you gotta press you
[56:05] gotta dig in to get that peace because
[56:08] the devil doesn't want you to get that
[56:10] peace he wants to distract you from that
[56:13] peace he wants you to fall short of that
[56:15] peace because he knows when you get into
[56:17] that the peace of God then he can't
[56:19] bombard you anymore he can't distract
[56:21] you because your focus is no longer on
[56:23] the situation but your focus on God and
[56:26] how he's going to carry you through
[56:27] because he promised to carry you through
[56:28] he has to because he promised it amen
[56:32] so the thing is we don't keep our mind
[56:34] constantly on him that's why we don't
[56:37] get that perfect peace we got our mind
[56:38] and so many other things I got to do
[56:40] this today I got to get this done today
[56:41] and you know I got a busy week this week
[56:44] and I'm a pencil guide in here but no
[56:46] you got to keep your mind stayed on him
[56:48] if you want that peace you got to keep
[56:50] your mind stayed on him
[56:52] don't look at what's going wrong but
[56:54] look at God
[56:55] amen
[56:57] and we can't forget one of the Lord's
[57:00] redempt his name the names is Jehovah
[57:02] Shalom the God of Peace So I think we
[57:05] forget what kind of God we serve and
[57:08] we'll go I love the book of Psalms we'll
[57:09] go in Psalms 121. in reverses one
[57:12] through eight
[57:14] amen so David said in the Book of Psalms
[57:17] verse 1 I will lift up my eyes unto the
[57:20] hills
[57:21] from whence cometh my help so David
[57:23] recognized where his help coming from it
[57:25] didn't come from
[57:27] um a king in this area didn't come from
[57:30] his best friend but it came from God
[57:31] says my help coming from the Lord which
[57:34] made Heaven and Earth
[57:36] he will not suffer thy foot to be moved
[57:39] he he that keepeth thee will not Slumber
[57:41] so he recognizes the situation you're in
[57:44] he knows you're going through pain he
[57:46] knows you're going through sickness he
[57:47] knows all these he knows these things
[57:50] but behold he that keepeth Israel shall
[57:53] neither slumber nor sleep The Lord Is
[57:55] Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shade upon
[57:58] thy right hand the son shall not smite
[58:01] thee by day nor the Moon by night
[58:03] the Lord shall preserve thee from all
[58:05] evil notice that all evil not just some
[58:07] but all evil he shall preserve thy soul
[58:11] the Lord shall preserve that going out
[58:13] and thy coming in from this time forth
[58:15] and forevermore
[58:18] let's go to Psalms 23. verses 4.
[58:33] amen yea though I walk through the
[58:35] valley of the shadow of death notice
[58:37] there's light in that Valley because it
[58:39] has to be their shadow
[58:40] I will fear no evil notice that for thou
[58:44] art with me thy rod and thy staff
[58:47] comfort me so we walk through that trial
[58:50] just recognize that God's right there
[58:52] with you you've got to recognize it may
[58:55] not seem like he's there but he's there
[58:56] let him comfort you with his his rod and
[58:59] his staff
[59:01] and then go to Psalms let's go to Psalms
[59:02] 91.
[59:08] the more we can recognize that God is a
[59:10] present God and a present help the more
[59:13] we would we're gonna benefit in the
[59:16] situation that we're in
[59:17] because we recognize that God is always
[59:19] there he's the same yesterday today and
[59:21] forever he's the same God that was part
[59:23] the Red Sea he's the same God that led
[59:25] Joshua he's the same God that wants to
[59:27] lead you so you got to have faith and
[59:29] confidence that God
[59:32] knows how to lead your life
[59:34] see a lot of times we try to lead our
[59:36] own life and we wind up frustrated but
[59:39] if you let God do the leading then that
[59:42] frustration won't enter in because God
[59:44] is ordering your steps but you got to
[59:46] believe that he's ordering your steps
[59:47] you got to be willing to walk in the way
[59:49] that he's ordering your steps that's the
[59:51] key
[59:52] 91 and reverses one through two he that
[59:55] dwelleth in a secret place of the most
[59:57] high shall abide under the shadow of the
[59:59] Almighty
[1:00:00] I will say of the Lord he is my what my
[1:00:03] refuge my Fortress my God and him will I
[1:00:07] trust so we got to be able to claim that
[1:00:10] for ourselves you gotta be able to say
[1:00:12] that he is my refuge that he is my
[1:00:15] Fortress and he's my God
[1:00:19] and what is a refuge it's a shelter or
[1:00:22] protection from danger or distress that
[1:00:25] which shelters or protects from danger
[1:00:27] distress or calamity
[1:00:29] a stronghold which protects by its
[1:00:33] strength or a sanctuary which secures
[1:00:36] safely by its sacredness any place take
[1:00:39] us out
[1:00:40] inaccessible to an enemy one more time
[1:00:43] any place inaccessible to an enemy
[1:00:47] that's what shelter is if you're
[1:00:49] sheltered in Christ the enemy can't even
[1:00:51] get in he's locked out because you're in
[1:00:54] that Fortress of of Refuge I looked at
[1:00:58] the word Fortress it's any fortified
[1:01:00] place a fort or a castle remember back
[1:01:03] in the day when the kings and queens had
[1:01:05] these castles they couldn't enter in
[1:01:07] because it was guarded and protected but
[1:01:10] we have an even better Fortress not made
[1:01:12] by man's hands but as spiritual Fortress
[1:01:15] that the enemy can throw any kind of
[1:01:17] Dart he wants but it won't get in
[1:01:19] because you're fortified in Christ
[1:01:21] amen let's go to uh Psalms 46.
[1:01:30] in Reverse over verse 1 through 11.
[1:01:34] I'm sorry I didn't put that on there it
[1:01:35] came to me while I was studying back
[1:01:37] there
[1:01:38] so
[1:01:40] God is our refuge
[1:01:42] and strength a very present help in
[1:01:47] trouble
[1:01:48] therefore will we not fear though the
[1:01:51] Earth be removed notice that therefore
[1:01:53] will we not fear though the Earth be
[1:01:55] removed and though the mountains be
[1:01:58] carried into the midst of the sea verse
[1:02:00] 3 though the waters therefore Roar and
[1:02:03] be troubled though the mountain Shake
[1:02:05] was swelling thereof Selah so we could
[1:02:07] we could put ourselves in a situation
[1:02:09] though the worst trial we've ever been
[1:02:11] through our best friend doesn't want to
[1:02:14] be our friend anymore you you feel like
[1:02:16] you lose your job whatever the water
[1:02:18] heater goes out whatever you fill in the
[1:02:19] blank but it's telling me
[1:02:22] I'm like you're not going to be removed
[1:02:24] you can't be moved because you're in God
[1:02:25] verse 4 there is a river the streams
[1:02:28] where shall make glad the city of God
[1:02:30] the holy place of the Tabernacles of the
[1:02:33] most high you know that's what it says
[1:02:34] right here God is in the midst of her
[1:02:37] you got to recognize that God is in the
[1:02:39] midst of your trial he's there
[1:02:41] she shall not be moved God shall help
[1:02:45] her and net right early
[1:02:47] though the Heathen rage and the kingdoms
[1:02:49] were moved he uttered his voice in the
[1:02:52] earth melted look what says right here
[1:02:54] the Lord of hosts is with us the Lord is
[1:02:56] with you you got to believe that
[1:02:58] the god of Jacob is our refuge
[1:03:03] amen come and behold the works of the
[1:03:06] Lord watch desolations he hath made in
[1:03:08] the earth he maketh Wars to cease unto
[1:03:11] the end of the Earth he breakth the bow
[1:03:13] and cutteth the spear in the Sunder he
[1:03:15] burneth a chariot in the fire but check
[1:03:17] this out be still and know that I am God
[1:03:21] stop getting so busy
[1:03:23] that she don't have time to hear his
[1:03:25] voice
[1:03:27] get still before God and know who he is
[1:03:30] get to know him more get to know what he
[1:03:32] wants in the situation in your life
[1:03:34] ask him Lord what are you trying to
[1:03:37] show me in this trial what am I lacking
[1:03:40] in this trial I want to do exactly what
[1:03:43] you want me to do in this trial be more
[1:03:45] sincere be more personal stop
[1:03:46] complaining about the trial and to see
[1:03:48] God what are you trying to show me I
[1:03:50] want to be able to see exactly what you
[1:03:52] need me to see Lord give me I spiritual
[1:03:54] eyes just to recognize
[1:03:57] verse 11 the Lord of hosts is with us
[1:03:59] the god of Jacob is our refuge amen
[1:04:03] go to Psalms 18.
[1:04:12] amen
[1:04:15] I will love thee O Lord my strength so
[1:04:19] it's another my my strength
[1:04:22] the Lord is what my rock
[1:04:25] so notice all these things David is
[1:04:26] doing he's saying these things
[1:04:27] personally because that's what the Lord
[1:04:29] is personally to him and he's
[1:04:31] experienced these things personally in
[1:04:33] his life so you have to be able to
[1:04:35] experience these things be able to
[1:04:36] really claim that
[1:04:38] so you can't just read it but you got to
[1:04:39] say Lord You Are My Rock You Are My
[1:04:42] Fortress you are my deliverer You Are My
[1:04:44] Strength and claim me say no to say it
[1:04:46] because it sounds good but claim it
[1:04:48] because you know this word is true that
[1:04:50] he is he's all these things to you
[1:04:53] since the Lord is my rock and my
[1:04:54] Fortress and my deliverer
[1:04:57] there's no situation too big or too
[1:04:59] small for him to delivery out of
[1:05:04] amen I will trust my Buckler and look
[1:05:07] another one my Buckler and the Horn of
[1:05:10] what my salvation and my high tower look
[1:05:13] how many my eyes are in here
[1:05:15] and the word the word buckler is a kind
[1:05:18] of Shield or a piece of defensive armor
[1:05:21] anciently used to support or defend so
[1:05:24] notice that he's your Shield he told
[1:05:25] Abraham that in a Genesis that he's just
[1:05:27] he's just Buckler
[1:05:28] amen amen
[1:05:31] so we just see these things that
[1:05:33] whatever situation you're going through
[1:05:36] you got to claim these things personally
[1:05:38] in your life because the devil wants you
[1:05:40] not to claim these things he wants you
[1:05:42] to start bickering and complaining why
[1:05:45] I'm why am I in the situation God why am
[1:05:47] I ask what the devil wants us to do
[1:05:50] and we're going to let's go to Psalms
[1:05:51] 119.
[1:05:56] amen
[1:05:59] verses 47 through 50.
[1:06:03] amen
[1:06:06] says and I will Delight myself in thy
[1:06:10] Commandments which I have loved see the
[1:06:12] more we can fall in love with the word
[1:06:14] of God
[1:06:16] it's gonna it'll carry you through your
[1:06:17] situation
[1:06:19] because when you fall in love with the
[1:06:20] word you believe that
[1:06:22] it's all the truth that you that this
[1:06:25] promise that you're reading is for me
[1:06:28] that I'm reading this written personally
[1:06:30] just for me it's written personally just
[1:06:32] for my situation and I'm going to claim
[1:06:34] it so you got the more you fall in love
[1:06:36] with the word because the more you
[1:06:37] really fall in love with the word you
[1:06:38] fall in love with God because God in his
[1:06:40] word are one you can't separate the two
[1:06:41] you got to have both of them so the more
[1:06:44] you can fall in love the more you can
[1:06:45] worship the word the more you can thank
[1:06:47] the Lord in advance for what he's going
[1:06:48] to do the more you're gonna be not
[1:06:51] looking at the negative but looking
[1:06:52] towards the positive
[1:06:54] verse 48 my hands also will lift up to
[1:06:58] thy Commandments which I have loved and
[1:07:00] I will meditate in thy statutes verse 49
[1:07:04] remember the word unto thy servant upon
[1:07:07] which thou has caused me to Hope
[1:07:10] this is my comfort and my affliction
[1:07:13] from that word has quickened me
[1:07:15] so the word was going to comfort you in
[1:07:18] your affliction
[1:07:19] no matter what you're going through read
[1:07:22] the word
[1:07:23] you got to read it don't just read it
[1:07:25] just to read it but really read it to
[1:07:26] embody it we're talking about
[1:07:27] manifesting the word you got to have
[1:07:30] such a desperation in the Lord this word
[1:07:32] that I'm reading I want to manifest it
[1:07:34] in my life I want others to be able to
[1:07:36] see you and not me
[1:07:39] amen
[1:07:41] I go to Second Corinthians chapter one
[1:07:44] three through four
[1:07:45] read a quote first though hidden life in
[1:07:47] Christ I think the key
[1:07:48] is really a hidden life in Christ
[1:07:51] brother Brown says a statement in 1956
[1:07:54] February 13. Christianity is a sacrifice
[1:07:58] life
[1:07:59] a hidden life with God through Christ
[1:08:02] sealed by the Holy Ghost amen
[1:08:06] go second Corinthians
[1:08:08] um to
[1:08:10] chapter one three through four
[1:08:17] amen
[1:08:19] so it says in verse three
[1:08:22] blessed be God even the father of our
[1:08:24] Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies
[1:08:27] and the God of all no it's not all
[1:08:29] comfort read that again
[1:08:31] blessed be God even the father of our
[1:08:33] Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies
[1:08:35] and the God of All Comfort
[1:08:37] who come forth I love this says who
[1:08:40] cometh Us in all our tribulation notice
[1:08:44] that not just some not just parts of it
[1:08:47] but it says all
[1:08:49] that we may be able to comfort ah notice
[1:08:51] that that we be able to comfort them
[1:08:53] which are in any trouble by the Comfort
[1:08:56] worth we ourselves are comforted of god
[1:08:58] notice the motive behind him give me
[1:09:00] that comfort so you can go Comfort
[1:09:02] somebody else
[1:09:03] I love God how God thinks that way it's
[1:09:07] not just about you you you but when he
[1:09:09] gives you something he wants you to be
[1:09:10] able to bless somebody else like when
[1:09:12] God gives you a gift it's not just for
[1:09:14] you to Harbor and use but it's for you
[1:09:16] to use somebody else so God can use you
[1:09:18] to bless somebody else and that's the
[1:09:21] what a gift really is for
[1:09:22] amen
[1:09:24] 1956 the hidden Life of Christ again
[1:09:27] that's what the real Christian Life
[1:09:28] consists of not how well you can do this
[1:09:31] or how well you can sing that's all
[1:09:34] right
[1:09:34] now how well you can preach that's fine
[1:09:36] but that isn't it it's a hidden life
[1:09:39] consecrated the veil curtains dropped
[1:09:42] around you so that's what we're talking
[1:09:44] about really engulfing that's what a
[1:09:46] engulfing is is a hidden life in Christ
[1:09:48] it's no more you living but it's Christ
[1:09:50] Living inside of you
[1:09:52] so our life must be hit in Christ Our
[1:09:55] Life must be devoted and dedicated to
[1:09:57] Christ daily as we said we cannot let
[1:10:00] the things that we're going through
[1:10:01] affect our love relationship with Christ
[1:10:04] in fact it should get stronger I believe
[1:10:07] your love relationship is what's going
[1:10:09] to get you through that's the only thing
[1:10:11] that's going to get you through Is Your
[1:10:12] Love relationship with Christ
[1:10:14] we have to be feeding on the right
[1:10:15] things the right kind of thoughts the
[1:10:18] right articles the right news all these
[1:10:20] things we got to be feeding on the right
[1:10:22] things we need to be hid in prayer
[1:10:24] hidden the word of God and hitting the
[1:10:27] message of the hour
[1:10:28] and I promise you if those three things
[1:10:30] that you're hidden then you're going to
[1:10:32] live an overcoming life you have to
[1:10:34] because you're hiding and you're not
[1:10:36] just reading it but you're really the
[1:10:37] the desire the motive is Lord I want to
[1:10:40] see you more in everything that I do in
[1:10:42] your word and your profit uh in prayer
[1:10:46] all these things is going to be what's
[1:10:48] gonna the key for you to overcome it
[1:10:50] amen got a couple more quotes but the
[1:10:53] man who entered in and the veil fell
[1:10:56] behind him he didn't depend on the
[1:10:58] sunlight nor the Starlight nor the
[1:11:00] Moonlight or the seven golden
[1:11:01] candlesticks he moved up to the altar
[1:11:05] under the interlocked wings of the
[1:11:07] cherubim the Shekinah glory of the Lord
[1:11:09] was in there a smooth light and he lived
[1:11:12] and was there all the day and night he
[1:11:14] walked in the light of the Living God
[1:11:16] Amen and that's what prayer does that
[1:11:18] enters you into that Veil
[1:11:20] whether the clouds was going on whether
[1:11:23] the rain was falling whether the Thunder
[1:11:24] was rolling whether an army was coming
[1:11:27] it didn't mean a bit of difference to
[1:11:29] him he was protected and that's what a
[1:11:32] hidden life in Christ is you're not
[1:11:34] worried about what's going on out here
[1:11:35] what's here or this there you're not
[1:11:36] worried about what the boss is going to
[1:11:37] say but the only thing you're worried
[1:11:39] about is pleasing Christ the only thing
[1:11:40] you're worried about is Lord am I living
[1:11:42] the life that you're calling me to live
[1:11:44] Lord I want to be on this Earth what you
[1:11:46] want me to be that's what a consecrated
[1:11:48] life is
[1:11:49] amen
[1:11:51] he was protected he was in a Shekinah
[1:11:53] Glory living in the presence of God
[1:11:55] hallelujah you think I'm a Holy Roller
[1:11:58] maybe I am
[1:11:59] amen
[1:12:01] come on the inside let the world howl
[1:12:03] and carry on let the preacher fail then
[1:12:05] everything else failed that don't stop
[1:12:06] you a bit stay in there you're living by
[1:12:10] the pot of manna
[1:12:12] when you'll eat in it when you'll eat it
[1:12:14] anytime you get hungry you don't have to
[1:12:16] worry about the weather it's going to
[1:12:18] happen or this is going to happen see
[1:12:20] we're in Christ you're not worried about
[1:12:21] oh is this going to happen it's going to
[1:12:22] happen oh man is this going to work out
[1:12:24] that way you're not worried about those
[1:12:25] things you remember what says in Romans
[1:12:27] 8 28 let's go to Romans 8 28.
[1:12:32] foreign
[1:12:34] so it says and we know that all things
[1:12:37] work together for the good to them that
[1:12:40] love God to them who are called
[1:12:41] according to his purpose I'm gonna say
[1:12:43] that one more time maybe somebody's
[1:12:44] going through a situation right now and
[1:12:46] we all we know that all things work
[1:12:49] together for the good to them that what
[1:12:51] love God and what else to them who are
[1:12:54] the called according to his purpose you
[1:12:56] got to believe that scripture personally
[1:12:57] to you
[1:12:58] maybe you made a mistake maybe you did
[1:13:01] something but you got to believe that
[1:13:02] God is going to work that to for your
[1:13:05] good he's ha he's going to I promise you
[1:13:08] and the thing is a lot of times we look
[1:13:10] at a situation and we don't remember the
[1:13:11] scripture and we got to remember what
[1:13:13] we're called for and look between a lot
[1:13:16] of people stop it at verse 28 but look
[1:13:17] what 29 says for whom he did for no he
[1:13:20] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:13:22] the image of his son that he might be
[1:13:25] the firstborn of Our Winning brother
[1:13:27] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:13:29] he also called and whom he called them
[1:13:33] he also Justified whom he justified them
[1:13:35] he also glorified so he has called you
[1:13:37] to be an overcomer
[1:13:39] and there's no enemy there is no
[1:13:42] whatever you fill in the blank that can
[1:13:44] stop you unless you do it yourself
[1:13:46] because you're your biggest enemy you
[1:13:48] are your biggest enemy will even go to
[1:13:50] verse 35. it's telling us right here who
[1:13:52] shall separate us from the love of
[1:13:54] Christ it's asking you a question
[1:13:56] what are you going to let separate from
[1:13:58] the love of Christ are you gonna let
[1:13:59] tribulation or distress or persecution
[1:14:02] or famine or nakedness or parale or
[1:14:04] sword are you going to let those things
[1:14:06] affect your love relationship with
[1:14:07] Christ are you going to let those things
[1:14:09] affect your well-being because those
[1:14:12] things can and will affect your
[1:14:13] well-being if you so let it what things
[1:14:16] have you been thinking about like what
[1:14:17] things have you been pondering on lately
[1:14:20] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:14:23] killed all the day long we are accounted
[1:14:25] as sheep for the slaughter maybe you
[1:14:28] look in your life and say this mountain
[1:14:29] in front of me is too big for me to move
[1:14:31] that's not what my God says that's not
[1:14:33] what the word of God says that mountain
[1:14:35] is going to move but you got to believe
[1:14:37] it you can't doubt you can't waver that
[1:14:39] mountain has to move if you have faith
[1:14:41] to believe that Mountain's gonna move
[1:14:42] it's gonna move that's what Jesus said
[1:14:45] amen nay and all these things we are
[1:14:48] more than conquerors
[1:14:51] through him that loved us verse 38
[1:14:55] frying persuaded that neither death nor
[1:14:57] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[1:15:01] powers nor things present nor things to
[1:15:03] come no future trials past mistakes
[1:15:07] we could say that nor height nor depth
[1:15:10] nor any other creature shall be able to
[1:15:12] separate us from the love of God which
[1:15:13] is in Christ Jesus our lord I think Paul
[1:15:16] gave us
[1:15:17] all the things that could affect us but
[1:15:20] he's saying these things should not
[1:15:22] affect us so let's stop making excuses
[1:15:24] let's stop complaining let's just look
[1:15:27] at the god that we serve that he's going
[1:15:29] to carry you through you just got to
[1:15:31] Play Your Part
[1:15:32] even talks about we talked about last
[1:15:34] time in Hebrews
[1:15:36] about the how there's a arrest given to
[1:15:38] the people of God
[1:15:40] and we all can enter into that risk
[1:15:41] God's not a respecter of persons that's
[1:15:43] your rest it's my rest and it says and
[1:15:46] Paul said we gotta labor in to that rest
[1:15:50] and when we says labor you gotta fight
[1:15:53] to stay in that rest you got to pray
[1:15:55] your way into that rest because when
[1:15:57] you're in that rest you're not worried
[1:15:59] about anything anymore necessarily
[1:16:00] you're not worried about the outcomes of
[1:16:02] things you're just worried about
[1:16:03] pleasing God that's your biggest worry
[1:16:05] Lord I want to please you with all my
[1:16:07] heart I don't want to waver one bit
[1:16:10] amen
[1:16:14] oh come on the inside brother brahm's
[1:16:16] giving us that invitation get in the
[1:16:19] presence of the King live there day and
[1:16:22] night notice that
[1:16:24] he don't want you to wander around be
[1:16:26] tossed about you're dissatisfied with
[1:16:28] these men and coming to church and get a
[1:16:30] little old I want it day and night don't
[1:16:32] just wait to church to get your manna
[1:16:34] and the thing is we if you're waiting
[1:16:36] just to go to church
[1:16:38] chances are you're going to leave what
[1:16:39] you heard at church there because it's
[1:16:41] not following you see uh with a debt
[1:16:43] with a Christian Life is it's a hard
[1:16:45] rugged life every day that when you're
[1:16:47] going it's like a for instance
[1:16:50] you have your car
[1:16:52] and you have to fill it up right every
[1:16:54] however many times
[1:16:56] so a lot of times what people do is they
[1:16:57] just fill up a church then they they get
[1:16:59] on E by the time they get back to church
[1:17:02] so the thing is you got to constantly
[1:17:03] fill up your tank your spiritual tank
[1:17:05] you gotta be constantly be praying
[1:17:07] constantly be reading and don't wait
[1:17:08] till when don't be a Wednesday and
[1:17:10] Sunday Christian you'll be an everyday
[1:17:12] Christian see this world is filled with
[1:17:14] so many this Wednesdays and Sundays
[1:17:15] Christian it's like for instance it's
[1:17:17] like it's like you uh God's speaking to
[1:17:20] you on Sunday if you're going to the
[1:17:21] club the next day that's what it's like
[1:17:24] and a lot of people do that they just
[1:17:26] they forget about what God said they
[1:17:28] leave it there and they wonder why not
[1:17:30] live in an overcoming life they wonder
[1:17:31] why they're struggling they wonder why
[1:17:33] they're barely making it into church
[1:17:34] because you're not taking what God spoke
[1:17:37] to you and apply it in your life and
[1:17:39] saying Lord I want to become what I
[1:17:41] heard on Sunday I want to become what I
[1:17:42] heard on Wednesday I want to become what
[1:17:43] I heard the prophet say I want to become
[1:17:46] what I read in Isaiah chapter one today
[1:17:48] you fill in the blank
[1:17:50] that's a lot of times why people can't
[1:17:51] live and stay in the presence of the
[1:17:53] king because they're not willing to pray
[1:17:54] the price they're not willing to do what
[1:17:56] it takes they're not willing to crucify
[1:17:58] their flesh you're not willing
[1:18:00] to just be all what God wants them to be
[1:18:03] that's the key
[1:18:05] amen
[1:18:07] what's the matter with the Church of the
[1:18:09] Living God today
[1:18:10] who's promised that same blessing what's
[1:18:12] the matter with us today because we
[1:18:14] can't get our we can't get enough
[1:18:16] together to group ourselves together to
[1:18:18] come into the holiest of the holiest and
[1:18:21] and their state
[1:18:22] hide yourselves from the things of the
[1:18:25] world and live a look at this a full
[1:18:28] surrendered consecrated life for the
[1:18:31] Lord Jesus Christ amen that's what it is
[1:18:33] coming into the Glorious light of the
[1:18:35] gospel and in doing so you receive it
[1:18:40] amen this other quote I guess from why
[1:18:42] are people so tossed about says did you
[1:18:45] ever meet a person that's been in there
[1:18:46] and he's tasted and living on this Manna
[1:18:49] you can meet him on Monday Tuesday
[1:18:51] Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
[1:18:53] Sunday cloudy day Bright Day gloomy day
[1:18:56] that's going right wrong
[1:18:58] he's always sweet always full of love
[1:19:01] never to talk or do anything wrong he's
[1:19:04] living under the glory of God he never
[1:19:06] gets hungry he he he he never has to go
[1:19:09] to church to get built up notice that
[1:19:11] he's just always full of God see Church
[1:19:13] shouldn't be just a
[1:19:15] some like some pit stop or or some uh a
[1:19:18] filling station of the empty but the
[1:19:20] thing is it should just
[1:19:22] top off the tank
[1:19:24] you know how you're not all you're
[1:19:26] always full but you want to top it off
[1:19:27] that's what church should be it should
[1:19:29] be uh just to give you more gas to go
[1:19:31] even further in your journey and a lot
[1:19:32] of times we use churches
[1:19:35] um we use churches like like some
[1:19:37] Hospital like we're just beat down and
[1:19:38] we're barely making it or crawling on a
[1:19:40] crutch and obviously Church you know it
[1:19:43] can be that for some some things you
[1:19:45] know go through hard things a lot of
[1:19:46] times we make it such a habit of making
[1:19:48] a church is just some hospital where we
[1:19:51] got to be maimed and we got gunshot
[1:19:53] wounds and stuff but we can't make
[1:19:55] church that way we got to make Church
[1:19:57] as it's more of like a it gives you a
[1:19:59] more of a running
[1:20:01] you're running it's like a relay you
[1:20:03] know you get that baton and you're
[1:20:04] running faster
[1:20:05] and we got to look at churches that way
[1:20:07] because God has something for you to
[1:20:09] receive
[1:20:10] he wants to speak to you personally
[1:20:12] you take that word and it should be it
[1:20:14] should build you up it shouldn't it
[1:20:16] should encourage you it should say Lord
[1:20:18] I want to be that Lord I'm coming to
[1:20:20] church because I want to see where I'm
[1:20:21] at with you I'm not coming I want to
[1:20:23] hear my favorite scripture or my
[1:20:25] favorite song sung but I'm coming
[1:20:26] because I know that you have something
[1:20:28] personal for me and Lord if I receive
[1:20:30] that I promise I'm going to walk in it
[1:20:32] I'm gonna do everything I can it is to
[1:20:33] walk in what you're speaking to me and
[1:20:36] notice the desperation the attitude
[1:20:37] right there it's all about attitude you
[1:20:40] got to ask yourself when you walk in
[1:20:41] those doors or even when you're driving
[1:20:43] the way there why am I going to church
[1:20:45] ask yourself that
[1:20:47] because if you really if you're really
[1:20:49] real with yourself you're going to find
[1:20:50] out what the real motive is a lot of
[1:20:52] times we got these mixed Motors oh I
[1:20:54] just I need some encouragement I'm going
[1:20:57] through this no no no no don't come for
[1:20:59] that reason say God I'm here to meet
[1:21:01] with you that's the only reason I'm here
[1:21:02] to worship you I'm here to lift you up
[1:21:04] I'm here to praise your name I don't
[1:21:06] care how I'm feeling I don't care what
[1:21:08] kind of day I had I'm here for you and
[1:21:10] you alone and I'm I'm singing these
[1:21:13] songs of Zion with all my heart I just
[1:21:15] want to come here to make love with you
[1:21:16] and if you have that motive I promise
[1:21:19] Lord is going to meet you he's going to
[1:21:20] meet you every single time because he
[1:21:22] sees your heart's desire he sees your
[1:21:24] hearts intent amen
[1:21:27] no it's the same manner that was eat out
[1:21:30] in the course was eat also in the holies
[1:21:32] of the holies but this man out here give
[1:21:34] out quickly
[1:21:36] you've met people like that would he out
[1:21:38] there and say well brother Brandon I've
[1:21:39] I had the same thing I did this and I
[1:21:41] did that just like they did
[1:21:43] but I've met that woman she's always on
[1:21:45] the housetop notice that
[1:21:47] there's never a worry in her mind notice
[1:21:49] that I met the man wherever he's got a
[1:21:52] big smile on his face and saying praise
[1:21:54] the Lord how you feeling wonderful every
[1:21:56] time he gets sick the preacher comes and
[1:21:58] prays for him brother he's out and gone
[1:22:00] the next day amen he's just wonderful I
[1:22:02] I can't hold my blessing somehow see
[1:22:05] it's the place you're abiding it notice
[1:22:07] that it's the place that you're abiding
[1:22:09] in if you're abiding in your negative
[1:22:11] thoughts what are you going to get
[1:22:13] death every time
[1:22:15] but if you're abiding in Christ if
[1:22:17] you're abiding in this is
[1:22:19] um in Jeremiah
[1:22:21] the thoughts that I think towards you to
[1:22:23] give you an expected end so you gotta be
[1:22:25] thinking in that that situation
[1:22:27] and don't let your current situation
[1:22:29] discourage you because if you abide in
[1:22:32] discouragement
[1:22:34] then you got to take your mind off of
[1:22:36] God every time man you won't have that
[1:22:37] perfect peace so it's the place you're
[1:22:40] abiding in it's where you're at oh I
[1:22:43] want you to get this close remember
[1:22:45] that's many times on the campground
[1:22:46] these blessings run out you're eating
[1:22:49] the Manna the correct manner but you
[1:22:52] haven't consecrated your life really one
[1:22:54] more time you're eating the Manna the
[1:22:56] correct manner but you haven't
[1:22:58] consecrated your life
[1:23:00] and went into a place like Aaron behind
[1:23:02] the holiest of the holiest when he was
[1:23:04] in there nothing he he didn't hear the
[1:23:07] world anymore so a lot of times we're
[1:23:09] waiting for a Revival to come waiting
[1:23:10] for a fiery Evangelical Brothers Andrew
[1:23:13] to come
[1:23:14] you don't have to wait for them to come
[1:23:16] for you to be consecrated for you to be
[1:23:18] on fire for God don't wait because if
[1:23:21] you're waiting for that that fire is
[1:23:22] going to die right away I remember oh I
[1:23:24] never forget the one says men's meeting
[1:23:26] a couple years ago and it was I think it
[1:23:28] was Saturday night going to Sunday night
[1:23:29] and they're doing a devotion
[1:23:31] and he said this statement
[1:23:33] he's don't let what you've heard this
[1:23:36] weekend stay here he said the devil is
[1:23:39] going to come Monday and he's going to
[1:23:40] bombard you with all these things
[1:23:42] because the devil is kind of like he
[1:23:44] raised his drawbridge up because he
[1:23:45] knows he can't get you during the
[1:23:47] weekend because you know that you forgot
[1:23:49] about your problems there and you're
[1:23:50] coming for God but he knows if he can
[1:23:52] get you Monday morning
[1:23:53] then all that you heard Friday Saturday
[1:23:55] and Sunday is going to be in vain
[1:23:57] but he said you gotta let you get take
[1:23:59] that word with you you got to bring it
[1:24:01] with you all the things that amen praise
[1:24:04] the Lord you got to take that with you
[1:24:06] so don't let Thursday tomorrow come and
[1:24:09] it's like you never went to church but
[1:24:11] you take what you heard what God spoke
[1:24:14] to you take it with you
[1:24:15] you think about it you claim it you read
[1:24:18] the scriptures read your notes I I got a
[1:24:21] bad habit sometimes you'll take notes
[1:24:23] you'll read them but take time in the
[1:24:25] morning we wake up in the morning when
[1:24:26] you pray take time when you're studying
[1:24:28] your word read the notes you wrote down
[1:24:31] say the scriptures that you wrote down
[1:24:33] because that's how you got to constantly
[1:24:34] David said I kept the lord always before
[1:24:37] me
[1:24:38] and that's all you got to always keep
[1:24:39] the Lord before you always and I promise
[1:24:42] if you do that always then God is going
[1:24:44] to be more he's going to be preeminating
[1:24:46] your life you're going to be living an
[1:24:48] overcoming life you're going to be
[1:24:49] feeding on that Manna on in the holiest
[1:24:51] of the holiest
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:55] amen praise God
[1:24:57] we'll stand to our feet
[1:25:01] praise God
[1:25:02] amen
[1:25:04] so he said before don't abide in your
[1:25:07] negative thoughts anymore
[1:25:09] don't let the devil have victory in your
[1:25:11] life don't let the devil have any
[1:25:13] preeminence in your life because the
[1:25:15] devil is fighting for preeminence and
[1:25:16] God wants preeminence you you are the
[1:25:19] one who chooses who has the preeminence
[1:25:21] it's a white dog and a black dog in you
[1:25:22] as we heard that many times before
[1:25:25] so whatever dog you feed the most is
[1:25:26] what's going to come out on top so you
[1:25:28] feed that white dog
[1:25:30] whatever you're going through don't wait
[1:25:31] until
[1:25:33] to get desperate when you're in a bad
[1:25:35] situation but get desperate no matter
[1:25:37] what Mountaintop or valleys get
[1:25:39] desperate always and I believe if we
[1:25:42] just get desperate
[1:25:45] then God is going to be so much more
[1:25:47] real to us he has to become more real to
[1:25:49] us every day
[1:25:50] don't just wait till church for him to
[1:25:52] come real this
[1:25:54] give them your all every day if God gave
[1:25:56] you his all you give them your all
[1:25:58] right amen can we sing his strength
[1:26:00] that's perfect
