that all things are possible all things are possible there's an anything impossible with God so praise the Lord I'm so happy to see such a good turnout this morning I don't know who normally comes but man for this cold weather this is good and I'm glad to be here with you this is great and um just to know that the arctic cold is out there it was pretty cold for all of us and to make the effort to come out and be in the house of God and fellowship together I think it's a wonderful thing and to be around friends and family here this this church isn't just uh this church is family and we've been in this journey for many many years and together and we know each other and we are thanking thanking God last night for Brother John and his wife and their faithfulness faithfulness to the message and to Christ and preaching it is to be commended today because there's some dropping by the way side there's some bailing out there some have taken reasoning and so it should be uh appreciated when someone has been faithful this many years to keep doing it people come and go things go up and down but to stay consistent and to have sheep that are consistent say we're sticking with it uh rain or shine we're sticking with what God sent us in this age we're going to keep preaching it big numbers or Little Numbers it doesn't matter we keep preaching it because it is not our message this is not our message it's God's message and it's what he sent and and uh the the privilege is greater than the pressure um the vision is greater than the burden because there is a burden but the the vision that God had for this age is greater than the burdens that we would bear to Bear it uh God's vision is always greater than the circumstances God's vision is bigger than us it's bigger than you it's bigger than troubles uh it's his vision and he will see it through and and I'm just glad to be amongst family this morning and when brother John says I'm busy I don't want to be busy I really don't uh my wife and I are trying to make some adjustments because I'm not in my 30s anymore I'm not in my 40s anymore and uh in my 50s so we're trying to make some adjustments to that because I really just want to love the Lord serve him I want to keep doing things for the Lord but God raises up the Next Generation to carry on the word so I want to encourage them to carry it on through and I really just want to preach feed the sheep and write songs that's basically what I'm coming down to that's all I want to do and let the other stuff go praise the Lord but it is uh good to be amongst family here this morning and to hear the voices and the music go before God I love it and uh I join in with it and I don't know what about this age Brother Bruce it just seems like the the lyrics we can sing songs like that but we can miss the lyrics and I know what it is at this age I just the lyrics so minister to me uh as we see what God inspired those men to write they're so true and they're so relevant to our lives even to today and uh I just I ministered to by them I have I I could sing a couple I always ask my wife to sing she don't sing with me much anymore and um so she's I don't know why but she leaves it to me and then when all the kids come along then she really don't want to sing she wants to let them sing and then when they're around I let them sing too I don't sing and I used to be my wife's favorite singer and then my son Gideon came along and I'm no long I'm no longer her favorite and she lets me know that and he's he's I I enjoy him too I enjoy him too I used to get invited to all the weddings to sing I don't get to invited to any weddings my son and all the kids get invited so I'm just there in the back row of the wedding just observing basically that's that's how it happens you know after so many years so I um my sister um asked me to write uh she was doing some new uh new Christmas songs and she asked me to write some Christmas songs songs and I only got to one but I thought I would do that this morning um and see if I can remember the words here I wrote it a few weeks ago and they did it for outreach concert want to use this one okay and uh so I was going to see if we could do that one this [Music] morning [Music] overnight a new law was pass bringing Joseph on a journey fast and though he felt a little fear inside he knew there had to be a greater reason why so with Mary and the child on the way he stepped out in faith and something made him s going back to Bethlehem to the place where it all began I know God will lead us [Music] there we'll SE God's mystery in this place of Simplicity I know we will find him going back to [Music] Bethlehem these are days of uncertainty only God knows where I need to be complicated minds are torn too far away from where Jesus can be born I desire for him to lead me to the place where the world can see his glory and his grace oh going back to Bethlehem to the place where it all began I know God will lead us there we'll find God's mystery in this place of Simplicity I know God will lead us there back to [Music] Bethlehem going back to Bethlehem to the place where it all began I [Music] know God will lead us there and we'll seek God's mystery in this place of Simplicity I know we will find him going back to Beth this Christ we will find him going back to Bethlehem praise the Lord amen

read this morning in Romans chapter 8 we'll share a portion of the word and fellowship around the word this morning in Romans 8 and um we pray that we can be a blessing to you amen and the local congregation here praise the Lord Romans chapter 8 verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage against to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father when we receive the Holy Ghost it's called here the spirit of adoption which to me means we receive something within us that begins a journey of bringing us to full adoption bringing bringing us to full maturity um when we receive that Spirit of adoption we have all the potential already within us to take us to full adoption the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not even worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US us for the earnest expectation that's where I want to take my text from the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject of vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in hope all of creation fell when Adam and Eve fell everything would become subject to this fall verse 21 because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God as we get our Liberty and come to our adoption and restoration and Redemption all of creation comes with us for we know that the whole creation Groth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it the Redemption of our body Amen to the word of God father father we ask you to help us this morning learn something from your word we ask you to anoint it Lord we ask you to come and be present Among Us Lord greatest thing that we can receive is revelation from you so we know how to live and receive strength and Lord we pray every person here every one listening online every uh maybe some couldn't come because of the weather we pray you Minister each one even the children the teenagers everyone that's here be personal to them this morning Lord come alongside them father and just draw their hearts to you through your word and we commit this service in this day to you in jesus' name amen God bless you may be seated so we want to take this portion of scripture and um just elaborate on it and see what the Lord would speak through it this morning and it's been a subject that uh for many many years that I've en enjoyed and pondered and thought about but I guess will just title this this morning the expectation of mature Sons um expectation is a a beautiful thing um expectation and expecting something uh whether it be in this life or with God but we know the greatest expectation we can have is what God will do what God's going to do next what is what is happening with God and that that creates something within us and that's expectation and we know about expect ation from a little child because we know what it is to expect and be looking forward to something that's coming ahead whether it's your birthday or whether it's something that's a a date that's coming ahead or a holiday or something and so we've learned to be under expectation for something that will bring us joy something that will encourage us and just the thought of the expectation of it has joy in it am and so expectation is a great thing because it brings Joy and in this scripture in um 19 it says the the it speaks of an Earnest expectation an Earnest expectation and that means it it's eager it's an intense expectation there's a passion that goes with it it's something to look forward to and he and here in scripture we have for the earnest expectation of the creature it even tells us that all of creation all of the animals all the animal kingdom is all under expectation it's all looking forward to the restoration of this Earth because this Earth fell and and sin came on this Earth and sin begin to take over and now you know you have uh uh the things killing animals not just for meat that's fine but killing them randomly and so all of creation lives in nervousness of that well we have killing on the streets we have killing in cities we have killing in little cities going on people killing one another that's because we've had 6,000 years of sin on the earth Adam and Eve fell and so now the whole earth fell with it and so now because we've Fallen God put in his word that there's going to be a full restoration to take us back to Eden again and somehow in creation it knows this expectation it is expecting for God to restore it completely back so listen let me say it this morning if all of creation has an expectation of complete restoration ought we to have an expect expectation in our heart God has not finished the job in you yet God has much more to do in you yet and we should be under joy and expectation of that an expectation you know it's it's we it should be eager intense and if we lose expectation of Life uh life becomes boring amen even the Christian Life can become boring if we don't have have expectation of what God's going to do next I think when we come to church we should be under expectation every service every Wednesday night because you see we're not dealing with just the pastor or just another service we're dealing with God we're dealing with God we're going to meet with God and God could do anything he could drop a little Revelation in your heart on a Wednesday night even and you realize that's the most powerful thing that's ever happened in your life but you see now we have to be under expectation of God God we're looking forward to what you want to do when you come to church you'll sing different if you're under expect you'll say Amen different if you're under expectation you'll drive distances to get to church because why expectation and earnestness and eagerness does that to you I'm looking forward to what God can do if we lose that we lose the joy of life we lose the joy of serving the lord and it's not just coming to church every day we should be under expectation God what are you going to do today what can you do through me today every day is a new day with my Lord every day his mercies are new every morning whatever happened yesterday is yesterday what God what are you going to do today and we should live under this expectation or we become dead life becomes boring life becomes a a drag but when you got expectation then you have something to look forward to especially in God now when you realize the season that we're in spiritually right now scripturally uh it's very very exciting because we've been a people that has able to see I'm just going to jump right to I know you're taught well here so I'm going to jump right to some things we know but I want to remind you of them that we're in a season now it's very exciting because we've been the people to be able to see things in the Bible that has been fulfilled already right in front of us scripture has been fulfilled right in front of us uh and God said something he would do for this age God said that he would uh send us Elijah the prophet and he promised that all the way back in the Bible and then he did it in front of us he sent that and he's already finished his commission to bring us back to the word so that's something that we know God said he would do and we're a people privileged to see wow we've seen that happen in front of us so we we know that God is able to fulfill his word I like the song Brother Bruce sang this morning that that hymn that says I know I may not know a lot of things but I know he's able to keep that which I've committed to him I'm persuaded that he's able to keep his word and guess what too here's another thing God never disappoints amen if we're under expectations the right expectations for the word God never disappoints now when you go through things in life it looks like God's disappointed you it looks like maybe sometimes you didn't get your request but when you step back and look at the whole picture of your life I can tell you he's got 6,000 years of history he's got a perfect track record he's always kept his word he's never disappointed he's always been right on time God never disappoints you people will disappoint you people will disappoint you and you'll disappoint yourself but don't ever let the devil tell you that God will disappoint you just because he doesn't answer a prayer right on time or whatever God never disappoints us God always comes comes through can you say amen and I can trust a god like that he never disappoints and so now we are gathering of people who are blessed to see scripture fulfilled in our time right in front of us what was expected for the end times just it's happened just like God said he would do it and and we all know that and but then with knowing we've seen things fulfilled I'm going to give you some scriptures that have already been fulfilled in our age seeing it's been fulfilled this we know that it's not all completed yet it's not all fulfilled yet one of the reasons we know that is we're still sitting here in church in 2024 and none of us expected to uh be here this long okay one of the reasons we know there's still some some to be fulfilled is we're still here this morning um you know I never thought uh I never I thought we'd be in the coming of the Lord Brother Bruce I thought I'd never finish High School of course my parent my parents thought I'd never finish high school but it was for other reasons they thought I'd never finished high school too but but but I thought I'd never get to finishing High School I thought the coming of the Lord he going to come and then so now my 20s and my 30s and I thought no this will be over in a long time God sent the prophet bang bang bang we're done we're out of here and here we are in 2024 and we don't know all the reasons why but we know there's still more to be fulfilled there must be more to come from our lives yet because a a link to the Rapture is the link to this manifested sons of God a link to the restoration of the earth and all creation being restored is this manifestation of the sons of God this this maturity that comes in his sons this positioning I know who I am as a son and with that comes power it comes character and we when we get to that position fully then we know instantly the Rapture takes place cuz God's all finished but we know we're not there yet so what's it do it sets us under expect expectation so there were some expectations in the Bible to remind you of them this morning that uh there was a cry for certain things to happen and so Malachi 4 5 and 6 Matthew 1711 acts 3:21 Revelations 5:7 Revelations 101 Revelations 10 1-7 there was a cry for hundreds of years for these things to take place but I'm happy to say this morning that all of these scriptures have fulfilled or under under still being fulfilled but a lot of them have already been fulfilled where people can take that many scriptures and there's more and and I can't I don't have time to let you write them all down but all these Matthew Malachi 4 Matthew 1711 acts 3:21 Revelations 57 all of these have been fulfilled or being fulfilled and we live in that day yes so it's a wonderful thing they've been fulfilled and then you come to Romans 819 that says for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God I personally believe that all those scriptures I read to you have been fulfilled but yet they're to set us up for Revel Romans 8:19 to be fulfilled all of those scriptures have been fulfilled to bring us to the Fulfillment of Romans 8:19 and that's the manifested sons of God the end result to God sending a prophet the end result to God go restoring us back to Bible Faith the end result to all the Mysteries being revealed in the end time the end result for God sending the seventh angel to reveal the mystery of God should be finished the end result all of it is manifested sons of God that's the end result to the message it's doesn't stop at God sending a prophet it's manifest so this is yet to be fulfilled this is happening now and the Fulfillment of this is because he's already fulfilled all of those other things amen hallelujah this is where we are now you know it doesn't say in the Bible that all creation groans for a prophet to come amen doesn't say that all creation is waiting and groaning for the restoration of all the mysteries of God for all the Mysteries it doesn't say that all creation is waiting and groaning under expectation for for a prophet to come from the Mysteries to be revealed for a restoration message to bring us back to no no no no no it's all creation groans for the manifestation of the sons it doesn't say son singular Jesus Christ it's Sons it's plural it's a body it's it's a world of Sons and Daughters of God this is what creation is under expectation for we're looking at you this morning we're looking at where your life is in Christ where the Holy Ghost is taking you every day that's the expectation CU if those Sons come into their position and recognize it in the word of God and they come to a place of power and character restored back again it all of a sudden begins to start the wheels turning to this entire Earth being restored again it starts with Suns it fell because a sun fell this Earth was created for sons of God to rule and Reign and Adam stood there with Eve ruling and reigning over this Earth in charge of the elements I mean there was no storms back then like this but if there had been Adam could speak that storm away can you say amen he had control he named all the animals he had control because the whole Earth was created not for God but for his sons to rule and Reign through God and so they were in control of this earth when he fell in sin Eve fell in sin Adam fell with her everything got lost all of creation fell the whole earth fell and sin came into the picture and so now because a son got out of his position and fell everything fell with it but when Sons come back into their place and start living like sons of God on this Earth everything begins to trickle down and be restored with it you watch a man put his life in order according to this message and according to this word and you watch over time God will start putting his family together God will start restoring a marriage you start with a son getting his position in humility and he starts to see his place and his sins have been forgiven his past has been forgiven he no longer views himself for his past this is who I am in Christ and I'm staying here upon the word of God you watch that be a trickle down effect to the rest of the church to the rest of the families it may take a while for some kids to come back to the Lord but they're coming back can I get an amen this morning it may take a while you just hold your position you keep praying can you say Amen because everything I see in the word is when we find our position that everything that's precious to us all of our children that's precious to us God's promised us our children don't doubt that it's a promise in the word of God but it fell because a sun fell and so it'll come back again because a son gets his position again all creation is under Earnest expectation for Sons man manifested sons of God I love it I love it amen so the word being fulfilled sets us under expectation for what's next or what's coming or what's to be finished in this if you've looked close at the word you will see seasons change sometimes under the same message we won't spend a lot of time on this I'll skip through this but if you watch the Bible pattern when God sends a message he initiates it and brings the initial part of it but then there's a it begins to change and see reasons within that message to bring it to the full manifestation of why he sent it um we could refer to the former and latter Reign being under the same move move of God at the last days we could refer to the change from Elijah to Elisha you could you could talk a lot about that change from Elijah to Elisha he had a double portion of the Spirit come on him Elijah had to go off the scene but there was a change that Administration and uh so we could speak of going from the change from Moses a prophet to Joshua that was a change under the same message the Moses commission was to bring the people out of Egypt the Joshua commission was to take the people into their Promised Land you see it's all under the same message but it's a different commission it's a Joshua commission and so uh once Moses brought them out then the expectation changed and many of the people children of Israel were so immature and upset uh they they wanted to either stay in the wilderness or they wanted to go back to Egypt why because they didn't have the vision where the message was taken them amen right they didn't have a vision of where this message was taken them it and it wasn't to stay under Moses it wasn't to sit around for 40 years and watch signs of Moses give us another sign Lord help us God we need we're out of this we're out of that even when they were crossed over the Red Sea they were still complaining I've been thinking about it lately how in speaking about maturity coming more in our Liv lives instead of childishness for 40 years the children of Israel will immature little kids depending on Miracles and signs to keep them going I believe in miracles and signs sister Sharon my sister Sharon had stage four cancer this year and God has completely she had two tumors on her body they're completely gone she's completely cancer free by the glory of God he still heals he still raises the dead amen can you say amen and our children and unbelievers need to see the power of God that way but for me I don't need to see another miracle to make me stay that's right God if God never did another miracle I'm here to stay I'm going to the Rapture but God's still doing those things but immaturity learns to depend on that do this or I'm going back to Egypt Lord do this answer my prayer just this way I'm going to that's immaturity and on this side of the Red Sea the Pharaoh's Army was coming the Red Sea was in front of them they all begin to complain oh what are we going to do what are we going to do and even Moses is a little scared and God has to come down and correct his own prophet and to say why are you crying immaturity immaturity why cry speak and go forward I gave you a commission speak and go forward well somebody stepped up in faith in Moses and he says listen let the O Red Sea just open up and we'll cross over on dry ground and God did it the interesting thing to me is they walked over on dry ground in a supernatural Miracle then they get on the other side and Pharaoh's Army was dumped all with the water he swallowed the whole Pharaoh's Army the waters begin to and and their enemies destroyed right in front of their eyes and that's why Miriam got happy and grabbed the tambourine I don't know if there's a tambourine here but that's when shouting took place that's when all they begin to rejoice as they seen the enemy and guess what and a lot of preaching today really does a lot of themes about Miriam grabbing the tambourine and they work it up I love messages like that I don't hear too many messages though um the immaturity of the Saints before they Red Sea and then 3 days later after they shouted with the tambourine they're already complaining that they don't have something don't hear Too Many sermons on that right but oh we hear them about the tambourine and shouting and dancing what is it we have to preach the manifestation of the sons of God this message is not taking us just to another shouting time it is to take us to mature pure manifested Sons and Daughters of God is that okay the pastor Pastor can correct me if I need anything corrected but this has been on my heart to see what's the expectation for what's the right expectations where are we going with this thing not back to another Pentecostal Revival not backwards but forward amen amen so it changed under Jo Moses and Joshua it changed it there's so many more examples that change of leadership from Saul to David it's in the Bible as a type the leadership because remember the children of Israel they chose Saul as the leadership they chose the wrong leadership but I want you to know Saul and David were were anointed by the same Prophet Saul and David were under the same message anointed by the same Prophet it was just the wrong type of leadership and the people chose the wrong lead and God said okay go ahead I've got somebody in mine I've got something somebody in my heart already I know you need a king but I've got a king after my own choosing I've got a pastor I got a leader after my own choosing to lead your lives people wanted their own they chose their own leadership a lot of years in the message is because people choose the wrong the wrong leadership to lead them and leads them the wrong way and so that translation was under the same message from Saul to David all under the same Prophet anointed by the same anointing anointed by the same prophet Samuel they chose the wrong leader and God gave them right one to lead them praise the Lord right in the middle of the prophet's message Paul's message right in the middle of him bringing the word for his age he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection so he's he's prophesying he's saying you don't get stuck in just what I'm bringing in this message you under expectations let's leave the principles which leaving does not it means to it's getting past the elementary stages of the Gospel amen leaving the doctrine of Christ it doesn't mean to get rid of it it just means we move deeper than just the elementary stages of the Gospel Perfection does not mean intellectual quote knowing all the quotes that's not what Perfection means it means your life is showing maturity and positioning of real sons and daughters of God it's Christ in you it's what Christ looks like in you what will Christ look like in your life not brother bram's not brother John's not Brother Bruce but what will what is he starting to look like in your life leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ and and and laying on of hands and emphasizing all those things let's go on to Perfection and once again Perfection is an intellectual stimulation sometimes intellectual that we know all the quotes of the Prophet no it's maturity and positioning there was a transition from John John the Baptist to Jesus he said you were willing for a season to rejoice in the light of John the Baptist but now when the May Messiah Came John said I must decrease he must increase it's a transition under the same messag and brother bandam said it this way in 1965 what is the attraction on the mountain behold I send my messenger before my face to prepare the way don't you know this fulfills prophecy prophecy was being fulfilled and about the time the prophet turned and said John the Baptist behold there comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world now what's the attraction he's actually saying the attraction changes it's not to John their baptized it's not to Elijah's Spirit he said now what's the attraction it changed from the prophet to his prophecy now we might as well be at home here today we got a lot of emphasis in our ranks that's still emphasizing the prophet I mean we read the truth but it's it's idolizing the prophet it's taking even the young people back to those days and idolizing if I can get a Bel Buckle like him and it's idolizing because people are reaching back to a comfort blanket we knew God worked through him so they reached back to that but they're not under expectation of what's coming where this message is taking us so that in their comfort blanket they reach back to idolizing a man almost deifying a man in fact they do they deify him what a shame brother Brandon would have never been for that he never would have never stood for that and yet when he's dead and gone then they make an idol out of him and it's because many times people are not changing from the emphasis and attraction to a prophet to the attraction of the prophecy and the prophecy is what's supposed to happen in you prophecy is what's happening in you amen does me no good it's dead to go back and just spend my days reading all the stories of what happened in God's life and the prophet I like to hear it it builds Faith sometimes but when I read this message when I was 16 years old I got filled with the spirit of God and with that for the Youth that's here with that change in my heart God changed my heart with that came such a incredible hunger for the word of God I watch these boys here with their notes and taking scriptures and stuff God bless you young men because may God put a deeper hunger in you for more of the word of God this world will fall apart friends will fall apart but what you're holding there in the word and listening today will hold your life together Forever and For Eternity but when I was 16 I was changed and one of the things that came with that change of the holy ghost in my heart is that incredible craving and hunger for the word of God I couldn't get enough of it and I said If God Was gracious enough to send me a prophet in my own language in my own tongue in my own generation in the 1960s I ought if God took the time and he sent the prophet I ought to take the time to hear what he said so they didn't have apps back then but they got them now it's the main app on my phone I'm listening to and following what God Said to direct us back to Bible faith in this day and he sent a prophet to do that and so but when I fed on it I didn't just see what God did in William brandham my faith Rose to now what can God do in me what can God do in my life the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever only believe all things are possible in my life what can he do in your life how could God become real to you because it's not about the prophet anymore it's about what he can do in your life John said I must decrease now he must increase Jesus said or excuse me John the Baptist says I will baptize you with repentance but when he comes it'll go deeper I'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire right that's deeper that's right he's setting them under expectation of what's next all these transitions under the same message the season changed under the same message you know you have to be in the right season with god of what he's doing in the season if you're out of season then uh you're going to miss what God's doing in this season if you're reaching to the past and trying to recreate that you can't go back to a Pentecostal age and try to recreate that you can't go back to Luther's age and just preach that you can't go back to Wesleyan age and the open door age and it's all about just one thing and Outreach you can't reach back and use that because there's more of a full message now there's you you can't try to reach back and say if we could recreate that it would work today no we take all of that plus the restoration of the word but then we're looking Where's God want to take the people today something deeper than just dedication something deeper than just praying fasting something deeper than just looking to the the the restoration of the gifts something deeper than that God wants to take us deeper can you say amen amen so um I I I think of seasons and I think of um I was thinking how cold it was this morning being out there and I remembered um we used to have a swimming pool where we lived for many years and the kids grew up in that house and they had a swimming pool and we enjoyed it in the summer they enjoyed it it was nice it was a finc in pool so it was private and they did a lot of swimming they learned how to swim and so I remember one day and my wife will remember this it was the Dead Winter freezing the the pool was covered in snow and so I got in the living room and it was warm in the house and I just say hey you guys you want to go swimming and they're just you know they're just four and five years old I said you want to go swimming and they didn't think of what season it was and so I said you guys want to go swimming and they go yeah let's go swimming let's do it and I got him more excited got them pumped up let's go swimming let's go swimming go get your suits on he went in the they went in the uh in the in their bedrooms they got all their suits on so I was waiting at the door by the pool and so they come running swimming swimming swim I open the door and let them run out there by the pool full of snow in the swimsuits and I slam the door and I lock it this is fun I just enjoyed it I didn't I didn't don't call Child Services I didn't leave them out there that long but I do have pictures of Solomon oriah standing out there going please let us in please and they didn't realize what season theyd forgot it was winter and it always reminds me of people doing things in a certain season but it's not the season for it please don't be offended that I did that to my kids it was fun at the time but I probably shouldn't have done it they're still living they survived okay but uh people are trying to push for things it would be being in the hot summer of which is hard to imagine today but you know 95 100 degrees and sitting around a a hot fire with a bonfire and drinking hot chocolate doesn't fit the season does it right but you put a nice in the today if we did a bonfire had a nice fire in our house get a little hot chocolate get around it oh that's perfect for the season you see and so spiritually people can do things out of season and not realize they're doing it push for certain things it's not the season for that and spiritually you see that happen sometimes even our own ranks where there's a push for something but it sets the people under false expectations amen that's right now we preachers we preach people under expectations that's part of our Ministries and callings but it's become ever so important to me the last few years especially that I make sure I'm in tune with what God and where he's taking the people right now because I am my gift I I'm gifted God's given me a gift but I I can preach the people under any expectations that I want that's true if I preach a certain thing emphasize a certain thing the people will come along with that and you you'll see it happen you'll see it manifested but is it the right season for it is it the emphasis you see so preachers can preach the people under false expectations and that's a tragedy because we don't want to be in this hour under false expectations we want to know what the expectations are for this hour and we want to be standing there saying I'm under expectation for this to happen in my life you see people can be misled and expecting the wrong thing and it's a crucial time when we sit in the middle of the prophecy being fulfilled of a prophet that Satan can mislead people on what's coming next I think of the end of the sermons on the the sermons on the seven seal the sermon of the Seven Seals and I don't know if you ever noticed it but in two or three places the last messages questions and answers on the seals and I believe even in the seventh seal I don't know if you caught it but after this glorious revealing of God's word and the seals taken off the book of redemption after all that powerful thing happens at the end of the the week he starts to say things like this know if you remember it if you haven't go read it which are just as important instruction as the entire seals that's right he said now don't try to interpret anything that's right don't try to interpret I wish more preachers would have listened to that because what we had is a lot of people trying to take okay what's next who's the next messenger who's the next age and they try to interpret it and they mess it up and mislead people and he's saying don't try to interpret anything God has done something here leave it alone just go to your church read your Bible be a good Christian and if God wants you to know anything he'll let you know that's the way under the to be under the right expectations something's happening I tell you friends something happened definitely a transition in 1963 when the seals were open definitely a huge transition for the bride of Christ and you see it in your Bible our lamb went to Cal 2,000 years he's the high priest we can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and then John at the end of the age he has this vision and in the vision I was going to preach on this this morning I didn't have time but in the vision at the end time what's the emphasis it becomes about a book that's sealed with Seven Seals okay the emphasis in the vision becomes a book and the book no one was worthy to look at it was our title deed it was our book of identity it's who we are in Christ amen but it was sealed with Seven Seals no one's found worthy so in the vision for the end time the emphasis is about the book of redemption so the same lamb that went up to Calvary and died for our sins where's he gone for 2,000 where he's the son of man in the midst of Candlestick he's there but now in this Vision the lamb our lamb that went to Calvary steps forth a bloody lamb and steps into this Vision because he's the only one worthy to take this book right so it's about the book and it's about Christ taking the book and when he does the worship changed the worship was incredible they come unglued because our our kinsman redeemer he's got this book in his hands it went back to the original owner now it's in the hands of our Kinsmen and he's going to tear the seals off of it and the Book of our identity is going to be revealed to us sons are going to see who they are in Christ Christ is the book and the bride is the words in the book that's a direct quote from Brother Bram Christ is the book and the bride is the words in the book so when he starts breing that which he's been doing since I believe since 1963 when he does that Sons come into manifestation CU they start to see who they are daughters start to see who they are they quit dressing like the world they quit acting like the world not because some Holiness religion told them to do it it's because they see I'm not that I'm this this is my this is my biography this is my true biography my if you had a biography already written of your life and you found out about it it's your whole life and it's your biography I I'd say you'd be curious to go buy it somebody wrote a biography of my life already and it's got all it's got the past it's got the present it's got the future I'm going to go buy that book because I'm curious about it spiritually there's already a biography been written about your life your spiritual life is in this book of redemption and as the bride begins to feed on it she starts to know and rises in power and character to realize wow praise be to God I'm not that I'm this this is who I am I can't dress like that because this is who I am you know the message brought back the integrity and the blessedness of a true woman of God and somebody told people that the message came as a woman hater Prophet to put the PE the women under bondage what a lie what a lie no it's come to restore the true Dignity of what a woman of God is how the devil took and twisted that thing I was talking to fellowship with Brother John last night at the restaurant he graciously gave me time to have a coffee with him and I was picking his brain a little bit there on some stuff and uh I was talking about my Christmas message was how that the um the scandle and the you know the time for the birth of Christ and all of a sudden now but what went out from that was Mary got pregnant Mary got pregnant out of wedlock and so now all that's the word that gets around and and that's that's not good because when you got Pharisees Sadducees the Jews one of the worst things that could happen is a girl get pregnant um and they're not even married yet her and Joseph so the the shame comes on Joseph the shame comes on Mary comes on her parents we we watch uh something called The Nativity Story it's a tradition at Christmas we watch that together I love that the way they presented the birth of Christ and Mary and it's so funny in that certain section of that movie where uh excuse me if I'm not supposed to be Pro promoting movies I I don't promote movies but good ones I promote and uh I love the section where Mary has to tell her parents and Joseph in front of him that she's pregnant and you would not believe you know her dad's going hysterical he just he don't know what to do you know uh and and uh she says something like but Elizabeth is is pregnant you know Elizabeth and her dad goes but Elizabeth has a husband you don't have a husband yet and so the the the n and so the Bible says they're all in distressed and while they they're thinking on how to fix this and Joseph's minded to put her away privately and they're trying to how do I because it's the word that's going to go out it's going to be it's going to be real embarrassing to everybody and God allows his own birth of the revealing of himself the greatest thing that hit planet Earth is going to be under a thing that's looked at from the world that way I don't understand why God does it but he did it in the birth of Christ and so while he thought on these things trying to fix it the angel appears to him in a dream and once the angel came to him say he said listen don't you be nervous what's happening is the word being fulfilled and so I was preaching on finding God in our circumstances finding God in our circumstances when the angel of the Lord comes to you he'll say don't be nervous find God being born in your circumstances because in all your circumstances for a son of God there's always something God's wanting to do in that but you have to not get blinded by the circumstances in your life you have to say Lord let me be mature let me find God in this God's doing something God's doing something with your children God's doing something this you don't know what God is doing but you you don't want to be blinded by the circumstance and the embarrassment of it it's embarrassing it was embarrassing for Joseph and and and embarrassing for Mary's parents it was the whole thing was but it's amazing to me and then I as we were fellowshipping last night look at all the reproach that goes with the message of the last days look at the package God brought this in until to today it's not accepted by scientists or the intellectual mind or denominations and never man with a seventh grade education and he begins the message that way and and even till today we're getting reported on I had a reporter at my church just a few weeks ago and she's examining all the message groups and everything there's such negative sometimes that goes around it I have to live with some of that approach but hopefully I share some positive things of what this message really is I don't know if she'll write about it most of the time they don't but I tried anyway but listen till this day we're bearing a reproach but you know what Joseph did he said you know what now that I've met the angel now that I've got a dream I know this is God's word being fulfilled I'm committed to I'm going to marry this girl and I'm going to carry this word all the way through I don't care how much persecution comes I'm going to carry this word in my heart this message is got something to it this message is the greatest revealing of Christ that's ever hit planet Earth this is not some just little thing this is the Visions bigger than anything man could do it's not William Brown's message that's right this is bigger than you or I this is this is big this is big hallelujah oh I'm having a good time this morning thank you for making me feel comfortable praise the Lord I love the word of God I love to just talk about it and fellowship around it and is so rich you know we're spiritual billionaires yes we are I don't know how much money you got today we and my me and my wife we don't have a lot but it doesn't matter we're spiritual knowing these things we're spiritual billionaires you're rich people in Christ can you say Amen so let me just move on here oh my so brother briam says in what is this Hol what is the Holy Ghost 1959 Luther walked in one light Wesley walked in another Wesley walked in one light Pentecost walked in another but we're walking on higher than the Pentecostal light today look he's not done and if there's another generation it will go beyond us so he's he's prophesying and putting us under expectation that we haven't arrived just because we come to the message of the last days or Beyond Pentecost we haven't arrived yet if there's another generation which I'm preaching to someone some of them here this morning it will go beyond us because see this is something this isn't something that just ends when God sent a Prophet this is something he's doing in sons and daughters and it's not going to end until we're in a Rapture till we're in the coming of of the Lord and so I love reading that because I know when I'm gone someday and I kick the bucket God's not gone people say that you know it's like the some big preacher and healing evangelist and boy if we could just just get him to come and lay hands on the sick and and one preacher said I don't know what we're going to do I don't know what the bride's going to do when this man goes off the scene if God takes him I don't know and I just say what what the bride's going to be fine the bride was fine before this healing evangelist came praise God that he can lay hands on and get results praise God but when he's gone and when I kick the bucket and when brother John's gone God is going to take the new generation onto the coming of the Lord there's going to be young hearts get a hold of this message on fire for God and take it on and make it even better I had one Pastor say I'm training my young men so they can take the Sheep further than what I've even taken them you don't hear a lot of old men say that but this was an old brother I said that's my vision too is that we don't know when this is going to end so we train these young men that can take the bride even further than when we've taken them I only have a certain season here to give my all but it'll be over sometime and God God will raise up another generation and they'll go beyond us so we don't want to go backwards we want to go forward how many raise your hands I want to go forward I don't want to go I want to well I'm going to be under expectations for what God has for my life I want to have joy and hope you may feel like you're you're older and you're like oh my your life's all about finished no don't think that way he might still have something to do in your life it's expectations of what God will do you know I was talking last night to Brother John about my friend and his friend brother Bill Sanchez just we were just getting ready to take him to Honduras I wanted him to see his old friends wanted to preach with him again he's my interpreter and all these years when I go to Honduras and for Brother John as well and he's got throat cancer and we've been praying and you've been praying and and he can't go on the trip but I wish he could go because he was such a good companion and every time we would run into trouble on the mission field and run into bad food or uh roaches in the motel all the things that I enjoy so much about missionary work I am not a missionary and I can tell you clearly I'm not I don't like any of it I I go and stay I have to see the golden arches within the distance of my motel that's the kind of missionary I am I don't go that often but sometimes brother Bill and I've went out because the brothers have asked to come out and every time I do it you know I used to get sick or something like that but you know he's he's amazing because he's always going hey brother and I can be sick or we can run into trouble you know it can be so hot and all these other things going on the food and and he says we go forward brother Paul we go forward and we have the D the darkest times and he's like brother Paul we go forward and it's it's a good thing we had that cuz I don't I don't want to go forward I want to get on the plane and go home but he's encouraging brother Paul glor we go forward brother we go forward and he's always doing that and and he did it one time when we come into a very poor uh place in Nicaragua very poor place and I asked them to try to get the best Motel they could uh to stay there if they could and so they say we got the best one we walk in we're in the lobby brother Bill and I'm there getting my room up there and I said brother Bill ask him if they got any problems with roaches here so he in Spanish ask the manager do they have any problem with roaches here the manager go no no no no no roaches we spray we spray yesterday we spray we spray all the roaches are gone no more roaches so no problem no problem whatsoever no worries so he's still up there getting the thing and I'm sitting in the lobby on this couch and I watch the biggest roach come across the middle of the floor in the lobby and he's he's he's going it's like he's flaunting it it's like he's dancing and looking at me going hey buddy and he's just strutting across the floor of that Lobby Brother Bruce and I say brother Bill brother Bill get the manager bring him out here look it look at this look at this roach right here you said you sprayed and the manager goes he says yeah he leaving he leaving he leaving no problem no problem he leaving the spray is him out he leaving I just and you know what brother Bill said we go forward brother we go forward in the name of the Lord didn't feel too good that day but I'll tell you I like the saying I like to stand by it I'm still standing by it no matter what happens in this message no matter what happens in your life no matter what circumstances may you may hit tomorrow we're going forward in the name of the Lord we're going forward we're under expectations of what God can do the song Brother Bruce sang had a lyric in it said here we have our disappointments right here we have our disappointments but God has a bigger vision for our lives we can't get snagged by the disappointments he can't get snagged by people who leave people people will come and go they're unstable it's an instable age unless they anchor themselves to this word they'll be gone in no time there's an instability there's a mental instability there's a emtional instability unless they get anchor to this word you'll stay emotionally in unstable there's only stability in the word of God and people will come and go I mean when we got this new building I'll share with you we got this new building and we went up in numbers and all these other things now some of those families they've left they gone and it makes you wonder what did they come for what were they coming for the music or some other thing were the question is were they coming for the word because if you're coming for the word they're not not going to be in and out jumping from church to church church but we're going to have that because of the generation we live in and we have a small little core in our church in a small little core maybe in your church that's really catching it and anchoring to this word because we can't force this on people we can't force anything on people you say why don't they get it why don't they get mine why don't they anchor and settle down I don't know why it's the age it's the time but we keep preaching it and if you got a core that's saying we go forward we're moving on with this word there'll be some join along with you but we're not looking at the disappointments we're not looking at the we're not looking at the ups and downs of people there's something anchored in our hearts can you say amen amen I hope this is ministering to you this morning Hallelujah so we're under expectations for the right thing amen there's something about said being to something to be said about expectations and longing for something and then we get nervous and try to produce something in that Abraham and Sarah with Hagar the promise was supposed to come and they got nervous Sarah got nervous maybe he meant Hagar we can really produce a lot of ishmail in our life if we're trying to produce something ourselves Hallelujah I look at the prophet um it's interesting when he talks about the many meetings that he had which were powerful but many places he'll say things like this we've had Miracles we've had things that God has had men to wait he's performed Miracles it but it never changed our country sin is on the Rampage worse than it ever was and moved right into the locks of the church and has tore it up what did our miracles do what did our healing campaigns do I believe in Divine Healing but you but you can never major on a minor divining Divine Healing is a minor we we can never major on those things the church ought to be in maturity by now and we've had rushing winds and we've had all kinds of Sensations and where the where's the church at where are we at today still more denominations growing every day and colonizing and everything and still the same men what we need is to wait till we hear the voice of God as individuals every man and every woman 1959 he says no one never knew what those Visions has caused me they're awful hard on me and if it could be just one then the rest of them would be all right but it's not but it's one it's got to be all or they just don't want to believe it what he's saying is people once they get a vision of the Lord through the prophet there's all they they want a vision they don't want to have their hands laid on them they don't want to just believe in their seat right right I want a vision from the prophet they learn to depend on that that's true and that's not maturity no you don't need a vision every day to live this word that's right you don't need a dream to live this word you have his word we have a more sure word of Prophecy Hallelujah hlj you got everything you need to go forward can you say amen and but he says people are depending on it and if it's one that's got to be all or they don't want to believe it so the church is not in its right State we have to remember it's not matured the church is not matured so we just have to linger and do the best we can and there's no one can bring it to maturity only the Holy Spirit as we listen to it I don't believe it'll ever come by man it'll have to come by God God all the time was looking for something more in individuals even in the healing revivals of the prophet he was looking for something deeper in individuals something deeper than majoring on a minor amen not a deeper knowledge but deeper in our walk in the spirit sons of God being led by the spirit of God both of these quotes I read to you and many others refer to the word maturity he's proclaiming that the expectations that we're under for the church is a maturity in Sons that's my emphasis today manifestation in Sons is happening now there's power with it but not just with you can't preach holy ghost's power without preaching Holy Ghost character and growth in character you can't just preach the power but growing into maturity you can't preach expectations of power without preaching expectations of maturity of sons hallelujah amen amen so all creation is groaning and waiting for this did you ever think if animals if they're all under expectation for the manifestation of something you ever think of if they could talk to you and they've got this groaning and exp what they could say to Sons and Daughters of God I know I think about stupid things like this but if an animal if a squirrel could talk to you today when you go home and you got your your squirrel there in the neighborhood and he comes up wonder if they could talk wonder what they would say to the bride they can't talk you know they just have a spirit they don't have a soul and they can't talk to but I wonder if they could talk if they're groaning for this manifestation of the sons of God they're waiting on this I wonder if they would you know I I don't think they're concerned about who the next president is I don't think they're about concerned about what next movie is coming out of Hollywood I don't they're not concerned about their next meal because God takes care of them they don't worry about where the next you know they're taking care of they're not what do they thinking about if they could talk they would probably say hey you guys that are the bride get your act together grow in the Lord get your act together we're waiting on you to get your act together get a hold of this word get filled with the Holy Ghost let's finish this up because we're wanting to see the restoration of all creation we want to see this Earth purged by a fire and a new millennium come and it's because sons are getting in their place oh what if animal animals can't talk uh I know what they think about I know dogs I hate dogs I don't like dogs dogs I know what dogs think about it's food all the time it's food which I can relate to that a little bit myself I can relate to that a little bit thinking about food all the time but uh dogs I I don't like dogs if you're a dog lover praise the lord and there will be dogs in heaven you have a quote for it but I just don't like them so when we get the other side just keep them on the other keep them keep them to your yard but if if if if creation if the if the if the raccoon could speak to you today I wonder if they're under groaning under these expect I wonder if they could say that to you say Hey listen get your act together and get a hold of this word this thing's about wrapped up and it all depends on you yielding yourself to God oh praise the Lord I love him don't you I think of I just will close this I think of uh Hannah being under certain expectations to have a baby Hannah uh is a special lady in the scripture because she wanted a baby and pray for my daughter she wants another child too I was just talking to brother in the back and they had a child after 16 years so I I'll tell my marah that when I get home uh and encourage her because God can still bless you with a child you know after that many years I'm not praying that for me and my wife at all we we just want grandkids we don't want but uh I'll encourage her with that but Hannah she she had she wanted to have a baby which is very much like a a mom wants and she craves to have a child but the thing about Hannah and she was she lived in Conant craving and expectation for that but she didn't wasn't catching the god part because there was a prophecy over Hannah's life that she wouldn't just be having a baby but it would be a special baby it would be a a prophet and it would fulfill the word of the Lord so when your life comes under the word of the Lord you can't just have these desires I want this I want that it has to come in tune with the will of God Amen you see and so now there was a little change I talk about a little change and I'm going to close here in just a minute but there's a little change needed in the attitude of Hannah it's not that was it was wrong that she wanted a child but she had to get her life and her expectations in line with the predestinated plan of God you see so it wasn't wrong for her to have a baby but she had to align herself and you young people listen you'd be better to get your life under the will of God right now when you're young than to wait till 30 years from now and say Lord what is your blueprint God has a blueprint for every every one of your lives God has a plan and say Lord I want to fit right into that plan show me your plan and Hannah was crazy and so as the scripture says she had uh her husband she had two wives and the other wife was having baby after baby Hannah's having nothing and she as as the other woman has all these children constantly having kids she becomes more depressed she had an oppressor the Bible says she gets more into depression she's all angry she even gets a tad angry at God she's upset and every year she's going to the temple asking for the same request I want to have a baby and she brings it every year they come to the temple every year I want to have it and she was depressed so every year she came before the congregation she's got this same request she's got the same expectation and she's she's very depressed when she sings a special nobody wants to sing hear to sing anymore because it's such a depressing special and it's the same song every year uh it's is probably called a song like woe is me cuz that's how her attitude was she was serving the lord and she was and then look at the scripture her husband comes and says what can I do to help you you know how can I get you out of this depression oh my goodness that you know I I'm your husband ain't I better than 10 Sons to you and he's saying what am I shop liver you know hey you know how about me you know but that wasn't good enough she wanted a baby you know she comes every year she sings whoo is me whoo is me wo is me cuz I don't have a baby I'm making this up as I go along depressing song and nobody wanted her to sing anymore because it's the same special it's the same depression and it brings the whole there's no revival going on it just brings the whole atmosphere down it's because of her attitude and there's just a little change needed in Hannah's attitude see it had to come in line with something deeper and that's what I'm preaching to you this morning our expectations have to come in line with God's expectations and when they do then we have joy so she came one year and you know what she God allowed her to tap into that book of redemption that book of life and she tapped in her prayer now her prayer was deeper because it tapped into the predestinated will of God now she didn't come that year and just pray for a baby she said Lord if you give me this baby notice the unselfishness notice she loses some of her unselfish her selfishness if you give me this baby I'm going to give it back to the temple and I'm going to give it back to God that was the difference it wasn't wrong with having a baby but she aligned her desire in and tap her prayer tapped into the predestinated plan of God and she said if you give it to me and then soon as she said that God looks wow she just lined herself with my plan and now I'm going to bless her now I'm going to bring what she desires amen you see so then the Bible says when she released that prayer she didn't even have the baby yet but she worshiped different when she came to the temple that day even the the priest and the the person in charge says she's acting drunk she's acting drunk she's been drinking and Hannah gets mad said I'm not drinking like you suppose but I've released this to the Lord and I believe God's going to bless she just it's like where where Hannah's back what's what's she doing she's out of her depression now praise the Lord and she almost rebukes the pastor and says I'm not drunk like you're thinking don't look at me that way but I have brought my prayer to the Lord I'm going to give that child to God and and so her attitude changed to positive and the right expectation before she even had the baby that's what's got to happen friends God help me God help me and the prayer lines most of the prayer lines brother brandham saying prays for them and said now go on your way happy and rejoicing many of them had not been healed yet but go on your way happy and rejoicing as if the work's been done CU it's our attitude about it in other words your attitude should be just as if God's already done the promise when God can see that Bo I tell you it begins to move had he writes the right attitude the right attitude about itall trigger the Holy Spirit and so Hannah comes to church after she talks to the priest and she I'd like to sing a special and everybody goes no don't don't let her sing please get somebody else don't and she said please let me sing so she gets up that year and it's not the special woe is me she's not depressed she getes I just want to testify the Lord today praise the Lord I've released this to the Lord I believe the Lord's going to give me a baby if he does it that's fine but I believe he's GNA and when he gives it to me I'm GNA give it back to the Lord and I'm here to shout and give glory to God today and everybody's going wow wow praise the Lord this is a new Hannah she's never come to church this way amen and she sings maybe every praise is to our God every word of worship in one Accord Every Praise every I don't know if you know that one but that's probably the one Hannah sang I imagine Hezekiah Walker's song every praises to her God and she starts to shout all over that building she doesn't even have a baby yet brother John but she's shouting praising God as if she has it already Hannah's attitude come under the expectations of God and she was living a better attitude didn't even have the baby yet went home got pregnant had the baby gave him back to God it happened she's rejoicing in the Lord before she has it that song every praise a a little black boy five years old I believe it was was kidnapped in Atlanta Georgia remember the story few years ago and he was kidnapped and he sang that song all day in the back of the van he was taken hostage and he sang that so every praise is to our God he sang all day until the kidnapper got so frustrated with him he took him back to the house dropped him off to the parents says take this kid off my hands I can't stand him anymore and I seen the news I seen the news the news interviewing this boy he says what did you do what did you well he told me I couldn't say anything but he didn't tell me I couldn't sing so I just sang the whole time I couldn't talk but I sang and it's how it happened praise be to God that's how they did it in the book of Acts in the jail that's how they did it in the book of Acts in the jail they just begin to sing the Praises of all Mighty God it's a change in our expectations it's a change in our attitude and that little term a little change is in the message humble thyself after the seals were preached brother Brandon was looking for a little change and he saysi just praying for a little change in my own life and he said after the seals after the seals I'm praying for a little change in my own life he said not that I'm sinning or not not that he says I just need a little change in my life he says I need to love people a little deeper I've called these guys the Ricky and retas and he said the Lord Tomo shouldn't do that he said I need to go out to them and I need to have Grace for them and love them that was the theme of it but he needed a little change you know most often us preachers are preaching on the big change and I could have preached that this morning the big change which is the rapture the big change of our bodies a lot of preachers preach on it it is a truth we're going there we're headed there but this wasn't the big change he said I just need a little change Hannah needed a little change in her attitude we need a little change in our attitude we may not be need big changes today but but we need a little change in our attitude to set us under the correct expectations of what God is going to do the future is looking so bright I got to wear sunglasses the future is looking bright for these children the future is looking bright for this congregation not not because of the circumstances or the disappointments it's because we hold God's word here and so the future looks bright because of that let's have those expectations the manifestation of the sons of God is upon us it's not coming it's it's actually now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but when he shall appear we shall be like him he's appearing right now so it's our time for the manifestation of the sons of God when he appears and we see him in All His glory and revealed in the seals the bride looks at that and they're transformed because when they see him they see themselves they see their true identity and they rise to the occasion and that sets them under expectations of where this actual this message and this word can actually take us it's Limitless it's it's an inexhaustible Fountain brother brandom called it it's not exhaustible it's Limitless in its power its character where it can take us it is the book of our identity how do I know that that book of redemption was a book of identity in our true biography because when he opened it in Revelations 5 they begin to worship not because they had power to cast out Devils but they begin to worship and say he hath made us Kings and Priests this word is making us into something this word is maturing us because we're coming to a kingdom Age and what do you need in in a true king and a true PE priest you need character nothing worse than a country having a prime minister or a king without character power without character is satanic this kingdom is going to need character to rule and Reign and we're getting that through our trials it's the book of our identity it made them into something and it corrected or it it enhanced their worship because their worship was not about the power of sons but what the word was making them which Jesus corrected his disciples CU they came back rejoicing that the Devils were were subject to them and Jesus said don't worship because the devils are subject to you but worship because your names are in this book that's the reason for worship that's the deeper purpose of worship oh I love him this morning let's stand together if you would let's just bow our heads and you raise your hand and say pray for me brother Paul that this word would be manifested more and more in my life God bless you this manifestation of the sons would come to fruition in my life this maturity this attitude this this little change that brother Brown even wanted in his own life this little change would happen in me as well and I could go forward with the word and the season he's given me to live in he didn't call me to Paul's day or Luther's day or Wesley's day he called me to live and go to school and go to work in this time in this age under these circumstances and if he put me here he'll give me the strength to be able to live the life in this particular generation Our precious Lord we just feel a solemn feeling towards you this morning and we love to rejoice and we love the stimulation of Revelation and we do feel very moved today Father I feel moved in my heart again over these subjects and these things but Lord sometimes it's just in these peaceful moments we just want to say how much we love you how much We crave for you how much more of you that we want father and somehow Lord take us in the condition we're in and take us as Brother Bruce sang to us this morning we sang together take us to Higher Ground I'm pressing on an upward Way new heights I want to be gaining every day oh God take us to Higher Ground take us to higher places take us to deeper places like now never before forgive us of our sins forgive us Lord when our attitude is like Hannah that we just want something just for ourself forgive us of that father and may we rearrange our lives every day that we're seeking to tap into that predestinated will for our lives that we're looking for Jesus to be born even amidst all the embarrassing circumstances in our past we're looking for your word to be born in our lives we pray father that you would uplift the people here at send theight that you would encourage them that you'd strengthen them Lord that you would put a fire deeper and deeper in each of them Lord for the commission you've given them in this particular

a available to them to minister to teach to to create an atmosphere for a new birth may we always continue to be available for that Lord May the fires of God continue to be in our brother John our brother Bruce and the leaders and deacons of this church and the women Lord the sisters may the fires of God burn bright I pray Lord send as the day of Pentecost like tongues of fire down upon the people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Christ oh God I pray father that a work would happen deeper than ever before I pray for it in my own church Lord may we never become just churchianity may we never become just some system Lord oh Jesus keep us from that Lord keep the fires of God in our hearts Lord God if we if we don't have everything just right on the outside may it be right on the inside Lord that's what we desire and we're thankful that you have given us this Sunday Lord to be here to join the family of God here to be able to hear your word bless every heart every man Lord
