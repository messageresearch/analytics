[39:17] 1 second Peter chapter 1 we want to talk
[39:21] you titled of the message precious
[39:24] promises and for a subject
[39:27] uh we want to try to uh look at the
[39:31] promises that the purpose that God has
[39:33] given us many of his promises is for our
[39:35] relationship with him and I I don't know
[39:39] if we really ever dove into looking at
[39:42] God's promises about our relationship
[39:46] with him to make us one with him to make
[39:48] us unified with him we have often looked
[39:52] at God's promises are there to meet our
[39:54] needs to help us and uh I want to just
[39:59] dive in uh to the scriptures take our
[40:03] time it wasn't our original our thought
[40:06] here but um we want to just rightly
[40:09] divide the word of Truth amen right down
[40:12] the the middle of the road let's let's
[40:14] bow our our hearts in in a word of
[40:16] prayer and then we'll read two verses
[40:19] here our heavenly
[40:23] father Lord as we stand before you
[40:27] we know Lord that without you we can do
[40:31] nothing it was your grace that God us
[40:33] had a bed this
[40:35] morning it was your
[40:38] grace uh in our hearts that said I I I
[40:42] want to be in the house of the Lord
[40:44] today it was your grace that gave us the
[40:46] health to get here and the desire to
[40:49] come in here and praise you with our
[40:51] brothers and
[40:52] sisters father it is your grace that has
[40:56] touched our two sisters that we could
[40:58] hear this
[40:59] report father we just thank you for your
[41:02] Amazing Grace this morning and we pray
[41:04] that it would just continue to abound
[41:08] here in our midst and in our hearts and
[41:11] our lives and that Lord we could draw
[41:13] closer to you that's why we've come to
[41:15] draw closer to you Lord you're going to
[41:18] show us how to do that your Prophet said
[41:20] we've come to find out where we stand
[41:22] with you Lord but Lord you don't just
[41:24] leave us where we stand with you you
[41:26] show us how we can draw even closer to
[41:29] you we thank you for this come and bless
[41:32] the reading of the word the scriptures
[41:35] Lord may they just come alive to us only
[41:37] you can do that we just commit it all to
[41:41] you Lord we trust in you for all things
[41:44] now in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[41:47] amen
[41:49] amen second Peter chapter 1 starting
[41:53] with verse number
[41:55] three
[41:56] according as his divine
[41:59] power have given unto us all things that
[42:04] pertaineth unto life and godliness
[42:06] through the knowledge of him that have
[42:07] called us to glory and
[42:10] virtue whereby are given unto us
[42:14] exceeding great and precious promises
[42:19] that by these ye might be partakers of
[42:22] the divine nature having escaped the
[42:25] corruption that is in the world through
[42:28] lust God bless you may be seated may may
[42:31] God just come and make this more real to
[42:34] us is our prayer some of God's promises
[42:38] are
[42:40] unconditional like God loves
[42:43] you unconditional when Satan came to
[42:46] brother brandham after he lost his wife
[42:48] and his daughter and beating him up and
[42:51] say God you know is upset with you and
[42:54] forsaken you and and and and and when
[42:57] the devil said that God don't love you
[42:59] anymore was at that time that brother
[43:01] Bram could recognize that the it was the
[43:03] devil speaking to him because he knew
[43:06] that God loved him unconditionally so
[43:08] it's an unconditional promise and God
[43:11] paid the price for every human being on
[43:14] the planet at
[43:16] Calvary that's right that's right
[43:18] Calvary paid uh John 3:16 for God so
[43:21] loved the world that he gave himself
[43:23] just unconditionally he gave himself for
[43:25] the world Amen
[43:27] another unconditional promise is that
[43:29] God cannot
[43:31] lie he cannot fail it's unconditional
[43:34] you you there's nothing that you can do
[43:36] is it's always going to be that way
[43:38] unconditional promises that Jesus Christ
[43:40] is the same yesterday today and forever
[43:42] it's just
[43:43] unconditional nothing changes
[43:46] it some of God's promises can bless our
[43:50] lives naturally and some bless us
[43:53] spiritually in either case
[43:56] many Believers miss that a lot of God's
[44:00] promises are conditional
[44:02] promises right and that there's needs
[44:05] that have to be certain terms or
[44:07] conditions that have to be met to
[44:09] believe
[44:11] them uh it is true that alls we have to
[44:15] do is believe all things are possible to
[44:17] him that believeth but the thing is what
[44:20] is going to give you that Faith to
[44:22] believe there's certain terms and
[44:24] conditions and we've heard
[44:26] uh uh we've heard before that it's more
[44:29] important to know why you're sick than
[44:31] to get healed purposes and things maybe
[44:34] God we've heard you know ministers come
[44:36] and they say that sometimes God has
[44:38] allowed sicknesses on
[44:40] people that's true and so there's just
[44:43] more to it than just grab this this
[44:46] promise and and and claim it you know
[44:48] I'm going to be so prosperous I'm going
[44:50] to be a millionaire I'm just going to
[44:51] claim
[44:52] it well there's more to it than that
[44:55] let's let's take a look at some let's
[44:57] look at uh Psalms 122 today I this
[45:02] wasn't in my noes but in the light of
[45:04] what's happened in Israel I want to be
[45:07] reminded uh of this Psalms 122:6 says
[45:11] pray for the Peace of Jerusalem
[45:15] amen they shall prosper that love thee
[45:20] you don't pray you don't love you don't
[45:23] have the promise of
[45:24] prosperity amen
[45:27] is that right now look what it says
[45:29] peace be within thy walls and prosperity
[45:33] within thy
[45:35] palaces for my brethren and my companion
[45:40] sake I will now say peace be within thee
[45:45] there are brothers there they just don't
[45:48] know it
[45:49] yet but see you know we're told to pray
[45:53] but then God says if you pray you get
[45:54] blessed amen right there's like a
[45:57] condition and many of God's promises are
[46:00] like that if we take the promise in all
[46:02] thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall
[46:05] direct thy paths we all know that
[46:06] scripture
[46:07] right now there there's times that we
[46:10] use this scriptural promise is when
[46:13] we're wanting God to show us his will
[46:15] about
[46:17] something is that true and there's like
[46:20] certain thing and and we're reminded of
[46:22] the scripture and we're going to go to
[46:23] the scripture and say God what do you
[46:25] want me to do with this would you direct
[46:26] my path with this the word doesn't say
[46:30] in whatever way you acknowledge Him He
[46:32] Shall direct you that's not what the
[46:33] scripture
[46:35] says but Believers will just take the
[46:38] scripture and they'll use it the way
[46:39] they want to the promise is in all thy
[46:43] ways acknowledge Him in other words get
[46:47] your life involved with God in all your
[46:50] ways let him be the Lord of all that's
[46:53] what's happening don't just come to him
[46:54] when you got this certain need and God I
[46:57] need direction over here about this
[46:58] certain thing and I'm coming to you
[47:00] because you know you're going to direct
[47:02] me it's it's it's like using God the
[47:05] promises that go God uses promises to
[47:09] draw a relationship with his
[47:11] children he's interested in long-term uh
[47:15] uh uh he wants to be with us eternally
[47:18] sometimes we look to God's promise
[47:19] because we got this need we get this
[47:21] need me we just kind of forget remember
[47:23] there were 10 lepers nine of them did
[47:26] not come back to give thanks to give God
[47:30] glory but one
[47:32] did and I just I I just want us to look
[47:35] at God's
[47:37] promises in In a Different Light because
[47:41] the scripture tells us that by these
[47:44] exceeding great and precious promises we
[47:47] might be partakers of the divine nature
[47:52] right divine
[47:54] nature not that are light bill gets
[47:57] paid a a and not that we just get healed
[48:00] although when God heals you is his
[48:02] divine nature that does it but brother
[48:05] bom says you know we're going to get
[48:07] healed we're going to die of something
[48:08] someday but when that soul that soul
[48:12] grows in the character of God that does
[48:15] not die
[48:16] anymore and that's what God is
[48:18] interested
[48:20] in God has always been interested in
[48:24] relationships
[48:27] God loves everybody he he even heals his
[48:30] enemies but ultimately he's interested
[48:33] in a deep relationship with
[48:36] us so we want to pay attention to God's
[48:40] conditions terms you you all of us have
[48:45] have purchased
[48:46] something and we just got our our floor
[48:49] put in the greenhouse and they got these
[48:51] terms and these conditions you know you
[48:54] want to uh have an extended warranty you
[48:57] got certain terms and conditions you got
[48:59] to register your product you got to put
[49:01] the name here's the receipt here's what
[49:03] I bought this is where I bought it from
[49:06] terms and conditions God has terms and
[49:09] conditions he's no
[49:13] different in all thy ways acknowledge
[49:15] Him He Shall direct thy paths and the
[49:17] condition terms here there's some
[49:20] there's some scriptures right before
[49:22] this verse and after that helps us see
[49:25] the terms the
[49:27] conditions the Bible says trust in the
[49:30] Lord with all thine heart and lean not
[49:32] to thy own
[49:35] understanding similar to the verse right
[49:37] after be not wise in your own eyes fear
[49:40] the lord and depart from your
[49:43] ways because our ways are evil my ways
[49:47] are evil
[49:49] amen if if I'm doing something that is
[49:52] not evil it is not my way it is God's
[49:54] way it's just all there is to it I'm not
[49:57] going to take credit for God I'm not
[49:59] going to take credit for God's goodness
[50:02] I'm going to take credit I'm going to
[50:03] take credit for my bone head
[50:07] nature so we see the conditions you
[50:09] can't just you know lean to your own
[50:12] understanding trust in
[50:14] yourself and then expect God to lead you
[50:17] he just he doesn't want that he doesn't
[50:19] he doesn't want to share his glory with
[50:21] us in that in that carnal
[50:23] nature let's look at the fifth God's
[50:27] fifth commandment it's a natural promise
[50:29] yet there's a condition honor thy father
[50:31] and thy mother that thy days may be long
[50:34] upon the land which the Lord thy God
[50:37] giveth thee long life appeals to all of
[50:42] us we all want to live can you say Amen
[50:45] you want to live a little bit longer
[50:46] than you are living today well God gives
[50:49] us a condition here honor thy father and
[50:53] thy mother that's right he never said
[50:56] honor your father and mother if you
[50:58] agree with them if they were good to you
[51:00] if they gave you what you
[51:05] want now there's other Commandments that
[51:08] don't seem as appealing like remember
[51:10] the Sabbath to keep it
[51:12] holy that's not his
[51:15] feeling Thou shalt not do any work thou
[51:19] nor thy son nor thy daughter thy man
[51:21] servant nor thy maid servant nor the
[51:24] cattle and the stranger that is within
[51:27] thy
[51:28] gates in other words working on the
[51:30] Sabbath is an
[51:31] Unholy thing think about
[51:36] that now God will permit it he certainly
[51:40] will in fact you can operate in God's
[51:43] permissive will just
[51:46] fine sometimes you can function in it
[51:50] you can survive in it you can even
[51:53] prosper in it naturally that's true
[51:56] but you'll never Prosper
[51:58] spiritually you just can't why is God
[52:01] going to bless you for going out of his
[52:04] word are you with
[52:08] me many of God's promises are
[52:12] conditional on Sunday the Bible says
[52:15] bring all your tithes into the
[52:17] storehouse that there may be meat in my
[52:21] house and prove me now here with sayith
[52:25] the Lord of hosts if I will not open the
[52:27] windows of heaven and pour out a
[52:30] blessing that there shall not even be
[52:32] room enough to receive
[52:36] it not everyone pays
[52:39] ties some do some
[52:42] don't now I believe that God can provide
[52:46] spiritual food for one
[52:48] person and not another out of the same
[52:54] message God is the one that opens the
[52:56] eyes God's the one that blesses people
[52:58] spiritually but not only spiritually
[53:02] this blessing is
[53:04] also natural you can be blessed
[53:08] naturally for this obedience to the
[53:15] Lord so sometimes the conditions are
[53:17] naturally and he pays you He blesses you
[53:21] spiritually with spiritual Revelation
[53:23] spiritual food and due season uh I'll
[53:25] tell you I I don't want to close the
[53:27] doors of
[53:29] Heaven I want those wide
[53:33] open I want to prove the Lord amen
[53:37] because he told me come prove him right
[53:40] it's got to be done personally not
[53:42] collectively because you don't have the
[53:45] same heart condition Vision Revelation
[53:48] that somebody else does so it's up to
[53:52] you but see the condition are you with
[53:55] me
[53:56] Proverbs 3:9 honor the Lord with thy
[53:59] substance and with the first fruit of
[54:01] all thine
[54:05] increase so shall thy bars be filled
[54:08] with plenty and thy pressence shall
[54:10] burst out with new wine stimulation from
[54:13] the father's Revelation by following the
[54:17] natural you think it doesn't have
[54:19] anything to do your spiritual what
[54:21] doesn't have anything to do with your
[54:23] yes because there's a relationship
[54:25] involved and it's you being obedient to
[54:27] what God wants you to do
[54:30] amen sounds like God has a perfect will
[54:34] and He blesses the man that walks in
[54:37] it now too often we try to prosper on
[54:41] our
[54:42] terms instead of God's we try to serve
[54:46] God on our terms instead of his we'll
[54:50] even try to defeat the devil on our
[54:53] terms instead of
[54:56] gods and we're going to see in the next
[55:00] I don't know how many services here as
[55:02] we go through these but God's terms are
[55:04] the only terms for the
[55:06] believer
[55:08] amen it's a it's
[55:12] a you know I
[55:15] personally I don't even want God to
[55:17] bless me if it is not his
[55:20] will I don't want him to smile upon me I
[55:23] don't want him to give me anything I
[55:25] don't want him to bless me in any
[55:27] fashion form way if he doesn't want to I
[55:31] know that everything that God does is
[55:33] good
[55:34] everything but if there's something I'm
[55:36] not pleasing him with doing something
[55:38] I'm not paying attention I'm ignoring
[55:40] this and he's he's wanting to get my
[55:42] attention he's wanting to give me more
[55:43] character in my life I want that more
[55:47] than I want anything that I
[55:49] want and and and we've got to remember
[55:52] that a lot of times we just struggle why
[55:54] isn't God doing doing this for me and
[55:55] why isn't that and this is what the word
[55:57] says and we should have this and you
[55:59] know maybe we need to pay attention to
[56:02] the terms and
[56:04] conditions maybe there's something more
[56:06] that we're missing because we've always
[56:08] got it figured
[56:11] out let's say we have a need doesn't
[56:14] seem like the needs being met you ever
[56:15] been in that
[56:17] position how about the rest of you you
[56:20] need didn't eat your weedies lift up
[56:22] your
[56:23] hands we've all been there let's say we
[56:28] we have this need that we really want to
[56:29] feel God's
[56:31] presence want to feel his Joy want to
[56:33] feel his
[56:35] love some direction for our life and we
[56:37] want to get God's attention hey Lord
[56:41] look at me I need you
[56:49] right if you don't want anything to get
[56:52] in your
[56:53] way
[56:55] what are his terms number one you must
[56:59] believe that you can have
[57:02] it that's number one if you're going
[57:06] doubting I'm not gonna probably not
[57:08] gonna he's not not GNA find favor with
[57:11] them had didn't happen before it's not
[57:13] going to
[57:14] work you have to have
[57:16] faith without this confidence that you
[57:20] can have
[57:23] it how can you please the one that
[57:26] you're looking to get attention from
[57:28] because without faith you can't please
[57:30] him so you want attention you want God
[57:33] to look down on you favorably but you're
[57:35] not going to believe he's going to do it
[57:38] see that don't work you've got to have
[57:40] confidence that he's going to come
[57:42] through for
[57:44] you got
[57:47] to so we always must remember every
[57:51] promise of God requires Faith do you
[57:55] believe
[57:56] that except the ones that bring
[58:03] judgment are you with me this we're
[58:06] we're we're this is not Evangelistic
[58:08] message we are gonna we're going to
[58:10] learn about the Bible
[58:12] today all right look at Matthew 16:14
[58:16] Matthew I'm sorry Matthew 6:14 Jesus
[58:19] said for if you forgive men their
[58:22] trespasses your heavenly father will
[58:25] also forgive
[58:26] you see the condition there forgiveness
[58:29] comes with God's terms this is not your
[58:33] terms this is God's terms if you want
[58:36] forgiveness you've got to learn to
[58:38] forgive others amen it's just all there
[58:41] is to it there's no
[58:42] exceptions it's a condition and we need
[58:45] faith in the precious promise of God
[58:49] which is I know that if I forgive then I
[58:53] can have confidence
[58:55] that God will forgive me there's your
[58:58] faith and now let's look at the next
[59:00] verse but if you forgive not men their
[59:03] trespasses neither will your heavenly
[59:05] father forgive your trespasses now
[59:08] here's the promise here you don't need
[59:10] faith for it oh yeah I don't you know
[59:12] God's for you know like I don't really
[59:16] care what that that that says because
[59:18] God knows how much they wronged
[59:20] me and I'm trying to live a good life
[59:25] and God knows I'm better than
[59:28] them whatever you justify and however
[59:30] you justify it you don't have to have
[59:33] faith in that promise but it will come
[59:35] to pass see because that's what judgment
[59:38] is about you don't have to have faith
[59:40] for judgment you just have to have faith
[59:43] for the for the for the blessings and
[59:46] and the the the the the character that
[59:48] that God wants to give you the Oneness
[59:50] with him the the overcoming power you
[59:53] have to have faith for these
[59:56] things I hope you can see what I'm
[59:58] saying now if youve have if you're
[1:00:00] having a hard time entering in I say get
[1:00:03] behind me
[1:00:05] devil because this is this is a good
[1:00:08] word this is a good word this will help
[1:00:10] you
[1:00:11] spiritually
[1:00:15] amen Jesus said as as I said all things
[1:00:19] are possible to them that
[1:00:21] believeth but does this problem mean if
[1:00:24] I can believe for forgiveness without
[1:00:26] forgiving others then I'll be
[1:00:31] forgiven see so all things are not
[1:00:36] possible because God will never give you
[1:00:39] the faith for
[1:00:41] that faith comes from
[1:00:43] God he's not going to give you Faith to
[1:00:46] be forgiven if you haven't forgiven
[1:00:49] somebody you're Crossing his terms his
[1:00:53] conditions
[1:00:55] so we don't want to try to muster up
[1:00:57] Faith for something that just ain't
[1:00:59] going to happen until we meet the
[1:01:02] conditions are you with me he's teaching
[1:01:06] us that God's not going to give us Faith
[1:01:09] until not going to give us confidence
[1:01:11] not going to give us Faith until we
[1:01:13] fulfilled his word all right 1 John
[1:01:16] chapter 3:20 I want to drive this home
[1:01:18] so we can understand this and get
[1:01:21] this 1 John 3:20 says for if our hearts
[1:01:25] condemn
[1:01:26] us God is greater than our heart and he
[1:01:29] knoweth all things did not Jesus say
[1:01:32] when you come up to the Altar and you
[1:01:34] pray and there you
[1:01:38] remember that someone has ought against
[1:01:43] you leave your gift there go to that
[1:01:49] person and make
[1:01:51] things
[1:01:53] right and then come back to the Altar
[1:01:57] and offer your gift to
[1:02:00] me so God is not going to flood you with
[1:02:04] faith here and confidence here if he
[1:02:07] wants you to go take care of something
[1:02:10] first see we have such
[1:02:14] individual we think we have these
[1:02:16] personal Walks With God that is just
[1:02:19] between me and him and it doesn't matter
[1:02:22] if I cross the word or not that's
[1:02:27] right the only thing that's personal is
[1:02:29] are you lining up with the word or you
[1:02:31] like the others who are
[1:02:34] not that's that's what's you're either
[1:02:37] personally being obedient or personally
[1:02:39] being
[1:02:40] disobedient are you with me I love this
[1:02:43] word I'm just gonna say Amen because I
[1:02:45] love the word if I was sitting there and
[1:02:47] I was hearing somebody preach the word I
[1:02:48] would be saying amen and I know you must
[1:02:50] have had a bad day bad night something
[1:02:52] must have not went right for you but I'm
[1:02:54] just telling you get into the word
[1:02:55] because the word's got life in it
[1:02:59] life all right verse 21 beloved if our
[1:03:02] hearts condemn us
[1:03:04] not then we have confidence towards God
[1:03:09] that's right did you ever get in a fight
[1:03:11] with your wife or you wives did you ever
[1:03:14] get in a fight with your
[1:03:17] husband and you
[1:03:20] knew when it was time to pray that you
[1:03:23] felt uncomfort able about praying you
[1:03:26] didn't even feel like praying for the
[1:03:28] meal you were hoping that somehow the
[1:03:31] prayer would bypass
[1:03:35] you something just inside said you need
[1:03:38] to get that thing
[1:03:41] right but once you say
[1:03:45] sorry now you can have
[1:03:48] confidence that's what I love about our
[1:03:50] God we we serve a God who has the
[1:03:52] ability to speak to our hearts heart and
[1:03:54] let us to know where we're standing with
[1:03:57] him have we met his conditions because
[1:04:00] if we meet his conditions then we can
[1:04:02] have
[1:04:04] faith all things are possible to him
[1:04:06] that
[1:04:08] believeth all right verse 22 and
[1:04:11] whatsoever we ask we receive of him why
[1:04:16] why why
[1:04:17] because we keep his Commandments and we
[1:04:22] do those things that are pleasing in his
[1:04:26] sight it doesn't say we just don't go
[1:04:29] murder we don't go rob banks we don't
[1:04:32] steal from the waitress that's not what
[1:04:35] it's saying it means we do the things
[1:04:38] that please them right and and too often
[1:04:41] we want to make the scriptures sound
[1:04:43] different so we can just go ahead and
[1:04:44] live our personal life that's right our
[1:04:48] life belongs to God we're not our own we
[1:04:50] need to please God in the decisions we
[1:04:52] make everything
[1:04:54] you know a Believer can get so far from
[1:04:56] God they don't even know they're not
[1:04:58] walking with
[1:05:01] God Lord help
[1:05:06] us we know the rain falls on the just
[1:05:09] and the
[1:05:10] unjust we know God is good to his
[1:05:14] enemies I believe God has healed people
[1:05:17] he has delivered people he has blessed
[1:05:20] people and those same people have walked
[1:05:22] away from God
[1:05:25] amen look God isn't regretting what he's
[1:05:29] done because he's just that's his nature
[1:05:34] amen he gives he's good he knows the
[1:05:38] majority of the people don't appreciate
[1:05:42] him come on Paul said I became all
[1:05:45] things to all men he knew he wasn't
[1:05:47] going to win them
[1:05:49] all he used the word
[1:05:53] some you become Christ to all but you
[1:05:56] only win
[1:05:57] some it's okay you still are Christ
[1:06:01] everybody that's God's
[1:06:04] nature now God is not looking just to
[1:06:08] bless somebody
[1:06:10] temporarily he has something else in
[1:06:13] mind because those people that turn away
[1:06:15] he he's not going to spend eternity with
[1:06:17] them they they've rejected him many will
[1:06:20] come to me in that day God is looking
[1:06:23] for our just say it like this God is
[1:06:25] looking for Eternal
[1:06:27] relationships Eternal relationships
[1:06:29] that's it but we don't have to wait to
[1:06:32] get to heaven to have our Eternal
[1:06:36] relationship in fact we need to get what
[1:06:38] we need
[1:06:41] now
[1:06:42] character hey look if we don't need
[1:06:45] character what is you know what do we
[1:06:47] need to go through trials
[1:06:48] for why do we need to hear God's trying
[1:06:51] to build character if we don't need
[1:06:53] it
[1:06:55] you know I don't think God just wanted
[1:06:57] me to have character so I can you know
[1:06:58] be nicer to my wife i' be nicer to my
[1:07:01] employees just so I open the door at the
[1:07:03] church and let somebody go in no God is
[1:07:06] looking for someone he wants to be with
[1:07:10] just like him throughout
[1:07:12] eternity so we we we just have to be
[1:07:14] serious about the terms and the
[1:07:16] conditions that God has for
[1:07:19] us now why are so many God's promises
[1:07:23] conditional
[1:07:28] do I have to start calling their
[1:07:31] names because just simply God wants
[1:07:33] something out of it why would you make a
[1:07:38] condition why why would you tell your
[1:07:40] children yeah you can go play when your
[1:07:42] bedroom's cleaned when the garbage up
[1:07:44] when the dishes are done why do you make
[1:07:47] conditions yes you can use the car but
[1:07:49] just make sure it's filled with gas when
[1:07:50] you bring it back conditions why do you
[1:07:52] want conditions you want something out
[1:07:54] of the
[1:07:55] deal God wants something out of
[1:08:00] me and he deserves more than I'm giving
[1:08:02] him by the way uh he hasn't come short
[1:08:07] on the deal I've I'm the one that I'm
[1:08:10] the one that's coming up short of giving
[1:08:12] in this
[1:08:14] relationship too often Believers are
[1:08:17] after something from God without
[1:08:20] thinking about the
[1:08:22] relationship
[1:08:24] now at at the be at the beginning of all
[1:08:28] I'll just say it like
[1:08:29] this we were taught by the
[1:08:32] prophet that
[1:08:35] his that God gave him a a gift and he
[1:08:38] had the gift of of
[1:08:40] healing and it attracted a lot of people
[1:08:43] and we were taught by the message that
[1:08:46] that healing um it it's a bait on the
[1:08:49] hook it it was to to show people that
[1:08:53] God is alive he's the same yesterday
[1:08:56] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:08:58] forever what he's done for others he
[1:08:59] could do for you God is alive he's
[1:09:05] real but that is not all God wanted to
[1:09:09] get across to
[1:09:11] us he wants a a relationship which his
[1:09:16] word can be impregnated in the
[1:09:18] believer's heart and they can begin to
[1:09:20] manifest his character amen amen now
[1:09:23] that is what the his end game is what
[1:09:26] he's looking for he prayed Jesus prayed
[1:09:28] when he prayed to the father that make
[1:09:30] us one make them one as we are one
[1:09:33] father that same Oneness that same um I
[1:09:38] am here to do the will of the father not
[1:09:41] here to do my own will to get my own
[1:09:43] thing to use God for what I can get out
[1:09:45] of him it's not about
[1:09:50] that I believe we could have many more
[1:09:53] promises manifested in our life in our
[1:09:55] church if we come to the terms of God's
[1:09:59] word and and I understand all you got to
[1:10:02] do believe believe believe get people to
[1:10:04] believe I believe that I do and I I also
[1:10:09] know that God at the beginning of
[1:10:13] anybody's life will make things so
[1:10:15] simple to see the
[1:10:17] manifestation he really
[1:10:22] will but when it comes
[1:10:25] to building the
[1:10:28] relationship now there's things that he
[1:10:30] expects out of
[1:10:33] us
[1:10:35] and it's up to us individually to say
[1:10:39] Lord where do I stand with you what is
[1:10:41] it that you'd have me to do amen I'm
[1:10:44] trying to believe I'm coming to church
[1:10:47] I'm hearing you word I I I believe that
[1:10:49] you s it's not believing intellectually
[1:10:51] God sent a prophet just saying I'm in
[1:10:53] the message intellectually it's not it
[1:10:56] it's really hearing from God what God
[1:10:59] wants you to do am I can't give you that
[1:11:03] know we can sit here in church and we
[1:11:04] can hear the word being preached but
[1:11:07] everything that I'm I'm saying is not
[1:11:10] directly directed towards
[1:11:12] you it's a general truth but you've got
[1:11:16] to hear the voice of God personally for
[1:11:18] you you've got to better leave here with
[1:11:20] the message that God
[1:11:21] is has for you and then you leave here
[1:11:24] and you carry it out you know to come in
[1:11:26] here and hear the church and say you
[1:11:28] know that was a good sermon I don't care
[1:11:29] if it's a good sermon I really don't
[1:11:31] care if it's a good sermon what I do
[1:11:33] care about is you heard from God you're
[1:11:35] going to walk in obedience when you
[1:11:37] leave here and God's going to bless you
[1:11:39] for it and if we could just repeat that
[1:11:42] Wednesday Sunday Wednesday Sunday that's
[1:11:44] growing in the Lord
[1:11:49] amen always keep in mind God's wanting
[1:11:52] to
[1:11:54] to mold Us in His image to build the
[1:11:56] character that needs to be seen in
[1:11:59] us no God is not interested in just
[1:12:01] handing out power to
[1:12:04] us without
[1:12:06] character remember
[1:12:09] that power without character is satanic
[1:12:12] he's not interested in just giving power
[1:12:14] out if there's no character you know
[1:12:16] we're looking for this power to do this
[1:12:18] power to do that power power power God
[1:12:21] is looking for character character
[1:12:23] character
[1:12:24] amen at the beginning he sent them out
[1:12:28] and gave them all
[1:12:30] power to do
[1:12:33] everything and after their power they
[1:12:36] wanted to cast fire down where they
[1:12:38] shouldn't have been casting fire
[1:12:40] down they were talking about how who was
[1:12:43] the greatest among them with this
[1:12:45] power well this this this is not the
[1:12:49] character of God it's not the humility
[1:12:51] of God it's not the love of God so God
[1:12:53] doesn't want to hand out power where
[1:12:55] there's no character so we really need
[1:12:57] to pay attention about the
[1:13:00] terms terms and conditions this is terms
[1:13:03] and
[1:13:12] conditions we know we can go to church
[1:13:14] and feel God's presence all around us
[1:13:17] God is good we know we can we can go to
[1:13:21] another church service and feel so good
[1:13:24] about the service feel God's presence I
[1:13:27] ask you a question what happens the day
[1:13:30] later what happens three days later what
[1:13:33] happens a week
[1:13:34] later where is that
[1:13:36] presence where is that that feeling that
[1:13:39] you were
[1:13:43] feeling if you want God's presence more
[1:13:46] if you really want an audience with God
[1:13:48] you want him there all the time God may
[1:13:52] be requiring
[1:13:57] humility talking about terms and
[1:13:59] conditions
[1:14:01] now at the beginning he may you know he
[1:14:04] said he pour out his Spirit upon All
[1:14:08] Flesh but now you're wanting it more
[1:14:11] okay you like what you feel you like
[1:14:14] that goodness that you're feeling you've
[1:14:16] tasted that the Lord is good okay now I
[1:14:19] have some terms and conditions for
[1:14:21] you it's it's
[1:14:24] understanding the nature of our heavenly
[1:14:26] father amen I mean every child if I was
[1:14:29] to ask brother
[1:14:30] Gabe Hey Brother
[1:14:33] Gabe if I was to ask brother Gabe
[1:14:36] brother
[1:14:37] Gabe do you really do you recognize that
[1:14:41] your mom and dad ever asked you to do
[1:14:43] anything the answer is yes now if you
[1:14:46] willingly just ignore it what happens to
[1:14:50] you
[1:14:52] discipline amen or maybe you don't get a
[1:14:55] certain benefit but if you do that which
[1:14:57] your parents ask you to do then you get
[1:15:01] more and it it never stops eventually
[1:15:05] you're going to be
[1:15:06] driving eventually you're G to you're
[1:15:09] going to get this big job and you're
[1:15:10] going to bring home the paycheck and
[1:15:12] you're going to hand it over to
[1:15:17] them God is not interested in just where
[1:15:21] we're
[1:15:22] at he has a long-term goal he an
[1:15:24] expected end for us right and he's
[1:15:27] trying to get us there and so understand
[1:15:31] that he he's the things that we want
[1:15:34] from God are are good they're all right
[1:15:36] but let's find out the condition what is
[1:15:38] it Lord that you want so he might be
[1:15:41] requiring
[1:15:43] humility God actually resists any kind
[1:15:46] of Pride or arrogancy any any hoty
[1:15:50] Spirit if you got one ounce just 1
[1:15:54] ounce I got on the scale this morning
[1:15:56] and I was 175 if just 1
[1:16:01] ounce of that
[1:16:03] 175 pounds is pride get rid of it am get
[1:16:08] rid of it don't just say well the
[1:16:10] majority of me is humble get rid of
[1:16:15] it bring God the sacrifice of
[1:16:19] humility and respect amen that's what
[1:16:23] you come to church with you don't just
[1:16:26] come any old way and expect God to just
[1:16:30] bless you God don't owe anything to
[1:16:35] us we got to meet terms and conditions
[1:16:38] Psalms 51: 17 says the sacrifices of God
[1:16:42] are a broken Spirit a broken and
[1:16:46] contrite heart oh God thou will not
[1:16:52] despise amen terms and
[1:16:57] conditions you like ah don't want to
[1:17:00] read the fine print I'm just coming to
[1:17:03] church and you want God to you want an
[1:17:05] audience with God but you're not worried
[1:17:07] about the the the the the terms and
[1:17:10] conditions of of having a right Spirit
[1:17:12] right being prepared in your
[1:17:15] heart see I believe we're missing out on
[1:17:19] the on the blessings of God because
[1:17:21] we're not paying attention to the fine
[1:17:24] print we're ignoring the things that are
[1:17:26] important to God because they have to do
[1:17:28] with our character they have to do with
[1:17:30] our long-term relationship I'll be
[1:17:32] honest with you anybody anybody here if
[1:17:35] you spend enough time with a hoty
[1:17:37] arrogant person you want to leave their
[1:17:40] presence as quick as possible can you
[1:17:42] say Amen to that like you've had your F
[1:17:45] I'm done with it see you later
[1:17:47] adios and you just want to get away from
[1:17:50] that thing what do you think God just
[1:17:53] going to put his arm around that and say
[1:17:55] yeah I love to be with that yeah I'm
[1:17:57] glad that you're here filling my house
[1:17:59] with your arrogancy
[1:18:01] no terms and
[1:18:04] conditions he'll despise you if you come
[1:18:07] with
[1:18:09] that and you that may not be your nature
[1:18:12] that's not what I'm saying here what I
[1:18:13] am saying is that Spirit can get on
[1:18:16] you and so what you got to do if you
[1:18:19] really want an audience with you really
[1:18:21] mean business with God you're desperate
[1:18:23] for God a broken and contrite
[1:18:27] spirit and keep it on
[1:18:30] you keep it on you don't don't turn it
[1:18:33] on and off like a some some some like
[1:18:37] the Pharisees the Pharisees you know
[1:18:38] they dressed up a certain way their
[1:18:40] outside countenance was just you know
[1:18:43] presenting themselves as something but
[1:18:45] inside the life wasn't there inside they
[1:18:49] didn't have that humble and contriteness
[1:18:51] amen
[1:18:54] terms and
[1:18:55] conditions let's say you want the devil
[1:18:58] off your back you're trying to get the
[1:18:59] devil off your back how many's ever been
[1:19:00] in that
[1:19:02] situation all right all right well in
[1:19:05] order to get the devil uh under your
[1:19:09] feet the first thing you got to do is
[1:19:12] get your will under your
[1:19:14] feet we never think about that what we
[1:19:17] think about is that devil get devil get
[1:19:20] up I'm so get out of here devil
[1:19:23] and then you still want to do your
[1:19:27] will that's not what the vine print says
[1:19:30] we don't defeat the devil on our
[1:19:34] terms we defeat the devil on God's terms
[1:19:38] we don't use our name to cast out
[1:19:40] Devils we don't use our will to cast out
[1:19:44] Devils we use God's
[1:19:48] name in my name you shall cast out
[1:19:51] Devils there is only one
[1:19:53] Authority that is over the devil and
[1:19:56] that's
[1:19:57] God and when you submit to God you're
[1:20:01] you have authority over the devil but if
[1:20:03] you don't submit to God don't let
[1:20:06] somebody try to tell you well you just
[1:20:07] take the name of Jesus and you get rid
[1:20:09] of excuse me excuse me Paul I know Jesus
[1:20:15] I know but who are
[1:20:19] you you know we're we're trying to make
[1:20:21] the gospel fit our
[1:20:24] life we need to get our life to fit the
[1:20:32] gospel all right I
[1:20:35] decided I wrestled for like three
[1:20:38] days am I just going to try to get this
[1:20:40] done in one service and maybe I'll go an
[1:20:42] extra 15 minutes and I'll just fit it
[1:20:44] all
[1:20:46] in yeah exactly it as much as I I don't
[1:20:50] know what it's like I just I want to do
[1:20:52] a complete compl thing you get this
[1:20:54] thought you want to get it done you want
[1:20:55] to move on to
[1:20:57] the but it is too important this subject
[1:21:01] is too
[1:21:02] important turn with me if you would to
[1:21:04] James chapter 4 let's look at this
[1:21:06] promise here James chapter 4 verse 6 the
[1:21:10] Bible says in verse six but he we want
[1:21:14] audience with God we want God's grace he
[1:21:17] giveth more grace wherefore he saith God
[1:21:21] resists the prop
[1:21:23] and giveth Grace unto the humble so all
[1:21:27] of us have desires in our life all of us
[1:21:29] has needs all of us has prayer requests
[1:21:32] all of us has things we we want to see
[1:21:35] happen Okay how do I get that how do I
[1:21:38] get that to happen in my life how do I
[1:21:40] get you know Noah found Grace in the
[1:21:44] sight of the
[1:21:45] Lord I'm sure he wasn't hoty and
[1:21:49] arrogant and thinking you know I'm God's
[1:21:51] Prophet I'm sorry he didn't act like
[1:21:53] that he would have never found Grace in
[1:21:55] the sight of
[1:22:01] God and I am not asking any of you to
[1:22:05] compare yourself with somebody that's
[1:22:07] more proud than you
[1:22:10] are to say you know I'm not so
[1:22:14] bad that's not what I'm asking you to
[1:22:18] do I'm asking you to get rid of every
[1:22:21] ounce every ounce how many times you
[1:22:24] come in from doing something and you say
[1:22:27] I just don't have any more energy I
[1:22:29] don't have one ounce
[1:22:31] left that's how you want to get with
[1:22:33] your pride I don't have one ounce left
[1:22:36] it's all
[1:22:38] gone well God can now do
[1:22:41] something God finally got a vessel if he
[1:22:44] could could just get one man in his
[1:22:46] hands now I don't know how long it's
[1:22:48] going to take it took Moses 40 years to
[1:22:51] get his out
[1:22:54] come on it took 40 years God wasn't
[1:22:57] wasting time with him in that
[1:23:03] desert he
[1:23:06] wasn't and he had a a hot tempered wife
[1:23:09] on top of
[1:23:12] it well God uses things to build
[1:23:17] character we don't got nothing in those
[1:23:19] 40 Years of what he went
[1:23:21] through but I believe with all my heart
[1:23:24] what he went through was building his
[1:23:27] character because God had a big job for
[1:23:29] him a real big
[1:23:32] job it was a oneman army but it wasn't
[1:23:36] no longer his strength and his ability
[1:23:38] and he's going to cut this Soldier and
[1:23:40] kill him and bury him it was no longer
[1:23:42] him it was God in him right this is what
[1:23:46] we're after we're after to get more of
[1:23:49] God in us and the way to do it is come
[1:23:51] under terms and conditions with him then
[1:23:54] the promises are his promises are yay
[1:23:58] and amen
[1:24:00] amen but we got to come under underline
[1:24:06] come in in Duty with this the promise of
[1:24:10] receiving more grace comes with humility
[1:24:13] he gives Grace unto the humble all right
[1:24:16] so verse 7even look at this God's
[1:24:18] conditional promise submit yourself
[1:24:20] therefore to God resist the devil and he
[1:24:22] will flee from
[1:24:24] you the first thing is get your will
[1:24:27] under your feet forget about what you're
[1:24:29] trying to
[1:24:31] accomplish submit to God I'm already
[1:24:34] submitted to Brother John no you think
[1:24:36] you're
[1:24:38] submitted because once you get submitted
[1:24:41] to God you can resist the devil and he
[1:24:44] will flee from you because that
[1:24:45] scripture and I've told you
[1:24:47] unconditionally God cannot lie
[1:24:50] amen now that's the word
[1:24:54] you're having a hard time getting the
[1:24:56] devil off your back take a look at
[1:24:59] what's going on Amen maybe there's
[1:25:03] something in your will that you're
[1:25:06] trying to
[1:25:08] push some agenda you're trying to
[1:25:12] push it may may not be God's will get it
[1:25:15] under your feet submit to the word maybe
[1:25:19] there's something that you haven't been
[1:25:20] doing God wants you to start doing it
[1:25:22] maybe you've been doing things God don't
[1:25:24] want you to do it
[1:25:26] submit well I'm having a problem with
[1:25:29] this why would God want me to go do that
[1:25:31] does have nothing to do with
[1:25:33] it that's just as much God's word as
[1:25:36] this over
[1:25:38] here it may not be what we're thinking
[1:25:42] about but if God wants us to go be
[1:25:44] faithful over here and do something over
[1:25:47] here do that you'll see maybe you'll
[1:25:49] have faith to resist the devil
[1:25:54] come
[1:25:56] on this to me brother Mar don't you feel
[1:25:58] that this is this is a word for all of
[1:26:01] us it's a word for all of us here we can
[1:26:03] all apply this to our
[1:26:05] lives it's it's it's not about
[1:26:09] uh you know I'm on the top 10% of the
[1:26:13] Church of a believer of a spiritual
[1:26:17] believer or you know this this what's
[1:26:19] being preached is for the lower 10% come
[1:26:22] on the word is the word and I don't care
[1:26:25] where I'm at with God I know there's a
[1:26:27] lot more for me a lot more for
[1:26:30] me you know Paul he had such he gave up
[1:26:36] everything he forsook everything that he
[1:26:38] might win
[1:26:40] Christ and he did
[1:26:43] it but 30 years later he's still
[1:26:46] pressing
[1:26:48] on after he already forsook all and
[1:26:51] metrist Christ he still pressed none he
[1:26:55] really wanted to be like Jesus he wanted
[1:26:57] to be in the image of God too often we
[1:27:00] just want to use God to get what we want
[1:27:02] in life come on he's not an N
[1:27:06] boy and we got to be honest with it God
[1:27:10] is interested in things that we don't
[1:27:11] think
[1:27:12] about and and this this
[1:27:17] Services is to help stir
[1:27:19] up that thought process
[1:27:23] stir up that God is interested in a
[1:27:25] relationship here we're interested in
[1:27:27] getting what we need here's the promise
[1:27:30] I'm believing for it I'm claiming it
[1:27:32] that's good but God is interested in
[1:27:34] something other than
[1:27:36] that but brother John he cares for me
[1:27:39] he's touched by the fs of my infirmities
[1:27:41] and I I know he cares for me yes he
[1:27:45] does and he will never
[1:27:48] stop but he's also interested in
[1:27:51] longterm
[1:27:53] long term I'm just going to be honest
[1:27:55] with you is
[1:27:58] character character in your life that's
[1:28:03] longterm there's there's
[1:28:06] short-term blessings from God there's
[1:28:08] long
[1:28:10] term job I will not be satisfied till I
[1:28:14] wake in his
[1:28:15] likeness long term I want to be in His
[1:28:19] image I mean the the very goal of God
[1:28:22] was to make a man in his own
[1:28:28] image and when he was able to make man
[1:28:31] in his own image then he could have
[1:28:32] fellowship with him it was not lonely
[1:28:35] anymore and I think sometimes God just
[1:28:38] gets lonely with us he wants to be with
[1:28:41] us but the only thing we want is we want
[1:28:42] we want help at this situation or that
[1:28:44] situation and we really don't care about
[1:28:46] spending much time with
[1:28:49] them right why call call thou me Lord
[1:28:52] Lord not do the things they say maybe
[1:28:54] God wants us out there speaking to
[1:28:56] somebody about Jesus
[1:28:58] amen terms and
[1:29:02] conditions all right it's 25 after let's
[1:29:06] Stand

[1:29:17] about this verse eight it says draw nigh

[1:29:22] your your heart you double mind Brother
[1:29:24] Bruce quoted that before
