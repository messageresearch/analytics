[30:58] as brother mark a great blessing to see
[31:01] brother ron amongst us amen
[31:05] we've missed him and of course we miss
[31:08] everyone

[31:11] family
[31:12] amen so those that you don't see in

[31:21] amen we
[31:23] uh that are strong bear the infirmities
[31:26] of the weak
[31:27] and
[31:28] and through prayer god answers your
[31:29] prayer amen
[31:31] hebrews chapter 3 verse 1
[31:33] wherefore holy brethren partakers of the
[31:36] heavenly calling
[31:38] consider the apostle and the high priest
[31:40] of our profession
[31:43] christ jesus
[31:45] who was faithful to him that appointed
[31:47] him as same as moses was faithful in all
[31:50] his house
[31:51] for this man was counted more worthy
[31:55] of i'm sorry counted worthy of more
[31:57] glory than moses and as much as
[32:01] he who have builted the house have more
[32:05] honor than the house so moses was a
[32:07] great man
[32:10] but god created moses
[32:15] for every house is builded by some man
[32:17] but he that built all things is god
[32:21] and moses was very faithful in all his
[32:23] house as a servant for a testimony of
[32:25] those things which were to be spoken
[32:27] after but christ as a son
[32:30] over his
[32:32] house
[32:33] whose house
[32:35] are we this is what the scripture has to
[32:37] do this morning where that it involves
[32:39] us whose house are we if
[32:42] we hold fast the confidence and
[32:45] rejoicing of the hope
[32:47] firm
[32:49] unto the end amen amen and then one more
[32:52] scripture reading in chapter 12 of the
[32:54] same book or chapter 11 i mean chapter
[32:57] 11. hebrews chapter 11 verses 1
[33:00] through 6.
[33:03] now faith is the substance of things
[33:06] hoped for
[33:08] the evidence of things not seen
[33:11] we might say
[33:13] that faith
[33:15] is
[33:16] missing
[33:18] i'm sorry hope is missing
[33:21] a substance that faith has and we all
[33:24] have hope right
[33:26] okay but faith
[33:29] grabs a hold of
[33:31] the situation brother branham said like
[33:33] this it's it's burly it's it's strong
[33:35] it's got hair in its chest
[33:37] faith
[33:38] uh is anchored
[33:40] and hope is still searching where to
[33:43] anchor
[33:46] so
[33:48] it is the evidence of things not seen so
[33:51] we're not gonna see this faith but it's
[33:54] it's it's real
[33:56] for by it the elders obtained a good
[33:59] report
[34:01] and through faith we understand that
[34:02] even god framed the
[34:04] uh the whole
[34:06] world together so that the things which
[34:08] were not uh which were made of things
[34:11] which do not appear so he used a face
[34:14] something invisible
[34:16] to create the worlds this pulpit was
[34:18] created but it was created by something
[34:20] that was already tangible
[34:23] god created the wood god created
[34:25] everything through something invisible
[34:27] that was called faith and by faith abel
[34:29] offered unto god a more excellent
[34:32] sacrifice than cain
[34:35] he was able to come to church and offer
[34:37] what pleased god
[34:39] more than cain when he came to church
[34:43] by which he or uh obtained a witness
[34:46] that he was righteous god testified of
[34:48] his gifts and by it he being dead yet
[34:50] speaketh
[34:52] by faith enoch
[34:54] was translated
[34:56] that he should not see death
[34:58] and was not found because god had
[35:01] translated them
[35:03] and this is important for us for before
[35:06] the translation of the rapture
[35:09] he had a testimony
[35:11] that he pleased god
[35:14] so how do i do that verse 6 says for
[35:16] without
[35:18] faith it's impossible to please him
[35:21] for he that cometh to god must
[35:24] must believe that he is
[35:28] and that he's a rewarder of them that
[35:30] diligently seek him amen man god bless
[35:33] you as you as you're seated and may god
[35:36] just quicken this word to us the bible
[35:39] says if we see first the kingdom
[35:42] that all other things will be added
[35:44] and he is a rewarder if we want things
[35:47] uh to to be better in our lives
[35:51] uh we have to put god first
[35:55] and we have to believe that the only
[35:57] thing god is looking for us is to love
[35:59] him with everything that we have and
[36:01] he'll take care of everything in our
[36:04] lives
[36:06] now
[36:08] i want to entitle this message a
[36:10] cultivating faith cultivating
[36:13] faith we know faith comes from god we
[36:16] can't force god to tell us anything true
[36:20] but we can cultivate him doing it
[36:23] and that's the part that we play
[36:26] now
[36:27] this is a very
[36:29] uh
[36:31] powerful scripture in hebrews chapter 3
[36:33] verse number 6
[36:36] but christ as a son over his own house
[36:38] whose house we are if those two words
[36:42] i know we're christians i know we're
[36:44] believers
[36:45] but we need to hold the confidence
[36:49] hold fast the confidence and the
[36:52] rejoicing
[36:54] of the hope
[36:55] firm to the end
[36:57] we can't just rejoice that we've been
[36:59] baptized
[37:01] that's just the beginning now the trials
[37:04] start now the testing start but that's
[37:06] all part of the plan of building our
[37:08] character we can't do away with the
[37:10] trials but through those we need to keep
[37:12] rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end
[37:16] hold fast of that confidence
[37:19] this shows that you're putting god first
[37:22] when you just kind of let go and all the
[37:25] things begin to bother you and you can't
[37:27] find up and down and you don't know what
[37:29] to do and you're just scrambling that
[37:32] shows that you've taken your eyes off of
[37:34] the prize you've taken your eyes off who
[37:36] started the work in you
[37:38] and we need to be confident that he's
[37:40] going to finish the work but in order
[37:42] for that to happen you got to keep your
[37:44] eyes glued on the lord
[37:46] and we can do this
[37:48] by cultivating faith
[37:52] we want to consider this morning
[37:55] the apostle and high priest of our
[37:57] profession
[38:01] and just
[38:03] cultivate faith in christ
[38:06] it's a real substance
[38:08] it's not something imaginary
[38:10] it's not something you just
[38:12] try to think of it's not a good idea
[38:15] that you came up with
[38:16] it's not up one week and down the next
[38:20] it's it's not that god used me this
[38:23] moment and the next moment you can't
[38:25] even see where god's at your situation
[38:28] that is not faith
[38:30] that is hope there's a difference
[38:36] faith is important
[38:38] in order for an elder to obtain a good
[38:42] report
[38:44] he has to stay faithful
[38:49] you're not going to get the right report
[38:52] unless you can stand the test
[38:55] amen
[38:56] faithfulness is the principle attribute
[38:59] that god is looking for
[39:02] we can only remain his house
[39:05] if we hold fast the confidence and the
[39:08] rejoicing of the whole firm to the end
[39:10] did not jesus say he that
[39:12] he that endure it to the end the same
[39:14] shall be saved
[39:15] so it's it's not it's not easy it's not
[39:17] gonna be a gift we're gonna have to
[39:20] learn through the process to get to the
[39:22] end to cultivate the faith
[39:24] we can't just come to church plop in
[39:27] church and expect to feel like we're
[39:29] enthused more about god when we leave
[39:34] amen
[39:35] we have a strong part to play that's
[39:37] right amen the word cultivate means
[39:41] trying to develop to pursue to foster
[39:45] to nurture or
[39:47] encourage
[39:49] that's something we do
[39:52] amen
[39:53] and when we cultivate something we're
[39:55] actually applying oneself to improving
[39:58] or developing
[40:00] so when we cultivate faith we must apply
[40:03] ourselves to improving it to developing
[40:06] it
[40:08] amen
[40:09] even though faith comes from god we are
[40:12] the ones that cultivate it we are the
[40:14] ones that cry out to god
[40:17] i need you lord amen
[40:21] we're living in perilous times the
[40:24] world's falling apart right before our
[40:26] eyes
[40:28] you don't even want to look at the news
[40:29] it's so discouraging
[40:31] professed believers are becoming
[40:34] more unthankful
[40:36] more ungrateful
[40:39] more of a bolster
[40:41] heady high-minded
[40:43] they're actually traitors
[40:44] they say one thing and do another
[40:47] they're more in love with themselves
[40:49] than ever before in history
[40:51] and jesus said because their iniquity
[40:54] the love that they once had would wax
[40:57] code
[40:59] in other words
[41:00] it would go in a museum in something
[41:02] that you could visit every now and then
[41:05] and say this is what it used to be
[41:08] jesus said in luke 18 8 he says i tell
[41:10] you that when
[41:12] when he will uh i tell you that
[41:15] he will avenge them speedily
[41:18] nevertheless when the son of man
[41:20] comes
[41:21] to get his bride
[41:23] shall he find
[41:25] faith on the earth he poses it as a
[41:29] question see the devil is always trying
[41:32] to tell you tell us tell the world they
[41:35] have enough that's right
[41:40] and i just can't seem to ever get that
[41:42] if i'm being honest with myself i just
[41:45] don't feel that i got it
[41:48] and i think that just helps me to keep
[41:49] pressing into it
[41:52] i say that faith is dwindling in our
[41:54] hour it's shrinking
[41:56] more and more believers are are trying
[41:58] to live off the knowledge of faith
[42:01] rather than faith
[42:03] amen
[42:04] our faith is is being tried like never
[42:07] before
[42:09] come on there got to be a lot of amens
[42:11] to that one
[42:12] i i think our faith is being tried like
[42:14] never before peter said it like this he
[42:17] said in first peter chapter 1 verse 7
[42:19] that the trial
[42:20] the trial or the trustworthiness
[42:23] of your faith
[42:25] being much more precious than of gold
[42:28] that perish it though it be tried with
[42:31] fire might be found into the praise and
[42:33] honor and glory at the appearing of
[42:36] jesus christ think of the times
[42:39] that jesus
[42:41] berated
[42:42] others
[42:44] for not believing
[42:47] even when he he he he resurrected and he
[42:49] saw his own two disciples on the walking
[42:51] of the road to demand he says oh you
[42:53] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[42:55] the word of god
[42:56] oh not these things to beli to to to to
[43:00] happened
[43:02] and and here he the verse is saying that
[43:05] that our faith could be at a place that
[43:07] when he appears we're not like that
[43:10] but that were it would be uh to the
[43:12] honor and glory at the appearing that
[43:15] god could look at us and say well done
[43:18] you you've held the test you believed
[43:20] you you went forward
[43:24] peter is
[43:25] taking the one thing in life gold
[43:29] that's been the most prized possession
[43:32] throughout history
[43:34] thing that we know and he's saying that
[43:36] the trial or the
[43:38] trustworthiness
[43:39] of your faith
[43:41] is so much more precious than that of
[43:44] gold
[43:45] so god is looking
[43:47] at how our attitude and our fa and our
[43:50] faith
[43:52] in him through everything is more
[43:54] important than what we do every day when
[43:56] we get them go to work
[43:59] go get some money so we can pay the
[44:00] bills
[44:03] while the world is prizing oil today
[44:06] diamonds gold the believer is prizing
[44:08] the opportunity of a trial
[44:13] because that's what brings about
[44:14] character character is not brought about
[44:16] coming and sitting in these seats
[44:19] that's right amen
[44:21] if if coming to church made you a
[44:23] genuine christian then going and living
[44:24] in a barn would make you a horse
[44:28] so we've got to take the word of god
[44:30] apply it to our lives
[44:34] we've got to about to show it's
[44:39] it's inside
[44:42] our flesh doesn't like going through
[44:44] trials
[44:47] but every ounce of god's character is
[44:50] built off the foundation of faith
[44:57] it's not a gift
[44:59] god views the trying of our faith more
[45:02] precious think about that
[45:04] we're so tempted to murmur grumble and
[45:06] complain
[45:08] and god says i'm providing you an
[45:09] opportunity to to trust in me
[45:13] verse 8 who having not seen you love
[45:17] in whom though now you see him not yet
[45:19] believing you rejoice with joy
[45:22] unspeakable and full of glory
[45:26] amen if we hold the beginning of our
[45:29] confidence steadfast to the end if we
[45:33] hold on and keep rejoicing firm to the
[45:36] end
[45:38] don't wait till you feel like it
[45:40] this this hope i'll be honest with you
[45:42] the bible says christ in you the hope of
[45:44] glory
[45:47] we're not there yet
[45:50] and if you had a revelation you'd be
[45:51] there
[45:53] [Laughter]
[45:55] i don't i don't mean i don't mean it
[45:57] wrong but you can't experience
[45:59] uh
[46:00] the love of god without possessing it
[46:04] you can you can't experience him being
[46:06] born again without ex without
[46:08] experiencing it
[46:09] and how are we gonna experience i'm in
[46:11] heaven without being there
[46:14] so it's christ in you the hope of glory
[46:17] i'm going somewhere i'm not right now
[46:23] receiving the end of your faith verse 9
[46:27] even
[46:28] the salvation of your souls
[46:31] faith is the beginning
[46:34] and what you're believing for comes in
[46:37] the end
[46:38] faith is the foundation
[46:41] it moves you
[46:42] off of the foundation to the end result
[46:45] amen you're no longer on a sinking sand
[46:49] when you hear from god
[46:52] not only is our faith being tried today
[46:55] but the devil he's actually working at
[46:57] eating at our faith
[47:00] right
[47:00] shoving all the ungodly media right in
[47:03] our face
[47:05] constantly reminding all of us of all
[47:07] the problems that are going on in their
[47:09] life
[47:10] hammering us of all their faults and
[47:12] failures
[47:14] tearing us down and eating away at our
[47:16] faith little by little
[47:19] trying to get us to even question
[47:22] god where are you lord
[47:25] the devil is walking around seeking whom
[47:27] he may devour
[47:29] and satan
[47:30] is trying to sift us like wheat
[47:34] that wasn't just
[47:36] peter trying to sift us all
[47:40] these things they give us major reasons
[47:43] that we need to be fighting for the
[47:44] faith
[47:45] to earnestly contend for the faith to
[47:47] cultivate faith in our personal lives
[47:52] satan is not going to
[47:54] give up
[47:56] on trying to destroy you
[47:58] it doesn't matter
[48:00] it doesn't matter what you do he's not
[48:02] going to give up
[48:04] so you're going to have to learn
[48:07] to protect your heart
[48:09] protect your soul
[48:11] tell the devil to get back
[48:13] this is holy ground
[48:15] you're unholy devil get out of my life
[48:19] now as long as satan can offer you
[48:21] something you want
[48:23] he's got an open door
[48:26] to tear you down
[48:27] first timothy chapter six verse nine
[48:30] first timothy chapter six verse nine but
[48:32] they that will be rich
[48:34] this is just one thing
[48:36] but you know because the love of money
[48:39] is the root of all evil money gets you
[48:40] what you want
[48:44] so but they that will be rich
[48:46] fall into a a temptation and a snare
[48:52] and into
[48:54] many foolish and hurtful lusts
[48:57] which drown men in destruction
[49:01] tradition of course when satan says look
[49:03] you got some money coming we get all
[49:05] excited
[49:08] but the scripture is telling us that it
[49:11] opens the door for a man just drowning
[49:14] in water help me i'm gonna die
[49:19] because when you've got money you've got
[49:21] power to make decisions and do what you
[49:23] want to do and you know what
[49:25] that don't mean a hill of beans what
[49:27] means everything is lord what would you
[49:28] have me to do
[49:30] that's what's important but money
[49:33] allows you to cross that border because
[49:35] now you know we feel he's given us an
[49:37] open door to go do what we want to do
[49:39] with her money
[49:42] for the love of money is the root of all
[49:45] evil which while some covenant after
[49:48] they have erred from the faith erred
[49:51] from the faith and have pierced
[49:53] themselves through with many sorrows
[49:56] going after things
[49:59] it all starts with the desire for
[50:01] something we do not have
[50:04] and it becomes an open door to air from
[50:07] the faith now we don't think it can hurt
[50:09] us it could bother us but it's just as
[50:11] wrong as wrong can be
[50:15] now the scripture says but thou o man of
[50:17] god
[50:18] praise god for men and women of god
[50:21] he said flee these things
[50:24] flee this desire for more
[50:27] and follow after what's important
[50:30] righteousness godliness faith love
[50:33] patience meekness
[50:36] fight the good fight of faith lay hold
[50:38] of eternal life we're into our called
[50:40] and has professed a good profession
[50:45] before many witnesses
[50:49] consider the high priest
[50:52] of our profession amen
[50:55] now just because we have professed a
[50:57] good profession among many witnesses it
[50:59] doesn't mean we don't have to keep
[51:01] fighting the good fight of faith
[51:04] we got to continue to fight amen we've
[51:07] got to continue to put the whole armor
[51:09] of god out we've got to continue to
[51:10] cultivate faith
[51:13] to keep
[51:14] professing the right profession yes amen
[51:18] now
[51:20] a lot of times
[51:21] we're not professing the right thing
[51:25] and what's bad about that is faith won't
[51:27] come if we're not professing the right
[51:29] profession
[51:32] don't be negative
[51:33] don't grumble murmur complain
[51:36] don't allow the devil to frustrate you
[51:40] and to get you off the right profession
[51:43] amen and i i say for this word you can
[51:45] just interchange it with confession what
[51:48] comes out of your mouth what you confess
[51:50] with your mouth what you confess is what
[51:53] you will become
[51:57] if you don't get serious about letting
[51:59] the mind of christ in letting the right
[52:02] thoughts in
[52:03] the devil has a chance to devour
[52:07] your faith
[52:10] and before you know it you'll be looking
[52:11] back and say i used to i used to i used
[52:14] to
[52:16] well god didn't change his word didn't
[52:18] change
[52:20] what's changed is our attitude and and
[52:23] and our faith
[52:27] if the bible says you got to fight the
[52:29] good fight and you got to lay hold
[52:32] and faith is a seed
[52:35] it it grows
[52:37] right
[52:39] it is
[52:40] the word of faith that god gives you
[52:42] it's a seed and it grows it's like a
[52:44] mushroom the more you use it the more it
[52:46] exercises
[52:47] and and if we could look at
[52:50] at brother mark well we we know he
[52:52] cultivates his muscles
[52:56] brother brother uh
[52:58] brother marty was another one that was
[53:00] just always strong when he touched him
[53:02] there was no mush
[53:05] but if you touch my tummy
[53:09] there's no muscle there's no six pack
[53:11] five pack no pack
[53:16] because it hasn't been exercised
[53:20] i just lay there and think about how
[53:21] good it would be to have
[53:25] and you know you could sit here and just
[53:26] wish you had faith
[53:29] but wishing you had faith to move
[53:31] mountains
[53:32] faith should get this thing out of your
[53:33] life faith you get closer faith to lay
[53:35] down your life faith to win souls it
[53:38] don't get the job done you got to
[53:40] cultivate it
[53:42] cultivate faith
[53:47] philippians chapter 4 verse 8.
[53:50] we're going to say a little bit on this
[53:52] thought
[53:53] finally brethren whatsoever things are
[53:55] true whatsoever things are honest
[53:57] whatsoever things
[53:58] are just whatsoever things are pure and
[54:01] lovely and of a good report
[54:04] then you can talk about it
[54:06] then you can think about it
[54:10] but if they ain't a good report ain't
[54:12] lovely
[54:13] ain't make you feel good
[54:15] you know it's not pure
[54:17] you don't have a business
[54:19] you don't have business thinking about
[54:22] it let alone talking about it
[54:25] we must follow god's pattern amen
[54:30] the pattern of correct thinking amen do
[54:33] you know just because we have the
[54:35] liberty and ability to think whatever we
[54:38] want to think and we don't have to
[54:39] answer to anybody it doesn't mean it's
[54:41] correct
[54:43] because as a man thinketh so is he
[54:47] but we don't want to be so is he we want
[54:49] to be so as christ we want the mind of
[54:52] christ we want to think correctly
[54:57] and i'll tell you we need
[54:59] to talk positivity
[55:02] no negativity
[55:03] we must hold fast the confidence and the
[55:06] rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end
[55:09] why because god can only work in the
[55:11] behalf of our confession of our faith
[55:17] if we begin to lose faith and confidence
[55:19] and trust then we're going to lose god's
[55:22] favor
[55:23] god's just going to step back
[55:26] without faith it's impossible to please
[55:29] god amen
[55:31] we need to consider more jesus christ
[55:34] the high priest of our profession
[55:37] if we confess negativity
[55:39] god can't do one thing for us remember
[55:41] that
[55:44] if we profess things are going bad
[55:46] things are not working out my situation
[55:49] keeps getting worse my problems are
[55:50] escalating
[55:53] our attitude will get worse and worse
[55:55] our faith will get weaker and weaker
[55:59] not because of god
[56:01] but because of us
[56:03] god isn't going to ignore our negative
[56:06] attitude and help us
[56:11] just because
[56:14] and i'll say it like this especially if
[56:16] you're a child of god
[56:18] why because god's trying to teach his
[56:20] children
[56:21] how to trust him
[56:23] how to grow up how to be strong during
[56:25] difficult times
[56:27] anybody can be a weakling
[56:32] but god is looking for somebody that
[56:34] will stand right in the midst of a
[56:37] lion's den
[56:38] of a fiery furnace of of a great trial
[56:41] in their life of giants in the land and
[56:43] say i'm standing with the lord
[56:48] that don't come with feelings and
[56:49] emotions
[56:52] if you want god to go to bat for you in
[56:54] your life you must learn to hold fast
[56:56] the confidence and the rejoicing of the
[56:58] hope firm to the end
[57:02] stare of difficulty in the eye like an
[57:03] old western movie
[57:06] they're standing there getting ready to
[57:07] have a
[57:09] a duel
[57:11] and that that that little theme that
[57:13] we've seen actually has been carried on
[57:15] to other movies
[57:17] just to show that
[57:20] there's going to be a fight
[57:22] and that's how it needs to be when
[57:24] you're facing difficulty like you're
[57:25] serious about this thing i'm ready to
[57:28] take on this thing i'm not afraid of it
[57:30] anymore
[57:32] amen
[57:34] what did god say to moses when he
[57:36] when moses was staring difficulty right
[57:39] in the face
[57:41] he said why cry
[57:43] speak unto the children of israel and
[57:45] tell them to move forward
[57:49] move forward
[57:51] bear
[57:53] where there's no there's no
[57:55] place to move every angle every side
[57:57] there is no way to go
[58:00] you must you remember this the rest of
[58:02] your life you must move forward in faith
[58:04] before your circumstances are going to
[58:07] move out of the way
[58:11] when they march forward in faith god
[58:13] changed their circumstance
[58:15] we're waiting for god to change his
[58:17] circumstance so we can say oh yeah i
[58:19] knew god was in it all the time
[58:23] anybody past is 2020.
[58:27] any vision of the past is 2020
[58:30] but if you've got such good vision you
[58:33] should better look forward and say god's
[58:35] going to move this mountain
[58:37] god's going to move this circumstance
[58:39] because i'm moving forward in christ
[58:44] march forward in your faith
[58:48] cultivate your faith
[58:50] and god will change your circumstance
[58:54] when god delivered them to the red sea
[58:56] with a mighty deliverance they came
[58:59] through on the other side and what they
[59:01] were what were they doing they were
[59:02] rejoicing were they not dancing
[59:04] rejoicing
[59:06] talking about how great their god was
[59:09] they just the bible says that they
[59:10] actually got baptized in the red sea
[59:15] and then they came to church and they
[59:16] rejoiced of god's great power in their
[59:18] lives but it didn't last long
[59:22] it was short-lived
[59:24] what happened to the children of israel
[59:26] what happened to the believers that were
[59:28] following the message of the hour in
[59:29] that day
[59:32] they began to murmur
[59:34] and they complained about their journey
[59:37] they didn't hold fast the confidence and
[59:40] the rejoicing of the hope firm to the
[59:42] end they let it slip right through them
[59:47] brother sister it's not he that begins
[59:49] the race
[59:51] it's he that finishes the reward goes to
[59:53] the believer who finishes
[59:55] jesus said he that endure to the end
[59:57] that's the one i'm saving
[1:00:00] so i'll bring you into remembrance after
[1:00:02] i saved the children of israel out of
[1:00:04] the land of egypt afterwards i destroyed
[1:00:06] them that believed not
[1:00:08] that did not hold
[1:00:10] their their their rejoicing of hope and
[1:00:13] their confidence firm to the end
[1:00:15] amen
[1:00:17] you think it's not a big thing
[1:00:20] can you imagine all the lies that satan
[1:00:22] told the children of israel
[1:00:24] you're okay
[1:00:26] don't worry about it this isn't fair
[1:00:30] you shouldn't have to go through this
[1:00:33] you're still a child of god children of
[1:00:34] god don't have to suffer like this
[1:00:39] even afterwards they when they made the
[1:00:41] decision
[1:00:42] we're not going over their attitude
[1:00:44] still remained
[1:00:45] like a carnal believer but we can still
[1:00:48] serve god over on this side
[1:00:51] they didn't leave the message
[1:00:54] in their mind
[1:00:57] but they never held on to the true
[1:00:58] message in their heart
[1:01:00] which was i've given you the promised
[1:01:02] land
[1:01:03] so don't let the devil tell you a
[1:01:05] different message
[1:01:06] don't let him misinterpret the right
[1:01:08] message to you stay with the word of the
[1:01:11] hour
[1:01:13] too many believers today they're not
[1:01:14] holding on
[1:01:16] with rejoicing
[1:01:18] come to church and they don't want to
[1:01:19] even praise god
[1:01:21] they're too
[1:01:22] dignified
[1:01:25] going through too many trials
[1:01:28] god sees my heart
[1:01:31] too many believers are walking without
[1:01:33] confidence today
[1:01:35] that god is really with them because
[1:01:38] they're not confessing
[1:01:40] professing
[1:01:42] their attitude
[1:01:44] too many believers are still coming to
[1:01:46] church but they're not believing the
[1:01:48] word personally for their heart
[1:01:50] in other words it's a good message
[1:01:52] something to learn by something that is
[1:01:55] is important but they're not taking the
[1:01:57] word for their their heart
[1:02:00] i'll say it like this we got a lot of
[1:02:02] purposes in our life
[1:02:04] but if you want to know what god's
[1:02:06] purpose is
[1:02:07] get last service
[1:02:09] god has a threefold purpose for his
[1:02:11] church
[1:02:13] and if we don't learn to give god the
[1:02:14] preeminence in our life we're never
[1:02:16] going to be used like we should be being
[1:02:19] used to restore the kingdom he's made
[1:02:21] his co-workers with him to restore the
[1:02:24] kingdom and the kingdom of god isn't in
[1:02:26] this building the kingdom of god is in
[1:02:27] the heart men and women
[1:02:30] god wants to use us for that amen
[1:02:34] believe the word the bible says so shall
[1:02:36] you be established
[1:02:38] but you've got to believe it personally
[1:02:40] for your lives
[1:02:41] too many believers like the children of
[1:02:43] israel the bible says in hebrews chapter
[1:02:45] 4 verse 1. look what happened let us
[1:02:48] therefore fear
[1:02:50] lest a promise be left us of entering
[1:02:52] into his rest
[1:02:54] any of you
[1:02:56] should come short of it
[1:02:59] wow
[1:03:00] we could have the same attitude the
[1:03:02] children of israel had i'm not going to
[1:03:04] come short god's with me see look i can
[1:03:06] testify my shoes don't wear out we're
[1:03:08] out he's leading me by his spirit every
[1:03:10] day for 40 years i can prove god's been
[1:03:12] with me
[1:03:14] come on
[1:03:17] i see the filler fire when i go to
[1:03:19] church
[1:03:23] for uh but they missed the
[1:03:28] message they were satisfied with how
[1:03:31] much god was with them instead of how
[1:03:33] much god should have been with them
[1:03:36] and hear the scriptures telling us that
[1:03:38] there is a rest they didn't enter into
[1:03:41] the rest and there is a rest
[1:03:43] and we need to fear unless we miss it
[1:03:45] too
[1:03:48] that ain't just for the young believers
[1:03:50] the weak believers the women no that's
[1:03:52] for every brother and sister in this
[1:03:54] church
[1:03:57] for unto us
[1:03:59] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[1:04:02] well as unto them
[1:04:04] but the word preached did not profit
[1:04:06] them
[1:04:07] even though faith comes by hearing
[1:04:10] they just heard naturally
[1:04:13] not being mixed with faith in them that
[1:04:16] heard it
[1:04:17] in other words when you come to church
[1:04:18] and you're hearing the word
[1:04:20] you need to be sitting there as if i'm
[1:04:22] here if i was the only one here this
[1:04:25] word is for me
[1:04:27] that's where it needs to be in your life
[1:04:30] if not you're coming for wrong reasons
[1:04:32] and it's it's all about emotions and
[1:04:34] feelings and what you can get for your
[1:04:37] natural
[1:04:38] life i'm telling we don't come to church
[1:04:41] to improve our natural lives
[1:04:43] but i've got lots of different tools
[1:04:45] that i could give you if you're just
[1:04:47] interested in in building your natural
[1:04:49] life
[1:04:52] we've got to believe the word for our
[1:04:54] lives personally
[1:04:56] if it's going to do any good
[1:05:00] now the first thing is believers we need
[1:05:02] to do is maintain the fear of the lord
[1:05:06] don't lose it
[1:05:08] without the fear
[1:05:10] we'll leave out part
[1:05:12] of the promise
[1:05:14] because the promise is for complete rest
[1:05:18] not partial
[1:05:21] the children of israel received part
[1:05:23] rest when they came out of egypt
[1:05:26] they didn't have that tyrant on on their
[1:05:28] back anymore they weren't being
[1:05:30] uh whipped didn't have to they weren't a
[1:05:32] slave anymore
[1:05:35] but they did not enter into the rest
[1:05:37] there were still more
[1:05:38] are you with me
[1:05:41] the promise that god has for us is his
[1:05:44] rest
[1:05:46] and we need all the promises of god to
[1:05:49] enter into the rest of god how many can
[1:05:52] say there's more of god for you
[1:05:54] all right the rest of god that's what
[1:05:56] we're here for too many believers are
[1:05:58] satisfied with the amount of rest they
[1:05:59] have
[1:06:01] and that's why they don't press in but
[1:06:02] look at verse 9 the same chapter hebrews
[1:06:05] 4 verse 9. there remaineth therefore a
[1:06:07] rest to the people of god
[1:06:10] not to the sinner not to the unbeliever
[1:06:13] but to the people of god
[1:06:16] for he that have entered into his rest
[1:06:18] have also ceased from his own works as
[1:06:21] god did from his
[1:06:24] you're no longer trying to accomplish
[1:06:27] living the life
[1:06:28] being a christian being in his image
[1:06:32] because christ has taken a hold of your
[1:06:34] life so much that when you look in the
[1:06:36] mirror of his word and you look in the
[1:06:38] mirror of his message you see a
[1:06:40] reflection of jesus christ
[1:06:43] that's the
[1:06:44] rest and anytime you can look in the
[1:06:47] word and you can look into the message
[1:06:49] and you see something that you're not
[1:06:51] doing you need a labor to enter into
[1:06:53] that
[1:06:57] let us therefore labor to enter into
[1:07:00] that rest
[1:07:01] lest any man fall after the same example
[1:07:05] of unbelief
[1:07:12] how many times does satan
[1:07:14] told us well we don't have to get real
[1:07:16] serious about that
[1:07:18] that is a real
[1:07:20] real thought
[1:07:23] and when you accept that
[1:07:27] god looks at that attitude
[1:07:29] it's not going to help you
[1:07:31] when you decide that you need help from
[1:07:33] god
[1:07:35] you know i
[1:07:37] i remember brother johnson saying
[1:07:40] from the pulpit
[1:07:41] he said
[1:07:42] just because somebody's not at church
[1:07:45] doesn't mean god hasn't preached the
[1:07:47] word to them
[1:07:49] because they chose not to be there
[1:07:50] doesn't mean god didn't give him the
[1:07:52] word
[1:07:53] and god will hold him accountable to it
[1:08:00] when god told the believers of moses to
[1:08:02] move forward into the promised land
[1:08:04] they said they couldn't because
[1:08:07] there were giants in the land
[1:08:11] there were only two believers who were
[1:08:13] willing to move forward
[1:08:16] because they moved forward in faith
[1:08:18] first
[1:08:20] the other ones didn't move forward in
[1:08:22] faith
[1:08:23] they continue to have a baby attitude of
[1:08:26] if god really wants us to have that land
[1:08:29] then he's going to move the giants out
[1:08:30] for me and when they get moved out and i
[1:08:32] can see it without faith in other words
[1:08:35] my sight
[1:08:36] then i'll go into the promised land
[1:08:39] until then i don't believe the message
[1:08:41] and we come to church because we don't
[1:08:43] feel we don't see
[1:08:45] we don't believe the word
[1:08:51] the word is still the word
[1:08:54] god didn't need something visible to
[1:08:56] create the earth
[1:08:59] and if we trust in him we shouldn't have
[1:09:01] to have something visible either
[1:09:03] we shouldn't have to have somebody just
[1:09:05] some
[1:09:06] playing your favorite song preaching
[1:09:08] your favorite listening to
[1:09:10] the the right tape reading the right
[1:09:11] scripture no god is god he's in
[1:09:14] everything and we need to humble
[1:09:15] ourselves have the fear of god that he's
[1:09:17] trying to speak to us
[1:09:20] i believe it with all my heart
[1:09:23] joshua and caleb were the only two that
[1:09:25] entered into the rest of god
[1:09:30] they had ceased from thinking
[1:09:32] that they had to take care of the giants
[1:09:34] on their own
[1:09:37] right
[1:09:39] where the others said you know we can't
[1:09:40] do that
[1:09:41] but god never asked you to do that he
[1:09:43] just asked you to get in there
[1:09:46] walk forward by faith that god was going
[1:09:49] to take care of it whatever you got
[1:09:51] going on in your life and you think it
[1:09:53] is just way too hard that is just a lie
[1:09:56] from satan you can't find that in the
[1:09:58] true word of god
[1:10:02] god is able to make stones rise up as
[1:10:04] children of abraham he can certainly
[1:10:06] take you
[1:10:07] and deliver you from any situation and
[1:10:10] give you the rest of the promise of god
[1:10:12] but you've got to walk forward in faith
[1:10:15] you have to
[1:10:19] i love that they ceased from their own
[1:10:21] thoughts i know they said we're more
[1:10:23] than able but they didn't say we're more
[1:10:25] than able
[1:10:28] they said we're more than able
[1:10:32] there's a difference
[1:10:35] one was through faith
[1:10:37] and the other's through sight
[1:10:40] like
[1:10:41] peter pulling out a sword let's go
[1:10:46] put that thing away you're not thinking
[1:10:48] correctly
[1:10:52] they had entered into the rest of the
[1:10:54] word that god had promised them they
[1:10:58] didn't come short of it
[1:11:00] now look we see this is so easy for us
[1:11:03] to identify who the right characters are
[1:11:05] in this skit
[1:11:07] it was joshua and caleb i would take
[1:11:09] their side
[1:11:11] would you
[1:11:13] what side are you taking today
[1:11:15] have you been professing negativity
[1:11:18] have you been murmuring have you been
[1:11:19] complaining have you been saying this
[1:11:20] this this trial in the wilderness has
[1:11:22] just been
[1:11:23] get out of it
[1:11:25] stand up rejoice keep it firm hold your
[1:11:28] confidence to the end he would have
[1:11:30] begun a good work he's going to finish
[1:11:31] it
[1:11:32] don't let one negative thing come out of
[1:11:34] your mouth you know here's the problem
[1:11:36] and satan's got so many people messed up
[1:11:39] go home and murmur and complain about
[1:11:41] your problems and come to church and act
[1:11:43] like a christian
[1:11:50] go home and act like a christian
[1:11:55] be an inspiration
[1:11:59] there remains therefore a rest to the
[1:12:03] people of god i'm a person of god
[1:12:08] anything saints we ought to be
[1:12:12] struggling or laboring laboring's the
[1:12:14] right word
[1:12:16] but we ought to be laboring to enter
[1:12:18] into that
[1:12:19] to that place where we can look at the
[1:12:21] giants in our life and say
[1:12:23] god's going to take care of this
[1:12:25] situation he's got this handled it's
[1:12:27] under control i don't know how
[1:12:30] you know if you notice joshua and caleb
[1:12:32] didn't spell it out and say this is how
[1:12:33] god's going to do it
[1:12:37] he wants you to walk around the walls of
[1:12:38] jericho sometimes just do it right just
[1:12:41] do it may look foolish and still just do
[1:12:43] it
[1:12:44] god's doing it
[1:12:47] god will take care of the circumstance
[1:12:50] if you walk forward in faith no matter
[1:12:54] how silly it looks just keep going to
[1:12:56] church keep praying keep reading keep
[1:12:58] rejoicing blow the trumpets announce
[1:13:01] your god he's more than able just keep
[1:13:03] doing it he'll take care of the
[1:13:05] circumstance
[1:13:06] [Music]
[1:13:08] cultivate faith
[1:13:10] cultivate it
[1:13:14] to give you some down to earth things to
[1:13:17] do to cultivate faith just in case i
[1:13:19] want to put this in the middle of the
[1:13:21] sermon
[1:13:22] just in case i didn't get to it because
[1:13:24] you know
[1:13:26] i just
[1:13:27] history tells me that i don't get to the
[1:13:29] end of my sermons
[1:13:32] i wanted to leave this for the end but
[1:13:35] i want to stick it in here right now
[1:13:39] we want to start
[1:13:41] with
[1:13:42] the internal things that we can do
[1:13:44] inside and i'm going to say it's our
[1:13:47] attitude
[1:13:50] it starts inwardly but it's shown
[1:13:52] outwardly
[1:13:54] and i don't want us to underestimate the
[1:13:56] importance
[1:13:57] of maintaining the right attitude
[1:14:00] brother branham says in the message the
[1:14:01] right mental attitude towards any divine
[1:14:03] promise of god will actually bring it to
[1:14:06] pass
[1:14:09] that means you got to keep thinking
[1:14:11] pure
[1:14:12] just good report keep professing god is
[1:14:16] able
[1:14:18] the first thing
[1:14:20] i believe these are john martin things
[1:14:23] the first thing
[1:14:25] with a right mental
[1:14:26] attitude is humility
[1:14:30] humble yourself under the word of god
[1:14:33] you get time read james 4 6-12
[1:14:36] humility is the first thing because he
[1:14:38] gives grace to the humble and he just
[1:14:41] resist the pride
[1:14:43] second thing
[1:14:46] inwardly
[1:14:47] repent
[1:14:49] of what brother john
[1:14:50] of all your murmuring all your
[1:14:52] complaining all your wrong confessions
[1:14:57] forget how bad it is in the wilderness
[1:15:00] and just the word says every man
[1:15:02] every man that come to god he must first
[1:15:04] be tried
[1:15:06] god wasn't making a mistake when the
[1:15:07] children of israel went went through
[1:15:09] that
[1:15:10] he was trying them he gave him so many
[1:15:12] opportunities
[1:15:15] but the promise that god has for the
[1:15:17] bride isn't for everybody
[1:15:22] there's only an elect that's why he
[1:15:23] calls him elect and and that's the one
[1:15:26] he chooses
[1:15:28] he chooses someone that's going to trust
[1:15:30] him above all the
[1:15:33] circumstances in the world
[1:15:36] amen god hates murmuring complaining
[1:15:38] i'll say it like this it is the evidence
[1:15:41] of one thing
[1:15:43] i want to say one thing today it's
[1:15:45] obviously evidence of many things but
[1:15:47] it's the evidence of one major thing
[1:15:50] where it starts from pride
[1:15:55] murmuring complaining comes from a heart
[1:15:57] that's proud and feels shouldn't have to
[1:15:59] do this
[1:16:03] it proves how unthankful we really are
[1:16:09] the third thing with our attitude is to
[1:16:11] make sure that you're willing to move
[1:16:13] forward and trust god
[1:16:15] because if if it's not there if you're
[1:16:18] not going to be willing to take that
[1:16:20] first step
[1:16:22] your attitude will never be right
[1:16:25] so willing to labor to really believe
[1:16:27] the word when it's preached to you
[1:16:28] personally that this word is for you
[1:16:30] you've got to be willing to submit to it
[1:16:34] an unwilling attitude will never ever
[1:16:38] cultivate the faith of god
[1:16:42] you can't you can't just have this
[1:16:44] relationship with god and say i'm going
[1:16:46] to believe what i want to believe and
[1:16:47] and hold on to what i want to hold on
[1:16:49] leave the church and then go have your
[1:16:51] personal life with god and expect god to
[1:16:53] meet you when he tried giving you a word
[1:16:55] when you were at church
[1:16:58] and you made little of his word
[1:17:00] right
[1:17:01] can you imagine having children and
[1:17:03] asking them to do something and this is
[1:17:05] what i want you to do and they only do
[1:17:08] half of it but then they come around and
[1:17:10] say can i have my ice cream can i my
[1:17:11] candy can in my allowance
[1:17:14] what is the first thing you say did you
[1:17:16] do
[1:17:18] you didn't do what i asked you to do do
[1:17:20] you think god's different
[1:17:22] that is no different
[1:17:28] we've got to cultivate faith these th
[1:17:31] these three things will cultivate
[1:17:34] faith
[1:17:36] when you have the mind of christ in you
[1:17:38] it'll cultivate faith when you're
[1:17:39] exercising the right mental attitude
[1:17:41] will cultivate
[1:17:43] this is what we can do inwardly
[1:17:46] with our attitude to cultivate faith
[1:17:52] the substance
[1:17:54] from god think about that
[1:17:58] you cultivate faith you're actually
[1:17:59] cultivating a substance that's going to
[1:18:01] come from god
[1:18:05] can you imagine if we all wanted a drink
[1:18:07] of water here and there was no water
[1:18:12] but by you
[1:18:14] having the right attitude that
[1:18:16] i know god's going to get it to us
[1:18:18] that's is really what's ushering the
[1:18:20] vehicle of god coming and giving it to
[1:18:23] you
[1:18:25] now
[1:18:26] what can we do outwardly to cultivate
[1:18:28] faith
[1:18:30] i say after we've rededicated i'm using
[1:18:33] that word rededicated our attitude to
[1:18:36] cultivate faith inwardly there's some
[1:18:38] things that we can do outwardly
[1:18:41] to cultivate faith
[1:18:44] now
[1:18:45] because you cultivated the inside first
[1:18:47] you're able to do this
[1:18:50] you're able to do this
[1:18:53] the first is
[1:18:55] well you don't have to be first i'm
[1:18:56] sorry these you put them in anywhere you
[1:18:58] want
[1:18:59] but
[1:19:00] you're gonna speak this word you're
[1:19:02] gonna profess it
[1:19:04] i'm going to spend more time praying
[1:19:08] i'm going to spend more time reading the
[1:19:10] word
[1:19:10] i'm going to spend more time listening
[1:19:12] to what the prophet taught
[1:19:14] i know that rapturing faith lies in
[1:19:16] those tapes
[1:19:18] i'm going to be faithful to god's house
[1:19:21] god is a rewarder to them that
[1:19:23] diligently seek him
[1:19:25] matthew 7 verse 7 says ask and it shall
[1:19:27] be given seek and you shall find knock
[1:19:29] and it shall be opened unto you and
[1:19:31] everyone that asketh receiveth and he
[1:19:33] that seeketh findeth them to him that
[1:19:34] knocketh it shall be open amen amen
[1:19:39] so that's why i'm going to be faithful
[1:19:41] that's why i'm going to seek him
[1:19:43] diligently
[1:19:46] and last but not least
[1:19:48] i'm going to worship the lord more
[1:19:52] your worship has everything to do with
[1:19:54] your attitude it starts inward and comes
[1:19:57] outside i'll tell you a lot of people
[1:19:59] they don't worship in church because
[1:20:00] something's not right on the inside you
[1:20:02] can stand behind that thing and say i
[1:20:04] worship god different but i'll tell you
[1:20:06] the bible says all ye that have breath
[1:20:07] praise ye the lord
[1:20:09] he makes the trees clap his hands he'll
[1:20:12] make the rocks cry out don't tell me
[1:20:14] you're worshiping god inside it'll come
[1:20:16] outside if you're worshiping god
[1:20:20] the bible says i will enter his gates
[1:20:22] with thanksgiving i will enter his
[1:20:23] courts with praise
[1:20:26] now satan's nature
[1:20:27] doesn't want you to exalt
[1:20:30] god satan said i will exalt my throne
[1:20:33] about the throne god
[1:20:35] what does satan's nature inside of us do
[1:20:37] i'm not going to exile i'm not going to
[1:20:38] praise god i'm not in a mood man
[1:20:40] you can't make me
[1:20:42] doesn't mean anything
[1:20:45] it's a satanic nature
[1:20:47] you need to deal with it it's a bad
[1:20:49] attitude
[1:20:51] isaiah 25 verse 1 says oh lord i know
[1:20:54] this isn't i'm just going to quote it
[1:20:55] real quick oh lord thou art my god i
[1:20:57] will exalt thee i will praise thy name
[1:20:59] for thou has done wonderful things
[1:21:03] find something to praise the lord for
[1:21:05] amen
[1:21:06] i'll tell you if the children of israel
[1:21:07] would have kept praising god that he he
[1:21:09] brought us out of egypt
[1:21:11] they wouldn't have been saying well man
[1:21:14] we had a better back in egypt
[1:21:17] psalms 118 verse 28 thou art my god i
[1:21:20] will praise thee
[1:21:22] now my god i will exalt thee
[1:21:25] oh give thanks unto the lord for he is
[1:21:27] good for his mercy and your friend i'll
[1:21:30] tell you if there's one thing we should
[1:21:31] all about to rejoice in when we come to
[1:21:33] church is we got new mercies today
[1:21:36] you know coming in church and not
[1:21:38] putting your heart into worship brother
[1:21:40] something's wrong with your attitude
[1:21:42] you're not going to cultivate any faith
[1:21:44] sitting here and hearing the word with
[1:21:46] these ears ain't going to give you faith
[1:21:51] but as we do these things faith will
[1:21:53] begin to grow genuine substance of faith
[1:21:56] will begin to grow in your heart
[1:22:01] and i'll tell you what it does this is
[1:22:03] god he'll take care of the giants that
[1:22:05] are in your life
[1:22:08] because you're entering into christ
[1:22:13] you know
[1:22:16] everybody knows i've said this before
[1:22:18] that there was a time in my life
[1:22:20] that i was unwilling to serve god well
[1:22:23] we all at one time in life was
[1:22:24] unbelievable to serve god
[1:22:26] but i'm a businessman i didn't know i
[1:22:28] was a businessman but we're all
[1:22:30] businessmen in some sort of way i made a
[1:22:33] deal with god that i would serve him if
[1:22:36] he gave me cheryl
[1:22:38] remember that that was a business deal
[1:22:41] i was making a business deal i would
[1:22:44] fulfill the word if he gave me what i
[1:22:46] wanted
[1:22:48] and that's a lot of us when we come to
[1:22:50] church i will worship you correctly if
[1:22:52] you put the feeling there
[1:22:55] if i have a good week
[1:22:57] i don't care if you had a fight on the
[1:22:59] way to church i'll tell you get it under
[1:23:01] the blood and come in and offer the
[1:23:03] sacrifice of praise he's worthy of all
[1:23:06] praise
[1:23:09] don't let anything stand in the way
[1:23:12] what did god tell moses every place that
[1:23:15] the soul of your foot shall tread upon
[1:23:18] that i've given you as i said unto moses
[1:23:23] joshua you must take the first step of
[1:23:28] faith
[1:23:30] and then
[1:23:31] i
[1:23:32] will take care of the giant circumstance
[1:23:37] i
[1:23:39] you you we must walk forward
[1:23:42] and possess
[1:23:45] not in your abilities remember this
[1:23:48] it's in your faith
[1:23:51] your abilities don't mean anything
[1:23:54] amen
[1:23:56] you know to me one of the saddest things
[1:23:58] is sit there and testify of all these
[1:24:00] things
[1:24:02] that god has done for us in our lives
[1:24:05] and we're not being faithful to him
[1:24:08] think about that
[1:24:10] god has shown himself so faithful to you
[1:24:13] so good to you and you can't be faithful
[1:24:16] to him
[1:24:18] i think that's so sad
[1:24:24] god
[1:24:25] wants us
[1:24:26] to enter into the rest of god and so
[1:24:30] god's telling joshua every place that
[1:24:32] the soul of your foot
[1:24:35] treads upon i've given you that
[1:24:37] amen well why don't you just give it to
[1:24:39] me
[1:24:40] no
[1:24:41] i'm not i'm not a daddy old grandpa
[1:24:45] you've got to take it by faith
[1:24:48] the kingdom of god suffered violence the
[1:24:50] violence taketh it by force what do they
[1:24:52] use faith faith in god
[1:24:56] that this word is real to me god is real
[1:24:58] to me this promise is real to me healing
[1:25:01] is real to me
[1:25:02] whatever it is that you're seeking for
[1:25:04] it's got to be real to you
[1:25:07] step out by faith walk forward in faith
[1:25:10] first then god will take care of your
[1:25:13] giant circumstance
[1:25:16] without faith god isn't going to give it
[1:25:17] to you
[1:25:19] god isn't going to meet the needs of a
[1:25:22] murmur and a complainer
[1:25:29] and you know what i'll just i'll say it
[1:25:30] like this
[1:25:34] you may be able to bite your tongue and
[1:25:36] not say anything negative anymore that's
[1:25:38] good
[1:25:39] but you got to deal with your heart
[1:25:42] the thoughts of your heart
[1:25:45] they've got to be
[1:25:47] without murmuring and complaining if god
[1:25:49] wants you to go through a trial
[1:25:51] lord not my will thine be done amen
[1:25:54] you're going to bring forth glory to you
[1:25:56] that's what's important to me you're
[1:25:58] going to use this vessel to show that i
[1:25:59] can stand here in the middle of this
[1:26:01] fire and i'm going to meet you just like
[1:26:03] the three hebrews did amen amen and god
[1:26:05] will meet you there if you trust god
[1:26:09] now those three human children weren't
[1:26:10] walking with a bunch of knowledge and
[1:26:12] know-it-all this is what god's gonna do
[1:26:14] i know what god's gonna do i know they
[1:26:16] didn't know
[1:26:18] they just trusted
[1:26:20] they just believed
[1:26:22] just believe
[1:26:25] it's about being serious god will try
[1:26:27] you
[1:26:28] draw an eye to god in faith and he'll
[1:26:30] draw nigh to you in circumstance
[1:26:32] [Music]
[1:26:34] don't wait for him to take care of the
[1:26:36] circumstance before you're going to
[1:26:37] praise god
[1:26:39] don't do that
[1:26:41] it isn't like you got to come in church
[1:26:42] and stand up at the pulpit and begin to
[1:26:44] say well i got uh these things are going
[1:26:46] on my run in my life but god's going to
[1:26:48] do this you don't got to do that
[1:26:50] but you can come into church and sit
[1:26:51] down and praise him just as if you did
[1:26:55] i hope you catch what i'm saying
[1:26:58] let your attitude be expressed in your
[1:27:00] worship amen
[1:27:04] loves to be worshipped
[1:27:05] he created angels to worship him
[1:27:09] what do you think he he just
[1:27:11] he created us to sit down and watch it
[1:27:12] all as entertainment
[1:27:15] no he created us to worship him too
[1:27:17] everything brings god glory
[1:27:20] and there's so many ways that we can do
[1:27:22] it
[1:27:23] my
[1:27:24] so many things
[1:27:26] that we could say here
[1:27:27] don't let the devil scare you and tell
[1:27:29] you it's too hard you can't do it you'll
[1:27:33] never change
[1:27:34] submit yourself therefore until the
[1:27:36] promise of god resists the devil and
[1:27:39] he'll flee from you
[1:27:40] i just i want to ask this question today
[1:27:43] who are
[1:27:44] the joshua and caleb's
[1:27:47] of this church
[1:27:55] who are
[1:27:57] the children in the wilderness
[1:28:02] that have forgotten the mighty
[1:28:04] deliverance
[1:28:07] move forward from where you've been
[1:28:10] living
[1:28:11] move forward in faith
[1:28:13] in attitude in doing the things that you
[1:28:16] need to do to cultivate faith faith will
[1:28:19] come deliverance will come healing will
[1:28:22] come joy will come love will come all
[1:28:25] that you need will come if you move
[1:28:27] forward in faith
[1:28:29] you've got to cultivate it
[1:28:31] you got to cultivate it friends i know
[1:28:33] there's nothing there is such a great
[1:28:35] blessing when we get an evangelist up
[1:28:37] here and he's just like fired away
[1:28:40] on the promises of god
[1:28:42] it's enjoyable it really is
[1:28:45] but you know what i've seen it more
[1:28:47] times than not by the time the next
[1:28:49] service comes nobody comes hardly nobody
[1:28:52] comes to church early getting in late
[1:28:54] all down in the dumps
[1:28:57] what three days later
[1:29:00] we need to learn to cultivate faith
[1:29:03] that's something we do at home
[1:29:07] so when we get here the atmosphere is so
[1:29:09] easily created we don't gotta you know
[1:29:11] hope you know
[1:29:12] the song leader you know
[1:29:15] does good for us
[1:29:17] you know we need to learn
[1:29:19] to be prepared for god
[1:29:22] be prepared for god if you're just
[1:29:24] coming to church be prepared for church
[1:29:25] whatever
[1:29:27] but but be get prepared for god if if
[1:29:30] look
[1:29:32] if you're gonna go out on a date with
[1:29:34] god
[1:29:37] i tell you you would get some rest
[1:29:40] you'd put on your best dudes
[1:29:42] duds
[1:29:44] dudes
[1:29:46] you would have your best attitude you
[1:29:48] want to be sharp and you want to be able
[1:29:50] to pay attention to what he's saying
[1:29:53] he wouldn't come in half here
[1:29:56] and expect you know well just doing my
[1:29:58] duty
[1:29:59] we need to cultivate faith friends it
[1:30:01] starts at home the cultivating is at
[1:30:04] home
[1:30:06] amen
[1:30:08] well we're going to have to
[1:30:13] there's
[1:30:14] many examples in the bible and we've
[1:30:16] heard them before we got three hebrew
[1:30:17] children
[1:30:19] they didn't murmur and they didn't
[1:30:20] complain about their circumstance you
[1:30:22] can't find it
[1:30:24] they weren't afraid
[1:30:26] they didn't tell the king oh yeah i got
[1:30:28] all this figured out
[1:30:30] no
[1:30:31] they didn't
[1:30:33] and they didn't try to figure it out
[1:30:34] either they didn't try to understand
[1:30:36] everything but they kept the right
[1:30:38] attitude
[1:30:40] they simply rested in god's grace
[1:30:43] they walked forward in to the fire in
[1:30:48] faith
[1:30:49] amen
[1:30:51] they didn't say i'm not going to go
[1:30:52] through that trial i'm not going to do
[1:30:54] that
[1:30:55] sometimes god just forces us
[1:30:57] circumstances beyond our control
[1:31:01] right i i can't imagine the three hebrew
[1:31:04] children would have went into that thing
[1:31:05] if if they had a choice
[1:31:09] but god didn't give him a choice
[1:31:14] but through this trial of their faith
[1:31:18] it was more precious
[1:31:20] than the gold yes
[1:31:23] so when you're going through something
[1:31:24] you have an opportunity to bring god
[1:31:26] more glory than you can without the
[1:31:29] trial
[1:31:31] so cultivate faith
[1:31:33] cultivate faith because you're going to
[1:31:35] need it for the trials to come let's
[1:31:36] stand together may the lord
[1:31:39] bless you there's there's so many things
[1:31:41] and i i i i just
[1:31:46] i can't i we can't do it all i say it
[1:31:48] like this read the bible
[1:31:51] go go home read the bible and god will
[1:31:54] show you
[1:31:55] amen cultivating faith
[1:31:58] amen
[1:32:00] i
[1:32:02] i couldn't help but
[1:32:06] to think about that one song that
[1:32:12] my wife was playing there and

[1:32:17] there is a place
[1:32:20] there is a place there remains
[1:32:22] a rest for the people of god
[1:32:25] i'll say it like this brother branham
[1:32:27] told us
[1:32:29] to put the shell in the gun
[1:32:31] and fire it
