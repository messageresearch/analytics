[35:04] they're facing a lot of junk in the
[35:06] world
[35:07] a lot of terrible things
[35:09] amen before we
[35:11] start reading if we could let's look
[35:13] to the
[35:15] lord in prayer
[35:16] our heavenly father
[35:18] we thank you for the
[35:20] the great liberty that we have today to

[35:33] the people of ukraine
[35:35] not having this freedom and liberty

[35:49] with us but you would be with the
[35:51] believers of ukraine that you keep your
[35:53] your hand of protection upon them and
[35:56] lord we know ultimately
[35:58] uh destruction is coming but you're
[36:00] still in control and
[36:03] we're trusting in you
[36:04] uh lord for all things that are
[36:06] transpiring
[36:08] tonight we pray that you'd come and lord
[36:10] that you would prepare us for the
[36:11] rapture
[36:13] lord that you would prepare us
[36:15] for that catching away that we might be
[36:18] ready in that hour
[36:19] that would not be lacking that would not
[36:21] be found in the balances
[36:24] out out of balance but lord that we
[36:26] might be dressed properly please come
[36:28] and
[36:29] lord give us the revelation of your word
[36:31] tonight
[36:33] break this word to us and
[36:35] give us the understanding we need that
[36:37] we might be better christians lord we
[36:39] commit the service now yes
[36:41] your blessings down the reading of the
[36:43] word in jesus christ's name we pray
[36:45] amen amen turn with me if you would to
[36:48] the book of philippians chapter 2 and
[36:50] then also colossians chapter 1.
[36:55] philippians chapter 2 verse
[36:57] number 5
[37:00] reads let this mind be in you which was
[37:03] also
[37:04] in christ jesus
[37:07] and then colossians just the next book
[37:09] over a few pages
[37:10] chapter one starting with verse number
[37:12] 17
[37:14] and he
[37:15] speaking of jesus christ and jesus
[37:18] christ is before all things and by him
[37:21] all things consist
[37:23] and he is the head of the body
[37:25] the church we could say this church
[37:28] who is the beginning the first
[37:31] born from the dead that in all things
[37:35] he might have the preeminence in our
[37:37] church in our midst amen
[37:40] for it please the father that in him
[37:42] should all fullness dwell
[37:45] amen god bless you may be seated
[37:47] now earlier in this series
[37:51] we read a quote from christ is the
[37:54] mystery of god
[37:57] and brother branham said this
[37:59] is god's great mystery of love expressed
[38:03] that god and man became one see
[38:07] that's what god's achievement that's
[38:09] god's purpose to do that that he might
[38:12] be in christ in christ in us and all of
[38:15] us together be one
[38:17] this is god's great mystery of love
[38:21] expressed and that god and man could
[38:25] become one amen and i made mention that
[38:28] service that we're in the process
[38:31] we're in that process in which we are
[38:33] uniting with god's divine nature of love
[38:37] we're becoming more like christ
[38:40] that's where we should be
[38:42] now i want to continue in this series
[38:44] tonight of just god's consciousness
[38:47] we've been trying to
[38:48] get the complete image of christ what
[38:51] what does that mean
[38:52] i believe in order to see the image of
[38:55] christ we need to have the mind of
[38:57] christ
[39:00] import part four
[39:02] uh
[39:03] we let go of some things
[39:06] that
[39:07] we were holding on to
[39:09] things that we just
[39:12] wouldn't think that we would ever
[39:14] forgive somebody because of what they
[39:16] did we just let it go because it's part
[39:18] of god's nature to let it go to forgive
[39:21] and
[39:21] if we're going to become like him we got
[39:23] to act like him and and that's why jesus
[39:25] said if we don't he's he'll turn around
[39:27] and not forgive us
[39:31] so
[39:32] just think about it when you're
[39:34] forgiving some somebody that moment that
[39:36] you're doing that you're actually
[39:38] manifesting or shining the image of
[39:40] jesus christ in that moment
[39:46] we can't move forward without doing that
[39:50] now in part five tonight
[39:52] we want to see what happens when god has
[39:56] the preeminence in our mind amen
[40:02] brother branham said in the message
[40:04] christ is the mystery of god revealed he
[40:06] said that god had a threefold purpose in
[40:09] his mind
[40:11] first to express himself completely
[40:15] god in christ
[40:17] and we read the scripture for it please
[40:19] the father that in him the fullness
[40:22] of god's fullness would dwell
[40:25] but it doesn't stop there is his purpose
[40:27] didn't stop there but iran says second
[40:30] to have the preeminence in his church
[40:32] which is his body the bride till he come
[40:35] and have preeminence to express himself
[40:38] through them now i want us to catch this
[40:41] everything that god expressed in christ
[40:44] brother branham said god's second part
[40:47] of that purpose was to express himself
[40:50] that same self inside of us the bride
[40:56] and third to restore the kingdom to its
[40:59] rightful position brother brahm said
[41:00] that fell by sin by the first adam back
[41:03] to where he walked in the cool of the
[41:05] evening with his people talked with them
[41:07] and fellowshipped with them amen now why
[41:10] is this important
[41:12] because we're not just part of the
[41:14] purpose but we are the ones to fulfill
[41:16] the purpose
[41:18] we have a part to pray brother man says
[41:20] to restore back eden
[41:23] bring back that which
[41:25] was lost
[41:27] that which was that was the only thing
[41:28] out of order all the rest was in order
[41:30] brother branham said
[41:32] so we're going to try to break this down
[41:34] but the first purpose was to express all
[41:37] of himself through christ
[41:40] john 1 1 says in the beginning was the
[41:42] word the word was with god the word was
[41:43] god
[41:45] the word was god and verse 14 the word
[41:48] was made flesh
[41:50] and dwelt among us and we beheld the
[41:52] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[41:56] of the father full of grace and full of
[41:59] truth
[42:00] so this invisible god was made flesh and
[42:05] we behold we touched him we saw him
[42:09] this was god manifested in the flesh and
[42:11] first timothy 3 16 says without
[42:13] controversy great is the mystery of
[42:15] godliness for god was manifested in the
[42:19] flesh
[42:20] first or colossians chapter 1 verse 15
[42:23] says jesus christ is in the image of the
[42:26] invisible god the firstborn of every
[42:29] creature
[42:31] brother brahm says if you really want to
[42:32] know who god is you look at jesus christ
[42:35] amen you know exactly
[42:38] who
[42:39] who god is he is the word
[42:42] and and so god fulfilled this purpose
[42:46] he fulfilled it
[42:48] but in order for god to express all of
[42:51] himself through christ
[42:52] he had to allow man to fall
[42:56] amen or else he would never express
[42:59] being a a savior or redeemer if if if if
[43:04] if
[43:05] man was perfect there would be a part of
[43:08] god that would not be able to be
[43:11] expressed and the bible says for it
[43:12] please the father that in him should all
[43:15] the fullness dwell
[43:17] so there was a part of god that wanted
[43:19] to be expressed and couldn't be
[43:21] expressed without man falling so man
[43:25] fell and
[43:26] and man uh
[43:28] realized that he needed stability in his
[43:30] life he needed a savior he needed to be
[43:33] redeemed he needed healing for his body
[43:36] and and through jesus christ we have the
[43:39] benefits of all those attributes that
[43:41] was in god amen
[43:43] now through the cross not only our sins
[43:46] could be raised their bodies could be
[43:48] healed but the great thing our selfish
[43:53] our selfish nature our self-willed
[43:55] beastly nature could be changed
[44:00] through the holy ghost god can change
[44:02] our very nature back to what the image
[44:05] that was at the beginning in the garden
[44:08] that's why the bible says through faith
[44:11] we can do all things through christ who
[44:14] strengthens us so this is not something
[44:16] that's far-fetched this is not something
[44:18] that happens after the rapture takes
[44:20] place or unwraps your door this is
[44:22] happening
[44:24] service by service from glory unto glory
[44:27] it's how much you put into it is how
[44:29] much you get out of it
[44:32] now this first purpose of god was to
[44:34] express all of himself through christ
[44:37] he couldn't have done that unless the
[44:39] father
[44:41] had preeminence in jesus
[44:45] there was something that jesus had to do
[44:48] the bible says that he learned obedience
[44:49] to the things he suffered
[44:51] jesus had to deny his will he had to say
[44:54] not my will thy will be done
[44:57] amen he said i do nothing except the
[45:00] father shows me first it's all showing
[45:03] and pointing back that that jesus was
[45:05] giving the father preeminence
[45:10] and the second purpose of god was to
[45:12] express all of himself again
[45:14] through us
[45:18] branham says all that was in god he
[45:19] poured into christ and all that was in
[45:20] christ he poured into the church
[45:24] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[45:27] but in order to have this
[45:29] he has to have that preeminence in the
[45:30] church
[45:32] he has to have the preeminence in us
[45:34] amen so we have to learn to do the same
[45:37] things that jesus did we have to learn
[45:39] to say not my will father but thine be
[45:41] done we have to we have to learn to to
[45:44] obedience by the things that we suffer
[45:48] we have to learn not to do anything
[45:50] except he shows us first what to do
[45:57] we read and he is the head of the body
[45:59] the church the beginning the firstborn
[46:01] of the dead that in all things
[46:04] he wants the preeminence
[46:06] that's all i can say our flesh don't
[46:08] want to give it to him
[46:09] none of our flesh
[46:11] all flesh
[46:13] is bad
[46:17] it doesn't uh
[46:19] it's it's carnal it it doesn't ever want
[46:22] to die out
[46:24] so we have
[46:25] we have a part to play amen
[46:29] now first of all just because we believe
[46:32] we are predestinated it doesn't mean
[46:34] that we are
[46:37] right now
[46:38] if you are predestined you have to
[46:40] believe that you're predestined in it
[46:43] but just because you believe you're
[46:44] predestined doesn't mean you're
[46:45] predestinated
[46:48] this is what's what's real
[46:51] hard about this subject
[46:54] but if we are predestined this is what i
[46:56] want to tell you you will continue to
[46:58] mature more and more into the image of
[47:01] god there's no doubt about that
[47:03] amen
[47:04] you can't say you're predestinated and
[47:06] don't mature and don't grow it just
[47:08] doesn't exist
[47:14] to me this is a great mystery that's
[47:16] been hid from the believers
[47:18] who don't love god with all their heart
[47:24] because it's easy to say well i believe
[47:26] i believe i believe i'm predestined but
[47:28] they don't pay attention to their lives
[47:34] yet they have the knowledge of
[47:35] predestined and they claim to believe
[47:37] that they are
[47:39] brother branham said lucifer thinks and
[47:42] exalts himself above the word of truth
[47:45] by
[47:46] the knowledge of revelation just think
[47:49] about that
[47:50] not the revelation
[47:52] but the knowledge of the revelation
[47:56] he can get people to believe just by
[47:59] knowledge
[48:03] that's why we have to hold ourselves
[48:05] accountable to the revelation amen
[48:09] because knowledge just puffs you up
[48:12] the love of god will edify it will it it
[48:15] will help
[48:16] not just only
[48:18] let god have preeminence in your life
[48:20] but you'll be working at restoring the
[48:22] kingdom amen
[48:25] fulfilling the purpose of god
[48:28] now the message explains that if we're
[48:30] predestined nothing can stop it from
[48:33] happening
[48:35] and we believe that
[48:37] and we want
[48:38] we all want to rally behind that that's
[48:40] this great understanding but the message
[48:42] also teaches us that our nature will be
[48:45] conformed to the image of christ
[48:49] it's in our daily walk how we handle
[48:51] life how we conduct ourselves
[48:54] this is all in the message of the hour
[48:56] but it's hid from those now listen to
[48:59] this who enjoy selective hearing
[49:05] you're only listening for what you want
[49:06] to listen for
[49:09] you only want to say amen to the things
[49:12] that you enjoy about the message
[49:14] but as the bride is predestined we've
[49:17] got to adhere to even the hardest things
[49:20] that the prophet said that this gospel
[49:22] said that jesus said
[49:25] you have to
[49:28] now romans 8 28 one of our favorite
[49:30] scriptures we know that all things work
[49:32] together for the good to them that love
[49:33] god
[49:34] to them who are called according to his
[49:36] purpose now i believe when brother
[49:38] brennan brings this out this a threefold
[49:41] purpose this is the purpose
[49:46] and we'll get into it
[49:48] the degree of love that's being defined
[49:51] here is according to his purpose to them
[49:54] who are called according to his
[49:56] purpose because brother brian says you
[49:59] can love god every day and still go to
[50:00] hell
[50:02] it's not just saying i love god but it
[50:05] has to be to the degree that you
[50:08] you are called to the purpose of his his
[50:11] his threefold purpose that he's called
[50:14] to get restored back to the kingdom god
[50:16] don't want us to remain the way we are
[50:18] we have to become in his image
[50:20] [Music]
[50:22] and it takes that love to do that
[50:24] because only the love of god in you
[50:27] is going to make you deny your flesh
[50:32] right they overcame by the land by the
[50:34] word of the testimony they love not
[50:35] their lives unto the death that that
[50:38] love for god has to be so strong that
[50:40] you're willing to bring your your body
[50:42] under subjection and obey the word of
[50:44] god and and
[50:46] and start putting this into action
[50:51] you know we may not have to uh
[50:56] face the red sea
[50:58] and and giants in the promised land
[51:00] but we heard last service
[51:02] we got our own giants
[51:06] and we got to face those things not
[51:08] ignore them
[51:09] i'll live over here they'll you know
[51:12] coexistence
[51:14] can't do that
[51:18] we've got to love god with all of our
[51:20] will all of our mind all of our our
[51:23] heart our spirit our might our soul our
[51:26] strength
[51:28] and in order to do that we got to die
[51:30] daily amen it takes that amount of love
[51:34] to fulfill god's second full purpose
[51:38] which is that to have the preeminence in
[51:39] us
[51:42] there's no other way
[51:43] because he's not going to force himself
[51:45] in our life
[51:47] we've got to invite him we got to kick
[51:49] out the trash we got to we got to show
[51:51] god
[51:52] this is a part this is a relationship
[52:00] that's what the rich young ruler was
[52:01] missing
[52:05] what what must i
[52:08] what must i do give up everything the
[52:10] same thing we do
[52:13] let god be preeminent in your life
[52:17] but the rich young ruler didn't allow
[52:21] christ to be preeminent in his life
[52:24] right
[52:26] this
[52:28] it's got to happen amen
[52:31] the bible says
[52:33] all things work together for the good to
[52:35] them that love god
[52:38] why
[52:39] because you love them so much you've
[52:41] given them control
[52:43] you've given them preeminence in your
[52:44] life so in other words everything that's
[52:47] transpiring god's
[52:49] in front of it orchestrating it allowing
[52:51] it
[52:53] and everything that god does is good
[52:56] everything he did in genesis was good
[52:58] everything that he does today is good he
[52:59] don't do any bad things
[53:01] he don't do shady things
[53:03] that's why you know it's going to work
[53:05] out for the good because god's behind it
[53:09] giving god preeminence in your life
[53:13] is the key to being conformed into the
[53:16] image of god amen
[53:18] amen now the third purpose of god's
[53:21] threefold purpose is to restore his
[53:23] kingdom
[53:26] ultimately god wants to bring us back to
[53:28] the way that things originally were in
[53:31] the garden
[53:33] and in the garden he had preeminence
[53:39] he had preeminence until eve
[53:43] decided not to obey
[53:48] restoration has always been in the mind
[53:51] of christ from the very beginning amen
[53:55] so this is the the third part of god's
[53:58] eternal purpose
[54:00] is to restore his kingdom back
[54:02] think about it all all the way from the
[54:04] garden through everything that we read
[54:06] the old testament everything in the new
[54:07] testament everything that's happening
[54:09] now us kind of looking towards what's
[54:11] you know what what's going to be
[54:12] happening uh when tribulation sets in
[54:16] god has this threefold purpose in mind
[54:19] and he wants to bring a restoration to
[54:22] his kingdom
[54:24] and we're part of that
[54:26] we're a part of that amen
[54:29] isn't that beautiful
[54:32] that's why you could say i know the
[54:33] thoughts i think towards you saith the
[54:35] lord
[54:36] thoughts of peace not of evil to but to
[54:39] give us an expected in
[54:41] so god wants to restore us
[54:44] he wants to reveal to us that he is a
[54:46] restorer
[54:48] he wants to express himself as a
[54:50] restorer he he doesn't give up on you he
[54:53] doesn't quit he doesn't stop he he he
[54:56] keeps going on because that's what the
[54:58] love of god does it bears all things it
[55:00] endures all things it holds all things
[55:02] it doesn't quit
[55:04] that's why we need to have confidence
[55:06] that he which have begun a good work
[55:07] he's going to he's going to perform it
[55:09] unto the day of jesus christ
[55:13] remember when boaz took ruth to be his
[55:15] wife in ruth chapter 4 verse 14 the
[55:18] bible says and the woman said unto naomi
[55:20] blessed be the lord which have not left
[55:23] thee this day without a kinsmen
[55:27] that his name may be
[55:29] famous in israel
[55:32] and he shall be unto thee what a
[55:34] restorer of life
[55:37] and a nourisher of thine own age for thy
[55:39] daughter-in-law which loveth thee which
[55:42] is better to thee than seven sons have
[55:44] borne him
[55:46] god has not left us today without a
[55:49] kinsmen amen and i'll tell you his name
[55:51] is famous in israel his name is famous
[55:53] in fenton michigan
[55:56] and he shall be unto thee a restorer of
[55:59] life god wants
[56:01] us to know that he's a restorer it's
[56:03] part of him now why am i going through
[56:05] this because we have to become that we
[56:08] have to become a restorer
[56:14] in order for restoration to take place
[56:16] we have to do our part
[56:19] if we want god to restore his image
[56:22] inside of us
[56:24] to restore us back to to
[56:28] acting the way he acts and handling
[56:30] things the way he handles them
[56:33] to turn the cheek to go the extra mile
[56:36] we have to learn
[56:38] to do our part first
[56:39] to lay down our life to deny our will
[56:43] to to to not give in to what this flesh
[56:46] wants to do pretty much on a
[56:48] continual basis
[56:50] it's the only way restoration because we
[56:53] can't be restored going to church two
[56:54] times a week and say i hope that just
[56:56] gets the job done it will not get the
[56:58] job done
[56:59] because this is a realness between us
[57:01] and god
[57:04] your people she said shall be my people
[57:07] your god shall be my god that's the
[57:09] attitude we need to take we hear the
[57:12] word of god this is for me this is what
[57:14] you believe this is what i believe this
[57:16] is what the prophet said this is what i
[57:18] believe
[57:20] psalms 23 verse 1 the lord is my
[57:23] shepherd
[57:25] i shall
[57:27] not
[57:28] want why does everybody skip over that
[57:30] part
[57:31] he maketh me look at this he maketh me
[57:34] to lay down the green passage he leads
[57:36] me beside steel boys he restoreth my
[57:38] soul he leads me in the paths of
[57:40] righteousness for my name's sake when we
[57:43] give god preeminence he has his way in
[57:48] us
[57:50] bible says we're the spirit of the lord
[57:52] is there's liberty
[57:55] but you have to do your first part i
[57:58] shall not want
[58:00] amen
[58:02] when god told you to go to church you
[58:03] can't say i don't want
[58:06] to god says it's time to pray a little
[58:09] bit more than you've been praying you
[58:11] can't say i don't want to right amen
[58:13] if
[58:15] where we learn to let god have the
[58:18] preeminence in the church is we learn to
[58:20] let god have preeminence in our homes
[58:24] in our personal lives
[58:28] we don't want to grow in knowledge right
[58:31] right because satan wants to offer us
[58:33] the bogus which is the knowledge of the
[58:35] revelation we want to grow
[58:38] in the revelation
[58:40] of the truth
[58:42] yes the violence is grow in knowledge
[58:45] but not the knowledge
[58:46] of the revelation
[58:48] the true knowledge of christ
[58:50] because there's an ever learning but
[58:52] never coming to the knowledge of the
[58:54] truth
[58:58] acts chapter 1 verse 6.
[59:00] and it's okay if uh you know we say
[59:03] the more we sit in the back the less
[59:04] amends are here
[59:06] go out there take out the last two rolls
[59:08] and get you up closer you say amen
[59:12] acts chapter one verse six and when
[59:14] their when they therefore come together
[59:16] they asked him asked of him saying lord
[59:19] will thou at this time
[59:22] restore again the kingdom to israel
[59:27] and he said unto them look at the answer
[59:30] it is not for you to know the times or
[59:32] the seasons
[59:33] which the father put into his own power
[59:38] in other words stop trying to figure out
[59:40] russia
[59:41] stop trying to figure out china
[59:44] stop trying to figure out rome and the
[59:46] antichrist and and and when the
[59:48] tribulation and and and when the bombs
[59:51] are going to go and when the california
[59:53] is going to drop off
[59:56] stop trying to figure it out
[59:58] you want to figure something out try to
[1:00:00] figure out how to get more into christ's
[1:00:02] image that's where you should be trying
[1:00:04] to figure out how to become more like
[1:00:06] him dressed in his righteousness
[1:00:09] fulfilling his purpose
[1:00:14] because we i'm not against those things
[1:00:16] but what i am against
[1:00:19] is is it really has god really given
[1:00:22] that to you to know if he does he'll
[1:00:24] just show it to you seek ye first the
[1:00:26] kingdom and his righteousness and let
[1:00:29] god take care of the rest
[1:00:32] now look what he said here but you shall
[1:00:33] receive power after the holy ghost has
[1:00:36] come upon you and you shall be witnesses
[1:00:38] for me both in jerusalem and judea and
[1:00:40] sumerian into the other most parts of
[1:00:42] the earth so what has he given him power
[1:00:44] for right now to fulfill the third part
[1:00:47] of his eternal purpose
[1:00:49] which is to restore the kingdom
[1:00:51] it isn't restoring a house
[1:00:54] the kingdom is man
[1:00:56] he lives in man
[1:01:03] i didn't want to say anything in our
[1:01:06] in our men's meeting
[1:01:08] but some of the same scriptures
[1:01:13] that brother
[1:01:14] roger talked about he did such a i feel
[1:01:16] a really good job
[1:01:18] in the men's meeting today
[1:01:21] talking to us about the importance of
[1:01:23] discipling amen
[1:01:26] and that's what this restoration is all
[1:01:28] about
[1:01:29] that's the part that we play
[1:01:32] god has given us power to fulfill his
[1:01:36] eternal purpose the part that we play
[1:01:38] we can't do anything about the first
[1:01:40] part because that was god
[1:01:43] in christ the fullness of the godhead
[1:01:45] was we didn't have nothing to do with
[1:01:46] that
[1:01:50] all of god was poured into christ but
[1:01:53] christ
[1:01:54] had to die out
[1:01:56] in order for the father to have
[1:01:57] preenamous the bible says he humbled
[1:01:59] himself and became obedient
[1:02:01] even
[1:02:03] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:02:05] the cross
[1:02:06] so
[1:02:08] imagine
[1:02:09] you know jesus got the flesh of jesus
[1:02:11] got his way
[1:02:12] and he said father there's some other
[1:02:15] way you know just i'm going to call for
[1:02:16] 12 legions of angels right now
[1:02:21] so our flesh this is a real situation
[1:02:24] with us a lot of times we don't want to
[1:02:26] die out
[1:02:27] you know we're looking for another way
[1:02:30] to be bright to make it in to to claim
[1:02:33] some predestination without becoming
[1:02:35] into the image of christ but the only
[1:02:37] way we can is we got to let god have
[1:02:39] pray on us we got to die out to our
[1:02:40] flesh it's got to be a real situation to
[1:02:43] us
[1:02:47] now we have a major role a major role to
[1:02:51] play in god's second part of this
[1:02:52] threefold
[1:02:53] purpose
[1:02:55] as christ
[1:02:57] christ cannot have preeminence in the
[1:03:00] church
[1:03:01] unless we allow it
[1:03:04] that's why some people can sit in church
[1:03:06] for years and never change
[1:03:09] here the word goes in one ear and out
[1:03:10] the other
[1:03:12] why some people hear the word in a short
[1:03:14] time their life is changing it's like
[1:03:16] wow wow wow wow
[1:03:20] because there's a realness that's taking
[1:03:22] place right
[1:03:25] the bible says that the word
[1:03:27] effectively
[1:03:29] works in those who believe it i'm
[1:03:31] paraphrasing that verse but you know
[1:03:33] what you've heard it before
[1:03:36] christ cannot be preowned in our life
[1:03:39] unless we learn on a regular basis to
[1:03:42] yield to practice it every day
[1:03:45] have thine own way lord we sung about it
[1:03:48] and that last verse we sung it twice
[1:03:50] till till people see christ only always
[1:03:53] in us that's only gonna happen if we're
[1:03:55] yielding to the lord because it's not a
[1:03:57] popular situation
[1:04:02] you will be put to the test
[1:04:08] people will come against you
[1:04:13] if god never becomes preeminent in us
[1:04:15] his third
[1:04:18] part
[1:04:19] his third part of that purpose
[1:04:21] will never be fulfilled in us
[1:04:24] and if it's never fulfilled in us we'll
[1:04:26] never be able to help fulfill his
[1:04:29] purpose now understand this is all about
[1:04:32] us being a part of god's great purpose
[1:04:35] that started at the beginning to the end
[1:04:37] that's what we're talking about
[1:04:39] you know we are in our own lives we do
[1:04:41] our own things we got our own things
[1:04:43] going our own goals and we want to
[1:04:46] we come to church with our own thoughts
[1:04:48] of what we want
[1:04:50] i i'm not against any of it
[1:04:53] but the mind of god is so much greater
[1:04:56] than that
[1:04:58] it and it we're extending into
[1:05:02] an eternal purpose that god had in his
[1:05:04] mind that he's still there he's still
[1:05:05] thinking about it when we leave church
[1:05:07] we lead church we're going to go to our
[1:05:08] own things but i'll tell you in god's
[1:05:10] mind he's still thinking about the
[1:05:12] restoration that needs to take place
[1:05:19] when god's mind is preeminent us we will
[1:05:21] be working to carry out his eternal
[1:05:24] purpose
[1:05:26] when god's mind is preeminent us that's
[1:05:28] the name of
[1:05:30] the message
[1:05:35] we will be working at carrying out his
[1:05:38] eternal purpose think about what you've
[1:05:40] been
[1:05:41] carrying out
[1:05:43] and when it's not
[1:05:45] you know what we'll be carrying out our
[1:05:46] purposes
[1:05:48] our plans what we got going
[1:05:50] how we're going to do things
[1:05:53] if god's mind isn't preeminent
[1:05:56] we will be totally distracted
[1:05:59] from carrying out god's purpose
[1:06:03] but if god's mind is preeminent
[1:06:06] we'll simply be carrying out his purpose
[1:06:08] so it's it's important not just to have
[1:06:11] the mind of christ in part
[1:06:15] but to be walking with it to be asking
[1:06:19] god lord i don't want anything but
[1:06:22] you're minding me
[1:06:23] because as soon as we start talking
[1:06:25] about this and doing that you know
[1:06:26] what's gonna happen
[1:06:28] you're gonna forget all about the
[1:06:29] restoration of his kingdom
[1:06:32] well brother john it's not my
[1:06:35] part
[1:06:37] it's not my job to be a part of the
[1:06:39] restoration
[1:06:40] that's
[1:06:42] that's not the right attitude
[1:06:44] turn with me if you would do second
[1:06:46] corinthians chapter five second
[1:06:48] corinthians chapter five i wanna start
[1:06:49] with verse number eight
[1:06:54] now we are confident i say and willing
[1:06:57] rather to be absent from the body and to
[1:07:00] be present with the lord
[1:07:03] boy we all could say that now
[1:07:06] right i just want to get out of here
[1:07:10] he goes on to say wherefore
[1:07:12] we labor
[1:07:14] that we
[1:07:15] that whether we
[1:07:17] we present that whether present or
[1:07:19] absent
[1:07:21] we may be accepted of him
[1:07:25] so
[1:07:26] now i don't believe works get you to
[1:07:28] heaven
[1:07:30] but paul's making a statement here
[1:07:34] that god don't like lazy people
[1:07:39] and if you want to be accepted whether
[1:07:41] you're present or absent you need to
[1:07:44] labor
[1:07:45] just laying the foundation here
[1:07:48] so he says for we must all appear before
[1:07:51] the judgment of the seat of christ
[1:07:53] that we that everyone may receive the
[1:07:55] things he'd done in his body according
[1:07:56] to what he has
[1:07:57] according to that he have done whether
[1:07:59] it be good or bad
[1:08:03] i'll just say it like this
[1:08:06] you may define your purposes in life
[1:08:10] as not bad
[1:08:14] but
[1:08:14] i'll say like this brother branham said
[1:08:18] you're always in the will of god when
[1:08:21] you're doing missionary work
[1:08:24] because it's part of
[1:08:27] the threefold purpose it's the
[1:08:28] restoration of the kingdom
[1:08:31] now we all got things we've all got
[1:08:33] hobbies we all got lots of aspirations
[1:08:36] and things that we're going to be doing
[1:08:38] but somewhere down the line
[1:08:40] we got to give an account for our labors
[1:08:44] are you with me
[1:08:45] okay now look at keep the same theme
[1:08:47] going because that's what it is it ain't
[1:08:48] something different
[1:08:50] knowing therefore the terror of the lord
[1:08:52] that we're really going to be before the
[1:08:53] lord
[1:08:55] we
[1:08:56] persuade men
[1:08:58] now we're going right to
[1:09:00] this restoration it's not about us
[1:09:03] anymore it's not about us in the image
[1:09:05] of christ
[1:09:07] it's not just about us saying we're
[1:09:08] predestinated right it's now about us
[1:09:11] working at persuading somebody
[1:09:15] that howl's right around the corner
[1:09:20] he says but we are made manifest unto
[1:09:23] god and i trust also are made manifest
[1:09:27] in your conscience
[1:09:28] for we commend not ourselves again unto
[1:09:30] you but give you occasion to glory on
[1:09:32] our behalf that
[1:09:34] he may have you may have somewhat to
[1:09:36] answer them which glory and appearance
[1:09:38] and not in heart
[1:09:40] he always got that there's three types
[1:09:42] of believers in every church
[1:09:44] for whether we be beside ourselves
[1:09:47] it is to god or whether we sober it is
[1:09:50] for your cause
[1:09:52] for the love of christ
[1:09:55] constraineth us
[1:09:57] you see that brother roger is that what
[1:09:59] you said in the men's meeting
[1:10:01] what does it constrain us to do to
[1:10:03] persuade men
[1:10:04] amen
[1:10:08] something inside of us
[1:10:10] knowing the terror of the lord this is a
[1:10:11] real situation hell is real
[1:10:18] there's no other way for a person to
[1:10:20] make it outside of jesus christ
[1:10:25] this is a real situation so everybody's
[1:10:28] opinion out there in the world as well
[1:10:30] is much looser than that
[1:10:32] and it's our job to convince them
[1:10:37] if we don't convince them they
[1:10:39] we may be god's mouthpiece to them
[1:10:41] the only mouthpiece we don't know we
[1:10:43] don't know what's going to happen after
[1:10:44] you leave that situation
[1:10:47] but it's a serious thing and here's the
[1:10:49] thing the love in your heart wants to
[1:10:51] see that person who isn't where they
[1:10:53] need to be restored
[1:10:57] restored
[1:10:59] because it's part of god's purpose see
[1:11:01] it's you're you've
[1:11:03] you gave up your mind you've taken on
[1:11:05] the mind of christ when you have the
[1:11:07] mind of christ he's thinking about his
[1:11:09] eternal purpose
[1:11:11] this is the problem we take our mind we
[1:11:13] go through the course of the week and we
[1:11:15] go do our own thing we come back to
[1:11:16] church and we try to understand what in
[1:11:18] the world's going on spiritually and we
[1:11:20] there's too much disconnect
[1:11:23] we got to stay focused it ain't changing
[1:11:27] god's eternal purpose ain't changing in
[1:11:29] 2023
[1:11:32] still on track from the beginning
[1:11:36] because we thus judge that if one died
[1:11:39] for all then we're all dead
[1:11:42] in other words
[1:11:44] we're not in control
[1:11:46] love controls us now
[1:11:49] when we become dead to ourself and his
[1:11:52] love moves us
[1:11:54] to live
[1:11:55] for
[1:11:56] others to to help them to see that the
[1:12:00] direction they're going
[1:12:02] isn't
[1:12:03] going to lead them to a happy ending
[1:12:08] a couple quotes i want to read i got a
[1:12:10] bunch of quotes tonight i hope that's
[1:12:11] okay
[1:12:13] brother branham said remembering the
[1:12:14] lord he says if you dwell in love you
[1:12:17] dwell in god and for god is love
[1:12:20] they that dwell in god dwell in love see
[1:12:23] and love has no hatred it has no
[1:12:27] jealousy it's not puffed up love does
[1:12:29] not behave itself uh misbehave itself
[1:12:32] love is always
[1:12:35] gentle sweet forgiving kind no matter
[1:12:39] how bitter the other is
[1:12:42] love remains
[1:12:44] itself
[1:12:46] in other words we don't have an excuse
[1:12:48] anymore why we acted the wrong way
[1:12:51] when we don't act the right way i'm
[1:12:53] sorry that wasn't the love of god
[1:12:56] and that's it shows this is a perfect
[1:12:59] example of how we need to let god be
[1:13:02] preeminent in us or will never manifest
[1:13:05] his image
[1:13:07] now i love this brother brahm says
[1:13:10] love is the ultimate of grace
[1:13:15] we're saved by grace
[1:13:17] love is the ultimate of grace love is
[1:13:21] god's ultimately for us i don't know
[1:13:24] what that word means i didn't look it up
[1:13:27] but you're catching the
[1:13:28] the theme here the
[1:13:30] spirit after all other gifts and things
[1:13:33] have vanished our prophecies or tongues
[1:13:35] or interpretations all that we've ever
[1:13:37] done or what more when love comes in
[1:13:40] it's the ultimate it's above all
[1:13:43] because all others fail
[1:13:46] but it's the supreme court decision amen
[1:13:50] love is the supreme court that's why
[1:13:52] love can cover a multitude of sin amen
[1:13:56] it's the thai post it's the north star
[1:13:58] that keeps the the semen level
[1:14:03] it's the compass that guides us love is
[1:14:05] the ultimate he said let's remember it
[1:14:07] amen brother brandon said in one place
[1:14:09] he said when divine love
[1:14:11] has been
[1:14:12] projected and comes to its end
[1:14:17] if it's real divine love
[1:14:20] its destination
[1:14:22] sovereign grace will then take over
[1:14:26] so we have a part to play
[1:14:28] we just can't expect well if they're
[1:14:30] gods if you know something between them
[1:14:33] and god
[1:14:34] what is that
[1:14:35] what about god and you
[1:14:37] what about manifesting the image
[1:14:40] why you put it on god's shoulders when
[1:14:42] it should be you that should be yielding
[1:14:44] yourself to god more
[1:14:47] somebody's got to shine in this this
[1:14:50] hour
[1:14:51] somebody's got to say
[1:14:52] if it's for nobody lord this word is for
[1:14:55] me
[1:14:58] verse 15
[1:15:00] and that he died for all and they which
[1:15:02] live should not henceforth
[1:15:05] live unto themselves
[1:15:07] but unto him which died for them and
[1:15:09] rose again now here's the problem with
[1:15:11] this
[1:15:11] we live we're all living for god right
[1:15:14] just like we all love god
[1:15:16] but are we all living for god with
[1:15:17] everything we got right
[1:15:21] i mean if i live for god five minutes
[1:15:23] i'm still living for god
[1:15:26] but is that the message that is teaching
[1:15:28] us so we all have to do the
[1:15:30] self-evaluation when the word is being
[1:15:32] preached we have to say lord
[1:15:34] am i living unto myself
[1:15:38] we have to do it if we don't do it how's
[1:15:40] the lord going to speak to us
[1:15:45] all right so think about this we should
[1:15:47] not
[1:15:49] uh
[1:15:50] live
[1:15:51] on to ourselves but unto him that died
[1:15:54] for us and rose again now what is how do
[1:15:56] we how do we live unto him
[1:15:58] that means we're laboring
[1:16:00] we're a servant of christ
[1:16:02] we're laboring
[1:16:04] and god will hold us accountable to our
[1:16:06] laboring that's what paul started out
[1:16:08] when we started reading this we're all
[1:16:10] going to stand before the judgment seat
[1:16:12] of christ
[1:16:13] god is watching if we're living
[1:16:16] for ourselves or if we're living for
[1:16:18] souls are we occupying our time with
[1:16:22] saving souls persuading men convincing
[1:16:25] men or
[1:16:28] are we spending our time fulfilling our
[1:16:30] purpose
[1:16:32] so what is the image of christ in you
[1:16:34] today
[1:16:36] what is the image of christ in you today
[1:16:39] verse 16 wherefore henceforth know we
[1:16:42] know man after the flesh yeah though we
[1:16:43] have known christ after the flesh yet
[1:16:46] now henceforth know we him no more
[1:16:48] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[1:16:51] a new creature old things are passed
[1:16:54] away behold all things are become new
[1:17:03] once we have
[1:17:05] given god preeminence in our life
[1:17:11] he will make a new creature out of us
[1:17:14] he will not let us to remain the same
[1:17:17] because our flesh all flesh is just
[1:17:20] stinky to him
[1:17:23] our thoughts that's why we got to repent
[1:17:24] of our thoughts
[1:17:26] because that's not pleasing to him but
[1:17:30] when we give him preeminence
[1:17:32] then our nature changes just like jesus
[1:17:35] christ
[1:17:37] and we'll do we'll finish the work
[1:17:41] jesus
[1:17:42] said i come to do the work of my father
[1:17:46] and uh
[1:17:48] it pleased him that i i worked for him
[1:17:50] and he said at the on the cross
[1:17:53] it's finished he did his his part
[1:17:57] now the holy ghost is working through us
[1:18:01] to finish the work
[1:18:04] to finish the work
[1:18:10] all right verse 18
[1:18:13] and all things are of god
[1:18:17] all things now are of god he's got the
[1:18:20] preeminence
[1:18:21] who have reconciled us to himself by
[1:18:23] jesus christ and what happens as soon as
[1:18:26] we give him preeminence or he takes
[1:18:28] preeminence and all things are of god in
[1:18:30] her life he gives us the ministry
[1:18:34] of restoring
[1:18:37] fulfilling the third part of god's
[1:18:40] eternal purpose amen christ the mystery
[1:18:43] of god revealed this is that love affair
[1:18:45] we
[1:18:46] we start bringing the word to someone
[1:18:49] who's lost something inside of us
[1:18:52] can't stand them seeing being lost
[1:18:56] the more preeminent god is in a man the
[1:18:59] more he will use him to restore others
[1:19:02] brother branham said something like this
[1:19:05] if god could just get one man in his
[1:19:07] hands he turned the world upside down
[1:19:09] and he referred
[1:19:10] uh to moses in egypt
[1:19:14] but
[1:19:14] what did the mind of christ do in moses
[1:19:18] it delivered the people it restored the
[1:19:21] people
[1:19:23] and if god just has complete control he
[1:19:26] will take your body he will take your
[1:19:28] mind he will take your talents and he
[1:19:30] will go restore some soul
[1:19:33] amen he's not going to put you off in
[1:19:35] the court saying oh it doesn't matter
[1:19:36] you don't have to do that
[1:19:38] no we need a vision
[1:19:40] we need a vision without a vision
[1:19:42] there's so many people that will perish
[1:19:48] we need a revelation of the image of
[1:19:50] christ
[1:19:53] what did the mind of christ do in those
[1:19:55] disciples yeah he taught them for three
[1:19:57] and a half years but he still could not
[1:19:59] entrust them to go witness until they
[1:20:02] received him inside of them
[1:20:05] think about that
[1:20:12] but soon as the holy ghost came inside
[1:20:14] of them they started restoring
[1:20:19] they started bringing people to to jesus
[1:20:21] christ they
[1:20:23] started getting people to repent and get
[1:20:25] baptized he started restoring the
[1:20:27] kingdom back what was it the first day
[1:20:30] 5000 were saved they were restoring the
[1:20:32] kingdom was being restored and today the
[1:20:35] kingdom is still being restored he's
[1:20:36] just looking for restorers
[1:20:39] he's looking for the church that will
[1:20:41] give him preeminence to keep working and
[1:20:43] restoring
[1:20:45] but the devil is trying to get us just
[1:20:46] looking out in the world what's
[1:20:47] happening out here and this and that and
[1:20:50] you know
[1:20:51] building our reputation and our kingdom
[1:20:53] and doing this and can't wait for that
[1:20:55] and you know god's kingdom just
[1:21:00] god help us amen god help us we need a
[1:21:03] real media with god and
[1:21:05] where his presence comes down
[1:21:12] we need a a revelation of the image of
[1:21:15] christ the full image
[1:21:17] amen
[1:21:18] it's not just that god
[1:21:20] gives me everything i want or need or he
[1:21:23] supplies our needs or is my comforter
[1:21:26] and if this is how you view the image of
[1:21:28] christ
[1:21:30] then you need to do that for others
[1:21:36] if you think all god is is he's here to
[1:21:38] meet all my needs
[1:21:40] well then if you think that's the image
[1:21:42] of christ that's what you should be
[1:21:44] doing
[1:21:47] think about it
[1:21:49] we're predestined to be in his image
[1:21:55] the same image
[1:21:57] the bible says that
[1:21:59] uh
[1:22:00] christ laid down his life for us we
[1:22:01] ought to lay down our life for the
[1:22:03] brethren
[1:22:04] i mean i'm just i'm just expressing if
[1:22:06] that's part of the gospel that you
[1:22:08] believe that that's the image of christ
[1:22:10] then you ought to be doing that
[1:22:16] but in reality that's only part of the
[1:22:18] image of god
[1:22:20] brother branham said that god was not
[1:22:21] some daddy old grandpa that just gives
[1:22:23] you everything you want when you want it
[1:22:29] there's so more to the image of christ
[1:22:32] than that
[1:22:34] when all things are of god he gives us
[1:22:37] the ministry of reconciliation
[1:22:41] that means we have to go to work
[1:22:44] we actually have to go do something that
[1:22:47] isn't just for our flesh
[1:22:50] let's read verse 17 to with that god was
[1:22:52] in christ reconciling the world unto
[1:22:54] himself not imputing their trespasses
[1:22:57] unto them and had committed unto us
[1:23:01] the word of reconciliation he's given us
[1:23:04] the very word that we need to reconcile
[1:23:07] others
[1:23:09] you got to believe it
[1:23:11] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[1:23:13] remember
[1:23:14] remember
[1:23:15] you remember when the warning went out
[1:23:18] and
[1:23:19] our embassy uh they they pulled our
[1:23:21] embassy out of ukraine
[1:23:25] you know poland let's pull out our
[1:23:26] embassy
[1:23:28] everybody pulled their embassies out
[1:23:29] because ukraine was getting attacked
[1:23:33] you know i feel that sometimes as
[1:23:34] christians we pull the embassy out
[1:23:37] when the when the battle gets too tough
[1:23:39] and we're too afraid to represent the
[1:23:42] image of eternal love the love of god
[1:23:45] that lays down in his life at the time
[1:23:51] but we are ambassadors for christ as
[1:23:53] though god did beseech you by us we pray
[1:23:55] you in christ said now you get
[1:23:58] reconciled to god
[1:24:00] that's what we need to be doing get
[1:24:02] restored back to god he's restoring the
[1:24:04] kingdom amen
[1:24:06] for he have made him to be sin for us
[1:24:09] who knew no sin that we might be the
[1:24:11] maybe the righteousness of god
[1:24:14] in him
[1:24:17] it is this great image of christ when
[1:24:19] all things are passed away
[1:24:21] and all things are new and all things
[1:24:24] are of god that the divine love of god
[1:24:27] constrains
[1:24:28] us to go hunt out
[1:24:32] i'll say it like this our fallen
[1:24:33] brethren
[1:24:36] those who don't know christ or those
[1:24:39] maybe who slipped away from christ
[1:24:42] now the reason for this is because this
[1:24:45] is what god wants in the third part
[1:24:49] of his eternal purpose
[1:24:51] it's part of the restoration it's not us
[1:24:54] sitting back and just watching god
[1:24:58] restore
[1:25:01] somebody has to god has to be working
[1:25:03] through somebody
[1:25:05] there has to be missionaries there has
[1:25:07] to be people who go out and share the
[1:25:09] gospel there has to be somebody that
[1:25:11] believes go ye out
[1:25:13] somebody has to be a disciple
[1:25:19] now god has given each one of us
[1:25:22] the ministry of reconciliation
[1:25:26] every one of us
[1:25:30] he may have not given every one of us
[1:25:32] the opportunity to stand behind a pulpit
[1:25:35] and preach to somebody
[1:25:38] but he's given every one of us a chance
[1:25:40] to go out into the world
[1:25:44] and minister
[1:25:47] restore
[1:25:48] bring christ to them
[1:25:50] whether it's one-on-one you're having a
[1:25:52] bible study in your home you gather five
[1:25:54] people it doesn't matter what matters is
[1:25:58] that your motive needs to be restore
[1:26:01] them to christ
[1:26:06] brother branham said
[1:26:08] in the message my new ministry
[1:26:12] he said that's god that's part of god's
[1:26:14] program preaching
[1:26:17] is his program
[1:26:19] when we look upon when he looked upon
[1:26:21] the multitude he said the harvest is
[1:26:23] right the laborers are for you pray the
[1:26:25] lord of the harvest that he will send
[1:26:27] laborers into his harvest
[1:26:30] how many remember that congregation says
[1:26:32] amen
[1:26:35] well why would they have to pray to the
[1:26:38] lord of harvest to send laborers into
[1:26:40] the harvest if the lord of the harvest
[1:26:42] was standing right there knowing it
[1:26:44] would be done
[1:26:45] why does god want us to do that
[1:26:49] god has so arranged it
[1:26:52] he says now you listen to this
[1:26:55] god has so arranged it that his program
[1:26:58] cannot move without you and i
[1:27:04] as long as we're not doing what god is
[1:27:07] leading us to do we're paralyzing his
[1:27:09] program
[1:27:12] but when the church moves by the
[1:27:14] anointing of the holy ghost
[1:27:16] then we are in god's will we're doing
[1:27:19] his program
[1:27:21] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:27:24] god
[1:27:25] they are the sons of god
[1:27:27] god is leading us
[1:27:29] to fulfill his purpose amen not just
[1:27:32] leading me to
[1:27:33] buy my next car
[1:27:35] my next whatever
[1:27:37] but leading me to win a soul
[1:27:41] what is god leading us to do to fulfill
[1:27:44] his eternal purpose
[1:27:46] he doesn't want us
[1:27:48] paralyzing his program
[1:27:50] he's looking for believers that says i
[1:27:53] want to work use me lord amen
[1:27:56] amen
[1:27:58] i'll tell you the way that we
[1:28:00] we won't paralyze the program of god we
[1:28:02] have to learn every day to get up and
[1:28:04] say to deny yourself that day what you
[1:28:06] want to do
[1:28:08] you have to actually give yourself to
[1:28:09] god
[1:28:11] you have to say lord whatever you want
[1:28:13] me to do if it ain't in my mind i'll
[1:28:15] pray this moment you put it in my heart
[1:28:16] and mind what you want me to do
[1:28:20] the bible says we through the spirit we
[1:28:22] have to mortify the deeds of the flesh
[1:28:25] keep our body under subjection
[1:28:28] the ministry of reconciliation i just
[1:28:30] want to emphasize this is not just
[1:28:33] behind the pulpit
[1:28:40] brother ram said just one soul is worth
[1:28:42] ten thousand worlds
[1:28:46] remember he left the 99 when he went
[1:28:48] after the one
[1:28:50] think about that
[1:28:53] would we be out of god's will if we just
[1:28:55] left the pulpit and we went after one
[1:28:59] think about these these these thoughts
[1:29:02] we don't put enough emphasis on reaching
[1:29:04] out to somebody outside these doors we
[1:29:06] put too much emphasis behind the pulpit
[1:29:09] here
[1:29:11] look we need to take what we're hearing
[1:29:12] here and go do it amen amen
[1:29:16] we need to take what we're hearing here
[1:29:17] and go do it amen not just taking what
[1:29:20] we're hearing here and leave and then
[1:29:22] just wait to the next
[1:29:26] paul said the love of christ constrains
[1:29:28] us because we thus judge that if one
[1:29:30] died for all then we're all dead
[1:29:32] and that if he died for all
[1:29:35] they which live should not henceforth
[1:29:37] live unto themselves but unto him that
[1:29:39] died for him and rose again so what does
[1:29:42] paul do what does paul do
[1:29:45] he said in first corinthians 9 19
[1:29:48] think about this you could put you
[1:29:50] should about to put yourself in paul's
[1:29:51] shoes right here first corinthians 9 19
[1:29:54] for though i be free
[1:29:56] god jesus set me free
[1:29:58] though i be free from all men
[1:30:01] yet have i made myself
[1:30:04] servant unto all
[1:30:08] and why is that because i'm not one of
[1:30:10] those people that says i'm in i only
[1:30:12] care about me something inside of me the
[1:30:14] love of christ constraineth me
[1:30:17] that i might gain the more
[1:30:20] i want to
[1:30:22] duplicate myself brother roger
[1:30:26] amen
[1:30:27] and unto the jews i became as a jew that
[1:30:30] i might gain the jews to them that are
[1:30:31] under the laws as under the law that i
[1:30:33] might gain them that are under the law
[1:30:35] to them that are without the law as
[1:30:37] without the law uh being not without law
[1:30:40] to god but under the law of christ that
[1:30:42] i might gain them that are without the
[1:30:44] law to the weak became as weak that i
[1:30:47] might gain the weak i am made all things
[1:30:49] to all men that i might by all means
[1:30:52] whatever it takes save some
[1:30:56] paul knew the odds were against him that
[1:30:59] when he went out to deliver jesus christ
[1:31:02] to somebody that the majority of them
[1:31:04] was going to
[1:31:07] not just reject him
[1:31:09] but tear down his reputation
[1:31:13] want to kill him want to stone him
[1:31:16] the majority think about it
[1:31:20] i know we're hunting for the seed but
[1:31:22] except the majority won't take it
[1:31:26] but will you make a sir make yourself a
[1:31:28] servant unto everybody
[1:31:30] make that world your parish
[1:31:32] go out there and whoever you see share
[1:31:35] christ with him
[1:31:37] time is running out amen i don't want to
[1:31:39] be sitting here just waiting for the
[1:31:41] coming of the lord when god wants me out
[1:31:43] there getting that last seed
[1:31:46] now i'm not saying the last seed is
[1:31:49] going to come from fenton
[1:31:51] but you know every one of us has the
[1:31:53] last seed we're going to get amen
[1:31:55] every one of us has a last seed we're
[1:31:57] going to get
[1:31:59] and we should be thinking about that
[1:32:01] ministry
[1:32:04] and feeling that
[1:32:06] that love just swell up in a heart for
[1:32:08] that
[1:32:09] god never intended to give us the holy
[1:32:11] ghost just to satisfy ourselves
[1:32:14] it was to lead us into all truth and
[1:32:16] part of that truth i'll say it like this
[1:32:18] is to help fulfill the the eternal
[1:32:21] purpose of god and to restore his
[1:32:23] kingdom
[1:32:24] the kingdom is in people it's in the
[1:32:26] hearts of people
[1:32:30] brother brandon said in the message
[1:32:32] what was the holy ghost given for
[1:32:36] he said that's the purpose of the holy
[1:32:37] ghost it's the father again god the
[1:32:40] father dwelling in you working out his
[1:32:42] plans to finish his plan of redemption
[1:32:47] just think of that statement you don't
[1:32:49] have to believe me but believe the
[1:32:51] prophet
[1:32:52] he just said everything that i said
[1:32:55] listen the purpose of the holy ghost is
[1:32:57] the father again god the father dwelling
[1:33:00] in you
[1:33:01] working out his plan to finish his plan
[1:33:05] of redemption amen working through you
[1:33:08] making you
[1:33:10] a co-worker with him
[1:33:12] giving you a place
[1:33:14] giving you
[1:33:15] part
[1:33:16] a part for your fallen lost brother and
[1:33:20] sister
[1:33:21] giving you the spirit and his love to go
[1:33:24] hunt the lost as he did in the garden of
[1:33:27] eden adam adam where art thou
[1:33:30] kathy betty shoe tom where art thou
[1:33:35] i don't know your name sir i don't know
[1:33:37] your name madam but where art thou are
[1:33:40] you in christ
[1:33:43] to finish the plan made you a co-worker
[1:33:46] think about it is that real if you can
[1:33:48] believe it the problem is we're filling
[1:33:51] our mind with the news we're filling our
[1:33:53] mind with all of our plans
[1:33:55] instead of working on god's plan of
[1:33:57] redemption
[1:33:58] we're working on our own plans
[1:34:02] he said that's what the holy spirit does
[1:34:05] to a man or a woman and i'll say it like
[1:34:07] this that's what the holy ghost does to
[1:34:09] a man or woman where that man or woman
[1:34:11] gives the holy ghost preeminence
[1:34:15] when it strikes into their heart and
[1:34:17] takes a bold there's a thirsting and a
[1:34:20] hungering for lost souls
[1:34:25] your flesh is probably not going to like
[1:34:26] me after this service
[1:34:29] i'll bet we'll probably get some
[1:34:31] thoughts on the way home
[1:34:34] i know the devil
[1:34:36] it's the devil
[1:34:39] he said and that's what's the matter
[1:34:41] with the meetings today there's not
[1:34:43] enough spirit touch to it to go for
[1:34:46] souls of the lost and the dying it's
[1:34:48] more about let's make them let's make a
[1:34:51] name for ourselves a church a building a
[1:34:53] denomination instead of a soul-winning
[1:34:55] program he said how predictable he said
[1:34:57] we can say a lot on that
[1:35:00] in the message christ is a mystery of
[1:35:02] god can i keep going i just got some
[1:35:04] quotes i think would be really helpful
[1:35:06] for us
[1:35:08] brother brahm said it's a revelation
[1:35:10] it's the eternal it's as eternal as
[1:35:13] god's word is eternal look but the
[1:35:16] three-fold purpose of god's great
[1:35:19] mystery is revealed
[1:35:21] god's manifested in christ christ
[1:35:24] manifested in the church in order to
[1:35:28] redeem the lost eve back to the original
[1:35:31] condition in the garden of eden see
[1:35:34] we're at brother branton says man has
[1:35:36] always had a hard time he's always
[1:35:38] looked about look past what what christ
[1:35:40] has did for him or he's always looking
[1:35:42] to the future what he's going to do and
[1:35:44] he's missing what god's trying to do for
[1:35:46] him right now
[1:35:47] and we've got to see i know it's not in
[1:35:50] the newspapers it's not on fox news and
[1:35:52] we're not hearing it from our brothers
[1:35:53] and sisters we're not hearing it from
[1:35:55] our family members but i'll tell you god
[1:35:56] is here and he's letting us know that
[1:35:58] he's in the midst of fulfilling
[1:36:00] restoring his kingdom and he's looking
[1:36:02] for laborers today
[1:36:05] i believe it with all my heart
[1:36:10] a man running from the presence of the
[1:36:11] lord i've read this quote a number of
[1:36:13] times he says how wishy-washy that's
[1:36:16] what too many christians are today
[1:36:17] they're so soft-soaked and everything
[1:36:19] until they think all they have to do is
[1:36:20] go join a church go in somewhere put
[1:36:23] their name on the book and do a little
[1:36:24] something jump up and down shout out
[1:36:27] or something like that call it
[1:36:29] christianity
[1:36:31] he said christianity
[1:36:33] is in every day
[1:36:35] so think outside
[1:36:37] of the church here
[1:36:39] it's in every day it's a rugged life
[1:36:42] living for god in this present world
[1:36:47] not the future world the present world
[1:36:50] he said it's a constant burning of the
[1:36:52] fire and love of god right the love of
[1:36:54] god constrains us
[1:36:56] in the heart that sets you of fire and
[1:36:59] puts you out yonder with people and
[1:37:01] making converts for christ
[1:37:04] he said it's responsibilities he says we
[1:37:06] must accept our responsibility
[1:37:11] that's what it boils down to
[1:37:13] if god never gets preeminence in us he's
[1:37:16] we're never going to go out there
[1:37:17] hunting souls because we're just too
[1:37:18] busy doing our own things
[1:37:22] and i know this this may not be a
[1:37:23] message that makes us feel good but i
[1:37:25] want us to have the truth amen because
[1:37:27] it's god's gonna work through free more
[1:37:29] agency
[1:37:34] amen
[1:37:37] first corinthians 15 58
[1:37:44] we we want to occupy till jesus comes
[1:37:48] therefore my beloved brethren
[1:37:52] be steadfast
[1:37:54] unmovable
[1:37:56] always abounding in the work of the lord
[1:38:00] for as much as you know that your labor
[1:38:03] is not in vain
[1:38:05] in the lord
[1:38:08] think of all the things that you've done
[1:38:09] in life
[1:38:11] that you look back and said that was a
[1:38:13] waste time a waste of money a waste of
[1:38:16] effort that was a bad idea i shouldn't
[1:38:18] have done that
[1:38:21] but when it comes to working for the
[1:38:23] lord
[1:38:27] god's not forgetful he doesn't forget
[1:38:30] our labors but this is an hour when it's
[1:38:32] getting darker there's a very little
[1:38:34] light we need to work while we can
[1:38:36] because the night's coming when we won't
[1:38:38] be able to work but i don't think we're
[1:38:39] there yet right
[1:38:41] something inside of me says we need to
[1:38:43] be reaching out more amen we don't want
[1:38:45] to get comfortable in church
[1:38:48] don't get comfortable until you've got
[1:38:50] somebody sitting next to you that
[1:38:51] haven't been in church yet
[1:38:52] then get comfortable
[1:38:54] let's stand together god bless you
[1:38:58] i had like
[1:39:00] a couple pages of notes left
[1:39:04] i was just going over and brother
[1:39:05] branham was
[1:39:07] preaching and he had like 20 something
[1:39:09] pages left
[1:39:13] and it was at the end of the service
[1:39:18] much could be said on this great subject
[1:39:23] when god
[1:39:25] has the preeminence in our mind
[1:39:28] amen
[1:39:29] not just lending him to mind every now
[1:39:31] and then but has the preempts our goal
[1:39:34] is to get let god have preeminence and
[1:39:37] he'll use us
[1:39:39] to fulfill his his will is that your
[1:39:41] desire
[1:39:42] amen let's look to the lord in prayer
[1:39:45] our heavenly father
