[31:38] planted down deep inside of us lord that
[31:42] we would be um more faithful to you lord
[31:46] we thank you for these things we ask
[31:48] that lord you would meet
[31:50] needs that would be in our lives father
[31:52] that
[31:53] only you know about and father we ask
[31:55] that you would
[31:56] also encourage us strengthen us in this
[32:00] dark dark hour that we're living in
[32:02] we're lord that we
[32:04] can't find any hope at all uh in this
[32:07] world for any kind of comfort lord we're
[32:09] looking to you for that comfort
[32:11] that song is our of the saints had sung
[32:15] the only real peace i have is in you
[32:17] lord
[32:18] may that peace come to the ministry of
[32:20] the word may the healing come
[32:22] lord may the comfort come may all that
[32:24] we have need have come
[32:26] to the word as we believe it lord we
[32:28] commit the service now
[32:30] all of our hearts into your hands in the
[32:32] precious name
[32:33] of jesus christ amen amen
[32:37] here in hebrews chapter 2 starting with
[32:39] verse number 1 therefore
[32:42] we ought to give the more earnest
[32:45] heed to the things which we have heard
[32:49] lest at any time we should let them slip
[32:52] for if the word spoken by angels
[32:56] was steadfast and every transgression
[32:59] and disobedience received a just
[33:02] recompense
[33:03] of reward how shall we escape
[33:06] if we neglect so great of salvation
[33:08] which at the first began to be spoken
[33:11] by the lord and was confirmed unto us by
[33:14] them
[33:15] that heard him amen one more verse and
[33:19] god being
[33:20] and also god also being
[33:24] them bearing them witness
[33:27] both with signs and wonders and with
[33:29] divers miracles and gifts of the holy
[33:31] ghost according
[33:32] to his own will amen
[33:36] you may be seated now
[33:39] can i see just a raise of hands of of
[33:42] everyone that's
[33:43] neglected their walk with god in some
[33:46] time
[33:47] okay so the reason i did that is because
[33:50] it's important that that everybody
[33:53] feels at peace that this word that
[33:56] is going to be ministered is not
[33:59] directed at you
[34:02] it's important now we want to hear from
[34:04] god but we don't
[34:06] want to feel like anything's directed at
[34:08] us
[34:09] from the pulpit there's there's a
[34:11] difference now
[34:12] everything that's spoken is
[34:15] is not for you right now for instance
[34:21] if i was to read acts 2 38 uh you need
[34:24] to repent and be baptized
[34:26] well that doesn't mean you got to repent
[34:29] be baptized today
[34:31] because maybe you've already repented
[34:32] and been baptized
[34:34] so a lot of times when we hear the word
[34:36] of god being preached the whole word
[34:38] is for us but it may not be for us for
[34:41] that moment
[34:43] and if we if we catch that um
[34:46] we can really uh bypass the enemy
[34:49] trying to hit us over the head
[34:53] with with certain things amen amen and
[34:56] that's it's really important
[34:58] it's it's it's important uh we need
[35:01] to protect our minds we need to put the
[35:03] helmet
[35:04] of salvation on amen amen the the devil
[35:07] comes to church too
[35:10] amen just connecting with these
[35:13] scriptures a little bit
[35:15] um they may not have much of an
[35:18] impact in the way that we think
[35:21] in other words how can we neglect
[35:23] something that's been given to us
[35:25] free so great of salvation
[35:30] that's been given to us free and it
[35:32] can't be taken away so
[35:34] i don't i don't see how this is really
[35:37] impacting
[35:37] the way i think but i want to ask you
[35:41] do you have salvation and you would say
[35:44] yes i have salvation
[35:48] do you have salvation no matter what you
[35:50] do
[35:51] now this becomes a gray area
[35:55] this becomes a gray area
[35:58] and i just like the angels who kept not
[36:01] their first estate
[36:04] we must maintain our first estate
[36:08] hebrews chapter 3 verse 14 says for we
[36:10] are made partakers of christ
[36:12] if we hold the beginning of our
[36:15] confidence
[36:16] steadfast unto the end amen
[36:19] we can't just kind of go you know i
[36:21] started with christ and
[36:23] it's all over no so i asked that
[36:26] question
[36:27] do you have salvation no matter what you
[36:29] do
[36:30] it really becomes a gray area because
[36:33] we want to say oh yeah i do
[36:39] jude chapter 1 verse 5 says i will
[36:41] therefore put you in remembrance
[36:42] though ye once knew this how that the
[36:45] lord having saved the people of the land
[36:46] of egypt
[36:47] afterwards he destroyed them that
[36:50] believed not so they didn't keep
[36:54] their first estate they didn't keep on
[36:58] believing they could all stand and say
[37:01] oh yes
[37:02] god saved me out of the land of egypt
[37:04] but they did not continue to believe
[37:07] god are you with me so far
[37:11] the scriptures teach us that today is
[37:13] the day of salvation
[37:15] not yesterday and not tomorrow
[37:19] jesus said we have to continue in his
[37:21] word and he
[37:22] also said he that endure to the end the
[37:25] same
[37:25] shall be saved so there's something to
[37:28] be said
[37:29] about the question do you have salvation
[37:31] no matter what you do
[37:33] the bible says that that names were
[37:35] taken out of the book of life
[37:36] they were there once but they're taken
[37:38] out
[37:39] and i'm not trying to scare everybody
[37:41] i'm just trying to
[37:43] to take attention to these scriptures
[37:47] here
[37:47] um about neglecting so great a salvation
[37:52] which at the first began to be spoken of
[37:55] the lord and was confirmed unto them
[37:56] that heard not
[37:58] so if angels if the word spoken by
[38:02] angels was steadfast in every
[38:04] transgression
[38:05] and disobedience received a just
[38:07] recompense of reward
[38:09] how shall you and i escape if we neglect
[38:13] a simple little word just neglecting so
[38:18] great of salvation
[38:20] amen
[38:26] paul admonished timothy in first timothy
[38:28] chapter 6 verse 12
[38:29] to keep fighting the good fight of faith
[38:32] and to lay hold
[38:33] of eternal life well a lot of the
[38:36] attitude that that goes around is i
[38:37] already got eternal life what do i need
[38:38] to hold on to it for
[38:40] what i need to lay hold for i already
[38:42] got it
[38:43] and see what we're doing by this this
[38:45] type of thinking
[38:46] we're taking certain scriptures and they
[38:49] don't dovetail with the other ones
[38:53] everything's got a dovetail together
[38:55] there's got to be a balance
[38:57] to our our our our
[39:00] our belief
[39:05] where aren't you thou art also called
[39:07] and have professed a good profession
[39:09] before many witnesses so we have to keep
[39:12] fighting
[39:13] the good fight of faith
[39:16] therefore we need to to work out our
[39:19] salvation
[39:20] amen we need to keep working on it keep
[39:22] keep
[39:23] keep uh having the reverence and the
[39:26] godly fear that we need
[39:28] in our walk with the lord and not just
[39:32] taking things for granted neglecting our
[39:35] walk with the lord
[39:36] philippians chapter 2 verse 13 says for
[39:39] it is god
[39:40] which worketh in you both to will
[39:43] and to do of his good pleasure so
[39:47] do all things that he instructs you to
[39:49] do without murmuring and complaining
[39:51] amen in other words we need more
[39:54] fear more reverence more respect because
[39:57] it's so
[39:58] easy to say well i'm safe that's the
[40:00] main thing and i got it and
[40:01] and and nothing else really matters
[40:03] that's being said at the pulpit or
[40:04] anything else i read in the bible
[40:06] or everything else and i'm listening on
[40:08] the tapes therefore i'm just going to
[40:09] listen
[40:10] for tapes just for one certain thing
[40:13] and miss what god's trying to speak all
[40:17] because we're neglecting
[40:19] our walk with the lord therefore we
[40:22] ought to
[40:22] give the more earnest heed to the things
[40:26] which we've heard
[40:27] lest at any time they we
[40:31] should let them slip notice that as
[40:33] brother branham said
[40:34] you'll find god where you left them
[40:40] we can let things slip we can let our
[40:43] walk slip
[40:44] sometimes we let our tongue slip things
[40:47] can
[40:48] can slip
[40:52] we can let a lot of things slip away
[40:54] from us we can take a lot of things for
[40:56] granted and our walk is
[40:58] certainly one of them the word neglect
[41:02] it means to be
[41:03] careless if you look up that word
[41:10] it means to be careless to make
[41:13] light of to be negligent
[41:18] to pay little attention to disregard
[41:23] to fail to carry out orders
[41:27] or to perform duties
[41:32] it seems like not that big a thing
[41:37] but it's a big thing to god
[41:40] amen
[41:43] neglection is something that we all
[41:46] can be subject to especially in this
[41:49] last age that we're living in of
[41:51] lackadaisical lukewarm things can slip
[41:54] in
[41:55] just about any time people are becoming
[41:57] more relaxed
[41:59] about the things of god amen we might
[42:02] say that believers
[42:03] are becoming more liberal more liberal
[42:08] using their liberty as a cloak for the
[42:09] flesh instead of
[42:11] taking the liberty that god's given them
[42:13] and serve one another
[42:14] amen some are falling away from their
[42:17] own steadfastness
[42:20] you see more and more signs of
[42:22] backsliding
[42:24] we can neglect our walk with god when we
[42:27] take him
[42:28] and his word for granted when we
[42:31] disregard or refuse to follow what he
[42:34] has spoken to us
[42:35] when we pay little attention or we don't
[42:38] take enough he
[42:38] to what god has said when we become
[42:42] careless and or forget about the things
[42:44] that he told us to do last service
[42:46] amen or simply fail to carry out god's
[42:50] orders or perform the duties that he has
[42:51] commanded
[42:53] neglection will hurt us in the long run
[42:57] we can brush it off now but in the long
[42:59] run
[43:00] it will hurt us brother branham said in
[43:03] the message
[43:04] god hiding himself in simplicity said
[43:06] that and then revealing himself in the
[43:08] same
[43:08] he says to refuse to say there's a
[43:11] sunshine
[43:12] is to go into the basement and shut your
[43:15] eyes from the light
[43:16] he said and that's right you remember
[43:19] the only way you can be wrong
[43:21] is first refuse right see
[43:24] to refuse to open your eyes you'll live
[43:27] in darkness
[43:29] see if you refuse to look how
[43:32] you're going to how are you going to see
[43:33] he said watch the simple things
[43:36] he said it's the little things that you
[43:38] leave undone
[43:40] not the big things you're trying to do
[43:44] talking about neglection amen
[43:47] god hiding himself and simplicity reveal
[43:49] himself the same in the message god's
[43:51] only provided place of worship
[43:53] he said that that every little jot
[43:56] every thing you must be faithful in
[43:59] amen it's always a little fox that
[44:02] spoils the vine
[44:05] sometimes you leave it's not the the big
[44:08] things you do
[44:09] it's the little things you leave undone
[44:12] amen
[44:13] he said remember a chain is only as
[44:15] strong as
[44:16] as its weakest link he and he quotes
[44:19] blessed are they that do
[44:20] all the commandments of god that they
[44:23] may that they might have a
[44:25] right to enter in
[44:28] now you take that scripture and it's
[44:30] like oh
[44:33] i can't neglect anything i shouldn't
[44:35] neglect anything
[44:36] that's true now understand that the
[44:38] blood is there for us our mistakes
[44:41] there's a difference between mistakes
[44:45] and neglection right the collection goes
[44:48] apart with an
[44:48] attitude and we might almost say it like
[44:52] this there are churches out there
[44:54] that it don't matter what you do on
[44:55] saturday you just go in
[44:57] or you just go in and and and go and
[45:01] make your little confession and it's
[45:02] over with but the nature never changes
[45:04] right amen and god wants to see a nature
[45:08] change in us amen
[45:09] amen brother brain gives us an example
[45:12] of this
[45:13] and do you now believe he said and in
[45:16] that found
[45:17] uh found the way to divinely healing now
[45:20] he's talking about
[45:21] leaving just some little thing out
[45:23] that's what he's referring to
[45:24] how it makes a difference and if there's
[45:26] something hanging over you some sin
[45:29] you don't confess that you could anoint
[45:32] that person pray for them do everything
[45:34] you want to say well stay right there as
[45:36] long as you've got unconfessed sin in
[45:37] your life
[45:38] or sometimes something that you haven't
[45:42] done something you neglect
[45:45] to do and in there
[45:48] god reveals it if there's anything wrong
[45:51] then you make that right and your
[45:53] healing is
[45:54] complete amen
[45:57] so neglection is is a very important
[46:00] thing amen
[46:01] that's right neglection is not
[46:05] something that we want
[46:08] to be in our our minds of how we view
[46:11] others
[46:13] but really it should be about how you
[46:16] view yourself
[46:19] because it's it's easy to look at others
[46:22] and say well
[46:23] they're obviously neglecting
[46:27] to get to church to get the church on
[46:30] time
[46:31] to pray before service or they're
[46:33] talking in the sanctuary
[46:35] they're out of order they're doing this
[46:38] they're doing that
[46:39] and it's easy to see where other people
[46:41] are neglecting
[46:44] but when we look at the subject of
[46:46] neglection we want to look at that
[46:49] subject with a rake
[46:54] we want to bring our rake to the table
[46:58] amen remember there were two men that
[47:01] went to church to pray
[47:04] one brought the rake one says i'm glad
[47:07] i'm not like this fellow
[47:10] remember the two men that had something
[47:13] in their eye
[47:14] they both had something in their eye but
[47:16] the one that had the biggest problem in
[47:18] their life
[47:19] was the one that was complaining about
[47:21] the other right amen
[47:24] amen so it's not about what somebody
[47:28] else is neglecting it's about what
[47:30] you're neglecting
[47:31] amen what are you neglecting today
[47:34] brother bran says we come to church to
[47:36] find out where we're at with god
[47:39] but the devil has a way of telling us
[47:41] that we're we're okay
[47:44] we're in need of nothing there will
[47:47] always be
[47:48] someone neglecting but just come to
[47:51] church
[47:51] with your rake and you will see what god
[47:54] wants you to take care of
[47:55] that's right now it's very
[47:59] easy to neglect and not even know it
[48:04] one of the shocking things about neglect
[48:06] is that we could have been walking in
[48:09] the will of god at one time and still be
[48:11] found neglecting
[48:12] things that god has told us since then
[48:16] brother branham taught us how that each
[48:18] church age
[48:19] came out of a darkness and they began to
[48:22] walk
[48:23] in a light right and at one time they
[48:26] took heed to the voice of god and they
[48:28] walked in that light but what happened
[48:30] they stopped walking in the light amen
[48:34] they just stopped right there so they
[48:36] neglected to take heed
[48:38] to the things which they heard amen
[48:43] what really slipped was continuing to
[48:45] walk in new light
[48:46] amen because that's just as important
[48:50] they figured they had all that was
[48:52] needed to get by
[48:54] and i'll say it just like this kind of
[48:56] like the foolish virgins
[49:00] they felt they had enough but they
[49:03] neglected to go on and get serious about
[49:06] getting more of the
[49:07] oil right
[49:11] so we don't want to feel so secure from
[49:13] our past
[49:14] light something that god has shown us
[49:17] something where we stand where we feel
[49:18] so secure about that
[49:20] that we're not taking heed to the things
[49:23] that he has told us
[49:25] in other words we need to to fear the
[49:27] lord about
[49:28] everything that he's speaking amen now
[49:31] even though we're thankful for what he's
[49:33] told us in the past we need to keep
[49:35] moving forward we need to continue in
[49:37] the word
[49:38] as jesus said pressing working out this
[49:41] great salvation so great of salvation
[49:43] with fear
[49:44] and trembling amen moving on to
[49:47] perfection taking heed to all the things
[49:49] that we have heard
[49:50] all the things that we're hearing and
[49:53] so we don't just let anything slip we
[49:55] don't want anything to slip
[49:56] right you ever meet somebody who was a
[49:58] real slicker
[50:01] you got to watch this guy he's a real
[50:03] slicker
[50:05] can't let anything get he'll just
[50:09] well we we can't live without
[50:12] the word of god that's right amen men
[50:15] shall live by
[50:16] every word that proceedeth out of the
[50:18] mouth of god amen
[50:22] now it could be the things that we've
[50:23] heard long ago and it could be the
[50:25] things that we heard last service
[50:28] things long ago would be proverbs 22 28
[50:32] remove not the ancient landmarks which
[50:35] thy
[50:36] fathers have set the word has been
[50:40] spoken this is what the prophet said
[50:42] this is what the prophets have said
[50:43] we don't deviate from that amen
[50:47] and then first john chapter 1 verse 7
[50:49] for anything
[50:50] recently but if we walk in the light
[50:53] as he is in the light we have fellowship
[50:55] with one another
[50:56] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[50:59] cleanses us
[51:00] from all sin amen
[51:04] so we just we can't let anything go
[51:09] we don't want to neglect the message of
[51:10] the hour
[51:12] we know that there's no more church ages
[51:15] coming
[51:16] but we could end up doing the same thing
[51:18] that they did
[51:24] we got luther's message we got wesley's
[51:27] message we know it we got brother
[51:29] branham's message we know it
[51:32] and never go on
[51:35] we can't rally behind brother branham
[51:38] like they rallied behind martin luther
[51:41] a lot of people followed brother
[51:44] martin because
[51:47] not just the 95 theses
[51:53] but they didn't like it that the church
[51:56] was taking
[51:57] advantage of their money
[52:02] that made them mad that made
[52:05] riot start you know why
[52:08] riots just kind of what we have today is
[52:10] riots
[52:13] and they got so political about it
[52:15] instead of them just rejoicing
[52:18] that god has set them free with truth
[52:21] they became anti
[52:25] i wonder how many people are in this
[52:27] message
[52:29] they're so anti-denomination
[52:32] they know it's man-made and that's why
[52:35] they
[52:36] they're so against it but had they
[52:39] received the truth of the message
[52:43] this message has come to point us how we
[52:46] can manifest christ
[52:48] not how we can say denominations are so
[52:50] wrong
[52:54] you know people they they say they're in
[52:56] the message but is the message in them
[52:58] is it producing the life that the
[53:00] message
[53:01] is supposed to produce i think they're
[53:03] just satisfied
[53:04] with saying they're in the message and
[53:06] they're neglecting the message itself
[53:11] help us lord we don't want to follow
[53:15] this message like they followed martin
[53:17] luther
[53:24] we don't want to know intellectually
[53:26] that this message is the truth
[53:30] we want to follow the message because
[53:33] the truth
[53:34] is making us free
[53:37] from ourselves amen
[53:41] i got to thinking about this today we're
[53:44] become new creatures in christ jesus
[53:47] how does that happen this word
[53:52] ought to be showing us how to
[53:56] drop this nature and as it
[54:00] drops this nature what happens
[54:03] the seed that we believe in that we
[54:06] rejoice in that we say that we are
[54:08] becomes to light it's already in there
[54:12] but it can't come out as long as this
[54:14] flesh wants to stay around
[54:17] in this word it just uncovers
[54:20] this ugly nature that we are and we
[54:22] learn to die
[54:24] out so the new nature can come forth
[54:31] i think sometimes we just got it
[54:36] backwards
[54:38] we got to shed the old nature so god's
[54:40] nature shines more through us
[54:43] jesus said in john 8 32 and you shall
[54:46] know the truth
[54:47] and the truth shall make you free
[54:52] the truth makes you free what's that
[54:53] make you free from yourself
[54:55] from your nature from who you have been
[54:58] before you came to christ
[55:00] it's not just the the knowledge of okay
[55:03] i belong to god i'm set free
[55:06] amen supposed to take us to perfection
[55:10] this message
[55:12] jesus never said i am the knowledge he
[55:14] said i
[55:15] am the truth truth makes you free
[55:18] knowledge puffs up
[55:20] amen he never said i was the life
[55:23] he said i am the life he never said i
[55:26] was the way he said i
[55:28] am the way this message is bringing true
[55:31] to us today it's leading and guiding us
[55:35] into all truth people are neglecting the
[55:39] message
[55:40] of the hour that's supposed to be
[55:43] leading and guiding
[55:45] this message is it's to bring us to
[55:48] our isaac it's to prepare us
[55:52] to meet him that's what this message is
[55:56] supposed to be doing
[55:57] if we're not focusing on that when we're
[56:00] listening to the tapes
[56:01] i just wonder because this is the only
[56:04] thing
[56:04] that's going to keep us out of
[56:06] tribulation is this message
[56:09] in this hour it's the only thing
[56:13] and it's not saying i'm in the message
[56:15] it's not saying
[56:16] i claim the message
[56:20] it's taking what this message says
[56:24] and living such an overcoming life
[56:28] which can only be done by the holy ghost
[56:35] we need the oil keep me burning
[56:40] i don't have to go i don't have to go
[56:45] four hours and realize that i need more
[56:48] holy ghost
[56:56] so i had somebody two people
[56:59] two different people telling me this
[57:00] week about
[57:04] um how much wisdom they
[57:07] they see on display
[57:13] but they don't realize
[57:18] every morning i get up and i say lord
[57:21] i need your wisd i need the holy ghost
[57:25] i need you today amen
[57:31] that's the only way we're going to
[57:32] overcome is have the overcomer
[57:35] overcoming inside of
[57:39] a us of things that we can neglect or
[57:41] let slip away
[57:43] and they will affect us a fact
[57:46] so great a salvation the scripture says
[57:49] yes
[57:50] if we don't hold our thoughts
[57:51] accountable if we don't try
[57:54] the spirits amen it'll affect our walk
[57:57] with god
[57:59] if we neglect our thoughts we'll end up
[58:02] neglecting
[58:03] our walk with the lord amen it's
[58:05] important where our thoughts are at
[58:09] a brother marty was saying in our men's
[58:11] meeting he says
[58:14] even the thoughts that we think when
[58:16] we're driving home from church
[58:20] it's important we can neglect to walk to
[58:24] god's house
[58:27] every time the doors are open turn with
[58:29] me to hebrews chapter 10
[58:31] verse 23.
[58:41] if we are at one point if we were
[58:44] at one point we professed
[58:48] to make a commitment to god i'm gonna
[58:53] i'm gonna go to church every chance i
[58:55] can every time the doors are open
[58:57] i've got this commitment we once
[59:01] made with the lord
[59:06] which we all have right amen amen
[59:10] amen and it's okay if you want to be
[59:14] a little lively it's okay with me
[59:18] verse 23 let us hold fast
[59:22] that profession of our faith without
[59:24] wavering
[59:26] for he is faithful that promised
[59:29] and let us consider one another to
[59:32] provoke unto
[59:33] love and to good works
[59:37] not forsaking the assembling of
[59:39] ourselves together
[59:41] as the matter of psalm is but exhorting
[59:44] one another
[59:45] and so much more as you see the day
[59:48] approaching consider
[59:52] one another have a burden for one
[59:54] another
[59:55] care for one another amen
[59:59] brother mark said in our men's meeting
[1:00:00] says we we have to be
[1:00:02] desperate to get to church and hear from
[1:00:05] god
[1:00:06] that's what you saw me writing down
[1:00:10] brother brahm says you can't wait till
[1:00:11] those doors are open if that
[1:00:14] if that's not going on what really is
[1:00:17] important
[1:00:18] is that you spend some time getting with
[1:00:20] god
[1:00:22] that's right that's it we just got it we
[1:00:24] got to get back to that
[1:00:26] because we're letting things slip we're
[1:00:29] neglecting
[1:00:30] i tell you you get your your mind out of
[1:00:33] order your life will get out of order
[1:00:35] you young things slip in the church the
[1:00:37] church will get out of order
[1:00:40] come on we cannot
[1:00:43] allow neglection to be just a simple
[1:00:47] minor little thing that don't mean
[1:00:48] anything
[1:00:50] it's important for if we sin
[1:00:53] willfully after we have received the
[1:00:54] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[1:00:56] no more sacrifice for sins
[1:00:59] but a certain fearful looking for
[1:01:03] of judgment in the fiery indian nation
[1:01:06] which shall devour the adversaries
[1:01:08] he that despised moses law died without
[1:01:11] mercy
[1:01:12] under two or three witnesses notice that
[1:01:14] we do not want to despise the importance
[1:01:18] when the bible says forsaking not the
[1:01:21] assembling of yourselves together
[1:01:25] and everybody's got excuses there's
[1:01:28] nobody that comes to me and says you
[1:01:29] know what
[1:01:30] brother john i am just not going to come
[1:01:33] because i'm neglecting
[1:01:36] nobody does that there's a reason
[1:01:40] but there's no reason
[1:01:44] i don't if you're sick and you can't
[1:01:47] come that's
[1:01:48] that's i'm not talking about that now
[1:01:52] but just because you're you're toll
[1:01:56] aches
[1:01:58] you gotta
[1:02:02] had a bad day at work i mean
[1:02:06] look for reasons to come not for reasons
[1:02:08] to stay home
[1:02:09] look at the spirit that's causing that
[1:02:11] to happen
[1:02:12] amen now look what happened of how much
[1:02:16] sore punishment suppose ye
[1:02:20] shall he be thought worthy who have
[1:02:23] trodden
[1:02:24] under foot the son of god and have
[1:02:26] counted the blood of the covenant
[1:02:28] wherewith he was sanctified at one thing
[1:02:31] one time
[1:02:32] and on unholy thing have done despite
[1:02:37] unto the spirit of grace
[1:02:42] for we know him that have said vengeance
[1:02:46] belongeth unto me i
[1:02:48] will repent recompense saith the lord
[1:02:51] and again the lord shall judge his
[1:02:54] people
[1:02:55] amen i'm so thankful for god's judgment
[1:02:58] on me
[1:02:59] amen i'll take his judgment today
[1:03:02] friends
[1:03:04] i don't want his judgment after i die i
[1:03:07] want his judgment today
[1:03:09] because his judgment today there's mercy
[1:03:11] there's grace
[1:03:12] there's a way of escape today i'm okay
[1:03:16] with the judgments of god today i am not
[1:03:18] okay with judgment after i leave here
[1:03:24] so basically this scripture is is saying
[1:03:28] the same thing as our opening scripture
[1:03:29] how shall we escape
[1:03:31] if we neglect so great of salvation
[1:03:37] we could neglect to remember the things
[1:03:40] that god wants us to do
[1:03:43] we can let them slip first corinthians
[1:03:44] chapter 15 verse 1.
[1:03:46] moreover brethren i declare unto you the
[1:03:50] gospel which i preached unto you
[1:03:52] which also you've received and wherein
[1:03:54] you stand
[1:03:56] by which you're also saved
[1:04:00] if if
[1:04:03] you keep in memory what i preached unto
[1:04:06] you
[1:04:08] unless you have believed in vain
[1:04:12] now that's a powerful scripture right
[1:04:14] there
[1:04:17] we need to keep building we need to keep
[1:04:19] moving forward
[1:04:20] we need to keep pressing in we need to
[1:04:22] keep thinking about the things that we
[1:04:24] heard
[1:04:24] preached because that's god speaking to
[1:04:28] us
[1:04:29] the children of israel did not continue
[1:04:32] to walk in further light
[1:04:34] like a lot of believers today they only
[1:04:36] want to come out of egypt
[1:04:39] but they don't want to they don't want
[1:04:42] to
[1:04:42] suffer to get the holy ghost
[1:04:46] they don't want to have uh they don't
[1:04:49] want to believe on two getting the holy
[1:04:51] ghost
[1:04:52] they don't want to press towards their
[1:04:54] promise or what god promised them
[1:04:57] because they weren't interested in
[1:04:59] taking a chance with their life
[1:05:01] they'd rather serve god outside where
[1:05:04] there was no
[1:05:04] battles where they didn't have to die
[1:05:07] out to the enemy
[1:05:12] they were afraid they were afraid of
[1:05:15] dying that's why they wouldn't go in
[1:05:18] there and take the promised land
[1:05:20] they were afraid of dying what's wrong
[1:05:22] with the believers today that won't get
[1:05:23] the holy ghost
[1:05:24] they're afraid of dying it's true
[1:05:28] the giants are to what i'm not going to
[1:05:30] have control anymore
[1:05:36] don't neglect it don't neglect the holy
[1:05:38] ghost god wants to give it to us
[1:05:40] more than we could possibly want it amen
[1:05:46] we don't want to neglect so great of
[1:05:47] salvation we don't want to neglect our
[1:05:49] walk with the lord
[1:05:55] why why is it that people neglect they
[1:05:58] don't want to cope
[1:05:59] with the word
[1:06:02] they want to cope with the rest of the
[1:06:04] word they just want to be saved
[1:06:05] and don't bother me about anything else
[1:06:10] they don't have to really love one
[1:06:12] another
[1:06:15] we can neglect to love one another jesus
[1:06:19] said because iniquity is abounding in
[1:06:21] this age
[1:06:21] the love of many is waxing cold that's
[1:06:24] right we can become
[1:06:25] critical and and judgmental of one
[1:06:27] another so easy brother branham said in
[1:06:29] the message
[1:06:29] hear ye him he said he's the one what we
[1:06:32] need today brother sister
[1:06:34] is more real genuine christian love
[1:06:38] displayed displayed
[1:06:41] among believers now how do i display
[1:06:44] love right
[1:06:46] jesus said i can't do it to those that
[1:06:48] love me
[1:06:50] she said no no reward on that i gotta
[1:06:53] wait till i'm not being loved
[1:06:56] and then i can display real genuine love
[1:07:01] he said that's what causes separation in
[1:07:04] families
[1:07:05] is the neglect of love
[1:07:08] amen that's what causes the separation
[1:07:12] in churches
[1:07:13] a neglect of love he says we've got
[1:07:17] to have love amen
[1:07:20] we can neglect to serve one another as
[1:07:23] jesus
[1:07:24] taught us to wash one another's feet to
[1:07:27] bear one another's burden
[1:07:29] and to restore those who have been
[1:07:31] overtaken in a fault
[1:07:33] yes amen i mean we need to start
[1:07:35] exercising these things because they're
[1:07:37] not
[1:07:37] gifts they're not gifts
[1:07:40] you just you got to have a love for god
[1:07:43] a love to help
[1:07:45] and you got to be willing to get dirty
[1:07:46] and and and
[1:07:48] and make mistakes and there's one way
[1:07:50] you're going to learn is get get down
[1:07:52] there and practice
[1:07:54] serving one another
[1:07:58] we can neglect to win souls for jesus
[1:08:02] we need to labor till jesus takes us
[1:08:04] home
[1:08:06] we can neglect his presence and take the
[1:08:08] holy spirit for granted
[1:08:11] we can neglect to worship the lord
[1:08:14] in the spirit and basically just give
[1:08:17] them the leftovers at the end of the day
[1:08:22] but the brahms said in the message
[1:08:23] hebrews chapter 2
[1:08:25] he says certainly how shall we escape if
[1:08:27] we neglect
[1:08:28] such if you neglect to eat you'll die if
[1:08:31] you neglect to turn a corner you'll
[1:08:33] wreck
[1:08:34] if you neglect to milk the cow she'll go
[1:08:37] dry
[1:08:38] you neglect your teeth you'll have to
[1:08:41] have them all pulled out certainly
[1:08:45] you pay for your neglection
[1:08:48] he said oh brother he said old branham
[1:08:51] tabernacle and you visitors
[1:08:54] let me tell you something now you
[1:08:56] neglect to testify
[1:08:58] of the glory of god you neglect to give
[1:09:01] god the praise and glory
[1:09:02] and you'll find yourself cold formal
[1:09:05] backslidden
[1:09:06] one of these days you give god praise
[1:09:08] how shall we escape if we neglect
[1:09:11] such a great salvation amen amen
[1:09:16] amen there's more
[1:09:20] to this than just a decision you made
[1:09:24] years ago when you gave your heart to
[1:09:26] god
[1:09:31] our walk includes a lot doesn't it
[1:09:35] we can neglect the office that god has
[1:09:37] ordained to take us through
[1:09:40] we can neglect to pay god's tithes
[1:09:44] we can neglect to pay tribute unto whom
[1:09:47] tribute is due
[1:09:49] to appreciate and to become
[1:09:52] uh thankful more thankful
[1:09:57] we know there's a spirit in this age
[1:10:00] where people
[1:10:01] are neglecting and they're literally
[1:10:03] they're labeled as unthankful people
[1:10:07] selfish to all get out we don't want to
[1:10:11] take the ministry that god has given us
[1:10:13] here
[1:10:13] for granted has nothing to do with me
[1:10:17] it has to do everything with god now i'm
[1:10:20] not saying say thank you
[1:10:22] what i'm saying is be thankful amen and
[1:10:25] learn to appreciate more what god has
[1:10:28] given
[1:10:28] amen because you can neglect to be
[1:10:31] thankful to the lord
[1:10:35] we can like the word being preached the
[1:10:38] realness of the word the word is alive
[1:10:40] it's here
[1:10:41] we can neglect to reverence that word
[1:10:44] amen
[1:10:45] god is speaking to us through the word
[1:10:49] we can neglect praying for the most
[1:10:52] important thing which is revelation when
[1:10:55] the word is being preached
[1:11:01] i'm so thankful that when i came
[1:11:05] to this message
[1:11:10] i was not
[1:11:14] um
[1:11:17] enticed to believe
[1:11:23] a dozen different pastors i mean at our
[1:11:26] church
[1:11:27] brother bruce you know this we had a lot
[1:11:29] of preachers
[1:11:33] probably one of the most at that time
[1:11:37] and to me
[1:11:43] it was there was a continuity
[1:11:48] and a a
[1:11:52] uh it was establishing me
[1:11:57] the word established me
[1:12:01] and what i loved about it
[1:12:04] is i wasn't tossed here and there
[1:12:09] the problem with going in a thousand
[1:12:11] different directions
[1:12:13] it's hard to anchor in any of them
[1:12:20] somewhere down the line you just got to
[1:12:22] settle things between
[1:12:23] you and god
[1:12:29] and the scripture tells us there's a lot
[1:12:32] of voices out there
[1:12:34] there's only one that matters
[1:12:38] now if i'm in a room and i gotta listen
[1:12:40] say i gotta listen
[1:12:42] to brother mark i'm gonna have a better
[1:12:46] chance
[1:12:47] hearing him if there's not
[1:12:50] a hundred other people in that room
[1:12:53] talking at the same time
[1:12:55] i think brother marty was talking about
[1:12:58] i'm not like some people that can listen
[1:13:00] to music
[1:13:01] and study at the same time
[1:13:05] i got to have everything off and
[1:13:07] focusing on what i'm listening to
[1:13:09] what i'm reading what i'm paying
[1:13:11] attention to
[1:13:14] to me is eliminate the voices
[1:13:18] and just hear ye him amen
[1:13:22] hear him because he loves you wants to
[1:13:26] take care of you
[1:13:29] and your focus has to be just that
[1:13:33] brother ram said in the message hebrews
[1:13:35] chapter 2 again he said
[1:13:37] what does that he says a lot of time
[1:13:39] it's weak pulpits
[1:13:41] that's right so this one could be for me
[1:13:43] let's say this one's for me
[1:13:46] said that's right get down and bring the
[1:13:48] gospel truth
[1:13:49] we're going to have to answer for that
[1:13:52] in the days to come
[1:13:53] we must not neglect anything and the
[1:13:56] people
[1:13:57] as we are here at branham tabernacle to
[1:14:00] see the signs and wonders and the powers
[1:14:02] of the resurrection
[1:14:03] resurrected christ and then to know that
[1:14:06] we would place
[1:14:07] our times upon other things
[1:14:10] and neglect to hear the voice of the
[1:14:13] lord jesus
[1:14:14] he said how shall we escape if we
[1:14:17] neglect so great
[1:14:18] a salvation amen well i don't want the
[1:14:22] reason for us neglecting
[1:14:24] to be because of the weakness of this
[1:14:26] pulpit
[1:14:28] i'd rather a billion miles get in
[1:14:31] trouble
[1:14:32] for preaching too hard
[1:14:36] amen
[1:14:40] paul said i'm not ashamed of the gospel
[1:14:42] of christ for it is the power of god
[1:14:44] unto salvation
[1:14:45] yes to everyone that believeth to the
[1:14:48] jew first
[1:14:48] and then also to the greek and he said
[1:14:51] in acts 20 verse 26
[1:14:53] wherefore i take to you i take
[1:14:56] you to record this day i am pure from
[1:15:00] the blood of all men
[1:15:01] amen for i have not shunned to declare
[1:15:04] unto you
[1:15:05] the whole council of god
[1:15:09] now we could neglect to believe the word
[1:15:12] that's being preached
[1:15:20] the the thought that at any time when
[1:15:23] i'm listening to a tape reading the
[1:15:24] bible and i come across something that
[1:15:28] starts dealing with me to not
[1:15:31] want that to not want to allow that to
[1:15:35] deal with me there's something wrong
[1:15:38] with my spirit
[1:15:40] i'm neglecting god dealing with me
[1:15:43] are you with me amen brother branham
[1:15:46] said that we could neglect to even
[1:15:48] thirst
[1:15:49] after the word right he said in the
[1:15:52] message thirsty says i want
[1:15:54] you to see another great danger just
[1:15:56] before we close if you're
[1:15:58] not guilty of any of these things that
[1:16:00] i've mentioned
[1:16:01] and that is the danger of neglecting a
[1:16:04] thirst see
[1:16:06] i have a holy thirst but i'm not guilty
[1:16:09] brother branham
[1:16:11] i'll just go and join in the church and
[1:16:14] things like this
[1:16:15] but c to neglect a thirst
[1:16:19] if you neglect to satisfy a thirst of
[1:16:21] water or food
[1:16:22] you will die if you neglect to thirst in
[1:16:25] you
[1:16:26] for god you will spiritually die
[1:16:29] that's right amen you call for revival
[1:16:32] as you wait for your church to have a
[1:16:33] revival
[1:16:34] well there ain't the revival for you
[1:16:39] he said that ain't the revival for you
[1:16:41] the revival ought to begin
[1:16:43] right in you amen when you begin to
[1:16:46] thirst for god amen
[1:16:48] there might not be another member of the
[1:16:50] church wanting that revival
[1:16:53] if it breaks out of you it'll break out
[1:16:56] of other places see
[1:16:57] but you you neglect that thirst
[1:17:02] so if there's a deep calling yo this
[1:17:05] churches should be on fire there should
[1:17:06] be more happening
[1:17:08] oh there's there should be more people
[1:17:09] there should be more people praying
[1:17:11] there should be there should just be
[1:17:14] more that
[1:17:17] thought that you're dealing with means
[1:17:19] god wants it to start with you
[1:17:21] right that's what that quote's telling
[1:17:23] me amen
[1:17:27] he says again you you neglect to milk
[1:17:29] the cow
[1:17:31] uh the other is full of milk when others
[1:17:33] for milk if you
[1:17:34] let that cow stay like that she'll go
[1:17:37] dry that's exactly right if you neglect
[1:17:39] to take a drink of water
[1:17:40] i just ain't gonna drink anymore he says
[1:17:42] you'll die you neglect to eat food
[1:17:44] you'll die
[1:17:45] if you neglect to give the holy spirit
[1:17:48] the word of god
[1:17:50] you'll die if you neglect
[1:17:53] to give the holy spirit inside of you
[1:17:56] the word of god that's coming
[1:17:58] if you don't unite with that you'll die
[1:18:02] spiritually is what he's saying amen
[1:18:06] i want to be alive amen so if you
[1:18:09] neglect to feed
[1:18:10] the holy spirit the word of god jesus
[1:18:13] said
[1:18:14] every word shall be by the holy
[1:18:17] spirit and listen now if you try to feed
[1:18:20] it with the wrong things
[1:18:21] if it's the genuine holy spirit in you
[1:18:24] you'll know the difference now remember
[1:18:28] the word of god is what the holy spirit
[1:18:30] feeds on
[1:18:31] amen he says it don't feed on enthusiasm
[1:18:36] it don't feed on education it doesn't
[1:18:39] feed on church going
[1:18:42] it doesn't feed on theologies there's a
[1:18:44] lot of difference between
[1:18:46] inspire something and a theological
[1:18:49] standpoint of it
[1:18:55] you could be under the inspiration of
[1:18:59] the word
[1:19:02] but if you come into church with a
[1:19:04] theological
[1:19:06] spirit with a a
[1:19:09] spirit of just not
[1:19:13] inspired to hear the word you're looking
[1:19:16] what are what's most the allowed
[1:19:18] theologians
[1:19:19] look for
[1:19:22] they they and they will argue
[1:19:26] they will debate they will prove what's
[1:19:28] right
[1:19:29] in their mind and they will go at it
[1:19:32] because you're looking to prove their
[1:19:34] point
[1:19:37] but we just come because we don't know
[1:19:38] where we're at with god we're just lambs
[1:19:40] we're sheep
[1:19:42] lord show me where i'm at show me
[1:19:45] i don't even know my own heart i think
[1:19:47] i'm right
[1:19:48] now if we come into church like this
[1:19:51] we're going to get further along with
[1:19:52] god
[1:19:53] right amen because we're going to hear
[1:19:54] the voice of god now i want to commend
[1:19:56] every one of you that believe that god
[1:19:59] is in control in this church
[1:20:01] i want to commend you first
[1:20:03] thessalonians chapter 2 verse 11
[1:20:06] as you know how
[1:20:09] we exhorted and comforted and charged
[1:20:12] every one of you
[1:20:14] as a father doth his children that she
[1:20:17] walk worthy of god who have called you
[1:20:20] into his kingdom and glory for this
[1:20:23] cause also thank we
[1:20:25] god without ceasing now without
[1:20:29] ceasing because when you receive the
[1:20:32] word of god
[1:20:33] which he heard of us he received it
[1:20:36] not as the word of men
[1:20:40] but as it is in truth
[1:20:43] the word of god which effectually
[1:20:46] worketh also in you that believe that's
[1:20:49] right
[1:20:51] you want the word to work in your life
[1:20:53] believe it's from god and not from john
[1:20:55] martin
[1:20:57] it won't work in you if you just well
[1:21:00] it's it's just
[1:21:01] john's point of view and this is what
[1:21:02] he's trying to do and
[1:21:04] you know it's just not going to work in
[1:21:06] you because the word of god is
[1:21:08] life jesus said my words are spirit
[1:21:11] and they are life and that life's gonna
[1:21:13] come inside of you and quicken you
[1:21:16] because that's what we live by we live
[1:21:17] by the quicken word we don't live by the
[1:21:20] dead letter
[1:21:22] i understand that this minister right
[1:21:25] here
[1:21:26] he's not always jumping from one side of
[1:21:28] the pulpit to the other
[1:21:29] and and doing all the things that
[1:21:32] some evangelists do it's okay
[1:21:36] the word's still inspired i'll tell you
[1:21:37] when jesus preached he didn't preach
[1:21:39] like that either
[1:21:42] brother brandon said he was very calm
[1:21:46] very calm
[1:21:50] it was still the inspired word amen
[1:21:53] you understand what i'm saying he has a
[1:21:56] fivefold ministry
[1:21:57] he has all different types of trees and
[1:21:59] all different types of flowers and all
[1:22:00] different types of ministers
[1:22:02] and they're all god amen the inspiration
[1:22:06] is not how it's delivered the
[1:22:09] inspiration
[1:22:10] is is it from god at that moment
[1:22:14] is a spiritual food in due season for
[1:22:16] your soul
[1:22:19] because god is the god of now amen what
[1:22:22] do i tell them
[1:22:24] i am that i am that's right now i was
[1:22:27] i am not i will be i am we're what the
[1:22:30] god of i am today
[1:22:32] i don't want to get healed a month from
[1:22:34] now i want to get healed today
[1:22:38] i don't want to wait a month from now to
[1:22:39] get forgiven to get delivered
[1:22:43] today i want god today god is here today
[1:22:46] i want to commend you
[1:22:47] for believing that god is in control
[1:22:55] we can neglect to believe hebrews
[1:22:57] chapter 4 verse 2
[1:22:58] says for unto us was the gospel preaches
[1:23:01] wells unto them but the word preached
[1:23:03] did not profit them not being mixed with
[1:23:06] faith in them
[1:23:07] that heard it so we could sit in church
[1:23:09] hear the word of god
[1:23:10] and not mix it with that's for me that's
[1:23:13] for me
[1:23:13] amen lord i want what's for me
[1:23:19] we can neglect our faith
[1:23:24] we can neglect to fight the good fight
[1:23:26] of faith
[1:23:27] we can neglect to seek him diligently
[1:23:31] we could neglect to contend
[1:23:35] for our faith
[1:23:38] just think that it's always there
[1:23:42] well i know i got a lot of muscles in my
[1:23:44] body
[1:23:47] that when i don't exercise them when i
[1:23:49] finally decide to use them
[1:23:51] they hurt i've always viewed painting
[1:23:56] as something that just you know anybody
[1:23:59] can do
[1:24:01] don't need muscles don't don't need
[1:24:04] you don't need anything just simple
[1:24:08] well if you ever painted for a good many
[1:24:11] hours and a day
[1:24:13] you will feel the next day
[1:24:17] amen soar because you're not used to
[1:24:21] using those muscles
[1:24:22] amen and if you don't
[1:24:25] use your faith if you're not
[1:24:31] fighting the good fight of faith with
[1:24:33] every little thought with every little
[1:24:34] situation
[1:24:37] you can become weak jude
[1:24:40] verse 3 says beloved when i gave
[1:24:44] all diligence to write into the common
[1:24:46] salvation it was needful for me to write
[1:24:49] unto you
[1:24:50] and to exhort you that you should
[1:24:52] earnestly contend
[1:24:54] for the faith that was once delivered
[1:24:56] unto the saints
[1:24:58] what's wrong with laodicea need of
[1:25:01] nothing
[1:25:01] i don't need i don't need to contend for
[1:25:03] nothing i'm bright i'm going
[1:25:12] they're blind from even seeing what
[1:25:13] they've neglected
[1:25:18] they've been so schooled by the enemy
[1:25:22] that the only thing that'll open their
[1:25:24] eyes is the have of god
[1:25:29] they got to come with a heart lord help
[1:25:31] me to see what i don't see
[1:25:35] brother brandon makes some comments we
[1:25:38] need to pinch our conscience
[1:25:41] the bible says we need to wake out of
[1:25:43] our sleep
[1:25:46] pray through into the spirit shake
[1:25:48] ourselves for the random said
[1:25:50] do something to sober us up
[1:25:54] from our condition of not being okay
[1:25:57] with letting things slack off
[1:26:03] letting things be neglected
[1:26:06] the small things that we're leaving
[1:26:07] undone
[1:26:11] in one sense that is the beginning of
[1:26:16] iniquity is not doing the things that we
[1:26:18] know we should be doing
[1:26:20] i want to end with some quotes here from
[1:26:21] brother branham
[1:26:24] he said in the book of hebrews chapter 3
[1:26:26] he said our religion
[1:26:28] is not in vain it's absolutely the
[1:26:31] resurrected jesus christ
[1:26:33] same thing now he says you mustn't
[1:26:37] neglect it now
[1:26:40] just don't go away from church today and
[1:26:42] say well
[1:26:44] i kind of enjoyed going down there i
[1:26:47] like the singing
[1:26:48] and the people are friendly around that
[1:26:50] little old church
[1:26:52] he says don't you do that he says
[1:26:55] brother
[1:26:56] your heart let your heart become a
[1:26:59] flame yes amen
[1:27:02] say here i got to do something about
[1:27:06] this
[1:27:07] i got to get out and see if i can get
[1:27:11] somebody saved
[1:27:16] if we're not going to that extreme
[1:27:18] brother branham just said we're
[1:27:19] neglecting
[1:27:21] we're neglecting our religion amen
[1:27:25] he said in the same series hebrews
[1:27:28] chapter
[1:27:29] 5 and 6 he said oh in that great
[1:27:33] hour of darkness and chaos
[1:27:36] over the earth we could say that's even
[1:27:38] today
[1:27:40] we should be this goes along with
[1:27:44] brother bruce's message to us he says we
[1:27:47] should be the happiest people
[1:27:49] in the whole earth to rejoice to know
[1:27:53] all the time when people are in
[1:27:56] documentated
[1:27:58] documented
[1:28:01] and all kinds of isms and the things on
[1:28:03] the earth
[1:28:04] and yet today the real living god by the
[1:28:07] word
[1:28:08] and his visible evidence
[1:28:11] shows us that he
[1:28:14] is here with us that's right
[1:28:17] amen amen
[1:28:21] working moving living
[1:28:25] acting just as he always did
[1:28:28] he said what a privileged people that we
[1:28:31] are to have this
[1:28:32] amen he says we should hold fast to
[1:28:36] these things because how shall we escape
[1:28:39] if we neglect such a great salvation
[1:28:43] we have been treasured here
[1:28:47] with the word
[1:28:50] and i think maybe part of the problem is
[1:28:53] we don't
[1:28:53] treasure it enough
[1:29:01] remember it is not for everybody
[1:29:06] but it is for the bride amen
[1:29:11] in chapter two brother rhymes says it
[1:29:13] behooves us not to neglect this great
[1:29:15] salvation for
[1:29:17] we'll have to give an account someday
[1:29:19] what we'll do with the son of god
[1:29:21] amen he's on your hand tonight you
[1:29:24] sinner you backslider
[1:29:27] what are you going to do with him
[1:29:30] you say well i'll put it all he says but
[1:29:32] remember don't you do that
[1:29:35] there's no way at all if you're a sinner
[1:29:38] that you can leave this building and be
[1:29:41] the same he says you can't do it
[1:29:47] in god's provided way he says i i don't
[1:29:49] believe that there's ever been a man
[1:29:52] or a woman that's ever walked into a
[1:29:54] church or come into the presence of god
[1:29:57] without they were given an
[1:30:00] invitation to this supper
[1:30:03] now it says you can take it or turn it
[1:30:05] down that's up to you
[1:30:07] think about that a man or woman has
[1:30:11] never walked into a church
[1:30:13] come into the presence of god without
[1:30:16] god giving them an invitation
[1:30:20] how good our god is some people goes to
[1:30:24] church
[1:30:24] year after year day after day revival
[1:30:27] after revival
[1:30:28] and still will not accept the invitation
[1:30:32] they don't mean to turn it down he says
[1:30:35] but they just neglect
[1:30:36] doing it but still
[1:30:40] neglection will take you where you don't
[1:30:41] want to go right
[1:30:43] he says did you notice one had he's
[1:30:47] referring to
[1:30:49] the parable now
[1:30:52] where the invitation went out and they
[1:30:55] came back with
[1:30:56] excuses he says and did you notice one
[1:30:59] had said
[1:31:00] some they had something to do he bought
[1:31:03] a piece of ground
[1:31:04] the other one bought some ox and he must
[1:31:07] try them
[1:31:07] not like he wouldn't try the ox before
[1:31:10] he bought them
[1:31:11] you see he it was just an excuse
[1:31:15] yes and i know that all you ministers
[1:31:18] and so forth and businessmen
[1:31:20] track workers and so forth you all find
[1:31:22] those things people got excuses
[1:31:26] i've just got to stay home tonight i
[1:31:28] can't attend the revival
[1:31:30] just remember god said they do that
[1:31:32] they're turning
[1:31:34] down their invitation
[1:31:38] now let's look at it again one said he'd
[1:31:41] he did this his wife wouldn't let him
[1:31:43] come
[1:31:44] and that's another excuse there should
[1:31:48] be nothing stand between
[1:31:49] us and that invitation that's right if
[1:31:52] it costs a yolk of oxen
[1:31:54] or your business or your wife or your
[1:31:56] children
[1:31:57] or anything nothing should separate us
[1:32:00] from that invitation
[1:32:01] amen
[1:32:04] so how does the devil get them to do
[1:32:06] that
[1:32:07] the devil gets them to say well i'm
[1:32:09] still saved even though i don't go
[1:32:15] god's called you to the harvest field
[1:32:18] amen
[1:32:20] or to do something for him
[1:32:23] there should be nothing stand between
[1:32:25] you and god it must come first
[1:32:27] the invitations given out i believe that
[1:32:31] was the last thing that he commissioned
[1:32:35] his disciples to do to go ye out into
[1:32:37] all the world let's stand together
[1:32:49] it'll be worth it all i believe the
[1:32:52] scriptures
[1:32:53] tells us that
[1:32:56] the sufferings of this present time now
[1:32:59] of course this is for those that don't
[1:33:00] make excuses
[1:33:02] for those who don't neglect the word
[1:33:05] it's harder it's the harder way he said
[1:33:08] the sufferings of this present time
[1:33:10] is not worthy to be compared with the
[1:33:12] glory that shall be revealed in us
[1:33:14] so there is such a reward for those that
[1:33:17] are willing
[1:33:18] to put god first
[1:33:24] god has given us i'll say so great of
[1:33:27] salvation
[1:33:29] it's worth everything that we have to do
[1:33:32] for god
[1:33:34] it's worth everything right now if god
[1:33:38] never did another thing
[1:33:39] for us would he owe us something
[1:33:45] you think about these people that are in
[1:33:47] the world that don't know
[1:33:48] god and we've heard them say
[1:33:52] well if god was really god he wouldn't
[1:33:56] have
[1:33:57] allowed this person to die
[1:34:00] or that person to die he wouldn't allow
[1:34:03] me to lose
[1:34:04] my job my marriage my house
[1:34:09] and they feel that god owes them
[1:34:12] but in reality god paid the greatest
[1:34:15] price he could pay at calvary
[1:34:18] he paid for everything there he owes me
[1:34:21] nothing he owes me no excuse
[1:34:23] or no god don't give excuses
[1:34:27] he he doesn't owe me any reason for
[1:34:29] anything
[1:34:30] right but i owe him everything amen
[1:34:39] god wants us
[1:34:43] to take a look at these things that we
[1:34:45] heard tonight
[1:34:48] everything that was said was not said
[1:34:51] because of what's going on in your life
[1:34:54] but perhaps there were things
[1:34:58] spoken
[1:35:01] that god is wanting you to
[1:35:06] take heed to
[1:35:10] so that the word that he has given you
[1:35:13] the promises of his word that he's given
[1:35:15] you would not slip
[1:35:19] because we need all the word yes amen
[1:35:22] let's follow
[1:35:23] our hearts in a word of prayer i want to
[1:35:26] say to each of you that are
[1:35:28] live streaming and listening
[1:35:32] do you believe with all your heart
[1:35:38] our god is
[1:35:43] he's a serious god he's he's jealous
[1:35:46] over us and he wants us to
[1:35:48] pay attention to all the word
[1:35:53] i want to invite you to the the mind of
[1:35:56] god concerning his word
[1:36:00] just ask in your heart is there anything
[1:36:06] that perhaps you've been neglecting is
[1:36:10] there
[1:36:10] anything just say lord reveal it to me
