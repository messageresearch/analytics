[34:58] good to see brother Bruce, sister Donna
[34:59] back safely. Um but and also we have uh
[35:03] Ra Reichen here. Reker, okay, for the
[35:07] first time. So we want to welcome him uh
[35:10] to the house of the Lord. Amen.
[35:14] Well, we before we begin reading here,
[35:16] let's look to the author of this book
[35:18] and and just ask him to help us to
[35:22] receive from him this morning. Heavenly
[35:24] Father, as we stand here, we are a needy
[35:28] people.
[35:30] We're not fully in your image yet. We're
[35:33] not all what we need to be yet. We need
[35:37] more of your grace. That's right. And we
[35:40] ask that you would be merciful to us
[35:43] this morning. Forgive us of our sins and
[35:45] our trespasses.
[35:47] Cleanse us of everything, Lord, that
[35:49] would hinder the working of the Holy
[35:50] Spirit in all of our hearts. Amen.
[35:53] Remove every doubt, every fear, remove
[35:56] everything from the past. We're
[35:57] forgetting those things which are
[35:58] behind, and we're pressing towards the
[36:01] mark this morning.
[36:03] Lord, we pray that you would give us
[36:05] ears to hear,
[36:08] eyes to see, a heart to receive,
[36:11] understand, perceive, and to be able to
[36:14] walk away from um this this meeting with
[36:19] you, this time with you, this precious
[36:21] intimate moment with you, that we would
[36:23] have more of you inside of us. We commit
[36:26] the service to you and ask your
[36:28] blessings now in the reading of the
[36:29] word. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[36:31] Hallelujah. Amen. Zechariah chapter 4,
[36:35] starting with verse number five. Then
[36:38] the angel that taught with me answered
[36:41] and said unto me, "Knowest thou not, but
[36:45] these be?" And I said, "No, my lord."
[36:49] And he answered and spake unto me,
[36:51] saying, This is the word of the Lord
[36:54] unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might,
[36:58] not by power, but by my spirit, sayeth
[37:01] the Lord of hosts. Amen. Who art thou,
[37:04] oh great mountain before Zerubbable.
[37:07] Thou shalt become a plain, and he shall
[37:10] bring forth the headstone thereof with
[37:12] shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto it.
[37:15] Hallelujah. Moreover, the word of the
[37:17] Lord came unto me, saying, The hands of
[37:20] Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of
[37:23] this house. His hands shall also finish
[37:26] it, and thou shalt know the Lord of
[37:29] hosts have sent me unto you. Praise the
[37:32] Lord. For who have despised the day of
[37:35] small things, for they shall rejoice,
[37:37] and shall see the plummet in the hand of
[37:39] Zerubbable with those seven. They are
[37:42] the eyes of the Lord which run to and
[37:44] fro through the whole earth. Amen. And
[37:47] then just one verse here in Philippians
[37:50] chapter
[37:51] 1 verse uh number six very common verse
[37:56] for all of us probably can be quoted by
[37:59] most being confident of this very thing.
[38:03] He which have begun a good work in you
[38:06] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[38:08] Christ. Thank you Jesus. Amen. God bless
[38:10] you. may be seated. Amen. Amen. I
[38:13] believe it's always good to give thanks
[38:15] for the word of God. It's the it is what
[38:19] um it was in the beginning, it will be
[38:21] in the end, and it is what actually
[38:23] transforms us into a complete image of
[38:26] Jesus Christ. Amen. Is the word of God.
[38:29] We have a part to play. And that part is
[38:31] to believe it. Just believe it. You
[38:33] know, we can't we can't make it. God's
[38:36] already made it. We just have to believe
[38:37] it. Now, Zerubbabel was the head or the
[38:40] governor of the tribe of Judah. He was a
[38:43] descendant of King David through
[38:45] Solomon. And God told Zerubbabel through
[38:48] the prophet Zachchariah to rebuild the
[38:50] first temple which was Solomon's temple.
[38:53] Uh and that was about 65 years ago that
[38:56] it had had got destroyed at this time.
[38:58] So, Zerubbabel he accepted the
[39:01] responsibility of rebuilding the new
[39:04] Jerusalem temple. Wow. And the
[39:07] rebuilding of the temple, it was a huge
[39:09] project.
[39:11] Uh and it became so difficult that
[39:14] Zerubbabel actually halted the project.
[39:16] He just
[39:18] stopped. All the work had stopped all
[39:20] together. The work of the building, the
[39:22] capital that it was kind of put on the
[39:24] back burner and Zerubbabo got greatly
[39:26] discouraged and disheartened and
[39:28] dismayed because of of the situation.
[39:32] Does anybody know why Sabobo stopped
[39:35] building the temple? Does anybody know?
[39:40] Does anybody know? Good. Good. So, we
[39:42] were learning here today. Okay. The
[39:44] temple was stopped because of their
[39:49] adversaries. Even though it was a huge
[39:51] undertaking and it wasn't too great that
[39:53] it couldn't get done, but because of
[39:55] their adversaries, the work had stopped.
[39:58] See, the enemy wanted did not want the
[40:01] building to be rebuilt. Amen. Amen. And
[40:04] was working against Zerubbabel and he
[40:07] discouraged him and they stopped and and
[40:09] and in fact the scripture tells us that
[40:11] later a decree from the Persian king
[40:14] came against him and the enemy
[40:15] successfully persuaded the king to halt
[40:18] the project altogether. True.
[40:22] And see I believe this is a a perfect
[40:25] type of the believer today. Amen. As we
[40:28] send that song, know ye not, ye are the
[40:30] temple of the living God. Amen. And
[40:33] every person surrenders their life to
[40:35] God. And God begins to build our temple
[40:38] for his
[40:39] dwelling. And Jesus said, I say unto
[40:42] thee that thou are Peter upon this rock.
[40:44] I'll build my church and the gates of
[40:45] hell shall not prevail. So there's God
[40:47] is building his his temple inside of us,
[40:51] right? And the the church is is built
[40:54] upon the revealing of who Christ is. As
[40:57] as we as we read the word, as we pray,
[40:59] as we come to church, as we listen to
[41:01] tapes, that word uh uh becomes real to
[41:05] us. And as it becomes real to us, we
[41:08] recognize two things. One, who Christ
[41:10] is. And when we know who he is, since
[41:12] we're attached to him, we now get the
[41:14] revelation of who we are. Amen.
[41:18] and and and and so there's this as we
[41:20] realize who we are, then we we know that
[41:23] the gates of hell can't even prevail
[41:24] against because we're we're a part of
[41:26] Christ. We're the bride of Christ. And
[41:28] and so there's this building uh project
[41:31] that that's going on and we've been
[41:33] predestinated to be conformed into the
[41:35] image of Christ. And we're told in the
[41:38] scriptures that we need to keep adding
[41:40] to the temple. Yeah. Right. the divine
[41:42] nature of God so he can come and dwell
[41:45] in second Peter 1:5 says that besides
[41:47] this giving all diligence add to your
[41:50] faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge
[41:52] temperance temperance patience patience
[41:54] godliness and godliness brotherly
[41:55] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[41:57] charity see there's a building that's
[42:00] going on here and that you got to give
[42:02] diligence to the building project
[42:06] statue of a the bride of Christ is the
[42:09] building of God's character in the
[42:10] believer
[42:11] And we are mar we are made partakers of
[42:14] Christ if we don't start but if we
[42:18] finish. I want to give you two
[42:19] scriptures. They're both Hebrews 3.
[42:21] Hebrews 3:14. For we are made partakers
[42:24] of Christ if we hold the beginning
[42:26] confidence steadfast until the end.
[42:30] Now even though Zerubbabo had started
[42:33] the rebuilding of the project, he got
[42:36] discouraged because of the enemy and he
[42:39] quit. Now, unfortunately, even though
[42:41] his intentions was good, he started the
[42:43] project, he was moving in the right
[42:45] direction, the building never got
[42:47] completed. And we're hearing in the
[42:49] scriptures, we are not made partakers of
[42:52] Christ if we start, we get baptized.
[42:54] We're made partakers of Christ if we
[42:56] hold the beginning of our confidence
[42:59] steadfast to the end. Amen.
[43:03] Verse six of the same chapter says, "But
[43:05] Christ as a son over his own house, his
[43:09] own drown, whose house we are, if we
[43:12] hold fast the confidence and the
[43:14] rejoicing of hope, firm to the end."
[43:17] Amen. So, we've got to finish the
[43:19] temple. We've got to finish the project.
[43:22] Yeah. Amen.
[43:25] Now, in the process of this enormous
[43:29] building project that's going on in our
[43:31] lives, there's an adversary that's
[43:34] obviously trying to discourage us.
[43:38] It's trying to hinder the process, slow
[43:40] the work down, and finally just get it
[43:43] to stop all together.
[43:45] Like, why should I try anymore? Right?
[43:48] Nothing seems to be progressing. No one
[43:50] seems to care, right? I can't seem to
[43:52] overcome this part. True. Why isn't
[43:55] anybody helping me? And we're just kind
[43:57] of left there alone just wondering how
[44:00] this thing is going to get finished.
[44:02] Amen. First Peter 5:7 says, "Casting all
[44:06] your care upon him
[44:09] for he carth for you." Thank you, Jesus.
[44:12] Thank you, Father. Be sober. Be vigilant
[44:15] because your adversary, the devil, is a
[44:17] roaring lion. He walketh about seeking
[44:19] whom he may devour.
[44:22] So he's out there trying to stop the
[44:24] building project. Whom resist steadfast
[44:28] in what? The faith. Oh, I wish I would
[44:32] have brought the pyramid. I meant to
[44:34] bring the pyramid with me. Whom resist
[44:37] steadfast in the faith, knowing that the
[44:39] same afflictions are accomplished in
[44:41] your brethren in the world. So I just
[44:42] want to say this. Whatever we're going
[44:43] through,
[44:45] so is everybody else. That's right.
[44:48] Well, that's right. We're all in a
[44:50] battle. We're We're all facing
[44:52] difficulties. We all have things to
[44:54] overcome. Amen. The devil is trying to
[44:58] stop everybody's building project all
[45:00] over the world. It It's not just us. And
[45:03] we're not the one that's that's got it
[45:05] the hardest.
[45:07] I know the devil that's part of that's
[45:09] what the what the devil wants us to to
[45:11] feel like, but it's not true. True. And
[45:13] and God wants us to cast our cares upon
[45:16] him. Just cast it upon him. He cares.
[45:19] He'll see us through. Hallelujah. The
[45:22] devil's fighting against us. He's
[45:23] allowed to God's allowed it to do that.
[45:25] He's trying to get our enthusiasm just
[45:27] to just kind of
[45:30] not enthused anymore. Not as excited as
[45:33] I was when I was became a Christian and
[45:35] I got baptized. just trying to suppress
[45:38] that that that love for God and that
[45:41] that excitement to come into his image
[45:43] and it all be if we're not careful it
[45:46] becomes like a a religion just to go
[45:48] into church and and just do your duties
[45:51] and say a little prayer here a little
[45:53] reading here and before you know it
[45:54] there's there's really nothing building
[45:56] going on. It's just a form of godliness.
[46:00] Amen. True. And Jesus is teaching us to
[46:03] finish the race, to don't just have a
[46:06] foundation, but to finish the building.
[46:07] Here in Luke 14:28, he says, "For which
[46:10] of you intending to build a tower siteth
[46:13] not that down first, and countth the
[46:15] cost, whether he have sufficient to
[46:18] finish it, right? Happily, after you
[46:22] have laid the foundation, got baptized,
[46:25] right? and is not able to finish it. All
[46:29] that behold it began to mock him. That's
[46:32] right. Saying this man began to build
[46:35] and was not able to finish. God is
[46:38] wanting us to finish the project.
[46:42] Did you know the closer you get to the
[46:44] top of that pyramid, the more narrow it
[46:48] becomes?
[46:49] That means all the people that were down
[46:51] here in the foundation of faith, they
[46:54] can't even fit up there in love. They
[46:57] can't. There's not enough room.
[47:01] Because as you get closer to Christ,
[47:04] people start falling off because it's
[47:06] too hard, ain't worth it. I thought I
[47:09] thought I only had to do was this and
[47:10] every, you know, believe, get baptized,
[47:12] I'm saved. That's all I thought. And
[47:13] then and then there's there's no vision
[47:15] to be just like Jesus. Amen.
[47:20] The top of the pyramid is charity.
[47:23] It's the capstone of God's grace. Amen.
[47:27] And I'll say it like this. I believe too
[47:29] many believers have left off the
[47:30] capstone.
[47:32] I believe too many believers have left
[47:34] off the capstone. I'll say it 25 times
[47:37] if I need to say it, but it's the truth.
[47:43] The prophet told us that whatever we do,
[47:45] we need to get perfect love. We need to
[47:47] get the capstone.
[47:51] I'll say it's the it's the completion of
[47:53] God's building. That's right. Sure. And
[47:55] and we're we're we're not interested
[47:58] We're not in a church that's just
[47:59] interested in getting saved. No. We're
[48:02] not in a church that's just interested
[48:03] in getting prospered by God.
[48:06] We're in a church that believes in
[48:08] becoming in the image of Christ so we
[48:10] can be his bride. Amen.
[48:13] So that's a little bit higher standard.
[48:14] Amen. It's not it's not using God for
[48:17] salvation. It's not using God for
[48:19] prosperity. It's allowing God to come
[48:21] into our life and change us into his
[48:22] image. It's a much different vision.
[48:27] And so here in Colossians 3:12, the
[48:30] scripture tells us to put on therefore
[48:34] as the elect of God. Not just just a
[48:38] regular churchgoer now, but as the elect
[48:41] of God, put on holy and beloved bowels
[48:44] of mercy. Bows of mercy. Amen. Kindness,
[48:49] sir. humbleness of mind and meekness and
[48:54] longsuffering, forbearing one another,
[48:56] forgiving one another. And if any man
[48:59] have ever qu, even as Christ forgave
[49:02] you, so also do ye. Right? Now, this is
[49:05] pretty strong because if you think about
[49:08] it, all the quarrels that God has had
[49:11] against you, us,
[49:13] they're rightly so. Amen. We've done
[49:16] them. God has never accused us for
[49:18] something we didn't do. Like he's never
[49:20] accused me for go robbing a bank because
[49:21] I never robbed a bank. But whatever I
[49:24] have done and I've been accused of,
[49:27] I'm guilty of and he forgave me. So
[49:31] whatever anybody has ever done to you,
[49:33] even though they've done it, you have
[49:35] the responsibility of forgiving them
[49:37] just like Christ forgave you.
[49:40] Now that's what the bride puts on.
[49:43] Not the regular church goer. Now, right,
[49:46] right. And look at this verse 14.
[49:50] But, but where's our verse 14? But
[49:54] above, if you got your Bibles,
[49:56] Colossians 3:14, and above all these
[49:59] things, put on charity.
[50:03] Put on charity. Put it on. Above all of
[50:06] these things that we just read about,
[50:08] put on charity.
[50:12] Bless the Lord.
[50:13] which is the bond of perfectness. Amen.
[50:18] And let the peace of God ruin your
[50:20] hearts to the which also you are called
[50:23] in one body. And be ye thankful. Amen.
[50:26] Oh, amen. I'll tell you, if we could
[50:29] just do the word, our lives would
[50:31] change. That's true.
[50:35] Just fall in that place of thankfulness.
[50:38] Fall in that place of being at peace.
[50:41] fall in that place of, you know what, my
[50:43] priority is to put on
[50:48] charity. You
[50:50] know, I'm all about agreeing with the
[50:53] word, but I'm more
[50:56] about hungering and thirsting to see
[50:58] that word in me so that when I leave
[51:01] that I'm actually putting in to practice
[51:05] this word so I can come into his image.
[51:09] Amen. Saint wants to get us so
[51:11] distracted. He don't want us to work on
[51:13] building and finishing the temple. He
[51:16] wants us to keep us in a in a place of
[51:18] just, well, we'll let everybody else do
[51:20] it in church. We'll let everybody else
[51:22] fix the problem. We'll let everybody
[51:24] else dealing with it. We'll just There's
[51:25] like no caring about building, right?
[51:29] It's a wrong spirit. Yeah.
[51:32] It's wrong spirit. And and to be honest
[51:35] with you, I'm not saying that we don't
[51:39] have Christ. What I'm trying to minister
[51:41] is that we need all of Christ.
[51:44] That we all need to come into his image.
[51:46] Yes, sir. And and it it the only way
[51:48] that'll happen is if you you're willing
[51:50] to take on the responsibility like
[51:52] Zerubbabo did. So no matter how
[51:55] difficult it may seem, our building
[51:57] needs to be completed for a rapture.
[52:00] And this is Christ working his will in
[52:02] our lives. Amen. And his will is that we
[52:05] put the the capstone of love upon us.
[52:08] Right? So, we can't just do this work,
[52:12] this God's work by ourselves. It takes
[52:15] God to do the work of God. We need a
[52:17] great master builder. And this is
[52:19] Christ. And what did the angel tell
[52:22] Zerubbabel? He said in uh uh Zechariah
[52:26] 4:6, he said, "And the word of the Lord
[52:29] uh this is the word of the Lord unto
[52:31] Relo saying, not by might, not by power,
[52:35] but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord of
[52:37] hosts." Amen. So now we are looking to
[52:40] the Holy Spirit to do this in our lives.
[52:45] Not our own ability. We're looking to
[52:47] God to do it. Our faith is in God to do
[52:50] it. Hallelujah. And then this question
[52:53] comes, who art thou, oh great mountain?
[52:56] Think about the mountains in your life.
[52:57] Who art thou? Who art thou great
[53:00] mountain? Before Zerubbable, thou shalt
[53:02] become a plain. Praise the Lord.
[53:08] Thank you, Jesus. You have that faith.
[53:11] Nothing shall be able to stand before
[53:13] you.
[53:15] Nothing. And he shall bring forth thee
[53:18] headstone.
[53:20] In other words, this church is going to
[53:22] be completed. He's going to bring forth
[53:24] the headstone there uh thereof with
[53:27] shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto it.
[53:31] Hallelujah. It's going to happen. Amen.
[53:34] There will be a bride. There will be
[53:36] somebody that comes into the full image
[53:38] of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[53:44] We need to have our faith up here and
[53:46] not dwelling down here where the devil
[53:48] wants us, where the adversary wants us.
[53:51] Having our mind down on these problems,
[53:54] right? Get them up at heavenly places
[53:56] where God can lift us up above. We're
[53:58] eagles.
[54:00] We're eagles. Amen.
[54:04] Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto
[54:06] me, saying, "The hand of Zerubbabable
[54:09] have laid the
[54:10] foundation. His hands also shall finish
[54:14] it." Praise the Lord. "And thou shall
[54:16] know that the Lord of hosts have sent me
[54:18] unto you." Now, notice
[54:20] this. Not by power, not by might, but by
[54:22] my spirit. Verse nine, telling us that
[54:26] Zerubbabel laid the foundation and
[54:29] Zerubbabel is going to finish it. Right?
[54:32] I want you to understand this that you
[54:34] are workers together with Christ. You
[54:36] play a part in this building. Amen.
[54:39] Sure. And I'm going to prove it in the
[54:41] scriptures here just a little bit as we
[54:43] go on. But God is going to move
[54:45] mountains out of our life. Thank you,
[54:47] Jesus. And I believe that whatever is
[54:50] standing before the bride, it's going to
[54:52] be made a plain. Praise the Lord. And
[54:55] and God is going to bring the capstone
[54:57] of love down upon our lives. Not by
[54:59] power, not by might, not by our efforts.
[55:01] Right? But by us having a a love
[55:04] relationship with Jesus Christ, loving
[55:06] his word, wanting to obey his word every
[55:09] day and that love comes down and says,
[55:11] "Yes, this is this is my house." Amen.
[55:16] Thank you, Father. Now, what will
[55:18] accompany this capstone coming down?
[55:21] What will accompany this capstone coming
[55:23] down?
[55:26] shoutings,
[55:28] crying, grace, grace onto it.
[55:34] You just think about your lives the last
[55:36] couple weeks, how much you've been
[55:39] shouting, "Thank you for the grace of
[55:41] God in my life."
[55:46] I think too often we talk about our
[55:49] problems so much, Amen. that we we see
[55:53] grace in a far distance.
[55:57] I believe that we need to come into the
[55:59] place where we're just shouting, "It's
[56:01] been the grace of God in my life. I've
[56:03] seen God's grace everywhere in my life."
[56:06] And just shouting, "Grace, grace."
[56:08] That's all I see is the grace of God in
[56:10] my life. Hallelujah.
[56:13] Verse nine, the hands of Zer rubble have
[56:15] laid the foundation. His hand also shall
[56:17] finish it. Thou shalt know that the Lord
[56:19] of hosts have sent me unto you. It was
[56:22] by God's spirit, but yet the hand of
[56:26] Zerubbabel had actually was the one that
[56:30] finished the the
[56:32] temple. And what was in Zerubbabel's
[56:34] hand? Does anybody know? Verse 10
[56:37] reveals to us what was in Zerubbabel's
[56:39] hand. For who have despised the day of
[56:42] small things? For they shall rejoice and
[56:44] shall see the plummet in the hand of
[56:47] Zerubbabible with those seven. So what
[56:50] was in Zerubbable's hand was the word of
[56:52] God.
[56:54] That's what that's what the plum line
[56:56] was. That's what he made level. That's
[56:58] what he made straight. That's what he
[57:00] that's what he made everything in his
[57:02] life was according to the word of God.
[57:04] And if you keep the word, if you keep
[57:07] the word and you go by the word, you're
[57:09] going to finish the tabernacle. You're
[57:11] going to finish the tabernac. But if you
[57:12] set that aside, well, this is what I
[57:14] think. This is how things should go.
[57:15] This is how it should be.
[57:18] The only thing you're going to do is
[57:19] build some messed up house, right? It
[57:22] won't be a dwelling for God. I don't
[57:23] care how religious or how important you
[57:25] think you are or how much God loves you.
[57:27] God is going to dwell in his word, and
[57:29] that's all he's going to dwell in. We
[57:31] need to become the word.
[57:35] That needs to become our priority. Amen.
[57:39] The plummet is the word of God. It's
[57:42] what we measure everything in our lives
[57:45] by.
[57:46] Take God's word for your life. Become
[57:48] more serious about building your temple.
[57:51] Don't rely on just um a church or or or
[57:55] some bread of life card or or or some
[57:59] some text or something somebody sends
[58:02] you or something pops up and says,
[58:04] "Well, that must be a a word, you know,
[58:06] to help me to encourage me today." or
[58:08] something like that. Look, we need to
[58:10] get a vision. The vision that temple
[58:12] needs to be built and that we need to
[58:14] have put our heart into it. Accept the
[58:17] responsibility that we're going to take
[58:19] this word more seriously in our lives.
[58:21] True.
[58:22] True. And then walk with more of a
[58:25] confidence. That's right. Being conf I
[58:28] want to take I want to take some
[58:30] scriptures out of four different
[58:32] chapters in Philippians. First one is
[58:34] our opening scripture. Philippians 1:6.
[58:37] Being confident, thinking about this
[58:38] building now, that's why we're going
[58:39] through these scriptures. Being
[58:41] confident of this very thing, that he
[58:44] which have begun a good work in you will
[58:46] perform it until the day of Jesus
[58:48] Christ. God is not going to leave us
[58:51] unbuilt. Amen. It's not going to do it.
[58:55] It's not in his mind. It's not in his
[58:58] thoughts. I have an expected end for
[59:00] you.
[59:01] Right. I I to give us peace and a an
[59:06] ending in our life that that God can
[59:08] come and and dwell inside us. I'll tell
[59:10] you when God is inside you got peace,
[59:12] you got love, you got joy, you got
[59:14] everything that you could possibly, you
[59:15] got so much that you can literally go
[59:17] through the fire. Never get burnt.
[59:20] Hallelujah. Amen. Because his his spirit
[59:24] has a way of just numbing everything
[59:25] else in your life. Amen. Amen. Okay. The
[59:29] next one is in Philippians chapter 2
[59:31] starting with verse 12. Wherefore my
[59:34] beloved, as you have always obeyed, not
[59:36] in my presence only, but now much more
[59:39] in my absence, work out your own
[59:41] salvation with fear and trembling.
[59:44] So now we got to work on working out
[59:47] this this
[59:50] this building of our temple, right?
[59:55] I can't rely on Brother Ron to build for
[59:58] me. I can't. I love Brother Ron. Could
[1:00:01] ask him to pray,
[1:00:04] but he's got his He's got his own task,
[1:00:06] and that's to build his own temple.
[1:00:11] Amen.
[1:00:14] I am the one that needs fear and
[1:00:16] trembling. I am the one that needs
[1:00:18] respect to God's word. I am the one that
[1:00:21] needs to make sure that I got the
[1:00:23] plummet in my hand and then I'm doing
[1:00:24] what I need to do.
[1:00:29] I can't rely on anybody else. That means
[1:00:32] I must be like Zerubbabel. Take upon me
[1:00:34] the responsibility of building
[1:00:38] this. We're hearing in the scripture
[1:00:40] that we're to work out our own
[1:00:42] salvation, work out this own tabernacle
[1:00:44] with fear and trembling. And then he
[1:00:46] goes on to say, "For it is God which
[1:00:49] workketh in you both to will and to do
[1:00:53] of his good pleasure." So we know that
[1:00:55] every time God comes to us, he's not
[1:00:57] going to come to us with a pat on the
[1:00:58] back doing a good job. You're in the
[1:01:00] message.
[1:01:03] He's not going to do that. Amen. He's
[1:01:05] going to come to you and he says, "You
[1:01:06] know what? I want to work on something
[1:01:08] with you." That's right. Amen. You mean
[1:01:11] God, you're not happy with me. You're
[1:01:12] not satisfied with me. You're not
[1:01:13] content. You're just always always
[1:01:14] wanting more.
[1:01:17] There is a part of God that says, "I
[1:01:19] have many things." Look here, the very
[1:01:22] fact that he makes this statement,
[1:01:23] "You've been predestinated to be
[1:01:25] conformed to the image of his son." Wow.
[1:01:29] Wonderful. For me to say, I'm in his
[1:01:33] image.
[1:01:35] Humble yourself
[1:01:38] before your Lord and King.
[1:01:42] I can't go there in my mind, in my
[1:01:45] thoughts. I have to stay in this place
[1:01:47] that God is still working on me. God is
[1:01:50] still calling me to do something. God is
[1:01:52] still working in something in my life.
[1:01:55] Amen. So, we need to be encouraged that
[1:01:58] the fact is that we will be working on
[1:02:00] this building until we're out of here.
[1:02:03] Brother Brandon says, "God ain't going
[1:02:04] to take somebody until he's most ready
[1:02:06] to go." The fact that you're here proves
[1:02:09] that God wants to work in your life.
[1:02:14] For it is God which workketh in you both
[1:02:16] to will and to do of his good pleasure.
[1:02:18] So do all things without murmuring right
[1:02:22] and disputing.
[1:02:25] When's the last time you went one day,
[1:02:28] just one day and didn't murmur and
[1:02:31] complain in your mind? In your mind.
[1:02:40] It's a real scripture.
[1:02:42] When's the last time you went one day
[1:02:43] and you didn't have one murmur and
[1:02:44] complain come out of your mouth?
[1:02:49] Look, you need to get serious with the
[1:02:50] word. That's all there is to it. Before
[1:02:53] you know it, you start the rumble and
[1:02:55] all of a sudden the enemy is in camp.
[1:02:58] The enemy is in your camp. And you stop
[1:03:01] the building. You start murmuring. No,
[1:03:02] it's not God. God's not doing this. This
[1:03:04] is just everybody else, right?
[1:03:08] All right. The next one is going to be
[1:03:10] in chapter 3. Philippians chapter 3.
[1:03:11] We're talking about building our
[1:03:13] building and our attitude. What we need
[1:03:15] to do to get the building built. So, we
[1:03:17] got to be confident. We got to let God
[1:03:19] do his work. Philippians chapter 3:13.
[1:03:21] Brethren, I count not myself to have
[1:03:25] apprehended. Right? But this one thing I
[1:03:28] do, I'm forgetting those things which
[1:03:29] are
[1:03:30] behind this this this enemy that's
[1:03:33] discouraged me that's that's got me off
[1:03:35] track and I'm reaching forth unto those
[1:03:38] things which are before which is a a
[1:03:40] finished tabernacle, a finished temple.
[1:03:44] I press towards the mark for the prize
[1:03:46] of the high calling of Christ of God in
[1:03:49] Christ Jesus. I am pressing towards a
[1:03:52] capstone. That's right. That's right.
[1:03:54] message that the prophet brought back
[1:03:56] when we went beyond the curtain of time
[1:03:57] was get perfect love. Now, I say for the
[1:04:01] most part, it's going to be hard to get
[1:04:02] that if we don't even get a revelation
[1:04:04] of what that is.
[1:04:06] Right. Everybody's got an opinion of
[1:04:08] what love is. Yeah. Right.
[1:04:12] But then he says, you know, get to the
[1:04:13] place where you can love everybody.
[1:04:16] You can't even love your enemy. Yeah.
[1:04:18] Are you there? You know what? All you
[1:04:20] got to do is go one day and see if
[1:04:22] you're murmur and complain about
[1:04:23] something. You'll find out how much you
[1:04:24] got. You'll find out how much you got.
[1:04:28] If you hold yourself accountable, if you
[1:04:30] hold the plummet in your hand, wow. To
[1:04:35] put on per perfectness, to put on
[1:04:37] charity, put on the capstone, if you
[1:04:39] hold it in your hand, and you line your
[1:04:42] life up with this. Amen. You'll become
[1:04:44] it. But you set it aside. Say, "Well,
[1:04:46] this is the way I think.
[1:04:49] I'm just doing the best I can to just,
[1:04:51] you know, make it through the day. Cast
[1:04:53] your cares upon him. Get down in the
[1:04:56] prayer closet. Get get alone with God.
[1:04:59] Get something to where the building can
[1:05:01] start going.
[1:05:03] Come on now. This is a message for the
[1:05:06] bride today. That's right.
[1:05:10] Philippians, the next one is in the last
[1:05:12] chapter of Philippians. Philippians
[1:05:13] chapter
[1:05:14] 4:13 says, "I can do all things through
[1:05:20] the plummet." Amen. To Christ.
[1:05:23] This is what gives me strength. Amen.
[1:05:26] Now, I don't Now understand, I'm not
[1:05:30] just meaning the the written word. It's
[1:05:32] not by power, not by might, but it's by
[1:05:34] the spirit word. By the spirit word,
[1:05:37] right? That's what gives me strength.
[1:05:40] True. They that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:05:43] renew their strength. Wait, I say again,
[1:05:46] wait on the Lord. Amen. He'll give you
[1:05:50] strength to get serious about this
[1:05:52] becoming the temple of the living God
[1:05:54] and to finish it. It's not about who
[1:05:57] started. We've all started, right? We've
[1:05:59] all started. But how many people have
[1:06:01] left the church? How many people have
[1:06:03] left?
[1:06:07] And one of the biggest tricks of the
[1:06:08] devil he starts with, he gets the people
[1:06:11] to leave before they left. Oh yes. Just
[1:06:15] like the children of Israel, they left
[1:06:16] in their heart. They were still in the
[1:06:19] presence of God getting blessed. Shoes
[1:06:21] didn't wear out, but in their heart they
[1:06:23] stopped building.
[1:06:32] We need the strength of God to continue
[1:06:34] to move forward.
[1:06:37] And you have to believe with this faith.
[1:06:39] I can do all things through Christ. You
[1:06:41] strengthen me. Verse 19, count it. Just
[1:06:44] trust in this. But my God shall supply
[1:06:46] all of your need according to his riches
[1:06:49] and glory by Christ Jesus. Amen. My God.
[1:06:51] Paul's talking about my God. Not your
[1:06:54] God, but my God. We're testifying of our
[1:06:57] God. Our God owns the cattle on a
[1:06:59] thousand hill. Our God is able to do
[1:07:01] exceedingly above all that we would ask
[1:07:03] or think. Our God is able to supply all
[1:07:06] of our needs according to his riches and
[1:07:08] glory. Now, if we believe the plummet,
[1:07:10] it'll happen. Amen. Amen. And if we
[1:07:13] don't believe it, don't murmur and
[1:07:15] complain.
[1:07:21] Now what will
[1:07:23] accompany the capstone coming down?
[1:07:27] Shoutings, crying grace, grace onto it.
[1:07:32] all this whole process here, this
[1:07:35] building, being confident and let God
[1:07:38] work his will in your life and and
[1:07:40] pressing towards and and and and just
[1:07:42] trusting that God's going to supply what
[1:07:44] should be coming out of our mouth and
[1:07:47] our life and our thoughts and our mind
[1:07:49] is grace. Grace. Praise you, Lord, for
[1:07:52] your grace.
[1:07:54] Not the not the problem that I'm stuck
[1:07:57] in. Not the situation that's keeping me
[1:07:59] down. Because if we stare at that, it
[1:08:02] it's going to take away from us um with
[1:08:05] that expectation that that God is going
[1:08:08] to take care of the this this mountain
[1:08:10] that's standing in the way. It's got to
[1:08:12] be made flat. The capstone's got to come
[1:08:14] and sit on it.
[1:08:18] Now, just say you have a part to play.
[1:08:21] Jesus.
[1:08:25] We need to magnify the grace of God in
[1:08:27] our lives.
[1:08:29] Magnify it.
[1:08:32] Magnify it.
[1:08:34] I tell you, if God would have came to
[1:08:36] Zerubbabel with the word of the Lord,
[1:08:38] the temple would have never got
[1:08:39] finished. But because the word of the
[1:08:41] Lord came to the came to Zerubbabable
[1:08:43] and said, "By your hand, this temple is
[1:08:46] going to be completed.
[1:08:51] It won't be by power and might. It'll be
[1:08:53] by my spirit. But I'm going to use you.
[1:08:55] You're going to believe in my word.
[1:08:56] You're going to hold my plumb. You're
[1:08:57] going to believe it. It's going to
[1:08:58] happen in your life. Whatever you can
[1:09:00] say for your life, it'll happen.
[1:09:02] Wherever the souls of your feet shall
[1:09:03] tread upon, it is yours. Amen. It just
[1:09:07] it being unto you according to your
[1:09:08] faith, Jesus said. True.
[1:09:11] So, where do you stand with your
[1:09:13] problem? What are you looking at? Are
[1:09:15] you looking at your mountain?
[1:09:19] I just say like this. The more that you
[1:09:21] can reflect on the grace of God in your
[1:09:24] life,
[1:09:26] the more it'll encourage you to believe
[1:09:27] that God's going to push you forward.
[1:09:29] Amen.
[1:09:32] It's the devil's trick to get you
[1:09:33] looking at your problem.
[1:09:35] What we need today is a greater
[1:09:37] revelation of the grace of God.
[1:09:41] Not just I want this is so important.
[1:09:44] We're going to get into something. is
[1:09:45] not just the grace of God for us or
[1:09:49] towards us, but the grace of God inside
[1:09:52] of us. It's two different things.
[1:10:00] There are so many scriptures in the
[1:10:02] Bible that that express the grace of
[1:10:04] God.
[1:10:06] They are the very foundation of of of of
[1:10:09] our building is literally by grace. And
[1:10:11] I want to go through at least this one.
[1:10:13] We all know the pyramid of uh faith is
[1:10:16] the bottom of it. Right? Faith is the
[1:10:18] bottom and everything is built on that.
[1:10:21] Ephesians chapter 2 verse4. But but God
[1:10:24] who is rich in mercy for his great love
[1:10:28] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[1:10:30] dead in sins have quickened us together
[1:10:32] with Christ. By grace are you saved.
[1:10:36] Amen. There's that grace. that the very
[1:10:38] foundation of our salvation is by grace
[1:10:44] and has raised us up together and made
[1:10:45] us to sit in heavenly places um in
[1:10:48] Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he
[1:10:50] might show the exceeding riches of his
[1:10:52] grace in the ages to come he might um
[1:10:56] show the exceeding riches of his grace
[1:10:57] in his kindness towards us through Jesus
[1:10:59] Christ for by grace are you saved what
[1:11:04] through faith there's there's the
[1:11:06] plummet
[1:11:07] I There there's the part you
[1:11:09] play. There's enough grace to save the
[1:11:12] world, but grace alone can't save you.
[1:11:14] You've got to have faith in the grace.
[1:11:18] And so, you've got to have faith that
[1:11:20] God is going to move the mountain, that
[1:11:22] God is going to finish your temple. It
[1:11:25] it don't stop. It's grace, grace, grace
[1:11:28] every step of the way.
[1:11:32] Without faith, it's impossible to please
[1:11:35] God. It is the foundation and every
[1:11:39] virtue and knowledge and patience,
[1:11:42] temperance, all those. You need each one
[1:11:45] of those to build.
[1:11:48] Without faith, you're not going to get
[1:11:51] strength. And you need strength, brother
[1:11:53] Ron, for every one of those things that
[1:11:55] you put on there because you got an
[1:11:57] enemy. You got an adversary that's
[1:11:58] coming at you and say, "No, you don't
[1:12:00] need this in your life. You're saved.
[1:12:02] That's all that matters." Right?
[1:12:04] You got you got the enemy coming and
[1:12:06] trying to discourage you. So you need
[1:12:09] strength. So you you build upon that.
[1:12:11] And that's how you build your your your
[1:12:13] tabernacle for God to come and dwell
[1:12:16] inside of you. And this is why it needs
[1:12:18] to be a a serious thing that we're we're
[1:12:21] we're giving all diligence to
[1:12:24] add add the virtues of Christ, the
[1:12:27] character of Christ to to build our
[1:12:30] tabernacle that God can come and live
[1:12:32] inside. And every time one of those is
[1:12:36] laid in her life, I believe that that it
[1:12:39] is the grace of God that you got virtue.
[1:12:42] It is the grace of God that you got uh
[1:12:45] patience and and and temperance and and
[1:12:48] brotherly kindness. It is the grace of
[1:12:50] God. And I'll tell you, the bride of
[1:12:52] Christ is just shouting grace, grace,
[1:12:55] grace. And they're looking forward for
[1:12:57] the capstone to come down and cap their
[1:13:00] life with a perfect love. Not some
[1:13:02] makebelieve, not some I'll fake it or
[1:13:04] paint it. It's a real genuine thing.
[1:13:06] They can stab you in the back. They can
[1:13:08] talk about you. It don't matter. But the
[1:13:10] love of God is shed abroad in your heart
[1:13:12] by the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:14] It's a real thing.
[1:13:18] I can do all things through Christ that
[1:13:20] strengthenth me. This building can be
[1:13:27] built all the way up to the capstone of
[1:13:30] God's divine love inside of the
[1:13:33] believer.
[1:13:36] Now he goes on to say, "But if these
[1:13:37] things be in you and abound, they make
[1:13:39] you that you should neither be barren
[1:13:40] nor fruitful in the knowledge of Jesus
[1:13:42] Christ. But if you lack these things,
[1:13:44] you're blind. You can't see a far off.
[1:13:45] And you've even forgotten what even
[1:13:47] started in your life, which was the
[1:13:49] grace of God that purged your sins."
[1:13:54] We got to keep crying grace. Hey, you're
[1:13:57] either going to cry grace, grace, grace,
[1:13:58] or you're going to cry problem, problem,
[1:14:00] problem.
[1:14:05] True. John chapter 1 verse 16 and
[1:14:09] 17. John chapter 1 verse 16 and 17. And
[1:14:13] of his fullness have we all
[1:14:17] received grace for
[1:14:22] grace of his fullness have we all
[1:14:27] received.
[1:14:31] and grace.
[1:14:34] Grace for the law was given by Moses,
[1:14:37] but grace and truth came by Jesus
[1:14:40] Christ. Remember Jesus didn't come to do
[1:14:43] away with the law. He came
[1:14:48] to what is the fulfillment of the
[1:14:51] law? The fulfillment of the law was to
[1:14:54] be able to truly forgive everyone that
[1:14:57] couldn't keep all the law.
[1:15:03] That's what the fulfillment of the law
[1:15:06] was. That's why he could take that woman
[1:15:08] who was caught in adultery and said,
[1:15:10] "Neither do I condemn
[1:15:16] thee." That's why he could take Zachar
[1:15:18] uh
[1:15:20] uh Yes. Thank you, my
[1:15:22] brother. That's why he could take all of
[1:15:24] our lives that we could
[1:15:26] not fulfill the law. And you know what
[1:15:29] he
[1:15:30] did? He loved us and forgave us. Thank
[1:15:34] you.
[1:15:36] And you know what he taught us? His
[1:15:38] bride will have that same spirit. His
[1:15:41] bride will have that same spirit. She
[1:15:44] will fulfill the law. She will be able
[1:15:46] to forgive. She will be able to love.
[1:15:48] She will be able to cover. She'll be
[1:15:50] just like Jesus.
[1:15:56] God has given us grace.
[1:16:00] And as God has given us
[1:16:03] grace, the capstone will not come upon
[1:16:06] us unless we learn to be gracious
[1:16:09] towards others. Right? So I just want to
[1:16:11] stay here in this part for just a little
[1:16:13] bit. Grace for grace.
[1:16:19] God gives
[1:16:21] grace then we should become gracious to
[1:16:24] others.
[1:16:27] Jesus says if you don't forgive others
[1:16:29] their trespasses and sin he's right your
[1:16:31] heavenly father forgive you of yours.
[1:16:33] See grace for
[1:16:35] grace. You know there's a parable where
[1:16:38] there Jesus told us there was a debtor
[1:16:40] who owed lifetimes of
[1:16:43] debt and he was freely graciously
[1:16:48] forgiven of all his debt. And then he
[1:16:51] turned around to someone that owed him
[1:16:53] just a very little bit.
[1:16:58] And he wouldn't be gracious to him.
[1:17:02] No, you Oh, you shouldn't have done
[1:17:05] that. You don't talk to me that way.
[1:17:08] And what And what
[1:17:11] did the creditor came back and he said,
[1:17:14] "I'm taking your grace away." He says,
[1:17:17] "You owe me the whole thing." And he
[1:17:19] threw him in prison. Right? The very
[1:17:22] grace that was given, God took it away
[1:17:23] from him.
[1:17:26] If we do not give grace for grace, we're
[1:17:29] not getting more grace.
[1:17:32] This idea of, well, God saved me and I'm
[1:17:34] it's all glory to God, me and God, and I
[1:17:37] don't have to worry about how I treat my
[1:17:38] brother and sister, how I talk, how
[1:17:40] everybody knows I am. I am telling you,
[1:17:43] you are deceived.
[1:17:48] God gives us a chance. us what grace is.
[1:17:52] He gives us a chance to go out and do to
[1:17:54] others as they've done to us. As God has
[1:17:57] done for
[1:17:59] us. So God says, you know, I'm going to
[1:18:02] forgive you. You know what I want? I
[1:18:03] want to see me and you. I want to see me
[1:18:06] and you. You go forgive somebody just
[1:18:07] like I did. Now, you can't do it by your
[1:18:10] power and your might.
[1:18:13] But I tell you, if you get the goods, if
[1:18:16] you get the Holy Ghost, you can forgive.
[1:18:19] That's true.
[1:18:23] You know, I'm going to forgive you of
[1:18:24] your
[1:18:26] debt. You couldn't pay it anyways. He
[1:18:28] paid a debt. I I could not pay out of
[1:18:31] debt.
[1:18:35] And he says, "You know what? I'm going
[1:18:36] to give you some people in your life
[1:18:38] that are going to bother you and give
[1:18:40] you a little problem and you're going to
[1:18:41] get a little offended by them, but you
[1:18:43] know what? I'm going to give you an
[1:18:44] opportunity to just freely forgive them.
[1:18:51] or you can lean to your own
[1:18:52] understanding. I'm going to show them
[1:18:56] they're going to remember this down the
[1:18:58] road.
[1:18:59] And God said, "What? What? Where's our
[1:19:02] relationship? Didn't you just realize
[1:19:04] what I did with you?"
[1:19:07] And you know, it just it it
[1:19:09] just it astonishes me. I what I see,
[1:19:15] brother Landers, more people have a
[1:19:18] religion than a relationship.
[1:19:25] A relationship with Christ means it'll
[1:19:27] be lived with your brothers and sisters.
[1:19:31] We've got to learn to be gracious. We've
[1:19:34] got to It's just It's got to be our our
[1:19:37] our main focus. That's that's telling
[1:19:40] God, "I'm ready for more. I'm I'm I'm
[1:19:42] ready for more,
[1:19:44] Lord. The Bible tells us about those
[1:19:47] whose names were taken out of the book
[1:19:48] of life. So, they had grace to get there
[1:19:51] and now it was taken out. I wonder
[1:19:55] why. See, not everyone is going to be
[1:19:57] crying
[1:19:58] grace. Not everyone is going to be
[1:20:00] recognizing God's grace in their life.
[1:20:03] Some are going to feel more of an
[1:20:04] entitlement,
[1:20:06] like others owe them, like they're
[1:20:08] better than others, and they don't need
[1:20:10] to be gracious towards them for some
[1:20:11] reason.
[1:20:13] But not the bride. That is not the
[1:20:16] attitude of the bride. She has a
[1:20:18] revelation of the grace of God that it
[1:20:20] is progressive.
[1:20:23] And that the capstone is coming down on
[1:20:25] her. She's literally saying, "Grace,
[1:20:27] yes, you want grace. You you you're
[1:20:28] sorry. I forgive you." She's crying
[1:20:31] grace, grace to everybody. She wants the
[1:20:33] whole world and all about the grace of
[1:20:35] God. Not just bragging about the grace
[1:20:39] that God has on them, but the grace that
[1:20:41] lives inside.
[1:20:43] It's inside. Not just toward you or at
[1:20:46] you, but it's inside that you can give
[1:20:47] it out. It's like a fountain of grace
[1:20:51] inside of your life.
[1:20:56] of his fullness have we all received and
[1:21:00] grace for
[1:21:05] grace. Brother Ram talked about broken
[1:21:10] systems. Everybody knows what that is.
[1:21:12] That's a water comes in one way but
[1:21:15] nothing goes out.
[1:21:18] In other words, grace comes into a
[1:21:19] person's life but it can't come out.
[1:21:23] Becomes stagnant. Their life becomes
[1:21:25] stagnant.
[1:21:27] You don't want to drink from them. You
[1:21:28] don't want to get around them because
[1:21:29] it's always ugly what they're talking
[1:21:31] about. It's always something negative
[1:21:33] going on.
[1:21:35] This is like they all they want is grace
[1:21:37] for their life, but they don't want to
[1:21:39] do anything to do give grace to build
[1:21:41] the tabernacle to to finish the t to
[1:21:44] finish the temple. Amen.
[1:21:47] How many want more grace? All right.
[1:21:50] James chapter 4:6. But he giveth more
[1:21:55] grace. Wherefore he saith, God resists
[1:21:58] the proud,
[1:22:00] and he
[1:22:01] giveth grace unto the humble. Was that
[1:22:04] not our second song that we
[1:22:07] sung or right about that? I I somewhere
[1:22:09] in
[1:22:11] there. If we want more grace, humble
[1:22:15] ourselves before God.
[1:22:22] He he has a certain demeanor about him
[1:22:25] to those who are um a little proud, a
[1:22:32] little quietly arrogant, a little bit uh
[1:22:36] I I I'm not going to
[1:22:39] try. I don't feel like
[1:22:44] worshiping. You know why we don't
[1:22:46] worship?
[1:22:48] We're too proud.
[1:22:51] But I'll tell you what, there's not a
[1:22:53] moment in your life that you don't want
[1:22:54] somebody coming up to you and saying,
[1:22:56] "Good job."
[1:22:58] But we can't come into God's house and
[1:23:00] worship him.
[1:23:05] Well, Brother John, I worship him with
[1:23:06] my
[1:23:08] life. That's good. We need to do that.
[1:23:12] We need to do that.
[1:23:16] We need to worship him. How we're
[1:23:18] towards
[1:23:20] others, how we're forgiving and
[1:23:23] loving. That's how you worship Christ.
[1:23:25] You let grace come out. But I'm just
[1:23:27] saying if you want more grace, let go
[1:23:30] and let God have his way. Worship him.
[1:23:33] Shout grace. Grace. Thank you for saving
[1:23:36] my soul, Lord. I know it didn't happen
[1:23:38] today, but I I I believe in your
[1:23:40] salvation today. I believe in grace
[1:23:42] today. Shout it out. Amen. Submit
[1:23:46] yourselves therefore to God. Draw nigh
[1:23:49] to God. Amen.
[1:23:53] How do I do this? Verse N says, "Be
[1:23:54] afflicted. Mourn, weep. Let your
[1:23:56] laughter be turned to mourning, your joy
[1:23:58] to heaviness. Humble yourself in the
[1:24:01] sight of the Lord."
[1:24:03] You know, you know, too often people are
[1:24:05] just wanting everybody to know about
[1:24:08] them. I I don't get
[1:24:12] that. Instead of humbling yourself
[1:24:14] before the Lord, we want to lift oursel
[1:24:16] up in front of
[1:24:24] people. God is blessed are the pure in
[1:24:29] heart. God is calling us to humble
[1:24:32] oursel in him. Just be humble. Be
[1:24:36] real. Verse 11, speak not evil one of
[1:24:40] another.
[1:24:42] Brethren, he that speaketh evil of his
[1:24:44] brother and judgeth his brother speaketh
[1:24:46] evil of the law and and judgeth the law.
[1:24:49] But if thou uh judge the law, thou are
[1:24:51] not a doer of the law, but a
[1:24:54] judge. There is one lawgiver who is able
[1:24:57] to save and destroy. Who art thou that
[1:24:58] judges another? So here this thought
[1:25:01] process of saying something negative
[1:25:04] about anybody in your
[1:25:06] conversations. Well, brother Ron, this
[1:25:08] is just between me and you. But you know
[1:25:10] what? You know, Bob, I got a problem
[1:25:12] with
[1:25:14] Bob. You know, I just had this
[1:25:16] experience just between me and you. I
[1:25:18] can talk to you because you
[1:25:21] know, look, before you know it, our
[1:25:25] thoughts speak louder in heaven than our
[1:25:26] words here on earth. We can judge people
[1:25:29] all day long and never come out of our
[1:25:31] mouth.
[1:25:33] But if you want more grace, we just
[1:25:35] heard the
[1:25:37] scriptures. Say something good about
[1:25:39] somebody. Amen. I want to forgive that
[1:25:42] person. If that person did that to me, I
[1:25:44] would forgive them.
[1:25:47] Let it be
[1:25:50] real. Let it be
[1:25:53] real. All right. Colossians chapter 4.
[1:25:55] We're going to have to hurry
[1:25:58] because time is filled with swift
[1:26:02] transition. Colossians 4:5.
[1:26:06] Walk in wisdom toward them that are
[1:26:13] without
[1:26:15] redeeming. Walk in wisdom toward them
[1:26:19] that are. Now, let me just say this. If
[1:26:21] I'm going to walk in wisdom towards Ron,
[1:26:24] Brother Ron, sorry, brother. Um, I'm
[1:26:26] going to come and I'm going to say, you
[1:26:28] know what? I'm better than
[1:26:32] Ron. Hey, it's wisdom. It's worldly
[1:26:34] wisdom,
[1:26:35] strife,
[1:26:37] envy. I'm going to prove to Ron I know
[1:26:40] more than
[1:26:42] him because I'm going to redeem the
[1:26:44] time. I need him to know that he's under
[1:26:46] me. Or I can come to him with the with
[1:26:49] the wisdom of
[1:26:51] God, peace about, gentle, easy to be
[1:26:53] treated, full of full without
[1:26:55] partiality, full of compassion.
[1:27:00] Christ just calling the
[1:27:01] bride to walk in wisdom towards towards
[1:27:05] others to redeem the time. There's not
[1:27:07] much time. Every conversation that you
[1:27:09] have with somebody, it's either going to
[1:27:11] puff you up or you're going to try to
[1:27:12] edify somebody. You're trying to help
[1:27:13] somebody, right? Okay. So, what do I do?
[1:27:16] What's the next verse? Let your speech
[1:27:20] be always with grace.
[1:27:25] Shouting grace, grace, grace. Your
[1:27:29] conversation is grace with everything
[1:27:32] that comes out. God don't need you to be
[1:27:34] his spokesman.
[1:27:40] Well, I just got to set this thing in
[1:27:41] order.
[1:27:43] What you need to set in order is your
[1:27:45] tabernacle.
[1:27:46] What you need to set in order is your
[1:27:48] temple. What you need to do is let your
[1:27:50] conversation be always with grace.
[1:27:58] The bride is shouting grace in
[1:28:00] everything. Let your speech be always
[1:28:03] with grace, seasoned with salt, that you
[1:28:05] may know how you'll answer
[1:28:10] every problem with
[1:28:13] Bob. You know, I don't even need to know
[1:28:15] Christ. Put him in his place. You know
[1:28:18] what I'm saying? Answer
[1:28:21] this, right? It's just it's
[1:28:25] attitude. But you know what? If you
[1:28:27] don't have walk in the spirit and you
[1:28:29] not fulfill the lust of the flesh, you
[1:28:31] you you need to be walking in the Holy
[1:28:34] Spirit. You need to have the the the
[1:28:36] living plummet in your hand.
[1:28:38] How do I handle this, Lord?
[1:28:41] How do I talk about this? How do I deal
[1:28:43] with this? I want to finish this
[1:28:45] building. I know that these things that
[1:28:47] are coming in my life, they're just not
[1:28:48] by chance.
[1:28:50] God don't deal with us like some lottery
[1:28:52] ticket. Oh, you just got a bunch of
[1:28:53] problems. No, he specifically designed
[1:28:56] problems in your life to build a
[1:28:57] character that you need.
[1:29:00] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:29:04] Some believers never ever learn how to
[1:29:07] talk with grace.
[1:29:10] They don't. The only way you'll hear
[1:29:13] them talk
[1:29:15] nice is if you don't challenge them.
[1:29:19] Yeah.
[1:29:22] You don't ask them of anything.
[1:29:25] You don't show them a higher standard.
[1:29:28] You that you just got to tell them how
[1:29:30] great they are.
[1:29:32] And that's about the only way you can
[1:29:33] get them talk
[1:29:35] nice. That's why brother says take a big
[1:29:37] man to get underneath a a a little
[1:29:40] man. But some people never really learn
[1:29:43] because they they don't get they they're
[1:29:46] they're like that person that says, "No,
[1:29:47] you owe me. I'm entitled. You
[1:29:50] do instead of I've been forgiven so much
[1:29:52] I can't get my mind off of that. There's
[1:29:55] been so much grace in my life. Yeah. You
[1:29:56] want grace, Sister Linda. Brother Ben,
[1:29:58] you want Brother Mike? You want it?
[1:29:59] Sister Gabby, you want it? Yes. There's
[1:30:01] grace. Grace.
[1:30:07] That's where the bride at looking to
[1:30:10] give grace
[1:30:12] because you know what? It's not you now.
[1:30:15] It's Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:30:21] We know we can't do it,
[1:30:24] but he can. Yes, he can. And he spoke
[1:30:27] the word that he will have a bride. She
[1:30:31] will have the
[1:30:33] capstone. And it's coming with
[1:30:35] shoutings, with grace. Grace unto it.
[1:30:38] It's coming. Yes, sir.
[1:30:44] We just need to simply appreciate God's
[1:30:47] grace
[1:30:48] more. Brother Brandham said in the
[1:30:50] message church order, he says, "Don't
[1:30:52] ever get yourself puffed up to a place
[1:30:55] where you know more that that you know
[1:30:58] more about it than your pastor
[1:31:01] or the church or the church that you are
[1:31:05] worshiping in."
[1:31:08] He says, 'If you get to that place, then
[1:31:11] I would advise each of you to get to
[1:31:13] another place to worship with because
[1:31:17] I'm asking the pastor, Brother Neville,
[1:31:21] never to permit anything outside of
[1:31:23] Bible order, the way that has been set
[1:31:28] here in this church.
[1:31:33] See, we need to be careful how we're
[1:31:35] dealing with
[1:31:37] problems. Even in God's economy, the
[1:31:39] prophet is subject to the prophets.
[1:31:41] There's an order. There's not chaos.
[1:31:43] There's not confusion. And if you're not
[1:31:46] you're not thinking about the words
[1:31:47] you're saying, you're just speaking
[1:31:48] whatever you want to speak. It's going
[1:31:50] to usually cause confusion in the
[1:31:52] church.
[1:31:56] Yes. And so what we need to do is we
[1:31:59] need to with grace deal with things and
[1:32:03] and and if you have grace, you're going
[1:32:06] to receive more grace. It's grace for
[1:32:09] grace, not you owe me grace, but I'm not
[1:32:12] really too caring about you. That
[1:32:14] spirit, you can see it.
[1:32:18] But I believe that God has something
[1:32:20] special for his bride.
[1:32:23] Make a way for the capstone to come upon
[1:32:26] you. Brother B says, "Get to the place
[1:32:29] that you can love everyone, even your
[1:32:30] enemy."
[1:32:32] Some of us struggle at loving one
[1:32:35] another. Struggle at being gracious
[1:32:37] towards one another. Instead of letting
[1:32:39] your speech be always with grace, too
[1:32:41] often we don't even seem to care how
[1:32:43] other people feel about what we say.
[1:32:44] We're only interested in getting our
[1:32:46] point
[1:32:47] across. We don't care about how forward
[1:32:49] or rude we we may seem.
[1:32:52] We seem to care about having grace uh
[1:32:55] for ourselves but not for
[1:32:58] others. I mean sometimes don't even
[1:33:01] really care about unity at the expense
[1:33:02] of what we want.
[1:33:06] Ephesians 4:1 says, "I therefore are the
[1:33:08] prisoner of the Lord beseech you that
[1:33:09] you walk worthy of vocation where with
[1:33:11] your called with all loneliness and
[1:33:14] meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing
[1:33:16] one another in love, endeavoring to keep
[1:33:18] the unity of the spirit in the bond of
[1:33:20] peace.
[1:33:22] What a responsibility. While we're
[1:33:24] building, now notice, it's not your
[1:33:27] brother. It's not your
[1:33:29] sister. It's the enemy that's stopping
[1:33:31] the building project.
[1:33:34] You got to recognize who your enemy is.
[1:33:36] It's not your family member. It's Satan
[1:33:39] that's trying to keep you down.
[1:33:42] It's the truth. So, what you have to do
[1:33:45] is if there's an issue, be gracious
[1:33:47] towards that person and let it go.
[1:33:52] just let it go and move on. You're
[1:33:54] building
[1:33:56] to me. Every time there's a problem that
[1:33:58] comes towards me, I look at it as an
[1:34:00] opportunity to get closer to God.
[1:34:02] Because to have a life without
[1:34:03] overcoming anything means you're not an
[1:34:05] overcomer.
[1:34:07] And everybody wants to go through the
[1:34:08] day without overcoming anything. But I'm
[1:34:11] saying get to the place where you're
[1:34:14] fearless. That nothing will stand before
[1:34:15] you. Like Joshua and Caleb were more
[1:34:17] than able to take the land. the
[1:34:19] capstone's coming and I'm gonna be just
[1:34:20] like Jesus. Brother Brandham says if
[1:34:22] there's only one in that city, you make
[1:34:24] sure you're that you're that one that's
[1:34:25] going. You just got to have that bulldog
[1:34:28] faith that you're going and that you're
[1:34:30] going to live the life that's going to
[1:34:32] prove
[1:34:35] it. Walk in wisdom towards them that
[1:34:37] without redeeming the time. Let your
[1:34:39] conversation be with grace. And he goes
[1:34:42] in verse four says there is there is one
[1:34:45] body, one spirit. Even as you're called
[1:34:47] in one hope, you're calling one Lord,
[1:34:48] one faith, one baptism, one God, Father
[1:34:50] all who's above all and through all and
[1:34:52] in you
[1:34:53] all. Speaking of a oneness now, which
[1:34:56] means as Christ forgave us to be one
[1:35:00] with us, we forgive one another to be
[1:35:03] one with
[1:35:05] them. But unto every one of us, verse
[1:35:08] seven, is given grace according to the
[1:35:13] measure of the gift of Christ.
[1:35:18] We're saved
[1:35:20] by
[1:35:22] grace, not of ourselves. It is the gift
[1:35:25] of God. In other words, he died
[1:35:29] providing us an opportunity to receive
[1:35:32] the gift of
[1:35:34] salvation. To every one of us is given
[1:35:37] the gift of grace, a measure of
[1:35:40] grace. It's there. You can become
[1:35:43] whatever you want to become. Whatever
[1:35:46] you got faith for, it is yours. Amen.
[1:35:52] But you have to receive that grace. You
[1:35:56] have to believe in that grace. And God
[1:35:59] is not somebody that says it don't
[1:36:01] matter what you do. You get Christmas
[1:36:03] presents no matter what birth. It just
[1:36:05] you act it doesn't matter. You can just
[1:36:07] have all the kingdom.
[1:36:09] No. His attitude is all that ever came
[1:36:11] before me. thief and robbers. I got that
[1:36:13] attitude everywhere. I'm looking for a
[1:36:15] bride who actually loves me.
[1:36:18] And if you love me, you'll keep my
[1:36:19] commandments.
[1:36:21] He's looking for that group of people.
[1:36:22] Says, "God, you want me to start being
[1:36:24] gracious towards others. I know this is
[1:36:26] kind of wasn't on my bucket list to do,
[1:36:28] but if this is what you're asking me to
[1:36:29] do, I'm going to go ahead and do this."
[1:36:36] God provides opportunity every day for
[1:36:38] us. I believe the the Holy Ghost is a
[1:36:41] teacher. He's leading us into to all
[1:36:43] truth
[1:36:45] and he wants us that our our our speech
[1:36:47] be always with
[1:36:50] grace. So brother, sister, if there's a
[1:36:54] a mountain in your
[1:36:56] life, believe that God is going to
[1:37:00] dissolve that. Amen.
[1:37:03] That you can continue working on the
[1:37:05] project.
[1:37:07] I'll say don't wait till one this, you
[1:37:10] know, well, you know, wait till this
[1:37:13] happens with my this person and then
[1:37:16] I'll start. Don't do that.
[1:37:19] I remember at the beginning of my walk
[1:37:21] with the Lord, I used to have these
[1:37:22] little things that I would think, well,
[1:37:24] when this gets taken care of, then I'll
[1:37:26] I'll I'll put my my whole every
[1:37:28] everything into Christ. And you know
[1:37:30] what? I'll tell you to this day, if that
[1:37:32] if I ever waited for that, I would have
[1:37:33] never moved anywhere.
[1:37:37] Look, we only got so much time to get
[1:37:39] ready. We only got so much time to get
[1:37:41] souls saved. We only got so much time to
[1:37:42] get our kids in. We only got so much
[1:37:44] time to to be the influence that we want
[1:37:46] to be. Only so much time to get the
[1:37:49] temple built. And you know what? This
[1:37:51] temple is not built without test and
[1:37:53] trials, right? Character is is built in
[1:37:57] the fiery furnace of trials. You know,
[1:37:59] you literally have to go through the
[1:38:01] trial and make the right decision in the
[1:38:03] trial. True.
[1:38:07] And a lot of times trials have to do
[1:38:09] with how how they either make you more
[1:38:11] bitter like Pharaoh or they'll make you
[1:38:12] more gracious like Moses.
[1:38:15] You it is your choice. It's I say it
[1:38:19] like this. God came up to Pharaoh and
[1:38:22] said, "Look at there's grace here. Just
[1:38:25] let my people go and everything's going
[1:38:26] to be okay."
[1:38:29] But he did not accept that gift of
[1:38:31] grace. And what happened? He got killed.
[1:38:36] So I'll say like this. There's grace
[1:38:37] here. There's
[1:38:40] grace. Let's stand together. God bless
[1:38:44] you. Is there anything too hard for the
[1:38:47] Lord? He will move the
[1:38:50] mountain. He's going to finish the
[1:38:52] temple.
[1:38:54] He's looking for us to be crying out
[1:38:57] constantly, grace. Grace, the grace of
[1:39:00] God in our life.
[1:39:03] He that begun a good work in us, he's
[1:39:05] going to finish it. I believe it with
[1:39:08] all my heart. Let's sing that that song.
[1:39:10] Marvelous
[1:39:11] grace of our loving
[1:39:19] Lord. Let's focus on his grace.
[1:39:23] Marvelous grace.
[1:39:30] grace that
[1:39:32] exceeds our sin and our guilt. Amen.
[1:39:42] How
[1:39:43] poured there where the blood of the lamb
[1:39:49] was filled.
[1:39:52] Grace.
[1:39:54] Grace.
[1:39:55] God's
[1:39:57] grace. Grace that will pardon and
[1:40:02] cleanse
[1:40:04] within.
[1:40:06] Grace. Grace.
[1:40:09] God's
[1:40:11] grace. Grace that is greater than all
[1:40:17] our sin.
[1:40:19] Sin and despair like the sea rays
[1:40:25] road threatening the soul with infinite
[1:40:31] loss.
[1:40:32] [Music]
[1:40:33] [Applause]
[1:40:33] [Music]
[1:40:35] Gater grace
[1:40:38] untold points to the refuge the
[1:40:43] mighty cross.
[1:40:47] Grace.
[1:40:48] Grace.
[1:40:50] God's
[1:40:52] grace. Grace that will pardon and
[1:40:56] cleanse
[1:40:58] within
[1:41:00] grace.
[1:41:02] Grace.
[1:41:03] God's
[1:41:05] grace. Grace that is greater than all
[1:41:10] our sin.
[1:41:13] Dark is the stain that we cannot
[1:41:18] hide. What can a veil to wash it
[1:41:25] away? Look, there is flowing a
[1:41:29] crimson
[1:41:31] tide wider than snow. Maybe two. How
[1:41:37] many's thankful for that today? Grace.
[1:41:41] grace.
[1:41:43] God's
[1:41:44] grace. Grace that will pardon and
[1:41:49] cleanse
[1:41:51] within
[1:41:53] grace.
[1:41:54] Praise.
[1:41:56] God's
[1:41:58] grace. Grace that is greater than all
[1:42:03] our sin.
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:06] Marvelous,
[1:42:08] infinite, matchless
[1:42:11] grace freely
[1:42:14] bestowed on all who
[1:42:18] believe. You that are longing to see his
[1:42:24] face. Will you this moment his grace
[1:42:31] receive
[1:42:32] grace?
[1:42:34] Praise
[1:42:36] God's
[1:42:42] grace
[1:42:44] within
[1:42:46] praise.
[1:42:47] Great.
[1:42:49] God's
[1:42:51] grace. Grace that is ger than all our
[1:42:57] sin. Hallelujah. Amen. Maybe you just
[1:43:00] continue to play that. Amen. Amen. Let's
[1:43:04] worship him. He's worthy of grace. He's
[1:43:07] worthy of our praise. He's He's worthy
[1:43:10] to be given back, to be expressed of
[1:43:12] everything that he's given to us.
[1:43:15] Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:43:19] Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:43:23] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:43:25] Thank you for your grace, Lord.
[1:43:32] Thank you
[1:43:34] Jesus.
[1:43:38] Hallelujah. Thank
[1:43:40] you. Thank you
[1:43:43] Jesus. Thank you.
[1:43:46] Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus.
[1:43:55] Amen. Amen. With every head bowed, every
[1:43:58] eye closed, I just wonder if there be
[1:44:00] anyone here
[1:44:06] today that knows I've never accepted the
[1:44:10] grace of God before in my life, but
[1:44:12] today I want to accept God's grace into
[1:44:15] my life. Be anybody here that's never
[1:44:18] ever received God's grace and wants
[1:44:21] to Amen. Amen. I wonder if there'd be
[1:44:25] anyone here
[1:44:27] today that can say, "I I know I need
[1:44:33] more of God's grace in my life. I want
[1:44:36] to be remembered in prayer today. I want
[1:44:38] to receive the grace of God." God bless
[1:44:41] these hands. God bless your precious
[1:44:43] soul, saints.
[1:44:45] Amen. Amen. Put down your hands. Amen. I
[1:44:49] wonder if there be anyone here today.
[1:44:52] every eye
[1:44:59] closed. Look, Jesus said, "Be be
[1:45:02] zealous, therefore, and repent."
[1:45:06] Maybe there'd be someone here
[1:45:08] today that know that God has given you
[1:45:12] grace, but you haven't been gracious
[1:45:15] towards
[1:45:17] somebody and you want to be able to give
[1:45:20] that grace out more freely. Say,
[1:45:22] "Brother John, would you remember me in
[1:45:24] prayer? I want to be able to to be I
[1:45:27] want to shout I want my life to shout
[1:45:29] out grace towards others." Amen. God
[1:45:32] bless all these hands. Oh my, how
[1:45:36] pleased God is. He wants to see grace
[1:45:39] manifested
[1:45:40] inside. Amen. Let's just believe with
[1:45:43] all of our heart because I believe God
[1:45:46] sees the sincerity of your heart,
[1:45:49] saints. And he's just he's wanting us to
[1:45:52] grow in grace. The Bible says, "Grow in
[1:45:54] grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ."
[1:45:57] Grow in it. Amen. Amen. As we just go
[1:46:01] ahead and we pray. our heavenly father.
[1:46:04] Lord, we want to thank you. Thank you
[1:46:06] for your amazing grace. Amen. Your
[1:46:09] marvelous grace. How sweet the sound
[1:46:13] that saved a wretch like me. Amen. Lord,
[1:46:17] we thank you for pulling us out of the
[1:46:19] gutter of this world.
[1:46:21] Lord, when we didn't even think about
[1:46:23] you, care about you. Lord, we're just
[1:46:26] trying to make our own way. And you you
[1:46:29] you sent a soldier by some from some
[1:46:34] place, somewhere to get to us the
[1:46:37] message of
[1:46:38] grace that
[1:46:40] Lord, you you died at Calvary. That you
[1:46:44] provided a way that our sins could be
[1:46:46] blotted out and that there could there
[1:46:49] could be nothing that would stand
[1:46:50] between me and you, us and you. And
[1:46:54] Lord, today we thank you for that grace
[1:46:56] that you have bestowed upon each and
[1:46:58] every one of us here, God, that we're
[1:47:01] partakers of your grace. Amen. And that
[1:47:04] grace has never left us, Lord. We're
[1:47:06] still saved today. We're still saved
[1:47:09] today. We're standing here by the grace
[1:47:11] of God. Oh, yes. But God, we know that
[1:47:15] through this message you've given us
[1:47:17] today that that Lord, that your your
[1:47:19] grace is sufficient to finish the
[1:47:22] temple.
[1:47:24] And Lord, we've come, we're coming to
[1:47:26] you in prayer and seeking, Lord, that we
[1:47:29] might not only re be a recipient to
[1:47:32] receive more of your grace, but that
[1:47:35] that grace would abide, that would
[1:47:38] remain inside of us, that we could now
[1:47:40] distribute it out to others. You saw the
[1:47:43] hands that want to be the manifestation
[1:47:46] of this grace towards others. You see
[1:47:48] this in their life, all the
[1:47:50] opportunities. I pray that the love of
[1:47:53] God would be so shed abroad in their
[1:47:55] heart that it would not be hard for any
[1:47:58] of us here as your bride to be gracious
[1:48:01] towards one another. not to speak ill or
[1:48:04] or or or or discontent or murmuring or
[1:48:07] complaining or judging, but Lord, that
[1:48:09] we could just be as your bride to to to
[1:48:11] to be the uh uh blameless, as your word
[1:48:16] says, a a bride, the spotless uh in in
[1:48:20] the midst of a crooked and perverse
[1:48:21] nation. Oh, grant it, Lord. Grant it,
[1:48:24] Lord. We receive your word this morning
[1:48:27] into our hearts. We receive the
[1:48:28] engrafted word. We receive your grace.
[1:48:31] And Lord, with all faith, we believe,
[1:48:34] Lord, that every every layer that's put
[1:48:37] to this building and the capstone coming
[1:48:39] on, we know it's all by your grace. And
[1:48:41] we're we're taking your word. We're
[1:48:43] holding your word. We're believing your
[1:48:45] word. We're standing upon your word. And
[1:48:47] God, we're going to exercise your word
[1:48:49] every day of our lives. We're going to
[1:48:51] we're going to think on it. We're going
[1:48:52] to we're going to meditate upon it day
[1:48:55] and night, Lord, until we begin to see
[1:48:58] more of you manifest. and we're going to
[1:49:01] share it with others. And we're going to
[1:49:02] come to church rejoicing and and
[1:49:05] shouting with grace, grace, grace. Oh
[1:49:09] God, we're expecting perfect love. We're
[1:49:11] expecting all of you inside of us. And
[1:49:13] God, we just want to thank you this
[1:49:15] morning for your amazing grace that has
[1:49:18] allowed all this and is going to allow
[1:49:20] all this to happen. Thank you, Lord,
[1:49:22] that we could be right in the middle of
[1:49:25] this building project going on. And
[1:49:27] Lord, if there's been anyone here,
[1:49:29] anyone under the sound of my voice,
[1:49:31] anyone live streaming, anyone in the
[1:49:34] archives, anyone in this building, Lord,
[1:49:36] if there's anyone that has kind of
[1:49:37] halted on their building today, I pray
[1:49:40] God that they would hear the voice of
[1:49:42] God, speak to them to to to to get back
[1:49:45] and start start building the temple that
[1:49:48] you could come and and that may the
[1:49:50] fullness of the Holy Ghost could come
[1:49:52] and live inside of them. Grant it, Lord.
[1:49:55] We thank you for this today and we give
[1:49:57] you all the praise and honor for it. For
[1:49:59] we ask these things in Jesus Christ's
[1:50:02] holy name. Amen.
