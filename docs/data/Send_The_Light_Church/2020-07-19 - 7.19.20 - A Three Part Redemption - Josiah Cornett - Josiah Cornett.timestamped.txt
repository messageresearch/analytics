[25:01] i'm thankful for the rest that we have
[25:04] in god
[25:06] things are are are bad out there in the
[25:10] world as we know
[25:11] but the news is things are going to get
[25:14] a lot worse
[25:17] like it or not how do i know that do you
[25:20] get a connection with
[25:22] fox news or cnn yeah well this book here
[25:25] tells us
[25:27] it tells us and we need to enter into
[25:30] that rest
[25:31] abide in that rest it's the only safe
[25:34] place for us
[25:37] well um we're thankful for
[25:40] the dedication that we're going to have
[25:42] this morning
[25:44] and last night i just kind of leaned
[25:47] over
[25:48] towards cheryl and i i said can you
[25:52] please sing get ready to practice uh
[25:54] bring them in because brother branham
[25:57] always saying that before bible or baby
[25:59] dedication
[26:01] and she said we're already singing that
[26:04] and then i knew right then the lord was
[26:06] in this
[26:08] amen because we we don't uh
[26:12] sing it very very very much but uh i
[26:15] don't believe that was a coincidence
[26:17] amen
[26:18] well it's been a while since we had a
[26:19] baby dedication and i just wanted to
[26:21] read some
[26:22] some scriptures because there are many
[26:23] churches out there they believe in
[26:25] either
[26:26] uh of infant baptism or
[26:29] or sprinkling and um
[26:33] through the scriptures you can never
[26:35] find what that's ever practice it was
[26:37] something that was
[26:40] started by the catholic church and
[26:42] actually
[26:45] went on into a lot of the protestant
[26:47] churches
[26:48] but scripturally we can't find it but we
[26:51] want to follow
[26:52] the scriptures as close as possible
[26:55] amen and this is what jesus did we can
[26:57] find it in mark
[26:59] uh chapter 10 i don't know if we could
[27:02] get that up on the screen
[27:03] verse number 13.
[27:07] amen you know what lightning represents
[27:08] right
[27:10] the voice of god that's right
[27:16] amen mark chapter 10 verse number 13 and
[27:19] they brought
[27:20] young children to him
[27:24] that he should touch them and his
[27:27] disciples
[27:28] rebuked those parents that brought them
[27:34] and when jesus saw it he was much
[27:37] displeased
[27:39] you know the disciples don't always got
[27:41] it right
[27:46] and said unto the disciples
[27:49] suffer the little children to come unto
[27:51] me
[27:52] and forbid them not for of such
[27:57] is the kingdom of god
[28:00] verily verily i say unto you
[28:03] whosoever shall receive the kingdom of
[28:05] god
[28:06] as a little child he shall not enter
[28:09] therein
[28:10] and he took them up in his arms
[28:14] and put his hands upon them and he
[28:17] blessed them
[28:20] and that's what we want to do today
[28:24] and
[28:28] i think the greatest thing that we could
[28:30] say to one another is god bless you
[28:33] the greatest thing that we could desire
[28:36] that god would do for any one of us is
[28:39] that god would bless
[28:41] them amen and i don't know any greater
[28:45] thing to do
[28:45] with a a baby a child
[28:49] and to dedicate them to the lord and ask
[28:51] god to bless them
[28:52] just in the simplicity of the gospel i
[28:55] believe in
[28:56] in god doing everything doing the
[28:58] protection
[29:00] and and and meeting the needs amen
[29:03] amen we're going to ask brother tyler
[29:05] and sister
[29:07] brooke to come forward with little
[29:11] blair emerson this morning
[29:15] amen we're we're thankful for the work
[29:19] that god is doing in these two parents

[29:49] hearts

[30:05] yes lord jesus we don't believe in
[30:08] some sort of accident that took place

[37:08] uh i've been trying to uh come together
[37:11] here for a time of fellowship for a
[37:12] while it's
[37:13] uh it's so good to be able to come
[37:15] amongst
[37:16] believers and fellowship again we
[37:18] certainly felt um
[37:20] kind of taken advantage of by the devil
[37:22] and the schemes when we were
[37:23] shutting down churches for a little
[37:25] while there and and uh just trying to be
[37:27] as wise
[37:28] and cautious as we could given the
[37:30] uncertainty of the hour but it's it's
[37:31] good to be back together again
[37:34] brother john first reached out to me and
[37:36] you can have your seats for just a
[37:37] moment i want to
[37:38] greet you for a minute if i could when
[37:40] brother john first reached out to me
[37:42] uh he had asked if i could come up the
[37:44] fourth of july weekend and
[37:46] at the time we had just been planning
[37:48] our our first uh little get together
[37:50] at our home we had some members of our
[37:53] church out the whole youth group and
[37:55] some different ones and um ended up
[37:57] having another church
[37:58] sherwind and um we had another one of
[38:01] the other area churches
[38:03] joined with her youth group it was just
[38:05] a real real good time
[38:06] of fellowship that saturday july 4th and
[38:10] we certainly enjoy the fellowship of the
[38:12] saints but
[38:14] we had a lot of people that were
[38:16] explaining that they really felt like it
[38:18] was a real nice time just because
[38:20] uh with the tri-state youth services
[38:22] being cancelled and so on
[38:24] i know many of the members in the church
[38:26] here joined for that
[38:27] and um we got that comment so much i
[38:29] went back to brother paul i said brother
[38:31] paul people are missing out on tri-state
[38:32] youth service we've got to
[38:34] do something so this coming august
[38:37] 14th and 15th we'll be having another
[38:39] event we want to share that with you i
[38:41] think your pastor will send out the
[38:42] details i shared with him
[38:44] but we'll be having a brothers and
[38:46] fathers fathers and sons
[38:49] camp out and then friday night and then
[38:52] followed
[38:53] on on the grounds at our family property
[38:56] we'll have a youth service
[38:58] an outdoor event trying to keep in mind
[39:01] everyone's concerns for
[39:02] the current situation and um so if
[39:05] that's something that any of the youth
[39:06] here would be interested in
[39:08] or if any of the fathers would be
[39:09] interested in bringing their sons i
[39:10] would certainly
[39:11] ask you to get up with a john there for
[39:13] the information we shared and
[39:15] we got a whole itinerary listed up and
[39:17] uh we would love to see some
[39:19] some some of the members out here and
[39:21] have some more fellowship
[39:23] but today we're looking forward to just
[39:25] the fellowship of the work
[39:27] and uh i'm so happy to be able to to
[39:30] fellowship with you let's go before the
[39:31] lord
[39:33] dear precious heavenly father lord i'm
[39:36] just so
[39:36] thankful that we were able to find a
[39:39] time to
[39:40] to come and break the bread of life
[39:42] together with this precious group lord
[39:45] lord i i think about how i love
[39:48] preaching to them the lord and
[39:51] well i couldn't say that i've got a
[39:52] favorite group to preach to but they're
[39:54] certainly my favorite kind of group lord
[39:56] a group of people that love your word
[39:59] lord
[40:00] lord a group of people that believe your
[40:03] word
[40:04] father worship and spirit and truth and
[40:07] where the spirit of the lord is there's
[40:09] liberty
[40:10] lord and every time i come to preach
[40:11] here lord i feel liberty to preach
[40:14] liberty and the people to worship and to
[40:16] receive
[40:17] father well we just pray that would be
[40:19] another time of
[40:20] of being at liberty in your spirit this
[40:23] morning
[40:25] lord and it's it's not the words of a
[40:27] man that set people up free
[40:29] but it's it's the blood of jesus christ
[40:32] and the spirit of the lord that gives
[40:34] liberty to the individuals so lord as we
[40:37] open up your
[40:38] word we pray that your spirit would come
[40:40] behind it lord
[40:42] and vindicate it to the people by the
[40:43] moving of your spirit
[40:45] grant dear lord jesus we commit this
[40:47] service to you lord
[40:48] may you receive us in your arms and and
[40:51] draw us up into your presence lord as
[40:54] john said i was in the spirit of the
[40:55] lord oh father may we find ourselves
[40:58] there on the lord's day today
[41:00] in jesus christ's name we committed to
[41:02] you amen
[41:04] if you would stand with me well turn to
[41:06] the word
[41:12] think about independence day and i'm
[41:14] just so glad that we have
[41:15] the the independence to be able to turn
[41:17] our english
[41:19] is over that have been been fought for
[41:21] and
[41:22] blood has been shed to bring this bible
[41:24] to us to the ages and
[41:25] preserved by the spirit of the lord i'm
[41:27] so glad that we have the
[41:29] the the ability to turn there this
[41:31] morning let's
[41:32] let's turn to hebrews chapter six we're
[41:35] going to start at verse one
[41:37] and you all say amen when you get it the
[41:39] preacher always beats there
[41:41] because i'm cheating with my bookmarks
[41:43] but you just let me know when we get
[41:45] there
[41:46] and i believe we're going to have a good
[41:47] time in in the word this morning
[41:50] that's at least that's what i come from
[41:51] for is that is that what you came for
[41:54] i i always like to leave church service
[41:56] feeling a little bit better than when i
[41:57] left
[41:58] and if i don't feel that then maybe i i
[42:01] didn't get what i came for
[42:03] but i i come from more of the lord is
[42:05] that what you're here for for this
[42:06] morning
[42:07] i believe we'll find that in his word
[42:09] this morning let's read it together then
[42:11] now you have it
[42:12] amen amen chapter 6 and verse 1
[42:15] paul writing here he says therefore
[42:17] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[42:20] of christ
[42:21] let us go on unto perfection
[42:24] not laying again the foundation of
[42:26] repentance from dead works and of faith
[42:28] toward god
[42:29] of the doctrine of baptisms and of the
[42:31] laying on of hands
[42:33] and of the resurrection of the dead and
[42:34] of the eternal judgment
[42:37] and this we will do if god permit may
[42:40] the lord bless his word as you're seated
[42:43] love how paul lays this out here he says
[42:47] you know let's go on unto perfection he
[42:50] says let's let's not
[42:52] lay again the foundation of of all these
[42:55] other things that we already believe in
[42:56] we
[42:57] we know that we believe in the
[42:58] repentance from dead works we know
[43:00] that we believe in the resurrection from
[43:02] the dead we know that there's going to
[43:04] be a body change we know
[43:06] all this he says that's just
[43:08] foundational but praise god
[43:10] we've got a call from god to keep on
[43:13] going
[43:14] but there's there's a road ahead of us
[43:16] that we can keep
[43:17] journeying down i love the christian
[43:19] life because it never gets boring
[43:22] there never comes a place where you can
[43:24] say i've arrived i'm all settled
[43:26] i'm just i'm just going to wait for the
[43:27] coming of the lord he says no we we we
[43:30] believe in the doctrine
[43:31] of baptisms we believe in the baptism of
[43:34] jesus christ
[43:35] we'll do that and i believe that if
[43:36] anyone hasn't been baptized in the name
[43:38] of the lord jesus christ
[43:40] for the remission of sins and for
[43:42] repenting
[43:43] i believe we should do that but we're
[43:45] not going to lay again that foundation
[43:46] in your life if you can say
[43:48] i've done that you put it behind you you
[43:50] don't need to go back to it you don't
[43:51] need to
[43:52] get baptized the second third or fourth
[43:54] time it's done it's over with
[43:57] when you come up and you you ask the
[43:58] preacher to lay hands on you
[44:00] you go back believing that god's
[44:03] finished his work
[44:04] we don't need to come back a second
[44:06] third and fourth time brother brandon
[44:07] taught us that just weakens faith
[44:09] let's not lay again the foundation but
[44:12] let's go and move on towards
[44:14] perfection and that's what i'd like to
[44:16] preach on this morning by the grace of
[44:18] god if we can preach on a three-part
[44:20] redemption
[44:22] a three-part redemption now we know when
[44:25] we approach the the salvation of our
[44:28] souls
[44:29] that sealing of the holy ghost there's
[44:31] there's a three-part process to that
[44:33] it's justification sanctification and
[44:36] baptism of the holy ghost
[44:38] justification recognizing that jesus
[44:41] christ
[44:42] shed his blood for us that the price has
[44:44] already been paid at calvary
[44:46] submitting ourselves to god cleaning out
[44:48] our lives and being sanctified
[44:50] made a as it were the vessel that was
[44:53] dishonorable because it was
[44:54] cast down in the dirt but that vessel
[44:57] itself was
[44:58] what was not uh uh without use
[45:01] god recognized that that you were useful
[45:04] to him that you were
[45:05] that you were worthy to him if he would
[45:07] just clean you up and
[45:09] that's what sanctification is it's
[45:10] picking up the vessel from the ground
[45:12] and scrubbing it out
[45:13] readying it to be filled with the holy
[45:15] ghost
[45:16] so we see that god's process works in
[45:19] threes
[45:21] for the just even the filling of the
[45:23] holy ghost justification
[45:25] sanctification and then baptism
[45:29] and but we we have to consider that what
[45:32] happens after that right i believe
[45:35] there's there's many saints here that
[45:36] could say that
[45:37] i i received the holy ghost you know
[45:39] five years ago
[45:40] 10 years ago last year maybe but but
[45:43] what happens
[45:44] after that amen paul says in ephesians 1
[45:48] 14 that the holy ghost is the earnest or
[45:51] the down payment
[45:53] of our inheritance until the redemption
[45:55] of the purchased possession
[45:58] so now the holy ghost is just a down
[46:01] payment of what we're waiting for
[46:03] and then there's going to be a day of
[46:05] redemption and ephesians 4 30 it says
[46:07] grieve not the holy spirit
[46:09] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[46:12] redemption
[46:14] and that's that's the the day of
[46:16] redemption of what these these mortal
[46:17] bodies
[46:18] change back to the immortal bodies that
[46:20] we were
[46:21] having from the beginning the atom fell
[46:24] from amen
[46:26] so first we start with
[46:29] having our souls redeemed
[46:32] and then we have our bodies redeemed at
[46:34] the end as a complete work
[46:37] but what happens in the middle
[46:42] what kind of redemption is god is god
[46:45] still doing
[46:46] a redemptive work in our lives and
[46:49] that's what i want to broach this
[46:51] morning
[46:52] and to answer that question we have to
[46:55] consider what are we being
[46:56] redeemed to because remember
[47:00] the word redemption it means not just
[47:03] not just transformed from from a low
[47:06] estate to a higher state
[47:07] it means brought back to
[47:11] that's that whole re part of the word
[47:13] redemption
[47:15] that god from the foundational world saw
[47:18] us as we were in his mind
[47:21] but then there was a fall back in in the
[47:24] garden of eden that man
[47:25] fell from his original state and now god
[47:28] is bringing us
[47:29] back is that just a redeemed soul is
[47:32] that just bringing back a glorified body
[47:34] no because we go back in the original
[47:36] scripture we find out
[47:38] that man was made in the image and
[47:40] likeness of god
[47:42] in other words man had eternal life but
[47:45] it wasn't just that there was no death
[47:47] in man
[47:48] because there was no death in all the
[47:50] garden of eden
[47:51] but man was made in his image he was
[47:54] fashioned after his likeness after his
[47:57] character if you will so when man
[48:00] fell from the garden and we told that
[48:02] original lie
[48:04] he fell not only from his body his
[48:07] glorified body
[48:08] and transformed into a carnal body but
[48:11] he was fallen from his
[48:12] estate of character and that character
[48:15] was perfectly displayed in christ jesus
[48:18] the perfect man amen did you ever stop
[48:21] and consider that
[48:23] that when man fell wasn't just the the
[48:26] serpent that got a body change
[48:29] you know we know the serpent got a body
[48:31] change because his judgment was that
[48:33] that he he would be on his belly all of
[48:36] his days
[48:37] and people draw things about the serpent
[48:40] like he was some slithering creature in
[48:41] the garden
[48:42] well then it wouldn't have been a curse
[48:43] to tell him he's going to be on his
[48:45] belly all his days
[48:47] but then man's man didn't had a body
[48:50] change also
[48:51] he went from a glorified body that
[48:53] didn't taste sin
[48:54] to a body that the woman had pain and
[48:57] labor
[48:58] the the man had to work now by the sweat
[49:00] of his brow
[49:01] his days were numbered oh i'm so glad
[49:05] that we can say that one day i'm going
[49:06] back to where i don't have to work by
[49:08] the sweat of my brow
[49:10] one day i'm going back to where i don't
[49:11] have to see my my wife in the pain of
[49:13] labor anymore
[49:15] fear for lives and fear for the safety
[49:17] of my family
[49:19] i i won't have to worry about our lives
[49:22] ending
[49:22] i won't have to worry about a virus
[49:24] making us sick anymore
[49:26] i don't have to worry about government
[49:28] control because i'm going to a land
[49:30] that's controlled
[49:31] by a perfect governing supreme being
[49:34] oh there's no corruption there's no
[49:36] there's no there's there's not going to
[49:38] be any questions that i have to second
[49:40] guess
[49:40] you know even even questions that even
[49:43] even or
[49:44] decisions that i have to second-guess
[49:46] and even decisions that are made
[49:47] perfectly
[49:48] i still have to second-guess them now
[49:50] because i don't know the motive is
[49:51] behind them
[49:52] even if they're correct decisions but
[49:54] i'm looking forward to being
[49:56] at one man with the one who runs the
[49:59] government
[50:00] of heaven amen oh that's what we're
[50:02] going back to friends
[50:04] so we see that that the god has a plan
[50:07] to redeem
[50:08] man back to his fallen state but it's
[50:11] not just just to redeem man back to
[50:14] eternal life but redeem mac
[50:17] man back to the character
[50:20] the image and likeness of god
[50:23] that we receive the holy ghost first but
[50:26] it's not then i'm just waiting now for a
[50:28] body change
[50:30] there's this if i can call it if i can
[50:32] take the liberty to call
[50:33] almost a middle stage of redemption
[50:36] that's now determined by how much you
[50:38] yield your spirit man to and what you
[50:41] yield your spirit to
[50:43] what you yield your reasoning to what
[50:46] you re
[50:46] yield your affections to what you
[50:50] yield your imaginations to are you
[50:52] yielding your imaginations to the word
[50:54] of god that says
[50:56] what if i follow this word what if i
[50:59] just step out on faith and
[51:01] lay hands on the sick and pray for them
[51:03] and take god at his word
[51:05] let's see what would happen or is it all
[51:08] caught up with
[51:09] what if i decorated my house this way
[51:11] and what if i tried to achieve this over
[51:13] here with my job and
[51:14] what if i tried to to do this home
[51:16] improvement project
[51:18] what are we yielding our spirits to that
[51:21] will end
[51:22] up defining what our characters become
[51:26] oh my so now there's this middle stage
[51:30] of redemption
[51:31] and brother uh paul the apostle talks
[51:35] about
[51:36] when he says grieve not the holy spirit
[51:37] of god
[51:39] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[51:41] redemption
[51:42] so we know here that he's talking to
[51:44] holy ghost-filled believers
[51:46] he's talking to those that have been
[51:49] sealed
[51:50] he says but let all bitterness and
[51:53] wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[51:56] speaking be put away from among you with
[51:59] all malice
[52:01] do you mean to tell me that a holy
[52:04] ghost-filled
[52:05] christian could have wrath could be
[52:08] filled with bitterness could have anger
[52:12] seething within their spirit realm
[52:15] malice
[52:16] and an evil speaking and gossiping
[52:19] that doesn't sound like your
[52:21] prototypical holy ghost-filled believer
[52:24] that doesn't mean my stereotype but paul
[52:27] says
[52:28] it's possible because you can still you
[52:31] can come to the process of justification
[52:33] and sanctification
[52:34] and yield your soul to believing on the
[52:36] filling of the holy ghost
[52:37] and yet you can stagnate right there as
[52:40] a believer
[52:41] and if you're not careful if you don't
[52:43] keep on going down this road of
[52:45] redemption
[52:46] that calls us all the way back to eden
[52:48] that calls us back to a glorified body
[52:51] back to the garden of eden back to our
[52:54] original state
[52:55] oh my if you don't yield to that
[52:59] guidance
[53:00] you can stagnate and take on bitterness
[53:03] and wrath
[53:04] and disappointments of life can get you
[53:06] down and so he admonishes them be
[53:09] kind to one another tenderhearted
[53:13] think about the other have grace for the
[53:15] other give them the benefit of the doubt
[53:17] they they said something wrong and maybe
[53:19] out of maybe that was out of context
[53:21] maybe they didn't mean it that way
[53:23] maybe they they didn't realize people
[53:25] were taking it that way
[53:27] maybe they just need to grow up a little
[53:29] bit and that's okay
[53:32] giving grace towards one another amen oh
[53:35] i think there's a lot more grace that we
[53:36] could have amongst the children of god
[53:39] considering how much grace has been shed
[53:41] abroad in our hearts
[53:42] by the spirit of jesus christ i believe
[53:44] we can exercise grace towards one
[53:46] another
[53:47] forgiving one another even as god for
[53:49] christ's sake
[53:51] have forgiven you so we see that this
[53:54] spirit man has to be
[53:56] cultivated after receiving the holy
[53:59] ghost
[54:00] there's more work to do but brandon says
[54:03] it this way
[54:04] admonishing the people he says oh no we
[54:07] are going to take something with us
[54:08] friends speaking about when we die
[54:12] he says and what that something is
[54:15] is all we can take with us
[54:18] nothing less and nothing more if you've
[54:22] got nothing less
[54:23] nothing more you want to make sure that
[54:24] what you're taking with you
[54:26] is going to hold fast in the end he says
[54:30] we better be real careful now to see
[54:32] that we take something
[54:33] that will make us right before god
[54:37] so what's that we will take our
[54:39] character brother
[54:40] that is what we will take with us and
[54:43] what kind of character will take you
[54:45] will be like his whose character was
[54:48] molded and by force by suffering in the
[54:51] fiery furnace of affliction
[54:52] amen or it would be the softness of this
[54:55] characteristic in people
[54:57] it is up to each one of us for every man
[55:00] in that day to bear his burden
[55:04] think about that what does that mean
[55:06] that day to bear his burden
[55:08] paul talks about he says we must all
[55:11] appear before the judgment seat of
[55:13] christ
[55:14] that everyone may receive the things
[55:16] done in his body
[55:18] according as he hath done whether it be
[55:21] good
[55:21] or bad you say wait a second brother i i
[55:25] thought
[55:25] i thought that the just shall live by
[55:27] faith and that the righteous are passed
[55:28] from
[55:29] from death and to life we shall not see
[55:31] the judgment
[55:32] we won't see the judgment between death
[55:35] and life
[55:36] we won't see the white throne judgment
[55:39] but remember
[55:40] even this the servants that the master
[55:42] gave the talents to
[55:43] they had a judgment what they did with
[55:45] their talents
[55:47] whether it be good or whether it be bad
[55:50] so paul says
[55:51] no matter who you are speaking to
[55:53] believers he says
[55:54] we must all appear before the judgment
[55:56] seat of christ
[55:58] all my friends when i think about it it
[56:01] fills me
[56:02] with godly fear to stand before the holy
[56:06] one
[56:07] to stand before the sinless one the
[56:09] spotless one
[56:10] and give a counter for what i did in
[56:12] this life
[56:13] i won't give an account of the things
[56:16] that
[56:16] i did that have been forgiven but i i
[56:19] think that i'll get be giving an
[56:21] account for the things that i did not do
[56:24] and
[56:25] and and and and the opportunities i
[56:26] didn't take
[56:28] right you know that's why people say i
[56:30] i'll just i'll just make it right at the
[56:32] end
[56:33] everything that i did wrong i'll just
[56:34] come up to my death bed
[56:36] and i i'll make everything right then
[56:39] and i'll have eternal life
[56:41] first of all you don't know you're not
[56:43] guaranteed a deathbed
[56:45] sometimes some people have a death car
[56:47] or a death accident
[56:49] you don't know that you're taking a
[56:50] gamble with your soul hanging overhead
[56:52] over over the flames of hell by a string
[56:56] i wouldn't do that amen but even if you
[56:59] could
[57:01] i do believe in deathbed confessions but
[57:04] can you imagine
[57:05] putting off the opportunity of a life
[57:07] with christ
[57:08] until the very end securing eternal life
[57:12] and then coming before the judgment seat
[57:13] of christ and giving an account for why
[57:16] you
[57:17] dismissed the opportunity here and here
[57:20] and here and waited until your very end
[57:24] oh friends i wouldn't want to do that
[57:27] i wouldn't want to stand before the
[57:29] supreme and awesome ruler
[57:31] the holy god of heaven that my my human
[57:34] friend can't even
[57:35] tolerate to be in the presence of
[57:39] i have to give an account of that the
[57:42] one who
[57:42] died that i could have life abundantly
[57:45] and say i rejected life until the end
[57:48] i wouldn't want to do that but what
[57:51] about
[57:53] us today we've accepted the lord jesus
[57:56] christ
[57:58] but what have you done with him since
[58:00] then
[58:02] amen even since you received the holy
[58:04] ghost what have you done with that token
[58:06] since them have you buried the token the
[58:09] gift of the holy ghost in the ground
[58:11] until the lord comes and calls you by
[58:13] name or are you taking that
[58:15] and allowing god to further mold into
[58:18] you his image and his character
[58:23] i'm not the only one that worried about
[58:24] this you're looking
[58:26] even the message in the the prophet
[58:28] which was uh
[58:30] christ in him was waving himself before
[58:33] the people in this man
[58:35] and here he says i know that someday
[58:37] i've got to die
[58:38] and i hope that god never let satan
[58:41] crown me as an
[58:42] old crabbed indifferent man
[58:46] how many old crab man have you seen your
[58:48] life
[58:50] old crabbed woman seems like their their
[58:52] face
[58:53] is just they've got more frown wrinkles
[58:55] than smile wrinkles
[58:59] he says my wife an old nagging woman are
[59:01] your wife
[59:02] or you that way i pray brother that our
[59:04] lives will be crowned with the fruits of
[59:06] the spirit
[59:08] and i know as we get older each one of
[59:10] us we're going to get something
[59:12] happen and something happen and i know
[59:15] those little things are just going to
[59:16] keep on accumulating
[59:17] as you get older and they just got to
[59:20] how many of you older ones can say i've
[59:21] got a lot of water in the bridge
[59:23] i i've seen a lot of things brother
[59:25] josiah you're just a spring chick
[59:27] compared to what i've seen
[59:30] hey i i get it i in my 33 years i look
[59:33] back over my life and
[59:34] if i allowed it to get to me there's
[59:36] enough things that
[59:37] that i'd be wearing a frown today
[59:39] instead of a smile
[59:41] and if you get your eyes on those things
[59:43] the the church split ups and what people
[59:45] did to you and what people said to you
[59:47] and
[59:47] what they might have meant by this and
[59:49] the disappointments in life and how
[59:51] things didn't turn out the way you
[59:53] thought they would turn out
[59:54] and how life isn't as big of a bang as
[59:56] you thought it might be
[59:58] right that's good little things just
[1:00:01] keep accumulating
[1:00:02] if you put your eyes on that instead of
[1:00:06] looking into jesus the author and finish
[1:00:08] of our faith
[1:00:10] then your character is going to take on
[1:00:12] a character of bitterness and
[1:00:13] disappointment
[1:00:14] malice brother goes on he says i think
[1:00:18] one of the most horrible things is for
[1:00:20] satan to crown some person's life
[1:00:22] a crabbed old man or woman and i hope
[1:00:25] you don't get to that place
[1:00:27] you younger ones that are close to my
[1:00:29] age than than
[1:00:30] calling yourself an old man or a woman
[1:00:32] look at yourself today
[1:00:34] what road are you on based on your
[1:00:36] actions and
[1:00:37] your response to life pressures are
[1:00:41] are you going down the road to see
[1:00:42] yourself as a crab dull man or woman
[1:00:45] or are you responding in a way that each
[1:00:48] pressure makes you stronger
[1:00:50] each suffering makes you better each
[1:00:53] each tier
[1:00:54] makes you more pure before the lord as
[1:00:57] he as he works out the dross from your
[1:00:59] gold
[1:01:01] are you allowing the character of jesus
[1:01:04] christ to be mold in you
[1:01:06] or will you find yourself a crabbed old
[1:01:08] man or woman the latter end
[1:01:11] i hope that i can bear my burdens he
[1:01:13] says i want my life
[1:01:15] crowned with the glory of god his
[1:01:17] long-suffering
[1:01:18] peace meekness gentleness page patience
[1:01:23] oh that's what i want friends but what
[1:01:26] does it take it takes yielding our
[1:01:28] spirits to the right thing
[1:01:31] now even paul said this he said every
[1:01:34] man striveth for the mastery and he's
[1:01:37] he's temperate in all things now they do
[1:01:40] it to obtain a corruptable crown
[1:01:42] but we in uncorruptable i therefore so
[1:01:46] run
[1:01:47] keeping under my body and bringing it
[1:01:49] into subject
[1:01:50] subjection lest by any means when i
[1:01:53] preach to others
[1:01:54] i should become myself a castaway
[1:01:58] you know i always wondered about that
[1:01:59] scripture because here
[1:02:02] paul's talking about i'm afraid that if
[1:02:04] i do all this work for god
[1:02:07] i could still turn up the ladder and be
[1:02:09] a castaway it's true
[1:02:12] and i thought wait a second this is the
[1:02:14] same paul that preached the doctrine
[1:02:17] of being sealed by the holy ghost so
[1:02:19] castaway can't
[1:02:21] mean what i think castaway means because
[1:02:24] to me the word castaway just means i
[1:02:26] i cast it off and i'm no longer
[1:02:28] associated it means a piece of trash
[1:02:31] that that i could do all this and if i
[1:02:34] if i did something wrong
[1:02:35] at the end god just throws me off like a
[1:02:38] piece of trash
[1:02:39] and it seems then like my life would be
[1:02:41] just kind of held on by a string a
[1:02:44] string of my own actions
[1:02:47] i knew that wasn't right
[1:02:50] because god doesn't throws people off
[1:02:52] like a piece of trash he says
[1:02:54] i hold them in my hand and which no man
[1:02:56] can pluck them from
[1:02:58] if no man can pluck me from his hand
[1:03:00] then that means josiah
[1:03:02] kilnette cannot pluck me from his hand
[1:03:04] if no man can
[1:03:06] pluck his his chosen from his hand that
[1:03:09] means that john martin can't pluck john
[1:03:12] martin from his hand
[1:03:13] that means that when you're sealed into
[1:03:15] the holy ghost you're
[1:03:16] sealed into the holy ghost and there's
[1:03:18] no man
[1:03:19] there's no devil there's no spirit
[1:03:22] there's no lust demon
[1:03:23] that can change that seal and break you
[1:03:26] out from jesus christ
[1:03:27] amen but there is something that can
[1:03:30] still make you a cast away before god so
[1:03:32] how do you remedy this
[1:03:34] brother branham said it this way i think
[1:03:35] it's so beautiful i i don't like to take
[1:03:37] away from the prophet when he says it
[1:03:39] perfect
[1:03:40] he says if talking of adoption he says
[1:03:43] if that boy
[1:03:44] was born in a home as a son he did not
[1:03:46] become a right boy
[1:03:48] he would not follow his father's
[1:03:50] instructions if he would not be about
[1:03:52] his father's business
[1:03:54] that boy was always a son
[1:03:58] but he never got any inheritance
[1:04:03] he was just a castaway
[1:04:07] and when you get the holy ghost your
[1:04:09] god's son
[1:04:10] or god's daughter that's true enough
[1:04:13] but if you don't obey god and walk in
[1:04:16] the light
[1:04:17] and walk in the word and believe god
[1:04:20] then you won't have any inheritance
[1:04:24] where is that decided is that the side
[1:04:26] of the judgment seat of christ
[1:04:29] so we've got this beautiful space of
[1:04:32] time
[1:04:33] from the time that we receive the gift
[1:04:35] of the holy ghost answer god's call in
[1:04:37] our life
[1:04:38] now that opportunity to have god's life
[1:04:42] manifested after us paul says it this
[1:04:45] way
[1:04:46] we're changed as we look at christ from
[1:04:48] glory
[1:04:49] unto glory in eternity we're going to
[1:04:52] have all eternity to look at him
[1:04:54] but our character in this life gets
[1:04:56] molded now
[1:04:58] and so what you look at will change you
[1:05:00] from one glory
[1:05:01] into another or from one disgrace
[1:05:05] into another disgrace it's all in what
[1:05:08] you look at
[1:05:09] i remember hearing about brother branham
[1:05:11] saying he you know he was well traveled
[1:05:14] he went to these dark lands of africa
[1:05:16] and here there were
[1:05:17] worshipers of of the monkey and they
[1:05:19] they prostrated themselves before the
[1:05:21] monkeys so much
[1:05:22] until they started making monkey sounds
[1:05:24] and monkey noises and acting like a
[1:05:26] monkey
[1:05:26] what was it they prostrated themselves
[1:05:28] before something
[1:05:29] they looked at it so much they were
[1:05:31] changed from one disgrace
[1:05:33] into another disgrace instead of glory
[1:05:36] and the glory that they were called to
[1:05:38] amen i know as i look at
[1:05:41] you know as i look at diy projects my
[1:05:44] home can be transformed
[1:05:45] from one glory into another glory and as
[1:05:48] as as we look at decorating
[1:05:50] things uh our the decoration of our home
[1:05:52] can be transformed from one glory into
[1:05:54] another but
[1:05:55] in the meantime what am i being changed
[1:05:57] into
[1:05:58] where is my focus at what am i
[1:06:01] looking at and what am i being changed
[1:06:04] into
[1:06:06] oh my i love the gospel friends
[1:06:11] because on one hand there's the fear of
[1:06:14] god
[1:06:15] as you look towards the judgment seat of
[1:06:17] christ and on the other hand
[1:06:20] there's the blessings of god and both
[1:06:23] are certain
[1:06:25] you know even when god was talking to
[1:06:27] cain in genesis chapter 4 he says
[1:06:30] if you do good will you not be rewarded
[1:06:33] but if you do
[1:06:33] evil sin is long lurking at the door
[1:06:37] i love it the gods he he may have carry
[1:06:41] both
[1:06:42] a stick and a carrot but both the carrot
[1:06:44] and the stick are certain
[1:06:47] i love that because i i'm in the midst
[1:06:49] of child turning i see some of you are
[1:06:51] still in that that stage of life and
[1:06:53] something i see with my boys
[1:06:54] he needs consistency he needs certainty
[1:06:58] it establishes boundaries and it gives
[1:07:00] him it gives him
[1:07:02] a a certain amount of rest and security
[1:07:06] and i tell you what in in this world
[1:07:08] right now
[1:07:09] i need some certainty friends and if
[1:07:12] that certainly means you do this and you
[1:07:14] get punished but you do this and you get
[1:07:15] blessed i still thank the lord for it
[1:07:19] i i tell you god uses uncertainty
[1:07:22] to create character within his people
[1:07:25] i know that these times are in certain
[1:07:27] times we we have to
[1:07:29] we go over the border from one state to
[1:07:31] another and we don't
[1:07:32] know how we should act and we don't know
[1:07:34] how we should behave hard anymore
[1:07:35] i went over the border into ohio i'm
[1:07:37] like what are their local rules here we
[1:07:39] got to figure out
[1:07:40] how are people going to respond to us do
[1:07:41] we wear masks do we not wear a mask
[1:07:45] all these opinions from everybody and
[1:07:48] all the states are different and
[1:07:49] you don't know whether you just don't
[1:07:52] know
[1:07:53] yeah but that's life
[1:07:57] and large part life is uncertain but
[1:08:00] god uses that to mold character
[1:08:05] because he wants to see that in the time
[1:08:07] of uncertainty
[1:08:08] where will you place your faith
[1:08:12] oh hallelujah where will you place your
[1:08:15] faith in the time of uncertainty
[1:08:17] will you place your faith in your money
[1:08:19] and your assets and your
[1:08:20] your security plan or will you place
[1:08:23] your faith in jesus christ
[1:08:27] oh i'm so glad that there's there's some
[1:08:29] things that i can be sure about in life
[1:08:32] i i i'm not sure about a lot in this
[1:08:34] life but i'm sure about an
[1:08:35] awful lot in the life to come i've got
[1:08:38] an
[1:08:38] awful lot of promises waiting for me by
[1:08:41] one who's never broken a promise
[1:08:44] i i've got a promise of eternal life by
[1:08:46] one who
[1:08:47] who is the author of life i may not have
[1:08:50] a lot of assurances in this life but i
[1:08:52] know that i've got a couple of
[1:08:53] assurances
[1:08:54] it says that he said surely i'll not
[1:08:57] leave you nor forsake you
[1:09:00] and i can take that with me to the bank
[1:09:02] this morning amen and the time of unfor
[1:09:04] certainty
[1:09:05] i can put my faith in that word and say
[1:09:08] surely i'm holding the hand of jesus
[1:09:10] christ
[1:09:10] because he said he'll not leave me nor
[1:09:12] forsake me but he'll be with me
[1:09:15] and even in me until the end of the
[1:09:19] oh age i can say that i walk with christ
[1:09:22] i walk even as the ancients walked not
[1:09:25] because i'm not only walking with christ
[1:09:28] but i'm walking with him in me oh
[1:09:31] hallelujah say
[1:09:32] well brother josiah there's still a lot
[1:09:33] of things you don't know doesn't that
[1:09:35] make you nervous
[1:09:36] sometimes it does but i look back to
[1:09:38] god's promises
[1:09:40] i can tell you that i i i don't know
[1:09:43] whether i'll have a job next year
[1:09:45] i think it's pretty secure but i don't
[1:09:47] know right now
[1:09:49] it's an uncertainty you say brother
[1:09:51] josiah what
[1:09:52] would happen if you lost your job would
[1:09:54] you still feel that you
[1:09:56] that you've got something the hand of
[1:09:58] christ to hold on to would you feel
[1:09:59] certain in your life or would everything
[1:10:01] be spinning out of control
[1:10:03] i can say as david said surely goodness
[1:10:06] and mercy follows me all the days of my
[1:10:08] life
[1:10:10] and i'll dwell on the house the lord
[1:10:12] forever
[1:10:13] for the josiah you don't know if you'll
[1:10:14] be able to make your mortgage payment
[1:10:16] next month
[1:10:16] you just don't know with this economy if
[1:10:19] i lost my home and had the uncertainty
[1:10:21] of being displaced from a house and
[1:10:23] going from one place to another i can
[1:10:25] still say i've got the certainty of the
[1:10:27] hand of jesus christ
[1:10:28] brother josiah wouldn't you feel unsure
[1:10:31] of yourself i can say
[1:10:32] surely goodness and mercy follows me all
[1:10:34] the days of my life
[1:10:36] and i'll dwell in the house the lord
[1:10:38] forever brother josiah you don't know
[1:10:40] whether your children will serve the
[1:10:42] lord or not
[1:10:43] surely goodness and mercy follows me
[1:10:45] it'll fall after my children they may
[1:10:47] stray from the lord but i'll send
[1:10:49] prayers out after them
[1:10:50] because i'm a man of god i like job was
[1:10:53] a man of god
[1:10:54] i'll still pray after those children and
[1:10:56] claim the blood of jesus
[1:10:58] christ on them oh i think about the
[1:11:01] the the redemptive power of jesus christ
[1:11:03] that's calling us back from the fall
[1:11:06] [Music]
[1:11:08] if it can call back the sons and
[1:11:10] children of politicians
[1:11:12] and street vagabonds and prostitutes
[1:11:15] even if i make a mistake as a parent and
[1:11:17] they go astray
[1:11:19] i can say if the power of god is so
[1:11:21] strong to
[1:11:22] to redeem those that didn't have parents
[1:11:23] that showed them any model of
[1:11:25] christianity
[1:11:26] that i can say the power of god is
[1:11:28] strong enough to go after those that had
[1:11:29] something to look towards
[1:11:31] oh hallelujah god's
[1:11:35] power of redemption amen it's a certain
[1:11:38] power
[1:11:41] and we can say this morning that god is
[1:11:43] still calling us
[1:11:44] he doesn't call christians to just be a
[1:11:46] bump on a law
[1:11:48] he doesn't thank you brother he doesn't
[1:11:51] just call christians to
[1:11:52] receive the gift of the holy ghost and
[1:11:54] just wait for the rapture to come
[1:11:56] we've got something to do in this hour
[1:11:59] ask yourself what what is in my hand
[1:12:03] it's the good news the gospel of jesus
[1:12:05] christ you've still got a purpose you
[1:12:06] don't sit on a bump on a log somewhere
[1:12:09] what is in your hand let god use it
[1:12:11] yield that to the hand it might it might
[1:12:13] just be like an
[1:12:14] ox gold like shamgar had but get
[1:12:16] something in your hand and say oh god
[1:12:18] i'm gonna rely on your promises this
[1:12:20] morning
[1:12:22] oh hallelujah god's power
[1:12:25] redemption is at work
[1:12:29] he's redeeming us back to eden
[1:12:33] i want to say this god's power
[1:12:35] redemption
[1:12:36] is so powerful that it supersedes
[1:12:40] the power of the fall of your great
[1:12:43] great great great great
[1:12:44] granddaddy adam
[1:12:48] it's so powerful that no matter what
[1:12:50] adam did
[1:12:51] god's power of redemption brings you
[1:12:54] back to his character
[1:12:55] his image and his likeness if you'll
[1:12:58] only yield yourself to it
[1:13:01] you say you don't understand what i came
[1:13:04] from brother josiah
[1:13:05] you don't understand what i've done in
[1:13:07] life
[1:13:10] wait if god's power redemption is strong
[1:13:12] enough
[1:13:13] to supersede your great great great dan
[1:13:16] granddaddy adams
[1:13:17] fall so i think it's powerful enough to
[1:13:20] supersede your parents fall your
[1:13:23] grandparents fall
[1:13:24] the generational sin
[1:13:27] and so no matter what you came from and
[1:13:29] what character traits you and you
[1:13:32] you received and inherited from your
[1:13:34] family
[1:13:35] god's power of redemption this morning
[1:13:38] is powerful enough to pick you up from
[1:13:40] it and to complete
[1:13:43] a complete redemption a perfect
[1:13:46] redemption
[1:13:48] it's not just receive the holy ghost and
[1:13:52] bear with myself and try to live with
[1:13:54] myself
[1:13:55] i'm gonna get tired of living with
[1:13:56] yourselves
[1:13:58] just have to live with myself till jesus
[1:14:00] comes and makes me all better
[1:14:02] no he wants us to be changed now
[1:14:07] you might say you don't understand what
[1:14:09] what i've done in my life and
[1:14:11] i've just wrecked myself up my my body
[1:14:14] is riddled with drugs from the past or
[1:14:16] alcohol or
[1:14:17] my flesh just craves all these things
[1:14:20] because of
[1:14:20] what i've done the past and expose it to
[1:14:23] i want to encourage you this morning
[1:14:26] god's power of redemption is reaching
[1:14:28] out to you
[1:14:28] hallelujah and it's calling to you and
[1:14:31] it's not an
[1:14:32] unfamiliar voice that you have to give
[1:14:34] new heed to this morning
[1:14:36] it's the same voice that called you out
[1:14:38] of the world
[1:14:39] of the bondage of the world unto
[1:14:42] justification
[1:14:43] sanctification and filling with the holy
[1:14:45] ghost that same voice
[1:14:47] says take another step back to eating
[1:14:50] with me
[1:14:51] take another step you don't know how to
[1:14:54] properly love your children you you
[1:14:56] feel like you messed it up every time
[1:14:58] take another step
[1:15:00] let me show you what real love is maybe
[1:15:03] you never had an example as a child
[1:15:06] maybe you were beaten or abused in some
[1:15:08] way
[1:15:09] and your image of love your image of a
[1:15:11] father your image of a mother
[1:15:13] is now what it feels like crippling your
[1:15:15] ability to be effective today
[1:15:18] you don't have to wait for a body change
[1:15:21] to be healed of that
[1:15:22] amen god wants to redeem you
[1:15:25] in your spirit realm today and that's
[1:15:28] what he's inviting you to this morning
[1:15:30] he says take another step
[1:15:32] take another step back to eden with me
[1:15:35] that's what we're called to
[1:15:38] it doesn't matter what you fell from
[1:15:40] that's right
[1:15:42] it matters whose hand you have a hold of
[1:15:45] and that hand has the power to take you
[1:15:48] from showing you what real love is
[1:15:51] to showing you what real peace is you
[1:15:53] might say brother josiah i've never felt
[1:15:55] peace in my life
[1:15:56] my my very nature is anxious i'm always
[1:15:59] worrying
[1:16:00] i've got acid reflux condition because
[1:16:02] of it i've got this that or the other
[1:16:06] take another step amen you don't
[1:16:09] understand i i've been with
[1:16:10] the lord longer than what you've been
[1:16:12] born brother josiah
[1:16:16] take another step amen you might look
[1:16:19] behind you and say
[1:16:20] there's many steps behind me you
[1:16:22] probably some of you in this building
[1:16:23] this morning
[1:16:24] have more steps behind you than i do
[1:16:27] i have fewer steps ahead of you than
[1:16:29] what i've got behind me
[1:16:32] but yet there's more to come until the
[1:16:36] body change
[1:16:37] there's more to come and that's the
[1:16:40] blessedness the gospel of jesus christ
[1:16:42] this morning
[1:16:43] yes we'll be judged one day for what we
[1:16:46] don't do but
[1:16:48] i believe that if we yield ourselves
[1:16:50] this power that's
[1:16:51] been calling us all of our lives that
[1:16:53] will not be ashamed of the judgment
[1:16:56] that we'll hear those words well done
[1:16:58] thou good and faithful servant
[1:17:00] oh that's how what i'm living my whole
[1:17:02] life to hear brother
[1:17:04] just those few words well done thou good
[1:17:07] and faithful servant
[1:17:08] enter into the joys of thy reward you
[1:17:11] know what the joys of my reward is gonna
[1:17:13] be
[1:17:14] it's gonna be the presence of jesus
[1:17:16] christ all the days of my life
[1:17:19] and you know what the earnest the of the
[1:17:21] down payment the holy ghost does
[1:17:23] it brings the joys of my reward into
[1:17:26] this life
[1:17:27] that i can enjoy the presence of the
[1:17:29] holy ghost this morning
[1:17:31] i don't have to wait for it i'll have to
[1:17:34] become perfect for it
[1:17:35] i'll have to get my life just right to
[1:17:37] enjoy the presence of the lord
[1:17:39] he welcomes me as i am but offers me the
[1:17:43] power to change
[1:17:45] that's the god that we serve but this
[1:17:48] god does have a re a requisite
[1:17:52] requirement
[1:17:53] because he is a creator you want to know
[1:17:56] what the requisite requirement of god's
[1:17:58] transformative power in our lives are
[1:18:01] just look
[1:18:02] look to this world around you look to
[1:18:05] the the trees
[1:18:07] those trees just a few months ago were
[1:18:09] dry and barren
[1:18:12] they went through a cycle process you go
[1:18:14] back between before the fall
[1:18:16] they started to change their colors and
[1:18:18] lose their leaves as the
[1:18:20] as the temperature changes the
[1:18:22] atmosphere
[1:18:23] began to change i find the same thing
[1:18:26] when planning
[1:18:27] i have to find a certain kind of soil
[1:18:29] environment for a certain kind of plant
[1:18:31] might be
[1:18:32] alkali or basics it might be sandy soil
[1:18:35] or loamy soil
[1:18:37] i've got to have the right kind of
[1:18:38] environment for a plant to grow
[1:18:42] and that's what god requires in the
[1:18:44] christian life
[1:18:45] if you want to grow in christ you've got
[1:18:48] to have the right kind of requirement
[1:18:50] the right kind of atmosphere is required
[1:18:53] and it's not just
[1:18:54] church on sundays and church on
[1:18:56] wednesdays
[1:18:58] a little bit of fellowship by phone
[1:19:00] through the week
[1:19:02] but he says be holy as i am holy
[1:19:10] and that's what that's right brother
[1:19:11] that's what develops the character of
[1:19:13] christ
[1:19:15] is the atmosphere of holiness but did
[1:19:18] you know that holiness by itself
[1:19:20] is not a character trait that's true you
[1:19:23] know
[1:19:23] there's a lot of people that that
[1:19:25] they'll exercise the character trait of
[1:19:27] obedience
[1:19:29] that brings them into holiness they've
[1:19:32] cut off the dress
[1:19:33] the they haven't cut off the dress but
[1:19:34] they've they've cut off the dress the
[1:19:36] world
[1:19:37] the sisters have put on the dress the
[1:19:39] the modest garment the brother is no
[1:19:41] longer
[1:19:42] running around wearing the woman's
[1:19:44] clothing on their outside and whatnot
[1:19:47] clean ourselves up looks biffy we'll
[1:19:50] even cut out the movies and everything
[1:19:52] else
[1:19:54] and yet that by itself is not the
[1:19:56] character of jesus christ
[1:19:58] because you can still do that and still
[1:20:01] sit on a service
[1:20:03] with paul the apostle or josiah cornette
[1:20:06] and hear the words
[1:20:07] put aside all malice and bitterness and
[1:20:09] envyings and
[1:20:10] evil speakings and find yourself
[1:20:12] convicted so you have an atmosphere of
[1:20:14] holiness in your home
[1:20:16] because it's not just what you've done
[1:20:18] on the outside
[1:20:20] but what is your spirit man on the
[1:20:21] inside
[1:20:23] but god's process
[1:20:27] does require holiness did you know that
[1:20:30] the bible says that you'll not even see
[1:20:32] god
[1:20:33] without holiness i always thought that
[1:20:36] just meant you know without holiness i
[1:20:38] won't get into heaven
[1:20:39] but that actually applies today that you
[1:20:43] can't see god
[1:20:44] if your home is filled with video games
[1:20:47] that are
[1:20:48] are filled with violence if you're if
[1:20:50] your home is
[1:20:51] filled with shoot-'em-up games that
[1:20:53] turns your heart towards thinking about
[1:20:54] violence and
[1:20:55] and you pick out avatars that look like
[1:20:58] woman or you play with
[1:20:59] with with other men that are picking up
[1:21:01] avatars with with women that ought not
[1:21:03] to be dressed and they're so realistic
[1:21:04] i've seen it today brothers
[1:21:07] and they're so realistic it looks like
[1:21:09] you're watching almost a x-rated movie
[1:21:12] it's so dressed down or you you
[1:21:15] pull up your netflix and you say i'm not
[1:21:17] watching tv i'm not i'm watching netflix
[1:21:21] and you stream the things that you ought
[1:21:23] not to stream
[1:21:27] where is holiness in the home now
[1:21:31] i love the gospel because it really
[1:21:33] makes us live and
[1:21:35] address where the rubber meets the road
[1:21:36] friends
[1:21:38] it's not always in the principles of the
[1:21:40] doctrine of christ
[1:21:42] let's move on to perfection let's not
[1:21:45] lay again the old foundation that we
[1:21:47] know well enough about
[1:21:49] but let's look at our homes today
[1:21:52] and ask ourselves am i setting myself up
[1:21:55] for success
[1:21:56] am i setting myself up so that if time
[1:21:59] goes on
[1:22:01] my family will not be ashamed at the
[1:22:03] judgment
[1:22:04] i'll not be ashamed of the judgment i
[1:22:07] won't be a crabbed old man or old woman
[1:22:10] but i'm setting myself up to have
[1:22:12] holiness
[1:22:15] in music and dress and entertainment
[1:22:19] and what i have my eyes on
[1:22:22] holiness in my spirit realm what is that
[1:22:24] it's your reasoning
[1:22:26] what you justify what you find reasons
[1:22:29] to do
[1:22:30] your conscience your affections
[1:22:34] set your affections on things above for
[1:22:36] where your treasure where your heart is
[1:22:38] there's your
[1:22:39] treasure also
[1:22:42] where you place your treasure your
[1:22:43] hearts gonna follow friends
[1:22:48] and the holy heart that has the
[1:22:50] character of christ
[1:22:52] that's going to find their treasure in
[1:22:53] jesus christ
[1:23:00] do you feel the lord speaking to you
[1:23:02] this morning amen
[1:23:05] i've got a lot of notes left but i just
[1:23:06] want to slow down for a second
[1:23:10] and just ask you in this moment
[1:23:13] we know that there's a power
[1:23:16] that's calling us back to the garden of
[1:23:19] eden
[1:23:21] we're encouraged this morning knowing
[1:23:23] that it's a power that's willing to
[1:23:25] teach us how to love
[1:23:26] the right way that the outcome of our
[1:23:29] love would be the same
[1:23:30] outcome of the love of christ
[1:23:35] to have peace in the right way
[1:23:38] to have joy in the right way did you
[1:23:41] know that real godly joy will create joy
[1:23:43] around you
[1:23:45] it's not sarcastic joy that robs others
[1:23:47] of their joy
[1:23:49] in order for you to have joy you know
[1:23:52] that you've got the right kind of spirit
[1:23:54] of god
[1:23:55] love joy peace patience
[1:23:59] if it creates more around you instead of
[1:24:01] takes away from others to have it
[1:24:04] because when christ took the loaves and
[1:24:05] the bread he multiplied them
[1:24:09] the spirit of christ always multiplies
[1:24:11] amen
[1:24:12] you can look in the world around you see
[1:24:14] a lot of different people they they
[1:24:16] seem serene but their whole home is in
[1:24:18] chaos
[1:24:20] you say well they seem like a real
[1:24:21] peaceful person but it's not the right
[1:24:24] kind of peace
[1:24:25] because you can judge it by what its
[1:24:28] effects are
[1:24:32] so we were encouraged this morning to
[1:24:34] know that we've got a power that's
[1:24:35] willing to teach us and to grow us
[1:24:38] in the character of christ in peace
[1:24:41] and patience and goodness and kindness
[1:24:45] in temperance you know what temperance
[1:24:47] is it's not just the ability to hold
[1:24:48] your tongue
[1:24:49] when you feel like shouting
[1:24:53] temperance is the ability to restrain
[1:24:55] when given the opportunity to do evil
[1:25:00] when you feel so angry that whatever
[1:25:01] comes out of your mouth
[1:25:03] feels justified and you shut your mouth
[1:25:07] that's temperance
[1:25:09] but it's also temperance when someone's
[1:25:11] back has turned
[1:25:12] and you can do anything you wish but you
[1:25:14] restrain yourself from doing evil
[1:25:18] that's temperance that's the character
[1:25:20] of christ
[1:25:23] i think that any sane person would want
[1:25:25] these pure
[1:25:26] characteristics of christ in their life
[1:25:29] but we have to ask ourselves
[1:25:31] am i setting myself up for success
[1:25:36] am i doing what it takes to see this
[1:25:39] planting of the lord and he calls us his
[1:25:42] plantings
[1:25:42] amen to see it bloom with the blossom of
[1:25:46] jesus christ
[1:25:48] it requires an atmosphere of holiness
[1:25:50] and that it requires
[1:25:52] lots of sunlight what are you looking at
[1:25:58] you say i i want my word my works to be
[1:26:00] justified before christ
[1:26:02] in the end good works
[1:26:06] require two things good character paired
[1:26:09] with good leadership
[1:26:12] are you letting jesus christ lead you
[1:26:15] are you praying are you reading your
[1:26:17] bible
[1:26:19] or are we being drafted away to social
[1:26:21] media
[1:26:24] i'm guilty this morning friends it's
[1:26:26] it's a challenge of our age
[1:26:28] it's like it's a challenge that that no
[1:26:30] other age before us has
[1:26:32] has dealt with social media and
[1:26:35] entertainment
[1:26:36] and all these things what have you spent
[1:26:38] your extra time during the covid crisis
[1:26:43] when you were told to stay home and not
[1:26:45] go to work where did the extra time go
[1:26:51] has your home become more holy since
[1:26:54] covet
[1:26:55] or less holy
[1:26:59] have you walked further with christ
[1:27:02] or have you sat down when the whole
[1:27:06] world
[1:27:07] sat down and waited out coronavirus
[1:27:10] did you sit down and wait out the
[1:27:12] rapture amen
[1:27:14] or are you walking with jesus christ
[1:27:16] every day
[1:27:19] all my friends
[1:27:24] i love the gospel because it gives us a
[1:27:26] positive direction to go into amen
[1:27:29] if you do good will you not be rewarded
[1:27:33] there's a call this morning that says go
[1:27:36] back towards eden
[1:27:38] finish the redemption process with me
[1:27:42] jesus christ completed the redemption
[1:27:44] process of
[1:27:45] of filling you up with the holy ghost
[1:27:47] your soul just like that
[1:27:49] one day at an altar one day in the
[1:27:51] moment and twinkling of an eye
[1:27:53] that body change will happen just like
[1:27:55] that
[1:27:57] but this this middle stage of redemption
[1:28:00] if i can call it that
[1:28:01] this bringing us back to the character
[1:28:03] of jesus christ
[1:28:04] brother brahma said it's a victory not a
[1:28:07] gift
[1:28:08] there's the gift of the holy ghost
[1:28:11] but character is a victory and not a
[1:28:14] gift
[1:28:15] as a gospel minister i just came here
[1:28:17] this morning to encourage you
[1:28:19] to lay hold the victory to lay hold of
[1:28:22] god's victory for you
[1:28:24] he's given you the power he's given you
[1:28:26] the instruction he's he's promised that
[1:28:28] he'll never leave you nor forsake you
[1:28:30] that he'll guide you all the way back to
[1:28:32] eden
[1:28:34] imagine what it would be like to have
[1:28:35] perfect peace in our homes
[1:28:38] to to be able to love our children
[1:28:40] properly
[1:28:41] to show them a love that that would just
[1:28:43] overwhelm their defenses
[1:28:45] that would just overwhelm any demon be
[1:28:48] demonic power in their life
[1:28:51] remember the the maniac of gardera
[1:28:54] jesus christ was able to overwhelm
[1:28:57] those amen not just by the power of god
[1:29:00] alone
[1:29:01] but by who he was and we're given the
[1:29:05] same promise in mark chapter 16
[1:29:08] that we can chase out those demonic
[1:29:10] powers
[1:29:12] but it's not just having the character
[1:29:13] the the power of god
[1:29:15] we want to be the person of god is that
[1:29:18] your desire this morning friends
[1:29:20] to have the character of jesus christ be
[1:29:22] molded on us
[1:29:24] let's stand before him and go to the
[1:29:25] lord
[1:29:31] as we stand i just want to close with
[1:29:33] this last closing scripture
[1:29:36] paul speaking in philippians 3 he says
[1:29:39] not as though i had already attained
[1:29:42] either were already perfect but i follow
[1:29:46] after
[1:29:47] if that i may apprehend that which also
[1:29:49] i am apprehended of christ jesus
[1:29:51] brethren i
[1:29:52] count myself not to have apprehended i
[1:29:54] count myself not to achieve
[1:29:56] what i'm after yet even but this one
[1:29:59] thing i do
[1:30:00] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:30:03] can i encourage you this morning forget
[1:30:04] the past failures
[1:30:06] and the past successes don't rest upon
[1:30:10] those
[1:30:10] nor be haunted by them but do as paul
[1:30:14] said
[1:30:14] this one thing i do reaching forth
[1:30:17] unto those things that are before i
[1:30:20] press toward the mark of the high
[1:30:22] calling of god
[1:30:24] in christ jesus i hope i've painted the
[1:30:27] picture
[1:30:28] of something before you this morning
[1:30:30] that would encourage you to press on
[1:30:32] there's the image of jesus christ
[1:30:34] waiting
[1:30:35] just beyond an eden friends
[1:30:39] and there's no angel with a flaming
[1:30:41] sword guarding it any longer
[1:30:44] but there's a voice calling you from
[1:30:46] eden come home
[1:30:49] come home i wonder if you know that song
[1:30:52] come home i'd like to sing it with you
[1:30:55] i believe that's what the the spirit of
[1:30:58] the lord is
[1:30:59] is calling out this morning come home
[1:31:01] come home
[1:31:03] come home to christ's arms
[1:31:06] come home to eden as they load that song
[1:31:09] let's go before the lord
[1:31:12] dear lord jesus i just come before you
[1:31:15] lord
[1:31:17] thanking you lord for
[1:31:20] people that are on the pathway back
[1:31:23] towards eden lord
[1:31:25] a group of people that have been
[1:31:27] restored underneath the malachi
[1:31:29] 456 ministry back to the faith of the
[1:31:33] pentecostal fathers
[1:31:35] but we don't stop there lord but we join
[1:31:38] with our pentecostal fathers
[1:31:41] and the call to return all the way back
[1:31:44] to eden lord
[1:31:46] our rightful inheritance in christ
[1:31:49] and though we're subject to these
[1:31:51] sinborn bodies
[1:31:53] yet lord i'm so encouraged that you're
[1:31:55] still doing a work within our souls and
[1:31:57] our
[1:31:58] spirits to rid us from the effects of
[1:32:00] sin lord
[1:32:02] may everyone be encouraged this morning
[1:32:04] lord
[1:32:05] maybe someone that was sat down for a
[1:32:08] little while just to
[1:32:09] take a little reprieve as it were from
[1:32:10] the battle may they
[1:32:12] feel that sword and their holster again
[1:32:15] and say i'm going to
[1:32:16] cut through with the enemy this morning
[1:32:18] i'm going to let more of the character
[1:32:20] of jesus christ into my life and
[1:32:22] do whatever it takes to get there maybe
[1:32:25] take the take the sword this morning cut
[1:32:27] through some video entertainment
[1:32:30] cut through some video games cut through
[1:32:32] some music cut it out of my heart and
[1:32:34] then cut it out of my home
[1:32:36] oh i pray that the men of god this
[1:32:38] morning would make sure their own hearts
[1:32:40] are right before you and then
[1:32:42] lead their family in the way oh god

[1:32:48] purified
[1:32:49] from one glory into another lord and

[1:38:41] but i'm still sinning
[1:38:45] which is telling me that the message i
[1:38:48] heard today
[1:38:49] was perfect that's calling me
[1:38:53] to a higher calling to not be
[1:38:56] satisfied i'm in the message that i made

[1:48:25] let it shine
[1:48:41] amen we don't want to stop sending the
[1:48:44] light
[1:48:46] amen and i think of
[1:48:49] our the very fact that you all
[1:48:53] have come here today you believe
[1:48:57] that there's more for you amen amen
[1:49:01] i think of how the the lord was dealing
[1:49:03] with our brother ron husker
[1:49:06] he's feeling i just i can't stay here
[1:49:08] i've
[1:49:10] i got to get more than what i have
[1:49:13] and that's what god's calling all of us
[1:49:16] we can maintain that call maintain that
[1:49:20] hunger that thirst there's nowhere in
[1:49:23] the bible
[1:49:26] where god ever said you'll get to a
[1:49:28] place
[1:49:30] where no matter how much you hunger no
[1:49:32] matter how much you thirst you're not
[1:49:34] going to get any more
[1:49:36] that's right right so the more that we
[1:49:38] can hunger
[1:49:40] for god there's a deep call there's a
[1:49:41] deep to respond
[1:49:44] and it to me it's just exciting
[1:49:47] that we have something to look forward
[1:49:49] to that there will be more of god
[1:49:52] manifested in us and we can't do that if
[1:49:53] we could we would do it
[1:49:57] but to know that working with god
[1:49:59] through god
[1:50:01] to believe we're workers together with
[1:50:06] christ
[1:50:07] that he can change our vile nature to
[1:50:09] become more like him
[1:50:10] that's something to look forward to amen
[1:50:14] amen amen
[1:50:17] well he's not changing my good nature
[1:50:19] for a better one
