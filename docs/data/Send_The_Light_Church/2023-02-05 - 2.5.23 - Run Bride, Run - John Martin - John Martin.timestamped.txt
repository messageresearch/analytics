[37:06] and then it catches so you you you be
[37:10] that one that you're really believing

[37:53] sister Gabrielle amen no they've been
[37:56] and a tremendous battle but I'll say
[38:00] this the prayers of the Saints have been
[38:02] behind them
[38:04] amen been with them behind them and we
[38:08] are believing through everything that
[38:11] God Will Make A Way he promised to make
[38:13] a way
[38:14] amen before we
[38:15] read here in Galatians let's look to the

[38:39] precious faith and Lord to hear from
[38:42] heaven
[38:44] Lord we're we're capable of reading
[38:49] uh the the Bible but Lord we're not
[38:53] capable of getting Revelation on our own
[38:56] and our dependency is upon you this
[38:59] morning we pray that you would come and
[39:02] reveal this word to us that we may leave
[39:06] here Lord on fire for you
[39:09] Lord just pressing towards uh the mark
[39:13] for the prize in the High Calling Lord
[39:17] we love you this morning and we commit
[39:20] ourselves to you we commit our needs to
[39:22] you we trust Lord that you just increase
[39:25] our faith Lord now as we look to you in
[39:28] Jesus precious name we pray amen amen
[39:32] Galatians chapter 5 starting with verse
[39:35] number seven
[39:38] the Bible says ye did run well
[39:42] who did hinder you
[39:44] that ye should not obey the truth
[39:48] he said this persuasion cometh not from
[39:51] him that originally calleth you
[39:54] A little leaven
[39:55] eth the whole lump
[39:58] amen then Hebrews chapter 12.
[40:03] it only takes a little bit
[40:05] to get us to stop running amen amen just
[40:10] a little bit
[40:12] remember the The Tortoise and the
[40:16] the rabbit you know just took a little
[40:18] bit that rabbit got distracted but that
[40:21] tortoise was focused amen
[40:24] Hebrews chapter 12 verse number one
[40:26] wherefore
[40:27] seeing we also are compassed about
[40:30] what's so great a cloud of witnesses
[40:33] amen let us lay aside every weight
[40:38] and the sin which does so easily beset
[40:41] us
[40:41] and let us run with patience the race
[40:45] that is set before us
[40:46] looking unto Jesus the author and the
[40:49] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[40:51] that was set before him endured the
[40:54] cross despising the shame and is set
[40:56] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[40:58] God Amen God bless you may be seated may
[41:01] the Lord just Quicken his word to us
[41:04] today
[41:05] brother Branham said in the message does
[41:07] God change his mind in 65 he says and
[41:11] we're all sure that there is a church
[41:14] and there is a bride coming out of that
[41:18] church
[41:19] we know that that is true
[41:23] when the bride hears the word she runs
[41:26] from church natural to become the word
[41:29] bride
[41:31] so there is a mixture and when they came
[41:34] out of Egypt they were all mixed
[41:36] multitude brother Branham talks about uh
[41:38] in every Church there's that that
[41:40] mixture there and there is a bride
[41:44] coming out of the church there just
[41:46] isn't a group of people coming out of a
[41:49] denomination church or a man-made Church
[41:52] there is literally a bride coming out of
[41:56] the church
[41:58] and I'd like to entitle this run bride
[42:02] run
[42:03] bride run
[42:06] now the church natural is Anointed
[42:09] it is it's an it's Anointed with a
[42:13] laodicean spirit
[42:15] complacent self-satisfied and careless
[42:21] exercising a spiritual need of nothing
[42:24] right
[42:26] God could not
[42:28] describe this church as being on fire he
[42:32] couldn't describe this church as being
[42:33] ice cold it was somewhere in between
[42:37] a lukewarm condition
[42:40] and I believe the church is stuck there
[42:43] that's what the spirit is it's a it's a
[42:45] lukewarm condition but the bride is
[42:49] running away from that anointing
[42:53] Amanda bride is working out her own
[42:57] salvation with fear and trembling see
[43:01] there's something that comes uh with the
[43:04] bride there is a fear that's always
[43:07] there I need to be doing better I need
[43:09] to make sure I need to press in but
[43:12] Church natural feels always content in
[43:15] the condition that they're in
[43:19] but the Branham said in the
[43:20] Massachusetts and the bride he says the
[43:22] true bride attracts the attention of God
[43:26] by keeping the word
[43:30] amen that's how she gets the attention
[43:33] and you know wives when they want to get
[43:35] the attention of their husband they know
[43:38] how to do it
[43:40] right but the bride the way the bride
[43:43] gets a hold of the bridegroom is by
[43:45] following the word that God had given
[43:47] her
[43:48] and that attraction that makes him give
[43:51] attention to the bride
[43:54] in Philippians chapter 2 verse 12
[43:58] Paul writing to the church he says
[44:00] wherefore my beloved as ye have always
[44:04] obeyed not in my presence only but now
[44:08] much more in my absence work out your
[44:12] own salvation with fear and trembling
[44:17] for it is God which worketh in you both
[44:21] to Will
[44:23] and to do of his good pleasure
[44:27] so do it without murmuring
[44:30] do all things without murmurings and
[44:33] disputings
[44:34] why that you may be blameless
[44:38] harmless the sons of God without rebuke
[44:42] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[44:46] Nation well that sounds like the age
[44:49] that we're living in isn't it
[44:51] amen a crooked and perverse Nation among
[44:55] whom you shine as lights in the world
[44:59] holding forth the word of life amen
[45:03] holding forth the word of life that I
[45:06] may rejoice in the day of Christ that I
[45:09] have not run in vain neither labored in
[45:13] vain
[45:15] you know there's obviously going to be a
[45:18] large group of people that have run in
[45:21] vain because Jesus said many shall come
[45:23] to me many shall come to me we're in a
[45:26] race
[45:27] to get ourselves ready for God's
[45:29] spiritual plan and I believe he wants us
[45:32] to enter into a Rapture don't you
[45:34] believe that
[45:35] the Bible says let us be glad and
[45:37] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[45:39] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[45:41] wife have made herself ready that's the
[45:45] that's the plan that God has for the
[45:47] bride is to get ready so we can go on a
[45:49] Rapture and be with him and the message
[45:52] of choosing of the Bride brother Branham
[45:54] says now we see plainly the spiritual
[45:56] plan of God's planning for his future
[45:58] home with his future bride it comes into
[46:02] view right now so we see God's plan we
[46:06] should not be wondering what God wants
[46:08] us to do we shouldn't be wondering
[46:10] waiting what's going to be happening we
[46:13] know what God wants us to do he wants us
[46:16] to get serious about getting ready amen
[46:19] and we're instructed by the uh race
[46:22] official here to lay aside every weight
[46:26] and the sin that does so easily beset us
[46:30] amen you know things have a way of
[46:32] creeping in so good to see you brother
[46:34] Lando been praying for you thinking
[46:36] about you so much
[46:38] amen you know things have a way of
[46:41] creeping in you take care of things and
[46:45] all of a sudden things want to creep
[46:47] back in and they they want to latch on
[46:49] they want to become a weight to us they
[46:51] want to keep us from running the race
[46:55] the way that we should be running
[46:58] now most people look to Jesus who
[47:01] authored their faith but they don't seem
[47:04] to look any further they don't look to
[47:06] him as far as the finisher of their
[47:09] faith they feel like oh well where's God
[47:12] and why isn't he doing this and I'll
[47:14] come and they they just they only look
[47:16] back towards what has happened in the
[47:19] past
[47:21] right and and some have this attitude
[47:23] well since I've I've I've repented and I
[47:27] got baptized that that I got my
[47:30] salvation sold up and there's no need to
[47:33] really work on my salvation because I
[47:35] already have it and I'm a believer that
[47:37] once saved always saved
[47:40] oh
[47:42] that is scary
[47:46] because we we need to have fear and
[47:49] trembling we need to Jesus himself said
[47:52] he that endured to the end the same
[47:54] shall be saved
[47:56] amen so repentance and baptism and the
[47:59] giving of our hearts to Jesus Christ
[48:00] that is where God authored our faith
[48:04] amen that's where it all began
[48:07] but that's not the end of the
[48:08] requirements that's just the beginning
[48:10] are you with me if you believe the word
[48:12] say Amen now if we were to die at that
[48:16] point we would be ready that is true but
[48:19] if God gives us another day to live that
[48:21] he he has an expectation of what we're
[48:23] going to do with the truth that he gives
[48:25] us that day amen he wants us to keep
[48:27] running in the same direction that we
[48:30] started he wants us to keep pressing
[48:32] towards the mark for the prize of the
[48:33] high calling in Christ Jesus he wants us
[48:36] to keep fighting for the original faith
[48:38] that was once delivered to the Saints he
[48:40] wants us to keep adding to our faith our
[48:42] original Faith virtue and then knowledge
[48:45] and Temperance and and patience and and
[48:48] godliness and brotherly kindness and
[48:50] charity there's a continuation that God
[48:53] has for us if he gives us another day he
[48:57] wants us to keep pressing forward to
[48:59] keep adding to become more than we were
[49:02] the day before
[49:04] now this is a very huge responsibility
[49:08] it requires a lot of effort
[49:15] it's not like putting an egg
[49:18] into a microwave and hitting 30 seconds
[49:21] or whatever it is
[49:24] it requires a lot
[49:27] but we need to be doing this until
[49:31] when brother John how long how long do I
[49:35] got to keep trying as hard as I did when
[49:38] I first started
[49:39] well Ephesians 4 13 tells us
[49:44] till we all come into the unity of the
[49:47] faith
[49:48] and of the knowledge of the son of God
[49:51] unto a perfect man
[49:54] unto the measure of the Statue of the
[49:57] fullness of Christ
[50:01] wow
[50:05] so we're in a race
[50:07] till we come to the manifestation
[50:10] of Christ in her life
[50:13] so anytime that you look at your life
[50:15] and you say I don't need to be pressing
[50:17] you're saying one of two things here
[50:20] you're saying either you're there
[50:22] or you're not part of
[50:25] because the bride will become just like
[50:29] him
[50:30] and there's something in her there's a
[50:32] deep calling that wants to be just like
[50:35] Jesus
[50:37] I mean a perfect marriage is you you
[50:41] want you just the bride looks up to the
[50:45] husband
[50:46] in in a right marriage right
[50:49] and uh
[50:51] there's just certain qualities about the
[50:55] bridegroom that the bride has
[50:57] but you know the bride likes the the
[51:00] groom likes the qualities that the bride
[51:03] has if it's the ones that he has set
[51:07] forth for her
[51:10] and and I
[51:13] I I feel that the bride
[51:17] needs to run
[51:20] she needs to run towards the
[51:23] manifestation of Christ
[51:26] not just going to and fro and
[51:30] here and there and
[51:33] but she needs to be focusing on becoming
[51:36] all that Christ has called her to become
[51:38] now here's the thing my sheep hear my
[51:42] voice
[51:43] and it's an individual walk
[51:46] we're not going collectively in the
[51:49] Rapture God will not send us a telegram
[51:53] telling us when the Rapture is
[51:56] make sure we're ready let's all meet at
[51:59] the church we're taken off from here it
[52:01] will not happen like that
[52:03] so it is an individual Affair we must we
[52:07] must hear the voice of God in the
[52:09] ministry of the word
[52:11] we must
[52:12] in the message the marriage of the land
[52:15] brother Brandon says God has got Amazing
[52:17] Grace to save you and he will do it
[52:21] but if you'll fight but you'll fight
[52:24] every inch of your way
[52:28] he said I've been behind the pulpit
[52:31] going on 31 years
[52:33] and every inch of that has been a fight
[52:39] constantly it certainly has
[52:42] but we must fight if we must reign
[52:47] so we find that the bride has to make
[52:49] herself ready be willing to lay aside
[52:52] every weight
[52:54] that does so easily besetter
[52:57] and we that we might run with patience
[53:01] the race that's set before us brother
[53:03] Brahms Colton there in Hebrews he said
[53:05] we must lay aside
[53:07] ourself
[53:10] now he's starting to identify what the
[53:12] weight is
[53:13] we must lay aside ourselves we can't say
[53:16] God you come and lay them aside for us
[53:21] we've got to do that ourselves see we
[53:24] have a part to play in this race
[53:28] now the majority of the people who
[53:30] started this race never complete it
[53:33] remember that statement the majority of
[53:36] the people who started this race never
[53:38] complete it there's various reasons for
[53:41] it
[53:42] they get distracted
[53:44] dismayed discouraged deceived
[53:49] Satan will offer the world to people
[53:52] whatever a man wants becomes his
[53:55] downfall
[53:56] whatever a man wants literally becomes
[53:59] his downfall the only thing that he can
[54:02] want that won't become his downfall is
[54:03] Christ
[54:05] Satan's goal is to get our eyes off of
[54:08] Christ
[54:09] James chapter 1 verse 14 says but every
[54:13] man is tempted when he's drawn away of
[54:17] his own lust
[54:19] and enticed
[54:21] every man is drawn away of his own
[54:24] longing and his own desire that's what
[54:26] that word lust means his own longing his
[54:28] own desires and he becomes entrapped
[54:32] or beguiled
[54:34] see it's free more agency God is not
[54:36] going to go against him or agency if
[54:39] that's what a person wants that's that's
[54:40] what that's what God will allow
[54:43] so the bride is the only one
[54:47] that will not let her flesh
[54:50] get in the way of her goal
[54:54] which is to become like Christ right
[54:57] brother man says we must lay aside
[54:59] ourselves
[55:02] so some enter this race
[55:05] not really knowing the cost
[55:08] you know this is all you got to do just
[55:10] you know get baptized everything should
[55:11] work out okay in my life
[55:15] some think it's easy race
[55:18] some think it's a
[55:20] it's a short
[55:22] you know race you just all you got to do
[55:25] is fill in the blank
[55:27] just maybe just hit Church once a week
[55:32] are you with me
[55:35] but the majority of the people who enter
[55:36] this race enter it with a broad way of
[55:40] thinking
[55:43] that they can make it on their terms
[55:44] their ways their ideas
[55:47] like they've got it figured out
[55:52] Proverbs 14 12 says there is a way that
[55:55] seemeth right unto man
[55:56] but the end thereof are the ways of
[56:00] death and Jesus described this broad way
[56:04] it leads to destruction and there be wit
[56:09] and many there be which go in there at
[56:11] so we see that there's a lot of people
[56:13] who never complete
[56:21] they never complete the race that's
[56:22] right
[56:23] they get deceived along the way Luke 13
[56:26] verse 23 then said one unto him Lord are
[56:30] there few that be saved
[56:33] I like the way that he answered he
[56:35] didn't say yes or no
[56:37] he said strive to enter in at the
[56:41] Straight Gate
[56:42] for many I say unto you will seek to
[56:45] enter in and shall not be able
[56:51] it it requires something of the heart
[56:55] and of the life and of the will of man a
[56:59] condition that requires striving
[57:04] now if we were going to run
[57:06] a a dash a hundred yard dash
[57:10] well we would put everything we got into
[57:13] that because we only have to go 100
[57:15] yards but this race is a race with all
[57:20] of our life
[57:22] amen so you can't just you know run a
[57:24] hundred yards and then take a break
[57:27] and then run another 100 yards and take
[57:30] a break
[57:31] I'll go to church and then take a break
[57:34] for a week go to church and take it that
[57:37] is not the race that we're in
[57:40] we're in a race that requires a
[57:43] continual striving a continual pressing
[57:48] you will find in most all people a
[57:51] desire for God and a willingness to seek
[57:54] truth but what separates the bride from
[57:56] the church is she's giving her all to
[57:59] manifest Christ
[58:03] and you may not know it to the very end
[58:05] I mean look what happened to Judas no
[58:08] one would have never guessed Judas would
[58:11] end up where he was
[58:12] why number one because Jesus chose them
[58:16] if Jesus told them that's good enough
[58:19] for me right I would have never I would
[58:21] have never guessed it right right but he
[58:23] chose them that the scripture might be
[58:25] fulfilled
[58:27] and and
[58:29] that's why we should never be shaken
[58:31] what we see happen or not happening in a
[58:34] church
[58:35] God's got everything under control but
[58:38] what's really really important is that
[58:40] we the bride run
[58:44] we run this race as if our life depends
[58:47] upon it our show depends the
[58:50] manifestation of Christ in our life
[58:52] depends upon it
[58:55] to find God at all the crossroads of
[58:57] your life requires all of your heart's
[59:00] desire
[59:02] that's the only way you'll Truly find
[59:03] God when you want him more than anything
[59:07] I don't care if you just started I don't
[59:09] care if you're going through a dry spell
[59:11] I don't care what Crossroad you are in
[59:13] your life if you want to find God it's
[59:16] one simple ingredient
[59:18] Jeremiah 29 13 we all know it and ye
[59:22] shall seek me and find me when you
[59:25] search for me with all your heart now if
[59:28] you tell me you've done that but he
[59:31] hasn't showed up I would have to say
[59:34] you're a liar versus God
[59:38] because God can't lie we may think we've
[59:41] searched with all of our we may think
[59:43] we've tried with all of our heart but
[59:45] the honest truth is if he hasn't showed
[59:47] up yet that means we need to keep amen
[59:50] we just need to keep going keep keep and
[59:53] then he'll keep his word amen and I will
[59:56] be found if you saith the Lord and I
[59:58] will turn away your captivity how many
[1:00:00] wants a closer walk with the Lord amen
[1:00:04] seeking the Lord with all your heart is
[1:00:06] the only way to get get ahead in this
[1:00:08] race
[1:00:09] looking unto Jesus the author and the
[1:00:12] finisher of our faith
[1:00:15] and then lay aside
[1:00:17] the things in your life that are holding
[1:00:20] you back I'm sure we should all be able
[1:00:22] to look at our life today and see that
[1:00:24] there's things that's keeping us from
[1:00:27] pressing into the Lord
[1:00:29] come on Amen come on this is church we
[1:00:32] should be able to talk about those
[1:00:34] things
[1:00:36] that's what church is for right amen
[1:00:40] that's all I say to the bride now I'm
[1:00:42] talking to the bride I'm not talking to
[1:00:44] the church that's right run
[1:00:47] run bride the devil will do everything
[1:00:51] he can to keep you from not going in the
[1:00:53] Rapture he would like to see everybody
[1:00:55] go through tribulation
[1:00:58] but we're in a race
[1:01:01] this is not the time to get our eyes on
[1:01:03] the foolish virgins
[1:01:07] right comparing yourself with somebody
[1:01:10] who hasn't press it in oh I'm doing
[1:01:12] better than they are
[1:01:14] what a trick that that is
[1:01:17] not a time to be looking at the foolish
[1:01:19] virgins
[1:01:22] this is the time to get our eyes back on
[1:01:24] the promise what promise that I will
[1:01:27] manifest Jesus Christ
[1:01:30] that's what's important
[1:01:32] this needs to become your goal
[1:01:35] it is the goal of the Bride
[1:01:40] it it she attracts
[1:01:44] the groom by obeying the word that he
[1:01:48] gives her so it's up to you to to be
[1:01:52] able to leave here and say God spoke to
[1:01:55] me this
[1:01:57] because if you can't say that how can
[1:01:59] you walk out and do it right
[1:02:04] because if you hear the word you do it
[1:02:06] now you're going to attract God
[1:02:08] and we all want we all want to be
[1:02:11] attracted by God right
[1:02:14] amen amen
[1:02:16] we're on a race whether we realize it or
[1:02:19] not
[1:02:20] the world isn't a rat race
[1:02:24] they're going to and fro trying to get
[1:02:26] ahead keep up with the Joneses and so
[1:02:28] forth but for the believer
[1:02:31] whether we're on fire for God or we're
[1:02:33] backslidden
[1:02:35] without the joy of the Lord
[1:02:37] we're in a race
[1:02:42] we may be uh
[1:02:47] wandering in the wrong things
[1:02:50] but we're in a race
[1:02:53] and there's no time to wait for someone
[1:02:55] to throw us a pity party
[1:02:59] to come over throw us a pity party and
[1:03:02] help us feel better in our condition
[1:03:04] we need to get up and we need to start
[1:03:07] running this race with all of our hearts
[1:03:10] now God promised that he had not put
[1:03:12] anything on us that we couldn't bear
[1:03:13] amen
[1:03:15] amen and I am sure this that on the day
[1:03:17] of judgment there will not be one person
[1:03:19] that will be able to tell God or prove
[1:03:22] to God that he did
[1:03:24] right but yet you will have a world full
[1:03:26] of people trying to tell God that they
[1:03:29] gave him too much
[1:03:32] so I say to you get up and start running
[1:03:35] the race
[1:03:37] lay aside what needs to be laid aside
[1:03:40] First Corinthians 9 verse 24 know ye not
[1:03:44] that they which run in a race
[1:03:47] run all in other words we're all in a
[1:03:49] race
[1:03:51] but one receiveth the prize
[1:03:54] so run that you may attain now we're all
[1:03:58] on a race but unfortunately you're not
[1:04:00] running against me and I ain't running
[1:04:02] against you
[1:04:04] we're not running against one another we
[1:04:06] don't compare ourselves with one another
[1:04:07] that's unwise but we are in a race
[1:04:12] the natural man and the spiritual man
[1:04:16] they're running
[1:04:20] amen problem is most Believers are not
[1:04:23] running to obtain right true
[1:04:27] and Paul said here so run that ye may
[1:04:32] obtain
[1:04:33] why did you come to church today
[1:04:37] is it because it's Sunday
[1:04:40] so you're obtaining church on Sunday
[1:04:44] what did you come for
[1:04:47] it's like the scripture what did you go
[1:04:48] out to see Jesus asked the question
[1:04:53] what are you here to obtain
[1:04:58] we need to run with the mindset of
[1:05:01] obtaining that's where faith comes in
[1:05:05] that I am going to manifest Christ I'm
[1:05:07] not going to just be filled with head
[1:05:10] knowledge is not going to get you in a
[1:05:11] rapture
[1:05:14] no it's a manifestation of Christ
[1:05:18] thank you
[1:05:19] they run a lot of people run as if
[1:05:23] they've already obtained
[1:05:25] right
[1:05:26] that's what that's what gets them in
[1:05:28] that lukewarm layout to see in need of
[1:05:30] nothing
[1:05:31] you're stuck
[1:05:33] they're stuck there
[1:05:35] but the scripture says and every man
[1:05:37] that striveth for the Mastery is
[1:05:40] temperate in all things
[1:05:43] now they do it to obtain a corruptable
[1:05:46] crown but we in uncorruptable crowns so
[1:05:48] in other words you that are going to be
[1:05:50] watching who's going to watch the Pro
[1:05:53] Bowl today isn't there a pro bowl or no
[1:05:55] I think so are the Super Bowl's coming
[1:05:57] up next week and so these people who are
[1:06:01] in this race I don't care if you're a
[1:06:02] runner or what sport you're in you
[1:06:05] literally spend time practicing right
[1:06:09] getting in shape
[1:06:11] and and you you don't play against
[1:06:13] people who don't hardly know how to play
[1:06:18] you you you're you you you're trained
[1:06:22] because you need to be the best
[1:06:25] and so we're in a race
[1:06:28] to overcome
[1:06:31] and Satan knows how to use our flesh to
[1:06:34] keep us from being Overcomers
[1:06:37] how to keep us down
[1:06:39] but we've been taught God has sent a
[1:06:43] message for us we have the blueprint in
[1:06:46] this word of God how to be an overcomer
[1:06:49] we've been trained by the best to be the
[1:06:52] best for the best
[1:06:54] amen
[1:06:57] he says I therefore so run not as
[1:07:01] uncertainly I'm not sure if I'm gonna
[1:07:05] I'm not sure if I'm gonna be the bride
[1:07:07] or not
[1:07:08] Soul fight I not as one that beateth the
[1:07:11] air I mean if you go like this real hard
[1:07:13] you know what you're gonna you know what
[1:07:15] you're gonna hurt is this
[1:07:17] roof
[1:07:19] you got to make contact
[1:07:21] gotta know who your enemy is
[1:07:24] [Music]
[1:07:26] your enemy isn't me right
[1:07:29] your enemy isn't your brother your
[1:07:31] sister your husband your wife your
[1:07:33] children your mother your father you
[1:07:36] know your enemy is you
[1:07:40] and you gotta like
[1:07:42] know what you're hitting when you're
[1:07:43] going for him
[1:07:46] not physically no
[1:07:48] I don't want you coming to coming to
[1:07:51] church with black and blue face
[1:07:55] here it is but I keep under my body
[1:08:00] and bring it into subjection
[1:08:05] lest by any means when I preach to
[1:08:07] others I myself
[1:08:09] should be a Castaway
[1:08:11] now all of our bodies everyone there is
[1:08:14] nobody here whose body is better than
[1:08:17] anybody else's body
[1:08:19] everybody here everybody not everybody
[1:08:22] but everybody
[1:08:25] has the capability of rising up
[1:08:29] lashing out
[1:08:32] and trying to take over the spiritual
[1:08:36] man
[1:08:40] Paul says we're in a race
[1:08:43] and this race requires us to keep this
[1:08:46] body under subjection
[1:08:49] or else
[1:08:51] we're not winning the race
[1:08:55] no Satan has already
[1:09:00] shall we say he did a Mastery job
[1:09:04] with our flesh
[1:09:06] we didn't even have to be taught to lie
[1:09:10] to steal
[1:09:11] we were doing that without Mom and Dad
[1:09:14] teaching us
[1:09:15] so he's he knows
[1:09:18] how to
[1:09:19] get this flash to achieve deceiving
[1:09:23] things
[1:09:25] but now we
[1:09:28] we want to win this race
[1:09:30] we want to make a rapture we want to get
[1:09:33] out of here we do not want to be left
[1:09:35] behind with laodicea
[1:09:37] amen we do not want to be left behind
[1:09:40] with the foolish virgins we do not want
[1:09:42] to be left behind with those who did not
[1:09:44] want to give all their heart
[1:09:48] so the word is teaching us the message
[1:09:51] is teaching us what we need to do
[1:09:55] and part of that is keep our body
[1:09:59] under subjection
[1:10:00] to what to the word
[1:10:04] fear that word fear that word reverence
[1:10:07] that word god what would you have me to
[1:10:09] do do not expect God to come and call
[1:10:12] out your name and say this is what you
[1:10:14] need to be doing
[1:10:16] you need to let God so bad that you you
[1:10:19] that you prepare your heart and say God
[1:10:21] there may be a thousand two thousand
[1:10:24] three thousand words spoken today but if
[1:10:26] you just speak one word to me personally
[1:10:28] I will do it Lord that's what God is
[1:10:31] looking for and that's what the bride
[1:10:33] has I believe that
[1:10:37] Paul's battle or his race was against a
[1:10:40] lazy flesh
[1:10:42] didn't want to stay dead
[1:10:45] that's why he said I Die daily
[1:10:47] he didn't say I die on Sundays
[1:10:51] I start my week off
[1:10:54] no
[1:10:56] I Die daily
[1:10:58] it's something that we need to think
[1:10:59] about do we even think about dying daily
[1:11:03] do we automatically think we're dead
[1:11:05] daily
[1:11:07] if you're going to think oh anything
[1:11:08] automatically think that you're alive
[1:11:10] your flesh is alive wants to do its will
[1:11:13] if you're going to think automatically
[1:11:15] that's the way to overthink
[1:11:17] that's the way to think because we need
[1:11:20] to Die daily if Paul needed to Die daily
[1:11:24] if Jesus told us that we need to Die
[1:11:26] daily then we need to Die daily
[1:11:30] amen amen I know it may not sound fun
[1:11:33] but I'll tell you what the quicker you
[1:11:35] agree with the word the quicker the
[1:11:37] devil will leave you
[1:11:38] sir amen the devil isn't out here he's
[1:11:41] here
[1:11:43] and we need to get him out of here
[1:11:46] he said I keep under my body and bring
[1:11:48] it into subjection it takes a Act of
[1:11:52] crucifying of the flesh to for that to
[1:11:56] happen
[1:11:57] that's what keeps the bride running her
[1:11:59] race victoriously is is by keeping her
[1:12:03] flesh under subjection when it wants to
[1:12:05] rise up no she goes to God In Prayer
[1:12:08] she learns to say I'm sorry when she's
[1:12:11] wrong she learns to every time she falls
[1:12:14] she gets back up right that's what the
[1:12:16] Bible says if a righteous man falls
[1:12:18] seven times seven times he'll get back
[1:12:20] up it doesn't say if a sinner falls
[1:12:22] seven times he'll get back up no
[1:12:25] a sinner when he falls he doesn't want
[1:12:27] to repent he doesn't get back up the
[1:12:29] very fact that you repent that you get
[1:12:31] back up shows where you're standing in
[1:12:34] the economy of God
[1:12:36] now Jesus born died a sinless lamb of
[1:12:42] God to take away the sins of the world
[1:12:43] for for Adam for Eve that we could be
[1:12:46] saved he sent his only begotten son now
[1:12:49] Jesus did this for the whole world
[1:12:52] but in order for the whole world to
[1:12:54] benefit from the death they need to
[1:12:56] receive it
[1:12:58] right
[1:13:00] it's all about receiving it's all about
[1:13:02] receiving the word now they you don't
[1:13:05] receive it as a gift
[1:13:09] right as a natural gift you don't
[1:13:11] receive it is a gift but you don't
[1:13:13] receive it as a gift this you have to
[1:13:15] give something
[1:13:17] you can't earn it can't work for it
[1:13:20] but he doesn't give salvation like this
[1:13:22] to everybody
[1:13:24] he gives his gifts like that
[1:13:26] but he doesn't give salvation like that
[1:13:29] you have to you have to repent of your
[1:13:32] your life
[1:13:34] your nature
[1:13:36] and you have to accept his will into
[1:13:39] your heart
[1:13:40] is that right the Bible says he came to
[1:13:43] his own
[1:13:44] and his own received him not
[1:13:47] but as many as received him
[1:13:51] then gave he power to become
[1:13:54] sons of God
[1:13:56] power to become a son it takes power to
[1:13:59] become a son
[1:14:03] a lot of people they'll hear the word of
[1:14:05] God and they'll do nothing
[1:14:07] they'll literally do nothing
[1:14:10] it literally takes power to become and
[1:14:13] what is that power
[1:14:14] well we know the Holy Ghost is power
[1:14:17] so you shall receive power after the
[1:14:19] Holy Ghost has come upon you when you
[1:14:22] believe the word of God it becomes real
[1:14:25] to you
[1:14:28] you may not feel it you may not taste it
[1:14:30] but it becomes real to you
[1:14:34] it will become manifested to you
[1:14:38] First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 13
[1:14:41] says for by one Spirit we are all
[1:14:45] baptized into one body
[1:14:49] whether it be jew or Gentile whether it
[1:14:51] be bonder free whether at all and have
[1:14:55] been all made to drink into one spirit
[1:15:00] so what is the one thing that we all
[1:15:02] have in common here
[1:15:04] it's the Holy Ghost
[1:15:06] it's the spirit of God that puts us all
[1:15:09] in common
[1:15:12] amen
[1:15:14] and the the more that the blood of Jesus
[1:15:16] Christ cleanses us from all of our sins
[1:15:19] the more in unity we become
[1:15:23] I'll tell you I I like this word being
[1:15:26] preached I don't know about you
[1:15:31] all right Romans chapter 6 verse 3 keep
[1:15:35] in mind that word baptized that word
[1:15:37] baptized
[1:15:39] what that word baptized means is
[1:15:42] to make
[1:15:43] whelm that is fully wet in golf
[1:15:46] submerged or buried so I just keep that
[1:15:49] in mind now we know that speaking of the
[1:15:53] spiritual baptism
[1:15:56] okay
[1:15:57] Romans 6 verse 3 says know ye not that
[1:16:01] so many of us as we're baptized into
[1:16:03] Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[1:16:08] death
[1:16:10] a lot of people don't think about that
[1:16:14] this is not just for water baptism
[1:16:17] although it's a perfect type to be
[1:16:20] totally engulfed by water fully wet by
[1:16:23] submersion we don't bring in believe in
[1:16:25] sprinkling we just we we got to go all
[1:16:28] the way under we got to be buried
[1:16:33] now water baptism doesn't save us right
[1:16:38] the Bible says it's just an outward
[1:16:40] expression of what's going on on the
[1:16:44] inside
[1:16:45] so what is going on on the inside
[1:16:52] the Holy Ghost is engulfing us
[1:16:56] it's it's taking over our desires
[1:17:01] it's
[1:17:02] it's making us new creatures
[1:17:07] amen and it happens daily
[1:17:10] it happens Moment by moment
[1:17:13] it's happening with the bride
[1:17:16] this ain't happening with the church
[1:17:19] that's why I say run bride run
[1:17:23] focus on the Lord focus on the word
[1:17:26] don't get your eyes on anybody else
[1:17:28] anything else you're going to miss it
[1:17:31] because the devil is just you know
[1:17:35] rocking everybody to sleep
[1:17:39] if that Parable think about it that
[1:17:42] parable about the ten virgins
[1:17:44] the Bible says they all slept
[1:17:48] so we need
[1:17:52] yeah we need to to wake up and press in
[1:17:54] because it's getting close don't you
[1:17:57] believe that
[1:17:58] if you want to win the race
[1:18:00] we must become fully engulfed submerged
[1:18:04] or buried in the Holy Ghost
[1:18:06] don't just be satisfied with the portion
[1:18:09] you have
[1:18:12] want more
[1:18:13] want more always want more it's not
[1:18:17] we're not saying God hasn't done enough
[1:18:20] for us
[1:18:21] but that God wants to give us more than
[1:18:24] we want to have
[1:18:28] but God is wanting us to hunger to
[1:18:31] thirst to spend time in prayer to say
[1:18:33] God I want more of you I want to
[1:18:35] manifest I want to sh I want to show
[1:18:37] forth you Lord
[1:18:39] in the middle of my trials
[1:18:42] I want everybody to see you in the
[1:18:45] middle of my trial
[1:18:47] I don't want them to see me
[1:18:50] I don't want them to see
[1:18:52] carnal I don't want them to see me
[1:18:55] shriveled up dried up without any fruit
[1:18:59] I want them to see love joy peace
[1:19:03] long-suffering gentleness I want them to
[1:19:05] see the power of God living in me
[1:19:09] amen not just the power of God that I
[1:19:12] can speak over somebody
[1:19:14] but the power of God living in me
[1:19:16] because that's why God sent the Holy
[1:19:19] Ghost
[1:19:20] he wouldn't let him go out witnessing
[1:19:22] until they had the Holy Ghost
[1:19:25] hey
[1:19:26] for by one Spirit we are all baptized
[1:19:28] into one body
[1:19:30] water baptism puts us into the race
[1:19:33] spiritual baptism gives us power for the
[1:19:37] race
[1:19:38] amen yes no you're not that so many of
[1:19:41] us were baptized into Jesus Christ we're
[1:19:44] baptized into his death
[1:19:46] now this is type
[1:19:49] when we went down into the water to get
[1:19:51] baptized
[1:19:52] we were burying our old selfish nature
[1:19:59] if you remember the person that talked
[1:20:01] to you when you got baptized they talked
[1:20:04] to you are you ready to put your your
[1:20:06] past not just your sins but your past
[1:20:09] life
[1:20:10] I don't believe anyone that really
[1:20:12] baptized uh baptized a person would ever
[1:20:16] say are you ready to get ready your sins
[1:20:19] of your past but you can keep doing them
[1:20:22] no
[1:20:24] so that baptism when you went down into
[1:20:27] the water that was a type of what you're
[1:20:30] going to do with your life
[1:20:32] that you're going to bury your past
[1:20:36] and that you're going to wake up you're
[1:20:38] going to come out of that water
[1:20:40] with a new Direction
[1:20:42] are you with me
[1:20:44] amen all right verse 4 therefore we are
[1:20:48] buried with him by baptism into his
[1:20:52] death that like as Christ was raised up
[1:20:55] from the dead by the glory of the father
[1:20:56] even so we should walk
[1:20:59] in newness of life
[1:21:03] we should walk in newness of life
[1:21:06] oh my how many
[1:21:08] hungers for that how many's thirsting
[1:21:11] for that
[1:21:14] now this is not something that we try to
[1:21:16] do on our own right
[1:21:18] we don't try to walk on our own if
[1:21:23] there's anything that we need to try to
[1:21:24] do is die out to our will
[1:21:27] and let the Holy Ghost come in let the
[1:21:30] Holy Ghost have its way if we're really
[1:21:33] sincere about dying out to our selfish
[1:21:36] nature God will provide to us newness of
[1:21:39] life
[1:21:41] but we got to do our part first for if
[1:21:44] we have been planted together in the
[1:21:46] likeness of his death we shall also be
[1:21:48] in the likeness of his resurrection
[1:21:51] now I'll say you can't fake death
[1:21:54] we've all seen those movies or stories
[1:21:57] or something where somebody fakes their
[1:21:59] death
[1:22:00] right
[1:22:02] but they're still alive
[1:22:05] but you can't fake your death
[1:22:08] it don't take long and people know
[1:22:10] whether you're still kicking or not
[1:22:12] amen
[1:22:14] either our nature is manifesting Christ
[1:22:17] or we're still kicking
[1:22:19] and it's not a one time deal it's
[1:22:23] something that has to be done on a
[1:22:25] regular basis on a regular basis
[1:22:28] the bride will be the only one willing
[1:22:30] to die out all the way
[1:22:32] that's why I say run
[1:22:34] she's the only one that's willing to go
[1:22:36] all the way everybody else will go
[1:22:38] partial the church will go part way
[1:22:41] I mean brother Bram talked about Judas
[1:22:44] right he went almost all the way but
[1:22:47] then at the end he stopped
[1:22:50] the foolish virgins will stop short
[1:22:53] somewhere along the way but I say to the
[1:22:55] bride run run with all your heart
[1:22:59] go after him
[1:23:01] go after him go after the bridegroom go
[1:23:04] after your husband run that you may
[1:23:07] obtain
[1:23:09] Ron that you may obtain knowing this
[1:23:12] verse 6 that our old man is crucified
[1:23:15] with him that the body of sin might be
[1:23:17] destroyed that henceforth we should not
[1:23:20] serve sin for he that is dead is free
[1:23:24] from sin
[1:23:28] henceforth we should not serve sin what
[1:23:32] is sin ourselves
[1:23:37] for he that is deep dead is freed from
[1:23:41] himself the bride
[1:23:44] has risen
[1:23:46] with Christ
[1:23:48] she's in another
[1:23:51] dimension
[1:23:55] she's in connection
[1:23:59] cheese
[1:24:00] walking in newness of life
[1:24:05] she is spending time
[1:24:07] seeking the Lord Colossians chapter 3
[1:24:11] verse 1 says if ye then be risen with
[1:24:15] Christ
[1:24:17] seek those things which are above
[1:24:21] where Christ sitteth on the right hand
[1:24:23] of God set your affections on things
[1:24:26] above not on things
[1:24:29] on the Earth
[1:24:30] show on a difference now you know
[1:24:33] there's nothing more that Satan would
[1:24:35] like to do is to get us so busy that we
[1:24:37] just don't got time
[1:24:40] but you know what I'd rather have
[1:24:42] everything else go in my life
[1:24:45] and put Christ first give him time spend
[1:24:49] time with him and seek him because you
[1:24:51] know what no matter
[1:24:53] no matter and I under believe me I have
[1:24:56] a lot of bosses
[1:24:58] at trusted too every one of our customer
[1:25:00] is my boss
[1:25:02] right and if I don't please him well
[1:25:05] then they'll get somebody else
[1:25:08] so I know what it's like to be under
[1:25:10] subjection to not one or two but to a
[1:25:13] lot of bosses
[1:25:15] and to keep them balanced and to make
[1:25:17] sure one doesn't cross the other so you
[1:25:19] got to keep them all happy
[1:25:23] but I'll tell you what as much as if I
[1:25:27] had to if I had to I don't believe the
[1:25:29] Lord puts me in that condition unless I
[1:25:32] make a mistake
[1:25:33] but if I had to I would have to let all
[1:25:36] that go to make sure God was first in my
[1:25:39] life
[1:25:42] I don't think he would put me in that
[1:25:44] position and that's why we made a
[1:25:46] decision that we will never work a
[1:25:48] Sunday
[1:25:50] it was made before it started
[1:25:54] and the thing is if you put God first he
[1:25:58] will bless you for putting him first
[1:26:01] but putting him first is not just say I
[1:26:04] put you first
[1:26:06] you literally got to do it
[1:26:09] and you will be tested
[1:26:14] we've got to see those things which are
[1:26:17] above we've got to find time to do it
[1:26:20] the bride will do it
[1:26:23] Revelations chapter 4 verse one after
[1:26:25] this I looked and behold a door was open
[1:26:27] in heaven the first voice which I heard
[1:26:29] was as it were the trumpet talking to me
[1:26:32] which said come up hither and I will
[1:26:35] show thee things which must be Hereafter
[1:26:38] I just want to say this if you really
[1:26:41] really really
[1:26:44] want to hear from God if you really
[1:26:48] want a closer walk if you want him to
[1:26:51] show you things to come
[1:26:54] come up hither amen
[1:26:57] seek the Lord
[1:27:00] don't stay down here where you're at
[1:27:03] start looking for something more than
[1:27:05] where you're at I tell you if we're
[1:27:07] going to come up hither we would have to
[1:27:09] actually go like this
[1:27:11] we can't stay in the same category the
[1:27:14] same place that we're at
[1:27:16] so to come up hither you've got to seek
[1:27:19] the Lord more you've got to press in
[1:27:21] you've got to say God I need you Lord
[1:27:24] look what I'm going through I'm calling
[1:27:26] upon you this is what the bride does
[1:27:30] the bride does this not the foolish
[1:27:32] version
[1:27:36] if you want a closer walk with Christ
[1:27:38] start seeking them more
[1:27:40] you know the song If you always do what
[1:27:43] you've always done you're always going
[1:27:45] to get what you always got
[1:27:47] so you got to do something different to
[1:27:49] get something different
[1:27:52] amen it's time to set your affections on
[1:27:55] things above it's time to seek those
[1:27:57] things that are above it's time to draw
[1:27:59] nigh to God
[1:28:01] it's time bride
[1:28:03] we must always remember that we're in a
[1:28:06] race till we're out of here
[1:28:08] we haven't won the race
[1:28:11] we haven't won it
[1:28:16] the way the tree falls that's the way it
[1:28:18] lies right
[1:28:20] even though the works were finished from
[1:28:22] the foundation of the world we must
[1:28:24] complete our race our leg the part that
[1:28:27] we play
[1:28:29] we need to look to Jesus
[1:28:31] Jesus never stopped the race
[1:28:35] he never stopped
[1:28:37] until his natural life was over
[1:28:40] think about that the race wasn't over
[1:28:43] until he hung on the cross and said it
[1:28:45] is finished
[1:28:48] he still had to run the race and we need
[1:28:51] to keep running the race with patience
[1:28:53] right to the very end of our lives
[1:28:57] Paul kept running the race
[1:28:59] to the very end here in Philippians
[1:29:01] chapter 3 we all know the scriptures I
[1:29:04] just want you to I want you to see where
[1:29:06] where
[1:29:07] ask yourself where your attitude is at
[1:29:09] today
[1:29:11] he says not as though I've already
[1:29:13] attained
[1:29:15] either we're already perfect that means
[1:29:18] complete
[1:29:19] but I follow after
[1:29:21] if that I may apprehend that for which
[1:29:24] I'm also which also I am apprehended of
[1:29:27] Jesus Christ Brethren I count not myself
[1:29:30] to have apprehended
[1:29:33] but this one thing I do I'm forgetting
[1:29:36] those things which are behind and I'm
[1:29:38] reaching forth unto those things which
[1:29:39] are before me I press toward the mark
[1:29:42] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[1:29:45] in Christ Jesus
[1:29:47] what an example Paul was for us
[1:29:53] always pressing
[1:29:55] he was always running the race
[1:30:00] amen amen I say to the bride here
[1:30:04] whosoever the bride
[1:30:07] I don't know who's bride
[1:30:10] I don't
[1:30:12] but I say to the bride run
[1:30:16] bride run the devil's after us all
[1:30:21] he wants to keep us from the holy ghost
[1:30:23] from power to overcome he wants to keep
[1:30:25] us from coming to church he wants to
[1:30:28] keep us from getting grounded and and
[1:30:30] rooted in the love of God
[1:30:33] can you say Amen to that
[1:30:35] has the devil ever spoke those things to
[1:30:37] you of course we should be saying Amen
[1:30:39] to that
[1:30:40] he's trying to keep us so busy that we
[1:30:43] can't even get to church
[1:30:45] we can't even listen to The Prophet we
[1:30:48] can't look for lost souls we can't help
[1:30:50] the body
[1:30:52] we don't get serious with God
[1:30:56] brother Brian said in the message God's
[1:30:57] provided a way of approach to Fellowship
[1:31:00] he says if she don't want to go into the
[1:31:03] complete fellowship and relationship
[1:31:05] with her husband
[1:31:06] if she don't want to go into the
[1:31:09] complete fellowship and relationship
[1:31:10] with her husband there'll never be any
[1:31:13] more life
[1:31:15] and you understand what brother
[1:31:16] Brandon's saying here if you don't get
[1:31:19] deeper in to God they'll never come
[1:31:22] forth the manifestation of his life
[1:31:25] inside of us
[1:31:27] now that's the way it is today we claim
[1:31:29] to be the bride of Christ
[1:31:31] we claim we're the bride
[1:31:33] and if we are the bride we're to bring
[1:31:36] forth children
[1:31:39] hmm
[1:31:40] now that
[1:31:42] is that statement shows responsibility
[1:31:47] there's no excuse for any of us
[1:31:51] God is looking for us to manifest him
[1:31:55] and to take this word and to share it
[1:31:57] with somebody
[1:32:00] to bring forth Christ
[1:32:03] run bride run run with this word run
[1:32:06] with the message run with this word
[1:32:10] rededicate yourself
[1:32:13] don't be afraid of making a commitment
[1:32:15] to Christ
[1:32:17] don't be afraid of vowing to be more
[1:32:21] faithful
[1:32:22] a lot of times we don't do that because
[1:32:23] we're just afraid that we won't be able
[1:32:26] to keep it
[1:32:29] and you know what you'll always feel
[1:32:32] that way
[1:32:34] talk to some of the old-timers
[1:32:37] but
[1:32:38] you still got to do it
[1:32:41] you got to say boo back to the devil
[1:32:45] you you've got to say I am one of the
[1:32:48] few
[1:32:48] I am the bride I can live this word I
[1:32:53] can do all things through Christ you
[1:32:55] strengtheneth me and you've got to run
[1:32:57] this race
[1:32:59] you can't sit with laodicea
[1:33:02] you got to run it
[1:33:05] don't be afraid of reading your Bible
[1:33:06] more
[1:33:09] time that's right
[1:33:13] afraid to get into church on time
[1:33:15] amen what's that that's a half hour
[1:33:18] before service so you can pray
[1:33:22] don't be afraid of putting God first in
[1:33:24] our homes
[1:33:27] what does that really mean Brother John
[1:33:29] that means take the Bible is your road
[1:33:31] map
[1:33:33] you wherever that Prophet taught let it
[1:33:35] be the order of your home
[1:33:38] run bride run
[1:33:40] the devil's after you
[1:33:43] be sober be vigilant because your
[1:33:47] adversary the devil as a wrong line
[1:33:50] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[1:33:55] the devil will try to divide you away
[1:33:59] from the body
[1:34:01] he will try to divide you away from one
[1:34:03] another
[1:34:05] man said in the message to Paradox he
[1:34:07] says how are we going to lose this great
[1:34:11] race
[1:34:13] it's because we're divided
[1:34:17] remember they were in the upper room
[1:34:19] one mind one Accord
[1:34:22] how we going to do it
[1:34:25] he says we've got to stay together
[1:34:27] we're all believers in God the Holy
[1:34:30] Ghost takes us all in
[1:34:33] it'll be a paradox if God ever gets us
[1:34:36] together but he will
[1:34:38] that's the bride I can see the foolish
[1:34:42] virgins being divided but the bride will
[1:34:44] not be
[1:34:45] come on the bride will not be divided
[1:34:50] he said just trust him he knows how to
[1:34:53] send persecution that will run us
[1:34:56] together
[1:34:57] you know persecution sends some this way
[1:35:01] and sends some this way
[1:35:05] yeah persecution look what it did to the
[1:35:08] to the disciples when persecution came
[1:35:10] right they all went out doing the will
[1:35:13] of God spreading the gospel
[1:35:16] but they were they were together
[1:35:19] they were together in their purpose yes
[1:35:22] yes they were fulfilling the word of God
[1:35:26] Romans chapter 13 verse 11 says and that
[1:35:29] knowing the time that now is high time
[1:35:32] to awake out of our sleep that's a
[1:35:35] spiritual sleep for now is our Salvation
[1:35:38] nearer
[1:35:41] then when we first believed now this
[1:35:44] stumps a lot of people because some
[1:35:45] people think that they were salvation is
[1:35:48] when they got baptized
[1:35:52] but it's it's actually it's not to the
[1:35:55] end
[1:35:56] that's just the beginning
[1:36:00] no no that's strong
[1:36:03] but we need to run we need to keep
[1:36:05] running
[1:36:06] we need to keep running that we may
[1:36:08] obtain
[1:36:10] oh if we die before then and we're
[1:36:12] running
[1:36:13] that's it
[1:36:15] but the scripture says for now is our
[1:36:18] Salvation nearer than when we first then
[1:36:20] when we believed the night is far spent
[1:36:23] the day is at hand let us cast off the
[1:36:26] works of darkness just lay aside every
[1:36:28] weight and let us put on the armor of
[1:36:32] Jesus Christ
[1:36:34] let us walk honestly as in the day not
[1:36:38] rioting
[1:36:39] drunkenness
[1:36:41] not in chambering and wanting not in
[1:36:45] strife and envy
[1:36:48] but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:51] and make not provision for the flesh to
[1:36:55] fulfill the lust thereof this is the
[1:36:57] hour that we need to run bride run run
[1:37:01] home run into his arms don't stop
[1:37:04] running away from your situation and
[1:37:07] start running to Christ with all your
[1:37:09] heart put Christ on
[1:37:12] the name of the Lord is a high tower
[1:37:15] and the righteous run into it and are
[1:37:18] safe I believe the bride is running to
[1:37:21] the arms of Christ she sheltered in the
[1:37:23] arms of Christ
[1:37:24] brother Brandon said in the message
[1:37:26] earnestly continued for the faith that
[1:37:28] was once delivered to the Saints he said
[1:37:30] when Rebecca seen Isaac she jumped off
[1:37:34] the camel and run to meet him
[1:37:37] it was love at first sight I think part
[1:37:41] of it is we're not getting our eyes
[1:37:43] enough on our Isaac
[1:37:46] amen
[1:37:47] we need to keep our eyes on him the
[1:37:50] author and the finisher of our faith we
[1:37:53] need to run this race amen
[1:37:55] lay aside every weight and the sin that
[1:37:59] does so easily beset us
[1:38:01] let us lay aside I think that's what
[1:38:05] brother Brandon said when he went on to
[1:38:07] the over on over the curtain of time and
[1:38:10] he came back he said he said whatever
[1:38:12] you do lay aside everything else
[1:38:18] until you get perfect love
[1:38:22] lay aside brother John I got a lot of
[1:38:25] stuff going on
[1:38:27] look I'll be honest with you brother
[1:38:30] Branham didn't come to call a foolish
[1:38:34] virgin out of the church
[1:38:39] he was called to get a bride out of the
[1:38:43] church
[1:38:45] this word isn't for everybody
[1:38:48] but I say to the bride
[1:38:50] lay aside everything else until you get
[1:38:53] perfect love because that's what will
[1:38:55] make it in there
[1:38:57] run
[1:38:59] run in the message choosing of a bride
[1:39:02] brother branches flee to him don't let
[1:39:05] the devil ever cool you off from this
[1:39:09] stay right with it until your everyone
[1:39:13] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:39:16] now it's not a period it's a comma
[1:39:20] because I want us to get this part for
[1:39:22] those of us
[1:39:23] that have the Holy Ghost
[1:39:25] in so much
[1:39:27] that will make you come to this word
[1:39:31] that will make you women straighten up
[1:39:34] and will make you men straighten up if
[1:39:37] you say you've got the Holy Ghost and
[1:39:40] won't cope with the word it's another
[1:39:42] Spirit In You
[1:39:45] God's spirit is on his word
[1:39:48] the Messiah the anointed word the bride
[1:39:53] now listen to this the bride must be a
[1:39:57] messiah
[1:39:59] the anointed word he said we must become
[1:40:02] the word
[1:40:03] the only way we'll become the word we've
[1:40:05] got to get serious about our walk with
[1:40:08] him and start laying things aside that
[1:40:10] we we don't think is important they are
[1:40:13] important
[1:40:17] now we're
[1:40:19] compassed with so great a cloud of
[1:40:21] witnesses the Bible says
[1:40:24] there's been saints that have gone on
[1:40:26] salt asunder
[1:40:29] they've stood the test they went through
[1:40:31] the Lion's Den they've they've been uh
[1:40:34] to the uh the the belly of the whale
[1:40:38] as it were
[1:40:40] they've they've stood the test that God
[1:40:44] gave them and yes this age is harder
[1:40:47] than those
[1:40:49] it's a harder time we're living in
[1:40:52] because of this lukewarm spirit this you
[1:40:55] can do whatever you want to do it
[1:40:56] doesn't matter because we have to
[1:40:58] actually deny that our flesh hungers for
[1:41:01] that
[1:41:02] and we have to deny that
[1:41:04] but we are compassed with so great a
[1:41:07] cloud of witnesses are looking on
[1:41:11] and we've seen them go on so now we are
[1:41:13] encouraged to lay aside the things
[1:41:17] the weights that get in their way that
[1:41:20] are holding us down
[1:41:22] I don't know if
[1:41:25] if any of you ever done this but
[1:41:28] I used to play hockey and be when I
[1:41:30] would get ready I would wear weights on
[1:41:32] my legs
[1:41:33] heavy weights and I'd walk and I'd go
[1:41:35] through school and I'd walk and I'd run
[1:41:38] and I'd Jog and I'd have all this weight
[1:41:41] and then when those weights fell off man
[1:41:43] I could just fly
[1:41:45] and that's what happens when you get rid
[1:41:47] of sin
[1:41:49] when you get rid of unbelief you just
[1:41:51] free your light is a feather you can you
