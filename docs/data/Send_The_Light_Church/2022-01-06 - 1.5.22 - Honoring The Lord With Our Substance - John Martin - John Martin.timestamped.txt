[30:48] amen let's go to the lord in prayer
[30:51] father with that song in our heart

[31:09] presence being here

[31:26] our thoughts and our heart and
[31:28] lord

[31:45] the god that you are we just commit
[31:48] ourselves to you we pray that you close
[31:50] our mouth from saying anything that
[31:51] would be wrong
[31:53] lord even in the slightest way but lord

[31:58] true
[31:59] may they be fruitful may they be helpful
[32:01] for our church as we grow lord we commit
[32:04] the service in you your hands now ask
[32:06] your blessings and the reading of the
[32:07] word in jesus precious name we pray amen
[32:11] amen turn with me if you would to the
[32:13] book of proverbs chapter 3.
[32:17] how many like proverbs chapter 3
[32:22] a very very familiar set of scriptures
[32:31] we're going to read verses 1 through 12
[32:33] and then we'll have you be seated
[32:36] the bible says my son
[32:38] forget not my law
[32:40] but let thy heart keep my commandments
[32:43] for length of days and long life and
[32:46] peace shall they add to thee
[32:49] let not mercy in truth forsake thee
[32:52] bind them upon thy
[32:54] neck and write them upon the table thine
[32:56] heart
[32:57] and so shall thou
[32:59] find favor and good understanding
[33:02] in the sight of god
[33:04] and man
[33:05] trust in the lord with all that heart
[33:08] and lean not
[33:10] unto thy own understanding how hard it
[33:12] is to do this
[33:14] in all thy ways acknowledge him and he
[33:16] shall direct thy paths
[33:18] be not wise in your own eyes
[33:20] but fear the lord and depart from evil
[33:23] it shall be held to thy navel and marrow
[33:26] to thy bones
[33:28] unto the lord with thy substance
[33:30] with the first fruits of all thine
[33:32] increase
[33:33] so shall thy barns be filled with plenty
[33:35] and thy presses shall burst
[33:37] out with new wine
[33:40] my son despise not the chasing of the
[33:42] lord
[33:43] neither be weary
[33:44] of his
[33:45] correction
[33:46] god bless you may be seated
[33:50] for whom the lord loveth he
[33:52] corrected even as the father the son in
[33:55] whom he delighteth
[33:58] we want to take our
[34:00] text from
[34:02] verse number nine
[34:03] honor the lord with thy substance
[34:06] and with the first fruits of all thy
[34:09] increase
[34:10] i want to title this message honoring
[34:12] the lord with our substance
[34:15] and for a subject
[34:16] our monetary offering obligations
[34:21] we're going to be talking about money
[34:23] and cash
[34:24] today
[34:27] some believers want to come to church
[34:29] and honor the lord with praises
[34:32] with amens
[34:34] but we're supposed to honor the lord
[34:37] also with the first fruits of all our
[34:40] substance
[34:42] that's what happens from the course of
[34:44] the week
[34:45] uh whatever has been increased to you we
[34:49] need to honor the lord with the first
[34:51] fruit of it
[34:54] how many pays
[34:56] ties
[34:57] faithfully
[34:59] faithfully
[35:01] all right
[35:02] from you
[35:03] i need
[35:05] amens
[35:06] because this is not
[35:08] an enjoyable subject we haven't talked
[35:10] on
[35:11] ties and offerings for about two years
[35:15] but it's scriptural and needful
[35:19] and
[35:20] it helps pay the bills
[35:25] god loves a cheerful giver
[35:27] that's a giver who gives from his heart
[35:30] with joyful intentions
[35:33] the bible says we ought to bring an
[35:36] offering of praise when we come to
[35:38] church
[35:40] psalms 35 18 says i will give thanks
[35:43] in the great congregation i will praise
[35:46] thee among much people
[35:49] by him hebrews 13 15 says by him
[35:52] therefore let us offer the sacrifice of
[35:55] praise to god continually that is the
[35:58] fruit of our lips
[35:59] giving thanks to his name so sometimes
[36:02] we can say amen and then sometimes we
[36:04] can say thank you lord for the lord
[36:07] praise you for that word we need that
[36:09] word lord amen
[36:12] coming to church without this offering
[36:15] would make our personal
[36:17] experience
[36:19] our personal ex spiritual experience
[36:23] come short of it what it's intended to
[36:26] be
[36:28] why because god inhabits the praises of
[36:31] his people
[36:32] we should never come to church without
[36:34] praise offerings
[36:37] he's done so much for us
[36:39] we need to enter his gates with
[36:41] thanksgiving his courts with what a big
[36:43] praise a big praise offering why he he
[36:47] saved our soul
[36:48] from eternal separation
[36:51] he delivered us from so many bad habits
[36:54] and evil things
[36:55] he literally saved us from ourselves
[36:59] he brought healings to our bodies so
[37:01] many times
[37:03] and just because we got sick again it
[37:04] doesn't mean he's still worthy to praise
[37:07] it for all the times he did heal us
[37:10] he's watched over us and he's kept us
[37:12] till this day
[37:14] coming here in our walk with the lord
[37:16] he has led us by the holy spirit and
[37:18] brought us into all truth and i i really
[37:21] love the the
[37:23] the revelation from last service
[37:30] the holy spirit is sent
[37:33] for our soul to come into god's nature
[37:36] that's the truth jesus said i am the way
[37:38] the truth and the life and the holy
[37:40] spirit is set to lead us and guide us
[37:42] into all truth well what is that truth
[37:44] that's the nature of god
[37:46] we're to be like him when he comes
[37:50] we
[37:50] can make god in the holy spirit
[37:54] for only certain things and we need to
[37:57] make them for the intention
[37:59] was to come and live in the church and
[38:01] to set it in order for the coming of the
[38:03] lord
[38:06] our heart should always be filled with
[38:07] praises when we enter the storehouse
[38:10] this is the storehouse
[38:12] it has done so much for us
[38:14] we should never come to church without
[38:15] praise
[38:16] offerings what else
[38:18] should we bring into god's house
[38:22] that was a question
[38:25] offerings of prayer
[38:28] and intercessions
[38:30] jesus says jesus said my house shall be
[38:32] called a house of prayer
[38:34] we need to bring prayers into the
[38:36] sanctuary
[38:37] [Music]
[38:39] what else should we bring into god's
[38:40] house
[38:41] monetary offerings as well
[38:46] brother ram said no service is complete
[38:49] without it
[38:50] so i'll say for you if you don't give an
[38:52] offering service is not you haven't made
[38:54] the service complete
[38:57] now this is going to be a teaching
[39:01] and this i'm speaking
[39:03] to everybody that's live streaming
[39:07] i am
[39:08] don't think because we're not here we
[39:10] don't got to worry about it this is
[39:11] something i want to plague you every
[39:13] service
[39:16] because we have an obligation
[39:19] that's the only reason
[39:20] we have an obligation
[39:25] the first monetary
[39:27] offering i want to talk about
[39:29] is what takes care
[39:31] of the needs of our church
[39:33] this is this is important one we haven't
[39:35] done this since we moved in
[39:37] i mean we just moved into church and
[39:39] presto were here and nothing said about
[39:41] it
[39:42] well i wanted us
[39:44] to just be home enjoy but it's time to
[39:48] get down to the nitty-gritty and talk
[39:50] about things
[39:53] now every one of us has monthly payments
[39:56] that need to be paid in our personal
[39:58] lives
[39:59] in order to live where we live
[40:01] to drive the car we drive to do the
[40:03] things that we do
[40:05] you don't you don't pay your electric
[40:07] bill it won't stay on forever
[40:11] now
[40:12] if you don't have that going
[40:16] that means you're a bum
[40:17] and you're soaking off of somebody else
[40:20] and if you're going to be a bum brother
[40:22] brandon said be the best bum you can so
[40:24] i'll just say here
[40:25] to you feel that way just bum as much as
[40:28] you want here
[40:30] you're welcome to be a bum
[40:33] but i want to ask you a question do you
[40:34] consider this church to be your home
[40:37] church i'm speaking to everybody the
[40:39] live stream
[40:41] answer the question from the from the
[40:43] bottom of your heart when someone asks
[40:45] you what church do you go to do you say
[40:48] i go to that send the light church there
[40:49] in fenton
[40:51] oh yeah our pastor his name is john
[40:53] martin is that what you feel
[40:58] so if we're identified with this church
[41:01] that we need to be
[41:03] identified with taking care of the
[41:05] church
[41:09] don't just be identified with the
[41:11] benefits of the church we need to be
[41:13] identified with the responsibilities of
[41:15] the church
[41:18] so i would like to put something up on
[41:20] the board right now it's maybe something
[41:21] that
[41:22] some of us have wanted to look at
[41:25] these are church expenses
[41:31] does that look like that's too much rent
[41:35] there's somebody that's paying attention
[41:37] how about anybody else
[41:42] got some more that's paying attention
[41:49] i just want to say this once and i never
[41:50] want it set again there's four over 485
[41:54] 000 that was put in here before we had
[41:56] our first service
[41:58] try getting a mortgage
[42:01] for that
[42:05] it's a very fair price
[42:10] and
[42:12] the church hasn't paid you know anything
[42:14] we need to
[42:15] make this
[42:17] a part
[42:18] of our
[42:20] our expense
[42:22] we have insurance that we have to pay
[42:23] these are monthly expenses
[42:26] our electrical
[42:27] our internet our heating and cooling
[42:30] sometimes we got like now lots of
[42:32] protein sometimes we're going to have uh
[42:35] the acs going
[42:38] now that doesn't include a lot of the
[42:43] the extras that we've had to do but
[42:45] we've got the snow in the grass
[42:48] the cleaning
[42:50] uh supplies the operating system it's
[42:52] quite
[42:54] uh low
[42:56] it's quite low to be honest with you
[42:59] um but we've got just over three
[43:01] thousand we divided by eight services
[43:03] and we have 385 dollars that we need in
[43:07] church offerings to pay for what we
[43:09] enjoy
[43:11] now this is just facts we may not want
[43:13] to look at it may not want to deal with
[43:15] it may think it's not fair may think
[43:17] this is not encouraging
[43:19] this is not what i've come for but these
[43:21] are
[43:24] facts somehow we
[43:27] have got to take responsibility for
[43:29] these expenses
[43:33] you may not like the responsibility of
[43:35] your personal bills but you still have
[43:36] to pay them
[43:37] no different than here
[43:42] we need to care enough about this 385
[43:45] now listen even if you don't come to
[43:46] service
[43:47] if this is your home church you need to
[43:49] have a burden care about that offering
[43:51] even if you're not here
[43:53] because it still has to be paid whether
[43:54] you're here or not
[44:01] i say we need to take a personal
[44:04] spiritual
[44:05] ownership
[44:08] because it's our church
[44:11] it's our church
[44:13] unless you're a visitor
[44:16] and you're just going to visit forever
[44:19] [Laughter]
[44:23] we don't want to be a bum and we don't
[44:24] want to bum along
[44:27] someone has cared enough for us to have
[44:29] this
[44:30] let's ask the question do we care enough
[44:32] to maintain the bills
[44:34] that's it do we care enough to maintain
[44:36] it
[44:38] now we can ignore the reality of these
[44:40] bills
[44:41] and we can
[44:42] put our responsibility
[44:46] on somebody else
[44:47] who's being faithful
[44:50] who's being dedicated
[44:55] but we're going to learn
[44:57] that this is going to get us on the
[44:59] wrong side of god
[45:04] i appreciate each and every one of you
[45:05] but we have a monetary
[45:07] offering obligation here
[45:10] acts of kindness and love don't pay the
[45:13] bills
[45:16] spending an hour here spending an hour
[45:18] with it don't pay the bills it helps we
[45:20] need it
[45:22] but we need the bills paid too
[45:29] you all were thinking boy i wasn't
[45:30] praying for this when i was praying for
[45:32] the service
[45:37] it's overdue
[45:39] malachi chapter 3 verse 6 turn with me
[45:41] there malachi chapter 3 verse 6.
[45:46] the bible says for i am the lord i
[45:49] change not
[45:50] that's a real important
[45:52] verse i change not
[45:54] so we don't want to think god's
[45:55] different here therefore ye sons of
[45:57] jacob are not consumed god is the same
[46:00] yesterday today and forever
[46:02] even from the days of your fathers year
[46:05] gone away from my ordinances and have
[46:07] not kept them return unto me and i will
[46:09] return until you say it the lord of
[46:11] hosts but ye said wherein shall we
[46:13] return in other words i think i'm
[46:15] already with you lord
[46:19] will a man
[46:20] rob god and get away with it
[46:25] look what they they tried to do to this
[46:27] man that had a semi and people got
[46:29] killed
[46:31] they didn't want that man to get away
[46:32] with it
[46:34] will a man rob god and get away with it
[46:37] yet ye have
[46:39] yet he have robbed me but you say what
[46:43] what are you talking about god where
[46:45] have we robbed thee
[46:47] in tithes and offerings
[46:53] robbing god is not the way to find favor
[46:57] with god
[46:59] now in order to rob somebody you have to
[47:01] take something away from them without
[47:03] their consent
[47:06] as you just you go into their car and
[47:08] you grab something that's robbing them
[47:11] in other words you manipulate the other
[47:12] person to take what doesn't belong to
[47:15] you and this is what we're doing to god
[47:17] because believe it or not our tithes and
[47:19] offerings they belong to god
[47:22] whether you think it want to accept it
[47:24] believe it not it doesn't matter what
[47:26] you think or believe it is the truth
[47:35] god is saying tithe and offering belongs
[47:37] to him
[47:39] even though we work
[47:40] for
[47:41] our money with our
[47:43] with sweat and tears or the money is
[47:45] given to us either way
[47:48] the tithes and the offerings from it
[47:50] belong to him
[47:53] jesus said give the caesars what caesars
[47:55] give to god's with god
[47:57] we let caesar take taxes out of our
[47:59] check
[48:00] or at least most of us do
[48:03] we should be willing and cheerfully take
[48:07] out the money that belongs to god and
[48:09] give it to him
[48:11] i do not want you and i'm not asking you
[48:14] to give more than what god has told you
[48:16] to give but don't say god has not told
[48:19] me to give and that's why i don't give.
[48:23] i don't believe that
[48:25] i believe that's you saying what god
[48:27] wants
[48:31] when we don't give
[48:33] tithes and offerings to god we're
[48:34] robbing them
[48:36] he views it as robbing him
[48:38] no one would want to rob god
[48:41] we come to church asking god to bless us
[48:44] lord heal us lord direct us lord prosper
[48:47] us
[48:49] lord help us
[48:51] but god says wait a minute it's not one
[48:54] way straight here
[48:57] will a man rob god
[49:00] yet you robbed me
[49:03] but you say where where we wherein where
[49:07] i'm sorry where and have we robbed thee
[49:10] a lot of people don't realize this
[49:12] but they rob god
[49:15] the same guy that they're worshiping at
[49:17] church they also rob
[49:20] think about that statement
[49:24] they worship god and they rob them
[49:27] that's how
[49:29] how the enemy can deceive us
[49:34] someone sent me this
[49:35] said if the truth makes you
[49:37] uncomfortable don't blame the truth
[49:40] blame the lie that made you comfortable
[49:43] blame the lie that made you feel
[49:44] comfortable to begin with
[49:47] a lot of people don't realize that
[49:49] they're gonna not gonna make it until
[49:51] it's too late brother branham said over
[49:53] and over that
[49:56] uh people are gonna uh think the rapture
[49:58] is still happening it's already passed
[50:00] they're gonna come to the altar thinking
[50:02] they're getting saved and you they're
[50:04] they can't get saved it's too late
[50:08] so this realization
[50:10] of truth
[50:12] is not
[50:14] selective
[50:15] right
[50:16] amen like we think it is it's not how we
[50:18] think
[50:19] we need a hunger for how god thinks
[50:23] jesus said in matthew chapter 7 verse 22
[50:26] many i say
[50:28] many will say to me in that day lord
[50:30] lord have we not prophesied in your name
[50:33] and in thy name cast out devils and in
[50:35] thy name done many wonderful works
[50:38] and then why profess to them i never
[50:40] knew you depart from me ye that work
[50:42] iniquity
[50:45] so this is the part that god puts more
[50:47] emphasis on
[50:48] is the iniquity where everybody else all
[50:51] the other believers put the emphasis on
[50:54] god
[50:55] using them or them working for god
[50:59] instead of the
[51:00] obedience because simply iniquity is
[51:03] simply not doing the right thing
[51:06] what we're talking about not robbing a
[51:08] bank it's not doing the right thing it's
[51:10] not paying ties and offerings
[51:12] it can be considered iniquity that's
[51:14] what i want to get to iniquity is
[51:16] abounding in the hour that we're living
[51:18] in
[51:19] believers are doing more and more what
[51:21] they want instead of doing what god
[51:23] commands
[51:25] i mean there's so many people that are
[51:27] stopping going to church now
[51:29] and they're using the pandemic as a
[51:32] as a way out
[51:34] but jesus said all the more as you see
[51:37] the day approaching
[51:39] but the church world is saying yeah i
[51:40] can just
[51:42] see the two spirits
[51:45] so when we work not to pay our tithes
[51:47] and offerings we're really working
[51:49] iniquity
[51:50] strong statements but it's the truth
[51:52] and second timothy chapter 2 verse 19
[51:55] says nevertheless the foundation of god
[51:57] sure having this seal the lord knows
[52:00] them that belong to him
[52:02] right the lord knoweth them that he is
[52:04] and let everyone that says i belong to
[52:06] god
[52:08] depart from
[52:11] depart from not doing the things
[52:15] that you don't want to do that you
[52:16] should be doing
[52:18] depart from that
[52:20] and believe me we all got iniquities
[52:27] he was bruised for our iniquities
[52:29] but that doesn't mean stay in them
[52:31] geez paul said depart from them
[52:36] when we refuse to pay our tithes and
[52:38] offerings don't expect things to go
[52:41] right in your lives
[52:43] if i had a dollar for every time i heard
[52:46] a complaint about finances from someone
[52:48] who didn't pay their tithes and
[52:49] offerings i'd literally be a rich man
[52:53] but you know you just don't hear
[52:54] complaining
[52:56] from faithful givers
[53:02] i mean the bible says that his seed
[53:04] would not go baking bread
[53:07] because god supplies he takes care of
[53:09] his own
[53:11] and there's a lot of people that belong
[53:13] to god that refuse
[53:15] to follow through with tithes and
[53:17] offerings
[53:18] think about it
[53:20] they think that's their money
[53:23] it's not
[53:25] will a man rob god yet you have robbed
[53:27] me but ye said when we rob thee and
[53:29] tithes and offerings verse 9 he accursed
[53:32] with a curse
[53:35] you are cursed with a curse
[53:38] for you allowed me
[53:39] even this whole nation
[53:42] but we know this nation is cursed
[53:46] the world is cursed
[53:48] it's going down
[53:50] the coming of the lord is at hand
[53:54] they just don't know it yet
[53:59] we can't just rob god and expect a
[54:02] wonderful relationship with him
[54:06] you know we put off ties and offerings
[54:08] out of our mind because basically we
[54:11] just don't get a lot of money
[54:13] it's something we don't want to deal
[54:14] with
[54:16] but you can't do that right
[54:21] we our emphasis comes so much on
[54:23] relationship relationship well if the
[54:25] relationship says we have a
[54:27] responsibility
[54:29] to keep our to keep his commandments if
[54:31] you love me keep my commandments
[54:34] it's part of the
[54:37] it relationship matter how many times
[54:39] we've used the name of jesus to cast out
[54:41] a devil
[54:42] how many times we prophesied or spoke in
[54:44] tongues or i don't care how many
[54:46] wonderful things we've done for his
[54:48] kingdom
[54:49] god is looking for obedience to what he
[54:52] says he wants us to do
[54:54] and at the end god's going to have the
[54:56] final say so he's going to call
[54:58] he's going to allow certain individuals
[55:00] to go into rapture and certain ones are
[55:02] not
[55:07] he certainly ain't going to be looking
[55:08] for any wonderful works i did
[55:11] how many devils i cast out how many
[55:13] times i used his name he's got to be
[55:14] looking for something else
[55:19] john chapter 10 verse 7 then jesus said
[55:22] unto them again verily verily i say unto
[55:24] you i am the door of the sheep so he's
[55:27] the door to the rapture
[55:30] after
[55:31] okay he said all that ever came before
[55:34] me what are they thieves and robbers
[55:38] all that ever came before me
[55:41] you know i remember when i first came to
[55:43] the lord
[55:44] i was trying to steal
[55:48] i was not being honest with god
[55:52] i told the lord that i'd serve him if
[55:54] he'd give me cheryl
[55:58] trying to rob
[56:01] steal
[56:03] you you don't make deals with god
[56:06] but then all that ever came before him
[56:13] but the sheep did not hear him i am the
[56:14] door but by me if any man enter in he
[56:18] shall be saved and shall go in and out
[56:20] find pasture the thief came not but to
[56:22] steal and to kill and destroy i am come
[56:24] that they might have life and that they
[56:26] might have it more abundantly
[56:29] i believe
[56:30] we're going to see here you rob god you
[56:32] limit your blessings
[56:35] you increase your curses
[56:38] and yet understand
[56:40] there's no switzerland with god
[56:43] there's no neutral stand with the word
[56:46] you either believe it
[56:48] or you don't
[56:50] you either obey it or you don't
[56:53] and if we choose not to god promises a
[56:56] curse of some sort in our life
[56:59] does it really get into what the curse
[57:02] is
[57:04] but
[57:05] to me
[57:07] i want to stay away from all of them
[57:11] but if we choose to obey god's word god
[57:13] promises more blessings than we can
[57:16] handle we won't even better handle them
[57:21] and notice there's nothing in between
[57:24] really cursed or really blessed
[57:26] there's nothing in between amen
[57:31] verse 10
[57:32] bring ye all the ties
[57:35] into the storehouse
[57:38] that there may be meat
[57:40] in my house
[57:42] your money has something to do with the
[57:44] revelation that god wants to give you
[57:47] i'm not saying god ain't going to give
[57:49] you a revelation
[57:51] without
[57:52] an offering i'm not saying that but
[57:54] you're only going to go so far
[57:57] you're only going to go so far
[58:00] bringing all your ties and destroys that
[58:02] there may be meat in my house and prove
[58:05] me now we're with saith the lord of
[58:06] hosts if i will not open the windows of
[58:10] heaven and pour out a blessing that
[58:13] there shall not be room enough to
[58:15] receive it
[58:21] the ties are to come
[58:24] into the storehouse
[58:26] god's storehouse
[58:29] this is a very special place here
[58:32] this is god's place
[58:36] we don't
[58:37] take our tithes
[58:38] and give them to the salvation army
[58:43] we don't give them to the widow woman
[58:46] we don't give them to the family who's
[58:48] out of money
[58:50] that our tithes don't go there
[58:53] if the bible said we could then i would
[58:55] say amen to that way of thinking
[59:00] there's a reason we don't
[59:01] we want to give our money in other
[59:03] places and think it's a
[59:05] god told me and and this is where i'm
[59:07] putting my tithes there's a reason for
[59:10] that we'll get into that
[59:12] but the bible says bringing all your
[59:14] ties into the storehouse why that there
[59:16] may be meat in my house tithe for meat
[59:23] ties for meat
[59:26] ties obedience for revelation
[59:29] how you want to slice it
[59:33] he didn't say
[59:34] so the bills could be met
[59:38] offerings are for the bills
[59:41] come on
[59:42] tithes are for the ministry
[59:46] your tithes go to whoever
[59:50] your pastor
[59:51] is
[59:54] wherever your spiritual meat comes from
[59:57] that's where your ties go
[1:00:02] there are many curses
[1:00:04] but to me
[1:00:07] the greatest is god keeping
[1:00:09] our heart from seeing
[1:00:12] him that veil just can't see him clearly
[1:00:15] just can't get the victory just can't
[1:00:18] that that to me is the greatest curse
[1:00:21] to me what is hell it's eternal
[1:00:22] separation from god
[1:00:25] what are we trying to get closer to god
[1:00:27] if we could focus on how do i get more
[1:00:29] of god rather than i have so much of god
[1:00:31] look at me
[1:00:33] come on
[1:00:34] we're on the same boat trying to get
[1:00:36] more of god
[1:00:38] who cares if you got more than me we
[1:00:40] just both need more
[1:00:44] he said
[1:00:47] um god wants us to prove him
[1:00:50] prove me
[1:00:51] now
[1:00:53] herewith saith the lord of hosts if i
[1:00:55] will not open the windows of heaven and
[1:00:57] pour you out of blessing that you should
[1:01:00] not have room enough to receive it
[1:01:02] remember when we were younger
[1:01:05] we always used to say prove it prove it
[1:01:08] when we were in school prove it
[1:01:11] god wants us to prove him
[1:01:15] god wants us to prove him he has no
[1:01:17] problem why because he's got the goods
[1:01:20] he's got the blessings he can pour them
[1:01:22] out
[1:01:24] can you imagine getting to a place whoa
[1:01:26] lord that's too much i got too much joy
[1:01:28] i got too much love i love my guy that's
[1:01:31] too much
[1:01:35] i had so much money i don't know what to
[1:01:36] do with it
[1:01:43] he wants us to prove
[1:01:45] he'll follow through if we do our part
[1:01:49] most people are scared to pay their
[1:01:51] tithes
[1:01:56] they're going to pay their tithes if
[1:01:58] they get all their bills done
[1:01:59] and they go like two weeks and that's it
[1:02:03] they don't know how to not lean to their
[1:02:05] own understanding and lead to the word
[1:02:08] they gotta be in control but this is
[1:02:10] this whole this whole walk is god's in
[1:02:13] control
[1:02:14] psalms 37 verse 25 i have been young and
[1:02:17] now i'm old yet i have not seen the
[1:02:19] righteous forsaken nor a seed begging
[1:02:21] bread he is ever merciful and what does
[1:02:24] he do he lendeth and his seed is blessed
[1:02:29] wouldn't you rather be a lender
[1:02:31] than a
[1:02:32] bower come on
[1:02:35] god can make you a lender
[1:02:41] i never want to be in a spot honestly
[1:02:45] that i have to ask
[1:02:48] and if my my god
[1:02:51] owns everything
[1:02:54] i think he's quite capable of taking
[1:02:55] care of me
[1:02:58] now it's different when you just come to
[1:03:00] christ
[1:03:02] it's different because you don't know
[1:03:04] god in that measure and he doesn't
[1:03:05] expect that
[1:03:09] but when you're told
[1:03:11] he's
[1:03:12] he is my everything
[1:03:16] [Music]
[1:03:17] we need to start believing it
[1:03:20] and we need to start believing that he
[1:03:22] is the one that will supply our needs
[1:03:24] now we just can't sit home don't work
[1:03:27] don't do anything and expect god to
[1:03:29] bless us and meet all of our needs
[1:03:31] the bible says if a man don't work he
[1:03:33] shouldn't eat
[1:03:35] there is a part that we have to play
[1:03:39] and we're talking about the part that
[1:03:40] needs to be played here at the church
[1:03:49] did you ever ask yourself the question
[1:03:51] does god really need my money
[1:03:54] come on
[1:03:56] i see my money he owns everything
[1:04:01] heaven is just thrown earth's his
[1:04:03] footstool
[1:04:05] what will you build me what house will
[1:04:07] you build me he created the heavens and
[1:04:10] the earth so what does god need with my
[1:04:12] money
[1:04:13] come on we've all
[1:04:16] had thoughts like these
[1:04:19] mainly
[1:04:20] those that that don't give now i
[1:04:21] understand that there's givers here
[1:04:24] and god bless you for giving
[1:04:31] but i think god wants us to do more
[1:04:32] giving
[1:04:36] god has an expectation
[1:04:38] of us and that's our first fruits
[1:04:41] to give the first fruits
[1:04:43] he don't care how many guns we buy
[1:04:47] how many fishing poles we buy
[1:04:49] but he expects first fruits from every
[1:04:52] one of us
[1:04:54] the first
[1:04:55] part
[1:04:57] that belongs to him what you do you want
[1:04:59] to buy four wheels you you want to buy
[1:05:01] an extra house you want doesn't matter
[1:05:03] first fruits go to god
[1:05:08] it's
[1:05:08] it is clearly seen in the scripture seek
[1:05:10] ye first the kingdom and then all the
[1:05:13] things shall be added to you
[1:05:15] and you shall seek me and find me when
[1:05:16] you search for me with all your heart
[1:05:19] god wants proof from our lives not just
[1:05:22] our lips that we're putting him first
[1:05:25] not second
[1:05:27] not third but first
[1:05:29] honor the lord with thy substance and
[1:05:32] with the first fruits of all thine
[1:05:37] increase
[1:05:40] so shall thy barns be filled with plenty
[1:05:44] and thy presses shall burst out with new
[1:05:47] wine
[1:05:50] we don't want to envy people that god is
[1:05:52] blessed
[1:05:55] don't disagree
[1:05:57] with god's choices
[1:05:59] if god chooses to bless somebody praise
[1:06:02] god
[1:06:04] amen
[1:06:06] just learn to give like they give
[1:06:10] learn to obey the word like they obey
[1:06:12] the word
[1:06:14] learn to give like they give
[1:06:18] brother bam taught us if we do the very
[1:06:21] same thing that somebody else did god is
[1:06:23] obligated
[1:06:25] he's obligated he will bless us
[1:06:29] he's not going to let us suffer
[1:06:32] right
[1:06:35] i think a lot of our suffering is really
[1:06:36] a curse
[1:06:39] it's just in a mild format we don't
[1:06:40] really really realize it
[1:06:42] right
[1:06:43] i i think i can say these things i i
[1:06:46] don't i you know me
[1:06:48] anybody that knows me knows
[1:06:51] i don't beg for money i don't ask for
[1:06:52] money i don't tell you need to be given
[1:06:54] money
[1:06:55] why would i go two years i'm probably
[1:06:57] the only church that goes as long as we
[1:06:58] do without talking about this stuff
[1:07:01] seriously
[1:07:03] we don't pass the plate
[1:07:07] brother johnson really wanted to come
[1:07:08] tonight
[1:07:10] called want to come oh he just loves the
[1:07:12] church loves the spirit wanted to come
[1:07:14] he said well brother johnson we're we're
[1:07:16] just going to be talking about tithes
[1:07:17] and offerings okay well come on another
[1:07:18] i want to hear you preach he said
[1:07:24] it just is what it is
[1:07:28] despite the fact that god doesn't need
[1:07:30] our money
[1:07:32] his program on earth does
[1:07:36] and he has a definite expectation from
[1:07:38] us what belongs to him
[1:07:41] and that is the first fruits of all our
[1:07:43] increase
[1:07:45] god doesn't want the leftovers
[1:07:48] can you imagine going into a restaurant
[1:07:50] and they say well this is all i got i
[1:07:51] got the leftovers
[1:07:54] we would not eat there and god doesn't
[1:07:57] want someone's leftovers
[1:08:00] you you earn a hundred dollars that week
[1:08:03] you
[1:08:04] he expects 10 bucks in that in the back
[1:08:07] you give them a buck 85 or three bucks
[1:08:10] that's leftovers
[1:08:15] don't call it ties
[1:08:17] ties is not
[1:08:19] part you're still robbing god
[1:08:27] when you give your leftovers you may
[1:08:29] think
[1:08:32] you're giving
[1:08:34] god decision offerings but you're
[1:08:36] not right you're given your
[1:08:40] interpretation or your definition
[1:08:42] of what tithing offerings is
[1:08:47] we should give to the needs of our
[1:08:49] church
[1:08:50] it's your church you're part of the
[1:08:52] church
[1:08:53] every service is part of god's program
[1:08:57] like i said before even the services
[1:08:59] that were not here
[1:09:02] you know
[1:09:03] if if you don't not care about the
[1:09:06] church when you're not here i question
[1:09:08] where your heart is at
[1:09:18] the needs of the church are there
[1:09:19] whether we're there or not
[1:09:21] i don't know how many times if i had a
[1:09:23] five bucks for every time brother marty
[1:09:25] says would you not worry about the
[1:09:26] church and just go and enjoy your time
[1:09:30] with your wife he'd say that to me every
[1:09:32] time we went away over the years
[1:09:34] it is
[1:09:35] i can't comment just okay
[1:09:37] leaving it all here you you carry it
[1:09:41] and if you really really care about
[1:09:44] the expenses of the church
[1:09:46] you don't just
[1:09:50] don't think about it because it bothers
[1:09:51] you
[1:09:53] you pray
[1:09:55] you know we
[1:09:56] i've asked the song leaders to come up
[1:09:58] here
[1:09:59] and let's get serious about reminding
[1:10:00] the people about the needs of the church
[1:10:04] but now you know the needs of the church
[1:10:07] we need to pray with sincerity we need
[1:10:09] to give money when we come to churches
[1:10:11] it's our our obligation to god
[1:10:16] what more do we need
[1:10:18] i need more money to do it no you need
[1:10:20] more faith in the word to do it
[1:10:22] that's right
[1:10:24] what would you do with more money
[1:10:31] god loves the cheerful giver
[1:10:35] the church church offerings are taken up
[1:10:37] so we can function as a church
[1:10:40] so jesus comes
[1:10:42] we're just going to be paying these same
[1:10:43] bills and
[1:10:45] if we all decided hey we're not going to
[1:10:46] have church here we can just close it up
[1:10:48] we won't have to pay the electric
[1:10:49] anymore return off the gas and you know
[1:10:51] that'd be it
[1:10:52] but until jesus comes we're going to
[1:10:54] have to be fighting the snow how many
[1:10:56] enjoys having a warm church when it's
[1:10:58] freezing out there
[1:10:59] but somebody's got to pay for that
[1:11:09] every service we need to be aware
[1:11:11] conscious sincerely caring prayerful and
[1:11:14] joyful about giving
[1:11:17] don't give unless you want to keep your
[1:11:20] money
[1:11:21] i say keep your money if you don't want
[1:11:23] to give joyfully
[1:11:26] i feel glad that i've never ever had to
[1:11:29] ask somebody for something
[1:11:31] or feel manipulated to give somebody to
[1:11:33] give
[1:11:34] i've never taken a set don't plan on
[1:11:36] doing it by the grace of god
[1:11:39] but it's the will of god to do it
[1:11:44] we don't want to block it out of our
[1:11:45] mind we don't want to skip over we don't
[1:11:47] want to just hurry with the prayer
[1:11:49] we want to say god we need your help
[1:11:51] here because we don't have 385 dollars
[1:11:54] coming in that box every service
[1:11:57] we don't right
[1:11:59] but we need it
[1:12:04] well brother john i know what you're
[1:12:05] asking me i'm asking you to get serious
[1:12:07] about giving that's all that's all i'm
[1:12:10] asking
[1:12:11] god will take care of it
[1:12:14] but if we don't do our part that we
[1:12:16] either block it out with somebody else
[1:12:17] is doing it you know brother john he'll
[1:12:19] take care of it
[1:12:21] come on that that thought has been so
[1:12:23] real
[1:12:26] because of the faithfulness
[1:12:31] that's god's goodness it is grace to us
[1:12:33] but god wants us to grow up and we're go
[1:12:37] we're going to have more people coming
[1:12:39] and they got to be taught
[1:12:43] what's going to happen when i leave
[1:12:46] what's going to happen when i'm gone
[1:12:48] well i'll just step up and i'll preach
[1:12:49] brother john well that's good for you
[1:12:51] who's going to pay for it
[1:12:55] so it's not just being able to preach
[1:12:57] the word we've got to live the word
[1:13:00] there's more to it than just
[1:13:02] up here
[1:13:07] now we also have
[1:13:09] other offerings
[1:13:11] besides the church offerings and this is
[1:13:14] visiting ministers
[1:13:18] and this is not
[1:13:19] my visiting minister this is your
[1:13:20] visiting minister
[1:13:23] you want visiting ministers you want
[1:13:26] somebody besides that old brother john
[1:13:31] mixed up with somebody's got to pay for
[1:13:33] that man
[1:13:35] now remember when we have a visiting
[1:13:37] minister he gets an offering because
[1:13:40] jesus said the labor is worthy of his
[1:13:43] hire
[1:13:44] so he's got to get paid
[1:13:46] he's got also got travel expenses
[1:13:50] and and so i'll be honest with you some
[1:13:52] of these brother daryl a number of these
[1:13:54] brothers that we've had won't sleep in a
[1:13:56] home you got to give them a hotel you
[1:13:58] got to pay for their hotel their their
[1:14:00] planes
[1:14:02] easy easy spend two grand on heaven
[1:14:04] brother a brother here
[1:14:07] easy
[1:14:08] but we still got that 385 that has to be
[1:14:12] paid for the church at that same time so
[1:14:14] when you want a visiting minister
[1:14:16] it's even costing us more not the same
[1:14:22] it you know when you come to church you
[1:14:24] need to bring more than a praise
[1:14:26] offering more than a prayer offering
[1:14:30] more than thanksgiving you need to show
[1:14:32] it in that box
[1:14:36] now we're all thankful that we don't
[1:14:37] have to pass a plate
[1:14:39] and constantly be looked at by everybody
[1:14:41] else to make sure we put something in
[1:14:45] let's take it a step further and show
[1:14:46] god how much we really appreciate now
[1:14:48] that we know what's going on here
[1:15:02] there's church expenses
[1:15:04] visiting minister expenses
[1:15:06] and then there's missionary expenses
[1:15:10] that's another expense can you believe
[1:15:12] that
[1:15:14] when we come to church we usually don't
[1:15:16] see the missionaries we don't think
[1:15:18] about it we we hear as far as a request
[1:15:21] but
[1:15:22] this church
[1:15:23] believes in mission work
[1:15:28] brother branham said that every church
[1:15:30] ought to have a missionary program
[1:15:32] and it's always the will of god
[1:15:37] they're laboring for souls
[1:15:40] and they're in third world countries you
[1:15:42] think you don't got money
[1:15:46] you got a lot more money than they got
[1:15:54] so who's the church
[1:15:57] you are the church do you have a
[1:15:59] missionary program in your heart
[1:16:05] it takes time it takes money
[1:16:08] we must be a part of god's missionary
[1:16:10] program
[1:16:14] that's what's gathering the rest of our
[1:16:16] family together
[1:16:18] and when you give a dollar for the
[1:16:20] missionaries
[1:16:22] you're you're given a dollar to see your
[1:16:24] brother saved in heaven
[1:16:26] that's what's really happening
[1:16:28] and if you have no vision for your
[1:16:30] brother who's not saved
[1:16:32] people are going to perish so we need a
[1:16:34] vision
[1:16:35] for all these expenses
[1:16:39] these three expenses are the
[1:16:40] responsibility for every believer
[1:16:43] and literally we have to have faith
[1:16:45] for them
[1:16:48] these responsibilities are not for the
[1:16:51] rich and the well-off
[1:16:53] those who like to work extra that's not
[1:16:55] what the responsibility these
[1:16:56] responsibilities are for the believer
[1:17:03] too many people choose to believe
[1:17:05] differently rather than what the word
[1:17:07] teaches
[1:17:09] now imagine for a moment we could
[1:17:11] discuss every one of our personal
[1:17:12] situations and discover who has the most
[1:17:16] needs in our church who needs the money
[1:17:19] the most
[1:17:21] and we just take up an offering every
[1:17:24] service for the person who's got the
[1:17:25] greatest needs
[1:17:27] now that's the way a lot of people think
[1:17:29] why why people given to me why why ain't
[1:17:32] people helping me
[1:17:34] well there would be no end to that and
[1:17:36] can if we had enough money that would be
[1:17:37] wonderful
[1:17:41] but look at the need of the church
[1:17:45] what are we going to put that on back on
[1:17:46] god that's called robbing we're going to
[1:17:48] put that back on the pastor
[1:17:56] i wish we had enough money to just
[1:17:58] distribute to everybody hey in fact i'll
[1:18:00] pay you the tithes
[1:18:02] it'd be wonderful we have that kind of
[1:18:03] money coming in but we don't
[1:18:08] i believe god wants to pour out his
[1:18:10] blessings here
[1:18:12] i believe god wants to pour his
[1:18:13] blessings out upon his people
[1:18:16] but
[1:18:17] they've got to do their part
[1:18:20] tithes and offerings belong to him
[1:18:24] right amen they're to be brought into
[1:18:26] the storehouse
[1:18:32] a person who neglects their monetary
[1:18:35] church responsibility and finds more
[1:18:37] pleasure in giving to some individual
[1:18:40] isn't worthy of the church
[1:18:43] it's a strong statement i'm not saying i
[1:18:45] read it from anywhere i didn't that's
[1:18:46] just how i feel
[1:18:53] the church
[1:18:54] is not some government subsidiary
[1:18:57] it's not a social
[1:18:59] a socialist funding
[1:19:03] if you're part of the church
[1:19:05] then be a part of the responsibility to
[1:19:06] keep the bills paid that's all there is
[1:19:08] to it
[1:19:10] we're not like the secretary of state
[1:19:12] and
[1:19:13] get your driver's license to us
[1:19:16] this is where you come in you get fed
[1:19:18] you meet god you believe this is the
[1:19:20] place that god has you then be a part of
[1:19:22] the responsibility of it
[1:19:24] well brother john i i just i don't think
[1:19:26] about it very much we'll start thinking
[1:19:27] about it
[1:19:30] start carrying the burden with you
[1:19:33] bear one another's burden bear the
[1:19:35] burden of the church
[1:19:39] a churchgoer
[1:19:41] cannot only rob god of these blessings
[1:19:44] but they can easily rob
[1:19:46] god with their ties
[1:19:50] what i'm going to say here
[1:19:51] ties
[1:19:52] are the first 10
[1:19:54] of what comes into your life
[1:19:57] i don't care if the government gives it
[1:19:59] to you i don't care if some
[1:20:02] buddy gives you a a gift
[1:20:04] a 50
[1:20:06] starbucks card
[1:20:10] it's new to your life
[1:20:13] first fruits belong to god
[1:20:22] whether you work for it or it's given to
[1:20:23] you by a friend
[1:20:25] or it's from the government it just
[1:20:26] doesn't matter god views what comes into
[1:20:28] your life each week as an increase
[1:20:31] increase
[1:20:33] now you take that and give 10 to god
[1:20:37] now that's just the ties
[1:20:40] don't forget the offerings
[1:20:42] don't forget the offerings
[1:20:45] if you only had five dollars in your
[1:20:46] pocket and you spent it
[1:20:48] at tim hortons or starbucks you're left
[1:20:51] with nothing it's gone right
[1:20:54] then somebody comes along and gives you
[1:20:56] a five dollar bill
[1:20:59] because you didn't have anything
[1:21:01] or you choose to labor and wash
[1:21:04] somebody's car for five dollars either
[1:21:06] way that five dollars is in your hand
[1:21:09] and you oh god
[1:21:11] 10 percent ties and an offering out of
[1:21:14] it
[1:21:16] you don't say well i didn't work for
[1:21:18] that if i just do what i want no i'm
[1:21:20] sorry
[1:21:21] it's not it is it an increase to your
[1:21:23] life or not if it's an increase to your
[1:21:25] life then you're in god's business
[1:21:29] see we want to kick gods out of our
[1:21:31] monetary business
[1:21:34] true
[1:21:36] that's why
[1:21:37] we don't consider
[1:21:39] what we owe god
[1:21:41] we think as long as i
[1:21:42] i put two dollars in that offering plate
[1:21:45] i
[1:21:46] i cheerfully did it and
[1:21:48] everything's great
[1:21:52] how long we've been robbing god
[1:21:59] i wish everybody was here everybody's
[1:22:00] not here but this is for everybody
[1:22:02] that's listening
[1:22:04] not just for us that are here
[1:22:11] god help us to give what we owe him
[1:22:17] now the scriptures show us that ten
[1:22:19] percent
[1:22:20] which is called tithes belongs to god
[1:22:24] no one else
[1:22:26] not a man
[1:22:27] not a will woman
[1:22:29] not another need that you want to give
[1:22:31] it to
[1:22:34] just because you have a personal
[1:22:35] experience you don't take god's money
[1:22:38] and give it to them
[1:22:41] you don't you bring it into the
[1:22:42] storehouse
[1:22:44] we've got to learn to do what the bible
[1:22:46] says
[1:22:48] we don't give our tithes to whoever we
[1:22:50] want to and imagine that they're going
[1:22:52] to god
[1:22:55] i remember the prophet
[1:22:57] telling you read church order it's quite
[1:22:59] clear
[1:23:01] you don't take
[1:23:02] god's money and give it away
[1:23:07] he said there would be he spent
[1:23:10] twenty thousand he lost twenty thousand
[1:23:13] dollars
[1:23:14] by helping people
[1:23:16] who lied to him and tricked him about
[1:23:18] tires for their cars
[1:23:21] it was his own money it wasn't god's he
[1:23:23] never took god's money it was his own
[1:23:25] money
[1:23:26] and people took advantage of he was a
[1:23:28] prophet think about that
[1:23:30] but god will allow that
[1:23:33] he will allow that to pray for those
[1:23:35] that despitefully use you they'll pay
[1:23:37] for it in the end
[1:23:38] they will pay for it in the end
[1:23:42] but god's money belongs to god
[1:23:52] one hundred percent of them belong to
[1:23:54] god
[1:23:56] god wants his ties and his offerings
[1:23:58] brought into the storehouse not somebody
[1:24:00] else that you would like to give his
[1:24:02] money away to
[1:24:05] the brand says your tithes belong to the
[1:24:07] pastor
[1:24:11] the ministry that feeds you spiritually
[1:24:15] the one that's ordained to take us
[1:24:16] through
[1:24:18] now what the pastor does with that money
[1:24:22] well you know we just need to have a a
[1:24:24] separate meeting on that one
[1:24:27] but is it
[1:24:28] our business what he does with it
[1:24:32] but i can tell you what when we get on
[1:24:33] the other side you'll be so proud
[1:24:44] now every time
[1:24:46] tithe was paid in the bible it was 10
[1:24:49] and it went to the ministry
[1:24:50] they didn't substitute their tithes and
[1:24:52] offerings and give it to the poor
[1:24:56] they were two separate offerings all
[1:24:57] together
[1:25:00] now unfortunately there are thousands of
[1:25:01] ministers
[1:25:03] who have taken advantage of people's
[1:25:05] money
[1:25:07] oh okay hey we got we got got more amens
[1:25:10] on that one get the church involved
[1:25:12] [Laughter]
[1:25:15] and it isn't right
[1:25:17] they literally have robbed the people
[1:25:21] to me it's the people's own fault for
[1:25:23] being under their ministry
[1:25:26] that's a god's truth
[1:25:30] why would somebody sit under a ministry
[1:25:32] that they're being robbed
[1:25:38] tai's have gotten a bad name because of
[1:25:39] it
[1:25:42] of how many ministers have abused their
[1:25:44] office
[1:25:46] but just because there are ministers
[1:25:48] that do this it doesn't make paying ties
[1:25:51] wrong
[1:25:54] we've heard of defunding the police
[1:25:56] right
[1:25:58] can you imagine if we just take all the
[1:26:00] police out of the country
[1:26:02] oh yes that would be so much more
[1:26:05] calm and and peaceful and
[1:26:10] look what they look what happened where
[1:26:11] they did defund the priests well they
[1:26:13] did take them out
[1:26:15] look at all the chaos that went on
[1:26:21] there's all the looting robbing
[1:26:26] but just because that's going on
[1:26:30] you don't defund the police
[1:26:33] oh brother john you don't you don't
[1:26:34] understand they're they're corrupt they
[1:26:36] take bribes they steal they rob they
[1:26:39] even kill black people
[1:26:42] because it doesn't matter if you kill
[1:26:43] the white ones right
[1:26:46] just talk about
[1:26:48] but they're so bad you know we just need
[1:26:50] to defund them
[1:26:57] just because there's corruption in the
[1:26:59] police department doesn't mean we should
[1:27:01] defund them
[1:27:04] just because there's ministers and
[1:27:05] ministries that are corrupt in the
[1:27:07] church it doesn't mean we should defund
[1:27:10] god's program of paying tithes
[1:27:16] either get the man out put a god-fearing
[1:27:19] man in or find another church
[1:27:22] but stay with god's program
[1:27:26] just because there's a lot of quack
[1:27:27] doctors out there doesn't mean we
[1:27:29] shouldn't pay any
[1:27:31] doctor
[1:27:33] right
[1:27:34] we've got dentists out i won't go to
[1:27:36] that dentist
[1:27:38] fire departments ambulances you can in
[1:27:40] every profession you're going to find
[1:27:42] some quack
[1:27:44] we just don't get rid of everybody
[1:27:45] because oh we happen to have a nurse
[1:27:48] that doesn't help us
[1:27:49] that doesn't care
[1:27:51] well let's get to fund all the nurses in
[1:27:53] the world
[1:27:54] you don't do that you don't think like
[1:27:56] that
[1:27:58] but satan has got so many people to stop
[1:28:00] paying tithes because of what garbage
[1:28:02] has happened with some ministries that
[1:28:04] have taken advantage of the people
[1:28:07] instead of just getting serious with god
[1:28:10] and finding out what god wants them to
[1:28:11] do i'll just take things in my own hands
[1:28:19] we don't defund the pastors just because
[1:28:23] there's a lot of quack teachers out
[1:28:25] there
[1:28:31] there's a lot more people robbing god of
[1:28:33] their ties than there are ministries of
[1:28:34] robbing the people
[1:28:38] think about it
[1:28:42] another way that certain believers have
[1:28:43] been robbing god is paying less than ten
[1:28:46] percent
[1:28:52] when you pay nine percent you haven't
[1:28:54] paid all your ties
[1:29:00] they've been deceived into thinking that
[1:29:02] paying ties is any amount that you want
[1:29:05] to give we call that ties that is so
[1:29:08] un you need to be taught
[1:29:12] to me that's a crooked thief
[1:29:15] in my book
[1:29:18] you don't give short of what god's
[1:29:21] saying and then say you did it right
[1:29:25] then you'll come to me and they say lord
[1:29:26] lord didn't we didn't we didn't we
[1:29:28] didn't we
[1:29:29] you came short
[1:29:31] in the book
[1:29:34] when you agree on paying a certain
[1:29:36] amount with somebody
[1:29:39] don't renege
[1:29:41] ever renege
[1:29:44] you don't like it when somebody reneges
[1:29:45] with you
[1:29:46] when they make a promise you on the
[1:29:48] follow through
[1:29:50] and when you don't even if you don't say
[1:29:52] something about it it bothers you
[1:29:56] but how does god feel
[1:29:58] well nobody ever told me i'm supposed to
[1:30:00] do this i'm telling you
[1:30:03] let it forever be settled
[1:30:05] i don't care if you leave the church i
[1:30:07] don't care what happens you've heard the
[1:30:09] truth
[1:30:16] if you're paying your tithes then pay
[1:30:17] all your tithes
[1:30:19] less than 10 percent
[1:30:25] if you're only paying 8
[1:30:27] if you've only paid 8 percent
[1:30:29] then say i haven't never paid all my
[1:30:31] ties
[1:30:34] it's real easy at the end of the year
[1:30:36] you know how much you do you do your
[1:30:38] taxes or you have someone else do your
[1:30:40] taxes and you know how much money
[1:30:43] quite simple
[1:30:45] did you
[1:30:47] give ten percent of that
[1:30:49] to ties
[1:30:50] and how much of that percent did you
[1:30:53] give for offerings
[1:30:55] what about the visiting minister
[1:30:56] what about the missions right well
[1:30:58] brother john you are just asking too
[1:31:01] much i am not asking you to do a thing
[1:31:03] i'm just recording what the bible says
[1:31:06] it's a big difference
[1:31:08] you there's people in this message that
[1:31:10] say they're in the message and they
[1:31:11] don't pay tithes
[1:31:15] once a month
[1:31:17] the other three weeks
[1:31:21] if you're in the message you say you're
[1:31:23] in the message this is what the message
[1:31:24] believes
[1:31:27] if it's not come up here and tell me
[1:31:29] it's not
[1:31:30] brother ryan says okay bring your group
[1:31:32] bring your panel
[1:31:35] prove it's wrong
[1:31:38] we
[1:31:39] we
[1:31:40] we want god to bless us but we want to
[1:31:42] be it just
[1:31:45] to me
[1:31:47] i don't serve god for the blessings
[1:31:49] i don't give
[1:31:51] my tithes
[1:31:52] for the blessings
[1:31:54] to be honest with you i give so much
[1:31:56] more than my tithes it's not even funny
[1:32:02] but i don't do it for the blessings i
[1:32:04] don't even think of it i just want to
[1:32:07] help
[1:32:09] and when you give an offering
[1:32:11] it helps the church
[1:32:13] it helps the church wouldn't it be a
[1:32:15] blessing that before i leave
[1:32:18] that this church actually can function
[1:32:21] with tithes and offerings
[1:32:24] without anything extra coming in
[1:32:27] and then get to a place where you can
[1:32:29] get a surplus you can get visiting
[1:32:30] ministers in here
[1:32:34] this vision that we're holding before
[1:32:36] you
[1:32:38] it's of the lord i i know of of
[1:32:42] a couple churches
[1:32:44] after the pastor left just in
[1:32:47] shambles
[1:32:48] big churches
[1:32:54] everybody has their own ideas
[1:32:57] about how things should be right
[1:33:01] but you have to have things in order
[1:33:03] god's way in god leading it
[1:33:07] and i i believe that
[1:33:08] that god is calling us up higher
[1:33:13] if we only got seven percent
[1:33:15] of all of our increase to be paid then
[1:33:18] we haven't paid all of our tithes we
[1:33:20] still owe god
[1:33:24] now even though the new year has started
[1:33:27] don't expect god to forget
[1:33:29] what you owe them from last year
[1:33:32] i know i'm pulling some stuff out but
[1:33:34] here's the things we don't think about
[1:33:36] right
[1:33:37] just because you're not thinking about
[1:33:38] it doesn't mean
[1:33:39] god isn't the whole thing is
[1:33:42] we're in if where we robbed you lord
[1:33:44] they don't even know they're not even
[1:33:46] thinking about it but god's still
[1:33:47] staring at them you rob me
[1:33:51] so when we think about paying ties we're
[1:33:53] not thinking about what we're going to
[1:33:54] do next week let's think about what's
[1:33:55] happened in the past call it out have we
[1:33:58] been guilty of robbing god i know nobody
[1:34:01] wants wants to
[1:34:02] to deal with that but
[1:34:04] we need to
[1:34:10] god
[1:34:10] is able to make all grace abound to us
[1:34:14] he's also able to stop his grace
[1:34:17] he can bless us or he can put a curse on
[1:34:19] us
[1:34:21] he gives more grace to the humble
[1:34:23] two scriptures and we're closing
[1:34:25] proverbs 3 verse 7 let's read it be not
[1:34:27] wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and
[1:34:30] depart from evil i say just get rid of
[1:34:35] all your personal thinking
[1:34:37] fear the lord depart from that
[1:34:39] and it shall be how to the navel and
[1:34:41] marrow to thy bones honor the lord with
[1:34:44] a substance
[1:34:46] and with the first fruit
[1:34:48] of every
[1:34:50] thing that comes into your life
[1:34:58] if you don't have to work for it and
[1:35:00] it's a gift
[1:35:02] thank the lord for that but you still
[1:35:03] owe god his part
[1:35:07] and if you're faithful so shall thy
[1:35:10] barns be filled with plenty
[1:35:13] and thy presses they're just gonna burst
[1:35:15] out with new wine
[1:35:18] but we know what wine represents
[1:35:24] all right second corinthians chapter
[1:35:26] nine verse 5. we're going to end with
[1:35:28] this
[1:35:28] second corinthians chapter 9 verse 5.
[1:35:31] therefore i thought it necessary to
[1:35:34] exhort the brethren
[1:35:36] that they would be
[1:35:38] that they would go before you
[1:35:41] and make up beforehand your bounty
[1:35:45] whereof ye have
[1:35:47] had noticed before
[1:35:49] that the same might be ready as a matter
[1:35:52] of bounty
[1:35:53] not as
[1:35:54] of
[1:35:55] covetedness
[1:35:58] we're talking about
[1:36:00] giving
[1:36:02] amen
[1:36:03] but this i say
[1:36:05] he which soweth sparingly
[1:36:08] shall reap also sparingly
[1:36:12] and he that soweth bountifully
[1:36:15] shall also
[1:36:16] shall reap also bountifully
[1:36:20] what a promise
[1:36:22] every man
[1:36:23] according
[1:36:24] as he purposeth in his heart
[1:36:28] so that's why you got to think about it
[1:36:30] you just go okay always have the stand
[1:36:32] together it's just you know have a
[1:36:34] little prayer for the offering sit down
[1:36:35] what have you purposed in your heart
[1:36:39] you've got a purpose in your heart what
[1:36:41] you're going to give
[1:36:47] so let him give
[1:36:49] not grudgingly or of necessity oh i got
[1:36:52] to give because you know we got to come
[1:36:54] up with 385 every time we go to church
[1:36:58] for god loveth a cheerful
[1:37:01] giver
[1:37:07] and god is able to make all grace
[1:37:11] abound to you
[1:37:12] i just love that scripture
[1:37:15] notice where he's putting it in
[1:37:17] he's putting it in after our sacrifice
[1:37:21] god is able to make all grace abound to
[1:37:23] you that ye
[1:37:24] always having all sufficiency in all
[1:37:27] things may abound to every good work
[1:37:30] isn't that wonderful that you have
[1:37:32] sufficiency to do everything that you
[1:37:35] want to do
[1:37:36] every good word god bless you let's
[1:37:38] stand together
[1:37:40] we have a monetary offering obligation
[1:37:44] each and every time we come to church
[1:37:48] every time the doors are open
[1:37:50] we don't want to just bring our praises
[1:38:00] anyone that would see me for the first
[1:38:03] time
[1:38:05] and hear this message
[1:38:06] would question coming to this church
[1:38:12] but anybody that knows me
[1:38:14] and wouldn't come to this church
[1:38:16] afterwards
[1:38:23] is turning down god's word
[1:38:32] this is how the prophet taught it this
[1:38:33] is how a church functions
[1:38:36] and
[1:38:38] god is calling us
[1:38:39] to pay tithes
[1:38:42] faithfully every
[1:38:45] week
[1:38:46] pay your tithes
[1:38:49] and every time you come to service
[1:38:54] pay your offerings
[1:39:00] and make sure
[1:39:02] you all
[1:39:04] know how much money you made last year
[1:39:06] right
[1:39:07] or if not you're going to be coming up
[1:39:09] with it for your taxes because the
[1:39:11] government will demand you to know
[1:39:15] um
[1:39:16] you know real quick did you pay that in
[1:39:18] ties yeah and how much did you pay in
[1:39:20] offerings
[1:39:21] just just get serious about it
[1:39:24] and and don't divide your ties
[1:39:28] to two or three different places
[1:39:33] choose your home church
[1:39:35] pay your tithes
[1:39:39] make make make your decision and move
[1:39:42] forward
[1:39:46] and come come with a burden you know
[1:39:48] we all can come into the prayer room
[1:39:50] before service and at least pray god
[1:39:52] meet the needs of our church the
[1:39:54] financial needs we pray for one another
[1:39:56] we should but this is also a need just
[1:39:59] because i don't come up here and i talk
[1:40:01] about it every time doesn't mean it's
[1:40:02] not there
[1:40:04] but but we have grown up we're mature
[1:40:07] now we're we're further along and we can
[1:40:10] take on more
[1:40:17] oh yeah yeah
[1:40:20] no you say it um
[1:40:36] so if you just put cash in there you
[1:40:38] know i can't record it
[1:40:40] as anything but a miscellaneous offering
[1:40:43] so if you want a tax receipt for
[1:40:45] anything you put in there please mark
[1:40:47] the envelope
[1:40:59] we also know how much money is coming in
[1:41:06] amen
[1:41:08] yeah it
[1:41:11] to some degree we don't want to let the
[1:41:13] right hand know what the left hand is
[1:41:14] doing we don't want to be given in front
[1:41:15] of everybody we understand all that but
[1:41:17] to a degree
[1:41:21] we we should take advantage
[1:41:24] of a tax
[1:41:26] advantage from from our government
[1:41:28] i mean
[1:41:30] we should i think i feel unless you got
[1:41:32] so much money it doesn't matter
[1:41:34] and that's what
[1:41:36] cheryl's saying there's no way that
[1:41:38] she can know how much you gave if you
[1:41:39] don't let us know it's you that's
[1:41:41] giving.
[1:41:43] did you have a
[1:41:44] testimony i thought you had a testimony
[1:41:47] you wanted to share
[1:41:58] when we came to the lord many years ago
[1:42:01] we were 19. you may sit down just a
[1:42:03] moment sorry i'm sorry
[1:42:05] oh that was me so we were young
[1:42:07] and john made five dollars an hour when
[1:42:10] we got married
[1:42:12] and
[1:42:13] you know we went to church and
[1:42:16] i would just say this for myself when i
[1:42:18] heard about this message when god called
[1:42:21] me he called me by my name he called me
[1:42:23] an inaudible voice
[1:42:25] and it changed my life forever never was
[1:42:28] the same
[1:42:30] and i was determined to
[1:42:33] follow him no matter what it took and
[1:42:35] when we started going to church
[1:42:38] we heard something we were 19.
[1:42:41] we just did it
[1:42:42] i was in i was all in made a decision
[1:42:45] lord i'm this is what i want this is
[1:42:48] what i'm gonna do for the rest of my
[1:42:49] life
[1:42:50] i didn't question things you know if i
[1:42:52] have to not cut my hair if i have to we
[1:42:56] have to pay ties and we make five bucks
[1:42:58] an hour we're gonna pay ties
[1:43:00] and we did it right from the get-go
[1:43:03] and
[1:43:04] so many times through the years we've
[1:43:07] gone through
[1:43:08] some really tough financial
[1:43:11] times having a business is hard
[1:43:14] and
[1:43:15] you know i remember the one time we
[1:43:19] i didn't even know if we were going to
[1:43:20] be able to keep our business in our
[1:43:22] house things were so bad we literally
[1:43:25] were paying our employees
[1:43:27] from our credit cards and our
[1:43:30] home equity we just didn't have work it
[1:43:32] was terrible it was a terrible time
[1:43:35] and
[1:43:36] we pay our taxes twice a year our
[1:43:38] property taxes and
[1:43:40] it was coming up it was february we had
[1:43:42] to have this money by the end of
[1:43:44] february
[1:43:45] and we paid our ties faithfully through
[1:43:48] it through everything we've always paid
[1:43:49] our ties
[1:43:50] and it was i had to have this money by
[1:43:53] friday and i needed five thousand
[1:43:55] dollars five thousand and some cents
[1:43:59] and i just knew that i knew that i knew
[1:44:02] the lord was gonna somehow i was gonna
[1:44:04] get five thousand dollars before friday
[1:44:07] and we weren't even taking a paycheck
[1:44:11] and
[1:44:12] this was my prayer i said lord i don't
[1:44:15] want to pay these taxes
[1:44:17] i don't want to it's not a want it's a
[1:44:19] need and you promise to supply all of
[1:44:21] our needs
[1:44:22] and i said lord i need five thousand
[1:44:24] dollars and 25 cents or whatever it is
[1:44:27] by friday
[1:44:29] and there was just something inside of
[1:44:30] me that just knew lord is gonna he's
[1:44:32] gonna do it i don't know how but he's
[1:44:34] god and he owns everything it's all his
[1:44:38] and i think it was wednesday it was two
[1:44:40] days before i got a check in the mail
[1:44:43] from the state of michigan for five
[1:44:45] thousand dollars and something they had
[1:44:47] made a mistake
[1:44:49] and there's the money
[1:44:51] that
[1:44:53] you know it's just like
[1:44:55] he's supernatural it doesn't matter that
[1:44:57] you don't have the money to pay your
[1:45:00] tithes that doesn't matter you still pay
[1:45:02] them anyways right we took we took that
[1:45:05] 10
[1:45:07] out
[1:45:08] and then you know decided what else we
[1:45:10] could pay
[1:45:11] but you know what
[1:45:13] i i can testify today look at what the
[1:45:15] lord has given us
[1:45:16] and it's because
[1:45:19] just obeying his word it's hard it's not
[1:45:22] easy
[1:45:23] but if you obey it's like he said your
[1:45:26] barns will be overflowing our barn is
[1:45:28] overflowing today
[1:45:54] a lot of i got kicked out my house last
[1:45:56] year and
[1:45:58] i just had such peace you know that the
[1:45:59] lord's gonna provide i didn't know when
[1:46:01] apartment searching remember two years
[1:46:03] ago when brother john preached on tithes
[1:46:05] and offerings
[1:46:07] um because when i first came to the lord
[1:46:09] you know came back to the lord
[1:46:11] i thought you know you just give tithes
[1:46:13] whenever you know because i didn't know
[1:46:14] any better but when i was taught that i
[1:46:16] just like just took it and ran with it
[1:46:18] because i believed it
[1:46:20] and
[1:46:20] i can tell you paying your tithes
[1:46:23] offerings missionaries
[1:46:25] lord is going to bless you when i move
[1:46:26] into my apart before i move into my
[1:46:28] apartment
[1:46:29] i had everything i already needed i kid
[1:46:31] you not
[1:46:32] and the funny thing was i never asked
[1:46:34] for anything i would say hey i need this
[1:46:36] and that and that you know people knew i
[1:46:38] needed things i didn't have to even i
[1:46:39] didn't even tell them and i had a couch
[1:46:41] when i moved in had a dining room table
[1:46:43] when i moved in had a guest bed when i
[1:46:45] moved in had another dresser from my
[1:46:47] guest room
[1:46:49] and you know that's just the fact of the
[1:46:51] lord
[1:46:52] honors faithfulness
[1:46:54] he doesn't ask for much of you to be
[1:46:56] faithful be obedient
[1:46:59] so these ties and offerings they may
[1:47:01] seem like they're grievous but they're
[1:47:02] not
[1:47:03] it's the least we can do what the lord
[1:47:05] has done for us he literally died upon
[1:47:07] the cross for every sin that you commit
[1:47:09] from the day you were born to the day
[1:47:11] you die we go to go go to rapture
[1:47:14] so i can say from a testimony the lord
[1:47:17] will bless you your storehouse overflow
[1:47:19] like i just look at my department and i
[1:47:21] just realized how unworthy i am to have
[1:47:23] all these things it wasn't nothing that
[1:47:25] i did i just just honor what the lord
[1:47:27] said to do and i did it and he's going
[1:47:28] to bless you
[1:47:32] [Applause]
[1:47:34] can you come up here
[1:47:37] praise the lord sister kathleen
[1:47:43] and she and brother marty have been
[1:47:45] faithful
[1:47:46] faithful leaders tithes offerings from
[1:47:49] the beginning
[1:47:53] but that was the lord
[1:47:55] that gave us that revelation it's so
[1:47:58] the lord that you talked about this
[1:48:00] tonight because
[1:48:02] i talked to someone this week about the
[1:48:04] same thing
[1:48:06] and i had no idea you were going to talk
[1:48:09] about that but
[1:48:11] basically the same scriptures too you
[1:48:13] know but
[1:48:15] when i had a similar story sister cheryl
[1:48:18] said when we
[1:48:20] got baptized
[1:48:21] we literally came out of the water
[1:48:24] knowing we had to pay ties
[1:48:26] and um
[1:48:28] i was catholic we didn't pay ties and
[1:48:30] catholicism you know
[1:48:32] but when we had decided
[1:48:35] we were going to send our kids to
[1:48:36] christian school
[1:48:38] i was a stay-at-home mom
[1:48:40] we had a good size mortgage and
[1:48:43] marty had a good job thank god but our
[1:48:46] budget was
[1:48:48] tight
[1:48:49] and
[1:48:51] and then to start paying ties on top of
[1:48:53] it too
[1:48:54] but we
[1:48:55] we just made that decision just like
[1:48:57] brother john said it was the first bill
[1:49:01] that we paid
[1:49:02] always
[1:49:03] for 40 years now
[1:49:05] it's the first bill and i robbed peter
[1:49:08] to pay paul the rest of the time with
[1:49:10] whatever else
[1:49:11] we had needs of
[1:49:13] he has always provided
[1:49:15] but back in 2009 marty lost his job
[1:49:19] but gm
[1:49:21] a good job there he's had for many many
[1:49:24] years and
[1:49:25] you know our life was on track for
[1:49:28] retirement for
[1:49:30] getting our kids through college you
[1:49:32] know the whole nine yards
[1:49:34] so
[1:49:36] he just said called me at work
[1:49:39] and said i just lost my job i just got
[1:49:41] walked out the door
[1:49:43] after 38 years faithful faithful service
[1:49:47] high ratings the whole nine yards
[1:49:50] so i closed up my office and i told the
[1:49:52] girls i'm going home
[1:49:55] and then we got home and
[1:49:58] i just said well it doesn't matter we've
[1:50:00] been faithful
[1:50:02] god has been faithful
[1:50:05] and
[1:50:07] we've
[1:50:07] he's never let us down anytime
[1:50:10] so
[1:50:12] i said we got to sell the house we got
[1:50:13] to sell the house i don't care you know
[1:50:16] we'll god will take care of us
[1:50:18] so within
[1:50:20] five weeks
[1:50:22] he had the same job back through ibm you
[1:50:26] weren't even most you know he worked for
[1:50:28] gm
[1:50:29] he was on an account
[1:50:31] through the same account same people
[1:50:34] gave us the money
[1:50:36] gave us more money i mean it was just
[1:50:40] so the lord gave us better insurance
[1:50:42] but for five weeks you know we were just
[1:50:46] not knowing five weeks doesn't seem very
[1:50:48] very long but we got house payment to
[1:50:50] make and everything
[1:50:52] we didn't have our house paid for or
[1:50:54] anything you know so
[1:50:56] but you can't out give god
[1:50:58] you just cannot outgive him
[1:51:01] and we have been through
[1:51:02] many financial issues too it's not that
[1:51:06] you don't have them you will you always
[1:51:08] have them
[1:51:09] but god is faithful and he honors
[1:51:11] faithfulness
[1:51:12] regardless of what it is
[1:51:15] and like when brother john was talking
[1:51:17] about
[1:51:18] missions and special speakers
[1:51:22] and all these things
[1:51:24] you know it doesn't mean
[1:51:26] you have to pay
[1:51:28] half of the 360 dollars a month that
[1:51:31] that and we need you pay your portion
[1:51:34] everybody does their portion you know
[1:51:36] when you got more you give more
[1:51:39] you know that's just the way it is
[1:51:41] so i'm
[1:51:43] so grateful to god
[1:51:45] i was telling someone you know we have
[1:51:48] this trip coming up
[1:51:49] next week to florida which we're
[1:51:51] basically going to for
[1:51:53] to because of my health
[1:51:55] they really don't want me in the winter
[1:51:58] the worst part of the winter and so
[1:52:00] i can get away for a while that's
[1:52:02] will be safer for me
[1:52:04] there's no way we could have afforded to
[1:52:06] ghost florida for a month there's just
[1:52:09] no way
[1:52:11] you know that god
[1:52:13] probably what people would pay for a
[1:52:15] week is what
[1:52:16] we're paying for a whole month
[1:52:19] and that was just because god's been
[1:52:21] so faithful to us
[1:52:24] you know it was just it just worked out
[1:52:26] where we wouldn't be going
[1:52:28] so
