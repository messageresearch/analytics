[15:35] change of order service we just have a
[15:37] few prayer requests amen I'm glad that
[15:40] everybody came out we going pray for
[15:43] those that aren't here because of
[15:45] sickness or whatever ailments keeping
[15:47] them
[15:49] away and we have a sickness in our
[15:52] bodies sometimes they keep us away but
[15:54] we also have a sick a spiritual sickness
[15:56] that says that I don't want to yield and
[16:01] uh God wants us to yield
[16:03] amen uh let's remember the Johnson's in
[16:06] our prayers amen especially our brother
[16:09] Samuel um I believe he's uh doing a
[16:12] little bit better but uh let's just
[16:14] continue to pray for him and sister
[16:17] Norma
[16:18] amen and as as they get older as we all
[16:21] get older
[16:23] um we all need more help amen and uh
[16:29] um I don't think you can give I don't
[16:31] think you can help somebody that's older
[16:34] enough because uh as they get as we're
[16:37] babies we need our mothers and our
[16:40] fathers to take care of us and as we get
[16:42] older we need people to take care of us
[16:44] and I think sometimes we forget that
[16:47] amen well let's just let's just remember
[16:50] there not especially in our prayers amen
[16:54] but uh a kind word a kind telephone call
[16:57] whatever it all always helps
[16:59] amen uh let's uh our Tiara had a a
[17:04] request please pray for my boyfriend's
[17:06] mom she is diagnosed with cancer and has
[17:09] to go through chemo
[17:12] amen so sometimes we get requests from
[17:16] people that don't come to church very
[17:18] much but there's a reason they write
[17:19] their request down because they believe
[17:22] in the power of prayer amen and that's a
[17:26] testimony in itself that um
[17:29] you know people ask you to pray for them
[17:32] and they're looking to you and I think a
[17:34] lot of times in our life people are
[17:36] always are looking towards us and we
[17:39] acknowledge
[17:41] that you know we'll pray for you but
[17:44] God's real he's just as real for me as
[17:46] he is for them they just haven't met God
[17:48] yet maybe amen let's just continue to
[17:52] pray for that Mike's for God to protect
[17:55] a friend of mine uh serving in Israel's
[17:57] Army
[17:58] amen let's just continue to pray for
[18:01] Israel as as the months go on and the in
[18:05] the fighting I think there's more people
[18:07] coming against Israel um and uh we need
[18:11] to stand fast uh God didn't change his
[18:15] mind God don't change his mind and uh
[18:18] he'll have his way amen so let's just
[18:20] remember let's remember all the all the
[18:23] saints all over the world that uh that
[18:26] you know it's coming to an end
[18:29] or the beginning depending on how you
[18:31] look at it so um I'm just looking
[18:34] forward to Eternal eternal life in

[18:56] before God that uh God will do exploits
[19:00] in our lives if we can just only believe
[19:03] for it so let's put our faith to the
[19:06] test and in these prayers and the
[19:08] prayers that uh your silent prayers that

[34:55] and in the hearing hearing of your word
[34:58] today Father we commit the service into
[35:00] your hands pray now that you bless your
[35:03] word Lord as we look into it and we read
[35:06] it give us uh
[35:09] Revelation understanding and draw us
[35:11] closer to you we pray now in Jesus
[35:13] precious name amen amen amen well turn
[35:17] with me if you would to the book of St
[35:21] John I'm not saying that's my favorite
[35:23] book or anything St John chapter 3
[35:27] three and we're going to start at verse
[35:29] number
[35:32] 14 now we did hear uh what I would
[35:35] consider a real good Christmas message
[35:38] from Brother
[35:40] Daryl and uh and we're thankful for that
[35:44] Christmas message but we want to have
[35:46] another Christmas message if we could we
[35:49] want to en title this opening the
[35:51] father's
[35:52] gift opening the father's gift starting
[35:55] here in St John 3 verse number 14- 21
[36:01] and as Moses lifted up the serpent in
[36:03] the wilderness even so must the son of
[36:05] man be lifted up that whosoever
[36:08] believeth in him should not perish but
[36:11] have eternal life for God so loved the
[36:13] world that he gave his only begotten son
[36:17] and whosoever believeth in him should
[36:19] not perish but have everlasting life for
[36:22] God sent not his son into the world to
[36:25] condemn the world
[36:27] but that the world through him might be
[36:29] saved he that believeth on him should
[36:32] not is not condemned but he that
[36:35] believeth not is condemned already
[36:38] here's the reason because he have not
[36:40] believed in him believed in the name of
[36:43] the only begotten Son of God and this is
[36:46] the condemnation that light has come
[36:48] into the world and Men love Darkness
[36:50] rather than light because their deeds
[36:52] are evil for everyone that doeth evil
[36:56] hateth the light neither cometh to the
[36:58] light lest his deeds should be reproved
[37:01] but he that doeth truth cometh to the
[37:03] light that his deeds may be made
[37:05] manifest and that they are
[37:08] wrought that they are wrought in God
[37:11] Amen God bless the reading of his word
[37:13] may you you may take your
[37:16] seats um we want to focus on St John
[37:20] 3:16 for God so loved the world that he
[37:22] gave his only begotten son now if it had
[37:26] not been for God given his son there
[37:29] would be no nature change there'd be no
[37:31] way for us to even get to
[37:34] heaven and when man fell in the garden
[37:37] his nature
[37:39] changed and every human that's been born
[37:41] since then has been born with a satanic
[37:44] nature and that nature is simply to do
[37:47] his own
[37:48] will and God would never allow a soul or
[37:52] the spirit of a man I'll say like this a
[37:55] soul to enter into heaven with a satanic
[37:59] nature and that's why Jesus said except
[38:03] a man be born again he cannot enter the
[38:06] kingdom of God Amen and the father's
[38:09] gift was his son provided it provided a
[38:13] way for us to get a nature change now
[38:15] this is an important statement we all
[38:17] know it we all understand it but we must
[38:20] be looking for that nature
[38:23] change and not just a little
[38:28] and and the more that we can have an
[38:31] expectation like job I would not be
[38:34] satisfied until I awaken his likess
[38:37] until I see him manifested in my
[38:39] thoughts my mind my life that he's
[38:41] taking control I won't be satisfied and
[38:44] the problem is too many people get
[38:46] satisfied God did it all God only went
[38:48] to Calvary and they missed opening the
[38:52] gift that God has given
[38:55] them now God told the most subtile
[38:59] spiritual
[39:01] Beast that old serpent called the devil
[39:04] now remember there was a most subtle
[39:06] Beast that was between man and and he
[39:09] was the highest form of the animal race
[39:13] he was the closest to man he could talk
[39:16] he could walk and he was called the most
[39:19] subtle beast but there was a more
[39:22] subtile spiritual Beast that lived in
[39:25] him that used his
[39:28] body and he was the one that got this
[39:31] most uh subt Beast to
[39:35] interact and have a relationship that
[39:38] was not of his race can you say
[39:41] amen and God told that most subtle Beast
[39:45] that old serpent called the devil and
[39:48] Satan that the seed of the woman was
[39:50] going to bruise his head one day right
[39:54] amen and that this spirit spiritual
[39:56] Beast was going to prove that God was
[40:01] wrong and and when uh Cain was
[40:06] born he actually bruised the Hat of Abel
[40:09] and gashed it in and killed him he was
[40:11] going to prove that God was wrong but
[40:14] that was not the seed that God was
[40:17] speaking of he was speaking of a
[40:19] spiritual seed that was going to come
[40:22] down a and we read about it uh here in
[40:26] in in in John 3: 16 that that God gave
[40:31] his
[40:34] son um to to take away the the bruise
[40:39] the the the bruised head of sat was
[40:41] there was no way that a man uh could now
[40:46] be under the chains of a selfish satanic
[40:51] nature amen that was the bruise that God
[40:55] provided away
[40:56] that man could now be under the nature
[40:59] of the Holy Ghost now it's not just
[41:02] something you profess it is something
[41:04] that is lived out amen that the spirit
[41:07] of God is so real it lives in humans
[41:09] today amen I want to say this how did
[41:13] God bruise the head of
[41:19] Satan all right by giving
[41:23] himself I taken our place amen that's
[41:27] how he did
[41:29] it like
[41:31] Abraham said in Genesis 2218 God will
[41:35] provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[41:38] offering it was because of his great
[41:41] love wherewith he loved us it was his
[41:44] Divine love that bruised the head of
[41:48] Satan
[41:49] amen now how do we bruise Satan's
[41:55] said
[41:57] by manifesting that same love yes if if
[42:00] we don't deny ourself it's just going to
[42:02] be our love that we try to put out there
[42:05] and the only thing that's going to do is
[42:06] cause
[42:08] trouble right so I you the way to really
[42:12] get the devil out is to let the love of
[42:14] God in
[42:16] manifested Divine love is always the
[42:19] answer to victory in every
[42:21] situation Bible not the Bible but
[42:24] brother brandom said in the we got a lot
[42:26] of scriptures today we're only going to
[42:28] put a few up but we're going to be going
[42:29] through a lot the message the true
[42:32] Easter seal brother Braham said speaking
[42:34] of the prophecy that came to him God
[42:37] said this in itself is that which will
[42:40] give and make come to pass the
[42:43] tremendous victory in love divine now
[42:47] what is it that he was talking about he
[42:49] was talking about making the choice to
[42:53] go God's harder way it was that choice
[42:55] to go God's harder way that was going to
[42:58] bring to pass that tremendous victory in
[43:00] Divine Love Now what is the harder way
[43:02] it's the giving of yourself amen it's
[43:06] living for
[43:07] others that that that's what brother
[43:09] brandham taught us what the Holy Ghost
[43:10] was was living for others it takes the
[43:13] Divine love of God to give ourselves and
[43:16] to live for others we can't do it
[43:19] ourselves so it's a choice that every
[43:21] one of us make individually we don't
[43:23] make it as a
[43:25] family
[43:27] look at the people in your family those
[43:28] that made the choice and those that
[43:30] didn't it's an individual
[43:33] choice but when you make the choice it
[43:36] will make come to pass that tremendous
[43:40] Victory is giving yourself for God so
[43:44] loved the world that he gave his only
[43:48] begotten son right did you know the Son
[43:51] of God was born to
[43:54] die he was was born to die it it was
[43:59] that one act of divine love that one act
[44:02] of
[44:03] unselfish giving that brought a
[44:05] tremendous Victory to save the whole
[44:08] world Isaiah 9:6 I just you all know
[44:11] this you don't turn therefore unto us a
[44:13] child is born a son is given and the
[44:16] government shall be upon his shoulder
[44:17] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[44:19] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[44:22] father and the Prince of Peace amen God
[44:26] the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us
[44:31] amen Isaiah also says therefore the Lord
[44:34] himself shall give you a sign Behold a
[44:36] virgin shall conceive and bear a son his
[44:38] name Shall be Called Emmanuel which is
[44:41] God With Us right that was God giving
[44:46] his
[44:49] son we all know these scriptures we've
[44:52] read them many times in our Christmas
[44:54] message in Luke Chapter 2 and the Angels
[44:56] said unto them fear not for behold I
[45:00] bring you good tidings of great joy
[45:02] which shall be to all people for unto
[45:06] you is Born This Day in the city of
[45:08] David a savior which is Christ the lord
[45:13] and suddenly there was with the angel a
[45:16] multitude of heavenly losts praising God
[45:19] and saying glory to God in the highest
[45:22] and on Earth peace Good Will toward all
[45:24] men now notice this is the motive that
[45:27] God had for sending his son was to save
[45:30] the world to help the world to to bring
[45:33] Good Tidings to to all men
[45:36] amen but all men didn't want it did
[45:40] they because they loved their own will
[45:44] above God's right they love Darkness
[45:47] rather than walking in the light of
[45:49] God for God so loved the world that he
[45:53] gave his only begotten son
[45:57] but he was born to
[46:00] die when Jesus stood before Pilate he
[46:03] said in John 18:37 to this end was I
[46:07] born and for this cause came I into the
[46:10] world that I should bear witness of the
[46:13] truth and everyone that is of Truth
[46:16] hears my
[46:18] voice and the truth is is that God
[46:24] loves God God loves so much that he gave
[46:28] himself provided a way for the spirit of
[46:32] God to come back and live inside of us
[46:35] and the question to every human being
[46:37] after God does this act is do we love
[46:40] him enough to let his nature come and
[46:43] live inside of us because it's a choice
[46:46] it's a choice now you you go to the bank
[46:49] you get money you go in a car wash you
[46:50] get a car wash you go to the restaurant
[46:52] you get food you you come to the church
[46:54] you hear the word of God but it takes a
[46:56] lot more to get the Holy Ghost inside of
[46:58] you than just coming to
[47:00] church because you're dealing with a
[47:04] heart a free moreal agency and the word
[47:07] of God is a discerner of every heart it
[47:09] knows how bad you want him amen we know
[47:13] God wants to give us the Holy Ghost more
[47:15] than we can kind of comprehend
[47:17] it we feel like we're waiting on God
[47:20] when's God going to bless us when God's
[47:21] going to do this God wants to give it
[47:23] more than we want it we're not wanting
[47:25] it enough
[47:27] and God knows and we've got to trust him
[47:31] that if he hasn't given us what we're
[47:33] looking for right now that means we need
[47:35] to seek more of him we need to give more
[47:37] of oursel we need to die out more to
[47:43] ourselves Jesus speaking of his death in
[47:45] John 1223 said the hour has come the son
[47:48] of man should be glorified verily I
[47:50] verily I say unto you except a corn of
[47:53] wheat fall into the ground and die
[47:56] it abideth
[47:58] alone but if it die it bringeth forth
[48:02] much
[48:04] fruit and he that loveth his life is
[48:08] going to lose
[48:09] it but he that hateth his life in this
[48:13] world it's got to be in this
[48:15] world shall keep it unto life eternal
[48:21] amen the Son of God was born to die that
[48:26] he might become the firstborn of many
[48:28] Brethren
[48:30] amen Jesus said in Matthew 20:28 even as
[48:34] the son of man came not to minister to
[48:36] be ministered unto but to minister and
[48:40] to give his life a ransom for
[48:44] many he says Greater Love have no man
[48:47] this than a man lay down his life for
[48:48] his friends so we see these scriptures
[48:50] are all pointing to God giving his life
[48:55] amen
[48:57] John said for this purpose the Son of
[49:00] God was manifested that he might destroy
[49:04] the works of the devil
[49:06] amen you can believe the word of God
[49:10] from cover to
[49:12] cover you can believe brother that God
[49:14] sent a prophet and his name was William
[49:16] brandom and he brought the truth of the
[49:18] hour you can come to church Faithfully
[49:20] every day that we have
[49:24] church but your nature never
[49:29] changes it doesn't matter it doesn't
[49:34] matter the nature that we have has to be
[49:39] changed that is not going to happen with
[49:42] just
[49:43] saying I
[49:45] agree you agree all day you want you've
[49:48] got to get to the place where you're
[49:50] sick of yourself you die out to yourself
[49:52] you say I don't want to act like this
[49:54] anymore I don't want to be like like
[49:55] this anymore I want God's love flowing
[49:58] through my life amen you've got to get
[50:00] real with the Holy Ghost because the
[50:02] Holy Ghost in you is going to act the
[50:04] same way it did in Jesus and the same
[50:06] way it did in the apostles it don't act
[50:08] different today people are changing the
[50:09] world changing it's going crazy but
[50:12] God's word Remains the Same it will be
[50:14] the same inside of us no matter what
[50:15] happening in the
[50:19] world am some people have left Jesus in
[50:22] a manger yes yes it's true they'll pass
[50:27] presents around but it won't be because
[50:29] Jesus was
[50:31] born they'll put presents under a tree
[50:34] but they won't even think about the tree
[50:35] of
[50:36] Calvary right Jesus was born to die for
[50:40] our
[50:42] sins now hey some have taken him out of
[50:45] a
[50:46] Manger but they've left him on the
[50:49] cross just left him on the cross hanging
[50:52] he died for
[50:53] me yes Jesus died for me I accept I
[50:57] accept the sacrifice praise God and
[50:59] that's
[51:02] it the spirit that was on Jesus never
[51:06] came back upon
[51:09] them they have a mental belief that
[51:12] Jesus died for them but it stops right
[51:15] there they continue living doing what
[51:18] their own
[51:19] will it's that simple they continue
[51:23] living doing their own will
[51:26] they never die out so the spirit of
[51:28] Christ could come back and live in them
[51:30] because that's what it
[51:33] requires God doesn't love you enough
[51:36] remember this God does not love you
[51:39] enough to change your nature if you
[51:42] don't want it
[51:45] changed he's a gentleman he respects
[51:49] free more agency but when you come into
[51:52] agreement I agree with that word that my
[51:55] life there's no good in me and I need
[51:57] all of God inside of me that is when God
[52:00] will meet you he'll meet you right there
[52:02] but he he's not going to cross for you
[52:04] more agency just because you're
[52:09] his you still got to come the same way
[52:12] you got to die out to self have to no
[52:16] robots in
[52:18] heaven first Peter 2:24 who his own self
[52:23] bear our sins in his own body on the
[52:28] tree that we being dead to sins should
[52:32] live unto righteousness see notice he's
[52:36] not supposed to be left on a
[52:40] tree he died he rose again and his
[52:44] spirit is to come live back in US
[52:47] amen too many people have left Jesus on
[52:50] the cross just hanging there they've
[52:52] never opened up the father's gift of
[52:57] Love they just left it under the tree
[53:00] they need to open it up Romans 811 says
[53:04] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[53:06] Jesus from the dead dwells in you he
[53:09] that raised Christ from the dead shall
[53:10] also Quicken your mortal Body by the
[53:13] spirit that dwelleth in you am that's
[53:16] telling me that God can change me God
[53:19] can Quicken me God can take my bad
[53:21] habits and make good habits God can take
[53:24] my bad thinking and make good thinking
[53:26] God can take my love and make it and
[53:28] make his love instead of my love amen
[53:32] because it's his Spirit that's living in
[53:33] me too often we try to put peacock
[53:36] feathers in us you know I'm going to act
[53:38] like a Christian I'm going to do this
[53:40] the Bible says this and we're missing
[53:42] the spirit of
[53:45] God therefore brethren we are debtors
[53:48] not to the flesh to live after the flesh
[53:52] for if we live after the flesh you shall
[53:54] die
[53:56] but if you through the spirit do
[54:02] mortify kill the Deeds of the body you
[54:06] shall live you have a job to do God is
[54:09] not going to Crucify My
[54:13] Flesh he's not going to do
[54:16] it that's the that's our
[54:21] job if you love your flesh you love your
[54:24] flesh
[54:25] you hate your flesh he'll give you your
[54:28] spirit and the thing is our flesh
[54:31] stinks it
[54:37] stinks it's up to us to let it stink so
[54:41] bad that we just let it
[54:44] rot you know here's the thing either you
[54:48] hate it and take care of it or everybody
[54:49] else has to deal with
[54:53] it God gift to us was
[54:57] himself in spirit
[55:00] form it's important in spirit
[55:04] form not the events that God made happen
[55:09] the birth of Jesus and the death of
[55:10] Jesus only opened the door for the
[55:15] spirit of God to come and live inside of
[55:22] us rejoicing about those two things but
[55:26] never receiving the intentions that God
[55:28] had by doing them is in is going to be
[55:31] in
[55:31] vain are are you with me is this this
[55:35] this word is real this this
[55:37] evening it's real to me oh God is a
[55:41] spirit the Holy Spirit but he's also the
[55:45] word now I want to try to break this a
[55:47] little bit John 1 says in the beginning
[55:49] was the word the word was with God and
[55:51] the Word was God Amen later on in
[55:55] chapter four he said God is a spirit
[55:57] Jesus speaking and they that worship Him
[56:00] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[56:03] amen so he's the word and he's the
[56:08] spirit now when it comes to the Bible
[56:10] it's all
[56:12] truth it's a
[56:14] sword and any sword Like a Knife is
[56:17] dangerous but this word is really
[56:21] dangerous it's nothing to play with amen
[56:25] and it's nothing to
[56:28] ignore Jesus said in John 12:47 and if
[56:31] any man hear my words and believe
[56:35] not I judge him
[56:37] not for I came not to judge the world
[56:41] but I came to save the world
[56:44] right now when you just look at that
[56:48] word that sentence that verse it don't
[56:51] seem that
[56:53] dangerous but just look at the next
[56:56] verse he that rejecteth me and receiveth
[57:00] not my words have one that judgeth him
[57:03] the word that I have spoken the same
[57:05] shall judge him in the last day this is
[57:08] what I want to say to everybody here
[57:11] when there is something wrong the Bible
[57:14] tells us judge nothing before it's time
[57:17] we're quick on wanting to judge judge
[57:20] things I'll say if you want to be quick
[57:22] to judge judge yourself judge yourself
[57:25] never go wrong I don't care how quick
[57:26] you are but when it comes to
[57:30] others look God gave Grace to mankind
[57:35] amen as long as he's got breath in his
[57:38] lungs he's got a chance to repent that's
[57:40] right who are we to say time's up for
[57:43] somebody and judge
[57:46] them let's go back to our opening
[57:48] scripture John 3:1 15 that what that
[57:52] whosoever believeth in him should not
[57:54] not perish but have eternal
[57:59] life did you ever
[58:01] wonder why the word says should not
[58:07] perish list said I'm going to come out
[58:09] there and sit next to you in the seats
[58:10] if you don't start talking to me when I
[58:11] ask you
[58:12] questions verse 16 for God so loved the
[58:15] world that he gave his only begotten son
[58:18] that whosoever believeth in
[58:20] him they should not perish but have
[58:24] everlasting life
[58:26] why does the Bible say should not why
[58:30] doesn't the Bible say will

[58:38] not Christ was not a gift to be left on
[58:42] the
[58:44] tree God's word was meant to be received
[58:49] and
[58:51] obeyed and that
[58:53] gift
[58:56] the gift that the father's given us the
[58:59] son we need to open this gift that he's
[59:03] given us and receive it amen but not the
[59:10] word the spirit of the
[59:14] word there's a difference
[59:18] amen you can believe it and miss
[59:23] it you can believe and miss it that's
[59:26] why Jesus said search the scriptures for
[59:30] in them you think you have eternal life
[59:32] but they are they these are these that
[59:36] testify of who I am so my opinion don't
[59:40] matter who God is your opinion don't
[59:42] matter who God is the word testifies of
[59:45] who he is and we've got to believe it
[59:47] according to the
[59:50] scriptures if we try to take part of the
[59:53] father's gift that he's given us but not
[59:57] receive all of his word we're not
[1:00:01] receiving
[1:00:02] God and people want to separate oh I've
[1:00:05] received God but you know no I don't
[1:00:08] need to do I don't I don't need to do
[1:00:10] all that that was for some other
[1:00:14] time you're re what you're doing is
[1:00:17] you're postponing your
[1:00:18] judgment because God ain't going to
[1:00:20] judge you
[1:00:21] now necessarily he may wait till the
[1:00:24] have
[1:00:25] judgment but judgment will come that's
[1:00:28] why I say this word is nothing to mess
[1:00:31] with it's God it's God and you've got to
[1:00:37] respect it as God you got to reverence
[1:00:39] it like
[1:00:40] God for God sent not verse 17 his son
[1:00:44] into the world to condemn it but that
[1:00:47] the world through him might be saved
[1:00:49] that was his his
[1:00:52] goal so if all you had to do is just
[1:00:55] believe that Jesus died for you then
[1:00:58] there would be no need for a nature
[1:01:00] change there'd be no need to be born
[1:01:03] again there would be no need for all
[1:01:05] things to be of
[1:01:07] God so we've got to take all the
[1:01:09] scriptures if we're going to get the
[1:01:11] understanding he that believeth on him
[1:01:13] is not condemned but he that believeth
[1:01:15] not is condemned already because have
[1:01:17] not believed in the name of the only
[1:01:18] begotten Son of God and this is the
[1:01:23] condemnation
[1:01:25] that light has come into the world and
[1:01:28] Men love Darkness rather than light
[1:01:34] because their deeds were
[1:01:36] evil here's the choice that we all have
[1:01:38] to make God's will or
[1:01:42] ours our our will is Darkness it's
[1:01:46] evil and when we say we don't love light
[1:01:49] we're just saying we don't love to do
[1:01:51] God's
[1:01:53] Will and and here here's the thing
[1:01:55] Saints it's up to us to get serious
[1:01:58] about whether we're doing God's will
[1:01:59] every
[1:02:00] day you
[1:02:02] know I believe with all my heart I I
[1:02:06] believe with all my heart that this
[1:02:08] church does not put anybody in a
[1:02:14] Rapture but I do believe that God will
[1:02:18] provide a way for you to make a Rapture
[1:02:20] in this
[1:02:21] church big
[1:02:23] difference you know we sit here and we
[1:02:25] we expect God to do something when God's
[1:02:28] waiting on
[1:02:30] us God's waiting on
[1:02:32] us we we're loving to do our will too
[1:02:37] much soad of dying out and saying Lord
[1:02:39] what would you have me to do
[1:02:41] today it's not what we
[1:02:44] know it's what we yield ourselves
[1:02:47] to for everyone that doeth evil hateth
[1:02:50] the light neither cometh to the light
[1:02:51] lest his deed should be
[1:02:53] reproved but he that doeth truth cometh
[1:02:56] to the light that his deeds may be made
[1:02:59] manifest that they are wrought of
[1:03:05] God the word of God is a light for our
[1:03:11] lives but his word without the spirit
[1:03:14] will only bring
[1:03:16] condemnation and judgment eventually
[1:03:19] judgment to our
[1:03:21] lives we need the spirit of the word we
[1:03:24] need the Living Word we need to enter
[1:03:30] in to the spirit that's being that's
[1:03:33] ministering Amen to our hearts we need
[1:03:36] to enter into that spirit because we
[1:03:39] don't believe this is a a
[1:03:42] seminar where we we we learn
[1:03:45] intellectually about God when we leave
[1:03:47] here we want the spirit of God with us
[1:03:50] we don't want the knowledge of God we
[1:03:51] want the spirit of God With Us amen amen
[1:03:55] 2 Corinthians
[1:03:57] 3:6 Paul says to the Corinthian Church
[1:04:00] God has made us able Ministers of the
[1:04:03] New Testament not of the letter but of
[1:04:07] the spirit amen for the letter kth but
[1:04:10] the spirit it gives life so you want you
[1:04:14] want life to come forth from the the
[1:04:17] services from the ministry enter into
[1:04:20] the spirit of the word that that's where
[1:04:22] you're at God God could be right here
[1:04:25] and speak words and it's not going to
[1:04:27] change
[1:04:28] us we've got to receive the spirit of
[1:04:31] the
[1:04:32] word and it takes heart it's where you
[1:04:35] give your heart it's God I need you I
[1:04:38] need you right now I need to I need to I
[1:04:40] need this on the inside I hear it here
[1:04:43] understand it but I need it inside
[1:04:45] that's what it
[1:04:47] takes when we open the father's gift and
[1:04:50] receive the spirit of the word we
[1:04:53] actually what become the word amen you
[1:04:56] know you can receive the spir you can
[1:04:59] receive the knowledge of the word here
[1:05:01] and never become it you could become a a
[1:05:04] walking cyclopedia talk about the word
[1:05:07] talk about it but never ever manifest
[1:05:20] it we're going have to glue these things
[1:05:23] on
[1:05:26] all right 2 Corinthians chapter 3:2 ye
[1:05:28] are our
[1:05:31] Epistles written in our hearts known and
[1:05:34] read of all men for as much as you have
[1:05:37] manifested declared to be the Epistles
[1:05:41] of Christ man ministered by US Written
[1:05:43] not with ink but with the spirit of the
[1:05:47] Living God not in tables of stone but in
[1:05:50] fleshly tables of heart see God's spirit
[1:05:53] is meant to to come inside of us and
[1:05:56] manifest and I'll say this today we've
[1:05:58] all received Christ as our savior but I
[1:06:03] want to ask you the question have you
[1:06:05] received all what
[1:06:07] Christ
[1:06:10] is that means we got to get into the
[1:06:14] gift that God gave
[1:06:17] us we got to open that up and say God I
[1:06:21] need the spirit of your word inside me
[1:06:24] because that's what Christ
[1:06:26] is that is what the gift is I don't want
[1:06:30] just a nice sound
[1:06:32] church amen I don't want to be just
[1:06:34] under the umbrella of the
[1:06:37] message I don't want to be with just
[1:06:40] what's people that say they believe I
[1:06:42] want him in sonomy I want them when the
[1:06:45] when the going gets tough and I'm in a
[1:06:47] rough situation I want about to call on
[1:06:49] God I want about to have faith in God
[1:06:51] and that he comes on the rescue
[1:06:55] the Bible says when all thy ways please
[1:06:57] the Lord he'll make even thy enemies to
[1:07:00] be at peace with you and what excuses do
[1:07:03] we
[1:07:05] use why don't we just get back to the
[1:07:07] word let the word tell you what you need
[1:07:10] to do maybe there's some more ways in
[1:07:12] our life that we need to please
[1:07:15] them Jesus said in John 663 it is the
[1:07:18] spirit that quickeneth the flesh proth
[1:07:22] nothing the words that speak unto you
[1:07:24] they are spirit and they are life
[1:07:31] amen God's word is the light for our
[1:07:38] lives Psalms Thy word is a lamp unto my
[1:07:42] feet it is a light unto my path through
[1:07:46] thy precepts I get understanding
[1:07:50] amen through thy Commandments thou has
[1:07:53] made me Wis ER than my
[1:07:56] enemies right through thy
[1:07:59] Commandments the word of the Lord is
[1:08:02] perfect converting the
[1:08:05] soul you need the word to get converted
[1:08:10] amen don't leave them on the
[1:08:13] tree get them
[1:08:15] off open that gift let that the spirit
[1:08:20] of God come inside you well brother John
[1:08:22] I've asked him but I just don't seem to
[1:08:24] get anymore you need to get hungering
[1:08:26] and thirsting more because God's word
[1:08:28] Remains the Same amen nobody's going to
[1:08:30] meet him on that day and say God you
[1:08:32] were a liar you never came into my heart
[1:08:34] when I asked you he'll say you never
[1:08:36] wanted me
[1:08:38] enough because the whole world wants to
[1:08:40] go to heaven they don't want to go to
[1:08:41] hell I can tell you
[1:08:43] that but I don't think they're willing
[1:08:46] to do what the word tells them to do
[1:08:49] you've got to want it so bad that you
[1:08:51] give up your will for his amen
[1:08:54] salvation is not a Christmas
[1:08:58] present true salvation comes through
[1:09:01] Obedience of this
[1:09:03] word Thy word the word of the Lord is
[1:09:06] perfect following the word will convert
[1:09:11] a
[1:09:12] soul that's why many people are
[1:09:16] lost because of a lack of the knowledge
[1:09:20] they get the wrong
[1:09:22] knowledge
[1:09:24] people are ever growing ever learning
[1:09:26] but never coming to the knowledge of the
[1:09:28] truth the knowledge of the truth is you
[1:09:30] need to receive the spirit of God that's
[1:09:31] the knowledge of the truth needs to be
[1:09:34] living in
[1:09:36] you now if you want to exchange gifts
[1:09:40] this year how many wants to exchange
[1:09:41] gifts with the Lord this
[1:09:43] year
[1:09:45] amen well give him your heart your
[1:09:48] spirit and he will give you his heart
[1:09:50] and his Spirit that's right amen what a
[1:09:54] wonderful
[1:09:56] exchang pour out more love for his word
[1:10:00] set your affections on things
[1:10:02] above John said in or uh Jesus said in
[1:10:05] John 14:23 now listen to these words if
[1:10:09] a man love me he will keep my
[1:10:12] words and my father will love him and we
[1:10:15] will come unto him and make our Abode
[1:10:19] with
[1:10:21] him that's opening the father's gift
[1:10:24] right there that's what John 3:16 was
[1:10:27] all about was to
[1:10:29] get brother Ram said
[1:10:33] that
[1:10:37] God all that was in God he poured into
[1:10:39] Christ all that was in Christ he poured
[1:10:41] into the church and God's desire for the
[1:10:45] church is that he might be preeminent in
[1:10:47] the
[1:10:51] church now how do I know he's preeminent
[1:10:54] in my
[1:10:55] life well I'm going to be honest with
[1:10:58] you I can't wake up every day and say
[1:11:02] God you're going to be preeminent in
[1:11:03] this in my my life
[1:11:05] today and there's not a day I go to bed
[1:11:07] and I I lay down on my bed and I say
[1:11:09] praise God you were preeminent my life
[1:11:12] today it takes a consciousness of God I
[1:11:16] want you first I want to do your will
[1:11:19] come and fill me don't let my mind take
[1:11:22] me away from you being pre
[1:11:27] imminent you can be as close to God as
[1:11:29] you want you can have as much of God as
[1:11:31] you want you can never have too
[1:11:34] much if you want more give more die
[1:11:40] more all right if you want God's
[1:11:42] personal attention open the word of God
[1:11:46] if you want more of God's
[1:11:49] attention open this word with one thing
[1:11:54] more
[1:11:57] reverence it's just not a book to read
[1:12:00] it's not just using it as some Ouija
[1:12:03] board to try to get some direction out
[1:12:05] of your
[1:12:06] life reverence the whole word the whole
[1:12:10] word is God yes this word is a lamp for
[1:12:13] our path for our it's a light for us but
[1:12:16] it's not meant just to use God for when
[1:12:18] we want
[1:12:21] him I believe if we be to have more
[1:12:24] respect for the word of God more
[1:12:25] reverence so when the word is preached
[1:12:28] or we read the word or we're listening
[1:12:29] to the word that we we we have a greater
[1:12:32] fear to walk in
[1:12:35] it that's when you're going to get a
[1:12:38] hold of God's attention for your
[1:12:40] life Isaiah 66
[1:12:43] verse1 praise the Lord I want this to be
[1:12:45] on the board Isaiah 66 verse1 thus saith
[1:12:49] the Lord the heaven is my Throne the
[1:12:51] Earth is my foot stew
[1:12:53] where is the house you're going to build
[1:12:55] me or where is the place of my
[1:12:59] rest for all those things have my hands
[1:13:03] made that's right and all those things
[1:13:07] have been sayeth the
[1:13:08] Lord but to this man to this man will I
[1:13:16] look even to him that is poor and of a
[1:13:21] contrite spirit
[1:13:23] and trembleth at my word trembleth not
[1:13:29] just oh well this is the good book says
[1:13:32] trembleth you know what that word
[1:13:33] trembleth means means reverent I had to
[1:13:37] look it up it means
[1:13:40] reverent you want God to look at you you
[1:13:43] want more attention with God you want
[1:13:45] God to move more in your favor we have
[1:13:47] the answer right here become more
[1:13:50] reverent to the word you know sometimes
[1:13:52] God wants you to do something and you
[1:13:54] don't want to do it sometimes you come
[1:13:57] to church with other reasons that why
[1:13:59] God want you here sometimes God's trying
[1:14:01] to get you to do something but you don't
[1:14:03] think that's important in your life and
[1:14:04] you're trying to get answers over here
[1:14:06] well if you want God to move in your
[1:14:08] behalf you need to become more reverent
[1:14:10] to the word of
[1:14:12] God it's all there is to
[1:14:15] it keep opening the father's gift
[1:14:18] personally for your life because you
[1:14:19] know you live in a home not everybody is
[1:14:22] going to make the same sacrifice that
[1:14:24] you're going to
[1:14:25] make but this isn't about you in your
[1:14:30] home it's not about you and your church
[1:14:33] it's not about you and your work God
[1:14:36] deals with us as
[1:14:39] individuals you may make a greater
[1:14:42] sacrifice than somebody
[1:14:44] else somebody else may make a greater
[1:14:47] sacrifice in
[1:14:49] you look I'm glad that Paul said follow
[1:14:52] me as I follow Christ because the moment
[1:14:54] that I don't if he would have just said
[1:14:55] look I wrote 14 books in the Bible the
[1:14:57] first prophet Ephesian Church you need
[1:14:59] to listen to me but he decided not to
[1:15:02] follow Christ somewhere what would
[1:15:04] happen to all of us following
[1:15:09] him so don't follow some man's
[1:15:14] example follow Christ follow the word
[1:15:17] and he's trying to lead us up higher
[1:15:19] than we're even thinking about he's
[1:15:22] trying to get us to a place that we've
[1:15:24] lost faith and confidence how to get
[1:15:26] there but I'm still a believer that I'm
[1:15:29] going to be just like him when he
[1:15:30] appears I may not now God anybody that
[1:15:33] knows me can testify I'm not but one day
[1:15:35] I'm going to
[1:15:37] be I'm a believer of the word I'm gonna
[1:15:40] believe what the word says about me
[1:15:41] rather than what I think about
[1:15:44] myself
[1:15:47] amen so keep opening the
[1:15:51] word one time Jesus was was talking to
[1:15:53] some Jews which believed on him already
[1:15:56] and he said to them if you continue in
[1:15:58] my word then you're my disciples indeed
[1:16:01] you just can't say I believe and I'm
[1:16:04] saved you got to continue walking in the
[1:16:07] light I always say like we've heard this
[1:16:09] we all know that God don't take some
[1:16:11] till they're most ready to go God's not
[1:16:15] going to take us till he's done with us
[1:16:16] right that means that if we're alive God
[1:16:20] has an expectation of
[1:16:22] us and every time he gives us more
[1:16:25] word we need to be walking in it
[1:16:29] amen
[1:16:32] amen
[1:16:44] now I want to talk about how we
[1:16:50] can get more of
[1:16:54] what God has for us in this word and I
[1:16:56] want us to go to Hebrews chapter 4
[1:17:01] verse1 Paul speaking to the Hebrew
[1:17:06] church he said let us therefore
[1:17:09] fear he throws that word in
[1:17:13] fear lest a promise being left us of
[1:17:18] entering into his rest any of you should
[1:17:20] seem to come short of
[1:17:29] it
[1:17:31] now the three Hebrew
[1:17:34] children they were in that rest
[1:17:40] amen they weren't you know what I'm
[1:17:43] scared I don't know I don't really want
[1:17:45] to go in that fiery
[1:17:47] furnace they had the
[1:17:52] goods
[1:17:53] and I believe that if you apply this
[1:17:57] scripture to your
[1:18:00] life that this word contains the
[1:18:03] promises that you need for such a nature
[1:18:06] change that you will be perfectly at
[1:18:08] peace and at rest no matter what
[1:18:11] happens because that's what the Holy
[1:18:13] Ghost
[1:18:15] is the now we know this word the prophet
[1:18:19] taught us that this word is our rest but
[1:18:21] it's not the written
[1:18:24] word it's the spirit of the
[1:18:28] word because the natural
[1:18:31] word no matter how much we believe the
[1:18:34] natural
[1:18:35] word if we never get to the spirit of
[1:18:37] the
[1:18:38] word the natural word is just going to
[1:18:41] condemn us we're going to feel convicted
[1:18:44] because it's like the law right that's
[1:18:46] what the law was you can't live the law
[1:18:50] you can't live the word only the Holy
[1:18:53] Ghost Inside you can live his own word
[1:18:56] right so that's why we're we we seek
[1:18:58] more of the Holy Ghost so we can live
[1:19:00] more of the word it takes the pressure
[1:19:03] off of
[1:19:04] us verse Two For unto us was the Gospel
[1:19:08] preach as well as unto them but the word
[1:19:11] preached did not profit them not being
[1:19:14] mixed with faith in them that heard
[1:19:20] it so the children of Israel heard God's
[1:19:25] voice I have given you a land now go
[1:19:28] possess it it's yours take
[1:19:31] it but when the word was preached to
[1:19:33] them it just kind of fell to the
[1:19:37] wayside it fell it went in one ear and
[1:19:40] out the
[1:19:43] other the word that was
[1:19:48] preached
[1:19:50] didn't it was a natural word the
[1:19:53] national War said yeah we're more than
[1:19:55] able to to take the land let's go it's
[1:19:57] yours and when they saw the giant
[1:20:03] it it neglected that they were able to
[1:20:06] take the land because that giant made
[1:20:09] them fearful made them
[1:20:11] scared even though they heard the word
[1:20:14] in
[1:20:17] church but they didn't receive the
[1:20:19] spirit of the
[1:20:21] word
[1:20:23] that's right brother Ron Joshua and cayb
[1:20:26] the Bible says was of another
[1:20:29] Spirit what was that spirit that was the
[1:20:31] spirit of the
[1:20:34] word and that's
[1:20:36] why they in the face of 1.8 million
[1:20:40] people that were against
[1:20:41] them could still have confidence in
[1:20:46] going we've got to receive the spirit of
[1:20:49] the word we've got to get so serious and
[1:20:52] so dedicated to getting into the spirit
[1:20:54] of the of the message of the hour and
[1:20:56] the word that's being
[1:20:58] preached because if we just hear the
[1:21:00] natural word it's not going to profit us
[1:21:03] anything it's not going to help us in
[1:21:05] our trials it's not going to help us in
[1:21:07] our
[1:21:14] test we need to hear what the spirit is
[1:21:17] saying to the church right that's what
[1:21:19] Jesus said he that got ears to hear what
[1:21:21] the spirit is saying
[1:21:23] not the man who's preaching not the
[1:21:24] natural word but the spirit of the
[1:21:27] word
[1:21:29] now how do I get God Spirit just to
[1:21:34] speak to
[1:21:38] me well the antidote or the solution to
[1:21:41] this I'll say very common problem is
[1:21:45] fear because that's what Hebrews tells
[1:21:47] us to do let us therefore fear that's
[1:21:51] the answer fear
[1:21:55] now that word fear means to be
[1:21:57] frightened at the fact that you could
[1:22:00] miss it to be alarmed to be at awe to be
[1:22:04] reverent towards God more than you
[1:22:08] presently
[1:22:09] are that's what fear
[1:22:12] means that's all internal right it's not
[1:22:16] what you say it's not how you
[1:22:18] dress not showing up for church it's
[1:22:21] something that's real the inside of you
[1:22:23] I don't want to miss it and that's what
[1:22:26] causes you to start obeying the word
[1:22:27] that's what causes you to pray more it's
[1:22:30] causes you to come and be more prepared
[1:22:32] so the word falls on good ground it's
[1:22:34] the fear of the Lord it's the beginning
[1:22:36] of wisdom
[1:22:39] amen Faith cometh by
[1:22:43] hearing and proper hearing comes from
[1:22:46] hearing directly from God and not man
[1:22:50] not the man standing behind the pulpit
[1:22:56] even when you read this I mean you know
[1:22:58] brother bam talked about all these these
[1:23:00] um people who get um degrees they go to
[1:23:04] a seminary and they get a
[1:23:08] degree and they spend many years in a
[1:23:11] seminary and they know the Bible and
[1:23:14] brother Brenham says they're further
[1:23:16] away from God than when they went in
[1:23:18] there and it's because they never
[1:23:21] received the spe of the word they're
[1:23:23] sitting there listening to a man talk to
[1:23:25] them this is what you got to do this is
[1:23:27] what our denomination believes this is
[1:23:29] this is what you got to do this is this
[1:23:31] we believe our church is the right
[1:23:34] way and they never meet Christ
[1:23:37] themselves that's
[1:23:40] true just five minutes in his
[1:23:43] presence five minutes in his presence
[1:23:46] can do more than 5 years away from his
[1:23:50] presence I wouldn't trade a person
[1:23:52] personal relationship with God with any
[1:23:54] knowledge or any revelation of anything
[1:24:04] else this is how we
[1:24:07] fear I know Lord your word is being
[1:24:10] preached but unless you come and make it
[1:24:13] real to me it's going to be in vain I'm
[1:24:16] going to walk out of here I'm not going
[1:24:18] to think about the service I'm not going
[1:24:19] to talk about it it's just going to be
[1:24:21] another service I'm going to appease my
[1:24:23] my attendance
[1:24:27] record Lord I want this word opened up
[1:24:30] to me personally I don't know why
[1:24:32] anybody else is here but I know why I'm
[1:24:35] here I'm coming to you today with faith
[1:24:40] amen and I reverence your word I respect
[1:24:44] your word I want to dedicate myself to
[1:24:46] this word you know the prophet often
[1:24:50] rededicated his life our Prophet did
[1:24:59] rededicated this is how you open up the
[1:25:03] father's gift to you this is how you
[1:25:06] open
[1:25:10] it God's got to come and reveal himself
[1:25:13] we can't know God any other
[1:25:17] way we can't figure it
[1:25:20] out he comes and unveils himself to us
[1:25:25] the word needs to become more real to us
[1:25:28] we need to believe it to the point that
[1:25:29] we'll rever it him more when we come
[1:25:33] into the presence of the
[1:25:36] word all right do you battle
[1:25:39] healing how many has ever battled
[1:25:42] healing before I mean I wanted God to
[1:25:45] come and heal me now this I'm just going
[1:25:47] to talk about the Simplicity of the word
[1:25:51] we got to open the father's gift what
[1:25:53] does it say by his stripes we are healed
[1:25:56] amen now you just say Lord thank you for
[1:25:59] bearing the stripes for me as you did
[1:26:03] for somebody
[1:26:04] else because the problem is we know God
[1:26:07] has healed somebody because we hear
[1:26:11] testimonies but we want God to heal us
[1:26:14] so thank the Lord for healing you as he
[1:26:18] has healed other people he bore those
[1:26:20] stripes for you just as much as he borne
[1:26:22] for somebody else so by faith you just
[1:26:25] start thanking him and I'll say it like
[1:26:27] this you thank him every
[1:26:30] day because if you just thank him for a
[1:26:32] little bit and then just stop thinking
[1:26:34] about it well where's your
[1:26:39] faith humies battled
[1:26:42] negativity negative
[1:26:45] thoughts open the father's gift what
[1:26:48] does the word
[1:26:49] say think on these things amen when we
[1:26:54] start practicing the controlling of our
[1:26:57] thoughts is when positiveness can come
[1:27:00] into our
[1:27:02] minds Paul told the Corinthian Church
[1:27:05] cast down your
[1:27:07] imaginations cast down every High thing
[1:27:09] that exalteth itself against the
[1:27:11] knowledge of God and bring it into
[1:27:14] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[1:27:17] of Christ well you know if you truly
[1:27:19] sincerely do that you ain't got hardly
[1:27:22] time at all to do
[1:27:25] anything but if you just open your you
[1:27:28] know our mind is like a womb right you

[1:27:34] that'll get you so down and
[1:27:37] discouraged you got to take control of
[1:27:39] your thought you got to bring it into

[1:28:00] what it says what does the word say
[1:28:02] about fear perfect love cast all fear

[1:28:08] take this fear away to help me no get
[1:28:10] perfect love seek perfect love it'll
[1:28:13] automatically you'll automatically have
[1:28:15] faith to cast it

[1:29:03] way to the Rapture have you ever just
[1:29:05] battled maybe I'm just not going to go
[1:29:08] all the
[1:29:11] way open his gift and see what it
[1:29:17] says he said I will never leave thee nor
[1:29:20] forsake thee just believe it that's
[1:29:22] right you've got to believe

[1:30:10] he's just going to like now I'm moving
[1:30:13] on to someone
[1:30:16] else what does the father's gift say I
[1:30:20] am persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:30:22] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:30:25] nor things present nor things to come
[1:30:27] nor height nor death nor any other
[1:30:29] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:30:32] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:30:33] Jesus our lord that settles it I
[1:30:37] reverence that
[1:30:39] word and if God God believes this for me
[1:30:43] if God's saying this to me then God is

[1:30:46] it for my
[1:30:49] sister how many want more of the Holy
[1:30:51] Ghost

[1:31:00] and you shall find knock and it shall be
[1:31:02] open for everyone that
[1:31:04] askthe that seeketh findeth and to him
[1:31:07] that knocketh it shall be open now he
[1:31:09] didn't say
[1:31:12] most he said everyone yes every one that
[1:31:20] askthestorybots want more Holy Ghost
[1:31:23] just start asking
[1:31:24] them if you're content with what you
[1:31:26] have don't ask them if you think you got
[1:31:29] enough don't ask him but if you want
[1:31:32] more there's more for you we got God in
[1:31:35] proportion in
[1:31:37] portion Jesus had the Holy Ghost without
[1:31:42] portion right he had the fullness of the
[1:31:44] godhead dwelt in him amen we have a
[1:31:47] portion we can get
[1:31:50] more it's a the same way we got it at
[1:31:52] the beginning it hasn't changed there's
[1:31:56] not a different word for us amen you
[1:31:58] know when you're seeking him and you're
[1:32:00] asking him God fill me with more of the
[1:32:02] Holy Ghost you know what if you're not
[1:32:04] doing something God wants you to be
[1:32:05] doing if you need to make something
[1:32:07] right if you need to stop doing
[1:32:09] something whatever it is God will speak
[1:32:12] to you at that time and he'll make know
[1:32:14] what he wants you to do because maybe
[1:32:16] there's something that you need to
[1:32:20] do cuz he G gives the Holy Ghost to them
[1:32:23] that obey him
[1:32:26] amen if ye then being in evil know how
[1:32:28] to give good gifts how many you got
[1:32:30] gifts for your children at some time a
[1:32:33] birthday or
[1:32:34] Christmas if you know how to give good
[1:32:36] gifts to your
[1:32:39] children and if you feel like me you're
[1:32:42] not the best dad in in the planet how
[1:32:45] much more shall your heavenly father
[1:32:47] give you the Holy Ghost to them that ask
[1:32:50] him his desire his whole purpose of
[1:32:52] sending his gift of his son was so you
[1:32:55] could get the Holy Ghost that was his
[1:32:57] whole purpose amen he's not just
[1:32:59] satisfied with just saving you and he's
[1:33:01] going to plaster you on the wall in
[1:33:03] heaven he wants to live in you he wants
[1:33:07] to make his AB bold with you he wants a
[1:33:09] realness
[1:33:13] there how many wants to be a greater
[1:33:18] Overcomer look don't be looking for
[1:33:22] power in
[1:33:23] yourself to do it just agree with the
[1:33:27] word open up the open up the father's
[1:33:30] gift to you and see what it says and
[1:33:31] reverently just say I believe
[1:33:33] it the Bible says ye are of God and have
[1:33:36] overcome them because greater is he that
[1:33:40] is in you than he that's in the world
[1:33:42] don't be saying I don't know what to do
[1:33:45] with this situation don't say that I
[1:33:49] understand I understand you don't know
[1:33:52] what to do I understand
[1:33:57] that but just stand there and let God
[1:34:00] start working through you because he
[1:34:03] knows how to handle the situation
[1:34:05] believe me he created everything I'm
[1:34:07] sure he can handle it the problem is we
[1:34:11] just try to take the reins and have to
[1:34:13] figure it all
[1:34:15] ourself God wants to work through
[1:34:18] us what else does the Bible say please
[1:34:21] plead the blood of the Lamb this is the
[1:34:24] antidote here for overcoming plead the
[1:34:26] blood of the Lamb testify that the what
[1:34:29] the word says and keep crucifying your
[1:34:33] flesh right they love not theirself unto
[1:34:36] the death and that's how they overcame
[1:34:38] them so you got to keep crucifying you
[1:34:41] got to keep testifying what the word
[1:34:42] says about you you got to keep pleading
[1:34:44] the blood for the mistakes that you make
[1:34:47] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:34:49] world even your faith you have to
[1:34:52] believe what the word says am it won't
[1:34:54] do any good if you don't
[1:34:59] believe now when we open the father's
[1:35:01] gift to us we will see the very nature
[1:35:05] of God in that
[1:35:09] gift and that's what he's given us his
[1:35:12] own nature second Peter chapter 1 verse4
[1:35:16] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:35:21] great
[1:35:21] and precious promises in this Bible that
[1:35:25] by these promises we might be partakers
[1:35:28] of the divine nature of
[1:35:32] God having escaped the corruption in
[1:35:36] this world right here this world through
[1:35:39] lust wanting its will wanting to do it
[1:35:42] its way we got to escape that we got to
[1:35:46] have the the divine nature of God living
[1:35:48] out of us and and handling things the
[1:35:50] way that God handles
[1:35:54] them there's
[1:35:57] power God has
[1:36:01] power he said every place at The Souls
[1:36:03] of your feet shall tread upon that I
[1:36:05] have given you what do we got to do only
[1:36:09] be thou strong and very
[1:36:12] courageous that thou mayest observe to
[1:36:15] do
[1:36:16] all the law which Moses my servant
[1:36:20] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[1:36:22] right hand or to the left that thou
[1:36:24] mayest Prosper
[1:36:26] whether
[1:36:28] soever thou
[1:36:32] goest I don't know where he's leading me
[1:36:36] I don't know where I'm going tomorrow
[1:36:38] but I know this that if I keep him first
[1:36:41] he's going to prosper my
[1:36:44] steps wherever I go he's going to
[1:36:47] prosper them now if he's not prospering
[1:36:49] them it ain't his
[1:36:52] fault somewhere down the
[1:36:55] line I'm not observing to do something
[1:36:59] right right maybe all my ways are not
[1:37:02] pleasing the Lord maybe some of the ways
[1:37:04] are just pleasing
[1:37:07] me we just need to get serious and
[1:37:10] reverence the word because this word is
[1:37:13] real it works it lives this word lives
[1:37:16] in the person who will believe
[1:37:19] it whatever ever you
[1:37:23] need whatever your need might be just be
[1:37:27] conscious of opening the father's gift
[1:37:30] Jesus said if you abide in me and my
[1:37:33] words abide in you you shall ask what ye
[1:37:36] will and it shall be done unto
[1:37:39] you it's a
[1:37:44] promise we all want God to do things but
[1:37:47] we're not real excited about getting the
[1:37:49] word to abide in US
[1:37:52] Jesus said and all things whatsoever you
[1:37:54] ask in prayer
[1:37:57] believing believing and ye shall receive
[1:38:01] that's right we need to open the the
[1:38:04] father's gift that he's given to us in
[1:38:07] I'll say it like this it was broken down
[1:38:09] in this generation through a
[1:38:12] prophet I just got three quotes here and
[1:38:15] then I'm done okay I'm not going to
[1:38:17] continue to go and go but this my
[1:38:21] Christmas message for 2024 or
[1:38:24] [Laughter]
[1:38:26] 2023 brother BR send the message
[1:38:32] expectations this is in
[1:38:35] 1950 I think we just need to start
[1:38:37] holding ourselves accountable to our
[1:38:39] attitude he said we always get what we
[1:38:43] expect when people expect anything well
[1:38:47] then they usually get what they look
[1:38:50] for it's the mental attitude that you
[1:38:53] have he said remember this and never
[1:38:56] forget it the right mental attitude
[1:38:58] towards any
[1:39:00] promise of God will bring it to pass the
[1:39:05] right mental attitude towards any
[1:39:08] promise of
[1:39:11] god
[1:39:13] wow that is in my reach he just put that
[1:39:17] he just put it in my reach right
[1:39:20] there
[1:39:22] it doesn't take Gifts of healing to heal
[1:39:24] sick
[1:39:26] people any person in here has the right
[1:39:29] to meet Satan anywhere if you're a
[1:39:32] Christian and defeat him on the grounds
[1:39:36] that he could stand
[1:39:40] on all we got to do is believe the
[1:39:46] word I'm thankful for
[1:39:49] gifts we want all of them we want more
[1:39:52] of them we want him
[1:39:54] doubled oh we I just want
[1:39:57] him I just want him on the inside more
[1:40:01] of
[1:40:02] him all right 13 years later in the
[1:40:04] Awakening in the message Awakening Jesus
[1:40:07] brother B says the mental attitude you
[1:40:10] take
[1:40:12] towards take towards it will bring and
[1:40:16] then he just stops here and goes dot dot
[1:40:17] dot he says now the mind won't do it
[1:40:22] this is why I'm I'm the reason I'm
[1:40:23] reading this the mind doesn't bring the
[1:40:27] promise to
[1:40:29] pass but if you get the attitude towards
[1:40:33] something that's got life in it which is
[1:40:35] God he's the only thing that's got life
[1:40:36] in it then that life comes down and does
[1:40:41] it not your mental
[1:40:43] attitude that only brings you into the
[1:40:47] presence of
[1:40:48] him so I want you to understand
[1:40:51] understand this you play a part in
[1:40:52] bringing God's promise to pass which is
[1:40:54] your right mental attitude bringing you
[1:40:56] into the presence of
