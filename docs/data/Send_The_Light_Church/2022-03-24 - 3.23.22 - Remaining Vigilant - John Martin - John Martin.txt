TRANSCRIPT
========================================
simple only believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe in by your grace lord lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i [Music] amen it's him that gives us the faith to believe what is the truth amen amen god bless you this evening we certainly appreciate every effort put forth to make this the best worship service we could have because sometimes it's easier than others and sometimes it takes a greater sacrifice and i do believe that god looks at your sacrifice and so may the lord bless you turn with me if you would to the we got three opening scriptures today the first is in first peter chapter five verse eight first peter chapter five matthew chapter 24 and amos chapter six um we want to welcome brother bob crawford with us today god bless you brother bob i've often said i've said it to him i've said it to many he's one of the major reasons god has used him for sunderlight in so many ways and his prayer for us from the beginning before we ever preached and we just are in debt uh to that to him to the lord through him um and we just want to be faithful till we leave here amen amen before we read this word let's just look to the author dear heavenly father we thank you for this precious time together together we're just a few many are missing uh some are sick um some are afflicted and and some are have other work and other reasons that they're not here but god you're faithful to be here because you said we're just two or three would be gathered in your name you'd be right in the midst lord and father we're not asking that we feel you today we're not asking that we see the manifestation of you today but lord what we are asking is that we have faith to believe that you do the supernatural work in our hearts today lord you said blessed is he that believeth and has not seen lord we want to be part of that group today take the word lord that you have given us and open our eyes to see the real meaning and how we can better our lives bless each one meet the needs that be amongst us we'll be sure to give you the praise and honor for these things for we ask it in jesus precious name amen amen so in first peter chapter five verse number eight be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil is a royal lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour and then matthew 24 so no matter how predestinated we are peter is telling the reader to be sober and to be vigilant and that word vigilant means to keep awake or watch and here jesus also given us a warning in matthew chapter 24 42 watch therefore for ye know not the hour your lord doth return so the predestined they don't know what our our lord's returning and so we have a job as predestined christians to watch therefore and then amos chapter six verse one amos chapter six verse one woe to them that are at ease in zion and trust in the mountains of samaria which are name chief of the nations to whom the house of israel came god bless you may be seated may god bless us tonight with his word we want to entitle this message remaining vigilant amen we're nearer the hour of his coming than we've ever been brother branham says this in the message jezebel religion he says exactly right pinch your conscience you christian wake yourself up it's later than you think and of course the devil has made the whole world to feel um like they can just do whatever they want it's going to be okay and he has a way of getting into christian lives and making them to feel that where they're at is okay but peter said be sober that means spiritually sober to be vigilant to to keep awake and watch because the devil is trying to devour us woe to them that are at ease the foundation i just want to have a little start a little foundation of the word woe i i was just walking in the kitchen and this this scripture came to me woe unto them that are the ease in zion and i thought where did that come from and that's really where this whole service started with and i want to go with it that word woe means it's used to express grief regret or distress anguish ruinous trouble affliction or calamity whoa to them that are ease in zion it's not good enough to be in zion and we when we hear some real bad news let me get an automobile accident when i heard um one of my employees got in a real bad uh automobile accident we can react with whoa are you serious i can't believe it and it it with a agree for a distress and any time we hear some real bad news it's whoa whoa wait a minute this can't be serious jesus used this word woe often when he spoke of the self-righteous people in his day he said woe unto you scribes and pharisees and hypocrites woe unto you blind guides he said in other words ruinous trouble unto you scribes and pharisees calamity unto you ye blind guides they don't realize it but distress and anguish awaits them jesus warned every human being not to enter the wrong gate because it led to hell he said in matthew 7 verse 13 i know you know some of these scriptures but i'm just trying to lay and you know me a lengthy foundation entering into straight gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth unto destruction and many there be which going they're at so jesus is warning and he's saying whoa whoa destruction it's wide it's broad it's a spacious way that seems to lead to a ruinous destruction a calamity don't go there further in the chapter jesus goes to say in verse 22 he said that many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not we prophesy in the name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name then many wonderful works i think many will really be saying lord didn't i do the most important things because he's bringing these most important things to his attention and then while i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so woe to the broadway amen new york has a broad way woe to the broad way jesus said in verse 21 not everyone that saith unto me lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven amen woe unto them that profess and follow not the word right amen it's not the most important things that matter to god is building your life with every word of god that matters to god that's right god is interested in his whole word for our lives and i think that's why few people don't enter the straight gate it's just too straight he said in verse 14 straight as the gate narrows the way which death unto life and few be that findeth and then he says in verse 15 beware of false prophets or woe which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly there are raving wolves now a prophet is somebody that's spiritual or acts that way and they have enough word to get your attention but they also have enough of their own interest to deceive you woe unto them who appear to be a christian but their intents are not living for others sheep's clothing but inwardly it's about them and not about others they may speak part of the word but they leave out the part that's the part of responsibility of of living for others and loving others and laying down your life so whoa beware of false prophets woe unto the blind guides they will lead you to calamity are you with me amen another woe jesus talked about luke chapter 6 verse 24 but woe unto you that are rich for you have received your consolation obviously god does not want us to have too much comfort he doesn't it seems like the more that people have the more they have for the devil to use to distract them away from god in fact jesus was warning his disciples about riches in matthew chapter 19 verse 23 and he says verily i say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven well he's not a respecter of persons now he's not biased he's not racist but he knows that riches hinder the majority of the people right true and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god woe unto the rich but humans want to be rich first timothy 6 8 and having food and remnant let us be there with content one of the hardest things to do is to be content but they that will be rich in other words those that says i don't i'm not really interested in being content right now i'm going for it but they that will be rich that have that desire that they're going to go for what's going to happen let's look at the calamity now the walls fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lust which actually drowned men in destruction and perdition so be careful what you're wanting for the love of of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows so strong desire for money leads to calamity to the majority james chapter 5 verse 1 go to now ye rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you so it's just like a pred a prediction it's just a well-known fact paul knows about it james knows about it jesus talked about it uh money is a woe whoa it's okay that we don't have a lot of money it's okay it's really okay because if you had a lot you'd have a lot more problems you just don't realize it yet right it's true so woe means stop heading in that direction another wall here in luke chapter 6 verse 25 woe unto you that are full for you for ye shall hunger want you that laugh now for you shall mourn and weep so obviously god doesn't want us to be too full and he doesn't want us walking around laughing all the time right do you believe that amen i i know i i i'm trying to bring a point i could spend the whole service on one verse but you got to go with me here verse 26 woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets now we all want somebody to say something nice about us but if everybody was doing it you're in trouble right you're in trouble so if somebody doesn't say something nice about you it's okay it's it needs to be that way for you to be right don't feel bad about it so there's a woes here that get you in trouble woe unto them that are in laodicea right revelations 3 verse 14 and the angel of the church of laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful the true witness and beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that you were cold or hot so then because thou art in between lukewarm neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth woe unto them that are lukewarm in laodicea amen if i could say it like this god really hates the taste of uncommitment in his mouth god wants to seek commitment one way or the other but this thing of i am not going to make a decision because i want to go with my flesh and i want to go with god he just so against that because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing sounds like they're at ease huh and know us not that they're rich and miserable poor and blind and naked they don't even know the woe is coming yet woe unto them that say i have need of nothing we don't want that attitude we don't want the the attitude of uh it's okay if i'm not hungry if i'm not thirsting if i'm not seeking because calamity is on the horizon how many are happy that god brought you out of laodicea amen am i talking to the right group amen we heard the angel's messenger we we heard god's messenger the angel to laodicea calling us to come out and and and and to separate and revelations 18 verse 4 says i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues god was speaking from heaven through a messenger and we heard his voice my sheep hear my voice and they follow me amen and we're here today because of it by the grace of god amen but i want to focus on a particular woe tonight it's not being lukewarm in laodicea it's not being taken the easy way in laodicea it's it's taking it easy hanging out with god woe unto them that are ease in zion amen amen zion is the place where god dwells i know this kind of sounds weird doesn't it psalms 132 13 for the lord have chosen zion he have desired it for his habitation amen this is the rest this is my rest forever here will i dwell for i have desired it joel 3 16 joel 3 16 the lord also shall roar out of zion and utter his voice from jerusalem and the heavens and the earth shall shake but the lord will he will be the hope of his people and the strength of the children of israel so shall ye know that i am the lord your god dwelling in zion my holy mountain then shall jerusalem be holy and there shall no strangers pass through here anymore one more isaiah 57 13 the last part of it that he putteth he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountain and shall say up cast ye up prepare ye prepare the way take up the stumbling block out of the way of my people for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabits eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place now this is that holy mountain with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones this holy mountain is where god dwells it's the secret place of the most high amen and from here he roars he utters his voice when god has spoken to you he has spoken amen from mount zion that's that's where the it came from amen now this high and holy place it's filled with humility that's why he dwells only with those of a humble spirit in the heart of the contrite ones he said learning me for i am meek and lowly god hid himself in a human being called jesus born in the stable hid himself from the wise and the prudent now he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land and inherit my holy mountain but woe unto them that are at ease in zion amen not in the world not laodicea but woe unto them that are eased in god's dwelling place in god's house need to stop laying around on god's mountain amen when we hear god roar and utter his voice we need to stand up and do what he told us to do woe to them that are taking it easy where god is living now just as you have rules in your house where you dwell you've got rules i know you do shoes don't go over here don't lay this out take your dishes to the whatever the rules are those are your rules and you want those rules followed well god has rules where he dwells and his rules are you don't take it easy you don't take it easy woe unto them who are taking it easy in zion because there's grief regret angry and ruinous troubles and calamity coming amen you know what the word ease means i i i understand you do go ahead taking it easy just the old what was that the eagles taking it easy honestly that word ease means secure woe to them that are secure in zion boy this is getting deeper into a mystery how could god want us to feel how could god not want us to feel secure dwelling in his place but that word security is not genuine security it's a false sense of security woe to them that have a false sense of security in zion amen whoa whoa whoa we went through the walls we know how bad the walls are so we need to take it seriously about a false sense of security now there is a true doctrine of eternal security where nothing can separate you from the love of god there's a true doctrine of predestination by god's foreknowledge and a true revelation of this doctrine gives the believer true security where nothing can stop him from fulfilling god's eternal purpose that's what that's what it does no matter what the devil throws at them no matter how many times they fall no matter what sin they've committed outside of blasphemy nothing can keep them down nothing can keep them from getting up back up and serving god with all their hearts if they fall seven times seven times they get back up they keep serving god with all their heart a true revelation of eternal security will help you get back up and keep war walking forward with god in the work of the lord that's what it's for it's to keep it's to it's to help you when you fall to know where you belong that's what it does in fact romans 8 1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit but if a believer has only had knowledge of predestination it is most likely puts their flesh at ease in other words i know i'm predestinated it will give them a false security it will make them at ease in zion lukewarm with god neither hot or cold right that's right they feel they can get by with just a form of godliness they don't have to worry about having all the power in their life make them feel like they're in need of nothing that they don't need to work out their salvation with fear and trembling that it's already settled god already paid the price that they don't really have to exercise the humble spirit of i could be wrong they can maybe have to say the words but they don't have to feel it that they really could be wrong come on this is what head knowledge of predestination will do to somebody so there is a false doctrine of eternal security we've heard about it in the other denominations once saved always saved no matter what your attitude is no matter what you decide to do it's already done it's like no accountability in that god's word warns that the believer can have their names taken out of the book of life jude 1 5 says i will therefore put you in remembrance so he once knew this that how that how the lord how that the lord having saved the people of the land of age afterwards destroyed them that believed not so there wasn't too much eternal security in that was it they could testify that god brought them out of egypt did all these miracles they were dancing and they were heaven they were delivered from their the worst demons right it's true but what happened when they didn't continue to keep walking amen amen jesus said he that believeth he that believeth to the end the same shall be saved hebrews 3 6 but christ as a son over his own house whose house we are if we continue to hold fast the confidence and rejoicing of hope firm to the end so we see here that there is a false doctrine of eternal security there is a a false security in zion on god's mountain that we can be at ease in god's house or god's dwelling in it and and god is saying whoa whoa get rid of that lot who walked with the prophet abraham was at ease in zion he chose the easier path because he had a false sense of security i walked with the prophet i i know him but it ended up in calamity we could say whoa onto lot same with balaam balaam was at ease in zion god's prophet he said i speak only those things that god puts in my mouth and god told him not to go but what happened balaam went anyways because he wanted a personal gain and he wanted that more than he wanted god's perfect will because god's prophet will said don't go so he was definitely at ease he was being used by god and at the same time he was he was trying to exercise something that would be personal for him that's being at ease in zion that's without the fear of the lord jude chapter 1 jude chapter 1 why do i still do that i will do that forever because i want to clarify that just in case anybody's doubting there's only one chapter jude 1 verse 10 but these speak evil of those things which they know not but they but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things which they corrupt themselves woe unto them for they have gone the way of cain and ran greedily after the error of balaam they actually ran right towards the air not like stumble over it no they ran for it the air of balaam for reward don't go but he went anyways look at the grief the regret the anguish the calamity that balaam ended up with he was spiritual enough to speak the word of god but carnal enough to talk to a donkey and not repent quickly as soon as he realized i say too many gifted believers make the same error that balaam made i want you to listen this and that mistake is this that while they work for the lord they go after some personal gain at the same time it don't have to be the same volume in the same way in the same gift but look when that's happening you're at ease in zion you're right at ease in zion in god's dwelling these are spots in your feast or charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear like i don't need to do everything i just want to come to church and pick out the part i want lord help us amen lord help us yes woe unto them that are eased right inside of zion that is just hard to comprehend that we could be that tight with god growing in his presence and then be at ease look it's not something i'm making up it's the scriptures brother branham had to answer for this here in uh i just want to read about eight quotes real quick who have believed a report brother it says oh christians pinch the inside man now and wake up to the reality that jesus christ is here to manifest himself to you he's here but he says pinch the inside man and the message jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever he says oh brother sister why do you come so numb in your spirit why do you come so numb in your spirit lord jesus i pray in and may the people as it was pinch their spirit by the word of god and wake up and realize that this is the hour of visitation in the message the seal of god brother and says pinch your spiritual being dear brother amen pinch your soul as it was with prayer and say lord jesus check up on me let me take inventory tonight before i go to bed and find out what's the matter with me i've been professing for years and i don't see these things that jesus said that he would be with me and these things would go on i don't see them what's the matter lord jesus he said be honest be sincere come down and talk to him face to face with a brother i'll reveal you i'll tell you tear your soul apart and lay it out there and say lord jesus if it cost me my family if it cost me my life if it cost me my job if it cost me my membership if it costs me the prestige in the city i'll take the way of the lord's despise to you right amen sirs we would see jesus brother bran says no don't pinch your flesh now remember many times sitting in church when i wasn't a preacher when i wasn't preaching up here and i'd be listening and i would be so tired i'd be falling asleep and i'd have to bite my tongue and i'd pinch my flesh to try to stay awake i don't know if you ever did that i did that it was a way to kind of wake up don't go to sleep and sometimes i've had to do that driving right you know you're getting real tired and you got to do something throw down your window but when was i pinched my flesh but brother brian i'm saying here's now don't pitch your flesh but pinch your soul with the word amen wake up lord open my eyes what's the matter with me i'm missing this what the preacher's trying to get to me i'm trying to get this he's given us a way how we can get out of our flesh and into the spirit and and get a hold of god amen don't be at ease in zion handwriting on the wall brother man says don't the bible say that that would be that way that they'd be heading high minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god true breakers incontinent fears and despisers of those that are right with god what a day that we're living in now i want you to pinch your spiritual conscience message abraham brother bram says oh why be so gross amen just have faith don't you see friends can you wake up pentecostal people won't you bite your conscience won't you pinch your soul i mean he's really just you know and a lot of times we're just looking at the outward appearance of things you know what i mean god deals with the inside of us in the message perfect faith brother bran says the devil has put everything in the world before you to try to keep you from believing it he'll bring it in a meeting and try to throw everything he can right in front of you he said shake it away from you the bible says rise and shake yourself pinch yourself sometimes we just well we'll just let it go by don't need to really dig in i don't understand it it's just almost late i'm tired you can't do that that's you know brother branham is teaching us what we need to do but if we don't practice this then we're really at ease in zion and we don't realize it but i'll say woe unto you amen and the last one here brother brahm said in the message desperations this one's often quoted uh in the message you can't be desperate until god speaks to you i love that you can't be desperate until god speaks to you so what do you have to do brother branham says oh church rise and shake yourself amen in other words if you really want god to deal with you you've got to shake yourself god didn't put us in a state of ease we did and he's expecting us to get out of it pinch your conscience wake yourself up in this hour we must be desperate or a perish there is coming forth something from the lord i know it is as thus saith the lord there is coming for something and we better get desperate it's between life and death and it will pass through us and we won't see it whoa in other words it's going to happen no matter what but if we aren't serious about being vigilant about our spiritual walk then it's going to pass us by right because we're going to fall if we're not vigilant we're going to fall into this at ease and the only time that we get uh uh up and going is if somebody around us is creating that atmosphere of doing it we can't do that you can't wait to come to church to pray you can't wait to come to church you've got to dig into christ amen romans chapter 13 verse 11 and that now the time and that knowing the time that now is the high time to wake out of our sleep so we read some quotes that brother branham said now we're going to read the scriptures about it for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed the night is first but the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let's walk honestly in the day not riding in drunkenness not chambering that wanting us not in strife and envy see these are signs of being at ease that's what these are these are signs of of being at ease but put you on the lord jesus christ and make that provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof amen first corinthians chapter 15 verse 33 sorry there's a lot of scriptures tonight i have a lot of stuff to go through and that's kind of why i'm going so fast but hopefully it's okay the bible says be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners yes i'll say like this be careful how you communicate verse 34 now awake to righteousness awake to righteous i'll just say awake out of ease amen because when you're at ease you're sinning right yeah it's true so awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god i speak this to your shame and one more here in ephesians chapter 5 verse 14 wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light see that you walk circumspectly not as fools in other words you know you're walking vigilant you know where you're standing but as wise how what does a wise person do he redeems the time he doesn't sit around waiting for the coming of the lord he's redeeming the time that's wise because the days are evil we're for be not ye unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is the lord wants us working and he wants us laboring for the kingdom he doesn't want us taking it easy in his dwelling house just sitting there taking it easy being with god whoa right amen did i give you enough scriptures yet now i'm going to keep giving them amen because i want you to go i don't want you to doubt this message amen it's amazing to me how many people are waiting around for i don't know what they're waiting around for right when it comes to god they're just waiting for they're at ease in zion turn with me if you went to luke chapter 9 verse 11. now if you would turn with me if you would on this one or you could watch on the board but i want to read this whole parable here salvation had just come to the house of zacchaeus and jesus in in the the scripture starts here in verse 11 for us and as they heard these things that what happened in zacchaeus house he added and spake a parable because there was a reason he was nine to jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear so the reason that jesus was sharing this parable is because of their attitude that they had about god coming soon he's giving them the mind of christ on this subject he's teaching them to be god-conscious that's why he's given this parable and in verse 12 he says he said therefore a certain noble men went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return and he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds and said unto them occupy till i come in other words don't be at ease in zion but as citizens they hated them in other words they'd really rather be at ease rather be at ease and send a message after him saying we will not have this man to reign over us so i'm not going to church i'm not going to read the message i'm not going to dig into what this is really telling me i'm just going to only read the bible listen to tapes for the things that i've been i'm looking for i'm not interested in the whole word i'm just interested in the word that makes me helps me gives me what i want imagine that there's something about god's word that you hate that means there's something about god you hate you've got to love the word love it with all your heart amen the flesh is never ever going to be excited about crucifix being crucified romans 8 verse 7 says because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be and that's why we have to crucify ourselves that's why we have to deny ourselves daily because we it just won't be subject to god so he gives them this message of occupy till i come he doesn't tell him exactly what to do he he just wants him to go do something the word occupy means to busy oneself it also means if you look it up there i did in the greek it means to trade this word occupy means to trade if i said occupy you know i want you to come over uh brother mark you're gonna come over you're gonna watch your house while we're gone i want you to if i'm gonna pay you i want to occu i want you to occupy i don't want you to lay around watch tv all the time i want you to to do something constructive when i come home i want to be very happy with you occupying or you be wasting your time are you with me you follow the example what i'm saying here so what jesus is really saying he says trade your time trade your gifts trade your talents trade your money with the purpose of bringing god an increase it's not about us it's not about us showing off what we got from god it's about bringing something back to god that he didn't have before he gave it to us he's looking for something more amen otherwise we're at ease in zion that's true verse 15 and it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom then he commanded notice he commanded he commanded these servants to be called for accountability unto him to whom he had given the money and that he might know how much every man had gained by trading think about that anybody that's involved in the stock market had the idea of putting money in there hoping to get something greater in return and most of the stories we hear about are those that put all this money into bitcoin and they lost everything right we hear a lot of those stories now we see a lot of those stories now nobody is going to ever put money into something hoping they don't get nothing out of it so god never gives you a gift hoping to get nothing out of it right it's true right amen he never gave you a lifetime for you to take that life and not get nothing out of it because if we think like that we're at ease in zion we see god's mind and his purpose here for all of our lives he wants us to take whatever he has given us and bring again back to his kingdom now we're not taking anything with us to heaven outside of one our character and two who we brought in to jesus and we're talking about the kingdom of god he is not interested in my money amen he's not interested in any kind of thing that i can muster up and entertain and like i'm not bringing that i'm not bringing anything i've collected bought worked for i'm not bringing it to heaven enough bringing it to the kingdom amen so we must be talking about something his kingdom is invisible right it doesn't come with observation you don't even see it so if we're going to give something back to that kingdom right amen yes my character has to be there i can't enter in i got to have perfect love but it's not about me he didn't give us what we got just for us if we did the word would never spread so we we've got to take what we've got with the mindset of getting to increase god's kingdom amen verse 16 then came the first saying lord thy pound have gained 10 pounds he was working he was working and he said unto them well thou ha wow thou good servant because thou has been faithful with the little life i've given you have thou authority over ten cities so notice the reward came according to the works this is important down here we're all given different gifts we can't do nothing about it there's nothing there i'm telling you there is no way that i could be a um a donny reagan there's no way i could play uh guitar alike whoever's a good guitar player i can only do what i can do because that's all god made me but the thing is my reward comes from my labors not if i had something more to labor with you understand i'm saying and it's not how talented you are but it's how you use your talent you can use it five minutes a week you can use it five hours a week you can use it five days a week you can give yourself to god and get a a big return or you can not that's you that choice is yours and what's so beautiful about this is you know it's all free more agency but the people that got a false understanding about eternal security and where they're at with god could be a lot more at ease thinking that they're going to get more out of it than they really do and the second came saying lord thy pound have gained five pounds and he said unto him he said likewise to him be thou also over five cities so again being rewarded for what he brought to the kingdom and another came saying lord behold here is thy pound what an insult can you imagine bringing making somebody some something to eat or giving us some candy and a week later they just give it back to you right you know what i mean that that just like lord you weren't worthy of me trying any harder than this lord behold here is thy pound which i have kept laid up in the napkin that was not the right thing to say nor do lord behold here is thy pound which i have laid up in a napkin i say woe unto you that are at ease in zion amen because that's what this is a picture of to me and now he begins to to pour out his excuses for being lazy being at ease not working not trading to get gain for his master he says for i feared thee i feared thee how can you fear the one that gave you the gift i feared thee it wasn't because of the gift but his expectation because thou art an austere man which means strict in manner and attitude harsh having no comforts or luxuries god don't want us too comfortable in zion he wants us with the fear of god i could be wrong lord what else would you have me to do when it comes to god's judgment god is not describing himself here as a loving god full of grace no sir remember in the book of revelations brother brahm talking about him on judgment his hair was white as woe he's there to bring judgment and here he's looking for the accountability of his servants there's no love and grace at this point the love and grace that they had was all their life that's when they had the grace of god that's when god showed the love he gave them a a period of time a space of time and that was their grace and that love but there will come a time for all of us to give accountability of our time he says for i feared thee verse 21 because thou art ulsterous an austere man thou take us up where thou last not down and rapists where thou did us not so man that sounds so unfair of god i mean when we see somebody trying to take credit for something we did you know we think that's not right that's not right but in reality he's the potter we're the clay he can expect anything he wants out of us and he's always right and he sayeth unto them out of thine own mouth will i judge you and he says you're a wicked servant think about that now he didn't take his his talent and go use it on the devil right he didn't turn into an elvis presley or a beatles he just didn't use his gift for the lord and he was called a wicked servant for it thou knew us that i was an austere man taken up that i laid not down and raping that i did not sow wherefore he's asked this question then gave us not thou my money my talent that i gave to you that at my coming into the bank that at my coming i i might have required my own with a little bit that's what you do when you put your money in the bank these days you don't get much interest but we used to get more interest he would get something if you would place yourself and come under subjection to somebody who you will let them use you to use your gift to get something accomplished for the kingdom but i'll say it's nothing compared to how god can use you because you're only at church so long but you've got your whole life to live for god amen you got the times that you're not here to be given yourself and be winning souls for god amen but if you just did it here at church at least it could be used to get a little something he was too scared to go out trade his time to gain a soul for god's kingdom he'd rather be at ease and zion we've all dealt with this we've all felt you know what i just as soon stay home from church i just assume you know what it ah somebody else can do it it's not the attitude that you're having at the church friends it's not the attitude that you're having towards somebody else you want to take care of that situation for you or whoever you feel only maybe it's just the missionaries that are safe souls i don't know how you think but you have a life you have gifts that god gave you you have talents you have a desire to be in zion but you can't be there at ease woe unto them that are at ease so it's not just being in zion being in god's presence in joy no you've got to get to a place where you let god use you are you with me all right and he said unto them that stood by take from him that pound and give it to him that had ten pounds whoa and he said unto him lord he has already got ten pounds for i say unto you that unto every one which have shall be given and from him that have not even that he have shall be taken away from him but those my enemies which would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me god woe unto them now notice these that wouldn't allow god to use them a lot regularly they didn't get in trouble to the end so all along they didn't think they were going to get in trouble now after the first day when he left and came back he said you know what this is going to happen but he didn't do that right he doesn't do that to any of us he just says have given your life occupy go go occupy and remember the gift didn't come from satan we were in our at our men's meeting we were talking about the the the things that uh come down to our generations that we got to deal with sometimes god is the only one that gives us gifts and times the gift of life so we we have to return back to him so we we we deal with making this decision every day am i just going to do my thing as long as i'm not doing bad it should be okay are we going to be wise redeem the time you know that's our choice this man was unwise the first two were wise this man was unwise balaam was unwise lot was unwise it's unwise just to to believe it in a doctrine a predestination if it's only head knowledge because head knowledge is not going to get you back up working for the lord that's right but a true revelation from god on predestination will get you back up working for the lord where if you've got a head knowledge you're just going to get back up and do your own thing all right remain vigilant amen we're winding down second corinthians chapter six verse one it's time for us to go out amen to get uncomfortable a little bit god don't want us too comfortable in zion i know it sounds like an oxymoron but it's really really not it's a paradox is what it is god wants us comfortable right but he doesn't want us to comfortable there's a balance all right we then as workers together with him we're working with jesus beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain in other words keep working for he saith i have heard thee in a time accepted in the day of salvation have i suckered thee behold now is the acceptable time behold now is the day of salvation this now you may be saved you may be saved and you are saved you come out you're in the message of the hour you're in zion but we need to work together because this is still the day of salvation for somebody right so you give no offense in anything i i a lot of times when we're trying to accomplish something and we're not getting what we want very easy we can go on the offense try a little pressure try a little manipulation try a little this and that and i'm not going to talk to you and this and that and try to accomplish what you want but what happens in the long run is the ministry gets blamed you get blamed for doing that you shouldn't done that you shouldn't have you shouldn't talk to me that way you could have handled it different i didn't i understood that what you were saying was right but it's the way that you said it that offended me you understand what he's saying here giving no offense and anything that the ministry be not blamed this is you you all got a ministry but in all things you're proving ourselves as the ministers of god now how do we do it not just saying we're right but you do it in patience you're you're willing to take some affliction you're willing to feel the necessity of being approved in distresses this is how you approve yourself i'll say paul was not a man at ease in zion amen paul was about the father's business amen in stripes imprisonments and turmoils and laborers and watches and fastings now we do some of those but some of those might be just you know people talking behind our back people giving us the cold shoulder i think the more we we we labor for the lord the more the devil hates you right you got to have thick stand thick skin and the devil will use somebody to get at you in stripes imprisonments and turmoils and labors and watchings and fastings by pureness it doesn't matter you say pure by knowledge by long suffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeigned by the word of truth by the power of god by the arm of righteousness on the right hand and on the left this is how you go win a soul praise the lord you love jesus that's amazing to me how many people are walking around today without a vision about occupying right now second corinthians chapter five verse nine too many are at ease in zion remember jesus said we don't know what hour he's coming but be ready watch be ready and i'll say one so if we knew jesus was coming in in 2023 let's say that we would obviously start doing more than we're doing right our lives would all change a little bit if we really really knew but what do we have to present to him when he asks us what did you do with the time that i've given you the talents i've given you so it really doesn't matter if we know when he's coming right what really really matters is that we're faithful to do what he wants us to do and he comes whenever he wants to come okay second corinthians 5 9 wherefore we labor wherefore we labor that we that whether we're present or absent we may be accepted that we may be accepted of him so whether we're dead or whether we're alive whether we're with you not with you this state that state we labor and why do we labor that we may be accepted of him because we just heard the parable if we don't want to labor we want to just take our our life and wrap it up with ourselves and be at ease we're not going to be accepted he says for we must also appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive of the things done in his body according the way i've done whether it be good or bad knowing therefore this is really how god is and also austere man knowing therefore the terror of the lord we get busy we go to work we persuade men because i want to be accepted i can't just say well i did all this but nobody came i don't believe that i don't believe that right god will give you the fruits of labor we need to remain vigilant last scripture first corinthians 15 58 therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord praise the lord now that parable that jesus gave and they got 10 more pounds i wonder has anybody ever tried investing in something and it didn't work okay i have i've been i've invested more than i want to tell you how many's ever tried so you didn't get that pound for the lord that's the thing i want to say there now how about tried really sharing jesus with somebody but they just said after all the time that you spent they're just no thank you so i would imagine those ones that brought ten pounds and those that brought five pounds that they really tried a lot more right so paul said i became all things to all men that i might win some but woe unto them that are at ease in zion we don't want to be that that group and it's an individual affair it's an individual affair but i i'll just say it like this let's help one another get going share some testimonies and promote one another to good works how many pounds you got for our our master we're going to be seeing them very soon you know let's try to try to do this because this is not something that is talked about a lot right this is not the the mainstream of of of of things but yet it's something that all of us are going to have to give an account for so it's important to god amen let's stand together to think that here is the place in zion that god speaks he dwells he lives it's the hiding place it's where god is at and that we could be right there at ease what a paradox and he's just saying don't leave don't leave zion just don't get too comfortable think serious about your responsibility and let let's let's get something for the king i just think it's beautiful he our god is not a lazy guy just one is just kind of floating around he doesn't want that he every one of us if we gave our our children i don't care if it's a hundred dollars a thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars we would want them to use it wisely right and if you you sent one to the store you wouldn't want them coming 50 bucks coming back with 50 bucks of candy you know you'd want them to use it right so it's just god wanting us to use our time it really belongs to him you use it for him amen all right let's let's sing um burn burn holy spirit burn in me
