just Believers and we need to look for him not in just the natural word that's going to be preached but the unveiling of that word amen the revealing of it to making it personal to you and he's here this amazing thing that God loves us all the same amen he doesn't have a love for one person more special than the other does us all the same and we just we've got to look for the word that he has for us amen the word that he has for brother Ron won't help me it's spiritual food in due season let's Stand Together how many's uh been praying for the service today amen we are we are very honored uh

in India um they don't like to take pictures over there because of just certain reasons we won't get into but they don't like pictures being taken or else we would probably have more pictures but when he would be alone then some pictures can be taken but when you're in in a group and lots of different people there's just certain people who get the wrong ideas but a picture paints a thousand words and we've been blessed by the pictures that he has been able to send us but uh this morning he's come to minister to us amen and I believe that God is going to use him and I don't want to miss my opportunity I don't want to miss this day of visitation God's coming to visit send the light amen and I don't want to miss the part that he has for me so let's let's sing only believe and and believe

stand with us and to pray for us and to support us in everything we do and we sure appreciate your love and your mercy and also your kindness you know uh the word of God says in the eyes of God and in the eyes of people you know so we need to find favor and God has been so good to us that uh we are getting favor from wherever we go and uh that's the goodness of God that's the grace of God um I want to just go directly into the word maybe later uh before I sit down I would like to talk few moments about what we do in India let us give preeminence to the word of God you so the testimonies are there and uh you know there are so many things which we can speak of or spoken of but you know let us look to the word before you know it's too late you know so Genesis chter 17 verse 1 to 4 Genesis 17 verse 1-4 and when Abraham was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations amen I would like to also read from Matthew chap 5 verse 48 Matthew 5: 48 Jesus said said be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect may the Lord bless the reading of his holy word uh you can sit down and thank you so much for your patience and also for everything I have not come here with uh any other Doctrine or any other message but you know I have come with what the prophet has already spoken to this age thank God for the propit of this hour you know thank God for the message of this hour I don't know myself where I would be without this message and uh truly we are such a privileged people today uh that we are still walking in the light of this day rejecting the light of this hour or this day is going to put everybody in trouble you know I don't know how people can walk away from this message I don't know what else they have to preach outside this message so in fact this is a message you know but praise God thank God for the message you know so so that's true that we serve a living God today you know we have a great God you know I would like to talk about you know for few minutes or few moments you know um I won't keep you long but I want to just encourage my brothers and my sisters on you know a perfect walk you know we all walk with God Amen we all have been walking with God you know there are times in my life in my Ministry where many people come to me and uh you know they say oh uh brother boas you know or man of God I have been you know Walking with God for many years you know and uh you know I never stopped and that's true you know the devil wants us to stop you but God does doesn't want us to stop he wants us to move forward amen because when we stop then we are either the prophet of God said we are backslid you know and we can't stop but we need to move on you know amen it doesn't matter when we fall or fail in our lives you know but you know we need to realize and recognize the day we are in you know and we need to try to stand up you know and start moving again the problem the total problem today the human beings or mankind is having is we are totally stopping you know little differences we stop the church little differences we try to you know make uh barriers you know our own groups our own camps but I want to tell you that our little differences should not stop us from fellowshipping with God his word and his people you know we need we need Fellowship you know in the uniting time and sign of the end the prophet of God said we need more Fellowship we need more of his word we need more of the prayer meetings you know I was just going through the the message of the hour you know and you know the prophet of God says we are living in the shadows of his coming you know the other day I was just telling you know remembering what the prophet said we are 3 Minutes to Midnight you know but after the church service or was over somebody came a brother I don't know him but he said brother it's no more 3 Minutes to Midnight it's 98 seconds you know I said brother I don't know what calculations are those but I truly believe you know the prophet said it's 3 Minutes to Midnight you know so whether it is 98 seconds or 60 seconds one thing we need to recognize today the day we are living in we are living in the shadows of his coming you know Discerning the body of the Lord 59 he says can't you see them threats you think about talk about the threats today you know the prophet discerned it many years ago and he said look at the threats which are now you know he was talking about that in 59 so just see how dangerous it is today amen everywhere you walk everywhere you go there is lot of threats you know it's not safe outside and if there is only one place where there is safety and that's the house of God Amen you this is the place of safety this is a place of you know peace right this is the place where we can Joy you know this is the place we also can get corrected amen if you want to be corrected this is the only place where correction can be done where lives can be set in order you know he says can't you see them threats you see what they have got he says the nation is trying to drink it off laugh it off you can't do it the world can do but we as Believers can't do it he says they are doing that to keep from taking the spiritual discernment that God can show them the handwriting on the wall we know it's there you can crack it off with jokes and Hollywood television or stay home and Dicker with that if you want to but look what the prophet said but a real born again man or woman that's God discernment of the Holy Ghost will find his place in church worshiping and crying out and doing all that in his life to try to bring in Sinners certainly if it is God LS you should put your heart in it whatever we do whether we are singing Let Us put our heart if we are playing let us put our heart if you are you know leading the worship or you know we are a worship leader or a hearer or a doer let us do it with all our heart amen God is looking not at the available at the ability today is looking at the availability are you available for Christ are you ready to do what you what God wants you to do you know am God wants all of it you know he wants everything of us you know you know because what God has the prophet of God said what God had God the father had he poured out in Christ what Christ had he poured out in the bride and now what is the bride need to do today it's a giving back time am we need to give back what Christ has poured in his bride this is the time to rise and shine this is the time to stand up and move on Amen so that the others who are in darkness can get the light I really like that is it a real born again man or a woman that God discernment of the Holy Ghost will find his place in church worshiping and crying out and and doing all that in his life to try to bring in Sinners amen certainly if it's God you should put your heart in it yes if you got discernment he says work he says just don't go and say yes I believe that that's the truth that's good amen he says go home go to work amen you have got discernment work while it's light am for the night cometh when no man can work work while we got an Open Door amen work while we can have meetings like this prophet of God in one place he said many people have got Campground cramps type cramp ground uh camp ground crims you will know what he says he says not even one Revival is over you know they tried to go back into the world you know many people are living in a cycle today you know Sunday they are born again but Monday to Saturday they are gone again that's true you amen it's only Sunday when we sit in the pews and listen to the word of God we say praise God God spoke to me God is dealing with me oh my brothers my sister what about Monday to Saturday if we are born again on Sunday we need to see that we are born again on Monday Tuesday wednessday Thursday Friday and Saturday oh we have we have been so busy my brothers my sister I don't know about you people I don't know brother John about the Believers here but you know we have learned The Art of Doing Nothing are you hearing me amen have learned The Art of Doing Nothing you call anybody and and ask them they say I am busy brother busy for what busy for nothing what have you achieved by keeping yourself busy you know I think my brothers my sisters we need to recognize we need to discern the time we are living in it says work while it's light the Bible says work while it's day before the night is coming as you sang Brother Bruce it's later than you think the bride is getting ready the bride has made herself ready you amen the filthy are becoming filthy the worldly are becoming worldly the holy are becoming holy the Believers are trying to get close with God no matter what is happening the people who are sending the the light are sending the light the people who want to live their lives in darkness they are living in darkness this is the time of discernment this is the time of recognition this is the time of recognizing who we are realizing the importance of this day the importance of this message work while we got an Open Door brother sister just two and a half months ago just not far from my church about 80 to 100 people were worshiping in a church 300 people from the Hindu activist groups they came and they vandalized the church they they broke down everything they B the people they were blind in that church they were lame they were disabled in the church they don't even care for those people they came with sticks and stones they put the church on fire they B the pastor and the pastor died on the spot you talk about persecution ask me what is persecution what is happening the doors are being shut it is later than we think this is the time to rise up from our situation this is the time to stand up this is the time to move move from glory to glory amen amen very soon we are going to meet at a destination is the Valley of the shadow of death he says either you will meet him as a masterpiece whom he has worked upon or you will meet him as a drift wood a piece of drift wood drifting on the water doesn't know its destination amen Prophet says don't spend your time buying this and buying that buying homes and buying cars and buying clothes this is not the time my brothers my sister this is the time to walk with god with a perfect heart it doesn't matter how many times you fall and fail but you should be in a position you should rise up and start walking you may say brother boas nobody's walk is perfect that's true I believe it I I agree with you nobody's walk is perfect the Bible itself makes it clear that we are all sinners you so what is the definition of perfection brother I can tell you that the definition of perfection is according to scripture is complete yes uprightness without being spot or blemished totally obedient not only totally obedient but as we progress we need to constantly obedient to the word of God Amen there is obedience and there is delayed obedience that's true we are human beings when God wants it sometimes we do it now but sometimes we take our own time and then we say and complain say Lord I have done what you have said no delayed obedience is not obedience it is Disobedience am what we need is total commitment total obedience total you know completeness without spot without blemish oh God wants us to walk with him with a perfect heart a perfect heart is a responsive heart it can quickly you know if you have a perfect heart you can react to the whisperings of God and to the warnings of God Amen sometimes we only want to hear his whisper we don't want his warning but I want to tell you my brothers my sister God doesn't judge anybody without warning right he gives warning and then he judges his people amen and if you have a perfect heart if you know that your heart is perfect and you want to walk with God you will always be attentive say Lord I am attentive show me the path to go in and I will walk in it Hallelujah man judges Perfection by outward performance true but God judges the hner hard what we need today to with God my brothers my sisters what qualification do we need today the only qualification we need today is to be hungry and thirsty for the word of God the psalmist says As the deer panted for the water Brooks so my heart so my soul longth after thee look at the life of Abraham 19 [Applause] years 99 years God commanded him he said walk before me I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect you know and Lord the prophet said Lord by this time has pitch this tent toward Sodom the other day I preached a message in India to the youth people young people which side you have pitched your tent amen God was speaking to Abraham and by this time Lo he pitched his tent towards Sodom amen you know Abraham was called for a separation my brothers my sister if you and I are elected of God chosen of God for orded of God I want to tell you no matter how far you go from God God will bring you back he will bring your children he will bring your husband he'll bring your wife you don't have to worry about anything Hallelujah many parents comes to me this says this is my situation of my son my daughter we are worried no you don't be worried about anything if you have sown the seed in them when they were little the Bible says pain up a child the way they should go when they grow up even though they will depart you know but they will come back again my brothers my sisters Abraham was called for a separation to SJ as a pilgrim and a stranger approached to God 55 he says with what a promise that God was going to bless the World by him amen Abraham 75 Sarah being 65 you know and I like this he say while L Was preparing for tribulation Abraham Was preparing for a body change isn't that good amen Lord Was preparing himself for tribulation but Abraham Was preparing for a body change what are we doing today the bride is getting ready it's later than we think it's the time to stand up it's time to rise up and shine Hallelujah it's time to walk with god with a perfect heart it says when we walk we need to walk by God's provided way yes amen am he has provided us a way amen and we need to accept his way which God has provided for us oh my brothers my sister as you walk we need to trust in God's provision and in God's grace I truly believe we are the part of the provision of God Amen you and I are the part of the provision which God has made we you and I are the provision of God's provided way you and I are provision of God's providing Grace amen that's why his word says his Mercy is new every morning you may say brother boys how do I walk I have so many things in my life that's true we have so many things hanging around us business has become everything family has become everything wife has become everything husband has become everything you know we have 33 million gods and goddesses in our country but I tell you there is lot of gods and goddesses even in America our business have become God our children our family our everything our cars our houses everything has become Gods it's become an idol amen you believe it or not you agree with me or not that's trth trth we need to give our time to God the best we can he's looking at you whether are you available today we need to walk with him I'm not coming here to judge anybody or point my finger to anybody body but I have come here as I stand in this place I may not look like you I may not talk like you I may not be like you but I want to tell you my brothers my sister that God has put it on my shoulder a responsibility to tell the truth no matter he swore by himself 54 walk as you walk in Christ walk with him unconscious of the world you're here to fulfill it right just walk unconscious of fear unconscious of criticism unconscious unto the world walk with him not paying any attention to the right or to the left if the doctors tell you are dying walk with God if your neighbors don't like you walk with God if sickness strikes you walk with God Just Keep On Walking with God Amen you may say brother boys since the time I started walking with God troubles have come in and people come I baptized I baptized 38 people since January 1 till today and people come to me say brother boys if I get baptized if I accept this message will God bless me will God give everything to me I said he will give but not now amen the first thing he will do is he will put you through test through fire it's a refining process he will send you through the Refiner's Fire and that's good for us when we go through that fire it's good for us when we take and he takes us to the ups and downs and to the valley the dark Valley that's good for us you know Victory Day 63 he said you are not a God bed plant amen you're not hybrid you are a real Christian amen when it looks like everything's gone wrong God's giving you a trial why he's giving you a trial because he's God confidence in you you don't have to baby you around you are not a hard bed plan a hybrid you are a real Christian God's giving you a test to see what you will do about it amen amen Peter said these fiery trials count it a joy amen we all have to go through ups and downs in life but my brothers my sisters the only thing we need to realize today we need to keep on walking Enoch one day walked like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with God got so far up the road he didn't want to come back [Applause] anymore God has promised you I will never leave you nor forsake you I will be with you till the end of the world thank God for the Holy Ghost today thank God for the Holy Ghost fire today what was the Holy Ghost given for 59 he says it's to give unction to the preachers it's to give Holiness to the group it's to set the Church in order if anything which can set our lives our church in order it's the Holy Ghost AM we sing that song it's the Holy Ghost and Fire that's keeping me alive keeping me alive keeping me alive that's true for a True Believer is the Holy Ghost which keeps Us Alive am it's to bring a Unity of a spirit it's to unite us together with power it's to unite us together with love and brotherly kindness Hallelujah he says I don't care if you're a Methodist or a Baptist or Presbyterian Lutheran whatever you are if you have all been by one Holy Spirit baptized into one body and become the members of the body of Jesus Christ there is nothing present nothing future nothing hunger starvation nothing can separate us from the of God and the love of Christ amen the love of God that's in Christ because we are bound of his Spirit we are washed in his blood amen we are the new creature that's what God came to do that's what the holy spirit is for amen the word of God came to Abraham the prophet said in believing God he says Abraham didn't have any great cloud of witnesses like like we have he was an idol worshipper he was a chen out from the city of w he said he was called out from amongest people to walk in a Strange Land This is how beautiful that types the Christian walk today that we have to come out from our Associates of the world to walk in this Strange Land This is a Strange Land for us we are Heavenly bound we are home bound we are not Earthly bound that's why we sing that song this world is not my home I'm just a passing through the Heavenly bridegroom is waiting for the Earthly bride the Earthly bride is waiting for that Heavenly bridegroom he said come quickly Lord I'm not preparing for a tribulation so are you we are all preparing for a body change when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise and the one who is alive in Christ shall rise up shall be taken tribulation is not our destination amen strange to the first land that we walked in and the land that we call today is walk in the Christian way walk with Christ separate ourself from the things of the world Abraham he did it by faith and he CED in a Strange Land not even knowing where he was going the only thing God said come out Abraham and go to the land and he was look looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God that's right amen God made a covenant with Abraham it was an unconditional Covenant amen Jehovah jyra he was 75 and Sarah 65 before God ever spoke to him and make the Covenant with him and God said walk before me and be thou perfect oh God made the Covenant with Abraham it was an unconditional Covenant with any condition without any condition he said if you'll do this I'll do that he made a covenant with man once like that and Adam broke it you know man breaks his promise God can't break his promise that's right so God determined to save him he made the Covenant to Abraham unconditionally the Covenant was not only made to Abraham but it was also to the seed of Abraham you may say brother Boaz I a gentile but the Bible says when we are dead in Christ we take on Abraham's seed and our hairs according to the promise amen let me make this statement to you if you are a church member it don't mean you are an Abraham seed but if you are born again by the Holy Spirit you are the Seed of Abraham and the faith that Abraham was you have dwells in you my brothers my sisters no matter how encouraging or discouraging rather it seems Abraham still refused to see anything but what God Said was the truth if we call ourself Abraham's seed and doubt everything God says nearly can't trust from one night to the other you see what a poor subjects we are to be the Church of the the Living God Amen but as we walk in this walk we are not looking at the circumstance we are looking at the promise you know the prophet of God says you know Abraham and Sarah going to the doctor's office and the doctor ask them why have you come here Abraham again he says I want a baby the doctor looks at both of them he says are they gone crazy at this age you want a baby you know but the prophet said Abraham did not look at the circumstance he did not look at the wrinkles you know the the the the you know the body which was worn out outside he was looking at the promise am the doctor was looking of the outside of Abraham but God was looking on the inside of Abraham the inside was changing and that's what we need today it's not the outward appearance our inner inner life should change according to the word and the will and the purpose of God we are here for a purpose let us not look at the circumstances let us look at the promise of God Noah was faithful to God he walked with God in a perfect manner without even seeing a rain drop he started building the [Applause] ark God said Noah you build it I will fill it and you must build it according to the plan of God's word and his will oh David determined in his heart to obey to the Lord to be perfect amen that's why in Psalm 1012 he says I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way I will walk within my house with a perfect heart but when it comes to Solomon he fell short of God's command to be perfect his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God as his father David First Kings 9:4 the word of God says if thou will walk before me as David thy father walked in Integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that I've commanded thee and will keep my statutes and my judgments Paul also writes in his epistle he says that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus amen he says that he may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God Amen Colossians 4:12 we need to keep on journeying we can't stop I want to tell you my brothers my sister if something is hindering you from worshiping God if something is hindering you from Walking with God you better stay away from that am it might be anything it might be the most dearest thing of your life I don't say quit everything and just start you know know sit in the church all your life no I always tell my church I always tell people wherever I go live work hard as you work for another 100 years but you be ready as if you're going to go the next hour that's very important today we need to keep on journeying the prophet of God said the mark of the beast he says Israel had to keep journeying when they stopped they backslid in that message he says don't try to build upon some other he says you can't build a fire on the same ground Israel had to keep journeying when they stopped they backslid he says they had to keep moving every night amen they built a new fire every night they just kept on moving and that's what we need to do he says what Luther had was fine that was for Luther's day what Wesley had was fine that was for Wesley day what Holiness had that was for their day we are living in another day am you know what the prophet of God said we are living in the glare of another light people are living in the glare of another day 40 50 years ago so true and the prophet of God said that's a mirage what is a mirage that's the false light of the sun right you go near you know as you go on that Highway you see that there is light but when you go near there's nothing it's fake and that's what the devil has to offer today to everyone that's why I tell everybody I encourage the young people especially All That Glitters Is Not God Amen we can't live in a mirage we can't live in a fake light and that's what the devil has done he has robbed people by showing them this fake light we must move on and there will be a day after us it will come just the same let's walk in that light while the light is there the prophet of God said we are living in a neurotic age that's true it's the battle field of the mind I go to hospital brother sometimes to pray for people in the hospital once in a month one Friday I go and you know what I see no other doctors most of them they don't have many patients but one doctor I know he's a neurosurgeon he's a specialist every day he comes at about 8:00 in the morning and he goes midnight that many people are being suffering with neurolog neurological problems what is the devil doing he has taken the mind amen what God does he has taken your heart Hall devil chose your mind but God chose your heart amen a perfect heart he wants us to walk with a perfect heart we are living in a neurotic age it's the Battlefield of the Mind If the devil if he can't catch us in one way he will try another he will never allow us to unite together in one Accord Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 55 he says don't be satisfied with your fire which was built last night don't be satisfied with your fire built here from last night he said let's build it a little further up the road tonight never build it in the same place you can't stand still you are either backsliding or you're going forward amen you know the greatest Commission God gave to the church was go forward don't stop just keep on moving Elijah 55 he says I think the church ought to have a commission like that go forward don't you stop just keep on moving when this revival closes start another one somewhere amen don't wait don't wait around just keep moving for God just keep on moving cuz people are dying we ain't got no time to hang around we got to go forward and don't slack a bit remember I spoke to you about Campground crams he says that's what the matter with the people today they got the camp ground cramps they go to a Revival and have a great time the first thing you know a little after that before another Revival would come along they are back in the world again right notice you can't make yourself anything different from what God intended you to be anything else is an impersonation therefore if your conversion is only because you are trying to hide behind something or trying to make yourself a better person you are playing the part of a hypocrite first Peter 510 it says the God of all Grace who have called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that he have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle here Psalm 25:14 says the secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him and He will show them his Covenant amen he wants to perfect us he wants to establish us he wants to strengthen us he want to settle us amen what we need today is a word Revival in the end time the spoken word which became the written word the written word has become the Living Word right we can't compromise with anything the prophet said don't compromise when it comes to glorifying God worshiping God when you do it the glory of God will manifest God doesn't need people he needs obedience amen he wants a obedient Remnant he wants a obedient person right it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness 61 he says there is no compromising with God we don't compromise Believers don't compromise you know something about it God we don't compromise with God there is no compromising with God God just tastes God he don't expect us on Sunday to be Christians praising him and worshiping him and on Monday wishy washy and take it down and all kind of thoughts what we need to do we need to stay right centered on God's word amen don't go far right don't go for left let us walk in the middle of the road oh we need the prophet of God a deceived Church by the world he says we want a bunch of men of God who don't compromise on the word of God but preach the truth and stand on the baptism of the Holy Spirit what we need we must walk with God when you fail when you are in a fallen State get up when you get up obey the Lord Jesus Christ we must not stop we must move on that's why the word of God said Rise and Shine for the light has come in the evening time we have a destination my brothers my sister as I told you before the prophet of God said either you will meet him as a masterpiece or you will meet him as a piece of wood Drifting On The Water what is our destination today it's an eternal destination amen tribulation is not our destination we need to be closer to our destination than our situation than our problem than our sicknesses yes why because we are the part of God's provision my brothers my sisters by the help of God we are not going to stay in our problems we are going to get out of our problems let us stop pleading our problems let us start pleading our promises when we plead to God he will fulfill it as a man of God said when we go to him in no wise he will cast us away amen you must learn to trust in him because when he sees us or when we see him we want to see him as an overcomer I want to be an overcomer when I see him I want to see him as a conqueror that's why Paul said n all things we are more than conquerors my brothers my sisters the days are really at hand you may say brother boys I'm walking with God Amen continue to walk with God love him do the best you can to do to walk with a perfect heart we can't pay the play the part of Hypocrites we can't put our fet in two boats it has to be anyone either God or world we need to recognize the day we are living in we need to recognize the time we are in we need to recognize where we came from and where we are supposed to go the world has so many things to offer but the word has got everything for us what we need for the this journey my prayer today is that the coming of the Lord is near I might not see you again it's true but let us all meet over Yonder I want to see you all in heaven but if you don't want to see me that's your problem I want to see you all our only prayer should as we walk in this walk Lord remember me when you come let my name be in that number the word of God came to Abraham he said I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect it's the Perfection which is going to take us to that Rapture I'm not perfect brother boy praise God that's true that's right we no one is perfect but God is able amen amen we have come thus far we have began I truly believe that we will complete it by the help of God God is not looking for a church relationship he's looking for a individual personal relationship today this walk this this highway is so small so so narrow only two can walk that is you and God I and God you and God there's no shortcuts to Glory we have to only come by the provided way of God right amen and we need to be self-centered in the word of God Amen no matter how many thunderstorms how many you know how many storms rages over our lives come across us against us yet we will stand up not look at the circumstances and we will move on forward God bless you all remember us and the ministry in your prayers I bring greetings from my family back home

remote Villages and tribal Villages where people haven't gone the word of God has not been reached you know they don't have electricity they don't have Android phones iPhones like you and I have right with what little education they have they try to read the books and they try to Mark the books and remember what the prophet has said people are hungry for the word of God today when I see the churches when I see the people they come to the church without even holding a Bible in their hand they are shy they are afraid you know they are scared you know they are lazy I should say to bring the Bible you know I have seen young people many people people with the iPads and with you know with with the iPhones to the church but you know I always tell people you will not be recognized that you are a Christian or a Believer when you have an iPad or i iPhone in your hands you know the only way you will be recognized is Bible in your hand you that's true you but you know sometimes we go to the battle without our weapons you know that's right we need this weapon whether you know I I I like the Zeal of the people they back in India even if they don't have an education they still want on Sunday they will they leave everything but they want to hold the Bible in their hand you why because to show that they are Christians lot of request have been coming for us to you know for Bibles you know there are people who are not even you know in a position to buy even Bible you if they don't go on daily wage labor you know they don't even have a one- Day meal to eat I don't work in the big cities I I my heart is for the poor tribal people for the remote people lot of needs for the Seven Seals and seven Church ages books I've got this many letters you know I have so many phone calls so many messages people call me pastors call me for the message books I have 19 books translated and proof read I have Seven Seals and seven church already translated in Hindi and in in Telo language and proof red but because of the lack of resources we are not able to print those books you know the others who are printing books in India have stopped it about 8 to 10 years ago they have started going after this digital Agape tablets and this and that but but let me tell you if they don't have electricity you where would they charge their iPads or iPhone what they need is the books so my heart is for these books and I want to do my best whatever designated funds which comes for the books it goes for the books whatever whatever comes for the orphanage it goes for the orphanage whatever comes for the leopard Colony it goes for the because I'm not only the one who executes the finances which I get but I am also accountable to God and to the people because at that day I must stand boldly in front of the throne and I would say Lord I am a faithful Steward thank you Jesus and he should say or I should say I have kept my faith I have fought a good fight please pray for the book Ministry you know 19 books are in line the next book if I need to continue to print I need to print this Look Away to Jesus you know and the next one which is ready is the spoken word is the original seed and the Seven no sorry the anointed ones at the end time and you know the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals you I want to tell you one thing you know so much of food is being wasted in the United States of America in one day the first thing that food can be eaten by the people of India 1.6 billion population for the whole month what food is being wasted one day in America that food can be eaten by the people of India for the whole month your dogs are better than most of the people living in the right that's true yeah I wish I could take all that and sell it and print books I'm telling you people are hungry for the word of God you people are blessed that you have a prophet who spoke English you should be blessed that you have all the 200 1200 and Plus messages but there are people who are hungry and thirsty for the books I have seen few people you know they they they you know try to give know one comes reads it and bring it back other takes it brings it back other takes it brings it back you know even though the book is tone out they still go and read it and bring it back because so that somebody else can also read it amen 10,000 books is nothing for the population we have remember this humble Ministry in your prayers the orphanage the elderly people the widows the leprosy people you know they're Outcast people leprosy people but we have place my brother has three colonies he's taking care I take care of three colonies we have placed pastors there we have placed message books there we place Bibles there people are being saved people are being baptized people

has accepted them they have accepted God so I I thank the pastor the man of God brother John Martin I also thank every one of you from time to time who are helping for the great cause in India nothing
