[37:11] two
[37:12] verse one
[37:16] and then matthew chapter 22 verse 14 and
[37:19] brother bruce made a mention i made
[37:21] mention about these screens here can
[37:24] can be um
[37:26] be more of a curse and a blessing
[37:29] because
[37:30] we can just rely on those screens
[37:33] to
[37:34] show
[37:35] to show us the scriptures when really we
[37:37] should be reading our bibles daily amen
[37:40] as the prophet taught us all right
[37:42] second timothy chapter two verse number
[37:44] one
[37:45] thou therefore my son be strong in the
[37:48] grace
[37:49] that is in christ jesus
[37:51] and the things that thou has heard of me
[37:54] among many witnesses
[37:56] the same commit thou to faithful men
[37:59] who shall be able to teach others also
[38:01] amen
[38:02] thou therefore endure hardness as a good
[38:06] soldier of jesus christ
[38:08] no man warth entangleth himself with the
[38:10] affairs of this life that he may please
[38:13] him who have chosen him
[38:15] to be a
[38:16] soldier amen and then in matthew
[38:20] 22 verse
[38:22] 14.
[38:30] matthew 22 verse 14
[38:34] jesus said
[38:38] for many are called
[38:41] but few are chosen
[38:43] god bless you may be seated
[38:47] brother johnson i left a message on her
[38:50] our phone
[38:51] last night
[38:53] that he
[38:55] wants to say thank you for all your
[38:56] prayers for sister johnson
[38:59] and brother johnson she is doing
[39:02] slightly
[39:03] better but it's going to be a long
[39:05] recovery because of
[39:08] the fracture
[39:09] and to also
[39:11] pray that she could
[39:13] get uh
[39:14] more help there because they're short
[39:16] staffed and she might have to be moved
[39:18] to another location so brother johnson
[39:21] requested that we pray
[39:23] for her concerning that
[39:26] and uh i just i want to say thank you to
[39:29] all those that uh labored
[39:32] uh yesterday
[39:34] uh making some outreach
[39:37] cards here at the church and there was
[39:39] 42 cards made
[39:42] reaching out to some heart and i just if
[39:46] we could
[39:47] look at that
[39:51] those cards are full of love
[39:53] for some soul that needs more of god
[39:58] amen
[39:59] and the bible tells us they that are
[40:01] strong to bear the infirmities of the
[40:03] weak and
[40:04] and and
[40:05] to be partakers
[40:08] of the laborers that build the body of
[40:11] christ it's not just somebody else but
[40:13] it's it's me
[40:15] that needs to be laboring so we
[40:17] appreciate them there's a couple more uh
[40:21] pictures of of them working and
[40:28] what uh wonderful pictures
[40:31] and i just
[40:33] heard a
[40:34] a real
[40:35] wonderful testimony from my daughter ann
[40:39] she says in that moment when we were
[40:41] doing that
[40:42] if i could chose to been anywhere in the
[40:44] whole entire world
[40:47] i would choose to be exactly where i was
[40:50] because she just knew that she knew that
[40:53] she knew
[40:54] she was in
[40:55] the presence and the will of god at that
[40:58] moment
[41:00] and
[41:01] i think it's important that we know our
[41:03] position we know our place
[41:07] um and i just want to say thank you to
[41:09] all you that were reaching out i also
[41:11] want to thank brother jonathan sister
[41:13] gabrielle
[41:14] probably don't want me to to say
[41:16] anything but
[41:17] that's just the way i am
[41:19] um
[41:20] so get used to it
[41:22] but i appreciate them laboring to clean
[41:24] up the flower beds to make the house of
[41:26] god look
[41:28] look like god deserves our best
[41:32] amen we appreciate them very much
[41:35] now these uh scriptures they may look
[41:38] familiar to you are they do they look
[41:40] familiar
[41:45] you remember last service
[41:47] these scriptures were read
[41:49] in fact there were three scriptures read
[41:50] in the last service that we'll be
[41:52] reading today
[41:55] but after service i
[41:57] took brother bruce in the back
[42:00] and i often uh
[42:02] come here on wednesdays and study early
[42:04] and even though i knew i wasn't
[42:05] preaching they came here and i was
[42:07] studying
[42:08] and the lord had dropped something in my
[42:11] heart
[42:14] oh about a week or two ago there was a
[42:17] video that went
[42:19] was going around
[42:20] and um i just saw it one time a week or
[42:23] two ago and and then i think there was
[42:25] like two other people that sent me that
[42:26] same video it's where i got
[42:29] this message from this morning
[42:32] but i began to and it thought was
[42:34] quickened to me
[42:35] and and then i i finally began to sit
[42:38] down and put some scriptures to it
[42:41] and so when i brought brother bruce back
[42:43] i showed him
[42:44] my first page and a half of notes were
[42:47] the three scriptures my opening
[42:48] scripture was this scripture
[42:51] my topic was a chosen soldier
[42:54] and
[42:57] i don't believe it was ironic but i
[42:58] wanted to encourage him
[43:00] that god was working in the ministry
[43:05] and
[43:06] it's my desire that
[43:08] this morning that
[43:10] you'd not only be encouraged
[43:14] but that you could find your place in
[43:16] the scriptures
[43:17] you've got to find yourself in this
[43:19] bible
[43:20] you can't just i'm a i'm a christian i'm
[43:23] saved and that's no you've got to find
[43:26] your position
[43:29] because we're in a battle
[43:33] brother branham says we're in the
[43:34] greatest battle over fault
[43:36] in this great battle where it's at is in
[43:39] our heads
[43:41] it rages in our heads
[43:43] our our heart should be fixed it should
[43:46] be on jesus christ
[43:48] but
[43:48] brother branson says god or satan chose
[43:51] the mind
[43:55] and it it it it is the the the
[43:57] battleground we may think
[43:59] uh
[44:00] uh it
[44:02] the war is is raging in the world
[44:06] uh with chaos and confusion
[44:08] and there's uh wars and transgenders and
[44:11] and politics and socialism and in in
[44:16] a way versus role
[44:20] or whatever else is going on out there
[44:22] but that's not the battle
[44:27] they are distractions
[44:29] the real battle is between good and evil
[44:33] faithfulness and unfaithfulness
[44:36] remaining in the vine
[44:39] and trying to bear the fruit with just
[44:40] knowledge
[44:43] to the believer
[44:44] there's the battle
[44:46] the battle is here
[44:48] we we hear the word
[44:50] we've got to believe as the song we sung
[44:53] he is here
[44:55] and we've got to believe the word that's
[44:57] being preached
[44:59] so i'll say
[45:01] this
[45:02] this message um may uh
[45:04] be
[45:05] like a
[45:07] personal testimony of me
[45:10] you may think i'm bragging a little bit
[45:12] here as we get through this
[45:14] but i want
[45:16] if you can identify yourself in these
[45:18] scriptures
[45:19] i want you to say amen to the word
[45:21] find your place
[45:23] and and
[45:27] you cannot go into the army and choose
[45:30] not to fight
[45:34] you can't choose where you're gonna go
[45:39] you are told what to do and as long as
[45:41] you're in the army you have to do it
[45:46] as a christian it's no different
[45:48] it's not so
[45:49] your relationship isn't so personal
[45:51] between you and god that the only thing
[45:53] that matters is you do what you want to
[45:55] do
[45:56] god is our commander amen
[45:59] we follow his instructions
[46:01] we follow his word
[46:05] romans chapter 7 verse 19 the battle is
[46:07] in our mind
[46:09] paul said for the good that i would go
[46:11] to do
[46:12] i do not but the evil which i would not
[46:15] go to do that i do
[46:18] how many can relate to that
[46:20] now if i do that which i
[46:22] do not want to do it is no more i that
[46:25] do with it but it's sin that dwelleth in
[46:29] me
[46:30] not my brother not my sister not my
[46:32] neighbor not my employer in me
[46:37] i find then a law that when i would go
[46:39] to do good evil is present with me
[46:45] you can't just
[46:48] look on the television look on your
[46:50] phone see this news about some evil
[46:53] going on and say that's the evil you've
[46:56] got to identify the evil inside yourself
[46:59] you've got to deal with that you've got
[47:01] to battle that
[47:06] our flesh cannot escape the evil that's
[47:08] inside our nature
[47:10] and the pursuit of every christian
[47:12] should be the desire to get more of the
[47:14] holy ghost because that is the only
[47:17] thing that would defeat the evil in our
[47:19] nature the only thing
[47:24] not my brother it's not my sister
[47:27] but it's me o lord standing in the need
[47:29] of prayer
[47:31] james chapter 4 verse 1 says from once
[47:34] comes wars and fightings among you can
[47:38] they not hence even of your lust
[47:41] and
[47:42] uh the you're lost at war in your
[47:45] members
[47:47] do you think that the scripture saith in
[47:49] vain the spirit that dwelleth in us it
[47:51] lusteth to envy
[47:54] now it's hard to
[47:55] to admit
[47:57] that there's
[47:58] wrong spirits inside of us
[48:02] we like to think
[48:04] that there's no wrong spirits inside of
[48:06] us and there's just they just kind of
[48:07] get on us once in a while
[48:11] and unfortunately
[48:13] we we're not able
[48:15] to war a good warfare
[48:17] when we think like that
[48:20] the devil is constantly battling
[48:23] to the avenue of our selfish nature to
[48:27] subdue us and to bring us down
[48:30] ephesians 6 verse 12 says for we wrestle
[48:33] not against flesh and blood
[48:35] but against principalities against
[48:37] powers against the rulers of the
[48:38] darkness of this world against spiritual
[48:41] wickedness in high places
[48:46] those high places aren't just the
[48:47] government
[48:49] it's not just the pope
[48:52] it's the high place in our head
[48:56] those places is where the spirit can get
[48:58] in there and anoint us and and cause us
[49:01] to to put our weapons down to put a
[49:04] shield down to to take off our armor and
[49:07] to relax
[49:11] these spirits will entice us to do
[49:13] whatever our flesh wants
[49:16] it would try to consume us with the
[49:18] cares of this life
[49:20] try to get us so busy that we become
[49:23] confused about things
[49:26] luke 21 verse 35 for as a snare shall it
[49:30] come
[49:32] on all them that dwell on the face of
[49:34] the whole earth
[49:36] and brother bruce was encouraged when he
[49:37] saw that these scriptures were written
[49:40] down hours before
[49:43] he preached this message
[49:45] watch ye therefore and pray always lord
[49:47] look at this scripture that he be
[49:49] counted
[49:50] worthy to escape all the things that
[49:52] shall come to pass and to stand before
[49:54] the son of man notice here it's not the
[49:56] blood of jesus christ that makes you
[49:58] worthy
[50:01] it's you praying without ceasing
[50:04] you got a job to do you just can't claim
[50:06] the blood when you want to you've got to
[50:08] keep praying and keep praying and keep
[50:10] praying that you can escape
[50:13] because it's true prayer that god
[50:15] reveals to you the truth
[50:17] because through the course of the day
[50:19] you're going and this is going you got
[50:20] this going and you think you're so right
[50:22] which the only time you realize you're
[50:24] wrong is when you hit a brick road
[50:26] but you get down in prayer and then
[50:28] that's where god can show you
[50:31] amen
[50:32] to escape
[50:34] we need to keep separating ourselves
[50:36] from this world
[50:38] to love not the world the things of the
[50:40] world don't get comfortable
[50:43] don't allow yourself to get conformed to
[50:46] this world
[50:48] brother bruce said gird up your loins
[50:50] with truth
[50:52] put your staff in your hands
[50:54] make sure your your shoes are
[50:57] are prepared because we are leaving here
[50:59] in a rapture
[51:01] we are leaving
[51:02] that means be ready
[51:05] soldier has to be ready
[51:08] now no man our opening scripture here at
[51:10] verse 4 no man that warth
[51:13] entangleth
[51:15] that means involve or intertwine or mix
[51:18] himself
[51:19] with the affairs
[51:21] of this life
[51:23] whoa
[51:26] there's a line that you do not cross
[51:31] you don't get involved you don't
[51:32] intertwine and you don't mix
[51:40] why
[51:40] that
[51:41] he may please him
[51:44] who have chosen him
[51:46] to be a soldier
[51:49] we've been chosen to be a soldier that
[51:52] means you can't be a soldier and
[51:54] entangle yourself with the things of the
[51:56] world
[51:57] christian soldiers don't
[51:59] involve
[52:00] themselves
[52:02] to get pleasure for self or
[52:06] to build self
[52:08] but
[52:09] we have been chosen to build the kingdom
[52:12] of god
[52:16] we don't want to become lovers of
[52:17] pleasure more than lovers of god
[52:20] now that war that word wareth no man
[52:23] wareth
[52:25] means warfare to serve in the military
[52:28] campaign
[52:30] amen to execute the office of an apostle
[52:33] with its difficulties with its duties
[52:37] with its responsibilities
[52:39] and to contend
[52:41] with carnal
[52:44] inclinations in other words the devil's
[52:47] coming to speak to us
[52:50] how many times you come to church and
[52:52] you didn't want to hear what you wanted
[52:53] to hear
[52:54] and the devil tried doing everything he
[52:56] can to get your mind on something
[52:58] different
[52:59] you're right in the middle of a battle
[53:01] and not even realizing it
[53:07] we're in a warfare
[53:09] whether we like it or not
[53:11] we can deny it and think that the only
[53:15] war that's going on is outside of me
[53:18] out there in the world
[53:20] or we can come to grips with the reality
[53:22] that the battle is actually inside each
[53:25] and every one of us nobody's exempt from
[53:27] this not our young
[53:29] children
[53:31] not the oldest amongst us
[53:34] the forces of good and evil
[53:36] are at odds with us every one of us
[53:40] and their goal is to bring us down
[53:44] god has called many to his army
[53:48] but he's only chosen a few i want you to
[53:51] catch that
[53:52] many are called
[53:54] but few were chosen
[53:57] i wonder why god would call somebody
[54:01] but he wouldn't choose him
[54:05] because not everyone is willing to go
[54:07] the straight and neural path
[54:11] they want
[54:12] to still be a christian but they want to
[54:13] go the broad way the way that everybody
[54:16] else goes the easy path
[54:19] jesus said for many are called fewer
[54:21] chosen in other words not all that say
[54:23] lord lord
[54:24] shall enter into the kingdom of god but
[54:26] he that doeth the will of the captain of
[54:29] our salvation
[54:31] many will come to me in that day and say
[54:33] i thought i was in your army
[54:37] prophesy spoken tongues i cast out
[54:39] devils i did many wonderful works
[54:42] but he only chose a few
[54:45] think about 1.8 million came out of
[54:47] egypt and he only
[54:50] chose
[54:51] to
[54:52] only two were willing to go all the way
[54:55] the others thought it was no problem to
[54:57] murder and complain and be to be
[54:58] half-hearted and take church lightly
[55:03] there's two that holy followed jesus
[55:06] amen
[55:08] holy followed the lord
[55:10] jesus said in luke 9 verse 62 no man
[55:14] having put his hand to the plow
[55:17] and looking back
[55:18] is fit for his army
[55:23] we're not fit to be in the army
[55:25] if we start out
[55:27] working for the lord
[55:29] and then we kind of
[55:31] look back and say well there's other
[55:32] things i could be doing this is you know
[55:34] the most important noise
[55:39] a lot of times you say well you can do
[55:40] this and that at the same time
[55:43] he'll find a way to bring the world in
[55:49] but god doesn't have anyone in his army
[55:52] that is looking back they're all moving
[55:54] forward
[55:56] onward christian soldiers marching as to
[55:59] war
[56:02] if you find yourself in the scriptures
[56:04] just say i believe
[56:07] luke 14 verse 25 and there went great
[56:09] multitudes with him
[56:11] and they wanted to enlist in his army
[56:14] and he turned and he said unto them
[56:18] if any man will come after me
[56:21] and hate not his father and his mother's
[56:23] wife his children brother and sisters
[56:25] yea
[56:27] even his own life
[56:28] he cannot be my soldier
[56:33] how many people in the world think
[56:35] they're god's soldier
[56:37] but they haven't forsaken a thing
[56:40] deceived
[56:42] by the master of deceit
[56:45] and whosoever does not bear his cross
[56:49] and come after me
[56:50] cannot be my soldier
[56:54] so likewise whosoever be of you at verse
[56:57] 33 sorry so likewise whosoever you be
[57:00] uh whosoever he be of you that forsaketh
[57:04] not all that he have
[57:07] he cannot be my soldier
[57:11] god requires all of you you're bought
[57:14] with the price
[57:16] you belong to god you don't call the
[57:18] shots anymore you don't do what you want
[57:21] to do you a soldier says
[57:24] not my will thy will be done a a soldier
[57:27] of god says the uh if it would be the
[57:30] will of the lord we will go here we will
[57:32] go there we will do this we will do that
[57:34] because we're a soldier of jesus christ
[57:37] now this ain't for everybody but i'll
[57:39] say if you find yourself in the
[57:41] scriptures say amen that's for me
[57:43] because if you don't put the devil in
[57:46] his place he's going to stay in yours
[57:54] many have been called into god's great
[57:56] army
[57:57] but they haven't been able
[57:59] to get through boot camp
[58:03] and until you're willing to go through
[58:04] boot camp
[58:06] how can you be fit for god's army
[58:09] chosen for god's army
[58:12] i would say just about every the talk of
[58:15] everybody going into the army
[58:18] is
[58:19] i'm not looking forward to boot camp
[58:22] nobody wants to go through boot camp
[58:24] has anybody been in the army here
[58:26] no
[58:27] okay well
[58:29] it's not something that you like jump up
[58:31] and down for
[58:33] being
[58:35] told what to do and and
[58:38] and and some man trying to get all the
[58:40] smirks and sarcasms and your little big
[58:43] tough stuff out of you
[58:45] not fun
[58:46] being pumped down to being humble
[58:49] obedient
[58:54] look at jesus told his soldiers in luke
[58:56] 21 verse 12
[58:58] they shall lay
[59:00] their hands on you and persecute you
[59:03] delivering you up to the synagogues and
[59:05] into prisons
[59:06] being brought before kings and rulers
[59:08] for my name's sake
[59:11] you talk about things that you're going
[59:13] to have to go through
[59:14] there's a reason you go through boot
[59:16] camp it's to toughen you up
[59:19] and if we're if we're getting bothered
[59:21] every time somebody says something to us
[59:23] that ain't just perfect something's
[59:25] wrong with our relationship with god
[59:28] we're not tough enough
[59:30] come on i love it guys i got to hear
[59:32] some amens amen
[59:36] john 16 verse 1
[59:38] jesus said these things that i've spoken
[59:39] unto you
[59:40] that ye should what
[59:42] not be offended
[59:45] don't be offended
[59:46] they should put you out of the
[59:48] synagogues
[59:49] yeah the time cometh that whosoever
[59:51] killeth you they're actually going to
[59:53] think they're doing god a service
[59:55] think about it how perverted people are
[59:58] when they mistreat you they don't even
[1:00:00] know what they they're actually when
[1:00:01] somebody cuts you down especially from
[1:00:03] the pulpit they actually think they're
[1:00:05] doing god a service but they don't
[1:00:07] realize they're being used by the enemy
[1:00:12] it's the truth
[1:00:15] how many times have you thought oh yeah
[1:00:17] this is the lord you found out you were
[1:00:19] wrong
[1:00:21] so we can actually think we're doing god
[1:00:23] a service and find out it wasn't him at
[1:00:25] all
[1:00:26] it was just us wanting to do something
[1:00:31] paul's speaking the hardships of a true
[1:00:33] christian in second timothy chapter 3
[1:00:35] verse 10. he says but thou has fully
[1:00:37] known my doctrine my matter of life
[1:00:39] purpose faith longsuffering charity
[1:00:42] patience persecutions afflictions which
[1:00:45] came unto me at antioch iconium lystra
[1:00:48] what
[1:00:49] persecutions i
[1:00:52] endured
[1:00:53] but out of them all
[1:00:55] the chief captain
[1:00:57] the captain of the army he delivered me
[1:01:02] that's why we have to go through boot
[1:01:03] camp
[1:01:04] because when we go through things we've
[1:01:06] got to remain faithful
[1:01:09] we got to remain fruitful we got to
[1:01:11] remain in love with our enemy no matter
[1:01:14] what they do to us
[1:01:16] yea and all that will live godly in
[1:01:19] christ jesus are going to go through
[1:01:21] this
[1:01:23] but evil men and seducers shall wax
[1:01:25] worse and worse deceiving and being
[1:01:28] deceived
[1:01:29] but continue thou in the things which
[1:01:31] thou has learned
[1:01:33] and been assured of knowing of whom thou
[1:01:35] has learned them amen continue in the
[1:01:38] things that thou has learned continue to
[1:01:42] seek more holy ghost do not be satisfied
[1:01:45] with how much you got
[1:01:47] get on the side of i need more and i got
[1:01:50] to get busy getting more
[1:01:53] learn to wait in prayer for the power
[1:01:56] of what you believe in
[1:01:57] you say you got the holy ghost wait on
[1:02:00] the lord for power
[1:02:03] that's what jesus said acts chapter 1
[1:02:05] verse 8 but you shall receive power
[1:02:07] after the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:02:11] and you shall be witnesses
[1:02:13] unto me both in jerusalem judea and
[1:02:14] samaria and unto the most part it sounds
[1:02:17] like when you get the holy ghost your
[1:02:18] witness wherever you go supermarket
[1:02:20] grocery store
[1:02:22] not just church you're a witness
[1:02:24] everywhere
[1:02:25] the holy ghost is not just constantly
[1:02:27] coming in and out of you like a you know
[1:02:34] door that goes open and closes all the
[1:02:36] time you know what i'm trying to say
[1:02:38] boot camp teaches us
[1:02:41] to deny ourselves that's why we got
[1:02:42] trials that's why we go through trials
[1:02:44] boot camp teaches us to deny ourselves
[1:02:48] to deny our own will that's something we
[1:02:50] don't want to do we don't want to give
[1:02:51] up self but unfortunately that nature is
[1:02:54] going to be there jesus knew that
[1:02:57] there's a difference between your
[1:03:00] thoughts
[1:03:01] and god's thoughts
[1:03:03] god's thoughts are much higher
[1:03:07] with god's thoughts
[1:03:08] it involves sufferings
[1:03:11] persecutions
[1:03:13] pain
[1:03:16] the denial of flesh
[1:03:19] faithfulness
[1:03:20] amen but your thoughts are often without
[1:03:24] that
[1:03:26] so when you think you're right
[1:03:28] just know every man
[1:03:30] is right in his own eyes
[1:03:32] remember we got to reach beyond what
[1:03:34] we're thinking and say lord show me
[1:03:36] show me because if you don't ask that
[1:03:38] question you're going to walk in what
[1:03:40] you think is
[1:03:42] right if we don't surrender our life to
[1:03:45] god we'll end up whining and complaining
[1:03:49] about everything
[1:03:50] all because we didn't surrender our life
[1:03:54] now i know this is strong word
[1:03:56] but i'm talking to the soldiers of god's
[1:04:00] great army
[1:04:01] i'm not talking i trust that i'm not
[1:04:03] talking to anybody that's just called
[1:04:08] i hope i'm talking to those who have
[1:04:11] been chosen
[1:04:13] because this ministry is not good for
[1:04:15] those who don't want to go all the way
[1:04:18] this is not the ministry
[1:04:21] god doesn't have whiners in his army
[1:04:25] i can't believe i got to do this i can't
[1:04:27] believe they're they're asking me again
[1:04:31] come on
[1:04:32] it's not an army of murmurs and
[1:04:35] complainers
[1:04:36] it's an army of overcomers an army of of
[1:04:40] obedient children amen dedicated
[1:04:43] believers
[1:04:44] that's the army we're in
[1:04:48] brother branham said the message greater
[1:04:49] than solomon is here he says and there's
[1:04:51] where we fail
[1:04:53] the church needs tonight not a soft high
[1:04:56] bred something
[1:04:57] soft
[1:04:59] and flabby
[1:05:01] like the church is
[1:05:03] now this is his definition
[1:05:06] of a ch
[1:05:07] ch
[1:05:08] chaby flabby church
[1:05:12] he says just make a confession
[1:05:14] be baptized
[1:05:16] and you're a christian
[1:05:19] although quote that scripture oh yeah he
[1:05:21] that believeth is baptized he'll be
[1:05:22] saved
[1:05:23] but that's all they'll do they'll quote
[1:05:25] that to that thing is dead and they'll
[1:05:27] they'll bypass every other thing in the
[1:05:29] word that tells them what to do
[1:05:32] and brother branham says
[1:05:34] it's a soft church
[1:05:36] he said to be a christian is self-denial
[1:05:40] that's his definition of a christian
[1:05:43] self-denial deny yourself take up your
[1:05:45] cross and follow me according jesus
[1:05:48] today it's so soft and people call
[1:05:50] themselves christians
[1:05:52] when it used to mean death to confess
[1:05:54] christ
[1:05:57] and you had to depend on on him daily
[1:06:00] for everything you need
[1:06:02] the same god lives today and i know
[1:06:04] that's to be true
[1:06:06] yesterday we were in a restaurant
[1:06:09] and as we all do
[1:06:11] uh we bowed our head and we prayed
[1:06:15] uh didn't know but the waiter was behind
[1:06:18] us and he heard a prayer and when we
[1:06:20] were done he said amen and he came over
[1:06:22] start talking he says you know i don't
[1:06:24] know so many people are afraid to to to
[1:06:27] uh
[1:06:28] mention the the name of jesus christ out
[1:06:31] in public
[1:06:32] and he's we should never be ashamed he
[1:06:34] said
[1:06:35] of our lord jesus christ
[1:06:39] in the message the seed does not air
[1:06:41] with the sha brother says the higher you
[1:06:43] go
[1:06:44] the more you can see speaking of an
[1:06:45] eagle so it's time for eagles of this
[1:06:48] day
[1:06:49] to get flying higher
[1:06:51] to dig into the promises of god
[1:06:53] so you go higher by digging deeper in
[1:06:56] the promises of god
[1:07:00] and not live on vulture food that's been
[1:07:02] killed years ago
[1:07:05] oh i believe this
[1:07:07] hey let's go forward what what what what
[1:07:09] are you eating on
[1:07:11] let me ask you a question how many
[1:07:12] watches tv in here
[1:07:15] how many don't want to be honest
[1:07:20] imagine
[1:07:21] you watching the same show
[1:07:24] over and over and over and over
[1:07:28] and over and being satisfied with it
[1:07:33] no
[1:07:34] so why do we want to have a relationship
[1:07:37] with christ that way
[1:07:39] how about just get on our knees until we
[1:07:42] hear something fresh from god get some
[1:07:44] new leadership from god amen amen
[1:07:50] he said
[1:07:51] politics
[1:07:53] voting in and
[1:07:54] out basically of the church
[1:07:58] saying this that or the other and the
[1:08:00] holy spirit has no
[1:08:02] more right of way in the church than
[1:08:05] nothing
[1:08:06] no more prayer meetings
[1:08:11] flesh don't like to go to prayer
[1:08:12] meetings
[1:08:13] no more prayer meetings no more agond
[1:08:17] agonizing with god to fulfill his word
[1:08:21] there's nothing coming out of the
[1:08:22] believer that's agonizing god i won't be
[1:08:26] satisfied until i awaken your likeness
[1:08:31] no more believing the word is still the
[1:08:34] same yesterday today and forever
[1:08:36] they just vulturalized down
[1:08:40] put their name on the book
[1:08:42] and got lazy and soft and sit back there
[1:08:45] gloating on some kind of dead carrion
[1:08:49] now that's
[1:08:50] the prophet of this age what he had to
[1:08:53] say
[1:08:55] i believe
[1:08:58] god doesn't want us
[1:09:00] in some stale army that all we do
[1:09:03] is
[1:09:04] have some label above us
[1:09:07] i believe that we should be
[1:09:09] written epistles read of all men whether
[1:09:12] we're in a home
[1:09:13] and i'll tell you you shine the greatest
[1:09:15] when there's the greatest problem
[1:09:18] that's where christ really has a chance
[1:09:19] to shine
[1:09:21] when when everything is against you and
[1:09:23] people hate you and and things are going
[1:09:25] wrong that's the time to show god
[1:09:28] to show the world and show god how much
[1:09:30] you love them
[1:09:32] jesus said in revelation chapter 3 verse
[1:09:35] 19 he says now we're talking about the
[1:09:37] boot camp okay
[1:09:39] well we got to go through it
[1:09:41] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[1:09:44] be zealous therefore and repent
[1:09:47] now look what happens here
[1:09:49] behold i stand at the door of every
[1:09:51] heart
[1:09:52] and knock
[1:09:54] see many are called
[1:09:56] if any man will hear my voice and open
[1:09:58] the door i will come into him and will
[1:10:00] sup with him and he with me
[1:10:02] and i'll say to every soldier that
[1:10:05] overcometh
[1:10:06] will i choose
[1:10:08] i will choose to sit down with me on my
[1:10:11] throne even as i've overcame and sat
[1:10:13] down with my father in his throne a
[1:10:16] chosen
[1:10:17] soldier is an overcomer
[1:10:21] he that have an ear let him hear with
[1:10:23] the spirit
[1:10:24] saith
[1:10:25] unto the churches i wonder this morning
[1:10:28] how many believes the spirit of the lord
[1:10:30] is here
[1:10:31] i wonder this morning who has
[1:10:35] a
[1:10:36] ear to hear what god is speaking this
[1:10:38] morning
[1:10:39] amen
[1:10:40] amen don't don't let the devil come and
[1:10:43] whisper in there
[1:10:46] jesus said my chosen
[1:10:48] soldiers
[1:10:50] they hear my voice
[1:10:52] and they follow my command
[1:10:56] that's the chosen now many are called
[1:11:00] but they hear different voices that
[1:11:01] doesn't mean that you don't got to do
[1:11:02] that that's not important
[1:11:06] this is the only thing that's important
[1:11:08] and they begin to be god
[1:11:10] themselves instead of allowing the word
[1:11:13] to be god to them
[1:11:16] they become god instead of
[1:11:19] they take the mark of the beast that's
[1:11:20] why the mark of the beast is the same
[1:11:22] thing as the mark the name of a man the
[1:11:24] number of a man 666.
[1:11:26] man was made on the sixth day
[1:11:28] his own will
[1:11:30] it's it's
[1:11:32] horrible
[1:11:36] we've got to get out of the world and
[1:11:38] get into the holy ghost
[1:11:42] jesus said the kingdom of god suffereth
[1:11:44] violence and the violet take it by force
[1:11:47] since john the baptist men press their
[1:11:49] way into the kingdom
[1:11:52] he said straight as the gate narrows
[1:11:53] away and only a few
[1:11:55] chosen soldiers will make it
[1:11:58] now those are just his words they're not
[1:12:00] my words it's not my take
[1:12:03] i'm just staying with the gospel
[1:12:08] god's chosen army is strong
[1:12:11] they're not babies
[1:12:15] they're strong in their minds
[1:12:17] they can take correction
[1:12:19] they can take rebukes
[1:12:21] they can take instructions without
[1:12:24] excuses
[1:12:27] we got more excuses today than ever
[1:12:29] before
[1:12:32] they can be told no and they won't get
[1:12:34] offended
[1:12:38] they have great peace because they love
[1:12:40] god
[1:12:42] and they love
[1:12:43] his code
[1:12:45] of rules
[1:12:47] that's what the bible says
[1:12:49] great peace have they that love my law
[1:12:51] and nothing shall offend them we've got
[1:12:53] to love
[1:12:55] this is the soldier's
[1:12:57] code book of order
[1:12:59] conduct and order right here
[1:13:02] and this is what every christian soldier
[1:13:04] goes by not what you want to do not what
[1:13:07] you think is right but you got to have
[1:13:10] it line up and i'm so glad god sent a
[1:13:11] prophet in this age to tell us how to
[1:13:13] dress tell us how that tell us about our
[1:13:16] hair tell us about everything
[1:13:19] because if he did it
[1:13:23] this world would be in terrible shape
[1:13:27] it is the bride right here that's
[1:13:29] holding off the wrath of god
[1:13:34] hebrews chapter
[1:13:36] chapter 12 verse 3
[1:13:38] how many has ever
[1:13:44] been bothered because you're being
[1:13:45] corrected
[1:13:48] okay good i love honesty
[1:13:50] love honesty find yourself in the
[1:13:52] scriptures here let this encourage you
[1:13:54] and strengthen you hebrews 12 verse 3
[1:13:57] for consider him that endured such
[1:13:58] contradiction of sinners against himself
[1:14:00] lest ye be worried and faint in your
[1:14:02] minds in other words if you think you
[1:14:04] got hard which you got to go through
[1:14:06] think about what jesus had to do
[1:14:09] he was carrying
[1:14:11] the world
[1:14:13] the people of the world their sin on him
[1:14:17] and they hated him
[1:14:19] they weren't saying oh yes die for me
[1:14:22] thank you for helping me there was no
[1:14:25] bandwagon there was no uh parade there
[1:14:28] was no we're with you
[1:14:30] even his disciples left him at the end
[1:14:33] he was left all alone and he had to make
[1:14:36] this decision by himself not my will but
[1:14:39] mine be done
[1:14:41] so consider him
[1:14:43] consider him unless you think that your
[1:14:45] trial is so much hard that you can't go
[1:14:48] through it
[1:14:50] verse 5 and ye have forgotten the
[1:14:52] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[1:14:54] your children my son despise not the
[1:14:57] chastening of the lord nor faint when
[1:14:58] thou rebuked of him
[1:15:01] for whom the lord loveth he chastened it
[1:15:03] scorcheth every son
[1:15:04] whom he receiveth
[1:15:06] and if you endure chastening god deal
[1:15:08] with you as with sons
[1:15:09] for what son is he whom the father
[1:15:11] chasteneth not that's a small brat
[1:15:14] right that's who that would be
[1:15:19] i remember this is a big thing you you
[1:15:21] that are parents there were times that
[1:15:23] your child
[1:15:25] was not acting the way you wanted them
[1:15:27] to act
[1:15:28] and you would say
[1:15:30] that is your child
[1:15:32] to your spouse
[1:15:36] go get your son no you go get yourself
[1:15:39] not my son that's your son look at the
[1:15:41] way he's acting
[1:15:43] you know so we got this when they're
[1:15:44] they're small and their babies oh don't
[1:15:46] they look like
[1:15:48] you know they look more like me you know
[1:15:49] they look more like me you know run to
[1:15:52] look like us but when they start acting
[1:15:54] bad no they look like you
[1:15:56] it's just weird how you know things
[1:15:58] change
[1:16:01] but if you be without chastisement
[1:16:04] whereof all are partakers
[1:16:06] then are ye bastards and not sons now
[1:16:09] this is such a scorcher
[1:16:12] if you don't let god deal with your
[1:16:13] heart and conscious you're identifying
[1:16:15] yourself as being number one
[1:16:18] disconnected the scripture is saying
[1:16:20] here if you if you if you won't take
[1:16:23] correction
[1:16:24] god cannot be your father
[1:16:26] it's that simple
[1:16:28] it it's like it's like this
[1:16:30] um
[1:16:41] uh i'll just say ann ends my my my
[1:16:44] daughter and
[1:16:46] and
[1:16:47] if
[1:16:49] jonathan or brother mike or brother ron
[1:16:51] came to her
[1:16:53] and said well i want you to wash my car
[1:16:56] and i want you to get the groceries and
[1:16:58] i want you to cut the lawn and i want
[1:17:00] you to do all these things and and you
[1:17:02] better you better get to church five
[1:17:04] hours earlier
[1:17:07] and she said wait a minute you're not my
[1:17:09] father
[1:17:11] you're my father i don't have to do that
[1:17:14] and when you say i don't have to do what
[1:17:16] the words asking me to do or telling me
[1:17:19] to do this morning what you're saying is
[1:17:22] you're not my father
[1:17:23] i know this is strong but we've got to
[1:17:25] understand the scriptures there's
[1:17:27] nothing wrong with correction
[1:17:30] what what's wrong is there when there's
[1:17:32] separation between you and the
[1:17:33] scriptures that's what's wrong that's
[1:17:35] what we can't have
[1:17:37] we've got to be identified with it
[1:17:45] verse eight but if he be without
[1:17:47] chastisement we're of all our partakers
[1:17:49] then are you bastards and not sons amen
[1:17:51] first nine furthermore we have had
[1:17:53] fathers of our flesh which corrected us
[1:17:55] and we gave them reference we had to
[1:17:58] if not we got whipped again
[1:18:01] shall we not much rather be subject unto
[1:18:04] the father's spirits and live
[1:18:06] for they verily for a few
[1:18:08] few days chasing us after their own
[1:18:10] pleasure in other words their motive
[1:18:11] wasn't right they were so mad they had
[1:18:13] to let it out
[1:18:15] that is not the right spirit of a parent
[1:18:18] you don't do that to your children you
[1:18:19] do not correct them out of anger you do
[1:18:22] not correct them because you're upset
[1:18:24] that is absolutely wrong
[1:18:27] get your spirit under control then
[1:18:30] approach helping them
[1:18:32] because that's what we're called to do
[1:18:34] but he for our prophet
[1:18:37] that we
[1:18:38] might be partakers of his holiness in
[1:18:40] other words that's why he's chasing us
[1:18:43] so we can become more holy
[1:18:46] now no chastening for the president
[1:18:48] seemed to be joyful but grievous
[1:18:49] nevertheless afterwards it yielded the
[1:18:51] peaceable fruits of righteousness unto
[1:18:53] them which say you know what i'm going
[1:18:54] to let this correction happen to me i'm
[1:18:56] going to exercise this i'm going to go
[1:18:58] to church i'm going to take the word i'm
[1:19:00] going to come subject to the word i'm
[1:19:01] going to say amen to the world i'm going
[1:19:02] to start obeying the word
[1:19:04] then you're going to get the peaceable
[1:19:06] fruits of righteousness
[1:19:08] wherefore lift up your hand lift up the
[1:19:10] hands which hang down
[1:19:12] and the feet and the feeble knees and
[1:19:14] make straight the paths for your feet
[1:19:16] god wants us to be encouraged right in
[1:19:19] the middle
[1:19:21] of his correction
[1:19:23] now we've not only been called to god's
[1:19:25] great army but we've been chosen
[1:19:28] john 15 16 you have not chosen me but i
[1:19:30] have chosen you and have ordained you
[1:19:32] that you should go forth and bring forth
[1:19:33] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[1:19:35] we went over these scriptures that
[1:19:37] whatsoever yes of the father in my name
[1:19:39] that he may give you so we've been
[1:19:41] chosen to bring forth fruit and that our
[1:19:43] fruit as a soldier should remain amen in
[1:19:47] other words at one time we used to be
[1:19:49] faithful
[1:19:52] as a soldier you need to remain faithful
[1:19:55] you can't be in the army for four years
[1:19:59] six years eight years
[1:20:01] and finally decide you're going to go do
[1:20:03] what you want to do and you're not going
[1:20:04] to do what the commanding officer told
[1:20:06] you to do
[1:20:07] and you can't go to him say hey listen
[1:20:09] i've been a christian for six years i've
[1:20:11] been in the army for six years i
[1:20:12] followed instructions faithfully for six
[1:20:14] years
[1:20:16] there's no excuse to not do it today
[1:20:19] you've got to remain faithful
[1:20:22] that's the only way you can remain
[1:20:23] fruitful
[1:20:24] amen we've been chosen to bring pleasure
[1:20:28] to the one who chose us from the
[1:20:30] foundation of the world he chose us to
[1:20:32] be a soldier in the army
[1:20:36] not just to say we're a christian
[1:20:42] to take time to tell the devil to get
[1:20:44] out of your mind
[1:20:46] take time to resist those thoughts
[1:20:50] we don't entangle ourselves with the
[1:20:52] affairs of this life
[1:20:53] we don't slough off and lay out a church
[1:20:55] and
[1:20:56] and try not to pay our tithes well we
[1:20:58] won't go and then we can save on tithes
[1:21:01] we don't give a bunch of excuses of why
[1:21:04] we're not a faithful soldier
[1:21:07] a good soldier of jesus christ is at his
[1:21:10] post of duty every time the doors are
[1:21:13] open
[1:21:15] in fact church is so much on his mind he
[1:21:18] can't wait to get there
[1:21:21] and if that's not how you're feeling you
[1:21:23] got to get back
[1:21:26] have a little talk with jesus
[1:21:28] amen
[1:21:30] a good soldier
[1:21:32] is punctual prompt and prepared for his
[1:21:35] captain's orders
[1:21:36] the three p's he goes to church to
[1:21:39] receive his commands his next deployment
[1:21:42] as it were what he's supposed to do
[1:21:43] where he's supposed to go he don't come
[1:21:45] just to learn he comes to become
[1:21:49] he comes to become
[1:21:51] not just to learn
[1:21:55] we've been chosen to be a strong soldier
[1:21:58] one that can endure hardness
[1:22:00] not easily provoked or offended or
[1:22:03] feeling sorry for ourselves
[1:22:06] a strong soldier
[1:22:08] is strongly in love with his captain's
[1:22:11] word
[1:22:14] you say you love jesus love the word
[1:22:16] love his word don't separate them
[1:22:18] they're not two different things
[1:22:20] this isn't just some book that god reads
[1:22:22] in heaven once in a while
[1:22:25] he is the word
[1:22:27] and when you believe it it becomes
[1:22:29] living in you
[1:22:31] fall in love with the word not just the
[1:22:34] feeling of his presence
[1:22:38] everybody wants to be blessed by the
[1:22:40] presence
[1:22:41] brother branham told us it ain't just
[1:22:43] the wheat that goes that the
[1:22:45] hot and dry and and want rain and the
[1:22:48] shower is a blessing but it's the weeds
[1:22:51] and when they get the the blessings they
[1:22:53] shout they're happy they're excited but
[1:22:56] they don't want to live for god
[1:22:59] and i'll tell you living for god isn't
[1:23:01] at your convenience
[1:23:04] it's hard it's a hard rugged life loving
[1:23:07] loving is hard and rugged
[1:23:12] what a revelation in that
[1:23:15] a strong soldier has so much peace in
[1:23:18] his heart
[1:23:19] that nothing will offend him
[1:23:22] think about it
[1:23:24] a soldier that becomes strong is one
[1:23:26] that has been tested brother brother
[1:23:28] bruce talked a little bit about that
[1:23:29] testing didn't he
[1:23:32] they can endure hardness they can take
[1:23:34] correction they can follow orders
[1:23:36] without having to understand the orders
[1:23:40] without having to agree
[1:23:43] with the orders
[1:23:45] can you imagine going in the army and
[1:23:47] say i am not going to do what you tell
[1:23:48] me to do until i understand why
[1:23:51] and you know what i got to make sure
[1:23:53] it's right and then if i agree with you
[1:23:55] then they'll start doing what you tell
[1:23:57] me to do
[1:23:58] but you know that's how a lot of people
[1:24:00] come to church
[1:24:03] got to understand it
[1:24:05] right there in the scriptures
[1:24:08] he didn't say if thou understandeth
[1:24:12] you got to believe it you got to take
[1:24:14] god as word this is a walk of faith
[1:24:17] if the word says that you can have
[1:24:19] confidence in it don't have confidence
[1:24:20] in your understanding
[1:24:23] if you're leaning on your own
[1:24:24] understanding then you're never going to
[1:24:26] get peace that passeth all understanding
[1:24:28] because your understanding has limits
[1:24:31] god's thoughts are higher
[1:24:37] we've got to be battle ready
[1:24:41] we got to take the word and the message
[1:24:43] of the hour we got to fight the good
[1:24:44] fight of faith
[1:24:47] i believe a strong soldier he's instant
[1:24:50] in season
[1:24:51] and he's instant
[1:24:52] the same out of season
[1:24:55] because he's he's prepared
[1:24:58] he's ready for whatever is given to him
[1:25:00] now i'll tell you if this is you find
[1:25:03] yourself in these scriptures forget
[1:25:05] about how you feel say amen to the word
[1:25:07] because it's your faith becomes the
[1:25:10] word
[1:25:12] if you don't believe it you will not
[1:25:14] become the word
[1:25:16] i mean think about it
[1:25:18] the angel lord came to mary and says
[1:25:19] you're going to have a child how is this
[1:25:21] going to happen
[1:25:22] i don't know no man
[1:25:24] she had to say be it unto me
[1:25:27] according to thy word
[1:25:29] when you say amen you're saying be it
[1:25:31] unto me according to thy word lord
[1:25:37] they've been trained by the holy ghost
[1:25:40] to know the attitude
[1:25:42] of their enemies
[1:25:46] they know they're living in the very
[1:25:47] hour where believers are not going to
[1:25:50] endure sound doctrine
[1:25:52] they're going to be constantly looking
[1:25:53] for an easier way
[1:25:56] they're not interested in the old-time
[1:25:58] gospel preaching the cleansing of the
[1:26:00] soul
[1:26:02] no but rather after their own lust and
[1:26:04] desires and beliefs they shall heap to
[1:26:06] themselves personal teachers
[1:26:09] slowly turning away their ears from the
[1:26:12] truth and turning their heads towards
[1:26:14] what an easier gospel
[1:26:17] that's what fables are
[1:26:18] an easier gospel that word fables means
[1:26:21] imaginary pretense friction like a fairy
[1:26:24] tale that's an easier gospel there is no
[1:26:27] easy gospel
[1:26:28] there's only one gospel
[1:26:30] and it's dripping with blood
[1:26:34] our flesh may not want it
[1:26:36] but it is the full gospel that brings
[1:26:39] holy ghost conviction and stirs our
[1:26:41] heart
[1:26:42] to press into the image of christ now
[1:26:44] i've been to concerts
[1:26:48] and if you go to a concert that's you
[1:26:50] know
[1:26:52] usually
[1:26:53] songs or
[1:26:55] they enter into the soul quite easy
[1:26:59] and they make you feel
[1:27:01] good when you leave
[1:27:03] you hardly leave a concert
[1:27:05] and say that was bad
[1:27:08] you always feel good you might even cry
[1:27:13] but there is a difference between
[1:27:15] feeling good and having the word come
[1:27:18] live inside you
[1:27:21] jesus didn't pawn he punches
[1:27:25] he said if you're going to follow me you
[1:27:26] got to give everything up
[1:27:28] he didn't trick him
[1:27:30] he didn't say just come you know put
[1:27:32] your name on the book
[1:27:34] get baptized and everything's okay
[1:27:37] no
[1:27:38] there was more to it than that
[1:27:40] and soldiers of the cross
[1:27:43] we must take the whole word of god
[1:27:47] we must come to church expecting to hear
[1:27:50] from god
[1:27:51] not a feeling
[1:27:53] don't wait for your feelings to get
[1:27:54] turned on
[1:27:56] i'm turned on
[1:27:58] remember remember i don't know his name
[1:28:00] i'm hooked on a feeling i'm high in
[1:28:02] believing
[1:28:05] we're not hooked on a feeling we're
[1:28:07] hooked on the word
[1:28:09] brother brandon said the
[1:28:11] those out word
[1:28:13] uh manifestations were just the bait on
[1:28:16] the
[1:28:17] hook
[1:28:17] the hook is the gospel
[1:28:20] we've got to be hooked to the gospel
[1:28:22] hook to the word
[1:28:28] paul said i have not shunned to declare
[1:28:30] unto you the whole gospel of jesus
[1:28:32] christ i'm so glad when we read the
[1:28:34] bible there's nothing missing
[1:28:36] it's all there
[1:28:38] a good soldier jesus christ has been
[1:28:40] trained to not entertain thoughts
[1:28:43] of
[1:28:44] an easier way
[1:28:47] oh my
[1:28:49] he he knows it when the he just shuts
[1:28:51] that thing right off
[1:28:55] to jump on some bandwagon
[1:28:57] that it really doesn't matter if you
[1:29:00] follow what was spoken this morning at
[1:29:02] church
[1:29:05] a chosen soldier
[1:29:07] cast down those types of imaginations
[1:29:10] and every high thing that exalteth
[1:29:12] itself against the knowledge of god and
[1:29:14] he brings into captivity every thought
[1:29:17] to the obedience of christ
[1:29:19] now that's what a chosen soldier does
[1:29:23] not a called
[1:29:25] but chosen
[1:29:27] and he has a readiness to write revenge
[1:29:30] all disobedience
[1:29:32] when his own personal obedience is
[1:29:34] fulfilled
[1:29:36] don't you love that god expects full
[1:29:38] obedience from us
[1:29:41] full obedience now we can't be perfect
[1:29:43] people that's not what i'm saying but
[1:29:45] what i am saying is you need an attitude
[1:29:47] of i want to please you more
[1:29:49] you don't have that you're not going
[1:29:50] anywhere
[1:29:54] a chosen soldier
[1:29:58] always has
[1:30:00] their christian armor on
[1:30:01] and i'll leave it off
[1:30:03] as i'm hanging out with my worldly
[1:30:05] friends so i'm just going to leave it
[1:30:06] off
[1:30:09] they know
[1:30:12] they're not warring after the flesh
[1:30:14] that the weapons of the warfare are not
[1:30:16] carnal but mighty through god to the
[1:30:18] pulling down of strongholds so a chosen
[1:30:22] soldier has to have his armor on
[1:30:27] we've been chosen to be strong in the
[1:30:29] lord and the power of his might the
[1:30:30] bible says
[1:30:32] we've been chosen to put on the whole
[1:30:34] armor of god that we're able to stand
[1:30:36] against the wiles of the enemy
[1:30:39] we haven't been chosen to stand against
[1:30:41] our brother
[1:30:42] our sister
[1:30:44] a family member
[1:30:46] the government the schools
[1:30:49] no sir
[1:30:51] we've been chosen to fight the good
[1:30:53] fight of faith against principalities
[1:30:55] powers against the rulers of the
[1:30:57] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:30:59] wickedness in the high places of our
[1:31:02] mind
[1:31:04] any good soldier jesus christ knows that
[1:31:06] the it takes the whole armor of god to
[1:31:09] stand strong in this hour
[1:31:12] because more demons have been released
[1:31:13] in this hour than any other hour evil is
[1:31:17] growing worse and worse and we can't
[1:31:19] make it on knowledge we can't make it on
[1:31:22] well god knows i'm trying no you've got
[1:31:24] to take the whole word of god
[1:31:27] i believe all the people that don't make
[1:31:29] it at one time or another they tried
[1:31:32] all those people did many wonderful
[1:31:34] works and prophesied spoken tongues and
[1:31:36] cast out devils and did these things and
[1:31:39] didn't make it
[1:31:40] what about the foolish virgins that
[1:31:42] didn't take oil in their lamp they still
[1:31:44] had a sincere desire to try
[1:31:47] they still went to church they lived
[1:31:48] clean lives they hate they hung out with
[1:31:50] clean people
[1:31:52] but they didn't think they needed the
[1:31:54] holy ghost
[1:31:56] they thought they had enough
[1:31:59] you know justification
[1:32:01] is the holy ghost
[1:32:03] but it's only a part of the holy ghost
[1:32:06] and that's the problem
[1:32:07] we're not denying we don't have the holy
[1:32:10] ghost what we're denying is do we is
[1:32:12] there more for us that's that's the
[1:32:14] point in question
[1:32:15] because if we can come to grips that i
[1:32:17] need more well then we'll be seeking
[1:32:19] more and you shall seek me and find me
[1:32:22] when you search for me with all your
[1:32:23] heart don't be satisfied with where
[1:32:25] you're at
[1:32:27] dig into christ
[1:32:32] a soldier that has been chosen not just
[1:32:34] called but chosen he's always watching
[1:32:38] he's sober he's vigilant
[1:32:40] because he's aware of his adversary the
[1:32:43] devil he's walking about seeking whom he
[1:32:45] may devour
[1:32:48] you know you just look at the attitude
[1:32:50] of the people in the world the attitude
[1:32:52] of the people of the world is
[1:32:55] i'm not worried about going to hell
[1:32:59] afraid of the devil
[1:33:01] that's crazy
[1:33:04] so bring that attitude into the church
[1:33:08] i'm a christian i'm not worried about
[1:33:10] the devil
[1:33:11] oh you're an open target
[1:33:16] you've got to be strong
[1:33:18] you've got to be vigilant you've got to
[1:33:20] be watching because he's trying to creep
[1:33:22] in some way
[1:33:28] i know
[1:33:31] it looks like my my time is up
[1:33:34] but can i have just a little bit because
[1:33:35] we don't got communion
[1:33:40] i want to get
[1:33:41] i want to get to some good parts
[1:33:46] we're a chosen soldier
[1:33:49] a strong soldier doesn't play around
[1:33:51] with thoughts in his mind
[1:33:53] he will
[1:33:54] steadfastly resist the devil as quick as
[1:33:56] they come in
[1:33:58] a soldier that's been chosen is always
[1:34:01] battle ready ready to speak the truth in
[1:34:04] love ready to rebuke reprove exhort with
[1:34:06] all longsuffering to do the work of
[1:34:08] avengers to make full proof of his
[1:34:10] ministry that's what a chosen soldier
[1:34:13] does
[1:34:15] i want to see i want you to be able to
[1:34:17] find yourself in the scriptures
[1:34:20] you've got to you've got to find
[1:34:21] yourself here
[1:34:25] there's no other
[1:34:27] soldiers
[1:34:28] we're either chosen
[1:34:30] we're either strong or we're weak
[1:34:34] a soul a soldier who's made it through
[1:34:36] boot camp
[1:34:38] has been chosen to deliver the ministry
[1:34:40] of reconciliation to others
[1:34:42] he's been chosen as an ambassador for
[1:34:44] the captain they've been commissioned to
[1:34:47] go out to restore people to bring glad
[1:34:49] tidings and good news to the lost to the
[1:34:51] bound i want you to know
[1:34:53] you've got to identify do you see
[1:34:55] yourself in the scriptures today
[1:34:57] a chosen soldier is always ready to give
[1:35:01] an answer for the hope that lies within
[1:35:03] them
[1:35:04] he's been commissioned by almighty god
[1:35:06] to commit these instructions that god
[1:35:09] has given him to other men
[1:35:12] faithful men who will be able to also
[1:35:14] teach others
[1:35:16] and i wonder
[1:35:17] are we doing that do you find your place
[1:35:20] in the scriptures
[1:35:22] jesus said teaching them to observe all
[1:35:24] things whatsoever i commanded you you
[1:35:26] mean what you commanded me
[1:35:28] i got to tell others to do the same
[1:35:31] thing that's exactly what jesus said and
[1:35:33] he says lo i'm with you always even to
[1:35:35] the end of the world
[1:35:37] well by the grace of god
[1:35:40] i have run through a troop by the grace
[1:35:42] of god i have leaped over a wall because
[1:35:45] i am a chosen soldier i've made it
[1:35:49] through boot camp i can do all things
[1:35:51] through jesus christ
[1:35:53] i am a chosen soldier of the cross of
[1:35:56] love and suffering
[1:35:58] amen the cross when you look at the
[1:36:01] cross that was god's love for you but it
[1:36:04] also represented sufferings they're the
[1:36:07] same
[1:36:08] amen must jesus bear the cross alone no
[1:36:10] there's a cross for all of us and that
[1:36:12] cross is love that cross is suffering i
[1:36:15] can turn the cheek i can go the second
[1:36:18] mile i can love those who hate me why
[1:36:21] because i'm a chosen soldier i believe
[1:36:24] i'm a chosen soldier
[1:36:26] i'm a rugged soldier of love
[1:36:30] i pray with a burden for those who
[1:36:32] despitefully use me
[1:36:36] in other words i know
[1:36:40] what they're doing to me
[1:36:43] i know they're after something
[1:36:46] from me
[1:36:48] without
[1:36:49] trying
[1:36:50] to help me
[1:36:53] you find somebody that just wants to
[1:36:55] help you they don't want nothing out of
[1:36:56] it
[1:36:58] that's a chosen soldier
[1:37:01] but when you find someone they want
[1:37:04] something
[1:37:05] that you got power with
[1:37:07] then
[1:37:11] of course they want anybody does
[1:37:13] somebody that's hooked on drugs
[1:37:17] they'll get money from whoever they can
[1:37:19] they'll use them and use them and use
[1:37:21] them and use them
[1:37:27] if you're never going to get used you're
[1:37:30] never going to have the opportunity
[1:37:32] to fulfill the love of god
[1:37:36] but a chosen soldier can love somebody
[1:37:38] that uses them
[1:37:40] can continue continue moving on
[1:37:45] brother
[1:37:46] how can you do john
[1:37:49] i think it's simple
[1:37:51] i'm not my own
[1:37:53] i don't have any say so on the matter
[1:37:55] i'm bought with a price
[1:37:57] it's about learning daily to love not
[1:37:59] your life unto death
[1:38:01] it's about pressing in to perfect love
[1:38:04] it's not a gift god is not going to gift
[1:38:06] us
[1:38:08] with perfect love we got to go after it
[1:38:11] i am a chosen
[1:38:13] soldier of suffering love you know for
[1:38:16] the first time
[1:38:18] i'm hot in here and it's 69
[1:38:22] good temperature but i'm sweating
[1:38:24] these things that they give you in the
[1:38:26] army
[1:38:28] they're hot
[1:38:29] how many likes my
[1:38:31] my army i've never worked before i was
[1:38:34] at a
[1:38:35] goodwill i don't know how many years ago
[1:38:38] i thought boy
[1:38:39] can use that sometime in the future
[1:38:42] and i thought about this message i am
[1:38:43] going to pull this out and i'm going to
[1:38:44] wear this i want something to help us
[1:38:47] remember the word today amen
[1:38:50] as a soldier as a chosen soldier i can
[1:38:53] lay down my life
[1:38:55] i choose to lay down remember jesus said
[1:38:58] the same thing no man takes it from me
[1:39:00] but i lay it down as a chosen soldier
[1:39:02] you can lay down your life you can live
[1:39:04] for others you can deny yourself your
[1:39:07] time your interests your plans in order
[1:39:09] to help somebody else get into god's
[1:39:11] army that's right by this shall all men
[1:39:13] know that you're in the correct army
[1:39:20] the life is in the blood the spirit of
[1:39:22] god brother and they said the token must
[1:39:24] be on display
[1:39:26] what a blessed opportunity we have every
[1:39:28] time we talk to somebody
[1:39:29] that's true
[1:39:31] and and to be honest with you
[1:39:34] we all when we engage with one another
[1:39:36] we're looking for that smile smile back
[1:39:39] hey how are you i'm doing good
[1:39:41] but
[1:39:42] we need
[1:39:43] to also remember
[1:39:45] that love flows so much greater than
[1:39:47] when everything's going good
[1:39:50] but when somebody's not doing good
[1:39:52] they don't want to talk to you they're
[1:39:54] avoiding you
[1:39:56] there's a time to love them in a greater
[1:39:58] measure
[1:40:00] and i believe a chosen soldier can do
[1:40:03] that they can esteem others better than
[1:40:05] themselves amen
[1:40:07] they're living
[1:40:08] for the captain
[1:40:10] of their salvation
[1:40:12] they want to follow the instructions
[1:40:14] i'll say i'm not turning back
[1:40:17] i'm not turning back for anything
[1:40:19] i'm chosen to go all the way i'm chosen
[1:40:22] for a rapture
[1:40:24] i don't need pampering baby
[1:40:27] sugar coating
[1:40:29] i long to be at my post of duty every
[1:40:32] time the doors are open
[1:40:33] i don't need popularity i don't need
[1:40:35] attention i don't need to to be noticed
[1:40:38] or to look at i keep my motives pure
[1:40:41] before the lord
[1:40:44] i don't need a reputation
[1:40:46] i don't need money
[1:40:47] i don't need to be looked at i just want
[1:40:50] to help as many people as i can get over
[1:40:53] that's all i want i don't want nothing
[1:40:55] else

[1:45:24] your knees and you cry out to god
[1:45:26] i am a chosen soldier i will believe and
[1:45:30] obey the word i will build the kingdom
[1:45:32] of god i will hope for the best of all
[1:45:34] things i will bear all things that the
[1:45:37] captain puts in front of me
[1:45:39] because i've been chosen not just called
[1:45:42] in other words i've accepted what the
[1:45:44] captain says how many times have you
[1:45:46] heard people that joined the army i wish
[1:45:48] they wouldn't have
[1:45:50] because they think being a christian is
[1:45:52] you know easy
[1:45:54] being in the army is easy
[1:45:56] but when they realize the reason they
[1:45:58] were encouraged to go on the army is to
[1:46:01] get rid of that i'm going to do it my
[1:46:03] way attitude
[1:46:05] i don't know some people they really
[1:46:06] need that
[1:46:08] but praise god this this this army um
[1:46:13] in one sense
[1:46:14] you have to volunteer
[1:46:17] you do
[1:46:18] there's no way you're going to suffer
[1:46:20] god it has to go through three more
[1:46:22] agency amen
[1:46:25] we got to go into perfection we got to
[1:46:27] be a soldier that is looking to the
[1:46:30] author and the finisher of our faith we
[1:46:32] got to make a decision to forget those
[1:46:34] things which are behind and to press
[1:46:36] towards what god is pointing us to to
[1:46:38] his image
[1:46:42] how about you
[1:46:44] are you going to be conformed to the
[1:46:45] world
[1:46:47] my captain told me that i am not of this
[1:46:49] world
[1:46:51] i will not entangle myself with the
[1:46:54] affairs of this life that i may please
[1:46:56] the captain my salvation who has chosen
[1:46:59] me think about it he chose me to be a
[1:47:01] soldier how about you
[1:47:04] are you rapture ready
[1:47:08] will you be here at your posted duty
[1:47:10] when jesus comes
[1:47:13] i want to present my trophies to the
[1:47:15] lord
[1:47:16] i want to
[1:47:18] give back
[1:47:19] more talents
[1:47:20] to god than what he gave me
[1:47:22] i want to remain fruitful
[1:47:25] i will overcome by the blood of the lamb
[1:47:27] by the word of the testament i will
[1:47:28] choose i will choose to hate my life
[1:47:31] unto death
[1:47:35] i will study
[1:47:37] the devil's tactics
[1:47:38] i will not give in to the devil
[1:47:41] i will overcome and sit with jesus on
[1:47:43] his throne as he overcame and sat with
[1:47:46] his father on his throne
[1:47:48] i will overcome because
[1:47:51] i'm a soldier
[1:47:54] amen
[1:47:55] are you a soldier
[1:47:57] i got some questions for you
[1:48:00] have you been able
[1:48:02] to identify yourself
[1:48:04] in the scriptures this morning
[1:48:08] many are called to be soldiers but only
[1:48:11] a few are chosen
[1:48:14] there's only a few
[1:48:17] that are chosen to take the land
[1:48:20] it's not just something we agree with
[1:48:22] or even claim but it's something that we
[1:48:24] need to examine
[1:48:26] ourselves
[1:48:28] am i lining up
[1:48:29] with what i should be as a chosen
[1:48:31] soldier
[1:48:32] have i been at my post of duty have i
[1:48:35] made excuses and thinking i was only
[1:48:37] deceiving myself you know the bible says
[1:48:39] when you look at the word
[1:48:42] and you don't obey the word
[1:48:44] you're deceiving yourself now that's
[1:48:46] what the bible says
[1:48:48] you become your own enemy you actually
[1:48:51] are the deceiver of your own self
[1:48:54] have you been strong in the lord
[1:48:57] or have you been just strong in your own
[1:48:59] will
[1:49:01] last quote i want to read brother
[1:49:02] brandon was given an opportunity and we
[1:49:04] could just stand together
[1:49:05] to draw close to christ
[1:49:09] in this message called leadership
[1:49:13] he says now with our hands up i wonder
[1:49:15] how many in the building
[1:49:17] would now say would just say
[1:49:20] i'm going to stand
[1:49:21] i don't care who's sitting by you
[1:49:24] it's god talking to you
[1:49:26] and you really want to be a real
[1:49:28] christian see
[1:49:29] unless
[1:49:30] you're just impersonating
[1:49:33] i'd i'd rather go on out and be in the
[1:49:36] world
[1:49:37] in other words than just to be an
[1:49:38] impersonator
[1:49:40] i believe you would too he said he said
[1:49:42] now look he says just examine yourself
[1:49:46] by the word
[1:49:47] and by the message
[1:49:49] examine what a real christian should be
[1:49:55] rugged
[1:49:57] loving
[1:49:59] that's with only two words he used
[1:50:01] rugged
[1:50:02] loving
[1:50:04] not one of these modern
[1:50:06] christianity
[1:50:07] why a soft and flexible half dead rotten
[1:50:10] inbred see it's not real christianity
[1:50:14] live any kind of life you want to and
[1:50:15] belong to church
[1:50:18] don't you want that sweet fellowship
[1:50:20] with christ the holy spirit
[1:50:22] the conformity of your own heart to the
[1:50:24] word move right
[1:50:26] up into christ if you want that you
[1:50:29] would desire god to see you stand
[1:50:32] tonight right in this group if you'll
[1:50:34] just do it
[1:50:36] so here it is it's the end of the
[1:50:38] service
[1:50:39] what
[1:50:41] what would you like to do with this
[1:50:43] the word that god brought
[1:50:47] not the word that brother john brought
[1:50:49] the word that god brought to you to your
[1:50:52] heart
[1:50:54] do you want to
[1:50:57] do you want to move forward
[1:51:02] because when you leave the whole
[1:51:05] your whole life
[1:51:06] is going to be pulling you towards
[1:51:08] complacency
[1:51:10] it's going to be pulling you in the
[1:51:12] opposite direction of what we heard
[1:51:14] today
[1:51:15] and
[1:51:17] you got to leave here more determined to
[1:51:20] not let that happen on monday to not
[1:51:22] slip back
[1:51:24] but to keep pressing towards being that
[1:51:26] soldier
[1:51:28] is that your desire
[1:51:30] amen let's just sing
[1:51:32] must jesus bear the cross alone
[1:51:38] amen
[1:51:41] let the lord
[1:51:42] just speak to you
[1:51:44] buzz
[1:51:50] the cross alone
[1:51:54] and all
[1:51:56] the world
[1:52:00] [Music]
[1:52:12] for me
[1:52:14] [Music]
[1:52:24] shall set
[1:52:26] me free
[1:52:28] [Music]
[1:52:36] foreign
[1:52:37] [Music]
[1:52:56] with
[1:52:59] [Music]
[1:53:09] oh
[1:53:13] glorious
[1:53:17] [Music]
[1:53:46] go free
[1:53:49] [Music]
[1:54:04] amen
[1:54:06] how many feels
[1:54:09] that god
[1:54:13] is desiring you to carry
[1:54:16] the cross of self-denial
[1:54:24] it's up to us
[1:54:26] to
[1:54:27] to make
[1:54:28] the dedication that we can move forward
[1:54:32] becoming
[1:54:33] a very strong
[1:54:35] soldier
[1:54:37] now
[1:54:38] you would know
[1:54:42] someone would be strong
[1:54:44] if you could just hit him in the face
[1:54:46] and they would just stay there

[1:54:53] and they started swearing cursing and
[1:54:56] who you think you are
[1:54:58] well they wouldn't be strong
[1:55:01] so strength is is being able
[1:55:05] to carry out
