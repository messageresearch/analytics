everybody else up in prayer amen throughout the land I know that you know sometimes to look at somebody's life and you can just imagine there somebody's going through something you know whether it's

whole world in grafton work [Music] happy Father's Day to the mothers who had to be fathers when the fathers were wrong because even though it's not our major role I do believe the Lord has taught us to fill the gap we need to as you probably have noticed by now we're not ministering today you're probably wondering why I didn't tell you I did tell you because I did not know how can I tell you so you can't live higher than your pastor so I came down the stairs and alia was sitting in the chair and I just about lost it didn't know that our precious daughter and her family our precious brother Aaron and his family they kind of joined together I had this beautiful family and what a wonderful surprise it's been and I was just so blessed to be together as a family I didn't even ask for their arrington minister for a couple days after he was here and so we're just honored to have the ministry that God is given and gifted brother Aaron McGarry with honestly wish we could have him here all the time is how much I have respect Chris ministry and the revelation that God has given him and continues to grow and we've been blessed we've been blessed and we're gonna just leave the rest up to him if he wants to share but God is gonna use whatever gift that you present back to him yeah and but before we introduced brother Aaron we don't get to have sister Elizabeth much our sister a lot Lisa and we're gonna ask them to come and sing for the Lord and praise Him in song amen is this on the black one all right happy Father's Day I have the best dad this song was written by a believer loved it for a lot of years and I just thought it would be a nice one it reminds me of my dad when I listen to these words [Music] Satan stands before you accusing me of sin pressure is unceasing Lord I know whom I've been the wall should fall around me in your word I'll stand your hand and mine to guide me to my promised land I believe in the difference the token man I died believe me if that's what it is I died believing the catching away of your brow I died believing you're living inside [Music] Passons recall to memory my thoughts won't let me be the greatest battle ever fought rages on in me although I look defeated now just wait around and see [Music] the spirit of the Living God [Music] do battle for me I believe in the difference the token man I'd I believe in and that's what it is [Music] I died believing the catch dog catching away of your bride I die believing you're living inside your spoken word made flesh and me [Music] preparing your bride for eternity the statue of a perfect man is your plan for me recognising your word in the stay called elected anointed and place in service for the Living God the caps don't soon we shall me I don't believe in the difference the token man I believe in if pass or detained [Music] I'd die believing the catching away of your bra I died believing you're living inside [Music] singing we have to dive trying to help our neighbors helping our family helping everyone that's our calling Jesus died for us and the old same love inside of us that same faith inside of us Jesus had faith in us we've got to have faith for those that we speak to and all won't come but some will they're not gonna come without our faith amen amen we certainly appreciate that song and appreciate the life that sister Elizabeth has given back to God now God has given us all life it's our choice we either give it back to him or keep it for ourselves and what an honor it is to give our life back to the Lord and then it can spread you see it spreading in the children and then there being their behavior and how they how they are so it's we hold a lot of power in our grips amen and so we're thankful for God's Holy Spirit and all of us we can be a shiny light amen well let's stand together how many's happy to be in church this morning Amen God is here to bless us to lift us up and to have any places and to strengthen us in the power of his might amen let's get behind the word as brother Aaron comes to give us the wonderful words of life amen amen that saying only believes our brother comes Oh baby Oh [Music] Oh [Music] all things are possible Oh baby a man praise the Lord while you're standing if you could turn your Bibles to Matthew chapter 3 I'll be reading from Matthew chapter 3 and then also from Matthew chapter 17 I'm happy to be in the house the Lord today good to be gathered together we did surprise brother John and we probably should have known that even and surprising him he'd ask us to preach but I didn't even bother bringing a tie or a suit so I'm wearing all-purpose pants this morning you can fish in them you can drive in them you can preach in them and sister Anne was went out and did some shopping and she bought me a shirt and tie so I'm wearing my new favorite tie and a dress shirts at least from for those watching online it looks like I'm just not wearing a coat everyone else can see my shark socks which I think my son bought me is because I'm a lawyer and it's a professional affinity that we have with the Sharks but we so we may not be fully dressed as you normally would see us but we're comfortable with family today to be able to share the word of the Lord considered a great privilege to be able to do so so we're glad to be here with you Matthew chapter 3 verses 13 to 17 then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and cometh out to me and Jesus answering said unto Him suffer to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him in Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and then also in Matthew chapter 17 it's important to note that brother branham points out that in Matthew chapter 3 that had a special significance and that what we read in Matthew chapter 17 isn't just a repeat of it but it's actually a brother Graham called the adoption of his where God adopted his own son so it has a special significance not just another repeat or just another saying or another expression of that what took place on the Jordan River has a different significance but there's something that is repeated here that I wanted to point out Matthew chapter 17 verses 1 to 5 and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the Sun and his raiment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make three make here three Tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him if we could just bow our heads and a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we're grateful to be gathered together today in your house to be gathered together with believers who share a precious faith Lord of faith which has been quickened in this endtime for an endtime promise now Lord as we've gathered we're looking to you to keep a safe Lord to keep us healthy to sanctify the atmosphere Lord and sanctify our bodies and keep us well the Lord we've come in obedience to a promise we've come trusting in you we realize that regardless of the measures that we would take to keep from becoming ill lord if lest you watch over this house lest you watch over us Lord we watch in vain so we confess father that we're committing ourselves completely to you for your protection and father's we have gathered we have not done so in vain we have worshiped you and you've come and inhabited those praises now father speak take the bread of life and break it to us and Lord in the simplicity of it may each one of us be incurred we commit it to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and you may be seated this is gonna take a very very simple subject on fatherhood and I felt it would be appropriate for the day and being Father's Day and I'd find that I've known don't normally just if it's going to be Christmas or if it's going to be you know even any other holiday even sometimes with Easter it's not that I'm just you just try to focus on the subject matter and preach on the resurrection but you just yield yourself to the Lord and desire for him to quicken something and I felt he did just quicken something within this subject of fatherhood on Father's Day so my whole sermon is happy Father's Day if I didn't say the beginning my whole sermon is happy Father's Day and just an encouragement to fathers and if you're not a father and you you can derive from these very teachings on fatherhood a greater appreciation for the love that God has for you because we're wanting just to focus on the attributes of God and fatherhood to understand even what our role is as a father and it's a role that you never you never grow out of that it remains with you all your days and so a father is a head of a household or the founder of a family he is one that's the originator she just looked at definitions that wouldn't be secular wouldn't even be Christian definitions but just a father even in the natural is one who's the head of a household or a founder of a family he's the one who begets so he's called the originator of the family and fatherhood is a natural office of a man a man becomes a father by having children but what I want to focus on is how the fatherhood is an essential attribute of God the Father itself is a manifestation of God and fatherhood be in a manifestation of God that means there's a power behind it and there's a provision for him so we were just not on our own as fathers you're not on your own as parents but it's actually a manifestation of the attributes of God and fatherhood is an essential attribute of God as we read here in Matthew chapter 3 it says in lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son whom I'm well pleased so goddess I didn't define Christ as his son Jesus he says as my son in whom I'm well pleased and he realized it takes an understanding of the Godhead to be able to take they recognize what's taking place in this scripture some believe in the oneness so strongly that they just believe that this was just a big act or a drama somehow that a voice was speaking this is my son or that Jesus was praying to himself but we realized that God is not one like your fingers one and that even the oneness pentecostals understanding the Godhead it does not quite capture the true oneness of the father with the son and so he says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased then in Matthew chapter 17 it says while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice in out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him so he can recognize a difference the second time and that now he's saying here he him brother branham taught us that this was the adoption of his own son when he sent them out before witnesses and you see many different things typed in that adoption robe and he says here he him he speaks I speak no longer this is why Jesus could say it all power is given unto me above my father and he comes to his adoption and we know that his purpose was to lay down his life as a sacrifice for us all so he comes to his purpose once he's positioned but here what I want to point out is that God is declaring himself to be a father God is actually looking at Jesus and he's saying this is my son so he was willing to identify himself as being the father he's the one that created him this is the beginning of the creation of God he's the one that fathered him and he's I didn't define himself in the role of a father by saying this is my son he's willing to be identified as the father of Jesus and when he says this is my beloved son it means he's my esteemed son he's my dear son he's even - the word could be used as my favorite son he is one who is worthy of my love this is one that I'm I'm proud of this is my beloved son and in Psalms 89 verses six to 27 it says he shall cry unto me thou art my father my god and the rock of my salvation also I will make him my firstborn higher than the kings of the earth we know this speaks of Christ and here he's saying that he's going to cry unto me saying thou art my father my god so he's I didn't define God as his father and the rock of my salvation says and I'll make him my firstborn higher than the kings of the earth and we know that Jesus is the firstborn among many brethren so God has identified not just as the father of Christ but yet he has identified as a father and brother branham righteous in the church age book chapter 9 he says speaking of God he desired in love a family of his own a family of sons sons like himself so this speaks to the nature of God when we think of father's and we say happy Father's Day or you think about being a father or you think that of the father that God has given you in the flesh and the dad that you have at home it's not just the ability to bring forth children it's not just ability of father and child and we realize that it's just become it's just a natural process and it seems to be so easy that our we kind of lose the significance of how important that office is fatherhood is the office of being a father and it's not just an office because you have the physical ability to procreate but it's something that God identifies as been an attribute of himself says he desired and loved a family of his own of family of sons like himself so God desired to be a father and so when you see a father whether it be if it's perverted whether it would know regardless of how it is expressed the original is an attribute of God to be a father is an expression of God and if you look in the Old Testament you find that God is often referred to as the God of thy father Abraham the god of my father and Jacob and God is related to though he might be looked at in certain ways as one who looked out over Israel but yet Israel always regarded him to be a god over them and if he spoke of you the God to be the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob so that God was above them all and he was gone over them and it was your God and he may have been the god of your father but he wasn't your father God he was a God over the people and that was the way that God was viewed in the Old Testament but through Jesus Christ he's not just the God of thy father but he becomes God your father and so Jesus changes the relationship of God to the people it's not just one over you but yet this is one who is a father to you so the god of thy father actually becomes God your Father and Jesus says it in many different places in Matthew 5:48 he tells you to be therefore perfect even as your heavenly Father which is in heaven is perfect so it's not just be perfect as God is perfect but he says be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so Jesus when he says that he's actually showing that the ability must be there that if your father in God is perfect in heaven and then you're told to be perfect as a mere human then you say well this is an impossibility but rather he brings a relationship you should be perfect just like your daddy's perfect be perfect just like your father the one that brings you forth is perfect so then you realize the nature must be there to be perfect the the power is there to be perfect the possibilities there to be perfect and it's only made so by relationship he doesn't just don't be perfect as God is perfect he says be therefore perfect as your heavenly father which would give you the genes which would give you the nature and then as a father would nurture that nature to allow perfection to come forth and so it's beautiful how Jesus then gives us a relationship to God not as one who's subject to him but as one that King from him he is our Father says in Matthew chapter 23 verse 9 and you read this it's kind of remarkable that there to be an organized religion that would violate this it says call no man your father upon the earth it says for one is your father which is in heaven I'm so there's one it one which is your father and he says what in heaven Jesus is going to great lengths not to merely identify himself as the Son of God but also to place us in relationship to God only one is your father which is in heaven and in the Gospels 21 times Jesus refers to God as your father even when he's praying let them be one father let them be one even as you and I are one so though we would look beauties assess the only begotten son he was at the time the only begotten Son but now we know we know he's the firstborn among many brethren and that God is becoming this family that God wanted to be a father he wanted to have a family of sons like himself so now we are in relationship to God in the same way that Jesus was he is our Father God is our Father Jesus praying that we would be one with God just as he was one and brother branham writes this in the church age book chapter four he says I know thy poverty but thou were but thou are rich he says there it is again and as he's quoting from the smyrnaean church age he says there it is again see him walking up and down in the midst of his church like a father he's looking down upon his family he is the head of his household he is the provider he is the protector this is God's relationship to his church this is God's relationship to his children he is the head of this household he is the provider he is the protector and so I want you to begin to notice the expression of pure fatherhood and and not even I although I believe it would be extremely beneficial for us to have a greater depth of revelation of God's care for us and God's promises to us but also as fathers and speaking to fathers today and myself being instructed by then by the by these things we can recognize the pure expression of fatherland that God as a father is looking down upon his family he's not just the head of the household to be served and the head of the household he gets the choice seat at the table he gets the choice cut of meat he's the one that gets first and he's the one that gets everything but he's also the provider he is protector so this is that this is an expression of fatherhood and we see it being expressed in God himself for the randoms rights further in the same chapter God was the leader of the people actually he was their king and if he just left it in this image of King we would see one has been the the final authority the final say the one that all the kingdom Revere's and worships and is subject to and they bowed down to him the king of his subjects you have his domain and all those that would serve him in his domain but he says he was a father king so he wanted to change the relationship of God to us is not just merely king but father king so we're not just subjects but were family I think it's something that brother branham goes to great lengths to identify that out of the open of the seals it's not a king who's unrelated who is now bringing slaves to his side he wants to call his bride to his side it has to do with relationship and so he says he is a father King he took care of Israel like a man cares for his family now depending on what kind of father you had you might look at it this is a good thing you might look at it as a bad thing but it's like he took care of Israel like a man cares for his family he says he fed them fought their battles smooth the way their difficulties and settled their problems that's the definition of fatherhood you feed him you fight their battles you smooth away their difficulties you settle their problems this is what God did for Israel when he took care of his family he fed he thought he's smooth he's settled this is how God was over Israel he didn't just give him things to eat but he also fought their paddles he didn't just fight their battles and feed them but he smoothed away difficulties and he settled their problems this is how God expressed himself as a father to Israel this is how we then see an example of true fatherhood that we are not only just to feed our children but we fight their battles we smooth away their difficulties we settle their problems and maybe not just for the children but for the family this is the role that we take on and you'll find that there's fathers and a real fathers I could say about brother John they never stop being a father even when their children grow up and they get married and they start having their own children they still have a desire to feed to fight their battles smooth the way their difficulties settle their problems because it's an attribute of fatherhood so so like a man cares for his family he fed them fought their battles smooth the way their difficulties instead of their problems he just busied himself over them that beautiful he says he just busy himself only them he was system manie's days I think sometimes a busy parent might have a negative connotation they call maybe helicopter moms they're just always there hovering over their children but this is what God did he just busied himself over his room he was always concerned you want to know how concerned he was he told him which seemed to wash sir pots in how to shave their beard what what fabrics they can wear together and why was he doing it he was doing all this to teach him things he was doing all this to protect him don't eat these kind of food and don't do this and don't do that be there oh my that's just legalism that was strict no it was God as being the wise parent know how to protect them he knew how to establish boundaries and give them order and that it would create discipline and it would keep them from partaking in things that were harmful it would preserve them down the road and how high breeding will will cause things to be degraded and to become weak they say don't mix this and don't do that don't wear your Cotton's with your linens my goodness what's happening we've got a MoU hybrid into one thing now right but go up that was said well that seems to be really strict how God but God just knew this was what was best I mean you ponder and think about it God told the children of Israel not to eat certain meats not to eat certain things prepared certain ways and certain things if they're if they're rodents and things strangled he said don't eat them why cos God knew those foods were the best for their bodies but diet to preserve them he gave us some hay these are think I made the human body and I think I've got a pretty good idea of what would be better and I'm not necessarily advocating the kosher diet but if you're looking for one that's healthy I think the kosher diet would make most sense it's scriptural some people say well let's go back to the Garden of Eden well that was four bodies that weren't falling and so God was looking out after them he was caring for them he was busying himself with his children and I find it striking that children of Israel even to this day the Jews will stay very very strict with their dietary laws and laws of cleansing and when the Black Death the plague Black Death came over Europe there's over 60 million people dying and communities ravished in millions and millions of people dying but there was one group of people that weren't dying it was the Jews and they were surviving at such numbers seemingly unimpacted by the whole thing they were surviving and healthy and alive and and there because they weren't dying they begin to blame the Jews for the plagues but you know was keeping the Jews alive the law that God had given him thousands of years before not to eat certain meats and because they wouldn't eat rodents and they were wouldn't weren't eating certain foods they weren't getting the plague and so God gave them a law that would not just preserve them in those days but if they honored it it would keep him through all days why because this is an attribute of god he just busied himself over his children and this is what fatherhood should look like not a man who busies himself with his own ambitions or his own desires and he's only concerned about himself and he used fatherhood as being like me but then they finally got to the top of the multi-level marketing scheme I'm finally at the top and now everyone's beneath me you're all my downline so everything you do I get a percentage of no that's that's not the way that God that's not the way fatherhood works it's almost as if he should just flip the pyramid upside down it's the one who's at the bottom he's beneath the family he served in the family puts the family's needs above his own and the only way that we can properly do that it's not just to focus on the family but to be focused on the word and being focused on the word then that we do that for our family's benefit but this is what fatherhood looks like fatherhood is one man who bizzy's himself over his family and there are certain ways that we could view fatherhood to where we placed the man in a position of authority to where he is this he is the ruler he's the head and it can get a little bit out of balance because then you just think you're just under his thumb but that's not the way that God has arranged it God has arranged it in the way that it's a it's a necessary order for things to function properly but it doesn't make one part greater than another even at the the phrase is God establishes an order we sometimes say well you're the you know I'm here at the bottom man on a totem pole and they found when they when they looked at the they investigated the the origin and the etymology of the totem poles they trying to figure out was there a particular ranking that was being expressed in the totem pole and in some cultures and hidden cultures there was no particular ranking or order that was to be expressed in the totem pole but in others the one that was at the bottom was the most important and we said well you're just the I'm just the low man on the totem pole well then you're the most important because in a totem pole they're often the most than the biggest ones they're bigger than the other ones and they're supporting the whole structure so even the idea I just want to be the top man on the totem pole well that's probably cuz you the least the least important but it's not necessarily to have to have it as one better than the other but it's just the way things are arranged and so intent in the family you can have they headed the family the head of the household but it's not to make him at the dictator and out of the brute and the boss over the whole thing but yet there must be an order and gods only provided place of worship says the family of God obeys the order of the family order of the father of the family so the family of God obeys the order of the father of the family and so he is the father the family we obey his order and that's instructed to us as fathers that we must have an order that if the family of God obeys the order of the Father then a father must have an order but Vestas every one of his children obeys every word to the order because they are part of him he says we live in our homes like I live you live in your home like the Joneses like the Joneses living and the house of God we lived by the Word of God and everyone that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and any other fraud we won't listen to him amen to that and so as we see that Express with the family the family of God that God is the father and as his children we obey his order and we obey his word he says in our home we live like branham's live that means there must be an order to the family and it's the father that sets that order the Bible says in proverbs 1:8 my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother so a mother must have a law and a father must have an instruction in proverbs 6:20 my son keep thy father's commandment and forsake not the law of thy mother so the father must have a commandment and again the mother must have a law these are things that are in God's Word father has to have an order a father has to have instructions a father has to have Commandments and brother Branham says in the leadership he says one of the last sermons he preaches this is the one in October of 65 he said the first thing is you taste speaking of leadership it's not the last one he ministers but he does the same theme in the next one that he preaches he's talked about the things that impact us he's his first is the mother's kindness then the father's word so this is instructive to us God has a word God has a commandment God has things that are very detailed for us God has thought through things and he's he's given thought to how were to be cared for him what's best for us and then it becomes incumbent upon a father to be thoughtful becomes incumbent upon a father to not just be reactive but proactive where he's thinking through things in advance instead of just dealing with them when they come up oh my goodness what do I do now but rather thinking ahead of time how he can act and how he can put things in order for the time when trouble would come so he says then the father's word after the mother gives you your first step then you look to your daddy he said all of us for wisdom because he is the head of the house he says not that he's any smarter and I think maybe at least Elliott's already picking up on this in that he knows more than me so it's not that you obey your dad just because he's smarter because maybe he's not smarter he says then you look to your dad for wisdom because he's the head of the house not that he's any smarter but he's made a leader of his family so he fathered what we follow what our daddy says do that's wait because he's been made to the Father he's the one that sets the order he's the one that puts things into place he says now son I'd like for you to do a certain thing then we listen to him because it's wisdom listen he's learned a whole lot and we've got to ask him to see what he learned and then we can profit by his what he has learned he tells us now go now don't go and do this because I did that my father father told me not to do it but I did it and it caused this to happen to me something bad then he that daddy tells us how to do it and what to do right so it's not because he's better and that he's stronger he's why that he's that he's smarter but he's been through things he's seen things he's experienced things so it's incumbent upon him even to process his own experiences and then share them with his children so that they don't make the same mistake I read one time I think was in The Reader's Digest where they said that when I left for college I was just so disappointed and discouraged how little my parents knew upon coming back after four years I was shocked at how much they learned in such a short period of time but it's it's maybe not the widths and they are the smarts and the academic prowess that makes them fit to be parents but it's what they've been through the experiences that they have so we can just gather from this that has gone busied himself over his children and that God gives an order to his family to obey we see these same attributes for us as fathers and within the dynamics of our own family we're to hear the instruction of the father were to keep the father's commandment that were to follow the order of the father not because he's smarter but because God has placed him in that position and that God will actually honor us for honoring him even if this decision may not be right as long as it's not contrary to the word and we honor him God will honor us and honoring him and it's the father who'll answer it's the father we'll have to make those try brother brim ask the question in what is fatherhood it's an attribute of God he says about Parenthood he says and he's the source of parenthood this is a I think this should be encouraging to parents that if God is the original parent that I as a parent I am in an office that god holds therefore he understands and being understanding he will look out after me he will give me what I have need of I don't think that any mother should ever despair that she's not able to raise her children and you might think all this world I have a new child and I'm trying to raise a baby in this age that we're living it's so filthy it's so preferred and it's so chaotic and things are so just upset and turned around and what are things gonna look like don't worry don't fret God's made you that parent that mother over that child don't be afraid God will give you what you have Nita to guide that child even in a dark time like this brother Branham says in the message conflict between God and Satan and Parenthood originated in God because he was the first parent he's the first father he says don't you think that God says he gave to his children and he's liking it to this and I've just kind of skip over a little bit of it we as parents look after our children and we want the best for him and even the Bible Jesus says what if a son asked his father for something if asked for bread would he give him a stone if you asked for an egg would he give him a serpent he's saying your own natural father's know how to treat you in that way how much more your heavenly father and so as we think that if a natural father if God is a father he said he gave to its children and provided for them the best thing that could be provided for them this is the nature of God to provide for his children therefore is the nature fatherhood to provide the best that you can for your children it doesn't always mean the latest technical technology it doesn't mean the nicest cars and the nicest things but it's the best things and here in the Bible brother brother branham's identified in the very big what did he give Adam and the woman in the beginning the best thing he could give he gave them the word and he says God equipped his children what did he equip them with the word and so it speaks to an attribute of fatherhood that we are tasked with and we are responsible for equipping our families given them the tools that they need to succeed give him the resources that they need to guide themselves in this time that we're living and they need and it's not just the natural things I think we assumed the natural things and yes it applies to natural things a man who doesn't provide for his own household is worse than an infidel and so we're not just saying wow you know we're hungry well have faith and create bread no we were to provide we're to provide for children were to provide the natural thing but it goes beyond just the natural thing because there's been many men who provided shelter and clothing and food for their families but it was actually a curse because they themselves were consumed with their jobs consumed with their income consumed with promotions gave their children all the natural things that they could ever want but yet because there wasn't the proper equipment spiritually the proper relationship between father and child the children just waste away the family unit breaks up so it's not just a matter of providing natural things but even equipping in emotional and affectionate realms and in a spiritual realm he says God equipped his children that's what fatherhood should do that's what fathers should do they should have quit their children as the Bible says that is to me was a it's an extraordinary thought I don't believe I've had the privilege of ministering here but the Bible tells our children to honor their father and their mother and they're asked to do this regardless of whether they're Christians or not regardless of whether or not they have the Holy Ghost they they're told honor thy father and mother and he said well I I'm not a Christian I don't have the Holy Ghost it doesn't matter you this is not a commandment that you are expected to fulfill once you have the Holy Ghost but from the youngest who's able to understand those words they are taught by the Bible by Scripture by God they're required description honor their father and mother apart from a new birth experience and then you look into the word and find that there's a consequence for not honoring your father and mother and in the Old Testament it was death and there's a there's a and the way that God views rebellion in the way that God read review a child who does not honors father and mother that's very striking that the anger and the judgment that God has towards a child who does not honor their father and mother even if they don't have the Holy Ghost they're told to honor them to obey them children obey your parents in the Lord that's what a child must do even from the youngest age they are to obey their parents and they're to honor them and when you realize that the scripture that speaks to the fathers and says don't provoke your children to anger and not to frustrate your children the father's can actually impair their child's ability to obey them and honor them therefore it's incumbent upon the parents to do everything they can to see that their children can one obey them and have cause to honor them and not just lord over them you're supposed to obey me you're supposed to honor me but facilitate that honor encourage that honor equip them with the tools and resources they need to obey and to be able make their job easy if God's requiring obedience make it easy for them to obey if God's requiring honor make it easy for them to honor because that's what father's do they must equip their children and it's an attribute of God and now with and not to scare you that that's going to be a very very very long but it could be very long but not very very very very long but just I want to focus on a specific attribute of fatherhood and identify it within God and with the description that there's a very specific attribute of fatherhood that I'd like to just encourage encourage us with and that that we can recognize it it's how God views us and it's how God works with us okay so often times you think that God is just kind of he's just the one with the wooden spoon or the Bell waiting to spank us well that's not how God works he does chastises he does correct us but let me say this he also praises us a lot more than we realized and brother branham says this and writes this in the church age book he says how beautifully the Savior praises and commends his children he takes full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior he knows that there is weakness amongst them but I said he does not cry out against it isn't that just like the Lord he knows how to encourage us in the right matters and discourage us in the wrong matters in other words discourage us from doing the wrong things to to point out things that are wrong that we ought not to do he knows how to encourage us in the right things discourage us in the wrong things we could all learn a good lesson right there in running the church and our families isn't better still we could all learn a good lesson in that God deals with each one of us in exactly this way it begins to talk about how God is a rewarder and he's faithful to to remember your labor for him and that he'll he'll grant your award in those things but notice how brother mem identifies this attribute of the father of our of God our Father he praises and commends his children and he's taken account of their their fine attitudes and their fine behaviors he's recognizing good behavior he's recognizing certain attributes and characteristics he says he knows there's weakness but he's not just crying out against the weakness to begin with because he knows how to encourage us to do the right things and he knows how to discourage us from doing wrong things he knows how to to to build us up so he doesn't just kick open the door and says you're a bunch of Rascals you're lazy you're no good clean this room but he comes in he starts praising them further from their care and their kindness and praise them for their attitudes and their behaviors and I believe that they even teach this with respect to leadership then if you need to correct something if you want someone to change their behavior you need to address something don't just sit them down and say hey mark you really blew it today you ran that forklift right into that lady and did this you did that and you and just beat them and tear them down you say hey you do a great job you show up on time you're always early you're always helpful you're willing to stay late you do this and you're always taking going the extra mile and we've noticed that you're always willing to volunteer even if it doesn't mean extra pay and and you build them up and then you say but we've noticed one thing that you could do a little bit better I mean you've built them up you've given them confidence that you have recognized they've gotten value you recognize that they're able to you able to do the job right and they're not just washed up and no good and don't have any abilities yes this is someone who's paying attention this is someone who cares this is it gives you confidence that what's coming next is not your fire you know you're putting this state well I'm willing to listen I understand and it says and this is something you can do better and you're almost at that point you're ready to do better fine they recognize I'm trying hard they seem that I do these things well and it's build you to a place where you're not tore down but you're in a good a better position to receive instruction and this is exactly brother Graham's identifying this attribute in God how beautifully the Savior praises and commends his children even though he sees weakness he's not just pointing out weakness first he's praising them encouraging them in their strong parts in their good parts in their potential and their ability and then he can correct them he says oh how he encourages us in the right matters he knows how to encourage the right matters he said we could all learn a good lesson right there in running the church yeah and running our families not running them off but running them operating them allowing them to function properly and thrive he knows how to encourage us we have to know how to encourage children encourage one another in right things this is an attribute of God and in Matthew chapter 3 in Matthew chapter 17 we read it this is exactly what God does to Jesus he said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased we know that the brother branham takes this and it's remarkable the the prophetic inside he had to turn this around to understand it in its depth as it says in Colossians 1:19 for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness do it pleased the father that in him all fullness do should dwell he says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell and I'm pleased to dwell in him and yet the thing there stands out the part that I want to point out this morning is he says I am well pleased it pleased the father to dwell in him it is pleased in his son needs to take pleasure in to be favorably inclined to and God was a secret about it he publicly vocalized and declared his pleasure in his son and in doing so I believe he reveals a special attribute of fatherhood that this is a this is a I'm a necessary attribute of fatherhood he publicly is willing to say that's my son I'm proud of him this is my son I'm identified with him and not with it the shame well yeah I guess you got to take the good with the bad and we have to be careful sometimes we joke around and we said well this is my favorite son and this is my this is my favorite daughter and I'm not afraid to say that Eliza's my favorite daughter there's certain times that maybe that wouldn't be appropriate that if you had two daughters and it doesn't matter how you know even sometimes we use the languages say well this is my oldest and he's the smart one and this is my second oldest and he's the tough one he's been my challenge he's been the one that's been really really rough in that right little guy have you been like kind of the knucklehead and and he's like whoa daddy's saying it about me mommy's saying about me so what did they adopt the language yeah how much I'm the problem child I'm the challenge I'm the rough one and it's almost as if they want to conform to that to please you because that's the language you use on that's the way you talk about it and so we're being instructed here we want to encourage children in the right thing to discourage them from doing wrong things and one of them and if I haven't said it at the outset when I turn to this it's the ability of the father to praise and lift up this is an essential attribute of fatherhood they have the power to lift up to pray to raise their show the places they never thought they could go just to the praise of them and God says that about Jesus he vocalized and declared his pleasure and his own said this is my son I'm pleased with him he says a Luke chapter 2 verse 52 and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man he increased in favor with God this has tons that God's favor for Christ increased favor means it affords joy it affords pleasure it affords delight God was not ashamed to declare it to his own son you please me I derive pleasure from you I I derive great joy from you when I when I see you my son I'm happy when I see you I'm proud it makes me proud to be a dad in Psalms eighteen nineteen he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me means to take pleasure in tintin to desire to be pleased with notice how the Scriptures is speaking of this nature of God towards his son that Jesus increased in favor with God and God was not ashamed to tell his own son you're my favorite for you is increasing you're making me prouder day by day the buttons on my shirt are about to pop oh my my 12th my chest is swelling out for you I'm proud of you son he says because he delighted in me and Joe chapter 1 verse 8 it might seem to be somewhat of a paradox but says in the Lord said unto Satan has thou considered my servant Joe he said well how in the world did job ever get to this body was in what oh it starts right here yeah God says this is God now speaking about Joe that there's none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth God in the shoe is evil I read this just so you can see that God has these thoughts that's not the Bible tell us that I know my thoughts towards you the thoughts that she he has thoughts of peace and not a thoughts of a struggle and frustration that God has thoughts about you thoughts of peace pleasant thoughts to bring to expected to bring into a great climax and a great glory and a great triumph and these are the thoughts he had of Joe and it's these thoughts that actually carry joke throughout the whole thing there's none like him in the earth he's perfect and upright he's one that fears me and he's actually saying you can touch anything in his life just don't take his life and he still won't curse me he stood he still won't deny me why because God knew the character that Joe had and he's not shy to praise Joe he's not shy to speak up for him in John chapter 8 verse 54 says jesus answered if I honor myself my honor is nothing it is my father that honoureth me of whom you say that he is your God it is my father that honors mean it means to praise took stole to magnify to celebrate he says my father celebrates me my father extols me my father praises me and so Jesus in his relationship with the father must have been receiving praise must have been receiving magnification must have been felt celebrated as a son he felt that the father celebrated him as a son he felt that the father extolled him and magnified him and praised and this is how God was making his own son feel to her he didn't need to brag himself his coming his father would do it for him following my self-monitors nothing I could go around I like tell me oh well I'm a I'm a preacher this I'm a preacher that I'm I'm a I can do this I can do that and say well I mean he's just kind of doing his own horn but then when the dad says it it's different in John chapter 12 verses 28 to 29 it says father glorify thy name but it says glorify thy name the son in the hebrew the hebrew son means the builder of the family name so when a father has a son the son is going to be the continuation and the builder of that family name is going to continue that legacy he says father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again he says I praised you might extolled you I've magnified y'all glorify the name and I will glorify it again there's no ceasing in this glorification there's no stopping in this praise there's no end to my honor I have glorified it and I will glorify it again and the people therefore that stood by had heard it and said that it funded and others said an angel spake to him God publicly declaring I have glorified it and I will glorify it again that's just let's just say it in a very succinct way it is the role the father to praise his children it is the role the fathered to encourage the family to encourage his children it is the it is a necessary attribute of the father to lift up his children not that they would have to defend on their own not this y'all you you pull yourself up by your own bootstraps I did it myself you need to do it too I'm again I recognize that this is the this is a calling and father this is a calling of a dad to lift up his children to instill in them greatness to instill in them courage to teach them that if they honor Christ and they put God first and nothing is impossible with God it may be impossible to man but with God nothing is impossible and you're still in the courage and greatness paul liken himself to a father in the gospel and in doing so it affords an example of true fatherhood he says in 1st corinthians chapter 4 14 to 17 i write not these things to shame you that shouldn't be our role as parents to shame shame our children we have to be careful sometimes especially in a public setting when our children do something wrong we feel shame because we think it's reflective of us as parents and so in with the sense of shame and through pride we chastise our children and we do it in a way that hurts their spirits and Woo's them in a way that they ought not be but we feel that we're preserving our own image in front of other people sometimes people try to provoke you into correcting your children in front of them because they want to see you given to your kid and you have to realize I know how to discipline my children I know how to reach them you may think that I need to just beat my child or chastise them and tear them down right now and that's gonna fix the problem no that's not gonna be what's fixed the problem you can acknowledge you're wrong and you can tell the person I realized that what they did was wrong I will deal with this appropriately and as we do within our family and not be pressured into doing something that's wrong I tell you one thing if I just say this personally myself I feel that what the the only ones who are going to be able to navigate the current political climate and the social climate is the Bride of Christ is the true love of God in their arms who isn't so quick to take sides and so great to point things out throng on this side and the extreme and fanatical on the other but to be able to recognize certain things that are wrong whether they be systemic whether they be repetitive direct eyes that's not right under no circumstances that are right and then also not trying to take sides and divide the true Krish is the only one that can navigate because this society's turning to bullies on each side and they're trying to bully the bully and when you bully the bully the bully it becomes bullied err and it never gets better until someone's willing to humble themselves to the bully and say how can I help you why are you that way why do you have so much anger why do you have so much bitterness and to recognize people are the way they are because of wrongs that have been done things that have happened and to be the one that can express love and care and to see the things change and begin in whatever level you can help to make change instead of making it worse and these things that Paul writes he says I'm writing not to shame you and all too often it seems as if things are only said and done to shame another person he says but as my beloved Sons I warn you notice he's telling I'm not writing to shame you but I'm writing to warn you as my beloved sons this is the language of Paul is using to these children for though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ you have yet not many fathers for Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel wherefore I beseech you be followers of me why is that people have such a hard time even if we said we follow the teachings of brother Branham I mean posted follow me and the whole Christian hymn saying you're just following a man impulse that they follow me it was Paul not a man absolutely he was a man and he wasn't afraid to say follow me being followers of me and he doesn't say here as I follow Christ he just says follow me he said for this cause of my sin unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ as I teach everywhere in every Church Paul is speaking to the believers at Corinth as a father he's even recognized in Timothy as a son he says I don't write to shame you I'm not trying to tear you down I'm trying to warn you because you're my children and you may have many many instructors but I'm the one who food the gospel has brought you forth and so follow me because I have your best in mind follow me because I am following Christ because I'm lifting up the word for your hour and for your day and it's instructive it's instructive to them let me just clarify by no means saying that we follow a man I'm just saying it seems funny to me that they accused us of following a man when it scripturally Paul himself said follow me it says in Romans chapter 1 verse 8 notice acted with this established here as Paul is saying you are my beloved sons I'm your father and the gospel follow me notice the language he uses in the different letters that he writes I'm gonna read enrollments and Philippians and Colossians and Thessalonians notice the language that he uses first I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world Romans 1:18 says first now before I go any further first I want you to know I thank God for you for your faith is spoken from the whole world now you might imagine before you would go even further into Romans this is one of the first things that Paul wants to do when he wrote him he meant to just race it to you know good good-for-nothings and Rome to you slackers at Corinth no to the elect of God to the church to the faithful to the call it was a way of saying I know who you I want to praise you I want to extol you on a little job he says I thank God through Jesus Christ for you Paul the Prophet the messenger to the aged the very father in the gospel is saying that he thanks God for us because you our faith has spoken throughout the whole world he's beginning with praise to the Philippians 1st chapter 1 verses 3 to 6 I think my god upon every remembrance of you every time I think of you I thank God for you always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy listen to how he talks about the Philippians always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy I joyfully make requests on your behalf I thank God in remembrance for you just for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now why could you imagine being a believer in that church Paul this great man within the church is one who's preaching something nobody else was preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ the truth of the body of Christ being his church these great revelations that he's bringing and here he said I thank God for you I thank God for your fellowship from the first day until now I make request on your behalf with joy and when I think of you I'm excited and I'm grateful for your fellowship Paul doesn't write say I'm the Prophet to this age I don't need you you just need to follow me you just need to get happy with what I teach you just need to do things the way I asked you to do him he's saying oh I love you I couldn't be here without you Oh your fellowship in the gospel I thank God for your fellowship from the first day until now I imagine he could have just said I don't know what I would do without you Colossians chapter 2 verse 5 for though I'd be absent the flesh and am i with you in the spirit join and be holding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ what made Paul happy he says I'm joy beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith as I see your steadfastness as I behold your order as they behold the way that you though I'm not there I'm here happy for you I'm proud of you and it was his way of encouraging and it's not just reverse psychology this was his way this was this is not just this isn't psychologists oh well that's just psychology oh that's just an old psychological trick well I mean okay it's the word if it has if it does something that am I thinking it does something to my mind and it works and as long as it's in the word let's use it and so it's not that kind of psychology or some kind of trick I'll never forget when we were and I may have shared this story with you one time before I yeah I think I'm only ever shared at one time before but we were at the beach in San Diego and we were catching all these crabs on the beach we had just buckets full of them and my my grandma wanted to throw the crabs back into the ocean really man we've been working all day long for these crabs and she said I know I know Aaron go throw him back because he always obeys his grandma he's a good boy and what am I gonna do at that point oh no I'm not a good boy I don't obey you I'm keeping the crabs I was like sorry guys whew you know the crackling right back in the ocean what was it it worked on me and in this way Paul is going to encourage a greater steadfastness and encourage the greater order by saying your order in steadfastness pleases me let's just take the cautions were a little bit out of order if he had written to the disorderly a Kalasha then they would have been horrible oh I guess we're them disorderly let's listen let's own it but no he encouraged them and he he had a way of reaching them and this is this is the lid this is the language of a father to his children to the best audience first first Thessalonians chapter 1 verses 2 & 3 we give thanks to God always for you all making mention of you in our prayers remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope and our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our Father I remember without ceasing your work of faith your labor of love and your patience of Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ this is the language of a father to his children he said I right and you not to shame you but you're my beloved sons and as a father speaking to a fine son it is the role of a father to encourage to praise to lift up to instill greatness in his children he says I thank God for you I think in Kherson do you realize your faith is spoken of throughout all the world every time I think of you I thank God and every prayer with joy I make requests for you and I for your fellowship from the first day until now even though I'm not there with you in the flesh I'm with you in spirit and I have joy as I behold your order your steadfastness I thank God for you all the time and I remember that and always remember your work of faith your labor of love your patience of Hope this is the language of a father this is the kind of language we can adopt as fathers he says in first Corinthians 11:2 now I praise you brethren that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinance as I delivered them to you I praise you and then when he writes to the crib this this is after he wrote that first letter had a lot of Correction in it he was called him out for some pretty bad things but yet in that first letter he says now I praise you brother even though there's hard things that are being said things that are being corrected he went he didn't do without the praise he says now I praise you and then after he'd praised them and corrected them now he follows up at 2nd corinthians 7 he says for behold verses 11 to 16 for behold this selfsame sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yeh would be him and desire yea what zeal yea what revenge and all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter Paul is now commanding them and complemented after they fixed it it wasn't I told you you know I can't even believe I had to tell you guys you knuckleheads you should have known from the beginning that was wrong but no he encourages him he's like so oh my goodness you started a godly way and what careful said rod look at your your indignation your feel your fear your himmat desire what revenge all you are approved you are clear in this matter you don't have to keep looking over your shoulder don't worry about it as a father would want to give his children confidence that they that they they they've atoned for the wrong they've responded correctly and they doesn't isn't dangled over their head like you're going to get it any moment because you did this and they're in a compromised state he was them to feel as if they've been restored back to the right position so they could have confidence going forward I tell you one of the worst things about leadership and I've recognized it it's one of the most damaging things about the wrong kind of leadership is they keep you in a constant state of brokenness so you feel that you're always dependent upon their leadership and that's the wrong kind of leadership it's not leadership it's manipulation it's not leadership its control and it's abused to always make you feel broken so you always need their help to get fixed and Paul did not keep the cringes in this broken state he and they said look you've cleared yourself and then he says in verse 14 for I have boasted for if for if I have boasted anything to him he speaking about Titus if I boast and anything to him of you I am not ashamed so despite what he wrote the first time and despite whatever we might have thought about the Corinthians Paul is boasting of the Corinthians to Titus he says I'm not ashamed but as we spake all things to you in truth even so are boasting which I made before Titus is found a truth I have boasted if I boast anything to him about you I wasn't wrong if I bragged on you to Titus it was the truth and his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he remembered the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling you received him I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things don't you realize the Corinthians of all churches could have been the ones where the you know they you book of Corinthians look up the book of Coretta you look these are Corrections the book of Christie's these are letters of Correction to the Church of Corinth and they would always carry the scarlet letter emphasis always just pointing them look at what a Paul can teach us and he's had to correct you weren't being positionally placed here being corrected but he didn't leave him there he doesn't just leave him in this compromised State and I can't believe you let that kind of feel that has to take place in the church he says I rejoice that I have confidence in you in all things building up their courage building up their faith building up their position in Christ as a real father he's patting them on the back and even as they're whimpering and they're crying and they realized they did something wrong and they feel the shame he says oh no no there's no need for shame I've been bragging about you to Titus and maybe they thought well he was just he was probably lying too tight as they probably probably just wanted Titus to not be afraid to come over here he said no no I I'm bragged on him and it was the truth I didn't say anything I have to take back every motion I made about you before Titus is found a truth it's what he says he says and I want you to know I had a confidence in you in all things and that beautiful now that's destructive test his father's but remember that's how he feels about you that's how God feels about you first Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 11 will close with this scripture for we know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father death his children this is what he says a father does he absorbs he comforts he charges he says as the father death his church says I have done this as a father in the gospel and then this becomes instructive to us as father's we must exhort we must comfort we must charge to exhort to console to encourage to strengthen by consolation to strengthen by comfort using consolation and comfort we encourage them and we strengthen them he says we exhorted we comforted to use words to comfort it means to be alongside of speaking to use words to calm to use words to encourage and console and to address one whether by way of admonition and incentive hints to encourage or console' we are required as fathers to comfort to use words to calm to use our words to encourage them to consult to address them by way of admonition or even incentive give them incentive in other to encourage them or consultant sometimes we think well my love language is money i buy i buy i buy i buy i buy listen your children need to hear it hear from your own mouth these words to be alongside up with their arm random i'm proud of these son you're doing a good job to encourage them and in charge we absorb we comfort and we charge means to utter honorable testimony to give a good report I've charged you does it mean we think charge you've been charged with the crime no this is different even charged with an honorable testimony you've been given a good report we exhort we comfortably charge I'm giving you an honorable testimony I'm speaking well of you I'm telling you you're a good son you're doing a good job dad is proud of you the musicians were to come I just want to repeat again that statement that Brenda Brennan wrote in the church age book how beautifully the Savior praises and commences children I knows how to encourage us in the right matters and discourage us in the wrong matters we could all learn a good lesson right here running the church and our families Oh My isn't it wonderful to know this this is how God feels about us and it and it wonderful to know that it's what God wants us to do his father's my sons I wanted to do a better job as a dad I'm called to encourage you to exhort you to comfort you to charge you my daughter I want to do a better job as a dad I was going over these notes I was looking at these things I'm like II I feel like a hypocrite preaching it but I'm glad to preach it cuz I don't know if it's in the word it's in me and I say Amen to it I said Lord let me busy myself with my family let me care for my family like God cared over Israel could we all say that you never stop doing it this is how grandpa's feel about their there's their their grandchildren this is how this is how grandparents want to help encourage and facilitate their children's respect for their parents we're all working together this is what family's for there's people that will be a part of this church you don't have natural family and this church becomes that family they don't have because it functions like a family and within the family of God they take place as children and they recognize father figures and they have sisters and mother figures and that's how the body of the Christ should work so I myself today I'm saying Lord let this be so for me I humble myself to this I accepted we thank God for our natural fathers that he's given us the care that they had forced we thank God for his care for us in the love that he has for us let's stand why don't we just offer up a prayer of thanksgiving to God our Father for the great love that he has forced the care that he has for us and how he's manifested all these things for us and then submit ourselves he his parents and his father's today to be what he's asked us to be your gracious Heavenly Father Lord first we thank you for being a good father or there's a song out you're a good good father that's who you are it might be a catchy melody but Lord is the truth you're a good god you're a good father and Lord it can be said why would you allow how could a good God let this happen how could a good father let it that happen I say in all of it you're a good God you give and you take blessed be the name of the Lord father we accept our lot in life the path that you've taken us Lord even realizing there's some that might stand is grown men who looked back and had fathers who did not love them like you loved who did not care for them like you cared even some who may have been abandoned by their fathers and we realized yet through it all your love has been made known to us and your care has meant more to us than that of an earthly father and Lord as we stand here today offering Thanksgiving and praise to you for the love that you have for us the expression of fatherhood and care that's given to us by you we as men humble ourselves before you we desire to be the right kind of Father's Lord I might even speak for even my brother Mark who stands here Lord one day I know desiring to be a father to be married and have a shoujo but Lord may he also now recognize the great calling as a son what a great blessing he has in his father Lord he spoken highly of his his natural dad to me before Lord made this give him a greater respect for father his own father Lord made give him even a better understanding of how he can conduct himself as a son Lord for each one of us we yield ourselves to you as your children we reverence you as our father we heap our praise and our voice and our adoration upon you as a loving God and again father we humble ourselves before he was men desired to be the right kind of fathers for our children for brother John Lord is the pastor of this church Lord as he has always had taking great care to praise his children and to encourage them Lord I've learned so much from as a son-in-law now even his words towards his children are always affirming and encouraging lord I pray that you bless him for his labors in this church to always encourage them in the right things discourage them in the wrong things and Lord as we have said happy Father's Day to these men I pray that you bless them and bless them abundantly we commit them to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a man with a grateful heart give face to the Holy One give thanks because he's given Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I bow down before you Heavenly Father I appreciate hey let's just lift our hands a second Oh Heavenly Father just worship them oh how we appreciate you Lord Jesus [Music] I bow down before you Heavenly Father I appreciate Holy Spirit your comfort to me Holy Spirit you're a comfort to me Holy Spirit or a comfort [Music] guide me your dwelling inside me Holy Spirit door a comfort to singing in holy spear what a comfort o Holy Spirit Holy Spirit [Music] you guide me you're dwelling inside me Holy Spirit you're a comfort to sing Heavenly Father again Oh Heavenly Father [Music] before Heavenly Father I appreciate you a man his name is higher higher name his name is Jesus his name is Jesus his name is higher amen father his name is Jesus his name is more his name is higher vain any other his name is Jesus his name is Jesus his name is higher than any other his name is Jesus his name is low oh hey Ben he's worthy to be lifted up he's worthy to be praised amen let's sing I've got a revelation Amen we know where we came from we know our fathers they met I've got a revelation of predestination I've gotta read elation God has got father go where I came from tells me where I'm going and can never prevail again I've got a revelation of predestination I've got around relation God is my father I know where I came from tells me where I'm going and the gates of Hell can never prevail again did hey man praise the Lord how many appreciated the word tonight today this morning you know I believe for every one of us there was something some instructions in there even just one on one brother and brother and and of course mothers and children anything about teaching anything about helping amen and I'll say like this it starts with the spirit you know people can read your spirit and there's times that you know we could be spiritually odd out of sync and not catch it but it starts with the spirit usually if the spirits there the words if the words don't make it the spirit will but we wouldn't want to have a relationship with the width of Heavenly Father never say I love you you want you want to say those words and you wanna express them amen I appreciated that message today and we needed that message today wanting you know there are so many things that we could talk about because I begin to study about the Father's Day message before I knew you know Aaron was coming and and what a great attribute to talk about to me about so many that we could happen just talking about the attribute of affirming to your children your love for them your ear ear not just your proud of them often I say that but but that you you think the best of them you you know just want the best of them you think the best of them and it was just yesterday and Jonathan had come over it just a thought it came over over me about him and just instant I began to cry and I had to turn night he was around he was he wasn't there in the same room but it just came and you know you just got love in your heart for your children the father has loved and his heart for his children and you know we we do need to create that atmosphere we have to we have to we have to we can't expect God to always come and a bunch of when his children are all droopy and sad remember when he came to those that were walking too amazed he says why are you so sad walking the way you are you know we've got to create that atmosphere where he desires to dwell in so that that that healthiness of a family can function right right if there's a child in the in the in the home acting depressed well you got to help them out of that and you got to get the atmosphere for going so I just think this is a wonderful message it gives us so much to work on amen and to build our families and our families what we are in our homes we common were a conglomeration of here and so the more we work at home the more our church can be stronger and we can help one another and you know and watched one another's feet amen I did want to say what a great blessing it has to have brother Jason back with us amen did hear much through the service but such a blessing to have you here brother god bless you and as brother aaron was praying before the service of god's protection upon us all we have to trust the lord amen we have to trust the Lord and keep trust in the Lord and keep being why as wise as we can with with one another but that's just so good to see our brother here today amen amen it's all hearts clear amen well that's a good one thank you that's a good one I just want to say for the bond my heart happy Father's Day to each of you may God bless your day today and when you're not thinking about your father and the father that you are to your children may your thoughts be upon our heavenly father well how good he's been to us God is God is so good before we dis we're gonna have our brother mark come out and say a couple of words out I'm gonna have you be seated just a second amen but listen before he comes on it's just seeing that little course God is so good amen god is so good god is so good god is so good he's so good to me God answers prayer [Music] God answers prayer he's so good - we kind of adopted this right here and you know I I can't say enough you just hang on a second I can't say enough about brother Aaron I am so fortunate to have him in the family and he loves the Lord he loves the Lord and he's we just appreciate him he's a great husband a great father a great son-in-law he's a great friend and I love him and I can't say enough about him how it brings me to brother mark he's not the knucklehead of the family i esteem him very highly I treat him like he's my equal but a so much spend time trying to build my brother because I love him he's been such a blessing to our family such a blessing just helping us we just Harley can't keep up but he has helped us he's cared about us and we appreciate you brother and put this little presentation together and I just want to read for you guys how truly much we appreciate all your father's in the church and on your mother's and we're like fathers as well and just thank you for all you do we're truly blessed and you know words can't even describe how blessed we are and I start with Psalms 127 3 through 5 low children are inherited of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man soar the children of the youth happy is the man to have his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed then we'll jump to Genesis 18:19 for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment and then proverbs 22:6 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it proverbs 27 the just man walketh in his integrity and his children are blessed after him proverbs 4 1 here you children the instruction of a father and attend to no understanding not read a quote from brother branham I think that's a very fine example for parents today it's an example before our children now you'll live your best and your worst at home and I think that our lives though the children might not exactly just act like they're noticing it but they are noticing it don't you ever think that they're not because they're watching not only the children are watching but the neighbors are watching none of the neighbors are watching but all that you're associated with watching the people at your church watching the people that you do business with in the markets they are watching you after your confession we should always try to reflect Christ and everything that we do that's from 1960 301 1 to influence thank you all for your father's for your impact on your children's lives we appreciate your guided leadership and all the effort of me through the years to take care of us and provide for us thank you for praying for your children and for shining the light even though this even though this dark age that we live in we often said that anyone could be a father but it takes someone special to be a dad and even beyond that to be a godly dad and hold a Christian standard in a lost and dying world choosing to live a Christian life before your children will be the greatest thing you could ever do for them so thank you for the bottom of my heart for being godly men and raising your families of pattern and gallery influence and I'm just thankful for all your father's even when I was out in the world you got still praying for me and still trying to draw me in you know I'd like to say that I'm very thankful and wasn't for your prayers I would not be here today as the man that I am and I have so much more growing to do and I'm so far from where I have to be but I'm thankful that His grace is keeping all of us and this one's been happy Father's Day to all your dad's and I hope you enjoy the day and not just today but every day your honor as a father by your children and in just God bless you guys so much he meant well that Stan will be dismissed yes announcement correct him am I saying that are you seeing it okay sister Ann had put together some gifts for all the fathers and it'll be in in the back that you could all go back there for just a moment receive I think a gift of Thanksgiving and just when you're wearing it just just appreciate that you're appreciated by the church amen and by our family and by sister Ann she's she appreciates each and every one of you amen god bless you it's been dismissed in a word of Prayer we're gonna ask our brother Jason if he would to dismiss us amen praise God or Jesus keep me true eat me true Lord Jesus keep me true there's a race to be run there are victories to be won give me power every hour keep
