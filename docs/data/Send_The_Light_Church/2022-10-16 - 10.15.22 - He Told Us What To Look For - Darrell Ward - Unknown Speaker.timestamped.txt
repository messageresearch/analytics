[38:41] shalt see the spirit descending and
[38:43] remaining on him the same is he which

[39:38] has always gave instructions to his
[39:40] people so that they would not error in
[39:43] the way that they should go
[39:46] Paul told us in first Thessalonians 4 13
[39:48] He said but I would not have you to be
[39:51] ignorant Brethren concerning them which
[39:53] are asleep that you sorrow not and even
[39:55] as others who have no hope so you see
[39:58] God don't want us to be ignorant
[40:00] he doesn't want us to be ignorant and
[40:02] he's always rich in his Mercy to show us
[40:05] and to instruct Us in the way that we
[40:08] should go that we would not error in
[40:10] that way and we find in Luke Chapter 2
[40:12] that he sent an angel to the Shepherds
[40:14] who was watching over their flocks by
[40:16] night and the and lo the Bible says that
[40:19] Lo the angel of the Lord came unto them
[40:20] in the glory of the Lord sown around
[40:22] about them and they were so afraid and
[40:25] the angel said unto them fear not for
[40:27] behold I bring unto you good tidings of
[40:29] great joy which shall be to all people
[40:31] for unto you born this day in the city
[40:33] of David is the savior cry which is
[40:36] Christ the lord and it shall be a sign
[40:39] unto you that ye shall find the Babe
[40:41] wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a
[40:44] manger and the Bible says it came to
[40:46] pass as the Angels were going away from
[40:48] them into heaven that the shepherd said
[40:50] one to another let us now go even unto
[40:53] Bethlehem and see this thing which is to
[40:56] come to pass which the Lord hath made
[40:59] known unto us
[41:01] now notice they didn't go to the king's
[41:03] Palace
[41:04] they didn't go to the high dollar ends
[41:06] they they didn't go to the Ritz Carlton
[41:09] or to some Resort or that's that's
[41:11] reserved for the elite why didn't they
[41:12] go there because they knew he wasn't
[41:15] there
[41:16] but the Bible said they came with haste
[41:19] and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe
[41:21] lying in a manger and when they had seen
[41:24] it it made known abroad saying which was
[41:25] told unto them concerning this child and
[41:28] I can just see Mary saying you know as
[41:30] they were there and all of a sudden
[41:31] these Shepherds showed up to give praise
[41:33] unto the newborn Savior and and I could
[41:36] just see Mary saying how how did you
[41:38] know we were here
[41:39] how did how did you find us and they
[41:42] might have said to Mary he the angel
[41:45] told us what to look for
[41:48] it oh Hallelujah you want to find Jesus
[41:50] in your day look to where the angel
[41:52] messenger says he is we've had an angel
[41:55] Messenger to tell us where he's at in
[41:58] the hour that we're living in amen the
[42:00] prophet said that's where the church
[42:01] will find him you'll never find him in
[42:03] the denomination he's not there you'll
[42:05] never find him it's some kind of
[42:07] educational program he's not there but
[42:09] you'll find him in the baptism of the
[42:12] Holy Ghost that's the only place you'll
[42:14] find him so let's not look for where
[42:16] he's not but let's look to where he is
[42:18] amen Hallelujah he sent prophets with
[42:22] Eagle Vision who could raise up and they
[42:24] would see uh be able to see afar off and
[42:27] begin to cry out to the things that was
[42:29] going to come to pass and give people
[42:31] insight to the things which are to be
[42:34] and what to look for and I think as I
[42:37] think about that of the prophets of God
[42:38] of the mighty prophet Isaiah who was
[42:42] caught up in the spirit and he began to
[42:44] cry out the voice of him the crieth in
[42:47] the wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[42:49] Lord make strength in the desert a
[42:51] highway for our God
[42:53] and
[42:55] 712 years later
[42:59] oh my you're talking about being able to
[43:01] see a far off
[43:04] 712 years later the Pharisees came from
[43:07] Jerusalem into the desert asking John
[43:11] who are you and the Bible said this is
[43:14] the record of John when the Jews sent
[43:16] the priests and the Levites from
[43:18] Jerusalem asking who art thou and he
[43:20] confessed and denied not for confess I
[43:22] am not the Christ
[43:24] and they ask him what the north Dal
[43:26] Elias he saith I am not art thou that
[43:28] prophet and he answered no and they said
[43:31] unto him who art thou that we may give
[43:33] an answer to them that sent us what
[43:35] saith thou and thyself
[43:38] Hallelujah and he said I am the voice of
[43:41] one crying in the wilderness made
[43:43] straight the way of the Lord I saith the
[43:46] prophet Isaiah what was he saying I am
[43:49] Isaiah's prophecy fulfilled this day
[43:52] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[43:55] Hallelujah God told them what to look
[43:57] for he was the very Vindication of
[44:00] Isaiah's prophecy his teaching his
[44:02] nature his character they even came from
[44:05] Jerusalem to the Wilderness to see him
[44:07] just like the prophet said they would
[44:09] the very words of the Prophet was made
[44:12] flesh and was standing right before them
[44:15] how could they have missed it when he
[44:18] told him what to look for
[44:21] Jesus told them ye Hypocrites you blind
[44:24] leaders of the blood I sent you prophets
[44:27] I told you what to look for through them
[44:30] and what did you do you stoned them
[44:33] for Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that
[44:36] killeth the prophets had stoned them
[44:37] which are sent unto thee how off I would
[44:40] have gathered thy children together even
[44:42] as a hen gathereth her ticks under her
[44:45] wings and ye would not woe unto your
[44:49] scribes and you Pharisees Stephen told
[44:51] them that day in Acts 7 52 which of the
[44:55] prophets have not your fathers
[44:56] persecuted have they slain them which
[44:58] sowed before of the coming of the just
[45:01] one of whom you have now been betrayers
[45:03] and murderers Stephen said he sent you
[45:06] prophets to tell you what to look for
[45:07] but for the just one comes but what did
[45:11] you do you persecuted and stoned them
[45:13] and now have betrayed and killed the
[45:15] very one they said would come amen
[45:19] and they're doing the same thing today
[45:23] they were Blinded By The Creeks have
[45:26] their self-righteousness and there's
[45:28] religion and the pride of life
[45:31] I can just see them that day in
[45:32] Jerusalem when the prophecy of of
[45:35] Zechariah was being fulfilled I could
[45:38] just see him in my mind sitting around
[45:39] the table maybe finishing lunch and the
[45:42] the man might have said honey let's read
[45:44] from the scroll of Zechariah and they
[45:46] pull out the scroll of Zechariah and
[45:48] says Zechariah says Rejoice greatly hold
[45:51] thy Daughter of Zion Rejoice so taller
[45:54] in Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto
[45:57] thee he is just and have his salvation
[45:59] lowly and riding upon the ass and upon
[46:02] the coat and the fall of the nest and as
[46:04] they was reading from The Scroll of
[46:06] Zechariah
[46:07] oh my I can just see him in my mind
[46:10] after finished reading they hear a noise
[46:12] and looking up over the scroll they see
[46:15] him come riding into the city on the
[46:18] door
[46:20] and no doubt he said to his wife who is
[46:23] this
[46:25] who is this
[46:26] the Bible said when he come into
[46:28] Jerusalem all the city was moved saying
[46:30] who is this
[46:33] Zechariah told him exactly what to look
[46:36] for but when he came into the city they
[46:38] missed it
[46:41] oh the city may not have known
[46:45] there who caught the Revelation for he
[46:47] told them what to look for the prophecy
[46:50] of Zechariah had become flesh and the
[46:53] Bible says in Matthew 21 11 and the
[46:55] multitude said this is Jesus the prophet
[46:58] of Nazareth of Galilee
[47:02] oh the city of Faith may not know the
[47:04] city of Detroit may not know the city of
[47:07] Ann Arbor may not know but there are
[47:09] people standing here tonight that know
[47:11] the prophecy of the
[47:14] Hallelujah the prophecy of the prophets
[47:17] become flesh
[47:19] and by revelation we can say this is
[47:22] Jesus
[47:24] in broad form
[47:28] well Gloria
[47:31] he told us what to look for
[47:34] don't miss it as they have done
[47:37] he come exactly the way the word said he
[47:39] would come but through the Creeds and
[47:42] their ideals they missed him for they
[47:44] were looking for something else
[47:47] the woman at the world knew what to look
[47:49] for
[47:49] right she was troubled in her mind her
[47:51] life was a mess she longed for something
[47:53] she had five husbands and the one she
[47:56] was living with now the man she's living
[47:57] with now was not her husband and at the
[47:59] well that day she didn't notice him at
[48:01] first
[48:02] setting with us back to the wall and she
[48:04] heard someone say give me a drink
[48:07] and she says not customary you're a Jew
[48:10] I'm a Samaritan that you said ask me
[48:13] to give you a drink
[48:15] and Jesus said if you knew who I was
[48:19] you'd ask me for a drink
[48:21] and the conversation went on
[48:23] and he said to her he called her spirit
[48:25] he found where her trouble was
[48:27] he said go get your husband
[48:29] she said I have none
[48:32] Jesus said now that's well said for
[48:35] you've had five
[48:36] and the one you're with now is not your
[48:38] husband
[48:39] and what did she say what was the next
[48:42] thing out of her mouth she said I
[48:44] perceive that you are a prophet
[48:48] I know when the Messiah which is called
[48:51] Christ when he comes he will tell us
[48:53] these things she knew what to look for
[48:57] or when she walked up to the well it was
[48:59] just a man she identified as a Jew but
[49:02] when the Messiah sign was manifested she
[49:05] knew what to look for in the Middle East
[49:06] she said this is the messiah
[49:10] or Hallelujah we know when he comes we
[49:13] know when he comes he will tell us all
[49:16] things and Jesus said unto her eye
[49:18] that's speaking to them he and she
[49:20] dropped her water pots and ran into the
[49:22] City and said come see a man who told me
[49:25] everything that I ever done he didn't
[49:28] tell her everything he just told her one
[49:30] thing but she knew if he knew that he
[49:33] knew all things amen
[49:35] oh Hallelujah
[49:37] Hallelujah
[49:38] she saw it she knew what to look for and
[49:42] when she saw it she knew it was him he
[49:46] had a scriptural identification
[49:51] are you with me tonight

[49:57] said unto him
[49:58] John you say to messiah's alive today

[50:03] earth somewhere I don't know where I
[50:06] don't know where he is but I'll know him
[50:08] when he comes how do you know you'll
[50:10] know him John God told me what to look
[50:14] for

[50:17] they said oh look at this fella coming
[50:19] right here he's got a crown on his hand
[50:21] that must be the Messiah driving those
[50:22] horses and John said that's not him and
[50:25] he walked right up to him and said it's
[50:27] not lawful for you to have your
[50:29] brother's wife amen
[50:31] the prophet of God said it made herod's
[50:33] wife so mad she hated him as long as she
[50:35] lived and John kept looking he said oh

[50:38] comes how do you know John how do you
[50:40] know you'll know him

[55:52] that was a promise of a victory
[55:56] they gave me stuff to fight with but
[55:58] they never gave me a promise of victory
[56:02] but when I came into God's Army
[56:05] he gave me a helmet of salvation a
[56:08] breastplate of righteousness he shot my
[56:10] feet with the preparation of the gospel
[56:12] and placed the sword of the word in my
[56:14] hand and you know what else God gave me

[59:41] for I know what's coming next

[59:45] the hearts and said unto Peter and to
[59:46] the rest of the Apostles men and
[59:47] Brethren what must we do to be saved and
[59:50] Peter said unto them repent be baptized
[59:53] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[59:55] Christ for the remission of your sins

[59:59] not maybe but you shall receive the gift
[1:00:02] of the Holy Ghost for the promise it's

[1:00:45] times
[1:00:46] out of a hundred those are still pretty
[1:00:49] good odds 99 times out of 100 I bet
[1:00:51] Vegas would like to have those kind of
[1:00:53] odds
[1:00:54] but God's not even 99 times out of a
[1:00:56] hundred but the prophet of God said he
[1:00:58] keeps his word 100 times out of the
[1:01:01] hundred
[1:01:03] Hallelujah God keeps his word

[1:01:19] the end time signs he told us what to
[1:01:23] look for that we would know what hour

[1:01:33] know these were not my words they're his
[1:01:35] words we see the great end times signs
[1:01:38] on the Earth today we know that's right
[1:01:39] now look I've waited for this a long
[1:01:42] long time for the message to you see and
[1:01:46] you've seen the end time signs and I've
[1:01:48] preached it to you and showed it to you
[1:01:50] by everything that Christ said is that
[1:01:53] right congregation says amen you'll
[1:01:55] admit that the congregation says amen we
[1:01:57] are at the end time I don't see nothing
[1:02:01] left

[1:02:26] the King of the North the third Vision
[1:02:28] was in the realm of the world politics
[1:02:30] for it showed me that there would be
[1:02:32] three great isms fascism Nazism and
[1:02:37] communism but the first two would be

[1:03:03] December the 25th I think it was 1991.
[1:03:09] the USSR became Russia but the voice
[1:03:12] that spoke to the prophet said this
[1:03:15] would be swallowed up into a third ISM
[1:03:17] communism and the voice admonished me
[1:03:20] watch Russia watch Russia who's in the
[1:03:24] news right now Russia

[1:05:28] we've had a great sign to happen here in
[1:05:30] Chicago a few days ago Jesus said in the
[1:05:32] last days the waves would be roaring
[1:05:34] perplexed of time distress between
[1:05:36] nations
[1:05:39] what was it speaking of these tidal
[1:05:41] waves never been known in all the
[1:05:42] history of the world ever tidal waste
[1:05:44] ever broke through like that until the
[1:05:46] last days a tidal wave which was
[1:05:48] prophesied right from this platform
[1:05:51] struck Chicago right here and watched
[1:05:54] the people killed up and down the banks
[1:05:55] of Chicago Science can't even figure it
[1:05:57] out said it was some wind must have come
[1:06:00] the place that how in the world could a
[1:06:02] wind coming down like that
[1:06:05] but friends Chicago is 800 miles from
[1:06:09] the nearest ocean
[1:06:11] How could a tidal wave strike Chicago
[1:06:16] because it wasn't from the ocean
[1:06:19] it was never from the ocean the great
[1:06:21] tidal wave that struck Chicago and
[1:06:24] washed the people off the beaches of
[1:06:26] Chicago didn't come from the ocean
[1:06:29] it came from Lake Michigan I think it is
[1:06:32] huh
[1:06:34] June the 26 1954 a wall of water eight
[1:06:38] foot tall 25 miles wide struck the
[1:06:42] inside entire Chicago Lakefront sweeping
[1:06:46] fishermen away killing eight some said

[1:06:55] water prophesied from the pulpit that it
[1:06:58] would happen a sign of the end time he
[1:07:01] told us what to look for
[1:07:03] but it didn't stop in 1954.
[1:07:06] September the 23rd 2017 an 18-foot wave
[1:07:10] off of Lake Michigan struck Chicago
[1:07:12] October the 24th 2017 a 29 foot wave
[1:07:20] they say it's from the winds they say
[1:07:23] it's from the winds they explain it away
[1:07:25] how could these things happen it's the
[1:07:28] finger of almighty God moving to Chicago
[1:07:32] telling you
[1:07:34] that the end time is at hand and to flee
[1:07:36] the Wrath that is to come they say it's

[1:08:02] signs in the heavens above and the earth
[1:08:04] below fillers of fire and Vapors of
[1:08:07] smoke and it shall come to pass before
[1:08:10] the great and terrible day of the Lord
[1:08:12] shall come he spoke all these things
[1:08:14] sees the Roaring tidal waves breaking
[1:08:16] everything man's Hearts failing for fear
[1:08:21] the greatest time of heart trouble we've
[1:08:23] ever had
[1:08:24] fear perplexed of time distress between

[1:08:30] Horseless carriages here that race in

[1:09:53] prophet said when that little Remnant
[1:09:55] goes to calling out to God what's what
[1:09:58] happens
[1:10:00] he told us what to look for it's all
[1:10:04] laying in the message that we just leave
[1:10:06] laying around
[1:10:09] there'll be a national Showdown there'll
[1:10:12] be a power that's never been seen before
[1:10:15] the trouble of it is it's going to be
[1:10:17] too late for them then the doors will be
[1:10:19] closed so remember we're at the end time
[1:10:21] see pray the world don't know what it is
[1:10:24] the world don't know what it is but you

[1:10:37] what is it what is it investigating
[1:10:40] judgment annual Angels one of these UFOs
[1:10:43] what is it we know it's investigating
[1:10:46] judgment Angels you see how at the

[1:11:07] but you do
[1:11:09] we know
[1:11:11] he told us
[1:11:12] what to look for
[1:11:14] huh I pulled this out of the news in a
[1:11:17] rare public U.S Congress hearing help
[1:11:20] for the first time in 50 years a top
[1:11:24] defense official talked low-toed
[1:11:26] lawmakers that an increasing number of
[1:11:29] UFOs have been reported in the sky over
[1:11:34] the past 20 years
[1:11:39] since the early 2000s we have seen an
[1:11:42] increasing number of unauthorized or
[1:11:45] unidentified aircraft or objects in
[1:11:50] military controlled training areas and
[1:11:52] training ranges and other designated
[1:11:55] airspaces
[1:11:57] since 2000 we have seen an increase of
[1:12:01] unidentified
[1:12:03] objects
[1:12:05] but we know
[1:12:08] he told us what to look for
[1:12:11] blackouts
[1:12:14] blackouts isn't it strange that not long
[1:12:16] ago the prophet said that the East Coast
[1:12:18] the big blackout they couldn't
[1:12:19] understand it Texas blacked out last
[1:12:21] week they can't understand it don't you
[1:12:23] realize that's a sign
[1:12:25] don't you know the nations are breaking
[1:12:27] this was in their Homeland these signs
[1:12:29] are indicating that we're at the end
[1:12:31] the same time it's blacking out don't
[1:12:34] you know that's a sign that the prophet
[1:12:36] said
[1:12:37] that there shall be light at the evening
[1:12:39] time there should be light come forth in
[1:12:40] the evening time when the blackouts and
[1:12:43] the things are going the way they are
[1:12:44] now
[1:12:45] look at it just how I blacked out the
[1:12:47] pope just came over remember the
[1:12:48] Tabernacle when you got the tapes I
[1:12:50] guess all of you take them how that the
[1:12:52] Lord showed there that day in the
[1:12:53] Tabernacle exactly where those churches
[1:12:54] would be and how they would be and I had
[1:12:56] them drawn out on the Blackboard up
[1:12:58] there and them Church Ages which you see
[1:12:59] here drawn out in a book and if the Holy
[1:13:01] Spirit didn't come down in a big Pillar
[1:13:03] of Fire it went to the back wall back
[1:13:05] there and drawed them out himself
[1:13:07] with three or four hundred people
[1:13:09] sitting there looking at it and just as
[1:13:11] the pope started over here the moon
[1:13:12] somehow blacked out and they took
[1:13:14] pictures the same way that it was and
[1:13:16] drawn up here on the platform they took
[1:13:18] the same pictures of the moon and the
[1:13:20] moon types of church
[1:13:22] now he's made the trip over here on the
[1:13:23] 13th walk 13 steps served communion to
[1:13:26] the 13th to a nation that's number 13
[1:13:29] and blackouts coming everywhere don't
[1:13:32] you see where we're at we're at the end
[1:13:34] times scoffers rise in the last day
[1:13:36] saying there's no difference in the time
[1:13:37] than it was then when our fathers fell
[1:13:39] asleep but when you see these things
[1:13:42] begin to happen raise up your head get
[1:13:45] ready something could happen at any time

[1:16:53] foreign
[1:16:54] he told us
[1:16:56] what to look for
[1:16:58] now me and brother John was eating lunch
[1:16:59] earlier today and I showed him a picture
[1:17:01] on my phone of a son
[1:17:04] is that right brother and I said brother
[1:17:06] John is that a sunset or a sunrise
[1:17:12] well he guessed it but he said I don't
[1:17:14] really know but I'm going to say it's a
[1:17:15] sunrise I said well you're right but I
[1:17:17] said you see you can ask 10 people
[1:17:20] and you'll get an answer from different
[1:17:22] people some will say it's a sunrise some
[1:17:24] will say it's a sunset it's most people
[1:17:25] that's honest will say I don't know or
[1:17:27] at least they'll guess
[1:17:32] now you guys are quiet
[1:17:35] I'm used to the South you know
[1:17:40] that's true friends is that not true you
[1:17:43] see a picture of a son if you don't know
[1:17:45] what direction the guy was standing in
[1:17:46] when he took the picture you really
[1:17:47] don't know if it's a sunrise or a sunset
[1:17:49] why it's the same Sun
[1:17:55] amen you take a picture of a son you
[1:17:57] show it to 10 different people someone
[1:17:58] say it's a sunrise some will say it's a
[1:18:00] sunset why you can't tell it apart
[1:18:03] but the same s-u-n
[1:18:06] gives the same issue in light and the
[1:18:09] same s-o-n gives the same son light
[1:18:13] so the same
[1:18:15] the same su-n that rises in the morning
[1:18:18] and gives its life is the same s-u-n
[1:18:21] that sets in the evening time and gives
[1:18:23] the same light not another light the
[1:18:27] same light
[1:18:28] and you can't tell the difference
[1:18:30] between the two
[1:18:31] why can't you tell the difference
[1:18:33] between the two because it's the same
[1:18:38] the same suing gives the same Su in life
[1:18:41] and the same son gives the same son
[1:18:43] light now the same son it would give the
[1:18:47] same light God promised I will restore
[1:18:50] saith the Lord all the years I'll send
[1:18:52] back another church in the last days and
[1:18:55] I will restore the original Power again
[1:18:57] in the evening time it shall be light
[1:19:00] what is the light it's not the s-u-n
[1:19:03] it's the so in
[1:19:07] down in the heart
[1:19:10] I promise it down in the heart of that
[1:19:11] tree no matter how many branches just
[1:19:13] pruned thy will come forth the Royal
[1:19:15] Seed of Abraham God promised it God will
[1:19:18] do it he said he would do it it shall be
[1:19:22] light again about the evening time the
[1:19:25] s-o-n will peep out again
[1:19:30] it shall be light the same s-o-n the
[1:19:34] same s-o-n that was revealed in flesh at
[1:19:37] the morning time back there will be
[1:19:40] revealed again in the evening time
[1:19:43] the same way the son appearing in the
[1:19:47] morning in flesh is the same son
[1:19:50] appearing in the evening time in flesh
[1:19:53] the morning son appeared in the flesh of
[1:19:55] the groom the evening son appears in the
[1:19:59] flesh of the Bride
[1:20:03] he's just
[1:20:06] he's just
[1:20:09] he's just
[1:20:10] changed his mask
[1:20:13] y'all know about wearing masks don't you
[1:20:16] we wore them for two years about drove
[1:20:18] us crazy didn't we
[1:20:20] I was telling brother John I was over
[1:20:21] the store and I stopped in to get some
[1:20:23] gas I was going somewhere to preach and
[1:20:24] I went in and I was standing there by
[1:20:26] the Tater chip wreck
[1:20:28] and this guy comes walking in he must
[1:20:29] have been a local everybody there was
[1:20:31] mass going to come walking in with a
[1:20:32] mask on the cashier you know she she
[1:20:34] goes
[1:20:35] she goes why John you've changed your
[1:20:37] mask
[1:20:39] when she said that it was like a boat of
[1:20:41] electricity went through me how about
[1:20:42] shaded shouted past the Tater chips
[1:20:47] because I realized MTC that's all he
[1:20:49] done sister sister that's all he done
[1:20:52] took God was veiled in a mass called
[1:20:55] Jesus and in the evening time the same
[1:20:57] anointing that was upon the same
[1:21:00] anointing that was about Jesus it's now
[1:21:02] upon his brand it's just changed his
[1:21:04] mask but we know it's him how do we know
[1:21:07] it's him he told us what to look for
[1:21:17] in the days as it was in the days of I
[1:21:19] know I'm reading a lot but I want you to
[1:21:21] know this is what he said
[1:21:22] in the days it wasn't the days I saw
[1:21:24] them the set into the world in the time
[1:21:26] that the son of man is being revealed
[1:21:28] the sorry the very same gospel that was
[1:21:31] preached on the day of Pentecost the
[1:21:33] very signs that followed for 30 some odd
[1:21:35] years after that down in the church has
[1:21:37] returned back to the church again
[1:21:39] falling right down to the end
[1:21:42] when did Rebecca find Isaac
[1:21:45] in the evening time
[1:21:47] called her to be the bride he called her
[1:21:49] to be the bride in the evening time it
[1:21:52] shall be light in the evening time the
[1:21:54] way of Glory he shall surely find in the
[1:21:57] Waterway is the light today buried in
[1:21:59] the precious name of Jesus young and old
[1:22:02] repent of all your sins and the Holy
[1:22:04] Ghost shall surely enter in the evening
[1:22:06] lights have come it is a fact that God
[1:22:10] and Christ
[1:22:12] our war
[1:22:15] the harmony
[1:22:16] think about this I've been studying on
[1:22:18] the message the harmony between the God
[1:22:20] God and the son the father and the son
[1:22:23] the harmony between the father and the
[1:22:25] son and the bride and the groom
[1:22:29] the harmony of the father and the son
[1:22:31] Jesus never did anything that was first
[1:22:33] showed him by the Father John 5 19. this
[1:22:35] harmony this harmony that was between
[1:22:37] the father and the son
[1:22:40] now exist between the groom that's right
[1:22:43] and his bride he shows her his Word of
[1:22:46] Life
[1:22:47] she receives it she never doubts it
[1:22:50] therefore nothing
[1:22:53] can harm her not even death
[1:22:57] for if the seed be planted the water
[1:22:59] will raise it up again here is the
[1:23:01] secret of this the word is in the bride
[1:23:04] as it was in Mary the bride has the mind
[1:23:07] of Christ for for she knows what he
[1:23:10] wants done with the word she performs
[1:23:12] the command of the word in his name for
[1:23:15] she has thus saith the Lord
[1:23:18] well brother Daryl I thought only a
[1:23:20] prophet had thus saith the Lord
[1:23:25] well I'm sorry
[1:23:26] I'm sorry you didn't know that the bride
[1:23:28] has it too
[1:23:30] the son of man Ministry in the bride
[1:23:33] oh God help us Lord the bride has the
[1:23:36] mind to Christ she knows what he wants
[1:23:37] done with the word she performs the
[1:23:39] command of the word in his name for she
[1:23:41] has thus saith the Lord
[1:23:43] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:23:45] and it comes to pass like a seed that is
[1:23:47] planted in water it comes to full
[1:23:49] Harvest serving its purpose that was the
[1:23:52] beginning of it and now she stayed right
[1:23:54] on into the bride light
[1:23:58] the bride light the evening light has
[1:24:02] come the broad light
[1:24:06] the son that peeped out in the morning
[1:24:08] is now peeping out in the evening time

[1:24:14] God hallelujah these signs shall follow
[1:24:16] them thou not belong to the Methodist of
[1:24:18] the Baptist or to the Pentecostals but

[1:24:29] to come one Hallelujah there has to come
[1:24:32] a real bride there must come one that's
[1:24:34] not only got the mechanics but the
[1:24:36] Dynamics to make the church live and
[1:24:39] move in the power of his resurrection
[1:24:42] or do you love him

[1:24:48] oh my
[1:24:50] oh my let me just skip some of this I

[1:24:53] when God came to Adam his bride for his
[1:24:55] side he said she's fleshing my flesh and
[1:24:57] bone in my bone is that right when God
[1:24:58] give Christ his bride the spirit gave
[1:25:01] the Flesh and the bride was was piercing

[1:31:43] be earthquakes
[1:31:44] in many different places it's a sound

[1:31:51] with divers which is different places
[1:31:54] many different earthquakes big
[1:31:56] earthquakes and great volcanoes will
[1:31:59] take place

[1:34:09] just going from memory 60
[1:34:12] 62 000 I think it is earthquakes
[1:34:17] but my Lord if it's 10 that's a lot
[1:34:21] he said what are you saying I'm trying
[1:34:22] to say this friends he told us what to
[1:34:24] look for and it's not something that's
[1:34:26] coming it's here
[1:34:28] and I was looking at this you know what
[1:34:30] they're saying I said it's a myth that
[1:34:32] California will fall into the ocean
[1:34:37] really
[1:34:40] they said it's a myth that the Earth
[1:34:42] would open up and swallow people
[1:34:44] really
[1:34:45] did not the bible say that that happened
[1:34:49] they don't even know what they're
[1:34:50] talking about
[1:34:51] that's right but you know
[1:34:53] he told us what to look for
[1:34:55] amen it's not something that's coming
[1:34:57] friends it's something that's here his
[1:35:00] bride with the authority of the word
[1:35:03] when Jesus came give me just a few more
[1:35:04] minutes when Jesus came to the coast of
[1:35:07] caesarea he Philippa he asked the
[1:35:09] disciples said whom do this whom do they
[1:35:11] say I the son of man am some said they
[1:35:14] are John the Baptist or some said you're
[1:35:15] alive so Jeremiah or one of the prophets
[1:35:18] some say you're this and some say you're
[1:35:20] that and he said unto him let whom say
[1:35:22] ye that I am you see friends it's got to
[1:35:25] be a personal revelation
[1:35:28] you've got to know him for yourself and
[1:35:31] Simon Peter actually said Thou Art the
[1:35:33] Christ the son of the Living God and he
[1:35:35] said blessed art thou Simon about Jonah
[1:35:36] for flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:35:37] this unto thee but my Father which is in
[1:35:39] heaven and I say unto thee that thou art
[1:35:41] Peter
[1:35:43] and Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[1:35:44] and the gates of hell should not Prevail
[1:35:46] against it that word Prevail means to be
[1:35:48] superior in strength and I will give
[1:35:51] unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of
[1:35:53] Heaven and whatsoever thou shall bind on
[1:35:55] the Earth shall be bound in heaven and
[1:35:56] whatsoever thou shall loose on the Earth
[1:35:58] shall be loosed in heaven
[1:36:00] he gave Peter the keys to the kingdom
[1:36:04] with the power to bond and loose by the
[1:36:07] keys is that right now we know friends
[1:36:10] that the key it wasn't a brass key that
[1:36:11] he had cut at Walmart
[1:36:13] it wasn't a literal key that he took off
[1:36:15] his side and handed to Peter but that
[1:36:17] key see the key it represents the sense
[1:36:19] The Keeper of the keys has the power to
[1:36:21] open and shut the word class it's
[1:36:23] figured to be used in the New Testament
[1:36:25] to denote power and authority of various
[1:36:27] kinds the key I'll give you the keys
[1:36:29] what he's actually saying to Peter is I
[1:36:31] give you the power and the authority to
[1:36:34] bind and to loose you see when you're
[1:36:36] holding the key in your hand you have
[1:36:38] the power and the authority to lock
[1:36:41] or unlock
[1:36:42] to open or close because you possess the
[1:36:47] power
[1:36:51] when we left Chattanooga the last thing
[1:36:53] I came back from my daughter was her
[1:36:54] eyesight and she was starting to see
[1:36:56] when we'd leave and I started telling
[1:36:58] the people that that Jessica was
[1:36:59] starting to see again she'd been blinded
[1:37:00] from the accident she struck by the
[1:37:02] train had a severe brain injury left her
[1:37:04] blind and all kinds of problems and all
[1:37:06] of it came back except her eyesight
[1:37:07] she's still blind but I kept telling him
[1:37:09] she'd see again and somebody's doing the
[1:37:10] video you know what I'm talking about
[1:37:12] and so when we went back to when we was
[1:37:14] leaving Chattanooga you know I said I
[1:37:16] told him I said Jessica's starting to
[1:37:17] see and they said well that's nice Mr
[1:37:18] Ward you know we it's just like that's
[1:37:20] just wishful thinking of a father
[1:37:22] so we left and we went home and she
[1:37:24] started seeing real good so we went back
[1:37:26] down for a checkup and when we got off
[1:37:28] the elevator
[1:37:29] because the last thing we talked about
[1:37:31] was her seeing when we got off the
[1:37:32] elevator it was just like family we'd
[1:37:34] been down there for five weeks with her
[1:37:36] there at Chattanooga and when we got off
[1:37:37] the elevator and they said oh it's
[1:37:38] Jessica it's Jessica and they all come
[1:37:40] running around us you know and they said
[1:37:42] can she see can't she see and I took my
[1:37:44] keys and I pitched them out there and I
[1:37:46] said Kai it's a little nickname I gave
[1:37:47] her from she's little I said Kai pick up
[1:37:49] Daddy's keys
[1:37:51] and when she went over and picked up
[1:37:52] them key spreads they were screaming and
[1:37:55] crying they grabbed our necks and shook
[1:37:57] our hands it was the most mobile
[1:38:00] it was so wonderful but see here's the
[1:38:02] thing I want to say to you she went to
[1:38:04] pick up the keys because her daddy said
[1:38:06] she could pick him up and she had the
[1:38:08] means to do it with
[1:38:10] and Jesus gave Peter the keys he told
[1:38:12] Peter pick up the keys Peter
[1:38:15] and Peter had the understanding of what
[1:38:17] the father was saying Jessica picked up
[1:38:19] the keys because she had the revelation
[1:38:20] of what her father was telling her that
[1:38:22] he wanted him to do and Peter picked up
[1:38:25] the keys with the power and the
[1:38:26] authority and in the last days there's
[1:38:27] again the prophet said there's another
[1:38:29] people in the land who under their
[1:38:31] Messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:38:34] final age
[1:38:35] foreign
[1:38:38] voice not The Written Letter not the
[1:38:41] written word a voice
[1:38:43] speak the word when a Son of God by
[1:38:46] faith takes the word of God into his
[1:38:47] heart and speaks it back up on his lips
[1:38:49] it's just the same as deity speaking
[1:38:53] Every Mountain has to go Jesus said if
[1:38:57] ye shall say if ye shall say
[1:39:00] what is it when you're out from under
[1:39:02] Babylon when you're out from under
[1:39:04] unbelief when you're out from under
[1:39:06] Superstition when you're out from under
[1:39:07] all these things and you're filled with
[1:39:10] God's own life your voice is his voice
[1:39:13] you are the prophet said I spoke it
[1:39:16] listen to the authenticated prophet of
[1:39:18] God who appears in this last day what he
[1:39:20] says from God the bride will say the
[1:39:22] spirit and the prophet and the bride
[1:39:24] will be saying the same thing and what
[1:39:26] they will say will have already been
[1:39:28] said in the word and they are saying it
[1:39:32] now
[1:39:35] then I say to you friends with the power
[1:39:37] and the authority given to us as

[1:42:09] and we see it blessed are your eyes for
[1:42:11] they see in your ears for the year

[1:42:19] teaching their kids all kinds of Filth
[1:42:21] and all kinds of nonsense and all kinds
[1:42:23] of insanity we can sit and teach our
[1:42:25] children
[1:42:26] truth of God's word
[1:42:28] with an anointing that will change their
[1:42:30] bodies

[1:42:53] how we thank you Lord Jesus
[1:42:58] hell we thank you Lord God
[1:43:01] Lord that there's been a man among us
[1:43:03] Lord
[1:43:04] who has turned on the light
[1:43:07] oh God
[1:43:10] how our hearts Lord rejoice in knowing
[1:43:13] Lord
[1:43:14] that these things are not just some
[1:43:16] man's ideal
[1:43:18] but it's thus saith the Lord the message
[1:43:21] of the hour
[1:43:22] and father I pray Lord Jesus
[1:43:25] for our loved ones Lord and our children
[1:43:27] God
[1:43:29] oh God May there not be a one left
[1:43:32] behind

[1:43:36] Lord let our lives be so salty that our
[1:43:38] loved ones will long for that
[1:43:41] for Lord as it was in the days of Noah
[1:43:44] he went for the saving of his household
[1:43:46] Lord
[1:43:47] and oh God even so let it be now God
[1:43:49] that our burden would be upon our loved
[1:43:51] ones and our children
[1:43:52] and those God who are outside the
[1:43:55] protection of the umbrella of the Holy
[1:43:58] Spirit

[1:44:05] behind Lord in the sound of my voice
[1:44:06] tonight these things God are not made up
[1:44:09] Lord

[1:44:12] spoke of these blackouts and Lord we see
[1:44:14] these things happening it's all in the
[1:44:16] news right now
[1:44:17] and father rushes in the news right now

[1:44:26] pulled off the news since I've been
[1:44:27] studying this God
[1:44:29] is right here upon us and you told us
[1:44:31] these things

[1:44:36] there would be a light
[1:44:38] oh God the same s-o-n would peek out
[1:44:41] again
[1:44:42] the church with signs and wonders would
[1:44:44] rise in its power
[1:44:46] oh God we believe it's not something
[1:44:48] that's coming but we believe it's here
[1:44:49] Lord and may we water these things with
[1:44:52] our praise dear God may we lay aside
[1:44:54] every way to ever sin God maybe we've
[1:44:56] got caught up in the politics of the
[1:44:58] world or got caught up in all this
[1:45:00] nonsense and we forgot who we are we
[1:45:02] forgot our mission we forgot our purpose
[1:45:04] but oh God made tonight Lord we just cut
[1:45:06] all those things loose

[1:45:10] of God

[1:45:45] and we see them Lord
[1:45:47] and we thank you Father God
[1:45:49] and Lord God may we hear as they was in
[1:45:52] the days of Noah as your Prophet talked
[1:45:54] about those animals it was out there
[1:45:56] grazing on the hillside and it began to
[1:45:57] thunder I said oh papa camel raised up
[1:46:00] his head and said Mama that's what Noah

[1:46:51] soul but into our spirit but when it

[1:46:54] we start acting like them but oh God may
[1:46:57] we not feed off the things of the world
[1:46:58] but may we feed off of this word Lord
[1:47:01] that would be demoted and shaped into
