um a lot of contact but he's a precious brother amen and he's a he's a minister of the gospel and I've been praying Lord just feed me with your word today give me something to to help me get closer to you and serve you better than I have been serving you and I believe that's why we come to church is to receive from the Lord and I I was praying this morning Lord I I I want to I want I don't want to just hear your commandment I want Grace to obey it whatever you would have me to do because that there is the proof that I love him and I already know He Loves Me Right but I I I got to prove with my life that I love him and uh I need the Holy Ghost for that so we're we're just privileged to have our brother we're excited and he's a uh when they heard that he played the piano and he sung well then I had to text him back and ask him if he would give us a song and now bless us in that way it says all that you do you know we're going to be blessed so my precious brother just come and take your your Liberty in the Lord thank you amen I hope I'm on hope you all don't mind if I just sing a little song this morning it helps me to work out the nerves a little bit when I go somewhere new uh so if you don't mind this morning I'm G try to use [Music] this little girl was lying there the people all were weeping they just laughed at Jesus when he said she's only sleeping as he took her by the hand she began to live again some began to praise the Lord some began to say he's in the house and death has to fle and now there is light where Darkness used to be and now there is hope and there's no more doubt Oh Praise His Name praise His name he's in the house I was like that little girl I was dead in all my sin till Jesus touched my heart and gave me life again I am just a house of clay ever since that blessed day there's a light that shines in me for all the world to see that he's in the house and death has to flee now there is night where Darkness used to be and now there is home and there's no more doubt praise His name praise His name he's in the house when John saw the glor the cloud around his head fell before that Holy One just as if he were dead and with seven stars in hand God laid it on the man joh began to live again joh began to see that he's in our midst oh death has to flee and now there is light manifest in you and me from the mouth of the Lord a twoed [Music] sword the sun Shin in his strength will he is in our midst oh death has to flee now there is light manifest in you and me from the mouth of the Lord a two-edged s the sun shines in his strength he's in the house [Music] [Applause] amen God bless you all this morning thank you for putting up with me amen we're happy to be here this morning I certainly appreciate the kindness of Brother John to invite someone like me I know he's been preaching the gospel long before I entered the ministry I don't know anything I have nothing new to bring I just uh I try to take the prophet's words and just bring them with a little emphasis to you this morning amen and there in the emphasis lies a little bit of my quirky personality that you'll have to put up with but uh that's all I aim to do this morning uh the Lord works on both ends I was driving here it was a 12-h hour drive and we were listening to the prophet in the car and then all of a sudden the anointing come down in the car and I was like Lord usually this doesn't happen unless I'm about to preach uh what What's Happening uh so I I was on my way I started to say to my wife I suspect I know we don't plan on preaching this Sunday but uh I'm feeling the presence of the Lord here and then just almost as soon as we pulled into the driveway brother John you were calling as we were pulling into the driveway there in Toledo and so God works on both ends he knows what he's doing he has it all in control so we certainly appreciate you brother John and sister Cheryl and uh I was talking to my wife a little bit about you this morning just asking what do they like and you know she she was just telling me that you know of all the people that she knew and that she met and that she interacted with here while she lived in Michigan she just said that you were some of the finest Christians that she ever I can certainly see that and reflected also in your people and in the church as well so God bless you this morning uh forgive me just trying to uh work out some of the nervousness a little bit but if you would stand with me and let's work to look to the word of God this morning amen uh I'm gonna do a little uh bit of a slideshow here this morning I just like to show you where I'm getting what I'm saying to you um let's turn in our Bibles this morning to Matthew chapter 14 Matthew chap 14 and verse 22 whenever you have it you say amen amen now I come to realize that at work when you get there to the office you have to clock in then you can start working when you come to church it's the opposite you got to clock out first you got to let go of all the thoughts you got to let go of everything that happened to you during the week all all the thoughts that the devil's throwing you away you got to put those aside this morning and let's say let's concentrate on Jesus this morning brother Brandon would say every baby has to cry for his own candy I've got a little one there when you hear him start to cry in the service this morning he's not crying for the others to get some milk he's crying for himself to get some milk so you got to out just the same to Jesus to get your milk this morning amen uh Matthew 14 and: 22 it says straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him onto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up pay attention to those words he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the the wind was contrary doesn't that sound like everyday life the wind was contrary it sounds like every morning you get up something else is wrong something else is going on the wind was contrary for them and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good share it is I Be not Afraid isn't it wonderful to hear those words from the Lord Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefor didst thou doubt I want you to pay attention to something here he said come in verse 2 9 Jesus said come and the moment that Jesus said come the care of Peter was placed into jesus' hands Peter's protection was placed into jesus' hands now there was nothing that could happen to Peter but what Jesus already knew would happened but what Jesus knew that if it happened to him I could save him I could rescue him and if God would call us out in this age and say come out of her my people if we take that step if we say Lord I believe I will believe in the message of the hour then it is his responsibility to take care of us just the same way as it was his responsibility and everything was settled the moment he said come it was his responsibility to take care of Peter and it's his responsibility this morning to take care of his own Sheep amen God bless you let's pray Heavenly Father Lord you know I am nothing Lord Jesus I am just your servant this morning Father I didn't come here to to speak words I came to get out of the way that you might speak words oh Lord Jesus uh would you gather here with us this morning Father I I've heard it said how you met with 5,000 Lord you met with 70 you met with 12 Lord but your Prophet said you would even come to one hungry soul lord Jesus if there is a hungry Soul here this morning I pray that you would come down and fill them Lord fill them with your presence Lord with your word Lord and give your sheep what you have need of this morning we pray Lord I commit it all to you may thy will be done Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen God bless you you may be seated I want to preach this morning on a subject I I'd like to call uh when things goes on down here there is something going on up there uh a pretty lengthy title but you'll see in a little bit where I'm drawing this from when things goes on down here there is something going on up there too because as human beings we get sometimes trapped in the realm we're living in we're trapped in these Dimensions we're trapped seeing only the Earthly but on the flip side of that there's something going on in the heaven the prophet would say many times we think that it's disappointing when we get down sick or we feel that something has happened but if you just won't be discouraged and remember that all things work together for good to them that love God the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord again he would say why is it that these things happen but you know many times they are a blessing in disguising I love the words he uses blessing in disguising God why do you have to disguise is this blessing why can't you just tell me it's a blessing but I'm going I'm going through the worst right now Lord Jesus but God would say that's your blessing in disguising many times we can't understand them for some of us that's most of the time we can't understand them it's hard for us to look past what's happening to us in the present true he said if you'll just let them alone God will work it out just right now listen as brother Brandon when he describes this sermon that he preaches it is I be not afraid he always begins uh uh describing the situation that the disciples find themselves in here they are with Jesus and then he sends them out on the boat and he begins to point something out call something out that they went in the boat but they went without Jesus when we go without Jesus problems are sure to follow brother M will say we've went away with our church believing it's all right because we got great organizations great buildings and we've left Jesus behind there are many things that we can do and leave Jesus behind it's important for us every morning that we wake up say I can't walk without Jesus I can't talk without Jesus I can't live without Jesus there's nothing that I can do without Jesus I can't live this Christian walk in and of myself I've come to find out the more that I preach the more that I learn that I can't do it it it's Converse it's opposite to the thinking of man uh you know if you're out if you're a professor of some uh field if you're if you're a worker in a certain career the more that you do it the more confident you feel the more the better you feel like I I know this now if you've been a doctor for many years you can say oh I've seen this case before but not so with the Gospel of Jesus Christ not so with the word of God the more that I read it the more that I realize lord it's going to take something greater than me the more that I preach the more that I realize I need Jesus but leaving Jesus behind trouble is certain to come you see they had gotten in that boat and they were fishermen they had done this a thousand times you can wake up every morning and say well I've done this a thousand times I've been a Christian for a while now I've I've listened to quite a few tapes myself I I I know what I'm doing Lord and then that's when the Lord will send the trial just to Humble you a little bit and let you know that he's still in control you still need him amen amen there they were in the boat trouble was all around got an amen out of somebody amen he said many times you might think the same thing my friend you might think you have went off without him but remember he is still watching you there's there the devil gets you he tries to say oh you went off without Jesus there you go but remember all that time even when you're in the midst of the trial even when you think even when you recognize Lord truly I have failed he's still watching you he knows right where you are there may be trouble in your home there may be trouble in your soul there may be trouble in your body the prophet covered everything now trouble in your soul trouble in your home trouble in your body whatever it is don't you worry he's got his eyes on you he is watching you I say he is watching this church this morning he is watching you he watched you this morning as you got dress maybe you were weary in your spirit in your body you were thinking Lord I I just don't feel like going today he was watching you all that time he knows what afflicts you he knows what troubles you he's got his eyes on you he is watching on you he's watching you here's the important part now he climbed up on top of a mountain he was looking out there and he seen every trick that the devil was playing Hallelujah somebody say every there's nothing that can happen to you but what God has already seen and known would happen to you there's nothing that can happen to you but what God can say say I allowed it to happen to you wow doesn't that switch the way that we think about the trials we go through doesn't that the switch it it turns everything upside down it turns it on its head now it's no longer about what's happening to me now it's about what has God allowed to happen to me this morning I'm not preaching to you a sermon I'm preaching to you a lesson that that the Lord taught me am so it's it's personal these are things that I had to I had to learn I had to learn how to to look at uh God's word the right way to look at what's happening to me the right way to realize that he's got it all in control every trick the devil was playing he not only climbed but he climbed the ramp parts of Calvary not only to Calvary but the ramp parts of Glory he sits tonight at the Majesty he looks down on Earth there's not even a ripple can come on the water without its by his permission not even a ripple in your life amen did something go wrong this morning did you lose your keys did you lose your shoe on the on the way to church uh did you get to work and then you you got an assignment you didn't really want to do there's not even a ripple that can happen in your life but what God already knows about it he can look out on the sea and not even a ripple not a wave will come but what God knows about it he knows every bird that flies in the sky he knows where they will Nest he knows every blade of grass he knows every every leaf on the tree and he knows every detail of your life hallelujah it's by his permission the the sea can't move a leaf can't move a bird can't fly oh blessed be the name of the Lord and you can imagine them now they're in the boat there it is rocking oh oh what are we going to do are we going to die here is the boat every wave that would hit you can imagine how that boat would go up and oh you know that moment when the boat goes up and then you lose your stomach for a little bit and you feel like that in life sometimes oh god what have you thrown me into what what is going on here I've lost my stomach I I feel like I'm in freef Fall you can feel like that in your mind sometimes but there in that time there in the storm there in the trial you hear a voice that says it is I Be not Afraid and you'd say God here now I wasn't expecting you here but here in this trial here in this Darkness here while it's raining we're here where I can hardly see in front of me I don't know what lays ahead but here I would hear it is I Be not Afraid here and during that time to hear his voice that's when God loves to speak that's when God loves to come down to his children that's when he'll come down and speak to your heart it is I Be not Afraid those are the times that he uses to come down and say it is I Be not Afraid you see we're always looking at what's in front of us there they were on the boat all they could see is what was in front of them but we've got to switch our thinking from Earthly to Heavenly switch our thinking from time based to Eternity based it's very hard to do but can you imagine now an eternal God a God who wait back in the beginning somewhere that one bat of his eyelids perhaps could have taken 10 million years that Revolution to accomplish that this is the god that would maybe perhaps he would have one thought for a 100 million years and think about that one thought you you don't know the scale of time that we're dealing with it's impossible for us to comprehend what's your name brother Indigo go brother Indigo God could have thought about brother indigo for 10 million years just to think about him alone him alone nobody else perhaps God just thought about him what he would look like the way he would comb his here what he would like dislike what would make him upset what would make him happy and God thought about him God loves him God had his picture there in the back part of his mind this is the type of God that we're talking about this is the one that loves us the one perhaps way back in the beginning as he thought about you and just you he put everybody aside for just a moment just to think about you for 10 million years wow God thought about you more than even you think about you he thought about you for longer than you even have time here on the earth to think about you he thought about what you would go through he thought about what would happen to you more than you've had time to think about what happened to you and that's a lot of the times what we dwell on what happened to me Lord God is trying to get you to look up and show you that there's something else while something's going on down here there's something something going on up there amen now follow me now as we try to progress through this thought when something's going on down here there's an equivalent happening up there somewhere am amen I can imagine John perhaps he was one of the talkative ones on the boat as they were rowing out there Jesus had just fed 5,000 and he said you know my mother used to tell me when when our ancient people come into the land she was telling us about how that the people were hungry and they didn't know what to do and they were perhaps some murmuring some complaining perhaps they got what we call in our house angry hungry you just get angry for no reason maybe I'm the only human being here but but maybe they were getting hangry and then they were they were Desiring food but while that was happening down here there was something he was saying my mom used to tell me how Jehovah God the stern brow oh how he rained Mana down out of Heaven amen said oh that that that look that Jesus gave as he as he multiplied the bread surely this must be the Jehovah God surely this must be the one that was up there because when they were hungering down here there was something going on up there when they were hungering down here there was an aroma that be to build up in Heaven's kitchen amen something was cooking and God would SWAT away all the angels as they come you know like how when your wife is cooking something in the kitchen she say no that's not for you don't touch that God would say no that's not for you that's for the kids he's going to rain down this man on them because while they were hungering down here there was already something transpiring up there God already had the solution in work up there God was already baking something up in the kitchen and he was raining it down I say if you're hungry this morning blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness I say if you're hungry this morning God is ready to pour out to you if if you will receive it if you will believe that he can Amen brother Bron would describe the situation that happened in the Garden of Eden and how his children had fallen then one day I found where the Prophet said in the message I don't have it up here in the message God's provided approach to Divine Fellowship 1960 he said then one day there was a voice came up in the presence of God and said those your loved ones your children has fallen they have sinned and have did that which was wrong said God didn't just select some Angel to go down and look it over to see if it was so or not or or a certain cherubim of the heavens but God came himself crying Adam Where Art Thou God himself come crying for his Lost Child amen listen to what he said take place now then one day there was a voice came up in the presence of God and said those your loved one your children has fallen and it spurred God into action you see something had transpired on the Earth his children had fallen and the equivalent action had happened up in heaven God said what my children has fallen and he was on his way down to go there the Angels had fallen before nothing bothered him he never budged at that the Angels could fall the devil could fall it didn't bother him at all but when his children fell there was an Associated action in heaven when his children fell then God said I need to rise I need to go down and check this out myself and he was on his way I say if you are a child of God and you have stumbled and you have fallen into sin you've made a mistake this morning I say almighty God is on his way almighty God is on his way down my little children I sometimes send them out into the driveway I'll say go ride your bikes and then they'll go out and somehow even though they have the training wheels they find a way to fall over and so when they fall over what do you think my reaction is as a parent I don't go up to them and say you you were so full of Pride that's why you fell yep you you you were a serpent seat to begin yeah you that's why you yeah you were made to S no that's not what God does when his children fall we can live under that cloud we can live under that uh feeling like God God is there to to to judge us like that but if you are a child of God God comes down to save you God comes down to offer a pathway back to Salvation for you God comes down to rescue you just like I would run to my son I would pick him up off the bicycle say okay let me dust you off I'm I'm here I'm going to show you how to do it we're going to try again we're going to get it right this time God is here to do the same thing to you this morning if you have failed and if you're honest with yourself we have all failed at some time it doesn't have to take long you could you could say we have Pro somebody's probably failed this morning on their way to church maybe you argued in the car on the way to church it's easy to fail as a human being but but our God is here to save us yes he's on his way many times we get the impression of God that he's standing uh with a hammer ready to crush us if if if we have made a mistake mistake or if we have failed but our God is not standing with a hammer he's standing over us with nail scarred hands that's the god that we're serving that's the god that we believe in one day he will be the judge but today he's in the earth trying to save everybody he's not here trying to send you to hell this morning he's trying to get you to heaven he's trying to get you to see the truth he's trying to get you to fall in love with his word he's trying to get you to woo you to fall in love with him he's after your heart am it's many times us that we're only after the hand of God God bless my business God bless my family God bless my finances God we want the hand of God but who will seek the heart of God hallelujah God is down he's coming down he heard his children fall I'm on my way I have to save them I have to rescue them I have to make a way back even sending them out of the garden he made a way he said I I will make a way for them to come back he had a plan already of Salvation he had a Plan of Redemption already that would unfold even even before they could fall and leave the garden God had in the back part of his man mind a plan for Redemption amen amen now I I spent uh 12 hours driving here but prior to that I had to pack my vehicle I had to pack all of my things my belongings and while I was making ready for that uh uh there there was no chance there there was not a moment in time that it could be possible that I would pack up all all those things in my vehicle and then drive away and forget my kids ks in the house right any parent knows that you can pack for a 12-hour road trip uh it's impossible that you would get in the car and take off driving and forget the three kids in the house and neither would God set all of these things happening in Leo deia neither would he put all of these political players in place neither would would he allow uh uh the the Beast and the word World Council to start start to set in place that great Machinery that they will use to uh uh to enact to their will upon the people neither will he allow the World Council of churches to start to take place neither will he allow all the signs of the times to start to take place in leod deia without remembering his children neither will will he allow all of these things to to go on in the polit in the political realm neither will he allow evil to increase in the land he will not allow all of this and then forget about his children I say he's getting ready to take his children out of here and all the signs that we see happening should make us say thank God he's preparing thanks God he will not forget his own he will not allow all of this to happen and then leave his children behind no I say the children are the first thing in his mind they are the first thought of his and everything that you see happening around it's only a sign of the time to help us to get ready to point and to know that Jesus Christ is coming back for his own amen thank you Jesus there is one brother brm told a story about a little boy that had fallen off the wagon one day and then I think in old Cowboy or Sheriff saw him falling off the cliff and he saved the boy and now uh he rescued the boy now time went on that boy lived his life one day he he come to start to do the wrong thing and then uh he had to appear before the court when he appeared before the court he recognized that the man that was the judge was was that sheriff that had saved him when he was a little boy he said judge don't you recognize me can't can't you help me can't you say me again like you did when I was a little boy and the judge would say then I was your savior but today I am your judge I say Jesus Christ is not going to step into that role just yet but there will come a time when he will today is the day of your salvation today he does not stand as your accuser today he stands in your defense today he stands as your attorney I say Now's the Time to get in now when he stands as our attorney as our Advocate brother Brandon with say when you pay an attorney uh you're paying him for the knowledge that he has of the law if you got in trouble with the law or you need something C done legally or or you've ever had to go and hire an attorney you're paying him because you know that you don't possess the knowledge of the law that he has so you can't plead your case the way that he could now when it comes to Jesus Christ he is not somebody who just knows the law of God he's somebody who is the law of God he's the Fulfillment of the law of God there and if I commit my case to him if I commit my soul to him he pleads the case on my behalf there is no way that I can lose the case as it stands before the father because of my attorney because he is the law Jesus Christ is the law and if I commit everything that happens to me in life to him I can rest assured I can know that Jesus Christ will take care of it amen so every little thing that happens to you every accusation that happens to you uh everything that goes wrong in your life hey just hand it over to the attorney hand it over to the advocate say Lord can you please take care of this for me any evil word spoken against you any something done wrong to you hand it over to the attorney there you go just hand it to him God is Looking Down With Love on his people this morning Hallelujah you can think of the Mount of transfiguration and how uh Elijah appeared he represented the justice of God Moses appeared he represented the law of God uh but there was another one there on the mountain it was Jesus and he represented God's love brother Brenham would say that when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace takes over he would say when his love projected his feeling Christ stepped out to take his place it required something to take the place his love alone went for you and Grace provided a sacrifice for you what's he saying that when God projected his Divine love to to this earth It produced Christ in the earth amen think about it John 3:16 for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son when God projected his love to the world It produced Christ in a Manger Christ was born in the earth when you project love one to another it produces Christ in that situation if you will project love inside of this church it will produce Christ inside of this church if you enter into a situation you don't know what to do and you project just project the love of God it'll bring Christ down into that situation amen everything is centered on love brother Brandon would say unless each one of these gifts is put right in the center of love love it'll become selfish and indiff yes any gift in the body if we don't Center it right on love it'll become selfish and different amen oh the love of God this morning he looks down on love with his CH upon his children amen how many remember the story of the account of M Mah in the Bible how Mah was called up and and they didn't really want to know what he had to say and they they said all right is there one more yeah okay M bring him on up and then uh they said well tell us you know shall we go up and take it it's our land you know should we go up and take it and then MAA said at first oh yeah go ahead go ahead yeah kind of in a mocking way yeah sure go but no tell us for real then when he told them the truth they did not want to hear that that's true oh how they would strike Mya we're talking about when when things are going on down here there's something else going on up there amen now listen you know what that head Chief captain of the priest did like that walked right up pulled them horns off the top of his head smacked Mah right in the mouth that showed his religion didn't it well he just might have had a bloody jaw there for a few minutes and he said which way went the spirit of God when it went out of me to go to you he said just wait till you're sitting hiding in the cage Over Yonder and you'll know which way it went MAA did micaa said I saw Israel scattered he said I looked up into the heavens and I saw the great throne of God and there was Angels standing on the right hand and the left hand of God hold on now here's Mah he's brought before this Council and they're wanting to get an answer out of him and oh they're holding this great big counsel around maaya here on the Earth but when MAA looks up into heaven he sees he says I looked up into the heavens and I saw the great Throne of God and there was Angels standing on the right hand and the left hand of God that's the way it is with the believer when you'll stand for the word of God if you stand for the word of God while while the persecutions come here while the Temptations come here W while the agitators and the aggressors May gather around you but if you stand for the word of God there's another Council taking place up in the heavens they were holding a council when they seen all this happening like they was holding their Council down here remember when something's going on down here persecutors laughters fund makers there's something going on up there too you know just remember that fix your faith on that if you want something that fix your faith on this morning fix your faith on that that when something's happening down here to you there's also something happening up there if there's anything you should fix your faith on it's fix your faith on that am amen I don't have enough faith brother all I have is the faith of a mustard well that's all you need start to believe work with what you got amen praise God when something's going on down here there's something going on up there one day Elisha and his servant there they were in Dothan and the king of Syria was Waring against Israel and he took counsel with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp and the man of God sent unto the king of Israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for thither the syrians are come down and the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice therefore the heart of the king of Syria was soore troubled for this thing and he called his servants and he said unto them will you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel and one of the servants said not my Lord oh King but Elisha the prophet that is in Israel tell the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber and he said go spy where he is that I may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in Dothan therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold the host encompassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do you can imagine the scene there that was happening that morning his servant woke up it says he woke up early in the morning and you can imagine him now wake up early in the morning I guess it's Dawn outside uh it's a little dark you can't really see and he wakes up he hears some stirring looks outside he SE movement what is that looks a little close looks like horses and chariots oh no this can't be right this can't be right so he washes his face Tak some water no it puts back on his glasses oh Elisha he starts to scream he runs to his R runs to to Elisha he says and and Elisha would say to him he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha here's what the prophet would say notice there was a man with him his servant spiritual boy walked and poured water on the hands of the prophet a great position he had but when he seen the Syrian Army All Around Dothan had it backed all up he said my father look out there what a great number why we're surrounded now that's natural yes brother said that's natural it's natural it's normal to go and look at what you see first it's we're only human beings it's all we can do many times this is what's happening God this this this and then come the human reactions then then comes the first blow that you have to withstand as a Christian and you have to say you have to withstand those thoughts you have to withstand those feelings you have to withstand those emotions and after some sometimes you can feel guilty in that first wave that first wave of natural emotion that first wave perhaps angry annoyed uh conflicted uh but you have to weather that storm and then once you weather that storm there's a seed that God placed down on the inside there's something that he placed down on the inside down there in the soul that says no I will trust in the Lord Jesus no there's something else happening up there now that's the natural when everything seems to go wrong pointing a finger at you saying this and that and the doctor says you can't get well and so forth that's just the natural thing for you to think oh my this is the end but Elijah said there's more with us than there is with them now you can imagine how that Prophet or that gesi felt the servant he looked over at him he said why I don't see anybody he said God open this boy's eyes how many would say God open my eyes to morning to what's going on what's going on in my life Lord open my eyes just let me have a glance let me see as soon as God did something here it is get it when God opened his spiritual sight all around there prophets stood Chariots of Fire and angels of fire when he seen why the Chariots of Fire outnumbered the Syrian Army by the thousands in another place in the message I found where he said by the millions the mountains was on fire angels of fire horses of fire Chariots of Fire and the Bible said the angels of of God and Camp about those who fear Him oh how hard it is sometimes when we get in trouble when we're alone many times the Trials come when we're alone but it's in that time when we could say the mountains are on fire all around me and though all I can see is the enemy all around me all I can see is Satan attacking me on every hand but while something is happening down here there's another thing happening in another realm the mountains are on fire for the children of God angels are all around you horses of fire Chariots of Fire amen praise the Lord thank remember that Elijah when when he went up he had one Chariot but Elisha had asked for a double portion so when they opened his eyes they saw a double portion of Chariots there standing with with Elisha that's the hard part when something's going on down here yes there is something going on up there it's hard for us to grasp yes very hard to grasp when you're surrounded by Syrian chariots oh no what are we going to do trembling in the flesh but remember the flesh is uh the flesh always likes to jump first the flesh is the first reaction yes then after you weather that you remember that in your mind next time it happens the first time it happens oh anger Rises up the first time something happens to you oh confusion uh uh annoyance how could this happen a little bit agitated but remember that that's just the natural part that brother Ram talks about that's the first thing that happens then after that you weather that storm I like to use the example of the old tree uh the the first re human reaction the wind comes it blows it blows the tree it bends all the the branches begin to sway but then after that subsides the tree comes back to the center The Roots gr a little bit deeper that's the way it is with the Christian that first Rea that first reaction will blow you almost Bend you all the way over you think you're going to break but then something inside you snaps you back all right Jesus time to get back to church time to get back to reading my Bible time to get back to listening to the message time to get back in fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ I've been out of it for too long time to step back into what I'm supposed to do as a child of God whether the storm get past the natural get into the spiritual get past the Earthly and start to look into the Eternal amen amen thank you another example in the Bible we read of these Hebrew children how they were down there in Babylon they took a stand as they were praying they didn't pay attention to the king they didn't fear his command they were looking for thus sayith the Lord and old Nebuchadnezzar up there he'd say we'll teach these holy Ru rollers what to do around here we will show them whose boss around there uh he wanted to burn burn it out of them but you can't burn out fire with fire they had fire on the inside you can't burn the Holy Ghost out it's fire itself you can't boil it out you Can't Scare it out you can't run it out it's there to stay Prophet would describe them as they walked up you know and and there the the soldiers were poking them with their Spears because it was so hot they even they wanted to stay away poking them with their Spears brother Brandon would describe their steps of these boys as they would shorten you know shorten as they were getting closer to the furnace God help us God help us that when we go through the trials we not shorten our steps that we'll have the courage to to take our strides in the Lord Jesus Christ God help us when the time comes God help us if persecution should come that we will stand firm stand strong that we will walk with Christ no matter what help us Lord never to shorten our steps help us not to lose our zeal help us Lord Jesus not to step back but to always go forward help us to go further in Christ and never backwards help us to want more of God and never Less in our lives help us to want more of his righteousness in our lives and not less of it it Lord time came for Shadrach mesach and Abednego to show their colors their faith in God so they turned their back to the image they said our God is able to Deliver Us from this fiery furnace there's never a time that you can stand for stand will stand for God but what he will also stand for you amen I love the way that brother brandom would describe this scene I I I got a couple lines that I want to show you here that the prophet would say about this notice we're painting an awful dark picture down here let's turn our camera up this way once how about that amen we we've got our camera I'm focusing on what's this brother doing what's that sister doing what's this church doing what's everybody else doing I'm looking down here I've got such a narrow view I've got my camera focused on the wrong thing but we ought to say to one another let's turn our camera up this way once let's zoom out a little bit let's see what's going on up there next time you run into problems next time you have troubles let say to one another let's turn our camera up this way once amen us on your way home tonight when you're talking to your wife when you're talking to your husband H and you start to argue about something say let's turn our camera up this way once I love that I love that oh my always when there's anything going on down here there's something going on up there also there's also there's always two sides to it you know when Satan's on the job Jesus is also when Satan's on the job Jesus is also there's nothing that there's no action that Satan can take but what God has an associate equivalent action waiting to hit him with there's nothing that Satan can do to you but what God knows is every trick Jesus is also on the job ever who you yield your faith to that's the way it's going give it to who will you Yi your faith to in your situations who will you yield your your situation to who will you give your faith to it's your choice will I look at what's happening to me or will I look at what's happening up in the heavenlies will I fix my faith on Jesus Christ or will I get caught up in the day today will I get caught up in the things that are happening to me will I get caught up in the emotion will I get caught up in the natural amen there's always two sides to it amen amen amen let's look up this way you know I can see him setting up there in his majesty his Priestly robes draped down around him looking down I see coming to his right a great Angel his name is Gabriel great Archangel he comes running up he pulls his sword he said Master have you looked down in Babylon your people's taking a stand for you down there oh he would wave off he would wave him off wave off Gabriel wave off warmwood wave off all the other angels that would want to come uh perhaps worm would want to come down and and to wash that that furnace right off the face of the earth wormwood had a great time during the flood he was looking for some more action he was let me down there I'll do it I'll wash Babylon right off the face of the Earth God said no no no you can't you can't this is a man-sized job I've got to go down myself I say if you'll have enough faith for the Lord Jesus Christ to come and move in your situation he will come down and he will make the moves for you too often we try to make the moves we get caught up in the Earthly we got caught up in the natural we tried to fight our battles ourself but The Battle Belongs to the Lord it's his to fight it's is to control we just have to yield our faith to him amen so next time you see Satan on the job Jesus is also amen amen something else brother Brenham said here get the right one nine all right just a few more steps I can see Shadrach look at AB Abednego to see the last time before they step into the furnace it looks pretty dark doesn't it the picture I'm painting let's turn our camera now amen all the time there's something going on down here there's something going on up there at the same time amen we only look to the Earthly side but let's look up there am how many will say Lord I've gotten caught up looking down here way too much Lord help me to look up there amen my I originated in the thoughts of God why am I always uh trying to calculate and figure things out down here I was meant for a different realm amen right I can see him say come here East Wind north north south and west get under this Thunderhead I'm going to drive you like horses this morning he takes that big Thunderhead step out on it like a chariot reach up and get a hold of zigzag Lightnings out of the sky I love to imagine the scene in my head here comes Our Savior here he comes down I say if you're calling out for him this morning he's doing the same thing he's coming down he's grabbing that zigzag lightning out of the clouds here he comes down he's whirling down on on the East Wind the North and the South he's got the lightning in his hand he smacks him together and makes a loud thunder boom Nebuchadnezzar could hear it down on the earth there and about that time he passed by the Sea of life he picks off a palm he was going to come fan them with it down there in the furnace fan them with that Palm when they made their last step into the fiery furnace there was one like unto the son of one like the Son of God standing there Fanning away all the breezes like that talking over the future for them amen can you imagine uh that would seem like Insanity to the world I'm going to go talk about the future with a man in the furnace God is here this morning to talk about your future while you're going through the furnace God is here to talk about it with you Jesus wants to talk it over with you and you say Lord I'm in the Tempest I'm in the boat everything's going wrong you say Lord I'm in the furnace I'm in the fire I'm in the trial I'm In the Heat of the battle Lord and God's tapping you on the shoulder I'd like to talk about the future with you but Lord the doctor said I'm going to die tomorrow the doctor said I have one month to live but Jesus said I i' like to talk about the future with you don't did you forget about my word that said uh with his stripes you are healed did you forget about that talking over the future for them Amen brother imagine talking about the future in the in the furnace all the things the devil will try to to to get you to trip up no he'll try to get no you don't need to be in church anymore you don't need to believe the message anymore he's he's trying to trip you up wants to break your future but God is here this morning and if if you're discouraged if you're thinking you can't go on if you're thinking you can't do it anymore almighty God is here to talk over the future with you and tell you I've got plans for you to do I've got things for you to do do for my kingdom I've got a work for you to do amen it doesn't have to be preaching that's right we go out and we live our lives we're salty we shine the light on people see that there's something different about you it doesn't always have to be up here screaming and shouting many times it's the life that we live out there that's what people see that's the epistle they read that's some for some of them the only Bible that they will read oh to be used of God I say Lord please please oh God come work in my life use me in some way Jesus would say to the disciples let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you remember when something's going on down here there's something going on up there Jesus is saying what I'm going to be doing up there is I go to prepare a place for you so he's telling them let not your heart be troubled but that's exactly what we do we let our hearts be troubled exactly what he told us not to do he said I'm going to prepare a place for you don't don't let your heart be troubled I'm going to prepare a place for you let not your heart be troubled somehow we we interpreted that as worry and fret and doubt and be in dismay and be discouraged all the time but let not your heart be troubled why cuz if I go to prepare a place for you God doesn't waste time does he God doesn't build things up there God doesn't prepare a place prepare a new body prepare all these wonderful things that await Us in heaven for nobody if he went to prepare a place for you and he's coming back to get you am if he went to do all of these things for you then no matter what you're going through in this life you can say my God is coming back he's coming back to Rapture me he he won't pack up the vehicle and then forget the kids my God is coming back he's coming back to Rapture me amen we read on the day of Pentecost and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place in one place and suddenly there came a sound from where from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting suddenly there came a sound from Heaven you see where this started from you see where this originated from and when something was going on down here they had gotten in one Accord they had gotten in one place they had done what Jesus told them to do and suddenly accompanying that equivalent action in heaven here come the sound come from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting I say if we'll do what Jesus Christ wants us to do in in our lives if we'll follow his word to the tea if we'll follow it to the letter if we'll do everything that we can to seek after his heart to obey his word to stand for him there's an action that starts up in heaven when God sees that he respects that when God sees his people living out his word on the earth he respects that there's an action that's happening up in heaven and there the disciples had gathered in one Accord in one place I say can we check all the boxes this morning can we get in one Accord can we get in one place he said where two or three are gathered he would be right in the midst with us if he said that then he's capable and he's able to fulfill it this morning there they had done what he said to do and there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting I say God let it be the same this morning if we can get in one Accord in one place in one mind if we can get our mind on the Lord Jesus Christ let's let that action start to happen in heaven amen Grant it Lord there was one day a little martyr we call him Steven the first martyr in the Bible the New Testament dying little Steven because he stood there Stern brother Steven had been brought into that channel where he knowed God he was filled with the Holy Ghost the Bible said they those Pharisees they would they would drag him like a bunch of wolves brother brandham said like a bunch of wolves dragging a lamb and when they throwed him on the ground and took great big clouds of rocks and begin to beat him on the head with it like that little Steven being full of the Holy Ghost the Bible said he looked steadfast towards heaven raised his hands and said I see Heavens open and I see Jesus Christ and I see Jesus standing at the right hand of God let me find this one when a h when any man has finished his Works he steps down when I quit preaching I set down but not until I quit preaching when you're working you set down your work is finished Jesus sat down at the right hand of Glory but when he seen this first martyr dying for the cause of Christ the resurrected Lord Jesus brushed back the skies and he must have raised from his throne to give a special welcome to little Steven to bring him home brother benus here saying Jesus sat down but when he saw what Steven did oh that thrilled him so much that he that he would that he would step off of that Throne a little bit and let me give a little welcome to Stephen I so enjoyed what he did for me I enjoyed that he stood for me I say when we stand for Jesus Jesus will stand for you if you stand for his word Jesus will stand for you every stone that is thrown at you God knows about it every stone that was being thrown at Stephen God knew about it every stone the devil throws at you every doubt every every evil thought that is thrown at you God knows everything God God knows what's happening to you you can imagine every stone that's being thrown at Stephen God was Rising just a little bit higher to get ready to welcome him there amen when something was going on down there there was something equivalent happening up there amen amen I've got just a little bit more to go through I hope you're not tired this morning amen bless the lordes I I'll try to keep going and if I hear any tummies rumbling then I'll stop might be my own rumbling now listen listen as we begin to describe this thought now brother Braham starts to lay it out negative and positive there's something happening down here there's something happening up there something happening down here reflecting what has already taken place up there he says we pray God as these people are coming to the alter to be prayed for seeing that we are here negative just the negative the positive is just all around us the immortal Immortal spirit that was upon us shall never die he would say every time I see a I see a tree I think that tree is the negative there is a positive somewhere that tree was made off of something and intelligence made it let's follow this thought a little bit more so we realize that we're here in negative form as long as there is a negative there has to be a positive there cannot be a negative without a positive C because it's a it's it's because of the positive that makes the negative like you had a negative picture of some object there has to be an object somewhere or to strike the Light Strike that lens or there wouldn't be any negative so when we see that our life here is in the negative and knowing that we're in the image of some life somewhere then we know that there is a positive somewhere that the has struck and it's reflected something here on Earth he said so when we see that our life here is in the negative and knowing that we're in the image of some life somewhere and here we are going through life wondering why doesn't everything work out for me why isn't it going right why am I not getting everything that I want why are my finances not the way that I want it but he said this life is the negative there's a better life coming off somewhere this life we're only made in the image of some life somewhere Amen brother he would describe to us another concept he would say that God took a picture of you way back somewhere for the foundations of the world we're made up of a substance that's unseen made material and God will give that substance back see it goes from a natural something you put your hands on to gases from gases into acids into gases on back like that till finally all winds up to one little thing and that is spirit and this Spirit occupied these gases he said when you become a young man or a young woman like God takes a picture of you God has that picture of you and he's describing all these chemical processes that might go into your body to make to make you up but he's saying that God has a picture of you what he's saying is that no matter what happens to this body no matter if this body decays goes into the ground no matter if you be uh come to sickness no matter if this body is destroyed God has that picture of you and even if it be destroyed the who made it has the picture of you and he knows how to recreate it and bring it right back in the resurrection but now this picture is the main thing then in the resurrection those gases and acids and things come right back into the place and develops this picture again now this picture was not taken when you was 16 or 18 or 20 years old at best when it was taken when was it taken before there was a foundation of the world it was put in God's Great file then only thing it did was featured itself here for you to make your choice see then you become a servant of God him for knowing it makes him a redeemer as we've been through it then that picture is absolutely this is the negative the negative part of life is where you're living now and anything if there is a negative there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative therefore if this is a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere and this ain't the real thing this is only a foreshadow of the real thing that is to come now you got it so I don't care what they would do with you they cannot destroy that profil am you can delete your profile picture off of Facebook you can delete a social media profile uh uh files pictures taken of you somewhere can be corrupted but the picture that God took of you can never be corrupted that one can't be touched that one can't be deleted that one can't be wiped away that record is up in heaven somewhere amen that picture is in God's Great Gallery up there it's up in God's Great Gallery nobody can sneak in there like a thief nobody can can go in there and try to erase your name nobody can try to to destroy your picture or defile it or throw it out it can't be done God has that picture of you he knows what he's pulling you back to it cannot destroy it it's in heaven you could burn it up feed it to the lines do it any way you want to it'll come forth again just as sure as two twos is for just as sure as God spoke it it'll come forth again it'll come forth so no matter where you are here he says it cannot destroy it it's in heaven you could burn turn it up feed it to the lies do it any way you want to it'll come forth again no matter what will happen to you in this life it'll come forth again my God already has the picture something already took place up there and now whatever happens down here I know what I'm going back to something has already taking place up there so what goes on down here I I don't have to worry about it no matter if I should lose life or limb God has a picture of me up there something already took place up there amen now remember the thought we're trying to bring this morning when when things goes on down here there's something going on up there the last little bit here that I have to read before we close now it's a little bit wordy I'm pulling out a thought that brother Brandon brings in the church age book from the sardian church age I try to stay with me uh it's a lot of words I tried to Crunch it all on the screen maybe I shouldn't have but I just wanted to show you that this is a thought that he's bringing to you and he's bringing it to you for a reason now I'll pay attention to these words now he's talking in the church age book about this word bride and he's starting to break into election and predestination he says now let us go another step but before we do let us review our case thus far first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of God stands in election it was purposed in himself it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride amen now listen she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was forn and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in the Judgment because sin cannot be imputed unto her goes on to prove that but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels her name each of her members was written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world wow something went on up there okay secondly there is another class their names are also in the book of life and they will come up in the second Resurrection brother brandom goes on to describe uh four total classes of people here now you remember in school when the teacher would uh stand up and she would read off your grades that you got in on an exam she said brother John you got a 100 brother indigo you got a 100 brother Joel you got a when you heard your name you didn't really care about the other score so much you're just so happy oh I got my score same kind of thing I'm telling you here your name was written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world you can rejoice and say thank God I got my score scored 100 thank God written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Hallelujah you can praise God you can say no matter what happens to me my name is written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world the ups and downs of life don't matter anymore my name was already written no matter what transpires down here something has already taking place up there now here's the other classes secondly there is another class their names are also in the book of life and they will come up in the second Resurrection such are the foolish versions and the righteous as are spoken of in Matthew 25 in this class also are those who do not worship the Beast or become involved in the Antichrist system but die for their faith even though they are not in the not having been bornn again but they will come up in the second resurrection and go into eternal life here's the third and fourth thirdly there are the borderline Christians such as we saw in Israel coming out of Egypt these had their names in The Book of Life and their Works written in the books these having failed to obey God and being void of the spirit though even the signs and wonders were amongst them will have their names removed from The Book of Life amongst this WOW even even the signs and wonders amongst them will have their names removed from the book of life so you mean that we should not seek signs and wonders as if they were some Vindication of where our name falls on this list rather we should seek something else a lot of time people people are seeking the gifts of the Spirit I say first let's Center our lives and seek the fruits of the spirit let the gifts be secondary to that that's right brother amongst this group will be the ones like Judas who though entirely void of the spirit but are religious will have manifestation in their lives and though on the books were not the elected in him such also as balum will be in that group fourth and finally are the ones whose names have never been or will ever be written on the books now how many might say this portion of the word is hard for the human mind to grasp since this portion of the word is hard for the human mind to grasp it must be accepted and believed by faith I Believe by by fa faith that my name was written there on the book before the foundation of the world now here here's a couple more now uh let me just read the the highlighted portion thus if God has so designed that there be those whose names are placed in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life and cannot be erased for they are the names of his bride then we must accept that here's one more he said we have the same right today in the church names are going to be blotted out of the book of life he said no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life for that is another record though contained in the Book of Life skipping down a little bit he said now we can see why the redeemed bought back by original owner bride she was in him as Eve was in Adam cannot ever have her member names taken off the Record she is part of him she is in the throne she can never be judged everyone in the Bride is a member of him and he loses none but that is not so concerning the all in the Book of Life for amongst them are even those like Judas who have part in the record but their names were removed now I read all of this out of the church age book so that I could read you this quote where brother brandom says every name that would ever be on the book was put on the book before the book was ever written every name that was put on the book was put on the book before the book was ever written in other words the name predates the book in other words the name was in the mind of God the name was somewhere back before the foundation of the world now I can say that my name was there in the mind of God now I don't have to worry about what's going on in my day-to-day life now I don't have to worry about anything that happens to me I don't have to worry about what the devil throws at me because God had my name back there now I know that my name was written there on the book before even the book existed so what does it matter the day today what does it matter the up and downs what does it matter the times that I Fallen the times that I fail the times that I was discouraged those things don't matter anymore cuz I know where I came from I know where I'm going back to I know that God is pulling me through I know he had my name in his mind and if this happened if this transpired up there it doesn't matter what's going on down here now I can look at down here and I can say well no matter what's going on no matter how discouraged I feel as a Christian no matter if I feel like I can no longer make it no longer if I if I feel like I can no longer do it no matter if I feel like I'm not I'm not cut out for this no no matter what I feel God has already determined it and when these things happen down here when the discouragement happens something has already happened up there and I'm just living it out down here no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life for that is another record though contained in the Book of Life what have you done in your life and you'll say Lord there's no way you can use me after this I failed too bad I I fell too hard I fell too far but God would say no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life and if your name was there God will raise you right back up to where you need to be can you see election can you see predestination now nothing can go wrong in your life but something has already covered it up there something has already transpired up there I can go through my tough times I can go through my hard times I can go through confusion but I can say God I know you'll work it out because my name is up there somehow I have to step into what you have called me to do in my life somehow I'll get there cuz you're pulling me through somehow I have to match that what's happening down here has to match what has already taken place up there and that's what I'm living to that gives me the confidence to wake up the next morning after i' I've failed after I've done something wrong after I've done it the wrong way it gives me confidence to get up the next morning and say Lord forgive me for what happened yesterday but today is a new day today I'm stepping forward today I'm going I'm going getting closer back to that profile image that you had of me before the foundation of the world I'm getting closer to what you have called me to what you thought that I would be doing here on the earth way back before the foundation of the world nothing can go wrong anymore it secures the Christian you're anchored now now nothing can happen anymore now you know well my name was there I'm going back there so whether my path in life goes like this whether it goes straight up or whether it's nice and steady some people seem to have it nice and steady some people seem to have it up and down but if something already happened up there if your name was already thought of even before there was a book to write it in then it doesn't matter what goes on with the up and down eventually God will pull you right back up to where you belong thank you Jesus that's the power of the word of of God brother Brandon would describe the word like this he would say that that it is the prophet that catches what God has already said for the word was before the foundation of the world God spoke the word and it's laying way out stretched out in time we're time beings it's hard for us to grasp this he's saying the prophet catches what God has already said amen and you think of the power of that statement the prophet catches what God has already said so in other words when we believe the message God lays the word out somewhere in eternity Prophet comes along in his time he goes up and he takes the peak what's what's up there oh that's the word then he comes comes back down and he brings it to us yes because the word was already there amen we've got to change our frame of mind change our way of thinking oh the prophet came back with this oh don't worry about what's going on down here your name's already up there stepped up into this word took a look looking around he said no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life there is another record contained in the book of there's an eternal section it can't be touched come back down begin to tell us this now we can take courage thank God for the message thank God for the message that secures us anchors us amen I think I've gone long past time here let me find a place to stop praise God wow well I thank you for your pool this morning amen I'll end with this last little uh quote here brother Brandon Begin to talk about uh countdown uh it's a real special way that he delivered it in the message of the countdown you know the uh the horse and buggy it could achieve a certain speed one horsepower they go down the road uh the automobile could reach a certain cruising speed uh even today our automobiles it's only a certain speed that it could reach the airplane can go up to a certain altitude and just begin to cruise at a certain altitude it can't break out any higher than that but then he begins to talk about a rocket talk about an astronaut talk about a space age there's something different about that all the other ones they're they're pointed on a certain plane but this one is pointed a different direction this one will break through the stratosphere this one will it doesn't reach a certain altitude and begin to cruise it doesn't reach a certain point and stop it it has a destination in mind and then it just keeps going until it gets to that destination it breaks up and out it breaks through every Creed it breaks through every Dogma it breaks through every doubt every depression it breaks through all of that the message breaks through all of the denomination it breaks through all of the denominational World it breaks up and out until it reaches into the eternity my brother Bram would describe EX actly what that rocket was he said that was Christ and then he would describe how that astronaut he would get inside of the rocket strap in and then something begin to happen a countdown a countdown which was outside of his control where the Brandon would teach us how man counts down from 10 nine eight but God he said God throws all that all out of the window God has a different countdown he's been counting down through the seven Church ages Ephesus uh oh got it right on the wall there for me thank you Ephesus Smyrna pergamus Thera Sardis Philadelphia Leo deas God's countdown is seven oh but he said get in Christ and once you get in Christ you you get strapped in you get locked in you're inside of this rocket the astronaut has nowhere to go he all he can do is sit there and rest and wait for the countdown and that's exactly what the bride is doing she's gotten into Christ she's gotten into the word she gets into Christ she sits and she waits for God to fulfill his word cuz she knows that when something is going on down here and she's strapped in and she's waiting there's a countdown happening up there there's something else happening that's outside of her control there's something else happening that is beyond her there something else happening that is entirely in the hands of God he knows the day or the and the hour he knows exactly when he will come he knows exactly when it's liftoff time for the bride he knows exactly when the day and the hour is and all we have to do is sit in our seat and get strapped into this rocket and to wait and to Believe get in Christ he said he said the rocket is Christ he he is instructing us do you want to get out of here do you want to go in a Rapture do you want to make it out of this evil age get inside of Christ the devil will tell you that you're sick and that you're defeated but you get inside of Christ and you just wait for God's countdown to fulfill his word of by his stripes we are healed you get inside of Christ and you wait for God to fulfill his promises once you get inside of Christ then the countdown is outside of your control once you get inside of Christ down here then something begins to take place up there God begins to countd down the days until his promise is fulfilled in your life amen God bless you if we could stand together praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen can imagine Moses mother that morning as she picked up the baby and she gave it to the father give him a kiss and then Miriam and Aaron give give the baby a kiss she put the baby in the basket how hard it is sometimes for us to put the baby in the basket how hard it is sometimes to give up our control over the situation and to trust that well I'm going to put this baby in the Nile something will be going on down here but there will be something going on up there there that morning she put the baby in the Nile loaded the basket off down now while she had given up control while something was going on down here there was something going on up there there the basket would float and then would come a crocod here comes a crocodile coming and God would say Gabriel go down get 10,000 angels go down there line line the line the Nile River I want you to take care of this basket and there the crocodile would be about to bite the basket and then a Whirlpool would come and suck the crocodile through and the basket would go on it would get caught up in the grasses there and then just about the time it was stuck um Miriam was watching it was stuck but then just about that time Here Come Those Old fishermen they were kicking their way through the grasses and and they were getting ready to throw their rods out and it dislodged the basket and it went on down brother Brandon would say that while those angels were lining that that Christ didn't come there at the start he came at the end and he was waiting for the basket to receive that's the same way that God is doing with you this morning you might not see him around you but he's waiting at the end he's the one that's pulling you through the whole time he's the one that's giv his angels orders to stand guard around you when something's happening in your life there's something else going on up there God bless you let's pray this morning Lord Jesus we thank you so much for your presence this morning thank you Lord that you would speak your sweet words to us father to encourage us to know that while something's happening here Lord there's something else going on up there Lord help us Lord to fix our faith on that amen Lord Jesus just as our eyes are closed and our heads bowed Lord I would ask the congregation if there are any that have perhaps held on too tightly Lord perhaps unable to put the basket in the Nile or to let go of situations if there are any that perhaps Lord they've been focused uh too much on what's going down here as we raise our hands to you to signify that Lord Lord may you come down in their situations and take control yes Lord father God may you speak to their hearts Lord Comfort them Lord woo them oh God speak to our hearts encourage us Lord give them the strength Lord to go on tomorrow Lord is fine Lord we're in your presence and then Monday morning comes Lord it becomes difficult to to keep sight keep track of what's going on up there oh God would you help us Lord Lord I pray Lord maybe like Elisha would pray Lord that our eyes would be open father if you just give us a glimpse Lord perhaps you could use this service this morning to just crack open our vision a little bit Lord give us a little glimpse of that other realm Lord of what's happening around us Lord give us the fa faith and the courage Lord as we go through trials and sickness Lord doubt and depression Lord and Satan will go on a rampage in people's lives many times and just try to get them to crumble Lord but in that moment father if anyone here is in that moment I pray that they would be able to look up and see the mountains on fire lord the horses and the Chariots of Fire all around Lord uh take these broken words father that just all out of sorts father that perhaps you could speak a word to your children's Heart Lord to encourage them this morning Lord Jesus all all of our Lives we commit into your hands oh God thank you Lord we thank you Lord for the word Lord that you laid out there in eternity Lord you sent a prophet to peek up there and catch it and bring it back down to us Lord let us know our names were there on the book in the beginning father Lord it gives us such assurance and peace Lord to know that nothing can transpire down here but what you know of Lord Lord there's no trick that the enemy can play Lord it's all in your hands father Lord we love you Lord we commit All to You Lord uh thank you Lord for these wonderful people Lord their sweet Spirit as the word was ministered Lord I so appreciate that father may you just pour out a blessing on them for that oh God lord may may you help us
