TRANSCRIPT
========================================
for free [Music] dream for you one more time lift it up to him Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary fear and holy tried and true with Thanksgiving I'll be early living sanctuary [Music] for you how many that's the desire amen was Bauer heads in word of prayer before we begin oh gracious Heavenly Father we just love to be in your house Lord Jesus our hearts just yearn in thirst Lord just to be in Precious communion with you Lord I pray is we just invite your presence here you'll come down lord and distill with our hearts like only you can Lord touch us only like you can Lord father we just need your quickening power just to transform this word to our hearts Lord help us to receive this word Lord of life as only you can give it to us Lord bless the sacrifices all we made today Lord Jesus and Lord we want to just be obedient unto you bless this day Lord bless this evening Lord and may you take full control of it Lord move me Plumb out the way Lord may you just have your way Jesus Christ's name we pray amen well I counted an honor a privilege to be with my brothers and sisters in Christ again I just kind of an honor privilege to be here and uh we'll just open up in a word in Isaiah 28 verse 12. amen agree anybody on live stream I agree to our pastor and his wife so Isaiah 28 and we'll start with verse 12 and go to 13. amen love to hear the Bible's turning amen well so reverse 12. to whom he said this is the rest wherewith he may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear but the word of the Lord was upon them precept upon precept upon precept line upon line upon line here little and they're little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken they'll go to verse 10. for precept must be upon precept upon precept line upon line upon line here little and they're little you may be seated so we look in verse 12 it's just talking about this rest that God has given us or he is to give us and we'll tie this little message yielded and resting and so the word yielded means to conceited allowed resigned and surrendered so when you're yielding you're you're giving up something you're giving up your life you're saying Lord here's my life and so we just see that in the plan of God in order for him to be manifested in our life for him to be powerful in our life we have to yield that's the only way that that power can be accessed if we're yielded to him right and we go to Matthew 11. Matthew 11 verses 28-30 very familiar scriptures we all heard them many times amen so Matthew 11 verses 28-30 so Jesus speaking here come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest so Jesus is offering offering us a rest to all of us not just because your name in so and so but he's offering this rest to everyone and but the thing is this rest requires something it says take my yoke upon you and learn of me so you have to that yolk you have to submit and let that the Lord put that yoke on and you have to take that yoke and put it on you yourself for I am meek and lowly in heart and you should find rest unto your souls so notice it's not talking about some natural rest like a vacation but it's a rest of your soul when everything's going wrong that that your soul is going to be anchored in the Haven of Rest so that's the type of rest that we need to have vacations are good they're wonderful but they're temporal but this rest he's talking about is going to give you rest deep down in here that no other person can give you not your wife not your best friend not not not whoever but only this rest can come from Jesus verse 30 for my yoke is easy and my burden is light so uh it's this song you guys might have heard of it I'll just read the lyrics I I just love I love this song too as well says the more that I Surrender the lighter my load the more that I release my cares the more you take control it says the more that I can humble myself the more you lift me up and every day I live Lord I love you more and the problems I had one yesterday are my Stepping Stones to a higher place the trials that seemed so awesome to me are now patterns of Victory I know I'm headed to my future home and the voice I hear is yours alone every day that I live Lord I love you more and it gets easier to understand the road I'm traveling no more wavering or wandering I'm standing on Solid Ground And I know I'm headed to my future home and the voice I hear is years alone every day I live Lord I love you more so just to think about that that statement the more that you surrender the lighter becomes your load so it's this rest that Jesus is trying to give us see we try to Bear all these things ourself but God did not intend us to Bear all these things ourself he intended for us to ask for him for help for strength but we have to be willing to swallow our pride and re and and say that we don't have everything figured out because if we did we wouldn't be here we wouldn't need Faith but the reason why we're here today is because we know that the God we serve everything we have is because of him without him we have nothing so that's why we're here today by his grace out so we said Jesus is offering us or he's offering everybody this rest no matter if you're serving him or not there's so many people who are struggling uh in this world with addictions and all these other things and they're the very answer is right in front of them is Jesus Christ but they're not willing to submit to him to receive that rest so amen so let's go to Hebrews 4 very familiar scripture so this this rest that we're just going to talking about in Hebrews 4 is a rest that will stand the test of time a rest that will carry you through a rest that requires a trust a rest that can detain obtained by all of us we just have to trust him with all our heart and we must notice that this rest is only available through submission that's the only way you can obtain this rest you can't read uh encyclopedias you can't can't do all these things to do it but it's something you have to submit into and so in verse 4 or sorry verse one so let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you that seem to come short of it For unto us was the Gospel preached as well unto them but the word priest should not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so they heard the word of God but their faith couldn't grab a hold of it see it went out one ear and out the other because they couldn't claim it personally for themselves and look what Paul is trying to warn usir the same thing can happen to us if we don't take God by his word if we don't put Faith in the equation because Faith as brother John said is the the vehicle that moves you closer to God and we got to get in that vehicle of faith and write in it and just take God in his word no matter where he leads you follow him amen verse 3 for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said I have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world verse 4 for he spake in a certain place in the seventh day on this wise and that and God did rest the seventh day from all his works for he's uh in in this place again that they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first priest and are not in because of unbelief so we see God is looking for a believer that will grab a hold of him by faith and see they saw the mighty workings of God they saw the the plagues and all these other things the water come out of rock those the water become bitter into sweet they saw these things but faith never took a hold but we see Joshua and Caleb their faith took a hold and they could enter into that rest that Promised Land which is the type of the Holy Ghost and the rest that is talking about is not some keeping of a day but it's the Holy Ghost is your rest you're resting in the Holy Ghost that's what the prophet taught us that's what the word of God taught us he taught it he taught us in the word of God the prophet did and verse 7 again he limits a certain day saying in David today after so a long time as it is said today if a conditional statement ye will hear him hear his voice Harden not your hearts so it's something that is personal God is speaking we said in the men's meeting if you're not in the right atmosphere the right heart condition You're Gonna Miss what God is saying to to tell you and we never want to come to church with a uh a pitchfork we want to rake it all in saying Lord this is all for me I need all this word I don't want to pick and choose what I want like a buffet but Lord I want everything on my plate just keep feeding me fill me to my cup is overflowing verse 9. therefore remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God and I believe I'm ministering to all the people of God here so there remaineth therefore a rest to all of us we can all can access this this rest and we're going to see how to access this rest in verse 11. let's read verse 10 first for he that is entered into his rest he hath also ceased from his own works as God did from his so you're no longer trying to figure everything out you're no longer trying to to plan your life in a selfish way but now you're looking to the mighty Creator and say Lord is this your will Lord where do you want me to go where are you trying to lead me to because Lord I want what's pleasing to you says let us labor therefore to enter into that rest so in order for you to labor you first have to surrender because if you're not surrendered you're not going to be able to labor into that rest because when you're surrendered you're fully committed you're fully sold out to the cause of Christ and we are fully sold out to the cause of Christ you know that you're laboring into that rest prayer is that key so let us labor therefore into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief amen let me go to verse 12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and in the joints in Maryland is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that is not manifesting in sight but all things are naked and open into the eyes of him with whom we have to do so we see the importance of this rest is something you got to labor to in every day that's something that you could just uh write the coattails of last week but it's something that you have to labor into you have to get in your knees you have to crucify the flesh this way he's talking about what laboring he said let us labor present tense not this past but labor therefore to enter into that rest and I know times we can get weary we can get broken down we need to rest God has everything under control the battle is not yours is his you must just play your part play the part that God has given each one of us to play and that worry can vanish that doubt can vanish this trust that he's beginning a good work in you he'll finish that good work you just had to keep that that uh keep it steadfast and put it right here it says in uh Hebrews three you know I'll just read in Hebrews three real fast give me one second so you gotta hold the beginning if we made partakers of Christ if conditional statement once again we hold the beginning of our con confidence steadfast and to the end and that's the key with all God is looking for right there let's get into a quote before we continue on that's where the church has come it's come through Martin Luther the just shall live by faith Wesley communion sanctification cleansing up and now we're in the baptism of the Holy Ghost rest I will give you rest unto your soul when a man went to the Intervale the second Veil he was hid from the world the curtains dropped around him and when we I love this and when we can loosen ourselves in Jesus Christ don't care what your denomination is then things don't bother you anymore you're just lost in Christ don't care what the howling mobs around say you're lost in Christ we can say we don't care what the news says we don't care what our family members or an occult says we don't care what they say because we're lost we got we're lost in Christ we've gave our life to Christ and we keep giving our life to Christ amen there's where the Shekinah Glory where the light that Halo that little ball of fire that come in behind the Altar and went down and settled in The Mercy Seat where the blood was and there it lit up the room that was from the power of decision 1955 and we'll go read another quote come on to me all you that labor and heavy laid and I will give you rest to your souls if you labored one day ten days five years 30 years 50 years 90 years and you're tired and weary come on to me and I'll give you rest I'll take all that load of sin off of you and enter into you and give you perfect rest and satisfaction notice that he said that statement perfect rest this rest cannot fail this rest has stand the time through every Church age all seven of them it stand it's withstood the time this rest and you'll be satisfied you won't be yearning and wanting for things in the world because all you have need is Jesus Christ he's that that complete in your heart amen when Jesus now what is that rest we let's just settle this a bit and see what it is some of them said why you go join Church no you put your name on the book no well a certain kind of water baptism no let's just sell it and see what it is would you would you like to do that right here while we're waiting we'll see John went over uh to see what kind of day he went into when Jesus died upon the Earth and his work was finished he'd entered somewhere so we think about that that it's not about joining the church it's not about how how good of a you know this word but it's about knowing the author because we know the author you can enter into that rest it's about knowing him more than you did in an intimate way you did last week that's what God is calling us all too and so I'll look the word resting is a lot of times we like to kind of get that word when he says rest it's not you just laying down on the couch just relaxing you're still going through trials you're going to tribulations but you're anchored and you're not letting those things affect you your mind is focused and say Lord I know these trials are here for a reason and I'm focused I'm keeping my eyes on you because there's growth and potential that you have for me to reach and I want to reach it in the time that you've allowed me to reach it I don't want to have to go around the mountain again but I want to keep moving forward I want to keep gaining levels with you each day each week and that's the kind of attitude we need to have so resting is ceasing to move or act ceasing to be moved or agitated think about that leaning standing depending or relying so when you're resting you're literally you're depending upon God you're resting on God because he's proven time and time again that he's come through he can't fail you and so just like with David and Goliath we talked about last time he knew what what God did for him with the bear in The Line in that same giant was going to meet the same fate as that bear in The Lion and so we got to believe and sometimes we gotta just look back and see what God has done for us the places that we said last week where he's taken us from and if God could do that there's nothing impossible for him to do in your life so there's a Red Sea speaking move forward you want to cry to speak and move forward the words inside of you amen amen so I was uh I was listening to his Minister one time name is Joseph Prince and he said this statement he said the only the only labor he tells us to labor into is his rest think about that and he says when when you work I rest when you rest I work so when we're trying to get everything all figured out we got to know this is going to happen this way and that way and that way in that way God's like all right I guess you got to handle but when we get out of that state of mind and say Lord I don't know which way I need to go but you do and we start entering to that rest then God can begin working in your life see like we like to have our hands all over everything on the steering wheel and God's saying let me be the driver of your ship the driver of your car so I can lead your life the way it needs to go and I I was just thinking he said this other statement he's talking about Jesus was so busy he said no person has done as much as Jesus did in his three and a half years of ministry but it says he was so busy but he still following time to rest Jesus still following time to pray think about this people coming up to him asking to be here with him walking over here to jarius's daughter him doing this and doing that and doing that but still he found time to rest so if Jesus found time to rest being a very busy man then why can't we find time to enter into that rest Jesus was always at rest you never see him agitated or angry or going crazy but he was always resting he was always recharged and so we got to take note of our Lord and savior what he did he spent much time in prayer with the father so if he spent much time in prayer then we have to spend much time in prayer if we want to be rested as he was he says he said many more works shall we do because he went to the father amen let's go to Hebrews uh 4 and read verses 14 through 16. so start with verse 14. seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession so this profession isn't a intellectual profession it has to be a heart profession and profession and confession mean the same thing you got to profess it from the heart not just Professor from lip service or from what you know or from that what Mr Jones experienced but you have to experience that you have to profess him as your own personal great high priest and you have to have a revelation that he's passing to the heavens verse 15. for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted so Jesus knows what you're going through he was a man once like you and I was he felt temptation of women temptation of everything because it says all points it doesn't say just this one point so we serve a God who can relate to us personally we serve a God who walked on this Earth this has you and I walked he wore clothes he had to eat when he was hungry he had to rest when he was tired he had to do all these things that we had to do so we can relate to him so don't think that your situation is too big or too small for God to handle he can handle anything he he wants to fill your your sadness he wants to just hear your hearts cry he hears the tears when they fall on the ground that don't make us sound he loves you so stop trying to solve everything yourself just come to the great high priest that we can which can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin says verse 16 let us therefore come boldly and this boldness isn't like Lord you owe me something but it's saying lord it's by your marriage by your grace I can come to your throne I'm bowing before your feet Lord just help me I need your help I need your grace in this this time of need and that's why we got how we got to see it as this Jesus Christ that we serve isn't some God that lives in the past but in Hebrews 13 he's the same yesterday today and forever he just as he cared about the children of Israel how much he loved him he loves you too he wants to shed that love upon you he wants to shower you with blessings amen and he said this other statement Joseph Prince said he said when the pain comes the supply is already there think about that when the pain comes the supply is already there brother Brahm say this statement you have everything you have need of inside of you so we're looking out to here and out to there but instead of looking out to it look at the god inside of you he has everything that you need when there's pain he he has Supply it you need money on the table he can supply it you need Deliverance he can supply it you need direction in your life he can supply it you want more Holy Ghost he can supply it you want more Revelation he can supply it you want to see your family saved he can supply it you want to win a soul to Christ he can supply it so we got to stop looking everywhere outside of the word of God we got to look into the word of God look into prayer because your answer is going to lie there it has to that's what he said amen amen so so profession is an open declaration a public of all or acknowledgment of one's sentiments or belief as professions or friendship or sincerity a profession of Faith or religion and confession is the act of acknowledging profession amen read a quote from the prophet now if you accept now what he has done for the Youth in now he is Hebrews three one he would say Hebrews 4 he's the high priest of our confession notice that now anyone knows the scripture knows that a word is written profession but it's the same word translated confession now in other words he cannot save you by the merits of your prayer notice that he cannot save you by the marriage of your enthusiasm no matter how much you click your heels together or shout in the spirit or your good works he saves you by the merits of your faith and your confession notice that for if you will confess me before men him will I confess before my father and the Holy Angels and whatever listen close any Redemptive blessing that's written in the word notice that any Redemptive blessing it written the word is for you you got to claim it by faith Luke 7 50 says and he said to the woman thy faith have saved thee so just think about that this woman made it in her heart that if she got to Jesus she knew that she knew that she knew that she would be healed she didn't let every wrong thing that happened to her life it didn't hinder her faith she knew that if she met with she heard about Jesus and she knew if she met this Jesus personally that her blood supply would be her her uh her infirmity would be healed and so the same thing with us tonight if our faith can just reach that pinnacle then we can receive what we're what we have asked for amen and that's all God is looking forward to see our faith being yet to cultivate that faith that God has given you we all have faith but we have to cultivate it like we said before it's like a muscle if I work out once a month I'm gonna get once a month results but if I'm working out three days a week five days a week I'm gonna get results but with faith faith has to be worked out seven days a week because that muscle has to be has to grow and the more you can grow the more you could take God in his word it builds your faith you can look back and just see all the things that God has has done in your life it's a faith booster even hearing a testimony from somebody else's a faith booster and we gotta be asking God for testimonies in our life God should be moving our life every day we should have testimonies somehow of him changing our nature every day whether it's a little baby step or a big step but God should be moving in our life and if he's not we're not resting we're not laboring we're not fighting on our knees because it's a battle of Faith every day and how you fight the Battle Is On Your Knees that's how you fight your battles her faith this is from Sir is what we see Jesus her faith touched him in such a way until he turned around and looked over his audience to see who touched him think about that thy faith have saved thee he even called her daughter if you know and I forget gospel he called her daughter she had a blood issue do you believe that that scripture well if he's the same yesterday today and forever isn't he the same when he's operating in our flesh amen isn't that right now let your faith touch him and see what he does about it think about that let your faith touch him and see what he does about it he knows you you have all these needs let's go to Hebrews 3. amen and we'll read seven chapter seven or verse 7 through 19. wherefore as the Holy Ghost said today if ye will hear his voice once again conditional statement is if it's talking to a it's a personal level if you will hear his voice not if sister Anna here Voice or Brother Joseph but if you will hear his voice personally because they can't hear the voice for of God for you you have to hear the voice of God for yourself personally so remember verse 8 heart not your heart says in the provocation in the day of the Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me and proved me and saw my Works 40 years think about that wherefore I always grieve with that generation and said they do always err in their hearts and they have not known my ways so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest look what Paul's saying right here he's given us a warning he's he's trying to warn the church he's trying to warn the the bride of Christ take heed Brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God so he's given us a warning but exhort one another daily notice that we got to be exhorting one another daily we have to we live in such a Dark Age where the darkness the enemy of darkness is just trying to tear us down piece by piece and we got to encourage one we got to build one another we gotta just speak the word over one another pray for one another earnestly because the enemy is like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour amen lest any of you should be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin verse 14 we see that conditional statement once again if we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confident steadfast and to the end just like running a race if I'm running a say a mile race and I just give I I'm just I beat everybody the first lap but the last lap I'm trailing behind and I lost that that whole lap I won didn't do me any good because I didn't win anything so the same thing in our walk with Christ yeah if it's good to start off good but if you don't finish good what's the point you want to start off good you want to finish good and keep it that way because God isn't see a lot of times human beings we look at the accolades that we have I did this I did this back in the past in the past but Paul said forgetting those things are behind and pressing towards those things which are ahead so it's good to you know thank the Lord for passion accomplishment you can't live in the past the past is the past is done and you got to live in the now in the future because every decision you make now is going to determine your future outcome so it's so important that's why Paul is just really just trying to stir the inside with us just to really focus on this verse 15. well it said today if notice that you will hear his voice hard not your hearts as in the provocation for someone they had heard did provoke how be it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses verse 17 but whom if he was grieved 40 years was not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom he swear that they should not enter into rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief so they couldn't enter into that what Isaiah the weary should rest they couldn't enter into that rest because of unbelief so we got to believe that that rest is for us personally that Holy Ghost is for us brother Bernie said this statement in order for you to receive the holy egos you got to believe that the Holy Ghost is for you so you got to believe that that rest is for you and we need more Holy Ghost to keep in turn into that rest that rests position to stay there it's because I'm Mark Cosby but if that rest stays there because I'm laboring into it I'm fighting for that rest because the devil knows that if you're in that rest he's powerless so he's constantly trying to distract you constantly trying to get you to look behind but if we keep our eyes focused and labor into that rest then he's going to be powerless in our life yeah he's going to still try to do things but you're going to have the power of Christ residing around you and in you and that's what we need to fight this battle amen so I like the word labor so it means to work at to till to cultivate so we said before we gotta we gotta cultivate that Faith so when God speaks to us in a service a message uh reading the word of God we gotta take what we heard we gotta apply it to our lives and cultivate it amen so in order we said before in order to labor you must first surrender you have to fully commit yourself to Jesus Christ and we just see that the Holy Ghost says that rest and that's why it's so important for us to get more Holy Ghost the more of God we can get the more rests we will have and say one more time the more of God we can get the more rest we will have the more we can fulfill his will the more we can build together the more we can witness the souls the more we can uh you fill in the blank it's Limitless amen amen so in order for us to enter to that rest we're going to go to Matthew 7. uh Matthew 7 13-14 we said we must labor we must play our part and we must strive to enter in so we got to strive to keep in that straight and narrow that's the key so Matthew 7 and read verses 13-14 and then we'll hop to Matthew 6. so it says enter ye and at the Straight Gate once again personal so enter ye at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there be which going there at so it's the scripture is telling me that this straight and narrow gate is hard to enter into and actually it's saying that more people are going to choose to go to the wide gate because it's easy it's appealing to the flesh it makes you feel good so is look at verse verse 14 says because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which Leath unto life and few there be that find it if you want to labor to find if you want to labor to see some people might start off on the Straight Gate but then go off so you gotta be willing to take the reproach you'll be willing to take the persecutions because the Christian life isn't an easy life it's a hard rugged life for a reason it was a lot easier probably living in a world like brother Ferguson said but when we come to God that's when the devil puts a Target on your back because because he you he's been you've been taken away from his kingdom and in the God's kingdom now and he thought that you were his property but he didn't realize that you were God's Property this whole time that's why he's constantly trying to deter us so because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leads unto life few there be that find it and the straight and narrows only room for you and Jesus that's the only two people could be in that road together amen let's go to Matthew 6. so as I was as I was studying this subject I I didn't realize I love this how the Lord this the scriptures is dovetailed together I was looking at Matthew 11 Isaiah 28 Hebrews 4. they all dovetailed together they're all talking about the same rest and I was just like I was like thank you Jesus and just when the Lord just opens the scriptures up like that because the scripture is all a dovetail they have to it's the word of God but I just love when he opens it up to us and to see that that same rest that Jesus was talking about in Matthew 11 Paul was talking about the same rest that Jesus was talking about and the same rest that Isaiah was talking about was the same rest that Jesus was talking about said all the dovetails together so if you're weary come labor to that rest amen let's go let's go to um Matthew 6 25. therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you should put on it's not the life more than the meat and the body than the remnant behold the fowls of the air for they so not need to do they reap nor gather into barns get your heavenly father feedeth him are ye not much better than they which of You by taking thought can add one cubit to a stature and why take you thought from Remnant consider the lilies of the field how they grow and they toil not neither do they spin and think about the statement Jesus said right here in 29 yet I say unto you that even Solomon and All His glory was not arrayed like one of these that's a powerful statement we think of Solomon a man a man of God but he's saying Jesus said and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not a raid like one of these I mean I said so profound verse 30 wherefore if God so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you you little faith therefore take no thoughts saying what we shall eat or what shall we drink or worry shall be clothed how I'm going to pay this bill how I'm gonna get a brand new car uh I need a place to live uh whatever you fill in the blank therefore take no thoughts saying that for after all these things to the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things that statement we said when when the pain is there when the need's there the supply is already there we just got to believe that the supplies already there in verse I love I list my favorite probably scriptures 6 33. but seek ye first the kingdom of God labor into that rest that's what it's telling me labor into that rest because when you're seeking the kingdom of God you're laboring you're saying Lord I'm putting your will first I'm putting you first in my life and Lord you promise to take care of all these needs all I have to do is seek you seek your face seek your heart seek your will that's all I have to do you told me to love you with all my heart all my mind all my soul that's all you're calling me to do and Lord I want to love you more each day I want to fall so deep and madly in love with you that everything around me this that's a distraction this Fades away but seek ye first the kingdom of God labor into that rest his labor and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you man this this study and I love the Lord this studying this I deceived Matthew 6 in a new light now like I've never seen it before Jesus said all these things that we can worry about then then Jesus saying come unto me oh that header lady and I'll give you rest in Paul saying labor into that rest that's all God is telling us to do is play our part labor labor to enter and labor to that rest verse 34 take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself deficient to the day is the evil thereof so we must just see the importance of faith it says in Hebrews 4 2 for unto us was the Gospel preached as well unto them but the word priest did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it brother Johnson brother John quote brother John he said if you don't exercise faith it will shrink exercise the faith God has given you we said before faith is the vehicle faith is the vehicle we use to move forward with God see the the battle that we have to fight is the battle for faith we have to fight to enter into that rest it's not something that just falls into your lap send a Christmas present it's not a birthday present you have to fight every day for because the devil hates to see a Christian resting because when a Christian is resting he can't torment them but when a Christian is resting he is powerless he can do what he wants to do but that Christian's focused on Jesus Christ his eyes Can't Be Moved it's like a horse with blinders I'm talking about the men's meaning how a horse they put blinders on so the horse can't look left to right and see straight and we got to put our spiritual blinders on so we're not looking over here and over there but we're looking just straight to Christ because he's the reason why we're here amen you have to believe that like I said you got to claim that rest for your life disclaim it and that you can obtain that rest you have to believe that you don't have to live this life alone that there's a lord and savior that loves you with all his heart and wants to help you he wants to strengthen you he wants to be he wants you to be an overcomer he wants to see you prosper spiritually and physically see he wants to shower us with blessings but a lot of times we're just looking for these natural blessings and God is looking for the soul prospering blessings and that's what true prospering is just because some person has a nice car and a fancy house doesn't mean he's any closer to God than the next person in the world so what truly is going to just mean that you're prospering is your soul prospering is your nature prospering are you are you able to love people without uh without a measure because Jesus told us that we got to love one another we gotta love our enemies and that's what true progression means to me it's a love of God just being shed abroad in our hearts more and more and more and more that we can love one another that love of God we can love when somebody just stabs Us in the back we can bless in that curse so we can pray for them that despitefully used us that's the only love of God can accomplish that so we just see Jeremiah 29 11 I'm just going to read it for I know the thoughts that I think toward you say the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end so the Lord just thinks thoughts of Peace for us and we got to just believe that no matter how hard it is in our life right now that peace is going to be at the end of that tunnel that Victory is going to be into that tunnel you just got to keep strong keep marching forward with the light he's giving you just keep believing it keep trusting it keep speaking victory over it keep speaking the name of Jesus in your situation and you will overcome I don't know how many ever heard that song I I speak I want to speak the name of Jesus so I I love this song too because it's just sometimes we just we just got to speak the name of Jesus I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and every mind because I know there's peace within your presence I speak Jesus I just want to speak the name of Jesus to every dark addiction starts to break declaring there is hope and there is freedom I speak Jesus he says because your name is power your name is healing your name is life like I love this too break every stronghold shine through the Shadows burn like a flower fire shout Jesus from the mountains Jesus in the streets Jesus in the darkness over every enemy Jesus for my family I speak the Holy Name of Jesus think about that statement I just the name of Jesus not even a demon can handle that name of Jesus when when Jesus walked towards Legion he said all you come to tone with me already this when Jesus is on the scene there's no darkness that can stay it'll fade away every time amen a couple quotes we're almost done did you ever meet a person that's been in there this is from why are people so tossed about 1956 January 1st did you ever meet a person that's been in there and has tasted and living on this manna you can meet him on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday cloudy day Bright Day gloomy day things are going right wrong he's always sweet always full of love never talked or do anything wrong he's living under the glory of God he never gets hungry he never has to go to church to get built up Now that statement he's saying see a lot of times we go for we go to church because we're all beaten down and wearing like oh man I barely made it in I need this but if we would just be desperate not just on Wednesdays and Sundays but seven days a week when we come to church we wouldn't it wouldn't have to just build us up here but we'll be getting built up everywhere we go we can be on fire in church brother Bram said this statement if you can get two or three good members that are on fire for God in the church it will do more than 40 revivals could do think about that there's two or three members on fire for God that they're every time they come to church they're bringing the presence of God they're bringing the fire of God and a forest fire is contagious it spreads and so that's what he that's what he's trying to say you have to go to church to get built up a lot of times we just bring all our problems we're just like oh man I barely made it one more quote but as it come here if it is then your whole makeup is Christ your attitude your desires your appetite your everything is Christ yielded resting everything perfect no matter how dough it looks or how black it looks still it's the same Christ is in you so this in closing the rise to our feet this labor has been given to all of us this rest has been given to all of us are you willing to labor into that rest where you don't have to do everything yourself anymore let go and let God have his way think about that song let go and let God have his way he knows the problems you're going to face he knows the issues the roadblocks are going to happen don't it's not a surprise to him he's just waiting for his son or his daughter to say Lord help me I can't do this anymore myself I've tried your grace is sufficient when I'm weak your power is strong it becomes magnified in my life who's saying let go and let God have his way yeah let go let God have his wonderful way let go and let God have his ways foreign your Sorrows will vanish your night turn today let go and let God have his way let go and let God have his wonderful way let go and let God have his way your Sorrows will vanish your night turn today let go and let God have his way one more time let go and let God have his wonderful way let go and let God have his way your Sorrows will vanish your night turn today let go and let God
