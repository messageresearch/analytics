[38:04] a heart that we want to manifest you and
[38:08] uh when
[38:10] there's the great need of of well all
[38:14] times but Lord but especially when
[38:16] there's problems in a church we want to
[38:19] be able to to to handle them exactly the
[38:22] way that you would handle them and Lord
[38:24] we need you for this Lord we need the
[38:27] Holy Spirit and we pray that you would
[38:29] break the word to us and that you would
[38:32] increase the desire in our heart uh to
[38:35] be more like you and to to to be Christ
[38:39] one to another and just to help one
[38:41] another father we commit the service
[38:43] into your hands and we're trust in you
[38:46] that you give us spiritual ears to hear
[38:48] what you're saying to us Lord we give
[38:51] you the praise now for we ask it in
[38:52] Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless
[38:55] you may be seated
[38:58] seated today we want to talk or get into
[39:01] we'll might do a couple services in this
[39:03] but examples of functioning healthy
[39:08] healthy um functioning as a healthy body
[39:13] requires the most important thing which
[39:16] is the character of God Amen the Bible
[39:19] tells us that Christ wants preeminence
[39:22] in the church that's right so if he has
[39:25] preeminence
[39:27] things are going to work out right um
[39:30] but if he doesn't have preeminence then
[39:32] we're there to deal with
[39:34] stuff brother brandom said that
[39:38] character was important and he said in
[39:40] the choosing of the Bride he said God is
[39:42] looking for character when he chooses
[39:44] his bride Amen in another place he said
[39:47] it's the only thing we're taking with us
[39:49] amen is character so character is not a
[39:51] badge you get after you go through 18
[39:54] years of school and you got diploma
[39:57] it's really The Life of Christ Living
[39:59] inside amen oh we've all been to a
[40:03] wedding
[40:06] before and uh those of you those of you
[40:10] wives ladies who have been
[40:13] married uh have
[40:15] experienced that when it comes to a
[40:18] wedding that all the attention is on the
[40:20] bride amen the whole thing even the
[40:23] groom's not allowed to see the bride in
[40:25] the wedding dress right and so there's
[40:27] this great
[40:30] preparation the man is standing at the
[40:33] platform the groom getting ready to get
[40:35] married everybody's just sitting down
[40:39] and but when the bride walks in
[40:41] everybody has to stand up and give honor
[40:43] to the bride amen there's such an honor
[40:46] everything is placed everybody's looking
[40:48] at the bride they're not looking at the
[40:51] groom now I tell you where there's
[40:54] coming a time where all creation is
[40:57] groaning looking who is going to who did
[41:00] the who did Jesus Christ choose to be
[41:03] the bride amen and looking at her beauty
[41:06] and truly the the beauty of the church
[41:09] is the character of Christ amen so this
[41:13] is what we need to function as a healthy
[41:16] church
[41:19] amen now character is seen in how we act
[41:23] and how we worship and how we pray but
[41:25] it really the deepness of character is
[41:28] manifested in how we react in our
[41:31] hardest trials amen we know character is
[41:35] built in the fiery furnace of Trials
[41:38] amen that's right Bible or brother bam
[41:41] taught us that God is hid in Simplicity
[41:43] but he's also reveals himself in
[41:46] Simplicity now I believe uh our
[41:50] character is developed in Trials but is
[41:54] also revealed in trials amen you put a
[41:57] tea bag in hot water and you see what
[41:58] kind of what's really in the tea bag cuz
[42:01] you line up 20 tea bags they all look
[42:03] the
[42:04] same same size they all look the same
[42:07] but you put them in hot water you see
[42:08] how they react and then you know what
[42:10] they are
[42:13] amen take a look at job job was a
[42:17] perfect
[42:20] man and uh he had character he he prayed
[42:25] he made
[42:27] sacrifices for the sins even of his own
[42:29] children amen and and God looked at job
[42:33] and says you considered my servant job
[42:35] he's perfect there's none like him in
[42:37] all the world and you know and Satan
[42:40] didn't say oh wow yeah he sure is I can
[42:42] tell it's not what he said he said oh
[42:45] he's just that way he just coming to
[42:48] church and paying his ties so he can get
[42:50] whatever he can get from
[42:52] you he says but if you just put him
[42:55] through the test
[42:56] take everything away we'll find out if
[42:59] he's just still going to have that that
[43:01] Integrity for you amen see even Satan
[43:05] himself could identify what true
[43:08] character Christ
[43:10] was that when everything's taken away
[43:13] you're still staying true to God Amen
[43:16] you notice he never gave an offense even
[43:18] to those that accused him of
[43:20] sin because that's what the character of
[43:23] Christ is and that's what is needed in a
[43:24] church to take care of BS now understand
[43:26] in every Church there's three types of
[43:28] Believers amen and we always believe
[43:31] that the the the mate Believers and the
[43:32] unbelievers don't ever come that's what
[43:34] we
[43:36] believe but in in reality everybody is
[43:40] not going to have the character of
[43:41] Christ in a
[43:44] church and it's
[43:46] okay but if the bride has it yes she'll
[43:50] take care of the problems amen you
[43:53] understand what I'm saying if the bride
[43:55] has it she knows how to take care of the
[43:57] problems because she's been equipped
[44:00] with the character of Christ just like
[44:01] how Christ takes care of
[44:04] problems we take a look at Abraham even
[44:08] at the
[44:09] end it wasn't until the end when God
[44:12] said now I know you love me see it was
[44:16] at the hardest trial the deepest
[44:19] trial
[44:21] where he had to give up the very thing
[44:24] that God promised him
[44:26] and that's where character was really
[44:28] shown he didn't quit didn't stop didn't
[44:33] call God a liar didn't throw in the
[44:34] towel and say ain't worth it he howed to
[44:38] his character amen he howed to God's
[44:43] word Now The Church Must develop the
[44:46] character of Christ amen she must grow
[44:49] up in unto him in all things which is
[44:53] the head even Christ that's what the our
[44:56] our our scripture is we' we've got to
[44:59] grow up we've got to get the character
[45:01] now we can't just sit around and keep
[45:03] complaining because somebody else isn't
[45:05] doing their
[45:07] job amen amen now this is this is a
[45:10] great service for our homes and our
[45:12] marriages too our families it's not just
[45:15] for the church but you'll see too often
[45:18] we can function as an unhealthy
[45:21] body brother Braham did say the body of
[45:23] Christ was the sickest body he knew of
[45:25] Amen
[45:26] we have the tendency of handling
[45:28] situations in our
[45:30] flesh either we have an attitude of I'm
[45:33] going to straighten them out or we just
[45:35] have an attitude of ignoring the
[45:36] situation all
[45:38] together and both of
[45:41] those is in the
[45:44] flesh Believers can can have a form of
[45:47] godliness but they don't want to wash
[45:50] people's
[45:51] feet they don't want to feel for others
[45:54] enough they don't want to carry burdens
[45:56] they don't want to be a committed
[45:57] Christian to the to the body of
[46:00] Christ see there are people that come to
[46:02] church and they're they're they're
[46:06] committed to the church they're
[46:08] committed to the body of Christ in the
[46:10] church and then there are others who
[46:11] come to church who are just associated
[46:13] with the church they go to the church or
[46:16] oh this is where we go they they're not
[46:18] they're not committed to faithfulness
[46:19] they're not committed to a lot of things
[46:21] they're just
[46:23] Associates not everybody that goes is is
[46:26] committed but when it comes to being the
[46:29] Bride of Jesus Christ we've got to be
[46:31] committed to his
[46:34] body now if we're going to
[46:36] function better as a healthy church then
[46:38] we're going to have to get more of the
[46:41] love of
[46:42] God that's it that's where it all stems
[46:44] from the love of
[46:46] God we have to learn to speak the truth
[46:48] in love we have to put into practice
[46:50] supplying the needs to one another now
[46:53] I'm counting on each and every every one
[46:56] of you to do your part to help us
[46:59] because you're a part of the church
[47:03] amen take time to say Lord what would
[47:05] you have me to
[47:06] do God has placed you here for a purpose
[47:09] amen I believe it's to edify those that
[47:12] are around you to in the love of God
[47:15] wherever you go God wants you to Shine
[47:17] the Light why not Shine the Light here
[47:19] amen come on why not be Christ here be
[47:22] an example to the Believers don't
[47:24] despise your youth just you know get
[47:27] serious about this about being all of
[47:30] Christ you know too often we come to
[47:31] church all for ourselves and not to just
[47:33] be what Christ wants us to
[47:36] be God wants us to make an increase to
[47:38] the body the Bible says said in the
[47:41] message influences 63 says oh if we in
[47:45] the church as the members of the body of
[47:47] Christ could only work in harmony like
[47:50] that you would see a great Mighty Church
[47:53] of the Living God all in one array
[47:55] filled with with the Holy Spirit
[47:56] wouldn't it be wonderful every member of
[47:58] the body functioning just exactly to its
[48:03] place every gift to its place every gift
[48:06] helping the other every member helping
[48:09] the other that would be wonderful that
[48:11] what we want to
[48:18] see how do I know that I love God
[48:23] enough that's important
[48:27] how do I know I got
[48:29] character because I say I
[48:33] do to become the church that God wants
[48:36] us to be we need to learn to recognize
[48:39] the
[48:40] enemy not just in others because we're
[48:43] pretty good at that but we need to learn
[48:46] to recognize the enemy in our own
[48:49] minds Satan is the accuser of the
[48:52] Brethren and we know the devil can't do
[48:54] anything to any one of
[48:57] us he can't do anything unless he got a
[48:59] vessel to work
[49:01] through and think about all the times
[49:03] the devil has used you to accuse
[49:07] somebody just look at how many times you
[49:09] had to say sorry to the Lord
[49:12] amen we that's the evidence that we
[49:15] don't recognize the enemy
[49:20] enough so how
[49:23] does how does the devil trick
[49:27] us the devil camouflages himself with a
[49:31] false
[49:33] light what does that mean brother
[49:37] John it's a light but it's not pure
[49:44] light it's light but it has a little
[49:48] darkness in it you've seen bulbs that
[49:51] just kind of get dimmer and dimmer and
[49:53] dimmer well even like a a dim dimmer
[49:56] switch right the light's still
[49:59] on but it's not pure light amen and and
[50:03] this is how the devil tricks a lot of Us
[50:05] 2 Corinthians 11:13 says for such are
[50:08] false Apostles deceitful workers
[50:10] transforming themselves into the
[50:12] Apostles of Christ in other words
[50:13] they're just acting like an apostle amen
[50:17] and and don't Marvel there's people like
[50:19] that out the world for Satan himself is
[50:21] transformed into an angel of Light
[50:23] therefore there's no great thing of his
[50:25] ministers be transformed into
[50:28] transformed as Ministers of
[50:31] righteousness whose end shall be
[50:34] according to their works the devil has
[50:37] the ability to trick us and hide himself
[50:42] when he's speaking right to
[50:45] us he uses a bit of truth that's the
[50:48] problem brother BR said in the message
[50:51] the Harvest time he says notice speaking
[50:53] of the the false Church said she had
[50:57] power but it was false power she took
[51:00] part of the world word and didn't take
[51:03] the rest of it right he said what is the
[51:06] biggest lie that was ever told he said
[51:09] it's got 99% truth in it amen wow I
[51:13] would think it would be the one that had
[51:16] 0.1% in it and the rest was a lie no but
[51:20] the greater the light with a little
[51:22] deception is the greatest lie
[51:27] amen the devil camouflages in everything
[51:31] he uses everything you name it he'll use
[51:34] it the more busier are in life the more
[51:37] distractions you get the better chance
[51:39] you're going to get tricked
[51:41] amen he'll camouflage himself in
[51:44] problems he'll camouflage himself in
[51:46] your desires the things that are right
[51:49] the things that are wrong he'll he'll
[51:51] camouflage himself in the cares of Life
[51:54] the devil doesn't always use the same
[51:56] thing over and over he mixes it
[52:02] up brother Peter brother Peter in 1
[52:05] Peter 5'8 he says you know this you
[52:07] don't have to turn there be sober be
[52:09] vigilant because your adversary of the
[52:10] devil as a Roy L walketh about seeking
[52:13] whom he may
[52:15] devour whom resist deadfast in the face
[52:18] you got to recognize him to to resist
[52:20] them knowing that the same afflictions
[52:22] are accomplished in your brethren that
[52:24] are in the world
[52:25] so here the devil is walking around
[52:29] mixed in so many things camouflaging
[52:32] himself and his goal is to devour you
[52:36] yes that's right amen so if we're
[52:39] walking in our carnality and our flesh
[52:41] we're not going to recognize his
[52:44] approach we've got to walk in the spirit
[52:46] right
[52:47] amen Paul said to the Galatians this I
[52:49] say then walk in the spirit and you
[52:52] shall not fulfill the lust of can you
[52:55] what a what a promise right Galatians
[52:57] 5:116 this I say then walk in the spirit
[53:01] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[53:03] the flesh but you understand walking in
[53:06] the spirit is not a gift when you wake
[53:08] up and you say oh God doesn't mean
[53:10] you're walking in the
[53:12] spirit you've got to crucify the old man
[53:15] amen you've got to say I'm done with
[53:18] this carnal thoughts and trying to
[53:19] figure it out and doing it my way God I
[53:22] want you and only you amen
[53:25] for the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[53:28] and the spirit against the Flesh and
[53:29] these are contrary one to another so
[53:31] that you cannot do the things that you
[53:34] would our adversary the devil is walking
[53:37] about seeking whom he may devour
[53:42] right what does that mean you want to
[53:45] remember the devil's always seeking to
[53:48] get
[53:50] us to where God is
[53:54] Not he's trying to get us to do
[53:57] something we shouldn't
[53:59] do he's trying to get us to go somewhere
[54:02] we shouldn't go whether it's in our
[54:04] minds whether it's in our
[54:06] eyes whether it's driving doing he's
[54:10] always trying to get us to go somewhere
[54:13] that we shouldn't go
[54:17] amen now there are obvious things like a
[54:19] bar strip club robbing a bank looking at
[54:22] inappropriate things but there are also
[54:26] not so obvious
[54:28] things like a busy body in another man's
[54:31] business amen like esteeming our own
[54:34] self like looking after our own things
[54:37] only like proving we're
[54:40] right like building our own
[54:44] reputation like caught up in our own
[54:47] life living primarily for ourselves amen
[54:50] now there are many places the devil
[54:52] tempts us that we shouldn't go to
[54:55] he's seeking to devour us spiritually
[54:59] right he's trying to get us to a place
[55:01] where God is not God is not in those
[55:05] things not the nature of God so I want
[55:09] to just talk a lot about examples
[55:11] because I want I want you to be able to
[55:15] identify let's say we're walking in the
[55:17] flesh and somebody does something that
[55:21] we don't agree
[55:22] with this is a pretty typical example
[55:24] would you you say Amen now because
[55:27] you're in your flesh you're most you're
[55:29] you're lot less likely to catch the
[55:32] devil approaching you because your
[55:37] pride you know somebody does something
[55:40] that you don't approve of your pride is
[55:42] going to just automatically be the open
[55:44] door for the devil to come in into your
[55:49] mind the devil tells you that a person
[55:51] is wrong or you want to go straighten
[55:54] them out how often does the devil tell
[55:56] you
[56:01] that that's wrong I'm when I get the
[56:03] opportunity I'm going to tell
[56:07] them now if we think that won't work
[56:10] we'll simply be too
[56:12] afraid don't do
[56:17] nothing see we're tempted to either
[56:19] judge that person quietly in our
[56:22] heart or just totally ignore
[56:26] or we might be tempted to share our
[56:29] thoughts with another person in the
[56:30] church right
[56:32] amen I'll just share it with my with
[56:38] my look at that is not
[56:42] Christ it's the open door to start
[56:45] talking amen but that is not functioning
[56:48] as a healthy body that means you're just
[56:52] associate in the
[56:53] church
[56:55] get committed amen get committed to
[56:59] help but that means I got to get my
[57:01] hands dirty yes that's what it
[57:05] means I don't know if I want to do
[57:08] that but then you're actually saying I
[57:12] don't know if I want the character of
[57:14] Christ enough because that's what it
[57:16] takes we've got to develop that we've
[57:19] got
[57:20] to put our heart into becoming what
[57:24] we're not not I'm not taking away the
[57:26] character that we have I'm talking about
[57:29] what we're not possessing that's what we
[57:31] got to go after amen we're going to be
[57:33] healthier amen look I'm not taking away
[57:36] from the the carrots and the vegetables
[57:39] that you're eating and the the
[57:40] exercising that you're doing five
[57:42] minutes a
[57:44] week but maybe we need to do some more
[57:47] are you with
[57:51] me all right Satan's goal is to stir the
[57:56] pot of
[57:59] confusion just every evil work just Stir
[58:02] It Up he just he wants to start
[58:05] things he first starts them in our
[58:10] mind and that the devil has a way of
[58:12] just giving us a lot of
[58:14] imaginations and then we've been
[58:16] instructed by the Bible to cast him down
[58:19] right but sometimes we don't we end up
[58:21] talking about
[58:23] them sometimes we end up falsely
[58:26] accusing other
[58:29] people sometimes we we end up just I'm
[58:34] staying away from
[58:35] them tell me where is Christ in any of
[58:38] that
[58:40] right that's not
[58:42] healthy that means you're not Discerning
[58:46] that that there's another part of the
[58:47] body that isn't you amen that's what
[58:50] that is
[58:52] amen now when we're walking in the
[58:55] spirit we notice a person is wrong or he
[58:58] did something
[59:00] wrong I want you to know if you're
[59:03] walking in the spirit the first thing is
[59:05] your motive is pure God is not going to
[59:08] let you walk in the spirit if your
[59:10] motive is not
[59:13] pure your motive has to be
[59:17] pure Titus 115 says unto the pure all
[59:20] things are pure right but unto them that
[59:24] are def
[59:25] and unbelieving is nothing pure but even
[59:29] their mind and their conscience is
[59:31] defiled they profess that they know God
[59:34] but in their Works they deny him being
[59:36] disobedient and unto every good work a
[59:42] reparate now look if I'm going to be the
[59:45] bride my mind has to be pure I have to
[59:47] be pure at my motives have to be right
[59:50] Amen brother Brandon said it so many
[59:52] times check your motive check your
[59:53] objective you just can't
[59:56] be the last thing you want to do is
[59:58] paint a p a
[1:00:00] picture of Christianity on
[1:00:04] you trying to be a
[1:00:08] uh
[1:00:10] hypocritical you don't want to stick
[1:00:12] peacock feathers in just be genuine on
[1:00:15] the inside and God will lead you God
[1:00:18] will give you what you need too often we
[1:00:21] try to you know handle things carnally
[1:00:23] in the flesh
[1:00:25] because we think we're right and even if
[1:00:27] you're right the spirit's not
[1:00:30] right if a Believer is walking in the
[1:00:32] spirit their thoughts are pure because
[1:00:34] unto the pure all things are pure but if
[1:00:38] a person is walking into the flesh their
[1:00:40] thoughts are not going to be pure about
[1:00:44] others can you say Amen now look let's
[1:00:47] just get into the word let's say Amen
[1:00:49] because it's a true
[1:00:50] word it's a true word and we've all come
[1:00:53] short in our thoughts amen Amen brother
[1:00:55] says 100 times a day we backslide
[1:00:59] am it takes a pure motive to walk in the
[1:01:03] spirit of God they that worship me must
[1:01:05] worship me in spirit and truth I say if
[1:01:07] we're going to walk in the spirit our
[1:01:08] motives are pure and not what I'm I'm
[1:01:10] really pushing that because you can that
[1:01:13] gives you
[1:01:15] confidence if your motive is right you
[1:01:17] can have
[1:01:18] confidence your motive is pure your your
[1:01:21] confidence is there because greater is
[1:01:23] he that's in you than he that's in the
[1:01:25] world greater is he that's in you than
[1:01:28] he that's in the world so when we're
[1:01:30] walking in the spirit our motives pure
[1:01:32] our confidence is because Christ is on
[1:01:34] the inside and we notice a
[1:01:37] person is wrong or that he did something
[1:01:40] wrong what do we do our motive is purely
[1:01:45] to help
[1:01:46] them it's not mixed
[1:01:52] right we want to Bear the burden we want
[1:01:55] to fulfill the law of
[1:01:58] Christ and we have confidence to do that
[1:02:01] because of the Holy Ghost Inside of us
[1:02:03] is wanting to lead them into all
[1:02:07] truth now if this is not operating
[1:02:10] inside of us we just simply need more of
[1:02:12] the Holy Ghost that's right amen we need
[1:02:15] to get more we need to get serious about
[1:02:17] spending time because coming to church
[1:02:19] don't give you the Holy Ghost amen
[1:02:22] coming to church does not give you the
[1:02:24] Holy Ghost amen but when you hear the
[1:02:27] word and it's real to you then you'll go
[1:02:30] seek the Holy Ghost amen you'll start
[1:02:33] being obedient to the word of God that
[1:02:35] you're hearing and that will bring the
[1:02:37] Holy Ghost
[1:02:40] amen amen now when we're walking in the
[1:02:43] spirit we're walking in the love of
[1:02:46] God Amen it's powerful you'll lay down
[1:02:49] your life for your friend amen it'll
[1:02:52] break every stron stronghold amen it'll
[1:02:55] bear whatever it needs to
[1:02:57] Bear because it Bears all
[1:03:00] things and you need that in a church to
[1:03:03] be
[1:03:04] healthy everything ain't going to go you
[1:03:07] know really
[1:03:10] easy it can be
[1:03:12] difficult but you know what when you
[1:03:14] have the love of God you're willing to
[1:03:16] reach down your
[1:03:18] time and help
[1:03:20] somebody you're willing to get your
[1:03:23] hands
[1:03:25] dirty help somebody functioning as a
[1:03:28] healthy body requires spiritual
[1:03:30] Believers willing to
[1:03:33] overcome and to help others overcome
[1:03:36] amen you have to first overcome the
[1:03:38] thoughts in your own head right you have
[1:03:41] to overcome the devil here have to
[1:03:43] recognize the devil here before you can
[1:03:45] actually help somebody I'm not say you
[1:03:47] know you don't even got to be spiritual
[1:03:48] and you can see people's got
[1:03:52] faults hey before I was ever Christian I
[1:03:54] knew all the faults my dad had my
[1:03:56] brother had my friends had teachers
[1:04:01] had because the devil shows me but he
[1:04:04] doesn't give me the character to deal
[1:04:06] with it see but God does Amen the Holy
[1:04:09] Ghost does shows you those same problems
[1:04:12] and now you that love inside of you
[1:04:14] wants to help amen well brother John you
[1:04:17] just can't help
[1:04:20] everybody okay I'm going to say amen for
[1:04:23] a second to that
[1:04:26] statement but you'll still lay down your
[1:04:28] life for everybody amen right amen so
[1:04:33] instead of making that an excuse why
[1:04:35] don't we just start putting into
[1:04:36] practice to somebody else that you can't
[1:04:38] help right because you know Faith grows
[1:04:41] it's got to be exercised character is
[1:04:43] something that builds it'll never be
[1:04:45] handed to you just because you came to
[1:04:47] church amen just because you pay I'm
[1:04:50] telling you if you're not going through
[1:04:51] the furnace you're not getting character
[1:04:53] amen and I'm saying you got to go you
[1:04:56] got to make the right decisions when
[1:04:58] you're in the furnace
[1:05:00] F got to make the right decisions amen
[1:05:03] Galatians chapter 6 verse
[1:05:05] one Brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[1:05:13] fault ye which are spiritual restore
[1:05:17] such a one in the spirit of meekness
[1:05:22] considering thyself lest thou also so be
[1:05:26] tempted now not just anybody can go help
[1:05:28] anybody that's what that scripture is
[1:05:30] telling
[1:05:31] me true because a spiritual person his
[1:05:34] motive is to restore it's to
[1:05:36] help it's not to tell them the wrong
[1:05:39] it's not to tell them to stop doing it
[1:05:42] it's literally to help them it's to
[1:05:44] restore that word is
[1:05:46] restored and and then for those that are
[1:05:49] not really don't know what it means to
[1:05:51] be spiritual you've got to have a spirit
[1:05:53] of me
[1:05:59] neatness that's
[1:06:01] scripture amen and then it says
[1:06:03] considering thyself lest thou also be
[1:06:08] tempted well i' never do you know I'd
[1:06:10] never do what they did Brother John he
[1:06:12] not talking about
[1:06:16] that bear ye one another's burdens and
[1:06:18] so fulfill the law of Christ for if a
[1:06:20] man think himself to to be something
[1:06:23] when he's not nothing he deceiveth
[1:06:25] himself and I'll just say it like this a
[1:06:27] person that goes to try to restore
[1:06:28] somebody without the spirit of meekness
[1:06:30] is deceived yes he is absolutely
[1:06:38] deceived they don't realize that the
[1:06:40] devil could attack
[1:06:42] them if you're going to defeat the Devil
[1:06:45] with a wrong Spirit if you think you're
[1:06:47] going to defeat the Devil with the wrong
[1:06:49] Spirit you're
[1:06:51] deceived because there's when it comes
[1:06:53] to evil there's nothing greater than a
[1:06:57] devil and Humanity or human wisdom or
[1:07:00] human intellect or or humanness doesn't
[1:07:03] defeat the Devil you need the power of
[1:07:06] the Holy Ghost amen and there's
[1:07:08] something that comes with a spirit of
[1:07:11] meekness yes there's power there's power
[1:07:14] in a spirit of
[1:07:15] meekness the world may look at it as all
[1:07:19] it's just a pushover
[1:07:21] right so I'll say first first check your
[1:07:26] motive are you just trying to correct
[1:07:29] somebody or do you love this person
[1:07:32] enough to lay down your life to help
[1:07:34] them are you willing to give your time
[1:07:36] are you willing to lay down your pride
[1:07:38] and see this person through through what
[1:07:41] through the process of restoration and
[1:07:43] it could take a long process right you
[1:07:46] know we sing that song Sometimes God's
[1:07:48] still working on me it's a process
[1:07:52] am
[1:07:54] how many times you as parents your kids
[1:07:57] were just acting up and you just said oh
[1:08:01] you just shut
[1:08:02] up would you just stop would you just
[1:08:05] quck would you just give your dad and
[1:08:07] mom a break would you just go to your
[1:08:11] room
[1:08:14] right do you ever ever imagine
[1:08:18] God acting like that toward
[1:08:22] you yeah you see so we need the power
[1:08:26] that comes from having the right spirit
[1:08:28] amen can't get the power to handle
[1:08:30] things right if you got the wrong spirit
[1:08:33] amen so if we don't have the spirit of
[1:08:36] meekness when we're trying to help
[1:08:38] someone we're a target for the
[1:08:41] devil if you can't you're going to go in
[1:08:44] and you're going to convince somebody of
[1:08:46] something if you don't have the right
[1:08:48] Spirit if you don't convince them if you
[1:08:50] don't least get them to a place
[1:08:57] as brother brand says we may not see eye
[1:08:59] to eye but we should be about to see
[1:09:00] Heart to Heart
[1:09:02] yes if we don't get to that place you
[1:09:05] just go in there and you attack somebody
[1:09:07] because you know they're wrong I'm
[1:09:08] telling you that Spirit on them is going
[1:09:10] to attack
[1:09:13] you it's going
[1:09:17] to when you try to expose an evil spirit
[1:09:20] on somebody and they that Spirit don't
[1:09:23] want to be
[1:09:24] exposed it'll attack it'll attack you
[1:09:27] it'll try to attack you no we we we've
[1:09:30] read stories of you know brother brandom
[1:09:32] when he would uh pray over somebody and
[1:09:35] and and uh that that Spirit would just
[1:09:38] kind of try to come out and we see that
[1:09:42] in the in the Bible when people are
[1:09:43] possessed with the devil but listen
[1:09:47] people can
[1:09:48] be uh oppressed with evil spirits on
[1:09:52] them and those spirits will try to
[1:09:54] attack you when you when if you don't
[1:09:57] have the power of the Holy Ghost in your
[1:10:00] life you that try to correct your
[1:10:02] husbands or your wives or your
[1:10:05] children you don't do it with the right
[1:10:07] Spirit they'll just start lashing out at
[1:10:11] you I've seen it many
[1:10:15] times people start acting like the
[1:10:18] spirit that attacked
[1:10:22] them absolutely
[1:10:25] those of us who have watched our
[1:10:27] children closely or watch really
[1:10:31] anybody if you see somebody hang out
[1:10:33] with a certain type of person you'll see
[1:10:36] they'll start acting like that
[1:10:38] person and there are certain times you
[1:10:40] don't want your children or somebody to
[1:10:41] hang out with
[1:10:44] somebody so remember it's always
[1:10:48] important it's not remember this no
[1:10:51] matter
[1:10:52] what it's not the action that happens
[1:10:55] but the reaction brother bradam said
[1:10:57] right so we understand that people are
[1:11:00] not right but you got to be careful that
[1:11:03] you don't have a just a carnal Spirit
[1:11:05] dealing with
[1:11:06] something because you're going to you're
[1:11:09] going to end up acting like
[1:11:11] them all right so let's I'm going to
[1:11:14] take some examples here look at
[1:11:16] jealousy jealousy produces jealousy in
[1:11:19] another
[1:11:20] person let's just say a husband and a
[1:11:23] wife there's a one of them had did
[1:11:26] something made the other person
[1:11:28] jealous well the first thing you know it
[1:11:31] the person that's jealous is going to
[1:11:33] try to get the other one jealous are you
[1:11:37] with me come on it's a real thing it's
[1:11:40] happened I've experienced
[1:11:44] it you get three girls
[1:11:47] together two of them are connecting
[1:11:50] pretty good one of them
[1:11:52] not whoa oh that one that's not is going
[1:11:55] to express a jealousy say something to
[1:11:57] get the other person to and that ball
[1:12:01] just starts rolling amen Spirits are
[1:12:04] real in a church
[1:12:06] amen take a person who's got a spirit
[1:12:10] for a a a desire for
[1:12:13] money we could say a lust for money but
[1:12:15] or a love for money but a desire for
[1:12:18] money they just I mean that's really
[1:12:19] important to them it's so important to
[1:12:21] them they think about it quite a bit
[1:12:25] and someone start talking to that
[1:12:28] person that spirit will try to get on
[1:12:31] that person and all of a sudden they'll
[1:12:33] be yeah man you know they got a point
[1:12:35] that maybe yeah maybe I could get
[1:12:39] some well you've heard of salesman right
[1:12:43] they're trying to sell you something and
[1:12:45] if they're good salesman they can get
[1:12:47] you to buy into
[1:12:49] it these are spirits take a person who's
[1:12:53] trying to build up their own reputation
[1:12:55] when somebody's talking to them they and
[1:12:57] they're trying to build their own
[1:12:58] reputation they're going to feel a
[1:12:59] little bit and they're going to want to
[1:13:01] build themselves up see that a spirit is
[1:13:04] attacking them and they don't even
[1:13:05] realize it
[1:13:10] amen but the beauty of the church is the
[1:13:13] character of the
[1:13:14] people so learning to function as a
[1:13:17] healthy Church it takes the character of
[1:13:20] Christ it takes a right spirit we' got
[1:13:23] to handle things the way Christ handles
[1:13:28] things knowing how to handle something
[1:13:31] is not
[1:13:32] enough you can know how to handle
[1:13:35] something but not have the power of the
[1:13:37] Holy Ghost to handle it in other words
[1:13:40] the Temptation is so great that you just
[1:13:42] have to get one thing
[1:13:44] straight but Christ in
[1:13:48] us can handle things the right
[1:13:52] way they a person who's angry at you for
[1:13:55] something has anybody ever been angry in
[1:13:57] your
[1:13:58] home
[1:14:04] amen they're angry because you did
[1:14:07] something they didn't
[1:14:09] like and they're not handling it
[1:14:13] right maybe they let it f Fuster F
[1:14:17] Fuster for some time
[1:14:21] Fester Gunsmoke
[1:14:32] so they finally got the they just blew
[1:14:34] their top they're coming out at you and
[1:14:36] they're going to let you
[1:14:38] know well automatically if you don't
[1:14:41] have a right Spirit of meekness you're
[1:14:44] going to be
[1:14:45] tempted they shouldn't be treating me
[1:14:48] like that you shouldn't have said that
[1:14:49] the Reas before you know it you're angry
[1:14:52] at them
[1:14:54] right and in our carnal mind we just all
[1:14:57] feel Justified about the
[1:15:01] situation but it takes a bigger person
[1:15:03] to get underneath another person it
[1:15:06] takes a spirit of meekness Amen to deal
[1:15:09] with situations amen and to make a
[1:15:11] healthy relationship because if you're
[1:15:13] arguing and fighting all the time that's
[1:15:14] not
[1:15:22] healthy when somebody gets angry at
[1:15:25] you brother James what do we do when
[1:15:28] somebody gets angry at us what's the
[1:15:30] Bible
[1:15:32] say somebody just gonna fly off the
[1:15:34] handle and you shouldn't have done
[1:15:37] this both if you got a spirit of
[1:15:40] meekness you're just going to give a
[1:15:42] soft
[1:15:43] answer and it's going to turn away the
[1:15:45] Wrath amen that's what the scripture
[1:15:49] tells us so we know it but we need the
[1:15:52] power of it we need the Holy Ghost
[1:15:56] Inside of us that's ready to give a soft
[1:15:59] answer when we've been treated wrong
[1:16:02] when we've been told
[1:16:04] wrong that's what we need in our
[1:16:07] church but too often we come in here
[1:16:09] with our Badges of
[1:16:13] Pride they shouldn't have done that to
[1:16:15] me who are they to say that who are they
[1:16:17] to think
[1:16:21] that may maybe God is wanting to prove
[1:16:27] how perfect we
[1:16:28] are I don't want to fail
[1:16:31] them I don't want to fail brother
[1:16:34] Marty I don't know what he's saying up
[1:16:37] there but if he puts me through a test I
[1:16:39] want to pass it amen I want to pass that
[1:16:44] test often times we use human wisdom to
[1:16:48] handle
[1:16:49] situations that involve evil spirits
[1:16:52] think think about that we're going to
[1:16:54] use
[1:16:55] human Humanity to deal with an evil
[1:17:01] spirit things up things end up becoming
[1:17:04] more confusing there's more Strife
[1:17:06] there's more of a division there's more
[1:17:08] of a misunderstanding there's more of a
[1:17:10] separation more
[1:17:11] bitterness so when we're dealing with
[1:17:13] evil we need something more something
[1:17:16] greater than just Humanity we need the
[1:17:18] power of the Holy Ghost in us we need
[1:17:21] him to take over we need his wisdom his
[1:17:24] Spirit his
[1:17:25] leadership CU we're not equipped to do
[1:17:28] it amen and we're talking about being a
[1:17:30] spiritual church amen we need a
[1:17:33] spiritual God inside of us
[1:17:35] right look at James chapter 3 for a
[1:17:38] little bit now we're not going to be to
[1:17:41] get through
[1:17:44] this but that's okay we'll get through
[1:17:47] what we can get
[1:17:52] through
[1:17:55] so there are carnal ways to
[1:17:58] handle problems and there are spiritual
[1:18:00] ways no
[1:18:02] problems I say if
[1:18:05] you uh are trying to move a dirt pile
[1:18:10] from here to there or you're trying to
[1:18:12] get the snow off your
[1:18:14] sidewalk or
[1:18:16] you're you you
[1:18:19] you you naturally you just do it
[1:18:24] but now if somebody's just laying on the
[1:18:27] sidewalk or laying on the Dirt Pile and
[1:18:28] doesn't want you to do it now there's a
[1:18:31] spirit that you have to deal with
[1:18:34] amen and it's our job to to work through
[1:18:38] that problem and if you weren't through
[1:18:40] it good enough they might be helping you
[1:18:43] to tr the side
[1:18:45] block when you're
[1:18:48] done all right James chapter 3 verse 13
[1:18:51] who is a wise man and endued with
[1:18:54] knowledge among you okay it's a question
[1:18:56] I want to see
[1:18:57] Hands who
[1:19:00] feels who believes that you are a wise
[1:19:04] man and endued with knowledge among you
[1:19:07] I just want to see a show of hands
[1:19:12] one okay well look it this is the word
[1:19:15] of God we got to be this we've got to be
[1:19:19] this it says let him show out of a good
[1:19:22] conversation
[1:19:23] his works with meekness of
[1:19:28] wisdom now the question is not to the
[1:19:31] man who is knowledgeable of the human
[1:19:35] realm but of the spiritual realm
[1:19:39] amen a man that handles things must
[1:19:43] handle them with a spirit of meekness
[1:19:47] and here it is said meekness of wisdom
[1:19:51] there's wisdom in meekness amen amen but
[1:19:56] if you have bitter envy and strife in
[1:20:00] your
[1:20:01] hearts Glory not and lie not against the
[1:20:07] truth this
[1:20:10] wisdom does not come from
[1:20:12] above but it is
[1:20:14] Earthly
[1:20:16] Central and devilish right
[1:20:20] amen H amen
[1:20:23] so think about when you're trying to
[1:20:24] work out a problem and you got Strife
[1:20:28] anger bitterness you got those things
[1:20:31] you know inside of you going on just
[1:20:33] stop just stop get your heart
[1:20:37] right because you're not going to be
[1:20:39] able to handle the situation right now
[1:20:42] amen most of us that had kids when the
[1:20:45] kids were little real little we could
[1:20:48] say don't do that clean that up go into
[1:20:51] your room and they would do it but when
[1:20:55] they got older you couldn't say
[1:21:01] that you
[1:21:08] couldn't because they're
[1:21:11] maturing they're learning Mom Daddy
[1:21:14] ain't supposed to talk to me like
[1:21:17] that then you got to start using wisdom
[1:21:21] amen because they're old
[1:21:25] and look when we're dealing with people
[1:21:26] they got problems you need the wisdom of
[1:21:28] God
[1:21:30] right it's not about knowing what's
[1:21:33] right or wrong this question is who's
[1:21:35] ued with from uh who's wise Among Us
[1:21:39] who's got the the the knowledge of
[1:21:41] Christ
[1:21:42] amen we can't have bitter envy and and
[1:21:48] strife in our hearts no matter how much
[1:21:51] you think you're right
[1:21:53] all right verse 16 for where envy and
[1:21:56] and strife is there is confusion but we
[1:21:59] know who the author of confusion is
[1:22:01] Right amen and every evil
[1:22:06] work worldly wisdom to me is an Open
[1:22:09] Door for the devil to march
[1:22:12] in do is dirty work but the wisdom that
[1:22:15] is from above number one it's pure there
[1:22:20] it is to the pure all things are pure
[1:22:23] pure
[1:22:24] motives then
[1:22:26] Peaceable
[1:22:28] gentle easy to be
[1:22:30] intreated full of Mercy full of good
[1:22:35] fruits without partiality and without
[1:22:38] hypocracy
[1:22:40] and the fruit of righteousness is sown
[1:22:44] in peace of them that make
[1:22:49] peace
[1:22:51] wow Lord fill me with that amen fill me
[1:22:55] with the wisdom that's from
[1:22:56] above to me Jesus lived
[1:23:00] Proverbs he lived the Book of
[1:23:04] Proverbs he grew and he whacked strong
[1:23:07] in spirit and in wisdom the Bible says
[1:23:09] he he taught wisdom in
[1:23:11] Parables like our last service we talked
[1:23:14] about but the thing is when he handled
[1:23:17] situations he handled them with what's
[1:23:21] being described here with as wisdom from
[1:23:25] above he handled them
[1:23:29] gently and there's there's a lot of
[1:23:32] examples about this look at the
[1:23:35] woman that they brought to Jesus who was
[1:23:38] caught in
[1:23:40] adultery these were religious men they
[1:23:43] knew their they knew what the word
[1:23:46] said yes amen and there they came to to
[1:23:51] Jesus with their word worldly wisdom and
[1:23:53] they said this is what the the word says
[1:23:55] and we should Stone them but you know
[1:23:57] what do you say what do you
[1:24:01] say well he he used the wisdom that was
[1:24:04] from above amen it was it was pure it
[1:24:08] was gentle it was easy to be
[1:24:14] entreated just kind of step back made
[1:24:17] him think about what they were doing for
[1:24:18] a minute he didn't put them in a
[1:24:21] headlock and punch him in the
[1:24:24] face no just step back
[1:24:27] and we don't know what he wrote in the
[1:24:32] say but finally he said okay he that's
[1:24:36] without sin Let Him cast the first stone
[1:24:38] now to me that was the wisdom of God
[1:24:43] Amen that was
[1:24:46] meekness now he knew they were all
[1:24:49] wrong that could have been what he was
[1:24:51] writing and saying that's right but you
[1:24:54] know he didn't
[1:24:55] condemn he just let him walk
[1:25:02] away and then to the woman he didn't
[1:25:05] condemn her
[1:25:06] either just go don't do it no
[1:25:10] more because God is in the business of
[1:25:14] restoring you know too often we just
[1:25:17] need to you know we just have this
[1:25:19] carnal spirit in us in our flesh that we
[1:25:22] just want to handle everything in the
[1:25:26] flesh that's that's not where Christ is
[1:25:29] at no matter how much you think you're
[1:25:31] right
[1:25:32] amen and there are so many examples in
[1:25:37] the
[1:25:37] bible
[1:25:40] where jesus
[1:25:42] used wisdom from
[1:25:46] above if you're going to help somebody
[1:25:49] be
[1:25:51] Peaceable
[1:25:52] he sold
[1:25:54] peace in that
[1:25:56] situation and then he got peace out of
[1:25:59] it we make peace we either make peace or
[1:26:03] we destroy it right we're supposed to
[1:26:05] pray for the Peace of
[1:26:07] Israel we're supposed to be peacemakers
[1:26:10] blessed are the peacemakers amen we have
[1:26:14] our brother Jonathan has made mention
[1:26:15] that there's power in the tongue that's
[1:26:18] right it can bring life to a situation
[1:26:21] it can
[1:26:22] edify or it can bring death to a
[1:26:28] situation and to me if you really really
[1:26:31] want to be the bride of
[1:26:34] Christ ask God for wisdom we we don't
[1:26:37] got time to get into this but we know
[1:26:39] James tells us that if any man lacks
[1:26:42] wisdom he's no respector of persons
[1:26:44] right just let him ask right and God
[1:26:46] will give it to him I want to be that I
[1:26:49] pray for wisdom every day I pray for the
[1:26:51] Holy Ghost ghost more Holy Ghost every
[1:26:53] day I pray for more of him every
[1:27:01] day because I want to represent him I
[1:27:04] don't want to just stand with some badge
[1:27:06] and say yeah I believe the message and I
[1:27:08] got all the uh Mysteries understood and
[1:27:12] I know
[1:27:13] everything no I want to be a million
[1:27:16] miles from that where I want to be is
[1:27:19] whatever situation he puts me in I want
[1:27:22] about to handle
[1:27:24] it I want about to handle it I tell you
[1:27:27] as a healthy church that's where we all
[1:27:30] have to be amen we can't just oh let the
[1:27:33] pastor do it let this
