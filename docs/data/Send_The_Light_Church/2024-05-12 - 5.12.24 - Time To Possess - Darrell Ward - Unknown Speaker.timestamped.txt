[40:00] amen if you just uh have your seats for
[40:03] a
[40:04] moment I'd like to uh this being
[40:07] Mother's Day I'd like to just read you a
[40:09] couple of things about mothers and then
[40:11] we'll go on into the word and so if you
[40:14] your mother's still with you take the
[40:17] time today if if she's not close to you
[40:20] to call her and thank her for all she's
[40:22] done for you those of us that's lost our
[40:24] mothers it's there's it leaves a place
[40:27] place in your heart that can never be
[40:30] filled I lost my mother in 2005 uh she
[40:35] had gallbladder cancer was a very rare
[40:37] form of cancer and it spread from the
[40:40] gallbladder to the liver and the liver
[40:42] to the bowel and uh she lived about 50
[40:45] days before she
[40:46] passed but my mother told me I spent a
[40:49] lot of time with her the last few days
[40:51] of her life and she kept telling me she
[40:53] said I can't see past five and I I
[40:57] really didn't know what she was talking
[40:59] about I was giv her a lot of pain
[41:01] medicine you know for the for the liver
[41:03] pain and so I was thinking maybe it was
[41:05] the the morphine and she kept telling me
[41:08] she said I can't see past five and I
[41:11] lost my mother on New Year's Eve 2005
[41:14] she never saw past five she was telling
[41:18] me that but she was a great mother so if
[41:20] your mother's still with you today just
[41:23] take the time to tell her and I like to
[41:25] share this from the prophet of God if
[41:27] that's okay amen he said this morning it
[41:30] being Mother's
[41:32] Day said I wish to speak a message about
[41:34] mothers I've always said and made this
[41:37] kind of saying to mothers we know
[41:39] written of the four gospels Matthew Mark
[41:41] Luke and John but there's a Fifth Gospel
[41:44] Unwritten and that's mother she gets
[41:47] them before Matthew Mark Luke and John's
[41:49] teaching gets them and mother is so
[41:51] great you know the first one that
[41:53] receives you in this life is your mother
[41:56] no one can touch you because you're
[41:57] conceived and she Bears you under her
[41:59] heart she's the first to know you and
[42:02] the first in this life to hold you amen
[42:04] and when you're born she's one of the
[42:06] first hands that touches you and wipes
[42:08] back the tears out of your eye she's the
[42:11] first one to Pat you and to love you and
[42:12] to cool over you in this life as your
[42:14] mother now I think that there's not
[42:16] enough honor that we could give a mother
[42:18] amen motherhood is so
[42:20] important that the prophet said when you
[42:23] break motherhood you've broken your
[42:25] nation that's right
[42:27] true
[42:28] amen you young people here honor your
[42:31] mother who tries to raise you right and

[44:35] sorrowful yet always

[44:43] as having nothing and yet possessing all
[44:48] things amen Genesis 22 want to start at
[44:52] verse 15
[45:05] and the angel of the Lord called into
[45:06] Abraham Out of Heaven the second
[45:08] time and he said by myself have I sworn
[45:11] sayth the Lord for because thou has done
[45:14] this thing and has not withheld thy son
[45:16] thine only son that in blessing I Will
[45:19] Bless thee and in multiplying I will
[45:21] multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven
[45:24] and as the sand which is upon the
[45:26] seashore
[45:27] if you've ever been to the beach that's
[45:29] quite a
[45:30] lot and thy seed shall possess the gates
[45:35] of his enemy amen and in thy seed shall
[45:38] all the nations of the earth be blessed
[45:41] why because thou Hast obeyed my voice
[45:46] amen am may the Lord add his Blessing to
[45:48] the reading of his word I want to speak
[45:50] to you this morning it's time to

[46:08] anoint our lips to speak your word amen
[46:10] and may it touch every heart dear God
[46:12] for Lord truly we're living in the
[46:14] closing moments of the Gentile
[46:16] dispensation amen and Lord I remember as
[46:18] the thinking of the Titanic God when
[46:20] they made that great ship back in the
[46:22] early 1900s and man's great achievement
[46:25] they stood there and said that nothing
[46:26] nothing could sink that ship amen and
[46:29] yet God by his mighty hand put the
[46:31] Titanic at the bottom of the sea he did
[46:33] and Lord when it struck that iceberg
[46:34] that morning and it begin to sink they
[46:37] realized Lord that a ship that they
[46:39] thought was Unsinkable they had to have
[46:41] someplace to go God as much as we love
[46:44] this nation Lord she's sinking right
[46:46] before us we've got to have someplace to
[46:48] go but Lord we're so glad this morning
[46:50] that a Lifeboat has been given that we
[46:53] can step off this sinking ship onto the
[46:55] Lifeboat of Thy word Dear God and it'll
[46:57] take us safely to the shore oh God this
[47:00] morning may we lay aside everything Lord
[47:03] to obey thy voice even as Father Abraham
[47:05] did bless each one today we commit it
[47:07] into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus
[47:10] name and the bride says amen God bless
[47:13] you you may be
[47:14] seated amen now we understand by the
[47:17] scriptures in verse 17 and 18 that
[47:20] Abraham is the father of the faithful
[47:23] amen and we are hirs to the promise
[47:25] through Christ amen amen you see he's
[47:29] the father of the faithful amen and the
[47:31] promise is of our father now Abraham was
[47:35] just an ordinary man and at one time he
[47:39] was actually an idol worshipper did you
[47:42] know that he was actually an idol
[47:44] worshipper so what does that tell us
[47:46] about God that we serve a God who has
[47:50] transforming power now the word
[47:53] transforming means the ability to bring
[47:55] about a dramatic change
[47:57] we serve a God who has the ability to
[48:00] bring about a dramatic change amen he
[48:04] can transform a drunk into a
[48:06] preacher I know that for a fact he can
[48:09] transform a street Harlot to a lady he
[48:11] can transform bitter water and make it
[48:13] sweet he can transform a sinner to a
[48:16] saint he can transform a world that when
[48:18] it was dark and void and make it a
[48:20] Garden of Eden by the transforming power
[48:23] of the almighty God the prophet said
[48:25] that's the transforming power of God
[48:27] that can take something that's nothing
[48:30] and make something wonderful out of it
[48:32] God's transforming power he took five
[48:35] biscuits and two fishes of fish and fed
[48:38] 5,000 people he took cooked fish and
[48:41] broke it off amen and it was still
[48:43] cooked fish he took bread that had been
[48:45] broke that had been baked and broke it
[48:47] off and when it came back it was still
[48:49] baked bread what kind of adders did he
[48:52] let loose Hallelujah he was God the
[48:54] Creator amen and he had the ability to
[48:58] bring about a dramatic change God the
[49:01] Creator living in you and giving you all
[49:03] power and in your possession of anything
[49:06] that he had he has given us possession
[49:08] of everything that he is this morning
[49:11] the prophet said if you'll receive him
[49:13] and embrace him and love him and hold
[49:15] him in your heart and love him I tell
[49:17] you the church together in that kind of
[49:20] power has the power to bind Heavens to
[49:22] heal the sick to Open the Eyes of the
[49:24] blind oh Hallelujah the dumb speak the
[49:28] deaf ear the crippled walk the blind see
[49:30] why it's recognizing the power of
[49:32] almighty God into your heart there he is
[49:35] deity dwelling in human flesh and God by
[49:39] his transforming power he's going to
[49:41] take these old frail bodies one day
[49:42] brother s and transform them into young
[49:45] men and women
[49:46] again oh in a moment in a twinkling of
[49:49] an eye he'll bring about a dramatic
[49:52] change by the transforming power of
[49:55] almighty God and you young people here
[49:57] sitting here this morning you're not
[49:58] going to be robbed he's going to take
[50:00] your Youth and turn you into Eternal
[50:05] youth oh God am by the transforming
[50:08] power of almighty God now we understand
[50:12] by the scriptures the Bible that Abraham
[50:15] wasn't looking for God that's right
[50:18] that's right but God came looking for
[50:22] Abraham amen and as Abraham seed this
[50:25] morning we can say the same thing we
[50:28] never sought God it was always God
[50:31] seeking
[50:32] us amen I'll prove it to you by the
[50:35] Bible when Adam the first son was lost
[50:38] who came looking for
[50:40] Adam who came looking for him God did
[50:43] then who comes looking for every lost
[50:46] son and daughter of God God came looking
[50:48] for you Hallelujah I was lost in the
[50:51] darkness but he came and fail me amen
[50:55] hallelujah God looking for you you never
[50:58] sought God but it was always him seeking
[51:00] us because God by his for knowledge knew
[51:03] that Abraham would believe him when he
[51:06] spoke Hallelujah so God sought out
[51:10] Abraham because he knew Abraham would
[51:12] believe him and God sought you out
[51:15] because he knew you would believe him
[51:17] when he spoke amen amen God has purposed
[51:21] and hid it from The Eyes Of The Prudent
[51:22] wise and revealed it to predestinated
[51:25] babes who were predestinated to receive
[51:29] it let me tell you this morning you
[51:31] didn't stagger into this thing I said
[51:34] you didn't stagger into this thing no

[51:38] there was a star God knew your name he
[51:41] knew the color of your skin he knew the
[51:42] color of come on somebody I'm not
[51:44] talking about some Disney thing I'm
[51:46] talking about the almighty God this
[51:48] morning who knew us before there was a
[51:50] star and wrote our name in his
[51:54] book Hallelujah and did he come looking
[51:57] for he came looking for his
[52:01] own amen and then stagger into this
[52:04] thing God ordained me for such a time as
[52:07] this Luther had his day Wesley had his
[52:09] day Pentecost had their day with the
[52:11] restoration of the gifts but this is
[52:13] bride time
[52:15] now amen amen that God help us this
[52:19] morning to be the like Abraham who never
[52:22] sought God who never doubted God when
[52:25] God spoke but he always believed God
[52:28] amen amen and God said to him because
[52:31] thou Hast obeyed my voice I
[52:35] have I by myself have sworn God said I
[52:38] swore by myself because there was none
[52:41] greater to swear
[52:42] by amen amen he said I promise you
[52:46] Abraham thy seed shall possess the Gate
[52:50] of his enemy not maybe not hope so not
[52:53] could be well I don't know oh no but he
[52:57] shall shall possess amen and shall in

[53:03] or an obligation it's not just something

[53:07] not don't know God hallelujah he made a
[53:11] command the same God that said let there

[53:25] the promises to you and to your children
[53:28] even as far off as many as the Lord Our
[53:30] God shall call it's not a hope so it's
[53:33] not a could be it's a command it's an
[53:36] obligation amen that if we are obedient
[53:38] to God's word God will keep his word to

[54:49] could lay claim to everything that was
[54:52] in the land and the land itself right

[55:06] the city become the governor of the city

[1:02:43] heard that his brother was taken captive
[1:02:45] think about that brother I like that the
[1:02:47] prophet said his brother look at what
[1:02:49] lot had done to him and yet he called
[1:02:52] him
[1:02:53] brother yes amen

[1:02:58] not see eye eye to eye on everything but
[1:03:00] we're
[1:03:02] brothers during World War II the the
[1:03:06] Germans had the Americans surrounded and
[1:03:09] it was in a great battle and so you know
[1:03:11] I was in the military brother Bill here

[1:03:14] and there's a code of honor among the
[1:03:16] military that we leave no one
[1:03:19] behind many a good man has died on the
[1:03:22] battlefield trying to bring a wounded
[1:03:24] brother off the
[1:03:26] Battlefield in this particular battle
[1:03:28] the Germans was advancing on the
[1:03:30] Americans and they had to retreat and

[1:03:36] everybody said leave the wounded we've
[1:03:38] got to leave them we'll get them later

[1:03:57] out of his body that it covered the
[1:03:58] soldier that was trying to carry him and
[1:04:00] you couldn't tell which one was wounded
[1:04:01] they was both covered in blood and the
[1:04:04] sergeant turned to the boy and he said
[1:04:05] drop that man we've got to go we'll get
[1:04:07] him later and he turned around the
[1:04:09] second time and the boy was still trying
[1:04:11] to carry this man and the sergeant said
[1:04:13] drop him we'll come back and get him if
[1:04:15] we don't pull to the rear everybody will
[1:04:17] be lost and he turned the third time and
[1:04:20] the boy was staggered under the weight
[1:04:22] of this guy trying to get him off the
[1:04:23] battlefield and the sergeant said as
[1:04:25] your non-commission officer I command

[1:06:00] attention took their weapons away from
[1:06:02] them stripped them of the rank and put
[1:06:04] them on the same train with gono and
[1:06:06] shipped them to Florida down to Fort

[1:06:10] where they kept
[1:06:12] gono and on the train according to his
[1:06:15] autobiography one of jono's
[1:06:17] Warriors and one of the White Mountain
[1:06:19] Apaches spoke up and he said you was
[1:06:23] right not the trust the white eye
[1:06:26] everything he told us was a lie and one
[1:06:30] of tono's Warriors spoke up and said I
[1:06:33] hate you as long as there's breath in my
[1:06:36] body I hate you so why didn't you leave
[1:06:39] us alone we was living the way the
[1:06:42] Creator made us to live this was our
[1:06:44] land this was our way of
[1:06:47] life why didn't you leave us alone why
[1:06:49] did you track us down like

[1:07:04] hate one
[1:07:07] another
[1:07:08] amen amen we may not see out eye on
[1:07:12] everything but we're brothers we need
[1:07:15] each
[1:07:17] other when Abraham heard his brother was
[1:07:19] in trouble was taken captive he went and
[1:07:21] got him and I want you to notice
[1:07:23] Abraham's men that they were Farm they
[1:07:25] were not
[1:07:27] Warriors they didn't know how to fight
[1:07:29] they couldn't even spell Kung
[1:07:32] Fu they wasn't War they were
[1:07:37] farmers and the Bible said
[1:07:40] 318 went down after the kings that help
[1:07:43] lot and his
[1:07:45] family think about that why would a
[1:07:48] bunch of farmers being led by Abraham go
[1:07:51] up against a bunch of kings and their
[1:07:54] armies right now if the kings are there
[1:07:57] you think they got the sorest bunch of
[1:07:58] soldiers protecting the king oh no
[1:08:01] they've got the best of the best of the
[1:08:03] best so this Army that was with this
[1:08:05] King was the best of the best that they
[1:08:08] had and why would Abraham with 38
[1:08:12] Farmers go up against an army like
[1:08:17] that why would he do that like I said
[1:08:20] they they didn't know how to fight with
[1:08:21] swords they didn't they just had holes
[1:08:23] and rakes and pitch for
[1:08:27] why would they do that because Abraham
[1:08:30] had a revelation that God had given him
[1:08:32] the land and all that was in it and he
[1:08:35] was acting he was acting on his belief
[1:08:38] of what God Said was true he was acting
[1:08:41] on the word of God Amen let me say
[1:08:45] friends how do we know how do we know
[1:08:47] that Noah believed God when God said it
[1:08:49] was going to
[1:08:51] rain how do we know that because Noah
[1:08:54] built the ark before the rain ever fell
[1:08:58] he he acted on what God Said and I'm
[1:09:01] telling you the hour has now come it's
[1:09:03] not enough to say I believe the message
[1:09:05] you must apply the
[1:09:09] message well I believe I what does that
[1:09:11] mean it's not enough to say I believe we
[1:09:14] must act upon our
[1:09:16] belief for the Bible says the devil
[1:09:19] believes and trembles and he ain't going
[1:09:21] to no
[1:09:23] Rapture well if somebody preach when
[1:09:25] we'll get done a lot faster that's the
[1:09:27] truth friends I will I believe what does
[1:09:30] that mean it's not enough to say I
[1:09:32] believe it's time we act yes on what we
[1:09:36] believe amen
[1:09:38] amen you see God could tell Abraham he
[1:09:40] was an heir to all the land because he
[1:09:42] knew Abraham would believe
[1:09:46] him that's right amen this thing ain't
[1:09:49] working
[1:09:52] sure I said God could tell Abraham he
[1:09:55] was a possessor of all the land because
[1:09:58] he knew Abraham would believe
[1:10:02] him this book was sealed with Seven
[1:10:04] Seals but now the seals have been opened

[1:10:43] the Gate of his enemy because God said

[1:11:10] that was in the land amen Abraham went
[1:11:13] after what belonged to him amen just
[1:11:17] like I said last night when God sent
[1:11:19] Moses down to Egypt he didn't go down
[1:11:21] there to steal Pharaoh's slaves but he
[1:11:22] told Moses go down there and tell

[1:14:26] hallelujah amen better our fight start
[1:14:30] right here let it start right here by
[1:14:32] foraying what the word says we are when
[1:14:35] Abraham returned from the slaughter of
[1:14:36] the Kings the king of solom told him
[1:14:38] take the spoils and Abraham said to the
[1:14:41] king of solom amen he said I'll not take
[1:14:44] thread to Sho latch cuz he didn't fight
[1:14:46] the war to make a lot of money and real
[1:14:49] true battles are not made with selfish
[1:14:53] motives amen amen but we're living in
[1:14:56] such a selfish age oh that's right
[1:14:59] that's why they'll cut around you at 60
[1:15:01] M hour throw on the brakes and turn off
[1:15:03] because they think they're more
[1:15:04] important than you are amen you know in
[1:15:08] 2013 I think it was Webster's Dictionary
[1:15:10] they pick a word that represents the
[1:15:12] Western Hemisphere and a word that
[1:15:13] represents the Eastern Hemisphere
[1:15:15] because the word that was most used
[1:15:17] during that year and in 2013 the the
[1:15:19] Webster's Dictionary or it was Oxford
[1:15:22] weord yeah dictionary they they picked
[1:15:24] one word to represent the entire
[1:15:29] world because this word had influenced
[1:15:32] the
[1:15:32] entire world you know what that word was
[1:15:36] anybody know
[1:15:38] selfie
[1:15:43] self oh you know you're guilty you might
[1:15:45] as well
[1:15:47] smile selfie because we're living in a
[1:15:51] selfish age if you don't believe me look
[1:15:54] it up down in Texas here not long ago
[1:15:57] there's a woman had a preacher she had a
[1:16:00] wedding cake she had a wedding dress she
[1:16:02] had a wedding
[1:16:03] party the only thing missing was the
[1:16:08] groom because she married herself look
[1:16:11] it up you think I'm telling you look it
[1:16:13] up she married herself because she said
[1:16:15] there was no one who could love her as
[1:16:18] much as she loved herself
[1:16:25] the prophet God said in the last
[1:16:28] days the true love of God would be
[1:16:32] replaced with selfish
[1:16:35] motives that's right we're living in a
[1:16:39] selfish age
[1:16:42] amen but real true battles are not
[1:16:44] fought for selfish motives am amen amen
[1:16:50] they're not fought for money but they're
[1:16:52] fought for principles men fight War for
[1:16:55] principle and when Abraham went out to
[1:16:57] get lost he didn't go out because he
[1:16:58] knew he could whip the Kings and take
[1:17:00] all their possession he went out for the
[1:17:02] principle of saving his brother and any
[1:17:04] Minister that sent out under the
[1:17:06] inspiration of the king of heaven will
[1:17:07] not go for money neither will he go to
[1:17:10] make big churches neither will he go to
[1:17:11] inspire denominations he'll go for one
[1:17:14] principle and that is to bring back his
[1:17:16] Fallen
[1:17:18] brother I've come to this service this
[1:17:20] morning with the principal to war with
[1:17:22] the devil not for a name not for
[1:17:24] popularity
[1:17:25] but to get my Fallen brother the one
[1:17:28] that Satan has tied down and say loose
[1:17:30] him and let him
[1:17:32] go thank you Lord you see the devil he
[1:17:36] don't care if you see your prison cell
[1:17:38] he don't care if you see the bars of
[1:17:40] your prison cell he don't care if you

[1:18:46] the son hath made free is free
[1:18:50] indeed I was up there just a couple year
[1:18:53] ago and she came up to me she said dar
[1:18:55] it's been over two years and I'm still
[1:18:58] sober hallelujah hallelujah that's the
[1:19:02] God we serve this
[1:19:04] morning Solomon said there's a Time For
[1:19:06] Peace and there's a time for war there's
[1:19:08] nothing wrong with fighting if you're
[1:19:10] fighting for the right principle he said
[1:19:12] when I was reading down at Tombstone the
[1:19:13] other day in the museum and I saw the
[1:19:15] picture of Dono and many of you might
[1:19:17] think that Dono was a renegate but to me
[1:19:20] he was a genuine American he was only
[1:19:22] fighting for that which was right that
[1:19:24] God had give him a land and a nation and
[1:19:26] a place to live he said I don't blame
[1:19:29] him and when those white soldiers coming
[1:19:30] there force and taking over the land and
[1:19:32] killing him out like a bunch of flies
[1:19:34] and there was the original picture Dono
[1:19:36] his medical headquarters or his hospital
[1:19:38] it was two or three blankets over a
[1:19:40] piece of mqu and the wounded real
[1:19:42] genuine American Indians fighting for
[1:19:45] their god-given rights amen and that was
[1:19:48] drawn about with a baby of his own on
[1:19:50] his hip standing there looking about his
[1:19:51] own Warriors bleeding and dying with no
[1:19:54] penicillin or nothing and no way to to
[1:19:56] help them a genuine god-given American
[1:19:59] then you call him a renegade he said I
[1:20:01] call him a gentleman amen fighting for
[1:20:05] what God had gave him I say it's time
[1:20:08] Hallelujah that we war against the enemy
[1:20:10] for what belongs to us fighting for
[1:20:13] something that God gave him a land and a

[1:32:34] children possessed the gates of the
[1:32:35] fiery furnace we're going to look at
[1:32:37] just for a few minutes just a couple of
[1:32:38] people the natural seat of Abraham who
[1:32:40] believed the promise and possessed the
[1:32:42] land now these children this fiery
[1:32:44] furnace the King was so mad at these
[1:32:46] Hebrew boys that he heated up the
[1:32:48] furnace seven times hotter than it ever
[1:32:50] been
[1:32:52] heated amen now what why did he do that
[1:32:54] cuz he was
[1:32:56] mad he was so mad and so upset that he
[1:32:59] heated up that furnace seven times
[1:33:01] harder than had ever been heated and he
[1:33:03] commanded his men to throw these boys
[1:33:05] into the fiery furnace and the furnace
[1:33:07] was so hot the men that threw them in
[1:33:10] died from the fire amen you talk about
[1:33:12] insanity this King was so upset he
[1:33:15] destroyed his own people trying to

[1:33:39] he took the Heat and the smoke out of
[1:33:41] the fire you say how can you say that
[1:33:43] because you see he was so upset if he
[1:33:45] looked into the furnace and the fire was
[1:33:47] out what do you think he would have done
[1:33:50] he would have reled amen but when he
[1:33:52] looked in there it was still burning but
[1:33:55] they were walking
[1:33:57] around because our God took the Heat and
[1:34:01] the smoke out of the fire
[1:34:04] amen because the seed these Hebrew boys
[1:34:07] said we are the Seed of Abraham amen and
[1:34:11] not even the fire could burn them

[1:34:21] used to human flesh they likeed the
[1:34:23] Taste of human flesh and they threw
[1:34:26] Daniel in this line then with no way out
[1:34:29] that's right and them lines looked at D
[1:34:31] said my God this is a Happy
[1:34:35] Meal nowhere for him to go amen but
[1:34:39] Daniel was the Seed of Abraham and he
[1:34:42] had the promise that his seed would
[1:34:44] possess the Gate of the enemy So Daniel
[1:34:47] stood his ground against these Lions
[1:34:51] right now if you'll study lines you'll
[1:34:53] know that a line's Roar is between 110
[1:34:56] and 114 decimals 120 decimals will
[1:35:00] permanently damage the human ear that's
[1:35:02] how loud the roar is 110 to 114 decimal
[1:35:06] a lon's roar can be heard five miles
[1:35:10] away and these boys are right here in
[1:35:13] front of Daniel now when a li before he
[1:35:16] takes his meal he'll Roar to let
[1:35:18] somebody know this is my
[1:35:21] steak but the Bible say
[1:35:24] is that God shut the mouth of the
[1:35:28] Lions and Daniel standing there and that
[1:35:30] Pillar of Fire between him and the lions
[1:35:32] and when the Lions went out to roar roar
[1:35:35] when they went out the roar all that
[1:35:37] came out was
[1:35:41] meow the prophet said they went over and
[1:35:43] laid down in the corner and meowed like
[1:35:47] kittens oh
[1:35:52] God look at Samson now the prophet said
[1:35:55] Samson was a shrimp a mama's boy another
[1:35:58] place he said he was a
[1:36:02] yes you see you see pictures of Samson
[1:36:04] with all these muscles there's no
[1:36:06] mystery why he could do that with all
[1:36:07] those muscles but Samson he sort of kind
[1:36:09] of look like me know just he couldn't
[1:36:11] even spell
[1:36:14] muscle and I worked in surgery and
[1:36:17] people on construction that would pick
[1:36:18] up wheelbarrows of brick or concrete
[1:36:20] I've seen them pull this muscle loose
[1:36:22] from the bone and they would come into
[1:36:24] surgery and we'd make an incision and
[1:36:26] we' take that tendon and take like a
[1:36:27] 1050 staple and reattach it to the Bone
[1:36:30] and sew them up in 68 weeks later they
[1:36:32] was healed but they would just pick up a
[1:36:33] wheelbarrow of bricks and rip that
[1:36:35] muscle out of their arm but the Bible
[1:36:37] says that Samson when he seen he was g
[1:36:39] in he picked up the gates of the city
[1:36:42] and according to they say the gates
[1:36:43] weighed I believe it was 8 tons a piece
[1:36:45] or something like that and this man who
[1:36:48] was a mama's boy picked up not one gate
[1:36:51] but two gates about 16 tons of weight
[1:36:54] and picked them up on his shoulders and
[1:36:56] carried them up on the hill and sat them
[1:36:57] down and said you boys W you Gates come
[1:36:59] up here and get
[1:37:01] them because he possessed the Gate of
[1:37:05] his enemy but I'm thinking about another
[1:37:08] one before we close another seed Jesus
[1:37:12] Christ The Royal seed and what did he do
[1:37:14] he took all the gates of the enemy he
[1:37:15] took the Gate of sickness sickness
[1:37:17] cannot exist in his presence neither can
[1:37:19] anything else exist in his presence a
[1:37:21] funeral possession cannot stand in his
[1:37:23] presence what did he do Joshua died
[1:37:25] Moses died all the rest of them but not
[1:37:27] this Royal seed death couldn not stand
[1:37:29] where life was the woman from n came out
[1:37:31] with her boy stopped and said he raised
[1:37:33] up the son that girl that was dead gyus
[1:37:35] his daughter he spoke a word back Yonder
[1:37:36] into the unknown world out there and
[1:37:38] said daughter arise and Lazareth who was
[1:37:40] in the grave four days dead his body was
[1:37:42] rot even his sisters said Lord his nose
[1:37:44] is done caved in but he stood there a
[1:37:46] man who had been four dead four days and
[1:37:48] he said Lazarus come
[1:37:51] forth amen and he broke the seals of
[1:37:54] everything his precious Soul descended
[1:37:57] into hell where I ought to have went but
[1:37:59] on that third day Samson taken the Gate
[1:38:01] of the city on his back nothing to do
[1:38:02] with this he took the gates of hell he
[1:38:04] took the gates of the grave and
[1:38:05] everything else he didn't pack it up on
[1:38:07] the mountain he destroyed it he
[1:38:09] possessed the Gate of the enemy the
[1:38:10] atmosphere was filled with devil power
[1:38:12] above Angels or nothing else could come
[1:38:14] down there could be no intercession
[1:38:15] because the blood of goats would not
[1:38:16] take away sin but his own blood took
[1:38:19] away sin and he ascended up on high and
[1:38:21] led captivity captive and gave gift to
[1:38:23] men now everyone of Abraham's seed
[1:38:26] that's willing to pay the
[1:38:29] price amen and be filled with the Holy
[1:38:31] Ghost and stand the test we are
[1:38:33] possessors of the Gate of every enemy he
[1:38:36] possessed every gate the Gate of
[1:38:37] sickness the Gate of death the Gate of
[1:38:38] Hell the Gate of Temptation the Gate of
[1:38:40] the Grave he possessed every gate and
[1:38:42] freely give it to us and it makes us
[1:38:44] more than conquerors through him that
[1:38:46] loved us amen This Means War in this
[1:38:50] anniversary 23 years of this church as

[1:38:54] time that we say This Means War it's

[1:51:37] an Indian came up to me he was in he
[1:51:39] about 60 60 some year old his left arm
[1:51:41] was artificial his right leg was
[1:51:43] artificial and he came up to me had a
[1:51:45] bandana around just a typical looking
[1:51:46] Apache and when he got close to me I
[1:51:48] could smell the alcohol in his breath
[1:51:50] and I looked at him and I thought poor
[1:51:51] fell they took his land away from him
[1:51:53] putting my ha on the reservation
[1:51:54] probably drafted him into the army
