her strength and health to be be here in her body know that she would be here if she could have otherwise amen amen well we'd like to uh take part 5 of making man in his image and kind of make this the last one of the series and honestly this scripture that we're going to open up with in genesis chapter 22 verse 15 is what actually started the whole series was this scripture we want to entitle this message possessing your gates possessing your gates genesis chapter 22 verses number 15 through 7 through 18. then we're going to read acts chapter 2 verses 38 39 very familiar and then we'll have a word of prayer amen genesis chapter 22 starting with verse number 15 and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou has done this thing because thou has done this thing and is not with how thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiple and i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven as the sands which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed and here it is again because thou has obeyed my voice and acts chapter 2 verses 38 39 which i'm sure all of us could just quote this then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call amen amen amen we also just read verse 40. and with many other words they testify and exhort them saying save yourselves save yourselves from this entour generation so we have a part to play do we not amen let's just look to the lord in prayer our heavenly father we thank you lord that you have called us we could see yourself in the scripture that we have been called and lord you put something inside of us to respond to that call there was a deep call and there was a deep to respond and here we are today as your children we're growing in the grace and knowledge of christ and growing in love and growing to the statue of a perfect man and growing into the nature and back into the image lord of which you originally made man and we want to thank you for the work of the holy ghost in in each of our lives lord that you haven't thrown away the clay that over and over again you're molding us and making us lord we just want to thank you this morning for that lord we want to thank you that you've given us health and strength to be here in your house to to worship you to praise you to lift up your name and to come and receive lord the the word of life where you said my words are spirits and they are life and today lord unless you come and make the words that are being preached and the words that are being read and the words that are being quoted lord unless you come and make them live inside of us lord they're they're not going to be fruitful in our lives so we pray that you'd come and do what none of us can do here lord build your church by revelation inside of our hearts lord we commit ourself into your hands we pray lord through the ministry of the word that you would do supernatural work in our lives father that uh hearts could be amended lord that they could be drawn closer to you that bodies could be healed father that's that that lives could could be delivered lord that that man could could take possession of his vessel through the power and faith of the holy ghost working in them lord that you would truly as uh one had said lord that we would do exploits in this hour father we thank you for these things now we committed all to your hands in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen amen god bless you may be seated well god called abraham out from among his people and he gave him a promise when he was about 75 years old we all know the story of abraham and that the promise was that abraham was going to become a father of a great nation and every father needs a son in order to be a father and every nation needs a land and god had promised abraham the land that was needed to be this great nation as well the problem was that abraham he had faced uh being without child heat he didn't have a son and the land that god had promised him was already inhabited by his enemy and so that was a that was a quite of a problem and when we think about the holy ghost uh the promises that god had had made to us uh require help and it takes a strong faith right because abraham is the father of our faith and we really need faith to receive the nature of god in our life abraham might not have realized at the time but he was going to be able to to not bring these promises to pass on his own it was going to require a great trust in god and a great faith in god he wouldn't be able to do it on his own accord abraham went through a whole host of trials first he had he separated from his family and that was very difficult kind of left his home and everything and then he actually uh had to leave part of those that he was with he had had to separate from lot because i mean lot just wasn't willing to go all the way with god after 11 years he had a son ishmael he had this said because he was trying to bring to pass a supernatural promise he wanted israel ishmael to fulfill the promise of a great nation and after 25 years god finally brought forth isaac supernaturally and it was through faith it was without the effort the physical intellectual human element that brought this son it was simply i believe in you god you're going to do it you spoke it it has to happen and through 25 years of waiting god had an expected end for abraham praise god just like he does for all of us now it was about 15 or 25 years later that god told abraham to sacrifice his promised son and you talk about sometimes we feel confused what god wants us to do like something unusual is happening in our life we all are going through trials and we will all be going through trials till we're out of here ultimately we have to trust god no matter what no matter how foolish it seems trust god to abraham's obedience that was giving up what was the most important thing to him is where god continued to bless abraham any time that obedience stops in your life blessings are going to stop god is able to make all grace and blessings abound to us he's also able to make them stop and and the scripture tells us because thou has done this thing i'm going to bless you so this is what 40 45 years later from the very time that he was called out god says i'm gonna bless you for obeying me with this new commandment that i've given you we're not there yet saints he's still speaking to us the things that we need to be doing in our lives we need to continue to obey to continue to be blessed i've seen people walk away from obedience and their spiritual life just go down the tubes where once they just said they're in they're in they're safe everything's okay and slowly it just goes down the hill thing we can notice is that the natural always types to spiritual it takes a long time to receive the promises of god now we may and i'm speaking of this promise we could be healed just like that god could speak a word and it happened just like that but this nature change this promise that god has given us it types what abraham went through with isaac in receiving his promised son and it can take a long time in our lives and we don't want to be discouraged be not weary in well-doing for in due season thou shall reap if thou faint not and we got to keep pressing in amen don't give up god is faithful to every promise we need to keep believing amen now abraham begat isaac isaac begat jacob jacob he got joseph and this great nation it began to grow they landed in egypt where the children of god began to to multiply and and grow and and unfortunately they fell into bondage what did they do they begin to cry out to god call out to god i'll tell you that's what we need to do when we see the enemy creeping in trying to bring a bondage in our life we need to cry out to god amen don't just stay in that spot god brought them out with a mighty deliverance he took them through the red sea the wilderness and they continued to see god's faithfulness because god is always faithful even when you're murmuring and complaining god still remains faithful and here they came right up to the very land that god promised abraham this great land that where the nation was going to to be they spied out the promised land and they brought forth the evidence that it was a good land it was flowing with milk and honey it was exactly this was this was the land that god had originally promised abraham and to his seed so many years later they even brought forth fruit that it was a good land the grapes i i took a picture of brother mark yesterday by our little grape vineyard it's it's not a real big one but i'll tell you it had a lot of grapes on it more grapes than it's ever had big clusters but the clusters of grapes in this land were so great that it took two men holding it on a pole and bringing it back i mean it was so incredible that nobody could deny and you know how it is when you get in the presence of god and you feel the peace of god you feel the love of god you feel the forgiveness of god you know it's incredible amen but this land was filled with their enemies they were exceeding great giants and every gate of that city was inhabited with giants and the children of israel they looked like grasshoppers compared to these big giants comparably speaking that was their own testimony but they even testified that the giants felt the same way [Laughter] it was a mutual thing sometimes the devil will come in our life and just really try to get us down say you're not getting up this time and if we're not careful we'll agree with them this is what was happening even though god gave them this land the enemy wasn't just going to surrender it over to them because these giants weren't serving the lord jesus they were antichrist an antichrist spirit an anti-christ nature amen if they were going to take this land they were going to have to take it by force just like the kingdom of god it suffered violent and the violent have to take it by force god's promises are freely given you just have to go after them and you have to take them by force because it isn't like what we think is given it's like here it is it's possessed by an enemy and it's through faith in god that we inherit god's promises if you didn't need faith well then here it's just given to you like when your birthday comes you just get a gift you don't even have to believe you get it it's not how it is with the holy ghost it's not that kind of gift that's right now to get more faith you just need to feed on the word more the more you hear the word the greater chance that you will hear the voice of god because god is just interested in your love to him that's what he's looking for if you draw nigh to god he'll draw nigh to you if you just go through the motions if you just come to church because it's church if you just read because why you got to get my daily bread if that's all it's going to be you're going to come short of what god's really looking for now another thing we have to do to inherit these promises is try having a better attitude amen that's right the children of israel the majority of them did not have good attitudes they they were willing to dance in the spirit shout get excited and say yes we'll obey you but when it came down to the acid test they murmured they complained they said it's too hard to go to church brother by him said their right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass that's how important it is to have the right attitude it's not good enough to be here in church it's the kind of attitude we have amen if your attitude is right you will see god leading you to be an overcomer amen to be an overcomer his main goal is not to make you a millionaire is not to take away all of your problems you don't see that in in the bible the more problems that a person has the more chance that god has getting glory the situation was that god promised his children a land and it was preoccupied by an enemy god was giving away land that someone else was living in now you know it wouldn't be right if i took brother mark's wallet took the money out of it and gave it to brother ron it wouldn't be right but the enemy did not create the land god created the land but the enemy wasn't going to give it up it was preoccupied the children of israel would not have mined god's promise if it had not been occupied like it was virgin territory or some some wilderness they probably would have just marched right in but it wasn't it was preoccupied by giants there were there were villages there were cities there was there was people it was it was an established place already but this was no expedition led by lewis and clark amen this was a battle led by joshua and caleb it took generals to take the land it took someone with a willingness to fight for it someone that had faith in god they needed more than just a survey to get in they had 10 spies that went out and surveyed the land but surveying it doesn't get the job done you need to over come you need to overcome the land you need to have that right mental attitude that we're more than able to take possession of what god's given us god was leading his children to battle but the majority of god's children were unwilling to fight think about that the majority of god's children did not want to fight for the nature change they didn't want to fight for what was promised to them if god just don't hand it to me on the silver platter i'm not going to fight for it i'll tell you that is a horrible spirit think how that makes god feel he's given us the greatest thing that could he could give us which is his life his nature the living word amen and we're unwilling to fight our old nature to get it how does that make him feel we got to fight the good fight of faith fact of the matter is god's promises are filled with the enemy standing in the way all of them you can listen to brother branham's tapes and and when he would go to uh at the end to to have healing lines and and and talk to people in the audience that you can receive it sitting there standing right there he says only believe that's the battle to really truly believe amen but to believe as the scriptures have taught us not the way the devil teaches us the devil teaches us he believes and trembles amen so we've got to believe not like he believes we got to believe like the scriptures teach us to believe a submissive belief of i'm willing to do whatever you tell me to do an obedient belief problem was that the people of god were not filled with enough faith to bring the promise to pass and obviously we know this displeased god he it gave him so much wrath he sworn his wrath that they would not enter into the promised land because they were scared and they chose not they were not willing to crucify their flesh to take possession of the gate of the enemy i want you to think about this our attitude towards what god tells us to do is very important we could be found displeasing him by the mere fact of not willing to fight church attendance doesn't just put us up on you know thumbs up with god no there's we've got to take this word now that that we've been given so faithfully since we came to christ and began to apply it to our lives amen now because of the obedience of abraham hundreds of years ago joshua and caleb knew that the land was theirs he said because thou has done this thing and not withheld thy son that in blessing will bless him multiply and i'll multiply this he starts in the heaven as the sand which is upon the sea and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies oh abraham this was ching ching ching ching for a for uh joshua and caleb i mean they were the seed of abraham amen all because their father abraham obeyed the children the grandchildren the great grandchildren get blessed think about how important it is to start the cycle right now let the past be passed and start right now the cycle that's right amen it's possessing time for the children of god amen now there's a natural seed of abraham and there's a spiritual seed of abraham we are the spiritual seed of abraham and we have the same promise of possessing the gate of our enemy the same promise now we know that our enemy isn't our brother our sister our neighbors our boss our pastor we are we are our greatest enemy and and it's not our intentions it's it's it's not um it's not our personality it's not how we look it's that evil nature that hasn't been that's still in possession of our lives that's our enemy and you know the majority of most christians don't want to deal with it when we would try to go do good evil is right there keeping us from doing it and when we would do our very best not to do evil there's that old nature there that's enticing is to go ahead and do it anyways and this our this is the enemy that we got to kick out what we need is to get control of our gates to take possession of the pathways that enter in and that's not a gift you gotta learn to swing your sword you gotta learn to get on your knees and get your instructions from general jesus i'm going to say some things and i just want you to bear with me the promised land is not the holy ghost as you would think the holy ghost is a promise to every believer acts 2 38 and 239 but remember the holy ghost will fall upon the just and the unjust but jesus told us to be perfect with god's nature that's what he said when he said be perfect even as my father in heaven is perfect that we love our enemy that we have the same nature that he has that we go back to the same image now you just bear with me i'm not off on some limb but i'm trying to help us see a bigger picture the spiritual promised land is not the holy ghost and it's not your body the holy ghost could anoint you touch you bless you and yet never have possession of you the holy ghost can justify you it can sanctify you and even use you and never yet have possession of you even though these are the works of the holy ghost it is not our promised land your spiritual promised land is when the holy ghost has possession of your life preeminence and possession of your life hey look 12 spies went into that promised land 10 of them came out with fruits of the holy ghost scared as all get out two of them said that land's ours but they didn't possess it yet they could say god said it moses said it abraham said it it right down the line it's written in the word it's ours but you got to take it amen the holy ghost has got to take over in our lives that is the promised land it isn't just anointing us it isn't dance in the spirit speaking in tongues and being used and then not used it's a possession it's a seal until the day of your redemption what does god want he wants our hearts it's you and god living together it's when you have been set free from a selfish nature that you were born with that's no longer giant standing in your way how many has ever been delivered before okay so there is something in your life that you know was not holy and god delivered you wasn't that the most one of the most amazing experiences you had because before that time you tried to get rid of it you wished so many times it wasn't there you were condemned so many times because when you did it you knew it wasn't right and when god came and set you free of that well that was nothing but god himself amen now imagine every part of your life like that that's what we should be pressing towards that's what paul meant when he said i pressed towards the mark for the prize of the high calling not being satisfied always satisfied with just this and this and this god is looking for somebody's who's hungry for this and this and this and this because is that who he wants to spend eternity with i don't want giants staying in my way it's a process of sanctification and obedience in your life god takes preeminence of your faith through faith you inherit the promises well faith comes from god from hearing god it isn't we can't manufacture we can't you can't look at if you don't got no money in your account at the bank you can't go there and get money out there's no money to get out you got that's why they make debit cards now because too many people maxed their credit cards out god wants us to take possession of the gates of all these gates in her life sometimes we just let our our memory run random our affection just go over here our imagination we just let things happen in here and we think everything is still okay with us in god god wants to control that amen but he can't do it because it's through free more agency you have to say god i want a greater spirit in my heart right now because what's going on ain't right you can't just say well whatever whatever i don't i'm too busy right now it's got to mean more to you peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that word gift it means a um like a gratuity in other words god didn't have to give it to you it was by his free will his choice to give it to you and the bible says you shall receive this gift now that word receive isn't what we think it means it means to take it means to get a hold it means to seize and it means to attain you got to get a hold of it you're not going to drop it on you like a parachute our hearts have to get in a certain condition our hunger and our thirst after righteousness has to get in a certain condition we've got to seek him not just a little bit but with all of our hearts we've got to mean business this is this is the there is nothing greater than the life of god and we're going to try to attain it through a half-hearted heart not going to happen the promised land was not just the holy ghost but it's the holy ghost nature living inside of you so often we can be anointed with the holy ghost and say i got the holy ghost how often does anybody look at their life through the course of the day and say oh joy peace i just see it bubbling out all over me here's the nature here's the nature of god coming out that's what we should be seeing not some experience we had are you with me it is a gift given to us just like god gave the promised land to the children of israel but they needed to go possess it and so do we they needed faith to possess it we need faith to possess this giant monstrous devilish selfish nature first corinthians 5 verse 17 therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things have become new all right there's the promised land he's a new creature and all things are of god there's something that's taken place and do you see that god wants us to get on to get up and let's get going and stay there not up and down not his church and i gotta try a little bit harder but get serious about getting the nature change brother john my nature has been changed god took this away and he took that away okay but what about the other what about getting to the place where you can love everyone what about getting to the place where you're living for others you're laying down your life and that you're making time for god amen what about acting like god is really in us and he's possessing us and it's not you sometimes the way we talk the things we say the way we disrespect one another it shows that god's not in possession it doesn't matter what you say we there's enough in our life we should all be hungering and thirsty for more of god a amen creature means there's nothing left of the old creature now i understand we're not going to be perfect jesus christ walking that is not my message today my message today and always has been is that we should be pressing towards that because it's it's your attitude towards what god wants you to become that'll actually get you there but if you keep satisfying yourself with nobody can get there and nobody's perfect and you know i'm better than i was and you know what you're just missing the attitude that our paul had he never acted like he attained never acted like he uh possessed but he was always pressing towards we all should have that that's an easy thing to have it would be hard to just say well we all need to be perfect you know what i mean we just actually be miserable but you can be so imperfect but yet have an attitude of unpressing amen amen that's where you'll see god it's the humble he dwells with the humble with the broken with the contrite he's going to see them through you know the pharisees sadducees they were so i got it together their whole mission was you know to let others know how much they got they were never about pressing in they were all about judging others come on they thought they had the land because you know what the devil told them you got the land you got the land they didn't have the land when we're born again every believer is in a place that he's flown with milk and honey springs of living water it's the nature of god coming out but you can't give out what's not there and we're baptized one time by the holy ghost into the body one time one time but we need to be filled and refilled and filled and refilled because it has a way of just kind of leaking out or becoming a a dormant vessel and if if the devil can get you so busy so distracted that you won't got time to get more of the nature of god he's achieved his goal he's achieved his goal we need to have fruit of the land in our lives the fruit we don't want to be someone that's in and out of the land right that's true but take possession of the land now remember there were 12 spies 10 went in and out of the land yes i got it yes i believe yeah no i don't yes i'm having a heart yet if all you got is yeah i've had this experience with god god wants us to stay in the land to stay right there were you what you had because god has more for us if we're in and out of god's promises we're no more than the ten spies i know that's a strong statement but they went in they experienced it they came back with a good report with part of the word god god is true i felt these blessings in my god this is what but then they didn't feel they were able to really take possession of their whole bad nature because it was pretty bad they didn't want to face it if that's where we're going to be in our lives we're no better than the 10 spies but i wonder if we got any joshua and caleb's in here praise god now no matter how many joshua and caleb they're in here they couldn't change the attitude of the others so i want to tell you something here make sure you're not depending on somebody else to change your attitude take possession of your vessel through your attitude i always used to quote this all the time this quote by james that's all i know cameron huh ellen james allen he says the greatest discovery of any generation is that a man can alter his life by altering his attitude amen and you can alter your nature by just changing your attitude going from i don't know if i could do this i'm scared because i got all these things in my life i'm just going to make a bunch of excuses and say you can't do it just change that so i can do all things through christ just alter it alter the attitude because your attitude means everything it's free more agency that's really what it is galatians 5 22 this is the promised land but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law now that is the promise that is the holy ghost and it never changes it never changes and if that's living in you then you and god are one now i'm talking about abiding i'm not talking in and out god wants us to be living epistles right of all men not just certain people that we're going to connect with here and there amen all the time especially let me just say this especially when you're going through the darkest trial of your life because if people can see jesus in your life then oh they're seeing a god that's alive a god with power a god with might a god with strength and look at this i love verse 24. and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust they've taken possession of the gates possession you can't have the flow of god's holy spirit you can't be abiding in the land and not crucify your flesh you can walk into a meeting you can walk into the presence of god you can be blessed you can be anointed but it will never possess you if you don't take possession of your gates that's why we can be blessed on cloud nine for a week or two and then afterwards we're wondering what happened god is good he's good amen what we have to do is be willing to love him enough to crucify your flesh so he so we can stay in the land all right if we live in the spirit let us walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain glory how many has ever just really wanted to tension i mean he's not even being honest with me right now i mean he's lying right in church desirous of vainglory let's give the glory to jesus provoking one another you ever just want to dig at somebody because you just had something against them something you didn't like just kind of provoke them let us not be desirous of anger provoking one another and being one another and they that really belong to christ they have crucified the flesh they've taken possession that's how you take possession of the gates it's not when i say hey we need to do something about this situation i'm not saying hey we're being bad what i'm saying is the devil's bad we got to get control of that situation if we don't crucify the flesh we'll never ever possess the gate of the enemy john 14 20. at that day jesus speaking here we're talking about the promised land that that day you shall know that i am in the father and you and me and i in you now see this is the promised land it's when god has taken possession he that have my commandments and keepeth them no this is how we get into it he that loveth me he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him verse 23 jesus answered and said unto him if a man loves me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our what word is that our what a bolt not a visit you not just come and visit for a little bit not just to have a special anointing some service no an abode god wants to take a boat his interest is not just blessing you today his interest is blessing you every day john 17 20. neither pray i for these alone but for them also what shall believe on me through through their word that's us jesus is praying for us jesus prayed for us in this prayer that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me i've given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me and they that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as i as thou has loved me now this is the promised land this is a complete nature change when you become one with god god does not take on your nature not at all it abhors him we take on god's nature god is bringing us back to the same image it's a oneness with god it's when the holy ghost comes in now you've got to be saying i want it i want it i'm taking it i don't care about this this thing in my life that's is standing in my way i'm overcoming it it's an attitude it's abiding not visiting the abiding of the holy ghost in our life this is the spiritual promised land anybody can point and say yeah god did this i did this this happened i was slain in the spirit i was thrown over here i danced over here this happened to me god used my body i prophesied all those things are true but there's no possession and people get satisfied and say that's the evidence that's the evidence spoken tongues that's the evidence that is not the evidence the evidence is taking every word of god in your life that's the evidence god ain't gonna leave one part out man shall not live by barlow but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god now just a little simple i believe god's hidden simplicity the first thing our motive must be love you're going after this promised land your motive has to be love that's what jesus said if you got to you've got to love god and if you love god you will keep his commandments that's kind of love right because brother brown says you can love god every day with just out here and never get in here never have your free more agency to go to obey every word of god love is the key now one of the prophets said whatever you do get perfect love second our goal must be to obey every word of god now tell you when you love god his words are not grievous but when that love is missing it can be struggling to do the will of the lord we need to get serious with obeying god's word every word of god matters to god it needs to matter to us it's part of the process third god will take his abode if we do that he promised so set your love on him set your affection on him move towards god and then in the simplest little things that god has spoken to you may think it's not a big thing to god but just start obeying it this is part of the process that word abode it means residence it means dwelling we may visit a lot of places in life but most of us just have one dwelling can't serve two masters and god is not going to share your vessel with the giant ugly nature he's not going to do it you don't want to be around someone who's selfish self-centered arrogant wild uncontrollable that's our enemy and we need to take possession of that god is able to raise up stones onto abraham he is that doesn't mean he's going to do it he's looking for you the children of abraham to take the promise of god take possession of what he's already promised you i don't think we can get more too serious with god our faith can't just be in the blood of jesus christ to cover our sins they can't our faith must also be in the blood of jesus christ to give us power to overcome our ungodly nature the problem is we take part of god we want part of god but we don't have faith in the giants that are in our life the bleeding word is what changes us from glory on to glory we must open our freebore agency to all of god's word in order to for all of us to be changed second corinthians 3 17 now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty the lord only goes where there's liberty he's not going to come into our hearts if you know we just want to go do our own thing he's going to come where he's welcome why now he can fill anybody right but he he said i'm only gonna i'm gonna fill those that hunger and thirst after me but we all with open faces beholding us in the glass the glory of the lord that's when we come to church and we see ourselves in the word are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord so we might as well kick out of the door i repented i got baptized them in the body well that's great now let's talk about the change the change from glory to glory into the same image by the way not the same knowledge remember that tree of knowledge has the knowledge of the word knows the mysteries how's that but i want to be changed the living word of god is what changes us and you know the difference between this word and the living word this word the bible says kills us the living word is what brings life to us that's why for us to be satisfied with just hearing what's being preached naturally is only going to destroy us and bring condemnation down the road there's got to be something that lies within us that is hungering for what's being spoken behind the pulpit to be hungering for inside of our hearts and our lives something that an attitude that we got to have that lord i'm going to take this word i'm not just going to just belittle it by not paying attention to it but i'm going to take it home i'm going to embrace it i'm going to love it i'm going to be going to believe it means so much to you lord that's what brings about change he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave him power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name now it's easy to receive him it's hard to receive his commandments i can receive what christ did for me at calvary but to receive that i got to obey the word that's hard that's why jesus said if you love me you've got to keep those commandments it shows the reciprocating of love the interest that we have about following this word in areas that we're not following means everything to god in the relationship he's interested okay you've been changed have you not we all can say we've been changed here but we just read in the scripture where the spirit of the lord is he has something on his mind that he wants to change us more from glory unto glory amen building up to the statue of a perfect man more into his image it it i wish it could happen just through the osmosis of hearing the word of god we just put all headphones on and stay in our homes and hear but it's not like that there's a realness that takes place which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor of the will man but of god don't try to receive christ without receiving his will do not try to receive christ without receiving his will if you do you will be viewed by jesus christ as a thief and a robber all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers they want eternal life but they're not interested in the will of god i know this is some strong stuff but look when you're not here you got demons telling you to lay back don't worry somehow you're just going to be changed in the twinkling of an eye worry about it then no death doesn't change as brother branham said it doesn't change the condition of the soul it's changed here we're the ones that got to get interested in changing it praise the lord now most of us don't want to talk about the giants in our life nor do we want to deal with them we don't want to talk about anger issues arrogant issues uncontrollable issues selfish issues unthankful issues disobedient issues unfaithful issues we don't want to talk about vices or habits in our life most of the time we want to hear anything but taking possession of those things that's why we can all rally behind some mystery something about what god has done for us and i'm i'm happy with that but we need to get serious about taking the land look those 10 giants they all they were they were so deceived those children of israel they were deceived because they believed not and he said he would turn those over who would believe not he has blinded the eyes of the world that believe now we've got to believe in this nature change we've got to they were so deceived they they thought they could serve god outside of the promised land i don't really i can serve god without nature change that's what they were saying look if that's foolish virgin amen that's not wise we got to go on and get the nature change stay away from saying i got the holy ghost why would you say that i don't understand why you would say it who are you trying to convince how about just demonstrate the nature of christ on how you talk how you act what you do with your life everybody will know everybody will know god wants our old nature changed we have a part to play god has a part to play we can't take possession if we're afraid to deal with those things if you get uncomfortable about those things you don't want to talk about them you want to push them under the rug you you don't want to deal with them come on now nobody's calling anybody out here nobody i'm not saying the devil's not here telling everybody he's talking about me but i respect this pulpit too much to ever talk about one person behind the pulpit that is not the right spirit that's god's business but we're afraid to deal with things that we should be dealing with and you know what that means that means you're afraid of the giants you've got to say we're more than able we're more than able to get the nature of christ we're more than able to to be filled with love to too lay down our life for the brethren we're more than able see without the attitude how can we possess it it's got to start with a free more agency you've got to believe the promises of god if you're always see if you keep looking at well i've tried to get rid of this i tried to get brother john you don't know how many times i tried to get rid of this and i can't get rid of it that's you trusting in you but the promise says that you can't do all things through christ we're we are more than able to get the nature of christ how many joshua caleb's do we got here do we do we believe it do we believe it we we should be sending a resounding amen this this word is for me if it ain't for anybody else it's for me let's take possession of the very nature of jesus christ in order to do that we got to take possession of the gates the things that that come in and out of our lives the things that control our lives i've read this before i want to read it fast and please pray for me because i want to finish up today and and the and the more you get you get the word the more i can keep going the more you get stuck on something hopefully he didn't get stuck somewhere romans 6 verse uh chapter 6 verse 16 says know you not to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servant you are to me obey whether to sin and death or obedience to righteousness so every moment that you get a thought into your head what you do with that thought you either believe it or you don't you just a decision has to be made and if it's the wrong spirit then you're obeying the wrong spirit yes yeah but if you yield to the right spirit the right thoughts let god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but now but ye have obeyed from the heart what what did you obey from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered unto you we come to church to get the doctrine and if you obey it a change happens a change happens god is hidden in simplicity romans chapter 6 verse number 12 let us let not sin therefore reign in your morbid see now you you have a choice here that you should obey it in the lust thereof let it not you see things in your life some aggressive nature something that's just not right some forwardness some some lust whatever it would be you have a choice to control it to not let it rain there you have to you have to learn to to crucify the flesh to to mortify the deeds of the body to take possession of those gates don't wait for some special speaker to come by or some great service for you feeling the presence of you would come up and you get prayed for imagine you were the only person left on the planet that believed god no one would pray for you no special service to go to but you know you have enough to make it god's still here it's you and god you don't need anybody else god changes your nature not another man it's god just take his yoke upon you learn of him be willing to take his nature neither he yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead amen i'm i'm of the joshua and caleb's and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god for sin shall not have dominion over you for you're not under the law but under grace adam and eve had dominion over everything and our old nature put us under the elements of this world that's why our nature was to deceive and to lie and to trick and to mislead and not say it like it is come on but the promise is that that shall not have dominion over us and the way for that to happen is to let god have dominion in your life when god has dominion god is the one that conducts the life he's the one that that says it like it is we will take possession through love to your love for god that's it i tell you if you your soul you ever been so in love with somebody you just do anything for them you ever just been so filled with hate you just never want to talk to that person again it's simple it's through love that we will attain the land amen i mean joshua and caleb they were of another spirit they were so in love with with with god with the word they they just believed it god has bestowed a great love upon us the bible says and that love is drawing us into his image it's pulling us into his image that's why the prophet said whatever you do get perfect love now god chose us for one reason the bible says well he did he said i didn't choose you because you were a small number believe me this message is small a number compared to denominations i said but i didn't choose you because you were great in number he says i chose you because i love you i love you he loves us this this whole word no matter how much it hurts and no matter how we we feel that this is this is not helping me this is the love of god first john chapter 3 verse 2 beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he show up here we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is we shall be like and we're going to be in the same image now where are you going to see them inside of you inside inside of your motives your objectives inside of your desires inside of how you see the nature of christ being distributed out through these three parts of you being preserved blameless into the coming of the lord are you with me and every man that has this hope in him do you have that hope you're purifying yourself you're working on purifying yourself even as you already are pure right but you're still working on purifying yourself don't make this difficult this is not a a black and white you're in or out we're in a process we're not talking about just because we're you hear a a ministry here that says press in doesn't mean you you you haven't started doesn't mean you haven't attained to certain things but even if you have attained to certain things paul said you need to have the same attitude as if you haven't attained to it not every man has an attitude like peter a lot of people do oh i'm ready lord i'm ready we got to have an attitude of pressing in if you have this hope that you're going to be ready you're going to press in until you see christ manifested in the parts of your life that you haven't seen him in the past brother branham says we put out an atmosphere of what's inside of us that's all we can do you want things different on the outside of you change the inside as a man thinketh in his heart so is he amen i just i need to skip some things but you know how many uh how many is feeling good this this morning it's okay if you stand up shake wake up do whatever you got to do i don't want you to miss this but you go back listen to it i suppose brother bam said in the message souls that are in prison now he said that's why we're baptized into his name that we might come forth in his name in his death and his resurrection that will we will rise again testify to the world that we have new life testifying to the world that we have new life that the old man is dead we're going to testify that the old man is dead we buried the first nature you notice you've taken possession of the land you're not in and out the first nature is gone and now we are the nature of him he lives in us and we don't do our own will we do his will we don't think our own thoughts that's why we should never say i'm going to go here i'm going to go there i'm going to do this i'm going to do that what's going on here the mind that was in christ jesus is in every believer jesus said in meth or hebrews chapter 10 verse 7 just just quoting that uh then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me what to do thy will of god that's what the nature change is the nature change is not just stopping doing bad things but it's actually doing the will of god amen acts 5 32 says and we are witnesses of these things and so is the holy ghost whom god has given to him to them that obey him you want more holy ghost obey more god gives his divine nature to them that obey him there's a part that we play the part of crucifying our carnal nature denying our will the part of believing it will happen in other words exercising our faith i always remember the story that uh sister uh uh sue bailey when she gave her heart to the lord jesus and brother brother bill and and uh they were still had habits hanging on them and they knew they were bad habits but every every time they get down to pray they still prayed as if if god was going to deliver them and god delivered them and that's the way you need to believe you just to be serious with god be sincere with god mean business because if you don't want it enough it's just not going to happen it's not going to happen we pay we play the part of praise and worship we thank god in other words for delivering us for filling us now we're not bigger than the devil we're not going to defeat the devil in some psychology some intellectual knowledge of the scriptures we're just like grasshoppers in the sight of devils remember they said jesus i know paul i know but who are you we're not stronger and we're not wiser than the devil but greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world our faith is in christ the word amen we're more than conquerors to him that loved us we can do all things through christ and we need to believe that peter was prayed for by jesus that his faith would fail not and that when he was converted now jesus prayed for us as well we read it and when he prayed for our oneness he prayed for our conversion for that nature change and i love this because no matter how much satan wants to sift us like wheat we had the greatest one that could ever pray for us pray for us and you got to believe he prayed for you [Music] not i wish he did i hope he did i think no you've got to believe he prayed for me he's going to see you through god is still making men in his image with his divine nature ii peter we're almost done you just please bear with me according as his divine nature uh according to his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to glory and future virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises and that by these we might be partakers of what this is the land that god promised us the divine nature having the corruption that is in the world through lust see satan wants us to be content with the old nature in our life because we still got god he doesn't want us to be focusing on the things on more of god's divine nature but if you love god don't don't you want more of him in you yes let the promise let this word that god has promised come into your heart not not just your mind but your heart i got a couple a couple quotes here to read one is from end time sign seed brother branham says and by accepting then his word look at the simplicity of this and by accepting then his word brings life and brings christ back into us because christ is the word the spoken word and it will mature if you re if you can receive it he says you that sick accept it believe it it's got to mature it will come forth in its season it's got to so i don't care if you don't feel it it's okay you don't feel it you should better testify you received it and and there's a difference of just receiving it in your head and receiving now you need your head you need these gates right it's got to come through these amen to get in here that free more agency this this this word is real to me lord this word is so real to me i want it down on the inside in the message greatest battle ever fought brother man said it must be accepted in the mind then it's believed in the heart then the word of god becomes a reality then every senses of the soul and body is scoured out with the holy spirit then your senses of god your conscience of god everything that godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing that can rise up possession but if that channel it but if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and been filled on the inside with the holy ghost that don't even come into memory no more miss jones and what she did you ever just been tempted to talk about somebody that's not the holy ghost i i was doing that when i was in the world i don't do that right if god puts anybody on your heart it's so you pray for them remember you all remember brother lafontaine i should have told you i had a lot of hay on my fork like brother lafontaine used to say when he'd come one time brother lafontaine was ministering he was telling us about this woman that had this uh habit of just talking about somebody and she'd start out by saying oh praise god brother john do you remember sister celincel oh glory to god she had this problem if we're going to talk about somebody let's say something good let's esteem them better than ourselves if we can't do that bow your head and pray you don't need to open your mouth you're just letting the devil in when you open your mouth to say something negative about something you're letting the devil in he says it's you and god together and nobody else but you too see oneness that nature change he says there you are there's your battle keep him at the beginning stop him dead in the track if it ain't how long you can make the war linger stop it right now don't be satisfied with the things that are stuck in your life get serious about getting them out if you'll come and you'll keep them memories and conscious and everything thinking about well i might fail it might not be right he says don't do that at all you throw everything aside and open up the channel and say god your word is eternally true and it's for me if the whole church fails if the whole world fails yet i can't fail because i'm taking your word he said that's the battle that's the thing amen let's stand together i'm just going to read romans chapter 8 verse 17 17 18-19 and if children then heirs heirs of god join heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together now that suffering is we've got to be willing to take possession of the gates be willing to crucify the flesh be willing to die out to ourself that's the only way that we'll be glorified together that's the part we play for i reckon that these sufferings that we're going through of this present time they're not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god defense since the time of the beginning till now all of earth has been waiting for us to manifest that do adam and eve and it's in your hands how to get there you've been i believe the lord has shown us in these services that our soul is the thing that we ought to be focusing on and the nature is what needs to be changed so so i want to see and hear more testimonies about our nature changing what's wrong with that testimony my nature's changing i mean those of us that had habits you know bad habits and god took them away we didn't mind testifying to that well why not testify the other things maybe swear words that come out every now and then they don't come out anymore what you think is not a big thing testify of it because it builds faith your testimony builds faith in the church builds faith in others this word is is real and god god wants us to manifest him and i know that we may look at this this seriously man we got a long ways to go brother john i don't know if this is attainable you got to stop looking at this as far as your ability if you do you're just going to get scared and walk out of the promised land you've got to look at this and say whatever god said he promised it's going to happen i don't know how but it's going to happen you got to walk out with that faith will you do that all right let's bow our hearts our heavenly fathers we come to the close of this this series and this service lord only you can make the word real and i pray for every one of my brothers and sisters here lord this is your sheep you are the flock of the sheep lord for those that are live streaming for those that will be watching if they identify themselves as uh the bride of jesus christ the elect lord may you bless them with the power of revelation of this this message lord this that they will rentlessly put their efforts into the one thing that's worth ten thousand worlds i know our lives are busy i know there's things that we go through physically but oh god i pray that you would bless each one of us with a a a greater portion of the power of the holy ghost to be working towards the things that you want us to be working towards lord lord we are give you our very best liberty in our life we're asking lord jesus that together this oneness taking possession of our vessel lord that more of you could live in our hearts give us that faith in your name lord to cast out everything that's wrong in our life everything that lord you've spoken to us it's not pleasing and not right help us to be so in love with you lord that we just get serious about those things and spend more time in prayer spend more time being prepared to receive not just a dead letter at church but a living word granite lord jesus father we commit ourselves to you as the bride of jesus christ as the predestinated of god as those sons and daughters that may not yet appear right now but we are believers that we will be just like you lord we will see you in our lives in the nature of our lives we love you we thank you
