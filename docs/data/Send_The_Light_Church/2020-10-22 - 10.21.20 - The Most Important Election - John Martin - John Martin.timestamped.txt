[1:31] amen and i know you believe that
[1:35] you certainly wouldn't be here if you
[1:37] were just coming to hear me
[1:41] i mean maybe for the first time or the
[1:44] second time but after you see what i
[1:46] am then you're not going to come just
[1:48] for me because i'm not worth listening
[1:50] to
[1:51] but jesus is here his word
[1:55] is here his presence is here and he
[1:58] promised to do exceedingly above all
[2:00] that we could ask or even think of him
[2:04] amen i say it's a privilege to be
[2:06] gathered together while the doors are
[2:07] still open
[2:09] no one day things are only getting
[2:11] harder and harder
[2:13] and one day we won't have this grand
[2:16] privilege to be gathered together like
[2:18] this
[2:20] the hours getting darker and darker so
[2:22] we give the lord
[2:23] thanks amen turn with me if you would to
[2:25] the book of
[2:27] first thessalonians chapter one
[2:30] first thessalonians chapter one i want
[2:32] to say uh it's an
[2:33] honor a privilege to get to meet
[2:37] brother mark's friend brother jacob
[2:40] god bless you thank you for being with
[2:42] us and we pray that god would just
[2:45] bless you exceedingly amen
[2:50] amen we want to continue to pray for
[2:52] those that are not
[2:53] among us um
[2:56] the different needs and things that god
[2:59] would be with them such trying times
[3:01] we're living in god bless you all for
[3:03] for making your way to god's house today
[3:07] pray that god
[3:08] would bless you before we begin reading
[3:10] the scriptures let's look to the author
[3:12] in prayer
[3:13] heavenly father we thank you that you've
[3:15] given us health and strength to be
[3:17] here in your house today lord
[3:20] we are so grateful that you've placed a
[3:23] desire
[3:24] inside of a heart to want to be here
[3:26] there's many healthy people
[3:28] that could be here that could be
[3:30] assembled somewhere
[3:32] but lord the lord that desire
[3:36] is small that desire is missing so we
[3:39] cherish the desire you place in our
[3:41] heart for you
[3:42] lord to be attracted to you to be
[3:45] attracted
[3:46] to becoming more in your image and
[3:48] knowing that you've given us a five-fold
[3:50] ministry
[3:51] lord to bring us to that place of
[3:53] perfection
[3:55] lord as we go through these trying times
[3:57] with
[3:58] not having as many of the fivefold
[4:01] ministry lord we just pray that you make
[4:04] up the difference in our little church
[4:06] lord may you come and just anoint each
[4:09] heart and each life and give them what
[4:10] they have need of lord
[4:12] supply the faith for whatever need that
[4:16] they would have
[4:17] lord we commit this service in your
[4:19] hands now and pray that you bless
[4:21] not only the reading of the word lord
[4:24] but the hearing of the word
[4:26] we ask this now in jesus name and give
[4:28] you praise
[4:29] amen amen first thessalonians chapter
[4:32] one starting with verse number one paul
[4:35] and silvanus and timothy timothy
[4:38] timotheus

[4:42] which is in god the father in
[4:44] our lord jesus christ grace be unto you
[4:48] and peace from god our father
[4:50] and the lord jesus christ we give thanks
[4:53] to god always
[4:54] for you all making mention of you in our
[4:57] prayers
[4:58] remembering without ceasing your work of
[5:01] faith
[5:02] your labor of love and patience of hope
[5:05] in our lord jesus christ in the sight of
[5:07] god
[5:07] and our father knowing brethren
[5:10] beloved your election of
[5:14] god for our gospel came not unto you in
[5:17] word only but
[5:18] also in power and in the holy ghost and
[5:21] in much assurance says
[5:23] ye know what matter of men we were among
[5:26] you for your sake
[5:27] and he became followers of us and of our
[5:30] lord
[5:30] having received the word in much
[5:32] affliction
[5:34] with joy of the holy ghost
[5:37] so that ye were in samples to all that
[5:40] believed in macedonia
[5:41] and akai for from you
[5:45] sounded out the word of the lord not
[5:48] only in macedonian
[5:49] and acadia but also
[5:53] in every place your faith to god's word
[5:56] is spread abroad so that we need
[5:58] not speak anything it's a good testimony
[6:02] for they themselves show of us what
[6:04] matter of entering
[6:06] in we had unto you and how he turned to
[6:10] god
[6:10] from idols to serve the living and true
[6:13] god and to wait for his son from heaven
[6:16] whom he raised from the dead even jesus
[6:19] which delivered us
[6:21] from the wrath to come amen god bless
[6:24] you may be seated
[6:30] the most important thing
[6:33] the word of god man shall not live by
[6:38] natural things but by every word that
[6:41] persecuted
[6:42] the mouth of god it's not just our daily
[6:44] bread
[6:46] our natural bread that is uh but
[6:48] anything natural that we put a lot of
[6:50] emphasis
[6:51] in men shall not live by natural things
[6:55] but by
[6:56] every word that perceive the mouth of
[6:59] god we need
[7:00] every word amen amen so this
[7:03] this little chapter here that we read
[7:06] it's uh
[7:06] we need this chapter need the nuggets in
[7:10] here
[7:12] there's a presidential election coming
[7:14] up
[7:16] i picked up my my ballot today
[7:21] for voting and
[7:26] the presidential election for the next
[7:28] four years is
[7:30] is going to be counted very soon
[7:33] the election day is is the third i
[7:36] believe
[7:37] and the people of the united states of
[7:38] america will elect
[7:41] their next president
[7:44] there are great hopes on both sides of
[7:46] the race yet
[7:47] no one really knows who's going to be
[7:49] elected
[7:51] the devil's got this world so messed up
[7:53] anything could happen
[7:55] even the unexpected i mean they they
[7:58] talk about uh
[8:00] uh tampering with the the
[8:03] the the
[8:06] the votes and things and and
[8:10] you just you just don't know right
[8:13] and that's why both candidates are out
[8:15] there
[8:16] and they're giving their best speeches
[8:21] and saying what they think is the best
[8:23] thing
[8:25] but who whoever gets elected is
[8:27] certainly going to know
[8:30] they've been elected they're going to
[8:32] know
[8:33] they're present usually they do some
[8:34] sort of celebration
[8:38] um and and they're going to exercise all
[8:41] the power
[8:42] that a president can until then
[8:45] uh these candidates can can talk about
[8:48] what they would do and how they're going
[8:50] to lower taxes and
[8:52] how they're going to uh do this and do
[8:54] that
[8:55] and they they make their claims or make
[8:57] their promises but they yet
[8:59] can't do anything because they're not
[9:02] elected yet
[9:04] but after they're elected they're going
[9:06] to be able to accomplish
[9:08] their agenda we hope that their agenda
[9:11] is what they say
[9:15] it's been stated that this presidential
[9:18] election coming up in november could be
[9:20] the most
[9:20] important in american history
[9:24] i'd like to entitle this message the
[9:26] most important election
[9:28] and for a subject tonight knowing your
[9:30] election i want to take our scripture
[9:33] from verse 4 knowing brethren beloved
[9:36] your election of god
[9:41] now until the election the candidates
[9:43] aren't really going to know they're
[9:45] elected so they're going to have to wait
[9:48] just like
[9:49] a lot of believers who really don't know
[9:52] their election
[9:54] they simply just don't know they've been
[9:56] elected or not
[9:57] right they're a christian but they don't
[10:00] know that they've been elected they
[10:01] don't know if they've been
[10:02] chosen because that's what that word
[10:04] means elected means
[10:06] chosen many believers don't understand
[10:09] the election of god they don't know
[10:12] their election
[10:13] some feel they they'll never know
[10:17] uh if they've been elected until the
[10:19] rapture happens
[10:22] some feel they're they're probably
[10:24] elected because they've accepted the
[10:26] message
[10:29] like they've been elected to the message
[10:31] knowing the prophet the truth that he
[10:33] brought us that that's
[10:34] that entitles them as as feeling that
[10:37] they're elected
[10:40] some feel they've probably uh
[10:43] are because they've made a commitment to
[10:46] god i
[10:46] i'm elected i know i'm elected because i
[10:49] made a commitment i
[10:50] have repented i got baptized and i've
[10:52] started on
[10:53] with the lord
[10:57] some have have made some good changes in
[10:59] their life
[11:01] by these commitments that they feel
[11:03] they've been elected
[11:05] and unfortunately some believers simply
[11:07] don't care to know
[11:08] whether they're elected or not
[11:12] if they if they found out if they were
[11:14] elected it would it would probably give
[11:16] them more responsibility and they just
[11:17] don't really want that
[11:22] so to this day they walk around not
[11:25] knowing their election
[11:29] and this is the most important election
[11:36] second peter chapter one verse nine
[11:39] second peter chapter one verse 9 but he
[11:42] that lacketh these things
[11:47] is blind and cannot see afar off
[11:51] and has forgotten that he was purged
[11:54] from his
[11:54] old sins now i'll tell you something my
[11:57] precious brother and sister
[11:59] you never want to forget calvary
[12:03] what calvary meant to you what it did
[12:05] for you how it changed your attitude
[12:07] it changed your direction it changed
[12:10] what you wanted to do in life
[12:12] because satan would like nothing better
[12:14] than to come and try to present you
[12:16] a better christian
[12:21] one with a form of godliness one with
[12:23] just a
[12:25] a good boy and do good things
[12:29] something that you can accomplish on
[12:31] your own with your good deeds
[12:35] anything outside of calvary will come to
[12:38] naught
[12:39] calvary must change our nature it must
[12:42] be behind the good deeds
[12:47] we're for the rather brethren verse 10
[12:50] give diligence to make your calling
[12:54] an election sure
[12:58] for if you do these things you shall
[13:00] never
[13:01] fall i looked at that word
[13:04] diligence it means to use speed
[13:09] use speed put the pedal
[13:13] to the metal
[13:16] to make effort to be prompt or earnest
[13:20] to endeavor to labor to study
[13:23] in other words don't just think it
[13:25] automatically happens you're in a race
[13:27] you haven't been
[13:28] elected just because you got in the race
[13:31] you need to
[13:31] to give diligence to make sure to use
[13:34] speed
[13:35] and to find out whether you've been
[13:37] elected or not
[13:41] the fact remains that we're all in a
[13:42] race
[13:45] some are running and some are standing
[13:48] around watching others
[13:51] some are using speed and some are taking
[13:54] it easy
[13:56] some are making effort and some are not
[13:59] wanting to suffer
[14:01] some are prompt some barely make it to
[14:04] church
[14:06] some labor some are lazy
[14:09] some study some are enjoying the
[14:11] pleasures of sin
[14:13] pleasures of flesh you understand
[14:16] there's
[14:17] and still calling themselves the same
[14:22] your flesh and your spirit are running
[14:26] against one another for the election
[14:31] the way the tree falls that's the way it
[14:33] lies right
[14:35] if we're not diligent about how we're
[14:38] running
[14:39] our race our opponent will end up
[14:42] winning
[14:42] the election right many
[14:46] many start out but they couldn't keep up
[14:49] with the pace
[14:53] the devil ain't giving up on us we have
[14:56] to put him
[14:57] in his place
[15:01] we have to he's not he's not going to
[15:04] give up
[15:05] he's filled with so much venom and
[15:07] hatred towards god
[15:10] he knows if he can grab a soul he's
[15:12] making god more angry
[15:18] the flesh really wants liberty
[15:21] to do what it wants right
[15:27] the spirit radio wants to see it
[15:29] crucified so god can have his way in
[15:32] their lives
[15:33] that's the battle that's going on
[15:37] this is the most important election you
[15:39] will ever
[15:40] ever be in don't run the race as one
[15:44] that beateth
[15:45] air not really knowing what you're doing
[15:48] in other words
[15:50] don't run with as the bible said
[15:52] uncertainly
[15:54] that means ambiguous
[15:57] ambiguously or
[16:00] variably unsure unpredictable unsettled
[16:04] undetermined in other words you're not
[16:07] all in
[16:08] you're kind of like lukewarm not hot
[16:15] don't run the race haphazardly you're
[16:19] going to lose the election
[16:22] wherefore the rather brethren give
[16:24] diligence to make
[16:26] your calling and your election
[16:29] sure you can't guess
[16:33] at whether you're elected or not
[16:36] don't guess give diligence make sure
[16:40] you get elected you don't see somebody
[16:43] running
[16:44] for uh an election and they're just
[16:47] putzing around
[16:51] oh yeah i'll just you know i'll have all
[16:54] my
[16:54] workers do it for me you know they'll
[16:57] get the word out
[17:01] they don't get up to the podium and
[17:03] speak and say well you know if you
[17:05] elected me
[17:07] i'd make sure we'd have a holiday called
[17:10] the popcorn
[17:11] day
[17:15] it's not a game so
[17:18] anybody that's serious about being
[17:20] elected they're they're seriously
[17:22] working for it it's not given to them
[17:28] and i just want to be real clear we
[17:31] don't
[17:31] choose god god chooses us he elects us
[17:34] but that doesn't mean we can sit around
[17:37] with an attitude
[17:38] of nothing it's it's contrary to the
[17:42] word we need to give
[17:43] diligence to make our calling and our
[17:46] election
[17:47] sure there's something that we have to
[17:49] do about it
[17:51] because satan's going like this all the
[17:53] time at us and telling us
[17:54] you're elected you don't have to do
[17:56] nothing just go to church
[18:01] that's not scripture
[18:05] jesus said many are called
[18:09] but few are elected
[18:12] only a few are elected only few
[18:16] are chosen the majority of the believers
[18:19] don't give diligence to make sure about
[18:22] it
[18:24] they're assuming yes
[18:28] man you'll come to me in that day lord
[18:30] lord i thought i was elected
[18:33] i thought i was chosen
[18:38] many believers feel they've been called
[18:40] into the race and
[18:41] absolutely but they really don't know
[18:45] if they've been elected to the wedding
[18:50] one of the great dangers of not knowing
[18:52] your election is you
[18:54] won't make yourselves ready for the
[18:57] marriage
[18:58] you're in limbo
[19:02] just kind of following others
[19:05] you know we're all following something
[19:09] you're going to make a decision to
[19:10] follow christ or you're going to follow
[19:11] another human being
[19:13] and there's so much danger in that
[19:15] because god will only let you follow a
[19:17] human so long
[19:20] and after a while i don't care who that
[19:21] human is it's going to begin to stink
[19:28] god wants us to keep our eyes on him
[19:34] we will fail one another
[19:37] you fail me
[19:41] you fail me you fail me when you don't
[19:45] say amen
[19:49] i fail you when i don't tell you what
[19:52] you want to hear
[19:59] we need to keep our eyes on jesus
[20:04] now just because we've been called
[20:05] doesn't mean we've been elected yet
[20:08] it's important to understand that we've
[20:11] got to get diligent about it
[20:14] now i'm not saying that you
[20:17] choose to be elected
[20:22] but i am saying that you have a part to
[20:25] play
[20:27] you have you got to play that part
[20:31] look at esther there were many women
[20:35] that were called to be the elected queen
[20:39] but only one was chosen now can you
[20:41] imagine
[20:42] if esther just said oh i know that i am
[20:46] elected
[20:47] but she never went through the the
[20:48] purification process
[20:52] but she just had the attitude of oh i
[20:55] know i'm elected
[20:56] i'm elected seed
[21:00] but she never subjected herself to what
[21:02] the king
[21:03] required of her
[21:07] she would have never made it
[21:10] so we can't just walk around
[21:14] and claim that we're
[21:17] elected with an attitude and and never
[21:20] subject
[21:21] herself to the purification process
[21:26] i believe the elected will go through
[21:28] that process amen
[21:31] and you have to force yourself to do it
[21:35] you don't want to do it
[21:40] but that's what makes us chosen
[21:44] elected of god she's the only one that
[21:47] will really
[21:48] really do exactly
[21:51] what the word says the other one
[21:55] added their own ideas
[21:58] along with the word and that's
[22:02] that's not a good characteristic to have
[22:05] amen it's your job to make sure
[22:09] that you've been chosen don't
[22:12] assume that you are
[22:15] make sure if you know that you've been
[22:18] called then it's time
[22:20] to give diligence to give speed
[22:23] to put forth effort to make sure that
[22:26] you're elected
[22:29] to make sure it's important
[22:34] if you never do find out that you've
[22:36] been elected
[22:38] you'll never take your rightful position
[22:41] in christ
[22:43] you'll never get the revelation if you
[22:46] never get the revelation that you've
[22:48] been elected you'll never start using
[22:50] your power as an elected official
[22:55] imagine if they just continue to not
[22:58] count the ballots and and and and never
[23:01] say
[23:02] which state won and it was always
[23:04] confusion
[23:05] and a whole year went and america never
[23:08] knew
[23:08] who their president was they would never
[23:12] be able to exercise
[23:14] their power as an elected official
[23:17] because they just don't know who's been
[23:18] elected
[23:20] that's why we've got to know we're
[23:22] elected because we've been given
[23:24] god-given powers
[23:26] [Music]
[23:32] as an elected official you have power to
[23:34] execute things
[23:37] you have power to make decisions that
[23:40] you couldn't make before
[23:43] you can the president can either
[23:46] dismantle the army or beef it up
[23:50] he's got those powers to control things
[23:54] as an elected official but if you don't
[23:57] know
[23:58] you're elected
[24:02] just call it but you don't know you're
[24:04] chosen
[24:08] as a christian as an elected official
[24:11] you can tell the devil to step aside
[24:16] i'm making a new law in my life
[24:20] this is what i'm going to do i'm going
[24:21] to stop doing that and i'm going to
[24:23] start doing that
[24:24] because you know that you're elected if
[24:26] you're just a
[24:27] uh well i'm a believer i've been called
[24:32] devil just push you around
[24:36] jesus said all power is given unto me
[24:41] i hold the keys as the supreme judge
[24:45] of hell death in a grave of a victory
[24:48] amen he holds those keys
[24:52] you know what jesus did with that power
[24:56] he gave it to his elected officials on
[24:58] the day of pentecost
[25:01] it's true that he gave his disciples
[25:04] power to cast out devils
[25:06] and heal all manner of diseases but when
[25:09] it came down to properly properly
[25:12] witnessing for jesus they did not
[25:14] possess
[25:15] the power to do it
[25:18] no sir
[25:25] without knowing they were elected
[25:29] they fought against one another they
[25:32] bragged about who was the greatest
[25:34] they were willing to fight physically
[25:36] but not spiritually
[25:38] they cursed they denied even knowing
[25:41] jesus
[25:42] they deserted him at the end when he
[25:44] needed him the most
[25:48] and they were all called peter followed
[25:51] me
[25:54] they called him and they came they
[25:55] dropped everything but they did not know
[25:58] they were elected
[26:02] jesus said in acts chapter 1 verse 8 but
[26:04] ye shall receive
[26:05] power after the holy ghost has come upon
[26:08] you
[26:08] and you shall be proper witnesses
[26:13] unto me you shall be my
[26:16] elected officials
[26:20] and by this unconditional love that
[26:23] you'll manifest
[26:24] all men are going to know that you're my
[26:26] elected officials
[26:31] as a united states citizen you are
[26:33] protected by our constitution
[26:36] as written in 1787 with the same spirit
[26:40] that wrote our declaration of
[26:41] independence in 1776
[26:44] which states we hold these truths to be
[26:47] self-evident that all men
[26:49] are created equal and that they are
[26:52] endowed with their creator by their
[26:55] creator with
[26:56] certain unalienable rights
[27:00] that among these are life liberty and
[27:02] the pursuit of happiness
[27:05] that to secure these rights governments
[27:08] are instituted among men deriving
[27:12] their just powers from the constant of
[27:15] the govern
[27:17] that when any form of government becomes
[27:20] destructive of these ends it is the
[27:23] right of the people
[27:24] to alter or to abolish it and to
[27:28] institute new government laying its
[27:31] foundation
[27:32] on such principles and organizing its
[27:35] powers in such form
[27:37] as to them shall most likely to affect
[27:41] their safety
[27:42] and happiness isn't that beautiful
[27:48] that is uh that's what we're protected
[27:51] by
[27:52] but you know the devil wants to alter
[27:53] that
[27:55] i just say as an elected official jesus
[27:59] christ
[28:00] we hold the truth of god in our hearts
[28:04] our creator jesus christ has endowed us
[28:08] with power of the holy ghost
[28:10] unavailable rights that among these
[28:13] are the life of god living in me
[28:17] liberty to worship him from the dictates
[28:20] of our heart
[28:22] freedom from the flesh victory over sin
[28:26] joy unspeakable full of glory
[28:29] love to lay down my life
[28:33] for every soul created by our creator
[28:38] to win as many back to him as possible
[28:42] i have that right i have that right
[28:47] you know satan wants to take that right
[28:48] away from you
[28:50] and this is how he does it he gets you
[28:52] so busy
[28:53] right that you're not even thinking
[28:55] about it
[28:58] that's how he does it he's so deceptive
[29:02] put that in your notes brother mark for
[29:05] our men's meeting
[29:08] as the elect of jesus christ i secure
[29:12] these rights
[29:14] that when any form of spirit becomes
[29:17] destructive
[29:18] to these god-given rights to protect my
[29:20] soul i possess the power
[29:22] and the authority of god to cast down
[29:24] imaginations
[29:27] to cast down every high thing that
[29:29] exalteth itself
[29:30] against the constitution of god's word
[29:34] and bring it into captivity every
[29:36] thought to the obedience of christ
[29:40] to cast out doubts and fears and
[29:42] unbelief and to cast out
[29:44] sickness to resist and rebuke the devil
[29:48] and his lies in the name of jesus christ
[29:50] i have
[29:51] these rights from god as an elected
[29:55] official
[29:58] to rebuke worldliness ungodliness and
[30:01] temptations
[30:02] and self-pleasures to submit myself to
[30:05] god
[30:06] to take his yoke upon me to learn of him
[30:10] to please him every day in every way i
[30:13] have
[30:14] these rights now satan will do
[30:16] everything he can
[30:17] to destroy this to destruct this
[30:20] god-given right
[30:22] he'll plant all sorts of temptations
[30:25] get us off track but as the elective god
[30:29] i
[30:29] possess these rights and no man and no
[30:33] spirit can take them away can you say
[30:36] amen
[30:37] no principalities no powers no rulers
[30:41] no angels of darkness of this world no
[30:43] spiritual wickedness in high places
[30:46] no things present no things to come no
[30:48] height
[30:49] nor death nor any other creature shall
[30:51] be able to separate
[30:53] us from the love of god which is in
[30:55] christ jesus our lord
[30:59] as an elected official if you know
[31:02] you've been elected you know your rights
[31:08] but if you're just called
[31:20] you don't know your rights
[31:24] you know there's a lot of people that
[31:26] live in america that don't know their
[31:30] rights
[31:32] but yet we have a constitution
[31:36] it's a lot of believers they say they're
[31:40] a christian but they don't know the
[31:44] rights
[31:46] of them are so confused they use their
[31:48] rights to fight against
[31:50] other people
[31:54] that realize we don't fight against
[31:56] flesh and blood
[31:57] we're fighting against spirits
[32:03] but you shall receive power after
[32:06] the holy ghost has come upon you and you
[32:08] shall be proper
[32:09] witnesses unto me
[32:12] you're going to be my elected officials
[32:15] there's something
[32:16] different about you
[32:20] i'm going to elect you to officially
[32:23] witness for me but he told him
[32:27] don't you go out and do it you make sure
[32:30] you
[32:30] wait for the promise because without it
[32:34] you'll just witness without me
[32:39] no matter what good intentions peter had
[32:45] he didn't have the power
[32:49] he didn't have the power to witness
[32:51] properly
[32:52] properly you can have a form of
[32:56] godliness but deny the power of the holy
[32:58] ghost the bible tells us
[33:01] so we can witness without that power
[33:06] peter tried it he tried to be a witness
[33:08] but he lacked the power
[33:10] he was physical he was emotional
[33:14] he brought passion to the pulpit he
[33:17] brought his sword
[33:21] we're following jesus are you with me
[33:23] boys
[33:26] but he lacked power think about that
[33:30] he had all the ump but he lacked
[33:33] power
[33:36] real power is the ability to lay down
[33:40] your life
[33:43] that's what real power is if all you do
[33:47] is
[33:47] talk to talk but you refuse to lay down
[33:50] your life
[33:50] you're operating by your own power
[33:55] when jesus was witnessing to pilate he
[33:57] says i have power
[33:59] to lay down my life and i have power to
[34:01] raise it up
[34:03] he spoke of the power it took to lay
[34:06] down your life
[34:10] jesus received strength in the garden
[34:14] to lay down his life when his
[34:17] flesh didn't want to do it he was crying
[34:19] out if it'd be possible let this cup
[34:21] pass for me
[34:23] you can do it lord you can do it father
[34:29] angels came and ministered because in
[34:31] his heart he took the attitude
[34:34] the the attitude the right amount of
[34:37] attitude
[34:38] amen not my will lord
[34:42] thine be done even if you don't feel it
[34:46] say it
[34:48] a lot of times the devil gets us to say
[34:51] things we don't even feel
[34:54] just put it back on them
[34:58] after a while you'll start believing it
[35:02] then you can say it like you're in an
[35:04] effect a elected official
[35:06] i've been elected on the bride
[35:11] get behind me satan
[35:16] but after peter
[35:19] and those 120 in the upper room
[35:24] received the holy ghost they were
[35:26] effective
[35:28] witnesses they could witness properly
[35:33] did they magically say different words
[35:35] no
[35:36] they had power to deny their life and
[35:39] stand for jesus in the midst of all
[35:42] persecution
[35:46] at one time saul had a sword he wanted
[35:49] to kill everybody that was in this way
[35:53] but after he received the holy ghost
[35:56] he willingly had power to lay down his
[35:59] life
[35:59] now you tell me what power is
[36:04] it's not talking about jesus
[36:08] it's about giving up your life to help
[36:11] some soul get to jesus
[36:13] that's power because what you have to do
[36:16] is you have to go
[36:17] you have to bypass your reputation and
[36:19] your time and your
[36:20] your pride and how you look about
[36:24] something it's not about us
[36:28] it's about him
[36:31] paul said in philippians chapter 3 verse
[36:33] 10 all that i might know him
[36:36] and the power of his resurrection
[36:40] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[36:42] being made
[36:43] conformable unto his death that's what
[36:46] has to happen
[36:48] the power to witness properly is being
[36:50] made
[36:51] conformable unto this death daily i
[36:55] die daily paul said
[36:58] if by any means i might attain to the
[37:00] resurrection of the dead
[37:01] and then he goes on he's still talking
[37:03] about this power all that i might know
[37:04] him
[37:05] and the power not as though i
[37:09] had already attained either already
[37:11] perfect but
[37:12] i follow after if i might apprehend this
[37:15] power
[37:16] for which i also have been apprehended
[37:18] by the power of god
[37:21] brethren i count not myself to have
[37:23] apprehended
[37:25] but this one thing i do i'm forgetting
[37:27] those things which are behind me
[37:29] and are reaching forth for those things
[37:31] which are before
[37:32] i press towards the mark for the prize
[37:35] of the high calling of god in christ
[37:37] jesus
[37:39] when you think of the greatest thing
[37:41] that jesus christ did what do you think
[37:48] calvary that's the pentacle that's what
[37:51] you think
[37:54] that's where death happened that's where
[37:58] he proved his love
[38:00] that's where he proved his greatest
[38:02] power
[38:05] well when we looked there in the book of
[38:07] revelations
[38:09] uh when when the angel spoke and said
[38:16] spoke about
[38:19] the who overcame the lion that that
[38:23] overcame and they looked
[38:25] and we looked they saw a lamb john saw a
[38:28] lamb
[38:31] showing the real power was to lay down
[38:34] your life
[38:38] you want to witness lay down give up
[38:40] your will give up everything
[38:42] and get that person to jesus christ
[38:45] that's power
[38:51] you have the right
[38:56] to tell satan to get behind you
[39:00] as an elected official
[39:04] this is the most important election
[39:09] give diligence to make sure
[39:12] that you've been elected
[39:16] because when you're elected
[39:19] you're exercising your rights
[39:23] over the devil and you're laying down
[39:27] your life
[39:28] for your brethren until then it can get
[39:31] a little bit crossed
[39:35] you're stepping over your brethren
[39:41] praise the lord if you believe you've
[39:44] been elected
[39:45] then start exercising your rights make
[39:48] new
[39:48] laws for your life don't tell i can't do
[39:51] this i can't do
[39:52] i can't overcome i can't i can't i can't
[39:55] you're an official
[39:57] you've been elected enforce them kick
[40:00] the devil out
[40:02] even jesus had to say get behind me
[40:07] get the heads satan he said it staring
[40:10] at peter
[40:12] he said it in his mind when satan was
[40:15] attacking his mind
[40:17] and showed him all the kingdoms of the
[40:19] world and gave him the scripture and
[40:22] just quote it watch these angels pick
[40:23] you up
[40:28] hey satan is real if we don't get real
[40:31] about what's being spoken to our minds
[40:37] we're an elect lady we're a chosen
[40:41] generation
[40:44] we're a royal priesthood
[40:48] we've been elected to be miss jesus
[40:52] going to take our position it's the most
[40:55] important election
[41:01] we can cast out all devils
[41:05] we can lay down our lives for others
[41:07] first john chapter 3 verse 16
[41:09] says hereby first john chapter 3 verse
[41:13] 16 hereby perceive
[41:14] we the love of god
[41:18] because he laid down his life for us
[41:22] as an elected official
[41:25] we ought to lay down our lives
[41:28] for the brethren he's showing
[41:32] here the pinnacle
[41:36] of the love of jesus the love of god he
[41:39] lay down his life
[41:40] for god so loved the world that he gave
[41:41] his only begotten son
[41:44] showing the pinnacle and then he's
[41:46] turning around and saying we ought to be
[41:48] doing that same pinnacle
[41:50] and paul is referring to you i'm
[41:52] pressing
[41:53] towards the mark for the prize of the
[41:55] high calling in christ jesus
[41:58] as jesus lay down his life for me at
[42:01] calvary
[42:01] oh may i lay down my life for somebody
[42:05] to come to know jesus christ that's the
[42:09] only way you can really prove
[42:10] how much you love god
[42:17] we need to put on the whole armor of god
[42:21] amen let's stand together
[42:28] i had in my heart that i kept you so
[42:31] long sunday
[42:32] i want to do a short one on wednesday
[42:37] got to keep the balance i hope i got the
[42:40] message across
[42:56] learn to lean
[43:01] i'm learning to
[43:04] lean i'm learning
[43:08] to lean on
[43:11] [Music]
[43:15] gaining more power
[43:19] than i've ever seen
[43:23] i'm learning to lean
[43:27] on jesus
[43:32] learning to lean
[43:36] learning to
[43:39] [Music]
[43:45] [Music]
[43:49] gaining more power
[43:52] than i've ever seen
[43:56] i'm learning to lean on
[44:01] g one more time
[44:08] [Music]

[44:17] [Music]
[44:20] jesus
[44:22] more power than i've
[44:26] ever seen i'm
[44:29] learning to lean on jesus
[44:38] hey man if i could get you to bow your
[44:41] heads just a moment and
[44:43] perhaps if you would just close your
[44:45] eyes
[44:46] i'm not looking around every eye is
[44:50] closed every
[44:51] head is about uh i believe only the lord
[44:56] is seen
[45:00] i wonder if there'd be someone here
[45:04] today
[45:07] who really hasn't
[45:11] officially been elected
[45:17] you know you've been called
[45:22] but perhaps you weren't even aware of
[45:25] the election
[45:29] didn't know there was a place of
[45:31] adoption
[45:32] for you
[45:36] but you you want to use diligence
[45:40] to find out if you've been elected
[45:44] god sees your heart today
[45:48] i wonder if there'd be someone here
[45:51] today that
[45:53] believe they've been elected
[45:56] but they haven't been acting
[46:01] like they've won the race like they've
[46:02] been elected
[46:06] and today you want to exercise
[46:10] those rights that god has given you as
[46:14] an elected official
[46:23] i wonder if there would be someone here
[46:26] today
[46:29] feels you've got the power of the holy
[46:31] ghost but
[46:32] it's been hard for you to lay down your
[46:34] life
[46:37] to be a witness
[46:44] wherever you're at today i want to
[46:46] encourage you
[46:47] to forget those things which are behind
[46:51] i want you to press towards the mark for
[46:53] the prize of the high calling
[46:56] god sees your heart he sees your
[46:59] your life and he's calling you
[47:03] to that position you're placing
[47:07] with christ to where he can use you
[47:12] to save souls his eternal purpose
[47:16] pray with me pray with me

[47:22] your heart
