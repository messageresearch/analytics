jesus praise god he's worthy of our praise amen amen god bless you tonight turn with me if you would to the book of mark chapter 8 verse 33 it's good to be in the house of the lord a lot of places we could be and perhaps be more enjoyable for the flesh but there's not a place i'd rather be i feel more secure more safe i have more confidence that god will speak to me it's it's where he told me to be and i'm just glad to be in the house of the lord and i know you feel the same way or else you wouldn't be here so may the lord jesus bless you before we begin reading here in mark chapter eight if we could let's look to the lord in prayer just ask his blessings on this word heavenly father lord before we approach your word today realizing we're not worthy to even open the pages lord we know the book was was kind of put together by automated equipment and man was involved but we know the treasures inside this the pages of this book were written before the foundation of the world it's eternal and we're beings that are temporal we had a beginning we'll have an end in these bodies we learn as we go ahead in life today we're asking for the eternal god to come and give us revelation of what was meant when you wrote these words lord help us to get our interpretation our thoughts and our ideas out of the way that you may come and give us the wonderful words of life bless each heart and each life lord you you see the the needs inside of our lives and the things that we've been praying for and been seeking after and desiring lords whether it be health or a deliverance or the holy ghost or guidance for our lives lord we're asking you to come and meet all of our needs for your almighty god that can do exceedingly above all that we would ask or even think bless those that are are watching are listening uh lord to this message and we'll give you the praise and the glory for all these things now we humbly ask in jesus christ's name amen amen mark chapter 8 starting with verse number 33 amen but when he had turned and looked on his disciples he rebuked peter saying get thee behind me satan for thou art thou savers not the things that be of god but the things that be of men very familiar scripture and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it for what shall profit a man if he gained the whole world lose his soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with his holy angels amen god bless you may be seated so we see that we have to kind of go through this whole life down here not be ashamed of the lord in any situation but we really don't find out how he feels about us until the end yeah well we just we kind of want to relax today and ask a lot of questions and just think about things we uh trust the lord to help us see what he wants us to see through doing this we want to entitle this message what would you exchange what would you exchange and for a subject we want to talk about the prerequisites that jesus gave and it's like you're going to college and you you want to become a a doctor or a psychologist you pretty much have to take the same prerequisite as far as some of them are psychology and things like that and certain ones and then as you get further you just can't jump in and say i want to know how to cut somebody open you have to take prerequisites to get there and and jesus has some some prerequisites here and um this all this is tonight uh by the the grace of god god helping me because it is kind of a more of a stronger subject because it is dealing with our souls and are i just i don't want you getting mad at me but i just want us to to just ponder the questions that jesus gave ponder the questions that jesus gave just because we've gotten baptized in the name of the lord and we've made a commitment to serve christ and to follow him into a relationship and even in to get to the deeper things of god the revelation of this message just because we've accepted the prophet made a decision to follow the message and just because we're we're doing what we're doing it doesn't really mean we're truly following the lord the way he has required amen and his eyes may be different than our eyes and of course satan's working very hard to get us off of the straight narrow and to get us more on a broad way of serving the lord before we actually follow christ each day jesus said that there's some prerequisites some classes that we have to pass and the first one is that we need to deny ourself and we need to take up the cross now this scripture has a perfect understanding for the person who comes to christ who doesn't know the lord you've got to be willing to to to give up yourself pick up the cross and you know you're gonna if you try to make it through and go to heaven without giving your heart to jesus christ you're going to lose everything and so we see that is a perfect scripture for that because a man is is giving his life to jesus because he does not want to exchange his soul for anything he wants to get his soul won and the only way to do it is to give his life to jesus christ but these scriptures refor refer more than just the beginning of our walk this is about us today it will be about us tomorrow and that's why i just want to go through them and and think about this a little bit so the first one here is that we we we need to deny ourself our will our way we we got to deny calling the shots being in control doing what we want to do this is something that must happen every day amen that's what jesus said not in this scripture but i believe as in perhaps in luke maybe that jesus uses the word daily so it's not just the beginning of our walk and we get so used to i'm serving god god's with me i'll go do what i want to do and so we don't even attempt to die out we just feel it's an automatic and as far as picking up some cross i mean my life's heavy enough you know hard enough i don't got time for you know any more problems but the honesty the reality i should say jesus doesn't even consider us having the ability to follow him if we try to follow him with our will we've got to give up our will right amen the scripture teaches us that they that are after the flesh they do mind the things of the flesh romans 8 7 the carnal mind is enmity against god is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god so there's the scripture right there that we we just can't get up and do what we want to do we're not following the lord but see the devil still tells us we are and this is why we just got to take a moment and ponder these things and just just consider maybe i just been tricked by the enemy and thinking so if we don't pass the requirement of denying our fleshly will god views us is never being able to follow him come on there should be a lot of amens with this if you don't say amen a lot what you're going to do is get mad at me so he says whosoever will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me he didn't say whosoever come after me let him follow me and if you can fit it in deny yourself if you can fiddle in you know pick up a cross there's prerequisites to follow the lord of course there's a whole world out there that the devil has deceived into thinking that are following the lord at the same time of holding on to their own will amen and satan will give them scriptures to help his deception scriptures can be used to deceived don't think that don't think that the devil's not going to use god's word he does he used it against him didn't god promise to give you the desire of your heart didn't god say i'll never leave you nor forsake you it doesn't matter what you do didn't god say the elect can't be deceived didn't god say uh whatever you ask in my name you noticed brother brandon never went around and asking a bunch of things in the name of the lord for him but why the devil has got us to do it many enter into the broad way of thinking that they can follow christ and still hold on to their will still do what they want to do amen that's i i believe brother mike was sharing some some things in our men's meeting which you your brothers are going to see how this is just like fits fits right there but he's talking about uh brother brother branham there so there was uh brother brahms old nature was kind of sitting behind in in the face of an indian or uh and uh it it it had an influence on him but not a control and it's basically describing that cockaburn nature that we're going to have until we're out of here amen and to whom you yield as brother bill was saying to whom you yield your self-servant to a white dog bat black dog second corinthians 4 4 says the god of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not that they have to deny their own personal will right if we if we ever think that we can do what we want to do we're not following the lord amen and it's a hard pill to swallow now just because we've started in with jesus it doesn't mean that we're autumn just because we started in the right way with jesus let me say that we got baptized we did the right thing it doesn't mean that we're automatically doing it every day denying ourself and picking up the cross we made commitments then we were serious then and after a while we go through trials and tests we get beat up we get you know rolled over steamed over we go through so many things and before you note we're just barely hanging on but we still have to deny our flesh look what moses had to go through for so long even when you become a christian look what paul had to go through all the sufferings he had to go through if he would have like held onto his will all the time i'm not doing this i'm not doing i'm not going over there i'm not going to jerusalem are you okay what are they gonna do to me i'll just sit here and write these books these letters yeah we can't have a will that's what being born again is to the will of god and it's a struggle for us all but we've got to we've got to come god's way now dying out is painful there's no pleasure in the flesh about it the flesh does not enjoy dying out how many times have you tried to pray and your flesh says i don't want to and you just pray a little bit enough to feel like you prayed but you still know you're going to get up and do what you want to do are you with me am i the only one that has experienced that galatians chapter 2 verse 18 for if i build again the things which i destroyed i make myself a transgression amen we can begin to let that old creepy nature say well you're in you're in the message things you're good look how does backsliding take place how are people falling away from this message the bible tells us there'd be a great falling away how does this happen things creep into people's lives not just not just uh drinking and and things like that but what creeps in is the idea that i don't have to die out the idea that i can do what i want to do well before you know it doing what you want to do is i don't i'm just going to go do what i'm going to leave for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto god i am crucified with christ so on this now paul is not stating something that happened at the beginning of his walk he's talking about the life that he lives i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me i believe this is what jesus meant when he said to deny yourself is to be crucified with christ amen daily and if you do that means christ lives inside of you but as long as you're alive and your will i'm telling you god is not going to share his glory with your flesh he just won't do it he's not going to kick out the devil you've got to want to kick him out and if you're having a hard time call on the name of the lord call on him let him see your desire but when you really kind of want to do what you want to do god won't have any robots don't let satan blind you from thinking that you don't have to deny yourself each and every day if you're not denying yourself you're probably doing what you want to do well brother john i want you to know i am so spiritual i'm so full of god that i don't have any other fleshly desires you know that would be for a higher class a special class of people right jesus requires self-denial before we can even follow him that day i i just i want to ask this question we haven't got to any of the questions yet there's a lot of questions how many of us really realize that we there are days that we don't follow the lord but we think we always follow the lord he'll never leave us he'll never forsake us why why would we why would the devil tell us we got hold on to all these scriptures and do what you want to do because the devil knows god ain't pleased with it and we just want to uncover the enemy today now not only must we deny ourselves and our will but jesus gave us another prerequisite and that is we must deny we must pick up the cross our cross we all have a job that god has given us to do and it's heavy it's uh it if you just picture jesus walking down with his cross it was not pleasant it was heavy it was hard somebody had to help them so when you think of your cross it isn't it isn't fun but we must pick up our cross before we can properly follow the lord when jesus turned around to see who is truly following him and who is not the only disciples that are behind him are the ones that are carrying the crosses those who are not carrying those crosses are not following him no matter if you're saying praise the lord praise the lord if they're not willing to do what jesus said i'd rather stay with what the word says than not what anybody feels that's why we have the word is to tell us look at peter emotionally up and down with his relationship to properly follow jesus he didn't listen carefully to the prerequisites jesus told them that you're going to have to deny yourself you can't listen to satan who's trying to tell you that you could just uh enjoy the things of the flesh is that what he said thou savers not the things that be of god but the things that be of men and what was of of peter's desire was to have a church without pain to have a a pastor who didn't have to suffer to have jesus with him all the time and jesus says i'm not only going to suffer you're going to have to suffer and people like peter still wanted to follow jesus but didn't want to take up the suffering so what did he end up doing he could only follow jesus from afar and his life was filled with denial he was ashamed amen he was ashamed even kind of pressure got real bad and cursed he no i don't know him i don't go to that church that's kind of weirdo i don't really believe in that i just go because i have to and it was because they weren't filled with the holy ghost so peter didn't exercise the prerequisite he thought he could still fall i'll go with you to the end i will i would i will fight for you i would die for you you don't know who i am here i know who you are you don't know who you are [Music] and god knows who we are he not even knows how many hairs we got he knows how many we're losing every day and how many are are transforming from brown to gray and different shades of ray jesus is still suffering people are still mocking christ amen still pulling his beard putting the crown on his head people are still swearing cursing taking the name of the lord in vain and jesus feels the denial of every single person that comes against you when you're trying to share christ with them because he's touched by the feelings of your infirmities yes we know that they are rejecting christ but how can you not feel it you're going to feel it so he's still suffering and what they've done to the least of these little ones we they do it on to to him good or bad now as christ is feeling all this pain when he looks back to see who's carrying the cross we don't want to be like peter unwilling to suffer for christ i can picture christ in his agony and his pain hanging there on the cross and looking over at peter he was suffering and when that rooster went the third time he knew peter had denied him just looking there in his pain and suffering one time he said can't you pray with me one hour he's telling peter can't you could you just stand with me and believe in me that what's happening is the will of god the suffering it's like christians don't want to be a part of suffering oh peter get the holy ghost right you've got to pick up your cross and follow me and when you're converted strengthen the brother and he said then you're going to want to pick up they're not going to want to pick up their cross either that's why you got to strengthen them that's why you gotta tell them we're not all in the same yeah we're not peter if you really love me suffer from my sheep be willing to suffer for my sheep so what he means feed my sheep suffer for them it takes it takes effort takes time you just can't go to the store and buy you know or go to costco's and get the big 15 000 box thing and say well i don't have to worry about feeding for a while just you know kind of what does the lord want you to feed peter i will get you the keys to properly follow me now jesus has some prerequisites before we follow him each day each day is a new day today is the day of salvation let's let's let's just take it as as it is he that endure to the end right i mean can you imagine these two scriptures he that endured to the end and you know predestination once saved always saved i mean what do you do with it they seem contradictory they're not but see some people want to hang on to this and ignore enduring to the end and this is part of the relationship brother adam says that we don't look at is the everyday part with the lord it's what happened in the past and what's going to happen in the future amen must jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me the consecrated cross i'll bear till death shall set me free and then go home my crown to where for there's a crown for me we have a cross and it's not you suffering because of doing your will why is it so hard for people to remain faithful to go to church were they i can't brother man says can't wait till those doors are open to stand fire for god why are there so many believers up and down why so many believers aren't interested in sharing the gospel to sinners why don't you see many believers carrying the burden for souls where's the joy where's the gladness to glory in our infirmities paul said in second corinthians chapter 12 verse 10 therefore i take pleasures and affirmatives and reproaches and necessities and persecutions in distress for christ's sake for when i weak then i'm strong i mean i understand that it is not enjoyable giving up your will but you need to turn right to the fact that you're going to be pleasing god today no matter the cost no matter the suffering it is the prerequisite to follow him that day [Music] speaking of church you remember some time ago i was reading a a little a little quote from grayson gilbert and it said church should be the excuse for missing everything else and i said it was a four pager and i only had tied to read one you remember that well maybe since we're talking about this maybe we could just read page two and then we'll save three and four for another time just going back and wanting to tie into the second page i want to read a little bit of the third page there is one of those areas where many people have settled in their minds that church attendance is optional now this is in the mind of people they can miss here and there without any large repercussions to their spiritual well-being and their own families will not be any worse off either now this is not the lord telling this but this is how the enemy speaks to people however the reality is that i've never known a casual attendee to thrive in any meaningful capacity i've yet to meet another pastor an elder that can testify to the exemplary faith of the professing christian who abdicates a-b-d-i-c-a-t abdicates regular church attendance i have witnessed seasons of growth from them yet i have simultaneously witnessed a stunt growth because invariably they are sporadic sporadically absent from the ordinary means that god has given them for their maturity their encouragement their perseverance in the christian faith more often than this stunted growth though is no growth at all or worse a backsliding of sorts and that's where i stopped there but i just want to read a little bit of page two part and parcel to this will be a further understanding of the importance of being part of a local manifestation of the body not simply as we feel like it but as often as we can because we will grow more dissatisfied with yoking ourselves with the world in favor of the bride of christ in essence we will begin to see the body of christ as scriptural portraits of her the spotless bride of jesus christ for whom he died we will look upon the radiance and loveliness seeing her clothe with the righteousness of christ and her dear union with her bridegroom and we will desire the same union for ourselves here then is the fullness reason why we do not absticate the assembling of the brethren we are to meet together and encourage one another all the more as we see that great day coming hebrews 10 25 in other words together as a corporate gathering we look with great anticipation of the day when christ will return to get and we get to partake in the wedding feast of the lamb if i could put it in even more clearly we gather with the saints each sunday i'll just add wednesday not simply out of obedience nor even because of all the wondrous benefits found therein we convene with the local uh church each weekend because we are betrothed betrothed not as individuals but as the body to our lord jesus christ that's why we're here we assemble together because he has assembled us together we gather while it is called today because we will be gathered together in his great halls with the believers of all time he said if you can't stomach meeting with believers today while they're too grown as they await the day of their redemption in what possible reality can you say with earnestness that you will be united with him at the end of days when we get down to it if you don't understand the importance of why we gather together each week church should come church should become the excuse you use to miss everything else that conflicts with it and not the other way around so often we got it backwards and satan tells us that it's okay it's okay we're too many people even in this message is following christ without denying their will this denying the will and picking up your cross is so elementary that they don't even think about it they don't talk about it because it's a given but according to jesus you can't even follow them without it that's why i want to just talk about it today i'm not pointing any fingers if i'm pointing any finger i'll be honest with you they're all pointing at me just kind of like get that out of the way if you want to stand up all one time and go like this at me i'm okay with it because i it's true we're on the same boat i feel the truth of the matter is god has a will for your life and satan wants you to exercise your will for your life each day you wake up you have to to make a choice it's either going to be yours or gods and gods is scary because you hand the wheel you don't even know where you're going to go that day if you do yours it's pretty simple i got this plan this plan i'm gonna do this when i get down i'm gonna go here if you're truly choosing god's will you will consciously put forth the effort of having to deny your plans pick up god's will that's your cross for that day it's not going to be easy brother man taught us god's way is hard so i got some questions for you what would you exchange for his will you can just rattle off if you want to you know you don't what is satan offering you that's more important in your life what are you exchanging daily for the cross many start off heading in the right direction but they don't continue to build they don't finish the tower it just kind of is left yeah he started he got baptized she got baptized she they started coming during the message but but but every day god gives us a chance to build that day are we trying to finish the building or are you finished are you already finished can't help you build no more not more to do you already there no no need to deny flesh is your revelation that you're there and you're in need of nothing if god gives you another day of life he's given you an opportunity to serve him to follow him in order to do that properly the prerequisite is to deny your will and to pick up your cross and then you're allowed to get to the next class which is follow him luke had a revelation of this when he said in luke chapter 9 verse 23 if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross quoting jesus daily and follow me it's a daily thing i do like that just so simple you know how i do it i just get on my knees for the proper six minutes that i pray and you know that is an automatic if i get down there i have automatically denied my flesh if i can basically make it through that eight minutes i'm scot-free to do what i want to do jesus knew the tendency that every believer would have daily because we got this cockapoo nature amen it's with us to stay amen it's attached to us the only way for him not to have his way is to kill is to die daily as paul said in your notes he knew every one of us would be tempted to hold on to that nature so his answer was to deny it to crucify it paul said i'm crucified with christ that that that period of of of interaction with that bad nature has to take place if you don't interact with it like brother hankins used to say and brother bruce probably remembers this if you don't face him some sometime through the course of the day he says you better watch you're probably walking with him you're walking in the same direction he's going it's worth asking every day pondering the thought what would you exchange for following jesus that day devil has got us so intellectually programmed that no matter what our steps are ordered of the lord no matter what we do we're always being led of the lord i don't need to acknowledge the lord in all my ways he's still directing my pets no matter what all the ways are pleasing to the lord all my ways are pleasing to the lord i'm so elected it's i'm impossible to be deceived i'm so tight in the palm of god's hand that i can't possibly do anything wrong we know jesus so well that once saved we're always saved we're so predestinated we're so predestinated that there is absolutely no thought about my walk with the lord because all i'm concerned about is the end [Music] what god is concerned about every day we want god every day we want him to help us every day when i meet our knees every day why can't we be concerned about doing his will every day it's worth evaluating what are we exchanging for our time everything that we choose there's a price to pay across to bear if you want a brand new cadillac you want a quarter million dollar home you're going to pay the price you're going to bear that burden do you want to win souls for the lord jesus you're going to carry that cross too either way you're going to be carrying a load one is for your flesh and your will and one is for gods god is interested in souls that's what eternal life is he doesn't really care what i drive i care about what i drive he don't care what i drive there's no self denial for our will that makes it so much easier in other words i really want this cadillac brand new i want it i'm going to get it i don't care how much i got to pay every month i want it there's no self-denial of that but when we can't have our will we got to deny jesus knows best that's not a good choice for you that cadillac well that becomes life becomes harder now but it's the right choice are you with me we are willing to do something glamorous for god if we can get something out of it yes sir right if we can get some attention if we can get some popularity if somebody could find out about it we don't mind doing things if we get something out of it or if it's not too much of a sacrifice but what would you exchange for doing something for god the prerequisite for doing god a reasonable service is to present your body a living sacrifice amen if if not that motive it's not even a reasonable service in his sight but we want to serve god our own way instead of lord what is the way to serve you look into the book look at the examples look at what the prophet did the life that he lived turn with me if you would to luke chapter 14 verse 12 then said he also to him that made him when thou make us a dinner or supper right call not they friends nor thy brethren neither the kinsmen or the rich the rich neighbors i don't cut any of those lest they also bid thee again and a recompense be made thee but when thou make us a feast call the poor the man the lame the blind and thou shall be blessed for they cannot recompense thee for thou shall be re recompense at the resurrection of the just present your body a living sacrifice that's your reasonable service amen what about the talents that god has given you what are you doing with them are you using them are you exchanging your time with those we still got to give an answer to god with those when it's all over think about it he doesn't come into our bedrooms every day and say what are you doing with the talent i gave you it's at the end it's at the end amen and we need to consider that now not the end and it just it behooves us just to spend some time pondering these things so i question for you how much of your will is god's will how much of your will should be god's will how much of your will do you give to god how much of your time is god's time how much do you how much time do you purpose for god i mean we got to work we got to eat got to sleep but how much time do you purpose for god how much of your belongings are god's brother john they're all mine because i paid ties i gave him his and the rest is mine how much of them do you give to god how much of your belongings do you give to god i mean the scripture talks about when somebody asks something you just get it god heals 10 lepers and had an expectation of all ten of them but only one fulfilled his expectation why was he why was he even bothering the one that came back to praise him to ask him about the other nine that's how much it meant to jesus brother around talking about the rocks crying out god has an expectation from us and it's a good thing to ponder do you feel in debt to god how much or do you feel indebted to your plans the plans that you've made what drives me personally is responsibility i have towards god i feel responsible to god and the reason i feel responsible is because i feel in debt i don't think i paid my debt off i feel responsible to god's purpose if our purpose is to god then we will be responsible to god but if our purpose is to ourselves then we will feel responsible to ourselves and our plans and our wishes and our will there was a rich young ruler who made his way to the top right i think brother brandon says perhaps he was a businessman had spent a lot of hours working hard to get rich let me say it wasn't really god's perfect will for him to have it because of god's will for you to have it that means you can handle it he struggled with that so it was never god's will but yet he pursued it and he wanted it and look what it did to him so after working hard to get it it became a foreign in his life and it got in the way of him following jesus now this man came running to jesus he wanted to follow him all the way to heaven what must i do to get there i want to follow you and jesus told what he needed to do but he refused he refused so my question is was it because of the money it's because he didn't do the prerequisite he didn't deny his flesh his flesh wanted that money the bible says he walked away sorrowful because he had a lot of money and he was unwilling to deny his flesh now i would probably be against any preacher that would come up here and tell you to give all your money but i'm telling you if jesus did it i'd say amen to it and jesus told him what to do but he didn't have the prerequisite to follow him he wanted to follow him with his money but why can't you just you know have this money and still follow the lord because that money would get in the way from him picking up his cross jesus said that the cross says now you just you go give all this hard-earned money that you work for and give it to the poor right amen and i'm your treasurer come follow me but he couldn't do it he couldn't do the prerequisite yet this man he followed all the commandments from the jew think about it yes amen amen people are serving the lord and doing certain things without the prerequisites well this is my time my money i'm going to do what i want to do and it's okay is it is it god's will what would you give what would you give in exchange whosoever will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it every day i'm making that decision friends every day i got to make that decision am i going to live for me am i going to live for my purpose and my responsibility or is it going to be about god see satan wants us all to feel that we're serving god no matter what we do you might as well take this message and just throw it out the window we wasted our time people are exchanging god's will and god's time for so many things are we exchanging our soul winning time for brother mark brought that up in our men's meeting it's just not staying out of the bars and staying off the internet god has a perfect will for each and every one of us to be doing we should better stand up and testify this is what god's been speaking to me this is what's on my heart this is what he wants me to do we should be there because of our we you know we act like we got this relationship with god well if we got that relationship then we should be giving our time to the lord amen i can't see i can't see you all have to work really really hard for me for the lord but the lord says hey take it easy to some of us you know this doesn't make sense so this is an individual walk we we don't spend any time talking about anybody's clothes line anybody's living room what's what's happening in there but i do want so much god to deal with our hearts just take this word and take inventory let the questions speak to you amen because as far as i'm concerned i love all you my brothers and sisters and your own the same place with me wonderful ball just going down the road but yet i i just believe that god is wanting to challenge us to a closer walk with him amen how do we get that how do we get that i think if we're willing to deny our flesh i'll tell you what happens when you pray when you pray you automatically your flesh goes like this it just shrinks that's why prayer is a good introduction to get going in the right direction no matter where you're at probably why brother branham said you can't pray too much because you don't get puffed up in prayer but you can get puffed up reading the bible reading the message listening to a tape because knowledge will do that to you look what i know look what you know but when you pray the very act that you're on your knees when you could be walking around doing what you want but you're humbling yourself before god almighty it's it brings a humbling presence [Music] brother john i have other things i want to do besides this stuff and i feel consider what would you exchange your time see your will is your time your time is your will amen you give your time you're giving your will you keep your time but you say you're giving your will we have that's how you deny yourself that first prerequisite it's hard it has to be done every day i know this seems like elementary but it's so important to to really feel i'm walking close close with the lord that i have in a long time brother brandon told us that god is hidden in simplicity and i believe that these these these messages they're they're simple but god's in them amen god is worthy of our time revelations 5 11 and i behold and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands can you imagine going to the bank and somebody's saying that next to you that's a lot of numbers imagine yourself being there in heaven these angels around the throne and all the elders saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb amen that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings in and not your time and not your will is he worthy of your time amen think about putting your time in this verse if he's really worthy give him yourself you cannot give me you cannot give one another you cannot make anybody you can't make your dad you can't make somebody give their time their will but you can't give yours you can give yours and by you doing that you can influence me inspire me because when you do that i'm not going to see you no more i'm going to see jesus [Applause] if all these elders and these angels and we're saying with a loud voice worthy can you imagine being in their presence and you're saying cool man but i'm gonna do my thing amen god is worthy of our time don't exchange it for anything isaiah chapter six verse one we're going to go through these real quick in the year that king urziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple imagine you're there above us with seraphins each one having six wings twain they covered his face twain they covered his feet twain they did fly and one cried unto another saying holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved and the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke you surrender your will now think about it lucifer was in that atmosphere and he would not surrender he got to a place that he would not surrender his will amen that's when iniquity was found in him he knew to do right which was to do god's will but he chose not to do it yes that's right and in this last day jesus told us that iniquity would abound right because the love of many would wax cold yes oh because iniquity went bound the love of many would wax code he said so this is not far from us this message this isn't for another group of people this is for me this is for us this is for our little church to keep it clean to keep it the way god wants it to be psalms 18 verse 2 the lord is my rock now we all can testify this my fortress my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust my buckler the horn of my salvation and my high tower yes amen is he worthy of your will if he's that to you will you give him your will will you give him your time will you give them just a little bit more just a little bit more will you i'll say it like this will you consider giving god just a little bit more he's worthy he's worthy of it he created you you are his creation amen why would you the clay say to the potter make me thus he wants you to be what he wants you to be with your time you want to use your time see i have a business and i've been working for me and i tell them go they go and come i tell them i tell them to do a job and if they don't do that job they're not doing me any profit why would god have subjects why would he call saul right and so i'm just going to make him suffer a lot of things for no reason no it's for the namesake it was to win souls and at one time saul's opinion of jesus was he was unworthy but when he had that interaction that communion with him that time all sudden his life began to change didn't happen overnight but it began to change and he made himself a servant all that he might gain some the purpose of god he was worthy of god's time he gave him his life the life i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god friends i know this is this is a this is asking a lot but i'm not asking it it's the word the word is asking it you you can disagree with me and you'll never offend me and hurt me i'm sorry just not gonna happen but it's the word it's the word that you're disagreeing with if you don't stay with the word amen right two more verse psalms 37 verse 4 delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires that i want to leave you with these two scriptures delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thy heart you got to delight yourself in the lord make him happy we've all seen the movies were there there's the king and the dancers come out and they're trying to or herod right that's scriptural herod he wanted to see somebody's daughter dance and then he was so delighted that he was willing to give anything right think about delighting yourself in the lord it isn't just making it to church putting the offering in the i did it he's delighted in me and go do what you want to do no i'll talk about your life your walk don't exchange anything delight yourself in the lord colossians chapter 3 we're going to end with this colossians chapter 3 verse 1 if you then be risen with christ if you then have the prerequisites seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affections on things above and not on the things of the earth right for ye are dead amen you're dead you gave up your will you picked up your cross and your life is hid with christ and god when christ who is our life show up here then shall he also appear with him in glory amen god bless you let's stand together i think the lafontaine sing a song is your life worthy i every time i hear that song no no no my life's not worthy this morning i sneezed walked into the um secretary's office and she said god bless you i says says i am i am i'll i'm not worthy of god's blessings but i'll take them but i'm not worthy oh yes you're worthy of them i says oh no i'm not we're not worthy of god's grace and the more we feel in debt the more we'll give him more and the more worthy we feel the less we'll give amen is your life worthy of the gospel amen that's that's if we're denying our will i think each day is different if we deny our will we pick up that cross god says you're worthy to follow me but if we don't do that we're not doing our part of the crucifixion because must jesus bear the cross alone amen let's let's sing that just ponder these thoughts must jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me the consecrated cross i'll bear till death shall set me free then go home my crown to where for there's a crown for me upon the crystal pavement down at jesus purest feet where joy i'll cast my golden crown and his dear name repeats o precious cross o glorious crown o resurrection day ye angels from the stars come down and bear my soul away amen if you continue to play that quietly must jesus bear the cross along and us go free and if i could get everybody just to bow your head and close your eyes for a minute have you spent much time thinking about what jesus did for you on the cross [Music] have you thought about your cross have you put it down have you misplaced it are you battling hanging out to your will and gods at the same time i'm just going to go ahead and i'm going to pray for every one of you as i pray for myself maybe there would be someone here say brother john i believe god wants you to pray for me god bless these hands god seize your hands the god that brought this message is the same god that can answer prayer heavenly father we are unworthy of your presence today lord in once sensed about even come to a place where you would deal with us in such a way that would cause us to consider our lives [Music] you asked a lot of questions when you walked the earth you wanted people to think about things [Music] today lord you've helped us to think about a real important thing those prerequisites for following you lord we've all gotten off from time to time perhaps everyone is has been right on but at times lord we've all been off we've all come short of denying our will kind of holding on to it while trying to serve you trying to ignore the heavy cross the cross of suffering and pain that you've asked us to pick up [Music] and still trying to follow you from afar [Music] today lord we're asking that you would not only take your blood and just completely cover us and cleanse us wash us and sanctify us but lord that you would fill us with such a portion of your holy spirit that when we all get up tomorrow and our knees hit the ground that we can look seriously more soberly and more willingly to give up our will for that day lord that's why we've come today that our lives might be better with you tomorrow and i pray for every hand that was lifted every heart lord jesus that's desiring to walk closer to you to follow closer to you [Music] lord that you would bless them with that close sweet presence of yours lord may they just begin to weep in your presence and lift up their hands and express to you how thankful they are for what you've done for them and willingly hand over their will to you lord pick up the will that you give them to do that day lord let us not be in a position where we walk away from you giving us instructions like that rich young ruler walking away with disappointment when he heard the word [Music] but may we just say yes lord yes to your precious word may we fall so in love with your word lord jesus we love you we commit ourself into your hands lord and trusting you lord the rest of this week just just one week at a time meeting you pondering these things in prayer this this the furtherance of this week lord we give you the praise for it lord we thank you now in jesus precious name amen amen let's sing a draw draw me near i'll tell you what's so beautiful about this here saints is that we have a we have a track to run on with the lord to get closer to the lord isn't it just hearing a sermon but now we got to track to get closer to the lord amen i am thine oh lord i have heard thy voice and it told thy love to me but i long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn to thee draw me nearer nearer blessed lord to the cross where thou has died draw me nearer nearer blessed lord to thy precious bleeding signs consecrate me now to thy service lord by the power of grace divine let my soul look up with a steadfast hope and my will be lost in thine draw me nearer nearer blessed lord to the cross where thou hast die draw me nearer nearer blessed lord to thy precious bleeding side all the pure delight of a single hour that before thy throne i spend when i kneel in prayer and with thee my god i commune as friend with friends draw me nearer nearer blessed lord to the cross where thou has died draw me nearer nearer blessed lord to thy precious bleeding son there are depths of love that i cannot know till i cross the narrow sea [Music] there are heights of joy that i may not reach till i rest in peace with thee draw me nearer nearer blessed lord to the cross where thou has died draw me nearer nearer blessed lord to thy precious bleeding side amen what a perfect song to end up on and i didn't pick it wasn't my notes our will being lost in thine that's what we need is our will lost in god's will amen let's bow our heart and a word of prayer amen as we close may the lord be with you bless you we're just going to open this up to whoever feels in their heart to close in prayer first amen thank you jesus hallelujah amen amen god be with you through my goal we know yes i feel like oh we none yes [Music] you
