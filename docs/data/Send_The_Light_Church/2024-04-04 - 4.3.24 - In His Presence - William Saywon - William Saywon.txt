service God bless you so much and you know in every country when they are hosting the when they are hosting the flare people always stand right they will stand and they will pledge allegion to the fled of that country so we ourself when we are when we are reading the word of God we also stand to our feet to pledge our allegion to the Christian flare our Christian flare it is the Bible this Bible is our Christan flare so when we are reading it we stand to pledge allegiance to the world if you have your Bible you can turn to the book of Isaiah chapter 6 Isaiah chapter 6 I will ask uh our pastor uh Pastor John to read it for us from verse 1 to verse 8 uh okay yeah the year that King youra died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple and it stood by it stood the serapid above it stood the syapin and one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord Lord God of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the pulse of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips and my eyes seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphin unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the SS off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this have touched thy lips nine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged also I Heard a Voice of the Lord also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me amen let us pray let's pray you can bow your head Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your loving kindness we thank you Lord for allowing us to be counted among the living Lord you are great and there is no one like you no one can be compared to you we thank you tonight we have read your word Lord we ask you to come down to speak to our heart SE something to us that will be a blessing that we would lead from here rejoicing we want to pray father God for the pastor and the entire congregation Lord we condemn every spirit in here that don't confess the name of Jesus and we invite your pres to come down and be with us we thank you now as we wait on you in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen God bless you you may have your seat tonight I want to speak on the subject in his presence our Prophet brother brahan do you believe the prophet uh our Prophet brother Braham told us that we are in the presence of God everywhere even at your home you are in God pres even when you go to work at your job site you are in God person when our kids go to school they are in God person why because God is only person he is everywhere so in the presence of God with human being men always recognize themsel to be Sinners When you entered in the presence of God then you can see how little you are in his present and when the present of God comes around you when you need down to pray and the presence of God come down sometime it make you to shed tears when you are in the presence of God when you even come for service and you are worshiping and the presence of God God comes down so much among the Believers and you feel his presence sometime you shed tears while you are worshiping Hallelujah but when you are not in the presence of God sometime you feel good within yourself sometime you share jokes sometime you laugh sometime you talk because we as human when we gaed we talk we share forms but when God pres come down that is complete different story amen because when whenever the presence of God comes down things change let look at Adam when Adam was in the garden worshiping God all the time the Bible say in the evening hour Je Jehovah God who was their pastor always used to come down during the evening hour to have fellowship with them and they always enjoy his pres Hallelujah but when Adam sin against God when he knew that he had done something wrong when he came in the presence of God Adam couldn't stand in God pres when he sinned against God the Bible said when he heard the voice of God walking in the garden because he sined against God he was afraid to go in the presence of God so he have to hide himself why because sin can't stand in God presence So Adam have to hide himself from God and Jehovah God who know all things started asking for Adam Adam where are thou I wonder I said but God pres is everywhere and Jehovah God he sees everywhere but he was asking for Adam Adam where are thou I started to think I said but what God trying to portray because he is great he sees everything he knows all things but he came to church and Adam was not in service so he was asking Adam where are thou God knew where Adam was but he left his god-given position so God was asking but Adam I am expecting you to be here but you are done here so where are thou and Adam was speechless the only thing he could tell God was to give excuse Lord the woman you gave me Hallelujah Adam couldn't stand in the presence of God because of sin every one of us that here even if you do something at home and your pastor is not aware of that but when you come in God pres you will know that something is not right in your life you will know that something your own conscience would judge you that you did something so it is condemning you because when we enter in God pres it is like when you are standing before a miror when you stand before a miror the miror can tell you who you are and this Holy Bible it is our mirror it tell us who we are where we come from and where we are going so when when you stand before the physical mirror and maybe you trying to dress yourself like when I was dressing myself in better house better uh the room that gave me the big miror just there I can just stand anywhere and get dress so I would I the miror told me that my T was not fa because it it it went one side so the mar say your tie is not straightened so I have to straighten my tie while I will seeing myself in the mirror just like the story that brother brah gave about about that little boy who had never seen said before in the mirror who went to visit his grandmother and when he was passing he saw the other little bo passing so when he walked the other child will walk when you stand the child will stand you say but what but what is going on that was the first time to see his own image he couldn't understand so it's the similar way when you open the bible to read then you can see yourself in the Bible the Bible can tell you who you are if you are going to hell the Bible will tell you that you are going to hell if you are going to heaven your pastor not need to tell you you yourself from the word of God you will know that you are going to heaven because the Bible will tell you because you will be reading the word of God and while you are reading you say about all this thing that the Bible talking about I'm doing it I'm not condemned in the world the more I read the word the more I I am happy the more I am rejoicing because as you read the word you are not condemned because when you read the word when you are condemned then you will know that you your life is not right [Music] Hallelujah if I say hallelujah you must say amen hallelujah yes it's good to say Amen in the house of God you know we come here because when we enter in God presence we are God children we not come to moon no one die yes we come in God pres and this is the best time of our lives we has God children When We Gather this is our best time in this world because the people of the world when they go brother Brian said when they go to their sporting event they don't care about who sat are then somebody even take up that shed and they go to the stadium maybe if the football game if the football gam about to start by maybe, 1400 p.m. some of them will start leaving 7 a.m. to go to the stadium because some of them want to get good position to see all the sporty even they don't want to miss anything and why the players are playing brother said when they are going on the SP when they are leaving their home to go on the stadium bah said they can go in the spirit of the game they go in the spirit from their home they start rejoicing gling so we ourself when we enter in God pres there is the the place that we need to Rejoice to say Amen to the word of God hallelujah do you love the Lord God bless you sin yes so the word of God is so sweet this word you see so is so sweet I'm telling you that why you see people who turning their back on God they don't know what they are doing to theirself if they if they only knew what is beyond they C this body it is a c that we will go behind one day do you remember the story of the Prophet before you could go in the six Dimension the voice asking do you want to see beyond the curtain beyond the curtain it is this body when you leave this bodyy you see beyond the C right now you and I now we are in this body so we don't even seeing the Angels that's standing around us there are angels in this room that's standing around us observing the service but you and I can see them now because I our eyes we have scales on our eyes until we can see the Angels that's standing around us but the day or child of God when they are leaving the world when they are dropping this body and getting into that other body then they can see the angels that are about to esot them home that why even in this body if a brother hand is caught you will not have one hand in heaven no the only thing that destroyed it is your house this body that we in it is our house that God plac on in it's just a physical house it's nothing why even our Prophet brother have to condemn it say oh I'm I going in that again just a few second the few minutes in just spend in the six Dimension when he were coming down he saw said oh Lord am I going in that thing because the body it don't worth anything it worth 84 sin 84 sin nothing but when you don't know Jesus the people of the world who don't don't know Christ they cherish this body so much they cherish it see our old there sitting there just he not even reach 150 years see the whole body is just all Hing on him now you see he and the wife to tell you that this body that we in is nothing but the day that the Lord will call them home they will not be in this body I'm telling you they will not be in their body they will be young and beautiful they will be in the presence of the Lord forever because this body a for of problem every day you have to treat it every day you have to go and take bath every day you have to clean it suffering we are suffering this body we suffering we have to change clothes every day we have to take [Music] bath make sure we clean ourself every day but it will not happen in heaven when we get on the other side we don't need to take bath again we don't need to go to the store and buy new clothes no we have one internal cloth that Jehovah God will put on us for eternity in his pres in this bage in school when we were in school they told us that scientist said when you reach the age of 40 years you your eyes start to get blind you can see good brother BR said he said the but flat you can't see it again and I started observing it when I when I when I hit the age of 40 years I found out that I couldn't read my Bible to bring it to my eyes that day again yeah I have to carry it down and and do my head to see the W thing yes to tell you that this body is aging our Prophet told us he said when you when you reach the age of 25 years he say you are going toward your grave see you are dying the body is burning in as you move every day now is burning is burning we are going towards your grave but the most important thing if you know Jesus Christ and you have the the Holy Ghost in you you are Sav you are a candidate for heaven that is our Hope on this Earth because you that sitting yet you are not American no we are citizen of Heaven the the world is not our home we are just visitors on this Earth you that sitting here there are many people that you knew today they are no more they gone they in the grave they gone where are they one day you and I will also have to go but the best thing before we leave this earth we need to know Jesus Christ we need to have the Holy Ghost when we have the Holy Ghost and I'm telling you we are bound for eternity then when you when the day you see yourself living this world no need you worried because you are a child of God you are going to a better place only those who living behind will miss you they will share tears but when you get on the other side you don't even think about coming back again I'm telling you even if Jesus Christ tell you that your children crying for you your your family crying for you so just go back you tell say no no no papa no no no way I'm telling you because when you get Beyond there you don't want to come back better to us he said there's no word in the dictionary I can use to describe what I saw up there all why you have to tell all you say just do all you can to enter don't allow anything to hinder you your job shouldn't hinder you because Jesus said when when it will cause you to cut up your right hand you say cut it off that is if your job want to stop you from serving God cut it off God will provide you another job the job that will tell you that L don't go for don't go to church you have to do all your work even done to Sunday go go to work on Sunday I'm telling you back home in Liberia I there I were working with the US Embassy as a security that was the job I was doing I told the people I told them I said well I'm a pastor although I'm doing security work mind the ambassador of us of America or most of the Ambassador we took care of them we mad them before you see them you will have to come I have to screen you screen you screen you check you and understand before you can enter but still the war is not safe nowhere is safe only one place save in Jesus Christ yes every time I see the photo it bring joy to me yeah I can remember when the Lord appeared to me in my dream there was no different from this face the Lord appeared he was in white although he was not in this quter but you're in white but the same face and he just came on my right hand side in s them and I turn and I look at him although he never talked to me but I turn and look at his face and it was no different the same face praise the Lord so when I working back home I told my bosses I said well I am a preacher Sunday I will have to go to church and preach the gospel they say okay well if you if you would don't work on Sunday we will shorten your money I said no problem shorten it but I will have to go for service when you stand for God God will stand for you get it at the back of your mind when you stand for Jesus Jesus will stand for you I'm telling you look God love to see people that will stand for him yes look at se Mission they stood for him so he himself have to come down just imagine they were looking at the fire bling and they say you put them there and and they look in the face of the king and said look oh King live forever with all due respect we will not bow down even if our God will not deliver us we will not bow down the will it move God so much all the Angels brother were trying to demonstrate it to do it like a drama he said maybe in your one who came the water Angel and said Lord look down let me go and put that whole fire off God said no leave it you know sometime sometime when when Temptation that is so high come against you God himself can come down yes to defend you when you are faced with a situation that is so hard for you Jehovah God Jesus Christ himself can come down his can come to defend you that why he did to Setra Miss in abingo came down the came said but after we put threee in the fire while seeing one leg unto the son of man you recognize Jesus God is great when you serve God on this Earth you will never regret look we that sitting here we will never regret because we serve Jesus Christ we will never as long we continue to hold on to God we will never regret brother said God will reward us with eternal life he will reward you he will give you eternal life because you serve him I'm telling you some people who don't know God when they are leaving this world when they are dying sometime they share tears Sinners when they are dying God can some open their eyes to see where they are going yeah like the like the lady who told Brother that if my cow go to your church I will kill that cow I'm telling you but when she was dying she started to cry he CED for the prophet say you call that man you tell him to forgive me the callah start to R to the hospital but God not wanted him to pray for her yes because she already cross already so before he could reach there he just take away her life then hman said B you can still pray he said no oh it's late yeah I'm telling you there's no repentance in the grave no repentance in the grave when you are alive that the best time to give your life to Jesus but when you leave this world I'm telling you the life that you live that the pay the reward you will have there was a young sister back on in Liberia who I need to encourage serve God serve God just doding she don't want to come to church few days ago as soon I came it g me my wife called me and said she passed off she just di not get she just died say she went and start to follow somebody man die in that condition brother BR said we are don't worried about how we will die you see our worry is when we leave leave this earth where will we spend eternity we don't worry about I'm I'm afraid so I can die in car accident I'm afraid so I can die in the plane no that is not our worry yeah our worry is when we leave this earth where are we going why the prophet say her to get the Holy Ghost he say it is the holy ghost that will put us to heaven the Holy Ghost will carry you to heaven when you are get when you get the Holy Ghost you are saved forever you can get Holy Ghost and you get sick you can get Holy Ghost you can make accident you can get Holy Ghost you even die in plain crash but you are safe no matter how you die as long you have the Holy Ghost you are Sav So Adam couldn't stand it Adam have to hide himself from God and say Adam see look at Abraham when God appeared to Abraham in Genesis chapter 17 Abraham that great pat he B in headed because he couldn't stand in the presence of God Abraham the father of Faith why God you see God when you see God changing your name that's something good about that because the first name Wasing Abram that name was not a correct name God look at it because Abraham as long he were bearing that name Abram you know too many fear and go and lie you know God said no they they need Abra can lie so I will change it to Abraham from the time God change it to Abraham never Abraham lie before only abrah lie ABR right Abraham lie but Abraham Never Lie Hallelujah but look at sa look at the difference between sa and Paul from the time he were bearing that name SA he were causing trouble right taking Stone destroying the things of God but from the time God Chang to Paul to GA we never saw Paul killing we saw s killing the Bible said he took the people clothes and he were mind the P cloth they put it at his feet and the Bible say he consented to the killing of Steven he was he agreed for that to kill Steven that was all but when God Chang his name to Paul he become prisoner he was Prisoner to Jesus Christ and he even regretted he said oh I persecute the Church of God at the time were bearing that name saw you know when you come in God pres God can change your lies men of other here if we Happ to look back to see where the Lord took us from we not even want to go back there again the Lord took us from the dodgeon it is God that brought us this far I'm telling you I can remember during the silver war in Africa Liberia the four years world I will F in my country I can still remembered I I was little bo that town around 14 15 years but I can still remember the Buddha that was passing over me as we were walking on the street the rebel were shooting we were just walking going we could hear the bullet sound but the one that will kill you you will not hear that one the one that that God will help you that will miss you you the son you were here so some I said why if I going to die doing the war where I was going to be my soul but as long you are a child even at the time you were in the world God started protecting you because he knew that you his daughter you his son he started protecting you at the time you never knew him until he brought you in the message because he don't want you to die in sin so he he protect you when you were in the world there are so many danger there are so many trouble that he save you from but he knew that you you will serve him and you will be in his present one day hallelujah look at Moses when Moses went in God pres what happened to him m f on the ground because God told him that you UNH hold the ground you have to take all his son and you fall to the ground God call you said Moses go to pharaoh and you know there are so many ways God can call his children I don't know how God called brother Mountain but God know how to call his children I'm telling you see how God call his son Moses he attracted his attention to the BR bu the Bible say he saw the Bush on fire but the Bush was not cons Zoom that What attracted Moses he said what kind of great s is this I seen a bush on fire but the the leaves are still green so he couldn't understand but then let me draw closer to see the great sight that was Jehovah God calling him how did God call you you know your own testimony you know how the Lord spoke to you because different different ways the Lord spoke to you for you to come to this message today maybe somebody wied to you maybe somebody gave you some book maybe somebody invited you say come and just visit my church from that time you are in God pres today God is great so that the how God Called Moses and say hey Moses you on the ground take all the sun off brother Bri said Moses who have been Lear all the military ttic in Egypt get to free the children of Israel say get five minute in the presence of God Moses was different five minutes in God pres Moses was different look at Moses Moses was trying to free God children you know God don't share his glory with any man he don't share it so he was trying to do it in Egypt he just killed one person he got in trouble he killed one person because he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew man he when he killed the man he Buri him no one knew about it the next day he saw two Hebrew brothers fighting he reached there he said no you explain what happened okay you explain he said no you you wrong because he tell he tell own brother that he was wrong better say oh how can you tell me so you want to kill me too yesterday you killed the other man Moses got in trouble the Roman started going around oh Moses K MOS K Moses escaped a whole dream about freeing the children of Israel a f because God don't share his glory with nobody but look at Jehovah God when God s him said go we saw Moses walking with stick in your hand they ask him Moses where are you going I'm going free goding with what with steak dry steak in your hand you see free goding in the human mind it is impossible for you to hold State say you going to pharaoh to tell pharaoh to free that 2 million plus people are you kidding me you joking but I'm telling you though when God send you he back you Moses God said Moses and God opened the Red Sea and dump all the Egyptian soldiers including Pharaoh himself God put in the sea and cover the entire sea nobody speak against it nobody speak against it Moses kill one person he got in trouble he run away God open the Red Sea and put all the soldier there bury all of them in the sea people were celebrating the children of Israel were celebrating giving God Praises I'm telling you look when God move there's Jubilation there is celebration do you understand every time when God move there's Jubilation there is celebration but when men move there's confusion there is trouble there's fighting because a man so it good for God to to move with you when God move with you nobody can speak against you nobody can defeat you when God is by your side one time the children of Israel the time they were in the the Wilderness God told Moses say GA the children of Israel around the Mountain Mas I'm coming down to speak to them go will coming down in the in a in our period of fires with Thunder with earthquake the children of Israel started weeping he said No Moses is that how you can meet God because every time you go you say the Lord go say that how you can meet God with kind of T we can understand it when God speak die please talk to God let God go back the could stand the present of the lord I'm telling you the the force Our God have the powerful our God is so powerful when he come down here with that

every believer all the sins that die whether in the sea whether in the forest where they die one day they will hear that name the Lord will call them by name and they will rise to meet the law in the

look at Peter when Jesus saw Peter he went all around he fishing the whole night and Jesus was just standing the master of the sea was standing on on on the show waiting for him and just speak to him let me your boat let me do some speaking Jesus speak and use a boat preach after that service Jesus turn to him but you catch any fish said Lord the whole night just fishing nothing he said but just thr the night again J said no Lord we are professional fature men we know more about this water we can tell you the type of F that nothing yet went in deep sea the whole night nothing so we we just trying to wash the ne all I'm telling you look when God speak it good to listen and Jesus told him said yeah cast the net on your right hand put it on your right cast it on your on your right hand

playing fun out out of me please don't mock at me but Jesus told him just to the net and the Bible say he knews that notable words he said Lord at that word that was obedience respect say at that word thr the Rel he was not sure he just decided to prove to Jesus that there's no fish there but see you say I should put it there at your wall I prove to you that no fish here come stand just wash just wash why you tell Jesus but I'm telling you the creator of that creation was standing there so before the net Touch the Water the fish were already there he couldn't believe so when he thr old net he couldn't pull the net then he turned around to see what man of M is this he Tred pulling the N when you saw the features he gave up you ran to him and you fell at his feet in his present he said depart from me I'm not worth it I'm a sinful man that was PED in the present of Jesus but I'm telling you Jesus told a W up don't don't worry I showing you something but you will be you be fat of men there is just an example but I'm calling you to be featur of men so Jesus giv the key to the kingdom the first time you open the door you put 3,000 Soul there on the day of Pentecost you put you put on understand my English you understand that okay God bless you so much yeah so you see that God is so great he say so when he saw he was when he saw that he was more than a man he realized that he was a sinful man then he said depart from me oh lord for I am a sinful man that was p in the presence Son of God what happened to Paul on the road of damasc act chapter 9 when you when you were going the Lord stck him and he fell he saw the P of fire being of Jews or Hebrew or Pharisees he know the P of fire so he say who are th Lord and the voice said but I am Jesus who you are persecuting where did he saw Jesus to persecute Jesus you were only persecuting the Christian so I'm telling you I see what I was thinking I said but then if Jesus God can tell Paul Paul who are that LA and he told Paul that you are persecuting me it may if somebody does anything to us let us live them with our God because because they are not hurting us they are hurting Jesus that what Jesus told Paul say you are persecuting me but but but because he was predestinated he was predestinated SE of God so God arrested him and say you will be op prisoner from that time Paul became op prison when he was wrting his son Fon he said poor a prisoner for Jesus Christ not for any man no prisoner to be to be in in the in the cell for the government no for Jesus Christ and I'm telling you my my brothers and sister when you are praying for Jesus during the night hour when Jesus wake you up you will wake up and pray because you pray enough for him so sometime you can be on your bed why you laying down and the Lord will open your eye and that small still voice will speak to you say wake up and pray but sometime we just Overlook the voice of God and we listen to the flesh the fles will tell that you are tired you are so weak you can pray now so just be lying down on on on a bed and just pray but Jesus don't want it that way he said rise get on your knee and pray maybe why maybe while you are on your KNE you are praying then you ask you pray for the pastor pray for the Deacon pray for that other sister pray for that other brother maybe the person you are praying for they are sleeping Jesus don't wake them up but Jesus wake you up and say pray another time you will be sleeping and Jesus will wake the better up and say pray that why we have to pray for each other sometime when a pastor stand here and say oh and the pastor to talk about somebody that's sick somebody will need to remember and you pray for the person in the church when you go home don't forget continue on the prayer and pray for for that person say oh Lord our pastor talk about this sister I pray for this sister our pastor talk about this brother I pray for this brother Hallelujah so John one time saw Jesus and the Bible say John say he fall like a de man at the feet of Jesus when you saw Jesus in his present he couldn't standing in Revelation chapter one he say you fall like a dead man no one can stand God presing I'm telling you then what happened the play we just read in Isaiah this King Us in the year that K could you imagine when you read his story when you go into Kings and read about him he was 16 years old God make it King for for for Israel 16 years old little boy God say you are King for my people and God fortify him God protect him and God bless him he was so secure I'm telling you sometime some people when God start to bless them then Pride enter in their heart and pride is not good God hit the spirit of pride God love for all his children to be humble so King us here he first so much he F that he was King he can do anything and that was wrong he walk in the temple in start to brn Inc and the pastors the priests those day they ran to him they said King this is not your job you turn around you say but who are you to tell me I am a king I can do anything no you can't do anything you have your place everybody have that place in the church every every son and daughter of God have their place in the kingdom of God just like our body they can't tell the F that I don't like you no the f is part of the body the hand is part of the body and every part of the body have it own function what the hands can do the eyes cannot do it what the eyes can do the hands can do it everybody remain and stay in your position but they can't live his position God put you as a king remain in your king position but he left it want to burn in the king the the preach the pastor tried to correct him say king would you respect please this is not your job don't do it you got angry you know some people hate correction some people when you try to advise them maybe your pastor call you try to advise you talk to you the next time say but then I can't be in the church again I will change the church I will find a different fellowship if you do that you are towing a spirit behind you because if you leave the fellowship you go to another fellowship that's that another person will correct you either Deacon or the same Pastor there will correct you on something then you get angry again say but I can't I can't be in the church then he say let me tell you I left that out pastor church because he did the same thing to me I'm leaving your church when you go to another church you will do the same that spirit will follow you is not good for you to quickly make decision I don't want to be part of the church the only time when you do that God can back you is when the pastor stand here and trying to give you a fool f o o d spiritual fool that will contaminate this body that is false Doctrine when the pastor stand here and try and and try to condemn W and say from now on I don't believe that me would walk out of yet and go God will bless you for that but when Pastor stand trying to correct you about the world all you have to do is to say Amen to the world when you say amen and take that correction God will bless you for that but I'm telling you if you leave say I'm I'm getting v i I will leave or brother did that to me he was my son leader he did something try to try to talk to him he said I'm I'm leaving I will not come back again except you talk to me he said I say I call him and talk to him I said I would never do that I said as long you are leaving I said God will replace you and God will bring somebody who will lead his song and you will be ashamed because nobody can BL God even if your pastor stand to say no I'm tired Jesus I don't want to preach your word again if he move go will bring somebody who will do it better than him and he left the brother left never I never call him God brought a some leer that have never seen before that the brother can leave the song you see the entire church jubilating I've never seen the better he can list Son Well perfect up to now he said that now leing the song the brother came he called he said I will I will come back to church I said what the call me they say oh brother you want come back to church I said but nobody driving away he went so if you willing to come our doors are open we driving our he drove out if you realize a mistake let him come back to church but the brother who leing the son now he will remain there he can be removed he will be there when he come let he sit and worship God nobody can BL God Only God Can Only God Can BL us but we can BL him because we are not the one that loving God the Bible say it it was God that started loving us first before we started loving him he started loving us he went and starts searching for us everyone other year he for us search for us and bring us together so we can BL him he can BL us hallelujah so K when he did that he got angry god stricking with Leprosy and God never he him he remain in that condition until he die then when he died the prophet because Isaiah was looking at him Isaiah was watching him Isaiah were Beyond him all the time as a role mod monitoring him always around him that why when it come to the message of the hour there's no friendship in this message brother Mar both of all can be friends but as long you holding God I need to hold God I don't need to hold mountain m need to hold me he don't need to hold me I don't need to hold him read the Bible Paul said follow me as I follow Christ he said follow me as I follow Christ when I leave Christ leave me so let's say this thing is God for typical example God is not an object but I'm just just show example so if that is God and I'm standing here and I'm worshiping God I'm holding to God a better thr kind and start holding me as long I am holding to God he say holding God but the day I leave God he saying leave God right because he holding me he is holding me and I there holding God so whole Hope and Faith everything in me the day I stand say I'm not I'm not going for service today I'm tired he said say I'm not going why even the person can be your best friend if they are not coming to church come to church if they call you at your heart and say no today I'm not think so I I I will be in prayer meting or I will not be in Bible study tell them that okay you not going but for me I am going don't get weak don't get weak because of that statement that oh today are you not going for Bible study yes ah okay but I think said to I have to stay home no no no if they tell you that didn't going tell them I'm going for service I want to be in God pres I'm going there because the Bible say we shouldn't forsake the Assembly of the sins and brother abrah said if you have God in your heart you will never let to wait for the door to be open what it mean it mean if you he today it's wday I don't know whether Wednesday or Friday you service if you get the weekday service the moment that day reaches the fire can be burning in you from the house brother Brian said this church service is start from the house then you see yourself sinking while you are to the house today is service day you stop get you start getting ready putting your things together at the same time you are sinking you are sinking whom your son maybe your children looking at you wiing mommy said today is service day I'm I I putting myself in the spirit Hallelujah but I'm telling
