could you do that for us thank you brother amen hallelujah as our pastor comes let's just sing shut in with god but when we say shut in with god i want you to think about shutting with the word this with morning in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face gaining new power then i'm in this race how i long to be shut in with god [Music] in with god in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face gaining new power to run in this race oh i love to be shot in with god one more time shot in with god in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his faith gaining power to run in this race oh i love to be shot in with god amen isn't that the truth just shut in in the spirit amen god bless you maybe see just a moment i want to say it's good to be in the house of the lord my precious brothers and sisters amen um we have a all of us are precious in the sight of the lord and uh all of us are equally precious uh but i wanted to say that before i said this we have a precious sister in our midst who we've have uh desired to just share a little bit uh about her to testify of the lord and she's been coming now for oh a number of months i don't know do you know how long it's been about four months well uh she is one of those persons one of those sisters that she didn't have to come more than once to know who she really was if i could say that and uh she has been a true blessing to our family and to the support of of the church and um so we had we'd made mention about her sometime in the future sharing a little something for the lord and uh and so this morning we wanted her to just have liberty and and and share whatever is on her heart we don't know but we just want to say we appreciate our sister lynn and her love for jesus christ amen god bless you good morning saints oh amen good morning i'm like sister shirl i don't like being up here back here but um but i just want to thank pastor john for welcoming me into the family amen and brother branham always said that you could know about the congregation because they take on the spirit of the pastor and the pastor has a compassion for the people and i notice that in the people they have compassion for one another and that carries a lot with me because um i wouldn't be here if god didn't let me to be here so i gotta hurry up because i i love the word so i'm not gonna talk that much because i've been serving the law for 31 years i've been in a message for 24. but that word being a message to me that message is christ it's not a tape it's not a book it's a person and that's christ himself so but i do owe you an explanation how i end up on your doorstep so if you just give me a few minutes and i just want to rush through it a little bit but i was been thinking about that it'd been a year i keep hearing testifying testify and i do on one-on-one but not as a whole because i'm not comfortable in that but god gets you out your comfort zone you know and the lord knows i'll do anything for it i've got to that point that it doesn't matter anymore with me whatever lord says do i'll do but i said i didn't want to do a lot of say a lot of things but my conversion the lord says are you ashamed of me and i think a lot of times people don't see christ because we don't express him through us what he has done we want to say what he will do but what has he done for us and the main thing for me that god saved my soul and um he knows you from the beginning and even when before i was born my mother was carrying me and she and my father and my two siblings walking downtown and a woman came up to her and says you got a blessed event and she says it's a girl and she says name her linda so my mother turned around and she said james that's my father you hear what this older lady said he says what lady i didn't hear anything and when he looked around she was way down the way he said she says i'm having a girl and call her linda he says well there's nobody in my family named linda but i'm linda so my mother followed that because god even knows you before that but you know and so through it all we was raised in a pentecostal when we was young my mother took us out and put us in the baptist church and i'm like i was young i said but we're going backwards even then i knew from pentecost to to baptist we kind of like going backwards but god knew all things he knew all things so i was raised whereas that you accept jesus christ shake that hand you're saved now getting to church and work that's how i was raised so i was in the church doing what i want to do go to church and go back and live the life of a center because i knew no better but one day i was looking around in my room and i'm saying i have no need of nothing decent job nice car people friends all of that i'm looking around all this stuff i had accumulated i didn't need and all of a sudden something hit me and it says you need salvation and i just dropped on my knees and i prayed and when i prayed on my knees when i came to myself i heard this wind now granted i'm ashamed to say i never read my bible i did not read my bible i'm in the baptist church i listen to the preacher go back home and just do my thing i didn't read the bible but when i got off my when i when i got up i looked and i said man it sure is windy out and i had a picture window when i looked out the window there's a big tree by my window now one leaf was moving but i heard it when i got up i was so happy i said i'm saved i knew there was a change in my life and it happened on a friday friday and i said i'm saved but i can't tell nobody i said i can't tell nobody and i went to work and i'm all giddy and just all just but i said i can't tell nobody but that weekend i couldn't hold it that monday i started telling it and i had a in my bro plant i worked there there was a lot of ministers and bishops and and deacons and that type of stuff and i came to one young man he was apostolic i said i'm saved i'm saved he says you got the holy ghost i said you know it was the holy ghost there i go back on my knees again and all of a sudden when i was praying i said lord i don't even know what i'm praying for but i'm not getting off my knees until you give it to me and all of a sudden baptized in the holy ghost and fired thank you lord and then all of a sudden i heard this talking i said who was that talking and it was a language that i never heard of before when i found out it was me and when brother branham says that the new birth is a messy experience yes it is because that fire will burn you when i got done i was glad i had a leather couch because it was a mess and i said thank you lord thank you lord but to make a long story short now and in my church they knew there was something different but they did not know what and i had all these questions and i'm just just running just running just running like i get the bible now i got my bible i'm just reading reading reading i have all these questions and i'm asking the pastor these questions and he's looking at me like what's wrong with you you know so and i found out that sometimes when when you can understand how how paul did when he was persecuting the church because of what he had believed but now there is something different it's a heresy to them that spirit is still alive today it is still alive today but all this time you know i'm just seeking the lord to seek the lord but i knew that it was something more it was something more and it took seven years to finally i got to a place where my job was transferred and you know the lord started wrath my conversion though i start having visions and dreams and manifestations i won't go on to that but i knew that there was something going on and i didn't understand that there was visions at the time because i did not know and so when i got to the place where my job transfer me and my bloody mouth i started talking about what the lord had done and one the minister said to me he says you're a witch and i said no i'm not a witch but i just thought a lot of christians went through this type of thing what the lord was doing so he went on and then about a week later i saw him he had red eyes because he had looked like he had been crying and he said and i knew then the lord had got a hold to him so he says i want you to read something so he gave me a book he says i said okay i'll read it it's something about friday was on a friday and i went home and i started reading a book and i do believe it was a spoken the spoken word is the original seed i believe that was the book and so um i read it and i said okay because the first thing i started looking at women should not wear pants and and this type of thing i'm like oh okay so i gave it back to him that monday he said how you like it i said it's okay it's okay he said no read it again i said okay i'll read it again so i took it back and i started reading it and i just started crying and everything that the prophet was saying i was saying amen amen amen that's what was missing was that we know his brother john preached that justification lead to sanctification say if occasionally the baptism on holy ghost holy ghost leads to the way of christ himself that's where i was in between before i got the message and when i got that i said there it is there it is right there and so i was like a fanatic because my sister i was like i need more i need more and i had her going on computer just downloading stuff she said i can't be downloading all this stuff i'm not supposed to be online like that and it was like i was just hungry for more and more and more and so by that time i was still in the baptist church and i stayed there for almost 17 years and when you have come to a way and they don't understand that there's a lot of friction you caught it's a lot of problems but you know then i got to that point where um i i didn't know there was anybody else live that was in the message because i told my oldest sister where is everybody but that's the way the lord was leading me and so for years we didn't even know anybody else was alive that knew the message and i was always online just grabbing whatever i could you know and so then it finally came up to that point to where is that we found a church that was having a meeting in indiana and my sister don't never do anything without seeking the lord no matter what it is seek the lord first because the lord allowed me to actually see where the two spirits would be so close to they were full of very elect if possible but god would not leave his bride and error never never so i ran into that so i said i told my older sister well and at that time i had left the baptist church i decided not to go back so i was out for 13 years just the message just a word god dealing with me and just still holding on to what i believe till one day when i got on the internet i found out there's some churches that's actually a lie so i got in i got into that and here come the fivefold ministry that is so important and i thank brother john for having a fivefold come to this church because that's the provided way of god and that when i got a hold to that it start everything that was in my life the visions and all that start coming together and like pastor john said you should see yourself in the bible you should see yourself in the bible and all that started coming together where i saw myself from genesis to revelation the whole time and so then i got to a point where that lord i'm tired i'm tired of the virtual thing i gotta go i gotta get i've always been in fellowship with the church always and so i'd have started to see because in ohio i don't wanna speak his name because maybe he don't want me to know but i started listening to him and through him i was able to get through a lot of other ones but then i said i'm gonna go and then the pandemic hit so i had to sit back down god wasn't ready yet so okay i said back out but then i opened up even more because i'm i'm like a sponge when it comes to teaching of the word i love it and so after the pandemic i told my sister i started crying i said i'm tired i said nobody wants to talk about god i said i'm tired and she says lynn i'll take you there and so i said okay the lord says no can't go not that there was anything wrong with that church but it wasn't my place so i didn't but then i got so chopped i guess i was getting ahead of god because i was so hungering to get back in fellowship because see i've always paid my tithes why i was a sinner paying tithes i believe in paying tithes and offering and so i said at least i can just give my my money to somebody so they can help the kingdom of god so i wrote this pastor and so he told me he says we don't do that you got to be under a fellowship of someone for to pay ties with he says but i'm going to search and see if there's someone in your area where you can go to so i got ahead of myself again because i'm sitting there and tasha said lynn there's a church in um ann arbor was that bible tabernacle i do believe so we went there they had moved i was disappointed again so i went back home i said lord i give up i'm tired of trying i'm tired i said you'll tell me where to go and so then three days later here come a card and it says i found two churches around you bible tabernacle and send the light church cinderlight church never popped up anywhere on the website when we was looking what tash was looking did not pop up i said i'm there i'm there and at that time the devil fought me tooth and nail because he hit tasha left and right she was sick in the hospital just about dying and but he was trying his best because you got to know the enemy the lord has taught me well you got to know that enemy and i told the lord no matter if she's in the hospital not i'm going to the church i'm going so he told me he said well you wanted to come home or stay i said bring it home because tasha is not a very good patient you know i have to be there for so i said bring her bring her home so that i told her she says you going i said i'm going i'm going and so precious jonathan he met me at the door and he says hi how are you i said i'm fine he said who you with i said nobody he said well okay then i'll just show you around that blessed my heart so cause he made me feel so good and when i got here i knew i was supposed to be here and so tasha when i got home she said how was it i said i found home i found home so i thank god that he allowed me to come here but he would not let me go anywhere for 13 years because he have me a place to go when you wait on god you'll never be disappointed you have to wait on god and seek him for everything thank you pastor john i mean that is god in action that is the that is god alive god is the same yesterday today and forever god is moving and we we could uh we heard the word we could go home and be edified of what we heard today and not only we could be encouraged to see god more in our life from their the testimony that we heard today and if we just put into practice this waiting on the lord getting in the will of god having god moving on desperate desperate to have god come fill us with the holy ghost i mean there's so many things that we heard in this testimony so many messages and we just appreciate what god has done for our sister amen let's give the lord a hand clapping thank you jesus amen amen praise the lord well if i could have you stand uh again and for the the reading of the word and in in genesis um genesis chapter one we'll start with verse number 26 and before we begin reading there let's let's just ask god to break this word to us amen our gracious heavenly father we want to thank you for what you've done for our sister lord we want to thank you for what you've done for each and every one of your people today lord thank you for calling us out from the east the west the north the south gathering us together in lord showing us the ways of the lord that we may better please you and better serve you and lord as we come into your house and have worshipped you and expressed our thanksgiving for all that you've done for us lord we we're like our sisters said we're just lord we want to grow deeper deeper in the things of god and we ask that your presence would come now in a special way and even though lord uh i'm just a man uh with the ability to read some of thy word correctly lord there's so many things like i i can't understand i can't read correctly i'm just a man but lord we're not here to receive from man we're here today to receive from you and i pray that you would come in the opening of the word the breaking of the bread of life today and reveal this truth these truths to us that are hidden in these pages bless now the reading of the word is we commit the service to you we commit the needs of our lives that you would come and meet those needs as well father we humbly pray these things in jesus precious name amen amen genesis chapter 1 verse number 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl the air and the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and god created man in his own image the image of god created he him when he created him he created him both male and female men male and female created he them okay genesis chapter 2 verse number 5 and every plant of the field before was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground but there went up in the midst of the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the lord god and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathe in his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed amen jumping to verse 15 and the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the god thou mayest free to eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eat us thereof thou shall surely die amen god bless you you may be seated in our taking um some thoughts honestly that were uh come from a sentence or two that our brother jonathan had mentioned in our men's meeting about us getting to know more who we are in christ just feeling that desire for all of us to know our our place and who we are and our purpose and and and and to to get us on on a track of moving forward with the lord it had been behind this and we begin to study and um and i think for us to know who we really are we need to we need to know who who adam was the first man that god created because we're we're going back to that image right and so we want to entire this message making man in god's image and if it would be the will of the lord we want to have this service as a foundational service for a a mini-series on how to get back to the image of god because our opening scripture god said let us make man a human being in our image and after our likeness god has had to deal with man not wanting to be in his image for many years sixteen or seventeen hundred years after god had had made man in genesis chapter five and god saw that the wickedness of man was great and you're probably not going to see as many scriptures on the board we're just trying to change things up here a little bit but god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that the every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually now look here it says and god repented and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the lord god said i will destroy man whom i've created from the face of the earth both man and beast and creeping thing in the files of the air and for it repented me that i made them now that word repented means proper uh properly to sigh that is to breathe strongly by implication to be sorry uh uh in a favorable sense to pity console to rule to avenge to comfort to ease one's self he was obviously looking at the condition of man and saying this is not what i created adam to be there was a total difference in mankind from the original creation when he created adam in his own image god had to be considering what has happened to man well we know man became perverted he began to literally do his own will and that's simply what it is when you do your own will it's perverted you god's will is the only will that's right god wanted to destroy sodom for its wickedness and and abraham interceded with the lord and that bird of course we know it was christ in in abraham he says will thou destroy the righteous with the wicked but god's desire was to destroy sodom because they were doing their will so much yeah now we can say oh yeah was it really that or was it because of they were sodomites and they were you know they were gay when you do your own will it's i don't care how mild it seems it's just as evil as that thing turning to a corrupt perverseness it's either god's will or our will and if we do our will long enough man will destroy himself but we don't want to belittle the fact that our will is okay as long as it's not really causing harm or danger to anybody right god created us for the purpose of serving him following his will and carrying out what he wants us to do that was the image in which he created man to begin with god destroyed the armies of egypt simply because they wouldn't submit to god if if pharaoh would have just said okay you want your people to go go ahead egypt probably wouldn't have got bombed probably wouldn't have drowned but he he had a purpose to show his glory in his ability to destroy a nation but it was all because they i mean there were so many other people on the planet that weren't obeying god's will but he let him let him go and so here he is he saves his people out of the land of egypt destroys the egyptians and then afterwards destroys his own people because they were unwilling to do the will of god think about how important it is if you want to be in the image of god you need to be so interested and concerned about the will of god in every aspect of your life not just going to a message church not just saying you believe the bible not just being baptized but you're interested in the will of god in every aspect of your life because that is the image of god we know that god is going to destroy man again he's going to destroy the earth he's going to burn it the bible says it's going to burn with fire because of man's wickedness because of his sin and and because he's manifesting the image of a beast which is the opposite of god's will right you've got you've got the image of christ and you've got the image of the beast there is no in between there's no switzerland in the deal and we are reflecting one or two images right man is reflecting one or two images like if i go up to brother mark and i'm not not happy i'm gonna hit him in the face i don't put him in a headlock i'm gonna calm every name in the book that is not the image of christ that i'm displaying right now get angry talk behind his back lie it's not the image of christ that is the image of the beast that is the we live in in such a terrible world don't we we we see the image of satan all over the place don't get too quiet on me if it's true say amen get into the word well about 4 500 years or so had passed after the flood and here we are living in a world that's increasing or ever involving in wickedness insanity to such a degree that the world has never experienced before they don't even know who they are the world don't know who they are humans have lost their respect one for another think about it how intelligent and smart they are but yet they've lost their respect for one another and the world is in one crisis after another and one of the major crisis in humanity is that they've lost their identity they don't even know the reason they were created they don't know the purpose they were created they don't even know what they're supposed to do or how they're supposed to act so they just do whatever they feel to do the world is evolving more and more and to identify crisis and that identity crisis means a period of uncertainty and confusion in which a person's sense of identity becomes insecure typically due to a change in their expected aims or a role in society now if that is not the description of the world i don't know what is men are confused men are confused about their gender they don't know if they're male or they're female women don't know their role in society children are increasingly becoming more insecure about who they really are there's such a strong evil spirit that's pushing a perversion into the world through the movies through music through electronics and the internet and instead of people using it to become more healthier they get a hold of people who are more perverted than them than they get perverted doctors are not allowed to put on birth certificates what gender babies are anymore what in the world is happening even doctors are being forced to question their expected aims or their role in society instead of children accepting the fact who they are i i mean i didn't there was like no question in my family what i was they're given a choice in life what they want to be now despite who they are you can choose your gender you can choose what spirit you have or who you want to be with or what bathroom you want to use the world has totally gone insane they don't know who they are we know it's just another ploy of the devil amen towards god's own creation perverting the creation of god just like it was in the days of noah the days of lot men have lost their expected roles they're they're what they're supposed to be in life and they just begin to do more and more and more and more what they want to do and it's getting further away from god and that's why it's important that your interest in doing god's will all the time needs to become very high on your priority list this this mindset that satan gives us that well all we got to do is is go to church on on sundays and and and do this or do that we're okay and kind of everything else is up to you but the bible says that we're not to be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our minds that we may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god for our lives every day we have an opportunity no matter who we're talking to no matter what we're doing to do the will of god or to do our own will it's true amen when god created man and woman in the beginning there was no confusion about it there was no confusion the confusion came in is when satan came into their lives and got them to question confused about who they were who was really in control was it god or or or you could be in control that's what he told eve you can decide what you would like the outcome to be amen god knows you're gonna you're gonna be just like him knowing good and evil don't you want to be in a place brother brandon taught us that she lusted for knowledge but it wasn't the right knowledge it wasn't the knowledge of how i can please god more it wasn't that knowledge it was a knowledge in order to where she could exercise her own will instead of gods nobody wants to rely on somebody else i mean that's the fleshly nature so this was appealing satan he just wants to pervert god's creation this morning we purpose to to lay a foundational message about our roots who our creator is and who we are both of which satan has confused the world with and then i'd like to build off of this message and get back to the image in which we're supposed to be we know that this book called the bible it's the only book that describes who god is and who the image of god is and who we are it's the only book that could really tell us our roots where we came from amen we know we were in the mind of god adam was in the mind of god before he created before god created him and that goes way way back but the scriptures are the only thing in which you and i can rally behind and know what really the image of god really is and what we're supposed to be our sister when she was testifying today made mention of a number of different churches and i remember when i was hunting for a church before god led to the message i'll tell you if there's a strong hunger in a man's heart for the truth god will lead him to this message there's just no doubt in my mind about it but there's a lot of different ideas out there we just want the truth the scriptures help us interpret the scriptures brother branham says that our ideas or how we view things about a scripture about ideal in the word it must dovetail from genesis to revelations that can't contradict anything if it does then we have to step back and say i think i have to i have to conclude that i'm wrong something's not right we can't cross any scriptures we need the scriptures they interpret they help interpret the word going back in the beginning before anything ever was the the scripture tells us in john 1 1 that in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and verse 2 the same was in the beginning with god the word we don't have anything else besides this word we we don't even want man's opinion about the word amen and i tell you i say this if i didn't know william branham was a prophet his opinion about the word would mean just as much as everybody else's opinion to me about the word but because i know he was god said because i know god revealed to me who he was then i can have confidence i'll do nothing except i reveal with my secrets unto his servants the prophets we can have confidence that's why we ought to be spending time digging into the message and not waiting for it to be preached to us dig in the message you've got 24 hours a day you've got seven days a week find time to seek the image of god you will find it in that message that's what god sent a prophet for he did not send a prophet so it could just go to the people's ears make sure you go to a church that believes that god sent a prophet that is not the reason he sent a prophet it is not good enough to just believe god sent a prophet we've got to get into the message and get the message that god sent through to us through that prophet that's right amen we can't depend on one fold ministry twofold three four or fourfold or whoever comes to the church we need the fivefold all of it jesus said in john 5 39 he said search the scriptures for in them you think you think you have eternal life how many people have you talked to that think they have eternal life he says but the scriptures they are they which testify of me the scriptures are what testify of who jesus is brother branham said that if you can't find jesus christ in every scripture go back and read it we need this to know the image of god he brother adam also said if you want to know the image of god you want to know who god is look in the face of jesus christ look at jesus and you will know exactly the image of god the bible tells us i believe it's in colossians he is a he is in the in he is in the image of the invisible god all that was in god he poured into christ he is the image and he made man in his image that's why it's important for us to to focus on being in the image of god amen john first john chapter 5 verse 13 says first john chapter 5 verse 13 these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that you have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god these things are written we have this bible so we can know whether or not we got eternal life not not question who we are if if we follow the word we're truly following god now if you're following part of the word you're doing exactly what eve did that's right amen brother brandon says she she followed 99.997 of the word that's what he said we can't be interested in in following more the word than our neighbor than somebody else in church right we've got to follow all the word man shall not live by brethren but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god our emphasis needs to be for our lives god help me to live all your word to seek all your will and not be content in this laodicean spirit all around us that attacks us through the media through the television through the radio through the billboards to the people we talk to with nonchalant spirits that doesn't matter what you do or that tries to puff you up because you're doing better than them that is just so antichrist we need to be interested in the part of the word that we're not following that's right because he's coming for a bride without spoderico and that should be our goal god's word can straighten up any confusion he can straighten up any marriage any relationship any any church any any any problem that then the human has this word can straighten it up this word is the absolute it is the final amen it has the answer to man's problems but for some reason man isn't interested in going home and open the book here's a sister testifying oh my i just love the testimony can glean so much from that testimony but here she is going to church going to church going to church working at the church working for the lord you don't want to be in that position what you're doing is you're following a man and it not that the man here or the men here would say anything to mislead you but the very fact that god sent you this word and you're too lazy to read it what are you telling him about your relationship with him this flesh is never going to want to read this like you would want to watch your favorite tv show you can't wait to see what happens you hope they come back and put another season on your your flesh doesn't love this word your flesh hates this word you love the word that's something deeper inside you that's the inner man that's the part of man that's attached to god that's where you came from that's where you're going but you're trapped in a body and if we don't follow these simple instructions that to deny yourself every day to pick up your cross you're not you're not going to ever be excited about reading the word unless you want to get some knowledge for somebody that'll puff you up knowledge puffs you up but i'll tell you if you're not wanting that word so you can know how to better please your master amen it's your motives god sees that we're just going to take our time with this if it's okay amen genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and god said let us make man in our image and after our likeness let him have dominion over everything and so he created man in his own image verse 27 says and the image of god created him male and female so if we can identify god then we can know who we are because we're in the image of god and even though today we're not in the same image that god created man we know according to the word of god the absolute that we're returning back to that image god's not going to be mocked if he said let us make man in our image he's going to have a man after his image i don't care what he's got to go through isaiah 55 verse 11 says so shall my word be that go forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing that i sent it to so god will have a people in his image we know part of this process john 3 16 for god so loved the world that what that he gave himself ephesians 5 tells us he gave himself for it that he might sanctify the church he might cleanse it and wash it and wash it by the by the word we are washed by the word to come to church and our only motive is to get to feel better without washing in other words i wanna i'm all been from the market i work in the pond pulling the seaweeds out and when he gets done he is so dirty i don't want to hug him i try to hug him before he's done before he does the job but to go ahead and say you know i just want to be clean from this yucky sweaty stuff on me and never go into the water how are you going to get clean right it's true you know what's really appealing for the women is they got this the spray now you can wash your hair with the spray without getting it wet that's really appealing you we come to church to get washed because we're we're we're trying to get to a place that we're not and if that could be our focus and our goal well i'll tell you we just won't get offended we won't get offended by the word we think we're being offended by a man but we're not the man is not doing anything or saying anything to hurt you we we don't want that spirit behind the pulpit but the word cuts it hurts but it's not meant to hurt our soul and our spirit it's to change the nature of our soul so let's let's allow the lord to have his way with this word we come in the church we're prepared we let the word speak to us if it if it's cutting a little bit it it's cutting off what shouldn't be there if the shoe fits wear it if it doesn't fit but it's okay it's still the word and great peace have they that love my word and nothing shall offend them just fall in love with the lord more now we know the image of god god is holy he's righteous he's just he's true he's full of compassion the bible says that god is love i believe if we just spend more time when we read the bible seeking the image of god we would we would know more what we're supposed to be now the problem with the with the world they don't care that's the biggest thing is there's not enough care they would rather go to a church and put their name on the book shake a hand burn some candles whatever it might be but to go ahead and subject your life to come under the image of this word is too hard it's too much effort and that's why the world isn't interested that interested if they could pull into a bank get their money pull into a restaurant get their food if they could just pull into church and get come up with the image of christ well they would do that right amen but i tell you building character or the image of christ it's not a gift it's it won't be just handed to you because of some easy thing that we did it it comes to you hating your flesh so much the image of the beast that you're manifesting that you get serious about dying out to it and saying god fill me with the holy ghost that's when things begin to happen in a man's life and i'll tell you don't ever get to a place where you're satisfied paul was never there god had taken this man who was a total antichrist and and put him as the example for you and i in 14 books of the bible and his attitude is our example i'm forgetting everything that's in the past don't let the right hand know what the left hand doing i don't care what sins i don't care what vic i'm putting them all in the past and i'm pressing towards the image i'm not there yet i haven't attained yet i haven't apprehended it yet but i'm pressing towards it and when you get down to the end of your journey you aren't about to say like he said i've fought a good fight i've finished my course there's there's a crown that awaits me not only me what he said but to everyone that loves him love not just love what he did for me i love to do his will every day in your life interested about what you're doing taking time to check lord is this pleasing we've seen that song pleasing pleasing let everything i do be pleasing to you it's a beautiful nice song but does our life do that you know we'd be here's how tricky the devil is brother man said that this message will never become denominationalized but we do and it's the truth but the thing is because we go to a message church does not mean we're in the message is really the message in us can put a bottle in the water but it's the water in the bottle so we can be in the in the message but is the message in us the devil is always trying to get us to just relax give you what you want make you happy and that keeps us from pressing that's how that's why this is the worst age out of all the ages is it isn't because all the perversion and all the corrupt politics and the nations are so no it's because we can have everything we want and we don't want to battle not wanting it that's what makes it hard here that's why we say come to church pray get prepared get get get in a place where the holy ghost can begin to deal with you because we can be so much in the flesh that we're actually missing god there's various aspects to god's image one is that god has dominion does he not he created everything and i wish men would remember this that god has the finals hazel it'd help them to make different decisions but when god made man he gave him dominion as well after that that same image god gave all the animals to name they're still finding animals that didn't even know and here adam so intelligent names them all and whatever he named the bible says that's the way they are so when he caught a horse a horse it was a horse he moved mountains he could say i want this and it would happen because he had a creative power inside of him brother mantelli said he was like a mini god because he was created in the image of god we at this time we can't hardly stop an argument stop a fight we can't hardly stop some negative nonsense but i'll tell you what adam had power brother brandon says we have power inside of us to create an atmosphere but if we don't practice creating the atmosphere in our homes in bad situations with our employees our neighbors how is god going to entrust in us a greater power we have to learn to be faithful with what we have control over that's why that last service we talked about being able to function as a body i mean i having seven children we did experience confusion in our home confusion with our children things not getting along things not being right now if i said well that's just the way it is i don't think brother johnson would have said brother john you need to be a deacon i don't want to get into any of this but here's the thing if god puts something in your power he expects you to control it so i don't care how bad the atmosphere is god has placed it in you a power to create an atmosphere to fix the thing now you may not be able to totally permanently fix it forever i understand that because it has everything has to go through a few more agency but at that time there are things that you can do right a soft answer turns away wrath i mean there's just certain things in the word that if you you follow that you'll get the right results that's what god's wanting us to get back to now before the fall there was no sorrow there was no pain there was no strain there was no suffering all the work that adam did was fun i know the difference between working and having fun working hard and having fun and working hard and not having fun and hurting there's a big difference but the original the original creation uh there was no pain there was no hurt like today it's like no pain no gain that's not how it was then because there was an equipped and i know that we're not going back to that on this side of the rapture [Laughter] but we are gonna because you have to totally restore the whole planet and that's not gonna happen it's gonna burn but god is restoring us now another aspect to god's image is that god is invisible god is invisible so when he created man he created him invisible amen couldn't see him amen he was invisible in the same image another aspect to god's image according to john 4 is that god is a spirit and so he created man a spirit and not only that in order for adam to worship god he had to worship him in the spirit no different than today no different than today coming in the church and not getting in the spirit is not going to be acceptable it may be good enough for you but it is not for god because the image of god is the spirit another aspect is at the time of god's creation when he created man that god held both male and female inside him and so when he created man he created adam with the masculine and the feminist spirit inside of him that's a scripture we know that now eventually god separated adam into two they were supposed they were both adam still they were both still adam but one was masculine one was female and the female part was called eve but he called him both adam are you with me now just as god separated himself at calvary as it were and he separated the feminist part of him and he put that part in his bride that's why we are a part of god that's why we cannot die that's why nothing can separate us from the love of god you you god can't die and if god is inside of you you can't die and you can't have an identity crisis about this situation i'll say it like this if you're concerned at all about this take the advice of the testimony that we heard today when our sister was told do you have the holy ghost she didn't say well i'll tell you what god met me and you know god came down and i know my sins are forget didn't do that no she didn't do that with the word she went back home and said god there's a holy ghost and it's for me and she got serious so serious it reminded me of what brother brahm told that one story if you don't give me the holy ghost you're going to find my bones here when you return right amen right that's the determination i told her sister the other day her testimony reminded me of when brother branham says i'm so glad god got a hold of me before the church did that's what we need we need to go home and let god get a hold of us amen that's right so we can make this church a better church this this place this body this purpose we know that inside of god are various attributes brother ram talked to us about it and that had not yet been manifested in isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 says for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace so now it looks like we're all over the board here he's a son he's a father he's a counselor he's a mighty god god is more than just a spirit he's more than just a father brother random explained that god is one but he's manifested in three offices he also went on to say that that god is a triune being he has a soul he has a body right the bible says in the beginning was the word and that verse 14 of saint john chapter 1 that word was made flesh the word jesus christ was the body of god the world didn't know it they were blind they spit on them they talked behind his back they they wanted a crew even one of his own disciples said he wasn't worth 30 pieces of silver think about it blind we don't want to stand behind how much god loves us we need that we need that but if that's all we do will never come into the image of christ you can say all day long come to a church and just hear all day long your bride your bride your bride your bride god loves you god loves you you're part of him go out there and get whipped by the devil because you need the life of christ inside of you to beat that devil when you leave here amen so that word has to become manifested in you the bible says that jesus christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil and he has to be manifested in us to destroy the works of the devil that he's trying to do to us he's trying to suppress us and and keep us away from the word and and keep people out of church and keep them from being a witness so you shall receive power you shall be witnesses for me now this is what the devil's doing so we need god inside of us i'm just thinking that i was unable to get to the you know where i wanted to get to so i have to find a place just to stop here because i don't want to just go on but i don't want you to forget where we're at for the next time we get together because we're trying to lay a foundation god is one but he's a triune being and he made man the same way and we're going to be getting into the details of those same things we know god is one first john chapter 5 verse 7 for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three what are one jesus said i and my father are one there's there's one lord one father one spirit one god so god is a triune being and he made man a triune being first god created man in spirit form male and female and he had dominion over things and god wanted him to till the ground but his spirit couldn't till the ground that's what the bible says so he created man a body an outside body i'm just going to throw this sign up here real quick so you get it idea am i allowed to take a little bit more time because of the uh our wonderful testimony so he just created a body and this body had the ability to feel things to see the different plants to taste the mint to to smell the lavender to hear the different things in the garden he was able to make contact with the garden that he wasn't able to do in the spirit amen why are we going through this because i want you to know why you act the way you act amen why you do the way you do and and what we're supposed to be doing because so often when we look at one another we look at one another's face and we say that's who you are but brother man says you're not a body when he they ask the question who what are you he said your soul your soul we're not even the thing we're looking at finally when these bodies are dissolved we have another body weight in us but not the regenerated soul how the tree falls that's the way it lies it's changed here that is the thing that has to change here we are getting a body where we don't get more wrinkles we can hear better but our soul is changed here this is why it's so important to get serious about the word for your personal life brother jonathan could put everything he has into becoming more like christ and brother bob over here because there's no brother bob he could just lala did whatever just not a big deal and never change so we have to put everything we have into changing our soul the nature of the spirit we're going to get into this the body was made when god created the body he created it from the earth the body was not in the image of god that body was in the image of a beast just where all the other animals came it was two separate it was too separate we don't want to put so much emphasis in this flesh it's just a beast and so whether whether we want to say that after the body was created then he put the the the spirit the spirit the spirit let's do that let's put this spirit now brother ram talked about i don't definitely don't want to get into spirit and soul which one is which he taught it both ways but we're going to do the very best to explain it what we feel to help understand so whether you want to say he put this body around the spirit or he created the body and then he put the spirit in it doesn't matter we're a triune being we have a spirit we have a body so far and remember the spirit made contact with god the body made contact with the garden we were created to bring pleasure to god god said there was no man to till the garden so he created man with a purpose to get to work to till the garden to take care of the garden not the spirit the body so our bodies are created for his pleasure amen can you say amen to that our bodies have a purpose now you have a choice do what you want with your body do what you want with your life he gives every man that free moral agency but it's not his will for you to do anything other than the perfect will of god man let's stand together remember flesh and blood will not inherit the kingdom so that outside body is not going to inherit it we do have a another body he looks like we did when we were younger can't wait can't wait to meet him but this flesh it just it's it's going to rot and the more that we can fight against its desire for for whatever for whatever the more we can fight against that the more that we could yield our vessel to be used for the glory of the lord because that's why we were created amen amen amen let's just look to him in a word of prayer our gracious heavenly father we want to thank you you know who we are that word declares you know our frailty you know that we're just flesh we're just humans the lord you also know that inside of us is a part of you you place a german life in us and when your word comes hovers over us it be we begin to be drawn to that word and attached to that word and want to become the manifestation of that word remember that story that brother branham gave about that little eagle egg that got lost in the barn yard and hatched and just seeming so different than everybody else that was there and then one day mother eagle came by and let out her scream and then she knew she knew there was no more confusion her how odd she was she knew who she belonged to and god you sent this message for us you you've opened your word to us that we can know that we are truly your bride and father i pray that you would give us all revelation of this great image that you're bringing us into that we could do our part to to seek after it to hunger after your righteousness and and all that your image is lord i pray that your spirit would come inside of us in a great measure and and that we would spend more time with you and more fellowship and read your word and just grow and grow until we become what you've called us to be lord we commit each of of your of your bride to you lord those that are live streaming those that are not here those that lord are uh have not put their interest where it needs to be the lord i just ask that the holy ghost would help all of us for the time is short we're running out of time to get ready and lord there's one thing lord that you put in our our responsibility list as it were and that is to make ourselves ready to take the word you've given us and to become dressed with it and to seek these things lord take away any spirit from us that is is making us more casual and and more lukewarm lord knowing that you said you would spew that out of your mouth lord we don't want to be away from you we want to be in your arms we're gonna walk with you we want you by our side we want you leading the way like you did the children of israel with the pillar of fire before and and and a cloud oh god we just want you behind us we want you in front of us we want you everywhere around us lord lord if i pray that you take this this message even this morning lord wherever you've touched the hearts of your people lord if their desire is now just to turn more towards you in a more serious way i pray dear god that nothing would keep that from happening lord that that desire that they have would bring forth fruit that they would see more of the love and the joy and the peace and more of the spirit of god just moving in their lives lord bless them as they make preparations lord to seek out more of your image we love you we commit ourselves to you as a as a body and as as individuals dedication to you we give you thanks give you praise and give you honor for without you we can do nothing we thank you in jesus christ precious
