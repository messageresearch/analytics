[37:04] amen amen turn with me if you would to
[37:07] First Peter chapter 1 we got three
[37:09] scripture
[37:10] readings first
[37:13] Peter Ephesians and then second
[37:18] Peter
[37:24] amen we're going to be talking
[37:28] about uh election and being Chosen and
[37:36] predestination so our first scripture
[37:38] here in 1 Peter chapter 1 starting with
[37:41] verse number one and two Peter an
[37:43] apostle of Jesus Christ to The Strangers
[37:47] that are scattered throughout the world
[37:51] amen amen elect they're elect according
[37:56] to the for knowledge of God the Father
[38:00] through sanctification of the spirit
[38:02] unto obedience the sprinkling of the
[38:04] blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and
[38:08] peace be
[38:09] multiplied Ephesians chapter 1 starting
[38:14] with verse number
[38:15] three Ephesians chapter 1 starting with
[38:18] verse number three blessed be the God
[38:21] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[38:23] have blessed us with all spiritual
[38:25] blessings in Heavenly places in
[38:28] Christ
[38:30] according as he has chosen Us in him
[38:36] before the foundation of the world
[38:38] that's righten that we should be holy
[38:41] and Without Blame before him in
[38:43] love having predestinated us unto the
[38:48] adoption of the children by Jesus Christ
[38:52] to him according to the good pleasure of
[38:56] his will I'm just going to drop down to
[38:58] verse 11 and 12 in whom also we have
[39:02] obtained an inheritance being
[39:04] predestinated according to the purpose
[39:06] of him who worketh all things after the
[39:09] counsel of his own will that we should
[39:12] be to the praise of his glory who first
[39:15] trusted in Christ and then in second
[39:21] Peter chapter
[39:25] 1 verses 9 and 10 2 Peter chapter 1: 9
[39:29] and 10 wherefore or verse 9 but he that
[39:33] lackthe things what things is he talking
[39:36] about talking about growing in the
[39:38] virtues of Christ he that's lacking and
[39:40] growing in the virtues of
[39:42] Christ is
[39:45] blind and cannot see a far off and is
[39:50] forgotten that he was purged from his
[39:52] own
[39:53] sins wherefore the rather Brethren give
[39:56] diligence to make your calling and
[39:59] election sure for if you do these things
[40:02] you shall never fall that's right amen
[40:04] God bless you may be
[40:06] seated we're going to toss uh some big
[40:09] words around tonight for knowledge
[40:13] election which actually just means
[40:15] chosen you could use that and
[40:19] predestination first I want to talk
[40:21] about is for
[40:22] knowledge that means for thought it's
[40:25] only mentioned two times in in the Bible
[40:28] amen we know that God is omniscient
[40:31] which means all knowing amen God is
[40:35] aware of the past the present and the
[40:39] future amen all at the same time
[40:43] amen God doesn't have an experience
[40:45] today that helps him to make a better
[40:48] decision tomorrow like you and I we go
[40:51] through experiences and we learn and we
[40:52] say oh I wish I would have known that if
[40:55] I had the wisdom that I had now when I
[40:57] was younger I would have better children
[40:59] and you know I'd make better decisions
[41:01] in life well nothing takes God by
[41:05] surprise God knows
[41:07] everything right God is
[41:10] aware of the past the Bible says we're
[41:14] all going to stand before the Judgment
[41:15] seat of Christ to give an account so
[41:18] he's he's got to know the past if that's
[41:20] going to be true he said he's coming
[41:23] quickly as rewards with him to give
[41:25] every man according to his W his work so
[41:28] he's got to remember our past the Bible
[41:31] says God is Not unrighteous to forget
[41:33] your work and labor of
[41:35] love God is aware of the past God is
[41:39] aware of the present the Bible tells us
[41:41] that he's a present help in a time of
[41:44] trouble amen the Bible says that neither
[41:47] there is any creature that is not made
[41:50] that is not manifest in his sight but
[41:52] all things are naked and open unto the
[41:55] eyes of him with with whom we have to do
[41:59] right amen he knows the present thoughts
[42:02] that we're thinking right now amen he
[42:05] knows the very numbers of our head right
[42:09] this moment and every time we use a
[42:11] brush and a comb what happens when we
[42:13] take a shower what happens I mean we're
[42:15] losing
[42:17] hair so God has a
[42:20] constant he knows amen he knows
[42:23] presently
[42:24] everything God is also a A Ware of our
[42:27] future the Bible says he's the Alpha and
[42:30] the Omega the beginning and the end the
[42:32] first and the last and that's why he
[42:35] could speak things in the beginning and
[42:38] we read them in the book and they're
[42:40] called prophecy the Bible from what I
[42:42] understand there's over 2,000 prophecies
[42:45] in the Bible amen now God could write
[42:49] these because he knew the future before
[42:51] it would
[42:52] happen like a virgin shall conceive 800
[42:55] years before it happened It Was Written
[42:59] many
[43:01] years before it
[43:05] happened or the seed of the woman shall
[43:08] bruise the seed of the serpent maybe
[43:10] 4,000 years before it
[43:12] happened not one time has it ever failed
[43:17] amen the Bible says that Christ was
[43:20] crucified before the foundation of the
[43:22] world so in his thoughts God knew
[43:27] this is very hard for us to to
[43:30] understand this because we live in a
[43:33] present time in the only thing that we
[43:36] have is a memory of the past we could
[43:38] read history books and learn about
[43:41] things in the past but God as we're
[43:45] experiencing this right now and there's
[43:46] not you know any any people sitting here
[43:49] there's no people sitting there there's
[43:50] people sitting here we can experience
[43:53] this right now but God is someone who
[43:57] knows all that at any given moment at at
[44:02] any given time in in in life so we're
[44:05] talking about the foreign knowledge of
[44:06] God we're trying to bring this
[44:09] Foundation because of God's foreign
[44:11] knowledge he knew who would be sitting
[44:14] here in today's service before there was
[44:17] ever a world
[44:21] Amen but he did not make that choice for
[44:26] you he did not make the choice for you
[44:28] to be sitting
[44:30] here you made that choice
[44:34] Amen brother brandham said in the
[44:36] message where I think Pentecost failed
[44:39] he said predestination is not a very
[44:41] good word for the Evangelist or a
[44:43] minister to use but it's kind of
[44:44] confuses the people when you say
[44:47] predestinate in other words God didn't
[44:50] say he's trying to remove some confusion
[44:52] right
[44:53] now God didn't say now I'll make this
[44:57] this man be this and I'll make this man
[45:01] be
[45:02] that but in order to be God he had to
[45:06] know the end from the beginning so by
[45:09] Foreign knowledge he knew he could say
[45:12] this would happen or that would happen
[45:15] right because he was God and he known
[45:19] where everything would be placed amen
[45:22] therefore he could ordain certain things
[45:25] for certain ages so
[45:28] of course we probably knew where Brother
[45:30] Bruce and sister Donna would be sitting
[45:32] because they're always sitting there
[45:34] right but maybe not brother
[45:39] Tyler I'll just say it lat God knew
[45:42] where we'd all be sitting
[45:45] amen and he knew it way before we got
[45:48] here God's for knowledge is awesome amen
[45:52] it's
[45:55] awesome the he knows what we're going
[45:59] through that's why we never have to tell
[46:01] him what we're going
[46:03] through just seek first the kingdom
[46:06] everything's going to be added he knows
[46:08] what we're going through he knows all of
[46:11] our
[46:12] heartaches now just like God did not
[46:16] force us to be here he did not force us
[46:20] to be saved amen right the Bible says we
[46:25] are saved by faith not by
[46:29] force just as God did not force us to be
[46:32] here he did not choose us to be
[46:39] here do you
[46:42] understand if it was about God's
[46:45] choosing then everybody would be saved
[46:48] amen first Titus 2:4 says it was God's
[46:52] if it is it is it is God's will that all
[46:55] men would be saved and come to the
[46:57] knowledge of the truth that's right now
[46:59] if God did the choosing that's what he
[47:01] would choose
[47:04] amen God has given Every Man a free will
[47:07] and he respects that free will he gave
[47:10] it to every man think about Lucifer had
[47:14] a free will he gave it to him he let he
[47:16] still got
[47:19] it God respects Free Will that's why God
[47:24] is not a
[47:25] manipulator and people who manipulate
[47:28] are not being led by the Holy Ghost
[47:30] never never never
[47:33] never
[47:35] never so by God's forign knowledge he
[47:39] knew what choices you would make amen he
[47:43] knew who you would marry before you
[47:45] married
[47:47] them he knew what decision you would
[47:50] choose when God offered eternal life to
[47:55] you God God did not choose those things
[47:58] for us we made those choices so do we
[48:01] understand that as we're moving forward
[48:04] am now on the base of his of his forn
[48:07] knowledge of him knowing everything the
[48:09] decisions that we would make he could
[48:11] elect you or choose
[48:15] you you see the difference because he
[48:19] knew what choice you were going to
[48:22] make and look every seed brings forth of
[48:26] its own kind
[48:27] right
[48:28] and an apple seed never brought forth an
[48:33] orange a seed of God will always bring
[48:36] forth the seed of God Amen a h bread
[48:38] will never bring forth the seed of God
[48:41] Amen so because by his foreign knowledge
[48:45] of him
[48:47] knowing him seeing your love for him him
[48:51] seeing your choice for him him seeing
[48:55] all that he could choose you or elect
[49:00] you are you with me amen Ephesians 1
[49:04] says God chose us or elected Us in
[49:08] him before the foundation of the world
[49:11] Amen so
[49:14] the his choosing is for us to be in him
[49:19] not have our own separate life not do
[49:21] our own
[49:23] thing not just say we belong to God and
[49:26] live whatever kind of life we want he
[49:28] chose us in him of course if we're a
[49:30] seed of God we will bring forth God
[49:34] we've heard if you were a Son of God if
[49:37] you are a son of God you always were a
[49:38] Son of God right so if you're a seed of
[49:42] God you will bring forth God because
[49:44] every seed brings forth of its own kind
[49:47] now we're just kind of lay this Long
[49:49] Foundation you know that's
[49:52] important John
[49:55] 15:16 because we want to be able to
[49:58] understand the scriptures the scriptures
[49:59] do not cross the scriptures right they
[50:01] duvail John 15:16 says you have not
[50:04] chosen me but I have chosen
[50:07] you and ordained you that you should go
[50:12] and bring forth fruit and that your
[50:14] fruit should remain that word chosen
[50:17] means
[50:18] selected before you chose to serve God
[50:23] God chose
[50:25] you now he didn't make the choice for
[50:28] you but he chose
[50:31] you are you with
[50:33] me okay when we the Bible says when we
[50:37] were dead in sins and trespasses we were
[50:40] still chosen of God right Ephesians 2 we
[50:45] walked according to the course of this
[50:46] world we can all put our sself in it we
[50:49] had our conversation in the past the
[50:51] lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires
[50:53] of the Flesh and of the mind and were by
[50:55] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[50:57] others amen when we were in the world
[51:01] you couldn't tell us apart from anybody
[51:03] else in the
[51:05] world but God who is rich in Mercy for
[51:08] his great love wherewith he loved us
[51:12] doesn't the bible say that he didn't
[51:14] choose us because we were great we were
[51:17] more in number there was something
[51:19] special about us he chose us because he
[51:21] loved us
[51:23] amen he put that great love upon us
[51:28] see there's a lot of people that we love
[51:31] or that God
[51:33] loves and they don't choose to love God
[51:38] back because there's something missing
[51:40] inside of them amen there's just
[51:42] something
[51:44] missing sure they'll they'll be loved as
[51:46] long as you want to love them but
[51:50] there's something in them that is
[51:51] strictly living their lives fors their
[51:53] nature is is
[51:55] self-centered
[51:58] but God sees inside of us this desire to
[52:03] manifest Christ amen to not live for
[52:06] self there's a love that we have we want
[52:09] to give our all to God are you with me
[52:14] so we did not choose God God chose us
[52:18] amen let's take a look at Saul or Paul
[52:22] before he was Paul he was
[52:24] Saul he was a murderer
[52:27] he persecuted the Church of the Living
[52:29] God yet before his conversion God said
[52:33] that he is a chosen vessel unto me Amen
[52:38] to Bear my name before the Gentiles and
[52:40] Kings and the children of Israel he was
[52:43] chosen of God and he didn't even know it
[52:47] amen he didn't even know God he was
[52:49] actually fighting against
[52:52] God and the proof that he was chosen of
[52:56] God was
[52:57] manifested when he accepted the light
[53:01] when it was brought to him yes when
[53:03] Jesus shined before him knocked him off
[53:05] his horse and and and and spoke to
[53:09] him he didn't run away he didn't
[53:11] continue to do what he did what he was
[53:15] doing but he turned
[53:18] around he turned his life
[53:21] around he
[53:23] repented what would thou have me to do
[53:25] Lord
[53:27] amen that was the manifestation that he
[53:30] was
[53:30] chosen right come on now this ought to
[53:33] be super duper encouraging really really
[53:36] should be because you know we all want
[53:39] some some sort of something real
[53:43] Supernatural to happen in our life to to
[53:46] give us that assurance that we're Chosen
[53:48] and you don't want to do that you don't
[53:51] want to do
[53:53] that now the proof that we're chosen is
[53:58] not because we feel we're
[54:01] chosen or that we're going to church or
[54:04] that were're in the
[54:05] message or that we accepted the
[54:10] prophet Paul did not walk in just part
[54:15] of the light he just didn't say Okay God
[54:17] I'm sorry I won't persecute your church
[54:19] no
[54:21] more and I'll start you know being a
[54:24] Believer I'll hang out with the
[54:25] disciples
[54:29] and that that's all you heard of
[54:31] them he continued to walk in the light
[54:34] amen as God gave him more light he
[54:36] walked in it amen every day God told him
[54:39] to go do something he'd go do it that is
[54:42] the proof that you are called that
[54:45] you're called you're chosen you're
[54:47] elected
[54:49] amen too many
[54:52] people
[54:55] stop and yet they still
[55:00] feel they're called they're elected and
[55:02] and and the Bible tells us that we have
[55:04] to make our calling and election sure
[55:07] Paul or Peter told us to do
[55:10] that and if Peter said to do that then I
[55:13] think we should do
[55:15] that now for the genuine believer
[55:17] there's a real Security in being chosen
[55:20] or
[55:22] predestinated but for the person who is
[55:25] not making sure
[55:27] who's not being diligent about it it's a
[55:30] false sense of
[55:34] security you know this message teaches
[55:36] you that you're
[55:39] chosen be because you're in the message
[55:42] and God called you out of
[55:44] denomination how many people have come
[55:46] out of denomination came into the
[55:48] message and then left
[55:50] God it's not the evidence that you're
[55:54] chosen it's a good start
[55:57] but look every time God comes and he
[55:59] brings us new truth we've got to walk in
[56:02] that truth there's the evidence you know
[56:06] brother braham's you always talking
[56:08] about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and
[56:10] speak not speaking in tongues and this
[56:12] and that and uh you know putting your
[56:15] name on the book and I belong to this
[56:18] church and I burn candles and so many
[56:20] different
[56:24] things but he taught us the truth
[56:26] evidence is when you receive all the
[56:28] word amen not just say mentally I
[56:32] believe it that the Bible is true but
[56:34] that our our life manifest what the word
[56:37] is saying so that's a huge
[56:40] responsibility but by God's forn
[56:42] knowledge he chose us he elected us
[56:45] that's why the Bible says who can lay
[56:47] anything to the charge of God's elect he
[56:50] chose us he set his love on us if God be
[56:54] for us who can be against us
[56:57] right so by God's for knowledge he could
[57:00] elect us or he could choose
[57:05] us
[57:07] and because we're chosen because we're
[57:13] elected he can predestinate us so it
[57:16] starts with forn
[57:18] knowledge he
[57:20] chooses and then he predestines us to a
[57:24] destiny now what's the destiny we've
[57:26] been predestinated to be conformed to
[57:28] the image of the son of of God Amen the
[57:31] end result is we're going to be just
[57:33] like him when he appears now we're not
[57:36] going to get there by just sitting in
[57:38] church just belonging to a message
[57:40] church just saying that uh I I believe
[57:43] the M are even listening to the tapes
[57:45] we've got to become what the word says
[57:48] we're going to become and we've got to
[57:50] become Miss Jesus just have to
[57:54] be amen
[58:01] God can predestinate or if I could say
[58:04] it like this predetermine certain things
[58:07] to happen now in your life amen these
[58:12] things are going to
[58:14] happen just like he did the thousands
[58:17] and thousands of things in the Bible he
[58:20] spoke them before they happen and he can
[58:23] do the same in our lives because it's no
[58:25] different
[58:27] right Romans
[58:30] 8:28 says we know that all things work
[58:34] together for the good to a certain group
[58:37] of people that's right it's them that
[58:40] love God remember brother R says you
[58:42] love God he says make sure that make
[58:44] sure that's it's the most important
[58:46] thing to love God to the degree to the
[58:51] degree that he loves us with right he
[58:54] told us to love one another just as he
[58:57] loved us that's right right amen okay so
[59:00] all things work together for the good to
[59:02] them that love God to them now he
[59:05] describes this group who loves God to
[59:08] them who are the called according to his
[59:13] purpose in other words um I love you
[59:17] this much I love you brother bman I love
[59:21] you this much I love you that I'll
[59:24] scratch your back if you scratch
[59:28] mine I'll do this for you if you do that
[59:31] for
[59:32] me now that's the love that we were born
[59:35] with amen and when we don't get what we
[59:38] want we got a lot of
[59:41] enemies because that's the purpose of
[59:45] our calling our first birth was
[59:49] selfish you you climb on one another to
[59:52] get to the top you manipulate things you
[59:55] manipulate situ
[59:57] ations but our calling from God is
[1:00:01] according to his
[1:00:04] purpose so when we love God to the place
[1:00:09] that our whole life is for his purpose
[1:00:12] then this is the group we're talking
[1:00:14] about right here see many are called but
[1:00:17] few are
[1:00:19] chosen for whom he did for
[1:00:22] know he also did predestinate so for
[1:00:26] knowledge to predestination to be
[1:00:28] conformed to the image of the his son
[1:00:31] that we that he would be the firstborn
[1:00:34] among many
[1:00:36] Brethren now like I we have seven
[1:00:39] children when we just had our first
[1:00:41] child we had no idea that there was
[1:00:44] going to be six more we just
[1:00:47] didn't nobody told
[1:00:52] us but pretty soon abig had sisters and
[1:01:00] brothers and God by his forn knowledge
[1:01:03] could look and said that there's going
[1:01:05] to be many just like
[1:01:08] Jesus amen he could for from the
[1:01:12] beginning he could he could see that
[1:01:15] moreover whom he did
[1:01:18] predestinate them he also
[1:01:21] called and whom he called he's all he he
[1:01:26] also Justified them right and then that
[1:01:28] he justified he's already glorified it's
[1:01:31] a done deal for the True Believer amen
[1:01:35] the one that truly has fallen so in love
[1:01:38] with God has given their life to Jesus
[1:01:41] Christ
[1:01:43] amen I think we need to be very careful
[1:01:45] about our personal views about
[1:01:47] predestination
[1:01:49] election what I mean by that it's one
[1:01:51] thing to mentally believe that we're
[1:01:54] Chosen and it's another thing to be sure
[1:01:56] of
[1:01:57] it
[1:01:59] amen we can start off with Christ and be
[1:02:01] on the right
[1:02:03] track and later become unfruitful not
[1:02:06] continuing that hunger and that thirst
[1:02:09] and you know how it was when we first
[1:02:10] got saved listening the tapes Lord use
[1:02:13] me I want to be more like you you just
[1:02:15] digging into the
[1:02:17] word well most people that come to
[1:02:20] Christ that is the beginning of their
[1:02:23] experience but do they stay on that
[1:02:26] track now I I'm I'm saying we all go
[1:02:30] through valleys okay we all go through
[1:02:34] valleys but we just don't I'm just going
[1:02:36] to stay here and it's okay I'm still
[1:02:38] chosen that that's that's the wrong
[1:02:41] Spirit I'm telling you
[1:02:43] amen look at the the children of Israel
[1:02:46] they they they came out of
[1:02:50] Egypt with a great
[1:02:53] Victory but they never labor bered to
[1:02:56] enter the promised land they we too
[1:02:59] scared a lot of people are too
[1:03:02] scared to to give their life to Jesus
[1:03:05] Christ to be honest with you they don't
[1:03:06] got time they got other Ambitions they
[1:03:09] want to do other things they're they're
[1:03:11] just satisfied in this complacency of
[1:03:15] lukewarmness of just being a good
[1:03:17] Christian good church
[1:03:19] member and they they never go on to get
[1:03:22] the full
[1:03:24] manifestation of Jesus Christ they don't
[1:03:26] even pursue it like they they ought to
[1:03:33] be second Peter's I know it's awful
[1:03:35] quiet that's I know it's a sobering
[1:03:37] thought but it's a true one it's a true
[1:03:40] one we're stuck in leod deia Leo deia is
[1:03:43] here amen there's a lot of people that
[1:03:46] are lukewarm they're not hot they're not
[1:03:49] cold that's how Jesus identified them
[1:03:52] amen and it's a spirit we're not the
[1:03:55] Church of
[1:03:57] Leia we're we're we're in the age where
[1:04:00] Leo deia is and that Spirit filters in
[1:04:03] our homes it filters in in the in our
[1:04:06] our radio it's everywhere it comes into
[1:04:08] our mind and if we listen to it then we
[1:04:10] will become more
[1:04:12] lukewarm so we've got to we got to fight
[1:04:15] that thing second Peter verse chapter 1
[1:04:19] verse 5 says and besides this give all
[1:04:22] diligence not some but give all
[1:04:24] diligence add to your faith virtue your
[1:04:27] virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance
[1:04:29] Temperance patience patience godliness
[1:04:31] and godly kindness uh and godliness
[1:04:34] brotherly kindness and brotherly
[1:04:36] kindness charity so if you were going to
[1:04:38] start a new
[1:04:40] job and they said uh um you're going to
[1:04:44] have to learn these rules I'm going to
[1:04:47] give you these rules and you're going to
[1:04:48] have to learn them before you start and
[1:04:52] you're going to be tested as soon as you
[1:04:53] came in you know you couldn't start
[1:04:56] working until you passed the test amen
[1:05:00] now to me God has given us what we need
[1:05:03] to do amen if we're done with one thing
[1:05:06] we should be adding another we should be
[1:05:09] working on the virtues of Christ the
[1:05:11] character of Jesus Christ is not just
[1:05:13] some nice words this is a personal Love
[1:05:15] Letter to who the elected that's who
[1:05:19] it's
[1:05:20] to for if these things be in you and
[1:05:24] abound they make you that you shall
[1:05:26] neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the
[1:05:28] knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:05:31] he that lath these things is blind he
[1:05:32] cannot see a far off and has forgotten
[1:05:34] that he was purged from his old sins I'm
[1:05:37] not saying he forgot
[1:05:39] Calvary he forgot how real Calvary was
[1:05:42] to him understand the difference he
[1:05:45] didn't forget Calvary he forgot what
[1:05:48] Calvary once meant to him
[1:05:51] amen
[1:05:53] wherefore the rather brethren
[1:05:56] give diligence to make your calling an
[1:06:00] election
[1:06:02] sure for if you do if you do give
[1:06:06] diligence to make your call election
[1:06:08] sure you shall never
[1:06:11] fall but if you just oh yeah I'm
[1:06:15] predestinated I'm in I just know
[1:06:21] it give diligence to make your calling
[1:06:25] an election what does that mean it means
[1:06:29] keep adding like
[1:06:32] crazy get in love with Jesus that you
[1:06:34] want to become more like him that's what
[1:06:37] it means let's take a look at Judas turn
[1:06:40] with me to John chapter 6 are you
[1:06:42] getting something out of this message
[1:06:45] all right I want to take a look at Judas
[1:06:48] for a
[1:06:50] moment and I want to start with verse
[1:06:52] number
[1:06:54] 60 many therefore of his disciples when
[1:06:58] they heard this said this is a hard
[1:07:01] saying who can hear it you ever been to
[1:07:04] church here to Harvard say and said man
[1:07:05] I I I can't hear
[1:07:07] that right all right this is kind of
[1:07:11] where they were when Jesus knew in
[1:07:14] himself that his disciples murmured he
[1:07:17] said unto them does this offend
[1:07:21] you what and if you shall see the son of
[1:07:24] man Ascend up to where he was
[1:07:30] before it is the spirit that quickeneth
[1:07:34] the flesh can't profit us anything the
[1:07:37] words that I speak Jesus
[1:07:39] said unto you they are spirit and they
[1:07:43] are
[1:07:45] life but there are some of you that
[1:07:48] don't believe
[1:07:49] it for Jesus knew from the beginning who
[1:07:52] it was who they were
[1:07:56] that believe not and who should betray
[1:07:59] him so here's the you know Jesus got
[1:08:01] this for knowledge because he's the word
[1:08:05] amen he's the one that created
[1:08:07] everything so he he knows who is and who
[1:08:11] isn't am and the word always separates
[1:08:14] right does the
[1:08:18] separating and he said therefore said I
[1:08:21] unto you that no man can come unto me
[1:08:23] except it were given unto him of my
[1:08:26] father from that time many of his
[1:08:28] disciples went back and walked no more
[1:08:31] with him in other words they left church
[1:08:34] yes they went and found somebody else
[1:08:37] who believed like they believed
[1:08:40] amen
[1:08:42] sad then said Jesus unto the 12 not to
[1:08:47] the 11 but to the
[1:08:50] 12 will ye also go
[1:08:54] away this then Simon Peter answered himl
[1:08:57] to whom shall we go thou has has the
[1:09:00] words of eternal life and we believe and
[1:09:02] are sure that thou art the Christ the
[1:09:04] son of the Living God and Jesus answered
[1:09:07] them what a a tremendous thing to say he
[1:09:09] he could have almost just said
[1:09:12] amen but he said have not I chosen you
[1:09:17] 12 and one of you is a devil that's
[1:09:22] right he chose a devil
[1:09:27] he elected a
[1:09:33] devil and he spake of Judas es scariot
[1:09:36] the son of Simon for he it was that
[1:09:39] should betray him being one of the 12
[1:09:43] yes so he chose or elected a devil so
[1:09:48] that's why I say like
[1:09:52] this it's not good enough to say that
[1:09:54] we're chos or we
[1:09:57] elected we we don't want to just stay
[1:09:59] there that is not a good
[1:10:03] evidence he chose all
[1:10:07] 12 and one was a
[1:10:09] devil if I could say this chosen for a
[1:10:14] different purpose because this message I
[1:10:16] I I didn't at the beginning I just I
[1:10:18] threw it a title out there chosen for a
[1:10:22] purpose he was chosen for for a
[1:10:25] different purpose still chosen but for a
[1:10:28] different purpose he was a devil now
[1:10:31] that word devil means a
[1:10:35] transducer if you look it
[1:10:38] up now that means one who attacks the
[1:10:43] reputation of another by
[1:10:46] slander or labels them or
[1:10:50] backbiting one who belittles the worth
[1:10:53] of something or someone of course
[1:10:56] he belittled the worth of Jesus only
[1:10:58] thinking he was worth 30 pieces of
[1:11:02] silver now this same word devil the
[1:11:05] meaning of this word devil is used in 2
[1:11:08] Timothy chapter 3 under false accusers
[1:11:12] in the last day there shall be false
[1:11:16] accusers
[1:11:18] chosen of
[1:11:21] God for a purpose amen the said the
[1:11:25] message questions and answers number
[1:11:27] three he says now watch that
[1:11:30] pattern I'm taking a lot of time but
[1:11:33] look Judas es scariot followed those
[1:11:36] same tracks he was justified by
[1:11:40] Believing on the Lord
[1:11:41] Jesus and then accepting him as his
[1:11:45] personal
[1:11:46] savior he was
[1:11:50] Sanctified and give power to cast out
[1:11:54] spirits put his name on The Book of
[1:11:59] Life but when it come to Pentecost and
[1:12:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:12:05] fullness of the word he showed his
[1:12:08] colors that's exactly what the Canaan
[1:12:11] spies did and that's exactly what Esau
[1:12:18] did so this
[1:12:21] is if I'm understanding
[1:12:24] correctly
[1:12:25] Judas should have never said I I believe
[1:12:29] on the Lord Jesus I accept him as my
[1:12:32] personal savior I I I I'm I'm Sanctified
[1:12:35] I've got power to cast out Devils he
[1:12:37] shouldn't looked at
[1:12:41] that as to know that he's chosen by
[1:12:46] God but he should
[1:12:49] have he should have been diligent in
[1:12:51] making sure that his calling and
[1:12:53] election was really sure
[1:12:56] are you with me by continuing to walk in
[1:12:59] the truth but he
[1:13:01] didn't he went his selfish way for
[1:13:05] himself at the end of the
[1:13:08] ministry are you with
[1:13:12] me the present stage of my Ministry
[1:13:16] brother B says you think Judas known he
[1:13:20] was playing the part of Judas it's
[1:13:23] question he says you you think Pharaoh
[1:13:26] known he was playing the part when God
[1:13:28] raised him up for that
[1:13:30] purpose you think Esau would have done
[1:13:33] the things that he did certainly not
[1:13:37] said they got eyes and they can't see
[1:13:40] they got ears and they can't hear but
[1:13:43] watch the scripture just unfolding see
[1:13:46] we're at the end time it's got to be
[1:13:49] this
[1:13:51] way and it you know as you read in the
[1:13:55] these little
[1:13:56] incidences about Judas it seems like he
[1:14:01] really didn't
[1:14:02] know and you know we look at him now we
[1:14:05] say oh yeah he was a devil but you know
[1:14:06] he was probably one of the
[1:14:10] best best Brothers in the church he he
[1:14:12] took care of the offering
[1:14:15] right he was the one that that spoke up
[1:14:18] I think and and said well why are we
[1:14:19] wasting this oil you know we could have
[1:14:21] sold it and and and and gave the money
[1:14:23] to the poor I mean he he was at one time
[1:14:27] uh rooting
[1:14:30] for for the for for the Church of Jesus
[1:14:35] Christ but he didn't make his calling in
[1:14:38] his election
[1:14:40] sure and I think there's going to be a
[1:14:42] lot of people in this
[1:14:44] age that just too lazy to do
[1:14:48] that I I don't mean it wrong but look
[1:14:51] there's nothing that we can
[1:14:54] do to make the unelect elected not a
[1:14:58] thing I don't care how the word is
[1:15:00] preached I don't care what is said and
[1:15:03] there's nothing that can be done to make
[1:15:06] those that are truly elected of God to
[1:15:08] not make
[1:15:10] it the foundation of God standing the
[1:15:13] sure God knoweth them that are H there
[1:15:15] is it's going to happen but I'm when we
[1:15:18] preach of course we're preaching that
[1:15:20] everybody's elect everybody amen but the
[1:15:23] thing is only the they're going to catch
[1:15:26] it if our gospel be hid is hid to them
[1:15:30] that are lost in whom the God of this
[1:15:32] world have blinded the minds of who them
[1:15:35] which believe not see the choice that we
[1:15:39] make I'm going to love this word I'm
[1:15:41] going to put this word first in my life
[1:15:44] or you know I'm just going to be the
[1:15:46] best you know church member I can
[1:15:50] be Luke 22 verse1 now I we got just a
[1:15:54] little little bit time we can talk about
[1:15:56] a little bit more about
[1:15:58] Judas all right say Amen so I can like
[1:16:01] continue going now the Feast of
[1:16:03] unleavened bread Luke 221 now the Feast
[1:16:06] of unleavened bread Drew nigh which is
[1:16:09] called the Passover and the chief
[1:16:11] priests and the scribes sought how they
[1:16:12] might kill Judas oh I'm sorry how they
[1:16:16] might kill Jesus for they feared the
[1:16:18] people then look at this then then then
[1:16:21] then then entered Satan into Judas right
[1:16:25] surname a scariot be being of the number
[1:16:30] of the
[1:16:32] 12 see we can't look at a person today
[1:16:35] and just say oh because of where they're
[1:16:37] at
[1:16:39] today we don't want to label
[1:16:41] people we want to follow we want to if I
[1:16:45] could say like this we want to follow
[1:16:46] one another as you're following Christ
[1:16:49] right as long as we're following Christ
[1:16:52] the person that you're you're talking to
[1:16:54] the person you're hanging out with if
[1:16:56] they're following Christ with all their
[1:16:58] heart I say you know praise the Lord but
[1:17:02] you need to be very
[1:17:04] diligent if they're leading you to a
[1:17:08] slack it's okay if you
[1:17:11] don't in a need of nothing I'm I'm just
[1:17:13] fine you got to get away from that thing
[1:17:17] right the the Bible says um is them
[1:17:21] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:17:23] the power of
[1:17:25] what's the what's the next verse
[1:17:28] say huh from such turn
[1:17:33] away that's us not somebody making us do
[1:17:37] it not it's our
[1:17:40] choice we we've got to turn away from
[1:17:43] it all right let's drop down to John
[1:17:46] Chapter 13 now this just so you know
[1:17:52] skipping a lot of notes Here
[1:17:55] John 13 I wish I had probably two
[1:17:59] services on this subject just in this
[1:18:03] chapter verse one now behold the Feast
[1:18:08] of the Passover when Jesus knew that his
[1:18:10] hour has come that he should depart out
[1:18:12] of this world unto the father having
[1:18:14] loved his own that were in the world he
[1:18:18] loved them unto the end now that's what
[1:18:21] we need to do right there love God to
[1:18:23] the end and supper being ended the devil
[1:18:29] having now put in the heart of judas's
[1:18:33] scariot Simon's
[1:18:35] son to betray him amen so when we think
[1:18:39] of
[1:18:40] Judas he he wasn't thinking anything
[1:18:42] like this when he was walking with Jesus
[1:18:45] right nothing amen this all got
[1:18:48] concocted at the End
[1:18:51] Amen and what I love about this chapter
[1:18:55] he has communion with his chosen
[1:19:00] disciples he even gets down and washes
[1:19:03] the feet of Judas right amen and what
[1:19:07] he's doing he's proving that his love
[1:19:11] for Judas is greater yes that he could
[1:19:15] actually love I believe I don't mean
[1:19:18] this
[1:19:21] wrong God
[1:19:23] loves
[1:19:26] loves how do I say this word God could
[1:19:30] have eliminated Lucifer just like that
[1:19:33] but he didn't he allowed him to go on
[1:19:37] Amen the Bible says that Jesus knew from
[1:19:40] the beginning about Judas amen still
[1:19:42] chose him but he let him go
[1:19:46] on and God still loved
[1:19:49] Judas yeah and when he was betrayed he
[1:19:53] said
[1:19:55] why do you betray me with a
[1:19:58] kiss he called him a friend yes amen he
[1:20:02] truly loved him I want to tell you here
[1:20:06] what Psalms 41:9 says he says yay my old
[1:20:11] familiar
[1:20:13] friend in whom I
[1:20:16] trusted which did eat of my bread and
[1:20:20] have lifted up his heel against
[1:20:23] me
[1:20:25] you know God loves us and he trusts
[1:20:29] us
[1:20:30] amen now we've got to love him back and
[1:20:35] trust him that what that word is telling
[1:20:37] us to do we're just going to do it we're
[1:20:39] going to be
[1:20:40] fightful we're going to get more of God
[1:20:43] in our life we're going to get God in
[1:20:44] our homes we're going to see him move
[1:20:46] like he hasn't moved before we're not
[1:20:48] going to wait for something to happen
[1:20:49] and say okay yeah I better get serious
[1:20:51] today is the day today is the day we got
[1:20:55] to hear the voice of God not the voice
[1:20:56] of John the voice of God
[1:21:02] Amen and we if we had time Matthew 27: 9
[1:21:06] and 10 they talk about where Jes the God
[1:21:10] could foretell what was going to happen
[1:21:13] with
[1:21:19] Judas and even though look at this I I
[1:21:22] just I just I I need to read this
[1:21:25] because this this is the fear of God for
[1:21:28] me Judas 27:3 then Judas which had
[1:21:31] betrayed him when he saw that he had con
[1:21:33] that he was condemned he repented
[1:21:35] himself and brought again the 30 pieces
[1:21:38] of silver to the chief priests and the
[1:21:39] elders saying I have sinned in that I
[1:21:43] betrayed the innocent blood and they
[1:21:45] said what is it to
[1:21:48] us see thou to that that's none of my
[1:21:52] doing and he cast down the the the
[1:21:55] pieces of silver in the temple and he
[1:21:58] departed and he went and hanged
[1:22:03] himself so before he died he realized
[1:22:07] that he did
[1:22:09] wrong see Satan I hate Satan I hate him
[1:22:13] the
[1:22:14] deception that he doesn't tell you the
[1:22:17] whole story before he wants you to go do
[1:22:20] something it's a lot of times when
[1:22:22] you're mad at somebody because they did
[1:22:24] something wrong the only thing that you
[1:22:26] can see is how wrong they are by how
[1:22:28] they're acting how they're yelling
[1:22:30] whatever is going on right amen and
[1:22:32] because you're staring at that you feel
[1:22:34] you have a right to to to to to to put
[1:22:37] them in their place but then afterwards
[1:22:40] I got to say sorry
[1:22:45] too and he doesn't show you that because
[1:22:47] he's trying to get you to to step into
[1:22:49] that all right Romans chapter
[1:22:53] n oh my my my are you going to bear with
[1:22:56] me a few more extra minutes
[1:22:58] tonight Romans chapter 9 I just showing
[1:23:03] God's for knowledge verse 10 and not
[1:23:05] only this but when Rebecca also had
[1:23:07] conceived by one even by Our Father
[1:23:09] Isaac for the children being not yet
[1:23:12] born neither having done any good or
[1:23:14] evil that the purpose of God according
[1:23:18] to election might stand not of works but
[1:23:21] of him that calleth that's right it was
[1:23:24] said said unto her the Elder Shall Serve
[1:23:26] the younger as it is written Jacob have
[1:23:29] I loved but Esau have I hated
[1:23:34] amen now I I'll just say it like this
[1:23:38] Jacob was willing to do anything to get
[1:23:42] born again
[1:23:46] amen and
[1:23:48] Esau did not care enough about being
[1:23:52] born again I just that's just the facts
[1:23:55] and because of the attitude God saw that
[1:24:00] Jacob had a love for
[1:24:02] him and that love is what made God love
[1:24:05] him more and there was that Bond there
[1:24:08] that nothing could separate them but now
[1:24:12] Esau he got separated from the love of
[1:24:15] God because he
[1:24:18] chose to
[1:24:20] love the things that were pleasing to
[1:24:23] his flesh
[1:24:25] come on this is just this is word I I
[1:24:28] know I'm not an evangelist but this is
[1:24:29] the
[1:24:30] word and we got to understand our our
[1:24:33] attitude about the New Birth it's really
[1:24:35] important yes and we can say yes I'm
[1:24:38] born again because I did this and I did
[1:24:41] that look Judas was justified Sanctified
[1:24:44] was able to cast out Devils but he was
[1:24:47] still
[1:24:48] missing and we got to keep pressing on
[1:24:50] until we get the full complete New Birth
[1:24:56] amen don't let the devil try to talk you
[1:25:01] out of that that's right now if we're
[1:25:04] chosen of God then we're chosen for a
[1:25:06] purpose to fulfill his
[1:25:09] will amen not ours when we come to
[1:25:12] Christ we had our own will when we we
[1:25:15] come to God now we're doing his will
[1:25:17] right we're born by the will of God to
[1:25:19] do the will of God all things become God

[1:25:26] scriptures I'm just going back to our
[1:25:28] beginning Now 1 Peter chapter 1 verse

[1:25:34] according to the for knowledge of
[1:25:38] God the Father through a process of
[1:25:43] sanctification so we have to go through
[1:25:45] a process of sanctification God has to
[1:25:47] clean up our life we have to get rid of
[1:25:49] things that are there amen through the
[1:25:52] sanctification of the spirit
[1:25:54] unto a place that we become completely
[1:25:59] obedient to God that's right it's this
[1:26:02] is God foresees that this is what's
[1:26:05] going to happen to his
[1:26:08] elect and the sprinkling of the blood of
[1:26:10] Jesus Christ we can't make it without
[1:26:12] the blood we just

[1:27:37] of him who works out all things after
[1:27:41] the counsel of his own will amen that we

[1:28:27] do with me and I must come under
[1:28:31] subjection to the good pleasure of his
[1:28:33] will I must do the will he wants me to
[1:28:36] do I can't I can't be out of the will of

[1:28:58] do but we're we're we're we're talking
[1:29:00] about a Rapture right it's it's it's
[1:29:03] nothing we you know we know you know

[1:29:12] preaches it all day long right right he
[1:29:15] just comes in our thoughts and he he
[1:29:17] speaks to us but we are not going to
[1:29:19] listen to that amen amen amen all right
[1:29:22] let's turn to claan chapter
[1:29:25] 3 Colossians 3 verse number 12 Judas
[1:29:36] fell he did not he lost the fear of
[1:29:40] Jesus at one time he wanted to please
[1:29:43] him and he lost
[1:29:45] that he got off hold of a spirit that
[1:29:48] didn't need Jesus Anymore didn't need
[1:29:50] the word
[1:29:52] anymore he didn't keep making sure that
[1:29:56] he was where Christ wanted him to be
[1:29:58] because all the time Jesus would say
[1:29:59] this go here go do this go do that this
[1:30:01] is where we're going this is going to
[1:30:03] happen and he got to a point where he
[1:30:06] didn't need to get that involved with
[1:30:08] the church anymore he didn't need to get
[1:30:10] that involved with Jesus he kind of was
[1:30:12] on the background in fact he was going
[1:30:14] to use Jesus for his own self purposes
[1:30:18] right amen he didn't make his calling an
[1:30:22] election sure but this I say to you as
[1:30:25] the elect of
[1:30:27] God Colossians 3:12 put on therefore as
[1:30:31] the elect of God holy and
[1:30:35] beloved vows of mercy and kindness
[1:30:40] humbleness of Mind
[1:30:43] meekness
[1:30:45] longsuffering forbearing one another
[1:30:48] forgiving one another If any man ever
[1:30:51] quel against e any even as Christ
[1:30:54] forgave you so also do
[1:30:57] ye that's a lot of things to do don't
[1:30:59] you think right there the elect has to
[1:31:02] you
[1:31:03] know it it takes a bigger man to live
[1:31:06] the life it doesn't take that big of a
[1:31:09] man to look at somebody as a Christian
[1:31:11] and say well you're a Christian you
[1:31:13] should you have to forgive
[1:31:15] me it doesn't take a big man to do that
[1:31:18] it takes a big man to actually forgive
[1:31:20] him when the man is acting like that so
[1:31:23] this is a a a big thing but this is what
[1:31:25] the elect are doing they're doing this
[1:31:29] and above all these
[1:31:33] things put on the love of God right
[1:31:37] which is the bond of perfectness amen
[1:31:41] and let the peace of God ruin your
[1:31:43] hearts to which also you are called into
[1:31:46] one body and be ye thankful let the word
[1:31:50] of Christ dwell in you richly in all
[1:31:51] wisdom teaching and admonishing one
[1:31:53] another in Psalms and hymns and
[1:31:55] spiritual songs singing with Grace in
[1:31:56] your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever
[1:31:58] you do in word whatsoever you do in deed
[1:32:02] amen do all in the name of the Lord
[1:32:04] Jesus giving thanks to God and the
[1:32:07] father by him amen and the scripture
[1:32:10] just keeps going wives submit yourselves
[1:32:12] to your own husband as it is fit in the
[1:32:14] Lord husbands love your wives and be not
[1:32:16] bitter to them children obey your
[1:32:18] parents in all things fathers provoke
[1:32:20] not your children to anger servants obey

[1:33:42] I'm going to be closing with this I just
[1:33:44] want to say a couple things here we know
[1:33:48] that Jesus had his name on The Book of
[1:33:50] Life but it was blotted out he was chose
[1:33:52] for a different purpose and the Bible
[1:33:55] says Jesus said that in the last days
[1:33:57] the two Spirits would be so close that
[1:34:00] it would deceive the very elected if it
[1:34:02] were
[1:34:04] possible can you say Amen to the word
[1:34:06] amen amen now there is a mimicking going
[1:34:10] on not so much of people but of spirits
[1:34:14] and
[1:34:15] people there's those that are confident
[1:34:18] and there's those that are
[1:34:21] overconfident right there's those that
[1:34:23] are are walking in most of the truth and
[1:34:25] those that are walking in all the truth
[1:34:28] are you with me these Spirits are so
[1:34:30] close now one Spirit the religious hoty
[1:34:34] spirit of leoda is constantly saying the
[1:34:38] spirit is saying not the people but
[1:34:40] their spirit is saying I am in need of
[1:34:44] nothing now the other spirit it's a
[1:34:47] humble spirit it's I believe it's the
[1:34:50] spirit of the bride and they're saying
[1:34:54] not that I have already attained or
[1:34:57] already
[1:34:59] apprehended but I'm pressing towards the
[1:35:02] mark for the prize of the high calling
[1:35:04] in Christ Jesus I'm am pressing towards
[1:35:08] what my
[1:35:10] predestination I'm I'm pressing towards
[1:35:13] my predestination what I've been
[1:35:16] predestinated to to be conformed to the
[1:35:19] image of Jesus Christ
[1:35:21] amen now notice
[1:35:24] in John or Revelations the last book of
[1:35:27] the Bible this is my last scripture and
[1:35:30] then we're
[1:35:34] done the the bride never says that she's
[1:35:38] ready I want us to catch this the bride
[1:35:42] never said she was
[1:35:51] ready I I I think we should we we should
[1:35:54] we should cling to this thing because uh
[1:35:56] Leo deia says I'm in need of nothing
[1:36:00] right but the bride doesn't say
[1:36:03] that Revelations 196 John heard as it
[1:36:06] were the voice of a great
[1:36:10] multitude and as the voice of many
[1:36:13] Waters and as the voice of Mighty
[1:36:17] Thunder saying hallelujah for the Lord
[1:36:20] God omnipotent reign
[1:36:24] Amen Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:36:28] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:36:30] Lamb is come and his wife have made
[1:36:34] herself
[1:36:35] ready there is a
[1:36:38] group that is pressing towards that
[1:36:41] image amen now it's not so much
[1:36:45] naturally I got to have my hair just
[1:36:47] perfect my dress just perfect my my
[1:36:49] speech just perfect but there's a real
[1:36:52] concern of their character
[1:36:54] a real concern of their virtues that
[1:36:56] they're really trying to add more of
[1:36:58] Christ in their life they're not sitting
[1:37:00] in a leod DEA just you know going from
[1:37:03] week to week to church and and just you
[1:37:05] know once in a while trying to get into
[1:37:07] Christ no there's a real pressing in
[1:37:11] because we have to get ready right and
[1:37:13] to her was granted that she should be ar
[1:37:15] raay in fine linen clean and white for
[1:37:18] the fine linen is the righteousness of
[1:37:20] the Saints and he saith unto me write
[1:37:23] blessed are they which are called unto
[1:37:26] the marriage of the supper of the lamb
[1:37:28] and he saith unto me these are the true
[1:37:32] says of God Amen let's Stand Together
[1:37:36] the bride of Christ keeps receiving the
[1:37:39] word and she keeps manifesting the word
[1:37:44] and she'll keep doing that till Jesus
[1:37:48] comes and that's what it means to do
[1:37:51] everything you can to make yourself
[1:37:53] ready amen you can't look at a preacher
[1:37:55] what the last thing you you want to do
[1:37:57] is look at a somebody that you have
[1:37:59] confidence in and just say you know uh
[1:38:04] they say looking for someone to say yes
[1:38:07] you're living such a a good life you're
[1:38:10] the
[1:38:11] bride don't you don't want that what you
[1:38:14] want to do is you want to look at the
[1:38:15] word every time you read it and if the
[1:38:18] word says this is what I want you to do
[1:38:20] and you start doing it that's a greater
[1:38:22] evidence am that is the evidence that
[1:38:25] you're looking
[1:38:26] for if our hearts condemn us not then we
[1:38:28] have confidence towards God if if if
[1:38:31] they they convict us then we start doing
[1:38:33] it and then we got confidence towards
[1:38:35] God see we walk in the confidence of the
[1:38:40] word amen amen let's let's go to the
