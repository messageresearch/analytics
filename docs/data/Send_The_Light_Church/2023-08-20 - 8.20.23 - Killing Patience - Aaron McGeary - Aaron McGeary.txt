Heart Lord all things Lord you give to us freely because you love us and we want to give to you freely yes sir to the dictates of our hearts Lord not only in offerings Lord which we know we need to do Lord but just in our hearts um that you might receive them in the int that uh we desire desire it excuse me so Lord as we come to this part of the service Lord we just pray that uh our hearts are tender and uh ready to receive the word uh that you so intended for Lord we thank you in the precious name of Jesus Christ this morning Amen Brother John amen thank you brother how me feel the presence of the Lord amen amen I I believe the Lord wants to do something in our hearts today and we come to the right place with a prepared heart we can have the expectation to see it accomplished amen I I do I do like one thing I like many things brother Ronan said but one thing he said I want to change I don't want to leave here the same amen and it has to be free more agent has to come through this desire when that desire is so strong whatever you desire When you pray you shall have it so as the word is coming forth let's worship the word amen and and receive it into our hearts that it may accomplish the intention that God had had sent and I believe that this is just not a regular service I think every service that you come come to is is very intimate between you and God Amen and it's an opportunity for the spiritual man to be drawn closer to God Amen so let's get behind the word we appreciate brother Aaron um God has blessed brother Aaron and his family with a beautiful

amen Lord to have gifts that come to their position and their place willing to serve living Sanctified lives qualifying them for office Lord just all these all these parts that come together for moments like this we're grateful for it and Lord as we have this chance to read your word we pray that you would make it alive To Us by Revelation amen as we're given opportunity to hear uh from scripture and hear from the message of the hour may you Quicken it to us Lord may it be instructive bless this church Lord we know that you've had your hand upon it you've been very gracious to them may you continue just to pour out your spirit upon them encourage them and increase their uh knowledge of Lord and also their discipline and adherence to the pure word of God lord we commit this service to you now just praying that you take control of it For Your Glory name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you it's good to be here in the house of the Lord today always happy to be here it's our uh kind of an anniversary weekend for me my first time I ever came up here was during this time uh 22 years ago so whenever we're here it's kind of an a week of anniversaries amen and we're just really happy that we could keep coming back we bring greetings to you from always believe Christ I think our church just got renamed got renamed today we bring your greetings from Arizona Believers Church in Phoenix and uh God's really been gracious to the church there and we covet your prayers you know what it's like this church it was 22 years ago this church was started uh from scratch and so this church it's in your DNA it's in your history to labor for something that's new and so we covet your prayers as we Endeavor to serve the Lord and grow the work of the Lord there in Phoenix if you could take your Bibles turn to Isaiah chapter 9 I'll give you my title as you're turning there and you find your place just going to be reading verse six but the title is killing patients and if you were a doctor that'd kind of give you Shivers uh to hear it but it's patience as in The Virtue and just have a lot that I feel led to cover today and Trust it'll mean something to you as we go forward Isaiah chapter 9:6 it says For unto us is a child for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and I'm wanting to really focus on that Shall be Called wonderful amen God bless you you could be seated if you're having trouble with the spelling there it is on killing patients it's not the kind that a doctor would have but it's the kind that all of us should have as Christians if you just keep looking there at verse six there of this chapter we just read says For unto us a child is born and unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace when it says his name Shall be Called It means he will be so it's not just a title that's given to him but he is going to be and he will be wonderful I want to focus on on that phrase just here at the outset that means he'll be full of wonder he's going to be marvelous and when we take that word a Marvel if it's going to be marvelous a Marvel is a miracle it's uh something that causes astonishment so Christ is going to be wonderful he's going to be marvelous going to be full of wonder something that should Amaze you something that should shock you or be filled with wonder the word that's even used is Wonder struck he he shall be uh so awesome and so great and so marvelous and so wonderful and that it should cause astonishment and that it will actually cause you to be Wonder struck in judges chap 13: 18 says and the angel of the Lord said unto him it's manoah and about the birth of Samson it says why askest thus thou thus after my name seeing it is a secret and it doesn't just mean it wasn't known and nobody knew it but it meant secret means wonderful or incomprehensible or extraordinary uh you're you're seeking after my name that is just so so great and so awesome and so marvelous that what what is it going to do for you just to hear it sound there's so much more to it than just the the phonics and the and the the pronunciation of it and so this is Christ he shall be wonderful he is something that is extraordinary and I I'm saying all this just in the foundation it's the nature of Christ who he is it's the nature of Christ to be all inspiring in other words if you you catch a glimpse of Christ every time it ought to cause some awe and if it's something you've heard before then when you hear it again you remember the awe that you first had uh when you've heard it so the N it's the nature of Christ to inspire all and it is if I could put it this way this is at the real core of what's in my heart Christ can be a source of endless wonder that if he's marvelous if his name is secret incomprehensible and inexhaustible then it is the nature of Christ to be all inspiring and it is to be an endless source of Wonder now with that as one building block I want to introduce two two phrases or one term and a phrase and the first one is wonderlust and this will probably make more sense as we continue but anybody ever heard the uh the term wonderlust before it means a strong longing for or the impulse for wondering and it has kind of Taken on this Con ation now where people who love to travel uh they have a Wonder lust and they want to travel and the idea with Wonder lust though is not not so much getting to a particular destination but just it doesn't matter just enjoy the journey we're just on the road and so Wonder lust means kind of aimless and it at the heart of it there's no vision there's no goal there's no real purpose in doing what you're doing just want to get out on the road and just want to drive and and just kind of have this itch just to wander around and move and do stuff and in doing so not have any real goal in mind no place you really want to be it's just I just kind of feel anxious I just kind of I just want to wonder I just want to move along and wonder lust let me let me just say it this way it's not it's not a positive thing in the way that I'm wanting to look at it and then the other word I phrase I want to look at or just introduce is Wonder lost so you have Wonder lust which is this aimless pointless travel uh this uh wandering with no vision no purpose no goal and then you have Wonder lost and by that I mean to say that it's when we lose the sense of all or the excitement and amazement of Christ amen and I'm tying these things together now these aimless Pursuits or we call them Wonder lust cause a loss of Wonder for things that are real uh for things that are simple and things that are of God things that we have things that we presently possess and we just have an itch we just feel like we just need to be be moving we need to be going it's like what do you trying to accomplish what's your vision what's your goal what what fruit will this produce where will this get you a few years down the road oh it doesn't matter I I just feel uncomfortable I just feel like I need to move I need to I want to do something and it's that Wonder lust that causes the greatness of Christ to be diminished in our lives and I I want to uh emphasize this meaningless Pursuits have the impact of causing us to lose the Wonder of Christ amen and if that happens I would say that restoring the Wonder begins with recognizing the cause of Wonder lust that when someone when we when we engage in things that kind of captivate our attention in such a way to where those things seem to be more important in the the wonders of Christ than the way that we can restore The Wonder of Christ is find find the cause of our Wonder lust now that as a foundation I want to get to my subject of killing patience and we'll be able to kind of refer back to some of these uh PR principles as we go forward uh this is very practical if you were hoping that I would come and preach on the Seven Seals I'll say it's in there somewhere if you if you pay attention enough I really do I will say this I believe that any effective Ministry in in this end time is preaching from an open book and the opening of the word and we see that whether it be teachers or evangelist or pastors uh Apostles they're all they it to be in the the middle of the road now you got to be in the opening of the word and bringing it from the the open the things that have been open to us in this day but this is going to be very very practical and I want to take a journey through scripture uh and on patience and we're going to be arriving at a conclusion and if you could focus and stay with me I think it'll be worth it when we get there so I'm telling you up front that if it doesn't make any sense when we get to the end and if it doesn't mean anything to you then I'll just blame it on you amen I just say you didn't focus enough so I told you at the outset this is not Wonder lust we're not just wondering aimlessly through scripture but we we're focused and if you can focus with me we'll end up somewhere that I believe will be a blessing to you if we can stay focused I'm going to give you my outline at the outset so if you want to jot this down you'll know once we get to like this third part that we're nearing the the end and so I want to give you three three segments of what we're going to be ministering on this morning as an outline and the first part is patience leads to rewards we're talking about killing patience and and just developing this principle of patience patience leads to rewards and and there's uh the thought of creating motivation and the process of reinforcement that exist in the word of God and that happens to us personally and even natural Endeavors we realize that patience leads to rewards the rewards create motivation and there's this process of reinforcement the second part then is once we've established that I want to identify how that patience is an essential attribute of God it's a characteristic of God and therefore it is an essential attribute of his children and those who are a Believer by birth this patience is an essential attribute and then to tie it all together even our intro there I want to say that killing patience or the death of patience has resulted in Wonder lust and wonder loss it's the death of patience that has caused us to lose the Wonder of Christ and if I could say this uh kind of as my thesis statement that I'll be tracking over the next few moments here is that as in in general and I'm not trying to call anybody out in particular uh that I would kind of get your Gander up a little bit by feeling like I'm pointing at you but in general we're increasingly impatient it's the nature of just how Society has evolved and technology has evolved and opportunities present themselves uh we're increasingly impatient when it comes to do a number of things when we go if I could just use as an example if some of you go out to eat this afternoon you may call ahead to the restaurant or you may come in and they say that'll be a 30 minute wait and what are we going to do I forget about it right I'm not waiting 30 minutes to eat because we've been conditioned to not have to wait and and and we're more or less becoming impatient and in other things we're very uh we're Restless to experience a thrill uh anymore we're just not satisfied sitting down doing nothing and if and some of you maybe you could try it just go sit down on a swing and do nothing and see how long you could sit there and do it without itching to reach for something uh and and check something and find out you know who's winning and and what the stocks are doing and whether or not someone has messaged you or do something and so we have a Wonder lust where we're we're never quite happy just being bored uh We're Never Satisfied doing nothing there's got to be something else uh happening in order to keep us active or to keep us engaged even to the point now where this idea of multitasking which I think they've scientifically proved you can't truly multitask but we can't wash the dishes without listening to something in our ears right can I get some amens from my kids amen uh wa can't we can't work without music playing in the background there there's always got to be something else happening and we're trying to all all these multitasking it's just these it's the way our minds have been conditioned to where it can't just be one thing that we're focused on there's got to be all this noise that goes along with it if I could Define what it means to be impatient at the beginning maybe it'll help us to invert a little bit and know what we mean by patience but to be impatient means to be restless under existing conditions and to not be able to bear or endure your current state so when you're impatient you become Restless under uh what whatever you're facing at the moment I don't like this I I want to change it I I'm not happy I'm dissatisfied and there's a restlessness or not being able to bear or endure under your current state and that's what impatience uh means now the first part of this or if you're counting maybe this is the seventh part but of the three things I gave you in the outline patience leads to rewards and if I could say it this way summarize it this way rewards are earned through patience and uh being patient then is a process that inspires us and motivates us so if you have patience it leads to the reward and then we realize oh if I can be patient there's a payoff does that make sense don't don't worry about um encouraging me today um I it it'll help me now in Hebrews chapter 6: 10 11 and 12 we'll see this in the scripture says for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love amen which you have showed towards his name and that you have ministered to the Saints and do minister so the these have been these Hebrews had been working they had been laboring and Paul is saying God won't forget it amen and the kindness that you've showed the labor that you've given God won't forget it and he's saying this to encourage them to continue to labor to to not slack off to to continue to do what you're doing and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope un the end this is this is him saying those who are working continue to work and we would that all of you would work amen uh what happens often in many different groups or organizations there's uh you know 20% of the people do 80% of the work or sometimes it's 2% of the people do 90 100% of all the work and and Paul is saying maybe it's he's speaking to the 20% who do all the labor who do all the work and say hey you're doing great continue keep it up he goes and I would that all of you would show the same diligence as these others and he says to the full Assurance of Hope un the end so notice that Paul is not zeroing in on well you got the job done and you can accomplished the task you served on that Saturday and that was great that was wonderful he's saying there's the full Assurance of Hope in the end that what you have done and what you've labored to do God won't forget it because God is a rewarder and will give to you according to your labor amen so he says that you be not slothful I would hope that you would all show the same diligence and be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises that's right the language that Paul is using here shows that he he's promoting the the virtues of endurance he's promoting being steadfast and longsuffering stick with it continue and even if it get gets hard don't don't let up because uh there's a reward in this and show the same diligence to full Assurance of Hope in the end and uh don't be slothful and but look at the others who've been patient who've endured who've uh gone through things and they've inherited the blessing of the promise amen the word that's used even of longsuffering and patience is it's the combination of a to be long something that's a far off and and and long lasting and thumos which is uh to or passion or wrath so when it speaks of patience I think this is real real critical and I I apologize if I'm not as dynamic as your pastor when it comes to speaking uh but I hope you can hold your attention the the the to to this macros thumos this combination of these words it's it's a something long or far off and then wrath or passion so patience or to be longsuffering means you put passion off you put your wrath off it's the regulation of emotions to be patient means you're you're not quick to satisfy the desire for something amen uh you C you can stick with it and then Paul takes faith and patience and he says be followers of them who through faith and patience and herit the promise and so there's this marriage in this Union between faith and patience amen and it's a necessary Union for faith in order to be for it to be expressed and rewarded if you had Faith but no patience what happens your faith your faith uh is tried and your faith is buffeted and your faith things are coming against it without patience he's saying with faith and patience you inherit the promises so you have to have patience with your faith in order for your faith to ultimately be expressed and by that expression God rewards you for it amen in Revelations chapter 13:10 he that leadth into captivity shall go into captivity he that kth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the Saints so this patience and faith are combined together again and faith we can say is the if we want to put it maybe in a a simple way it's the capacity to believe it it's the it's the ability to trust and to the ability to have this full Assurance of something and not just intellectually accept something but it's the capacity to put your trust in in something Your Capacity to have confidence in something and patience would be the virtue to endure unto the possessing of it if I believe in something it means I I trust it I have confidence in it and then my patience kind of is upholding me to receive the very thing that I believe in brother Bram says now faithfulness and patience uh go together the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 10:36 brother Braham even says it another place he says have a real have real genuine Faith you have real genuine patience so when you have real genuine Faith you have real genuine patience these things are these things connect together in Hebrews 10:36 for you for you have need of patience that after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise yes there's that patience that you have need of patience that after you've done the will of God you endure you persevere there's something sustaining there's something that's preserving you that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise so you fa you have faith to believe now you have need of patience that when you by faith through the will of God you endure you persevere you withhold yourself from things that would distract you don't give in to the Wrath you you're you're able to regulate your emotions not quick to desire satisfy the desire for something and therefore you see that you receive the promise amen amen means you're not swerved from your deliberate purpose I have need of patience I have faith faith is settled on the word of God it sees something long range it knows it's there now I have need of patience so I'm not going to be swerved from this this intentional purpose I'm not going to uh become unloyal there's this loyalty to Faith despite circumstances in Hebrews 12 veres 1 2 and 3 it says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us right say it's it's the patience we need to reach the Finish Line he says looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds amen Paul as he writes this it's really hard to read over this and not want to stop and just go through a lot of the different elements in this because it's such a rich and very very deep verses especially as he comes to the end of what he's been writing to the Hebrews and he's given these clouds of witnesses and the law the types of the Tabernacle and Temple and worship that Christ is the Fulfillment he's the ultimate of the Jewish faith I said now that we have this this cloud of witnesses let us as lay aside every weight and run with patience and as we run with patience he says let's see an example of what it means to run and to run with patience because Christ endured this is this is the example of persevering and being longsuffering and and having a long range vision and the and the fortitude to stick with it who end endured the cross and endured contradictions against himself and Paul when he's writing this and I and I feel confident being able to say this taking in uh as we continue to read a few other places he's creating motivation he's wanting to establish expectations that this is not just you're going to things are going to get hard or things are going to be difficult and not everything's always going to be pleasing to your flesh but listen that it's worth it yes amen it may not feel like it in the moment but it's going to be worth it it's going to yield Peaceable fr it's going to yield virtues it's going to yield a great reward and so Paul is writing in such a way to say be patient there's a reward that comes am and in doing so create a motivation for people to stick with something that they believe in and hold fast to things that are real and things that are true and again this patience meaning to not be quick to satisfy urges or satisfy longings or desires that would be contrary to the goal or the motivation or the the thing that we're trying to accomplish amen so a way of uh telling the person you need to run a race and this race is going to be difficult and it's going to be long and it's going to be hard but he's establishing expectations that at the finish line or as you persevere and run with patience there's a joy there's something coming amen and he says unless you be wearied and faint in your mind this is the condition of not having patience and have patience and run the race with patience because if you don't have patience you're going to get weary you're going to faint in your minds you're going to you're going to lose your steadfastness in Romans chap 2: 6 and 7 he's speaking of God who is a rewarder he says God who will render to every man according to his deeds to them who by patient continuance remember the Paul writes in Romans that God is a rewarder them that diligently seek him that if you're persevering if you persist if you're patient that God rewards and as he has already said in Hebrews 6 God is Not unrighteous to forget your labor of love it's a this a characteristic of God to be a rewarder and he's saying that God will give to every man according to his labor according to his Works he says to them who by patient continuance in wello now I hope that phrase doesn't need to uh bring out the different translations in it means when you're steadfast and endure in doing good doing what you know is right and I believe that that's something that speaks of integrity and having characters when you know you're doing the right thing even if it's difficult even if in the moment it's not going to bring you immediate uh results and if you're faced with the situation where it says well you can you can do it the right way and get the job done the right way and produce long lasting results a and and get a better benefit in the end or you could cut corners and make more money and get the job done faster a and it's the cutting Corners people do that because they don't have the patience to do it right they don't have the steadfastness they don't have the Integrity to do it well and so the phrase to them who bu patient continuance and well-doing is a mouthful those who God will reward and give to those who by patiently continuing and doing good notice he says seek for Glory and Honor and immortality he'll give them eternal life so it's not wrong to seek for the rewards of God to them who by patient continuance and well-doing seek for Glory and Honor and immortality these are seeking for the right kind of Glory the right kind of honor the right kind of immortality it's not the carnal side and not the the the prideful side we say that we ought to in patient continuance seek for the rewards that God has promised to those who endure amen James chapter 1 verses 2 to 4 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience now that this is the trying of your faith gives patience a job if your faith is never tried patience never has a is unemployed right you may have faith but if it's never tested if it's never buffeted if it's never challenged the and the patience is just laying over there saying man I I'm I'm getting rusty I'm getting tired I'm trying to collect unemployment they don't pay it here and patience doesn't have a job so it says when you the trer Faith Works patience it gives patience something to do so if brother brandom says that when you have real genuine Faith you have real genuine patience then patience you have faith and then patience never activates until faith is tested and then patience is like yes this is my chance this is my opportunity the faithfulness and patience go together as brother R said so the TR of your faith worketh patience and he says but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing when we have faith and it's tested it gives patience a job this is my opportunity this is my part when you're really going through it this is when I can step up and this is what I can endure and I can lift up and I can uphold and then you patiently endure and and it says that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing there's your reward that when patience has her perfect work when you when you let it let it uh live and you let it Thrive and you let it do what it's supposed to it produces the positive results the gospel says it can bring Amen brother bam says there's absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of your faith that's right amen otherwise patience never steps up amen patience can't come to the plate it can't it can't rise up the only way that you can demonstrate or have patience is when you need it in the trial of your faith continues to write this in the same chapter the church age book in thot Tre and church age God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development this is a a very important Concept in the message of the hours brother Bram touches on on it in different places in his ministry this the maturing part the process of growing and maturing and you says you you become a son by birth but you're not born a man you to grow and develop into spiritual maturity so this is the process of character development how highly God has commended these Saints of the Dark Ages patient as Lambs led to the slaughter lovingly Faithfully they served God that is all they wanted out of life just service to their lord how great was to be their reward patience the scriptures tell us essential to Perfection faith and patience working together here is they had faith and they believed and they were patient under trial and all they wanted out of life was just to serve their lord and since that's what they wanted to do and that was their faith and they could endure and they could go through difficulties and they go through hard trials and brother B says great how great was to be their reward and he's taking that this idea of God's will for us is perfection using the example of they in the Dark Ages who like Lambs were led to the slaughter Faithfully serving God they what they wanted out of life was service to God he says there's a reward for that amen and God's will for us is perfection and Perfection is patience that you cannot be perfected we say well you can't be perfected without suffering we've heard that right perfect character simply never made without suffering maybe there's an unspoken ingredient there patience that if you suffer without patience it can't produce Perfection because a lot of us can say hey I've suffered a lot gone through a lot could anybody say that we've suffered and it hasn't always produced the character that it ought to you get more sour and critical you get you get more tough and H and obstinate or get a little bit more numb you say well the the hard trials I've gone through haven't really produce the character that it should say it was missing the ingredients of patience and that it it is missing and maybe I should back up maybe maybe we're going to have more points to this outline than we intended but if you pay if you have faith that suffering and that trial of your faith you have the if you have faith you have patience those are the necessary ingredients to turn suffering into character amen because there's a lot of people that go through suffering but they never it never produces character right so there's the quality of a born- again believer who through faith and patience it can produce the character of Christ that that that gold that character of Christ and and I know these are large principles and maybe I wouldn't even have the Liberty to preach them in a lot of places except here I know you're Faithfully taught and and you understand a lot of these things that we could just pull from things you've already been taught and put it into a picture that's hopefully helpful for you now if patience is critical to character development critical to perfect Faith critical to Perfection then it begs the question if suffering is to produce perfect character if patience produces uh maturing in perfect Faith or Perfection then we can say then what is it that hinders our maturing what is it that would hinder our ability to grow and and I'm kind of giving you a little bit of a peak where we're headed with this in the closing just think about how it Modern Life Is by Design is manipulating our Humanity by design it knows how we think it knows what we respond to and it knows that if you present certain things visually that it'll get your attention it knows that if it uses uh certain things in a certain way at a certain time that it can cap capure your attention and there's a way that things have been designed and constructed and it's all really at the core economics and capitalism and the bottom line of the dollar or people are motivated to use the way that you're wired to line their pockets with cash I'm just using it in very simple terms and think about just maybe don't get lost in the thought but just for a moment think about how that the things of life and and the Technologies and entertainments and things that we interact with and the things that we use how that it's perverting patience and let me just inject this the original sin was the result of impatience that's right brother BR said Adam's bride could not wait she was enticed into impatience that even if you go back and look at the conversation there was something to cause the woman to think well I'm no longer happy in my current state because this this serpent is telling me that God knows the day that you eat you'll become as Gods knowing good from evil and she realized wait a minute there's something withheld from me there's something more there's something else I could be doing there's something else out there for me and she became impatient brother brah said God promised to multiply them but they had to wait until God's time I know this is maybe serving my sermon a little bit but it was the seeds of wonderlust like are you sure you've experienced everything you can and you know there's more out there and God knows that you'll become as Gods knowing good from Evil and there's there's this other this journey you could take and things that you can experience and so the original sin involved impatience it involved enticing the woman out of a state of contentment with the things that God had given and brother brah says it in more than just a couple places it was an oncoming promise it was Adam's bride could not wait she could not wait until God's time so that means that God made a promise it'll get there eventually just with patience wait for it amen endure to the time of fulfillment and then Satan comes and says no you need to do this you need to do that no you want to have it way you want to have it that way and getting the whole thing out of cater if I could say this uh in in a way maybe just as it Wells up within my heart the role of patience I believe is uh the role of patience imperfection is just too easily misunderstood and if I could say it this way there's this Catholic ideology o of suffering where you're to actually physically harm yourself and there's this deprivation of certain things and there's a uh uh they looked at suffering in the sense of uh of it's kind of manufactured and it's uh you know archaic tortures maybe the way we would think of it now but there's a daily suffering and there's a daily uh activation of patience that we all must have there's a way that we suffer and it's not uh people knocking on your door to come in and handcuff you if you if you name the name of Christ it's not depriving yourself of certain things so that you that you you suffer from uh your self-imposed uh pentanes that not the suffering so I think the role of patience imperfection is often conflated with you know Catholic ideas or theology about suffering and we shouldn't do that now I hope that there's been enough there just kind of seated in there to see that patience if you endure that there's a benefit there's a there's a reward that comes now patience is and this is that next step step in this patience is an intrinsic characteristic of God it's an essential attribute for The Believer by birth and this is not something that you're necessarily going to have uh innate by human uh human birth but this is something that we we always want to encourage us not just to become better humans but to be born again to become better Christians amen because there's a lot of principles of scripture that I believe that we could teach and if everyone would adopt them even without a birth we'd be in a much better Society if everybody could abide by it but uh because there's a lot of principles of living and life and wisdom and the scripture but we're goal our goal is not just to reform but to be transformed and and so there's this uh patience is an attribute of God and it's also an attribute of a born- again believer Amen in second Peter chapter 3:9 it says the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but as longsuffering to usw not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance in other words God is patient yes God is not Dull or inactive even if if it seems like he's not working there's a hand that he works on that we can't see there's a way that he moves that we don't always know and so God is patient he's not inactive he's not listless or lazy a and God uh God is able uh to God is not slow to get what's happening amen God's not slow to appreciate what is going on because this is way God is Not slack like some men consider slackness concerning his promise that things are happening like God do you not see what's happening over here there's a there's a flood or there's a fire there's sickness there's trouble my family's falling apart God do you not see what's going God is not slow to know what the real need is God is not slow to appreciate what is happening amen uh there's a kind of a phrase that it says if you maintain your cool and you keep your head while everybody else is losing theirs then you obviously don't understand the situation right because that's what the world the conclusion of the world comes to it's like man everything's going crazy there's so much chaos there's pandemics there's economic Doom we could have either depending on which side you're on both sides are fretting two terms of Biden or another term of trump and everybody's in full Panic right and then if you're over there just kind of keeping your cool saying I vote I I know where my election lies and and you're steadfast and you're constant you're keeping your eyes on the word of God people say well you just obviously don't understand the situation oh I had a friend in college one time tell me says man you never sweat what's like you you never get ruffled you're not worried and I was like this is a it was a perfect opportunity to testify so I found an absolute amen found something sure Hallelujah i i i my life is not hinged on what college I get into it's not depending on what kind of grades I get at the end of the day if I get the best grades ever in the history of ever and it's not God's will for me to have a seven figure paying job guess what I'm not going to get it God's will is the controlling Factor so God is not slow to recognize what happen happen but his wisdom is in his patience God's not slack concerning his promises as some men count slackness but his longsuffering to us we not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance God's wisdom lies in the fact that he's not always quick to act in Exodus 34:6 and the Lord passed by before him proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness and Truth these are attributes of God and he is gracious in longsuffering characteristic of God to be longsuffering second Peter 3:15 and count that the longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation amen his longsuffering is salvation longsuffering is the product of his wisdom and his knowing all things it's a this is an attribute of God that is I'm so glad that he has it amen I I I remember and I kind of I cringe just thinking about it but I remember the first time I ever preached a sermon I said I made a comment to the effect and I'm sure there's a tape out there somewhere uh where it says you better be glad I'm not your God or you'd be dead and burning in Hell before you had a chance at Salvation I can still remember it you know as if I said it yesterday because I I I I'm ashamed to have said it but in and but there's a truth to it right yeah if we were God and not trying to take a I'm not trying I don't want you to spin say well brother Bram did say that we are him and we're amateur Gods I saying if we were the self-existing Eternal one as we are now in our carnal thinking it would we would always be alone right God exists Alone by himself if we were the impatient Petty people that we are at times we would just we would people who had a chance at Salvation we would have written them off and where would some of us be in this room today if having been given a chance at the message of the yah given a chance at truth and given an opportunity to do it right and once we had that one chance in our if I was your God right and my my self-righteousness I'd forget about about them you know they had their chance usually if there's election there they get it that quick and just write them off that's true but this is a the the longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation Hallelujah and I think we could all say Amen to that notice this in 1 Corinthians chapter 13 I don't don't know if I even had the scriptures here apologize if my slideshow has been a distraction we didn't I didn't have time to uh make sure it was conducive to your setup here but the Bible says charity and 1 Corinthians 13:4 charity suffereth long amen that's the that's the intro charity suffereth long and then verse seven endureth all things the book ends the boundaries for perfect love is patience patience is the beginning and the end of love it it's what frames it you want to know love love is framed by patience you want to know what love is if God this is an essential attribute of God that he's longsuffering of Our Lord he's longsuffering to us where God is merciful gracious and longsuffering charity suffers long charity endureth all things this forms the boundaries of Charity's character this is perfect love God who is love is framed by this attribute patience charity suffereth long and endureth all things you'll find that that word is patience so patience is essential are you staying with me so far amen you about wisdom I didn't even bother to look at the clock when I got up here so now I can just claim ignorance if I if I preach until there's no weights at the restaurant but patience is essential and the importance of patience if you'll just humor me for a moment the importance of patience is highlighted by its continual emphasis it's continually emphasized I don't know how many scriptures I've read already this morning that have talked about longsuffering and enduring and patience and patience and patient continuous and over and over again we find this theme keeps coming up and I I want to read a few more scriptures just to see that by its continual emphasis it's telling us this is important amen the purpose of suffering and patience is to bring us to Perfection to full maturity full reward so we know it's important yeah and I know maybe say God give me patience but is there a way that I can have it without temp suffering there a way that I could have it without really going through it and Lord just give me patience if I need patience to have perfect character just give me the patience but I don't know if I don't know if I need a test right I think it's brother Donnie Reagan I heard say it the first time a lot of us want a test uh we want a testimony but we don't want to test because he says test iony right that's what happens we start tooning and groaning and complaining whenever we're test but if you want a testimony it's got to be testimony in James chapter 5: 7 and 8 be patient therefore Brethren under the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the Earth immediately he's going into what it means to be patient the husband waited for wait for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early in latter rain amen this image of one who the husband one who labors and toils he prepares the ground he plants the seed he nurtures it while it's in the soil he's looking out after it and then he's looking to the Harvest he knows one day I'm going to get the fruit of this and he has long patience for it until he receives it but ye also be ye also patient in this like figure be ye also patient establish your hearts amen for the coming of the Lord draweth n and some great instruction Grudge not one against another Brethren lest you be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door amen take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering Affliction and of patience now does it seem odd that in the middle of talking about a husbandman and one laboring and being patient to the coming of the Lord that he says you know don't grudge against one another but what is patience the regulation of passions the ability to control your emotions the ability to if I can say deprive yourself of the satisfaction of a recompense a retribution a responding in kind isn't it I it's so easy I just uh feeling free today but it's so easy anymore to be able to respond in kind because you a lot of the lot of the uh narcissism we experience or the the pettiness or the cattiness comes by way of text messages or or digital communication right so we can hide behind the distance to just give it right back and Paul is saying be you patient establish your hearts don't grudge against one another and he says look at those who are an example of suffer in Affliction and of patience don't build up grudges don't don't be uh uh don't allow your emotions to get the better of you and he says behold we count them happy which endure where's the source of our happiness where's the source of our contentment not in the easy grabs and getting everything that we can but enduring we count them happy which endured you have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord if you're not reading it you might think I didn't know job was a doctor but youen you've heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender Mercy just I hope you're recognizing just as we read these scriptures uh that there's this connection between suffering patience and reward enduring and affliction and hardship and toil that there's this relationship that exists with suffering patience and reward amen so much of what we have today is intended in in a technological sense and an evolutionary sense in terms of amenities and Comforts are all to decrease our suffering to make life more comfortable to constantly stay entertained and to not for God forbid be bored he say establish your heart strengthen and fix your hearts amen render it constant this is patience be patient establish your hearts make your a patient Heart Makes firm makes stable makes constant and steadfast amen so if I could kind of I want to turn a little bit of a corner here patience is a god-given ability to endure to the payoff right that's what patience is it's the power to stick to something to not vary to know that what you're doing is in the word of God to know that what you're doing is right we're not talking about uh beating your head against the wall to get rid of a headache we're talking about doing what you know is right there's a payoff there's a reward and and and patience is a god-given ability to endure to the payoff I'm going a I'm the power to stick to something and a a and not vary from it because I know that God's going to reward me amen Luke 8:15 but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience yes the fruit doesn't come overnight it's a process that takes time the Nature has to be in the seed and the nurture has to be present in its environment to take that which is little and small and then reproduce the very image that it was in in the beginning it takes time to do that they that in the good ground have an honor and good heart but then they keep that word and bring forth fruit but they don't bring it without patience in 2 Timothy 2 verse 9 wherein I suffer trouble as an evildoer e even unto bonds but the word of God is not bound therefore I Endure all things for the elect sake that they may also obtain the Salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory I'm patient and I Endure that others might also obtain that's right it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him for if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he will also deny us to Reign it means to possess Supreme honor uh it means to possess Supreme Liberty and blessedness amen he saying we will not Reign and possess this Glory this honor and immortality which he said we ought to in well-doing seek for glory honor and immortality that we ought to be seeking for us that when we suffer we we we're conscious of the fact there's a reward for this yes and it's not we plunge it's not that we plunge headlong into suffering for the sake that we could be perfected but we realize that it's going to come it's going to come in its time and then when we patiently endure if we suffer we shall reign if we suffer we will possess Supreme honor Liberty and blessedness and the suffering here is simply being patient I can endure all things if we suffer it's just waiting on God and waiting for god brother Braham said and we all have daily opportunities to do that amen it's not that we have to wait for the World Council churches to come kick down these doors and Usher us out and confiscate our King James Bibles and put bars on the door there's daily opportunities for this kind of enduring amen daily opportunities to demonstrate patience we don't have to be living under a Communist Regime we don't have to have eight years of Biden to be suffering we have daily opportunities to endure to wait on God and to wait for God God has ordained that things of value come at a great price power without character satanic and honor in this gain that the scripture speaks of without suffering without enduring or without patience is dangerous yes because of our Humanity if God just gave us certain things now we even think about faith operates according to a law that you do right now as a born again believer have power to go create another world and live on it and God then has given us the power but there's a secret to use in it and if we do not have the right kind of character to operate power brother B says it's satanic amen so we need patience it's and and the danger doesn't lie in Lucifer himself it lies in our Humanity we need patience we need perseverance we need to be persistent and it's a part of God's process for us as his children if I could say this it's part of experiencing his Wonder if God gave us all power and God always just went before us and took care of everything would we really know him all this is an aside and and I'm sure that you've heard this ministered before but had Adam and the woman always remained in the garden they really had never known who God was other than an an architect of a beautiful Earth how would have they ever known any more about God other than the fact that he was a Creator and today that's really a lot of ways that all people only worship him in that he is a Creator and that he created all things and they worship the creation because they believe that the creation by Design speaks of the Creator and they're making the connection to the one true God but their knowledge of God's character and his nature doesn't go any further than the fact that they just believe that he created all things that's true amen so part of experienceing his Wonder Part of knowing him to a greater degree and knowing his nature and character is suffering Hallelujah part of really knowing him is not just suffering but suffering with patience amen Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 4:16 17 and 18 for which cause we faint not but though the out our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal way to Glory I I I don't know if you catch what he's saying here but he's saying that though I'm depriving my desires and depriving myself of things that I might enjoy In the Flesh I'm being strengthened deep inside amen and this patience that I'm exhibiting and caus which is causing this light Affliction it's just for a moment but it works deep within me a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory why we look not at the things which are seen but the the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal if I could put it in these words maybe it'll make help us to think of in more modern parlament there's that word again parlament isn't even a modern word but we're going to use modern terminology delayed gratification this is exactly what Paul is talking about he's talkinging about the act of resisting an Impulse a to to take something that's immediately available that I'm going to resist the desire to take an immediately available reward in the hope of obtaining a more valuable reward in the future amen I have the opportunity at $10 right now easily grasp I can grab it now or I can wait and get $100 later and Paul is saying I deprived myself now and I may suffer now I may go without the 10 now and I'm just trying to use a language you could understand or example maybe some of the even the younger ones could understand that there's an opportunity available before you maybe for the kids understand you walk into the kitchen and and there's a dessert that's been prepared for dinner that night a and you just want to sneak a little bite sneak a little little bit of a cookie because you're hungry and and and to use 2 Corinthians 4 Paul is saying I deprived myself of the cookie at noon so that I could have four cookies after dinner amen that though I suffered a little bit in the moment of Temptation and I deprived myself I realize it's working for me a far more exceeding great and eternal reward I'm not looking at at the things that are seen but I'm looking at the things that are not seen these things that are seen are temporal but there things which are not seen are Eternal and it's Paul who draws on this in Hebrews 11 where Moses patiently endured by refusing the things that were present that would cause him pleasure for future gain that's what the Bible says he he saw him he endured he suffered the the the afflictions of that present time uh for the honor and Glory of Christ amen Moses endured refusing immediate enjoyment for the benefit of a more eternal enjoyment amen it's even Christ who patiently endured as we read that in the beginning he endured for the reward the future reward Moses practiced delayed gratification Christ is showing us an example of delayed gratification Paul is saying that we though our outward men may really want it that by by refusing to try to satisfy ourselves by resisting temptation of immediate pleasure in the hopes of a future lasting reward W it builds character I said earlier that patience involves the regulation of emotions means you're not quick to indulge in something and this is uh maybe a large thought if we're if we're ministering Wednesday night maybe there's more that we could say in this vein because there's a lot here and I want to try to keep going further this is an important principle the ability to delay gratification the ability to say no to the flesh the ability to say no to your desires this the ability to delay gratification is essential essential to self-control and I want to show you a few scriptures here if you look at Eccles Ecclesiastes chapter 3 God created us to experience rewards after effort like this is God's this is God's plan this is how God wanted it he he ordained it and this is the way it is that we would this is the way we could see it in the scripture this is is the way this is how God knows we are if I could put it that way even that we ought to experience a reward after effort after discipline after striving after applying ourselves after giving that when I when I sacrifice when I give when I pay when there's something exacted from me when I've striven for it the the real reward comes when I've given when I've paid in Ecclesiastes 3:22 remember this is God God knows this is our nature wherefore I perceive this is Solomon's observance that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works for that is his portion for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him he says it in uh earlier that it's good that a man should make his soul enjoy good in his labor this is this is God's recognition and even God's design for Humanity labor comes before rewards amen said it in Genesis 3:19 in the sweat of thy brow Thou shalt eat bread this is what God's saying I know your nature I know how you're going to be I know your design and your design that it's in the sweat of your brow and even in in him bringing this curse upon the Earth says you're going to labor you're going to fight you're going to struggle with the Earth but it's going to produce fruit and that's going to be precious to you you're going to enjoy that when you've planted a crop and you've labored with it and you've worked and you figured out a way to bring forth wheat you figured out a way to U turn that wheed into bread you're going to feel satisfied in what you've done this is God's understanding that labor effort and exerting yourself precedes rewards and even God's incentive God's reward comes after Labor comes at the end and this provides that necessary development of our character provides the proper motivation none of your parents give your kid a lollipop and say here go clean your room right maybe we haven't tried it maybe we should but we don't give the reward at upfront because what you're going to find 15 minutes later did you clean your room no what are you going to give me if I clean my room well the lollipop was to clean your room oh should have thought of that before he gave it to me right you've up the ante now and God gives us the reward we find that the rewards come at the end even ultimately the payoff comes at the end and God understands this is necessary to develop character this is necessary to give the right kind of motivation amen Ecclesiastes 78 better is the end of a thing the beginning thereof and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit if you take anything away today better to be be patient than arrogant amen and we can even see that God unfolds this truth in creation God had the power to do what create it all like that yes he did but he was a process where God began and it was very layered and it was very meticulous God God it took him six days to create everything right why did it take him so long if he's God God because it's showing that God is the god of patience he's meticulous amen even even demonstrating a day of rest showing that this is something that I could have done just in a moment but I I I I I he unfolds this truth in creation and then he unfolds it even in nature we have the law of conception and gestation and labor and each one has its role and has its part and you have you don't just have uh flowers that appear in Spring but you can go back to a time that the seed found its way in the Earth and even over a process of rotting through the winter and in some seeds even the cold the cold climate is necessary to trigger that germination so that when the it starts warming up it's going to start coming back up again God demonstrates this in nature he demonstrates it in his Char his character in other words the process is just as important as the product patience is a necessary part of perfection now here comes uh this comes here comes the Turning of the corner you're think how many turns do you have well I should have thought of that before I started using the corner analogy if things come too easily I hope you're still with me I amen bless the lord it's it's after 11:30 does that help anybody if things come too easily it short circuits God's process because of the way that he's made us the way that he knows that we're made the way that he knew that we would exist and the word speak through this Human Condition if things come too easily God has a design God has created us to experience rewards after Labor then if things come too easily and we get a reward without the proper labor that rewies us it short circuits our wiring it changes the way we think and changes our nature Bible says in Proverbs 20: 21 an inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning but the end thereof shall not be blessed if an inheritance comes too easy right if we just hand hand it to somebody well you didn't work for this you don't have the character for it you don't have the means really to figure this out and how to use it an inheritance may be gotten quickly wealth may be gained quickly you might find a way to get rich quick but if you didn't work for it are you really going to Value it if you didn't labor for it if you could find out a way to go and soone says hey I can you can make $10,000 in 10 minutes just follow me now I'm pretty sure that all of us would say maybe first how far are we going right who who's driving can I keep my phone on can I can I turn on find my FindMe app we we we might just kind of can I call the police first now we we'd be willing probably to entertain it but you realize if you were able to make 10 grand in 10 minutes you've probably warped your perception of what 10 grand means the value of 10 grand and you probably play real fast and loose thinking I can always make another 10 grand 10 minutes an inheritance may be gained quickly but the end is not blessed if it comes too easily without hard work it's wasted and even if you manage to maintain it and keep it and bury it in the earth and never use it it's been wasted because you didn't have the character to use it it's saying that quick wealth in the end is not a blessing right amen Proverbs 28 verse 20 and then 22 a faithful man shall be abound with blessing a faithful man shall bound with blessing but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent and then it says he that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye and consider not that poverty shall come upon him a faithful man one that wants to do things right versus one who wants to get rich quick now this hasn't turned into a financial seminar but it's the principle of rewards right gaining having that trying to get rich without patient and testing and trial without suffering is evil the Bible saying it leads to Poverty it's evil to have a lot of power it's evil to have a lot of assets it's evil to have accumulated a lot of wealth and not have the character and and and God ordains the pressure he ordains the resistance and the suffering he de he ordains the delayed gratification for a purpose in Romans 5 and not only so but we glory in Tribulation also knowing that tribulation worketh patience impatience experience and experience hope hope knows how these work together that if I have faith then the tribulation gives patience a job to do and then patience produces experience and having experience things it produces hope and then hope makes me not ashamed I won't be disappointed by the the one who got rich quick I won't be like the one who hastens to be rich who has an evil eye and doesn't realize if you don't have the character integrity if this hasn't come the proper way God knows this isn't good in the end and hope makes not a shame shame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us tribulation there is oppression pressure or distress and the word their experience is proven character tribulation worketh patience patience experience tribulation that's pressure oppression distress and that experience produces hope of the patience produces experience that Pro tribulation patience experience proven character God uses a combination of pressure can I get a witness amen he uses a combination of pressure stress and rewards to motivate Behavior yeah this is this is the way that God works now I may be using a language that some of you begin to recognize this is what this is what people have recognized is this rhythm of pressure reward tension release tension release we see it in the scripture that tribulation Works patience patience experience experience hope that God uses pressure in testing and these intermittent rewards and reinforcements to us to recognize his presence is with us the blessings are ours and it motivates our Behavior it gives us Pro it gives us proven experience h a proven character and it gives us hope amen he says in Romans 8 if we hope for that which we see not then do we with patience wait for it if we don't we we haven't gotten the reward if we haven't gotten what we wanted then we use patience amen then we can partaking the good that we've endured patiently for and partaking in that good and receiving that good that we've endured for that we've waited patiently for is for us a glorious Delight amen is I I don't know if the phrase is doesn't the food always taste better when you've cooked it right maybe it's maybe it's cognitive dissonance right I worked hard for this this is good but there's something that when you when you work for it when you achieve it when you do it that that's much more rewarding than when rewardful much more of a reward you appreciate the reward more right now I'm getting close to closing so you need patience right you endure like a sermon within a sermon you make it through and it ends and you're like oh yes he called the musicians up and you're just like it was worth it if I could say this when we talk about patience there might be a lot of thought I want to be patient I be patience but patience is not only a conscious act but it's part of an unconscious brain process where I'm going to persevere I'm going to commit and so there's this Consciousness I'm suffering I'm going to stick with it I'm suffering I'm going to stick with it but there's also this it's an there's an unconscious brain process that takes place and there's a great spiritual type here and and now we're just going to step in this you could get homeschool credit for this the human brain has a circuit that runs through the prefrontal cortex and the ventral stratum in the in the the in the brain there's a c there's a wire that runs through it it's a neural neural network and it monitors your your reward center in your brain so there's a wire that runs through a part of your brain and it's monitoring it's a a network that monitors activity and it works like a switch and so there's a there's a lot here but I just want to put this in here because this is a transition I think it's going to make a lot of sense to you so as we as our brain is wired and there's this trigger in there and and when things happen you're experiencing certain things this neural network is waiting for the the reward right it's waiting for this there's a switch in there waiting and if there's no immediate re immediate reward it prompts the brain Hold Steady keep waiting stick it out there's a reward coming and so there's this important trigger that we're supposed to have in our minds that tells us to be patient and the reward comes when it comes it comes in the form of dopamine and that's the chem this is just a chemical process that's behind all these different scriptures I've even been reading to you that there's this chemical release in the brain and it's a chemical reward for Success when you've achieved something when you've accomplished something when you've been rewarded there's actually a chemical reaction in your brain this is the way that we're physically rewire wired and it says and you feel this sense of ah this is good it's a dopamine release so there's these complimentary systems that work within our body there's this adrenaline a the stress that produces adrenaline and then the rewards that produces dopamine and that's what causes that that wonder that excitement that's why that's why some songs you really really enjoy it builds tension and just even the progression of chords it relieves itself and it resolves the tension and you really like that and and a and a good book and even a well-written movie it all works with building tension and the resolution of tension and the reason why these things are successful is because that's just the way that our bodies work is there's tension and then that release that dopamine release so there's this adrenaline and this dopamine and it creates this excitement this thrill now the the amazing thing is is the right balance is so important I know this is dissolved into a biological devolved into something else but the balance is so necessary that if the process of stress and reward is how our body that produces dopamine and we s we have a sense of satisfaction is is it making sense you know that I think you know what dopamine is maybe most of you and we can this is some fod for family devotions later if kids have a lot of questions about dope but there's this this uh response in our minds to these things and this is a chemical reaction creates a sense of satisfaction or wonder or excitement but to produce that in our human bodies the balance is necessary that there must be patience you have to have the stress amen and the perseverance Amen in order for the the to to truly have a rewarded experience you really should think on that in terms of this is the way we're made this is the way that the Bible knows that we're made impatience is not only Built through that uh intermittent reinforcement delayed Gra ification delayed gratification then God blesses us God rewards us that's the only way that you build fa patience that if you have if your brain is if your brain is waiting going through something and it's waiting for a reward and it and it's building tension waiting building tension waiting and then you get the reward and there's your release and you feel good you feel happy that's the wonder that you have to have patience you have to have patience because patience well if I can say this if you take away the patience and there's no delayed gratification you never build patience because patience is only Built through the is only working when you're enduring you can't build patience through constant stimulation you wonder why God doesn't always keep us on the Mountaintop right why don't we always feel his presence why isn't he always just lavish lavishing us with with Bountiful blessings uh of financial offering and new cars and perfect health why is there sometimes just the smallest little thing that gets to us because if we get rewarded too often if we don't if there's no stress if there's no pressure If we get rewarded too often or too frequently then we quit when there's no reward now killing patience can I can I preach my sermon today amen my title is killing patience killing patience has caused the Wonder lust that that that constantly seeking for a thrill yes seeking for something to satisfy it's caused the Wonder lust and the Wonder to be lost because the world has reverse engineered the process that God designed for us for a purpose God knows the way that we're wired mechanically chemically he knows our design and so God deals with us in a way to produce character to prod prod Integrity God has a way of dealing with us in our Human Condition to make himself known like our our our faith our faith though it may be there is a mystery to our faith it becomes very practical in our lives and and it has place in every single aspect of our life because God knows our human condition and has framed his word in such a way to meet our needs in our human existence and and so the word is made to understand ourselves the word is made to understand the life that we're living in the word the word is made so that God can be manifested in this earth and the world has looked at the way that we're made and it's reverse engineered this process that God designed for his purpose and now we can feel success and reward without any suffering we can experience the emotions of accomplishing something and experience the emotions of achieving something without any real development without any real effort and now this is this is where it's this is if you've endured to this point this is where the payoff comes many of the things that we interact with on a daily basis manipulate our minds and we they call them information and communication Technologies from laptops to cell phones to tablets to all sorts of devices that uh whether they be smart whether they be connected The Internet of Things whatever it might be they've carried with it do you realize now you can't even grocery shop without providing a rewards number right and after you've spent all your money they want you to get all excited about the fact that you you earned 320 points right never mind you're paying $8 for a pound of bacon right and twice that much for you know eggs unless you live on the Martin Manor you get them for free you got to pay what where's the where's the overhead in the scraps have we calculated just how much the scraps are costing us so we can calculate whether or not we're saving money on the eggs and all the electricity for the the heat lamps we we need to drill down on whether or not we're saving money on these eggs now that I think about but all these systems we have that require that uh engage us and and everything if I can say everything's been gamified now from getting gas to checking in at restaurants there's all there there's this process of lights and flashing and blinking and chainging and rewards because these systems want to give us this magical effect of overcoming this magical fact of you saved a hundred bucks today no you spent a th to save a 100 right and they want you to feel like that's right I did you know what I'm not done shopping why cuz you want to save a hundred bucks and you and you're not realizing the whole time the money's just going like that all these systems are being used to create this this feeling of winning overcoming accomplishing something but they're doing it by bypassing patience I built all that up on the patient side so you could realize so you could be thinking more deeply when we talk about these things the games the programs the social media interactions all these things they can scientifically prove that gaming uh uh things that we enjoy on internet a lot of the whether it be consumption of media and and programming and then even especially social media interactions whether it be texting or or Whatsapp or messenger they increase our dopamine and adrenaline in our brains it increases it when you get a ping there's this dopamine there's when you when you when you when people follow you when you get a response or a comment on a post come on somebody don't all be shy that's true I know you're all influencers you you know how it feels right how many people are following you and who how many people like that photo and whether or not they're checking your WhatsApp status there's a dopamine uh release and that's why you want to revisit it again and now let me just use this phrase this is the conclusion from a scientific perspective it says your brain chemistry is just being fooled into thinking you're accomplishing something your brain chemistry is being tricked you get the sense and the feeling of a reward but you've got it without paying the price you've got it without enduring therefore you don't you haven't built patience you haven't experienced the a concept of waiting for it and you get you tricked your brain into thinking you've got it so now if we go back and think when that happens the next time the reward doesn't come fast enough you're not going to wait for it not scroll I need something else come on I need something to make me happy right right and all the while patience is dying right patience is dying the world is eroding our patience that's why I called it killing patience and with the death of impatience impatience is born when you kill patience impatience is born and that's why our attention spans are shrinking our capacity to focus is getting smaller we our ability to endure our ability to press you may you may notice it in your children maybe you could even notice it in yourself that they won't stick with something long if it doesn't get get their attention and engage them and make them happy right away there's this constant seeking of a high or a stimulation and it's all been fabricated and created within our thought process of that we're pursuing a reward a a sensation and feeling we're pursuing the dopamine release this is literally what is happening when we grab our phones when we play video games when we engage in these information and communication Technologies we want to get this dopamine release and we're pursuing it but it's all empty amen the levels you achieve in Kingdom Rush the crates that you're able to open in zuba did I get it right kids they they oh wow what did I get and who do I you know all these things create even in buying uh collecting cards you collect cards and you rip open the pack do I have a Hol foil one do I do I did I get a special insert it creates this right is really what have you done what have you accomplished and it's all vanity amen and once you get in that cycle this dopamine gets you chasing and then you get rewarded for chasing which makes you chase more but then you realize these things are fabricated yes so they've timed it that you're going to get rewarded there's there's one in so many packs so it's going to come up so the more you play it you're eventually going to get it as you play these games like I beat this level they wanted you to beat it cuz they want you to get to the next level and pay money so you can unlock that weapon to get to the next one and then it just becomes an addiction becomes absentminded amen and then it becomes increasingly difficult to stop or control why because it's become an addiction just like a lot of substance abuse the brain the body needs the chemical release so it ingests something to give that them that experience we start reaching for the games the internet the movies the videos you name it and it's all compul compulsion because of a dopamine cycle in our brains now the big question how is this relevant you know to send the light how is this relevant to a Christian service by killing patience our desire and motivation for Christ is dying our minds are being conditioned for cheap rewards our minds are being conditioned we're we're becoming addicted to the the entertainments and the the passing of this world and the even the fact that these uh video clips that are a big YouTube shorts and Tik Tok they're short you can digest them move on right to the next one it's capitalizing on that system in our minds of I I need the payoff I need the payoff I need the hook I need the reward and that's why it becomes such an addiction and when you're in that cycle and you realize that God is a god of patience and that you you you you know God a certain way and you have to feel him a certain way and you and you come to know know him through trials and testings and his word will unfold you to you through faith and patience then Christ becomes much less desirable to us amen because our minds are being conditioned it's like a drug addiction and we're applying ourselves to empty Pursuits instead of applying ourselves to the wonders of Christ amen in Philippians 2:5 and 6 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God not only does it speak to the ality of it and the the correctness and the righteousness of his equality with God but it also means something that was not easily grasped he thought it not robbery he didn't think it was just something he could easily acquire if he was going to be raised and sit at the right hand of the father if he had the hope of glory if he for the joy which was set before him he knew that the joy couldn't be easily grasped he knew the throne wasn't easily ascended to he knew that it had it couldn't just be acquired hastily as an inheritance he knew that it would take constant steadfastness suffering and perseverance and we're too easily choosing to enjoy the pleasures of this world the pleasures of our mind than to patiently endure and that even comes just to contemplation prayer meditation just flat out being bored and letting your mind just sit still for a while you don't have to be a Christian even to recognize the benefits of that Genesis 15:1 God comes to Abram and he says after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward that's after these things it it wasn't after he flipped the switch wasn't after he followed the right channel on Tik Tok that can give us the just the the right kind of spiritual Snippets to satisfy the itch for something religious but it was after these things after fighting to rescue his nephew lot after turning down The Spoils of Sodom it's after a battle and after turning down the The Spoils of it after turning down what the world offered him it was then that God showed up and said I'm your reward amen the Bible says after he had patiently endured Hebrews 6:15 after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise I believe as I try to draw this to the a close Christ just still our reward that's right there's still a Wonder of Christ that's available to us with all the lights and all the fancy of Leo deia and all the all the hooks that can get into our flesh and my if you're a if I could say if you're a baseball fan baseball's never been better if you're a college football fan right hell to the victors right it's just it's never been better there's there's just certain things you can say things are so good I and the data that's available to us if you if you if you like and investing the tools that you have at your disposal are endless and there's a lot that could be said about the world that can catch our attention let's spend some time together we find out whether you like to fish we find out whether like you H whether you like to hunt whether you like this or whether you like that there's an endless availability of information and entertainment in any Endeavor that you could constantly and endlessly consume because people are endlessly producing the content for you to consume and it it's some of it we could say is in itself is harmless that's why the Bible speaks of moderation but what's being missed in all this is as the world has gr gotten greater in its GL its glitter and its glow its uh flashiness that the the the real Christ and the things of Christ we've become hijacked our minds have become hijacked Christ is still amazing amen yes his name hasn't changed his name is still called wonderful he's still all inspiring he's still is one that can thrill our hearts but our minds are being hijacked and our brains are being hacked to seek after Cheap Thrills instead of knowing him amen so how is it we can restore our sense of wonder for Christ how is it I can shake myself from this lukewarmness how is it that I could kind of rekindle a waning love I I hope that this means something to all of us today and or least one person to realize that my fervency my my diligence the the things of God I mean I think that we could all brother Johnson you could remember when you had to hunt for a tape maybe a real toore player to listen to The Voice to hear Brother brandham there's a time that you had to borrow real to reals to hear new messages or somebody would travel through with the 20th century prophet and play the film and you were just in awe and there was a scarcity of the message of the hour there was a when there was fewer tapes and fewer availabilities there was a preciousness to it and we enjoyed it a lot more when we heard it but now we all can have access to it like that it went from wire reels to Real to Reel and it just kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller to where then it was put on a thumb drive now it's just disappeared it doesn't even have physical space anymore what happens it's it's not as wonderful as it used to be the love the passion for it the desire for it brother Bram asked the question or postulate I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word that's in our midst we can begin to restore The Wonder of Christ by identifying the influences that are numbing our sensitivity to God's greatness that's where we can start by being honest about the fact whether or not the word still Thrills us whether or not we're still excited about the things of God and Christ whether or not we find um there's a a joy that comes and reading the scripture whether or not there's a a pleasure that comes in listening to the message of the hour whether or not there's a there's an excitement about getting together for church and special meetings and ways that we could help one another there is there really uh is there still is is there is it there and if you get I think it's to menome I I I think it's not there like it used to be and I'm not excited and thrilled then step back and identify the things that are numbing your sensitivity to The Wonder of Christ maybe some of us are slaves to a dopam cycle maybe our brain is craving that chemical release whether it be with a new like or comment or achievement level you don't have to be a kid to be addicted to games every notification all these things and I'm I am I am kind of putting a bullseye on our cell phones our operating systems our tablets our entertainment systems because what it's done is is it's caused our attention span to shrink and as our attention span has shrunk our capacity for God has shrunk amen deep thought is more difficult and if deep thought is difficult deeper experiences are difficult amen and we've been reduced to Mindless Scrolls where there's no end to the scroll I think they even call it Doom scrolling there's no end I this is just my own personal testimony uh I it took a while for me to figure it out but I I had um some news apps and so You' want to every once in a while you you you'd open up a news app because you just want to find out what happened that day it was a day when you could read the newspaper right and you'd be finished and maybe you'd read the whole thing like well we'll wait till tomorrow for for another go at this and so in my mind kind of have I was raised in the newspaper generation and so there was uh you know you just kind of had this sense you got the news and you moved on and it's developed certainly over time for me but I would check open the app to check the news you want to scroll through and get the news it never stopped scrolling honestly it never stopped scrolling it never stopped updating it never stopped realizing H he's interested in this so as soon as you click on that there's another one that's going to follow right behind it when you go back and so there's this and it's it's done like that on purpose that's right there even even when it comes to technology and white papers and sources of information not even entertainment or news I know the developers who are developing in the platforms for technical information shout out to the developers developers developers who are doing these things in order to create endless scroll even when it comes to the technical data that you need to solve a problem with complex systems they don't want you to leave their ecosystem they want you to stay online they want you to stay engaged even Facebook Instagram they're all designed for the purpose of trying to keep you on the platform so they've been purposely made addictive what is a Mindless scroll what is some of the things we put all of our time and E effort into meaningless you can't you can't take that uh belt you won in that game and cash it in for anything it's a wonder lust and all it's done has robbed us of our Wonder of Christ we're trying to satisfy a thirst for God and a thirst for his Wonder with all the Cheap Thrills the world gives us amen and I can testify I guess maybe I'm not as young as I used to be and so maybe I lose some credibility but nothing Thrills me like Christ amen that's my testimony after nearly 30 50 Years of Living 20s something years of serving God there's still nothing that does more for me than Christ and there's a lot of Glamour in the world a lot of glitter a lot of shine a lot of things to kind of get our attention but the glow of Christ the preciousness of Christ the love of Christ is the only thing that satisfies and with every single person who's in here today there's an innate thirst for God all of us we're created with a hunger for God and what the world has done is taken the system that God knew we were made and wired with and the way that God works with us and relates with us and you and makes himself known doing that to produce character to grow us into His Image the world has taken that and hijacked it given us Cheap Thrills and sensitizing our minds and rewiring our thoughts and the process all because we're made with the hunger and the world's using that hunger against us I believe it may be in Christ as the mystery God revealed he says why do you hunger Church why do you thirst he says it's the father trying to reveal these hidden things to you these hidden secrets to you he says but you let so many things things get that out of you amen you let so many other things hijack your thirst I believe the Wonder of Christ can be restored to us amen if it doesn't throw you like it used to even going to church if it doesn't throw you like you used to fellowship with the Believers doesn't thrill you like you used to there's a lot of other things you'd rather do and spend your time doing unlike it used to be before find the things that are numbing you find the things that are numbing that that are kind of dolling your senses to how wonderful Christ is Revelations chapter 2 verse4 if you could just focus with me sister an I don't have any more slides there but I'm I want to close here and I I want you just to really focus in this it says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy First Love what a statement thou Hast left forsaken left dine your first love it's Chief first in influence the first in influence the thing that influenced you first you've left it and to love it's to welcome to entertain to love dearly to be pleased or contented with so it says you've lost or you've left your first love it's a lost love it's a passion or a feeling that's dying out I I have somewhat against you you've left your first love you've left it dying the thing that used to the influence the thing that you loved dearly you were happy with you were thrilled by now it's dying that passion and if I could say this the love is there it's just not being nourished if you're a son or daughter of God the love for the word is always there just not being nurtured the things of God still mean something to you it's just the flesh you got too much out front there's too much going on in your head all it takes is difficulty sometime where you get stressed out and something happens so maybe using a different example than being addicted to something or all the social media the way that that's got our dopamine Minds working but there could be something just happening in the midst of a Calamity and a stress you get all worked up and you're just in your mind and you forgot oh wait a minute whatsoever time I am afraid trust in him amen so it's not it's not always maybe just something calculated coming out of Leo dea it's just our own turmo and our mixture so the love is still there the desire is still there the faith is still there it's just not being nourished and no matter how real and how strong that love is if it's not nurtured it'll weaken and lose power amen Even in our marriages no matter how real the love is if it's not nurtured it'll weaken no matter how real it might be and strong it may be it loses power if it's not nurtured Jesus said and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold thou Hast left thy first love love is waxing cold because of iniquity iniquity is the deviation from what is right what is virtuous if I could just say iniquity is Wonder lust just to wander away from the true path and that's what causes the cooling of love we could just bow our heads for a moment I'd like to read this statement I've got a statement in scripture but I wanted the heads bow just so we could be pondering this he said what's the matter at the Tabernacle I don't know that there's anything wrong with here it send the light but if you could look at yourself as being a temple of the Holy Ghost you could think very deeply about this he said a man ought to be able to say when you meet a man is your Christian experiences if I can say this in your Christian experience when was it the dearest to you brother B says you ought to be able to say right now well my best experience was back when I first got the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I come just say oh brother You' fallen from Grace that's right left your first love showing that they had something in the beginning and has left it could I ask the same today in your Christian Life when was the most dear time in your Christian experience what moment was the dearest to you and brother bram's implying that if you can't say right now then maybe you've left your first love maybe something you had in the beginning something you had at one time you've left so he says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee this is this Proclamation Revelations thou Hast left thy first love so he says remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first work works and what were the things that he identified at the very beginning of verse two I Know Thy Works thy labor and thy patience I believe we could pray today Lord give me patience I say this to all of us whether we be young families or the veterans I I just look out on and see veteran Believers regardless of where you might be today if you feel there's anything missing and maybe you've been killing patience you'd have a desire to repent and do the first works I just I give an invitation to stand and just say Lord I want to revive patience yes I want to identify those things that are numbing we invite the musicians to come I want to in I want to identify those things that are keeping me from pursuing you keeping me from looking for for your wonder the things that are keeping me from being excited about spiritual things the simple things the systems today as you're all have stood I believe just this is unanimous we're all in one mind in one Accord today unanimous unanimously standing saying Lord my heart's desire is to be awakened to your Wonder more not that you haven't seen it not that he hasn't made him self known but that I can know you more the systems today are so intricate our devices are so flashy there's so much glow glitter out there the Billboards are electric now everything demanding our attention they're certainly not simple it's complicated it's vast it's enormous it's endless and yet Christ is just simple he's still simple yes and that's where he hides himself and Satan's Eden has been designed to try to work on your Humanity to get you to be chasing after all that Glitters and all that shines that's what Babylon looks like when it's she's described is enticing until the word actually pulls back the curtain and we see all the foul wicked things underneath on the outside it's bells and whistles and rewards and Merchants and amenities and pearls and linens and all sort like we can have everything we want and then there's Christ the simple adorned in the word Christ let's get back to the Simplicity of Christ let's pray Heavenly Father Lord today has been uh this sermon has been lengthy Lord I've challenged the people to exercise patience even in processing the things that we preached but Lord I felt that there was enough breath there that we could share and express that if there could just be a a a kind of a kicker at the end and that if anyone could SE relate in their own personal experience to how uh certain behaviors and hobbies and Recreations and and the internet of things and devices and the availability of information and communication Technologies how that has worked on our lives to create an addiction soft as it may be and unseen as it may be Lord we're we're tied more to the entertainments the sports the movies the Fashions the music and all the things that feed our Spirits it's having the first place and that's how we leave our first love is it's no longer the primary influence Lord as I read in that scripture it says go back and do the first Works Lord I want to go back to persevering I want to go back to being patient yes Lord I want to go back to knowing that you'll reward me that if I say no to certain things in the moment if I give myself to silent contemplation if I give myself to prayer if I give myself to say no to movies give myself to say no to YouTube give myself to say no to certain things a a a and the games and all the social Med if I if I say no to it that there'll actually be a healing that will take place in my mind it'll actually become a greater uh a a crust will begin to be taken away to where now your word has more ability to move freely in the rest of my mind and I can be restored to The Wonder of Christ that's my prayer for us today in whatever manner you would choose to deal with the people's Heart Lord I I I want you to deal with their hearts that they
