[27:09] you freely yes sir to the dictates of
[27:14] our hearts
[27:15] Lord not only in offerings Lord which we

[27:29] that uh we desire desire it excuse me so

[27:56] brother
[27:59] how me feel the presence of the Lord

[34:17] as we Endeavor to serve the Lord and
[34:19] grow the work of the Lord there in

[34:22] turn to Isaiah chapter
[34:24] 9 I'll give you my title as you're
[34:27] turning there and you find your place
[34:28] just going to be reading verse six but
[34:30] the title is killing patients and if you
[34:32] were a doctor that'd kind of give you
[34:34] Shivers uh to hear it but it's patience
[34:37] as in The Virtue and just have a lot
[34:41] that I feel led to cover today and Trust
[34:43] it'll mean something to you as we go
[34:45] forward Isaiah chapter
[34:48] 9:6 it says For unto us is a child for
[34:52] unto us a child is born unto us a son is
[34:55] given and the government shall be upon
[34:58] his shoulder and his name Shall be
[35:00] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[35:04] God the Everlasting father the prince of
[35:08] peace and I'm wanting to really focus on
[35:11] that Shall be Called wonderful amen God
[35:14] bless you you could be seated if you're
[35:17] having trouble with the spelling there
[35:18] it is on killing patients it's not the
[35:21] kind that a doctor would have but it's
[35:22] the kind that all of us should have as
[35:24] Christians if you just keep looking
[35:27] there at verse six there of this chapter
[35:29] we just read says For unto us a child is
[35:32] born and unto us a son is given and the
[35:35] government shall be upon his shoulder
[35:37] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[35:40] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[35:43] father the Prince of Peace when it says
[35:47] his name Shall be Called It means he
[35:49] will be so it's not just a title that's
[35:52] given to him but he is going to be and
[35:54] he will be wonderful I want to focus on
[35:56] on that phrase just here at the outset
[35:58] that means he'll be full of wonder he's
[36:01] going to be marvelous and when we take
[36:03] that word a Marvel if it's going to be
[36:05] marvelous a Marvel is a miracle it's uh
[36:08] something that causes astonishment so
[36:11] Christ is going to be wonderful he's
[36:13] going to be marvelous going to be full
[36:15] of wonder something that should Amaze
[36:17] you something that should shock you or
[36:20] be filled with wonder the word that's
[36:21] even used is Wonder struck he he shall
[36:24] be uh so awesome and so great and so
[36:27] marvelous and so wonderful and that it
[36:29] should cause astonishment and that it
[36:31] will actually cause you to be Wonder
[36:33] struck in judges chap 13: 18 says and
[36:37] the angel of the Lord said unto him it's
[36:40] manoah and about the birth of Samson it
[36:43] says why askest thus thou thus after my
[36:45] name seeing it is a secret and it
[36:48] doesn't just mean it wasn't known and
[36:50] nobody knew it but it meant secret means
[36:52] wonderful or incomprehensible or
[36:55] extraordinary uh you're you're seeking
[36:57] after my name that is just so so great
[36:59] and so awesome and so marvelous that
[37:02] what what is it going to do for you just
[37:03] to hear it sound there's so much more to
[37:05] it than just the the phonics and the and
[37:08] the the pronunciation of it and so this
[37:10] is Christ he shall be wonderful he is
[37:13] something that is
[37:15] extraordinary and I I'm saying all this
[37:17] just in the foundation it's the nature
[37:19] of Christ who he is it's the nature of
[37:21] Christ to be all inspiring in other
[37:24] words if you you catch a glimpse of
[37:26] Christ every time it ought to cause some
[37:28] awe and if it's something you've heard
[37:30] before then when you hear it again you
[37:32] remember the awe that you first had uh
[37:34] when you've heard it so the N it's the
[37:35] nature of Christ to inspire all and it
[37:38] is if I could put it this way this is at
[37:40] the real core of what's in my heart
[37:43] Christ can be a source of endless wonder
[37:47] that if he's marvelous if his name is
[37:49] secret incomprehensible and
[37:52] inexhaustible then it is the nature of
[37:54] Christ to be all inspiring and it is to
[37:57] be an endless source of
[38:00] Wonder now with that as one building
[38:03] block I want to introduce two two
[38:06] phrases or one term and a phrase and the
[38:09] first one is
[38:10] wonderlust and this will probably make
[38:12] more sense as we continue but anybody
[38:15] ever heard the uh the term wonderlust
[38:18] before it means a strong longing for or
[38:21] the impulse for
[38:23] wondering and it has kind of Taken on
[38:26] this Con ation now where people who love
[38:27] to travel uh they have a Wonder lust and
[38:30] they want to travel and the idea with
[38:32] Wonder lust though is not not so much
[38:34] getting to a particular destination but
[38:37] just it doesn't matter just enjoy the
[38:39] journey we're just on the road and so
[38:41] Wonder lust means kind of aimless and it
[38:44] at the heart of it there's no vision
[38:47] there's no goal there's no real purpose
[38:48] in doing what you're doing just want to
[38:50] get out on the road and just want to
[38:51] drive and and just kind of have this
[38:53] itch just to wander around and move and
[38:55] do stuff and in doing so not have any
[38:58] real goal in mind no place you really
[39:00] want to be it's just I just kind of feel
[39:02] anxious I just kind of I just want to
[39:04] wonder I just want to move along
[39:07] and wonder lust let me let me just say
[39:10] it this way it's not it's not a positive
[39:12] thing in the way that I'm wanting to
[39:14] look at it and then the other word I
[39:16] phrase I want to look at or just
[39:17] introduce is Wonder lost so you have
[39:20] Wonder lust which is this aimless
[39:22] pointless travel uh this uh wandering
[39:25] with no vision no purpose no goal and
[39:27] then you have Wonder lost and by that I
[39:31] mean to say that it's when we lose the
[39:33] sense of all or the excitement and
[39:36] amazement of Christ
[39:38] amen and I'm tying these things together
[39:40] now these aimless Pursuits or we call
[39:42] them Wonder lust cause a loss of Wonder
[39:45] for things that are real uh for things
[39:47] that are simple and things that are of
[39:48] God things that we have things that we
[39:50] presently possess and we just have an
[39:52] itch we just feel like we just need to
[39:54] be be moving we need to be going it's
[39:55] like what do you trying to accomplish
[39:57] what's your vision what's your goal what
[39:59] what fruit will this produce where will
[40:00] this get you a few years down the road
[40:02] oh it doesn't matter I I just feel
[40:04] uncomfortable I just feel like I need to
[40:05] move I need to I want to do something
[40:08] and it's that Wonder lust that causes
[40:10] the greatness of Christ to be diminished
[40:12] in our lives and I I want to uh
[40:16] emphasize this meaningless Pursuits have
[40:18] the impact of causing us to lose the
[40:22] Wonder of Christ amen and if that
[40:25] happens I would say that restoring the
[40:27] Wonder begins with recognizing the cause
[40:30] of Wonder lust that when someone when we
[40:32] when we engage in things that kind of
[40:34] captivate our attention in such a way to
[40:36] where those things seem to be more
[40:38] important in the the wonders of Christ
[40:41] than the way that we can restore The
[40:42] Wonder of Christ is find find the cause
[40:46] of our Wonder lust now that as a
[40:48] foundation I want to get to my subject
[40:51] of killing patience and we'll be able to
[40:53] kind of refer back to some of these uh
[40:56] PR principles as we go forward uh this
[40:58] is very practical if you were hoping
[41:00] that I would come and preach on the
[41:01] Seven Seals I'll say it's in there
[41:03] somewhere if you if you pay attention
[41:05] enough I really do I will say this I
[41:08] believe that any effective Ministry in
[41:10] in this end time is preaching from an
[41:12] open book and the opening of the word
[41:14] and we see that whether it be teachers
[41:16] or evangelist or pastors uh Apostles
[41:19] they're all they it to be in the the
[41:21] middle of the road now you got to be in
[41:23] the opening of the word and bringing it
[41:24] from the the open the things that have
[41:26] been open to us in this day but this is
[41:28] going to be very very practical and I
[41:30] want to take a journey through scripture
[41:33] uh and on patience and we're going to be
[41:36] arriving at a conclusion and if you
[41:37] could focus and stay with me I think
[41:39] it'll be worth it when we get there so
[41:41] I'm telling you up front that if it
[41:43] doesn't make any sense when we get to
[41:44] the end and if it doesn't mean anything
[41:45] to you then I'll just blame it on you
[41:47] amen I just say you didn't focus enough
[41:50] so I told you at the outset this is not
[41:52] Wonder lust we're not just wondering
[41:53] aimlessly through scripture but we we're
[41:55] focused and if you can focus with me
[41:57] we'll end up somewhere that I believe
[41:58] will be a blessing to you if we can stay
[42:01] focused I'm going to give you my outline
[42:03] at the outset so if you want to jot this
[42:05] down you'll know once we get to like
[42:07] this third part that we're nearing the
[42:09] the end and so I want to give you three
[42:12] three segments of what we're going to be
[42:14] ministering on this morning as an
[42:16] outline and the first part is patience
[42:19] leads to
[42:20] rewards we're talking about killing
[42:22] patience and and just developing this
[42:24] principle of patience patience leads to
[42:26] rewards and and there's uh the thought
[42:28] of creating motivation and the process
[42:30] of reinforcement that exist in the word
[42:33] of God and that happens to us personally
[42:35] and even natural Endeavors we realize
[42:37] that patience leads to rewards the
[42:38] rewards create motivation and there's
[42:40] this process of
[42:42] reinforcement the second part then is
[42:44] once we've established that I want to
[42:46] identify how that patience is an
[42:48] essential attribute of God it's a
[42:51] characteristic of God and therefore it
[42:53] is an essential attribute of his
[42:54] children and those who are a Believer by
[42:57] birth this patience is an essential
[43:00] attribute and then to tie it all
[43:02] together even our intro there I want to
[43:04] say that killing patience or the death
[43:06] of patience has resulted in Wonder lust
[43:09] and wonder loss it's the death of
[43:11] patience that has caused us to lose the
[43:13] Wonder of Christ and if I could say this
[43:17] uh kind of as my thesis statement that
[43:19] I'll be tracking over the next few
[43:20] moments here is that as in in general
[43:23] and I'm not trying to call anybody out
[43:25] in particular
[43:26] uh that I would kind of get your Gander
[43:28] up a little bit by feeling like I'm
[43:29] pointing at you but in general we're
[43:31] increasingly
[43:33] impatient it's the nature of just how
[43:35] Society has evolved and technology has
[43:37] evolved and opportunities present
[43:38] themselves uh we're increasingly
[43:40] impatient when it comes to do a number
[43:42] of things when we go if I could just use
[43:44] as an example if some of you go out to
[43:46] eat this afternoon you may call ahead to
[43:48] the restaurant or you may come in and
[43:49] they say that'll be a 30 minute wait and
[43:51] what are we going to do I forget about
[43:52] it right I'm not waiting 30 minutes to
[43:54] eat because we've been conditioned to
[43:56] not have to wait and and and we're more
[43:58] or less becoming impatient and in other
[44:02] things we're very uh we're Restless to
[44:05] experience a thrill uh anymore we're
[44:08] just not satisfied sitting down doing
[44:10] nothing and if and some of you maybe you
[44:12] could try it just go sit down on a swing
[44:16] and do nothing and see how long you
[44:17] could sit there and do it without
[44:19] itching to reach for something uh and
[44:21] and check something and find out you
[44:23] know who's winning and and what the
[44:25] stocks are doing and whether or not
[44:27] someone has messaged you or do something
[44:29] and so we have a Wonder lust where we're
[44:32] we're never quite happy just being bored
[44:35] uh We're Never Satisfied doing nothing
[44:37] there's got to be something else uh
[44:39] happening in order to keep us active or
[44:41] to keep us engaged even to the point now
[44:43] where this idea of multitasking which I
[44:45] think they've scientifically proved you
[44:46] can't truly
[44:48] multitask but we can't wash the dishes
[44:50] without listening to something in our
[44:52] ears right can I get some amens from my
[44:54] kids amen uh wa can't we can't work
[44:56] without music playing in the background
[44:58] there there's always got to be something
[44:59] else happening and we're trying to all
[45:01] all these multitasking it's just these
[45:04] it's the way our minds have been
[45:05] conditioned to where it can't just be
[45:07] one thing that we're focused on there's
[45:09] got to be all this noise that goes along
[45:11] with it if I could Define what it means
[45:13] to be impatient at the beginning maybe
[45:16] it'll help us to invert a little bit and
[45:18] know what we mean by patience but to be
[45:20] impatient means to be restless under
[45:22] existing
[45:24] conditions and to not be able to bear or
[45:27] endure your current state so when you're
[45:30] impatient you become Restless under uh
[45:34] what whatever you're facing at the
[45:35] moment I don't like this I I want to
[45:36] change it I I'm not happy I'm
[45:38] dissatisfied and there's a restlessness
[45:40] or not being able to bear or endure
[45:43] under your current state and that's what
[45:45] impatience uh
[45:47] means now the first part of this or if
[45:50] you're counting maybe this is the
[45:51] seventh part but of the three things I
[45:53] gave you in the outline patience leads
[45:55] to
[45:56] rewards and if I could say it this way
[45:59] summarize it this way rewards are earned
[46:00] through patience and uh being patient
[46:04] then is a process that inspires us and
[46:08] motivates us so if you have patience it
[46:10] leads to the reward and then we realize
[46:12] oh if I can be patient there's a payoff
[46:16] does that make sense don't don't worry
[46:17] about um encouraging me today um I it
[46:21] it'll help me now in Hebrews chapter 6:
[46:23] 10 11 and 12 we'll see this in the
[46:26] scripture says for God is Not
[46:27] unrighteous to forget your work and
[46:30] labor of love amen which you have showed
[46:32] towards his name and that you have
[46:33] ministered to the Saints and do minister
[46:35] so the these have been these Hebrews had
[46:38] been working they had been laboring and
[46:41] Paul is saying God won't forget it amen
[46:43] and the kindness that you've showed the
[46:45] labor that you've given God won't forget
[46:47] it and he's saying this to encourage
[46:49] them to continue to labor to to not
[46:52] slack off to to continue to do what
[46:54] you're doing and we desire that every
[46:56] one of you do show the same diligence to
[46:58] the full Assurance of Hope un the end
[47:01] this is this is him saying those who are
[47:04] working continue to work and we would
[47:05] that all of you would work amen uh what
[47:08] happens often in many different groups
[47:10] or organizations there's uh you know 20%
[47:13] of the people do 80% of the work or
[47:15] sometimes it's 2% of the people do 90
[47:18] 100% of all the work and and Paul is
[47:21] saying maybe it's he's speaking to the
[47:22] 20% who do all the labor who do all the
[47:24] work and say hey
[47:26] you're doing great continue keep it up
[47:28] he goes and I would that all of you
[47:29] would show the same diligence as these
[47:31] others and he says to the full Assurance
[47:33] of Hope un the end so notice that Paul
[47:36] is not zeroing in on well you got the
[47:38] job done and you can accomplished the
[47:40] task you served on that Saturday and
[47:41] that was great that was wonderful he's
[47:43] saying there's the full Assurance of
[47:45] Hope in the end that what you have done
[47:48] and what you've labored to do God won't
[47:50] forget it because God is a rewarder and
[47:52] will give to you according to your labor
[47:55] amen so he says that you be not slothful
[47:57] I would hope that you would all show the
[47:59] same diligence and be not slothful but
[48:01] followers of them who through faith and
[48:03] patience inherit the promises that's
[48:06] right the language that Paul is using
[48:08] here shows that he he's promoting the
[48:11] the virtues of endurance he's promoting
[48:13] being steadfast and longsuffering stick
[48:15] with it continue and even if it get gets
[48:18] hard don't don't let up because uh
[48:21] there's a reward in this and show the
[48:22] same diligence to full Assurance of Hope
[48:24] in the end and uh don't be slothful and
[48:27] but look at the others who've been
[48:29] patient who've endured who've uh gone
[48:31] through things and they've inherited the
[48:32] blessing of the promise
[48:35] amen the word that's used even of
[48:39] longsuffering and patience is it's the
[48:41] combination of a to be long something
[48:44] that's a far off and and and long
[48:46] lasting and thumos which is uh to or
[48:50] passion or wrath so when it speaks of
[48:53] patience I think this is real real
[48:56] critical and I I apologize if I'm not as
[48:58] dynamic as your pastor when it comes to
[49:00] speaking uh but I hope you can hold your
[49:03] attention the the the to to this macros
[49:07] thumos this combination of these words
[49:09] it's it's a something long or far off
[49:11] and then wrath or passion so patience or
[49:14] to be longsuffering means you put
[49:16] passion off you put your wrath off it's
[49:19] the regulation of emotions to be patient
[49:21] means you're you're not quick to satisfy
[49:23] the desire for something amen uh you C
[49:26] you can stick with it and then Paul
[49:28] takes faith and patience and he says be
[49:30] followers of them who through faith and
[49:32] patience and herit the promise and so
[49:34] there's this marriage in this Union
[49:36] between faith and patience amen and it's
[49:39] a necessary Union for faith in order to
[49:42] be for it to be expressed and
[49:44] rewarded if you had Faith but no
[49:47] patience what happens your faith your
[49:50] faith uh is tried and your faith is
[49:53] buffeted and your faith things are
[49:54] coming against it without patience he's
[49:56] saying with faith and patience you
[49:58] inherit the promises so you have to have
[50:01] patience with your faith in order for
[50:03] your faith to ultimately be expressed
[50:05] and by that expression God rewards you
[50:08] for it amen in Revelations chapter 13:10
[50:12] he that leadth into captivity shall go
[50:14] into captivity he that kth with the
[50:16] sword must be killed with the sword here
[50:19] is the patience and the faith of the
[50:21] Saints so this patience and faith are
[50:24] combined together again and faith we can
[50:26] say is the if we want to put it maybe in
[50:28] a a simple way it's the capacity to
[50:31] believe it it's the it's the ability to
[50:34] trust and to the ability to have this
[50:37] full Assurance of something and not just
[50:39] intellectually accept something but it's
[50:41] the capacity to put your trust in in
[50:44] something Your Capacity to have
[50:45] confidence in something and patience
[50:48] would be the virtue to endure unto the
[50:50] possessing of it if I believe in
[50:53] something it means I I trust it I have
[50:54] confidence in it and then my patience
[50:56] kind of is upholding me to receive the
[50:59] very thing that I believe in brother
[51:02] Bram says now faithfulness and patience
[51:04] uh go together the Bible says in Hebrews
[51:08] chapter
[51:11] 10:36 brother Braham even says it
[51:13] another place he says have a real have
[51:15] real genuine Faith you have real genuine
[51:17] patience so when you have real genuine
[51:20] Faith you have real genuine patience
[51:22] these things are these things connect
[51:23] together in Hebrews 10:36 for you for
[51:27] you have need of patience that after
[51:29] you've done the will of God you might
[51:31] receive the promise yes there's that
[51:33] patience that you have need of patience
[51:35] that after you've done the will of God
[51:37] you endure you persevere there's
[51:39] something sustaining there's something
[51:40] that's preserving you that after you
[51:42] have done the will of God you might
[51:44] receive the promise so you fa you have
[51:46] faith to believe now you have need of
[51:48] patience that when you by faith through
[51:50] the will of God you endure you persevere
[51:52] you withhold yourself from things that
[51:54] would distract you don't give in to the
[51:56] Wrath you you're you're able to regulate
[51:58] your emotions not quick to desire
[52:00] satisfy the desire for something and
[52:02] therefore you see that you receive the
[52:04] promise amen amen means you're not
[52:06] swerved from your deliberate purpose I
[52:08] have need of patience I have faith faith
[52:10] is settled on the word of God it sees
[52:12] something long range it knows it's there
[52:14] now I have need of patience so I'm not
[52:16] going to be swerved from this this
[52:18] intentional purpose I'm not going to uh
[52:20] become unloyal there's this loyalty to
[52:23] Faith despite circumstances
[52:26] in Hebrews 12 veres 1 2 and 3 it says
[52:30] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[52:32] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[52:34] let us lay aside every weight and the
[52:37] sin which doth so easily beset us and
[52:39] let us run with patience the race that
[52:42] is set before us right say it's it's the
[52:45] patience we need to reach the Finish
[52:47] Line he says looking unto Jesus the
[52:49] author and finisher of our faith who for
[52:52] the joy that was set before him endured
[52:55] the cross despising the shame and is sat
[52:59] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[53:00] God for consider him that endured such
[53:04] contradiction of Sinners against himself
[53:07] lest ye be wearied and faint in your
[53:09] minds amen Paul as he writes this it's
[53:12] really hard to read over this and not
[53:13] want to stop and just go through a lot
[53:14] of the different elements in this
[53:16] because it's such a rich and very very
[53:18] deep verses especially as he comes to
[53:20] the end of what he's been writing to the
[53:21] Hebrews and he's given these clouds of
[53:23] witnesses and the law the types of the
[53:26] Tabernacle and Temple and worship that
[53:27] Christ is the Fulfillment he's the
[53:29] ultimate of the Jewish faith I said now
[53:32] that we have this this cloud of
[53:33] witnesses let us as lay aside every
[53:36] weight and run with patience and as we
[53:39] run with patience he says let's see an
[53:41] example of what it means to run and to
[53:43] run with patience because Christ endured
[53:46] this is this is the example of
[53:48] persevering and being longsuffering and
[53:51] and having a long range vision and the
[53:52] and the fortitude to stick with it who
[53:54] end endured the cross and endured
[53:56] contradictions against
[53:58] himself and Paul when he's writing this
[54:01] and I and I feel confident being able to
[54:02] say this taking in uh as we continue to
[54:05] read a few other places he's creating
[54:08] motivation he's wanting to establish
[54:11] expectations that this is not just
[54:13] you're going to things are going to get
[54:14] hard or things are going to be difficult
[54:15] and not everything's always going to be
[54:17] pleasing to your flesh but listen that
[54:19] it's worth it yes amen it may not feel
[54:21] like it in the moment but it's going to
[54:23] be worth it it's going to yield
[54:24] Peaceable fr it's going to yield virtues
[54:26] it's going to yield a great reward and
[54:28] so Paul is writing in such a way to say
[54:31] be patient there's a reward that comes
[54:34] am and in doing so create a motivation
[54:36] for people to stick with something that
[54:38] they believe in and hold fast to things
[54:40] that are real and things that are true
[54:42] and again this patience meaning to not
[54:45] be quick to satisfy urges or satisfy
[54:47] longings or desires that would be
[54:49] contrary to the goal or the motivation
[54:52] or the the thing that we're trying to
[54:53] accomplish amen so a way of uh telling
[54:56] the person you need to run a race and
[54:58] this race is going to be difficult and
[55:00] it's going to be long and it's going to
[55:01] be hard but he's establishing
[55:03] expectations that at the finish line or
[55:05] as you persevere and run with patience
[55:06] there's a joy there's something coming
[55:09] amen and he says unless you be wearied
[55:11] and faint in your mind this is the
[55:12] condition of not having patience and
[55:15] have patience and run the race with
[55:17] patience because if you don't have
[55:18] patience you're going to get weary
[55:20] you're going to faint in your minds
[55:21] you're going to you're going to lose
[55:22] your
[55:24] steadfastness in Romans chap 2: 6 and 7
[55:27] he's speaking of God who is a rewarder
[55:29] he says God who will render to every man
[55:31] according to his deeds to them who by
[55:34] patient
[55:36] continuance remember the Paul writes in
[55:38] Romans that God is a rewarder them that
[55:40] diligently seek him that if you're
[55:42] persevering if you persist if you're
[55:44] patient that God rewards and as he has
[55:46] already said in Hebrews 6 God is Not
[55:49] unrighteous to forget your labor of love
[55:51] it's a this a characteristic of God to
[55:53] be a
[55:54] rewarder and he's saying that God will
[55:56] give to every man according to his labor
[55:58] according to his Works he says to them
[56:00] who by patient continuance in
[56:03] wello now I hope that phrase doesn't
[56:06] need to uh bring out the different
[56:08] translations in it means when you're
[56:11] steadfast and endure in doing
[56:14] good doing what you know is right and I
[56:18] believe that that's something that
[56:19] speaks of integrity and having
[56:20] characters when you know you're doing
[56:22] the right thing even if it's difficult
[56:24] even if in the moment it's not going to
[56:26] bring you immediate uh results and if
[56:27] you're faced with the situation where it
[56:29] says well you can you can do it the
[56:31] right way and get the job done the right
[56:33] way and produce long lasting results a
[56:36] and and get a better benefit in the end
[56:37] or you could cut corners and make more
[56:39] money and get the job done faster a and
[56:42] it's the cutting Corners people do that
[56:43] because they don't have the patience to
[56:45] do it right they don't have the
[56:47] steadfastness they don't have the
[56:48] Integrity to do it well and so the
[56:50] phrase to them who bu patient
[56:52] continuance and well-doing is a mouthful
[56:55] those who God will reward and give to
[56:57] those who by patiently continuing and
[57:00] doing good notice he says seek for Glory
[57:04] and Honor and immortality he'll give
[57:06] them eternal life so it's not wrong to
[57:09] seek for the rewards of God to them who
[57:12] by patient continuance and well-doing
[57:14] seek for Glory and Honor and immortality
[57:16] these are seeking for the right kind of
[57:18] Glory the right kind of honor the right
[57:20] kind of immortality it's not the carnal
[57:22] side and not the the the prideful side
[57:24] we say that we ought to in patient
[57:27] continuance seek for the rewards that
[57:29] God has promised to those who endure
[57:32] amen James chapter 1 verses 2 to 4 my
[57:36] brethren count it all joy when you fall
[57:37] into diverse Temptations knowing this
[57:40] that the trying of your faith worketh
[57:44] patience now that this is the trying of
[57:46] your faith gives patience a
[57:48] job if your faith is never tried
[57:51] patience never has a is unemployed right
[57:55] you may have faith but if it's never
[57:56] tested if it's never buffeted if it's
[57:58] never challenged the and the patience is
[58:00] just laying over there saying man I I'm
[58:02] I'm getting rusty I'm getting tired I'm
[58:05] trying to collect unemployment they
[58:06] don't pay it here and patience doesn't
[58:08] have a job so it says when you the trer
[58:11] Faith Works patience it gives patience
[58:13] something to do so if brother brandom
[58:15] says that when you have real genuine
[58:16] Faith you have real genuine patience
[58:18] then patience you have faith and then
[58:20] patience never activates until faith is
[58:23] tested and then patience is like yes
[58:26] this is my chance this is my opportunity
[58:29] the faithfulness and patience go
[58:31] together as brother R said so the TR of
[58:32] your faith worketh patience and he says
[58:34] but let patience have her perfect work
[58:37] that you may be perfect and entire
[58:39] wanting nothing when we have faith and
[58:42] it's tested it gives patience a job this
[58:44] is my opportunity this is my part when
[58:46] you're really going through it this is
[58:47] when I can step up and this is what I
[58:49] can endure and I can lift up and I can
[58:51] uphold and then you patiently endure and
[58:55] and it says that you may be perfect and
[58:56] entire wanting nothing there's your
[58:58] reward that when patience has her
[59:01] perfect work when you when you let it
[59:03] let it uh live and you let it Thrive and
[59:05] you let it do what it's supposed to it
[59:06] produces the positive results the gospel
[59:08] says it can bring Amen brother bam says
[59:11] there's absolutely no other way in which
[59:13] to gain
[59:14] patience it has to come by the trial of
[59:16] your faith that's right
[59:20] amen otherwise patience never steps up
[59:23] amen patience can't come to the plate it
[59:25] can't it can't rise up the only way that
[59:27] you can demonstrate or have patience is
[59:30] when you need it in the trial of your
[59:33] faith continues to write this in the
[59:35] same chapter the church age book in thot
[59:37] Tre and church age God's will for us is
[59:39] perfection and that Perfection is
[59:42] patience waiting on God and waiting for
[59:45] God this is the process of character
[59:48] development this is a a very important
[59:52] Concept in the message of the hours
[59:53] brother Bram touches on on it in
[59:55] different places in his ministry this
[59:57] the maturing part the process of growing
[59:59] and maturing and you says you you become
[1:00:01] a son by birth but you're not born a man
[1:00:04] you to grow and develop into spiritual
[1:00:06] maturity so this is the process of
[1:00:07] character development how highly God has
[1:00:09] commended these Saints of the Dark Ages
[1:00:11] patient as Lambs led to the slaughter
[1:00:13] lovingly Faithfully they served God that
[1:00:16] is all they wanted out of life just
[1:00:18] service to their lord how great was to
[1:00:20] be their
[1:00:22] reward patience the scriptures tell us
[1:00:24] essential to Perfection faith and
[1:00:27] patience working together here is they
[1:00:28] had faith and they believed and they
[1:00:30] were patient under trial and all they
[1:00:32] wanted out of life was just to serve
[1:00:34] their lord and since that's what they
[1:00:35] wanted to do and that was their faith
[1:00:37] and they could endure and they could go
[1:00:38] through difficulties and they go through
[1:00:40] hard trials and brother B says great how
[1:00:42] great was to be their
[1:00:44] reward and he's taking that this idea of
[1:00:47] God's will for us is perfection using
[1:00:49] the example of they in the Dark Ages who
[1:00:51] like Lambs were led to the slaughter
[1:00:53] Faithfully serving God they what they
[1:00:55] wanted out of life was service to God he
[1:00:56] says there's a reward for that amen and
[1:01:00] God's will for us is perfection and
[1:01:02] Perfection is
[1:01:04] patience that you cannot be perfected we
[1:01:06] say well you can't be perfected without
[1:01:08] suffering we've heard that right perfect
[1:01:10] character simply never made without
[1:01:12] suffering maybe there's an unspoken
[1:01:14] ingredient there
[1:01:16] patience that if you suffer without
[1:01:18] patience it can't produce
[1:01:20] Perfection because a lot of us can say
[1:01:22] hey I've suffered a lot gone through a
[1:01:25] lot could anybody say that we've
[1:01:26] suffered and it hasn't always produced
[1:01:28] the character that it ought to you get
[1:01:30] more sour and critical you get you get
[1:01:33] more tough and H and obstinate or get a
[1:01:36] little bit more numb you say well the
[1:01:38] the hard trials I've gone through
[1:01:39] haven't really produce the character
[1:01:41] that it should say it was missing the
[1:01:42] ingredients of
[1:01:44] patience and that it it is missing and
[1:01:47] maybe I should back up maybe maybe we're
[1:01:49] going to have more points to this
[1:01:50] outline than we intended but if you pay
[1:01:52] if you have faith that suffering and
[1:01:54] that trial of your faith you have the if
[1:01:56] you have faith you have patience those
[1:01:58] are the necessary ingredients to turn
[1:01:59] suffering into character amen because
[1:02:02] there's a lot of people that go through
[1:02:03] suffering but they never it never
[1:02:04] produces character right so there's the
[1:02:06] quality of a born- again believer who
[1:02:08] through faith and patience it can
[1:02:10] produce the character of Christ that
[1:02:11] that that gold that character of
[1:02:14] Christ and and I know these are large
[1:02:17] principles and maybe I wouldn't even
[1:02:18] have the Liberty to preach them in a lot
[1:02:20] of places except here I know you're
[1:02:22] Faithfully taught and and you understand
[1:02:24] a lot of these things that we could just
[1:02:25] pull from things you've already been
[1:02:27] taught and put it into a picture that's
[1:02:29] hopefully helpful for you now if
[1:02:31] patience is critical to character
[1:02:34] development critical to perfect Faith
[1:02:36] critical to Perfection then it begs the
[1:02:39] question if suffering is to produce
[1:02:42] perfect character if patience produces
[1:02:45] uh maturing in perfect Faith or
[1:02:48] Perfection then we can say then what is
[1:02:50] it that hinders our maturing what is it
[1:02:54] that would hinder our ability to grow
[1:02:57] and and I'm kind of giving you a little
[1:02:58] bit of a peak where we're headed with
[1:02:59] this in the closing just think about how
[1:03:02] it Modern Life Is by Design is
[1:03:06] manipulating our
[1:03:08] Humanity by design it knows how we think
[1:03:12] it knows what we respond to and it knows
[1:03:15] that if you present certain things
[1:03:16] visually that it'll get your attention
[1:03:19] it knows that if it uses uh certain
[1:03:21] things in a certain way at a certain
[1:03:23] time that it can cap capure your
[1:03:25] attention and there's a way that things
[1:03:27] have been designed and constructed and
[1:03:29] it's all really at the core economics
[1:03:31] and capitalism and the bottom line of
[1:03:32] the dollar or people are motivated to
[1:03:35] use the way that you're wired to line
[1:03:38] their pockets with cash I'm just using
[1:03:40] it in very simple terms and think about
[1:03:43] just maybe don't get lost in the thought
[1:03:45] but just for a moment think about how
[1:03:47] that the things of life and and the
[1:03:49] Technologies and entertainments and
[1:03:50] things that we interact with and the
[1:03:52] things that we use how that it's
[1:03:54] perverting
[1:03:57] patience and let me just inject this the
[1:04:00] original sin was the result of
[1:04:01] impatience that's right brother BR said
[1:04:03] Adam's bride could not wait she was
[1:04:06] enticed into impatience that even if you
[1:04:09] go back and look at the conversation
[1:04:11] there was something to cause the woman
[1:04:13] to think well I'm no longer happy in my
[1:04:16] current state because this this serpent
[1:04:19] is telling me that God knows the day
[1:04:21] that you eat you'll become as Gods
[1:04:23] knowing good from evil and she realized
[1:04:25] wait a minute there's something withheld
[1:04:26] from me there's something more there's
[1:04:28] something else I could be doing there's
[1:04:30] something else out there for me and she
[1:04:31] became impatient brother brah said God
[1:04:34] promised to multiply them but they had
[1:04:36] to wait until God's
[1:04:39] time I know this is maybe serving my
[1:04:41] sermon a little bit but it was the seeds
[1:04:43] of wonderlust like are you sure you've
[1:04:45] experienced everything you can and you
[1:04:47] know there's more out there and God
[1:04:49] knows that you'll become as Gods knowing
[1:04:50] good from Evil and there's there's this
[1:04:52] other this journey you could take and
[1:04:54] things that you can
[1:04:55] experience and so the original sin
[1:04:58] involved impatience it involved enticing
[1:05:01] the woman out of a state of contentment
[1:05:03] with the things that God had given and
[1:05:05] brother brah says it in more than just a
[1:05:06] couple places it was an oncoming promise
[1:05:08] it was Adam's bride could not wait she
[1:05:11] could not wait until God's time so that
[1:05:13] means that God made a promise it'll get
[1:05:16] there eventually just with patience wait
[1:05:18] for it amen endure to the time of
[1:05:20] fulfillment and then Satan comes and
[1:05:22] says no you need to do this you need to
[1:05:23] do that no you want to have it way you
[1:05:24] want to have it that way and getting the
[1:05:25] whole thing out of
[1:05:27] cater if I could say this uh in in a way
[1:05:30] maybe just as it Wells up within my
[1:05:32] heart the role of patience I believe is
[1:05:34] uh the role of patience imperfection is
[1:05:36] just too easily
[1:05:39] misunderstood and if I could say it this
[1:05:41] way there's this Catholic ideology o of
[1:05:44] suffering where you're to actually
[1:05:46] physically harm yourself and there's
[1:05:48] this deprivation of certain things and
[1:05:50] there's a uh uh they looked at suffering
[1:05:54] in the sense of uh of it's kind of
[1:05:57] manufactured and it's uh you know
[1:05:59] archaic tortures maybe the way we would
[1:06:01] think of it now but there's a daily
[1:06:03] suffering and there's a daily uh
[1:06:06] activation of patience that we all must
[1:06:08] have there's a way that we suffer and
[1:06:10] it's not uh people knocking on your door
[1:06:12] to come in and handcuff you if you if
[1:06:14] you name the name of Christ it's not
[1:06:16] depriving yourself of certain things so
[1:06:18] that you that you you suffer from uh
[1:06:20] your
[1:06:21] self-imposed uh pentanes that not the
[1:06:24] suffering so I think the role of
[1:06:25] patience imperfection is often conflated
[1:06:28] with you know Catholic ideas or theology
[1:06:30] about suffering and we shouldn't do
[1:06:33] that now I hope that there's been enough
[1:06:36] there just kind of seated in there to
[1:06:37] see that patience if you endure that
[1:06:40] there's a benefit there's a there's a
[1:06:41] reward that comes now patience is and
[1:06:45] this is that next step step in this
[1:06:47] patience is an intrinsic characteristic
[1:06:50] of
[1:06:51] God it's an essential attribute
[1:06:54] for The Believer by birth and this is
[1:06:58] not something that you're necessarily
[1:06:59] going to have uh innate by human uh
[1:07:03] human birth but this is something that
[1:07:05] we we always want to encourage us not
[1:07:07] just to become better humans but to be
[1:07:09] born again to become better Christians
[1:07:11] amen because there's a lot of principles
[1:07:13] of scripture that I believe that we
[1:07:14] could teach and if everyone would adopt
[1:07:15] them even without a birth we'd be in a
[1:07:17] much better Society if everybody could
[1:07:19] abide by it but uh because there's a lot
[1:07:21] of principles of living and life and
[1:07:23] wisdom and the scripture but we're goal
[1:07:25] our goal is not just to reform but to be
[1:07:28] transformed and and so there's this uh
[1:07:31] patience is an attribute of God and it's
[1:07:32] also an attribute of a born- again
[1:07:34] believer Amen in second Peter chapter
[1:07:36] 3:9 it says the Lord is not slack
[1:07:39] concerning his promise as some men count
[1:07:41] slackness but as longsuffering to usw
[1:07:44] not willing that any should perish but
[1:07:46] that all should come to repentance in
[1:07:49] other words God is patient yes God is
[1:07:52] not Dull or inactive even if if it seems
[1:07:54] like he's not working there's a hand
[1:07:55] that he works on that we can't see
[1:07:57] there's a way that he moves that we
[1:07:58] don't always know and so God is patient
[1:08:01] he's not inactive he's not listless or
[1:08:03] lazy a and
[1:08:06] God uh God is able uh to God is not slow
[1:08:10] to get what's happening amen God's not
[1:08:12] slow to appreciate what is going on
[1:08:14] because this is way God is Not slack
[1:08:16] like some men consider slackness
[1:08:18] concerning his promise that things are
[1:08:20] happening like God do you not see what's
[1:08:22] happening over here there's a there's a
[1:08:23] flood or there's a fire there's sickness
[1:08:26] there's trouble my family's falling
[1:08:27] apart God do you not see what's going
[1:08:29] God is not slow to know what the real
[1:08:32] need is God is not slow to appreciate
[1:08:34] what is happening amen uh there's a kind
[1:08:37] of a phrase that it says if you maintain
[1:08:39] your cool and you keep your head while
[1:08:41] everybody else is losing theirs then you
[1:08:43] obviously don't understand the situation
[1:08:46] right because that's what the world the
[1:08:47] conclusion of the world comes to it's
[1:08:48] like man everything's going crazy
[1:08:50] there's so much chaos there's pandemics
[1:08:52] there's economic Doom we could have
[1:08:55] either depending on which side you're on
[1:08:57] both sides are fretting two terms of
[1:08:59] Biden or another term of trump and
[1:09:01] everybody's in full Panic right and then
[1:09:05] if you're over there just kind of
[1:09:06] keeping your cool saying I vote I I know
[1:09:08] where my election lies and and you're
[1:09:11] steadfast and you're constant you're
[1:09:12] keeping your eyes on the word of God
[1:09:14] people say well you just obviously don't
[1:09:16] understand the situation oh I had a
[1:09:19] friend in college one time tell me says
[1:09:20] man you never sweat what's like you you
[1:09:23] never get ruffled you're not worried and
[1:09:24] I was like this is a it was a perfect
[1:09:26] opportunity to testify so I found an
[1:09:29] absolute amen found something sure
[1:09:31] Hallelujah i i i my life is not hinged
[1:09:34] on what college I get into it's not
[1:09:36] depending on what kind of grades I get
[1:09:38] at the end of the day if I get the best
[1:09:39] grades ever in the history of ever and
[1:09:41] it's not God's will for me to have a
[1:09:43] seven figure paying job guess what I'm
[1:09:45] not going to get
[1:09:46] it God's will is the controlling Factor
[1:09:50] so God is not slow to recognize what
[1:09:53] happen happen
[1:09:54] but his wisdom is in his
[1:09:56] patience God's not slack concerning his
[1:09:59] promises as some men count slackness but
[1:10:00] his longsuffering to us we not willing
[1:10:03] that any should perish but that all
[1:10:04] should come to repentance God's wisdom
[1:10:06] lies in the fact that he's not always
[1:10:07] quick to
[1:10:09] act in Exodus 34:6 and the Lord passed
[1:10:12] by before him proclaimed the Lord the
[1:10:14] Lord God merciful and gracious
[1:10:16] long-suffering and abundant in goodness
[1:10:18] and Truth these are attributes of God
[1:10:20] and he is gracious in longsuffering
[1:10:25] characteristic of God to be
[1:10:27] longsuffering second Peter 3:15 and
[1:10:29] count that the longsuffering of Our Lord
[1:10:31] is salvation amen his longsuffering is
[1:10:34] salvation longsuffering is the product
[1:10:36] of his wisdom and his knowing all things
[1:10:38] it's a this is an attribute of God that
[1:10:40] is I'm so glad that he has
[1:10:43] it amen I I I remember and I kind of I
[1:10:46] cringe just thinking about it but I
[1:10:48] remember the first time I ever preached
[1:10:49] a sermon I said I made a comment to the
[1:10:52] effect and I'm sure there's a tape out
[1:10:53] there somewhere uh where it says you
[1:10:55] better be glad I'm not your God or you'd
[1:10:57] be dead and burning in Hell before you
[1:10:59] had a chance at Salvation I can still
[1:11:01] remember it you know as if I said it
[1:11:02] yesterday because I I I I'm ashamed to
[1:11:04] have said it but in and but there's a
[1:11:07] truth to it right yeah if we were
[1:11:09] God and not trying to take a I'm not
[1:11:12] trying I don't want you to spin say well
[1:11:13] brother Bram did say that we are him and
[1:11:15] we're amateur Gods I saying if we were
[1:11:18] the self-existing Eternal one as we are
[1:11:21] now in our carnal thinking it would we
[1:11:24] would always be
[1:11:25] alone right God exists Alone by himself
[1:11:29] if we were the impatient Petty people
[1:11:31] that we are at times we would just we
[1:11:33] would people who had a chance at
[1:11:35] Salvation we would have written them off
[1:11:38] and where would some of us be in this
[1:11:39] room today if having been given a chance
[1:11:42] at the message of the yah given a chance
[1:11:43] at truth and given an opportunity to do
[1:11:45] it right and once we had that one chance
[1:11:47] in our if I was your God right and my my
[1:11:51] self-righteousness I'd forget about
[1:11:53] about them you know they had their
[1:11:54] chance usually if there's election there
[1:11:56] they get it that quick and just write
[1:11:57] them off that's true but this is a the
[1:11:59] the longsuffering of Our Lord is
[1:12:01] salvation Hallelujah and I think we
[1:12:03] could all say Amen to
[1:12:05] that notice this in 1 Corinthians
[1:12:08] chapter 13 I don't don't know if I even
[1:12:09] had the scriptures here apologize if my
[1:12:11] slideshow has been a distraction we
[1:12:12] didn't I didn't have time to uh make
[1:12:14] sure it was conducive to your setup here
[1:12:17] but the Bible says charity and 1
[1:12:20] Corinthians 13:4 charity suffereth long
[1:12:22] amen that's the that's the intro charity
[1:12:25] suffereth long and then verse seven
[1:12:28] endureth all
[1:12:29] things the book ends the boundaries for
[1:12:34] perfect
[1:12:34] love is
[1:12:37] patience patience is the beginning and
[1:12:40] the end of love it it's what frames it
[1:12:43] you want to know love love is framed by
[1:12:45] patience you want to know what love is
[1:12:47] if God this is an essential attribute of
[1:12:49] God that he's longsuffering of Our Lord
[1:12:52] he's longsuffering to us where God is
[1:12:53] merciful gracious and longsuffering
[1:12:55] charity suffers long charity endureth
[1:12:59] all things this forms the boundaries of
[1:13:01] Charity's character this is perfect love
[1:13:04] God who is
[1:13:06] love is framed by this attribute
[1:13:10] patience charity suffereth long and
[1:13:13] endureth all things you'll find that
[1:13:15] that word is
[1:13:17] patience so patience is essential are
[1:13:20] you staying with me so far amen you
[1:13:23] about wisdom I didn't even bother to
[1:13:25] look at the clock when I got up here so
[1:13:27] now I can just claim ignorance if I if I
[1:13:30] preach until there's no weights at the
[1:13:32] restaurant but patience is
[1:13:35] essential and the importance of patience
[1:13:38] if you'll just humor me for a moment the
[1:13:41] importance of patience is highlighted by
[1:13:42] its continual emphasis it's continually
[1:13:45] emphasized I don't know how many
[1:13:46] scriptures I've read already this
[1:13:48] morning that have talked about
[1:13:49] longsuffering and enduring and patience
[1:13:51] and patience and patient continuous
[1:13:54] and over and over again we find this
[1:13:55] theme keeps coming up and I I want to
[1:13:58] read a few more scriptures just to see
[1:14:00] that by its continual emphasis it's
[1:14:01] telling us this is important amen the
[1:14:05] purpose of suffering and patience is to
[1:14:06] bring us to Perfection to full maturity
[1:14:09] full reward so we know it's important
[1:14:11] yeah and I know maybe say God give me
[1:14:13] patience but is there a way that I can
[1:14:15] have it without temp suffering there a
[1:14:17] way that I could have it without really
[1:14:19] going through it and Lord just give me
[1:14:21] patience if I need patience to have
[1:14:22] perfect character just give me the
[1:14:23] patience but I don't know if I don't
[1:14:25] know if I need a test right I think it's
[1:14:28] brother Donnie Reagan I heard say it the
[1:14:29] first time a lot of us want a test uh we
[1:14:32] want a testimony but we don't want to
[1:14:33] test because he says test iony right
[1:14:37] that's what happens we start tooning and
[1:14:39] groaning and complaining whenever we're
[1:14:40] test but if you want a testimony it's
[1:14:42] got to be
[1:14:43] testimony in James chapter 5: 7 and 8 be
[1:14:47] patient therefore Brethren under the
[1:14:48] coming of the Lord behold the husbandman
[1:14:51] waiteth for the precious fruit of the
[1:14:52] Earth
[1:14:53] immediately he's going into what it
[1:14:55] means to be patient the husband waited
[1:14:57] for wait for the precious fruit of the
[1:14:59] earth and hath long patience for it
[1:15:01] until he received the early in latter
[1:15:03] rain amen this image of one who the
[1:15:07] husband one who labors and toils he
[1:15:09] prepares the ground he plants the seed
[1:15:12] he nurtures it while it's in the soil
[1:15:14] he's looking out after it and then he's
[1:15:16] looking to the Harvest he knows one day
[1:15:18] I'm going to get the fruit of this and
[1:15:20] he has long patience for it until he
[1:15:22] receives it
[1:15:25] but ye also be ye also patient in this
[1:15:30] like figure be ye also patient establish
[1:15:32] your hearts amen for the coming of the
[1:15:34] Lord draweth
[1:15:35] n and some great instruction Grudge not
[1:15:38] one against another Brethren lest you be
[1:15:40] condemned behold the judge standeth
[1:15:42] before the door amen take my brethren
[1:15:44] the prophets who have spoken in the name
[1:15:45] of the Lord for an example of suffering
[1:15:47] Affliction and of patience now does it
[1:15:51] seem odd that in the middle of talking
[1:15:54] about a husbandman and one
[1:15:56] laboring
[1:15:58] and being patient to the coming of the
[1:16:00] Lord that he says you know don't grudge
[1:16:02] against one another but what is patience
[1:16:05] the regulation of
[1:16:06] passions the ability to control your
[1:16:09] emotions the ability to if I can say
[1:16:11] deprive yourself of the satisfaction of
[1:16:13] a recompense a retribution a responding
[1:16:17] in kind isn't it I it's so easy I just
[1:16:22] uh feeling free today but it's so easy
[1:16:24] anymore to be able to respond in kind
[1:16:28] because you a lot of the lot of the uh
[1:16:31] narcissism we experience or the the
[1:16:33] pettiness or the cattiness comes by way
[1:16:35] of text messages or or digital
[1:16:37] communication right so we can hide
[1:16:39] behind the distance to just give it
[1:16:41] right
[1:16:42] back and Paul is saying be you patient
[1:16:46] establish your hearts don't grudge
[1:16:47] against one
[1:16:48] another and he says look at those who
[1:16:51] are an example of suffer in Affliction
[1:16:53] and of
[1:16:54] patience don't build up grudges don't
[1:16:57] don't be uh uh don't allow your emotions
[1:16:59] to get the better of you and he says
[1:17:00] behold we count them happy which
[1:17:02] endure where's the source of our
[1:17:04] happiness where's the source of our
[1:17:06] contentment not in the easy grabs and
[1:17:08] getting everything that we can but
[1:17:10] enduring we count them happy which
[1:17:13] endured you have heard of the patience
[1:17:14] of Job and have seen the end of the Lord
[1:17:17] if you're not reading it you might think
[1:17:18] I didn't know job was a doctor but youen
[1:17:21] you've heard of the patience of Job and
[1:17:23] have seen the end of the Lord that the
[1:17:26] Lord is very pitiful and of tender Mercy
[1:17:29] just I hope you're recognizing just as
[1:17:31] we read these scriptures uh that there's
[1:17:33] this connection between suffering
[1:17:36] patience and reward enduring and
[1:17:39] affliction and hardship and toil that
[1:17:41] there's this relationship that exists
[1:17:43] with suffering patience and reward amen
[1:17:46] so much of what we have today is
[1:17:49] intended in in a technological sense and
[1:17:53] an evolutionary sense in terms of
[1:17:54] amenities and Comforts are all to
[1:17:57] decrease our
[1:17:59] suffering to make life more comfortable
[1:18:02] to constantly stay entertained and to
[1:18:05] not for God forbid be
[1:18:08] bored he say establish your heart
[1:18:10] strengthen and fix your hearts amen
[1:18:12] render it constant this is patience be
[1:18:15] patient establish your hearts make your
[1:18:17] a patient Heart Makes firm makes stable
[1:18:20] makes constant and steadfast amen so if
[1:18:23] I could kind of I want to turn a little
[1:18:25] bit of a corner here patience is a
[1:18:27] god-given ability to endure to the
[1:18:29] payoff right that's what patience is
[1:18:31] it's the power to stick to something to
[1:18:34] not vary to know that what you're doing
[1:18:37] is in the word of God to know that what
[1:18:38] you're doing is right we're not talking
[1:18:40] about uh beating your head against the
[1:18:42] wall to get rid of a headache we're
[1:18:44] talking about doing what you know is
[1:18:45] right there's a payoff there's a reward
[1:18:47] and and and patience is a god-given
[1:18:49] ability to endure to the payoff I'm
[1:18:50] going a I'm the power to stick to
[1:18:52] something and a a and not vary from it
[1:18:54] because I know that God's going to
[1:18:55] reward me amen Luke 8:15 but that on the
[1:18:58] good ground are they which in an honest
[1:19:00] and good heart having heard the word
[1:19:01] keep it and bring forth fruit with
[1:19:04] patience yes the fruit doesn't come
[1:19:08] overnight it's a process that takes time
[1:19:11] the Nature has to be in the seed and the
[1:19:12] nurture has to be present in its
[1:19:14] environment to take that which is little
[1:19:16] and small and then reproduce the very
[1:19:17] image that it was in in the beginning it
[1:19:19] takes time to do that they that in the
[1:19:21] good ground have an honor and good heart
[1:19:23] but then they keep that word and bring
[1:19:25] forth fruit but they don't bring it
[1:19:27] without
[1:19:28] patience in 2 Timothy 2 verse 9 wherein
[1:19:31] I suffer trouble as an evildoer e even
[1:19:33] unto bonds but the word of God is not
[1:19:36] bound therefore I Endure all things for
[1:19:38] the elect sake that they may also obtain
[1:19:41] the Salvation which is in Christ Jesus
[1:19:43] with eternal glory I'm patient and I
[1:19:46] Endure that others might also obtain
[1:19:50] that's right it is a faithful saying for
[1:19:51] if we be dead with him we shall also
[1:19:53] live with him for if we suffer we shall
[1:19:56] also reign with him if we deny him he
[1:19:59] will also deny us to Reign it means to
[1:20:02] possess Supreme honor uh it means to
[1:20:05] possess Supreme Liberty and blessedness
[1:20:07] amen he saying we will not Reign and
[1:20:09] possess this Glory this honor and
[1:20:11] immortality which he said we ought to in
[1:20:13] well-doing seek for glory honor and
[1:20:15] immortality that we ought to be seeking
[1:20:18] for us that when we suffer we we we're
[1:20:19] conscious of the fact there's a reward
[1:20:21] for this yes
[1:20:23] and it's not we plunge it's not that we
[1:20:25] plunge headlong into suffering for the
[1:20:26] sake that we could be perfected but we
[1:20:28] realize that it's going to come it's
[1:20:30] going to come in its time and then when
[1:20:31] we patiently endure if we suffer we
[1:20:33] shall reign if we suffer we will possess
[1:20:36] Supreme
[1:20:37] honor Liberty and
[1:20:39] blessedness and the suffering here is
[1:20:41] simply being
[1:20:43] patient I can endure all things if we
[1:20:45] suffer it's just waiting on God and
[1:20:47] waiting for god brother Braham said and
[1:20:49] we all have daily opportunities to do
[1:20:51] that amen it's not that we have to wait
[1:20:54] for the World Council churches to come
[1:20:55] kick down these doors and Usher us out
[1:20:58] and confiscate our King James Bibles and
[1:21:00] put bars on the door there's daily
[1:21:02] opportunities for this kind of enduring
[1:21:04] amen daily opportunities to demonstrate
[1:21:07] patience we don't have to be living
[1:21:08] under a Communist Regime we don't have
[1:21:11] to have eight years of Biden to be
[1:21:12] suffering we have daily opportunities to
[1:21:16] endure to wait on God and to wait for
[1:21:19] God God has ordained that things of
[1:21:21] value come at a great price power
[1:21:25] without character
[1:21:26] satanic and honor in this gain that the
[1:21:29] scripture speaks of without suffering
[1:21:31] without enduring or without patience is
[1:21:33] dangerous yes because of our
[1:21:36] Humanity if God just gave us certain
[1:21:39] things now we even think about faith
[1:21:40] operates according to a law that you do
[1:21:43] right now as a born again believer have
[1:21:45] power to go create another world and
[1:21:46] live on
[1:21:47] it and God then has given us the power
[1:21:51] but there's a secret to use in it
[1:21:54] and if we do not have the right kind of
[1:21:56] character to operate power brother B
[1:21:58] says it's satanic
[1:22:01] amen so we need patience it's and and
[1:22:04] the danger doesn't lie in Lucifer
[1:22:06] himself it lies in our
[1:22:08] Humanity we need patience we need
[1:22:11] perseverance we need to be persistent
[1:22:13] and it's a part of God's process for us
[1:22:16] as his
[1:22:17] children if I could say this it's part
[1:22:20] of experiencing his Wonder
[1:22:24] if God gave us all power and God always
[1:22:27] just went before us and took care of
[1:22:28] everything would we really know
[1:22:31] him all this is an aside and and I'm
[1:22:35] sure that you've heard this ministered
[1:22:37] before but had Adam and the woman always
[1:22:40] remained in the garden they really had
[1:22:41] never known who God was other than an an
[1:22:43] architect of a beautiful
[1:22:46] Earth how would have they ever known any
[1:22:48] more about God other than the fact that
[1:22:50] he was a
[1:22:51] Creator and today that's really a lot of
[1:22:53] ways that all people only worship him in
[1:22:56] that he is a
[1:22:57] Creator and that he created all things
[1:23:00] and they worship the creation because
[1:23:01] they believe that the creation by Design
[1:23:03] speaks of the Creator and they're making
[1:23:05] the connection to the one true God but
[1:23:06] their knowledge of God's character and
[1:23:08] his nature doesn't go any further than
[1:23:10] the fact that they just believe that he
[1:23:11] created all things that's true
[1:23:14] amen so part of experienceing his Wonder
[1:23:18] Part of knowing him to a greater degree
[1:23:20] and knowing his nature and character is
[1:23:22] suffering Hallelujah part of really
[1:23:24] knowing him is not just suffering but
[1:23:26] suffering with patience amen Paul writes
[1:23:28] in 2 Corinthians 4:16 17 and 18 for
[1:23:31] which cause we faint
[1:23:32] not but though the out our outward man
[1:23:35] perish yet the inward man is renewed day
[1:23:38] by day for our light Affliction which is
[1:23:41] but for a moment worketh for us a far
[1:23:43] more exceeding and eternal way to Glory
[1:23:46] I I I don't know if you catch what he's
[1:23:47] saying here but he's saying that though
[1:23:49] I'm depriving my desires
[1:23:53] and depriving myself of things that I
[1:23:55] might enjoy In the Flesh I'm being
[1:23:57] strengthened deep inside amen and this
[1:24:00] patience that I'm exhibiting and caus
[1:24:02] which is causing this light Affliction
[1:24:04] it's just for a moment but it works deep
[1:24:06] within me a far more exceeding and
[1:24:08] eternal weight of Glory why we look not
[1:24:10] at the things which are seen but the the
[1:24:12] things which are not seen for the things
[1:24:15] which are seen are temporal but the
[1:24:16] things which are not seen are
[1:24:20] Eternal if I could put it in these words
[1:24:23] maybe it'll make help us to think of in
[1:24:25] more modern
[1:24:26] parlament there's that word again
[1:24:28] parlament isn't even a modern word but
[1:24:29] we're going to use modern
[1:24:31] terminology delayed
[1:24:35] gratification this is exactly what Paul
[1:24:37] is talking about he's talkinging about
[1:24:39] the act of resisting an Impulse a to to
[1:24:43] take something that's immediately
[1:24:44] available that I'm going to resist the
[1:24:48] desire to take an immediately available
[1:24:51] reward in the hope of obtaining a more
[1:24:53] valuable reward in the future amen I
[1:24:56] have the opportunity at $10 right now
[1:24:58] easily grasp I can grab it now or I can
[1:25:02] wait and get $100
[1:25:06] later and Paul is saying I deprived
[1:25:08] myself now and I may suffer now I may go
[1:25:11] without the 10 now and I'm just trying
[1:25:13] to use a language you could understand
[1:25:15] or example maybe some of the even the
[1:25:16] younger ones could understand that
[1:25:18] there's an opportunity available before
[1:25:19] you maybe for the kids understand you
[1:25:22] walk into the kitchen and and there's a
[1:25:24] dessert that's been prepared for dinner
[1:25:25] that night a and you just want to sneak
[1:25:28] a little bite sneak a little little bit
[1:25:29] of a cookie because you're hungry and
[1:25:32] and and to use 2 Corinthians 4 Paul is
[1:25:34] saying I deprived myself of the cookie
[1:25:37] at noon so that I could have four
[1:25:39] cookies after dinner amen that though I
[1:25:43] suffered a little bit in the moment of
[1:25:44] Temptation and I deprived myself I
[1:25:46] realize it's working for me a far more
[1:25:48] exceeding great and eternal reward I'm
[1:25:51] not looking at at the things that are
[1:25:52] seen but I'm looking at the things that
[1:25:54] are not seen these things that are seen
[1:25:55] are temporal but there things which are
[1:25:57] not seen are
[1:25:58] Eternal and it's Paul who draws on this
[1:26:01] in Hebrews 11 where Moses patiently
[1:26:03] endured by refusing the things that were
[1:26:05] present that would cause him pleasure
[1:26:07] for future gain that's what the Bible
[1:26:09] says he he saw him he endured he
[1:26:11] suffered the the the afflictions of that
[1:26:13] present time uh for the honor and Glory
[1:26:15] of Christ amen Moses endured refusing
[1:26:19] immediate enjoyment for the benefit of a
[1:26:23] more eternal enjoyment amen it's even
[1:26:25] Christ who patiently endured as we read
[1:26:27] that in the beginning he endured for the
[1:26:30] reward the future
[1:26:32] reward Moses practiced delayed
[1:26:34] gratification Christ is showing us an
[1:26:37] example of delayed gratification Paul is
[1:26:39] saying that we though our outward men
[1:26:41] may really want it that by by refusing
[1:26:45] to try to satisfy ourselves by resisting
[1:26:47] temptation of immediate pleasure in the
[1:26:49] hopes of a future lasting reward W it
[1:26:52] builds
[1:26:54] character I said earlier that patience
[1:26:56] involves the regulation of emotions
[1:26:58] means you're not quick to indulge in
[1:27:00] something and this
[1:27:02] is uh maybe a large
[1:27:06] thought if we're if we're ministering
[1:27:08] Wednesday night maybe there's more that
[1:27:09] we could say in this vein because
[1:27:10] there's a lot here and I want to try to
[1:27:11] keep going further this is an important
[1:27:14] principle the ability to delay
[1:27:16] gratification the ability to say no to
[1:27:18] the flesh the ability to say no to your
[1:27:20] desires this the ability to delay
[1:27:23] gratification is essential essential to
[1:27:30] self-control and I want to show you a
[1:27:32] few scriptures
[1:27:34] here if you look at Eccles Ecclesiastes
[1:27:36] chapter
[1:27:38] 3 God created us to experience rewards
[1:27:41] after effort like this is God's this is
[1:27:43] God's plan this is how God wanted it he
[1:27:46] he ordained it and this is the way it is
[1:27:49] that we would this is the way we could
[1:27:51] see it in the scripture this is is the
[1:27:52] way this is how God knows we are if I
[1:27:54] could put it that way even that we ought
[1:27:56] to experience a reward after effort
[1:27:59] after discipline after striving after
[1:28:01] applying ourselves after giving that
[1:28:04] when I when I sacrifice when I give when
[1:28:06] I pay when there's something exacted
[1:28:08] from me when I've striven for it the the
[1:28:10] real reward comes when I've given when
[1:28:13] I've paid in Ecclesiastes 3:22 remember
[1:28:16] this is God God knows this is our nature
[1:28:19] wherefore I perceive this is Solomon's
[1:28:22] observance that there is nothing better
[1:28:24] than that a man should rejoice in his
[1:28:26] own works for that is his portion for
[1:28:29] who shall bring him to see what shall be
[1:28:31] after him he says it in uh earlier that
[1:28:34] it's good that a man should make his
[1:28:35] soul enjoy good in his
[1:28:38] labor this is this is God's recognition
[1:28:42] and even God's design for Humanity labor
[1:28:45] comes before rewards amen said it in
[1:28:48] Genesis 3:19 in the sweat of thy brow
[1:28:50] Thou shalt eat bread this is what God's
[1:28:52] saying I know your nature I know how
[1:28:54] you're going to be I know your design
[1:28:56] and your design that it's in the sweat
[1:28:59] of your brow and even in in him bringing
[1:29:00] this curse upon the Earth says you're
[1:29:02] going to labor you're going to fight
[1:29:03] you're going to struggle with the Earth
[1:29:04] but it's going to produce fruit and
[1:29:06] that's going to be precious to you
[1:29:08] you're going to enjoy that when you've
[1:29:09] planted a crop and you've labored with
[1:29:11] it and you've worked and you figured out
[1:29:12] a way to bring forth wheat you figured
[1:29:14] out a way to U turn that wheed into
[1:29:16] bread you're going to feel satisfied in
[1:29:18] what you've
[1:29:19] done this is God's understanding that
[1:29:22] labor effort and exerting yourself
[1:29:24] precedes rewards and even God's
[1:29:27] incentive God's reward comes after Labor
[1:29:30] comes at the end and this provides that
[1:29:34] necessary development of our character
[1:29:36] provides the proper motivation none of
[1:29:39] your parents give your kid a lollipop
[1:29:41] and say here go clean your
[1:29:44] room right maybe we haven't tried it
[1:29:47] maybe we should but we don't give the
[1:29:50] reward at upfront
[1:29:52] because what you're going to find 15
[1:29:53] minutes later did you clean your room
[1:29:57] no what are you going to give me if I
[1:29:59] clean my room well the lollipop was to
[1:30:01] clean your room oh should have thought
[1:30:03] of that before he gave it to me right
[1:30:06] you've up the ante now and God gives us
[1:30:08] the reward we find that the rewards come
[1:30:10] at the end even ultimately the payoff
[1:30:11] comes at the end and God understands
[1:30:14] this is necessary to develop character
[1:30:16] this is necessary to give the right kind
[1:30:18] of motivation amen Ecclesiastes 78
[1:30:20] better is the end of a thing the
[1:30:22] beginning thereof and the patient in
[1:30:24] spirit is better than the proud in
[1:30:26] spirit if you take anything away today
[1:30:28] better to be be patient than arrogant
[1:30:31] amen and we can even see that God
[1:30:33] unfolds this truth in creation God had
[1:30:35] the power to do what create it all like
[1:30:37] that yes he did but he was a process
[1:30:41] where God began and it was very layered
[1:30:43] and it was very meticulous God God it
[1:30:45] took him six days to create
[1:30:48] everything right why did it take him so
[1:30:50] long if he's God God because it's
[1:30:52] showing that God is the god of patience
[1:30:54] he's meticulous amen even even
[1:30:57] demonstrating a day of rest showing that
[1:30:59] this is something that I could have done
[1:31:01] just in a moment but I I I I I he
[1:31:04] unfolds this truth in creation and then
[1:31:06] he unfolds it even in nature we have the
[1:31:09] law of conception and gestation and
[1:31:11] labor and each one has its role and has
[1:31:13] its part and you have you don't just
[1:31:15] have uh flowers that appear in Spring
[1:31:18] but you can go back to a time that the
[1:31:19] seed found its way in the Earth and even
[1:31:22] over a process of rotting through the
[1:31:24] winter and in some seeds even the cold
[1:31:27] the cold climate is necessary to trigger
[1:31:30] that germination so that when the it
[1:31:32] starts warming up it's going to start
[1:31:33] coming back up again God demonstrates
[1:31:36] this in nature he demonstrates it in his
[1:31:37] Char his
[1:31:39] character in other words the process is
[1:31:41] just as important as the
[1:31:43] product patience is a necessary part of
[1:31:46] perfection now here comes uh this comes
[1:31:50] here comes the Turning of the corner
[1:31:52] you're think how many turns do you have
[1:31:54] well I should have thought of that
[1:31:55] before I started using the corner
[1:31:58] analogy if things come too easily I hope
[1:32:02] you're still with me I amen bless the
[1:32:03] lord it's it's after 11:30 does that
[1:32:05] help
[1:32:06] anybody if things come too easily it
[1:32:10] short circuits God's
[1:32:12] process because of the way that he's
[1:32:14] made
[1:32:15] us the way that he knows that we're made
[1:32:19] the way that he knew that we would exist
[1:32:21] and the word speak through this Human
[1:32:22] Condition if things come too easily God
[1:32:25] has a design God has created us to
[1:32:27] experience rewards after
[1:32:29] Labor then if things come too easily and
[1:32:33] we get a reward without the proper labor
[1:32:36] that rewies us it short circuits our
[1:32:38] wiring it changes the way we think and
[1:32:40] changes our
[1:32:41] nature Bible says in Proverbs 20: 21 an
[1:32:44] inheritance may be gotten hastily at the
[1:32:46] beginning but the end thereof shall not
[1:32:49] be
[1:32:50] blessed if an inheritance comes too
[1:32:53] easy right if we just hand hand it to
[1:32:56] somebody well you didn't work for this
[1:32:58] you don't have the character for it you
[1:32:59] don't have the means really to figure
[1:33:01] this out and how to use it an
[1:33:02] inheritance may be gotten quickly wealth
[1:33:04] may be gained quickly you might find a
[1:33:07] way to get rich quick but if you didn't
[1:33:09] work for it are you really going to
[1:33:11] Value it if you didn't labor for it if
[1:33:13] you could find out a way to go and soone
[1:33:15] says hey I can you can make $10,000 in
[1:33:17] 10 minutes just follow me now I'm pretty
[1:33:19] sure that all of us would say maybe
[1:33:21] first how far are we going right who
[1:33:24] who's driving can I keep my phone on can
[1:33:27] I can I turn on find my FindMe
[1:33:31] app we we we might just kind of can I
[1:33:33] call the police
[1:33:34] first now we we'd be willing probably to
[1:33:37] entertain it but you realize if you were
[1:33:38] able to make 10 grand in 10 minutes
[1:33:41] you've probably warped your perception
[1:33:43] of what 10 grand means the value of 10
[1:33:46] grand and you probably play real fast
[1:33:48] and loose thinking I can always make
[1:33:50] another 10 grand 10
[1:33:52] minutes an inheritance may be gained
[1:33:54] quickly but the end is not
[1:33:57] blessed if it comes too easily without
[1:33:59] hard work it's
[1:34:01] wasted and even if you manage to
[1:34:03] maintain it and keep it and bury it in
[1:34:05] the earth and never use it it's been
[1:34:07] wasted because you didn't have the
[1:34:09] character to use it it's saying that
[1:34:11] quick wealth in the end is not a
[1:34:13] blessing right amen Proverbs 28 verse 20
[1:34:16] and then 22 a faithful man shall be
[1:34:18] abound with blessing a faithful man
[1:34:21] shall bound with blessing but he that
[1:34:23] maketh haste to be rich shall not be
[1:34:27] innocent and then it says he that
[1:34:29] hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye and
[1:34:32] consider not that poverty shall come
[1:34:34] upon him a faithful man one that wants
[1:34:37] to do things right versus one who wants
[1:34:39] to get rich quick now this hasn't turned
[1:34:42] into a financial
[1:34:44] seminar but it's the principle of
[1:34:46] rewards right gaining having that trying
[1:34:50] to get rich without patient and testing
[1:34:52] and trial without suffering is evil the
[1:34:54] Bible saying it leads to Poverty it's
[1:34:56] evil to have a lot of power it's evil to
[1:34:58] have a lot of assets it's evil to have
[1:35:00] accumulated a lot of wealth and not have
[1:35:01] the
[1:35:03] character and and and God ordains the
[1:35:05] pressure he ordains the resistance and
[1:35:07] the suffering he de he ordains the
[1:35:09] delayed gratification for a purpose in
[1:35:12] Romans 5 and not only so but we glory in
[1:35:15] Tribulation also knowing that
[1:35:16] tribulation worketh patience impatience
[1:35:19] experience and experience hope hope
[1:35:22] knows how these work together that if I
[1:35:24] have faith then the tribulation gives
[1:35:27] patience a job to do and then patience
[1:35:29] produces experience and having
[1:35:31] experience things it produces hope and
[1:35:33] then hope makes me not ashamed I won't
[1:35:36] be disappointed by the the one who got
[1:35:38] rich quick I won't be like the one who
[1:35:40] hastens to be rich who has an evil eye
[1:35:42] and doesn't realize if you don't have
[1:35:44] the character integrity if this hasn't
[1:35:45] come the proper way God knows this isn't
[1:35:48] good in the
[1:35:49] end and hope makes not a shame shame
[1:35:51] because the love of God is shed abroad
[1:35:52] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[1:35:54] given unto us tribulation there is
[1:35:58] oppression pressure or distress and the
[1:36:02] word their experience is proven
[1:36:04] character tribulation worketh patience
[1:36:07] patience experience tribulation that's
[1:36:10] pressure oppression
[1:36:12] distress and that experience produces
[1:36:15] hope of the patience produces
[1:36:18] experience that Pro tribulation patience
[1:36:20] experience proven
[1:36:22] character God uses a combination of
[1:36:24] pressure can I get a witness amen he
[1:36:27] uses a combination of pressure stress
[1:36:29] and rewards to motivate Behavior yeah
[1:36:31] this is this is the way that God works
[1:36:33] now I may be using a language that some
[1:36:34] of you begin to recognize this is what
[1:36:36] this is what people have recognized is
[1:36:39] this rhythm of pressure reward tension
[1:36:41] release tension release we see it in the
[1:36:44] scripture that tribulation Works
[1:36:45] patience patience experience experience
[1:36:47] hope that God uses pressure in testing
[1:36:51] and these intermittent rewards and
[1:36:53] reinforcements to us to recognize his
[1:36:56] presence is with us the blessings are
[1:36:58] ours and it motivates our Behavior it
[1:37:00] gives us Pro it gives us proven
[1:37:03] experience h a proven character and it
[1:37:05] gives us hope amen he says in Romans 8
[1:37:08] if we hope for that which we see not
[1:37:10] then do we with patience wait for
[1:37:13] it if we don't we we haven't gotten the
[1:37:15] reward if we haven't gotten what we
[1:37:17] wanted then we use patience amen then we
[1:37:20] can partaking the good that we've
[1:37:22] endured patiently for and partaking in
[1:37:25] that good and receiving that good that
[1:37:26] we've endured for that we've waited
[1:37:28] patiently for is for us a glorious
[1:37:31] Delight
[1:37:34] amen is I I don't know if the phrase is
[1:37:37] doesn't the food always taste better
[1:37:38] when you've cooked
[1:37:39] it right maybe it's maybe it's cognitive
[1:37:42] dissonance right I worked hard for this
[1:37:44] this is good but there's something that
[1:37:46] when you when you work for it when you
[1:37:49] achieve it when you do it that that's
[1:37:51] much more rewarding than when rewardful
[1:37:54] much more of a reward you appreciate the
[1:37:56] reward more
[1:37:58] right
[1:38:00] now I'm getting close to closing so you
[1:38:04] need patience right you endure like a
[1:38:08] sermon within a sermon you make it
[1:38:11] through and it ends and you're like oh
[1:38:13] yes he called the musicians up and
[1:38:16] you're just
[1:38:18] like it was worth it
[1:38:24] if I could say this when we talk about
[1:38:27] patience there might be a lot of thought
[1:38:29] I want to be patient I be patience but
[1:38:30] patience is not only a conscious act but
[1:38:32] it's part of an unconscious brain
[1:38:34] process where I'm going to persevere I'm
[1:38:36] going to commit and so there's this
[1:38:38] Consciousness I'm suffering I'm going to
[1:38:40] stick with it I'm suffering I'm going to
[1:38:41] stick with it but there's also this it's
[1:38:43] an there's an unconscious brain process
[1:38:46] that takes place and there's a great
[1:38:47] spiritual type
[1:38:48] here and and now we're just going to
[1:38:50] step in this you could get homeschool
[1:38:51] credit for this the human brain has a
[1:38:55] circuit that runs through the prefrontal
[1:38:57] cortex and the ventral stratum in the in
[1:39:00] the the in the brain there's a c there's
[1:39:02] a wire that runs through it it's a
[1:39:05] neural neural
[1:39:07] network and it monitors your your reward
[1:39:10] center in your brain so there's a wire
[1:39:13] that runs through a part of your brain
[1:39:14] and it's monitoring it's a a network
[1:39:16] that monitors activity and it works like
[1:39:18] a switch and so there's a there's a lot
[1:39:21] here but I just want to put this in here
[1:39:22] because this is a transition I think
[1:39:24] it's going to make a lot of sense to you
[1:39:26] so as we as our brain is wired and
[1:39:28] there's this trigger in there and and
[1:39:31] when things happen you're experiencing
[1:39:32] certain things this neural network is
[1:39:34] waiting for the the reward right it's
[1:39:37] waiting for this there's a switch in
[1:39:39] there waiting and if there's no
[1:39:41] immediate re immediate reward it prompts
[1:39:44] the brain Hold Steady keep waiting stick
[1:39:48] it out there's a reward coming and so
[1:39:51] there's this important trigger that
[1:39:53] we're supposed to have in our minds that
[1:39:55] tells us to be
[1:39:56] patient and the reward comes when it
[1:39:59] comes it comes in the form of
[1:40:01] dopamine and that's the chem this is
[1:40:04] just a chemical process that's behind
[1:40:06] all these different scriptures I've even
[1:40:08] been reading to you that there's this
[1:40:10] chemical release in the brain and it's a
[1:40:12] chemical reward for Success when you've
[1:40:15] achieved something when you've
[1:40:16] accomplished something when you've been
[1:40:17] rewarded there's actually a chemical
[1:40:19] reaction in your brain this is the way
[1:40:20] that we're physically rewire wired and
[1:40:23] it says and you feel this sense of ah
[1:40:27] this is good it's a dopamine release so
[1:40:29] there's these complimentary systems that
[1:40:30] work within our body there's this
[1:40:32] adrenaline a the stress that produces
[1:40:34] adrenaline and then the rewards that
[1:40:36] produces dopamine and that's what causes
[1:40:38] that that wonder that
[1:40:40] excitement that's why that's why some
[1:40:42] songs you really really enjoy it builds
[1:40:44] tension and just even the progression of
[1:40:46] chords it relieves itself and it
[1:40:48] resolves the tension and you really like
[1:40:50] that
[1:40:51] and and a and a good book and even a
[1:40:53] well-written movie it all works with
[1:40:54] building tension and the resolution of
[1:40:57] tension and the reason why these things
[1:40:59] are successful is because that's just
[1:41:00] the way that our bodies work is there's
[1:41:02] tension and then that release that
[1:41:04] dopamine release so there's this
[1:41:06] adrenaline and this dopamine and it
[1:41:07] creates this excitement this
[1:41:10] thrill now the the amazing thing is is
[1:41:13] the right balance is so important I know
[1:41:15] this is dissolved into a
[1:41:18] biological devolved into something else
[1:41:20] but the balance is so
[1:41:23] necessary that if the process of stress
[1:41:26] and reward is how our body that produces
[1:41:29] dopamine and we s we have a sense of
[1:41:32] satisfaction is is it making sense you
[1:41:34] know that I think you know what dopamine
[1:41:36] is maybe most of you and we can this is
[1:41:38] some fod for family devotions later if
[1:41:40] kids have a lot of questions about dope
[1:41:42] but there's this this uh response in our
[1:41:45] minds to these things and this is a
[1:41:47] chemical reaction creates a sense of
[1:41:49] satisfaction or wonder or excitement
[1:41:52] but to produce that in our human bodies
[1:41:55] the balance is necessary that there must
[1:41:57] be
[1:41:58] patience you have to have the stress
[1:42:01] amen and the perseverance Amen in order
[1:42:05] for the the to to truly have a rewarded
[1:42:09] experience you really should think on
[1:42:11] that in terms of this is the way we're
[1:42:13] made this is the way that the Bible
[1:42:14] knows that we're made impatience is not
[1:42:17] only Built through that uh intermittent
[1:42:19] reinforcement delayed Gra ification
[1:42:21] delayed gratification then God blesses
[1:42:22] us God rewards us that's the only way
[1:42:25] that you build fa
[1:42:27] patience that if you have if your brain
[1:42:29] is if your brain is waiting going
[1:42:31] through something and it's waiting for a
[1:42:32] reward and it and it's building tension
[1:42:35] waiting building tension waiting and
[1:42:36] then you get the reward and there's your
[1:42:38] release and you feel good you feel happy
[1:42:40] that's the
[1:42:41] wonder that you have to have
[1:42:45] patience you have to have patience
[1:42:47] because patience well if I can say this
[1:42:50] if you take away the
[1:42:52] patience and there's no delayed
[1:42:54] gratification you never build
[1:42:58] patience because patience is only Built
[1:43:00] through the is only working when you're
[1:43:03] enduring you can't build patience
[1:43:06] through constant
[1:43:07] stimulation you wonder why God doesn't
[1:43:09] always keep us on the Mountaintop right
[1:43:11] why don't we always feel his
[1:43:13] presence why isn't he always just lavish
[1:43:16] lavishing us with with Bountiful
[1:43:18] blessings uh of financial offering and
[1:43:21] new cars and perfect health why is there
[1:43:23] sometimes just the smallest little thing
[1:43:25] that gets to
[1:43:27] us because if we get rewarded too often
[1:43:30] if we don't if there's no stress if
[1:43:32] there's no pressure If we get rewarded
[1:43:34] too often or too frequently then we
[1:43:37] quit when there's no
[1:43:42] reward
[1:43:46] now killing patience can I can I preach
[1:43:49] my sermon today amen my title is killing
[1:43:52] patience killing patience has caused the
[1:43:54] Wonder
[1:43:55] lust that that that constantly seeking
[1:44:00] for a thrill yes seeking for something
[1:44:02] to satisfy it's caused the Wonder lust
[1:44:05] and the Wonder to be lost because the
[1:44:07] world has reverse engineered the process
[1:44:09] that God designed for us for a purpose
[1:44:12] God knows the way that we're wired
[1:44:14] mechanically chemically he knows our
[1:44:16] design and so God deals with us in a way
[1:44:19] to produce character to prod prod
[1:44:20] Integrity God has a way of dealing with
[1:44:22] us in our Human Condition to make
[1:44:24] himself known like our our our faith our
[1:44:28] faith though it may be there is a
[1:44:29] mystery to our faith it becomes very
[1:44:31] practical in our lives and and it has
[1:44:33] place in every single aspect of our life
[1:44:35] because God knows our human condition
[1:44:37] and has framed his word in such a way to
[1:44:39] meet our needs in our human existence
[1:44:42] and and so the word is made to
[1:44:44] understand ourselves the word is made to
[1:44:46] understand the life that we're living in
[1:44:48] the word the word is made so that God
[1:44:50] can be manifested in this
[1:44:52] earth and the world has looked at the
[1:44:54] way that we're made and it's reverse
[1:44:56] engineered this process that God
[1:44:57] designed for his purpose and now we can
[1:45:01] feel success and reward without any
[1:45:05] suffering we can experience the emotions
[1:45:08] of accomplishing something and
[1:45:10] experience the emotions of achieving
[1:45:12] something without any real development
[1:45:14] without any real
[1:45:15] effort and now this is this is where
[1:45:18] it's this is if you've endured to this
[1:45:20] point this is where the payoff comes
[1:45:23] many of the things that we interact with
[1:45:24] on a daily basis manipulate our
[1:45:28] minds and we they call them information
[1:45:30] and communication Technologies from
[1:45:32] laptops to cell phones to tablets to all
[1:45:36] sorts of devices that uh whether they be
[1:45:38] smart whether they be connected The
[1:45:39] Internet of Things whatever it might be
[1:45:42] they've carried with it do you realize
[1:45:44] now you can't even grocery shop without
[1:45:46] providing a rewards
[1:45:49] number right
[1:45:51] and after you've spent all your money
[1:45:52] they want you to get all excited about
[1:45:54] the fact that you you earned 320
[1:45:57] points right never mind you're paying $8
[1:46:00] for a pound of bacon right and twice
[1:46:02] that much for you know eggs unless you
[1:46:04] live on the Martin Manor you get them
[1:46:07] for
[1:46:08] free you got to pay what where's the
[1:46:10] where's the overhead in the scraps have
[1:46:12] we calculated just how much the scraps
[1:46:14] are costing us so we can calculate
[1:46:15] whether or not we're saving money on the
[1:46:17] eggs and all the electricity for the the
[1:46:20] heat lamps we we need to drill down on
[1:46:23] whether or not we're saving money on
[1:46:24] these eggs now that I think about but
[1:46:26] all these systems we have that require
[1:46:30] that uh engage us and and everything if
[1:46:32] I can say everything's been gamified now
[1:46:34] from getting gas to checking in at
[1:46:37] restaurants there's all there there's
[1:46:39] this process of lights and flashing and
[1:46:41] blinking and chainging and rewards
[1:46:44] because these systems want to give us
[1:46:46] this magical effect of
[1:46:48] overcoming this magical fact of you
[1:46:51] saved a hundred bucks today no you spent
[1:46:54] a th to save a 100 right and they want
[1:46:57] you to feel like that's right I did you
[1:47:01] know what I'm not done
[1:47:03] shopping why cuz you want to save a
[1:47:05] hundred bucks and you and you're not
[1:47:07] realizing the whole time the money's
[1:47:09] just going like that all these systems
[1:47:12] are being used to create this this
[1:47:14] feeling of winning overcoming
[1:47:17] accomplishing something but they're
[1:47:18] doing it by bypassing patience I built
[1:47:22] all that up on the patient side so you
[1:47:23] could realize so you could be thinking
[1:47:25] more deeply when we talk about these
[1:47:27] things the games the programs the social
[1:47:29] media interactions all these things they
[1:47:31] can scientifically prove that gaming uh
[1:47:34] uh things that we enjoy on internet a
[1:47:36] lot of the whether it be consumption of
[1:47:37] media and and programming and then even
[1:47:40] especially social media interactions
[1:47:42] whether it be texting or or Whatsapp or
[1:47:44] messenger they increase our dopamine and
[1:47:46] adrenaline in our
[1:47:48] brains it increases it when you get a
[1:47:51] ping there's this
[1:47:54] dopamine there's when you when you when
[1:47:56] you when people follow
[1:47:58] you when you get a response or a comment
[1:48:01] on a post come on somebody don't all be
[1:48:04] shy that's true I know you're all
[1:48:07] influencers you you know how it feels
[1:48:10] right how many people are following you
[1:48:12] and who how many people like that photo
[1:48:14] and whether or not they're checking your
[1:48:15] WhatsApp status there's a dopamine uh
[1:48:18] release and that's why you want to
[1:48:19] revisit it again and now let me just use
[1:48:22] this phrase this is the conclusion from
[1:48:25] a scientific perspective it says your
[1:48:28] brain chemistry is just being fooled
[1:48:30] into thinking you're accomplishing
[1:48:33] something your brain chemistry is being
[1:48:36] tricked you get the sense and the
[1:48:38] feeling of a reward but you've got it
[1:48:41] without paying the price you've got it
[1:48:44] without enduring therefore you don't you
[1:48:47] haven't built patience you haven't
[1:48:49] experienced
[1:48:50] the a concept of waiting for it and you
[1:48:54] get you tricked your brain into thinking
[1:48:56] you've got it so now if we go back and
[1:48:58] think when that happens the next time
[1:49:01] the reward doesn't come fast
[1:49:03] enough you're not going to wait for it
[1:49:05] not scroll I need something else come on
[1:49:08] I need something to make me happy right
[1:49:10] right and all the while patience is
[1:49:12] dying
[1:49:14] right patience is dying the world is
[1:49:17] eroding our patience that's why I called
[1:49:19] it killing patience and with the death
[1:49:22] of impatience impatience is
[1:49:25] born when you kill patience impatience
[1:49:28] is born and that's why our attention
[1:49:31] spans are
[1:49:32] shrinking our capacity to focus is
[1:49:35] getting
[1:49:36] smaller we our ability to endure our
[1:49:40] ability to press you may you may notice
[1:49:42] it in your children maybe you could even
[1:49:44] notice it in yourself that they won't
[1:49:45] stick with something long if it doesn't
[1:49:48] get get their attention and engage them
[1:49:50] and make them happy right
[1:49:52] away there's this constant seeking of a
[1:49:54] high or a stimulation and it's all been
[1:49:57] fabricated and created within our
[1:49:58] thought process of that we're pursuing a
[1:50:02] reward a a sensation and feeling we're
[1:50:05] pursuing the dopamine release this is
[1:50:07] literally what is happening when we grab
[1:50:10] our phones when we play video games when
[1:50:11] we engage in these information and
[1:50:13] communication Technologies we want to
[1:50:15] get this dopamine release and we're
[1:50:17] pursuing it but it's all empty amen the
[1:50:20] levels you achieve in Kingdom Rush the
[1:50:23] crates that you're able to open in zuba
[1:50:27] did I get it right
[1:50:28] kids they they oh wow what did I get and
[1:50:31] who do I you know all these things
[1:50:33] create even in buying uh collecting
[1:50:35] cards you collect cards and you rip open
[1:50:37] the pack do I have a Hol foil one do I
[1:50:40] do I did I get a special insert it
[1:50:42] creates
[1:50:44] this right is really what have you
[1:50:48] done what have you accomplished and it's
[1:50:51] all vanity amen and once you get in that
[1:50:54] cycle this dopamine gets you chasing and
[1:50:57] then you get rewarded for chasing which
[1:50:59] makes you chase more but then you
[1:51:01] realize these things are fabricated yes
[1:51:04] so they've timed it that you're going to
[1:51:05] get rewarded there's there's one in so
[1:51:08] many packs so it's going to come up so
[1:51:09] the more you play it you're eventually
[1:51:11] going to get it as you play these games
[1:51:13] like I beat this level they wanted you
[1:51:15] to beat it cuz they want you to get to
[1:51:17] the next level and pay money so you can
[1:51:20] unlock that weapon to get to the next
[1:51:24] one and then it just becomes an
[1:51:28] addiction becomes
[1:51:31] absentminded amen and then it becomes
[1:51:33] increasingly difficult to stop or
[1:51:35] control why because it's become an
[1:51:37] addiction just like a lot of substance
[1:51:39] abuse the brain the body needs the
[1:51:41] chemical release so it ingests something
[1:51:43] to give that them that experience we
[1:51:45] start reaching for the games the
[1:51:47] internet the movies the videos you name
[1:51:49] it and it's all compul compulsion
[1:51:51] because of a dopamine cycle in our
[1:51:55] brains now the big question how is this
[1:51:58] relevant you know to send the light how
[1:52:00] is this relevant to a Christian
[1:52:03] service by killing
[1:52:05] patience our desire and motivation for
[1:52:08] Christ is
[1:52:10] dying our minds are being conditioned
[1:52:12] for cheap
[1:52:13] rewards our minds are being conditioned
[1:52:15] we're we're becoming addicted to the the
[1:52:17] entertainments and the the passing of
[1:52:20] this world and the even the fact that
[1:52:22] these uh video clips that are a big
[1:52:24] YouTube shorts and Tik Tok they're short
[1:52:27] you can digest them move on right to the
[1:52:28] next one it's capitalizing on that
[1:52:31] system in our minds of I I need the
[1:52:33] payoff I need the payoff I need the hook
[1:52:36] I need the reward and that's why it
[1:52:37] becomes such an addiction and when
[1:52:39] you're in that cycle and you realize
[1:52:42] that God is a god of patience and that
[1:52:44] you you you you know God a certain way
[1:52:47] and you have to feel him a certain way
[1:52:48] and you and you come to know know him
[1:52:50] through trials and testings and his word
[1:52:52] will unfold you to you through faith and
[1:52:54] patience then Christ becomes much less
[1:52:58] desirable to us amen because our minds
[1:53:00] are being conditioned it's like a drug
[1:53:02] addiction and we're applying ourselves
[1:53:04] to empty Pursuits instead of applying
[1:53:06] ourselves to the wonders of Christ amen
[1:53:09] in Philippians 2:5 and 6 let this mind
[1:53:11] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:53:13] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:53:15] not robbery to be equal with God not
[1:53:18] only does it speak to the ality of it
[1:53:20] and the the correctness and the
[1:53:21] righteousness of his equality with God
[1:53:23] but it also means something that was not
[1:53:25] easily
[1:53:26] grasped he thought it not robbery he
[1:53:28] didn't think it was just something he
[1:53:29] could easily acquire if he was going to
[1:53:32] be raised and sit at the right hand of
[1:53:34] the father if he had the hope of glory
[1:53:36] if he for the joy which was set before
[1:53:38] him he knew that the joy couldn't be
[1:53:39] easily grasped he knew the throne wasn't
[1:53:42] easily ascended to he knew that it had
[1:53:44] it couldn't just be acquired hastily as
[1:53:47] an inheritance he knew that it would
[1:53:48] take constant
[1:53:50] steadfastness suffering and
[1:53:53] perseverance and we're too easily
[1:53:55] choosing to enjoy the pleasures of this
[1:53:57] world the pleasures of our mind than to
[1:54:00] patiently endure and that even comes
[1:54:02] just to contemplation prayer meditation
[1:54:05] just flat out being
[1:54:07] bored and letting your mind just sit
[1:54:09] still for a
[1:54:13] while you don't have to be a Christian
[1:54:15] even to recognize the benefits of
[1:54:18] that Genesis
[1:54:21] 15:1 God comes to Abram and he says
[1:54:24] after these things the word of the Lord
[1:54:25] came unto Abram in a vision saying fear
[1:54:27] not Abram I am thy shield and thy
[1:54:31] exceeding great reward that's after
[1:54:33] these things it it wasn't after he
[1:54:36] flipped the
[1:54:37] switch wasn't after he followed the
[1:54:39] right channel on Tik Tok that can give
[1:54:41] us the just the the right kind of
[1:54:43] spiritual Snippets to satisfy the itch
[1:54:45] for something
[1:54:46] religious but it was after these things
[1:54:50] after fighting to rescue his nephew
[1:54:53] lot after turning down The Spoils of
[1:54:56] Sodom it's after a battle and after
[1:54:59] turning down the The Spoils of it after
[1:55:02] turning down what the world offered him
[1:55:04] it was then that God showed up and said
[1:55:07] I'm your reward
[1:55:09] amen the Bible says after he had
[1:55:11] patiently endured Hebrews 6:15 after he
[1:55:13] had patiently endured he obtained the
[1:55:15] promise I believe as I try to draw this
[1:55:18] to the a close Christ just still our
[1:55:20] reward that's right there's still a
[1:55:23] Wonder of Christ that's available to us
[1:55:25] with all the lights and all the fancy of
[1:55:26] Leo deia and all the all the hooks that
[1:55:29] can get into our flesh and my if you're
[1:55:31] a if I could say if you're a baseball
[1:55:33] fan baseball's never been better if
[1:55:35] you're a college football fan right hell
[1:55:37] to the victors right it's just it's
[1:55:39] never been
[1:55:41] better there's there's just certain
[1:55:43] things you can say things are so good I
[1:55:46] and the data that's available to us if
[1:55:48] you if you if you like and investing the
[1:55:50] tools that you have at your disposal are
[1:55:53] endless and there's a lot that could be
[1:55:55] said about the world that can catch our
[1:55:57] attention let's spend some time together
[1:55:59] we find out whether you like to fish we
[1:56:01] find out whether like you H whether you
[1:56:02] like to hunt whether you like this or
[1:56:04] whether you like that there's an endless
[1:56:06] availability of information and
[1:56:08] entertainment in any Endeavor that you
[1:56:10] could constantly and endlessly consume
[1:56:12] because people are endlessly producing
[1:56:14] the content for you to
[1:56:16] consume and it it's some of it we could
[1:56:19] say is in itself is
[1:56:21] harmless that's why the Bible speaks of
[1:56:24] moderation but what's being missed in
[1:56:26] all this is as the world has gr gotten
[1:56:30] greater in its GL its glitter and its
[1:56:33] glow its uh
[1:56:36] flashiness that the the the real Christ
[1:56:39] and the things of Christ we've become
[1:56:41] hijacked our minds have become hijacked
[1:56:44] Christ is still amazing amen yes his
[1:56:46] name hasn't changed his name is still
[1:56:49] called wonderful he's still all
[1:56:52] inspiring he's still is one that can
[1:56:55] thrill our hearts but our minds are
[1:56:57] being hijacked and our brains are being
[1:56:59] hacked to seek after Cheap Thrills
[1:57:03] instead of knowing him amen so how is it
[1:57:06] we can restore our sense of wonder for
[1:57:09] Christ how is it I can shake myself from
[1:57:12] this
[1:57:14] lukewarmness how is it that I could kind
[1:57:15] of rekindle a waning love I I hope that
[1:57:18] this means something
[1:57:19] to all of us today and or least one
[1:57:22] person to realize that my fervency my my
[1:57:24] diligence the the things of God I mean I
[1:57:27] think that we could all brother Johnson
[1:57:29] you could remember when you had to hunt
[1:57:31] for a tape maybe a real toore player to
[1:57:33] listen to The Voice to hear Brother
[1:57:35] brandham there's a time that you had to
[1:57:37] borrow real to reals to hear new
[1:57:40] messages or somebody would travel
[1:57:41] through with the 20th century prophet
[1:57:43] and play the film and you were just in
[1:57:45] awe and there was a scarcity of the
[1:57:48] message of the hour there was a when
[1:57:49] there was fewer tapes and fewer
[1:57:51] availabilities there was a preciousness
[1:57:52] to it and we enjoyed it a lot more when
[1:57:55] we heard it but now we all can have
[1:57:57] access to it like
[1:57:58] that it went from wire reels to Real to
[1:58:02] Reel and it just kept getting smaller
[1:58:04] and smaller and smaller and smaller to
[1:58:05] where then it was put on a thumb drive
[1:58:07] now it's just
[1:58:08] disappeared it doesn't even have
[1:58:10] physical space anymore what happens it's
[1:58:13] it's not as wonderful as it used to
[1:58:16] be the love the passion for it the
[1:58:18] desire for it
[1:58:20] brother Bram asked the question or
[1:58:22] postulate I wonder if we are
[1:58:24] sufficiently impressed with the word
[1:58:26] that's in our
[1:58:28] midst we can begin to restore The Wonder
[1:58:31] of Christ by identifying the influences
[1:58:33] that are numbing our sensitivity to
[1:58:35] God's
[1:58:35] greatness that's where we can start by
[1:58:38] being honest about the fact whether or
[1:58:40] not the word still Thrills us whether or
[1:58:42] not we're still excited about the things
[1:58:44] of God and Christ whether or not we find
[1:58:47] um there's a a joy that comes and
[1:58:49] reading the scripture whether or not
[1:58:51] there's a a pleasure that comes in
[1:58:52] listening to the message of the hour
[1:58:54] whether or not there's a there's an
[1:58:55] excitement about getting together for
[1:58:56] church and special meetings and ways
[1:58:58] that we could help one another there is
[1:59:00] there really uh is there still is is
[1:59:03] there is it there and if you get I think
[1:59:05] it's to menome I I I think it's not
[1:59:07] there like it used to be and I'm not
[1:59:09] excited and thrilled then step back and
[1:59:11] identify the things that are numbing
[1:59:13] your sensitivity to The Wonder of
[1:59:16] Christ maybe some of us are slaves to a
[1:59:18] dopam
[1:59:20] cycle maybe our brain is craving that
[1:59:23] chemical
[1:59:24] release whether it be with a new like or
[1:59:26] comment or achievement level you don't
[1:59:29] have to be a kid to be addicted to
[1:59:32] games every
[1:59:35] notification all these
[1:59:38] things and I'm I am I am kind of putting
[1:59:41] a bullseye on our cell
[1:59:43] phones our operating systems our tablets
[1:59:46] our entertainment systems because what
[1:59:48] it's done is is it's caused our
[1:59:49] attention span to
[1:59:51] shrink and as our attention span has
[1:59:54] shrunk our capacity for God has shrunk
[1:59:56] amen deep thought is more
[1:59:59] difficult and if deep thought is
[2:00:01] difficult deeper experiences are
[2:00:02] difficult amen and we've been reduced to
[2:00:05] Mindless
[2:00:07] Scrolls where there's no end to the
[2:00:10] scroll I think they even call it Doom
[2:00:12] scrolling there's no
[2:00:15] end I this is just my own personal
[2:00:18] testimony uh I it took a while for me to
[2:00:20] figure it out but I I had um some news
[2:00:23] apps and so You' want to every once in a
[2:00:25] while you you you'd open up a news app
[2:00:27] because you just want to find out what
[2:00:28] happened that day it was a day when you
[2:00:30] could read the newspaper right and you'd
[2:00:33] be finished and maybe you'd read the
[2:00:35] whole thing like well we'll wait till
[2:00:37] tomorrow for for another go at this and
[2:00:41] so in my mind kind of have I was raised
[2:00:42] in the newspaper
[2:00:44] generation and so there was uh you know
[2:00:47] you just kind of had this sense you got
[2:00:48] the news and you moved on and it's
[2:00:51] developed certainly over time for me but
[2:00:53] I would check open the app to check the
[2:00:54] news you want to scroll through and get
[2:00:56] the news it never stopped
[2:00:59] scrolling honestly it never stopped
[2:01:03] scrolling it never stopped updating it
[2:01:07] never stopped realizing H he's
[2:01:09] interested in this so as soon as you
[2:01:11] click on that there's another one that's
[2:01:12] going to follow right behind it when you
[2:01:13] go back and so there's this and it's
[2:01:16] it's done like that on purpose that's
[2:01:19] right there even even when it comes to
[2:01:21] technology and white papers and sources
[2:01:23] of information not even entertainment or
[2:01:25] news I know the developers who are
[2:01:27] developing in the platforms for
[2:01:29] technical
[2:01:31] information shout out to the developers
[2:01:33] developers developers who are doing
[2:01:34] these things in order to create endless
[2:01:38] scroll even when it comes to the
[2:01:40] technical data that you need to solve a
[2:01:42] problem with complex systems they don't
[2:01:45] want you to leave their
[2:01:46] ecosystem they want you to stay online
[2:01:49] they want you to stay engaged even
[2:01:50] Facebook Instagram they're all designed
[2:01:53] for the purpose of trying to keep you on
[2:01:55] the
[2:01:56] platform so they've been purposely made
[2:02:00] addictive what is a Mindless
[2:02:03] scroll what is some of the things we put
[2:02:05] all of our time and E effort into
[2:02:09] meaningless you can't you can't take
[2:02:12] that uh belt you won in that game and
[2:02:15] cash it in for anything it's a wonder
[2:02:18] lust
[2:02:19] and all it's done has robbed us of our
[2:02:21] Wonder of
[2:02:23] Christ we're trying to satisfy a thirst
[2:02:26] for God and a thirst for his Wonder with
[2:02:29] all the Cheap Thrills the world gives us
[2:02:31] amen and I can testify I guess maybe I'm
[2:02:33] not as young as I used to be and so
[2:02:35] maybe I lose some credibility but
[2:02:36] nothing Thrills me like Christ amen
[2:02:39] that's my testimony after nearly 30 50
[2:02:41] Years of Living 20s something years of
[2:02:43] serving God there's still nothing that
[2:02:46] does more for me than Christ and there's
[2:02:49] a lot of Glamour in the world a lot of
[2:02:51] glitter a lot of shine a lot of things
[2:02:53] to kind of get our attention but the
[2:02:56] glow of Christ the preciousness of
[2:02:58] Christ the love of Christ is the only
[2:03:00] thing that satisfies and with every
[2:03:03] single person who's in here today
[2:03:04] there's an innate thirst for God all of
[2:03:07] us we're created with a hunger for God
[2:03:10] and what the world has done is taken the
[2:03:12] system that God knew we were made and
[2:03:13] wired with and the way that God works
[2:03:15] with us and relates with us and you and
[2:03:18] makes himself known doing that to
[2:03:19] produce character to grow us into His
[2:03:22] Image the world has taken that and
[2:03:24] hijacked it given us Cheap Thrills and
[2:03:26] sensitizing our minds and rewiring our
[2:03:29] thoughts and the process all because
[2:03:31] we're made with the hunger and the
[2:03:34] world's using that hunger against us I
[2:03:37] believe it may be in Christ as the
[2:03:38] mystery God revealed he says why do you
[2:03:39] hunger Church why do you thirst he says
[2:03:42] it's the father trying to reveal these
[2:03:43] hidden things to you these hidden
[2:03:45] secrets to you he says but you let so
[2:03:48] many things things get that out of you
[2:03:50] amen you let so many other things hijack
[2:03:53] your
[2:03:56] thirst I believe the Wonder of Christ
[2:03:58] can be restored to us amen if it doesn't
[2:04:01] throw you like it used to even going to
[2:04:03] church if it doesn't throw you like you
[2:04:04] used to fellowship with the Believers
[2:04:06] doesn't thrill you like you used to
[2:04:08] there's a lot of other things you'd
[2:04:09] rather do and spend your time doing
[2:04:11] unlike it used to be before find the
[2:04:14] things that are numbing
[2:04:16] you find the things
[2:04:19] that are
[2:04:20] numbing that that are kind of dolling
[2:04:22] your senses to how wonderful Christ
[2:04:26] is Revelations chapter 2
[2:04:29] verse4 if you could just focus with me
[2:04:31] sister an I don't have any more slides
[2:04:33] there but I'm I want to close here and I
[2:04:36] I want you just to really focus in this
[2:04:37] it says nevertheless I have somewhat
[2:04:39] against thee because thou has left thy
[2:04:41] First
[2:04:42] Love what a
[2:04:44] statement thou Hast left forsaken left
[2:04:48] dine
[2:04:49] your first love it's Chief first in
[2:04:53] influence the first in influence the
[2:04:54] thing that influenced you first you've
[2:04:57] left it and to love it's to welcome to
[2:05:00] entertain to love dearly to be pleased
[2:05:03] or contented
[2:05:04] with so it says you've lost or you've
[2:05:07] left your first love it's a lost
[2:05:10] love it's a passion or a feeling that's
[2:05:12] dying out I I have somewhat against you
[2:05:15] you've left your first love
[2:05:20] you've left it dying the thing that used
[2:05:21] to the influence the thing that you
[2:05:24] loved dearly you were happy with you
[2:05:25] were thrilled by now it's
[2:05:28] dying that
[2:05:31] passion and if I could say this the love
[2:05:33] is
[2:05:34] there it's just not being
[2:05:37] nourished if you're a son or daughter of
[2:05:39] God the love for the word is always
[2:05:40] there just not being nurtured the things
[2:05:43] of God still mean something to you it's
[2:05:45] just the flesh you got too much out
[2:05:46] front there's too much going on in your
[2:05:48] head
[2:05:49] all it takes is difficulty sometime
[2:05:50] where you get stressed out and something
[2:05:52] happens so maybe using a different
[2:05:54] example than being addicted to something
[2:05:55] or all the social media the way that
[2:05:57] that's got our dopamine Minds working
[2:05:59] but there could be something just
[2:06:00] happening in the midst of a Calamity and
[2:06:01] a stress you get all worked up and
[2:06:03] you're just in your
[2:06:04] mind and you forgot oh wait a minute
[2:06:07] whatsoever time I am afraid trust in him
[2:06:10] amen so it's not it's not always maybe
[2:06:12] just something calculated coming out of
[2:06:13] Leo dea it's just our own turmo and our
[2:06:16] mixture so the love is still there the
[2:06:18] desire is still there the faith is still
[2:06:20] there it's just not being nourished and
[2:06:22] no matter how real and how strong that
[2:06:24] love is if it's not nurtured it'll
[2:06:25] weaken and lose
[2:06:27] power amen Even in our marriages no
[2:06:30] matter how real the love is if it's not
[2:06:32] nurtured it'll weaken no matter how real
[2:06:35] it might be and strong it may be it
[2:06:36] loses power if it's not
[2:06:38] nurtured Jesus said and because iniquity
[2:06:40] shall abound the love of many shall wax
[2:06:42] cold thou Hast left thy first
[2:06:46] love love is waxing cold because of
[2:06:49] iniquity iniquity is the deviation from
[2:06:53] what is right what is
[2:06:56] virtuous if I could just say iniquity is
[2:07:01] Wonder
[2:07:02] lust just to wander away from the true
[2:07:04] path and that's what causes the cooling
[2:07:08] of
[2:07:10] love we could just bow our heads for a
[2:07:13] moment I'd like to read this statement
[2:07:16] I've got a statement in scripture but I
[2:07:17] wanted the heads bow just so we could be
[2:07:19] pondering this he said what's the matter
[2:07:22] at the
[2:07:23] Tabernacle I don't know that there's
[2:07:25] anything wrong with here it send the
[2:07:27] light but if you could look at yourself
[2:07:28] as being a temple of the Holy Ghost you
[2:07:31] could think very deeply about this he
[2:07:33] said a man ought to be able to say when
[2:07:34] you meet a
[2:07:36] man is your Christian
[2:07:39] experiences if I can say this in your
[2:07:41] Christian experience when was it the
[2:07:43] dearest to
[2:07:45] you brother B says you ought to be able
[2:07:48] to say right
[2:07:50] now well my best experience was back
[2:07:52] when I first got the baptism of the Holy
[2:07:54] Ghost when I come just say oh brother
[2:07:56] You' fallen from Grace that's right left
[2:08:00] your first
[2:08:02] love showing that they had something in
[2:08:05] the
[2:08:05] beginning and has left
[2:08:09] it could I ask the same
[2:08:11] today in your Christian Life when was
[2:08:14] the most dear
[2:08:15] time in your Christian experience what
[2:08:18] moment was the dearest to you and
[2:08:21] brother bram's implying that if you
[2:08:22] can't say right now then maybe you've
[2:08:24] left your first
[2:08:27] love maybe something you had in the
[2:08:29] beginning something you had at one time
[2:08:32] you've
[2:08:35] left so he says nevertheless I have
[2:08:37] somewhat against thee this is this
[2:08:39] Proclamation Revelations thou Hast left
[2:08:41] thy first love so he says remember
[2:08:43] therefore from whence Thou Art
[2:08:44] fallen and repent and do the first work
[2:08:49] works and what were the things that he
[2:08:51] identified at the very beginning of
[2:08:53] verse two I Know Thy Works thy labor and
[2:08:56] thy
[2:08:57] patience I believe we could pray today
[2:09:00] Lord give me
[2:09:01] patience I say this to all of us whether
[2:09:04] we be young families or the veterans I I
[2:09:06] just look out on and see veteran
[2:09:11] Believers regardless of where you might
[2:09:13] be
[2:09:14] today if you feel there's anything
[2:09:17] missing and maybe you've been killing
[2:09:20] patience you'd have a desire to
[2:09:24] repent and do the first works I just I
[2:09:27] give an invitation to stand and just say
[2:09:29] Lord I want to revive patience
[2:09:33] yes I want to identify those things that
[2:09:37] are numbing we invite the musicians to
[2:09:38] come I want to in I want to identify
[2:09:41] those things that are keeping me from
[2:09:45] pursuing you keeping me from looking for
[2:09:48] for your wonder the things that are
[2:09:50] keeping me
[2:09:51] from being excited about spiritual
[2:09:55] things the simple
[2:09:58] things the systems today as you're all
[2:10:01] have stood I believe just this is
[2:10:02] unanimous we're all in one mind in one
[2:10:04] Accord today unanimous unanimously
[2:10:07] standing saying Lord my heart's
[2:10:12] desire is to be awakened to your Wonder
[2:10:15] more not that you haven't seen it not
[2:10:17] that he hasn't made him self known but
[2:10:19] that I can know you
[2:10:23] more the systems today are so
[2:10:26] intricate our devices are so
[2:10:29] flashy there's so much glow glitter out
[2:10:34] there the Billboards are electric
[2:10:38] now everything demanding our
[2:10:45] attention they're certainly not simple
[2:10:49] it's
[2:10:50] complicated it's vast it's enormous it's
[2:10:54] endless and yet Christ is just simple
[2:10:57] he's still simple yes and that's where
[2:10:59] he hides
[2:11:00] himself and Satan's Eden has been
[2:11:02] designed to try to work on your Humanity
[2:11:04] to get you to be chasing after all that
[2:11:07] Glitters and all that shines that's what
[2:11:10] Babylon looks like when it's she's
[2:11:13] described is
[2:11:15] enticing until the word actually pulls
[2:11:17] back the curtain and we see all the foul
[2:11:18] wicked things underneath on the outside
[2:11:20] it's bells and whistles and rewards and
[2:11:23] Merchants and amenities and pearls and
[2:11:25] linens and all sort like we can have
[2:11:27] everything we
[2:11:29] want and then there's Christ the
[2:11:31] simple adorned in the word
[2:11:34] Christ let's get back to the Simplicity
[2:11:37] of
[2:11:39] Christ let's pray Heavenly
[2:11:42] Father Lord today has been uh this
[2:11:47] sermon has been lengthy
[2:11:49] Lord I've challenged the people to
[2:11:51] exercise patience even in processing the
[2:11:54] things that we
[2:11:56] preached but Lord I felt that there was
[2:11:59] enough breath there that we could share
[2:12:02] and
[2:12:04] express that if there could just be a a
[2:12:07] a kind of a kicker at the
[2:12:10] end and that if anyone could SE relate
[2:12:13] in their own personal experience to
[2:12:15] how uh certain
[2:12:18] behaviors and hobbies and
[2:12:22] Recreations and and the internet of
[2:12:25] things and devices and the availability
[2:12:27] of information and communication
[2:12:30] Technologies how that has worked on our
[2:12:34] lives to
[2:12:36] create an addiction soft as it may be
[2:12:40] and unseen as it may be Lord we're we're
[2:12:42] tied more to the entertainments the
[2:12:44] sports the movies the Fashions the music
[2:12:49] and all the things that feed our
[2:12:51] Spirits it's having the first place and
[2:12:53] that's how we leave our first love is
[2:12:55] it's no longer the primary
[2:12:58] influence Lord as I read in that
[2:13:00] scripture it says go back and do the
[2:13:02] first Works Lord I want to go back to
[2:13:04] persevering I want to go back to being
[2:13:06] patient yes Lord I want to go back to
[2:13:09] knowing that you'll reward me that if I
[2:13:11] say no to certain things in the moment
[2:13:13] if I give myself to silent contemplation
[2:13:16] if I give myself to prayer if I give
[2:13:18] myself to say no to movies give myself
[2:13:20] to say no to YouTube give myself to say
[2:13:21] no to certain things a a a and the games
[2:13:24] and all the social Med if I if I say no
[2:13:27] to
[2:13:28] it that there'll actually be a healing
[2:13:30] that will take place in my mind it'll
[2:13:33] actually become a greater uh a a crust
[2:13:35] will begin to be taken away to where now
[2:13:38] your word has more ability to move
[2:13:40] freely in the rest of my
[2:13:42] mind and I can be restored to The Wonder
[2:13:44] of Christ that's my prayer for us today
[2:13:48] in whatever manner you would choose to
[2:13:50] deal with the people's Heart Lord I I I
[2:13:52] want you to deal with their hearts that
[2:13:54] they could come to know you more as
[2:13:57] wonderful I commit the people to you
[2:13:59] Lord bless this church beautiful
[2:14:02] Sanctuary Lord beautiful building but an
[2:14:04] even more beautiful character in The
[2:14:06] People Lord I pray that you bless them
[2:14:09] abundantly through what they've endured
[2:14:10] and what they've gone through for what
