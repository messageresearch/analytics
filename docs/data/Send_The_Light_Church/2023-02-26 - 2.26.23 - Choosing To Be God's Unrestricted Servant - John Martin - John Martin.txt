worthy to be praised he wants it so bad that he'll make even the rocks I don't want anything to take my place I don't even want another person to take my place I just want to do my part because he's been so good to us think about it he chose us out of a million people to be alive and then he brought us out of the world he showed us His Marvelous Light and he gave us the choice to walk in it and he put something inside of us to walk in it and by the grace of God we're here today because of him amen so he's he's worthy to be praised each and every day God bless you if you turn with me to the Book of Joshua chapter 24 I believe God's Gonna bless the reading of his word because we asked him to it and before we go to eat food we pray for the food before we eat spiritual food we should pray that we that God would break it to us and let it be what we have need of today we're certainly uh in prayer for the many needs that we're having and there's still a couple people Brother Bruce and citrogenia without power but they're both doing fine and uh for those that have been sick uh the Chanel family seeing those requests let's just we're believing that God is going to see us through we don't understand why we go through what we go through but we do know that God is in control amen Joshua chapter 24 stream with verse number 14 I trust you have your Bibles with you today now therefore fear the lord and serve them with sincerity and truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and for it if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you are serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amberites and whose Lane you dwell but as for me my house we will serve the Lord and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods notice the topic was we're serving the lord but to forsake current situation for the Lord Our God he it is that brought us up out of the uh brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sights and preserved Us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed and the Lord drave out from before us all the people even the amberites which throughout the land there for will we also serve the Lord he is our God now look at it sounds like a you know the people have made their decision here what's going to happen and and Joshua said unto the people you cannot serve the Lord for he is a holy God he is a jealous God he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if you forsake the Lord and was serve strange Gods then he will turn and do your hurt and consume you after that you have after he have done you good and the people said unto Joshua nay but we will serve the Lord and Joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen you to uh that you have chosen you the Lord to serve him and they said we Are Witnesses now therefore put away said he the strange God's which are presently among you and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel and the people said unto Joshua the Lord Our God we will We Serve and his voice will we obey amen God bless you may be seated I want to take our our thought from verse 15 and if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve now this is a very common scripture we've read it before we've spoke on it before but I want to take a little different thought today uh people enjoy exercising their rights on what they're going to do what they're going to do who they're going to serve and I watch people exercise their rights and restaurants we've all have we've seen those people who are just I ordered this I demanded this how come this hasn't come and they like to exercise their rights I've seen it in Banks I've seen it at work I've seen it in department stores uh I you know this is not what I ordered on Amazon I have a right so people like to exercise their rights brother Brandon said in the message laodicean churches he says notice the name laodicea it means the people's rights the age that we're living in or Justice of the people was there ever an age like the 20th century Church age that has seen all the nations rise up in demanding equality and social and financial just demanding equal I mean we've got men that are demanding that they'd not be called men that they want to be called a transgender and we've got women the same way and they got a right to and the the gays are pushing their rights the the different nationalities are pushing their rights and it's the age that we're living and we see it coming to a head everyone wants to exercise their rights Lucifer got a third of the angels to exercise their rights remember God didn't annihilate them right there because they made a decision to go and do their own will they they the three more agency and they went right and and and and and uh our rights is a scary thing I've seen Christians wanting to exercise their rights I don't have to do that I shouldn't have to do that don't tell me are you with me no I'll say just let's you're going to probably hear some things you don't want to hear this morning but just say like this be like the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost says Amen to every word of God now if it ain't in the word you don't have to say Amen but it fits in there just just agree with the Holy Ghost because it does say Amen to every word of God Believers seem to be so restricted on what they want to do for God like restrictions what they want to do for God's house how they're going to serve when they're going to come to church and what they're going to do for so and so I view them as restricted believers in other words they have rights and they're going to exercise them brother Brian amen okay you're already starting to slip on me brother Brandon said in the message the working of the Holy Spirit he says you know a lamb is an odd animal Atlanta's got its own woe it's got its god-given rights but is willing to lay upon a block and not kick if you've never seen sheer any sheep he says I have but I'll I'll it'll let everything be shaved off of it give its rights and forfeit because it's Meek and it's gentle he says are you ready to lay down and give all your rights you say well now look Mr Brandon I got a right to get back he done something to me and I just got a right to to brawl him out but are you ready to shave off and forfeit them rights oh I'll tell you when I ought to do that may be so but are you ready to shave off God wants Lambs that are willing to be shaved off and become creatures of God see he determines whether or not we're where we need to be and and honestly we come here to the house of God to find out if where we're at is where we should be and that's the beauty of the word because if we want to know God will show us but if we want to exercise our rights then that's a different story I'd like to title this message choosing to be God's unrestricted servant last service we try to encourage the Saints about be not weary and well doing the Bible says for in due season we shall reap if we faint not and this is not a part two but I want to for a subject today talk about making yourself a servant amen making yourself a servant now in this great hour that we're living it's a dark hour we're living in the Bible says there would be a falling away there are many believers who have chosen not to believe like they used to believe they've chosen not to serve like they used to serve and there are many that are struggling today with their commitments that they've that they want to make they're afraid to make they're afraid they can't keep them and they've lost their Joy they've lost their strength they've lost their power to serve like they once did and and they've replaced it and many of them were just a form of godliness or religiousness about their demeanor and how they talk serving the lord is a choice as we all know but how we serve God is totally different than just choosing to serve God because so many people say they're serving God but how they're serving God is totally different so we can choose to serve God as lot did or we can choose to serve God as Abraham did amen and brother Brian says it took a hundred lots to make one Abraham they're both serving right you can choose the well-watered planes of of of uh of Jordan towards Sodom you can pitch your tent towards the things that are comfortable in this life or you can choose to share all those rights away and just stay strictly with the word and it's a choice that we have every day it's not a choice that we just make once and it's over with amen it's chosen every day we can choose to serve God and serve ourselves at the same time or we can choose to serve God Alone there's a difference we can say we've chosen to serve the Lord but how we choose to serve him is a totally different thing we may not think much about God what he really requires of us as his subjects in how we serve him as long as we you know do this and this and this as long as we pay our tithes as long as we fill in the blank and then so we must be serving God if we're doing that I believe God requires a total sellout now it doesn't mean you have to totally sell out you have a choice in the matter I'm only saying that if you choose to serve God acceptably in his sight it requires a total sellout amen now I'm telling you um we're all struggling to be that if you're not you're not being honest because this flesh doesn't want to die out on a daily basis now Joshua 24 verse 14 says now therefore fear the lord and serve him look at this in sincerity boy that I mean how many is that going to knock out right there and in truth and put away the Gods which your father served on the other side of the flood in Egypt and serve ye the Lord now I can tell you I put away some of the Gods that my father served but I know that the devil is trying to constantly get me interested in other gods amen every billboard every time you open your phone you got I didn't ask for these advertisements I was looking for something else and Joshua's verse 19 Joshua said unto the people you cannot serve the Lord for his holy for he is a holy for he is and holy God and he is a jealous God he's not going to allow the devil to be in the same room down here with him are you with me he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins if he forsake the Lord and serve strange Gods then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that you have done you go so here's a god a loving God that we have a scripture here that he's actually going to do us hurt I mean how many times have we wondered why we're going through what we're going through why is this happening and then we question Lord did I miss you somewhere it's time to turn over rocks if I could say it like this it's time to do a checkup instead of being proud and assuming that all that we're doing is okay and always everything we're doing is working out for the good and all the devil has a way of getting in there and then camouflaging himself and we don't know what's happening God is able to do us hurt and he's able the Bible says to make all grace abound unto us Amen Brother John what do we do what do we do to get that Grace to always abound with us I say let this stay humble stay humble keep serving the Lord with all your heart don't let other things creep in the way in order to do that you've got to do constant checkups he giveth more grace to the humble If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves I will hear from heaven and I will heal their land my people so these people as we read here in Joshua can have Satan is presenting opportunities all the time that we could just kind of slip back and serve ourself when you serve yourself you're serving strange God Amen that's the truth it doesn't necessarily have to be that thing on the TV or that one hobby that you're spending more time with than you are with God it just it's all about you can become a God I was a God I know when I first before I came to Christ I mean I had I was into all the things that I was doing and I I was God I made my decisions I had to Forfeit that if I really wanted to get saved I had to repent I had to Forfeit but since then the devil gets Morse you know he he uses ways to trick us to get back the Bible says but a humble and contrite heart why not despise so I say stay humble we were born to serve the Lord and only the Lord when we serve ourselves sometimes we're out let's take a look at this Rich Young Ruler he had a choice to serve the Lord in fact the Bible tells us that he had observed the Commandments from his youth but when he when he came to wanting more truth to walk in further truth and we know the Lord was a jealous God that's what what God told the children of Israel there and Joshua that he's a jealous God and and Jesus said well you've got to go sell everything you have and go give it to the poor and then you come and follow me because there was something standing in the way right and we take this lightly but we shouldn't because don't you think that God that the devil doesn't come to us and present to us strange gods here was a man that was serving the lord and the devil got in there and this thing was so tight to him that he was unwilling to give it up and put God to sell out Lock Stock and Barrel right in the message the world is falling apart brother Ryan says don't come God don't come to your terms you come to his terms or you don't come at all you notice Jesus never said to the Rich Young Ruler you know what let's just reason this thing together I need you as a disciple in the church I really need you in the ministry because you know there's a lot of things to do and if you could just come and just be a little bit more faded just to give a little bit more in the offering then you know then you can follow me doesn't that sound like Satan but here's the thing this is all about our heart in God that's why we're here today that's why we come every service it's about our relationship with God it's not about gaining knowledge it's not doing it's not about even doing our due diligence you know brother Brandon makes a strong statement that we can never leave service the way we came we're either closer or further away now how many times we ever walk out of our service and say I know I'm further away from God because we don't want to think like that but by rejecting the word you automatically get further away so we don't want to reject the word amen now remember we all have a choice to serve God in any way we want to but if you want to serve God in the way that pleases him then you have to come to his terms right you can't do it on our own terms we must sell out everything to serve him now I'm not saying that we need to put all the money into the box back there that's not what I am saying but what I am saying is I do know the God that I serve has a voice amen and his sheep know his voice and he speaks to his sheep and if we just follow what he says everything's going to work out in our lives Romans chapter 12 verse 1 says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your body a Living Sacrifice holy there's that word again acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service well it's a much different definition than what most people would Define uh Christianity here and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God to serve God acceptably to serve God according to his perfect will we must forsake ourself our plans our goals our desires everything that we want that is outside of God we must forsake and present ourselves as an unrestricted servant of God Amen amen and the Bible tells us that's the reasonable service in other words that is what God requires it it may not be what churches require it may not be what a husband and a wife require it may not be what our mom and dad require it may not be what our close friends require other brothers and sisters in their church but it is what God requires our nature is to get by with the least amount of work as possible that's the nature we're born with Brethren said in the message the resurrection of Lazarus he says you've got to approach God in the right way you can't come and say now Laura looky here I've been a pretty good fella I get some hand-me-downs you know but I tell you uh I I want you to take me tonight and say no no brother bran says you don't take it like that you come to God you you come God's provided way or you don't come at all that's right that's true so so in in the midst of every time we go to God in prayer and every time we're seeking them for something and every time we come to church we want a closer walk you know there's a right way to approach him is you can't approach him here with your rights we have no rights in our flesh no Esther was married to the king but she still approached the king if it be pleasing in your sight see the difference even though we're married to Jesus Christ we still need to have an attitude of humility we have to we can't always come and demand numbers this is right I I understand that sometimes we need to take the name of Jesus and take control of situations and God has given us that right but to go ahead and try to exercise that right without humility before Christ is only using God because God be above that above those rights God wants a relationship with you of humility you're constantly in that place of an unrestricted servant Lord whatever you want me to do I'm willing to do we have chosen to serve the Lord all of us hear it but how we choose to serve the Lord is really what's going to make the difference with all of us he wants us all in that's it all in if you can say I'm all into Christ you should be able to just enjoy saying Amen to the service but if you're struggling about being all in then let God speak to you about getting all in in the message time tested Memorials of God he said in you businessmen if you don't if you just do a patch up job see what I mean just a halfway job don't do that he says if you can't do it right then don't do it at all can you say Amen to that anybody want anybody want somebody coming over your house and doing a patch up job oh that's why we got brother Stan here because he's not a patch up job man he's all in he's all in and this he's so much in this is how much he's in he'll go ahead and he'll lose money on a job to make sure it turns out right amen amen and there's another brother the same way and that's the way to be if you don't get what you want out of it you're still going to do it amen so brother Brandon says when you come to Christ if you can't absolutely sell out Lock Stock and Barrel and come to Christ he said don't come at all wow here's the god that wants you to come to him but he's also saying don't come if you're not going to come with all your heart if you're just going to come what part all you're going to do is just make have it for your life but when you really want to be a Christian Stand Out make it real that's what God wants you to be and that'll prove your Works will prove what your character is and your character is known by your works that you do I love that scripture the only way that you and I are going to absolutely sell out Lock Stock and Barrel is to love him with all of our heart that's the only way because you're you're just not going to sell out if you're not in love with him God's true intention for saving us was to serve him acceptably that was what was behind God's motive when he saved us to begin with is that we would serve him acceptedly but we can see that there's a choice that we make every day how many people has God saved and then afterwards destroyed them right that's true he said I'll bring you to remembrance after I saved the people out of the land of Egypt I destroyed them that believed not so it is very easy for us to start out with Christ and through the process drop off it's a real thing there's real spirits and uh we need to be careful about what Spirits we're entertaining we don't want to start serving or bringing in a strange God we we understand that God can do us hurt and and all we have to do this is it can be as simple as this God asks you to do one thing just one thing and you say no not right now that's it all sudden a strange God is before him and he's a jealous God and then things can start to go sideways God's intention of freeing the children of Israel from bondage that they were in in Egypt was that they would serve him acceptably can you say Amen to that I'm just we're not going to turn to them all but it wasn't just a freedom from bondage but it was so that they would serve him and you can find that Nexus 8 1 8 20 9 1 and 9 13. I just want to read 10-3 right now and Moses and Aaron came came in unto pharaoh and said unto him thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews how long will thou refuse to Humble thyself before me Let My People Go that they may serve me now while you're reading this brother John I'm reading this because so often we think God has set us free that we can just do whatever we want to do and that's not why he's set us free and even in Exodus 7 16 he says that they may serve me in the wilderness which we know they failed to do they complain they murmured they kept oh it would be better if I was back in Egypt I mean come on so God expects us even to serve him in the middle of our trials that we're going through because that's what the Wilderness experience was God was proving them and they proved not to be faithful to the Lord God never intended us to set us free from everything just so we could have the freedom to serve ourselves and to do what we want to do and I see so many so many Believers doing that even after God sets us free we still have a choice who we're going to continue to serve are we going to serve ourselves are we going to serve God and the book called the Bible here in uh II Timothy you can find out that Paul talks about perilous times that there would be in the church today and that the actual Believers would be be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God so they have they have mixed in strange Gods right in the church in other words they they're not up here preaching hey let's serve ourselves they're not doing that what they're doing is they're coming into the church with that mentality when the word is being preached and they say I don't have to change that's what's happening that's why it's Peerless times and then the Believers mixed with the make-believers and they grow friendships together and before you know it their friendships become more powerful than the word of God being preached and I'm speaking the truth I'm speaking the truth we need to just love the word more than anything else in the world that is the only way that we're going to be kept from these perilous times that we're living in we don't want to choose to serve strange odds no wonder Jesus said in the last age he said I will spew thee out of my mouth or just lukewarm part Christian part not part believer part not but they're not sold out no wonder Jesus said many are called but if you're chosen many are called to sell out livestock and Barrel but only few are chosen to serve Christ with all their heart the majority that's been called to sell out everything they they just choose not to they choose not to serve him acceptably they choose not to to prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God now we've been set free by Christ Jesus himself said he that the son is set free is free indeed it's it's the word and we we claim that scripture don't we come on get into this word it'll help you know I I take a lot of pills every day I don't even want to tell you how many pills I take I take more pills and probably everybody combined in here I think brother Mark knows I've told him don't you tell anybody but some of the pills I take are small and some are real big and you know what it's like when you take a horse pill it is like you need something to help take it down and I just say some of these pills that we're swallowing today they're big pills I don't just say you you need a little help getting it down with a little amen so be it Lauren he that the son is set free is free indeed that's what the scripture says that's what Jesus said but the scripture also says that you are not your own your ball with a price so are we owned by Christ or have we been set free all the confusion in being a Christian am I really free or am I own by the will of God this is the Dilemma that we find ourselves in because if we if we lean towards the one you know I'm free I can do what I want don't tell me God tells I do everything that God tells I can do what I want well then you're really not bought with a price you really don't belong to the one that bought you and that's why we can't be saved and then lose it so we're this is I understand we made a major decision when we got baptized it was the best one you can make on the planet it was the best one that you could make but the next best one uh the next best one is that you make it the next day you make that same decision the next day and the next day and the next day and the rest of the days of your life God's servants are man-made I Gotta Throw these things out here because I want you to ponder these thoughts God's servants are man made there's a controversy over if God's servants are God called or if they're man-made I say a controversy and I just if I could say it like this is both just want to bring a balance to this we are all called to be sold out servants to Christ but it doesn't happen on its own in fact it can't happen unless you choose to sell out it's not going to happen if you don't choose to be an unrestricted servant of God uh it won't happen God doesn't have these special people that are just unrestricted servants they're like robots I chose them they don't have nothing to do with it no every one of us has to go to the Freemore agency every one of us has to make a decision if we're going to serve because God don't have robots so we can see that yes there's a calling but then man has to choose choose to make himself a servant and you can make yourself a restricted servant I'm only going to do this I'm only going to do that and after that it's between me and God and don't tell me don't act like you're a vessel that God uses to speak to me either or you can choose to be an unrestricted servant I'm I'm ready for Duty Lord I'm here whatever you would have me to do wherever you have me to go whatever you'd have me to say or however you'd like me to spend my time I'm here because that's what God's looking for don't you believe I believe God's servants are man-made because God don't have any robots Paul's life he before God came to Paul he basically did what he wanted to do and he served he didn't even know the God he was serving honestly because when the Lord appeared to him he said who art thou he didn't even know and yet he went to church and he was the highest and the greatest and above said under the best teaching in the message but he still didn't know he still didn't know in First Corinthians 1 1 St Corinthians 1 1 Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God and Sophie is our brother okay now we're called through the will of God for his purpose we're called to the will of God for his purpose and we're all called to do different things okay Romans 1 once I'm glad you're with me because you're going to get more out of this if you stay with me Romans 1 1 Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of God now notice here Paul is not called to be a servant he's called to be an apostle you cannot find scripture where it says Paul was called to be a servant it's a choice it's a choice that you make it's not a calling it's a choice amen so when you look at people serving God it's a choice that they've made it's not a calling that God puts special upon them because it's upon all men it's just we all have to make that same choice just like we all have to stand before the Lord right amen you will find that Paul was called to be a minister he was called to be an apostle but you will not find any Scripture where Paul was called to be a servant Paul did choose every day to serve he chose to be an unrestricted servant of God he he he he presented his body of living sacrifices we read the scriptures of what he actually went through he suffered so many things but it was all through choice he chose to serve God it wasn't going to be easy in fact if you're serious about serving God if you're serious about serving God more than you are I heard a minister say one time you better get thick skin because the devil's after you and he'll use whoever he can to get you off the track of putting God first in your life and working for the kingdom look I'll say it like this we're all going to have problems in life look what's happening in the world everybody's suffering I mean who do you know who's living a bed of ease who do you know okay why are we searching for it right why are we hungering for it we're all going to suffer you might as well suffer for something you get rewarded for you might also choose you this day whom you'll serve praise the Lord now we call ministers Servants of God is that true and they are in one way but in another way they're just serving their call to minister I want you to catch what I'm saying here if they are called to minister in their ministering then they're serving their calling but that doesn't mean they've chosen to serve Christ with their whole life there's a difference there's a difference between someone who ministers and someone who serves and that's why I've often said you don't have to be a minister to be the greatest servant of all you just got to choose to give your life the Bible says first of all gifts and callings are without repentance God chooses to give us all gifts and we all got gifts whether we repent or not we got gifts we're going to be getting into that in the next few months I think we should use our gifts for the kingdom of God not for ourselves Amen brother Ram told us what happens when we sell out and use our gifts for ourselves right right and give us examples of those in the world who used to play for the Lord and then went out into the world God doesn't choose who will serve him he wouldn't all men would come unto repentance and serve him that's his desire but people have to make their own choice they must choose who they're going to serve every day God don't make robots God Don't Make men to serve him outside of Primo agency so don't look at people and say oh God called him to no look at them and say they they're making a choice to serve God in their bodies they're choosing to give their life over what they could have you know brother Brandon could have been a multi-millionaire brother Brandon could have had his own denomination president could have had a lot right but he chose to serve the father we all have that same Choice amen we're presented with a lot of stuff from the Devil and and we've got to take this word more serious we've got to start growing in the Lord we've got to start growing spiritually we got to start getting more involved in the things of God instead of just using God for something to help our lives and start serving God for his kingdom are you with me man chooses to serve man chooses to make himself a servant of God and we must make the choice to be in unrestricted servant for his kingdom Paul was called to be an apostle Jesus said set him free from all his murderous acts and his hatred his malice as ill-speaking his self-serving from building his own reputation from acting like he was better than others Jesus said set him free from all those things Paul said for what things were gained to me I counted loss Paul being a free man having been set free from the bondage of himself he had to make a choice would he choose to live for himself now that he's been set free or would he choose to serve him who set him free amen think about those ten lepers that came they were all thank you Lord for healing me nine of them went on their way and when only one came back he asked the one that came back where are the other nine they should all be here they should all be up at the altar they should all be worshiping where are the other worshipers where are the where are the others that are thankful as this one unrestricted are you going to restrict yourself and what you're going to do for God are are you going to choose to be an unrestricted servant amen all right turn with me to First Corinthians chapter 9 verse 19. you know the devil see we all think we're serving God the way that's acceptable to him the Devil is a very good artist he's a very good Craftsman he's a very good deceiver he's very good at making it look like we're doing all that we need to be doing right but I guarantee if we humble ourselves and we just say Lord what would you have me to do he will speak he will speak but what happened to the children of Israel they hardened their heart they were just so sick of hearing it we need a different Moses they don't want to hear it no more and so Paul was set free what does Paul do with his freedom First Corinthians 9 19 for though I be free from all men yet have I made myself servant unto all he made himself a servant unto all to the point though I'm free no man owes me yet I put myself under every man every man that I come in contact with why that I might gain them to the kingdom that pretty much sums up the nature of God that God would want all men to be saved the fields are white unto Harvest but the laborers are few Paul was one of those who chose to be an unrestricted servant we don't got a lot of time I met I meant for preaching this sermon brother Marty but you're right there we ain't got much time before the Lord comes together what are we going to do with our time you're free Jesus set you free what are you going to do with your freedom are you just gonna try to become a better goody goody exercise your self-righteousness just have more of God in your your life so you could build your life your desires your dreams is it on your heart today to put away everything to be a servant unto all brother Brandon gave us a glimpse that that was the definition of eternal life and to me eternal life isn't up there eternal life is living in the hearts of his people amen thank you Jesus they've done well given up their life they've they've done well surrendered their life they done well got a revelation of being bought with the price that Calvary was not just setting them free so they could go on and serve themselves without the bondage but now that they can become unrestricted Servants of Christ now I know this is a hard message I know this isn't something that makes us feel good but I'm telling you this is what God's calling today what he's calling today now here Jesus sets Paul free he's been set free because Jesus indeed set him free but he takes his freedom and He makes himself a serpent he's not called to be a servant He makes himself a servant the call was to be an apostle you know we've all been given a Ministry of reconciliation reconciling the world unto Jesus Christ letting God use our bodies to bring others to Christ and though we be free from all men we have to accept the responsibility of that too many people are calling themselves Christians and living the life that they want to live but Christians live the life that Christ wants them to live it's different I'm taking six different messages and I want to read what brother Brandon said about Christianity because it's really not about living for yourself it's just the opposite it's just the opposite God sent us a message to bring us out of ourself to set us free from the bondage of ourselves you know a lot of people have been repented they've gotten baptized but they're still in bondage they they they got right back into bondage they're not even in the same place they were when they were set free how happy they were and wanted to serve the Lord and given time for God and then they just started serving strange gods serving themselves Lord help us to shake ourselves pinch our conscience as the prophet said brother Branham said I'm not going to read all the message but I can give you a copy of this if you want it we belong to a certain certain great order we call ourselves Christians because we belong to a certain order like I'm in the message he said that's not Christianity you know Christianity is an experience and it's a life in other words it's something that it starts in your life at one time and then it continues on it becomes the life that you live thank you brother we need some more amens we really do and here's here's the thing when you say Amen it doesn't mean you know brother Brian should say like this if you can't say Amen say oh me you need to say something but if you can just enter into you know okay when you're real hungry it's easy to eat but if you had pizza three times that day and you go home for dinner and the wife says let's have pizza you're not excited about doing that right you're not you're not now here's the thing some of this word is hard to swallow I understand that I understand it but if you agree with it God will give you an appetite and then it won't feel like you have to eat pizza again so Christianity's experience and a life and these Christians was just living any kind of life making a poor example of their profession he said Christianity is a Sanctified life he said Christianity is a sacrificed life think about that it's not oh I'm a Methodist oh I'm a Baptist oh I'm a message believer it's not that it's a life of sacrificial living where you just live for others he said it's a hidden life with God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost that's the real Christian Life consist of now of how well it's not of how well you can do this or do that or how well you can sing and say that's all right or how well you can preach he said that's fine but that isn't it amen it's a hidden life it's consecrated the Veil curtains drop around you and you're dead and you're buried and you're hidden with God through Christ and sealed there by the Holy Ghost he said Christianity is a living being in mankind amen that's a proof of the resurrection of God's son who was raised with us we have so many different forms of it and we call it Christianity but there's one Christianity Christianity is not a denomination it's not a group of people Christianity is a person and that's Christ and he said you are his subjects wow you are his subjects he's connecting his resurrection power with his subjects Paul had finally surrendered his life to God and become God's subjects instead of the devil's subject and what did God do through his subject Paul he used him for his kingdom so what is he doing through his subjects today is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen amen amen he said how wishy-washy I've read this before but just now that I feel close and you you're just open and I don't feel resistance just tried to take this word and let it deal with you it's not a deal with he says how wishy-washy that's what too many Christians today they're so soft spot soft soaked and everything until they think all they have to do is join a church go in somewhere put their name on the book a little something jump up and down shout something like that and call it Christianity he said Christianity is an everyday rugged life living for God in this present world not back then it's a constant burning of the fire and the love of God in the heart don't tell me that you're a Christian let me see that love let me see you just living for others it's a constant burning of the fire and the love of God in the heart that sets you a fire and put you out yonder with people making converts to Christ and then he says responsibilities responsibility he says this is a responsibility it's a choice we have to make he says but it's easy to go the way the world goes well the world just wants to take a back seat he says it's easy to flow down the stream you go out there and you sit down the river with your boat you get your oars and start pulling up against the current you don't make much time but it goes and it goes hard but you just once let your oars out of the water and watch how fast the trees going by but look where you're going you ever just wanted to just take it easy not read not pray not listen to a tate not go to church I need a break and then you just decide to choose to do that and then after a while you just feel so puny because you've allowed the nature of the old nature to have preeminence just feeding basically you're not feeding the white dog anymore he says when things are floating easy remember you're going towards a great cataract down there of some sort you're going towards the falls and it won't be long uh you'll be going over the falls just floating with the world easy as as the way that it goes you don't want to do that he says no sir he says but you must accept your responsibility you must accept your responsibility now you believe it says you believe it it's the truth I want to say I'm just going to get this thought I'm going to say it and I know I'm I'm overboard and I got pages to go but it's so good to God bless you brother it's Welcome to our church I hope that this doesn't scare you please come back when somebody else is preaching it's so so good to see brother Orlando up up towards the front here I just feel I got a closer amen it's good to see sister Bertha with us it's been a while God God bless you talking about responsibility you must accept he says now the responsibility that God has given us in this day is to bring this message and as I get older and I know my days are shortening up I feel I feel a great a responsibility greater than I ever had now think about that we how many times have we felt less of a responsibility I don't need to do that I don't feel like doing that it's not my calling but this is the Holy Ghost talking amen as I get older and I know my days are short and I feel the responsibility grade that I've ever felt pressing on we must do it we must get down to it and everywhere we go and tell the message tell the people that Jesus is coming Hallelujah and he is God and he's coming soon there's not a hope left in the world but the coming of the Lord now that's the responsibility that we need to be up and about with a man born and filled with the Holy Ghost serves that's just all there is to it if the spirit of Beethoven Lives in you you'll play like Beethoven if the spirit of rimbat lives in you you'll paint like Rembrandt and if the spirit of Christ lives in you you will serve he brings his body under subjection to serve he doesn't serve himself he doesn't serve when it's convenient he doesn't serve his favorite friends his closest brothers and sisters or he doesn't just focus on his family he's unrestricted he's an unrestricted servant to serve all men we don't want to make Christianity what we want to make it we want to present ourselves a Living Sacrifice unto the Lord the holy ghost in a real Christian will subject himself to serve everyone with the purpose of getting them closer to God because God's given him a Ministry of reconciliation I hope you see what I'm trying to tell you today we don't have time well I'm going to try to do it you mind if I take a little bit extra time it's an hour it's been an hour okay I want to read this real quick First Corinthians 9 19 for though I be free from all men yet have I made myself servant unto all that I might gain them more and unto the Jew I became a Jew that I might gain the Jews to them that are under the law verse 21 to them that are without the law as without the law 20 verse 22 or that was 21 22 to the week became I is weak that I might gain the week I am made all things to all men that I might by all means save some of them he knew he wasn't going to get them all he knew others think about even even he said he had to deal with false brethren in the churches I mean God knows who's who but I'm just saying we need to serve everybody and this I do for the gospel's sake that I might be partakers thereof with you know ye therefore that they which run in a race run all but one receive at the price so run that ye may obtain so he's talking about a race here and this race is between his natural carnal nature and the the new man and it's a race that you're with and if you yield yourself servant unto just you kind of want to do your own thing you're not going to save very many people but if you bring that thing under subjection you let God have his way God will use you because God we heard the prophet say God could just turn the world upside down with one man we just got to give more to God Amen now Jesus was our example he was our example how many times have you heard that you never want to be in a church where the church says Jesus was not your example he was our example he was the example of being the father's unrestricted servant we know that he did only those things that pleased the father he was the father's servant to all and he gave his life for all men one time he the father told him to go down to Samaria and he told his disciples I must means go by Samaria and he just went he was unrestricted and there was a woman there at the well who just he didn't she didn't have a very good life but he was an unrestricted servant amen and he went there and he gave her life there was a a time where um there was a woman caught an adultery and uh he helped her and I'll tell you there's a room full of people that God has helped right here because he was an unrestricted servant and it's not a big thing that he has called us to be on restricted servants turn with me this is going to be our last set of scriptures here in Saint John chapter 13. so here is uh uh the time that he was in the the upper room and we all know the story to where uh he got his disciples and he he had bread communion with him but he also washed their feet right Andy verse 5 we'll pick it up and after that he he poureth water into a base and began to wash the disciples feet and wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded and cometh to Simon Peter and him not really knowing what's going on he says did thou wash my feet and Jesus answered them what I do thou knowest not but you're going to know and Peter saith unto him thou shall never wash my feet you know what I am taking control of this situation Jesus answered if I don't wash your feet you don't know you don't even part with me if we don't let Jesus cleanse us from our daily sins we don't have no part with them we need him Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands in my head and Jesus saith on him he that is washed deedeth not saved to wash his uh his feet but is clean everywhere and you're clean but not all if Ray knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after that he had washed their feet and taken His Garment and sat down again he said unto them know ye what I have done unto you hmm I came to church something was preached I'm just trying to figure this thing out he says you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am you got that right if I then your lord and your master has washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I've done unto you he was an unrestricted servant because you know whose feet he washed he was judas's feet amen he didn't say you know what they did me harm I don't want to talk to them what a spirit how is that going to get in heaven how is that going to get in heaven Jesus did not just allow Judas in the church he chose him to be a disciple to work the ministry with him to show that God is not a respecter of persons that he loves everybody he's an unrestricted servant and he says to his disciples I am the example I've given you example you ought to wash one another's feet sometimes we get so caught up in our life we don't even care about one another's problems we're not even looking at the need in fact when we see a needs sometimes we get we want a 10-foot Pole make sure we stay away from them I just wonder is that the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost having preeminence in their life no let's stand together I don't want to steal your time because I want to give you some time if you want to seek the Lord I want this altar to be open praise the Lord Saints He's Worthy He's Worthy now we have not presented to you another gospel this is not even the John Martin version this is just the gospel is one Satan doesn't want us to hear and think about this the weakest Christian on his needs the devil trembles because there's a surrendered life going on I just want us to take the time don't leave this service without making a commitment to God don't come hear the word but want to be a doer of the word whatever he speaks to you just walk in that light I have no Greater Joy than to hear my children walk in truth God is calling us but we must accept our responsibility to make yourself not a restricted servant anymore but an unrestricted for the glory and the honor of god let's sing I am so needy Lord I am so needy I am so needy Lord so needy of you I am so needy Lord to be more like you you share all my rights away in this world of sins [Music] so need love make me pure within just obey the Lord [Music] so needy Lord so needy of you I am so needy Lord to be more like you share all my rights away in this world of sins I am so
