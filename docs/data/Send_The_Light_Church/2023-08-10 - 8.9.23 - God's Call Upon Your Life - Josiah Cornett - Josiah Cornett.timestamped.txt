[37:06] before the author this morning
[37:08] dear Lord Jesus we're just so grateful
[37:11] to
[37:12] be in the company of such precious
[37:14] Saints Lord is Brother John was
[37:16] testifying Lord it hadn't left we hadn't
[37:19] hardly left a building before it came to
[37:21] my heart I would want to come back and
[37:23] be with these Saints again Lord
[37:25] just doesn't seem to be enough to be a
[37:27] visitor but Lord I know that one day we
[37:29] won't be visitors one to another Lord
[37:31] certainly we're not in our family but
[37:33] there's one day where we're all going to
[37:35] dwell in the same house
[37:37] a place to be prepared for us
[37:39] but Lord tonight we come to our home in
[37:43] your word Lord
[37:44] and that's where we feel most home at
[37:46] Lord as we would come to this book I
[37:48] pray that you'd open the pages of it
[37:50] Lord and I pray you'd open each heart
[37:52] father
[37:53] I pray there would be Hearts doors that
[37:55] would be willing to heed your knocking
[37:59] and sup with you Lord and not just to
[38:02] wish you goodbye Lord at the end of the
[38:04] day but Lord there be little hearts and
[38:07] young lives even here that would say I
[38:09] want his abiding presence I want Jesus
[38:11] to stay with me when I put my head upon
[38:14] the pillow I want to know that I'm at
[38:16] peace with God and when I Rise up in the
[38:19] morning I I want to know that he's there
[38:21] and been singing Over Me All Night Long
[38:23] Lord may that be that kind of confidence
[38:26] between you and each believer here
[38:28] tonight I pray that there would be the
[38:30] one that would not believe tonight Lord
[38:32] I pray your heart would reach out to
[38:35] theirs Lord and call them to thyself in
[38:37] Jesus Christ name we commit this service
[38:39] to thee O Lord amen amen
[38:44] well we'll get straight to the word I
[38:46] would like to turn over to
[38:49] the book of Hosea chapter 11. in verse
[38:53] 1.
[38:54] just as we're turning there I'll I'll
[38:57] testify that we would have loved to have
[38:58] come up here sooner but the way it
[38:59] worked out it just seems that it uh it
[39:02] couldn't have been possibly any sooner
[39:04] the words the Lord's been establishing
[39:06] here tonight have been
[39:08] established in my heart these last few
[39:10] weeks and I'm very eager to share them
[39:12] tonight amen
[39:15] Hosea 11 verse 1 say Amen when you have
[39:18] it with me amen get her amen is all
[39:20] practice up right boys
[39:22] get them all fired up and ready to go
[39:25] how many have the word tonight amen amen
[39:27] there we go Hosea 11.
[39:30] first one
[39:31] when Israel was a child then I loved him
[39:35] and called my son out of Egypt
[39:38] may the Lord bless the Ring of his word
[39:40] let me be seated
[39:41] they think it's a funny thing that I
[39:43] would take only one verse for I'll say a
[39:47] context to my text tonight
[39:49] but we know that this this scripture
[39:52] here has a double physical or a double
[39:54] natural fulfillment out of Egypt have I
[39:57] called my son we know of course that
[40:00] that refers to Israel being down there
[40:02] in bondage in in Egypt but also later on
[40:05] in in the gospels we find out that had a
[40:08] double fulfillment in Christ out of
[40:10] Egypt have I called my son when Christ
[40:12] went down there as a little boy and he
[40:14] stayed in Egypt as Herod was trying to
[40:17] kill all the all the baby boys that were
[40:19] there around Bethlehem in the
[40:21] surrounding area
[40:22] and God hid him away in Egypt and he hid
[40:27] his people away in Egypt as slaves one
[40:29] day
[40:30] and I believe that he's hit his people
[40:32] away maybe it seemed would seem as to be
[40:35] in bondage and slavery to sin but
[40:37] there's a great Deliverance one day
[40:39] coming for his people and I believe that
[40:41] I'm I'm preaching to a people this
[40:44] evening that is a third fulfillment of
[40:46] this prophecy
[40:48] that there was there was an Egypt what
[40:50] we call a type of the world but God's
[40:52] called you out of that world Amen now
[40:54] you're no longer in Egypt God's called
[40:56] you out of slavery God's called you out
[40:58] of bondage amen but tonight if I could
[41:00] I'd like to take a text and and name the
[41:03] sermon if I could be so bold to say
[41:06] God's call upon your life amen
[41:08] God's call
[41:10] upon your life
[41:16] I think about Israel here
[41:19] the original
[41:20] fulfillment of this prophecy who was
[41:23] born under slavery
[41:26] and you can imagine how how it would be
[41:28] for a little boy or a little girl that
[41:30] was not just captured and put into
[41:33] slavery but they were born as a slave
[41:37] their father and their mother were
[41:40] slaves and all they ever knew was the
[41:42] the whip upon their back and they they
[41:44] got up in the morning they had to toil
[41:46] not because their mom and dad told them
[41:48] to do chores but because when they went
[41:51] outside if they didn't do what they were
[41:52] told they saw their mom and their dad
[41:55] whipped for not having productive
[41:57] children
[41:59] that it was that that they could see
[42:01] that they they were themselves
[42:03] responsible for their own mother and
[42:05] Dad's discomfort that they didn't
[42:09] produce and they didn't
[42:11] abide in the hand of the task Masters
[42:13] the the Egyptians and no doubt they got
[42:16] to an age when they were old enough to
[42:17] experience that whip themselves it
[42:19] wouldn't have been very long I don't
[42:21] suppose
[42:22] but to the task Masters figured well
[42:24] this boy five years old he is about time
[42:27] he figured out what a whip felt like
[42:29] getting motivated
[42:32] and that's all they ever knew
[42:34] the whip of a task master bondage of
[42:37] slavery
[42:38] I wonder if it kind of
[42:40] molded them into a box somewhere yeah
[42:43] yeah well they couldn't imagine what it
[42:45] would be like to be a free man
[42:47] uh studying the Histories on the way
[42:49] here and thinking about the all our own
[42:52] case of slavery here in the United
[42:54] States and the children that they study
[42:56] their social studies their histories
[42:58] they'll know what the Civil War was and
[43:00] that great Emancipation Proclamation
[43:03] that came forth and when Lincoln took
[43:06] home the victory for the North and what
[43:08] it meant for the the blacks and slavery
[43:10] but come to find out there was a portion
[43:13] of of those people that were in slavery
[43:15] in our own country that didn't know what
[43:18] Freedom was like and didn't know what to
[43:20] do with freedom
[43:22] the historians tell us there was about a
[43:24] 15 percent that stayed back with her
[43:26] Masters and said well I'll just abide
[43:28] here I'll just keep doing the same work
[43:30] I've always done
[43:32] because it was it was beyond the scope
[43:35] of their imagination what could I do
[43:37] with freedom and no doubt the southern
[43:40] slaves or former slaves could have gone
[43:42] to the north and found themselves a much
[43:44] more prosperous situation but they it
[43:47] was beyond the scope of their
[43:48] imagination there there was no vision
[43:50] the Bible says that where there is no
[43:51] vision the people will perish
[43:54] and there was no vision
[43:56] they said well what what would it matter
[43:58] if I stayed at this Plantation or went
[44:00] to the plantation next door over it's
[44:02] all the same work I'll just go ahead and
[44:04] stay here and do what I've always done
[44:08] and you find that there's Echoes of that
[44:10] same mentality in the Israelites because
[44:13] even when they're delivered by a mighty
[44:15] hand of a mighty God and he Parts the
[44:17] Red Sea and he he throws their captors
[44:20] there and they're they're out there on
[44:21] the other side of the Red Sea they see
[44:23] all their captors drowning in the Red
[44:25] Sea and they they give Rejoice but after
[44:28] that just like the blacks down there in
[44:30] the South they initially Rejoice but
[44:32] then they said what do we do now
[44:34] and the first trial that ever came to
[44:36] them in Israel they said well why don't
[44:39] we go back we don't have any water here
[44:42] in the desert let's go back to our task
[44:44] Masters in Egypt it would have been
[44:46] better for us if we had just gone back
[44:50] no vision no scope for the imagination
[44:56] they still saw themselves paid it into
[44:59] this box of being a Slave
[45:02] God called them the children of a
[45:04] promise
[45:05] God have had a vision for them that one
[45:08] day they would be the instruments of his
[45:09] grace
[45:10] Amen to project his grace and love for
[45:14] the world through a savior that would be
[45:15] brought forth through their people
[45:17] his special instrument they were God's
[45:20] chosen people
[45:21] but yet they had this this mentality
[45:24] that my I just can't imagine a life
[45:28] better than what I had back in Egypt
[45:31] can you imagine
[45:33] can you imagine wanting to go back to
[45:35] the whip of the Taskmaster
[45:37] because it was more comfortable
[45:39] because you didn't know what to do with
[45:42] freedom
[45:43] I wonder if there's anyone here tonight
[45:45] that could sympathize though that
[45:48] there's times in our Christian Journey
[45:50] that we don't know what to do with this
[45:52] Freedom they're they're When God says
[45:54] that there's nothing that's impossible
[45:56] for you
[45:57] that might overwhelm you
[46:03] you can say well
[46:05] I can't imagine what to do with that
[46:07] freedom but tonight I want to talk about
[46:09] God's call in your life
[46:12] and by God's word and by his Spirit
[46:14] tonight to reinvigorate your heart with
[46:17] God's vision for your life amen
[46:21] amen you know I I think about
[46:22] there's a a term called Stockholm
[46:25] syndrome today that people talk about
[46:27] and it's a coming from a 1973 event I
[46:30] believe in Stockholm Sweden where some
[46:33] bank robbers
[46:34] captured the people and held them
[46:36] hostage for a number of days and by time
[46:39] it was all over those people had created
[46:42] some kind of emotional attachment to
[46:44] their own captors
[46:46] and they wouldn't testify against them
[46:48] and they wouldn't cooperate with a
[46:49] police against them and they called it a
[46:51] Stockholm syndrome and we find that in
[46:54] in children that are abducted and and
[46:56] kept for years and years they they begin
[46:58] to have an emotional attachment
[47:02] to their captors
[47:04] and I I wonder if it could be said that
[47:07] there's people who are in bondage to
[47:10] slavery and bondage to spiritual sin
[47:13] today
[47:13] that would say I I don't even consider
[47:16] that any longer my Captor
[47:19] I consider it my lover or my friend my
[47:22] comforter forget about coddling Sin it's
[47:25] now sin that's coddling us
[47:29] but God doesn't see you that way no more
[47:32] than he saw the children of Israel as
[47:34] being slaves they may have saw
[47:36] themselves a slave and never been able
[47:38] to get themselves out of a slavery
[47:40] mindset but God had a different vision
[47:42] for their lives and no matter what the
[47:45] children of Israel saw themselves as
[47:48] it would not change
[47:50] what God would see them as Hallelujah
[47:52] and we see which Vision prevailed and
[47:55] now four thousand years down the road we
[47:58] can see that God had his way with his
[48:00] people amen
[48:01] but my would have been a much less
[48:04] Troublesome Journey that they had just
[48:06] believed on God's promises
[48:13] I think about how they they painted
[48:15] themselves into a box of slavery
[48:17] but
[48:19] God wanted to take them from the rags of
[48:22] Egypt to The Riches of the Promised Land
[48:27] and God wants to take us from a rag to
[48:29] riches
[48:31] you know the whole world loves to have a
[48:33] rag to riches story you know the man
[48:35] pulled himself up by his bootstraps and
[48:37] he'd done it and he he defeated all the
[48:40] odds he was born into a poor family
[48:43] brother John and you bring up this whole
[48:46] sob story and he he only had a mother
[48:48] and his father left him at a young age
[48:50] and and and then now look at him he he
[48:53] went to school and made something of
[48:55] himself and he he came out and worked
[48:59] and got himself a business and and
[49:02] just pull himself up by his bootstraps
[49:06] but God has a better story than that for
[49:09] you this evening
[49:10] don't don't get don't get lost chasing
[49:13] the worlds rags to Rich's story you've
[49:16] already got a rag to Rich's story you
[49:19] were found in the rags and the
[49:21] filthiness of your own righteousness or
[49:24] the best thing that you could do is say
[49:25] well I don't lie I don't steal I don't
[49:28] cheat and God said it's all as filthy
[49:32] rags to me that's all your righteousness
[49:34] but I've got my riches matter of fact I
[49:37] came down and dwelt in your filth I came
[49:40] down and wore Rags literally wore Rags
[49:43] for you what was interesting as the baby
[49:45] he was just dressed in the little
[49:47] Garment of a sweaty oxen a swaddling
[49:50] cloth wrapped around him literal Rags so
[49:54] that we could be partakers of his riches
[49:57] and his Mercy
[50:00] remember friends you're not chasing a
[50:03] rags to Rich's story you are a rags to
[50:06] riches story
[50:07] oh there's there's one the one who
[50:10] chases after you and plagues your mind
[50:12] tonight that Old Devil the Leviathan
[50:15] he's the he's the ultimate riches to rag
[50:18] story and you can remind him of that
[50:20] every time he says well go chase your
[50:22] riches in life you can come I've already
[50:24] got the riches Satan you the riches that
[50:27] you made the Grand mistake of leaving
[50:29] behind when you lifted yourself up in
[50:31] Pride and said as the son of the morning
[50:33] I'll be like the most high God
[50:36] and there was his fall amen when he made
[50:39] himself as God or try to
[50:41] that's where he fell and lost his riches
[50:44] and is now in his Rags there in hell
[50:50] but be careful friends how you define
[50:52] what your riches are
[50:54] because it will shape the view of your
[50:57] story
[50:58] and your identity
[51:00] Christ said that wheresoever are man's
[51:03] riches his treasure is there his heart
[51:06] will be also
[51:07] I have the first question for you
[51:09] tonight is where is your heart tonight
[51:11] amen is your heart tied up in popularity
[51:14] and what the kids at school think of you
[51:16] and what the boss has for you at work
[51:18] and the next promotion and the next
[51:21] house that you can find on Zillow or the
[51:23] next truck that you can find on
[51:24] AutoTrader or where is your riches
[51:27] tonight amen
[51:28] good question because how you answer
[51:31] that question
[51:32] will tell you whether or not you find
[51:35] yourself
[51:36] in your own Rags towards your story or
[51:39] you still find yourself in rags
[51:42] because if you're if you define your
[51:44] riches as the next house or the next
[51:46] truck or the next promotion or the next
[51:49] person that says I love you or the next
[51:52] person that that accepts you and
[51:54] receives you or or by any other thing
[51:56] than what Christ has already done for
[51:58] you
[52:00] the new has have misidentified yourself
[52:03] amen
[52:04] amen because Christ himself has showered
[52:06] his love upon you he showered his grace
[52:09] upon you it's been showered upon you
[52:12] since 2000 years ago you talk about
[52:14] being born to slavery no you were born
[52:17] to God's righteousness because before
[52:19] the foundation the world my Bible says
[52:21] that you were chosen in Christ who
[52:24] before the foundation of the world was a
[52:26] bloody sacrificial lamb for your sins
[52:29] for your unrighteousness
[52:31] and he had a plan for your lack of
[52:33] righteousness to do away with your
[52:35] filthy garments
[52:39] you're not dressed in rags this evening
[52:41] you're dressed in God's holy white
[52:44] Garment of Praise
[52:46] that's what he wants you to recognize
[52:47] yourself as wearing tonight yes amen
[52:49] you're not trusting someone that I will
[52:51] be one day or I want to be or I should
[52:54] be or I could have been or or I should
[52:57] have been
[52:58] you're dressed as the one who's been
[53:01] proclaimed as a son or a daughter of God
[53:04] and if you don't believe that tonight
[53:06] then then all you have to do is receive
[53:10] God's promise for your life go from
[53:12] being a non-believer go from being a
[53:14] make-believer and say I do believe you
[53:17] can even be like that one man who said
[53:19] he brought us he brought us his his
[53:21] plegic his epileptic son to Christ he
[53:23] said would you heal my boy would you he
[53:26] basically he said my life is broken
[53:30] my life is incomplete here's my son what
[53:33] is your situation here's my situation
[53:35] it's broken it's incomplete there's
[53:37] something wrong here and I don't know
[53:39] how to fix it for him it was his son for
[53:42] you it might be something else but
[53:44] Christ's first question was do you
[53:47] believe he said if thou can'tst believe
[53:49] amen
[53:51] then all things are possible and
[53:54] immediately that man's heart went out
[53:55] and said Lord I believe but helped thou
[53:58] my unbelief
[53:59] oh if you can just start their friends
[54:02] what an honest heart that man had
[54:05] and that's what Christ looks for as
[54:07] honest hearts tonight amen
[54:09] amen God is not a a robot button Pusher
[54:12] he's not looking to open up a panel on
[54:15] your chest and push the buttons to make
[54:17] you go forward tonight he's looking for
[54:20] a relationship he's looking to start a
[54:22] conversation with you yes and look at
[54:24] that man who had a broken son he was
[54:27] honest-hearted enough to say I do
[54:30] believe Lord but I also recognize with
[54:32] enemies some unbelief
[54:35] help it Lord yes Lord and from there a
[54:38] conversation can start from there what's
[54:41] what's he doing he's opened the door of
[54:43] his heart literally say here here let me
[54:46] Lord Lord I don't know how to do this
[54:48] but quickly quickly let me open the door
[54:50] of my heart get your foot in there Lord
[54:52] let's start this conversation help my
[54:54] unbelief and what did he have at the end
[54:56] of the day his situation his Brokenness
[54:59] his son was healed amen and that's what
[55:02] Christ is calling out tonight is saying
[55:04] I recognize that you think you're in
[55:05] bondage you think you're you think
[55:07] you're still wearing filthy rags
[55:10] but I want you to know
[55:13] I want you to become my believing son
[55:15] not just my son but my believing son
[55:20] oh Hallelujah you talk about belief
[55:23] you talk about riches
[55:25] I'll tell you what God's already
[55:27] declared where his riches were where's
[55:29] God's heart at tonight
[55:31] it's where his riches are where he's
[55:33] places value and we know that where he's
[55:36] placed his value is a new friend
[55:38] wheresoever Man's Treasure is there is
[55:41] his heart also and if he spill his blood
[55:43] for you I'd say that his heart is not
[55:46] far behind
[55:47] amen oh Hallelujah
[55:51] but the children of Israel
[55:54] we see
[55:55] their minds still got in the way of what
[55:58] God had for them
[56:02] they got all the way up to the promised
[56:05] land
[56:07] just about dragged through the
[56:08] wilderness
[56:10] or was that it was a type of
[56:11] sanctification dragged through
[56:14] sanctification how many has everyone
[56:15] felt you just feel like you're getting
[56:17] dragged through sanctification
[56:20] yeah I left the world in a hurry I
[56:23] couldn't wait to leave it behind I was
[56:25] so happy to see the Red Sea open and
[56:28] impossible things happen but now that
[56:29] I'm in the desert I just feel like I'm
[56:31] being dragged through sanctification
[56:34] and they said well this sanctification
[56:37] is hard this desert is hard it would be
[56:39] better if I went back to the world why
[56:42] because sanctification is not a fun
[56:45] place to be it's not meant to be where
[56:47] you live you're not meant to be living
[56:50] in the desert you're not called to be
[56:51] living in the desert there's a reason
[56:53] why God made humans dependent upon water
[56:56] and didn't put no water in the desert
[56:57] because you weren't built to live in the
[57:00] desert you weren't built to live in
[57:01] sanctification all the time
[57:03] but the children of Israel got right up
[57:05] to their promise what is that that
[57:07] Promised Land of a life of overcoming
[57:09] the Holy Ghost
[57:11] they got right up to that promise
[57:15] and we find out that only two of them
[57:17] had a vision to cross over
[57:20] only two of them went over there and
[57:22] spot out the land and said you know what
[57:24] these Giants they ain't nothing for my
[57:27] God Amen I can't wait to knock them over
[57:31] like toothpicks
[57:34] these great walled cities I can't wait
[57:36] till we can just see what God does to
[57:39] them
[57:40] and the other ten they walked in there
[57:43] and maybe they saw the a man whipping
[57:46] another man
[57:47] because they were slavers in that land
[57:49] of Canaan as well
[57:51] and brought back all the PTSD all the
[57:54] post-traumatic stress all the memories
[57:56] of being in slavery
[57:59] and they said to themselves no
[58:01] if we go in here
[58:03] we're going to end up slaves again
[58:05] it'd be better for me to stay back there
[58:07] behind Jordan never cross over
[58:10] never dare to live a life in the Holy
[58:13] Ghost
[58:14] it'd be better for me just to practice
[58:16] sanctification to keep my dress long and
[58:18] my hair long and not wear shorts and do
[58:22] all the things that I'm supposed to do
[58:24] and not do all the things I'm not
[58:25] supposed to do
[58:27] those mechanics I can handle that
[58:30] but I don't want to try and fall fat on
[58:32] my face
[58:33] I'm not going to enter into this promise
[58:36] of god good word what was it the lacked
[58:39] a vision
[58:43] oh my
[58:46] what was it they they came back and they
[58:48] shared their own report
[58:50] came out of their own lips we
[58:52] as
[58:55] what was it
[58:56] grasshoppers
[58:58] that's how they saw themselves
[59:01] they said and they see us that way also
[59:04] now I don't think they took a poll
[59:05] didn't ask everybody how do you see us
[59:07] matter of fact we find out
[59:10] a whole generation later
[59:13] The Works of God that God had done for
[59:15] them back at the Red Sea stayed on for a
[59:18] whole generation later and still
[59:20] continued to inspire fear in the hearts
[59:23] of those who lived in Jericho so much so
[59:26] that Rahab said this whole city is in
[59:29] fear of you
[59:33] but they thought that everyone saw them
[59:35] as grasshoppers
[59:38] well
[59:39] maybe they should have been looking at
[59:41] God's testimonies like everybody else
[59:42] was
[59:43] instead of looking at their own
[59:45] shortcomings
[59:48] but the Bible says that where there is
[59:49] no vision the people perish and every
[59:51] one of them perished they're in the
[59:52] wilderness because they had a lack
[59:55] of vision
[59:57] but God is here tonight
[1:00:00] calling you to a greater Vision than
[1:00:02] Israelites had
[1:00:04] Israel wanted to go back to slavery's
[1:00:07] Comforts they said let me go back to
[1:00:09] Egypt it would have been better for me
[1:00:12] now I wonder if there would be anywhere
[1:00:14] one here tonight that would be making
[1:00:16] the same mistake that Israel made it
[1:00:18] says let me let me go back to depression
[1:00:21] I remember those nights where
[1:00:24] I would spend all night upon my bed just
[1:00:26] thinking those dark thoughts and I would
[1:00:28] wake up in the morning I couldn't get
[1:00:30] away from them and that despondency and
[1:00:32] that despair
[1:00:33] but yet it was a comfort
[1:00:35] it's it's easier to be
[1:00:38] staying in depression than finding a way
[1:00:41] to shake it that's true
[1:00:45] it's easier to stay all bound up with
[1:00:48] anger in my heart
[1:00:50] about what happened over here or what
[1:00:52] somebody did to me over there and how my
[1:00:55] life has transformed over here it's
[1:00:57] easier for me to have this Heart full of
[1:01:00] anger that old slavery task master
[1:01:03] than to find a way to take it to the
[1:01:06] rivers of Jordan and let it die
[1:01:10] it's easier to just hold it close
[1:01:12] because it's a comfort to me like I said
[1:01:15] it's no longer about it's no longer
[1:01:18] about coughing sin but it's about now
[1:01:19] being coddled by sin amen amen where
[1:01:22] we're now getting our if you're not
[1:01:24] careful you're going to be finding your
[1:01:26] own comfort in the sin in the anchor
[1:01:31] oh but brother Josiah you don't
[1:01:32] understand who I am and the messy things
[1:01:35] I've done and I deserve my life I
[1:01:38] deserve what has happened to me and I I
[1:01:40] deserve and
[1:01:42] start going down this path of of
[1:01:44] self-loathing
[1:01:46] what are you doing you're you're taking
[1:01:48] all the devil's thoughts
[1:01:51] and placing it upon yourself there's
[1:01:53] only one that deserves what happened to
[1:01:56] him
[1:01:57] uh Satan amen amen there's only one and
[1:02:00] in a sense yes you do deserve death
[1:02:02] because because that's what this human
[1:02:05] race has coming to it
[1:02:07] but this human race is also bought and
[1:02:09] paid for by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:02:12] and so by by his by God's accounting you
[1:02:15] no longer deserve death because he's
[1:02:18] paid the price there's only one that's
[1:02:21] not paid for
[1:02:22] and that's Satan right
[1:02:24] right there's only one that should be a
[1:02:26] self-loathing creature tonight amen yeah
[1:02:28] he's too proudful to be self-loathing so
[1:02:31] he takes all that and tries to torment
[1:02:34] you with it it's true
[1:02:36] but Israel wanted to go back
[1:02:39] to slavery's Comforts maybe alcoholism
[1:02:42] would be another comfort that we'd have
[1:02:44] tonight
[1:02:45] it was easier to stay without I read I
[1:02:49] read a testimony recently recently it
[1:02:51] was the story of a a singer a very
[1:02:54] famous singer you'd know his name if I
[1:02:55] were to say it
[1:02:57] and he was talking about how he grew up
[1:02:59] in a Pentecostal home in his parents his
[1:03:03] his father abused him slapped him around
[1:03:05] and his father was a preacher when he
[1:03:07] wasn't an alcoholic
[1:03:10] and he'd go through cycles of getting
[1:03:12] all the alcohol out of his system and
[1:03:15] there was nothing he liked better than
[1:03:16] to go straight back in the Pulpit
[1:03:17] brother John and be a preacher and how
[1:03:19] that confused that boy he gave us
[1:03:22] testimony of how
[1:03:24] one time he he shared with his friends
[1:03:26] that sometime his mom and his dad get in
[1:03:27] a fight and that's all I said he didn't
[1:03:29] say anything bad or wretched or vile
[1:03:31] about his parents you might say well
[1:03:33] that sentence sounds about right I get
[1:03:35] in fights with my wife sometimes too
[1:03:38] but they didn't see it that way and he
[1:03:40] got home and it got back to his mom and
[1:03:42] she started just wailing on the boy
[1:03:44] taking every book off a bookshelf and
[1:03:47] throwing it at this little nine-year-old
[1:03:48] boy and until he was curl up in the
[1:03:50] fetal position
[1:03:52] knocked his ribs out with her feet and
[1:03:55] kept yelling at him you don't ever talk
[1:03:57] about our family you don't say anything
[1:04:00] about what goes on inside this family
[1:04:03] Pentecostal home
[1:04:06] that boy grew up and he said the only
[1:04:08] comfort I had was the singing rambos and
[1:04:12] I would just let myself
[1:04:14] dive into that southern gospel music and
[1:04:17] that's what how many remembers the
[1:04:19] singing ramble is a that's that's LP
[1:04:22] record playing material right there he
[1:04:25] would say that would be the only comfort
[1:04:26] I would have as that southern gospel
[1:04:29] music and that's what started me on my
[1:04:31] journey music I found Comfort there I
[1:04:33] felt the Holy Spirit draw I could only I
[1:04:35] could only find peace there in the music
[1:04:38] but later on when he started his singing
[1:04:41] career and he got around people that
[1:04:43] were party animals and he said I they
[1:04:45] were social Drinkers and that was fine
[1:04:47] for them but
[1:04:48] I took one sip of that stuff and all
[1:04:51] those genes that my father had came back
[1:04:53] upon me
[1:04:55] and Don I won
[1:04:58] no he should have known better and some
[1:05:00] of us we don't know if that Gene's there
[1:05:01] or not because our parents were
[1:05:03] Sanctified and Holy Ghost filled and we
[1:05:05] we never got to see them in that state
[1:05:07] but he knew his dad was in that
[1:05:08] statement yet he reached for that
[1:05:10] alcohol the genes came back upon him and
[1:05:12] he said it just about tore upon it apart
[1:05:15] its marriage
[1:05:16] but what did he do there was something
[1:05:18] in him that said I don't want to stay
[1:05:20] this way
[1:05:22] yeah it's it's easier he said it was a
[1:05:24] hard road to get away from that alcohol
[1:05:26] there were many times when it would have
[1:05:28] been just easier to stay there that old
[1:05:31] Egyptian Taskmaster but there was
[1:05:33] something in them that wanted to change
[1:05:38] there are hard shackles in this world
[1:05:41] hard shackles from our phones and from
[1:05:44] the internet amen things that just take
[1:05:47] this flesh and they're like a magnet for
[1:05:49] it
[1:05:50] but let me tell you friends
[1:05:52] when God calls you to Deliverance it's
[1:05:55] not because he has an alternative for
[1:05:57] you it's because he has something better
[1:05:59] for you amen you know that's one thing
[1:06:02] about the blacks when they were freed
[1:06:03] down there in the southern in the south
[1:06:07] there was nothing for them to do there
[1:06:08] was no place for them to go they were
[1:06:10] still surrounded by so many white folks
[1:06:12] that didn't care for them and and there
[1:06:14] wasn't a lot of resources but God took
[1:06:16] his people he said no we're not staying
[1:06:19] here no more
[1:06:20] we're going to leave Egypt behind
[1:06:23] see you can't separate from slavery
[1:06:26] without actually separating
[1:06:28] no wonder there were so many blacks in
[1:06:30] the South that stayed behind and said
[1:06:32] I'll just keep on working with my old
[1:06:33] Masters they had nothing else to go to
[1:06:36] but God said I've got a plan
[1:06:39] I've got some place for you to go we're
[1:06:42] going to part spreads here we're going
[1:06:43] to go a few days through the Wilderness
[1:06:45] we're gonna Park the River Jordan we're
[1:06:47] going to take over Jericho and I've got
[1:06:49] a whole land that I promised to your
[1:06:51] forefathers
[1:06:52] and that's God's vision for you he says
[1:06:54] look when you get away from alcoholism
[1:06:57] you stay away from everyone that
[1:06:59] partakes about of it you stay away from
[1:07:01] all those old task Masters you stay away
[1:07:04] from the self-loathing you stay away
[1:07:06] from the depression you don't think that
[1:07:08] way you start yielding yourself over to
[1:07:10] positive thoughts and positive actions
[1:07:12] and yield your mind to the promises of
[1:07:15] God and let your mind be transformed
[1:07:17] according to his word be not conformed
[1:07:20] according to this word but be
[1:07:21] transformed
[1:07:23] by the renewing of your mind how does
[1:07:25] that happen we renew our mind with
[1:07:27] positive thoughts that's where this
[1:07:30] battlefield is at amen
[1:07:32] positive thoughts not like oh well I
[1:07:34] like the color red no positive thoughts
[1:07:37] that have healing and transformative
[1:07:38] power the Bible says that we're now
[1:07:41] looking into something that changes us
[1:07:43] from one Glory into another
[1:07:46] these are positive thoughts not a man's
[1:07:49] positive thoughts but God's positive
[1:07:51] thoughts a passive thought that you can
[1:07:54] be positive of
[1:07:57] looking unto Jesus the author and the
[1:07:59] finisher of our faith
[1:08:05] just as I would bring things to a close
[1:08:07] tonight
[1:08:09] I want to dwell before we would leave on
[1:08:12] two strange questions that God
[1:08:15] asks us
[1:08:18] I always thought these two questions in
[1:08:19] the scripture were some of the strangest
[1:08:21] questions ever found it was reasonable
[1:08:24] for God to ask the man with a paraplegic
[1:08:26] cell or the epileptic Sun if he believed
[1:08:29] but what about that time when he went by
[1:08:31] the pool of Bethesda
[1:08:33] and there lay a man
[1:08:36] that hadn't been able to walk since he
[1:08:38] was just a boy
[1:08:39] he'd been there for 38 years
[1:08:43] and
[1:08:44] the first question that God ever asks of
[1:08:47] him
[1:08:48] God and flesh Christ there standing
[1:08:51] before him
[1:08:52] could have snapped his fingers and the
[1:08:54] man would be well
[1:08:56] they didn't do that why because God is
[1:08:58] like we said God's not looking for a
[1:09:00] robot he's not there trying to open up
[1:09:02] your heart your the panel of your chest
[1:09:04] and press a button to make you move
[1:09:06] forward
[1:09:07] that would have been what he would have
[1:09:08] if that man was just a robot that God
[1:09:10] wanted results out of said I want you to
[1:09:13] walk go walk he would have
[1:09:16] cut concerned about that man
[1:09:19] so he asked some of the question he says
[1:09:22] brother
[1:09:23] to you one to be well
[1:09:27] and the first thing that that man gives
[1:09:29] is a bunch of excuses about why he
[1:09:31] hasn't gotten well and he can't get he
[1:09:33] can't get the water and before he can
[1:09:35] get there somebody else gets there
[1:09:37] before him and all these things but
[1:09:38] God's asking no no you don't understand
[1:09:41] do you want to be well
[1:09:43] because there's consequences to being
[1:09:45] well
[1:09:47] you've gotten used to being a panhandler
[1:09:51] all your life
[1:09:52] you've been there for 38 years you know
[1:09:55] what it's like to be a panhandler you're
[1:09:57] probably pretty comfortable with it got
[1:09:59] the panhandler thing down
[1:10:02] if you know how to make the sad faces
[1:10:05] you know how to get people to give you
[1:10:07] some money you know how this works just
[1:10:10] like the children of Israel kind of knew
[1:10:12] how slavery worked
[1:10:14] but if I make you well
[1:10:16] things are going to have to change
[1:10:19] and it's not going to be comfortable
[1:10:23] and there will be no going back
[1:10:28] you're you're going to be required to go
[1:10:31] get yourself a job Society is not going
[1:10:33] to give you handouts anymore
[1:10:35] you're going to have to walk on your own
[1:10:38] two feet earn a living for yourself
[1:10:40] people are going to look at you
[1:10:42] differently than they than you've looked
[1:10:44] at before
[1:10:45] you're going to have to look at yourself
[1:10:47] differently than you've looked at
[1:10:49] yourself before
[1:10:52] do you want to be well
[1:10:54] oh my
[1:10:56] now we're getting to some serious
[1:10:58] conversations with Christ
[1:11:00] you know
[1:11:01] I've had
[1:11:03] a lot of conversations with myself where
[1:11:06] the question wasn't do I want to but it
[1:11:08] was more like
[1:11:10] should I do this or
[1:11:11] could I do this
[1:11:14] you know that's a unending conversation
[1:11:17] should
[1:11:19] there's a lot of things I should do
[1:11:22] I remember when I first graduated from
[1:11:24] college it would have been a fine thing
[1:11:26] to go and pursue a master's degree and
[1:11:29] but at the end of the day
[1:11:31] I signed up for the classes and I just
[1:11:34] didn't have the want to
[1:11:36] in my imagination I thought having a
[1:11:39] couple extra letters after my name
[1:11:41] looked pretty good
[1:11:45] you know it's kind of like around
[1:11:47] January 1st you kind of think about all
[1:11:49] the things that you should do
[1:11:51] you get this imagination your and your
[1:11:54] mind
[1:11:56] yeah it'd be pretty nice to have some
[1:11:58] good muscles and be able to run a five
[1:12:00] minute mile and get kind of carried away
[1:12:03] with all the things that you ought to be
[1:12:05] doing
[1:12:06] and then if you're
[1:12:09] a little bit like me you also get a
[1:12:11] little bit burdened by all the things
[1:12:12] you ought to be doing I should have done
[1:12:14] this and I should have done this in life
[1:12:16] and
[1:12:18] I wish I would have done that
[1:12:20] I should maybe you might think I should
[1:12:22] be smarter if I hadn't done all those
[1:12:24] drugs I could have been a lot smaller I
[1:12:27] could have done this I could have done
[1:12:29] that
[1:12:29] gonna wash and all the shoulds of life
[1:12:32] and all things that would be fine things
[1:12:34] to do
[1:12:36] oh my I can put you asleep right now
[1:12:38] just thinking about all the things we
[1:12:40] could have done and should have done and
[1:12:42] should do it's an endless conversation
[1:12:44] isn't it man I could spend a whole
[1:12:47] Saturday morning just wrapped up
[1:12:50] imaginations
[1:12:53] wishful thinking
[1:12:55] regretful thoughts
[1:12:57] but it's a different conversation with
[1:12:59] god when God knocks on your door
[1:13:02] and says what do you want
[1:13:06] I wonder if you let that conversation
[1:13:09] begin to start tonight between you and
[1:13:12] your savior
[1:13:15] because God wants to know what you want
[1:13:19] I remember a conversation between
[1:13:21] brother Perry green brother Branham and
[1:13:24] brother Peregrine was thinking to come
[1:13:26] up
[1:13:26] to Art From from Texas up to Arizona to
[1:13:30] put his shoulder to the wheel with
[1:13:32] brother Brown there in Arizona
[1:13:34] he didn't really brought us the topic
[1:13:35] but brother Perry gives the testimony
[1:13:37] for the brand just kind of knew that it
[1:13:40] was on his heart and said you know
[1:13:42] brother Perry
[1:13:43] there's three things in life that you
[1:13:46] gotta look to line up to find God's will
[1:13:48] for your life
[1:13:52] and says you know when you're coming up
[1:13:54] a boat in to the Harbor House
[1:13:57] it was dark and foggy at night
[1:14:01] and that Harbor House they they line up
[1:14:04] three lights and when you've got all
[1:14:06] lights in the line you know you're
[1:14:08] straight
[1:14:11] it says the first thing that you've got
[1:14:12] to look for
[1:14:14] is you've got to look for is there a
[1:14:16] scripture for this in my life
[1:14:19] is there scripture for
[1:14:22] and when it comes to leaving behind
[1:14:24] Egypt and leaving behind slavery of the
[1:14:26] world there's a lot of scripture for
[1:14:28] that friend
[1:14:30] when it comes to
[1:14:32] are you going to be free from cancer
[1:14:34] there's a lot of scripture for that
[1:14:39] when it comes to are you going to be
[1:14:41] well would Christ make you well there's
[1:14:44] all kinds of scripture for that
[1:14:46] so we've got that down the next light
[1:14:49] that brother Brown gave brother Perry
[1:14:50] was
[1:14:51] does God make a way of Providence for it
[1:14:54] is there a door that God would open for
[1:14:57] it
[1:14:59] and again we're thinking about just
[1:15:01] these basic things like this man here
[1:15:04] that's been 38 years there's a door
[1:15:06] opening Christ said I am the door I am
[1:15:09] the way I'm standing here before you
[1:15:11] and Christ is standing here before you
[1:15:13] tonight knocking at your heart's door if
[1:15:16] you hear that little knock this evening
[1:15:17] know that that's not a man knocking on
[1:15:20] your heart's door I'm just sharing with
[1:15:22] you the same Christ that's knocked on my
[1:15:24] door time and time again and he's
[1:15:27] walking over from my house and my
[1:15:28] experience he's knocking on your door
[1:15:30] this evening now
[1:15:33] so there is a door that's opening to you
[1:15:36] tonight
[1:15:37] but then the last Light that brother
[1:15:38] Baron gave was finally
[1:15:41] do you want to do it
[1:15:44] do you want to be well
[1:15:47] God's looking for people that want to do
[1:15:49] things
[1:15:51] do you want to be a minister
[1:15:54] do you want to be a missionary
[1:15:56] do you want to be a songwriter like
[1:15:58] Fanny Crosby there's a lot of things
[1:16:00] that I should have done life a lot of
[1:16:02] things that were fine things to do
[1:16:04] there's things that my church that I've
[1:16:06] even signed up for and I've thought
[1:16:08] about how it would be a fine thing for
[1:16:10] me to volunteer but there was never
[1:16:12] fruit to it because my heart of heart
[1:16:14] that wasn't what I wanted to do I was
[1:16:17] doing it out of obligation
[1:16:20] friend find what God
[1:16:22] is directing your heart towards
[1:16:25] see God this the miracle of free moral
[1:16:29] agency God is not opposed to your will
[1:16:34] God wants your will to align with his
[1:16:37] that's right
[1:16:39] he made you
[1:16:41] in His image and then he came along and
[1:16:44] said if any two should agree on one
[1:16:47] thing it should not be impossible for
[1:16:49] them amen so Christ wants your will to
[1:16:52] align with him and then there's there's
[1:16:54] two that are in agreement you win Christ
[1:16:56] two free moral agents there's you can't
[1:17:00] have that with an angel brother John
[1:17:01] amen
[1:17:03] an angel just takes marching orders
[1:17:05] but a Son of God he has the potential to
[1:17:09] agree with his father
[1:17:11] amen so Christ asked this man do you
[1:17:14] want to be well
[1:17:17] and I want to ask you tonight
[1:17:19] I believe that's God's question for
[1:17:21] anyone that's sick or Afflicted with sin
[1:17:24] tonight
[1:17:25] do you want to be well
[1:17:27] do you want to change
[1:17:30] not just it's a good idea but is that
[1:17:32] something you want
[1:17:34] is this something you're willing to work
[1:17:36] for tonight
[1:17:37] think about Naaman he he didn't there
[1:17:40] was no snapping his fingers name it had
[1:17:42] to get down in the muddy Jordan and wash
[1:17:45] seven times
[1:17:47] and he he almost turned his back on the
[1:17:50] idea but his servant said look it's a
[1:17:52] small thing compared to what you're
[1:17:54] getting it's a small thing right and
[1:17:56] Friends compared to what you're giving
[1:17:58] compared to eternal life compared to a
[1:18:00] life that's free in the Holy Ghost
[1:18:02] compared to a life of Victory and
[1:18:04] conquest and favor with God and where
[1:18:07] all these trials that you're now dealing
[1:18:08] with are behind you and you can say I
[1:18:10] have them under my feet compared to that
[1:18:13] whatever you have to push through to get
[1:18:15] there is a small thing amen like washing
[1:18:17] seven times in the River Jordan
[1:18:22] do you want to be well
[1:18:26] and the next question that I find so
[1:18:28] remarkable in scripture the question we
[1:18:31] find all the way back there and
[1:18:33] in the Old Testament when we see Jacob
[1:18:36] whose name was Deceiver
[1:18:39] they went through all of his life
[1:18:41] with that name attached to him one who
[1:18:44] deceives because he because of his birth
[1:18:46] and then he fulfills it time and time
[1:18:48] again by not only his birth but by his
[1:18:50] personality deceiving his mother and
[1:18:53] deceiving deceiving his father and
[1:18:55] deceiving deceiving later his uncle
[1:18:58] Jacob The Deceiver
[1:19:01] but notice now when it came time that
[1:19:05] that remarkable point in Jacob's life
[1:19:07] where he began to fight with that angel
[1:19:09] because he knew that this was a crucial
[1:19:11] moment
[1:19:12] and I pray that there could be a crucial
[1:19:14] moment that would interrupt your life
[1:19:16] this evening
[1:19:19] I believe it's possible not because
[1:19:21] of the preacher but because the god
[1:19:23] that's standing here tonight
[1:19:24] that now is a crucial moment and if you
[1:19:27] just lay hand of the a hold of the Angel
[1:19:28] tonight I wonder what would have
[1:19:31] happened that night if well while Jacob
[1:19:33] was standing there in fear of his life
[1:19:36] from Esau he had set his family on ahead
[1:19:38] of him and he was just there left alone
[1:19:41] and the Bible says there there appeared
[1:19:43] in a man an angel of the Lord I wonder
[1:19:46] what would have happened if Jake would
[1:19:47] just let that angel go on
[1:19:50] nothing it would not have been a crucial
[1:19:53] moment but Jacob made the crucial moment
[1:19:55] when he laid hands on that angel and he
[1:19:58] wrestled him all night long he said I
[1:20:00] need a blessing I I want to change I
[1:20:04] want something different in my life
[1:20:06] something has to happen tonight because
[1:20:09] tomorrow I'm a dead man and that's the
[1:20:12] kind of attitude that you've got to take
[1:20:14] in your life when you recognize that
[1:20:16] you've spent too long in despondency
[1:20:18] when you've spent too long in alcoholism
[1:20:20] when you've spent too long in
[1:20:22] pornography when you spent too long on
[1:20:24] addictions when you recognize that
[1:20:26] there's something in your life that has
[1:20:27] to change and if you don't find a mile
[1:20:30] marker somewhere if you don't find a tie
[1:20:32] post somewhere you're going to get
[1:20:33] washed out to see and you recognize I've
[1:20:36] got to grab a hold of God that's where
[1:20:38] Jacob was at that night he wanted to
[1:20:41] change
[1:20:42] he wanted something to happen
[1:20:45] but he didn't know what he just knew
[1:20:48] that he needed a blessing from God
[1:20:50] and when he showed that that that that
[1:20:53] that Terror of his soul to that angel
[1:20:55] that he fought that night
[1:20:57] what was that Mighty Angels question to
[1:21:00] him
[1:21:01] I believe that was Christ
[1:21:03] what did he ask
[1:21:05] Ed says
[1:21:06] what's your name
[1:21:10] imagine that Brother Bruce
[1:21:12] you're fighting all night long
[1:21:15] I mean this is this is an epic battle
[1:21:18] This Is The Stuff of Legends man
[1:21:23] they're fighting until their bodies are
[1:21:25] just slipping past each other from the
[1:21:27] sweat it wasn't like fighting in the
[1:21:30] living room with your brothers
[1:21:32] this was this was so much that this is
[1:21:35] his whole leg fell out of its socket
[1:21:38] and still this man was fighting and they
[1:21:40] you can imagine you fight for hours
[1:21:44] every muscle movement it's just like
[1:21:47] slow motion everything is just so
[1:21:50] intense you you don't have any energy
[1:21:52] left he's pushed against you you're
[1:21:54] pushing against him
[1:21:58] and it's just a deadlock and then he
[1:22:01] says hey what's your name
[1:22:05] does that strike anybody is weird
[1:22:09] why did he asked that question because
[1:22:10] it was important
[1:22:12] Jacob said my name is Jacob Deceiver
[1:22:17] deceiver of my brother deceiver of my
[1:22:19] father deceivable of my uncle
[1:22:21] deceiving of the deceiver of the
[1:22:23] handmaiden that bore me
[1:22:25] just thought that I was coming out first
[1:22:27] and I didn't
[1:22:29] Deceiver
[1:22:33] that's all he knew himself to be that
[1:22:35] was his identity
[1:22:38] and what did that angel say he'll no
[1:22:40] longer be called deceiver hey
[1:22:42] from now on you're going to be called
[1:22:43] Israel which means prince who has power
[1:22:46] with God
[1:22:48] what did he do he gave him a new
[1:22:50] identity
[1:22:52] that's what Israel needed back in the
[1:22:54] day
[1:22:54] when they came up against that promise
[1:22:56] and saw themselves as grasshoppers their
[1:22:59] mind got in the way because their
[1:23:00] identity was false it was established
[1:23:03] based upon their experiences as slaves
[1:23:06] and said the promises of God
[1:23:12] you know there I I heard a testimony of
[1:23:14] a of a lady
[1:23:16] and she she told me that when she was
[1:23:18] growing up she she always heard the
[1:23:21] ministry talked about that quote where
[1:23:23] brother Branham says if this bride would
[1:23:25] ever recognize who the what the church
[1:23:27] is and who she is she would be an
[1:23:29] invincible Army
[1:23:31] and she would come up for prayer and she
[1:23:32] would say I I just want to know who I am
[1:23:36] I I just want that revelation of who I
[1:23:38] am
[1:23:39] I think what a shame that was
[1:23:43] that she didn't know who she was if I
[1:23:45] could wind back time and look that
[1:23:48] little girl in the face as that Minister
[1:23:50] I would want to tell her honey who you
[1:23:53] are as a daughter of God
[1:23:55] honey who you are is the Beloved of
[1:23:58] Jesus Christ accepted in his family
[1:24:02] honey who you are is a Chosen One chosen
[1:24:05] in Jesus Christ before the foundation of
[1:24:07] the world
[1:24:08] honey who you are is the friend of God
[1:24:10] because he said that
[1:24:12] whosoever would obey my Commandments is
[1:24:15] my friend just as Abraham was his friend
[1:24:19] I'd say honey you are complete and Jesus
[1:24:22] Christ this is what the scripture saith
[1:24:24] about you
[1:24:26] listen friend brother Brown
[1:24:28] when he when he preached those Seven
[1:24:29] Seals he said it's not something new
[1:24:33] it's something that was already in this
[1:24:35] book not the six seals all the way to
[1:24:38] the seventh it was already in this book
[1:24:41] and our identity that we're looking for
[1:24:43] to be an invincible Army is in this book
[1:24:47] but we've got to not be like Israel who
[1:24:49] didn't believe what God told them
[1:24:52] if Israel had believed that they would
[1:24:55] have been the Invincible army they would
[1:24:58] not have been grasshoppers they would
[1:25:00] have not have spent another 40 years in
[1:25:02] sanctification until they all passed out
[1:25:04] from exhaustion and death
[1:25:06] they would have been a Invincible Army
[1:25:08] Unstoppable amen amen as they eventually
[1:25:11] were
[1:25:13] friend God is calling you to be an
[1:25:16] invincible Army
[1:25:18] but he wants to ask you
[1:25:20] what's your name tonight
[1:25:23] do you want to change
[1:25:25] do you want to be well
[1:25:27] because God has a vision for your life
[1:25:29] don't go find your own Vision that's
[1:25:31] trash
[1:25:32] that's trash that's a bunch of Shoulda
[1:25:35] wouldas could us
[1:25:36] that's an endless conversation
[1:25:39] God has one vision for your life
[1:25:43] would you like to go find it let's stand
[1:25:55] I wonder if I could have every head
[1:25:56] bowed this evening
[1:26:03] I just want to lay out those two
[1:26:04] questions to you again
[1:26:09] I pray that you'd let it per me into
[1:26:11] your soul
[1:26:14] as
[1:26:15] those questions have been permeating
[1:26:17] into my soul even
[1:26:19] you know it's it's not just the believer
[1:26:21] that's not yet filled with the Holy
[1:26:23] Ghost that has to wrestle
[1:26:25] with Jordan
[1:26:27] there's parts of us that have to be
[1:26:28] seems like parts of us get left on the
[1:26:32] other side of Jordan
[1:26:35] and we have to go back and drag them
[1:26:37] through that River of death all over
[1:26:39] again
[1:26:42] that as long as you're in the flesh will
[1:26:44] never stop
[1:26:46] because we're being changed from one
[1:26:48] glory to another Glory
[1:26:51] but whether young or old tonight I
[1:26:53] wonder if you would look and
[1:26:55] your life
[1:26:57] that there would be something you would
[1:26:58] see that
[1:27:00] Jesus would be knocking tonight
[1:27:03] if you are hearing his voice say
[1:27:06] do you want that to be changed
[1:27:09] or do you want to keep it the rest of
[1:27:11] your life
[1:27:15] I wonder if you'd start that
[1:27:16] conversation with the Lord
[1:27:19] see I don't believe in a button pushing
[1:27:21] God I believe in a God that can snap his
[1:27:23] fingers and change the whole situation
[1:27:25] of the night but I also believe in a god
[1:27:27] of relationship
[1:27:31] a God that changes from glory to glory
[1:27:35] and not everything has to happen tonight
[1:27:38] but I wonder if you would answer his
[1:27:40] question to your heart tonight that he
[1:27:42] gave me to bring to you
[1:27:44] do you want to be well
[1:27:47] do you want to lay your burdens at
[1:27:49] Jesus's feet
[1:27:53] will you commit to not grabbing hold of
[1:27:57] those burdens when you leave those doors
[1:27:59] but leave them behind
[1:28:05] and secondly
[1:28:07] what's your name tonight
[1:28:11] would you recognize your situation my
[1:28:13] name is despondent my name is depressed
[1:28:15] my name is addicted
[1:28:19] my name is not well
[1:28:21] my name is broken there's something
[1:28:23] wrong with me
[1:28:26] would you be that honest as Jacob was
[1:28:29] with that angel
[1:28:31] would you be honest enough
[1:28:34] to tell God how you see yourself
[1:28:36] but to recognize that it doesn't have to
[1:28:38] end there
[1:28:39] is a power of transformation tonight
[1:28:43] assures Christ shed his blood for you
[1:28:46] it wants to take you to the next Glory
[1:28:48] that God has for you
[1:28:50] let's go before the Lord in prayer
[1:28:53] dear Lord Jesus
[1:28:55] we just come before you father
[1:28:59] Lord I'm humbled
[1:29:03] that you would make yourself so real to
[1:29:05] your people
[1:29:09] Lord that you'd ask those intimate
[1:29:12] personal questions
[1:29:15] on the way here I was thinking how
[1:29:17] in my mind I've often
[1:29:20] wish that you just give me a directive
[1:29:23] give me a a revelation give me
[1:29:28] some straight answer on things
[1:29:31] but how often it is that your most
[1:29:34] transformative work starts with
[1:29:36] questions Lord
[1:29:38] conversations do you believe
[1:29:41] do you want to be well
[1:29:43] what is your name
[1:29:46] all those things could be dressed with a
[1:29:48] snap of your fingers but you didn't do
[1:29:50] it that way Lord
[1:29:52] and it just proclaims to me a God that
[1:29:54] loves me enough to take me into his arms
[1:29:57] and sit down at life's table with me and
[1:30:00] to sup when I open my heart's door to
[1:30:02] you
[1:30:03] have a conversation with you and be
[1:30:05] changed by you Lord
[1:30:08] Lord it Thrills my heart that I could
[1:30:10] share that same Jesus with this group
[1:30:13] tonight Lord
[1:30:14] I believe that there's a group of people
[1:30:17] here that is believing on you for it
[1:30:19] Lord
[1:30:22] Lord I pray
[1:30:24] even as you see each conversation that's
[1:30:26] happening in each heart now Lord
[1:30:29] you would go to that heart now Lord
[1:30:32] it made that conversation not end
[1:30:34] tonight Lord
[1:30:36] but may there be a changing from Glory
[1:30:38] unto Glory unto glory in each young and
[1:30:42] old believer here tonight
[1:30:45] and may they be well Lord
[1:30:48] may they be changed and may they see
[1:30:51] themselves as you see them Lord
[1:30:54] princes and princesses sons and
[1:30:57] daughters
[1:30:58] who have power with God
[1:31:00] Kings and Priests into the most high God
[1:31:02] an army not to be reckoned with
[1:31:05] a powerful force
[1:31:07] that cannot be dismayed
[1:31:11] oh God thank you Lord we commit these
[1:31:14] Hearts to you now Lord in Jesus Christ
[1:31:17] name amen
[1:31:20] marks you can come
[1:31:22] if we could sing a word of praise the
[1:31:24] Lord
[1:31:27] if there would be anyone that would want
[1:31:29] to
[1:31:30] stay and pray a while your pews are open
[1:31:33] this altar's open I'd be happy to pray
[1:31:35] with you God bless you Saints it's been
[1:31:37] an honor serving you in the word of this
