[39:26] amen
[39:27] St John chapter
[39:29] 15 and then also if you could put your
[39:32] finger in Romans chapter 8 we got two
[39:34] scripture readings this morning we want
[39:36] to entitle this message God chooses his
[39:40] bride God chooses his bride brother
[39:43] Brandon preached a message it's one of
[39:44] my favorite messages in uh California in
[39:48] ' 65 at there the end of April called
[39:50] the choosing of a bride and it it it I
[39:54] recommend if we got time at the end I
[39:55] want to read quote that he spoke at the
[39:57] end of
[40:01] that and for a subject this morning how
[40:04] do I know that I'm chosen how do I know
[40:07] I'm chosen St John chapter 15 start with
[40:11] verse we're just going to read one verse
[40:12] actually one verse number 16 ye have not
[40:16] chosen me but I've chosen you amen and I
[40:20] ordained you that you should go and
[40:21] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[40:24] should remain and that whatsoever you
[40:26] shall asking the father ask of the
[40:28] father in my name he may give it you
[40:32] Amen in Romans chapter
[40:35] 8 verse
[40:38] 29 and verse 30 for whom he did for know
[40:44] he also did
[40:46] predestinate to be conformed to the
[40:48] image of his son that we might be the
[40:51] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[40:55] whom he did pre destinate them he also
[40:58] called and whom he called them he also
[41:02] Justified and whom he justified them he
[41:06] also glorified amen and God bless you
[41:09] you may be
[41:11] seated bam said in the message the
[41:13] revelation of Jesus Christ he said may
[41:15] this little time of coming together not
[41:19] only be for the edify of our own Souls
[41:23] but may it be to the enlightening to
[41:25] Enlighten us in such a way and Inspire
[41:28] us to we go and tell others amen may it
[41:32] be a time of rededication uniting with
[41:34] the full body of Christ and being ready
[41:39] for the
[41:42] Rapture these are comforting scriptures
[41:45] right here to know that the all knowing
[41:47] god knew us before the world ever began
[41:51] that's right and by this for knowledge
[41:53] he predestinated us to be the bride of
[41:56] Jesus Christ and one day soon we're
[41:58] going in a rapture we won't be going
[42:00] into a tribulation do you believe that
[42:03] we that we we by God's grace he paid the
[42:08] price so we didn't have to go through
[42:10] tribulation and because we came under
[42:12] full obedience to the word we get to
[42:15] escape
[42:17] tribulation said in the message
[42:19] Revelations chapter 4 part one he says
[42:21] immediately after the church age is over
[42:23] the leodan church age then the Rapture
[42:25] comes
[42:26] so I want to say today that we're still
[42:28] in the leoan church age and that's why
[42:31] we battle such lukewarmness at
[42:33] times because we're still fighting that
[42:36] thing and even though we received the
[42:37] message and we're becoming the bride of
[42:41] Christ that spirit is still here and we
[42:43] still bump heads with it amen 1
[42:46] Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 15 just
[42:50] trying to lay a
[42:51] foundation
[42:54] because the bride is is going to be
[42:56] raptured amen 1 Thessalonians 4:15 says
[43:00] for this we say unto you by the word of
[43:02] the Lord that we which are alive and
[43:06] remain until the coming of the Lord
[43:08] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[43:11] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[43:13] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[43:16] the Archangel with the Trump of God and
[43:18] the dead in Christ shall rise first amen
[43:22] then we which are alive and remain shall
[43:24] be caught up together with them in the
[43:26] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[43:28] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[43:31] wherefore Comfort one another with these
[43:34] words amen these words are
[43:37] comforting but I have to ask the
[43:39] question to myself how do I know that
[43:43] God has chosen
[43:46] me I think that's a good
[43:50] question in the message the door to the
[43:52] heart brother Braham said and as myself
[43:55] I believe tonight if the Rapture would
[43:57] come and they went according to your
[44:00] worthiness I would perhaps be the last
[44:04] one to
[44:05] go and he says I don't say that to be
[44:08] humble he really meant
[44:11] that there are many other people that
[44:13] have read the same scriptures that they
[44:15] read that we just read this
[44:17] morning so my question is has God chosen
[44:19] them as well as
[44:22] us are they elected too has God
[44:24] predestinated them because they read the
[44:26] same
[44:28] scriptures has God already
[44:31] revealed who's going in the
[44:35] Rapture I remember years years
[44:39] ago he was an architect that I I dealt
[44:42] with
[44:43] that actually made the plans up for the
[44:46] shop um years ago so you know how long
[44:49] ago that
[44:50] was and
[44:52] uh I remember him telling me
[44:56] so confidently that the Lord had
[44:58] revealed to him that he was going into
[45:01] the Rapture and it wasn't just well I
[45:04] really think no it was sure amen and um
[45:09] he was going to be alive until the
[45:11] Rapture took
[45:13] place but he he passed away quite a long
[45:17] time
[45:19] ago and so there's this thing of people
[45:24] feeling that they're
[45:26] Chosen and predestinated and that
[45:29] they're going to be here for the Rapture
[45:31] brother Bram said in the message the
[45:32] Rapture he says but to the church the
[45:34] bride now he calls the church the bride
[45:36] here to the church the bride the Rapture
[45:39] is a revelation to
[45:40] her it's a revelation to her amen that
[45:44] the Revelation the true bride of Christ
[45:46] will be
[45:48] waiting for the revelation of the
[45:51] Rapture
[45:53] right she's waiting for the revelation
[45:57] of the
[45:58] Rapture now it is a revelation for the
[46:02] Revelation is Faith you cannot have a
[46:05] revelation without it being faith faith
[46:08] is a revelation because it's something
[46:10] that's revealed to you faith is a
[46:11] revelation so the true bride is waiting
[46:14] for the revelation of the Rapture or the
[46:17] faith to be raptured or what brother
[46:20] Rand called rapturing Faith are you with
[46:24] me all right one thing to help you if
[46:26] you're tired is say Amen to every word
[46:28] of God
[46:30] Amen the Rapture is actually the
[46:33] changing of our bodies our bodies change
[46:37] and this poses another question to me
[46:40] how do I know my body is going to be
[46:42] changed how do I know
[46:45] that brother brandom ask eight questions
[46:48] in a row in the message recognizing your
[46:50] day in its message he said and the
[46:52] Gentiles are called out the bride is
[46:54] ready the Rapture is at hand
[46:56] he says but can we realize that can we
[46:59] actually believe that is it a story
[47:02] that's been told is it a myth to us is
[47:06] it something that sounds real is it
[47:08] something that we that we outside can
[47:12] believe or is it something on the inside
[47:15] is it a part of us that it's more than
[47:18] life to us he said What attitude do we
[47:21] set in this morning in this Tabernacle
[47:24] amen amen
[47:26] he said remember it's a small flock that
[47:29] receives it right so how do I know that
[47:33] I'm really chosen that God has really
[47:35] chosen me is it because I've been
[47:39] called the Bible says this if he's
[47:42] called you but many are called few are
[47:46] chosen so I can't go by The
[47:50] Calling I can say I'm chosen all day
[47:52] long but does that mean I'm
[47:54] chosen
[47:56] how do I know I'm
[48:00] chosen if all I have to do is claim it
[48:03] then all the other churches
[48:05] denominations Independents they're in
[48:09] right all you got to do is claim it amen
[48:12] all I have to do is believe it then all
[48:14] the people they that say they believe it
[48:16] are
[48:17] in so I think this is a real good
[48:21] question how do I know I'm
[48:24] chosen it's not just saying we
[48:27] believe people people need to search the
[48:31] scriptures to see that if what they're
[48:33] believing is is what the chosen believe
[48:37] amen that's absolutely the truth you got
[48:40] to search the scriptures many will come
[48:41] to me in that day and say Lord Lord
[48:44] didn't I do this and didn't I do that
[48:47] and didn't I speak in tongues and didn't
[48:49] I cast out devils and didn't you use me
[48:51] in a mighty
[48:54] way I had this this feeling inside of me
[48:58] that I was chosen I had this peace about
[49:01] it many will come to me in that day how
[49:05] do I know I am not one of
[49:09] them that come to him in that last
[49:14] day it's awful quiet here now I'm not
[49:16] pointing any fingers this is all
[49:18] pointing at me but I think it's a good
[49:20] question for all of
[49:22] us to my humble opinion the only way we
[49:26] can be sure is by non-stop walking in
[49:29] the light that God gives us right amen
[49:33] that is the only way that you even have
[49:35] a
[49:37] chance you've got to walk in the light
[49:40] as he shows you you can't say well I
[49:43] don't need that the most important thing
[49:44] I did was get baptized that is not
[49:48] good we're talking about bride there's a
[49:51] difference between the bride and those
[49:54] who go through tribul
[49:57] a we need to be pressing in we need to
[50:00] be adding and adding God's divine nature
[50:04] to our character we need to be growing
[50:08] because if our bodies are going to
[50:10] change something has to change first and
[50:13] that's our nature and that happens here
[50:17] that happens right now through fre more
[50:20] agency we must possess an attitude of
[50:24] hungering and thirsting for all of God's
[50:26] word nothing short of it will work if
[50:29] you remember when brother Brandon came
[50:31] back from the curtain of time what were
[50:33] the last words they were saying to him
[50:35] as he was go
[50:37] leaving keep pressing
[50:42] on well there's a difference between
[50:45] just hanging in there and pressing
[50:50] on pressing in is you have a purpose to
[50:53] become something that you're not
[50:59] and that's why I believe Paul had that
[51:03] attitude he keep pressing towards the
[51:05] mark amen it just it just lines up with
[51:07] the word now the devil's always trying
[51:10] to keep us from pressing in brother
[51:11] brandham said in the message modern
[51:14] events are made clear by prophecy he
[51:16] says you see you get to the place each
[51:17] one of you get starchy gets off amen and
[51:21] they can't receive new revelation
[51:24] right
[51:26] you mean I just can't come sit down in
[51:28] church anytime I want to and receive a
[51:30] revelation listen if you're not prepared
[51:32] if your heart's not
[51:35] right you you don't want to be starchy
[51:38] that's why I'm saying say Amen to the
[51:40] word amen get get into the word and
[51:43] enter in because as you say Amen all of
[51:45] a sudden you begin to change you begin
[51:47] to feel different right amen amen Satan
[51:52] has deceived so many people from getting
[51:54] away from God God's word amen want to
[51:58] talk about Lucifer for just a moment so
[52:00] you can see what how things are going on
[52:03] Lucifer's ultimate goal was to exalt
[52:06] himself his throne his kingdom above the
[52:08] stars of God that's what the Bible tells
[52:10] us in one way he's achieved that in one
[52:14] way he has achieved that and in another
[52:16] way he cannot achieve
[52:18] it in the one way he has he took a third
[52:21] of the angels that were in
[52:23] heaven and he has more souls in his
[52:26] kingdom than God
[52:31] does I don't 70 80
[52:34] 90 I just say it's a lot more I want you
[52:37] to think about Satan has more souls in
[52:40] his kingdom than God
[52:43] does okay praise God we got we got some
[52:46] that believe that statement I'm going to
[52:48] prove it through the
[52:49] scriptures God said to Eve because
[52:51] you've chosen a different headship I
[52:54] will greatly multiply thy sorrow in thy
[52:58] conception
[53:00] amen okay that's pregnancy now God
[53:03] didn't say I'll increase it by 0.1 or
[53:06] 0.25 or or by two I won't double it he
[53:10] he said I will greatly multiply
[53:15] it that means there's going to be a lot
[53:17] more
[53:19] children are you with me Jesus said wide
[53:23] is the gate and Broad is the way that
[53:24] lead to destruction and many there be
[53:27] which go in there at because straight is
[53:30] the gate Narrows the way that lead to
[53:32] life and few there be that find it many
[53:36] is a large number few is a very small
[53:41] number that's why Paul said I had to
[53:43] become all things to a large number that
[53:46] I might win a
[53:48] few it's just it's it's a it's a numbers
[53:51] game but you
[53:53] see the major majority of the people
[53:56] that we talk to are going to
[54:00] hell when they asked Jesus in Luke 13:23
[54:04] Lord are there few that be saved he
[54:07] answered said strive to enter into the
[54:09] Straight Gate for I say unto you for uh
[54:12] for many I say unto you will seek to
[54:14] enter in and shall not be
[54:19] able right not be able amen it is the
[54:23] truth that sets us free it's the truth
[54:25] that puts us in position with him amen
[54:29] truth is so important this is why we
[54:32] should always pray for the ministry and
[54:34] pray that we have a heart to receive all
[54:38] the truth because man shall live by
[54:41] every word that proceeds out of the
[54:43] mouth of God right amen now in one sense
[54:47] because Satan's kingdom is greatly
[54:49] multiplied with many more souls above
[54:53] numbers but we must must remember that
[54:56] his kingdom has an
[55:00] end so that these souls are going to be
[55:03] no more think about that's what's sad
[55:05] that's why we need a burden for
[55:10] souls he cannot live forever one day
[55:13] there's going to be no
[55:15] more it's a paradox Satan thinks he's
[55:18] destroying the seed of God through the
[55:21] self-willed
[55:23] birth he really thinks he's destroying
[55:26] the seed of God and as we know the
[55:28] natural birth is unacceptable to God
[55:30] that's why a man must be born again amen
[55:33] and God's seed will become Born Again by
[55:35] the will of God to live by God's word to
[55:39] obey God's word to be conformed not to
[55:43] this world but to be transformed into
[55:45] the image of Jesus Christ we've been
[55:47] predestinated that into eternity the
[55:50] Bible says we have received the bride of
[55:52] Christ I believe has received a kingdom
[55:55] that cannot be moved amen but Satan's
[55:58] kingdom will be moved right and that's
[56:01] why anything that isn't built on the
[56:03] word of God is going to be shaken amen
[56:06] so when it comes to Satan's seed there's
[56:08] nothing there to Quicken brother
[56:10] brandham said amen so that's why you can
[56:13] keep giving some ofbody the word the
[56:14] word the word the word and nothing
[56:15] happens right so many people hear the
[56:19] gospel and their nature never changes
[56:22] right amen that's why it really takes
[56:25] more striving to enter in than what the
[56:27] devil tells people more pressing in than
[56:30] what the devil preaches more than just a
[56:32] a lukewarm walk to overcome and to
[56:34] please God than what the devil Whispers
[56:36] in people's
[56:38] ears so how do I know I'm
[56:42] chosen how how do we know that God has
[56:45] chosen you how do we know that God has
[56:47] chosen us amen now 2 Timothy 2:19 says
[56:52] nevertheless the foundation of God
[56:53] stands sure having this seal that the
[56:57] Lord knoweth them that are his yes and
[57:01] let everyone that nameth the name of
[57:03] Christ depart from iniquity isn't that
[57:05] funny I I what a terrible thing to say
[57:07] after you're saying the scripture isn't
[57:08] that funny but you know that's not what
[57:10] I meant what I meant isn't it
[57:13] odd the Lord knoweth them that are his
[57:16] why didn't he just say hey so just
[57:20] relax I know I know who belongs to me so
[57:23] just relax he didn't say
[57:25] that he says I got a message for my own
[57:29] right for my seed I got a messag amen
[57:33] that we need to get out of knowing to do
[57:36] the right thing and choosing not to do
[57:38] it we got to get out of that we got to
[57:41] come out of that attitude amen and enter
[57:44] into
[57:45] obedience
[57:49] amen the Lord knoweth them that are his
[57:51] he said my sheep know my voice and what
[57:53] do they do follow the word depart from
[57:57] iniquity follow him they come with ears
[58:00] of I got to hear what his voice is
[58:02] speaking to me right you know too many
[58:04] people got this mentality they're going
[58:05] to come to church learn about God and
[58:07] feel closer to
[58:09] God we got to become God amen amen
[58:14] that's right Messiah it's it's the truth
[58:17] amen God is choosing those who are
[58:20] departing from iniquity that's what the
[58:22] Bible is saying here so we need to be
[58:24] serious about the word we need to take
[58:27] uh the word to our heart more seriously
[58:30] we need to fear God you know I think
[58:32] what's missing a lot in this age brother
[58:34] brother Bruce is talking about how
[58:36] things are shaking
[58:38] up shaking up in the
[58:42] world they say hate has risen
[58:46] 388 per against Israel since this war
[58:50] started no since I'll say it like this
[58:54] since that Israel was
[58:56] attacked and and they're faulting Israel
[59:00] for not getting into that but they're
[59:03] faltering Israel for standing up for
[59:06] themselves so hate is risen against
[59:09] Israel 388 per. that's what they
[59:13] said some have some of you seen that
[59:16] okay now what else is risen hate against
[59:19] blacks Spanish against everybody hate is
[59:22] on a rise right and Jesus told us it's
[59:26] going to
[59:34] happen we're living in a dangerous
[59:39] hour that we need to take God's word and
[59:43] get it in their heart I I believe the
[59:46] bride of Christ is the only one that's
[59:49] not going to be so affected by all these
[59:51] other things in the
[59:53] world and she's going to focus on the
[59:56] word she's going to keep her eyes on the
[59:57] author and the finisher of her faith and
[59:59] she will become what work was started
[1:00:02] inside
[1:00:04] her 1 Peter chap 4:1 17 says the time is
[1:00:08] come that judgment must begin right
[1:00:12] here right here begin at the house of
[1:00:15] the Lord and if it first began with
[1:00:19] us what shall be the end of them which
[1:00:22] obey not the gospel right so this is a
[1:00:26] real serious thing when we come here
[1:00:28] we're not just listening to brother
[1:00:29] John's opinions about The
[1:00:32] Bible amen God's word's going forth amen
[1:00:36] and and and we we receive that word we
[1:00:39] we take that word and we judge our life
[1:00:42] with it we find out where we're standing
[1:00:44] with
[1:00:45] God and if the righteous scarcely be
[1:00:49] saved woo tell the devil that one time
[1:00:52] when he says oh you're okay you're okay
[1:00:56] give them the scripture right here the
[1:00:58] righteous scarcely be
[1:01:01] saved where shall the ungodly and The
[1:01:03] Sinner
[1:01:04] appear now that word scarcely means with
[1:01:09] difficulty the righteous with great
[1:01:12] difficulty with much
[1:01:15] work are
[1:01:17] saved so the bride is not
[1:01:20] floating into her place in Christ just
[1:01:24] because she's in the
[1:01:26] message come
[1:01:28] on the Bible says wherefore let them
[1:01:31] that suffer according to the will of God
[1:01:33] commit themselves to the commit the
[1:01:35] keeping of their souls to him and wello
[1:01:38] as unto a faithful Creator so this
[1:01:41] difficulty that we're going through when
[1:01:42] we come to the house of the Lord and we
[1:01:44] hear you should stop smoking that hurts
[1:01:47] if we're
[1:01:49] smoking if we here you should pay your
[1:01:51] tie that hurts if we're not paying our
[1:01:53] tithes amen
[1:01:55] if we say we should lay down our life
[1:01:56] for one another it hurts if we're not
[1:01:58] laying down our life for one another
[1:02:00] amen but you're suffering for well doing
[1:02:03] you're committing your soul unto him
[1:02:05] who's a faithful he's a faithful Creator
[1:02:08] he created your soul he will keep your
[1:02:10] soul amen but we've got to come under
[1:02:13] subjection to the word right now the
[1:02:16] bride allows the word to judge her
[1:02:18] brother B say that's why she comes to
[1:02:20] the house of the Lord find out where
[1:02:22] she's at with God she'll be hum
[1:02:24] she'll be contrite and she'll recognize
[1:02:28] the headship of the
[1:02:30] word she'll recognize
[1:02:32] it because Jesus is not going to lead
[1:02:35] you to go do your own
[1:02:37] will but we've all experienced
[1:02:40] that Satan Satan's not going to come to
[1:02:43] you and say hey this is me Satan I want
[1:02:44] you to go do
[1:02:45] this he comes to you and says I'm God I
[1:02:48] want you to go do this right that's how
[1:02:51] he got
[1:02:52] me he ever get you you like that man
[1:02:56] let's just be honest be a home be a
[1:02:59] family he's a
[1:03:01] [Applause]
[1:03:02] liar you can know him because it doesn't
[1:03:06] line up with the word right
[1:03:10] amen now you would think that God would
[1:03:12] choose a religious spirit to be his
[1:03:16] bride because it's religious and it's
[1:03:19] you know people you know have you ever
[1:03:20] been told well you you're religious
[1:03:23] aren't you anybody ever said that to you
[1:03:26] oh you you must be religious you believe
[1:03:28] in
[1:03:29] God and you would think that God would
[1:03:31] choose a religious spirit to be his
[1:03:34] bride but a religious spirit is
[1:03:38] Antichrist the Bible says the two
[1:03:40] spirits in the last days would be so
[1:03:42] close Jesus said that it would deceive
[1:03:45] the very elect if it was possible in
[1:03:47] other words the elect are the only ones
[1:03:48] that can see the difference the other
[1:03:50] one can't see
[1:03:51] it they say they see it they see they
[1:03:54] understand they think they're right but
[1:03:56] they don't see
[1:03:58] it I'm going to tell you a religious
[1:04:00] spirit will not take
[1:04:03] correction it has no headship that's why
[1:04:06] it doesn't take
[1:04:08] correction it judges others but it will
[1:04:10] not judge
[1:04:12] itself it only uses the word as a
[1:04:16] cloak or a covering for their own
[1:04:19] lives other words they G to pick and
[1:04:21] choose what they're going to use the
[1:04:22] word for and you know how Jesus said
[1:04:26] remember Lot's wife well let's remember
[1:04:28] the Pharisees for a
[1:04:30] minute they knew how to act all high is
[1:04:32] good self-righteous in front of others
[1:04:35] but it wasn't genuine it was only a show
[1:04:38] and God isn't interested in how
[1:04:41] religious we could be or how we can put
[1:04:43] on a show he is interested in a genuine
[1:04:47] humility a genuine contrite spirit
[1:04:50] that's what he's looking
[1:04:52] for and that happens outside of
[1:04:56] people come on we need to love the word
[1:04:59] whether it's fun or
[1:05:02] not so how do I know God's chosen
[1:05:08] me we need to be sure we need to make
[1:05:12] sure can you can you be can you make
[1:05:15] sure that you are is that can I can I
[1:05:18] find out can I be sure because look
[1:05:21] we're all standing here think we're the
[1:05:22] bride right none of us are going to say
[1:05:24] no I'm not the bride why would you ask
[1:05:26] me such a thing we believe we're the
[1:05:29] bride how do I
[1:05:31] know second Peter 1:10 says wherefore
[1:05:34] the rather Brethren give
[1:05:38] diligence to make your
[1:05:41] calling and
[1:05:43] election a sure thing right for if you
[1:05:47] do these things you shall never
[1:05:50] fall why what are those
[1:05:53] things what are those things he's
[1:05:55] talking
[1:05:56] about well you go back in earlier in the
[1:05:59] chapter this is only verse 10 but
[1:06:01] earlier in the chapter he's talking
[1:06:03] about God's divine nature
[1:06:06] amen and that we have the promises of
[1:06:10] God's
[1:06:12] word given to us that we might obtain
[1:06:16] God's precious or God's divine nature
[1:06:18] through these promises right now he
[1:06:21] tells us to add to our faith this thing
[1:06:24] that we say yes I am I am add to that
[1:06:28] add what these virtues are the divine
[1:06:32] nature of Christ it isn't us it isn't
[1:06:35] what we were born with it isn't what we
[1:06:36] went to college for it's it comes from
[1:06:40] God Amen and and we've got to keep
[1:06:43] adding and if we keep adding we keep
[1:06:45] doing these things we're not going to
[1:06:46] fall we're not right because you're
[1:06:49] always pressing in you're always uh
[1:06:52] adding to it's when you you think I got
[1:06:54] enough see that Spirit of Leo DEA keeps
[1:06:57] us from pressing in we think well I came
[1:06:59] to church what else you want me to do I
[1:07:02] don't want you to do anything but the
[1:07:03] Holy Ghost wants you to become him amen
[1:07:06] that's what that's what's going
[1:07:08] on so we need to give diligence
[1:07:13] amen that means use
[1:07:16] speed make
[1:07:18] effort be
[1:07:20] Earnest labor study ende it means work
[1:07:26] right verse 11 for so in entrance shall
[1:07:30] be ministered unto you abundantly into
[1:07:33] the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[1:07:35] Savior Jesus Christ in entrance shall be
[1:07:37] ministered unto you so you come to
[1:07:40] church and you hear the word being
[1:07:44] ministered right that word is showing
[1:07:47] you how to get in
[1:07:51] amen too often we got to attit well I
[1:07:54] don't need
[1:07:57] that well if it's the entrance you need
[1:08:02] it now of
[1:08:05] course of course if I speak my mind my
[1:08:08] words my opinion you don't need that and
[1:08:12] you should never take
[1:08:16] it but if it's God's word you don't sit
[1:08:20] there and say well I don't know if
[1:08:21] that's the way I view it
[1:08:25] it's not about the word or the preaching
[1:08:27] suiting you amen it's about coming to
[1:08:31] church humbly and saying I know my life
[1:08:34] isn't
[1:08:35] right I know I'm not in His image I know
[1:08:39] I'm not hungering and thirsting for God
[1:08:41] like I should so therefore I'm going to
[1:08:43] bring myself under subjection to the
[1:08:46] word all right verse 12 wherefore I will
[1:08:49] not be negligent to put you always in
[1:08:52] remembrance of these things always put
[1:08:56] you in remembrance of these
[1:08:58] things well you talk about going to
[1:09:00] church and hearing the same thing over
[1:09:02] and
[1:09:04] over praise God though you know them and
[1:09:07] be established them you I'm still going
[1:09:09] to preach
[1:09:10] them yay I think it meet as long as I am
[1:09:13] in this Tabernacle to Stir Up Stir you
[1:09:16] up by putting you in remembrance knowing
[1:09:18] that shortly I must put off my off this
[1:09:20] my Tabernacle even as the Lord Jesus
[1:09:23] Christ have shown me moreover I Endeavor
[1:09:25] that ye may be able after my decease
[1:09:27] after I'm gone that you have these
[1:09:30] things always in remembrance what things
[1:09:34] is Paul talking about to keep
[1:09:37] [Applause]
[1:09:38] adding the nature of God to your
[1:09:41] character don't stop for
[1:09:44] anything give diligence make sure that
[1:09:47] you're continually adding your your your
[1:09:51] your whole goal is not just to make it
[1:09:52] to church twice a
[1:09:54] week come on coming to church don't give
[1:09:57] you the divine nature of
[1:09:59] God if it did we'd have a lot of goats
[1:10:02] sitting here today who's been in our
[1:10:05] barn
[1:10:06] anyways a lot of
[1:10:08] chickens a lot of plants going to the
[1:10:11] greenhouse you're not a plant because
[1:10:12] you walk into the
[1:10:15] greenhouse we're not a Christian because
[1:10:17] we walk in we don't got God's divine
[1:10:18] nature because we walk in there we come
[1:10:20] in here to hear from God and say God
[1:10:22] I'll take your word into my heart and I
[1:10:25] will live this word amen am serious
[1:10:29] about that that's what we need more Amen
[1:10:32] brother Braham said the only thing that
[1:10:35] we're taking with us when we leave is
[1:10:36] our character amen we've got to add
[1:10:39] God's divine nature to our character now
[1:10:42] Leo is sitting around in need of nothing
[1:10:44] can you say
[1:10:45] Amen they're they feel they're already
[1:10:48] chosen they're already going in a
[1:10:50] Rapture they're not sitting there in
[1:10:52] their churches taking you know we you
[1:10:55] know we're the foolish
[1:10:58] virgin they don't think like that we
[1:11:00] think like that but they don't think
[1:11:02] like that they think they're going in a
[1:11:05] Rapture they think they're
[1:11:09] chosen while she's going to church for
[1:11:11] every other reason than to get dressed
[1:11:13] in the word the
[1:11:14] invisible the bride is having an
[1:11:17] invisible Union with the word of God the
[1:11:19] Bride Comes to church because she knows
[1:11:22] that the she must become the word amen
[1:11:25] that's it I know we got other needs I
[1:11:27] know we have other desires and we have
[1:11:29] other requests and there's nothing wrong
[1:11:31] with it but we must become the word or
[1:11:34] else we're not going into Rapture what
[1:11:36] if we have everything that we could
[1:11:38] possibly want in this life with God
[1:11:40] money riches friends popularity every
[1:11:43] need met physically healthy one day
[1:11:46] you'll die and you still doesn't mean
[1:11:48] you're going to go on a rapture we must
[1:11:50] become the word
[1:11:52] amen and and it takes more than just
[1:11:54] saying well brother John it just sounds
[1:11:56] like you're just lacking a little faith
[1:11:58] I know I'm
[1:12:01] bride I believe there's more people that
[1:12:03] believe that they're chosen than they're
[1:12:05] not than there are
[1:12:10] chosen because
[1:12:13] look if my daughter an said to me dad
[1:12:19] you don't have to get the garbage out of
[1:12:22] the garage I already got got it for
[1:12:24] you well if I believe her I'm not going
[1:12:27] to go to the G garage and get the
[1:12:30] garbage and if the devil tells me I'm
[1:12:32] already chosen there's no need for me to
[1:12:34] be diligent about making sure of my
[1:12:36] calling you understand so there's voices
[1:12:39] that speak to us and we got to call them
[1:12:41] out when they don't line up with the
[1:12:43] word you got to say get behind me devil
[1:12:46] I'm pressing into this word
[1:12:49] amen now Church natural believes that
[1:12:52] she's chosen
[1:12:55] she has just enough conviction to try a
[1:12:58] little
[1:13:00] bit but God's testimony of her is that
[1:13:04] she's lukewarm and he said I'll spew
[1:13:06] thee out of my
[1:13:08] mouth but God's chosen bride isn't too
[1:13:11] proud to give
[1:13:13] diligence to make
[1:13:15] sure she don't worry about who's looking
[1:13:18] at
[1:13:19] her she already knows she's nothing
[1:13:22] without Christ
[1:13:23] amen She's continually adding his divine
[1:13:27] nature to his to her character she's
[1:13:29] continuing to manifest more and more of
[1:13:31] the word because that's on her heart
[1:13:34] that's why she comes to church she
[1:13:37] realizes that she can't make a Rapture
[1:13:39] without being in His image because
[1:13:41] that's what we've been predestinated to
[1:13:43] and it ain't going to happen at the last
[1:13:44] moment it will for your body but not
[1:13:47] your nature your Nature has changed
[1:13:51] now if that a't ain't true than
[1:13:54] everybody's
[1:13:55] going everybody's body is being changed
[1:13:58] your Nature has to be changed now you've
[1:14:00] got to be serious about having God's
[1:14:03] nature manifest in your life right
[1:14:07] brother brandom said in the message
[1:14:08] Christ is the mystery of God revealed he
[1:14:10] says the bride has to be the word not
[1:14:14] agree with it has to be
[1:14:17] it in other words you can't tell the
[1:14:19] difference between the two the bride has
[1:14:21] to be the word for he is the word
[1:14:25] right amen she cannot stand on good
[1:14:28] behavior she has to stand alone on the
[1:14:31] word because she's a part of it amen she
[1:14:35] was taken from Christ from the sight of
[1:14:37] Christ yes and to be sure that the whole
[1:14:41] Rapture now Luther was aart Wesley was
[1:14:43] aart the prophets was aart just in the
[1:14:46] Revelation that they were making up the
[1:14:49] body the feet the toes the arms and so
[1:14:50] forth until the head which would get to
[1:14:53] in a few minutes she see that makes the
[1:14:57] entire Rapture it's the body of the word
[1:15:00] it's the body of the word which is
[1:15:02] Christ
[1:15:04] amen outside of that he said you're
[1:15:09] lost he said outside of that you're lost
[1:15:11] I don't care how good you are I and he
[1:15:14] says or what your relationship is boy
[1:15:17] when I read that I just went like
[1:15:21] this because that's serious business
[1:15:24] amen I don't care how good you are or
[1:15:26] what your relationship is or what your
[1:15:28] fellowship is or what your church is
[1:15:32] you're lost outside of that word being
[1:15:35] in you
[1:15:38] yes and that word comes in by one Spirit
[1:15:43] by the spirit now we can receive the
[1:15:44] knowledge of the word and I don't need
[1:15:46] God's spirit for that I can sit in the
[1:15:48] room and learn all day about God Amen up
[1:15:50] here but the spirit of the word can only
[1:15:53] come in here by the by the word of the
[1:15:56] spirit can only come in by the
[1:15:59] spirit in other words it bypasses this
[1:16:02] faculty of knowledge and understanding
[1:16:04] and got to figure it
[1:16:06] out it's the love for the word when you
[1:16:09] love the word then the spirit of the
[1:16:11] word comes in right but you can study
[1:16:13] the word without the love of the word
[1:16:16] dos and don'ts and you never receive
[1:16:18] that into your
[1:16:19] heart I hope you're with me you
[1:16:21] understand what I'm saying
[1:16:24] now there were 10 virgins they all live
[1:16:25] good clean lives we're told they dressed
[1:16:28] proper they went to church they tried to
[1:16:30] help
[1:16:32] others they were Justified and they were
[1:16:35] Sanctified can you say amen Amen brother
[1:16:37] randam tght us that was a portion of the
[1:16:39] Holy Ghost is being justified being
[1:16:40] Sanctified so they had oil when they
[1:16:47] started
[1:16:48] now five of them took oil with them I'll
[1:16:52] say
[1:16:55] enough for justification and
[1:16:57] sanctification
[1:17:00] because they could not have lived good
[1:17:03] clean lives without being
[1:17:05] Sanctified the problem was that they
[1:17:08] didn't take enough of the oil to bring
[1:17:11] forth the divine nature of Christ are
[1:17:14] this if you you we just got to get this
[1:17:16] Revelation they had enough oil they all
[1:17:19] all their lamps were lit when they
[1:17:22] started
[1:17:23] five did not take oil those five already
[1:17:26] started with the oil they were Justified
[1:17:29] they were Sanctified you could not tell
[1:17:30] the two
[1:17:34] between in as far as living good clean
[1:17:38] lives
[1:17:40] but they didn't think they needed to get
[1:17:43] any
[1:17:44] more and that's the downfall don't
[1:17:46] listen to the devil that tells you that
[1:17:49] you may not like me because I preach you
[1:17:52] need more
[1:17:53] but it is from
[1:17:55] God you and if you don't believe it
[1:17:58] you'll see it one day these these
[1:18:01] virgins brother uh Jesus called them
[1:18:04] foolish because they would not believe
[1:18:07] his word and I believe his word told
[1:18:09] them you need to get more oil but they
[1:18:11] said I have
[1:18:15] enough I don't need to go to the altar I
[1:18:17] don't need to seek
[1:18:19] God I can do it at home do you do it at
[1:18:21] home if you did at home you do it
[1:18:27] here now the other
[1:18:30] five well they went on to get more of
[1:18:34] the Holy Ghost I think that's who God's
[1:18:37] coming for don't you I think that's who
[1:18:39] God's choosing he's not looking for just
[1:18:42] justification and
[1:18:44] sanctification he's not going to be
[1:18:46] married to just
[1:18:47] that would
[1:18:51] okay look
[1:18:53] all of you want to
[1:18:55] be I'm not getting about to get where I
[1:18:58] want to get to which is the good stuff
[1:19:00] I'm just going to say this every one of
[1:19:02] you want to be married to somebody that
[1:19:04] loves
[1:19:06] you how many people are Justified and
[1:19:11] Sanctified they clean up their lives
[1:19:13] because they have
[1:19:14] to they got to do this or they're going
[1:19:16] to get in
[1:19:18] trouble but they're not in love with the
[1:19:21] word God is looking for someone who's in
[1:19:25] love with him which is the word amen you
[1:19:28] can't separate God and the word you
[1:19:30] can't separate Christ in the Christ in
[1:19:32] the Bible they're they're one in the
[1:19:34] beginning was the word the word with God
[1:19:35] and the Word was God we have got to love
[1:19:37] that word and that word it hurts it cuts
[1:19:41] it feels bad but that's only to the
[1:19:44] flesh it isn't to the
[1:19:46] soul amen but God has not redeemed your
[1:19:50] body your body is going to die that's
[1:19:52] why brother Bruce we're getting
[1:19:56] older but that
[1:19:58] Soul has got another body waiting
[1:20:02] am yes thank the Lord amen now Peter was
[1:20:07] chosen by God we know that one day Jesus
[1:20:10] called to him and said come and I'll
[1:20:11] make you Fishers of Fishers of
[1:20:14] Men Peter had a choice to make was he
[1:20:17] just going to tag along or was he going
[1:20:20] to get serious about his calling right
[1:20:25] amen was he just going to be satisfied
[1:20:27] that he was a disciple or was he going
[1:20:30] to follow Jesus unto the Regeneration
[1:20:33] the new birth remember that's what Jesus
[1:20:36] told him to do right was he going to be
[1:20:39] content just thinking that he was
[1:20:41] converted or was he going to get
[1:20:46] converted I imagine that set Peter back
[1:20:49] when he when when Jesus told him he says
[1:20:52] Hey when you're ConEd converted
[1:20:53] strengthen your
[1:20:54] brethren what do you mean converted I
[1:20:57] already told you I'm sold
[1:21:00] out but I tell you
[1:21:03] what when you get
[1:21:07] converted you're not living for yourself
[1:21:12] anymore you're actually helping other
[1:21:14] Sheep amen you're loving other sheep
[1:21:17] you're laying your life down why why why
[1:21:19] why why aren't you concerned about
[1:21:21] yourself anymore because God's already
[1:21:23] taken care of you you are content with
[1:21:25] what you have amen and now your life has
[1:21:29] been given to God and God Gets In Your
[1:21:31] Vessel you know what he does he doesn't
[1:21:32] say oh it's all about you it's all about
[1:21:34] you it's all about you no it ain't about
[1:21:36] you right it's about
[1:21:40] others Paul had to give up
[1:21:44] everything he was in love with the souls
[1:21:47] of others and I it was the love of God
[1:21:49] in Paul you believe that
[1:21:56] Peter said we have to keep receiving
[1:21:59] more the divine nature of God giving all
[1:22:01] diligence add to your existing Faith
[1:22:03] virtue virtue knowledge knowledge
[1:22:05] Temperance Temperance Faith patience
[1:22:07] godliness godliness brother kindness
[1:22:09] brother kindness CH keep adding keep
[1:22:12] adding and be mindful is it is it
[1:22:15] happening do I see it thank you thank
[1:22:19] you let's we got to wake up to the word
[1:22:21] this word has to become real to we got
[1:22:23] to receive it we've got to receive it we
[1:22:26] can't just say oh we agree with this
[1:22:27] brother John I don't want you to agree
[1:22:30] with it I want it to become part of your
[1:22:32] life amen B said in the message the
[1:22:35] identified Christ of all ages he says
[1:22:37] now we find out that our Pentecostal
[1:22:39] Brethren are living in the
[1:22:41] glare of a Pentecostal
[1:22:43] age and they still miss it they're
[1:22:46] trying to interpret the Pentecostal
[1:22:49] message when they're Plumb past that
[1:22:52] when we're PM past that we're living up
[1:22:55] to the rapturing time for the coming of
[1:22:58] the end time I say there's a lot of
[1:23:00] people that are just in the glare of I'm
[1:23:02] in the
[1:23:04] messag try and interpret the message
[1:23:06] just like the pentecostalist
[1:23:08] did instead of receiving the
[1:23:12] message which is manifesting what that
[1:23:14] message actually spoke right it's a two
[1:23:17] totally different subjects one is yes
[1:23:19] I've received the message but the other
[1:23:21] has the message received
[1:23:24] you it's one thing to say I'm in the
[1:23:26] message but it's another thing to say
[1:23:27] the message is in
[1:23:32] me Saul was a chosen
[1:23:34] vessel and God had to kick him off his
[1:23:37] high horse right
[1:23:40] amen it was at that time Paul had to
[1:23:43] make a choice was he going to give up
[1:23:46] everything and be led by
[1:23:51] God I'll tell you what it took he had an
[1:23:54] he had so much
[1:23:56] pride some of us have too much pride yes
[1:24:00] to come to the Altar and say Lord have I
[1:24:02] been
[1:24:04] wrong have I been
[1:24:07] just trying to get by on what I already
[1:24:11] have come
[1:24:13] on alter is in our heart I'm not
[1:24:15] necessarily meaning this but there's a
[1:24:16] alter in our heart this is where things
[1:24:20] have to take place amen Paul never stop
[1:24:23] pressing in for more of the Holy
[1:24:26] Ghost because the true Holy Ghost keeps
[1:24:29] leading us to more of Christ when he the
[1:24:32] spirit of Truth come he will lead and
[1:24:33] guide you into all truth it isn't just
[1:24:35] oh the message is the truth okay I'm
[1:24:37] done no it now wants us to start living
[1:24:41] all of it right and it it and it only
[1:24:44] happens scarcely I it it happens with
[1:24:47] hard work it it takes a a lot of energy
[1:24:50] it takes I I I need more than what I
[1:24:53] have it can't be well you got to
[1:24:54] convince me you got to make me feel like
[1:24:56] I want you know what you're telling me
[1:24:57] I'm not a
[1:25:01] Salesman I'm not one to make you feel
[1:25:03] like you you need this I'm I'm just
[1:25:08] confessing I'm just delivering the word
[1:25:12] the word's the word I I do it out of
[1:25:14] love there's no doubt about that but I
[1:25:16] can't make you feel like doing the word
[1:25:18] because if I could the devil will come
[1:25:19] by a week later and get you to stop
[1:25:21] doing it
[1:25:22] right but if you receive the revelation
[1:25:25] of the word nothing can keep you from
[1:25:27] following the word
[1:25:29] nothing oh
[1:25:31] my how much time do you got
[1:25:37] today but I'm I'm only half
[1:25:45] done all right Philippi of Philippines
[1:25:50] Philippians Philippians chapter 3 I want
[1:25:52] you to read these scriptures with me
[1:25:54] because this is like
[1:25:56] Paul's after 33 years
[1:26:02] Paul he doesn't say I I don't need to go
[1:26:05] to the altar anymore I don't need to
[1:26:08] press in
[1:26:10] anymore verse 12 says not as though I've
[1:26:13] already attained or or either either
[1:26:15] were're already perfect but I follow
[1:26:18] after I'm still
[1:26:20] following I'm not saying you know I'm
[1:26:22] there I'm still following after if I may
[1:26:25] apprehend that for which also I am
[1:26:27] apprehended of Jesus Christ he knew that
[1:26:29] God got a hold of his life but something
[1:26:32] inside of him wanted to get a hold of
[1:26:33] God's
[1:26:34] life Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:26:37] apprehended but this one thing I do of
[1:26:39] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:26:42] me that's not just the bad things but
[1:26:44] those are the good things and reaching
[1:26:47] forth to those things which are before
[1:26:48] me I press towards the mark for the
[1:26:50] prize of the high calling in Christ
[1:26:52] Jesus let us therefore as many be
[1:26:54] perfect be thus
[1:26:56] minded and if in anything ye be
[1:26:59] otherwise minded God shall reveal even
[1:27:03] this unto you I say if you are God's
[1:27:07] chosen bride God will reveal to you what
[1:27:10] you need to press
[1:27:12] into believe that with all my heart
[1:27:15] nevertheless we're in two we have
[1:27:16] already attained now there's things that
[1:27:17] we have already attained if you've
[1:27:19] already been baptized in the correct
[1:27:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you
[1:27:23] don't you you don't need to do that
[1:27:25] again you've already attained to that
[1:27:27] but let us walk by the same rule let us
[1:27:30] have the same let us mind the same thing
[1:27:33] in other words there's still more for us
[1:27:35] to do even though we've been
[1:27:37] baptized come on Amen Brethren be ye
[1:27:40] followers together of
[1:27:43] me and mark them which walk so as you
[1:27:48] have us for an example thank God that
[1:27:51] Jesus Christ left us an example in
[1:27:54] Paul I have something to
[1:27:57] follow because you don't know how many
[1:27:59] people try to tell me something they
[1:28:01] were off the
[1:28:02] word come on can you imagine following
[1:28:06] somebody that's off the word what's
[1:28:08] going to happen to you the blind lead
[1:28:10] the blind they both fall in the ditch
[1:28:12] amen we have Paul for an example stay
[1:28:15] with it amen that's who brother brandham
[1:28:18] followed he said I preached what Paul
[1:28:21] preached right
[1:28:23] and he said we're all resting on that
[1:28:26] we're all resting on that all right look
[1:28:28] at this verse 18 for many walk not some
[1:28:32] not few for many walk of whom I've told
[1:28:34] you often and now tell you even weeping
[1:28:37] there was a heart here in Paul weeping
[1:28:40] that they are the enemies of the Cross
[1:28:43] of
[1:28:46] Christ W how do we know how do we know
[1:28:50] look it this is how we know know whose
[1:28:53] end is destruction whose God is their
[1:28:57] belly and whose glory is their shame and
[1:29:00] let's just wrap this all up who mine
[1:29:03] Earthly
[1:29:04] things their mind is down here their
[1:29:08] mind is not up
[1:29:11] here amen feeding themselves with this
[1:29:15] they're enemies of the Cross because the
[1:29:18] cross came not just to save
[1:29:23] God isn't going to have a bride that's
[1:29:24] just
[1:29:26] saved they're going to look at Jesus
[1:29:28] Christ as
[1:29:30] Lord and God demands that so much that
[1:29:33] every knee all of those Souls that go
[1:29:36] into Satan's kingdom are going to Bow
[1:29:38] their knee one day and they're going to
[1:29:41] confess with their mouth one day who is
[1:29:43] the real Lord
[1:29:45] amen right so I know it's in the heart
[1:29:48] of God that his
[1:29:50] bride
[1:29:55] has this relationship in which he's Lord
[1:29:57] in other words he's the the real head of
[1:29:59] their life the word is the real headship
[1:30:03] not just save me and give me everything
[1:30:05] I
[1:30:06] want
[1:30:10] but you are my everything verse uh 20
[1:30:13] for our conversation is in heaven from
[1:30:16] once we look for for our savior the Lord
[1:30:18] Jesus Christ who shall change our vile
[1:30:22] body that it may be fashioned unto his
[1:30:25] glorious body according to the working
[1:30:27] whereby he is able to subdue all things
[1:30:28] unto
[1:30:30] himself all right I love that there's
[1:30:32] the Rapture the changing of our Brethren
[1:30:34] of our bodies I mean now we need to give
[1:30:38] diligence keep seeking to possess more
[1:30:41] of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost
[1:30:44] is what will manifest more of God and
[1:30:46] our nature amen nothing else would do it
[1:30:49] you cannot train yourself to to to be
[1:30:51] like
[1:30:53] God now God is choosing how do I know
[1:30:57] I'm chosen God is choosing a bride who
[1:31:01] possesses the very same nature the very
[1:31:04] same love that he
[1:31:07] has not a feeling of love not an emotion
[1:31:11] not works of righteousness not knowledge
[1:31:13] not understanding he's looking for the
[1:31:16] same love inside his bride that he has
[1:31:18] towards her do you believe that say Amen
[1:31:21] because we got a lot of we got a lot of
[1:31:23] more hay in the fork yet as brother John
[1:31:25] le fontain would say St John chapter 15
[1:31:28] ver2 when we opened up with verse 16 but
[1:31:31] I want to turn to verse 12 Jesus said
[1:31:33] now this is you you'll notice he starts
[1:31:35] here and he says this is my commandment
[1:31:37] and he says it at the end in verse 17 so
[1:31:39] let's capture this whole thing this is
[1:31:41] my commandment that you love one another
[1:31:43] as I have loved you right now here's the
[1:31:47] thing if I brother Ryan you know you're
[1:31:50] close I just you know if I love brother
[1:31:54] Ron because he you know he gives me his
[1:31:57] tie when I want it and um he takes me
[1:32:01] out to dinner and um he brings me double
[1:32:04] stuff
[1:32:05] Orioles
[1:32:07] and I have my reasons for loving him oh
[1:32:11] Bo I I can just I I'm gonna just do this
[1:32:13] great thing for brother Ron because I
[1:32:15] love him and the Bible says I got to
[1:32:18] love
[1:32:19] him but if he steps on my toe
[1:32:24] puts a knife in my back does something
[1:32:26] behind me to hurt me to kill my
[1:32:28] influence and I still don't love him the
[1:32:31] very same and I'm not loving him the way
[1:32:34] that Christ loved me
[1:32:36] right so this is not a commandment of we
[1:32:39] need to try to love one another more
[1:32:41] this is we need to get God's love in Us
[1:32:43] in order to love in order to obey that
[1:32:47] commandment and he says here in verse 13
[1:32:49] Greater Love have no man than this than
[1:32:50] a man laid down his life for his friends
[1:32:53] amen and you are my friends if you do
[1:32:57] whatsoever I command you
[1:33:01] Amen in other words you don't do what
[1:33:04] God asked you to
[1:33:10] do no
[1:33:12] friendship that's what he said
[1:33:14] henceforth I call you not servants but
[1:33:17] uh for servants know uh knoweth not what
[1:33:20] his Lord doeth but I have called you
[1:33:21] friends for all things that I have heard
[1:33:23] of my father I have made known unto you
[1:33:25] you have not chosen
[1:33:28] me you didn't have nothing to do with it
[1:33:31] but I have chosen you and I've ordained
[1:33:33] you that you should go forth and bring
[1:33:35] forth fruit that your fruit should
[1:33:36] remain and that whatsoever you shall ask
[1:33:38] in my in the father's name in ask of the
[1:33:42] father in my name he may give it to you
[1:33:44] these things I command you comma that ye
[1:33:48] love one another amen do you
[1:33:52] see that he has chosen
[1:33:56] you and ordained you to bring forth a
[1:34:00] fruit of loving the way he loves
[1:34:05] yes so forget about saying I'm
[1:34:08] predestined I'm chosen I'm elected start
[1:34:11] looking at your life and say how can I
[1:34:14] love the way he loves Lord fill me with
[1:34:16] more of you because until we get there
[1:34:20] everything else is a smoke screen and it
[1:34:22] don't mean anything it's a distraction
[1:34:24] to the real it's a distraction to the
[1:34:27] real we need the love of God so strong
[1:34:30] that whatever is put before us we can
[1:34:32] handle
[1:34:36] it Jesus is expressing that this is his
[1:34:40] love it's not our love for God it's his
[1:34:42] love inside of us our love is
[1:34:46] selfish right amen wrong motives respect
[1:34:49] to
[1:34:50] persons but God's love it's without
[1:34:53] respect to persons the bride is the only
[1:34:56] group that's been ordained to love the
[1:34:59] way that God's love right think about
[1:35:02] that everybody else's love is
[1:35:05] less
[1:35:07] wow she's the only one that's been
[1:35:09] ordained to go forth and bring forth the
[1:35:12] fruit of God's love everybody else stop
[1:35:15] short Jesus said a new commandment I
[1:35:17] give you that you love one another as I
[1:35:19] have loved you that you also love one
[1:35:21] another by this shall
[1:35:24] all men know that you are my disciples
[1:35:29] if you have love one for another right
[1:35:32] all men that means your enemies yes the
[1:35:35] people who hate you the people accuse
[1:35:37] you the people who say you know what I
[1:35:39] don't think this of
[1:35:41] you
[1:35:43] somehow God wants to get inside of
[1:35:46] you and manifest his love
[1:35:50] amen
[1:35:52] now what is God looking for in his bride
[1:35:54] he's looking for character more specific
[1:35:57] his character his nature his love his
[1:36:00] will his word brother Bram said it's the
[1:36:03] only thing that we're taking with us
[1:36:05] when we leave and he also said only
[1:36:07] perfect love can enter in there so we
[1:36:09] can conclude that character must be
[1:36:12] perfect love
[1:36:16] right okay what is that it's power to
[1:36:19] lay down our life right yes for those we
[1:36:23] think are worthy and for those that we
[1:36:25] think are unworthy that's
[1:36:27] correct power to lay down our lives for
[1:36:30] those that we think are good and for
[1:36:32] those that we think are not good for
[1:36:35] those who we love and for those who
[1:36:38] despitefully use us for those who bless
[1:36:41] us and for those who curse
[1:36:43] us we have power to lay down our life
[1:36:46] for both we don't sit there and say well
[1:36:48] I'm having a hard time with this person
[1:36:51] when you have God's love you don't have
[1:36:53] a hard time amen when you have your when
[1:36:57] you have your love you have a hard
[1:37:01] time we know power without character is
[1:37:04] what Satan satanic so let's it what does
[1:37:07] that really mean this is the John Martin
[1:37:10] version here free more agency to choose
[1:37:13] without submission to God's word is
[1:37:16] satanic because that's the very nature
[1:37:18] we were born with to do our will amen
[1:37:23] the nature we were born with now brother
[1:37:24] brand said in the message going through
[1:37:26] some quick quotes here at the
[1:37:29] end brother brand says I've been more
[1:37:31] determined to do everything I can to
[1:37:33] persuade men and women please be sure of
[1:37:37] this now he's talking about when he got
[1:37:39] back from the curtain of
[1:37:40] time he says I've been more determined
[1:37:42] to do everything that I can to persuade
[1:37:45] men and women he says please be sure of
[1:37:49] this colon if God's love doesn't anchor
[1:37:53] in your heart
[1:37:55] supremely don't you take any sensation
[1:37:58] or motion right you be sure that you can
[1:38:02] turn the other
[1:38:03] cheek that Christ is all and all in you
[1:38:08] he said don't miss it my brother he says
[1:38:11] just remember I'll say this with Faith
[1:38:15] that I had in that Vision whatever it
[1:38:17] was I speak it in the name of the Lord
[1:38:20] except you have that perfect love you'll
[1:38:23] never be
[1:38:26] there cuz nothing could ever be there
[1:38:28] without it he says your spirit would be
[1:38:30] out of place there it couldn't come
[1:38:33] there you ever be you ever were were you
[1:38:35] ever around a spirit you felt
[1:38:36] uncomfortable
[1:38:39] with do you think God wants to have a
[1:38:42] spirit outside of perfect love in heaven
[1:38:45] we need to be serious about this not not
[1:38:48] just say well I feel like I got it I I I
[1:38:50] try to have it
[1:38:52] no brother bam said lay everything else
[1:38:55] you got going in your life lay it aside

[1:38:59] your heart hungers for it God will give
[1:39:02] it to you you knock you seek God will
[1:39:04] give you the love of God is shed abroad
[1:39:08] in Your Heart by the Holy Ghost when you
[1:39:10] seek the Holy Ghost you're getting the
[1:39:12] love of God
[1:39:13] Amen that's why people are so deceived
[1:39:16] they think well I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:39:18] oh
[1:39:20] my look you don't ever have to tell
[1:39:22] anybody you got the Holy
[1:39:27] Ghost you're a written epistle read of
[1:39:30] all men somebody that's been trained in
[1:39:33] the The Gospel they know whether it's
[1:39:35] the right Spirit or not
[1:39:38] amen he said your spirit would be out of
[1:39:41] place there it couldn't come there
[1:39:42] there'd be no way for it to come no more
[1:39:44] than it would be for a grain of corn to
[1:39:46] rise up out of the ground without a germ
[1:39:48] of life in it no matter how natural it
[1:39:50] would look it could not rise my friend
[1:39:52] you old people you young people you
[1:39:55] don't know what time you're going to
[1:39:56] leave
[1:39:58] here we don't know that but let me
[1:40:01] persuade you as a Christian brother that
[1:40:03] loves you except you're born again and
[1:40:07] the spirit of God of love and I so glad
[1:40:11] he put it like that the spirit of God of
[1:40:14] love comes into your heart you'll
[1:40:17] certainly miss that
[1:40:19] place
[1:40:22] amen it's word brother Braham said
[1:40:25] accepting God's provided way at the end
[1:40:27] time he said I is not seen ear is not
[1:40:29] heard quoting the scripture neither is
[1:40:31] it entered to the heart of men what God
[1:40:33] has for them in store that love him yes
[1:40:37] oh just to look past the curtain of time
[1:40:40] then I've tried harder than ever before
[1:40:43] in my life to try to win people to
[1:40:44] Christ since then he says you can't
[1:40:46] afford to miss it don't do it be sure
[1:40:49] you're right with God and and other
[1:40:51] things will be all right look we got
[1:40:55] enough we have we all have
[1:41:01] enough
[1:41:03] sin
[1:41:04] garbage things that have happened in our
[1:41:06] life that we're not proud
[1:41:09] of to certainly miss it on some sort of
[1:41:16] Merit so forget about how good we are
[1:41:19] right or we're a little bit better than
[1:41:22] soand so what we need is just to Humble
[1:41:25] ourselves and say God I know what I need
[1:41:27] is more Holy Ghost right amen
[1:41:32] amen in the message leadership brother B
[1:41:35] says you're either for God or against
[1:41:38] God and the outward expression shows
[1:41:41] what's on the inside now it doesn't
[1:41:43] always show it
[1:41:46] right because you a teabag is is
[1:41:51] revealed when it's in hot
[1:41:54] water so it's when you're going through
[1:41:56] trials that show what's on the inside
[1:41:58] it's when you go through trials that
[1:41:59] shows what's really on the Inside Yes
[1:42:01] amen okay many of you think I got the
[1:42:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm going
[1:42:05] to
[1:42:06] heaven he said that don't mean one thing
[1:42:10] that you're going to heaven he said no
[1:42:12] sir now he said this in December of
[1:42:15] 65 so it wasn't like he lived 10 more
[1:42:18] years after this this this is after the
[1:42:20] culmination of his whole understanding
[1:42:23] and and Ministry and with the things
[1:42:24] that God had revealed to him right here
[1:42:26] at the
[1:42:27] end many of you think I've got the
[1:42:29] baptism of Holy Ghost and I'm going to
[1:42:31] heaven but that don't mean one thing
[1:42:32] that you're going to heaven so how do I
[1:42:33] know I'm
[1:42:35] chosen you can only have he says you can
[1:42:39] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[1:42:42] hour in your life and still be lost and
[1:42:45] go to
[1:42:47] hell how is that how is that because
[1:42:52] we're a Triune
[1:42:53] being we can feel the Holy Spirit on the
[1:42:56] outside and it feels
[1:42:58] good it does we can have the the Holy
[1:43:03] Spirit on that inner realm and and cry
[1:43:07] crocodile
[1:43:08] tears and feel the emotion of God's
[1:43:12] presence that doesn't mean it's hit the
[1:43:15] inside of the inside because the inside
[1:43:17] of the inside is where your nature is
[1:43:20] generated
[1:43:22] from all right I'm going to just wanted
[1:43:25] to say that before I read this look here
[1:43:27] you are an outside person you have five
[1:43:30] senses that contact the outside of your
[1:43:32] body God gave you five senses not to I
[1:43:36] love this not to contact
[1:43:39] him you know Thomas wanted to see it
[1:43:42] right not to contact him but your
[1:43:45] Earthly home to contact one another
[1:43:47] right see taste feel smell and hear
[1:43:50] right then you have a spirit on the
[1:43:53] inside of that and it has five Outlets
[1:43:57] conscious and love and so forth five
[1:43:59] outlets and that contact the spirit
[1:44:03] world with that but with your spirit
[1:44:07] your physical contacts physical your
[1:44:08] spirit contacts spiritual but inside of
[1:44:11] that you've got a soul
[1:44:15] yes and that soul is that Gene that came
[1:44:21] from God yes amen now here's the thing
[1:44:25] if you believe that you are that Gene of
[1:44:28] God then why is it so hard for you to
[1:44:32] battle giving your life more to the word
[1:44:34] and saying God I got to become that word
[1:44:36] if you're the gene of God you will want
[1:44:38] to be that word you will want to give up
[1:44:41] the things of this world you will get
[1:44:43] serious with the word
[1:44:46] amen
[1:44:49] true I love love this message I'd be
[1:44:52] lost without this message this message
[1:44:54] was sent to get us ready
[1:44:58] amen he says and he's he's going on next
[1:45:01] verse or
[1:45:02] next paragraph here he says and like a
[1:45:04] baby formed in a mother's womb when the
[1:45:07] baby comes into the mother's wom by a
[1:45:09] little germ it crawls into the
[1:45:13] egg and it doesn't form one cell a human
[1:45:17] and then a next a dog and then a next a
[1:45:20] cat and then next a horse it's all human
[1:45:25] cells because it's building off the
[1:45:28] ariginal human
[1:45:30] cell it's building it's adding add to
[1:45:35] your faith virtue amen it's a it's a
[1:45:37] continually building you because you've
[1:45:39] been predestinated to be predestinated
[1:45:42] to come into the image of Jesus Christ
[1:45:44] it's a constant
[1:45:47] building and when a man
[1:45:51] has been born again by the word of God
[1:45:54] predestinated to eternal life called the
[1:45:58] elected yes it will be word of God on
[1:46:01] top of word word on word not a church
[1:46:05] Creed and then word and then Creed it
[1:46:09] won't work it can't have that leaven in
[1:46:13] it only one eternal life that's Jesus
[1:46:16] Christ the word
[1:46:18] yes he got to get rid of our thinking
[1:46:21] amen get rid of our ideas and get
[1:46:23] serious about God I have a hunger for
[1:46:25] this word I have a hunger to become this
[1:46:27] word it don't happen over
[1:46:30] time people have been in this message
[1:46:32] for I don't know how many years and then
[1:46:34] they leave the message right it ain't
[1:46:36] about coming to church and being
[1:46:39] faithful and that's
[1:46:41] it to me being faithful is the
[1:46:44] foundation if you can't be faithful you
[1:46:47] ain't going anywhere with God
[1:46:51] but you've got to do more than just come
[1:46:53] to church you've got to receive the word
[1:46:56] amen when you receive it you become
[1:47:03] it Jesus said if a man love me he will
[1:47:05] keep my
[1:47:07] words if a man loveed me he will keep my
[1:47:09] words and my father will love him and we
[1:47:12] will come unto him and make our bold
[1:47:13] there I just I don't got time I'm sorry
[1:47:16] that it's this late but in Deuteronomy I
[1:47:18] believe it's chapter 7
[1:47:21] Jesus said or God said I've have not
[1:47:24] chosen you because you were the greatest
[1:47:27] among all the people on the planet the
[1:47:30] greatest he said no you were the fewest
[1:47:32] he says I chose you because I love you
[1:47:36] right that's why he chose us amen now
[1:47:40] here he said if now don't you think he's
[1:47:44] going to choose a bride that loves him
[1:47:46] the same amen can you imagine being
[1:47:48] married to somebody you believe in
[1:47:51] giving but your spouse believes no I
[1:47:54] don't I don't think we should
[1:47:56] give I think we should only give to
[1:47:58] those who we want to give
[1:48:00] to can you imagine we're married to
[1:48:03] Jesus and we say no I I don't think you
[1:48:05] should be that nice to that person over
[1:48:08] there I don't I I don't I never got
[1:48:11] along with them on the
[1:48:13] planet you think he wants to be married
[1:48:16] to that no no he wants to be married to
[1:48:18] someone that looks up to him and

[1:48:29] serve like you I give like
[1:48:32] you that's who he he wants to marry he
[1:48:35] wants to marry someone that's just like
[1:48:38] him amen it does not appear but we know
[1:48:42] that when he shall appear we shall be
[1:48:44] like him for we shall see him as he
[1:48:47] is now I'll tell you if we we love God
[1:48:51] this is what he says if a man love me he
[1:48:54] will keep my word
[1:48:56] amen and my father will love him and we
[1:48:59] will come onto him and make our abold
[1:49:04] right how many people are claiming God's

[1:49:09] life and they're not subject to the word
[1:49:13] it doesn't matter what we

[1:49:35] 33-39 if you've got God's love in your
[1:49:38] heart nothing can separate you from it
[1:49:41] amen but if you just got your love in
[1:49:43] your heart for God you'll be separated
[1:49:47] right but God's love
[1:49:50] nothing can separate you when you have
[1:49:53] God's love inside your heart am brother

[1:50:06] God I know that with all my heart and
[1:50:09] tonight brother I couldn't help it if
[1:50:11] he'd condemned me at the end of the road
[1:50:16] and say William brandom you go to
[1:50:19] hell
[1:50:20] and I'd go down there into the pits of
[1:50:23] hell if there is such a thing as love
[1:50:26] there I would love him
[1:50:31] there and he says I couldn't help it
[1:50:36] what is he saying that there's something
[1:50:39] inside of him that's
[1:50:43] controlling he's first yes I love him my
[1:50:48] allegiance is to the word of God not to
[1:50:50] a church not to a Creed not to money not
[1:50:53] to popular not to what I can get out of
[1:50:55] life but my allegiance he's I I can't
[1:50:59] preach I'm not
[1:51:02] worthy but I'd love him there amen you
[1:51:05] tell me what's
[1:51:06] important you tell me what's
[1:51:08] important all the things that we think
[1:51:11] are
[1:51:13] important to love the Lord thy God with
[1:51:15] all thy heart with all thy soul with all
[1:51:17] thy might that's what's important amen
[1:51:20] that's what he's calling us
[1:51:23] to my last quote can you say Amen praise
[1:51:27] the Lord Brother
[1:51:29] John in questions and answers brother
[1:51:31] Brandon says but I don't deserve the
[1:51:33] Lord because I you know he's I don't
[1:51:36] deserve the Lord because I think he'd
[1:51:38] send me to hell if I
[1:51:40] didn't I'm sorry I am so sorry he says
[1:51:44] but I don't serve the Lord because I
[1:51:47] think he'd send me the hell if I didn't
[1:51:49] I serve him because I love him I serve
[1:51:52] him because there's something in me if
[1:51:55] you go out and say well I have to quit
[1:51:57] doing this and and because my church
[1:51:59] don't believe in it he says you're just
[1:52:02] playing the part of a hypocrite he said
[1:52:04] that's right but if you do it because
[1:52:08] you that you love to and it's a
[1:52:10] contribution to God and something that's
[1:52:12] in your heart making now look at this
[1:52:15] something in your heart making the love
[1:52:18] of God so great greater to
[1:52:22] you than these things now you're on the
[1:52:26] right line see it has to be the love of
[1:52:29] God inside of
[1:52:32] you but if I didn't drink and smoke and
[1:52:35] chew and cuss and do these things I'd
[1:52:37] still go to hell
