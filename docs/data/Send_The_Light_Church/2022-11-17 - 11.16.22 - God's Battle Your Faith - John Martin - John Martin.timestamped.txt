[15:52] yes yes
[16:03] foreign
[16:42] thank you
[16:47] oh my God okay
[16:51] she was either here our immune system
[16:54] could beat it or she was going to
[16:55] basically die
[16:56] like
[16:58] too bad imagine
[17:00] and uh the mom called my buddy while we
[17:04] were driving and she's just gone and
[17:07] this is his ex and he's looking at me
[17:10] like nice
[17:11] basically and I just said do you believe
[17:13] in God yeah and I said stop speaking of
[17:17] it and I just kind of review what the
[17:20] doctor said and the Lord just filled my
[17:23] mouth and I started speaking scripture
[17:24] and truth and I said you know that the
[17:28] sickness is just the name and I know
[17:29] that I know someone who is prettier than
[17:32] any sickness and I spoke these things
[17:34] the next morning and I were going
[17:37] hunting and the model called them and
[17:40] they called him back because he was
[17:41] trying to find out how his daughter was
[17:42] and she said she still has a very low
[17:46] grade fever she only coughed a little
[17:47] bit this morning but she's doing great
[17:50] um one of the testimonies when I was on
[17:52] the phone with her I told her I said you
[17:53] know they're giving her these vitamins
[17:55] and rotate motor
[17:58] when I got off the phone Eddie was
[18:00] looking like a deer in the headlights
[18:01] because the mountain said okay to me and
[18:03] he goes well how did you do that and I
[18:05] said what do you mean it was she will
[18:07] not allow anyone who work Court battle
[18:09] right now
[18:10] right now me and my wife gave her a
[18:11] Tylenol a military
[18:13] She is totally against it and she just
[18:15] agreed with you with you and is doing it
[18:18] but she got him and you know as of today
[18:22] she's even doing better but she
[18:24] literally she's on her deathbed two
[18:26] nights ago two days ago and she's my
[18:28] whatever he and I was like
[18:30] as of this morning
[18:33] just a lemon low grade like 98.
[18:36] very low grade barely coffin anymore
[18:39] and for a doctor to say you know this is
[18:41] really touching though like there's
[18:43] nothing else we can do for her
[18:45] immune system's either going to fight it
[18:47] or not
[18:49] the other thing I wanted to mention
[18:51] um is I really want to encourage
[18:54] everyone to listen to the teams
[18:58] there's power in the case
[19:02] but it's hunting season and you know I
[19:06] reflected on a message that
[19:09] president spoke about
[19:11] um it was sitting on a log he was in an
[19:13] area where there wasn't a certain type
[19:15] of squirrel and so on and so forth and
[19:17] basically the ward said well just
[19:19] you know believe that it's going to come
[19:21] up on that log basically and it'll be
[19:23] there and not even told them that the
[19:25] the number the will this the number that
[19:27] he wanted for the you know the meal that
[19:29] night or whatever it would be well
[19:31] yesterday the night before game or one
[19:34] of the kids said dad we'll help you get
[19:36] a deer tomorrow and I said I'm gonna get
[19:37] two
[19:39] and I just said it I knew it and I felt
[19:42] like God said it
[19:43] well yeah we both got it here we got you
[19:46] man I said it again yesterday
[19:50] this morning as soon as light broke too
[19:54] in in the one step today that I took
[19:58] above yesterday was I willed where they
[20:01] were going to come in and they came in
[20:02] right where I said they were going to
[20:04] come in
[20:04] Andy's looking at me like I mean he
[20:07] believes in God whatever but he's
[20:08] looking at me like dude how do you know
[20:10] how many we're gonna get and I literally
[20:12] said as soon as first light they're
[20:14] coming in yesterday I said at 8 30 8 30.
[20:19] so

[20:25] through the messages like that's the
[20:26] only thing you do and even my back is
[20:28] getting better and I believe my stomach
[20:31] issues are getting better but one thing

[34:09] amen
[34:12] well one thing I want to do I got some
[34:15] things written down because I usually
[34:17] forget
[34:19] so many things if I don't write them
[34:21] down
[34:23] but I want to thank each and every one
[34:25] of you who had given me birthday wishes
[34:28] today
[34:30] uh
[34:31] I turned 31 years old
[34:34] as brother Brennan would say for the
[34:36] second time
[34:38] so
[34:40] thank you for making my day
[34:44] as blessed as it was
[34:48] and also I wanted to think publicly
[34:50] and express
[34:52] a gratitude to all those who showed
[34:55] their appreciation
[34:56] uh to me last month
[34:59] I know I told each one individually but
[35:02] just publicly it I wanted to say thank
[35:04] you may God bless you
[35:07] pray for me that I could do a better job
[35:11] for you that's my sincere prayer as a
[35:14] pastor uh brother Timothy Sean surgery
[35:18] went well
[35:19] and
[35:21] um he appreciates everyone's prayers for
[35:24] him and so as he's recovering we still
[35:28] want to hold him up in prayer
[35:31] uh brother Jason Demars had got home
[35:34] last night from Turkey
[35:37] um he wanted to say thank you for all of
[35:40] your prayers as well and uh just to kind
[35:43] of give you an idea that the
[35:45] circumstances in Turkey are very
[35:47] difficult they're very very hard and
[35:51] trying to work behind the scenes to make
[35:55] things uh flow he needs our prayers for
[35:59] wisdom and Leadership of the Lord
[36:01] because it is not an easy work
[36:04] so if we could just remember remember
[36:06] him in prayer another announcement is
[36:11] there will be no service next Wednesday
[36:14] no service next Wednesday because of
[36:18] Thanksgiving on Thursday
[36:21] um
[36:21] and if anybody on the live stream would
[36:25] like to hear Brother Jonathan's
[36:29] testimony
[36:30] I think we're going to have to you're
[36:32] going to have to hear directly from him
[36:34] because I don't think it made it through
[36:35] to the uh the live streams I think maybe
[36:40] we just give who's ever given
[36:41] testimonies we've got to get them a
[36:42] microphone just give them a microphone
[36:43] and uh you know
[36:46] who if if they don't get it grab them
[36:48] one and uh because I I there's a good
[36:52] good I'm sure a good testimony and I
[36:55] want everybody to hear that so they're
[36:56] gonna have to hear it from him
[36:58] personally amen
[37:00] well we uh we want to just talk about
[37:05] where we need to be in the midst of of
[37:07] our battles anybody ever been in a
[37:09] battle before
[37:11] I think it's ironic in our opening
[37:14] scripture here that uh the Bible says
[37:17] that Israel in the Philistines had put
[37:21] the battle in a ray but God says no the
[37:27] battle
[37:27] is his
[37:30] and um I think it's a way that we we we
[37:33] look at it if we could just do some a
[37:37] Bible reading here I would like to start
[37:38] with verse number 32 of first Samuel
[37:41] chapter 17.
[37:43] and David said to Saul
[37:47] let no man's heart fail because of him
[37:53] thy servant will go and fight this
[37:57] Philistine so here we are I want us to
[37:59] think about all the battles that we go
[38:01] through the the hardships the things
[38:03] that we wish were in our life or
[38:06] something we're trying to overcome
[38:07] something we're trying to get delivered
[38:08] of something that is a battle to us
[38:12] and
[38:15] um
[38:16] oh
[38:18] we are are looking for something to have
[38:24] this not in our life
[38:26] to have this battle not here
[38:29] the battle is there because God had
[38:33] allowed it to be there
[38:36] just like this battle with David and
[38:39] Goliath well really it was against ills
[38:42] Israel uh in in the Philistines but God
[38:46] wanted to get Glory through the
[38:48] situation and I believe every battle
[38:49] that we have God wants to give get Glory
[38:52] through the battle we just got to see
[38:55] God uh is in it and not run away from it
[39:00] but to to be the one that says we will
[39:04] go fight this Philistine fight this
[39:06] battle now now I want you to understand
[39:09] the battle is the Lord's
[39:13] he wants us to fight the good fight of
[39:17] faith
[39:18] and and if you can catch that you've got
[39:21] the message tonight
[39:24] and Saul said to David Thou Art not able
[39:27] to go against this Philistine to fight
[39:30] how many times has as the devil told us
[39:33] that right with him for thou art but a
[39:36] youth and he's a man of war from his
[39:40] Youth and David said unto Saul thy
[39:42] servant kept his father's sheep and
[39:45] there came a lion and a bear and took a
[39:47] lamb out of the flock and I went out
[39:48] after him and smold him and delivered
[39:51] and delivered it out of his mouth and
[39:54] when he arose against me I called him by
[39:57] the beard and smold him and slew him so
[40:00] here we are he is giving testimonies of
[40:03] how God has used his faith in the past
[40:07] because that's what we got to think
[40:09] about when we're in a battle
[40:11] it's a not how big the battle is not how
[40:14] big the problem is but how much God has
[40:16] used Us in the past because that will
[40:19] actually activate our faith so he's he's
[40:22] given testimony amen
[40:25] thy servant slew both The Lion and the
[40:28] bear and the uncircum and this
[40:30] uncircumcised philosin shall be as one
[40:32] of them see God's gonna come forth in
[40:36] this situation as well
[40:38] seeing here defied the armies of the
[40:40] Living God this is what you got to think
[40:42] about that when you're going through
[40:44] massive trials that you're a Son of God
[40:47] you're a daughter of God you belong to
[40:49] God and the devil has no right amen you
[40:54] gotta you gotta take a stand you gotta
[40:56] testify
[40:59] David said moreover
[41:02] the Paul of the lion uh
[41:05] the Lord that delivered me out of the
[41:07] Paul of the lion and out of the Paul of
[41:09] the bear he would deliver me out of the
[41:12] hand of the philistine
[41:13] and Saul said unto David go and the Lord
[41:16] be with thee and Saul arm David with his
[41:19] armor and he put a helmet a brass upon
[41:23] his head and armed him with a coat of
[41:26] mail and David girded his sword upon his
[41:31] armor and he aside to go
[41:35] and he had not proven it for he had not
[41:39] proven it and David said unto Saul I
[41:43] cannot go with these for I have not
[41:45] proven them and David put them off of
[41:49] him now of course we've heard this story
[41:52] so many times and these types so many
[41:54] times but so often when we go to deal
[41:57] with a problem we come with our own
[41:59] reasoning our own understanding our own
[42:02] thoughts our our own abilities our own
[42:05] trust in in our self or another man
[42:08] another man's idea and and
[42:12] they're not proven
[42:15] what's proven is what God speaks that's
[42:18] proven
[42:21] and he took his staff in his hand and
[42:23] chose him five stones out of the brook
[42:27] and put them in the shepherd's bag which
[42:30] he had even in a script
[42:33] and his sling was in his hand and he
[42:36] drew near to the Philistine I want you
[42:38] to understand that nothing was said from
[42:43] Kings from Saul to go get stones
[42:47] there was nothing there given
[42:51] to David to go get these Stones outside
[42:54] of God
[42:57] faith comes from God
[42:59] confidence in in defeating the giant
[43:02] inner life comes from God it doesn't
[43:05] come from man it doesn't come from man's
[43:07] ideas or this is what I think we should
[43:09] do it has nothing to do with that
[43:12] we've got to hear from God Alone
[43:15] and the Philistine came and Drew near
[43:18] unto David and the man that bear The
[43:21] Shield went before him
[43:23] and when the Philistine looked about and
[43:27] saw David he disdained him oh my for he
[43:32] was but a youth in Ruddy and fair and
[43:35] about Fair countenance and the
[43:36] Philistines said unto David and I a dog
[43:40] that thou cometh to me with staves
[43:45] and the Philistine cursed David by his
[43:48] God do you ever have anybody curse you
[43:50] come on you can see that is of the devil
[43:54] and the Philistine said to David come to
[43:56] me
[43:57] uh said to said to David come to me and
[44:00] I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of
[44:04] the air and to the Beast of the field
[44:06] now this is Satan trying to tell you
[44:09] that you are going to be devoured
[44:12] through this trial
[44:15] it's exactly what's happening
[44:18] then said David to the Philistine thou
[44:21] cometh to me with a sword and with a
[44:23] spear and with a shield
[44:26] but I come to thee in the name of the
[44:28] Lord of hosts the god of the armies of
[44:31] Israel whom thou has defiled
[44:35] I want you to think about this when
[44:37] Satan is tormenting you he's tormenting
[44:41] God's possession
[44:43] you're not just a nobody you're not just
[44:47] you're not just something that you feel
[44:49] when you're going through a trial which
[44:51] is hardly nothing
[44:53] but your God's chosen you're his bride
[44:57] and so when the Devil comes to you lying
[45:00] to you you've got to you've got to you
[45:03] got to stand like David stood knowing
[45:05] that the devil is defying what God has
[45:09] has given you has promised you and and
[45:12] who you are
[45:14] said this day well I will the Lord
[45:16] deliver thee into my hand and I will
[45:19] smite thee and take thy head from thee
[45:22] and I will give thee uh give the carcass
[45:26] of holes to the Philistine this day unto
[45:28] the fowls of the air and to the wild
[45:30] beasts of the earth and all the Earth
[45:33] that all the Earth may know that there's
[45:35] a God in Israel not what I love about
[45:37] this is is that God is showing us what
[45:41] David's motive was
[45:44] he wasn't trying to get Glory he wasn't
[45:47] trying to show off
[45:49] he was he was really wanting everyone to
[45:53] see the glory of God
[45:57] and that that was his mold of and and
[46:00] that must remain our motive that God
[46:03] receives Glory because this is the whole
[46:05] reason that God allowed this situation
[46:07] to take place
[46:10] this is why God allowed the the the the
[46:13] the the uh
[46:15] uh the armies of Egypt to come after the
[46:20] children of Israel is because God wanted
[46:23] to get glory in the situation
[46:26] and
[46:27] yes there was a battle then and there's
[46:29] a battle here and there is a battle in
[46:31] our life
[46:33] but God wants to get Glory out of it and
[46:35] if he don't get Glory out of it I don't
[46:37] I I don't feel that he's going to be
[46:40] favorable about the outcome
[46:42] or how we're going about doing it he
[46:45] wants all the glory he don't want any
[46:47] Glory going to ourselves none of it
[46:52] he doesn't want to share Glory with any
[46:55] flesh amen
[46:57] he wants us to go wow
[46:59] wow God you're amazing
[47:02] God you're amazing
[47:08] um
[47:09] verse 47 and all this assembly shall
[47:13] know
[47:14] that the Lord saveth not with
[47:17] things that you see naturally sword and
[47:22] spear for the battle is the Lord's and
[47:24] he will give you into our hands
[47:29] wow I just think this is this is so
[47:33] humble and so amazing
[47:36] that
[47:37] that
[47:38] David was David could put himself in the
[47:44] place of being used by God but at the
[47:47] same time
[47:49] it wasn't him it was God's battle
[47:54] it was God's battle and it was David's
[47:57] faith
[47:59] too often
[48:01] we're succumbed by the battle we feel
[48:04] that we're in a battle we're in a battle
[48:05] we need to start testifying this is the
[48:07] Lord's battle
[48:09] this is the Lord's battle you want to
[48:12] claim something claim faith in God claim
[48:14] faith in God that he's going to take you
[48:16] through
[48:21] God has always want to
[48:23] to show
[48:25] his abilities and His glory
[48:30] come on
[48:31] all right there's another story it's in
[48:33] second
[48:34] Chronicles chapter 20.
[48:39] Second Chronicles chapter 20.
[48:47] we're just laying a foundation a Bible
[48:50] study Foundation
[48:53] I want to start with verse number one
[48:58] and it came to pass
[48:59] after this also that the children of
[49:02] Moab and the children of Ammon
[49:06] and with them other beside the amorites
[49:09] came against Jehoshaphat
[49:12] to battle so I want you to picture
[49:15] all these
[49:17] problems coming into your life all these
[49:20] Spirits all these people coming against
[49:22] you
[49:24] Then There came some that told
[49:26] Jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great
[49:29] multitude against thee from Beyond the
[49:32] Sea on this side of Syria and behold
[49:36] they be in hazards on Tamar which is
[49:44] and Jehoshaphat feared
[49:48] and set himself to seek the Lord and
[49:52] proclaim a fast throughout you to now I
[49:54] want you to look at the attitude that
[49:57] Jehoshaphat
[49:59] brother Brandon says that's not the
[50:00] action that happens to you but how you
[50:02] react this is so mightily important
[50:07] of course he feared the situation he
[50:11] came upon him this great problem Came
[50:13] Upon him but he set himself to seek the
[50:18] Lord that's the a number one thing to do
[50:21] and and just proclaim a fast
[50:26] it's okay your family if you've got a
[50:29] close brother and sister you know
[50:31] willing to uh you have confidence in
[50:34] them they'll fast with you and Judah
[50:36] gathered themselves together to as help
[50:39] of the Lord
[50:41] even out of all the cities of Judah they
[50:44] came to seek the Lord
[50:46] and Jehoshaphat stood in the
[50:48] congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in
[50:51] the house of the Lord before the new
[50:53] court
[50:54] and said oh now look at to the way he's
[50:57] talking to him oh Lord God of our
[51:00] fathers
[51:01] art now art not thou God in heaven and
[51:06] ruleth not thou over all the kingdoms of
[51:10] the heathens
[51:13] and thine hand is there not power and
[51:18] might
[51:19] so that none is able to withstand you
[51:24] are not art not thou Our God who did his
[51:28] drive out the inhabitants of the land
[51:30] before thy People Israel and gave us
[51:34] it to the Seed of Abraham thy friend
[51:37] forever
[51:39] oh he is he is really entering in with
[51:42] great sincerity great
[51:46] um seriousness his whole heart is here
[51:49] God I'm being open and honest with you
[51:54] and thou dwelt therein and have built
[51:57] thee a sanctuary then for thy name same
[52:00] if when evil cometh upon us as the sword
[52:04] judgment pestilence and famine we stand
[52:07] before this house and in thy presence
[52:09] for thy name is in this house and cry
[52:15] unto thee in our Affliction then thou
[52:19] will hear and help
[52:22] too often we're not willing to do that
[52:28] God knows
[52:29] God knows
[52:31] he must want me
[52:35] I think God wants us to cry out
[52:40] we want God to help
[52:42] but we don't want to cry out
[52:45] and it's part of the relationship that
[52:48] we have with God he we got to do our
[52:50] part
[52:51] it's part of being humble and I need you
[52:55] can you imagine if you're you're you as
[52:59] a father and you as a mother if your
[53:01] children never said to you
[53:04] I need you
[53:06] if they never cried out and said
[53:09] I need help
[53:12] you wouldn't feel that important part of
[53:14] being a parent with them
[53:16] right
[53:19] God
[53:20] don't want us murmuring complaining
[53:22] about our problems he one is crying out
[53:25] to him and saying God I need you
[53:29] it's the attitude that we have in in the
[53:32] relationship
[53:36] and now behold the children of Ammon and
[53:38] Moab and
[53:39] and mount sear whom thou what is not let
[53:43] Israel invade when they came out of the
[53:46] land of Egypt
[53:48] but they turned from them and destroyed
[53:50] them not behold I say how they reward us
[53:55] to come and cast us out of thy
[53:57] possession which thou has given us to
[53:59] inherit o Our God will thou not judge
[54:03] them
[54:04] for we have no might against this great
[54:07] company that cometh against us neither
[54:10] know we what to do we don't even know
[54:12] what to do in this situation for our
[54:14] eyes for but our eyes are upon thee
[54:21] we can either look at the problem
[54:24] or we can keep our eyes on the solution
[54:26] to know where our help comes from
[54:29] all Judas stood before the Lord with
[54:32] their little ones oh isn't this
[54:34] beautiful families their wives and their
[54:36] children
[54:38] then upon J Hazel the son of Zechariah
[54:43] the son of benil B
[54:47] in Naya the levite I'm sorry the son of
[54:51] Jewell
[54:52] jehu the son of matina a levite of the
[54:57] sons of asaph came the spirit of the
[55:02] Lord in the midst of the congregation
[55:09] see what happens God will finally come
[55:13] if you do your part to get on your face
[55:16] get before the Lord and just bring forth
[55:20] your strong reasons show forth your just
[55:22] cause ex Express to God your whole being
[55:27] God will come
[55:29] in your midst and speak to you
[55:34] and he said how can he all Judah any
[55:38] happiness of Jerusalem
[55:40] and Thou King Jehoshaphat
[55:43] thus saith the Lord unto you be not
[55:48] afraid
[55:49] nor dismayed by the reason of this great
[55:52] problem in your life
[55:54] for the battle is not yours
[55:59] but God's
[56:03] it sure seems like it's my problem
[56:06] they're coming after me
[56:08] they want to destroy me
[56:10] sure sounds like it's my battle doesn't
[56:12] sound like anybody else is going through
[56:14] it
[56:16] you can either testify it's your battle
[56:19] or it's God's
[56:24] tomorrow go ye down against them behold
[56:29] they come up by the cliff now this is
[56:32] still God talking of as is and ye shall
[56:35] find them at the end of the brook before
[56:37] the Wilderness of
[56:39] jewelry Jew real
[56:42] now it it really sounds like
[56:46] it the battle is still theirs because
[56:48] God is saying to go down against them
[56:55] but he's not saying that
[56:59] ye shall not need to fight in this
[57:01] battle
[57:03] set yourselves stand still and see the
[57:07] salvation of the Lord with you
[57:11] don't you think God wants
[57:13] to say the same thing to us
[57:16] does it don't you think he wants us to
[57:19] stand still and and watch him save us in
[57:22] our situation
[57:24] that that there's no need to fight the
[57:26] battle that really The Battle Belongs to
[57:28] the Lord
[57:30] oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be
[57:33] dismayed tomorrow go out against them
[57:36] for the Lord will be with you
[57:40] and Jehoshaphat bowed his head and his
[57:43] face to the ground and all Judah and
[57:46] then happens of Jerusalem fell before
[57:48] the Lord worshiping the Lord and the
[57:51] Levites
[57:52] of the children of
[57:55] core called
[57:58] carothites and of the children of the
[58:00] core rights stood up to praise the Lord
[58:03] of Israel with a loud voice on high
[58:12] can't be in the dumps and praise the
[58:13] Lord
[58:15] one spirit is going to take over
[58:18] and they Rose early in the morning and
[58:20] went forth Into the Wilderness that Tico
[58:23] and I'm sorry that I can't pronounce
[58:25] words real well but you you understand
[58:30] uh
[58:32] the the message that the Lord has given
[58:34] us even though the words aren't perfect
[58:36] and as they went forth Jehovah stood and
[58:40] said Hear Me O Judah and he inhabitants
[58:44] of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your
[58:47] God
[58:48] so shall you be established
[58:51] Believers prophets so shall you prosper
[58:55] and when he had consulted with the
[58:57] people he appointed singers unto the
[59:00] Lord
[59:01] and that should be and that should
[59:04] praise the beauty of Holiness as they
[59:09] went out before the Army and to say
[59:11] praise the Lord for his mercy endureth
[59:15] forever and when they began to sing into
[59:19] praise the Lord set
[59:21] ambushments against the children of
[59:24] Ammon and Moab and the mount Syria which
[59:27] were come down against Judah and they
[59:30] were smitten
[59:34] what a message for us we just heard last
[59:38] service that we we need to give the God
[59:41] give God the respect that he deserves by
[59:44] coming into his presence with worship
[59:47] and praise and thanksgiving
[59:50] and now God
[59:53] would not
[59:55] destroy or Smite the this problem that
[1:00:00] they had until they began to worship
[1:00:04] until they began to sing praises before
[1:00:07] the Lord that was the requirement before
[1:00:12] the battle would be won
[1:00:16] I just
[1:00:18] I love the Simplicity that
[1:00:21] all we got to do is trust God
[1:00:24] believe in God that he will take care of
[1:00:28] our problems we want we want other
[1:00:31] people to take care of our problems
[1:00:34] we just do we do we want people to take
[1:00:37] care of them we look for natural answers
[1:00:39] but
[1:00:42] but God wants us to fall on her face to
[1:00:46] cry out to him to let him be
[1:00:49] the the one that gets the glory
[1:00:54] and and just to follow his instructions
[1:00:56] if he tells you to go do this do that
[1:00:59] then you do it if he tells you to praise
[1:01:02] him praise Him worship Him worship Him
[1:01:05] just do what he says
[1:01:09] you would think this is like crazy I
[1:01:12] mean you're gonna get
[1:01:14] killed destroyed you're facing a real
[1:01:16] battle and you're gonna sit here and go
[1:01:20] saying
[1:01:22] do you know what I'm saying you have to
[1:01:24] look at this in a way that you truly
[1:01:28] believe that God is going to deliver you
[1:01:31] and worship him and and mean it from the
[1:01:34] depths of your heart because that is the
[1:01:37] requirement for God to move in our
[1:01:38] behalf
[1:01:44] they didn't have to fight the battle
[1:01:47] God said the battle was not theirs
[1:01:52] so is the problem that you have in yours
[1:01:56] or is it God's
[1:01:58] I just want to hear your testimony
[1:02:02] he said You shall not need to fight in
[1:02:04] this battle
[1:02:06] set yourself stand still and see the
[1:02:08] salvation of the Lord with you
[1:02:13] so we can either testify of that
[1:02:17] or we can get bothered and do all the
[1:02:19] fighting
[1:02:25] what does God do he tells him to go down
[1:02:28] against them the next day
[1:02:30] tells them where they're going to be
[1:02:32] where they're going to come as almost
[1:02:34] that they're going down to flight but he
[1:02:37] wasn't he was going down so they could
[1:02:39] see the salvation of the Lord
[1:02:42] that's why he sent him down there so
[1:02:44] they could see with their eyes that God
[1:02:46] was going to destroy them
[1:02:49] their job was to just believe
[1:02:54] that God was going to do what he said
[1:02:56] that the word of God is true
[1:03:00] and King Jehoshaphat said believe in the
[1:03:03] Lord your God so shall you be
[1:03:05] established Believe In His prophets so
[1:03:09] shall you prosper
[1:03:11] now we don't want to pick and choose
[1:03:14] I know one thing from my life I want to
[1:03:17] believe the things that I'm not
[1:03:18] believing for
[1:03:21] everybody
[1:03:22] because that's what God's looking for in
[1:03:24] my life
[1:03:26] he's not looking to Pat me on the bat
[1:03:28] for what I am believing for he's looking
[1:03:30] for me to have faith to believe what I'm
[1:03:32] not believing for
[1:03:36] him there wasn't room for adults and
[1:03:37] fears negative thoughts imaginations
[1:03:43] there's only room to believe
[1:03:47] just think about without faith it's
[1:03:49] impossible I'll make God happy
[1:03:53] when you go out against your problem
[1:03:55] tomorrow
[1:03:56] you have a choice to make
[1:04:02] either believe that this is your private
[1:04:04] battle
[1:04:05] or this is the Lord's battle
[1:04:11] well brother John you don't understand I
[1:04:13] caused it it doesn't matter
[1:04:17] either Lord's on your side or he's not
[1:04:22] right you have a choice either you're
[1:04:24] going to fight the battle or you're
[1:04:26] going to fight to believe that God is
[1:04:28] going to see you through
[1:04:30] what you're going to be fighting with
[1:04:33] either believe
[1:04:35] that
[1:04:37] you're on your own
[1:04:39] or you're going to believe that the Lord
[1:04:41] is with you
[1:04:43] you may this may sound strange but I'm
[1:04:46] telling you your attitude makes all the
[1:04:48] difference in this
[1:04:50] either believe and trust the Lord or
[1:04:52] doubt and be dismayed because of the
[1:04:54] situation is beyond your
[1:04:56] capability
[1:04:57] it's okay that our situations are beyond
[1:05:00] our capability they're not Beyond gods
[1:05:03] either believe and rejoice and worship
[1:05:05] and give God respect that he deserves or
[1:05:09] just mope
[1:05:13] be that's be dismayed
[1:05:15] we have choices
[1:05:18] that we have to make and their spiritual
[1:05:20] choices
[1:05:21] to believe is a spiritual choice
[1:05:24] to doubt is a spiritual choice
[1:05:28] it's just the wrong spirit
[1:05:32] they're both Spirits one is right one is
[1:05:35] wrong God has not given us the spirit of
[1:05:37] fear but a power love and a sound mind
[1:05:40] you got to separate those two
[1:05:43] God will only act upon the confession
[1:05:48] of our faith
[1:05:51] what we're what we testify what comes
[1:05:54] out of our mouth
[1:05:56] and we know this to be true
[1:05:58] but so often we get caught up in fears
[1:06:03] and problems that we begin to think
[1:06:04] things and then say things they slip out
[1:06:07] before you know it we got a whole
[1:06:08] attitude about it
[1:06:11] turn with me to Hebrews chapter 3 verse
[1:06:13] 1 Hebrews chapter 3 verse 1.
[1:06:19] foreign
[1:06:29] wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the
[1:06:33] Heavenly calling
[1:06:36] consider the Apostle and the high priest
[1:06:39] of our profession
[1:06:42] Jesus Christ now that word profession
[1:06:45] means confession
[1:06:48] he is the high priest of what comes out
[1:06:50] of our mouth
[1:06:51] what comes out of our heart what comes
[1:06:53] out of our thoughts what we're what
[1:06:55] we're he can only act according to what
[1:06:58] we say
[1:06:59] if we say
[1:07:04] we're doomed then that's all he can do
[1:07:07] he can't move Beyond
[1:07:10] your faith for you and he goes on to
[1:07:13] explain this here in verse 5 and 6 and
[1:07:15] Moses verily was faithful in all his
[1:07:18] house as a servant so his his wife his
[1:07:22] children
[1:07:24] he took care of of the circumcision
[1:07:27] eventually uh but he was faithful in all
[1:07:30] his house as a servant now this whole
[1:07:32] reason was for a testimony of those
[1:07:35] things which were to be spoken after and
[1:07:39] those things are Christ over us but
[1:07:42] Christ as a son over his own house Who
[1:07:48] We Are
[1:07:49] whose house are we
[1:07:51] if
[1:07:53] all that little word in there
[1:07:56] it just kind of throws out their old
[1:07:58] predestination there doesn't it
[1:08:00] If We Hold Fast the confidence and the
[1:08:05] rejoicing of the Hope firm onto the end
[1:08:14] Christ will be faithful to us if we're
[1:08:18] faithful to believe
[1:08:22] faithful to trust them faithful to
[1:08:24] remain confident faithful to re to
[1:08:27] rejoice in the promises of God
[1:08:30] if we're not faithful with that
[1:08:34] Christ
[1:08:37] will not see God there's no promise for
[1:08:41] Christ to see us through
[1:08:45] because our confession is that he can
[1:08:48] if our confession is he will he will he
[1:08:52] will you just keep rejoicing that he
[1:08:55] will
[1:08:56] the problem is you know we're sometimes
[1:08:58] over here we're sometimes over here
[1:09:00] we're double-minded we're thinking this
[1:09:02] we're saying that we're doing this and
[1:09:04] doubting before you know it becomes such
[1:09:06] a confusion
[1:09:08] right
[1:09:10] and and God is looking for Yea and amen
[1:09:13] believers
[1:09:14] yea and amen Believers now
[1:09:18] here's the problem
[1:09:19] that we all face when we go through long
[1:09:22] trials
[1:09:25] the temptation of our heart of our
[1:09:27] hearts becoming hard
[1:09:31] we know how what happens when we hear
[1:09:33] the truth with hard hearts
[1:09:36] right every time we come to church
[1:09:38] the word falls on four types of ground
[1:09:42] Jesus said he that receiveth the word
[1:09:44] seed into Stony places the same as he
[1:09:47] that heareth the word and amen with joy
[1:09:51] receive it so be it amen yet have he not
[1:09:56] wrote in himself
[1:09:59] but doareth for a while for when
[1:10:01] tribulation and persecution arise
[1:10:03] because of the word by and by He Is
[1:10:06] offended
[1:10:09] he's offended he's offended because the
[1:10:12] roots aren't deep
[1:10:14] now this believer is really unwilling to
[1:10:18] pay the price to get more rooted
[1:10:21] to get more established to get more in
[1:10:23] love with God they want to stay shallow
[1:10:28] you can't do that
[1:10:31] because you're going to go through long
[1:10:33] long trials and they're going to get you
[1:10:36] hard if you're not careful
[1:10:38] this believer only acts like he's being
[1:10:41] a Believer for a while and eventually he
[1:10:43] gets offended
[1:10:45] it's kind of like uh we've heard that
[1:10:47] hot water shows what kind what's in the
[1:10:49] tea bag
[1:10:51] Jesus said buy and buy he is offended
[1:10:57] just all sudden kinds of withdrawals a
[1:11:00] little bit
[1:11:01] that word offended means stumbles trips
[1:11:04] up
[1:11:05] enticed to doubt
[1:11:08] withdraws his confidence
[1:11:13] he just comes into church and sits
[1:11:18] but he withdraws his confidence
[1:11:21] just kind of sits back and doesn't keep
[1:11:24] pressing in
[1:11:26] that's exactly what happens to the
[1:11:29] believer who's offended
[1:11:32] and it may happen four or five months
[1:11:35] ago but it never gets fixed
[1:11:38] it can happen service is a goal
[1:11:43] we need to watch our hearts
[1:11:46] don't let it get hard
[1:11:48] keep it soft keep it tender be humble be
[1:11:52] meek
[1:11:53] we must remain confident that God is
[1:11:56] going to see us through
[1:11:58] we need to keep the right attitude
[1:12:00] always
[1:12:02] all right Hebrews 3 verse 7 now just
[1:12:04] dropping down wherefore as the Holy
[1:12:07] Ghost say it today
[1:12:09] if you will hear his voice Harden not
[1:12:12] your hearts as in the provocation and in
[1:12:14] the day of Temptation in the wilderness
[1:12:17] because that was a long trial for them
[1:12:18] right
[1:12:20] when your father's tempted me and proved
[1:12:23] me and saw my Works 40 years so here's a
[1:12:26] group of people
[1:12:27] they saw the works of God and they still
[1:12:31] allowed their hearts to get hardened
[1:12:34] it wasn't like they were in a church
[1:12:35] they didn't see the work of God
[1:12:37] they saw the works of God and yet their
[1:12:40] hearts got hardened he says wherefore I
[1:12:43] was grieved with that generation and
[1:12:46] said
[1:12:47] they do always err in their heart
[1:12:51] for they have not known my ways
[1:12:55] wow they've seen all the works of God
[1:12:58] and yet they didn't know his ways
[1:13:00] because
[1:13:01] his way is to really trust God no matter
[1:13:04] what God tells them to do that's the way
[1:13:06] of the Lord
[1:13:08] so I swear in my wrath that they shall
[1:13:10] not enter into my rest
[1:13:13] take heed now he goes right back to this
[1:13:15] verse six take heed Brethren lest there
[1:13:17] be in any of you an evil heart of
[1:13:21] unbelief in departing from the Living
[1:13:25] God
[1:13:29] basically walking around without
[1:13:30] religion walking around with religion
[1:13:32] without the reality of the closeness of
[1:13:36] God speaking to your heart
[1:13:38] just becomes religion
[1:13:41] that's what it means an evil heart of
[1:13:43] unbelief
[1:13:45] it's what it means to depart from the
[1:13:47] Living God it isn't like I'm leaving
[1:13:49] church I'm done
[1:13:52] you know
[1:13:54] but now look at this now this is our
[1:13:56] responsibility
[1:13:57] but exhort one another daily
[1:14:01] while it is called today
[1:14:04] lest any of you be hardened through the
[1:14:06] deceitfulness of sin
[1:14:09] for we are made partakers of Christ if
[1:14:12] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[1:14:16] steadfast unto the end
[1:14:19] oh my
[1:14:21] it ain't he that begins the race it's he
[1:14:25] that endures to the end
[1:14:26] and you gotta hold that beginning
[1:14:29] confidence steadfast and firm to the end
[1:14:34] so we have a choice to make we must
[1:14:37] decide
[1:14:40] that we're not going to draw back
[1:14:43] we're not going to be dismayed we're not
[1:14:45] going to
[1:14:47] just kind of Fill A Seat in church but
[1:14:51] we're actually going to give God praise
[1:14:53] as if he's really here
[1:14:55] amen
[1:14:57] we've got to keep our confidence going
[1:15:00] Hebrews 10 verse 35. Hebrews 10 verse 35
[1:15:04] cast not away therefore your confidence
[1:15:07] which has great recompense of reward for
[1:15:11] avnita patience
[1:15:12] that after you have done the will of God
[1:15:14] you might receive the promise now I
[1:15:16] wonder what the will of God what God
[1:15:17] wants you to do
[1:15:21] we need to be looking for what God wants
[1:15:24] us to do
[1:15:26] don't wait for somebody to tell you what
[1:15:28] you should be doing
[1:15:30] you need to find out from God what he
[1:15:32] wants you to do because the Bible says
[1:15:35] after you have done the will of God you
[1:15:38] might receive the promise for yet a
[1:15:40] little while and he that shall come will
[1:15:44] come and will not Tarry
[1:15:47] now the just shall live by faith
[1:15:50] but if any man draw back from living by
[1:15:53] faith in other words you're living by
[1:15:55] sight by the natural he says my soul
[1:15:58] shall have no pleasure in him
[1:16:01] but we are not of then that draw back
[1:16:03] unto Perdition to them that walk by
[1:16:06] sight but of them that believe right to
[1:16:09] the end to the saving of the Soul
[1:16:13] I love it love the scriptures
[1:16:17] choose ye this day whom you will serve
[1:16:22] and serve them with the rejoicing
[1:16:25] choose ye this day
[1:16:27] Who The Battle Belongs to
[1:16:30] choose this day who it belongs to
[1:16:33] battle is the Lords but he can only
[1:16:36] operate his plan of action according to
[1:16:38] your faith whatever you're going to
[1:16:40] testify and here's what's important
[1:16:43] God told Brother Branham to tell the
[1:16:45] people
[1:16:48] that their actions that their thoughts
[1:16:52] speak louder in heaven than their words
[1:16:54] do on Earth
[1:16:56] so if we're going to testify that this
[1:16:59] Belongs to the Lord this battle belongs
[1:17:01] to the Lord he's going to see us through
[1:17:03] and I'm trusting in God I'm believing it
[1:17:05] our thoughts have to be that way as well
[1:17:10] so we need to put our energy into
[1:17:12] actually building our faith
[1:17:15] not fighting the battle
[1:17:21] fighting the good fight of faith we need
[1:17:24] to put our energy in getting more faith
[1:17:26] so we can trust him more
[1:17:29] so we can actually go through the trial
[1:17:31] with a trust that will take us through
[1:17:36] your faith will produce the results
[1:17:38] through the hand of God in your life
[1:17:40] it's your faith we already know the
[1:17:42] power of God can do anything
[1:17:45] so we don't want to put our energy in
[1:17:46] our abilities or somebody else's
[1:17:48] abilities
[1:17:49] our flesh always wants to take control
[1:17:52] of a situation it's it's easier just to
[1:17:55] take control of the situation and handle
[1:17:56] it than it is to trust the Lord because
[1:17:59] it takes patience and you know God's
[1:18:01] working a character in you and uh you
[1:18:03] know that's you know not what we want to
[1:18:06] do
[1:18:08] oftentimes are fighting for control
[1:18:10] doesn't Veil any good we just fight I'm
[1:18:13] going to prove and it doesn't Avail
[1:18:14] anything
[1:18:16] First Corinthians 9 26 I therefore so
[1:18:19] run not as uncertainty certainly Soul
[1:18:22] fight I not is one that beat at the air
[1:18:25] but I keep
[1:18:27] under my body and bring it into
[1:18:29] subjection to the word lest by any means
[1:18:31] when I preached to others I myself
[1:18:35] am not able
[1:18:40] I'm not able
[1:18:42] to keep the testimony
[1:18:44] are you with me
[1:18:46] we walk by faith not by sight
[1:18:50] so how's your faith
[1:18:52] I'm going to ask you a question how how
[1:18:54] is your faith doing
[1:18:56] if our faith is weak
[1:18:58] then why aren't we building it
[1:19:01] why aren't we exercising it
[1:19:03] why aren't we getting a hold of the
[1:19:05] horns of the altar
[1:19:07] getting more serious getting more humble
[1:19:10] getting more still before the to set
[1:19:12] ourselves
[1:19:14] more desperate
[1:19:16] Abraham considered not the weakness
[1:19:22] he considered not his the weakness of
[1:19:25] the situation the the weakness of him
[1:19:28] being older the weakness of Sarah but
[1:19:32] the Bible says he was strong in faith so
[1:19:36] faith is the thing we need to be
[1:19:37] building
[1:19:40] faith is a real substance that comes
[1:19:42] from God
[1:19:44] and I believe if we humble ourself
[1:19:47] to God
[1:19:48] that God gives more grace to the humble
[1:19:53] now we learned last Sunday that to
[1:19:56] respect God enough to enter in his
[1:19:57] presence with much praise
[1:20:00] there's something about rejoicing
[1:20:02] through God's battle that God honors
[1:20:04] we can take if we had time which we
[1:20:06] don't but if we took a look at how the
[1:20:08] walls of Jericho came down
[1:20:12] they walked around in obedience
[1:20:15] but it wasn't until they began to praise
[1:20:18] to blow the trumpets that the walls came
[1:20:21] down
[1:20:22] look how Gideon defeated multitudes with
[1:20:25] just 300 people
[1:20:27] because he was willing
[1:20:30] to to to to to to to to
[1:20:32] give to to follow the word basically God
[1:20:36] told him what to do he did it and they
[1:20:38] worshiped they praised
[1:20:43] and that's what we got to do in our
[1:20:44] situation
[1:20:49] either
[1:20:50] We Believe enough to rejoice in it or we
[1:20:54] don't
[1:20:56] rejoicing through God's battle is an
[1:20:58] expression of our faith to God it's more
[1:21:00] of a deeper expression that you believe
[1:21:03] when you're able to worship Him and
[1:21:05] praise him
[1:21:08] we're told to give thanks in all things
[1:21:10] that includes our trials
[1:21:12] that he inhabits the Praises of his
[1:21:14] people so if you're going to go through
[1:21:16] the fiery furnace you might also Praise
[1:21:18] Him
[1:21:19] you want god with you right
[1:21:22] all right Psalms 18 verse 2 we're going
[1:21:24] to have to hurry Psalms 18 2. let this
[1:21:28] be your testimony in the midst of your
[1:21:29] battle
[1:21:31] the Lord is my rock and my Fortress my
[1:21:35] deliverer my God my strength in whom I
[1:21:38] will trust my buckler my horn my
[1:21:41] salvation and my high tower
[1:21:45] so who's the battle belonged to
[1:21:49] look I will call upon the Lord verse 3.
[1:21:52] who is worthy to be praised so shall I
[1:21:57] be saved from my enemies
[1:22:00] we have a job to do call upon the Lord
[1:22:03] that's what uh josephat did call upon
[1:22:06] the Lord who's worthy to be praised so
[1:22:09] shall I be saved from my enemies
[1:22:14] when we give God praise for his
[1:22:16] worthiness he will move in our behalf
[1:22:20] when we honor the Lord with respect to
[1:22:23] praise so shall we be saved from our
[1:22:25] enemies
[1:22:27] when our praise magnifies the Lord to
[1:22:29] the place where
[1:22:32] you look to God
[1:22:35] as your Shield as your buckler your
[1:22:39] personal
[1:22:40] your personal savior your personal
[1:22:43] Fortress your personal Hightower you're
[1:22:46] personally to you he is God
[1:22:50] not just what the Bible says he is
[1:22:53] it's got to be personal
[1:22:56] if he's your rock then say he's my rock
[1:22:59] if he's your strength and say he's my
[1:23:02] strength he's my Fortress he's my
[1:23:04] deliverer he's my buckler he will move
[1:23:07] upon the confession of your faith
[1:23:10] whatever you profess
[1:23:12] or if he's just the god of the Bible
[1:23:13] that's all he's going to be but he needs
[1:23:15] to be your God
[1:23:18] he is the Horn of our salvation
[1:23:22] doesn't matter what situations going on
[1:23:24] in our life he promised to be there
[1:23:29] the battle is the Lord's
[1:23:31] God fights our battles
[1:23:34] we learn to trust him
[1:23:37] I will say of the Lord he is my refuge
[1:23:39] my Fortress my God in him will I trust
[1:23:44] amen
[1:23:45] amen I love this word it just takes all
[1:23:48] the pressure off of us and I'll tell you
[1:23:49] this word is not for for this is not for
[1:23:53] people who are what we would consider
[1:23:55] good people
[1:23:57] there's no good people
[1:23:59] there's no good people there's none this
[1:24:02] this word is for everybody
[1:24:04] this word is for us
[1:24:06] Isaiah chapter 9 verse 5 says for every
[1:24:10] battle of a warrior is with confused
[1:24:13] noise
[1:24:14] you know what battles are like
[1:24:16] and garments wrote in blood but this
[1:24:19] shall be with a burning and a fuel fire
[1:24:21] now this is speaking of the Messiah
[1:24:24] for every battle of a warrior is with
[1:24:26] confused noise just keep that in mind a
[1:24:30] lot of times we go to battles and
[1:24:33] situations and it becomes so confusing
[1:24:36] to us
[1:24:37] amen like what is going on this is this
[1:24:41] shouldn't be happening this is this is
[1:24:43] bad this is wrong
[1:24:45] but that's not the way it's supposed to
[1:24:47] be for us
[1:24:49] because God is our Shield
[1:24:51] he's our buckler he's got everything
[1:24:52] under control Isaiah 71 verse 1 uh not
[1:24:57] Isaiah but Psalms 71 verse 1.
[1:25:00] in thee O Lord do I put my trust
[1:25:06] let me never be put to confusion
[1:25:14] if you trust the Lord he'll keep you
[1:25:17] from confusion
[1:25:20] deliver me in thy righteousness and
[1:25:22] cause me to escape incline thine ear
[1:25:24] unto me and save me be thou my strong
[1:25:27] habitation where unto I may continually
[1:25:30] Resort
[1:25:32] thou has given commandment to save me
[1:25:35] for thou art my rock and my Fortress so
[1:25:39] let this be your testimony God has the
[1:25:43] captain of our Salvation has given
[1:25:45] commandment
[1:25:46] to save you
[1:25:50] you are saved by God's commandment he he
[1:25:55] spoke the word it's his commandment
[1:26:02] I'm so grateful
[1:26:04] that we have a promise in God's word
[1:26:06] today
[1:26:07] to save us from confusion
[1:26:10] to save us from
[1:26:12] disaster
[1:26:13] and all we have to do is trust her we
[1:26:15] don't have to figure out how he's going
[1:26:16] to do it we don't got to figure out when
[1:26:18] he's going to do it
[1:26:19] if anything we got to figure out is Lord
[1:26:21] what would you have me to do to obey you
[1:26:23] right now
[1:26:24] and until you tell me I'm going to seek
[1:26:26] your face and I'm going to worship you
[1:26:28] I'm going to praise you I'm just going
[1:26:30] to wait upon you
[1:26:32] the battle is the Lord's it's not our
[1:26:34] battle
[1:26:35] God fights our battles
[1:26:39] he doesn't even want us to think
[1:26:41] we did something
[1:26:43] in the battle
[1:26:46] he doesn't he wants all the glory
[1:26:49] to God be all the glory
[1:26:51] too many people are trusting in
[1:26:53] themselves to achieve
[1:26:55] to get Deliverance or to get victory
[1:26:59] Psalms 118 Verse 8 says it's better to
[1:27:03] trust the Lord than to put confidence in
[1:27:05] man
[1:27:07] now that just doesn't mean the man that
[1:27:10] stands in front of you
[1:27:12] that means the man whose eyes you're
[1:27:14] looking out of
[1:27:17] it sometimes we put trust in ourself our
[1:27:19] own reasoning our own understanding our
[1:27:21] own thinking
[1:27:22] and it's better to trust the Lord
[1:27:24] than to put confidence in any man
[1:27:28] even though the Battle Belongs to the
[1:27:30] Lord we have a part to play in the war
[1:27:34] and if we get out of position
[1:27:36] get out of our post to duty get out of
[1:27:39] our praise
[1:27:40] get out of our faith
[1:27:43] then we have no promise
[1:27:45] of victory
[1:27:53] I don't want to be in a place that I
[1:27:56] have not the promise of Victory
[1:28:00] so that means I got to stay in my
[1:28:02] position I got to stay up my post to
[1:28:04] duty I got to be where God wants me to
[1:28:06] be and I've got to be praising him and
[1:28:09] thanking him and worshiping him
[1:28:12] because that's what brings the promise
[1:28:18] God is trying to teach us to do our part
[1:28:22] it's Psalms 144 verse 1.
[1:28:26] Psalms 44 verse 1 said blessed be the
[1:28:32] Lord God I'm sorry blessed be the Lord
[1:28:34] my strength
[1:28:36] which teacheth My Hands to War
[1:28:40] and my fingers
[1:28:42] to fight
[1:28:45] wow you would think that we're going to
[1:28:47] go to some special
[1:28:48] martial arts or something like that and
[1:28:51] we're going to learn you know how to
[1:28:53] fight
[1:28:55] um
[1:28:56] my goodness my Fortress my high tower my
[1:29:01] deliver my shield and he in whom I trust
[1:29:08] who subdueth my people under me
[1:29:13] I believe the way that God is teaching
[1:29:15] us to war
[1:29:17] is to trust in him
[1:29:20] because we don't put our trust in swords
[1:29:22] and Spears we read that already
[1:29:25] our trust is in the invisible us the
[1:29:29] invisible armor of God
[1:29:33] is invisible
[1:29:35] that that that that I Trust You Lord
[1:29:38] above everything that's invisible
[1:29:43] it can it it becomes manifest eventually
[1:29:48] we must learn to trust God more
[1:29:52] to obey what he speaks to us
[1:29:54] to shout the victory before the battle's
[1:29:57] over
[1:29:58] to praise him before we see the victory
[1:30:00] to hold our confidence steadfast to the
[1:30:03] end to believe to trust to count those
[1:30:07] things which are not yet as though they
[1:30:09] already are
[1:30:12] amen this is God teaching us
[1:30:16] teaching Our Hands to War teaching her
[1:30:18] fingers
[1:30:19] that's that's how we we're supposed to
[1:30:22] war
[1:30:23] God is training us to fight the good
[1:30:26] fight of faith
[1:30:28] put our energy in our thoughts and
[1:30:30] increase in our faith by praying more
[1:30:32] reading more I'm telling you when you
[1:30:35] get done reading listening to a tape
[1:30:37] going to church if your faith is not
[1:30:40] increased there's something wrong with
[1:30:42] your hearing
[1:30:44] there's something wrong with your
[1:30:45] hearing
[1:30:49] that's why it's better
[1:30:51] to pray earnestly and humbly God give me
[1:30:53] ears to hear what the spirit is saying
[1:30:55] to the church because we automatically
[1:30:57] don't have it just because we think
[1:30:59] we're predestinated
[1:31:01] it's even if we are predestinated God
[1:31:04] still expects a humble attitude a humble
[1:31:06] Spirit amongst us
[1:31:11] people either try to handle everything
[1:31:13] on their own
[1:31:15] and when they don't get it they just
[1:31:17] give up
[1:31:21] we don't sit around just waiting for
[1:31:23] Faith to show up
[1:31:24] we got to exercise it
[1:31:27] we got to do the little things
[1:31:30] do the little things
[1:31:33] whatever God says do it
[1:31:35] we got to lay hold of the promises of
[1:31:37] God Amen
[1:31:39] Second Chronicles chapter 32 verse 7
[1:31:41] says be strong and courageous
[1:31:45] Be not Afraid nor dismayed for the king
[1:31:49] of Assyria nor of all the multitude that
[1:31:52] is with him
[1:31:54] for there be more with us than with him
[1:32:00] with him is the arm of Flesh but with us
[1:32:04] is the Lord Our God to help us
[1:32:08] and to fight our battles
[1:32:12] and the people
[1:32:14] rested themselves upon the words of
[1:32:17] Hezekiah king of Judah and that's all we
[1:32:20] got to do we got to rest upon the word
[1:32:23] of God Amen
[1:32:26] now we're fighting the good fight of
[1:32:28] faith
[1:32:29] fighting to believe more than what we
[1:32:32] now believe
[1:32:34] he promised he give power to the faint
[1:32:36] to them that have no might he increases
[1:32:38] strength
[1:32:39] as we spend more time in prayer Isaiah
[1:32:41] 40 verse 31 tells us but they that wait
[1:32:44] upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[1:32:47] they shall Mount up with wings as egos
[1:32:51] they shall run and not be where they
[1:32:52] shall walk and not faint
[1:32:56] now just by simply waiting in God In
[1:32:59] Prayer something happens to you
[1:33:02] you you walk into the prayer closet
[1:33:06] like a little baby lion
[1:33:09] and you walk out of there
[1:33:12] bold as a lion
[1:33:15] because God comes and he fills you with
[1:33:18] faith
[1:33:19] he speaks his word to you
[1:33:25] Jesus said if thou cast believe all
[1:33:28] things are possible to him that
[1:33:31] believeth
[1:33:33] if you're going to fight fight for faith
[1:33:36] build yourself up in the Most Holy Faith
[1:33:39] first John chapter 5 verse 4 you just
[1:33:41] write it down it says this is the
[1:33:43] victory that overcometh the world even
[1:33:46] our faith
[1:33:48] so
[1:33:50] what we need to do is build our faith
[1:33:53] and keep building it that's the answer
[1:33:56] not how we can discover how to get out
[1:33:58] of our problem
[1:34:01] we need to learn to war to take
[1:34:03] possession
[1:34:05] learn to believe that all things are
[1:34:08] possible endure hardness as a good
[1:34:10] soldier Jesus Christ
[1:34:12] Joshua tells us every place that the
[1:34:14] soul of your feet shall tread upon that
[1:34:16] I have given you as I said unto Moses
[1:34:19] and in verse 5 of Joshua 1 says there
[1:34:22] shall not any man be able to stand
[1:34:24] before thee all the days of thy life
[1:34:26] as I was with Moses so I will be with
[1:34:29] thee I will not fail thee nor forsake
[1:34:32] thee now you've got to put yourself in
[1:34:34] those shoes are you a believer
[1:34:38] be strong and of good courage For unto
[1:34:41] this people shall thou divide for
[1:34:44] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[1:34:47] their fathers to give him only be thou
[1:34:51] strong and very courageous that thou
[1:34:54] mayest observe to do according to all
[1:34:57] the law which Moses my servant commanded
[1:34:59] thee
[1:35:00] turn not from it to their right hand or
[1:35:03] to the left that thou mayest Prosper
[1:35:05] whether so ever thou goest you want to
[1:35:08] prosper
[1:35:10] I want to prosper
[1:35:12] this is all we got to do this book of
[1:35:15] the law which shall not depart out of
[1:35:17] thy mouth
[1:35:18] but thou shall meditate therein day and
[1:35:22] night that thou mayest shall deserve to
[1:35:24] do according to all that is written
[1:35:26] therein
[1:35:27] for then shall thou
[1:35:29] for then thou shall make thy way
[1:35:32] prosperous
[1:35:33] and then thou shall have good success
[1:35:36] you know a lot of people
[1:35:38] honestly through the years have mocked
[1:35:41] me
[1:35:44] have just belittled
[1:35:47] and
[1:35:48] made light
[1:35:51] of God's grace
[1:35:55] and I'm telling you the word is for
[1:35:57] everybody
[1:36:00] and if if you just follow the word
[1:36:03] God will hold up his end of the bargain
[1:36:08] you you can't just do what you want and
[1:36:11] expect things to work out
[1:36:14] have not I commanded thee be strong and
[1:36:17] be of good courage Be not Afraid neither
[1:36:19] be dismayed for the Lord thy God is with
[1:36:21] you
[1:36:22] whether so ever thou goest
[1:36:25] he's with us
[1:36:28] by faith take possession
[1:36:31] of what God has promised you if God has
[1:36:33] promised you peace take possession
[1:36:36] just follow the guidelines keep your
[1:36:37] mind stayed on the Lord
[1:36:39] well brother John this problem is so big
[1:36:41] in my life I don't know if I could do
[1:36:42] that you can do that
[1:36:44] you can do that
[1:36:46] start praising them before you know it
[1:36:48] you think this is crazy
[1:36:50] but
[1:36:52] you'll see God's presence will come
[1:36:56] I just got two scriptures
[1:36:58] and I'm just gonna I'm not going to read
[1:36:59] the whole thing when you've got when
[1:37:01] you've got time
[1:37:03] uh read all first Timothy chapter six
[1:37:06] but I want to start here at verse six
[1:37:09] First Timothy chapter six verse 6 but
[1:37:11] godliness with contentment is great gain
[1:37:13] for we brought nothing into this world
[1:37:14] and certainly we can carry nothing out
[1:37:16] and having food Remnant let us there
[1:37:19] with uh be let us be there with content
[1:37:23] but they that won't be content they that
[1:37:26] will be rich fall into temptation and
[1:37:28] snare into many foolish and hurtful lust
[1:37:31] which drown men in destruction and
[1:37:33] Perdition now that means spiritually for
[1:37:35] the love of many is the root of all evil
[1:37:37] which while some Covenant of after they
[1:37:39] have aired from the
[1:37:41] faith
[1:37:43] and Pierce themselves through many
[1:37:45] sorrows
