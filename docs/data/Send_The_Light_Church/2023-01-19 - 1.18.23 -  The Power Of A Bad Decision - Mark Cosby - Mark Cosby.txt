Holy Spirit just fall down like a day of Pentecost Lord May us let's get re-baptized and baptized with your Holy Ghost and Lord once again I want to give you control over every Spirit over everything have your preeminence we ask all these things in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen like this open up our Bibles uh to First Samuel so this is going to be a little study a Bible study kind of feeling so we're going to spend a lot of time in the book of uh first Samuel second Samuel uh and the title of this message is the power of a bad decision so this is part three of our series our last part so I'll just pray the Lord just speaks to each one of us so first Samuel 13 and reverses uh sorry verse one so this is uh talking about King Saul so we all know about King Saul in the Old Testament he was the king before David So Israel they wanted to be just like the world they wanted a king to govern them and uh Samuel uh said you know said to them was trying to persuade them not but uh he they went ahead and still wanted that desire and he said did I not say did I say anything that was wrong did I take any money did I say what not the Lord has said they said no no but their desire was to have a king over them to be just like the outside world and so Saul was the king and we're gonna just talk a little bit about Saul today and just some decisions that he made uh so let's go verse one Saul reign one year and when he had reigned two years over Israel Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel wherefore 2000 or with Saul in mcmash and in Mount Bethel and the Thousand with Jonathan and gibbeth of Benjamin and the rest of the people he's uh the people he sent every way every man to his tent and Jonathan smote The Garrison of the Philistines that was in gibth and the Philistines heard of it and Saul blew the trumpet through all the lands saying let the Hebrews hear and all Israel heard that Saul has smitten a Garrison of the Philistines and that Israel also was had an Abomination with the Philistines and the people were called together after Saul to gilgal and the Philistines get themselves together to fight with Israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand Horsemen and people as the sand which is on the seashore in the multitude and they came up and pitched in mcmash Eastward from Beth Haven when the men of Israel saw that they were in the strait for the people were distressed then the people that hide themselves in caves and thickets and in rocks and in high places and pits and some of the Hebrews went over to Jordan to the land of God and gilgad as for Saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followed him trembling verse eight and he carried seven days according to the set time that Samuel had appointed so there was a uh a talk between Samuel and Saul that uh Saul was the Pacific thing in weight but Samuel came not to gilgad and the people were scattered from him and Saul did bring hither a burnt offering uh to me so and Saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me in peace offerings and he offered the burnt offering if you notice uh if you have a Scofield the top of that header says Saul intrudes into the priest's office so he's doing something that he's not called to do and let's keep going we'll go verse 10 and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of the offering the burnt offering behold Samuel came and Saul went out to meet him that he might salute him and Saul and Samuel said what hast thou done and Saul said because I saw that people were scattered from me and thou came as not within the days appointed and at the Philistines gathered themselves together and mcmashed therefore said all right the Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilda and I have not made supplication unto the Lord I forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering and Samuel said to to Saul that was done foolishly Saul not knowing that this very decision would impact his whole entire life done foolishly thou has not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God when he commanded thee for now would thy Lord would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever that one decision stopped his kingdom from being established forever verse 14 I'll have you guys sit down but now thy kingdom should not continue the Lord has sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded it you may sit down so that one decision that Saul made impacted not only him but his whole those around him and saw not realizing that obedience is better than sacrifices will read further down the road so it's so important when God has commanded us to do something whether it's to go witness whether it's to help a brother or sister in a church whether it's to stop doing this one thing that God wants you to stop doing that's a direct commandment from the Lord and our our job is to heed that commandment to follow through and Saul chose not to follow through with that commandment instead he hearkened unto the people he instead of instead of looking to the Lord who could help that situation he what he should have done was he should have went into prayer and say Lord I don't know what to do uh Samuel said he'll be here but instead he said oh I'm going to do this he decided to take it upon himself and let me intrude in this office and do this very thing and that was not pleasing to the Lord the Lord is very displeased upon that because he went outside of his office amen so if you want to turn with me uh let's go to Samuel 15. so it's a couple pages over and we're going to see Saul you think Saul would have learned his lesson see the thing was if Saul want to analyzed the bad decision he made in the first place he wouldn't have made a similar decision in in chapter 15. so when we do when we make a bad decision or do something we shouldn't have done we need to analyze what led up to that bad decision and we need to not make that same mistake as Saul is going to show us in the scriptures that he made a similar Mistake by uh not uh listening to the Commandment of God and it's so important to listen to the Commandment of God because when you listen to the Commandment of God it crosses fruit in your life it causes growth when you don't it crosses you uh unnecessary pain and turmoil because you decided not to listen to the voice of the Lord so reverse one in chapter 15. Samuel also said unto Saul the Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over Israel now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of Lord now he's giving them an option to hearken he says hearken so Saul at that very moment he had a choice either to hearken fully or to hearken partially to hearken partially what you're doing is you're not following the will of the Lord because uh even Jesus said in uh Revelations 3 about the lukewarm believer I would have you be hot or cold and not lukewarm so let's go to verse two thus saith the Lord of hosts I remember that which amalek did to Israel how he laid weight for him in the way when he came up from Egypt now go and smite M like an early Destroyer all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant suckling ox and sheep cam on ass now notice God gave him a direct thing to do Specific Instructions to do not to do this or that but to do this very thing I have commanded you to do and Saul gathered the people together and numbered them and tell them 200 000 footmen and ten thousand men of Judah and Saul came to a city of emlic and laid wait in the valley and Saul said unto the kinites go depart get you down from among the amalekites lest I destroy you with them for you kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt so the kidneys departed from among the malachites and Saul smote the malachites from Havelock forgive me I can't pronounce either until thou came Mr sure that is over Egypt and he took agai the king of the amakites alive and other destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword but notice this statement right here but Saul and the people spared agai in the best of the sheep and the oxens and all the fatlings and the Lambs and all that was good and would not uh destroy them but everything that was vile refused that they destroyed utterly right there that displeased God because God didn't say to do that he said to destroy everything leave nothing so right then and there man likes to think they can think like oh I think God would like this God he says my ways are not your ways my thoughts are not your thoughts so we can't mix our own Thoughts with God's thoughts because God is not carnal he's he's spiritual his his thoughts are way higher than we can ever think of and that's why we need to Humble ourselves and let the mind of Christ dwell in US richly if Saul would humble himself and said if Saul would have made his mind up I am following the will of God the Commandment of God no matter what then it would have saved him and said to him the top of the header says Saul's incomplete obedience once again his self-will got him in trouble was going to get him in trouble once again let's go to verse 10. then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel saying it repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king for he is turned back from following me and has not performed my Commandments and it Grieves Samuel and he cried unto the Lord all night and when Samuel Rose early to meet Saul in the morning it was told Samuel saying Saul came to Carmel or came to Carmel and behold he set him a place and has gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal and Samuel came to Saul and Saul said to him blessed be thou the Lord I have performed the Commandment of the Lord this is like a statement he said he just thought he did God a service that he just did God good oh I I did this I destroyed some people and and we're gonna see how what Samuel's erection is uh oh this is this uh this line kind of makes me laugh a little bit I just kind of picture and Samuel said what meaneth this the bleeding of the sheep just imagine you know Samuel is coming and here's she she bleeding he's like that's not what the Lord commanded you to do why is there why is there's casualty is still alive why is that Survivor still alive so let's keep it going I performed verse 14. and Samuel said what meaneth this the bleeding of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of The Oxen which I hear and Saul said they have brought them from the malachites for the people spared the best sheep and of oxen to sacrifice notice this I just found this out yesterday I was just studying and what brought to my attention was you've noticed that the two things when Saul did the Disobedience had to do with sacrifice and offerings and that obedience I just found out yesterday's kind of just studying so the very same mistake Saul made he was trying to give God an offering instead of being obedient obedience must come first before you can give a true offering because you can sacrifice and offer all you want to but if you're not being obedient to the voice of God it cannot make up for that so obedience is so important in our walks with God obedience will help you progress more intimate and more closer with God that's what God is asking for is obedience and the scripture says go you out go ye out the scripture says fast and pray praying fast it's Commandments from God um let me see what wrestle right now we're verse 16 I believe then Samuel said unto Saul stay I will tell thee what the Lord had said to me this night and he said unto him say on and Samuel said when I was little in my own sight was thou is not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord anointed thee King over Israel God is trying to remind him where he took him from he came from humble beginnings but he forgot where he came from and let him being a king overshadow what he once was and pride began to enter to his life and he thought that he could do anything and God would be pleased but God doesn't care of your prestige if you're a um a song leader a minister a deacon a trustee he does not care about your prestige he cares about you honoring him in that position that you're in and you humbling yourself and being thankful that God even called you to be in that position verse 18. and the Lord sent thee on a journey and said go ugly destroy the Sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then did is thou not obey the voice of the Lord but it is fly upon the spoil and it is evil on the side of the Lord and Saul said unto Samuel this notice a statement I have obeyed the voice of the Lord I he just he he just he's tricked himself so much into thinking that he he did exactly what the Lord has done and we can get that same type of predicament thinking that we're doing what God is telling us to do but we're leaving things out because it doesn't fit in our schedule it doesn't fit how we like it but it's not about what we like it's about what God likes so it doesn't matter how much uh Saul wanted to sacrifice these offerings God wanted obedience that's what God is Desiring his obedience for every one of us and Saul said to Samuel you have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and have brought that guy the kingdom of the amalek and have early destroyed the amalekites but the people took of the spoiled Chief and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto Lord thy God and gilgal it's wonderful see brother Marty so good to see him verse 22 and Samuel said hath the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord notice this behold to obey is better than sacrifice than to hearken the fat of rams now notice verse 23 says for Rebellion is as a sin of Witchcraft and Witchcraft you may think it's just magic and you know in sorcery but if you look at the definition in the Scofield one of the definitions it says to have intercourse with Satan to be intimate with Satan to have a connection with Satan because Satan is the author of uh Rebellion because what is what is obeying or rebelling is a perversion of not obeying God that's all it is a perversion because you're rebelling against God so it says the Sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness as iniquity and idolatry because that was rejected the word of the Lord he has also rejected thee from being King and Saul said unto Samuel I have sinned for I have transgressed the Commandment of the Lord and thy words because I feared the people and obeyed their voice now therefore I pray pardon my sin and turn again with me that I may Worship the Lord and Samuel said in the Saul I will not return with thee for thou has rejected the word or the word of the Lord and the Lord has rejected thee from being King over Israel and Samuel turned to go away and he laid a hold upon the skirt of his mantle and it went and Samuel said unto him the Lord hath read the Kingdom of Israel for me this day and have given it to a neighbor of thine that is better than now and also the strength of Israel will not lie nor repent free is not a man that he should repent then he said I have sinned yet honor me now I pray before the Elders of my people this notice that he wants to be still be honored in front of the people instead of him going to his prayer closet and just asking for forgiveness and repentance he wants to look good in front of the people then I said I I have sinned yet honor me now I prayed before the Elders of my people and before Israel and turn again with me that I may Worship the Lord thy God so Samuel turned it again after Saul and saw Worship the Lord then Samuel said bring ye hitherto me a God the king of amakites the word of God still has to be fulfilled he still had to fulfill that commandment because it says his word cannot return void so since Saul didn't want to do it then Samuel stepped in and that guy came unto him delicately and that guy said surely the bitterness of death has passed and Samuel said as the as thy sword hath made women childless shall thy mother be childless among women in Samuel hewed agai in pieces before the Lord in gilgal then Sammy went to rameth and Saul with him to his house to giveth of Saul and Samuel came no more to see Saul unto the day of his death nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul and Lord repented they made Saul King over Israel Samuel had such a heart for Saul you know at the end of the day Samuel couldn't make the choices for Saul but it still hurt him to see him in that condition that the Lord rejected him as king and if you read further we're not going to be further but just how you know evil spirit got upon Saul and Saul was trying to kill David and uh he this Saul could never get in the grasp of just getting in line with God and just be humble in himself so he just kind of was always blinded just by his choices and we did see the power of bad decision not only to get himself killed by somebody but he got his son killed as well for his bad decisions so like I said the power of a bad decision your decisions that you make are so important as you said earlier in the series that it affects not only you but those around you your church brothers and sisters your your blood family so it's so important for us to heed to the voice of God and not become like how Saul became because these examples are put in the Bible for a reason for us to learn after not to do the same exact thing and let's go to we're going to talk another character King David let's go to second Samuel chapter 11. I want to take our time I'm not going to rush say Amen when you get there and we'll start with verse one and and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when the Kings go forth to battle that David sent Joe ebb and his servants with him and all of Israel and they destroyed the children of Ammon and besieged rabbit but David Terry's still at Jerusalem now notice the first header of the scripture was it says at the time when the Kings go forth to battle and notice David stayed there and tarried so right then and there something was wrong because if he went out with the to battle with the Kings this thing that's going to happen to him I believe wouldn't have happened but still at the end of the day there was something in David's life that he never dealt with and we're gonna see what that very thing is that he didn't deal with so let's go to verse two see Satan knows the thing the vices you have in your life the things you have been dealt with so it's best to get delivered from those things instead of letting them just lay dormant in your life because eventually they're going to come out like a kid when he cleans his room sometimes he throws everything in the closet that's eventually going to be made to light you can only hide things for so long let's go to verse uh two and it came to pass in the evening tide that David arose from in the bed and walked upon the roof of the King's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon now notice if he was at the Battle he never would have seen this but but the devil saw an opportunity to lay something before David and to see what would happen the devil likes to lay traps before us but we have to be sober and to be vigilant to be able to be aware of them verse verse 3 and David sent in inquired after the woman and one said it's not this Bathsheba the daughter of Elam the wife of Uriah the high type and David sent Messengers and took her and she came into him and he lay with her for she was purified from uncleanliness and she returned into her house now notice this very thing so David was on his roof and he saw this girl and obviously you know he he didn't expect her to be there obviously but he did not think about it he made a decision based upon his flesh he lusted after he said oh this girl is right here uh she's beautiful I want her and he even asked and they told him that this is another man's wife and he went in and committed this sin with her he never thought he never thought it through he never thought the consequences of it he just did what felt good to his flesh a lot of times things will feel good to your flesh but they will not they will hurt your spiritual man inside and David not realized this would change his whole very life and he kept going further and further he tried to hide the sin knowing that you cannot hide nothing from God God knows what you're thinking right very this moment amen let's go to verse four over reverse four and David sent messages and took her and she came in unto him and he lay with her where she was purified from her uncleanliness and she returned to her house and the woman conceived see David didn't expect that the the the stories is getting more more uh crazier and crazier and sent and told David said I am a child they was just probably like oh my goodness what have I done what have I done he's just probably just pacing around just walking what have I done now he's trying to figure this situate out he's trying to figure this situation out himself now he's trying to incorporate his own thoughts and ideas to for him not to get in trouble knowing that if he would have just if he would just recognize and realize he made this this bad grave decision and he would just uh just pray to the Lord earnestly I believe the Lord would have showed him some Grace he still had consequences but the consequences he's about to have by him continuing this act is going to be so detrimental he's not even going to realize it but I believe if he would have just took the time and said I need to make this right I I messed up I'm gonna ask this man for forgiveness and if he would have went that way this this would have been a totally different story and David sent to joab saying Send Me Uriah the high tide and joab sent Uriah to David and when Uriah was come unto him David demanded of him how job did and how the people did and how the war prospered and David said to Uriah go down to thy house and wash thy feet and notice what David's uh motive was let's talk about motives notice what David's motive was I'm gonna ask you a question was it a pure motive or was it a mixed motive amen mixed motive because David wanted Uriah to go with his wife and sleep with her thinking that the kid was going to be his but we're gonna see how faithful Uriah was I I love talking about your eye he's a faithful man so he's saying right what's coming to him abandoned him we'll go to verse 8. and David said Shira go down to thy house and wash thy feet and we ride departed out of the King's house and there followed him a mess of meat from the King but Uriah slept at the door of the King's house let's look at that loyalty with all the Servants of his Lord he didn't he didn't try to make himself up something he knew what he was he was a servant to God he was of the army of the Living God he wanted us to fight for his King amen with all the Servants of his Lord and went not down to his house and when they had told David saying your eye went down into his house David said unto you right cometh thou not from that Journey why then did this thou not go down into the house and Uriah said unto the David The Ark in Israel in Judah abide intense and my Lord job and the Servants of my Lord are encamped in the Open Fields shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife as thou livest as I soul liveth I will not do this thing I bless a true servant of the Lord right there he he saw a situation he he wanted to help any way he could even it was to give his life for for Israel and David still even after David hearing that he was still trying that one very mixed motive to get him to go to his wife not trying to make the situation right but trying to cover the situation up and David said to Uriah Terry here today also and tomorrow I will let thee depart so Uriah Abode in Jerusalem that day and tomorrow and when David had called him he did eat and drink before him he even tried to make him he made him drunk for the very intent for him to go to his house all this to make him go to his house instead of if David would have confronted like a man and talk man to man maybe you're right might have punched him in the face but I already had somebody punch me in the face and you know for somebody to die over this this this thing that happened and when David had called him he did eat and drink before him and he made him drunk and that even and we were about to lie on his bed with the Servants of his Lord but went not down to his house wow this man was just so loyal and it came to pass in the morning that David wrote a letter to Joe had been sent it by the hand of your eye notice what this letter said and he wrote the letter saying yet Uriah in the Forefront of the hottest battle retire you from him that he may die into him notice this David gave this man a letter that was declared for him to die and had the this the very man that was going to die carry the letter and send it to joab notice that and this man uh Uriah never looked at the letter that's how much he trust he had in David so David sent this man to his death and the man not even knowing his death sentence was directly in his hand is just see did just because David was a child of God doesn't mean that every day that doesn't mean that this whole thing can be covered up like I said there's consequences so David thought probably all my child of God everything is going to work out fine I'm gonna try to hide this and covers up from God and I'm gonna kill this man everything's gonna be okay this man's out the picture I can lawfully now have this man's wife even though I slept with her before why this man's still alive but David thought I'm gonna kill this man and the wife's all mine oh my but we're going to see what happens happens in this story and it came to pass oh and he wrote in the letter saying yet you're right in the Forefront of the hottest battle and retire you from him that he may be smitten and die and it came to pass when job observed the city that he assigned Uriah into a place where he knew that Valiant men were wow and the men of the city went out and fought with joab and therefore some of the people of the Servants of David and Uriah the high tide died also then job sinned and told David all the things concerning the war and he charged the messenger saying well now has made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king and to be so that the king's wrath arise and he say unto thee wherefore approach he so nigh into the sea when he did fight know ye not that they would shoot from the wall verse 21 who smote abimelech the son of jerusa forgive me did not a woman cast a piece of Milestone upon him though from the wall that he died in the the best why when ye nigh to the wall then say thou that servant your eye the head the hittite is dead we're going to kind of skip down to 25. thus David said unto the messenger Thou shalt say unto job let not this thing displeased thee for the sword devoureth one as well another wow make the battle more strong against the city and overthrow it and encourage thou him and then the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead and she mourned for her husband now notice this and when the morning was passed David sent and fetched her to a solid and she became his wife literally like nothing happened he didn't even care that your eye died he didn't care how how faithful he was to God how how Valiant of a soldier he was he didn't care about his loyalty all he cared all he had was in mind was marrying this woman no matter what that's all he had in mind that's his motive to marry this woman no matter what and and she became his wife and bear him a son but the thing that David had done displeased the Lord wow let's go to we're going to chapter 12 now and the Lord sent Nathan unto David and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor the rich man had exceedingly many flocks and hurts but the poor man had nothing save one little ew lamb which he had brought or bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children and it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him a daughter and there came a traveler unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor man's lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him verse 5 and David's anger was greatly kindled against that man I remember brother Diggs said that the Giant Killer was coming out of David this man should die and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die David's pronouncing judgment this man shall die and little did David know that this story was talking about him didn't even know it that's how blind David was he thought that he had everything under the rug your eyes out the picture and the wife's mind and the baby's mind it's all mine and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity now notice this uh next next verse and David's anger uh verse 6. and he shall our verse 7 now and Nathan said to David Thou Art the man I'm going to see David's heart just sunk he was probably speechless he didn't know what to say because he he was like wow God knows the whole thing that I've done he said and then look what God Said I anointed thee King over Israel I delivered thee all the hand of Saul literally David was running from Saul he was trying to kill him every chance he could and God had a reminder did I not anoint thee King over Israel did I not deliver thee out of the hand of Saul let's go to verse 8. and it says I gave thee thy Master's house and thy Masters wives into thy bosom and gave Thee the house of Israel and of Judah and if that had been too little I would have more ever have given unto thee such things God said I would have given you more things but instead you went upon your self-passions and took this man's wife and killed him he I gave you all these things David you have 500 wives what was another to you was that not enough let's go to verse 9. wherefore that's despise the Commandments of the Lord to do evil in his sight thou has killed Uriah the high tide with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and that slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house notice this this very decision that David made now he's going to be thrown out of his King King hoodness that made that word up now he's gonna suffer his um his Absalom wanting to kill him the very thing that he has run away from Saul's trying to kill him he went back into the very same thing because he made this bad decision so we need to you may say well I'm not David I didn't make this decision but what type of things are you holding on to your life that can come out similar to this and destroy everything around you not only you but everything around you we need to make sure every stone is unturned we need to make sure that the vices that we have in our life we need to overcome them because we are called to be Overcomers not to just live with this thing our whole entire life you can overcome it because God has called us to overcome it but you have to have that strong desire and faith that you can overcome this thing in your life because if David would have dealt with his vice in his life this women problem we saw that in uh the I believe the Samson the Samson we talked about he had a woman problem he never dealt with it and look what it did to him it destroyed him so if David would have dealt with this he would have never been in this predicament but he decided to keep it under the rug and it came out and it came out in Solomon even had the same problem because he never dealt with it it carried over to Solomon forgot what right now verse verse 10. now therefore the sword shall never depart from my house because thou has despised me I notice this he's still a Son of God but I'll tell you it's one thing his relationship with God was never the same again because he made this very mistake God forgave him of the sin but that closeness that he once had it wasn't the same it is it couldn't be the same says thus thus saith the Lord behold I will raise up evil against thee of thy own house and I will take thy wives before thy eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of the son for thou did it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before this son I remember brother Ferguson we did a little bible you did a little bible study on that that God will bring things if you don't want to deal with this thing like how the Lord give you a chance to do it then God he might bring it out openly like this and we don't want to go to that those type of situations we want to just deal with it right then and there if you did something wrong made a mistake make it right brother Brahm said this statement he says um always tell the truth no matter the outcome always tell the truth no matter the outcome it's best to make things right now then wait till later because later we'll escalate in a situation similar to this always does for thou Jesus secretly but I would do this thing before all Israel for the son and David sent unto and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord has also put away that sin thou shall not die I will give David some credit right here he was a man to repent when he did something wrong he would make it right and David after this whole situation and God knowing he realized that he did wrong and if you I think if you want to ever read Psalms 51 it kind of talks about that and he just asked for forgiveness and David he knew he did wrong and he wanted to make it right with God and he did all he could to make it right which I I I just I I'm thankful for that because if you make a mistake in your life you can't let it destroy you because you can't go back and change the past how many of you guys in here would love to change something you did in the past to somebody I'm pretty sure everybody can raise their hand and say that but you can't you gotta learn and grow from it and not make the same mistake over again and and David analyzed that and he didn't do the same thing again obviously but he had still had to pay for that consequence well verse um 13 again and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also had put away thy sin thou shall not die how be it because by this deed that was given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blessing the child or blasting I'm sorry to blasphemy the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die notice the child had to suffer death because of the decision that the parents made and you can't leave Bathsheba out of this either because it takes two to tango she she she had a choice whether to sleep with David or not and she she also made a bad decision as well so we can't just point this on one person but it was two takes two to tango because she's supposed to be faithful to her husband while he's away and she wasn't and Nathan um and Nathan departed onto his house and the Lord struck the child that uriah's wife bear unto David and it was very sick David therefore besought God for the child and David fasted no say he was praying earnestly fasting and went in and laid all night upon the Earth this laying all night just crying out to God say God please spare my child and the Elders of his house arose and went to him and to raise him up from the Earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with them and it came to pass on a seventh day so I'm guessing that he was fasting for seven days not eating anything just laying upon the Earth that's how bad he wanted his child to live that the child and the child died and the Servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead for he said behold while the child was in alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then Vex himself if we tell him that the child is dead but when David saw that his servants whispered David perceived that the child was dead therefore David said unto his servants is this child dead and they said he's dead then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the Lord and worshiped then he came to his own house and we require they set bread before him he did eat then said his service unto him what thing is this that thou has done thou doubt it as fast then weep for the child while I was alive but when the child was dead thou did his rise and eat bread and he said while the child was hit alive I fasted and wept for I said who can tell whether God will be gracious to me that the child may live but now he's dead wherefore should I fast can I bring him back I shall go to him but he shall not return to me David knew he would see that child one day verse 24 think about this out this great debacle that David made God made good of the situation because Solomon was born the wisest man on the whole entire Earth and David comforted Bathsheba his wife who went unto her and laid with her and she buried son and he called his name Solomon and the Lord loved him and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet and he called his name Judith because of the Lord and job fought against rebeth of the children of Ammon and took the Royal City so like I said like we wouldn't say this when you get to when you get so deep into something like this and you don't make it right you'll lose all cider right and wrong David didn't know right from wrong he just knew that I had to get this situation fixed and I'm gonna fix it myself and him fixing it himself made more problems because now absalom's gonna um kick him out his kingdom and one of his sons is gonna do something with his his daughter and all these events happen just because think about that that one decision these chain of events are going to happen in David's life not right away but they're gonna begin to unfold like dominoes and David's life fell to Pieces he was running away all because he didn't deal with that Vice that was in his life years ago David never dealt with his vice he said we carried it for many years but if he dealt with it he could he he wouldn't have to go through the things he went through I mean a couple quotes God had revealed it to the prophet he said David there was a rich man lived on the side of the road he had a whole lot of sheep oh he was very rich a man lived on the side of the road was poor he had one lamb he treated like a daughter he fed out the same spoon he ate with it he slept with the limb everything was just it was just like a daughter to him and one day a visitor came so instead of the rich man taking of his own sheep and making a feast for the visitor well instead of that he went over took the poor man's lamb and by force took the lamb and slayed it and made a feast now David that was David's Passions he had 500 wives but when he see uriah's wife instead of taking one of his 500 wives to appease or satisfy his Passions he took this other man's wife then killed Uriah and she became a mother David didn't know what he was doing why David was ready to pronounce judgment that's the way we are we can always judge the other fellow but when it comes to us that's different David said the man will pay with his life that old Prophet them eyes narrowed down and said David surely you'll not die watch Grace there go to work right quick the spirit struck the prophet saved David's life Grace surely you'll not die but the sword will not leave your house to it thoroughly Purge your heart for you are that rich man oh it was different then wasn't it what saved David when his own judgment said the man will die he paid other most and he'll pay for what his life and the prophet said surely Grace you won't die you'll not die David Grace has saved you it was Grace to David that saved him oh my if it had been for Grace where will we all be all the bad decisions we made in our life it was the grace of God it did not consume us and I'm thankful that that things they all work together for our good even the bad decisions we make somehow God will make it work for your good but you're going to have to still learn that lesson but eventually you'll go over that hump and learn but don't go around the mountain don't keep going around the mountain over and over again learn and move on like brother John was preaching move forward yeah God God is always moving forward and we got to keep moving forward and David had to do the same thing David had to move forward let's go to um like another else for a message of Grace 1961. David and his high robes and his big crown and he had job out there his great General and all the fighting going on he was keeping all the enemies of the Border Lines and things everything was going right he had a baby by this Bathsheba and that poor little ride go out there and had job standing by his side until we drew from him the boy died when the sun went down with the battle knife in his hand the blood on his shield where he stood for Israel yet he apostolate he was to the religion then when job came back and told him that David had died that he had died David thought everything was all right I've gotten his wife and everything will be all right got a baby but the baby took sick the baby started dying he did everything he could to save the baby's life perhaps every doctor no good father baby died they was afraid to tell David the baby was dead and he died then he thought everything was hid so he come for best sheep but he already taken her for his wife after all those other wives now brother braham's going to the heart of the story again this old Prophet old bald-headed fellow stomped in Old Nathan out of the Wilderness sat down David how's everything going said fine fine old Prophet I I love how David is kind of played it off and we do the same thing we kind of just play something off and not just deal with the root of the problem he said oh prophet of God live forever hallelujah oh he was just he thought everything was fine he thought he could hide it but you can't hide from god notice that he knows what you're thinking right now he knows your thoughts for he's God that Holy Spirit that's in the building this morning he's here now knows your thoughts who you are where you come from what you've done for Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever one more quote then we'll go to Second Timothy David if he did wrong and taking your eye the high Tide's wife the lovely Bathsheba was going to be the father of her child and he caused her husband to be killed in battle but when the prophet Nathan come in and revealed his sins to him then David thought on his ways notice that and he turned himself to repentance and setc cloth and Ashes that's the way to turn God heard him notice a statement here God will always hear a man or a woman that will turn their feet to his testimony so we have to be open and honest with God don't try to hide anything just pour your heart out to them be honest if you messed up that's okay be honest about it God knows you're going to mess up but you learn from that girl from don't let something you've done wrong embarrass you or hinder your growth your best it's best to get out to God because I might get out to the open second Timothy chapter 20 verse chapter 20. second Timothy verse 20. the Bible huh second Timothy oh sorry verse 19 actually nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his that everyone that nameth the name of Christ apart from iniquity we all know what iniquity is uh knowing to do something and not doing it so the scripture is calling us to depart from that When God says do something just do it so iniquity doesn't become come in your life and with verse 20 put in a great house they're not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth and some to honor and some to dishonor in verse 21 if a man therefore Purge himself from these so it's calling this has to be a purification a purging inside of us he shall be a vessel into honor see God see God's purpose and motive is to make us a vessel unto honor Sanctified and met for the Master's use notice that for the Master's use not for our own selfish use but so the master can use you like we we talked the other day go ye out that's one of the what the Master's uses for we're going to see in the scripture app to teach patient that's the Master's use and it says and prepared unto every good work verse 22. so this is a pure it's a purging that that needs to be in our vessels as I said before vices um anger issues those things need to be purged because eventually they're going to come out unexpectedly like what happened to David that that was not the real David a spirit got a whole David hearken to that spirit and it took it it took him further than he wanted to go corruption happened in his life because it took him further than he wanted to go not even realizing it says flee also youthful lust but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the Lord out of a what Pure Heart pureness of your heart is so guess I said be open with God Pure Heart yeah I think it was the scripture says confess your faults one to another scripture even tells us that as well it's good to talk about certain things with brothers or sisters they can pray for you help you they can guide you encourage you lead you the direction that God wants you to go God can use a brother and sister to speak to you can't put God In The Box but foolish and I learned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifes notice right here this one is the the word is calling us to be and the servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men notice this at to teach so we all have a uh job we can teach one another by the way we live our lives we can help disciple one another because that's what the scripture is telling us right here it says apt to teach patience verse 25 and meekness instructing those that oppose themselves so when you when you're doing that you're helping restore somebody that's I believe that's the mini Ministry of reconciliation because people don't even recognize that they're opposing themselves and say if God pre-adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth God could use you to speak something that will cause somebody to pray and soften their heart see God we're vessels that God has chosen he chose the foolishness of preaching for a reason and sometimes the holy spirit will strike you and and say this to this brother or sister and you want to make sure you hearken to that and not be disobedient like Saul was and look at the 26 what it says and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are take the captain by him at his will read a couple more quotes on our clothes the question is an internal question what vices are you holding on to what things have we let lay dormant in our lives that we should have dealt with years ago there are things in our life we need to deal with right now instead of pushing off for later it's not gonna get worse David the great man made a mistake a man that for God's Gonna think about that a man that forgot his own heart yet took bathsheet but think he could hide the very thing from God he had served all his life but God exposed him by Nathan the prophet but yet look at Dave when he was going out exiled from his own people rejected King his own daughter had been ravaged by her brother and other brothers had killed him and there was Absalom that that raised up and separated the Army causing revolutions and David his own father was excommunicated taken away rejected by his people going out of the city a little crippled old fellow dragging along there making fun of him spinning on him the guard pulled his sword I'll I'll let that dog said stay on him spit on my king and David said let him alone God told him to do that this is from the church age I believe Church age book those fiery flaming eyes of Judge are even now recording the lives of All Flesh I want to just really just take this to Heart running to and fro throughout the Earth there is nothing he does not know he knows the desires of the heart that's why motive is so important when God just didn't bring the motives for this for any old reason but he brought up for the motive of we need to check our motives because if David would have checked his motive he wouldn't have been in his predicament so it behooves us to make sure to seek after to ask God God is this motive pure there's anything that's hidden agendas please make it known to me open my eyes to it because I don't want to do anything to displease you there's nothing hidden that should not be revealed for all things are naked before him with whom we have to do think of it he knows even now what you are thinking praise God he does life is too short just to be living with our vices our dis our bad decisions led to our advices in the first place notice that our bad decisions led to our vices in the first place so let's turn around by making a good decision we always get what we expect when people expect anything well they usually get what you look for it's the mental attitude that you have so you guys have the right mental attitude brother Brandon saying we had the right mental attitude to overcome these things in our lives to even to overcome it remember this and never forget it the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude towards any promise of God it doesn't take Gifts of healing to heal the sick people uh any person here right now has a right to meet Satan anywhere if you're a Christian defeat him on any grounds he could stand up the fruit of our bad decisions can have long lasting impacts of Our Lives as we see David's that's why it's so important to self-examine the problem is we don't hold ourselves accountable for the bad decisions we need to analyze and to break down why we made the bad decision sister Shirley can come up if you would like and we'll close with Joshua 1 7. see we don't want to lose the joy of our salvation because you can I believe David lost that throughout the whole ordeal he and he asked God restore unto me and I can testify that this times in my life for I've lost a joy and I prayed for it and the lord gave it back to me he's faithful Joshua 1 7 and we will close let me get to it first myself so it says only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observed to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand to the left that thou mayest Prosper wherever thou goest we're going to read to verse 9. this book of the law shall not depart out thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night so the word of God needs to be constantly put before us we need to be constantly when we read praying for God to Quicken it in our hearts for us to live that word the word needs to be in our the Forefront of our minds and our hearts because you can't separate God in his word but you got to mix it with prayer you get prayer is so important because you can read too much but you can't pray too much but uh to observe to do according all that is written there and for then thou shall make the way prosperous and thou shalt have good success verse 9 have not commanded thee be strong of good courage Be not Afraid neither be dismayed for the Lord that God is with thee whatsoever thou goest as a promise we could listen if we could sing uh brother Ryan didn't know but I actually wanted to sing the song after service created me a clean heart I didn't know he's not even going to pick it until I saw the songs but we can sing that song again I just feel like it's very fitting uh just it's for the service we could all stand creating me a clean heart oh God and renew your right Spirit Within Me creating me a clean heart oh God let's make it personal and renew right Spirit Within Me oh cast me not away from thy presence oh Lord thy Holy Spirit from me [Music] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renewable right Spirit Within Me is lifted to the Lord Make It Personal that's your prayer tonight creating me a clean heart oh God

unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew a right Spirit within let's sing that verse one more time oh cast me not away from thy presence oh Lord [Music] Spirit from me [Music] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and renew our spirit Within Me Maybe She plays that soft listen spot our heads in a word of Prayer maybe tonight you just realize there's things in your lives that have just been laid dormant and you've never thought you could overcome it or you just thought that you could just live with it oh God just help us Lord just to overcome these things if you feel that way just raise your hand in your heart you have to raise it just raise your hand in your heart the Lord knows and this asks the Lord is to help you to overcome this thing help and overcome is to be obedient in all things he's a gracious God he hears even your tears that fall on the ground and God tonight word as humbly is asking just to give us the overcoming power just to overcome these vices that in our lives just overcome these things that have beset us for so long because Lord when you died you died for our deliverance you died for our healing you died for uh a new creature in Christ for us to become and Lord we want to become that new creature in Christ we want to be exactly what you've called us to be you've called us to be Sons and Daughters of God and we want to go into that full adoption Lord we want to you your word says will be just like you and you're not a man that will lie your word is the truth Lord and you said you're calling a bride without a spot or a wrinkle Lord we want every stone unturned in our life we want everything dismayed right in your sight Lord we don't care what man thinks we care what you think you want to be pleasing until the end of the day you're not going to ask us how we how we please man but you're going to ask us did we please you and Lord we only have one life to live may this life be solely dedicated unto you Lord for however many years we have left or to the Rapture would come we want to live uh this pleasable unto you Lord we want to be just what your word is calling us to be Just Like You Lord maybe when we talk May others hear you Lord when we thank Lord make those thoughts glorify you Lord when we would just act may they glorify you may all things that we do may we dis glorify you in word and indeed Lord help us Lord our pray as we need thee we ask all these things Jesus Christ's name we pray amen [Music] salvation let's sing one more time [Music] [Music] oh God spirit [Applause]
