stay Come Into My Heart Lord Jesus into my heart into my my heart Come Into My Heart Lord Jesus come in today come in to stay Come Into My Heart Lord Jesus one more time into my heart into my heart Come Into My Heart Lord Jesus come in today come in to stay Come Into My Heart Lord Jesus amen I love that we're singing that that is not just for the new believer who hasn't had Christ in his heart that's for the believer who wants more of Christ into his heart and to stay there there's times that we can grieve the Lord and disappoint him and and um I know if Jesus is always strong in my heart then there's there's just less chance I'm going to sin and displease him David said I hide Thy word I hide his word in my heart that I not sin against them so I don't believe we can have too much of Jesus amen amen well God bless you turn with me if you would to the book of St Matthew chapter 16 St Matthew chapter 16 say praise the Lord for all those that are here today I'm very thankful for each one of you I'm also thankful for those of you who are uh uh concerned about your health and being safe and especially those of you that are sick and wanting to keep the sickness out of the church I just think it's a wonderful thing it's a wise thing and may God bless you and we're looking forward to the time that we could all be together again amen amen well before we begin reading let's look to the author of this book amen Heavenly Father we come to you Lord with uh Lord is perhaps one of the first songs that we sung about being humble as humbly as we know how Lord our dependency is on you at this time we got an education we went to school we're able to read but Lord without the Holy Spirit we don't really know what these words truly mean and we're asking today that you would give us the revelation of your precious word and the subject that you have for us Lord as the word is being min ministered Lord you know there's various needs in all of our Lives you know the things that we're facing sicknesses and fears questions and Lord we're just living in a very unstable hour and we ask that the Holy Spirit would come and just uh calm the Troubled Waters and bring us Lord to a stable place with you we thank you for these things now Lord we pray your blessings on this service in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Matthew chapter 16 starting with verse number 15 this is a very familiar scripture about Revelation and Jesus uh asked the question to his disciples he says but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said well Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art petered Upon This Rock I will build my my church and the gates of house shall not Prevail against it amen God bless you you may be seated we want to entitle the service today Christian stability and many things could be said about Christian stability uh but we just want to help us to become more stable and I'm usually when I think about subjects I like to kind of want to do a a complete subject and try to take a balance and and and just do the whole thing and it's really hard to do that because there's so much so much in in really all these sermons but we just want to have for a subject tonight stabilizing your walk with God stabilizing your walk with God every vehicle has what's called a stabilizer and uh without the stabilizer the car will go down the road it will function it will go over bumps it will still get you to where you got to go but the stabilizer it does help bring a stability to the ride showing showing there um a little a purpose but some points I want to bring out about our opening of scripture here um when we think about Christian stability remember it's personal first uh Jesus is talking to his disciples about what other people are saying and then he turns and he makes it personal but but what do you say it's between you and God so when you talk about Christian stability it really has nothing to do with the person you're sitting next to the person you live with the person you walk with the person that's speaking to you that ministers to you it is totally between you and God so you have no one to blame but yourself but you have no one to give glory to except God because he's the one that stabilizes us you can only receive stability from God man cannot give it to you man cannot give you the stability that the devil can't even come against the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against the stability that only God can give you now a man can help you they said if a man talks you in something somebody smarter than him can come along and talk you talk you out of it talk you into something different a different type of a car different uh shoes or or or or a different phone right if you had a chance uh with with five different salesmen and and five different phones it probably would be a little bit harder to choose one right so the stability that we're looking for in Christian stability it can only come from God it is the rock of Christian stability where God continues to reveal himself to you personally that becomes the very building in which God chooses to be in that's the church notice this is about his church it this is not about our lives our jobs our families it's about our church it it it's about God's church that that he connects the revealing of Jesus Christ with the place that he decides to dwell in so it's important that we find Christ when we come to church here yes we've got needs and yes there's we need we want answers we want directions but if we're interested in God building his church in us it's not about any revealing of any other thing but who he is God could reveal to me every place on our property that has uh some sort of uh value to it right some sort of minerals or Golds or diamonds or uh oil or something and and that would be a wonderful thing but it would have nothing to do with building his church in me so just trying to show that Christian stability can only come from God about God and not just about us all right Peter had a revelation who Jesus was but you notice it wasn't enough now this is important to understand why wasn't it enough he still needed God inside of him he knew in this scripture who Jesus was there was no doubt there was no question but because the Holy Spirit wasn't inside of him he got to a place that he actually lied and he said he didn't know who God was didn't know who Jesus was true so he didn't have the Christian stability that he needed just by Revelation alone he needed God inside of him am so important we can't under overemphasize the importance of getting more of the Holy Ghost do not be satisfied with how much you have get more get more because the more of the Life of Christ is inside you the more that the word becomes real to you what Christian stability is not let me start with that Christian stability it is not speaking in an unknown language or God us using your vessel at times that's not Christian stability it's not knowing the message or the messenger or the Mysteries or or even who your pastor is it's not repentance or being baptized correctly or attending church it's not measured by your moral compass or your opinion about really what's happening in the world affairs right now that's not Christian stability now the definition of just stability is the state or the quality of being stable you know you're not allowed to put those words in the word when you're trying to get the definition so now we're going to to find out what stable is but finishing stability it is firmness in position so now we're just thinking about this naturally for a minute so we can understand what it is in Christianity ity it's continuous without change it's permanence in chemistry it's a resistance to chemical change or uh dis uh dis intergration it's resistance to change especially Sudden Change or deterioration it's a steadfastness it's a consistency as of character or purpose so some words like stability steadfastness strength soundness Poise and balance see all these things are words of stability now the definition of stable is it's not likely to fall to give way as a structure a support a foundation affirm or study now obviously Peter did not not have that when he had the revelation we can't depend on getting the revelation of the word and letting the Holy Spirit of the word become left behind so when God gives you a revelation he shows you something I want you to remember the words that Jesus said he said but wait and T until you be endued with with the power from on high to make that word that I just gave you live and stand the test amen amen amen it means able or likely to continue or last firmly established enduring or permanent a stable government resistant to Sudden Change or deterioration a stable an example is a stable economy is the aim of every government of course we certainly would like a stable government in our country Would we not steadfast not waving or changeable not subject to now listen to this not subject to emotional instability or illness sane or mentally sound so those are some good words of course we would have a pretty I good idea what stability would be but Christian stability is I want you to take those words and apply them to your spiritual walk Christian stability is not necessar possessing the ability to most likely not fall or fail but rather possessing the stable attitude of getting up as soon as you fall because we can never be at a place where we're just not going to make mistakes we're not going to get upset we're not going to be bothered we're we're not going to fall you as long as you're human you're going to make mistakes so Christian stability is not keeping yourself from doing that Proverbs 24:16 says for a just man falleth seven times and riseth up again see that's Christian stability but the wicked shall fall into Mischief so they fall just like the just men but in other words they stay down in their situation they make an excuse while it's okay they're unstable they're double-minded they think that it's okay to do this right now they feel they can still be a Christian down there that's why they don't get back up right that's not Christian stability Christian stability starts in the heart of a Believer it starts inside the core Proverbs 23:7 says for as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so if his heart is found in two different places then it will try to lead in two different directions you ever like been at a restaurant and you're looking at the menu I don't need to say anything more you know what I'm going to say what do I like what do I want you know I should ask somebody else what I should get when they don't even know what I'm feeling like but I'm going to ask them and I'm G put my confidence in somebody else who doesn't even know what I feel like today unstable two different I'm it's between this and this do I want breakfast or do I want lunch do I want a coffee or do I want pop or you know should I just get water tea and you become I'm not sure so you ask the waitress what do you think I should get Matthew chapter 6 verse 21 for where your treasure is there will your heart be also and we're going to see a number of these scriptures from our men's meeting for where your treasure is there will your heart be also but you can't have your treasure in two different places this is what's important we try the devil's always trying to get us to do that you can have God and you can have the world you can be involved with God but then you can have your own life too you can have God's will and you can have your will you can't have your treasure in the things of God and the things of the world Matthew 6 24 no man can serve two masters for E either he will hate the one and love the other or else he'll hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mamon we can't spiritually love God and carnally love the things of this world Amen God won't allow it he won't be part of it you can try the devil will will will will get you to go that area but eventually God will get out of your life he told us in St John chapter 15 that unless we stay connected to him stay connected to the vine that uh we won't bear the fruit we won't have the life he he refuses to be our joy to be our peace to be our love if we separate from him and try to find our consolation and our our our our hope and our our our peace and our gratification and our and whatever we're looking for out here in the world 1 John chap 2:1 15 If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him God God will not take second place if he isn't Lord of everything he's not Lord at all we're these are in my notes brothers and these are the very things that came out in our men's meeting if he's not the master of everything he won't be Master at all he will not allow us to serve two masters Jesus said in the last days men's Hearts would be failing them for fear think about the hour we're living in men are paying attention to the wrong Master Jesus would not allow us to be in a state of of of demonic forces and powers to make us down and depressed that ain't what God would lead us to obviously we're listening to the wrong master we're listening to the wrong spirits Paul prophesied about the future in 2020 that the churchgoing people would become lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God so now we got some whose hearts are are failing for fear and they're just so distrupt about there's no uh stability in the world and then you've got the the churchgoing people who feel uh somewhat good but they're stuck in leoda and they're finding that that they're in love with getting pleased more there in love with God two masters you cannot serve God in this world at the same time amen so somewhere down the road you're going we're going to lose the joy of the Lord you can't be bothered by the world and you can't get into the pleasures of the world right either one are going to zap the strength out of you that's true zap your stability right out of you another example of this is the parable of the S when the word was preached it fell into a man's heart that had been mixed with the things of the world now what happened the word was preached they received the word and they brought forth fruit but because there was another seed in there a seed of the world a cares of life that it choked out the word now why was that more stronger than the word I thought nothing's more powerful than the word because God will not allow himself to be in a place that you choose to have part of the world there he just won't take second true amen so these are good examples that you can't serve two masters amen eventually God is going to get choked out of our life in the course the devil never tells us that when he gives us Temptation so stability must start at the core of our heart our deeper thoughts originate from our heart we ought to be learning how to be more singl minded because that's the problem the devil's always trying to get us go two different directions for God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power love and what a sound mind we need a sound mind for Christian stability right amen A sound mind comes from the spirit of God in order to have Christian stability a Believer must have a sound mind it's not an option it's a must James chapter 1 1 verse 5 James you thought I was calling on you didn't you when I said that James you are the one you are the one but you you're much older than five James chapter 1 verse5 if any of you lack wisdom let them ask of God that giveth the all men liberally so he's no respector of persons if you just ask and he uth not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith nothing wavering no reluctance no seesaw no footing around nothing wavering for he that waver or hesitates is like a wave of the sea that's driven with the wind and it's toss so I just want you to picture you're staring at that beautiful uh ocean and the shoreline and the waves are coming in and they're beating against the rocks and um this is what God describes as someone who waivers right I woke up in the morning and saw the water how it was just as peaceful and calm as could be stable stable ships really wouldn't uh I don't think the FR Gerald would have went down if the waters would have been stable so Satan wants to to cause an unstable condition in your mind because he's trying to shipwreck you trying to bring things in your life to get you so bottled up and so consumed with things that you you can't be stable in walk with the Lord because we have that mindset that well as long as I go to church as long as I still believe in God and all those things you're just showing a wavering for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord James was so sure of the Revelation that he had that God was so against without faith it's impossible to please him but this man that waivers he's not going to receive anything of the Lord it would be better for him to be humble and to say Lord I believe but help thou my unbelief at least he's staying stable with his Direction amen that's right that's true he's not pretending he's not acting he's not being storefront right am a double-minded man is unstable in every single way because as a man think it so is he right it's so easy you ever have a ever had two people telling you what to do Brother Bruce if you're listening to this I know you know what I'm talking about when you have two bosses telling you what to do brother Mark you've had this before it it you feel so uncomfortable you know you're wrong no matter what you do because you've been told two different things and it's so uncomfortable when you're unstable thinking about where should I go here should I do this should I do this should I do that and it's like you're trying to be the one that's making the decision somehow there's another Spirit has gotten in there and has caused you to to um question the word in other words I'm going to make an excuse why I don't have to there's this reason right here I don't have to follow the word God sees it God knows God understands my heart well I would go with that if you could show me that scripture if after you bum a ride to church and you make it there in Sunday and that's the only other time you can can do is get your your car working after church I'm all for it because that's the ox in the ditch that means if I walk out and one of my goats got their head between the chicken wires something's wrong I got to help that but we go ahead and we make Sunday the extra day and then we say well if we just had more time for the Lord when he already gave it to us but what are we doing with it using it for oursel don't be double-minded so when your heart goes into different directions your mind will try to follow the same two directions this creates an unstable condition James is declaring a Believer who is who's in this condition is unstable in all his ways and how can a Christian have stability in his life when he's unstable in all of his ways may God help every one of us and I I would that the whole church was watching our young people are are all the people that want to become more established that's what this word is for stability starts in our hearts for as a man thinketh so is he so learning how to be led is not a gift from God it's a character that we learn to develop Proverbs 3:6 in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and depart from Evil so acknowledging the Lord in all their ways will lead to Christian stability the problem is is most of the time we either got it figured out or we want it to go a certain way so there's no need to acknowledge the Lord you don't acknowledge them how is he going to Dr well I just know because you know we've done this before God wants he's the only one that can stabilize us he's the the stabilizer for our life and when we are wise in our own eyes and we think we got things figured out that's when we need to really choose to fear the lord I could be wrong about this situation I know it happened like but but maybe the Lord wants us to pray about it again because maybe he doesn't want it so when you're wise in your own eyes God calls that evil that's truly what evil is our flesh is evil acknowledge the Lord in all thy ways will bring Christian stability the Lord is not going to hand that to us on a silver platter it's not a gift you have to fight for it you have to humble yourself you have to learn to not be wise in your own eyes you have to remember you don't got it we have to learn to fear the lord it's a choice that we're constantly faced with every day the devil is going to let you know you're so smart you're so spiritual you know what's happening you know what to do you've got this it's an easy choice that is wise in your own eyes this is what we need to combat and overcome for Christian stability it's not being able to figure out a situation it's about acknowledging the Lord about the situation I could be wrong four words words we learn to say if we would learn to say them more I could be wrong and from the heart and really mean it from the heart because I could be wrong is what's going to help you acknowledge the Lord and when you acknowledge Him it's a promise he's going to direct our paths he may not do it right that minute but it's going to happen because you fulfilled your part amen 2 Corinthians chapter 10:3 2 Corinthians chapter 10:3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal in other words it's it's not oh yeah I got this I know I'm spiritual I've got discernment on this those uh are carnal weapons I mean seriously I mean my my mom and my dad and his girlfriends and those people that tried to raise me would try to express they know what they're talking about it was a carnal weapon it was their knowledge it was their their tuition their intuition their all their ISS it was what they were using to bring their point across we are walking in the flesh we do have to deal with this situation but we don't use carnality for the weapons of our Warfare are not car But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds just pull those thoughts down when you think you got it pull that down those are evil thoughts be not wise in your own eyes just pull that down oh but they're so strong brother John I just feel it so strong I just know pull it down amen pull it down get them out of there verse five casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God well the knowledge of God is to be not wise in your own eyes to acknowledge the Lord in all thy ways that is the knowledge of God that is the word of God so anything outside of that to me is a is a high thought it's a it's an imagination it's something that's not the will of God anything that exalts itself against the knowledge of God to me that could be the knowledge of God is I could be wrong because that's what the prophet taught me and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ now in our minds we can have thoughts bouncing all over the place just you know and you have to bring every thought in subjection now that's your job Christian stability you need to bring that thought in subjection if you don't you're opening yourself up for instability or a double mind in other words I'm going to acknowledge the Lord about this situation and he's going to direct your path don't try to figure it out on your own and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled so when Satan is attacking us attacking our minds we're in a battle God is still expecting in obedience and it starts with our mind we don't allow the devil in there we don't let them stay and if we did stay we thought something and we said something to get back up amen okay so now look at this do you look on the things after the outward appearance that's carnal If any man trust to himself if any man trust to himself that he is that he is Christ let him of himself think this again that he is that as he is Christ even so are we Christ in other words what's the message that Paul is getting across he's talking to people who think who believe they belong to God and he says I know that you believe you're you're you're walking with the Lord You're of God but if you are acknowledged that what I am telling you is of the Lord I'm walking with the Lord I'm and I'm telling you what God wants God wants you to cast those thoughts down they'll that's what's bringing so much instability because you got you allow the devil to go in your mind and all these imaginations and and things and you just let them float around and you don't bring anything into captivity you never say this is this and that is that you just well it's all just part of the whole shebang acknowledge the Lord in all thy ways it's the proof that you're choosing to fear the lord when you take time to say Lord this is my situation this is this is what's happening it right there you're choosing to fear the lord a lot of times the devil's going to tell you what don't make a difference you you don't got time anyways to wait for his answer just go he's sneaky but I'm telling you if you acknowledge the Lord if you put him in the situation he will stabilize the situation he will stabilize your life he'll stabilize your mind because you're inviting the stabilizer in your prayer is the knock on God's door and his voice spoken to you personally is when he chooses to open that door and I think this is important to understand because the Bible says ask and it shall be ask and you shall ask and you shall find ask and should be given seek and you shall find knocking the door shall be open you have to keep on keep on so sometimes when we ask the Lord and he doesn't respond we stand and we're still knocking I want you to picture you're knocking on the door I'm still waiting I'm still waiting for an answer Lord I'm not going forward until I hear you because his voice is when the door opens then you know the answer to that situation prayer is your vehicle to God I want you to picture it's your vehicle to God how much you pray is how fast your vehicle goes the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man it avails much he gets down the road pretty quick he gets the job done now the scripture I just want to try to bring it balance the scripture says that before we'll ask he will answer in other words the answer is already on the way God knows about it but we're living in an hour where it's hard to pray it's hard to spend time praying but God is requiring more prayer he even brings out when when uh when the son of man returns shall he find faith on the earth and that whole Parable is that men ought to pray and not faint amen so our prayers are the knock on Heaven's Door and his voice to us personally becomes the direction for our lives but that has nothing to do with God building his church in us but still it's the direction for our life and when you're seeking something different than where to go where to live what job to take should I get this car Lord help me with this with that with the with the other is it okay to buy this to go on this vacation to have fellowship with these people in other words when you're seeking to know God more your prayers are still the knock on God's door it just you're wanting the information for your personal life and not for God's church building but his voice spoken to you personally is the door that opens to you the revelation of Jesus Christ when his voice speaks to you that's the door when his when God speaks to you and reveals to you who he is that's the door of Revelation open to you and that's the door that will bring building blocks to the church he wants to live in I'll imagine for a moment that God spends you you want God to help you with everything you come to him and you acknowledge Him about everything except becoming him in other words I got a whole list of things that I want help Direction leadership for God promised he'd direct those things in my life but I spend very little time saying I want to know you more because that's the only thing that he's building his church in we and Satan's always telling us you know Jesus enough you've been a Christian for so long you you've been bapt you know you got you know you no need anymore you just stay busy with all these other things in your life just just try to get God and all those other thing see the trick it would be better if you didn't have anything nothing but you spent all your time seeking to know God more he's the only one that can stabilize your life you you God could an you with so many things and never be stable in your life we don't want a revelation of which restaurant to eat at or what property to hunt or where to vacation at those things God is not building his church in that now imagine having revelation of everything except the revelation of Jesus Christ for a second just imagine that you could understand all the Mysteries you could have all knowledge you could have all Faith so that you could remove mountains the Bible says but if you didn't have the revelation of Jesus Christ you'd still be nothing because Jesus Christ is love he is the love of God and we're nothing without Christ we're nothing without Christ human stability will mimic Christian stability I don't want you to get these two mixed up because people can be pretty stable naturally and unstable spiritually human stability will look on things after the outward appearance and may not love someone who's hurt or offended you right that's human stability human stability will trust in himself think and feel that they can make it without the person who had done them wrong this is this is a good one well you know they should I know they should did that you know what I don't need them not knowing they're part of the body but we feel bad because they offended us not realizing that we're the ones that need to intercede for them there is a reason to love your enemies there's a reason to pray for those that despitefully use you isn't just to make your life more miserable it's because God wants to use your vessel to intercede for them now Christian stability is being able to forgive seven times 70 not just seven times Jesus said to Peter that is not stable 7 time 70 it just keeps going not questioning Christian stability is not questioning if we feel like it or not you know if somebody offends you and you have to keep forgiving them over and over you know you want to sit there and question about this thing I don't know if I feel like doing this it's not judging the person's sincerity first before you forgive them well I don't know quite how sincere they are about this that's not Christian stability now not being afraid that it won't be the last time how many times you do that I you know I forgave you about this so you know what it's probably not going to be the last time either that's not Christian stability it's not making some excuse of why you're not going to forgive Christian stability is following the word of God line upon line regardless of how you feel regardless of what you think regardless of what you imagine the word becomes your absolute becomes your stabilizer man shall not live but by every word of God Christian stability is not the knowledge of God's stable word it's following every word of God that's what Christian stability is we get under the the feeling of I know I know I know the knowing does not stabilize you it may puff you up it may make you feel good for a while but it doesn't stabilize you knowledge is not Revelation right so I say this when you know you should pray then pray true true when you know you should pray in the spirit don't be satisfied with just prayer get in the spirit and pray labor to enter into the spirit and pray in the spirit when's the last time you really forced yourself to get in the spirit and pray when we know we should love one another then get to the place where you can love one another it's not the knowledge of it it's not the quote of it it's not uh so is worth 10,000 worlds get to the place where you're living how the value of a soul there's a total difference Christ stability is different than just trying to stabilize yourself as a person I could invite a brother Mark over to my house bring them over to my house and act like I know all the different things about what's in my field all the trees all the rocks and come across as if I really got it together and when he leaves talk behind his back but in his eyes it looks stable but Christianity that is not Christianity are you with me all right so if we know we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together and all the more as we see that day approaching then we need to labor to be faithful now obviously that's not to you that are here and that's not to those that are are sick or concerned uh about the co I'm not speaking to any of you I'm speaking to those who are not afraid to go to church but are still not in church because this word is what establishes US believe in the Lord thy God so shall you be established it's Christian stabilizer but if we use our mind we're going to become unstable pretty soon we're going to miss church and we're going to think there's nothing wrong with it and that's dangerous we know we should be reaching out for Souls but knowing things does not make us stable knowledge without love only opens the door now listen to this knowledge without love only opens the door for instability unstable or double-minded Minds in other words your love is for the world but your knowledge is of god you need the love for God to make his word become your absolute without enough love we won't follow the word we won't follow his footsteps we won't follow that voice that says what we should be doing in closing Christian stability is not about being unshakeable it's not be it's not about being in the message for 20 years it's not about being unmovable from your personal belief it's about being unmovable in your growth with God not just growing personally or in knowledge but growing God's kingdom that's real Christian stability because we know we've been taught that that is what God's Plan of Redemption is that's what God's purpose is he wants to build his church he wants not only Peter to know who Jesus was but he wanted Peter to go tell others who Jesus was so he could build his church in them brother John give me a scripture for that one all right I'm so glad you asked 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse1 15 this will be our last scripture 1 Corinthians 15:58 therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable but notice there's no period there there's no you figure out what that means no he tells us what that really means it means always abounding in the work of the Lord that doesn't mean well I did work last month last year last week last always abounding in the work of the Lord is unmovable is steadfast for what the very purpose of Christian stability a Christian is is always moving forward always for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord you know the devil will come and tell you that our labor is always in vain we don't see the results we want well that wasn't worth it maybe the Lord didn't tell you to do that so you're just doing that in your flesh oh he'll he'll get he'll get you to believe anything as long as he gets you to stop working for the Lord personally I want to be guilty of this I want to be guilty of telling you to work work even when you don't hear thus sayeth the Lord if you're going to air air on that side that's that's how brother Brandon was he said I can't I can't say the Lord told me to do this but he says I can't sit around waiting in other words occupy until I come I want to grade what you did with your time off your little vacation your little your little Co vacation I want to grade what you did occupy till I come Christian stability is not standing still it's not saying my name is John Martin I'm stable on the Rock it's not Christian stability Christian stability is the ability to keep moving to keep moving forward in growth despite all the distractions that we come across all the work all the sickness the family issues the pleasures of life the demands of Life the cares of life and still moving forward not just I'm a rock move forward do something with your life that's Christian stability that's real Christian stability I know you believe I know you believe I just say God is calling us more to believe because there's many things God wants to reveal to us many things God wants us to do but if we get so caught up in our own lives and we just have this vision of just bringing God in all this and forget God's kingdom forget about always being abounding in the work of the Lord because we just don't got time i' I've got so many other things I got going are you with me all right let's Stand Together Christian stability stabilizing your walk with God I know we live on a bumpy road I don't know how many times we've had to get new stabilizers because you can't control it when those things go out you just start to shake and you can't direct you can't control it but when God stabilizes our our walk well it doesn't matter what distractions are here we don't what trials we're going through what problems what's happening who did this who said that what's happening at work what's happening know stable stable God's called me to reach out stable always always abounding in the work of the Lord amen let's sing I've Anchored In Jesus amen I've Anchored In Jesus that's real Christian stability and we need it in this hour yeah you know I purposely don't look at my phone for about the first three to four hours every day spend the time with the Lord I'm not saying you should all spend that much time with the Lord but what I am saying is we get in the habit of picking up the phone who call it's a it's a it's a blessing to just help stabilize you more amen upon life boundless oan where Mighty Billows roll I fixed my hope in Jesus bless anchor of my soul When Trials Fierce sail me and storms are gathering or I rest upon his mercy and trust him more I've Anchored In Jesus the storms of life are brave I've Anchored In Jesus

to become more stable stable in our thoughts stable in how we handle things stable and how things uh try to affect our lives Lord may this message help us in the days that are before us as we go through through situations and the devil tries to bring confusion in our mind and get us off track oh God we need the Holy Spirit we need it living so powerful and so strong in our lives that we can just tell that devil to get behind us we can just resist him steadfast that we can recognize his tricks Lord I pray that you would so fortify us fill us with more of you Lord God help us to become more stable Lord we're thankful for the stability that you've given every one of us but Lord we're hungering for more we're Desiring more we want to to be that that Lighthouse when the storms are are
