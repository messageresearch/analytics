amen Let's uh we just have a James has a testimony in maybe a song did you wanna come up James I'm sorry so uh I just have a testimony of how God's been using you lately um lately God's been using my gift of playing the piano God's helped me extend my spiritual life and my gift to playing the piano wait for them before over the past one year and I see some God things God's been doing in my life that I couldn't see before and he's been using my gift of the piano to get his people in his presence I couldn't used to sing and play together at all and I see God has saved me from several situations where I wasn't prepared and the Saints wouldn't be able to get into his presence and worship him and I would like to share those moments with you so the first time this happened I was in another church it had a bigger congregation in our little Lighthouse here in Fenton so it was a lot more pressure on me and I was going to play a special with another person I felt God was wanting me to play the special alone but the church was bigger than ours and I never played in front of an audience bigger than 25 people so I asked this friend do you want to do it with me and they said yes so we went to this church for this special service and uh and we were going to play this special together but the thing was that wasn't God's will so we sat through the other specials and they started the service later I found out the message never even got to the song later this happened several more times to me because it wasn't God's time so that's my testimony I hope it encourages you and shows that God cares for every one of his children's needs no matter how the size God bless you [Music] he paid [Music] foreign [Music] sing a brand new song Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus [Music]

here Jesus is in Jesus is he all things are possible Jesus how many believe that tonight amen amen how many he's come to receive amen amen would like to open our Bibles to Matthew 14 and we'll start with verse 22. but before we begin reading like this to open up in a word of prayer and just invite the author to speak to our hearts personally this is bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you Lord for letting us be in your house this evening Lord we counted such a privilege and an honor Lord just to be in your house to receive from you Lord I pray just prepare our hearts Lord to soften the ground that we could receive your engrafted word Lord father I pray you move me your unworthy servant out the way Lord I don't have anything for the people Lord only you do and I pray you just open the windows of Heaven Lord in his poor Revelation Upon Us Lord and just write your word upon our hearts Lord and just Quicken that word into our hearts Lord and father may we all have a testimony that our hearts burn within us and that we heard personally from you dear Lord Jesus and I pray you just bless each need that we would have Lord spiritual and physical Lord and father just give us eyes to see and ears to hear Lord what you'll have to say to us personally we ask all these things in Jesus Christ and we pray amen so reverse um 22 very familiar scriptures readings whether it be seated after we finish this one and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go before him onto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and we had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary verse 25 and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spoke unto them sing be of good cheer it is I be not afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind of mistress he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou little faith wherefore it is thou doubt may the Lord add the blessings upon his word you may be seated and so sometimes we're in a familiar situation like Peter was Jesus tells us to come and we come by faith and then everything starts to go wrong around us trials start coming issues start happening in the family and then we start to take our eyes off of Jesus before I get any further the type of this message is keep your eyes on Christ amen and then the subject keeping your eyes on his promises see this is one of the hardest ages to live in because we have so much distractions so many problems arising we see governments arising we see issues Wars going on and all these things that are trying to shake our faith all these things are trying to shake us to get us to move but we have to be we have to stand upon the rock the unmovable Rock you and that's Jesus Christ our anchor has to be in him and him alone it can't be the next president win an election it can't be uh the the next this that or that or that the next new TV show the next new intervention see these things are going to fail these things can't hold you these things aren't gonna uh help you any any way in shape or form and so let's go to Mark 4 verses 35 through 41 so we just see how important faith is to keep our eyes on Christ no matter if the ship is sinking no matter if the boat's filling with water we have to just believe that Christ is with us he promised with you and in You Until the End of the Age so if that promise is is better than gold it's way better than gold and so go to mark IV and we'll start with verse 35 another very familiar scripture amen amen let me get there myself and the same day when the Eve was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side so another very it's like almost a very familiar uh picture being painted again and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there was also with him in other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beaten to the ship so was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship I love that he was there the whole entire time asleep on the pillow and they awake him and they say nothing to him Master cares and thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind cease knows a great call and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith so we see in both scriptures Jesus is mentioning them having no faith and so we gotta have faith in every situation that we're going on God's going to lead us into situations where we've never been before Uncharted Territory and we have to believe that God is leading us the right way because God just doesn't lead you to lead you he just doesn't put you in Trials to put you in Trials but he has a specific purpose for you in that trial growth in that trial and we have to believe that God is seeing something in us that we can't see he's trying to bring out some potential that we may not be able to see but we have to trust that that potential is going to be brought out and it could be months it could be years whatever it is we have to trust that his will is going to be done if we let it so through the hardest times the Far East trials we have to keep the faith we have to keep the faith he even said in uh if we go to Jude this is not my notes but we'll go to Jude chapter one Jude chapter one very familiar scripture and we'll go to verse three beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints so the same faith that Peter and Paul and Matthew and John and disciples have we can have that same faith today it's still the same God that was in the book of Acts that is is today he's the same yesterday today and forever we believe that if Jesus could could save the disciples out that storm then Jesus can do the same thing of our life if we have the faith we don't have to cry and say Lord save me we're going to know that he's going to save us because he's promised to save us he's promised he's a God that comes in the a present time and the wonderful time and so we just see this common salvation is the same salvation they had back in that time we have to believe that the same holy ghost that gave them leadership that changed their nature can change our nature right now this very moment the preaching of the word we have to be able to receive it our hearts have to be hungry for that word for God to change us verse 4 for there are certain men creeping unawares who are before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness in denying the only Lord God in our Lord Jesus Christ so we just see that we had earnestly contend we earnestly continue you gotta fight every inch John the Baptist said the Kingdom of Heaven has suffered violence and the violent take it by force so you have to take your walk by force the devil is not going to lay down and this lets you have it easy but he's going to put every roadblock every fiery Dart everything he can to stop you from getting to your goal to keep your eyes on Christ because he knows we he knows when you get your eyes on Christ then he is defeated but if he can get you just to turn away for one second like he did Peter you will begin to sink and this is let's say this is the hardest age to live in but it's not impossible through God I can do all things through Christ who what strengthens me he'll give you the strength that you need he'll give you the the Boost that you need he'll carry you when you can't walk anymore amen so no matter what's happening in our life no matter if the waters if we're drop will think we're drowning if our ship is sinking just believe that Jesus is in the hindered part of your ship you got to believe that he's in control but you got to let him be in control first amen a little quote from brother Brandon proof of his resurrection the emancipation of the Proclamation has been signed you're free and you just don't know it but Faith must have a Divine resting place so Faith as half the resting place you can't question you can't doubt you can't waver but your faith has to be so anchored that nothing can move you your faith has to be unmovable no matter what the situation may be if you have faith in God you've got to have Divine resting amen a place to be and there's no better place and no other Divine Way only through God's holy word so the only absolute that you're going to have in this world is this Bible it's the only thing that won't lie to you is the only thing that will be manifested to you is this Bible the government's going to lie um your family member might lie to you not purposely but by accident but this word can never lie the scripture says he's not a man that can tell a lie he can't amen he's never failed not one time and we can all testify of God coming through every single time it may not have been our timing what we wanted but God is going to come in the right time you just got to believe that when it says they that wait upon the Lord they shall renew their strength so you got to believe it it's not a time period that he gives you but he says they that wait upon the Lord and he'll give you the strength in the due season the perfect season that you need it in amen so we see the enemy he's constantly trying to get us to doubt and we look back in the Garden of Eden we see what happened to Eve the devil made Eve think that there was something better outside of God's word that God what God Said wasn't good enough but there was more than what God Said and if Satan can get us to doubt One spec one inch one percentage a point percentage then he's got us to compromise and we can't compromise with the word of God see we're expecting God to do all these wonderful things in our life but we're not following the simple words the ABCs of the word see we can't expect God to move in our life if we're compromising with what God is calling us to do obedience is better than sacrifice so no matter the situation we got to be obedient to the word Haman so what does it mean to keep your eyes focused on something it means you're only focus is on one particular thing which is Jesus Christ and you're not letting anything else distract you you know your goal you know your target I need Jesus in my life I need him every hour every second in my life that's why prayer must be a priority in your life prayer is that's your Lifeline if you have no prayer life you you have no life and so prayer must be our priority no matter how busy we are as brother Marty said no matter how hectic our day is but prayer is going to be the keeping power that you need because prayer is the direct connection between the throne room of God that's how you get to know God more that's how he can answer prayers is you building a personal relationship with him and the more you build that relationship with him the more you get to know him the more you see how he he thinks the more you see how his ways are because the Bible tells us his ways are not our ways and his thoughts are not our thoughts so the more we can get that mind of Christ the more we can spend time in prayer and that's how the mind of Christ is obtained is through prayer and look the word up Focus it's a central point of conscious concentration so an adjustment for a distinct Vision so we constantly got to focus our walk because sometimes we might get knocked off to the right and we're a little blurry we got to make sure that we're always doing self-examination amen to seeing who who we really are because there's a lot of times where we think that we're doing something right but in reality we're just a little bit off a couple centimeters and so that's why I see David was a man of uh self-examination and you see that self-examination really helps to know where you're at with your walk with God because it's so easy to think well I'm good enough I prayed today you know I'm not what I used to be two years ago or five years ago but you got to constantly be just taking inventory self-inventory amen I got a camera up there coming down I didn't know how to take a picture I looked through the thing and man I could see five or six different objects so I begin to focus it Billy said focus it they'll all come to one it's a good idea to do that you know you see things different when you go to focusing and use God's word for a focus on him I love that you'll see what I'm talking about but get it in Focus first you see so if you want to see God you have to see him in his word his word has to be revealed to you see you can't just try to seek God without putting the word together at one because God his word are one you can't separate the two because we got all these beautiful promises in here that what we're going to be what we're going to be right now and we got to believe that every promise in the book is mine personally you got to believe it personally not because brother John believes because you believe it personally right we got to get ourselves focused to whether we live or die sink or drown it's Calvary I love that Christ that's the thing God want God wants us to come back to so we got to just get focused at Calvary Christ even Paul said this statement I know anything but Christ and him crucified that's how personal we need to get with our walk because if it says Christ in him crucified then you're not going to get distracted because you're going to realize that if he didn't die for me I couldn't be here today I wouldn't be the man I am or the woman I am today because of what he did for me and if you keep that indebtedness it just helps you to keep focus on the prize keep focused on what he's calling us to be so we're living in age of great distraction how many can say Amen to that the prophet said it's the hardest age to live in we see all the pressure around us every pressure you can see kovid was before that great pressure put upon the whole entire world and there's so many other things trying to take our attention away from Christ it could be job situations it could be family problems it could be you fill in the blank it could be I got to pay my bills and this x amount of time where I got debt I got to pay off I can keep on going for the depressions that that Satan tries to get at us and the thing is Satan doesn't use necessarily bad things but he uses good things like family it could be family it could be whatever it is you fill in the blank with your business whatever it could be and the thing is what the devil does what that is he gets you to compromise say well God knows you need to pay this and he knows you need to do this you know you could you could take it you could take some time off today you know pray a little bit later today and that later today turns into tomorrow and that's how the devil works if he gets you to compromise and end she's going to take a mile that's just how he does and so but when we compromise we lose our strength amen because we see what happened to Adam and Eve they lost everything literally they lost everything by just compromising on point one percent of the word and so we can't compromise one iota line upon line precept upon precept that's just a thing that we have to do and that's the thing that broke The Fellowship Of Eden it's because Eve failed to keep the focus of her looking on God's word and listening to the reasonings of the enemy that's why you ever heard that statement a mind's a terrible thing to waste it's a very terrible thing to waste because the devil chose the mind and he's constantly going to put these thoughts into your head and you can't stop them from coming but you can stop them from staying in your mind and you got to just kick those reasonings out because the word of God doesn't reason the word of God is forever settled in heaven so if the word of God says I'm gonna be healed then I'm going to be healed if the word of God said that he's Jehovah Jireh he's going to provide for my knees and he's going to provide for my needs if if the word says I can have deliverance and guess what I'm going to have Deliverance if if the word says I can have uh Financial Freedom or uh let's see free of um living words if the word says that I can have a my family be saved then I believe my fame is going to be saved I got to apply that token I may not be able to see it right now but I know by eyes of faith that they're going to be saved because the word claims that they're going to be saved amen amen so if she stayed right with Gods so that settles it God said so but she didn't want to do that see she changed the focus of her glass and begin to see instead of being just one way there become two ways she saw well now maybe this man could be right maybe he is right now we know God is right and maybe his right this is just more light than what God Said you see there so we can't help between two opinions that's what the word tells us if God is God believe he's God if he's not then don't but he is God so why not believe him What's It Gonna Hurt You it's only going to help you amen so so we we see that we look at the back of the book and it says we win so why what what fear should we have he promised the victory God promised the victory amen we just have to follow the battle strategy no no person in history that won a war didn't have some sort of strategy that they had to follow they had to you go to World War II World War One you go to a civil war some form they had a battle strategy that if everybody wasn't in one Accord then they would have lost the battle so we want to see what our battle strategy is and the type of equipment that we need to fight this battle in Ephesians 6. this isn't something this isn't something that you just put on every once in a while but this is something that you need to have on a daily basis because the enemy knows that he can defeat you at any time anywhere if you're not connected with God but he knows if you're connected with God and have your proper Army attire on because who's a soldier here amen we're all soldiers on the cross right and what a soldier needs proper equipment right amen so go to Ephesians 6 and we'll start with verse 10. see first we got to recognize that our strength cannot get the job done that's right it just came a man or woman's strength cannot get the job done even a man's best is Vanity and so we got to recognize that we can't do it alone it's impossible so it says finally my brethren look what it says be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might so it takes your strength out the equation it takes your intellects out the equation and you're now focusing on God finally my brother and be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might verse 11 says put on half or it says whole put on the whole armor of God so you can't just pick oh I just want the The Shield so I can just block the fiery darts but you need every piece put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the walls of the devil so if you want to stand against the walls of the devil you got to put the whole armor of God on that's the only way and then verse 12 which you really got to recognize is that this is not a we're not wrestling against flesh and blood but against principalities I'm not fighting against you you're not fighting against the government but flesh and blood but against principalities you got to recognize this is a spiritual warfare and you can't fight a spiritual warfare with carnality you got to fight spirit with spirit it's the only way that's why you can see why Paul said be strong in the Lord and the power of His might before we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places verse 13. wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God so this seems like it's very important because Paul is mentioning once again the whole armor of God for a reason that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day in having done all to stand how many believe we're living in an evil day just want to be able to stand you got to put the full armor of God on that's what it's telling us right here says stand there for having your loins Girt with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace and look what 16 says above all taking the shield of faith if you don't have faith in this armor then how is the armor ever going to work it's like when Jesus he couldn't do many Works in a certain city because of the unbelief and he was still the same God but God can't God doesn't move unless you let him move that's right and the same thing is you got to believe that this armor is just what you need it's going to fortify you the way it needs to fortify you so above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked all those thoughts he's going to try and plant you just take that Shield and just let them bounce right off and take the helmet of salvation I love that and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God look at verse 18. this is so key right here if if you don't have this then you can't have the armor praying always with all prayer and supplication does it say in the flesh no no in the spirit and it says watching watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints so I love how in Schofield it says the Warriors resource so the prayer is the Warriors resource if the if the warrior the prayer that the warrior wants to keep his armor on he has to be a prayer Warrior you have to be because you live in such an age where we have so many voices trying to talk to us trying to get us to go over here and go over there and we got to silence all those voices and get alone in our prayer closet and hear the one great voice that's going to change us from the inside out it's going to give us the leadership that we need that's going to give us the help that we need because he's a help we said before in a present time amen let's go to Romans 6. so in order to keep our eyes on Christ we have to recognize the Enemy Within right amen because the only person that's going to keep you from growing in Christ is yourself that's right you're your biggest enemy as they say and how many decisions have we wrong decisions have we made because we didn't take it to prayer and who who to blame but ourselves because we didn't take the time to pray about or take the time to really analyze the situation and so and we could say Satan is our enemy as well but Satan can only use a yielded vessel as our brother John said the other day so only way Satan can cause us harm if we yield our carnal flesh to him that's right that's the only way because Satan can't force itself upon you unless you give him something to come into just like the Beast he yielded himself to be used by Satan as good as um Romans 6 and we'll start with verse six knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we should also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him friend that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God verse 11. likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus our lord let no sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye shall obey it in the lust thereof noises has given us a something to really think about let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body and all sin is what is unbelief see we could say sin is all these other things drinking gambling and smoking but but what is sin is really is unbelief you not believe in taking God at his word that's what sin really is neither yield your members look who's saying right here neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members are as instruments of righteousness unto God so we have a choice every day who we yield ourselves to it's either going to be God there's going to be Satan you may say well I'm a Christian you know I've been born again but you can still yield your instrument to the wrong thing at the wrong way how many times have you been uh looking at something and a wrong thing comes out or pops up or something or whatever or you're in a situation and you you kind of go off the handle a little bit was that God going off the handle or is that Satan getting in there that's right that's right so it's all right that you can yield yourself at any moment any time to the wrong instrument says for sin shall not have dominion over you for you're not under the law but under grace What then shall we sin because we're not under the law but under grace God forbid see Paul's not doing away with the law the law is still in in still intact today know ye not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey his servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but God we think that you were Servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that from the doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin you become the Servants of righteousness I speak the manner of men because of infirmity of your flesh for as if you yielded your member servants to uncleanliness into iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to unrighteousness unto holiness for when you are the Servants of sin you are free from righteousness wow that's deep what fruit had even in those things where of you are now ashamed for the end of those things as death but now being made free from sin and become servants to God you have your fruit unto Holiness in the end of everlasting life verse 23 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord so we just see this we got to recognize this constant battle that's going within us and we're going to read that in Romans 7 here in a second we got to recognize that your spiritual man wants to do the things of God while your car your carnal man wants to do the things not of God and it's a constant War inside of us going to tug of war constantly just hitting at us and we see Paul is picking up where Paul is telling you about this inward battle says The Strife of the two Natures under the law for that which I do verse 15 chapter 7 verse 15. for that which I do I allow not for what I would that do I not but what I hate that I do that that inward battle you want to do good but evil is trying to get you to constantly do this over here and you have to crucify that because if you don't crucify that then you're gonna go into default every time it's so easy to go into default because that's how the nature was you may say well Mark I'm born again but you're still in these fleshly bodies because Jesus didn't come to redeem these bodies but he came to redeem what's inside of here so we're still in a battle until he comes so if then I do that which I would not I consent to the law that is good now then there's no more I that do it but sin that door Within Me so verse 18. if I know that in me that's in my flesh dwarf no good thing so you have to recognize that your carnality your flesh there's nothing good in it and so you can't depend upon it to to help you to to help you get uh closer to prayer because it doesn't want to pray it hates to pray and if it does pray it wants to pray the bare minimum and wants to pray repetitiously for another enemy that's in my flesh worth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not so you can't find to perform good inside your flesh yeah you could be a good person you know I can I can show you a lot of good people but God isn't just calling us to be good that's not enough because if that rich rung ruler then he was good enough but Jesus said you lack one thing and he was a man that followed the Commandments he's a man that probably gave to the poor but all that stuff doesn't matter if you don't know him personally for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not there's no more I that do it but send that to offend me I find in a law that when I would do good evil was present with me so every time we try to get closer to Christ the enemy is trying to get us out the way trying to get us this a little bit off because he knows the closer we get to God he's going to be defeated every time that's why it's so important that he said 22 for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man you have to Delight for God after anywhere man you can't just be doing just alms and just doing it because you have to do it there's no life in that you'll be miserable you got to do it because you you want to know the author of this word but I see another law on my members warning against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members you got we got I love this honesty what Paul says oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so with the mind I myself sort of the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin so when our Lord and savior died for us he gave us a way that we could fight but we got to yield ourselves to him because if we don't yield ourselves to him then we're never going to win the battle because the battle is the lord it's not yours you got to submit yourself to the Lord so he can give you the victory and it's not it's not a heart we make it so hard sometimes because we always want to be in control of the situation we don't want to let go so you got to let go and let God be God if not he can't you see we try to be God on a situation and every time it backfires in our face so just let go and let God be God who he is he knows what he's doing he eats out plans to prosper you and to give you an expected end but it also says seek seek him with all your heart that's just the key to seek him with everything that you have so like I said before work as we're constantly stepping towards Christ Our flesh is going to try to combat against what the our spirit man wants see the flesh always wants to be lazy it wants to be complacent it loves pleasure the fled the flesh loves to be entertained it loves to feel good things and and no the flesh knows it was doesn't it's not going to feel good if you're serving God with all your heart it's gonna It's Gonna Hate it's gonna rile up as much as it can it's gonna try to come up that's why you can see Paul said I crucify myself daily and so we'll go to Romans 8. and just really get a little deeper into that that spiritual warfare again look at verse 8 says verse one says in verse 8. there is therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but what but after the spirit so you got to be walking after the spirit if there's going to be no condemnation verse 5 for they thereafter the flesh do mind the things of the flesh so that that black dog white dog there's a black dog inside even a white dog inside of you and whatever dog that you feed the most the white the white dogs are spiritual man and the black dogs are carnal man so whatever dog you feed the most is what's going to come out on top so if you decide to feed the black dog then guess what don't expect anything from God then because God can't work if you're feeding on the things that are not of him God can only work if you're feeding upon him as simple as that like a car if you don't feed your car with gas guess what it's not going to go simple as that if you don't pay your bills your electric bill guess what you're gonna not have electricity if you don't fill your refrigerator guess what you're gonna starve simple as that verse 6. for to be currently minded is death so scripture is telling us if we're constantly in carnality constantly disbelieving God's word then guess what's going to happen death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace how many want peace and life in their life then feed upon the things of God Amen Amen Let God just be who he is like we said before God is going to be God if we let him be God who's in control of the drivers who are you or God amen because the colonel mind is enmity against God for it's neither subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God so you can't even please God In the Flesh but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be it the spirit of God dwelleth in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness amen let's go to verse um 12. therefore brethren we are we are debtors notice that not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh ye shall die but if through the spirit do mortified the Deeds of the body ye shall live so as a constant a daily crucifixion that we must obtain because God is calling us to so much higher than what we think he's really calling us to true and we gotta make sure that we're constantly just mortifying the Deeds of the body because if not we can't live amen amen so we just see Paul just expounding the dangers of feeding the black dog and it's a choice that we have to make every day who are you going to feed today are you going to feed the spiritual man or you're going to feed the black dog and you make that decision the first thing you get up in the morning the decision is probably going to be made right then and there if you decide not to spend your time in prayer first thing in the morning there's a chance that your day is going to be the black dog's day is this the truth amen so it's nothing in the world but just having a gift to know how to relax myself get William Branham off to the side that's the biggest enemy I got is William Branham he's always in my way he's always in God's way I will say he's always gets in God's way he's too tired he don't want to do this he don't want to do that if I can just crucify that guy God can use it so if we can just deny ourself then God can use us God can answer those prayers we want to be answered God can do wonderful how many how many wants God do wonderful things in their life and keep crucifying keep praying keep seeking if it doesn't come right away Daniel played for 21 days straight right and God said I heard every prayer every prayer so we've got to have faith that God is hearing our prayers God knows your needs God knows you're struggling God knows you're in pain he knows you're weak he knows all these things but just believe that he hears every prayer he even hears the tears that don't make a sound when they fall on the ground sometimes we have this crowd to God Amen when I have words to say but this crowd to God say Lord the scripture even tells me I don't know how to pray but you said the spirit will give me utterance to say right and so we got sometimes sometimes I hit my knees and I don't know what to say sometimes I'm just like Lord I don't know what to say but it's okay he knows what you have needed before you even needed it and so let's go to verse 18. I love Verse 18 right here what it says for our reckon that the suffering of this present time we're not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us hallelujah I love that so the trials you're going through the trials you will go through they are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us because those trials are leading you one step closer to that Glory it's going to be revealed in you that one step closer for the rapture so you got to believe the hardships you're going through they aren't by coincidence they're not but you gotta believe that Christ is with you through the darkest times even though it feels like he's not there I I job probably felt the same way but he knew that history he knew that that God was there because he didn't curse God not one time he didn't he knew God was faithful and he knew this trial that he had it probably felt like an eternity but he kept his eyes focused no matter what his friend said no matter what his wife said just imagine that his wife said Curse God and die his friend said Joe beer a secret sinner all these accusations that he had but he still kept the faith amen the faith amen amen praise God I used to preach over in the Baptist Church a little sermon I called it let let loose and let God that's right just let loose and let God as long as you got yourself into it there ain't no way you know the biggest enemy I got is William Branham he's always in God's way if I can just get him out the way then God can go to work that's your worst enemy is yourself just get yourself out the way then let God and go to work so we want to see things that's happening in our lives things that happen in our church then we gotta let's get out the way we want to live see we want to live a Victorious life but we're not willing to do what it takes to live a Victorious Life hey man let's go to Hebrews 3 14. amen and a man never knows what it is to live a Victorious life until he's completely overcome who himself I love that that's the biggest enemy you got that's the reason you can't rise up in faith because you got intellectuals there your intellectual part says well this or that it's a reasoning we got a cast down reasoning the Bible tells us so Hebrews 3 14. so if I'm running a race a relay race and I I'm running as hard as I can at the beginning and I'm I'm just like I'm beating everybody but then I start to slow down towards the end of the race and I lose did any of that matter of me running all I could at the beginning it doesn't because I didn't finish and so the same thing the writer in Hebrews is telling us Paul is saying in 314. for we are made partakers of Christ if if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast until the end so we got to hold that that same you know when you first give your heart to the Lord how happy you were how man you just Lord I want to do anything you tell me to do I don't care what it takes and then sometimes as we get a little seasoned Christians we kind of get a little lazy or I can you know I can kind of do this and not do that but the scripture says hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the End Amen so if you want to make a Rapture if you want to live Victorious life if you want healing if you want keep doing ex we can keep on Kick The List you got to hold your confidence steadfast Until the End keep that Faith you gotta earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and it's still being delivered to the Saints but you gotta earnestly contend for it you gotta believe that it's for you and the word is calling us to be Overcomers amen it says in Revelations 3 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I alsoever came and sat down with my father in his throne so we're serving the lord and savior that knows how to overcome and it's not you necessarily doing the overcoming but it's you're letting the Overcomer give you the overcoming power you need to overcome the situation because you can't overcome any situation by yourself you got to let the Overcomer do what the Overcomer does simple as that and you may think well this situation is so hard it may be hard to the carnal mind but the spiritual man doesn't look at the situation he looks at what God's word says I don't think that God can I know he will that's how the spirit man looks you got to believe that that if God's if somebody else met the same condition in God's word then God is obligated to fulfill that same word in your life if you meet every condition he's obligated he has to because he can't lie so we just see that says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches amen so we see also in 21 6 amen and he said unto me it is done I am the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely so whoever is a thirst he's giving you an invitation to drink from that Fountain of Life freely but you have to accept that invitation you heard a statement of Partners on a pardon list received as a pardon so you have to accept that invitation that he's calling you to drink from the Water of Life freely look at verse 7 says he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son she got to believe that God is calling you to be an overcomer he called David to be an overcomer one day against the lion the bear and Goliath and so there may be Goliath in our lives right now but you gotta believe that you can overcome this Goliath in your life you got to take the slingshot of faith and hit him right in the eye and you got to overcome any and everything in your life God has called you to overcome it even the children of Israel they thought they couldn't overcome but there was two Believers that knew they could overcome how many is Joshua and Caleb's here today amen amen well if you're Joshua and Caleb's and you're called to be Overcomers because they were called to be Overcomers in their age and every age God has called Overcomers and it's no different in this age that I believe all of us can be Overcomers no matter the situation in our lives you got to just trust in this word it's the blueprint it's your ticket out of here it's your ticket for every situation in your life you gotta hold to the word cleave to it love the word eat the word amen amen and so another thing the word is called us to be is fruitful how many believe that God expects fruit to be bore out of our Lives see we're not here just by coincidence just to be good Christians but we're here to manifest fruit and we see in John 15. how to manifest that fruit in order to manifest you got to be connected to something right and we got to be connected to the Vine so he says Jesus says right here I am the Vine good verse four abide in me and I in you so in order for him to abide and you gotta abide in him first as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more Kenny except you abide in me I am the Vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and and get and Men gather them and cast them into the fire they are burned so if you want fruit in your life you got to abide in Christ you have to you have to you have to if you want to change in your life you got to abide in Jesus Christ if you're in a situation resolved the right way you got to abide in Christ you know as I said the right way because you can try to resolve a situation but it's going to create more problems it's not resolving but if you want to revolve the situation the right way abide in Christ amen Amen in this race you're running against your carnal flesh right I'm running against Mark Cosby you're running against brother John Brother Joseph brother Jonathan sister Gabriel I want to say everybody's names but everybody will run against ourselves amen amen and the only thing that's going to stop you from winning this race is if you don't crucify yourself your flesh daily Your Lust in your desires because they will your lusting your desires will always always get you sidetracked from the perfect will of God because your lust and desires wants to take some of God's Will and put some of his will together and try to combine it and the Flesh in the word can't mix because they're they're night and day their enmity their enmity against each other let's go to Second Timothy 19 time just flies huh second Timothy I feel how brother John feels second Timothy two verse 19-21 we're almost done amen nevertheless the foundation of God stand at the shirt how many can say Amen to that amen having this sealed the Lord knoweth them that are his and that everyone that nameth of Christ apart from iniquity but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also wooden of Earth and some to it honor and some to dishonor If any man therefore Purge himself look notice that Purge himself so you got to do something it's not just you lay down and God just does it all but you got to do something you draw night of God what he'll draw an eye to you even even talks about in that scripture cleanse yourself Sinners purify your hands so it's given something that you need to do as well amen he shall if therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and met for the Masters use notice that for the Master's use God wants to use you yes but you have to purge yourself you have to be willing to let go of your plans your hopes your dreams and let God's plans be the plans for your life because now every single plan you make is going to be what God wants for your life I'm sorry to say but it's just like that and you gotta you gotta just be able to cope be able to just take that and say Lord I'm okay with that because I know the way you're gonna Lead Me is going to lead to life it's going to lead to fruit it's going to lead to overcoming 22. flee also youthful lust notice that follow but follow after righteousness Faith charity and peace with them that call on the Lord out of a Pure Heart not a a a a wicked heart not a I'm gonna halfway give my heart to you and halfway not but a pure heart so you got a call on the Lord with a pure heart you can't say Lord I'm gonna try to serve you and serve maim at the same time but you say Lord I need you please just come and take control of the situation because I've made such a mess out of it and Lord I'm tired I'm tired of doing things my way I'm gonna do it your way from now on amen amen a couple more quotes and I'll close and then a man that ever comes to God and really down in his heart finds a settled faith it'll stand good in the mouth of death amen or in the mouth of sickness or in the mouth of Sorrow it'll stand good for faith is a victory you have overcome by your faith amen amen to the church from place to place just near only you can't purpose anything of God's promise in your heart without finding the reality to it if your soul has been tormented by sins and doubts and ups and downs and frustrations there's something down in thee that's telling you there's somewhere you can overcome that I love that why do you float around from church to church to from place to place just kneel down till you strike heaven so if there's ups and downs in your life doubts kneel down and just meet with God you know that song just have a little talk with Jesus and everything is going to be all right it works trust me as I said last night go beyond the sound barriers then you'll have purpose in life you have a purpose in belonging to the church amen you have a purpose in being baptized you have a purpose in what God and what you're seeking for because we know that God is honest God is true and God cannot lie and if God placed that into Abraham's Heart by his voice his word then God has placed in before us in his Bible and by the witness of the Holy Ghost by returning of the Holy Spirit and signs and wonders that Jesus Christ still lives and he's the same yesterday today and forever then why would we seek any longer after those things that we desire so this in closing we got to keep our Focus our Focus has to be kept on Christ if it's not kept on Christ then you are living below what God is calling you to live below so we live a million miles below our privilege because we lose focus all the time we ought to constantly pinch our conscience and say focused on Christ amen because Christ is the goal of our life we're going to be just like him the Bible says in order to be like him you got to be focused on him Elijah was Elisha was always hard to say in those words Elisha was focused on Elijah he didn't take his eyes off him he followed him everywhere he went and we gotta be the same thing with Christ keep our eyes on wherever we go our eyes with them every we go connected because the more we're connected with him the more that we can live a Victorious Life faith is our Victory how many can say Amen to that we just rise and we'll invite sister Cheryl we're just saying um when she comes is turn Our Eyes Upon Jesus amen how many love him tonight amen how many want to keep their eyes on them no matter what amen thank you Jesus [Music] Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus and the things over will go strangely dead in the light of his glory and grace [Music] turn your Your Eyes Upon Jesus look full it is wonderful faith and the things [Music] she continues to play it soft list by our heads it's a word of Prayer oh Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this moment Lord I know I can say Lord many times I've taken my eyes off for you and I even realize it Lord father I pray you forgive us Lord for just taking our eyes off of you from time to time lord father we're making a declaration in our hearts Lord we're making a rededication Lord that we're going to keep our eyes upon you Lord no matter what arises in our life no matter what comes up Lord no matter how busy we are Lord we're

says we have Victory through you Lord and father as we keep our eyes on you Lord this help us Lord when we stumble Lord we need your strength to get up Lord we need your grace and your mercy to help us Lord please just come down and just give us that overcoming power give us that nature change that we so desire Lord help us Lord is to be unified with you as a body of Christ Lord help us Lord this is the sea with the eyes of Faith Lord increase our faith Lord because Lord we need more Faith Lord there be any unbelief Lord help our unbelief Lord and father we we thank you for this Precious Moment Lord this help us Lord Jesus you know the things that we have need of Lord and father we're just placing them into your hand Lord this knowing that you're going to give us the help that we needed a perfect season or we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray so we sing that song one more time we just invite our precious brother John [Music] turn your eyes Jesus look full in his wonderful faith and the things over will go strangely dead in the light of his glory and grace [Music] full face and the things of Earth will grow strangely [Music] amen thank God that he's given us something to look at amen how many received from the Lord tonight we heard from Jesus we heard directly from Jesus amen he used a vessel spoke right to us I believe we all have something we can take home to be Overcomers and that's what God has called us to be and uh we we can see in all these examples given in the Bible if we just keep our eyes on the Lord that we're going to make it and as soon as we take them off we'll begin to sink and that's the remedy right there and it's the the problems that come in our life are our distractions and that's the time we have to be strong say Lord I'm going to keep my eyes on you I don't understand I don't know why but I just couldn't keep focused on you I believe God will see us through by one ingredient faith Faith just trust him just believe he's going to see us through May you take this word and hold it tight and cherish it and it will come to your remembrance when you start going off God will bring this word to you and bring you right back on amen praise the Lord before we're dismissed let's sing um will give the glory to Jesus amen we'll give the glory to Jesus and [Music] [Music]
