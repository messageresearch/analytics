god will we retrieve on his behalf or intervene on his behalf amen hallelujah so let's just uh remember dan man it's been a while since we've seen him and uh you know there's a lot of times where we hide from god but he never forgets us so let's just pray that uh even though we haven't seen got dan here you know we should never forgive him and uh let's just keep remembering him and praying that god intervenes amen amen also our sister linda please pray for uh ethan my grandson he is not feeling well he is staying with me for a while pray for me to have wisdom to help him amen so let's just pray for our sister linda i'm sure god will lead her as she as he's done so many times down the right path amen tell him amen let's just remember also hope amen and all those that aren't here are for whatever reason uh you know it seems like uh the devil he just keeps wanting to shove his foot in the door you know it doesn't matter how many times he must have hard showed twos or hard towed shoes or something because uh you know you just got to keep slamming that door and sooner or later you know he'll it says resist the devil and he will flee but if you don't resist them you ain't going nowhere in fact you're just kind of encouraging them when you don't resist them amen so let's just pray for that amen let's just repay for this country and the state of affairs that's going on right now that regardless which way it goes it seems like there's turmoil around the corner and so it's a time to put all that aside just trust in god that his perfect will be accomplished and it will be it will be there's no there's really no doubt about it so let's just yield to him in all this amen for all our loved ones uh that get in they can get in under the covenant of the ark amen while there's still time um for all those that are affected by this kovid that uh you know it's a real thing um but yet it has its place that's it's a real thing right but resurrection is real resurrection is greater than death so let's put everything in its proper place oh that was fresh don't know where that came uh also our brother john uh bill sanchez in prayer he is not feeling well also brother alex mongolis who has that's where it always gives me pneumonia yes thank you uh brothers uh in north honduras that were affected by the floods amen all of god's missionaries for god's purpose to march

you know you can't have too many people over your house to celebrate thanksgiving or or this or that they want to start running your life and i'm not trying to use this as a political thing here but we have freedom in christ and um fear doesn't come from god so but we do need wisdom so we don't want to just throw wisdom aside and and move forward bullishly amen so let's just use the wisdom that god gives us amen hallelujah let's anybody have us a private request just let it be known to the lord this morning and let's just rise on one accord this morning and just go before him dear heavenly

may there not be any eyes on the veil but may lord the eyes be totally lord to set on you today father we commit the service now to your hands and ask your blessings in the name of jesus we pray amen amen god bless you let's i'll turn in the scriptures to saint john chapter 4 saint john chapter 4. this is a familiar scripture that brother branham often referred back to when talking about the the woman at the well and how the discernment came about and he would often use that right before he would have his prayer lines and this would uh help show the sign and and increase faith and we just want to pick up a thought from it starting here in verse number 20 uh 22 jesus is making mention to the the woman he says ye worship ye know not what so he just come out and just made it clear ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seek as such to worship him god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth and the woman said saith unto him i know the that the messiah cometh which is called christ when he has come he will tell us all things jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he amen god bless you may be seated i want to say it's a a great uh blessing to see travis brother travis with us today it's been a long time and i know in in great part it's been because our brother has been them on demand to work i don't know how many i don't know if it's been a month solid work on all many days you've worked non-stop but when you're working that much just to to get a breather you're trying to recover and we want to continue to pray for our brother that god would give him a good job a job that wouldn't be over taxing and a job that would be rewarding and we do have a promise in the scriptures that if we seek first the kingdom that all other things will be added and let's just pray that god bless us our brother and our brother's wife amen well i would appreciate your prayers for next sunday we want to speak on the subject of god's condition if it would be the will of the lord um but this morning we want to take a little uh thanksgiving message because we're cancelling wednesday service and then title this god is hunting god is hunting and for a subject worshiping god i i so much appreciate the rest of the church that's not here my my heart is is there with you praying for you thinking about you wishing that you would be able to be with us and pray that god would just meet you in your homes and one day be able to to join together amen i believe that everyone is a hunter you may not like going out into the woods with a gun and and looking uh for a a a deer or some game but we're all in pursuit of something you're hunting something for your lives maybe you're in pursuit of more love and more peace or or joy or happiness this holiday season maybe you're seeking a closer walk with god maybe some some health or or just a deliverance for your life maybe you would like to like a better life a little extra money maybe a more dependable car a job with benefits and advancements a nicer house or just a safer area to live but we're all hunting something people have been consumed by the fear of this culvert 19 virus and people are are looking for hope they're hunting hope i mean i've seen some some pla some homes literally have put out their christmas lights before october was over i mean just looking for something to cheer about and the christmas song come on and just help give you a little bit of cheer the world has been hunting or seeking a vaccine a horrible virus that has caused a lot of damage to the world it has taken lives it is crippled economies so many people are unemployed it's caused lockdowns even happening again if i heard correct leaving canada had just closed down which further causes other social problems in life and depression and and mental illnesses and social problems one of the greatest problems to escalate in 2020 is fear jesus warned us that in the last days men's hearts would be failing for fear it has been building and building like a snowball just getting worse and worse and worse they haven't been able to control the virus it is mutated almost a dozen times nations have looked to the world health organizations we have looked for the united states says has looked to the health leaders and our cdc for guidance but they keep changing things they've said some contradictory things about wear and mask they've changed their advice on whether they need to get a negative test before they go back to work before you had to have it now you don't they've changed the quarantine time between from 14 days to 10 days and now i heard it's seven days so many things are confusing the people and i suppose that the c d d c cdc is doing their best job to try to guide us and help us there's there's no question about it but you cannot put your trust in something that's ever evolving we need to look more to god i have more confidence in god speaking to his people than some something else now i know the world don't have anything else but we have something else we should look to the lord for guidance the bride does have the lord on her side i don't know what the world has but i know what the bride has we've been told that they have a couple vaccines out now claiming better than 90 percent success and they want the world to take it now i am not here speaking as an anointed person with health issues i want to make that clear but i am bringing a point about these things that i'm saying i read on the cdc website that while vaccine effectiveness i'm just quoting can vary recent studies show that flu vaccines reduce the risk of flu illnesses by between 40 and 60 percent among the overall population during the seasons when most circulating flu viruses are well matched to the flu vaccines and that's i mean with the best connections that you're gonna get it's only gonna be forty to sixty that means forty to sixty percent of the people who do take it it doesn't do anything for them i wonder i'm just wondering what to what per to what kind of people's immune system doesn't help do you understand because this this coven 19 attacks a people whose whose immune system is not good so if that's the case in 40 to 60 percent it it it doesn't do anything for i'm just saying we need to be looking more to the lord for our help i want to send that message to the church the world has been hunting answers for a new pandemic just like all of us have been seeking out answers for the things of our personal lives now why would they or us be seeking anything else in simplicity it's we're lacking it just trying to stay simple we're we're we're lacking and that's why we're seeking out our brother travis he's he's seeking out a better job he's needing it it's lacking in his home his home needs it it's no different with god while the world is desiring a vaccine and hunting to solve all its problems god is searching for true worshipers it's lacking if it wasn't lacking for him he wouldn't be searching it out our may our minds may not be subject with everything that's going on but god's mind is looking for true worshipers he is not distracted by this world situation i know two main things that god is after one he's seeking his lost children the sheep that have gone astray luke 15 7 says i say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over 99 just persons which have no repentance now there's been a lot of pandemics through the years but one thing they've come and gone but this scripture i believe there's been a lot of rejoicing in heaven through the years i don't think they're they're sitting in heaven i turned the heat up to 70 just so you know but we can turn it up more if somebody somebody wants it up more because okay i got to keep that one under the lid i have to sneak under there like camouflage [Laughter] um but they're not psycho they're not social distancing in heaven but they are rejoicing this morning over every sinner that repents that's one the other thing is god is seeking true worshipers not just worship now not just any kind of worship but a true worshiper the bible says the hour cometh he speak and then said the hour cometh i wonder if this is the hour that was supposed to come and he says and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god is in pursuit today he's searching for something he wants because he's he's missing it all things were created for his pleasure and it pleases god to receive true worship from true worshipers notice he just doesn't use the word worshipper and the old kind of worshiper it's a true worshiper now when it comes to praise and worship there's no switzerland there's no neutral thoughts excuse me thoughts about praise we are either believers who believe in worshiping and praising god who's worthy of it or we don't worship and praise the lord people are either seeking to praise god or they're seeking to be praised they're either looking to make sure that god is praised or they're taking it away from god there are only two spirits one is to worship god and the other is to want to receive it satan wanted to be like the most high in the aspects of being exalted so one spirit is to exalt god in his proper place and the other spirit is not to exalt him it's just the two spirits and our reason would be the same in this aspect as satan we want to do our own thing we want to do our own thing so we were created to worship the lord and to bring god glory so when we're not doing that what are we doing we're doing our own thing so that's why i wanted to say there's no switzerland in this the reason that some people feel so uncomfortable around true praise and worship is because they're not used to worshiping god themselves it's odd to them it's it's more of a foreign feeling to them i had one person tell me just the other day he says well i can't do that whole church thing but god is still searching for those that will worship him in spirit and in truth it's a choice i'm not going to downplay those that don't want to i just know what god's after before we get into what god is hunting for i would like to read some things to help us understand there's a big difference between praise and worship it's kind of going to be a little bit of a of a study and i believe it will help us to understand true worship that's the reason i want to get into this even though god desires praise the bible says let all that have breath praise ye the lord the lord is still seeking after a particular quality of worship i want to understand the difference between praise and worship can bring a new depth to the way we honor the lord throughout the bible the commands to praise the lord are too numerous to mention there's so many of them the angels and heavenly hosts are commanded to praise the lord all inhabitants of the earth are instructed to praise the lord and we can praise him with singing with shouting with dancing with musical instruments and there's scriptures for all these christian praise can be defined as an expression of gratitude and thanksgiving that's how praises it's expressed with a gratitude inside what god has perhaps done for us a thanksgiving first thessalonians chapter 5 verse 18 says in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you now you can just put your name in there it is the will of god concerning john martin or you can say that's not for me it's it's totally up to you in our test in our trials we can give thanks and count it all joy in our persecutions and afflictions we can rejoice and give god an expression of gratitude only as believers we can do this because we know we know that we love god we know that we're called according to his purpose we know everything is going to work out for our good we can give thanks but people go through things and they have a hard time being thankful and grateful and the the reason is is they don't really know who they are they've lost that vision of who they belong to who they're in love with and who holds them in the palm of their hand and that god doesn't let things happen to us because he's just too busy in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus constraining you praise is the joyful recounting of all god has done for us it is closely interweaned with thanksgiving as we offer back to god appreciation for his mighty works on our behalf praise is universal and can be applied to other relationships as well just got this off the internets really makes sense we can praise our family our friends our boss or the paper boy praise does not require anything of us it is merely the truthful acknowledgement of the righteous acts of another and since god has done so many wonderful deeds he is worthy to be praised psalms chapter 18 verse 1 a psalm of david the servant of the lord who spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day that the lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of saul and he said i will love thee oh lord my strength verse 2 the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower and i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so just remembering what god has done for us we can offer up a praise to him god has done so much for us saints it should be easy for us to praise him another thing about praise is that praise can actually be perfected if we're extremely young in the lord you don't have to be serving the lord very long matthew chapter 21 verse 12 let's look at these scriptures i just don't want us to get praised and worship mixed up because we can kind of blend them together matthew 21 verse 12 12 and jesus went to the temple of god and cast out all then that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and the seats of them that sold doves and he said unto them as written my house shall be called a house of prayer but you have made it something different you made it something different no we don't sell things in here but that doesn't mean we can do other things here it's still a house of prayer we need to keep it a house of prayer amen and the blind and the lame came into the temple and he healed them notice he didn't kick them out and when the chief priest and the scribe saw the wonderful things he did and the children crying in the temple and saying hosanna to the son of david they were sore displeased and he said unto him hearst thou what thee say and jesus saith unto them yea have you never read out of the mouth of babes and suckling thou has perfected praise because praise has so much to do with gratitude and and thankfulness and when you're focusing sincerely on your heart for what god has done for you it's quite easy to bring a perfect praise to god but true worship on the other hand takes so much more so much more from a believer that uh that a young believer doesn't even know how to worship worship is different than praise worship comes from a different place within our spirits worship should be reserved for god alone it's no longer about praising the boss on boss's day right or one another worship is reserved for god alone there came a time when lucifer wanted to be exalted and worshipped just like god was and when he finally got his opportunity we can go to luke chapter four he got jesus alone and got jesus was in a very weak time he had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights and satan was trying to get jesus to worship him and he responded in verse 8 here of luke chapter 4 get thee behind me satan for it is written thou shall worship the lord thy god and him only shall thou serve worship is an art of losing yourself in their adoration of god the only thing that's there is god praise can be a part of worship but worship goes way beyond praise praise is easy and worship is hard worship gets to the heart of who we really are to truly worship god we must let go of our self-worship we must be willing to humble ourselves before god surrender every part of our lives to his control and adore him adore him for who he is not just what he's done for us a man for who he is the person not the acts worship is a lifestyle not just an occasional activity we're going to church to worship the lord in the scripture praise is usually presented as a boisterous joyful uninhibited expression to god god invites praise of all kinds from his creation jesus said if the people don't praise them even the stones will cry out when the bible mentions worship however the tone changes we read verses like worship the lord in the beauty of holiness come let us worship and bow down see often worship is coupled with the act of bowing and kneeling which shows humility and contriteness it is through true worship that we invite the holy spirit to speak to us now this is important because when we're not really hearing from god the way we want to i mean it's just been a while and i really i just want to hear from god true worship opens the door for hearing from god through worship we realign our priorities with god it's through true worship we invite the holy spirit to speak to us to convict us to comfort us whatever we might need but we need to realign our priorities with god and acknowledge him once more in the rightful position that he belongs in praise can be perfected in a young believer who doesn't hardly know god but worship true worship the more that you know the more god expects your worship becomes higher more real just as praise interwines with gratitude and thankfulness worship intertwines with surrender a surrendered life when you worship god you give yourself to him you ever get just locked away michael w smith i'm coming back to the center the center of worship we're what's really important he says it's it's all about you it's all about you i mean i can put on a song and i feel so good one of my favorites it just gets me in the mood and gets me happy gets me tapping my feet and then i can put another song on and i'm just dripping with tears because it gets down there deep inside of my spirit and it makes me want to surrender my life to god i'm i'm so ashamed of my sins and how i failed him but when i'm hearing that happy praise song i ain't thinking about how bad i am he's thinking about how good he's been to me different praise and worship is different god is looking for true worshipers praise is perfected in babes but he's looking for something greater are you with me it is impossible to worship god and anything else at the same time the physical acts often associated with worship bowing kneeling lifting hands helps to create the necessary attitude of humility which is what is required for real worship it's an attitude i was gonna put this one in here because this is all these these thoughts that i'm reading had come off the internet and i just it was just too good not to use this is for brother ron though it was this is right after i was debating whether i was going to read it but it says wise worship leaders know how to structure a worship service to allow the participants to both praise and worship the lord often surfaces begin with the joyful praise songs and transition to a quieter more introspective opportunity for worship and i like the way that it says that is giving way for us to have an opportunity to enter into a deeper worship but i i don't know how many times i've felt what brother ron is is felt he's up here trying to get us to worship the lord to praise the lord and we're having a hard time entering in but you know what sister and i can really see in the scriptures real well while god is actually searching seeking for true worshipers because it's not easy people are so involved in the natural life that they're living in they come into this spiritual house of prayer and they're not they're not where they need to be you you can't come into god's house have the word pump you up and then you know no we're supposed to enter into his gates with thanksgiving and there is courts with praise amen lord help us worship is an attitude of the heart if a person is only going through the outward emotions without the attitude of surrendering all he is really not worshipping amen god sees our heart he desires and deserves sincere heartfelt worship god is a hunter and he's hunting this hour for true worshipers one of the definitions of hunt is one that searches after something he's seeking such to worship him that word seek means to search after to inquire and it also means to hunt and that's why that right there is why entitled this god is a hunter and god is hunting if someone is seeking after something that simply means they don't have it and and and god is is lacking true worshipers now you would think with all of heaven available and all those that are are worshiping in heaven that god would just simply be content with what he's got why is he searching for more because he created us for a purpose and until that purpose is fulfilled now he knows he's not going to get true worship from the devil and he's not going to get it from the world but he expects it from his children this is time for us to step up step up our worship amen don't just kind of blend it all together but learn how to worship the lord now a seeker is someone who always wants to know more and just think about god as i'm reading this to point where their minds become restless if you're seeking you're not just curious you are defined by your curiosity and god is defined by his restless desire for hearts that will surrender to him and worship him in spirit in truth that's what god is looking for remember if god is not lord of everything he's reading that lord at all so he is dealing with every one of our hearts in trying to get us to a place where he's lord of all of our lives because we all can stand and testify and say right here you know i gave this um this this liquor and this marijuana and and this to god so many years ago and i i've made him lord of that particular part of my life but god is not just interested in my drink liquor and drugs and in in my gambling he's interested in all aspects of my life and he's looking for a a complete true worshiper and that's why i say this this message is for us but it is just up to us to find out where we're missing in our worship this is not about offending somebody it's never it's never about that it's about god calling us to the place that he wants us to be when lucifer was a part of heaven he took advantage of god he clearly understands that he cannot create anything but he does have the ability he can't create life but he does have the ability to create an atmosphere and he did create one he created an atmosphere that actually took away worship from god because before lucifer there wasn't that there so he created an atmosphere that actually stole worship from god and took it upon himself because he did not have the ability to create something so it would worship him so he stole something that god created created an atmosphere to make them you know what i could simply do my own thing i don't have to worship god anymore and that was appealing obviously to a third of heaven and they may have not said oh lucifer oh lucifer maybe they did who knows they were just probably happy they could do their own thing he perverted the atmosphere that god had created and we all have the ability to create an atmosphere around us either that will bring god praise and glory or it will actually take praise away from god all things were created for god that those things would bring praise and worship and honor and glory to god but that doesn't mean the whole creation worships god he came to his own but his own received him not jesus said in john chapter 10 verse 8 all things that he said all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers wow now this is the identification that jesus has what does that mean people are still trying to take advantage of god if i was going to rob something or steal something from somebody one way that i could do it is i could say to brother mark brother mark can i borrow this pen and i know brother mark he would say you certainly can i think it's yours anyways no but he would say sure and i'd take this pin i'd say thank you and i'd give it back and i just simply would not give it back i wouldn't be fair about the exchange and jesus is looking at many people that come to him as thieves and robbers just like the angel stole from him he was the creator and they left their first estate but people are still trying to take advantage of god they're they're stealing praise away from god instead of humbling themselves and say let's praise god they don't do it they're taking advantage of god withholding true worship from god because that's what he deserves and when we don't truly worship him we're stealing from god there's people that are trying to steal eternal life from god without giving them their lives well brother john that's not how i see it anytime you're holding back your life from god but you're still expecting him to give you eternal life god is not looking at you like a fair trade i don't want to offend you and say you're a thief and a robber but we just need a more revelation more understanding of what the free gift really is the free gift is not you get eternal life and you go do what you want to do it's not a christmas gift i wish we had time to get into it he says you want to follow me you got to deny yourself you've got to give up your will it's an exchange he gave his life for you you give your life for him it is that simple that's truly the greatest revelation if we could get that we would learn how to surrender our lives we would learn how to worship and not be satisfied with just having a praise service we'd do a praise service walk out and do what we want to do but have a worship service and you walk out you want to do his will come on now god is hunting for those who will know him as lord a true worshiper who are walking in the light that god is showing them who are learning how to surrender more of their will who are laying down their lives honestly for the brethren the scriptures that we hear about all the time this is a true worshiper and if this is you you are who god is looking for a true worshiper knows that all things work together for the good he just knows he knows he can count all things joy when he falls into diverse temptation he knows how to rejoice in his trials he knows that they're more precious than gold he knows how to take pleasures in his infirmities and afflictions why because he has a revelation that everything that's happening to him is going to work out for the good he is a true worshiper worship is not just going to church and kind of blending everything together and having a good worship service a lot of those places have what they call praise and worship bands when it comes to true worship it ain't with you in a band it's between you and god and it makes you true worship when you enter into god's presence you just feel like who am i i'm a man of unclean lips you're willing to go where god surrenders you like isaiah that's what true worship is praise is is different i don't say it shallow or shallow but it is praise comes from the depths of the heart and he's not looking for true worship the scripture said he's looking for true worshipers he's looking for the quality of the person it's a lifestyle it's something in all that we say and do let it be pleasing to you lord the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him now that word worship if you look it up it means prostate oneself so you're presenting yourself in a very humble low reverent state god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth never forget that what god is hunting for he's not looking just for church attendance he's looking for two worshipers at church amen i just want to go through some wonderful scriptures as we close now in the book of psalms psalms 29 verse 2 give unto the lord the glory that's due unto his name and worship the lord in the beauty of holiness give to the lord give unto the lord the glory that's due to his name so i'm just going to say this right now if you don't give god what's due unto his name i would say that we're robbing him now i'm just going to take this pin that you let me have or let me borrow now right now i can say sitting in this church i do not owe anybody here a pen you are not due a pen from me but brother mark is do this pen because i borrowed it from him i didn't borrow it from you so i don't owe it to you god is due glory from you well i didn't borrow it you were created and he wants glory from you i don't care how you slice it you owe god glory now when you don't give him the glory if i didn't give him that pen back would not i be considered a robber and a thief in a very openly way you know what i'm saying or a sneaky way however you want to say that god deserves glory he deserves worship and it's due it's due unto his name and we're commanded to worship the lord in the beauty of holiness wow well when i look into his holiness i'm just a man of unclean lips i'm so far from where i need to be but it it points me to what i need to be that's why i need to worship him he is a holy god he's worthy of the of a proper worship and a proper praise psalms 95 verse 5 90 psalms chapter 95 verse number five we'll start out the sea is his and he made it and his hands formed the dry land oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the lord our maker for he is our god and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand now today if you will hear his voice and harden not your heart there is the choice we're either going to humble ourselves bow down our our pride and say lord i give you myself or we're going to keep our hearts hard and say well i've done my job i came to church this is all i should have to do psalms 99 verse 5 exalt ye the lord our god and worship at his footstool for he is holy and his footstool well brother john i worship god in in the car when the song's gone i feel real good i just shouted out and i sing and i just feel real good those are my times are you sure you're not praising him worship at his footstool that's kind of a humbling thought doesn't say you know stand on stage it doesn't say next to him at his foot still get low before the lord amen psalms 138 verse oh no let's go to psalms 132 verse 7. psalms 132 verse 7 we'll go to psalms 138 in a second we will go into his tabernacle and we will worship at his footstool you talk about purpose purpose in going into church is to get to a place in your worship that you're at his footstool you're not sitting there well i expect you know brother john better make me feel good you're here for the wrong reason this is not about brother john it it's about the message that god has to your heart psalms 138 verse 2 i will worship toward the holy temple so this is what you can can do when you're away from church i will worship toward thy holy temple and praise thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy truth for thou has magnified thy word above all thy name that is powerful they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth now if brother roger i'm calling on you next you just wait if brother roger has a a revelation a great revelation that i don't have god does not require me to worship him in that revelation because i don't have it but he does expect brother roger to you can only walk in the light as god has given it to you now you come to church and you're not involved the word just falls by the wayside or it's on a hard ground or mixed with thorns or something like that you know god will require that of you or yours you should be at church and you don't come god will require that of you but what's important here when you're thinking about the truth it's not why i'm in the message it's about are you walking in the things that god has shown you it's personal worship is between you and god it's important that you don't just you'll leave things on the shelf all the time it's important that you you you say you're yeah and your nay is nay this is what i believe this is where i stand this is what i'm going to do you you don't just play with god because god is god is looking for true worshipers the bible tells us that the earth is going to burn like an oven and god is going to make a new heaven and new earth i want to close with the scripture in isaiah chapter 66 verse 22 for as the new heavens and the new earth which i will make shall remain before me saith the lord shall shall your seed in your name remain and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord god desires worship he's going to desire when this whole thing's over he's going to want to be worshipped why would we not want to get involved today look the more we let the world bother us the less we feel like worshipping yet we may get sick of the world we may get an attitude towards the world but it doesn't mean we're more in love with god it's different spirits it would be better if we just had these these things on now i know we need to watch and pray but i don't want to watch that stuff how many times have you said or heard i don't want to watch the news or hear the news anymore we've all been there all been there all i wonder why because enough's enough we and we're rock solid believe that it's so confusing so discouraging but how many has ever said i am not going to worship the lord anymore see the devil is sucking us into the world and we got to take a stand we come together as brothers and sisters of like precious faith with a purpose to worship the lord to give him what he is due to his name and you can't expect the worship leader to do it for you you cannot expect the preacher to preach it just right for you get get critical with yourself come to church with a spirit of worship to worship true praise i can't wait till the doors are open to behold the beauty of the lord to inquire in his temple because i'm seeking to know god and god is seeking to the truth to know the true worshiper to have praise he can go out and get any you know me different praise and worship groups are out there you know what i'm saying it's all about entertainment and even if you dedicate yourself to i'm only we're only going to do this for the lord you can start out that way and be just as sincere and true but the devil will try to get into it and he'll try to bring some sort of entertainment so we've gotta we've gotta press in so you know maybe this message would be a a message of of we got to like take the the uh foot off the the the gas of just letting anything happen going in the old place and just coming into here with just some some some thought process of learning something but i'm coming here to meet the lord to worship him and not just be satisfied with just a happy praise but let god come into the heart deal with the heart and worship him from the depths because you're not a babe no more amen you're not a babe no more you're his bride the bride will be worshiping there are true worshipers amen amen let's stand together never forget what god is hunting for choose to be the one that he's seeking after make it easy for him to find you because you're always in the spirit always giving praise always worshiping him from the depths of your heart amen let's sing that little course when i look into his holiness i believe it'd be fitting this morning just try to enter into that spirit when i look into your whole leaning when i gaze into your lovely nail when all things that
