Without You we just we need and appreciate so much and our prayers that God will bless you spiritually with him for all that you do for his people amen um let's let's stand together for the reading of the word brother Gideon is ministering in Lighthouse at Lighthouse Tabernacle in Bennett city Nigeria this morning and wanted to pass his greetings on uh to each and every one of you I I believe he loves you and wish that he could be here and uh he covets our prayers and our support and all the work that he's doing there so let's remember him this morning uh turn with me if you would to the book of First Thessalonians uh chapter one and if I could I wanted to start reading at verse number one through verse number eight I was just going to read a few verses but I wanted to to read start from the beginning read a few more we want to talk about following the Living Word this morning before we begin reading let's about in a word of prayer father we we don't take this lightly Lord we don't feel that we're capable Lord of feeding the bride of Christ only you are the only you can do it Lord only you can reveal the precious word did Lord if we were going to have service without the Holy Ghost here we wouldn't be praying we'd just be doing it on our own but God we our whole dependency is upon you Lord would you bless uh our hearts prepare our hearts bless our ears to hear prepare these ears Lord bless our tongue or our mouth the words that we would speak bless our minds give us the mind of Christ may we be just completely prepared for your word today Lord as we look into it and I pray that this word would come forth Lord with Revelation Lord whether it would be quiet whether it be loud however it would be we just pray that it would it would not be without Revelation for we need you Lord to make this word alive inside of his quickness Lord by your spirit bless each and every one Lord you know are the very knees that we have Lord in our lives and father we pray for all those that are watching on the live stream Lord that you would be with them in a special way and give them also revelation of this precious word Lord for it is your word and it's forever settled in heaven we love you we thank you for these things now we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen starting with first Thessalonians chapter 1 verse number one Paul and Savannahs and tamalthius unto the Church of Thessalonians which is in God the father and in the Lord Jesus Christ Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ we give thanks to God always for you all making mention of you in in our prayers remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our father knowing brother and beloved your election of God for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sakes and you became followers of us and of the Lord having received the word in much Affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost so that you were examples to all that believed in Macedonian uh uh Akai for from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia in the K.I but also in every place your faith to God's word is spread abroad so that we need not to speak anything in other words their life did the job amen for they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how ye turned to God from Idols to serve the living and true God Amen God bless you may be seated thank you we got a text from a brother in in India somehow he got a hold of the live stream and he's been uh watching it for a couple months her brother a believer in India is in the message uh and let's just pray that God would bless him with Souls amen amen amen um how many times have you tried to speak to someone and share more truth with somebody only to have spoken back to you that thank you but we're following we're following the Lord we're good enough we're we're we're okay we don't need what you have to to give us and that could be as simple as just an invitation to come to church maybe they they know the truth maybe they don't but they they've made a decision that they they don't want to walk in it but but yet they're still Believers they've been going to church some maybe 20 something years and they they believe that they're uh following the Lord but I believe there's a lot of people out there who are are deceived by the enemy thinking that they're following God when they're really not Paul said in First Corinthians 11 verse 1 be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ so when you're following a man that's following Christ with the living word I say follow him but when you're following a man just with a dead letter do not follow him because they're not following Christ is alive Christ is is noted as the I am God not the I was amen we never want to follow someone who's just following a dead letter no matter how much they say they believe the word has to be alive in that person or do not have confidence and follow them what happened to the churches who just took a a part of truth but refused to walk forward in more truth brother Branham taught us that they died right there they built a denomination around a partial truth a man-made religion from truth they took a revelation given to a man and built their belief system around it notice they themselves didn't get the revelation it was somebody else's revelation [Music] because God's revelation is never going to tell you sit still right it's going to tell you it's perpetual it's going to tell you to keep moving this is part now there's more for you so that's why you never want to follow a man with a dead letter but just a part of the truth right there are a lot of Believers following a man in this message they haven't moved forward in the Living Word and there's a difference between people being in the message and the message really being inside of them I believe that this message is alive they're like the true message is alive the false message is a dead letter right right that is followed by more than what we realize you would think there's some sort of security because somebody feels comfortable when somebody says oh yes I'm in the message oh like there's some some fellowship that we could have they they believe like we believe but the fact of the matter is they don't many of them don't so you can't find security by just being in the message it could be a dead letter everybody views it different many Believers are rallying behind the truth of the message but what's important is to live that message out to have it living inside of it to be made flesh again and so many people have lost visions of it it's not it's not about knowing it it's about living it because that's what he's coming back for he's not coming back for the the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he's coming back for the Tree of Life amen so just because we're in the message it doesn't mean that we're automatically following the Living Word because I just want to focus on the word being alive let's take a look at the children of Israel The Living Word came down in the mouth of a prophet Moses and he led them out of the bondage that they were in and just look they left the World Behind they watched God divide the Red Sea and saw their enemy destroyed right God took care of them they ate the living manner the fresh man of the the it didn't last two days right The Living Word LED them by a cloud of in the day and and a pillar Fire by night they witness the rock of Christ that follow them they drank from that rock their shoes never retired I just bought another pair of shoes their shoes never retired they had endless health insurance their needs were met God was faithful to them but what happened The Living Word was leading them into all truth to the promised land but they made a choice that they didn't want to go so they were in the message partial but they weren't in all the way they built a denomination around what had happened and failed to continue to walk further on like a lot of people today they don't want to fall the harder way don't do anything you know because it was too hard to face their enemy and our enemy is our ugly nature that we wake up with every day that we don't want to deal with amen yet they still felt they were following God because of this or that the Pharisee said we have Abraham as our father Jesus said If Abraham was your father you would follow me The Living Word he said well we follow the law of Moses he says if you followed Moses will you follow me because Moses wrote Of Me they never recognized the Living Word and if you don't recognize the word living how are you going to follow it people have gotten so custom to just think well as long as I'm doing this I'm following God that that is not right I got a question for you has the word become alive in you [Music] have you recognized him leading you to himself minutes to himself are you truly following the Living Word brother sister I'm not interested in God making my life easier down here I'm interested in doing what he's interested in me doing that's what I'm interested in I'm interested in Souls I'm interested in getting his family together and and and God help me to help somebody get ready for his coming don't fail to follow the Living Word it will always lead you to himself the word that's important to us we're going to get into some personal stuff here in just a little bit but John I want to lay a foundation here John 16 13 you've heard me often quote this when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself it's not about you it's not about your flesh it's not about your life it's about God leading you to into all truth amen when I was born I was born into all sin and when I get born again I'm born into all truth and that Spirit does not stop leading us into all of it because I honestly I couldn't bear it if he just dumped it all on me the day I got baptized I'd say I'm out of here in fact I remember times in my life feeling too much pressure from someone telling me the word like I you know I don't know if I could take this this doesn't seem right I thought it was all supposed to be nice and easy for he shall not speak of himself that Spirit doesn't it's not about you it's about all truth amen that's where God is interested we want the Holy Ghost we want to feel good we want to speak in tongues we want to we want to dance we want to do this we want to sing We want to shout we want to do all this but he wants all truth to be inside of us all truth is all of Christ in you the hope of glory all truth is when all things are of God you've been reconciled unto him he's given you a Ministry of reconciliation the Bible says therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away and behold all things are become new who's interested in things in your life right now that you want to get rid of well that was awful quiet did I say that wrong who has things in your life that you're interested in getting rid of or do you want to keep the old things I mean we all got old things in our life that we want gone right we're just sick of them we're tired of them tired of dealing with them that that old nature that pops out that just you know get you're impatient you're you you just get rubbed the wrong way somebody looks at you just not right you just get bothered that ain't him that ain't Christ that's the old things should be a longing and a heart to get rid of that no our flesh is always interested in God leading Us in this life we want God to lead us in this life we want God to show us what to do in this life we want God to help us with this life we want God to meet our needs in this life we want God to make this life better this life easier we want God to show us how this life can be prosperous to us how things could be better for us in this life that's what we want to talk about the leadership of God that's what we want the Holy Ghost to show us and you know what that's just our flesh that's just our flash friends that is not what God promised he'd do when he sent the Holy Ghost that's what we want him to do and I'm not against that because we need God for all of our lives but I'm telling you if our focus is on that it is not focused the right way because when the Living Word comes he will speak seek ye first the kingdom of God is righteousness and all other things shall be added see that's not about this life but there's so much about oh you know God showed me this God show me that he wants me oh where is the hunger for God to show them how to denounce their own nature and have the nature of Christ where is that where is that hunger we come to church and we struggle with hearing the truth the children of Israel did the same thing for 40 years came to church heard Moses there was a promised land they wanted anything but to die out to get the Holy Ghost right they didn't want to face their real enemy and our real enemies ourself but the prophet said when the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all truth all truth is Christ inside of you I'm talking about your whole Nature has become him I believe the Bible says I will not awake I will not be satisfied to awaken his likeness we get too satisfied and we just want God for everything in this world what about focusing on your nature change why isn't that important we can't lose focus of that because that's where the Living Word is at well I want to see God live in me and lead me to this and lead me to that show me what what about his will you're speaking of your will and God is good God will bless you he'll give he'll give he'll give because that's who God is he's good amen and he just like he gave to the children of Israel he gave and gave and gave and gave and they said we don't want to follow the Living Word they thought they were right but if God tells you to go after God his nature and you sit there like a bump on the log thinking the only way you're going to get is if he hands it to you all right yeah you're doing the same thing that's why we talk so much about the children because the Bible said it was in there for our example that happened in the natural but the same thing is happening in the spiritual all truth when you read that scripture he shall lead and guide you all the truth it's talk of it's God wants to see his character in you a nature change in you not just the beginning if it was just the beginning the children of Israel would have been okay because they did the beginning they came out they all got baptized they all accepted the message of the hour they they kept it going down Through the Ages Moses he was our prophet but they didn't go into all truth too many of us we want to delude all Truth by just the part we want to deal with and usually it's that part that we want God to help us in this life like there's no conversations about how to really take care of this ugly nature that we got how to how to spend time with our brother and her sister praying in the prayer rooms about something that we want to get rid of in our life that's what's important that's the leadership of the Holy Ghost [Music] Jesus said in John 10 8 all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them so I want to say who are you listening to the question who are you listening to everybody wants to receive from God but God wants us to have his nature and it can't come in unless three more agency says I want you more than I want this the things of this world the children of Israel kept lusting for what their flesh wanted that's what the Bible tells us but they never longed for the Promised Land they were told this as we're gone they left Israel they said you know when they started out the journey oh yeah I want to get bad I'm gonna go I'm going to go on and get the Holy Ghost I'm gonna give my life to Christ but as they realized further in the journey that they had to give up their will they had to die out completely that wasn't very interesting to them they wanted to serve God in another way and they lost their hunger for the promised land and I want to say today how many people have lost their hunger for the Holy Ghost I'll just stay home I don't need to go to church they've lost their hunger but yet they think they're following the Lord they're deceived people are going to be deceived the children of Israel they had to they had to give up too much it they had to hurt too much they they had a fight for their nature change and they weren't willing to do it they were willing to go through the valley of the shadow of death and just trust God that everything's going to be okay when I die out to myself so they never long for the Promised Land worse yet they murmured and complained about the journey to get the Holy Ghost oh I have to go through this and I have to go through that and you know what it was easier for me when I just did what I wanted to do back in the world all that ever came before me were thieves robbers the whole world would go like this if God would just give him the Promised Land but God is asking us to denounce the devil to denounce this nature that wants to lust after everything but God to long for everything but God and we can't just say those words yeah I give my heart to God get baptized because how many people have gotten baptized in there are not nowhere is supposed to be in a fire for God Jude 1 5 says I will put there I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterwards destroyed them that believe not I want you to understand I wish these people were here today to testify to you these people that didn't make it because they would testify of all that God did for them and how God blessed them and it was them that murmured and complained because the way to God's promise was just too hard for them they had Moses they believed to a point they believed to a point and it's like with every believer if they're not sold out Lock Stock and Barrel they will get to a point where they don't want to die out to their flesh anymore they say I've got enough I'm going to find some some church that just believes the way I believe I'm being serious oh after all the leadership that God gave all the leading of their natural lives they didn't want to follow the Living Word that was leading them to a complete nature change they want to bypass that Hebrews chapter 3 verse 11. I'll tell you we used to have more people that come to our men's meetings just gets less and less interest less people come to prayer meetings people coming to prayer meetings less people want to enter in come on yet still serving God people staying at home people making excuses look Saints I don't I don't mean this in any wrong way but I don't care if your family don't want to go you better get into Christ with everything you've got because that's what this word this is why God Has Come is for you for you that hunger for you that first Hebrews 3 verse 11 so I swear in my wrath that they shall not enter in my rest take heed brother unless there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God they don't mind serving a dead letter God following the Bible well this is what the prophet said this is what I did but what about the Living God the one that gets up and speaks to you says this is the day I want you to die out to this this is the day I want you to reach out to somebody this is the day I want you to go help your brother your sister this is the day I want you go to church and spend some extra time praying where is that God where is that God today that's the god that we want to be an example to all but exhort one another daily while it's called day what I was called today lust any of you be hardened we should all better relate to this be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin you know I'll tell you what's so deceitful about Sin this is the to be the greatest deceit is that you can do it and everything's still going to be okay no matter what it is I mean certainly you get convicted more about certain things than other things but the real deceitfulness of sin is you can do it because we all sin and you know what we've all come short of the glory of God and the devil knows how to paint such a picture that you can just keep on doing what you're doing and you're still serving God and that is wrong the Holy Ghost is saying that is wrong if we don't stand up for this Tabernacle and say this is a tabernacle of God I will serve God for me in my house that will serve the Lord for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end now I'll tell you what the children of Israel went out of Egypt dancing shouting they had even the things even Egypt just said take this gold and all this stuff with you they just wanted their headache away from them it was just too much God they got on the other side and they you talk about a Christmas meeting oh they were shouting and singing and singing the song of Moses I think Brother Bruce would probably know but they were having a glorious type but you know they didn't maintain that confidence to the end if they could have just said that same thing when they were going towards the Promised Land still singing still shouting still praising God for deliverance but you know they did they had such an unthankfulness that God delivered them out of the world that they forgot to continue to thank God every day for so great a Salvation it became Unfaithful that's the spirit in this age people we become Unfaithful we're unwilling to hold our confidence steadfast to the end amen Lord help us to follow the Living Word God is not a dad but he's alive while it is said today if you will hear his voice hard not your hearts as in the provocation you know there's a very scary battle that goes on when we come to church and hear the word if we're not careful we can hear the word and our heart becomes hardened it's not the fault of the word there was no fault with Moses there was no fault with Aaron there was no fault with those 170 or whoever it was that helped Moses when things got tough the word was given but if we don't want to take the word that's when our hearts become hard it has nothing to do with the preaching of the word right The Living Word is is calling us to himself calling to have a relationship that's real not some dead denomination that's hidden inside of a message Church Hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it you know we may be satisfied with just an easy life down here but that ain't the promise that God gave us we may be satisfied with another house another car an early retirement we may be satisfied with a lot of stuff but we need to be interested in what God wants us to be interested in in what God is interested in and he's he wants to see his bride without spot without wrinkle he wants to see his bride getting ready what is she doing to get ready where is the testimonies of people who are saying I am getting ready amen this is what I put down and when I put it down it made me more ready I know I'm not completely ready but I'm moving towards that where are those testimonies now I'm speaking to the bride I can't be speaking to the foolish virgins I can't this message that can't be stunned by them this is for the bride we've got to realize who we are we got to stand up we got to tell the devil to get behind us we're not following some dead God we're following a living God For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit the foolish virgins not being mixed with faith what is faith it's the voice of God spoken to you as a living God it's a revelation that's concrete and alive uh honestly a fear coming into church and not hearing from God when God is there when God is speaking why would I come and just feel like I did my job to be there and not hear from him personally we must follow the Living Word how many times do you come to church and said you know I've heard this already come on come on I ordered this yeah why don't we just tell Paul and Jesus and everybody in the New Testament yeah we read the Old Testament why are you bringing it up in the new why are you telling me that I will I'll put you in remembrance of this why because the devil wants us to forget he just wants us to have church and play religion and oh yeah I'm in the message we're different we're the only church here in the area come on God has called us to be a Living Word a living example we can't do that if he's not pulsating living out of us let's look at Peter a moment when Jesus saw Peter and his brother Andrew fishing he said come follow me I'll make you Fishers of Men the very first words that we know that Jesus spoke to Peter we know straightway they left their Nets they followed they followed him I'll say there must have had been a spiritual connection there he never he never said uh you know come and I'll make your life easier I'll Prosper you I'll give you bigger boats and you know automatic fishing nets and all that he never said that he never promised them anything profitable for the Flesh in fact his promise include responsibility you want to fish you keep fishing but I'm going to make you Fishers of Men there must have been a spiritual connection they weren't worried about getting rich or an easier way Jesus taught them to be Fishers of Men he sent them out two by two he gave him power over the enemy but their Ministry really didn't start their calling the ministry that they were called to really didn't start for almost four years after God called them and even then Jesus warned them not to witness until they were filled with the Living Word it wasn't good enough just to be taught amen they had to have Christ living through them the dead letter isn't sufficient for us to witness it's not because that's all everybody else is witnessing with oh the Bible talks about prosely lighting and getting one from one Church to another church and what good is it if they don't meet Christ what good is it if their nature doesn't change it's got to change Peter like a lot of us who expressed their commitment to God said behold we are forsaken on to follow thee what else what shall we have therefore in other words what is left for us to do we've done everything we've we've left everything we've given up everything we are completely following you that's what Peter was saying a lot of us we testify like that oh yeah I'm serving God I give my heart to God but somebody try to hold you accountable to something and you get all offended Peter said though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will I never be offended oh he had a strong belief Jesus said verily I say unto thee that this night before the Crow thou shall deny me Thrice look at Peter's response back to the Living Word though I should die with thee yet will not yet will I not deny thee and he would he was the spokesman for everybody in the church there and he said likewise also said all the disciples yeah yeah we're with Peter well we know what happened Jesus knew what Peter and his elected disciples had done up to that point was not sufficient he wasn't like discouraging them where they were at but he was also letting them know that where you're at isn't enough amen if you stay there with that because look the devil's always trying to tell us you got enough you got enough and then if he can't get you with that and say well that's not true that's not the right Spirit you've got to press towards the mark and you start trying to press towards the mark then the Devil comes and he condemns you and he says God ain't going to hear your prayer there's no use for that you mouths are just lay back I mean this is a spiritual warfare when we're in it's a real battle we're in the greatest battle over fault yes we got to keep pressing we've got to continue to keep following the Living Word Matthew chapter 19 verse 28 Jesus said to Peter now Peter is a monks and when he said this verily I say unto you that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the Throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon the twelve Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel but notice the criteria here is to follow him into regeneration if we're not completely regenerated that word regeneration it means a spiritual rebirth completely spiritually rebirth now when it all came down to it at the end the children of Israel they went in and took the Promised Land before they did that those that were not elected but they were in the church wanted to stay outside and serve God out there they started the they started down the birth canal if I could say or any way that you want to visualize this thing they did not completely become born completely born again something stopped in the in the process and the church is full of those people just like it was then there was the majority of those people over 20 years old all but two were like that I'm not speaking of something that's odd it's just odd to the Natural Church world but it's scriptural it's right in the word our souls must be completely regenerated we have to keep following Christ and we be until we become just like him without spot without wrinkle or any such blemish now I know we can all look at one another's life you can look at mine I can look at yours and we can call out things I understand that I know that and I'm not talking about that I'm talking about where is your hunger today where is your thirst today what are you pressing towards today is this just church and then it's over then you're going on today or do you want this word to change your life because it all has to do with you if you're waiting for God to come down and shake your chair pick you up and make you feel good brother sister that's wrong I have sinned so much I am Unworthy of his presence I'm unworthy to be in this house I am unworthy for him to come down and change me that's why the Bible says if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves I will hear from heaven we got a job to do it's an individual affair but our nature must become completely his nature inside of us manifesting outside to where we become an example to everyone amen no nature isn't seen until it's in trouble anybody can be polite and open the door for somebody but if the last three people shut the door on your nose you're not going to be so eager to want to open that door so when I'm talking we come to church and we hear about nature change we're not hearing about how good we act in front of one another we're talking about what thoughts we think about one another when they're not around when the Devil comes and pollutes our mind with the wrong thoughts where are you going to take a stand now watch this we're focusing our attention and I see God for his leadership in our life Jesus draws your attention away to his purpose here in verse 29 and every one of them that are forsaken houses and Brethren sisters father or mother or wife children look lands we got to forsake a lot here our whole desire is God help me with this light give help me here show me this Lord lead me over here I need you for this and now we're seeing here the scripture saying we got to forsake that we gotta forsake it and yeah we're asking God for leadership in it uh no this servant can be twisted but the spirit is right the spirit is right God take these words and make them right in our hearts for my name's sake we've got to give it all for God's name's sake shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit eternal life you know that wasn't just at the beginning when you got baptized but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first I'll just say like this either way you're going to have life everybody that's born one time has life right you either have it here first or you give everything up and have it a thousand times better over on the other side choice is yours it's all of our choices individual Fair it's why it doesn't matter to me what anybody does that's why I'm free from all men and nobody can hold me back from giving my all to Christ no one no matter what comes against me no matter what is said about me no no matter how many doesn't matter doesn't matter The Living Word is leading us to store up Treasures on the other side that's what it's doing and we've got to follow the Living Word now here in John 21 if you want to turn there Jesus has his last conversation with Peter remember we started out there ever since they started but a little earlier in this message we started out talking about when Peter Peter was first called to follow him make Fishers a man we're trying to con get to the end The Living Word has a a very important message for Peter to remember when Jesus is gone and he told us this is Peter do you still love me more than your brothers and sisters father mother these other disciples he says yay Lord thou knowest I love thee and Jesus says feed my Lambs still talking about being a fisher of men because we do not lead call somebody we don't catch somebody to Christ without trying to feed them God wants us to keep feeding them keep nurturing them Peter do you remember your original calling come and follow me and I'll make you Fishers amen then keep feeding my Lambs John 21 18 verily verily I say unto thee when thou was young thou greatest thyself and walk us whether thou wouldest but when thou shall be old thou shall stretch forth thine hands and another shall girth thee and carry thee whether thou wouldest not this fake he signifying by what death he should be glory that he should glorify God and when he had spoken this he said unto him here Jesus is telling Peter about his death the end of his life and his last word was to him was follow me if we could focus on how important it is to follow God instead of just trying to use God for our life God doesn't work for every one of us I mean we have enough people here to shake up things we do if we could just stay focused on following the Living Word not using God for what we want but putting ourself in the hands of God and saying God use me verse 19 this spake he signified by what death he should glorify God Amen and when he had spoken this he said unto him follow me in other words Peter you keep following me to the end of your death don't just wander off yeah I'm following it's real Peter got off many times but I'll tell you when he got the Holy Ghost he was a lot more consistent he was a lot more consistent when he got the Holy Ghost not at that point in this very intimate conversation with Jesus at the end before Jesus is leaving think about you just only had a little bit longer with Jesus what would you say to him well this is what Peter said Peter started getting nosy with other men's business verse 20 then Peter turning around seeing the disciple whom Jesus loved following which also leaned upon the breast at supper and said Lord which is he that betrayeth thee we know that Peter was speaking to John Peter seeing John saith to Jesus Lord and what shall this man do come on he's one of us he's one of the disciples what's he gonna do and Jesus saith unto him if I will that he Terry till I come what is it to thee would you just focus on the what's been ministered to you today follow me follow me don't worry about this brother this sister don't worry what's going on over here what is it to thee and I want to just say it like this it is nobody's business what's happening in your life it's between you and God it's your relationship with God if God shows you anything about anybody he wants you to help them never talk about it never entertain thoughts of the devil don't wait till you get all mad and upset and want to tell somebody say I'm telling you this you know in confidence don't say it that's what the devil wants what is it to thee just follow me focus on what God wants you to do amen God has a work for you well I just want to know you know it doesn't matter if he puts John up here puts John down there it doesn't matter if I don't do my job what does it matter if everybody else what anybody else does I don't want to fail the Lord we don't want to fail the Lord and if we don't stay focused on that sometimes we come to church and because everybody else is down we're going to be down yeah because nobody else is in the room I'm only going to spend three minutes in there come on where's where's somebody who's going to be an example when nobody else is where is that person keep focusing on the Lord keep helping others get to heaven keep saving Souls keep feeding the Sheep keep feeding the bride verse 23 then went this saying abroad among the Brethren that the disciples should not die yet Jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if I will that ye Terry till I come what is it to thee it's amazing how we want to interpret the word we desperately need the Holy Ghost to tell us what the word is saying the main message I see here that Peter should be interested in that we should all be interested in is follow the lord Follow The Living Word if we're following the Living Word we're following Christ if we're following a dead letter we are not following Christ we're just we're just following a religion a religious covering too many people have forsaken The Living Word they've opted out to now walk in the light that's being presented to them at church or if they're listening to tapes or if they're praying and God speaks to them there are believers who are faithful to going to church but refuse to walk in the light we've got to keep walking in the light as he's in the light take time to pray take time to humbly ask God I don't really have ears enough to hear what you're speaking to me I honestly need your help that that being clothed with humility is what brings God personally to you what makes a personal connection with you the Bible says that God was not pleased with many of them that he saved out of the land of Egypt why was that because they only wanted to follow the lord until they were saved from their natural problems and how many people today only want to be saved from their natural problems there isn't much of an interest for giving their life to Christ let's pick it up here in numbers 32 verse 10. are you with me can I take a few more minutes and the Lord's anger was Kindred in Numbers chapter 32 verse 10. the same time and he swear saying surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt from 20 years old and upward shall see the land which I swear unto Abraham Isaac and Jacob because now here's here's some really important because they have not wholly followed me now every one of them I can say followed the Lord look they went for 40 years wandered around in the wilderness had all these experiences and here they were foreign but God said no they haven't it don't matter what our eyes see God's seeing the heart and in their heart they had forsaken giving God their whole heart the whole church world is full of people who just give part of themselves and that's why there's a falling away but if you sell out Lock Stock and Barrel I'm telling you you're secure you're secure because God will not let anything separate you from him but you got to sell out you can't go halfway and try to claim the promises it don't work because they have not wholly followed the Lord verse 12 save Caleb and the son of juniper and the kensanite and Joshua the son of none for they have holy follow the lord so here they were they were in the same church they followed the same prophet but God is making a separation between the two amen one was following one was not and what's important here he uses the word holy we all know what hole is we all know the difference between the the pumpkin pie that was still in the container at the end of the potluck yesterday and the other pie that was partially used right one was whole and the other was partial so if I say would you like to take a piece of pie home we would be taking it from the pie that had part of it but if I said would you like to take the whole pie home you take the whole pie and you know what it is you've been to certain stores or restaurants and they say I like to get to get a pie and they say would you like a whole pie or a piece oh this is this is this is no different than what God is doing he said I really don't want lukewarm I really don't want a partial believer all in or all out and if you don't make that decision he said I will make it I will spew you out of my mouth and that's what he did to those there was only two two that made the right choice the other ones were too afraid they were just holding on that God would still love him and find a way for them but he didn't and tell you this is for us spiritually trust spiritually we've got to follow the Living Word did you know when you follow the Living Word you come to church and you hear the word and it may seem very minute like nothing really to do with what you think is important but yet God spoke it to you and something happened in here yeah if you follow that you obey that it will literally liberate you more yeah it'll liberate your life and that's what the word does it it comes to liberate us into all truth John chapter eight I'm skipping a lot of stuff here eight verse 31 then Jesus said to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed so after this example about the children of Israel there was a group of people who did not continue to follow the lord and now he's given them the same message in the New Testament these are believers who already believed on Jesus they already believed he didn't deny it he said but you've got to continue you can't stay where you're at right and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free that word make means to liberate it will liberate you now we've all had of course when we came to Christ we had a lot of vices right we had a lot of habits we had a lot of things that we did wrong and you know God didn't take them all away at one second he's building the church he did how he want when he went for whatever reasons he did but when we continue to come to church and hear the word and get serious with God good things happen to a believer now there are there are many who come to church and don't do nothing with the word and their life seems to be dormant from real vibrant life from real joy and peace but God has come to set us free amen all right he gives us Grace when we receive that truth because right now when we're in the world how many times we've talked to people who want to be set free but don't know what to do can't do nothing I can't do it I don't know what to do I tried that it don't work how many times you had people tell you oh I tried that it didn't work I tried God I tried church I tried it didn't work well I do know this on the day when we all stand before the Lord Judgment Day there won't be one failure with God will have not failed one person but the devil convinces a lot of people oh I tried it didn't work which automatically tells us that they didn't do their part it isn't God is perfect how can he be wrong in any scenario even in his waiting for us to get to a place where he could do what he wants to do he's just perfect in his timing he's perfect in everything so he that the son is set free is free indeed so we just got to keep following the Living Word and we've got to recognize the Living Word before we can follow it look at the two disciples walking on the road to DeMent to Emmaus they didn't recognize the word how about Jesus when he was inside of uh a Marion and and was born and they did not recognize the living word among them in fact there was so much a reputation of being a bastard child and there was just a total negativity they weren't recognizing they weren't walking with the word they just wanted God for their natural lives how about who do men say that I am this that and the other everybody has their opinion about the word amen but there are very few that are catching the Living Word God help us let's stand together I don't mean to take so much your time I'm just going to have to I see some of you just struggling and I don't like to see that I know there's some that are enjoying it but some are struggling brother Brian says we've got to recognize the message amen the hour that we're living in the day that we're living in my sheep hear my voice and they follow me just to encourage you with this scripture here in first Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13 for this call is also thank we god without ceasing because when you receive the word of God which he heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe so let's become followers of a Living Word take the time to find out where Christ is alive inside of you what he wants you to be doing and I'll tell you let's just stay away from asking God anything for this Natural Life but I will say this if you want God to meet your natural needs seek the kingdom of God first that'll bring it like nothing else that'll bring it like nothing else even so there is a remedy to the situation it's just putting him first amen amen let's sing Lord I have started to walk in the light [Music] Lord I have started to walk in the light shines upon me from heaven so bright I've made the world and its Follies a dude I've started in Jesus and I'm going through I'm going through yes I'm

life today you know sometimes we're waiting waiting waiting for something when God is just waiting on us don't wait for something in the world to get all fixed better all straightened out just come and dedicate yourself to God give your heart to him free rededicate yourself to him look if the devil can pull us away that means we can come to God many many times but take advantage of of the opportunity that you have to seek the Lord just know that remember we never have a promise of tomorrow and um maybe you feel real good then ask God to help you put a burden on your heart for somebody
