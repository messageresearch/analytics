[33:08] how happy we are this morning to know
[33:10] what to believe amen amen
[33:14] well here we are last service
[33:17] it seems like things move so quickly
[33:19] don't they you just
[33:20] you come in and the meetings start and
[33:22] before you know it they're over
[33:24] we have certainly enjoyed being here
[33:25] this weekend and
[33:27] we took this service today just to focus
[33:29] on the dedication of the building and
[33:31] the
[33:32] dedicational service and so we trust it
[33:34] to be a blessing to you and
[33:36] i can just say amen and we could close
[33:38] because what the song leaders has
[33:39] expressed and what brother john has
[33:41] expressed is exactly what i'm going to
[33:43] express this morning
[33:45] the dedication of not just the building
[33:46] but the dedication of ourselves
[33:49] we're living in a time of such
[33:50] uncertainty friends
[33:52] you look at these young people here on
[33:53] the front row
[33:54] if time stands they are the church not
[33:56] only tomorrow but the church of today
[34:00] and we want to have a place that our our
[34:02] families can come to that they can get
[34:04] help and satan has all kinds of traps
[34:07] and all kinds of snares set for the
[34:08] people is that right
[34:10] there's the things on the internet and
[34:12] the social medias and the
[34:14] drugs and alcohol and just all kinds of
[34:17] traps and so we need a place that our
[34:19] young people can come to that they can
[34:21] learn
[34:22] and know
[34:23] the the the tactics of the enemy amen
[34:26] because we are in a battle whether you
[34:28] believe it or not we're in a battle amen
[34:30] and but we know who the victory is and
[34:32] so that's what we want to do today is
[34:34] not only just dedicate this building to
[34:36] the lord but to take a time to
[34:38] rededicate our lives
[34:40] and uh
[34:41] you know uh
[34:43] i was looking someone sent me a little
[34:45] video clip yesterday i was telling
[34:46] brother john about it and a precious
[34:48] friend of mine brother tim schultz and
[34:50] just last march i did brother tim's
[34:53] meetings down in noah missouri
[34:55] i was in
[34:57] claremore oklahoma and brother tim and
[34:59] his wife sister joanna came over for
[35:01] those services there in
[35:03] in oklahoma there in june and
[35:06] so sent me a little clip of the july
[35:09] meetings down in arkansas
[35:11] and brother cliff farmer then was
[35:13] singing i'll praise you in the storm
[35:15] and they just kind of panned across the
[35:17] audience and sitting on the platform was
[35:18] brother tim schultz
[35:21] and i was looking at that and it just it
[35:23] just moved my heart because you see
[35:25] brother tim got covered
[35:27] and they buried him last week
[35:31] and i thought how quickly
[35:33] things can change in our lives
[35:37] and i looked at him sitting there on
[35:39] that platform
[35:40] they were singing that song and he was
[35:42] worshiping the lord and i thought
[35:44] he didn't even know he had less than 90
[35:46] days on the earth
[35:49] how much time do you have
[35:53] i've lost
[35:54] so many friends this year and last year
[35:57] from covent
[35:59] if he's looking over 60 some ministers
[36:02] of this message that's died from covet
[36:06] how much time do you have
[36:09] and are you
[36:10] ready are you ready if it was to happen
[36:13] this evening they just read the
[36:15] announcement i got a i got a text this
[36:17] morning please pray for brother buckles
[36:19] in indiana
[36:20] desperate situation coven
[36:24] i think on the prayer request because
[36:26] someone if i understood it right
[36:27] drowning yesterday evening
[36:32] what if the sun don't come up for you
[36:33] tomorrow
[36:36] are you ready
[36:38] but we're here and you know every person
[36:40] in this building this morning
[36:42] every person here god knew you would be
[36:44] here before the foundation of the world
[36:47] you know god knew you'd be wearing that
[36:48] little thing around your neck before he
[36:50] ever formed the stars he knew you'd have
[36:52] that on your neck this morning that's
[36:54] the kind of god we serve him
[36:56] so you're not here just to fill up a
[36:58] seat
[36:59] so while we're here let's examine
[37:02] ourselves this morning
[37:03] and let's rededicate our lives to him
[37:06] that if the sun don't rise on me in the
[37:08] morning
[37:10] that there'll be a time i'll see you
[37:11] again
[37:12] that's when we all gather into daddy's
[37:14] house
[37:15] because truly we will gather there this
[37:17] message was sent to gather us into our
[37:20] father's house
[37:22] so if we see each other no more on this
[37:23] side
[37:24] let me make preparation and let you make
[37:26] preparation
[37:28] that we'll meet again at another
[37:30] dedicational service
[37:32] may the lord bless you if you have your
[37:33] bibles this morning turn with us to the
[37:35] book of hebrews
[37:39] i trust that was okay i just i didn't
[37:41] really plan to say all that it just came
[37:42] on my heart while we were standing here
[37:44] but
[37:45] with those thoughts in mind let us go to
[37:47] the word of god this morning and we want
[37:48] to thank our precious brother
[37:50] martin for allowing us to come and as we
[37:52] said last night and i didn't say it just
[37:54] to be said it but i really mean it that
[37:55] he could have got a great man to come
[37:57] and dedicate his service and he allowed
[37:59] me to come and so we're really thankful
[38:01] for that and we appreciate that and we
[38:03] pray that something will be said this
[38:04] morning that'll just make us sit and
[38:06] think you know
[38:07] sister told me last night she said i was
[38:09] just about ready to run the aisle i said
[38:11] you should have ran the aisle
[38:13] amen but you know whether you run the
[38:15] aisle or not but let's just take this
[38:17] time and just examine our lives this
[38:19] morning in the light of his word i want
[38:22] to read from hebrews chapter 11 verse 5
[38:25] and 6. do you love him this morning
[38:27] oh isn't it wonderful to be a christian
[38:31] amen
[38:37] you know why you're turning there
[38:39] when i was young we was raised poor
[38:43] i remember coming home from school and
[38:45] come home and they had repossessed my
[38:47] mama's living room furniture because we
[38:49] couldn't afford to pay but
[38:51] we had a hard time growing up
[38:54] so when i was young i joined the army so
[38:56] i could get the gi bill so i could go to
[38:58] college because my parents couldn't
[38:59] afford to send me to college so i joined
[39:01] when i was 16 went on active duty when i
[39:03] was 17
[39:05] year old
[39:06] and i joined the army because i i wanted
[39:09] to see the world
[39:12] i'm poor you know so i joined the army i
[39:14] went to oklahoma for my basic training
[39:17] and they sent me to north carolina and i
[39:18] live in tennessee north carolina's one
[39:20] state over i spent all four years of my
[39:24] military service in north carolina
[39:27] you can't make that up
[39:30] so i got out of the army and i was 21
[39:32] year old and i found the lord as i gave
[39:34] you my testimony last night in an old
[39:35] building down in jonesburg tennessee
[39:38] and since i joined god's army
[39:41] i've been in 32 countries
[39:44] i just found out i was in the wrong army
[39:48] amen
[39:49] hebrews chapter 11. now let's read verse
[39:51] 5 and 6
[39:52] may the lord bless you this morning oh
[39:54] it just feels so good in here
[39:56] the bible says this by faith enoch was
[39:59] translated
[40:00] raptured
[40:02] that he should not see death that sounds
[40:06] real good to me
[40:07] and was not found
[40:09] because god had translated him
[40:12] for before his translation he had this
[40:16] testimony that he
[40:18] pleased god
[40:20] but without faith it is impossible to
[40:22] please him for he that cometh to god
[40:26] must believe that he is
[40:28] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[40:31] diligently
[40:33] seek him
[40:34] amen let us bow our heads i want to
[40:36] speak to you for just a few minutes this
[40:38] morning on pleasing
[40:40] him
[40:42] pleasing
[40:43] him
[40:44] heavenly father
[40:46] thy word is true
[40:47] we commit ourself
[40:49] the pastor brother john
[40:51] this congregation into your hands for
[40:54] your glory in jesus name god bless you
[40:57] saints you may be seated this morning
[40:59] now this weekend has been set aside for
[41:01] dedicational service
[41:04] for a church that god has given you and
[41:06] what a lovely place that it is
[41:09] you know david in the bible he wanted to
[41:11] build god a house and he said it's not
[41:14] right that i should live in a cedar
[41:16] house and the one who gave it to me
[41:18] lives in a tent
[41:20] and nathan the prophet he told david do
[41:23] all that is in thine heart for god is
[41:25] with thee
[41:26] and i was thinking about that and i
[41:28] thought you know when god gives you a
[41:30] revelation then carry it out and may god
[41:33] help all of us to do that that when god
[41:36] places something in our heart and we
[41:38] feel that it's god leading us and moving
[41:40] us may god give us courage to carry that
[41:43] out
[41:44] you know it's hard when you've been in a
[41:46] building 20 some years to all of a
[41:48] sudden move from that building to a new
[41:50] building but if god is putting it on
[41:52] your heart to move to a new building
[41:53] with bigger room there's something that
[41:55] god wants to do then let's carry that
[41:57] out to the best of our ability and we
[42:00] feel that if god's leading us to do a
[42:02] certain thing then we want to give a
[42:04] hundred and ten percent of our effort to
[42:07] do the best job that we can do
[42:10] and god has moved this church in this
[42:11] direction he's gave you a place to
[42:13] worship then there's something that god
[42:15] wants to be and to do and we want to get
[42:18] behind that with everything that's
[42:20] within us you see it's not just up to
[42:22] brother john to make this church work
[42:25] it's up to every one of you
[42:29] not just the pastor not just the song
[42:31] leader it's not just a song leader's
[42:33] responsibility to create an atmosphere
[42:35] that god can come into but it's every
[42:38] person in this building's responsibility
[42:41] in a dedicational service you know it's
[42:43] a time to just pull aside
[42:45] and just to take inventory of what it is
[42:48] we're striving for what it is that we're
[42:51] wanting to achieve
[42:53] and the dedication of the new church we
[42:55] want to take a time to take breath and
[42:58] just to thank god for the church
[43:01] and for the word and for the blessings
[43:04] that god has given us
[43:06] and what a beautiful place it is and you
[43:08] know i enjoyed the old place it was
[43:10] always nice to go there but my we've got
[43:12] plenty of room to shout and run the
[43:14] aisles and
[43:16] you didn't hardly have room to breathe
[43:17] over there but
[43:19] so the lord certainly gave you some room
[43:21] to spread your wings a little bit
[43:24] so this morning we we we
[43:26] we want to come on this theme
[43:28] of what we can do to make our church and
[43:32] ourselves
[43:33] more dedicated
[43:35] you know you start off in this new
[43:36] church let it be a time of reconnecting
[43:38] let it be a time of recommitment let it
[43:40] be a time of renewal a time of fresh
[43:44] starts
[43:45] and i don't care how long you've served
[43:47] god there comes every time in our life
[43:50] that we need to hit the reset button
[43:52] amen because we're we go by human you
[43:55] know we get into a rut we do the same
[43:57] thing sometimes every day and we'll sit
[43:59] in the same seat every service but let's
[44:02] take this time to hit the reset button
[44:04] and make a re-commitment and just look
[44:06] at our lives and lord is there something
[44:07] i'm doing that's displeasing to you or
[44:09] have i've lost the vision of what it is
[44:12] that i want to achieve and so let's take
[44:14] this time to reset the button amen
[44:18] amen
[44:20] a time of fresh starts
[44:22] we know our church is only as dedicated
[44:25] as the people who go to it
[44:27] this church will only be as effective as
[44:30] the people that go to it you want an
[44:32] effective church then you've got to have
[44:34] an effective people to go to it you want
[44:37] to pray in church you've got to have a
[44:39] praying people that go to that church
[44:41] amen you know brother ben told the story
[44:43] of the master violinist and i know
[44:45] you've heard the story and they had an
[44:47] old violin that they wanted to auction
[44:49] off they wanted to sell it and nobody
[44:51] would buy it and they put it up on the
[44:53] auction block and he finally got down to
[44:55] that he said would someone just give me
[44:56] a dollar and someone said i just get it
[44:59] off the block nobody wants it
[45:01] and so he said
[45:03] and finally this old fellow grey-haired
[45:05] man stepped up out of the audience and
[45:07] he said just a moment
[45:10] and he reached over and he took the vial
[45:12] in
[45:12] he said let me have it
[45:14] he put some rosin on his bow and he
[45:17] struck it a few times
[45:19] and he began to play nearer my god to
[45:21] thee
[45:22] and as he began to play the violin tears
[45:25] began to roll off the faces of the
[45:27] people that was setting in the audience
[45:29] and the auctioneer catching that moment
[45:32] he began the auction again he said now
[45:34] who will make a bid on this and someone
[45:36] said a thousand and someone said two
[45:38] thousand someone said three thousand
[45:40] five thousand
[45:41] now how did that violated go from the
[45:44] audience who thought it was worthless
[45:46] just a piece of wood get it off the
[45:48] block to being worth something that was
[45:50] worth thousands of dollars
[45:53] what was the difference here it is the
[45:55] master
[45:57] the old greyhound fellow that come and
[45:59] picked up the violin he was the one who
[46:02] made it amen
[46:04] amen he was the one who built it and he
[46:06] knew what was in it amen he knew how to
[46:09] get out of it what was in it the violin
[46:11] was only the expression of the master
[46:14] who built it he had within himself all
[46:17] this music all these sounds that he
[46:19] wanted to express so he created himself
[46:22] an instrument
[46:24] amen that when he designed that violin
[46:27] he knew the sounds that he wanted it to
[46:29] make and when he picked up and struck
[46:31] the bow across the strings the violin
[46:34] became the very inspiration of the
[46:37] master you see the very heart the very
[46:40] passion of the violinist was expressed
[46:43] through the violin
[46:45] he built that violin to be an instrument
[46:48] that he could express himself
[46:51] through
[46:52] and when christ the bridegroom came on
[46:54] the scene he was the very heart of god
[46:58] expressed on the earth a body that god
[47:01] could express himself through
[47:04] then how did he bring christ here
[47:06] by the word of the prophets and then how
[47:10] will he bring his bride here by the word
[47:13] of the prophets so the bride's very
[47:16] actions and the very character of the
[47:18] bride of christ everything about this
[47:21] bride will be the result of the
[47:23] prophetic utterance because she is the
[47:25] spoken word bride
[47:28] christ was a spoken word groom
[47:31] and she is a spoken word bride you say
[47:33] why because the same word
[47:36] that speaks for the gloom speaks also
[47:38] for the bride
[47:40] now how did he identify well how did he
[47:42] identify christ the bridegroom when he
[47:44] came
[47:46] by a man with the spirit of elijah upon
[47:49] him who came out of the wilderness is
[47:50] that true john the baptist then how will
[47:53] he identify his bride he promised in
[47:55] malachi 4 the same thing
[47:58] amen before he destroyed the earth like
[48:01] it was in the days of solomon he would
[48:03] send
[48:04] elijah to restore the hearts of the
[48:07] children back to the faith of the father
[48:10] and as the bridegroom was built by the
[48:12] word to be a body to express god on the
[48:14] earth so will the bride of christ be a
[48:17] body that will be the expression of god
[48:20] on the earth a body has now prepared me
[48:23] then during these meetings if we could
[48:26] become the expression of what god thinks
[48:29] a church should be
[48:31] then these meetings will not be
[48:33] in vain
[48:35] we don't want a church to be just a
[48:36] gathering place
[48:38] but we want it to be the best it can be
[48:40] a man
[48:41] a place of water in a barren land a
[48:44] place of light in the midst of darkness
[48:46] a place of rest for the weary
[48:48] let's labor to have a church that god
[48:51] would be pleased to come to
[48:53] that his spirit would be welcome in
[48:55] where the sick can be healed the dead
[48:57] could be raised and the power of god can
[49:00] transform lives
[49:02] hallelujah where the holy ghost can have
[49:04] preeminence a church not led by man but
[49:08] a church that's led by god can we have a
[49:11] church like that i say yes we can
[49:15] amen
[49:16] satan hates the book of revelation you
[49:18] know why it exposes him
[49:21] he hates the book of revelation of jesus
[49:23] christ in the church he knows that jesus
[49:26] christ is the same yesterday today and
[49:28] forever and he changes not satan knows
[49:31] that more than 90 of the people on the
[49:33] earth today
[49:36] he knows that a whole lot more than 90
[49:38] of theologians amen he knows that since
[49:41] god is immutable in this nature he's
[49:43] just as immutable in his ways and satan
[49:45] knows assuredly the original church at
[49:48] pentecost with the power of god mark 16
[49:51] in action is the true church
[49:54] that jesus claims as his own
[49:57] all
[49:58] else is false
[50:01] now remember this
[50:03] christ in the true church
[50:05] is a continuation
[50:07] of the book of acts
[50:10] but the book of revelation shows how the
[50:12] antichrist spirit
[50:14] would come into the church and defile it
[50:17] making it lukewarm formal and perilous
[50:22] we do not want a church like that
[50:25] it exposes satan the book of revelation
[50:28] exposes satan revealing his works the
[50:31] attempted destruction of god's people
[50:33] and the discrediting of god's word
[50:37] he wants you to lose the importance of
[50:40] the preeminence of the word in this
[50:43] church
[50:44] right down to the time he's cast into
[50:46] the lake of fire he fights that he
[50:48] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[50:51] people get the true revelation of the
[50:54] true church and what she is and what she
[50:56] stands for and what she can do the
[50:59] greater works amen
[51:00] she will be an invincible army
[51:04] amen if they get the true revelation of
[51:06] the two spirits within the framework of
[51:09] the christian church and by god's spirit
[51:11] deserve to withstand the antichrist
[51:13] spirit satan will be powerless be for
[51:17] her
[51:18] we could have a church here in fitting
[51:20] michigan that satan is powerless before
[51:23] this church
[51:26] that's the church i want to go to
[51:29] amen i can go to i can join any lodge
[51:32] i'm not interested in being in a lodge i
[51:34] want to be in a church where god is
[51:36] moving amen
[51:38] satan will be deathly thought today as
[51:40] when christ withstood his every effort
[51:42] to gain power over him in the desert yes
[51:45] satan hates revelation but we love it
[51:48] with true revelation in our lives the
[51:51] gates of hell cannot prevail
[51:54] against us
[51:56] but we will prevail
[51:58] over them
[51:59] you see i don't want to church according
[52:01] to your opinion
[52:02] i'm not really interested in your
[52:03] opinion
[52:05] i'm sorry
[52:06] you said why did you say that because
[52:07] i'm not interested in my opinion
[52:11] amen
[52:12] amen but i want a church according to
[52:15] god's desire
[52:16] that's what we want here not what i
[52:18] think it ought to be not what you think
[52:20] it ought to be but what does god think
[52:22] it ought to be
[52:23] what's god's desire for the church to be
[52:26] you see it's so very important to
[52:27] understand what it is that god desires
[52:29] for his church because we want to please
[52:32] him
[52:35] amen
[52:36] we want to please him and we want god to
[52:39] be pleased
[52:42] oh my that's what he said about jesus
[52:46] you know what he's saying he's pleased
[52:47] to dwell in him this is my son whom i'm
[52:50] pleased to dwell in
[52:51] oh god let me be that way that god would
[52:54] say that about me that god would say
[52:56] that about you that's my daughter that's
[52:58] my son amen and i'm pleased to dwell in
[53:01] them
[53:02] we want god to be pleased with our
[53:03] worship we want god to be pleased with
[53:05] our conduct we want god to be pleased
[53:07] with our walk
[53:09] you say why is that so important that
[53:11] god's pleased brother darrell because
[53:13] according to our scripture enoch was
[53:15] raptured
[53:17] that he should not see death
[53:20] the order to get the more that means to
[53:22] me
[53:23] amen that he should not see death and
[53:26] was not found because god translated or
[53:29] god raptured him for before his rapture
[53:33] enoch had this testimony that he
[53:37] pleased god
[53:40] enoch raptured because he pleased god
[53:43] and the prophet of god told us that
[53:44] enoch was the anti-type of the type how
[53:47] very fortunate enoch was that he was
[53:50] typing you behold hallelujah because god
[53:53] showed in enoch's life what he wanted to
[53:55] do in your life
[53:58] hallelujah then if enoch please god and
[54:00] god raptured him then if you please god
[54:02] god will rapture you
[54:05] amen
[54:06] amen without faith it's impossible to
[54:09] please god and where does faith come
[54:11] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[54:13] the word of god
[54:15] amen without faith is impossible to
[54:17] please god for he that cometh that god
[54:18] must believe that he is and a rewarder
[54:20] of those that diligently seek him we
[54:23] please god by keeping his word
[54:27] amen
[54:28] jesus himself when he was here on the
[54:30] earth and he said he that sent me is
[54:32] with me the father hath not left me
[54:35] alone john 8 29 for i do always listen
[54:39] what jesus said i do always those things
[54:43] that please him
[54:45] jesus's walk upon the earth pleased
[54:49] god
[54:50] amen peter 1 17 for we receive from god
[54:54] the father honor and glory when there
[54:56] came such a voice to him from the
[54:57] excellent glory that this is my beloved
[55:00] son in whom i am well pleased
[55:04] jesus said as the father has sent me so
[55:07] send i you and the father that sent him
[55:09] with him and was in him and the jesus
[55:12] that sends you goes with you and is in
[55:15] you even to the end of the world so that
[55:18] we may do those things
[55:21] which please him
[55:23] so let's start this new church
[55:25] let us go forth with a desire to have a
[55:27] church that god would be pleased to come
[55:30] to
[55:31] that his spirit
[55:32] would be welcome
[55:34] in
[55:36] not what i desire for the church to be
[55:38] or what you desire for the church to be
[55:40] unless our desire matches god's desire
[55:44] so what does god desire for his church
[55:46] god promised it in the last days he'd
[55:48] sent elijah to restore our hearts back
[55:51] to the faith of the fathers and what
[55:53] kind of faith did they have they had a
[55:55] resurrection faith
[55:58] because they seen him alive they seen
[56:00] him dead and they saw him alive again
[56:04] then what kind of church would god
[56:05] desire he would want to restore church
[56:08] back to the original faith amen
[56:11] so that if peter or paul was the race
[56:12] from the dead this morning and come
[56:14] walking in this church and said on the
[56:16] back view that paul and peter could say
[56:18] amen to what i'm saying to you because
[56:21] the same word they preached we are
[56:23] preaching it today
[56:27] i wouldn't want to go to a church that
[56:28] peter and paul or one of his disciples
[56:30] was to walk was raised from the dead and
[56:32] walk in here and they'd say what in the
[56:33] world is he saying
[56:37] amen
[56:39] i remember when brother brown went
[56:40] beyond the curtain of time
[56:42] he said are all these brandons or all
[56:44] these you're converts and he said no
[56:46] they said
[56:47] no he said
[56:49] she said is all these brandons that said
[56:50] no these are your converts
[56:54] they said i want to see jesus and say
[56:55] well not yet there'll be a time before
[56:57] he comes yet but he'll come to you first
[56:59] and you'll be judged by the word that
[57:01] you preach and
[57:02] and if you're received then they'll be
[57:04] received also and i said to him i said
[57:06] will paul have to stand like this and he
[57:09] said yes
[57:10] paul stands too with his group that he
[57:12] preached to and i said i preached the
[57:14] same message paul preached and said the
[57:16] millions of people raised their hands
[57:18] and said we are resting on that amen
[57:25] hallelujah
[57:26] god's desire god wants a church you can
[57:29] lay his hands on i don't care how little
[57:31] it is well brother we don't have a large
[57:33] crowd it's not in the crowd i'd rather
[57:36] have two that was on fire for god than
[57:38] two 000 that slept every service
[57:41] because those two could do more in fit
[57:43] in michigan than 2 000 sleepers
[57:47] it's not how big we are what if we have
[57:49] a thousand god could come to no god will
[57:51] come to any sins sincere heart
[57:55] amen
[57:56] he said well two or three are gathered
[57:57] in my name i will be in their knits amen
[58:01] well what we need is a good clean washed
[58:03] church a real clean cut 100 out for god
[58:07] out with no shame no backwardness we
[58:09] don't care what the world says we've got
[58:11] god that's all we care about let him
[58:13] laugh at us let him make fun of us amen
[58:16] we'll be shouting the glory when we
[58:18] leave the earth
[58:20] amen
[58:21] what the world says i don't care what
[58:22] the world thinks about us
[58:24] we've got god
[58:26] that's all i care about he's in our
[58:28] hearts and we worship him in spirit
[58:31] and in truth
[58:33] that's what god wants in his church god
[58:35] wants a church that's born again filled
[58:37] with the holy ghost and power and signs
[58:39] and wonders following his church
[58:42] that's what god wants and if that's what
[58:44] god wants that's what i want and that's
[58:46] what you should want this morning
[58:49] amen i born again holy ghost filled
[58:52] church with signs and wonders following
[58:55] amen
[58:56] remember i said i think christ ought to
[58:58] know how to set up a church he was the
[59:00] god of heaven made flesh among us and
[59:02] when he was here on earth he said these
[59:04] signs shall follow them that believe and
[59:05] my name says cast out devils speak with
[59:08] new tongues take up serpents drink
[59:09] deadly things that shall not harm them
[59:11] if they lay their hands on the sick they
[59:13] shall recover heavens and earth will
[59:14] pass away but my word will never fail
[59:16] that's how he set it up and that's how
[59:18] it ought to be amen then we have no
[59:21] right to change the formula
[59:23] if it works for the first church it'll
[59:25] work for us
[59:28] people arise oh that's for another day
[59:30] but no matter what they say god's truth
[59:33] sells on and forever it'll be the same
[59:36] amen because nothing can stop the word
[59:38] amen it'll move because it's god's word
[59:41] the word will never diminish heavens and
[59:44] earth will pass away but my word shall
[59:46] never fail he said in isaiah 55 we
[59:49] started out these meetings with it that
[59:51] he said that my word will go out it will
[59:53] not return unto me void but it will
[59:55] accomplish that which i please amen
[59:59] so this church that god set up that's
[1:00:01] the church that pleases his heart amen
[1:00:04] god wants a clean heart and a clean
[1:00:06] hands he wants a cleaned up church
[1:00:09] that he can show himself in
[1:00:11] when god spreads forth his great wings
[1:00:14] and shows his power that he's the same
[1:00:16] yesterday today and forever the eagles
[1:00:18] can say yes lord that's what i want i'm
[1:00:21] fighting for it i'm coming for it sure
[1:00:24] he's the same yesterday today
[1:00:27] and forever
[1:00:28] that's what god wants god wants eaglets
[1:00:31] god wants messiahs he wants men and
[1:00:34] women who have signs and wonders
[1:00:36] anointed ones he wants a church that's
[1:00:37] filled with the holy ghost a church
[1:00:39] reflected him the same yesterday today
[1:00:41] and forever god didn't die he just bored
[1:00:44] himself a kingdom hallelujah he got some
[1:00:46] messiahs that he could get himself in
[1:00:49] and express himself through
[1:00:51] amen every word he says they say amen to
[1:00:54] it that's right amen they look like him
[1:00:57] they act like him they believe it
[1:01:00] amen they got the conductor moving right
[1:01:02] on out with signs and wonders following

[1:01:17] holds out the note they hold out the
[1:01:18] note that's the kind of church that we
[1:01:20] want let him that christ be the great
[1:01:22] conductor of the symphony that he has

[1:03:30] off with it
[1:03:31] the pentecostal speaking of tongues and
[1:03:33] they ran off with it but god wants to
[1:03:35] call us together in a unity of the power
[1:03:38] to bring back the fullness of the holy
[1:03:40] ghost into the church again with all
[1:03:42] spiritual gifts operating in every local

[1:04:26] constellations stand in the sky they
[1:04:29] never get out of orbit
[1:04:31] how the everything in heavens and the
[1:04:32] constellation if one of those stars

[1:04:39] light or a meteorite's what it is a star
[1:04:43] don't move if the star would move we
[1:04:45] would move with it
[1:04:47] everything in heaven is in so much
[1:04:50] harmony it holds one another together
[1:04:54] let me say friends let us be in such
[1:04:56] harmony with the sun the s-o-n let us be
[1:04:59] in such harmony that we hold one another

[1:05:15] commitment today amen that we're going
[1:05:17] to hold this church together by the
[1:05:19] unity of the holy spirit that we can all
[1:05:22] be in harmony with the word
[1:05:24] amen and there's only one way to do that
[1:05:27] there's only one way we could ever do
[1:05:28] that and that's let god be his own
[1:05:31] interpreter of his word if we'll just
[1:05:34] let god interpret his word the prophet
[1:05:36] god said how does god interpret his word
[1:05:38] by bringing it to pass
[1:05:42] oh my
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:46] it's like geronimo
[1:05:48] you know
[1:05:49] geronimo
[1:05:52] apache
[1:05:53] jericho
[1:05:56] he jumped turkey creek down san carlos i
[1:05:57] preached our many times among the
[1:05:59] apaches precious people been there where
[1:06:00] they helped geronimo prisoner
[1:06:04] 25 years they chased this man
[1:06:08] 25 years he eluded not only the mexicans
[1:06:11] but the united states calvary
[1:06:14] and when they finally surrendered they
[1:06:15] never captured geronimo
[1:06:18] he surrendered
[1:06:19] and when he did you know how many he had
[1:06:21] in his band that eluded the united
[1:06:23] states cavalry
[1:06:25] 37
[1:06:27] people
[1:06:28] and most of those were women and
[1:06:30] children he only had like eight warriors
[1:06:33] and yet he was able to elude them
[1:06:35] all those years
[1:06:37] so they use the white mountain apaches
[1:06:39] you go down to arizona they'll tell you
[1:06:41] that the white mountain apaches got the
[1:06:42] better land because they helped the
[1:06:44] government round up geronimo so they
[1:06:45] gave them the better land out there you
[1:06:47] got san carlos think much there friends
[1:06:52] so they brought geronimo in
[1:06:54] and the white mountain the patches read
[1:06:55] your history the white mountain apaches
[1:06:58] the scouts that they used to track
[1:07:00] because they said it takes apache to
[1:07:01] catch apache
[1:07:03] so they they recruited these white
[1:07:05] mountain apaches to track down geronimo
[1:07:08] so when they brought them in they lined
[1:07:09] these these scouts up sergeants and
[1:07:11] corporals and privates they lined them
[1:07:13] up
[1:07:14] and they placed them under arrest
[1:07:16] took the weapons away from them stripped
[1:07:18] them of the rank
[1:07:19] put them on the same train
[1:07:21] with geronimo
[1:07:25] where they shipped them fort pickens
[1:07:27] florida that are next to destin long way
[1:07:30] from arizona
[1:07:33] while they was on that train
[1:07:36] one of the white mountain apaches you
[1:07:37] know what he said to geronimo
[1:07:39] he said you was right not to trust the
[1:07:41] white eye
[1:07:42] everything he told us
[1:07:44] was a lie
[1:07:46] and one of jerome's warriors spoke up
[1:07:48] you know what he said he said i'll hate
[1:07:50] you
[1:07:51] as long as there's breath in my body
[1:07:54] i'll hate you so why didn't you leave us
[1:07:56] alone
[1:07:59] we were living the way this great spirit
[1:08:01] gave us to live
[1:08:03] this was our land
[1:08:06] why didn't you leave us alone
[1:08:08] why didn't you track us like dogs i'll
[1:08:10] hate you as long as i live i'll hate you
[1:08:15] and the cinderella spoke up and said
[1:08:17] do not hate him
[1:08:19] there's too few of us left
[1:08:22] to hate one another hallelujah
[1:08:25] and i say friends do not let them divide
[1:08:28] us
[1:08:30] you stay united on the word
[1:08:36] there are two few of us left
[1:08:38] to fight among ourselves
[1:08:45] let's hold
[1:08:47] one another
[1:08:48] together
[1:08:51] the prophet said god wants to fill every
[1:08:53] fiber of his church
[1:08:55] he wants your thinking he wants to fill
[1:08:57] your mind he wants to feel every bit of
[1:09:00] you just make you completely totally
[1:09:02] dead to yourself or to your thinking
[1:09:03] just so surrendered in god till his word
[1:09:06] just lives right through you you don't
[1:09:08] know nothing else but god's word just
[1:09:10] stay right with his word his word is
[1:09:14] life
[1:09:15] amen
[1:09:18] we see it that the spoken word we are
[1:09:20] god's word made manifest we are god's
[1:09:23] word made manifest that's how he wants
[1:09:26] his church is to manifest himself you
[1:09:29] see god wants us to be like that violin
[1:09:32] that violin could make its own music
[1:09:35] that my land didn't have its own
[1:09:36] thoughts it was completely surrendered
[1:09:38] to the master and all god wants he don't
[1:09:41] want my thinking he just wants my skin
[1:09:44] he don't need my ability he just needs
[1:09:47] my surrender if i can surrender to him
[1:09:50] he can take me into his hands and he can
[1:09:52] bring the tune out of my life
[1:09:58] hallelujah
[1:09:59] amen
[1:10:01] he wants a group of people in fit
[1:10:04] michigan that he can express himself
[1:10:07] through
[1:10:09] amen
[1:10:10] god wants to work in his church
[1:10:14] how sad it was that day they had the
[1:10:15] great feast and they invited jesus to
[1:10:18] come but where did they put him
[1:10:20] in the corner
[1:10:22] completely ignored him
[1:10:24] and we say come lord jesus come to our
[1:10:27] church
[1:10:28] and then we ignore him let's not do that
[1:10:31] let's not put him in the corner let's
[1:10:32] not put him back there where the
[1:10:33] bathrooms are out of order
[1:10:36] let's make him the center
[1:10:38] of the attraction
[1:10:40] let's lift him up in the midst of our
[1:10:42] congregation for he said if i be lifted
[1:10:45] up i will draw all men
[1:10:48] unto myself
[1:10:50] hallelujah
[1:10:52] hallelujah
[1:10:53] god wants to work in this church he said
[1:10:55] i'll be with you always even to the end
[1:10:56] of the world the works i do shall you do
[1:10:58] also saint john 12 14 the works i do
[1:11:01] shall you do also even more than this
[1:11:03] shall you do because i go to my father
[1:11:07] you got a beautiful building
[1:11:09] it's really
[1:11:10] nice he gave you all this
[1:11:14] we can come too
[1:11:16] amen
[1:11:18] and may everyone who comes here
[1:11:20] may they not just see the beauty of the
[1:11:22] building
[1:11:23] but may they see the beautiful
[1:11:24] characteristics of jesus christ
[1:11:27] in every person that comes here
[1:11:29] may it not just be the building that we
[1:11:31] consecrate this morning but let it be
[1:11:33] our lives that we consecrate that we
[1:11:35] consecrate a place to our lord
[1:11:38] a consecrated people and a consecrated
[1:11:41] building
[1:11:42] we see
[1:11:44] there's a beautiful structure and we
[1:11:46] appreciate god for it
[1:11:48] but really the true beauty of the church
[1:11:49] is not just the nice carpet and the nice
[1:11:52] seats and they are comfortable to set
[1:11:54] into
[1:11:55] but the beauty of the church
[1:11:57] is the character of the people
[1:12:00] and i trust that this place will always
[1:12:02] be
[1:12:03] a house
[1:12:05] of god's beauty
[1:12:08] when eliza went to find a bride for
[1:12:10] isaac
[1:12:10] he wasn't looking for a pretty face
[1:12:13] or a pretty set of eyes
[1:12:15] you know girls will see a handsome young
[1:12:17] man with a head full of hair and they
[1:12:18] said oh my just got to have him
[1:12:21] about three years later all that
[1:12:22] beautiful hair that they loved is in the
[1:12:23] sink
[1:12:26] and that 28 inch waist is 82.
[1:12:30] amen brother now
[1:12:33] you don't believe me ask my wife
[1:12:37] amen
[1:12:39] amen
[1:12:40] but don't let the beauty of the church
[1:12:41] just be let to be the character
[1:12:44] the character
[1:12:46] when the other went to find a bride for
[1:12:47] isaac he wasn't looking for a pretty
[1:12:49] face or a pretty set of eyes but the
[1:12:51] prophet said he was sweating it out he
[1:12:52] was looking for a character that would
[1:12:54] match the character of isaac and god has
[1:12:58] always counted character
[1:12:59] over
[1:13:00] members
[1:13:02] and elies are sweating it out until he
[1:13:03] felt that character who he could get he
[1:13:05] trusted god the character for what a
[1:13:07] character for isaac the bride which the
[1:13:09] church is a type of you know that but
[1:13:11] the real saints of god today they look
[1:13:13] for the character of the vindicated word
[1:13:17] that was the natural seed of abraham
[1:13:19] this is the royal seed of abraham here
[1:13:21] this morning if eliezer the messenger
[1:13:23] hunted the bride trying to find
[1:13:24] character that if that man has come a
[1:13:26] messenger to the last day if he has come
[1:13:29] trying to find a bride for christ he
[1:13:31] will not be looking for denominational
[1:13:33] membership but he will be looking for a
[1:13:36] character that's willing to serve
[1:13:38] and the beauty of this church will not
[1:13:40] just be the way it's decorated or the
[1:13:42] colors of the walls but the beauty of
[1:13:44] this church will be the character of the
[1:13:46] people
[1:13:47] who go here
[1:13:50] let it be set up with us
[1:13:52] that people would say you know
[1:13:54] you know what god told me one time
[1:13:57] he said the greatest compliment he ever
[1:13:58] got in his life
[1:14:00] he said he was at work one day and
[1:14:02] somebody he worked with come up to him
[1:14:03] and said you know
[1:14:05] he said we don't believe like each other
[1:14:08] he said but i want you to know every
[1:14:10] time i get around you
[1:14:12] i feel the presence of jesus christ
[1:14:15] and i thought oh god
[1:14:17] what a testimony that would be
[1:14:19] that if one said every time i get around

[1:15:10] and to my children
[1:15:12] i have not failed

[1:16:29] good job redecorating but let it be
[1:16:31] known that the beauty of the character
[1:16:33] of jesus christ
[1:16:36] you remember the slave owner
[1:16:38] and he had this slave that we know
[1:16:40] slavery is wrong it's wrong then it's
[1:16:42] wrong now
[1:16:43] god made man man made slaves it's wrong
[1:16:47] but in that day when they had this slave
[1:16:49] and everybody wanted to buy
[1:16:52] this what makes him so special
[1:16:55] did you feed him different nope feed him
[1:16:57] with the rest of them
[1:16:59] you give him better clothes nope he
[1:17:00] wears what the rest of them were
[1:17:04] you give me one of them celia
[1:17:06] masterpedic beds with the control nope
[1:17:09] sleeps out there on the straw tick like
[1:17:10] the rest of them
[1:17:12] what makes him so different
[1:17:17] what makes him so different he said i
[1:17:18] wonder that myself until i found out
[1:17:21] where he come from
[1:17:23] his father is the king of the tribe
[1:17:29] and though he's away from his homeland
[1:17:32] with no hope of ever going back he never
[1:17:35] forgot who he was
[1:17:38] that he conducted himself as royalty
[1:17:44] hallelujah
[1:17:45] he conducted himself under the aspect of
[1:17:48] his father amen
[1:17:51] you see it wasn't his robe that made him
[1:17:53] royalty if he had one they took it away
[1:17:55] from you it wasn't his ring you see that
[1:17:57] right there that makes me three my
[1:17:59] daddy's the king it wasn't his ring if
[1:18:01] he had a ring that took it away from him
[1:18:04] what made him royalty it wasn't his ring
[1:18:07] it wasn't what he wore what made him
[1:18:09] royalty it was his bloodline
[1:18:12] hallelujah and what makes us royalty
[1:18:15] today
[1:18:16] it's the bloodline of almighty god
[1:18:22] amen
[1:18:24] you see he was reflecting the character
[1:18:27] of his father's
[1:18:29] kingdom
[1:18:30] that when you seen him you saw his
[1:18:33] father and let us live such a life that
[1:18:36] when they see us they see our father
[1:18:42] he was a priest
[1:18:44] his father
[1:18:45] was the king
[1:18:47] and when god made flesh
[1:18:49] when god was made flesh became the
[1:18:50] messiah then if we could yield ourselves
[1:18:52] to be anointed like he was we become
[1:18:55] messiahs little lights that's what the
[1:18:59] church is supposed to be
[1:19:01] is lights
[1:19:02] in the evening time there shall be light
[1:19:06] what is that light
[1:19:08] it is
[1:19:10] you
[1:19:12] right
[1:19:13] jesus said i'm the light of the world
[1:19:15] and then he said you are the light of
[1:19:17] the world
[1:19:18] in the evening time in a time of gross
[1:19:21] darkness there shall be light because my
[1:19:23] people will be manifested on the earth
[1:19:27] that's what the church is supposed to be
[1:19:30] lights little anointed ones
[1:19:33] that's
[1:19:34] god's
[1:19:35] church
[1:19:37] his standing light is the light of the
[1:19:39] messiah risen christ in his people the
[1:19:41] anointed ones carrying forth his light
[1:19:44] into all the church ages sometimes it
[1:19:46] goes completely out then it comes back
[1:19:48] again god's anointed one god's messiah
[1:19:52] church if messiah means anointed one and
[1:19:55] means king then if the church is
[1:19:56] anointed by the messiah spirit it
[1:19:59] becomes a lesser but still a messiah
[1:20:02] because it has his light
[1:20:05] reflecting his power reflecting his
[1:20:08] glory reflecting his dominion so it is
[1:20:11] messiah oh how it reflects his kingdom
[1:20:15] in his domain
[1:20:17] it shall be light about the evening time
[1:20:21] it's you
[1:20:22] it's me
[1:20:23] we are the evening time light
[1:20:26] and as we rededicate ourselves this
[1:20:28] morning let's go forth reflecting the
[1:20:31] kingdom of our father
[1:20:34] to be rededicated and recommitted you
[1:20:38] call this church send the light
[1:20:40] but i say don't just send it
[1:20:42] be it
[1:20:44] be the light that's sinned
[1:20:48] whatever you do in missions whatever you
[1:20:49] do over the world let it represent what
[1:20:51] you really are don't be a hypocrite and
[1:20:54] send that and be something else
[1:20:57] don't send the light and be something
[1:20:58] else
[1:20:59] but if you're going to send the light be
[1:21:01] the light
[1:21:02] amen little messiahs
[1:21:05] you see house men brother john was
[1:21:06] talking coming down the road in marriage
[1:21:08] and divorce burban said if you want to
[1:21:09] see what a man really is look at what
[1:21:12] that man marries
[1:21:16] then if christ is going to take a bride
[1:21:18] that'll represent what he is he would
[1:21:20] have to choose a character that reflects
[1:21:23] his own
[1:21:24] character
[1:21:25] she'll be born of his bone flesh of his
[1:21:27] flesh
[1:21:28] spirit of his spirit she is him
[1:21:31] expressed
[1:21:32] saints of god disboarded

[1:21:36] last night i tried to make it short this
[1:21:37] morning

[1:21:46] our life into his hands
[1:21:48] and let him rosin up the bow of the holy
[1:21:51] spirit and let him come across the
[1:21:53] strings of our life that our life would
[1:21:55] sing out
[1:21:57] amazing grace how sweet the sound i once
[1:22:00] was lost
[1:22:07] oh let the master
[1:22:09] take you in your hands
[1:22:11] god gave you that life
[1:22:13] that you have this morning

[1:22:29] if we've wasted 80 years let's from this
[1:22:31] point
[1:22:34] let the rest of our life mean something
[1:22:38] to let the rest of our lives
[1:22:40] mean something
[1:22:42] that someone could walk up to your
[1:22:44] coffin and say i tell you one thing
[1:22:46] i saw jesus
[1:22:48] and john martin
[1:22:49] i saw jesus and mark i saw jesus and

[1:23:03] words wrong but i saw jesus
[1:23:06] in that man amen
[1:23:08] so this time of dedication this morning
[1:23:10] friends
[1:23:12] let's rededicate our lives
[1:23:15] not just the building
[1:23:17] but our lives
[1:23:19] to him
[1:23:21] do you love him this morning
[1:23:24] where do you stand
[1:23:26] in god's light this morning
[1:23:29] when god sees you
[1:23:31] what does he think of
[1:23:33] does he see himself
[1:23:34] does he see a church member
[1:23:36] does he see a hypocrite
[1:23:38] does he see a deceiver a liar
[1:23:41] what does he see
[1:23:43] but god help us this morning he said
[1:23:45] brother what can i do about it
[1:23:48] there's only one thing you can do
[1:23:50] surrender that life to him
[1:23:54] for as i said god don't need my ability
[1:23:56] he certainly don't need my education
[1:23:59] all he
[1:24:00] wants is my heart
[1:24:07] amen
[1:24:09] let us bow our heads this morning
[1:24:14] heavenly father
[1:24:17] lord we thank you for these words today
[1:24:22] thank god i
[1:24:24] i wasn't just speaking to these people
[1:24:26] lord you know my heart
[1:24:29] i was speaking
[1:24:31] to myself
[1:24:34] that oh god that my life
[1:24:38] would be pleasing to you
[1:24:43] going 34 years
[1:24:46] i've been traveling

[1:24:52] many times
[1:24:54] i've missed birthdays and
[1:24:56] he piano recitals
[1:25:00] but lord what would all that mean if i
[1:25:02] come to the end of the road
[1:25:06] and i failed lord
[1:25:10] i failed to represent you
[1:25:13] so oh god today lord
[1:25:16] we don't just dedicate this building to
[1:25:18] you
[1:25:21] but we dedicate ourselves lord
[1:25:24] come into my heart lord jesus
[1:25:28] shine your light through me
[1:25:32] forgive us of our sins and our
[1:25:34] shortcomings
[1:25:36] forgive us lord for our ideals and our
[1:25:39] opinions that's contrary to your word
[1:25:44] but lord
[1:25:46] may we be like enoch
[1:25:49] who was not because you took him lord
[1:25:52] amen
[1:25:53] because before his translation he had
[1:25:56] this testimony
[1:25:58] that he pleased you
[1:26:03] oh god
[1:26:05] may our lives
[1:26:06] be pleasing to you today
[1:26:11] granted lord
[1:26:16] whatever has bowed this more than i i
[1:26:18] wonder friends
[1:26:20] i never point you out and embarrass you
[1:26:22] i would never do that
[1:26:25] but if you're here this morning
[1:26:28] just take a moment
[1:26:31] the sister cheryl is playing it softly i
[1:26:33] surrender all just take a moment
[1:26:37] and reflect upon your life
[1:26:40] have you really done that which pleases
[1:26:42] him
[1:26:45] or have you drifted
[1:26:48] have you got your eyes off of him and
[1:26:50] owned to the world
[1:26:53] as we said one night's month service
[1:26:56] this week as low as peter had his eyes
[1:26:58] above jesus the storm had no effect on
[1:27:01] him
[1:27:02] it was only when he looked at the waves
[1:27:04] that he began to sink into the water
[1:27:08] and i say to you this morning
[1:27:10] if you've got your eyes on the world and
[1:27:12] you've tried to cater after them
[1:27:16] where is it going to lead you friend
[1:27:17] it'll lead you exactly where it leads
[1:27:19] them
[1:27:21] to destruction
[1:27:24] but oh if you can get your eyes upon him
[1:27:27] this morning
[1:27:28] if you could turn your eyes upon jesus
[1:27:32] and surrender to him and let him lead
[1:27:35] your life
[1:27:36] where will it lead you it'll lead you
[1:27:38] like it led enoch
[1:27:40] into a translation
[1:27:43] of not even seeing death
[1:27:45] he was not
[1:27:46] because god took him
[1:27:51] if you're here this morning
[1:27:53] and the word has spoke to your heart and
[1:27:55] you want to rededicate your life to him
[1:27:58] you want to surrender your heart to him
[1:28:00] or whatever you would find yourself this
[1:28:02] morning he's here for him
[1:28:05] would you just slip up out of your seat
[1:28:07] just stand and just raise your head and
[1:28:09] say lord
[1:28:10] remember me lord
[1:28:13] i want to be like you
[1:28:16] i want to give myself away
[1:28:19] i want to give myself a way that you can
[1:28:21] use me
[1:28:24] take my heart lord take my
[1:28:27] think everything that i am lord into
[1:28:30] your hands
[1:28:32] i surrender to you this morning
[1:28:37] i'm not even gonna look around i don't
[1:28:39] know if you're standing or not standing
[1:28:43] but i'm gonna pray this prayer

[1:49:33] i started johnson's church
[1:49:59] um
[1:50:20] i never experienced the love of god
[1:50:29] and i feel like this ministry is a
[1:50:31] mystery where if someone comes to the
[1:50:34] doors of this building that they'll
[1:50:36] never feel like
[1:50:38] people are
[1:50:40] thinking negative towards them
[1:50:42] but
[1:50:43] they can
[1:50:45] no matter what condition they're in they
[1:50:47] can come and
[1:50:49] give their heart to lord
[1:51:04] with
[1:51:11] just the battles in the church itself
[1:51:14] and
[1:51:14] i've grown to really love them
[1:51:17] a lot
[1:51:18] it's
[1:51:31] it's not hard to give to
[1:52:00] of being
[1:52:15] could see jesus in you in spite of your
[1:52:16] past it's quite yourself
[1:52:18] despite
[1:52:19] whatever
[1:52:20] is going on that we can manifest jesus
[1:52:23] christ the world that we live
[1:52:24] amen
[1:52:25] and i believe that this ministry will
[1:52:27] help me make a rapture amen and that's
[1:52:29] important
[1:52:31] because there's a lot of ministries
[1:52:33] in this ministry
[1:52:36] it will
[1:52:37] help
[1:52:38] meet jesus
[1:52:45] amen praise the lord
[1:52:47] [Applause]
[1:52:51] you know when it gets right down to us
[1:52:53] and what we're saying comes from the
[1:52:56] inside it actually is
[1:52:58] changing
[1:53:00] our countenance
[1:53:02] seeing the inside of a person
[1:53:05] and
[1:53:06] may the lord always have
[1:53:08] that ability
[1:53:10] as we yield ourselves to god that he can
[1:53:12] do what he wants to in our life because
[1:53:14] he wants to do greater things he has a
[1:53:16] vision for us
[1:53:18] that is beyond our vision
[1:53:21] amen amen i'm just going to ask your
