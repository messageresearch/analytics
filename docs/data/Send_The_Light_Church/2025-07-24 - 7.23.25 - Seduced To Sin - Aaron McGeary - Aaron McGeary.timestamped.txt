[16:28] guests tonight. Amen. Especially for
[16:30] Wednesday. It's great to have God's
[16:32] house full. So, we pray that God will
[16:35] meet you where you come in. Amen.
[16:40] Uh
[16:42] let's just uh
[16:44] remember
[16:46] our brother Gideon's coming uh Sunday,
[16:49] right? And brother Aaron will be here
[16:52] again next Wednesday. Is that correct?
[16:54] Right. So let's remember them two
[16:57] announcements.
[16:58] Also, uh I was cleaning the church today
[17:02] and that back door was open.
[17:05] It was it it seemed like it was I pushed
[17:08] on a couple times and it opened and it
[17:10] but it looked locked. So, it's just kind
[17:12] of a warning to everybody that uses that
[17:14] door until we have a look at it. So,
[17:17] make sure you shut shut the door behind
[17:19] you and it's locked. And let's let's
[17:22] remember our sister Cheryl. She's having
[17:24] surgery on Friday yet again. And uh we
[17:28] just pray that the doctor will uh do
[17:31] what he needs to do and she gets a
[17:33] speedy recovery and uh gets rid of the
[17:37] uh chronic cough that she's had.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; And uh we're looking for a full
[17:42] restoration.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; So let's just be praying for our sister
[17:46] on Friday. Amen.
[17:49] And if you could also remember my sister
[17:51] that's staying with me for a couple
[17:54] weeks here um because of foot surgery
[17:58] um that uh
[18:00] she needs a a deeper walk with Christ.
[18:04] But we all do. So just pray on her
[18:07] behalf, please. Uh let's just remember
[18:11] um our brother Aaron who's coming
[18:14] expecting tonight. I pray that
[18:16] &gt;&gt; you know God will meet your God's got a
[18:19] table a full table
[18:22] &gt;&gt; and sometimes we are our appetite
[18:24] doesn't meet his table. So come with a
[18:27] good appetite and he'll feed you.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's just stand tonight. Amen.
[18:33] Uh let's just ask the Lord to just bless
[18:35] the person next to you and uh
[18:38] &gt;&gt; give them revelation tonight and uh that
[18:41] we can all just be on one accord.
[18:44] Heavenly Father, as we come to you
[18:46] tonight, Lord, we've come to you with
[18:48] these requests, Lord, for our sister
[18:49] Cheryl, on this surgery that's coming
[18:51] up, Lord, we know, Lord, that you're in
[18:54] charge, Lord. And we we have faith in
[18:56] that, Lord. And we're trusting in you
[18:58] for that, Lord, that she know this
[19:01] surgery will take care of this chronic
[19:03] cough that she has, Lord, and you just
[19:06] make a full restoration in her life,
[19:08] Lord God. So, oh Lord God, as we come to
[19:11] you tonight, Lord God, with heavyhearted
[19:14] things for many things that would be
[19:15] personal upon our hearts maybe, Lord,
[19:18] but Lord, you know every one of our
[19:20] thoughts, Lord. So we, Lord, just pull
[19:22] them into captivity tonight and turn
[19:24] them over to you, Lord God, that you
[19:26] might know our prayers, Lord, that you
[19:28] might act upon our uh faith, Lord,
[19:31] tonight, Lord, to resolve these issues
[19:33] in our lives, Lord. whatever it would
[19:35] be, Lord God, we know that you're more
[19:37] than capable of doing it, Lord, if we
[19:39] just get out of the way. So, Lord, as we
[19:42] so go on in in this service tonight,
[19:45] Lord, we just pray that these uh prayers
[19:49] and the these offerings of worship and
[19:51] praise, Lord, would just bring an
[19:53] atmosphere that would be pleasing unto
[19:55] you. So, we thank you for all these
[19:57] things in precious name of our Lord and
[19:59] Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be
[20:02] seated. Amen.
[20:05] Amen.

[20:50] Is that okay? Yeah, that should be okay.
[20:54] Thanks.
[20:57] [Music]
[21:19] I've truly known
[21:23] the good life
[21:25] filled with family
[21:29] and friends.
[21:33] I've been blessed
[21:35] with more than my share.
[21:44] And yet with all of my good fortune,
[21:51] my heart is sinking still.
[21:57] Oh, I just can't
[22:00] deny the longing.
[22:09] It's Jesus
[22:13] I really want to see.
[22:22] It's Jesus
[22:25] I really want to see.
[22:34] The more I see
[22:37] of this world,
[22:40] the less it means to me.
[22:45] Yes, it's Jesus.
[22:49] I really want to see.
[22:59] I've been a lot of places.
[23:05] I've known the great and small.
[23:10] I've seen the grand
[23:13] and known the works of men.
[23:22] But in the heart
[23:24] of my heart,
[23:28] I know there's more for me.
[23:33] So much more than
[23:37] this fading world I see.
[23:45] It's Jesus
[23:48] I really want to see.
[23:57] It's Jesus
[24:00] I really want to see.
[24:05] [Applause]
[24:09] The more I see of this world,
[24:14] the less it means to me.
[24:19] Yes, it's Jesus
[24:23] I really want to see.
[24:32] And the more I see
[24:35] of this world,
[24:38] the less it means to me.
[24:43] Yes, it's Jesus
[24:47] I really want to see.
[24:58] [Applause]
[25:06] Amen.

[26:47] By my spirit, saith the Lord.
[26:52] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[26:55] A mountain is just
[26:59] a thought of unbelief
[27:02] &gt;&gt; because all things are possible.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; Well, let's just cast out any unbelief
[27:07] and just believe.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; God said that to me.
[27:15] Let's just stand. Amen. Uh we're going
[27:18] to take up the tithes and offerings.
[27:19] Brother John, can you do that?
[27:21] Heavenly Father, thank you for a place
[27:24] together.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you that you made it a way
[27:28] that we could have what we have. Your
[27:31] plan has always worked from the
[27:33] beginning. We just pray that you would
[27:36] bless and multiply the offering that be
[27:38] taken up and that you bless your people
[27:40] for giving. Lord, may it just meet every
[27:43] need that we would have. We give you
[27:45] praise for these things in Jesus name.
[27:48] Amen.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. Uh, brother
[27:51] Johnny, you want to come up and we'll
[27:52] just sing in the presence of Jehovah.
[27:54] Amen.
[27:57] in the presence
[28:03] of Jehovah,
[28:08] God Almighty,
[28:13] Prince of Peace.
[28:19] almost vanished.
[28:23] Hearts are managed
[28:29] in that presence
[28:34] of the king.
[28:38] [Music]
[28:39] In the prayer I bless you
[28:44] of Jehovah
[28:48] [Music]
[28:49] God Almighty,
[28:54] prince of peace,
[28:59] trles vanish,
[29:04] hearts are mened.
[29:09] in the presence
[29:13] [Music]
[29:15] of our king. Let's stand together and
[29:18] sing that
[29:20] in the presence
[29:25] of Jehovah
[29:30] God Almighty.
[29:32] [Music]
[29:35] Prince of peace,
[29:40] trles and
[29:46] hearts are mened
[29:51] in the presence
[29:56] of the king.
[29:59] Amen. We are standing on holy ground.
[30:03] are standing
[30:05] [Music]
[30:07] on holy
[30:10] ground.
[30:13] And I know that there are angels
[30:19] all around.
[30:24] Let us praise
[30:29] Jesus
[30:31] now.
[30:34] We are standing in his presence on holy
[30:41] ground. We're believing it.
[30:45] We are standing
[30:49] on holy
[30:52] ground.
[30:55] And I know that there are angels
[31:02] all around.
[31:06] Let us praise
[31:11] Jesus
[31:13] now.
[31:17] We are standing in his presence on holy
[31:24] ground.
[31:27] Amen. and how unworthy
[31:30] &gt;&gt; we are to be in the presence of Jehovah.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; We're unworthy.
[31:36] We're unworthy. And I believe it's that
[31:40] that attitude that brings God on the
[31:44] scene.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Think a prophet Isaiah,
[31:49] a prophet. We're not prophets. He was a
[31:51] prophet. And yet he felt so unworthy to
[31:54] be in the presence of Jehovah. Amen.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; We're a blessed people today to know how
[31:59] to reverence the Lord. Amen. How to
[32:02] respect the Lord. Amen. I'll say it's a
[32:05] great privilege for us to have brother
[32:07] Aaron, Sister Elizabeth, the family.
[32:11] They're growing
[32:12] pretty soon. They're going to be
[32:14] ministering here,
[32:17] but we don't get to have brother Aaron
[32:19] as much. And we're just so much
[32:21] appreciate him. He's just as solid as
[32:25] can be. And let's just invite him to
[32:28] come forward. Give us the word of life
[32:30] today as we sing um only believe. Only
[32:34] believe. Amen.
[32:37] Only
[32:39] believe.
[32:42] Only
[32:44] believe.
[32:47] All things are possible.
[32:51] Holy
[32:53] believe,
[32:55] all
[32:57] isol.
[33:00] [Music]
[33:04] All these are my soul.
[33:10] Sing it again. Only believe. Heat. Heat.
[33:23] is our
[33:26] only
[33:28] [Music]
[33:39] All.
[33:48] And that's our our national anthem. Fear
[33:51] not, believe only.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; I believe that all things are possible
[33:56] by faith through God. And I just I love
[33:58] singing that song because it reminds us
[34:00] just to keep believing.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Truly is the word only
[34:03] &gt;&gt; in this hour and and our faith in it.
[34:06] And I think that's what the preaching of
[34:07] the word to promote.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; So good to be here with you this
[34:10] evening. I consider it a great privilege
[34:11] as usual. I was thinking today, I meant
[34:13] to ask the question, but I think I'm
[34:15] beyond the age now that brother John was
[34:19] when I first came and ministered here
[34:20] and since the church first started and I
[34:23] was thinking I've been preaching here
[34:24] just as long as you have
[34:28] since 2001. So, it's um you guys have
[34:32] already heard everything I know and
[34:33] maybe twice.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Uh but the uh it's just awesome to come
[34:37] and be here. It was nice to see some of
[34:39] the young men and I think brother
[34:41] Jonathan was there too on Saturday in
[34:43] Literal Life Church with brother Paula
[34:45] Fontaine. They had a men's meeting on
[34:47] Saturday morning and then also again
[34:50] that Sunday evening was tri-state so got
[34:52] to see some of you then and sister
[34:53] Russell got to see Matt and Hannah. It
[34:55] been a long time since I seen them and
[34:57] so it's just really nice to connect and
[34:59] that's why we're here earlier than
[35:00] usual. I know you guys were all just
[35:02] getting ready for it in August, but we
[35:04] decided to come a little bit early and
[35:06] we're really really happy to be here.
[35:08] Brother John and Sister Cheryl dearly,
[35:10] and I'm glad that they I have
[35:12] grandchildren and a wonderful wife
[35:15] enough for them to put up with me for a
[35:17] couple weeks. Mark chapter 13 verse 22.
[35:22] I'm going to be ministering on a lot of
[35:25] familiar scriptures and maybe even a
[35:26] familiar theme in some ways where it may
[35:29] seem like well this is we've heard
[35:31] something like this before remind a lot
[35:33] of these things but I do want to come at
[35:34] it from a little bit different angle and
[35:37] so if you'll just patient with me and if
[35:39] you love going through the scriptures
[35:41] you'll enjoy the service tonight but my
[35:43] title is seduced to sin. I know that may
[35:46] be kind of a a catchy title, but if the
[35:48] influences do it and the news articles
[35:51] do it to get as clickbait, uh, I'll use
[35:54] it myself tonight. Seduced to sin. Mark
[35:57] 13:22.
[35:58] For false Christ and false prophets
[36:01] shall rise and shall show signs and
[36:03] wonders to seduce, if it were possible,
[36:07] even the elect. Notice the the way that
[36:10] Mark emphasizes it here. not just to
[36:12] deceive, if it were possible, but to
[36:14] seduce, if it were possible, even the
[36:17] elect. If we could just bow our heads in
[36:19] a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we're
[36:21] so grateful to be gathered together this
[36:22] evening in your presence. Lord,
[36:24] &gt;&gt; and we know that where two or three are
[36:26] gathered together in your name, there
[36:28] you are in our midst. And where you are,
[36:29] there's that power and that potential
[36:32] for all things, Lord. As brother Ron
[36:34] already admonished us, you're here now.
[36:36] And we believe that, Lord. And then to
[36:39] think that it's not just two or three,
[36:40] but it's dozens here tonight.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; That the the church house is full and
[36:45] visitors have come in and with such a
[36:48] wonderful atmosphere and a beautiful
[36:49] worship,
[36:50] &gt;&gt; we should believe, Lord, tonight that
[36:53] you can speak to us because you desire
[36:55] to. You promise to. So we commit
[36:57] ourselves to you now trusting that your
[36:59] word will just flow freely that we could
[37:01] receive it into our hearts. Lord, may we
[37:03] not try to understand it in the way that
[37:06] the minister is emphasizing it, but
[37:08] catch your heart, Lord, to catch what
[37:11] you would have us to see, what you would
[37:12] have us to hear. We ask this in the name
[37:14] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You could be seated. Lord,
[37:20] &gt;&gt; I want to define what I mean by seduced
[37:22] right off the bat so you can kind of see
[37:24] what direction we're going in this. But
[37:26] to seduce or to be seduced, if you
[37:28] seduce someone, it would cause to go
[37:31] astray. So if you are seduced, you've
[37:33] been caused to go astray. You've been
[37:34] led away from truth into error. And
[37:37] that's maybe the primary meaning in the
[37:39] scripture. If you're seduced, you're led
[37:41] away from truth into air. You're not
[37:44] can't really be seduced from one error
[37:45] to another. That's just the uh outcome
[37:48] of following the wrong kind of
[37:49] leadership. And so you're seduced from
[37:52] truth into air. And as I look at this
[37:55] seduced and that's the way that we're
[37:56] wanting to present it tonight, I I'd
[37:59] like to give a a close look at sin and
[38:03] not that we're going to talk about all
[38:04] sorts of things that are sinful, but as
[38:06] a concept or as a thing and really
[38:08] really drill down on how we're taught in
[38:10] the message of the hour of what sin is.
[38:13] And I'll say this to completely
[38:15] overcome, it's important to understand
[38:17] the nature of sin. And I know in saying
[38:20] that as I've meditated it on this week,
[38:22] we might think, oh well, am I constantly
[38:24] making mistakes? I don't understand it
[38:26] perfectly or completely. But it's in
[38:28] that vein of to overcome is to recognize
[38:30] the devil and every one of his tricks.
[38:32] So we're going to overcome completely.
[38:34] There is it's important to understand
[38:36] the nature of sin
[38:39] &gt;&gt; and arrogance and constant failure that
[38:41] that pride and even failure and and
[38:45] constant stumbling are two consequences
[38:47] of not recognizing sin not understanding
[38:50] what sin is. As Paul said we are not
[38:53] ignorant of his devices. So there's
[38:55] there must be some revelation insider or
[38:58] understanding. Maybe a good way to put
[39:00] it would be discernment of sin and the
[39:03] one that uh and its nature and how that
[39:05] it works in order to completely overcome
[39:08] it.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 6 verse 23 it says for
[39:12] the wages of sin is death but the gift
[39:15] of God is eternal life through Jesus
[39:17] Christ our Lord. So there's uh these two
[39:20] two different things wages of sin and
[39:22] the gift of God. And it says it it is
[39:25] eternal life. The gift of God is eternal
[39:28] life, but the wages of sin is permanent
[39:30] separation from God. So that's the
[39:33] that's the results of sin. And if sin
[39:36] results in permanent separation from
[39:39] God, I want to know what sin is.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; If that's what's going to keep me
[39:43] distant from him or separate from him,
[39:45] and we do know the other hand of
[39:46] overcoming is not only recognize that
[39:49] the devil and all of his tricks, but
[39:51] recognize that greater is he that is in
[39:52] you that than he that is in the world.
[39:55] and he's already overcome him. So the
[39:57] other side of it is the gift of God is
[39:59] eternal life through Jesus Christ our
[40:02] Lord. Amen.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; So in this scripture we could say that
[40:04] we have sin's wage on one hand versus
[40:07] God's gift on the other. And I like this
[40:10] scripture at the outset because I would
[40:12] never want to lose sight of this is that
[40:13] sin can only be understood as a contrast
[40:16] to God or in relationship to God. Can't
[40:19] just really examine sin on its own and
[40:22] really understand it. You want to first
[40:23] understand that there is a holy, there
[40:25] is a truth, there is a right. And
[40:27] therefore the perversion uh is something
[40:29] that is twisted, manipulated or in some
[40:32] ways deviated from truth. As we know a
[40:35] lie can be just it's a truth perverted.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; So the wages of sin is death. The gift
[40:41] of God is eternal life. So sin has a
[40:43] consequence. And really sin and its
[40:46] consequence only really begins to be
[40:48] understood in light of the fact that the
[40:51] gift of God is eternal life. Sin will
[40:53] give you uh death but God will give you
[40:56] eternal life through Jesus Christ.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Now I want to look at a number of
[41:00] scriptures. I might have a a dozen or so
[41:03] in the outset here just to look at sin
[41:06] and its nature because misinterpreting
[41:08] sin leads to confusion about our sinful
[41:11] state. And and I I go through this
[41:14] knowing that you all are familiar with
[41:15] them. You'll finish the verses even
[41:17] before I get to them. Uh because you
[41:19] know them, but it's important to just
[41:21] recognize scripturally the condition
[41:23] that we're born in. Psalm 51:5, "Behold,
[41:27] I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did
[41:30] my mother conceive me." This is that
[41:32] innate sinfulness that all mankind has
[41:35] from the original sin. There's none of
[41:38] us that are born. No matter how,
[41:39] especially some of the young ones here,
[41:40] no matter how perfect uh this may be to
[41:43] my family, no matter how perfect your
[41:44] dad is, you're born in sin. That's just
[41:47] the way that it is. No matter how
[41:49] wonderful your mom is, no matter how you
[41:51] feel that they can never make a mistake,
[41:53] we are born in sin. And the writer here
[41:55] is saying that sin is in me and I am in
[41:58] sin.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; And so this is that innate sinfulness
[42:01] for all of us. Sin is in us and we are
[42:03] in sin by birth. Isaiah 64:6 says, "But
[42:07] we are all as an unclean thing, and all
[42:11] our righteousness are as filthy rags,
[42:13] and we all do fade as a leaf, and our
[42:15] iniquities like the wind have taken us
[42:17] away."
[42:20] This isn't just saying, "Well, we all
[42:21] have some growing up to do, or we don't
[42:24] all come out of the womb on the same
[42:26] level, saying we're all unclean." any
[42:28] righteousness or good in contrast to God
[42:31] is as a filthy rag that because of sin
[42:34] we fade and our iniquities drive us like
[42:37] the wind that's taken us away. Romans
[42:40] chapter 7 verse 5. For when we are we
[42:43] were in the flesh the motions of sins.
[42:46] Notice that phrase, the motions of sin
[42:48] which were by the law did work in our
[42:50] members to bring forth fruit unto death.
[42:53] This means we're all naturally inclined
[42:56] to sin. We could say I'm born in sin and
[42:58] that just maybe be this abiding state,
[43:00] this way that I'm born. I'm born in the
[43:02] flesh. No matter what I do, I'm born in
[43:04] sin. But it's not just to be born in
[43:06] sin, but the motions of sin work within
[43:10] us to bring forth fruit unto death. It
[43:13] says that our iniquities like the wind
[43:15] have taken us away. We've been shaped
[43:17] and conceived and then moved and
[43:20] animated and we're naturally inclined to
[43:22] sin.
[43:24] This is a fun scripture in Jeremiah
[43:25] 13:23. Can the Ethiopian change his skin
[43:29] or the leopard his spots? Then may ye
[43:32] also do good that are accustomed to do
[43:35] evil. And it's saying that it's natural
[43:38] to sin. That the nature of sin is in us
[43:41] by our first birth. So we all have are
[43:44] born in sin. No matter if you never
[43:46] spoke a lie, if you did everything
[43:48] right, even according to the law, you're
[43:50] still in sin. You still would need an
[43:52] approp appropriation for your sin,
[43:54] proper perpetuation for your sin. You'd
[43:56] need to be accepting of the blood of
[43:58] Jesus Christ. But by the first birth, we
[44:00] have this nature to do evil.
[44:04] Paul writes it this way in Romans 7:1
[44:07] 18. For I know that in me, that is in my
[44:09] flesh, dwelleth no good thing. For to
[44:13] will is present with me. But how to
[44:15] perform that which is good I find not.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not how how can I perform uh
[44:21] my own righteousness because that can be
[44:23] performed through discipline. But to do
[44:26] good, the only good and uh the only good
[44:28] is the father and every good and perfect
[44:30] gift cometh from above. It says to do
[44:32] good, I don't have it within me
[44:34] naturally. It's not innate. It's not my
[44:36] instinct to be to be truly righteous or
[44:39] divine.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Psalms 58:3 says, "The wicked are
[44:43] estranged from the womb. They go astray
[44:46] as soon as they be born speaking lies. I
[44:49] know sometimes in the message brother
[44:50] Brandon would convi combine Psalms 51
[44:53] and Psalms 58, but you see just how
[44:55] perfectly they fit together. Shaping
[44:57] iniquity and sin did my mother conceive
[44:59] me. I've come from the womb speaking
[45:02] lies. I know it maybe doesn't seem to be
[45:05] a very light sermon tonight. This is all
[45:07] the dark stuff, but it's kind of how you
[45:09] create tension in a sermon. You got to
[45:10] build that sermon. And in the end, we
[45:12] look to Christ, who is our hero, who
[45:14] delivers us from sin and death.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; But they go astray as soon as they're
[45:18] born, speaking lies. Romans 3:26 3 says,
[45:21] "For all have sinned and come short of
[45:23] the glory of God."
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Just making sure nobody has an out
[45:27] tonight. Somebody may say, "Well, I
[45:28] don't know about this. I don't know
[45:29] about By the time we're done, you're
[45:30] boxed in."
[45:32] &gt;&gt; You know that you come into the world
[45:33] speaking lies. You know that you're
[45:35] sinful by nature. You know that in you
[45:37] dwelleth no good thing. Amen.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 20. For
[45:42] there is not a just man upon the earth
[45:44] that doeth good and sinnth not.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; I know that may think, well, I know some
[45:48] really good people, but you have to take
[45:50] it all together. A just man that does
[45:52] good and sins not. Maybe we've known
[45:53] some just men. Maybe we know some that
[45:55] have done good in the flesh, but there's
[45:57] none that they could say they have not
[45:59] sinned.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Where it says in 1 John 1:18, if we say
[46:02] that we have no sin, we deceive
[46:05] ourselves and the truth is not in us.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Just imagine that. We don't even need
[46:09] the devil to seduce us. We'll seduce
[46:10] ourselves. If we say that we have not
[46:14] sinned,
[46:16] &gt;&gt; for all have sinned. We say we have
[46:18] none, we deceive ourselves and there
[46:20] cannot be truth in us. So there's this
[46:22] element of truth that acknowledges our
[46:25] in the inherit sinfulness in us by the
[46:27] first birth. Ephesians chapter 2 verse
[46:30] one even speaking of how that we have
[46:32] been quickened and we've been raised
[46:34] from this death. He says, "And you hath
[46:36] he quickened who were dead in trespasses
[46:38] and sin."
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; In order to be quickened, you have to
[46:41] have at one time been dead in sin. You
[46:43] must have been driven by the motions of
[46:45] sin. That iniquity as a wind driving you
[46:48] away. But that's the rescue of Christ
[46:50] who takes you out of that tempest of sin
[46:52] and sets you up on a solid rock. And
[46:55] that's that you were dead in trespasses
[46:57] and sin and now you've been quickened.
[47:00] Romans chapter 8:7. Because the carnal
[47:02] mind is immity against God, for it is
[47:05] not subject to the law of God, neither
[47:07] indeed can be. Speaks again of that
[47:11] sinfulness that's in us by birth. The
[47:13] fact that we're human. The fact that
[47:15] we're born of a woman. The carnal mind,
[47:17] the natural mind is opposed to God. It
[47:18] is not righteous. It is not holy. It
[47:21] does not think like God. It does not act
[47:22] like God. God says, "Your ways are not
[47:24] my ways. Your thoughts are not my
[47:26] thoughts." And they're so far and
[47:28] separate and apart that they're not even
[47:30] likened unto one another. They're
[47:31] actually enemies to each other. This is
[47:34] the nature of our first birth. Says in
[47:38] Romans chapter 5:12,
[47:40] I think if we look at this, we can begin
[47:42] to just recognize a little bit now the
[47:46] origins of sin. Wherefore, as by one man
[47:48] sin entered into the world, and death by
[47:51] sin, and so death passed upon all men,
[47:54] for that all have sinned. Now, we
[47:56] recognize we we're all sinners. And you
[47:59] say, "Well, brother," and you read about
[47:59] a dozen quote uh statements already that
[48:01] prove that. Now, we can kind of back
[48:04] into this. We've all sinned, but and and
[48:06] sin is the w death is the wages of sin.
[48:09] But how do we get there? By one man. Sin
[48:12] entered into the world. And as sin
[48:14] entered into the world by one man, death
[48:16] came by that. Therefore, death is upon
[48:18] all man because man is born in sin and
[48:22] sin is in him. Genesis chapter 2 25. Now
[48:26] we can see these contrasting conditions.
[48:29] The one uh the one condition of being
[48:31] sinless and the other condition of being
[48:32] in sin. And it says this about the man
[48:35] and the woman before the fall. And they
[48:37] were both naked. The man and his wife
[48:39] and were not ashamed. Now we just uh
[48:43] take a pause here for a second. Brother
[48:45] Paula Fontaine said that I have a a push
[48:48] pause ministry. He says some people have
[48:49] a push play and obey. And he says, "Mine
[48:51] is push pause and ponder, I think, or
[48:54] think think really hard about what he
[48:55] just said. Maybe have time to search it,
[48:58] make sure it's in there." But as we just
[49:00] take a moment to think about this, we
[49:02] hopefully have just seen very quickly
[49:04] about our sinful nature by birth. And
[49:07] then we're kind of looking at, well, how
[49:08] did we get here? And God is, the
[49:11] scriptur is describing here a time when
[49:13] man, even though he's naked, he's not
[49:15] ashamed. And to have no shame, there's
[49:18] no sin. There's no evil. It's only
[49:21] innocence.
[49:23] There there's no there's no stain.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; There's no blush. There's no mark upon
[49:29] them. There's there's no sin. There's no
[49:30] fear. And so, this is that perfect
[49:33] condition that we are not born into. The
[49:37] first man and woman that God set upon
[49:39] the earth, they were born into a perfect
[49:41] condition. As it says in Genesis 1:31,
[49:44] that God looked and said, "It was very
[49:46] good."
[49:47] &gt;&gt; The end of that sixth day, it was very
[49:48] good. This is that sinlessness of
[49:51] creation. He said, "I see no sin. I see
[49:54] no unrighteousness. I see no
[49:56] perversion." But in Genesis 3:13
[50:00] says, "The Lord God said unto the woman,
[50:02] what is this that thou hast done,
[50:05] sin has entered in, fear enters in upon
[50:08] man, and the woman said, the serpent
[50:10] beguiled me, and I did eat." So this is
[50:14] the this is the at the very beginning
[50:16] their sinlessness. Now, because by one
[50:19] man sin enters into the world, we say
[50:21] that's clearly Adam. Sinless sin enters
[50:24] into the world. And because that death
[50:26] passes upon all of us because we've all
[50:28] sinned, this is the moment we could say
[50:30] that it transitions away from this godly
[50:32] righteousness, this glory of God, this
[50:35] image of God, this sinless perfection
[50:37] upon mankind to fear and sin and shame
[50:42] and nakedness. And the woman says, "The
[50:44] serpent beguiled me and I did eat."
[50:47] Begott means he led me astray.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; I was su I was deceived. The word in the
[50:53] Hebrew is I have been seduced.
[50:56] I had been morally seduced into this an
[50:59] act which she symbolizes by eating. She
[51:02] had been seduced to sin. That's the
[51:05] origin of sin. The origin of sin is in
[51:08] that seduction. And so if we look
[51:11] closely at the fall, it examines how
[51:13] Satan uses or exposes how Satan uses
[51:17] seduction to cause sin.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; I know our minds were thinking, "Oh man,
[51:22] brother Aaron, you could really hit a
[51:23] lot of nasty things we see in Leodysia
[51:25] today and you could really hit it a lot
[51:26] of these lust and things." But and
[51:28] that's true, but there's something
[51:30] there's an undercurrent to all of it.
[51:32] I'll even say it now that many times
[51:34] young men or even our young ladies or
[51:36] any of us if we say something we should
[51:38] and we see something we should and we
[51:39] begin to feel guilty or we feel unclean
[51:42] uh the devil he's definitely trying to
[51:44] get you to do that but what he wants to
[51:46] do is keep that uncleanness in your
[51:48] conscience so it causes you to re
[51:51] withdraw from fellowship
[51:53] &gt;&gt; to not go to church feel reluctant to
[51:55] pray for your children and so there's a
[51:57] way where that's one thing but the real
[51:58] damage of it is the separation it causes
[52:01] from God.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; And we'll see that very clearly here in
[52:04] the scripture. So, I really feel like
[52:06] I'm in the meat of it. And so, the more
[52:08] you absorb this and indicate you do so,
[52:11] the faster you're going to be able to go
[52:12] to Uncle Ray afterwards.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; And if you if if you don't help me, we
[52:17] they're going to be closed by the time
[52:18] we're done.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; In Genesis 3:1, it says, "Now the
[52:22] serpent was more subtle than any beast
[52:25] of the field which the Lord God had
[52:26] made." So, here's this a subtlety. And
[52:30] he said unto the woman, "Yay, hath God
[52:32] said, you shall not eat of every tree of
[52:35] the garden?" Now this serpent, subtle,
[52:39] cunning, very very intelligent,
[52:43] he speaks and and I I want you to catch
[52:45] the nature of this because this is the
[52:47] first really uh recorded conversation
[52:51] and I can say at least the very first
[52:54] conversation about God.
[52:56] and he says to the woman. So the serpent
[52:59] speaks, he speaks to the woman, and he
[53:02] speaks to the woman what God spoke.
[53:04] Those are three things I want you to
[53:05] recognize. First, the serpent speaks,
[53:08] and then he speaks to the woman, and
[53:10] then when he speaks, he speaks to the
[53:11] woman what God spoke.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; And so he's he's he's interpreting what
[53:16] he says or what he's kind of suggesting.
[53:19] There's a certain interpretation to what
[53:21] God said.
[53:23] Yay. hath God said you shall not eat of
[53:26] every tree of the garden. Now when he
[53:29] uses this phrase yay hath God said he
[53:31] kind of uses this impersonal designation
[53:34] of God kind of this transcendent Elohim.
[53:37] He says yay Elohim hath said so this is
[53:40] the God who in the beginning created but
[53:43] when he says this it's this supernatural
[53:45] being a distant God. So even by his
[53:48] first uh indication and conversation
[53:51] about God, we begin to identify what
[53:52] Satan's trying to do. Yahath Elohim said
[53:55] it's something distant and impersonal.
[53:57] And in Genesis 2:4 though, it says,
[53:59] "These are the generations of the
[54:01] heavens and of the earth when they were
[54:03] created in the day that the Lord God
[54:05] made the he earth and the heavens." So
[54:08] God is not just being indicated as
[54:10] Elohim, but he's Lord God, which is that
[54:12] Jehovah Elohim or Yahweh. It gives God
[54:16] an expression. It's an expression of a
[54:18] covenant God.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; It expresses God in relationship to
[54:22] mankind. We can say Elohim as it relates
[54:24] to rocks and trees and minerals and all
[54:26] sorts of things. Elohim as it relates to
[54:29] Lucifer and all the angels and even the
[54:30] angels that fell. But once God created
[54:33] mankind and established a covenant with
[54:35] them, he's now the Lord God.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; And and I'm not just being clever with
[54:41] the words here. This is this is nothing
[54:43] but the truth. But Satan initially very
[54:46] cleverly causes distance between God and
[54:49] the woman.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[54:51] &gt;&gt; He doesn't acknowledge him as being a
[54:52] covenant God. He doesn't acknowledge
[54:54] maybe a closeness. He he doesn't begin
[54:56] to uh uh set the set the scene so she
[54:59] can fully understand that relationship
[55:01] she has with God. But she he kind of
[55:03] tells her he gives this distance in his
[55:06] language which the woman then mirrors in
[55:08] her reaction.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; When she responds, she causes that same
[55:13] distance. She puts that same distance in
[55:15] there. And he's very craftily began the
[55:18] first conversation about God by
[55:20] objectifying God
[55:22] &gt;&gt; by by talking uh talking about God, not
[55:27] to God or with God. Not talking about
[55:29] any kind of uh uh intimacy, but only
[55:33] formally. And that's really what
[55:35] theology is. Theology is talking about
[55:37] God
[55:38] &gt;&gt; where there's no inference of intimacy
[55:40] or relationship with God. When he said
[55:42] what he said, there was no suggestion
[55:44] that there was any in intimacy at all
[55:48] with God.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 26, if you look at
[55:53] this, I think this might help us to
[55:55] understand again the nature of sin and
[55:58] how that it works.
[56:00] As in this we see that there was no in
[56:04] Satan's initial conversation with the w
[56:06] woman
[56:08] he's using a language just to create a
[56:10] little bit of room between you and the
[56:12] lord in Matthew 26 69-74
[56:16] now Peter sat without in the palace and
[56:19] a damsel came unto him saying thou also
[56:22] was with Jesus of Galilee but he denied
[56:26] before them all saying I know not what
[56:29] thou sayest So now there's just maybe a
[56:32] general denial that oh you were with
[56:34] Jesus like well I don't know what you
[56:36] mean. Maybe you can say well uh I wasn't
[56:38] where you thought I was and whatever the
[56:40] argument might might have been. But he
[56:41] says when he was gone out into the porch
[56:43] another maid saw him and said unto them
[56:46] that were there this fellow was also
[56:48] with Jesus of Nazareth. And again he
[56:50] denied with an oath I do not know the
[56:53] man.
[56:55] Now not only has he said I don't know
[56:57] what you're saying. And in that way,
[56:59] maybe he's kind of softening the denial.
[57:01] Now he says, I don't know the man.
[57:02] There's even a denial of who he is. It's
[57:05] not uh he's not affirming his love and
[57:07] recognition. Thou art the Christ, the
[57:09] son of the living God. No, he's saying,
[57:11] I do not know the man. And after a while
[57:13] came unto him, they they that stood by
[57:15] and said to Peter, Surely thou also art
[57:18] one of them, for thy speech betrayeth
[57:21] thee. Then began he to curse and to
[57:24] swear, saying, "I know not the man."
[57:30] This is his This is his response under
[57:33] pressure. And he's being associated with
[57:36] Jesus in his weakest moment where it
[57:38] appears that this Messiah that they
[57:40] thought would uh uh be their deliverer,
[57:42] things don't look good. And now he's
[57:44] denied him this third time. And
[57:45] immediately the crew. Peter
[57:48] remembered the word of Jesus which said
[57:49] unto him before the cockcrow, "Thou
[57:52] shalt deny me thrice." And he went out
[57:55] and wept bitterly. Deny means to affirm
[57:59] no relationship with.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; To deny means to to affirm no connection
[58:06] with.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; So what was it he did under pressure? He
[58:09] distanced himself from Christ. And why
[58:12] was it he distanced himself from Christ
[58:14] in that moment? Because he didn't fully
[58:16] trust him.
[58:18] Had he really been convinced of who he
[58:19] was, he'd say, "Hey, hey, not going to
[58:21] lie, you had us in the first half,
[58:23] didn't you?" But he knew in that moment,
[58:25] "No, I I I know. I know who he is." If
[58:29] he had known in that moment who he was,
[58:30] he'd said, "Yeah, I was with him.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; I believe he's the son of God. I believe
[58:36] he was called to this purpose." But no,
[58:38] because he wasn't firm in who he
[58:40] believed he was, he denied and caused
[58:43] that separation. And that's where the
[58:46] devil wants to work in any moment or any
[58:48] situation is just cause really if he can
[58:50] just move in such a way to nudge you to
[58:54] get enough enough distance from Christ,
[58:56] you'll do the rest.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; From this moment when he told the woman,
[59:00] wait hasn't Elohim, this transcendent
[59:02] God, this we don't know who he is, this
[59:04] mysterious one, we'll just call him God
[59:07] Allah, this sovereign being, this master
[59:10] of the universe, didn't he say that you
[59:12] shouldn't do this? And that just that
[59:14] was the first push to get the woman
[59:16] thinking about God in an impersonal way
[59:18] to remove that relationship that God had
[59:21] with him so he could begin to seduce
[59:23] her.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Satan is skilled in this art of
[59:27] seduction.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:31] &gt;&gt; He's skilled at causing one to abandon
[59:34] abandon their allegiance
[59:37] to to uh go slack in their service to
[59:40] lose their discipline.
[59:43] What it is is Satan is just when it
[59:44] comes to art, he's adept at painting a
[59:46] false picture of God.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham likened it to he
[59:50] painted the wrong picture of God. You
[59:51] can go find some of those statements
[59:53] where there he was like this artist who
[59:55] begin to render an image of God that the
[59:57] woman beheld and in that moment she
[59:59] forgot what God really looked like.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Don't you think that happens to us many
[1:00:04] times? We get into a situation and we
[1:00:06] may know we're pitiful beings. We now
[1:00:07] we're convinced tonight if you listen to
[1:00:09] even one of the scriptures I read that
[1:00:10] yeah we're born with the stain of sin.
[1:00:13] We're miserable creatures but that's not
[1:00:15] what convinces you to fail. That's not
[1:00:17] what convinces you to make mistakes.
[1:00:18] See, you're already prone to it. But
[1:00:20] what will keep you in sin and cause you
[1:00:22] to get lifted up arrogantly or cause you
[1:00:24] to constantly stumble is when we forget
[1:00:27] who God is and what he looks like.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:30] What the serpent was able to do through
[1:00:33] the agency or what Satan was able to do
[1:00:35] through the agency of the serpent was to
[1:00:37] deceitfully impregnate that woman's mind
[1:00:40] with the wrong conception of God.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Notice this here. He says in Genesis
[1:00:46] chapter 2 16 and 17.
[1:00:50] Appreciate your attentiveness tonight.
[1:00:51] You're doing really good. Uncle Ray is
[1:00:53] looking really promising.
[1:00:56] Genesis chapter 2 16 and 17. I'll say
[1:00:59] this. I know that when I preach there's
[1:01:01] one comment just about every single time
[1:01:04] I've been preaching and all these years
[1:01:06] to this year we're celebrating 20 years
[1:01:08] of marriage. If I've heard one thing
[1:01:09] after every time I've preached my wife
[1:01:11] says that was a lot.
[1:01:14] Kind of a clever it's a clever
[1:01:15] commentary, right? A lot of what? Well,
[1:01:18] we'll just leave it at that. Honey, that
[1:01:20] was a lot. So, I know even if I just
[1:01:23] preach 30 minutes, it's going to be a
[1:01:24] lot. But in Genesis 2 16 and 17, the
[1:01:28] Lord God commanded the man, saying, "Of
[1:01:31] every tree of the garden, thou mayest
[1:01:33] freely eat, but of the tree of knowledge
[1:01:36] of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of
[1:01:37] it, for in the day that thou eatest
[1:01:39] thereof, thou shalt surely die."
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; So, what was it that Satan was trying to
[1:01:44] cause confusion on? The promise.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; And he presented it in a way, and I'm
[1:01:49] not sure if we're going to get into this
[1:01:50] in greater detail later, so I'll just
[1:01:52] kind of say it now. You notice in the
[1:01:54] language he used with the woman, he
[1:01:55] says, "But God knows the day you eat,
[1:01:58] you'll become godlike." So, it was
[1:02:00] painting this picture of God as being
[1:02:02] selfish.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Maybe this picture of God of being
[1:02:04] vindictive and being inequitable and
[1:02:07] that God could have given you more, but
[1:02:09] he didn't. Or he withheld this and you
[1:02:11] can't really trust him. And so, it's all
[1:02:13] for the means of painting a picture of
[1:02:15] God that could just give enough room for
[1:02:17] you to say, "Wait a minute. Why has he
[1:02:19] withheld this from us?"
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when God says when he
[1:02:23] commanded the man that of every tree you
[1:02:26] can freely eat, we could say in some
[1:02:27] ways that's God commanding freedom. But
[1:02:30] of the tree of knowledge and good and
[1:02:31] evil, you can't eat of that or you'll
[1:02:33] die. You could see that then there's
[1:02:35] some restriction. But notice and just
[1:02:37] how I have it summarized on some of
[1:02:39] these slides that when God said you
[1:02:41] could eat of all this and that commanded
[1:02:43] freedom, it was that prohibition that
[1:02:46] secures their freedom.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; What freedom would it be? you can do
[1:02:49] whatever you want, but whatever you do,
[1:02:51] don't jump off this cliff or you won't
[1:02:53] be able to do whatever you want anymore.
[1:02:55] Right? It's going to say, "Hey, you can
[1:02:57] do this, but if you if you violate this,
[1:03:00] then you're going to lose that privilege
[1:03:01] because it results in death." So, when
[1:03:04] he says you may freely eat, he commands
[1:03:06] freedom.
[1:03:08] And as free moral agents, they were they
[1:03:10] they could enjoy this liberty to what?
[1:03:12] Be fruitful, multiply, replenish the
[1:03:15] earth, have dominion. These were things
[1:03:17] that they were as free moral agents
[1:03:19] allowed to enjoy freely.
[1:03:22] But when he says, "Thou shalt not eat of
[1:03:25] the tree of knowledge of good and evil."
[1:03:28] But let's just think, I want to say
[1:03:30] deeply, but just really use our uh uh
[1:03:32] God-given minds and really wrestle with
[1:03:34] this. When he says you cannot eat,
[1:03:37] freedom required a restrictive
[1:03:40] commandment.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? This is something a lot of
[1:03:42] times we don't understand that when we
[1:03:44] we say, "Oh, liberty, liberty, liberty,
[1:03:46] liberty just means we can do whatever we
[1:03:47] want." Well,
[1:03:49] right. Actually, one of the biggest lies
[1:03:51] I think that's perpetuated anymore is,
[1:03:53] "Well, where the spirit of the Lord,
[1:03:55] there's liberty."
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; And what they mean, I can blame the
[1:03:59] spirit for whatever I do in this church
[1:04:01] service.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; I can blame the spirit for however I
[1:04:05] act, whatever I do, because where the
[1:04:07] spirit of the Lord, there's liberty. And
[1:04:09] it it's just a complete twisting and
[1:04:10] perverting of the scripture.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; When Paul says where the spirit of the
[1:04:13] Lord and there is liberty, he means
[1:04:14] where the spirit of the Lord is, there's
[1:04:16] now liberty to become Christlike.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; We couldn't do it under the law. We
[1:04:20] couldn't do it by our first nature. But
[1:04:22] where the spirit of the Lord is, there's
[1:04:24] liberty to become like Christ.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Not just act out however you want,
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; right? Because we see people who are
[1:04:31] filled with the Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit,
[1:04:32] however you want to argue it out. People
[1:04:34] are genuinely filled with the Holy
[1:04:36] Spirit and they act one way and another
[1:04:39] person acts another but neither by that
[1:04:41] spirit will violate God's word.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; And so freedom required a restrictive
[1:04:46] commandment.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; There must be boundaries or if we say
[1:04:50] limits in order to have true freedom.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; This is even something that's
[1:04:54] established in the freest countries in
[1:04:55] the world. A positive liberty requires
[1:04:57] negative liberty.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Don't we do we not have the freedom of
[1:05:01] speech? But what makes that freedom of
[1:05:04] speech special that it never infringes
[1:05:06] upon somebody else's liberties.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; That's what makes it that's what makes
[1:05:11] it freedom.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And here when he said the God gave a
[1:05:16] commandment, this freedom came by
[1:05:18] accepting and honoring God's boundary.
[1:05:22] And when mankind mankind lost their
[1:05:24] freedom when they violated this
[1:05:26] boundary.
[1:05:28] And one uh one way to think about this,
[1:05:30] I think this is just a uh I think we
[1:05:32] ought to think this about it this way
[1:05:34] because the spirit of God has made us
[1:05:35] free from the law of sin and death. So
[1:05:38] our liberty and our freedom just as it
[1:05:40] was for them, their freedom was the
[1:05:42] natural ability to not sin.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; They were not born with the natural
[1:05:48] ability to sin.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; That wasn't first instinct.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; They had to be seduced into it.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; And we can say, well, the devil seduced
[1:05:55] me to sin. You start thinking about,
[1:05:56] well, not really. I just kind of did
[1:05:58] that, didn't I?
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Didn't even need much proddding.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; You didn't have to be taught it. Didn't
[1:06:02] even have to learn it. We just are born
[1:06:04] with it innately.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; That's just something we do
[1:06:08] instinctively. On the at the men's
[1:06:10] meeting on Saturday, we were looking at
[1:06:11] the example of Balum and how that God
[1:06:14] told Balam, he said, "Hey, whatever you
[1:06:15] do, don't curse Israel." And so when
[1:06:17] Balam went back to Bao, he said, "Ah,
[1:06:19] God told me I can't go with you." But
[1:06:21] what did he not tell him? I can't curse
[1:06:23] Israel.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; So he goes back and he seeks the Lord
[1:06:26] again. And God and the Lord said, "If
[1:06:28] they come and bid you, go with them." So
[1:06:32] what's the first thing Balam does the
[1:06:34] next morning?
[1:06:35] Saddles his ass and goes to him.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Doesn't wait. Why? It's just
[1:06:39] instinctive. He didn't have to be
[1:06:40] seduced into it. It was own. The Bible
[1:06:42] says the own greed that worked with him,
[1:06:44] his own love for wages caused him to get
[1:06:48] up in the morning, not wait for them to
[1:06:49] come and seduce him. He deceived himself
[1:06:52] and he was seduced into going. And it's
[1:06:54] in there. God said, "Your way is
[1:06:55] perverse before me."
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; So freedom, the real freedom is this
[1:07:01] natural ability not to sin. And in this
[1:07:05] after the fall, we've lost that freedom.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; That's the liberty we've lost. We're
[1:07:09] born into the world and we come
[1:07:11] estranged from God speaking lies because
[1:07:14] we do not have a natural ability to
[1:07:17] refrain from sin.
[1:07:19] Romans 7:14 says, "For we know that the
[1:07:22] law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold
[1:07:25] under sin."
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; How was it this stain was passed onto
[1:07:29] mankind?
[1:07:34] Satan was able to break trust by
[1:07:36] mischaracterizing God.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; As soon as he was able to
[1:07:39] mischaracterize God, doubt could arise.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Just just give a a little bit of room in
[1:07:44] her mind in that state was allowed to
[1:07:47] doubt God. And the woman separated
[1:07:49] herself from God.
[1:07:52] And the act that she engaged in was a
[1:07:54] part of this deliberate dissociation
[1:07:56] from God.
[1:07:59] So if we could define sin and distill it
[1:08:03] down, and I draw this from the message
[1:08:05] of the hour, there if I'm not using I
[1:08:08] would hope that to a church this mature
[1:08:09] that if I never used quotes overtly,
[1:08:13] you would leave saying, "Man, all he did
[1:08:15] was quote brother Brandon. just didn't
[1:08:16] give attribution. Well, I do that for
[1:08:18] time sake
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; because every single thing we're reading
[1:08:21] here, it's coming. The Bible was coming
[1:08:23] from the message.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; That's what we get when the message is
[1:08:26] speaking. The Bible's coming from it.
[1:08:27] And so, we can we can bring these things
[1:08:29] right back to the Bible. And so, Brother
[1:08:30] Bam said sin is unbelief.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; We can prove that absolutely by
[1:08:35] scripture. So, generally sin can be
[1:08:37] described in one way as a violation, any
[1:08:39] violation of God's word, by act, uh by
[1:08:42] omission.
[1:08:44] says in 1 John 3:4, "Whosoever committh
[1:08:47] sin transgresseth also the law, for sin
[1:08:50] is the transgression of the law." The
[1:08:53] word there sin means to miss the mark.
[1:08:55] That's what sin means,
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; To simply miss the remark or excuse me,
[1:08:59] to miss the mark. So sin is a rejection,
[1:09:02] a rebellion against God's commandment or
[1:09:05] God's truth.
[1:09:07] In Genesis 3:11, we see this mirrored in
[1:09:09] the fall. He said, "Who told thee that
[1:09:12] thou was naked?" God said, "Hast thou
[1:09:15] eaten of the tree? Where have I
[1:09:17] commanded thee that thou shouldest not
[1:09:19] eat?" Now, when you read this, we we we
[1:09:21] shouldn't think, "Oh, man. God is so
[1:09:23] clever to know, so astute, such a good
[1:09:25] detective to immediately begin to try to
[1:09:27] follow the breadcrumbs." He knew what
[1:09:28] happened.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. But thank God he's not just
[1:09:31] judging them outright, but he's speaking
[1:09:32] aloud and it's allowing us to recognize
[1:09:35] that their nakedness was directly a
[1:09:37] result of disobeying the commandment
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; to not eat of that tree.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; So the act that she engaged in was the
[1:09:45] fruit of this blatant disregard for
[1:09:48] God's commandment.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Yay. God hath said, "You shall not eat."
[1:09:54] In that way, it seems as if the serpent
[1:09:56] has said God did say it's this
[1:09:58] transcendent distant God said you should
[1:10:00] cannot eat of any of this fruit of the
[1:10:02] tree of the garden. But this one who
[1:10:05] said that said it because he knew when
[1:10:08] you did you would become more godlike.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; So he said you won't surely die. There
[1:10:14] was only one way for her to find herself
[1:10:16] to be naked. That was to disregard God's
[1:10:19] word.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; As rebellion against truth.
[1:10:23] 1st Samuel 15:es 22- 24 and Samuel said
[1:10:28] hath the Lord is great delight in burnt
[1:10:30] offerings and sacrifices as in obeying
[1:10:32] the voice of the Lord.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:10:37] and to hearken than the fat of rams.
[1:10:40] Yeah,
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; this is something really hard to get
[1:10:42] into our human minds because a lot of
[1:10:43] times it's that the overt praise or the
[1:10:46] optics of worship or anything that I can
[1:10:47] do externally that not only does that
[1:10:50] impress everybody else, but it impresses
[1:10:51] us. But really what God wants is he
[1:10:54] wants obedience.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Doesn't want pretense. He doesn't want
[1:10:57] politics. He doesn't want personality.
[1:10:59] He he doesn't want the things that
[1:11:01] present outwardly. But he says that
[1:11:03] rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft
[1:11:06] and stubbornness is as iniquity is as
[1:11:08] iniquity and idolatry
[1:11:11] because thou hast rejected the word of
[1:11:13] the Lord. He hath also rejected thee
[1:11:15] from being king. And Saul said unto
[1:11:18] Samuel, I have sinned for I have
[1:11:20] transgressed the commandment of the Lord
[1:11:22] and thy words because I feared the
[1:11:24] people and obeyed their voice. There's
[1:11:26] some honesty on Saul's part. There's his
[1:11:28] sin of pride where he was he was afraid
[1:11:31] of the people. So he sinned, he
[1:11:32] disobeyed. But Saul's never quite cured
[1:11:34] of that because immediately he says,
[1:11:36] "But let's forget about that. Worship
[1:11:38] with me publicly." So everybody knows
[1:11:40] we're still tight. So Saul's not
[1:11:42] absolved here. But he says, "I have
[1:11:44] transgressed." And Samuel said, "You've
[1:11:47] rejected the word." He says, "I've
[1:11:49] transgressed." That Hebrew word is in
[1:11:50] the sense of missing the target. I've
[1:11:52] deviated from a right way. I've missed
[1:11:54] the goal. So sin is rebellion or
[1:11:58] defiance against God.
[1:12:02] That pesha there is trespass, rebellion
[1:12:04] or revolt. The Avon is transgression or
[1:12:09] something that's twisted or crooked. God
[1:12:11] is straight. The path is straight. But
[1:12:13] then when we just twist it or make it
[1:12:14] crooked just a little bit. I've
[1:12:16] deviated. That's what sin is. To deviate
[1:12:19] from God's word.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Joseph recognized it in Genesis 39:9.
[1:12:25] There's none greater in this house than
[1:12:26] I. Neither hath he kept back anything
[1:12:29] from me but they Joseph to Piper's wife.
[1:12:31] He's acknowledging the goodness of his
[1:12:34] master towards him and what those
[1:12:35] boundaries were appropriately within
[1:12:37] those relationships. He says because
[1:12:39] thou art his wife. How then can I do
[1:12:41] this great wickedness and sin against
[1:12:44] God? This wasn't man's moral law. This
[1:12:47] wasn't, well, I can't do this to my
[1:12:49] employer and this wouldn't be right in
[1:12:51] the eyes of man. He knew that to
[1:12:53] transgress would be an offense to God.
[1:12:56] Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; That there's a there's an integrity.
[1:12:58] There's an uprightness. There's an
[1:13:00] expectation that God has. There's a way
[1:13:02] which is called holiness. There's
[1:13:03] righteousness. There's virtue. There's
[1:13:05] purity. And there's a way that I can act
[1:13:07] that's contrary to that. And so sin
[1:13:10] would be a violation of God's word.
[1:13:12] Anything that's against the character of
[1:13:13] God.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; To actually avoid the appearance of evil
[1:13:17] is to not express anything that mars the
[1:13:21] image of Christ in flesh.
[1:13:26] Psalms 51:4 David recognized against
[1:13:29] thee, thee only have I sinned and done
[1:13:32] this evil in thy sight, that thou
[1:13:34] mightest be justified when thou speakest
[1:13:36] and be clear when thou judges. Sin is
[1:13:38] not measured by our uh uh our revolt,
[1:13:43] our you know, our blush against it. Sin
[1:13:45] is not measured by whether or not
[1:13:47] there's some uh revulsion on our on our
[1:13:50] part.
[1:13:52] Sin is transgression against God. James
[1:13:56] 4:1 17, therefore to him that knoweth to
[1:13:58] do good and to doeth it not, to him it
[1:14:00] is sin.
[1:14:02] Why? To know to do good and not do it is
[1:14:05] a lack of respect.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; It's an attitude of indifference,
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; whether it be of apathy or lukewarmness
[1:14:13] or just outright rejection. To know to
[1:14:15] do right, to know to do good, to know to
[1:14:17] observe the word of God and to not do
[1:14:19] it. to you it is sin. What is sin? It's
[1:14:22] rebellion.
[1:14:24] It's a lack of respect. It's even overt
[1:14:27] or it's just this indifference. Well, it
[1:14:29] doesn't really matter. If it really
[1:14:30] mattered to God this and say, well, if
[1:14:33] it really mattered to God, it's in his
[1:14:34] word. And the word covers quite a bit,
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; So perhaps it is sometimes just that
[1:14:40] indifference or lukewarmness. But in
[1:14:42] Revelations 3:es 15 and 16, it says, "I
[1:14:45] know thy works that thou art neither
[1:14:46] cold nor hot.
[1:14:49] I would that thou art cold or hot. So
[1:14:51] then, because thou art lukewarm, and
[1:14:54] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[1:14:56] out of my mouth.
[1:14:59] It's that lukewarmness God hates.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; To be apathetic, to be indifferent.
[1:15:06] That's it's it's not a matter of just
[1:15:08] kind of trying to find this this pocket
[1:15:10] safely where I I don't want to do
[1:15:12] anything wrong. And since I'm afraid to
[1:15:14] do anything wrong, I won't try to do
[1:15:15] anything right. I'm just going to sit
[1:15:16] here and not do anything at all. That's
[1:15:17] not going to work.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Because sin at its root is unbelief.
[1:15:24] It's a corruption of It's a corruption
[1:15:26] of faith in God and his character.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; What worked on the woman, what Peter was
[1:15:32] experiencing in that moment of denial.
[1:15:34] Sin at its core is unbelief. It's some
[1:15:37] disbelief in God and his character. Be
[1:15:40] maybe our just some of our final
[1:15:41] principles we want to lay out before we
[1:15:43] read some statements uh from the
[1:15:45] message. says, so in 1 John 5 16 and 17.
[1:15:50] If any man see his brother sin is sin
[1:15:53] which is not unto death, he shall ask
[1:15:56] and he shall give him life for them that
[1:15:58] sin not unto death. There is a sin unto
[1:16:02] death. I do not say that he shall not
[1:16:04] pray for it. All unrighteousness is sin
[1:16:08] and there is a sin not unto death. But
[1:16:11] what is a sin unto death? I know we'd
[1:16:13] like to know those categories, right?
[1:16:15] There's uh right now I'm trying to make
[1:16:17] sure I eat clean and I'm wanting to get
[1:16:19] healthy at 50 years old. I want to live
[1:16:21] long enough to see all my kids grow up.
[1:16:23] And so there's there's vegetables that
[1:16:26] are on the okay list. There's vegetables
[1:16:30] on the limited list and then there's bad
[1:16:32] vegetables. No, no, no. Don't eat.
[1:16:34] Right?
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; And so here we find that maybe well sin
[1:16:37] does it have these this is okay and this
[1:16:39] is not okay and and this is unto death.
[1:16:42] And so it seems as if it's kind of
[1:16:44] categorizing things, but there's a lot
[1:16:46] here to to expand upon. I don't want to
[1:16:48] get caught up in that. But I do want to
[1:16:50] identify there is a sin unto death. And
[1:16:53] unbelief is that sin unto death.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Because it is the original sin from
[1:16:59] which all disobedience is born.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; The original sin was to what? Distrust,
[1:17:03] disbelief. It was to accept a lie. It
[1:17:06] was to no longer have confidence in God.
[1:17:08] It was to uh through seduction walk
[1:17:11] across God's boundary. So the sin and
[1:17:13] death is to disbelieve.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; That is right.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Is it's that unbelief from which all sin
[1:17:18] arises. And we understand the the the
[1:17:21] principle that these there's many things
[1:17:22] we could say are the attributes of sin.
[1:17:25] But sin at its core is unbelief.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; John 16 7 to9 he just says it very
[1:17:32] plainly. Nevertheless, I will tell you
[1:17:34] the truth. It is expedient for you that
[1:17:36] I go away. For if I go not away, the
[1:17:38] comforter will not come unto you. But if
[1:17:39] I depart, I will send him unto you. And
[1:17:42] when he has come, he will reprove the
[1:17:44] world of sin and of righteousness and of
[1:17:48] judgment. And why will he reprove the
[1:17:50] world of sin? Verse n of sin because
[1:17:53] they believe not on me. Here explicitly
[1:17:58] unbelief is called sin by Jesus Christ.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; because unbelief is the root. It's the
[1:18:03] sap. It's the chief power of all sin.
[1:18:06] Want to know why we make mistake? We
[1:18:08] make a mistake. Unbelief's in there
[1:18:09] somewhere.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; It's the root of it. It's the lifegiving
[1:18:13] power of sin. Unbelief is actually the
[1:18:17] head of the serpent that Christ came to
[1:18:18] crush.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; John 3:36, he that believeth on the Son
[1:18:23] hath everlasting life, and he that
[1:18:25] believeth not the Son shall not see
[1:18:27] life, but the wrath of God abideth on on
[1:18:29] him. What's the only distinguishing
[1:18:31] characteristic? Belief versus unbelief.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Where there's unbelief, the wrath of God
[1:18:36] abides on that one. Where there is
[1:18:38] belief, there is everlasting life. The
[1:18:40] wages of sin is death. John 3:36 tells
[1:18:42] us, "The wages of unbelief is death."
[1:18:45] It's they're one and the same.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; But the gift of God is eternal life
[1:18:48] through Jesus Christ. By faith, you're
[1:18:50] saved, not of works.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; He that believes on the Son of God,
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; has everlasting life,
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; but he that disbelieves is subject to
[1:19:02] wrath. John 8:24, I said therefore unto
[1:19:05] you the that ye shall die in your sins.
[1:19:08] Well, why? For if you believe not that I
[1:19:10] am he, ye shall die in your sins. Other
[1:19:12] words, you cannot disbelieve and be
[1:19:14] delivered.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; The only thing that'll keep you in sin,
[1:19:18] the only thing that'll keep you in the
[1:19:20] grave, the only thing that'll keep you
[1:19:22] subject to the second death and the
[1:19:24] dread of standing before white throne
[1:19:26] judgment is unbelief.
[1:19:30] Hebrews chapter 3 12-13. Take heed
[1:19:33] brethren, lest there be in any of you an
[1:19:35] evil heart of unbelief in departing from
[1:19:38] the living God.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; That's what causes us to depart. But
[1:19:42] exhort one another daily why it is
[1:19:44] called today, lest any of you be
[1:19:46] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[1:19:49] sin,
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; the delusion of unbelief,
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; the seduction of faith faithlessness.
[1:19:56] There's a delusion to it.
[1:20:00] Hebrews chapter 3 17 to19.
[1:20:04] But with whom was he grieved 40 years?
[1:20:08] Was it not with them that had sinned?
[1:20:09] Whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
[1:20:11] Okay, we know that he was disbelie
[1:20:14] disappointed in those that sinned. Well,
[1:20:16] what did it mean to sin? And to whom
[1:20:18] swear he that they should not enter into
[1:20:20] his rest, but to them that believed not.
[1:20:23] So we see that they could not enter in
[1:20:26] because of unbelief.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; The Bible's very clear on this.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; It wasn't that they fell in the
[1:20:34] wilderness because of these very
[1:20:35] specific acts that they may have
[1:20:37] committed. But God just shows us that
[1:20:39] all these things were done because they
[1:20:41] didn't believe.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; What is sin? Sin is disbelief.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; What was their sin? They didn't trust
[1:20:48] God.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Sin is a lack of trusting God.
[1:20:53] Now, that might make it a little bit
[1:20:54] more personal
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; because I found I just testify myself
[1:20:59] that my biggest problem in life that God
[1:21:01] has constantly been trying to teach me
[1:21:03] is to trust him.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; I I look back on my my entire walk and
[1:21:08] everything that I've ever gone through
[1:21:09] and every mistake I've made and how I've
[1:21:11] responded to challenges, at the end of
[1:21:13] the day, I could say, "I just didn't
[1:21:14] trust him enough.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; I worried about this. I tried to control
[1:21:17] that. I didn't trust him." them. And all
[1:21:19] through everything we're going through,
[1:21:21] he's teaching us to trust.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Not to the point to where we say, "Well,
[1:21:24] God, I don't need your help. I can just
[1:21:26] keep going. I can do this all alone."
[1:21:27] No, no, no. He's wanting to teach us
[1:21:29] that we can trust him.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; That we can believe him. To understand
[1:21:33] that he does have our best in mind. That
[1:21:35] he does have thoughts for us to bring us
[1:21:37] to an expected end. That we don't need
[1:21:38] to fret. We don't need to worry even
[1:21:40] when everything is seemingly falling
[1:21:42] apart. Everything I've tried to do, my
[1:21:43] marriage, this, that, and everything.
[1:21:45] Just say, "God, I don't know how, but
[1:21:47] somewhere in this there is good because
[1:21:49] you promised me that all things work
[1:21:50] together for good." What is he doing?
[1:21:52] Teaching us to trust.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; And where Satan can just nudge us just a
[1:21:56] little bit to get us off center from
[1:21:58] trust, that's when the attributes of
[1:22:00] unbelief begin to manifest. Sin is
[1:22:03] unbelief. Sin is mistrust.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; There's even a way to define faith is
[1:22:09] faith is a deliberate confidence in a
[1:22:11] God whose ways we may not understand.
[1:22:14] Amen.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; But yeah, we'll deliberately trust. I
[1:22:16] don't understand what you're doing, but
[1:22:18] I'm going to trust you anyhow.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 13 verse 22. Anybody who's
[1:22:24] familiar maybe with maybe I don't know,
[1:22:27] maybe this could be a cause for concern
[1:22:28] if he's just now getting to his text,
[1:22:30] but you'll probably this probably be a
[1:22:32] signal. I'm probably coming to my end
[1:22:34] here of my sermon. Not forecasting the
[1:22:37] end of life. I'm coming to the end of my
[1:22:38] sermon.
[1:22:40] Mark 13:22. For false Christ and false
[1:22:43] prophets shall rise.
[1:22:46] So much is intended in that verse.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; False Christ, false prophet shall rise
[1:22:51] and shall show signs and wonders to
[1:22:54] seduce,
[1:22:56] if it were possible, even the elect.
[1:22:59] Seduction.
[1:23:02] How
[1:23:03] it's remarkable that when Christ would
[1:23:05] warn us of the end time
[1:23:08] and he would say be careful because in
[1:23:10] the end false prophets shall rise he
[1:23:13] doesn't say demonic dogs or demonic
[1:23:17] disciples or you know witches I mean
[1:23:20] that would have made more sense right
[1:23:21] witches and dragons will rise in the
[1:23:23] last day but he just says false Christs
[1:23:26] false prophets what makes them false
[1:23:29] they're claiming to speak on behalf of
[1:23:31] God what makes them false Christ
[1:23:34] anointed falsely because of seed I mean
[1:23:38] this when we run understand what
[1:23:40] anointed ones at the end time are this
[1:23:42] is a very humbling scripture very
[1:23:45] staggering scripture and they'll
[1:23:46] actually show signs and wonders
[1:23:50] and this is then attributing to them a
[1:23:53] means by which our minds may be captured
[1:23:56] by something beyond ourselves something
[1:23:58] supernatural and it's all done sedu to
[1:24:02] seduce God's elect
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; and we can be grateful we can thank God
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; that it's impossible to seduce us
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; but it doesn't change his efforts
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; doesn't change his program what he does
[1:24:15] is Satan seduces
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; this is a lengthy statement but I
[1:24:19] believe it bears uh an appropriate place
[1:24:22] here to share with you when brother
[1:24:24] Baron preaches God hiding himself in
[1:24:25] simplicity there in April just after the
[1:24:28] seals were opened he says it's Just like
[1:24:30] an army going to fight, we got spies in
[1:24:33] England. England has got spies here. The
[1:24:36] spies are in and out around the world.
[1:24:38] They're searching out our military
[1:24:40] secrets. When we find some kind of a
[1:24:43] military secret, as soon as they can
[1:24:45] find it, they take the same thing or
[1:24:46] something to combat it. It's a warfare.
[1:24:49] It's kind of that espionage where it's
[1:24:51] like, well, we found out that they've
[1:24:52] got this weapon or this technology and
[1:24:54] they come up with ways to counteract it.
[1:24:56] And it's uh you know it's fascinating if
[1:24:58] you drill down to the details of those
[1:25:00] things of the espionage and the spying
[1:25:01] and all the games that are played. saw
[1:25:04] an instance of it not too far long ago
[1:25:07] where uh Israeli intelligence had bought
[1:25:11] a contract or bought a provider of
[1:25:13] digital services and makers of these
[1:25:16] pagers that were sold into Syria I
[1:25:18] believe it was or Lebanon and they
[1:25:20] waited years but at the right moment
[1:25:22] they were programmed to blow up
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; and that's espionage that's that's
[1:25:26] warfare that's spying and he says the
[1:25:29] greatest warfare is a spiritual warfare
[1:25:33] when God knew it was going to come to
[1:25:34] pass. He did for his children just like
[1:25:37] the United States does for their army.
[1:25:39] He gave a man a helmet to wear because
[1:25:41] he knew he was going to use it. He gave
[1:25:43] him a spade to dig it with. We know it's
[1:25:45] going to be We know it's a big pound
[1:25:47] about 90 lb pack on his back. Some
[1:25:49] little rookie packing it. He certainly
[1:25:50] is a hard thing for him. But the army
[1:25:52] knows they've got to train him for that
[1:25:54] because he's going to need it.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Every piece of equipment he's going to
[1:25:58] need need it when he hits the
[1:26:00] battlefront.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Right. And that's what we ought to do
[1:26:03] today, friend. We got to take the whole
[1:26:07] word of God because we're going to need
[1:26:08] it.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; We got to use every word that's in
[1:26:12] there.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; And that's that's good. It's every word
[1:26:16] that's in there. It's thus sayaith the
[1:26:18] Lord. And we've got to use the full
[1:26:19] gospel.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; When God had fortified his church, he
[1:26:22] fortified it with the best thing that he
[1:26:24] could find because it's his own
[1:26:25] children.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And he fortified the church by the word,
[1:26:29] his own word. just ask them to believe
[1:26:32] his word. That's all there was. He
[1:26:35] doesn't ask you to impersonate it,
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; He doesn't ask you to try to manifest
[1:26:38] it.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; He gives enough to foreshadow it, to
[1:26:41] express it, to tell you what it's to do.
[1:26:44] And then we ask that the the life of
[1:26:46] that word to express itself in us.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; And the only way we can allow it to do
[1:26:50] that, the first and initial part is to
[1:26:52] believe the word. Amen.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Now he says, "And Satan by his wisdom
[1:26:58] caused Eve to break down that barrier
[1:27:00] just in one place." Satan admitted every
[1:27:04] part of the word was right. "But surely
[1:27:06] you won't die. That's all he had to
[1:27:08] know." Now, that was the loophole.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; You listening? The loophole. He got Eve
[1:27:14] from behind the word with one little
[1:27:18] doubt. What Satan's going to try. This
[1:27:20] is how we're seduced to sin. Just find
[1:27:22] the little loophole.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; That's exactly where he gets the church
[1:27:26] today. The same thing. Just one little
[1:27:29] doubt brings you on this side.
[1:27:33] And now there's no way to ever try to
[1:27:35] think that God would spare you through
[1:27:37] belonging to a church, belonging to an
[1:27:39] organization or a group or whatever it
[1:27:41] is or any sensation.
[1:27:43] A lot of sensationalism anymore.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Right. There's Listen, one thing we can
[1:27:47] know for sure that if it's a church age
[1:27:49] spirit, it's going to cycle
[1:27:51] because that's what a church age spirit
[1:27:53] is. It's a cycle of revival and death.
[1:27:55] Try one thing, when it dies, try
[1:27:56] another. Try when the spirit kind of
[1:27:58] peters out, go to another. Always trying
[1:28:00] to keep the people's attention. Church
[1:28:01] ages are indicated by cycles of revival
[1:28:04] and death. And so it tends to swing from
[1:28:07] intellectualism to emotionalism,
[1:28:09] intellectualism to emotional. just a
[1:28:11] constant cycle
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; or any sensation. He says you've got to
[1:28:16] believe his word and act upon the same.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; That's the only way. That's God's
[1:28:22] program at the beginning. That's God's
[1:28:24] program down through the life. What is
[1:28:26] it? You've got to believe his word
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; and act upon the same. That's God's
[1:28:32] program at the beginning. That's God's
[1:28:34] program down through the life. That's
[1:28:36] God's program now. The church must stay
[1:28:40] behind the word. That's the only way
[1:28:42] that he or that you can be safe.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Listen, I say this as we close. The
[1:28:48] musicians could come to their
[1:28:50] instruments. The only place you're safe
[1:28:52] is behind the word.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; And Satan on in daily life, everyday
[1:28:56] life, is going to try to seduce you
[1:28:57] outside of that protection.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; And we could think, well, he's going to
[1:29:01] get he's going to try to draw me out.
[1:29:03] But what was it when Brother Bam said,
[1:29:05] "If he can just get you to disbelieve
[1:29:06] your weapon, Right?
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Disbelief is powerful enough.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; So you just look at it and just enough
[1:29:12] time to let the shield down, take the
[1:29:15] ham helmet off and start examining it to
[1:29:17] not believe. Sin is that distrust.
[1:29:21] That moment where you you're not
[1:29:22] trusting God. That moment where you
[1:29:24] begin to say, "Well, I I don't know if
[1:29:25] his word is true. I don't know if this
[1:29:26] promises for me. I don't know if he'll
[1:29:28] do this for me. I' i've made this
[1:29:29] mistake. I've done that. Maybe it's too
[1:29:31] late." And that's all it takes for the
[1:29:32] loophole
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; to show its show its way. Right?
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Stay behind the word. That's the only
[1:29:38] way that you can be safe.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; That's what Satan is going to do. That's
[1:29:43] his tactic. He says,
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Satan caused Eve to break down that
[1:29:47] barrier just in one place. He made her
[1:29:49] do it.
[1:29:51] And in the conflict between God and
[1:29:53] Satan, brother Bam says it this way.
[1:29:55] Just if you could just begin to think
[1:29:56] prayerfully now. He says, "Now Satan in
[1:29:58] this time set up the same system that he
[1:30:01] did in the Garden of Eden, reasoning
[1:30:04] against the word of these prophets."
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "Satan set him up a system."
[1:30:11] He asked the question, "What was it to
[1:30:14] combat the word of the Lord that came to
[1:30:15] the prophets?"
[1:30:17] He uses that same old tactic every time.
[1:30:22] God stays with his same the word.
[1:30:26] What the devil's going to try to do is
[1:30:27] attack the word. Attack the word.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Say, well, can't really destroy the
[1:30:33] word. The word's eternal. So, where does
[1:30:36] it where does the word where how can the
[1:30:39] word then lose its effect is if we just
[1:30:41] slightly doubt.
[1:30:44] That creates the loophole. Satan's
[1:30:47] system is reasoning against the word to
[1:30:51] combat the word and it's his tactic. But
[1:30:54] God stays the same, the word. How can we
[1:30:58] be seduced to sin? Just disbelief.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; How is it that we continue in patterns
[1:31:04] of uh behavior that are displeasing,
[1:31:06] that are destructive, a lack of trust?
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Maybe we don't want to trust them. Maybe
[1:31:10] we want to have an excuse to stay the
[1:31:12] way we are. Maybe we like the pretense
[1:31:13] of things. Maybe we've gotten so good at
[1:31:16] c quieting that voice of God that speaks
[1:31:18] to us and say, you know, this isn't
[1:31:20] right. You know, this isn't right. That
[1:31:22] tonight is the night to shake ourselves,
[1:31:23] to recognize we're being lulled to
[1:31:25] sleep.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; We're being seduced to sin. Let's stand
[1:31:28] together. Let's pray together. It's
[1:31:32] these nights can get late very quickly,
[1:31:34] almost 9:00. But we do want to pray for
[1:31:36] you that God would just
[1:31:39] help us in our hearts as we consider
[1:31:40] these things.
[1:31:42] Say, 'Lord, maybe that could be your
[1:31:44] prayer. If you want to just raise your
[1:31:46] hand, say, ' Lord, I don't want to fall
[1:31:48] for one of Satan's loopholes. I don't
[1:31:50] want to be taking the loophole.
[1:31:52] If you're a tax attorney or an
[1:31:54] accountant, you try to find loopholes
[1:31:55] for your client's sake. Don't let the
[1:31:56] devil advocate for a loophole.
[1:31:59] God's closed all the loopholes. If
[1:32:01] Satan's trying to show you one, it's a
[1:32:03] path to death and destruction. Our
[1:32:05] gracious heavenly father, tonight as we
[1:32:07] close this service in prayer, just this
[1:32:08] portion and turn it over to the pastor,
[1:32:12] though there may have been some levity,
[1:32:15] no doubt some swiftness to the delivery
[1:32:18] tonight, it's a very simple thought
[1:32:22] that sin is unbelief
[1:32:26] and that it's not as overt and obvious
[1:32:28] sometimes as we think it is, but it's
[1:32:30] seduction.
[1:32:32] And at its core, what the devil is
[1:32:34] trying to do is just create a little bit
[1:32:36] of a loophole where we find our own
[1:32:39] reason to not trust God.
[1:32:42] And I pray, Lord, that if anything could
[1:32:44] happen tonight, we just button up those
[1:32:45] areas where there's slack.
[1:32:48] Really challenge ourselves at our core
[1:32:49] to say, "Am I taking God at his word? Am
[1:32:51] I believing his word?
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Am I willing to walk behind that word?
[1:32:55] Am I willing to embrace it?"
[1:32:57] Lord, the devil bluffs us and
[1:32:59] intimidates us and tries to get us to
[1:33:00] deny comm affiliation to your word or to
[1:33:05] deny any kind of relationship or
[1:33:07] commitment.
[1:33:09] The devil still yet tries to create an
[1:33:11] impersonal God who's far away who's not
[1:33:13] interested all for the sake of allowing
[1:33:17] us to follow after our own lust.
[1:33:20] I pray that you would heal us of this
[1:33:22] disease of unbelief.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; That Lord, wherever we're weak,
[1:33:27] strengthen us as that one cried out,
[1:33:28] Lord, I believe. Help thou my unbelief.
[1:33:30] What a what a testimony to say, Lord, I
[1:33:32] I do trust you, but maybe not fully. I
[1:33:35] do believe you, but there's areas where
[1:33:36] I'm weak, and I believe there's victory
[1:33:38] tonight in acknowledging I can do
[1:33:40] better. Lord, forgive me. I've sinned
[1:33:42] and I've sinned against you. I haven't
[1:33:44] trusted you like I should.
[1:33:47] Lord, I know there's still maybe a lot
[1:33:49] to be desired in this. And if you give
[1:33:51] Liberty, we could follow up on it next
[1:33:53] Wednesday, but I trust that tonight
[1:33:54] could be fruitful in the hearts of the
[1:33:56] believers. Something to think about as
[1:33:57] they go. We commit them to you in the
[1:33:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you. We love you. Happy to be
[1:34:05] here, brother John.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; We appreciated that word.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:14] the way that it was so presented that we
[1:34:16] could precisely see the enemy at the
[1:34:20] very root of our sins at the very
[1:34:24] beginning.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; But you know, we are not all real keen
[1:34:28] when we slip and fall.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; It's usually we're recognizing it after.
[1:34:35] But here's the the beautiful thing about
[1:34:37] grace.
[1:34:39] Grace is as soon as you recognize it,
[1:34:41] get back,
[1:34:43] right? Get back. Don't stay there.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; And I believe that God has given us all
[1:34:51] that opportunity so we don't have to
[1:34:54] maybe
[1:34:55] I know we've been admonished today to
[1:34:58] pay attention to the devil when he
[1:34:59] comes, but what I'm saying is if you
[1:35:02] miss that and you find that you fall,
[1:35:05] quickly get back up and say, "Lord, I'm
[1:35:07] sorry. help me to be more aware, more
[1:35:09] keen
[1:35:11] uh for next time. And I believe that
[1:35:14] that that is the elect. The elect is
[1:35:16] going to be moving in that direction. I
[1:35:19] appreciated that message very very much.
[1:35:22] Thinking about trust. Job said, "Though
[1:35:25] he slay me, yet I trust him." And that's
[1:35:28] our end. We just have to we have to
[1:35:30] trust the Lord.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. I've got a revelation.
[1:35:42] Just
[1:35:44] take a moment. Just water the word. I've
[1:35:47] got a revelation
[1:35:51] of predestination.
[1:35:55] I've got a revelation.
[1:35:59] God is my father.
[1:36:04] Know where
[1:36:06] I came from tells me where
[1:36:10] I'm going. And the gates of hell can
[1:36:14] never prevail against
[1:36:19] it.
[1:36:22] I've got a revelation
[1:36:26] of predestination.
[1:36:30] I've got a revelation.
[1:36:34] God is my father.
[1:36:38] I know where
[1:36:41] I came from. Tells me where
[1:36:45] I'm going. And the gates of hell can
[1:36:49] never prevail against
[1:36:53] it.
[1:36:56] Amen. Let's sing. Yes, I know.
[1:37:03] Come ye sers
[1:37:07] lost and hopeless.
[1:37:10] Jesus blood
[1:37:12] can make you free.
[1:37:16] For he saved
[1:37:18] the worst among
[1:37:21] you when he saved
[1:37:24] a wretch like me.
[1:37:27] And I know,
[1:37:30] yes, I know
[1:37:33] Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner
[1:37:37] clean.
[1:37:39] And I know,
[1:37:42] yes, I know
[1:37:44] Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner
[1:37:48] clean.
[1:37:50] To the faint
[1:37:53] he giveth power
[1:37:56] through the mountains
[1:37:59] makes a way.
[1:38:02] Findeth water
[1:38:04] in the desert
[1:38:07] turns the night
[1:38:10] to golden day.
[1:38:13] And I know,
[1:38:16] yes, I know
[1:38:18] Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner
[1:38:22] clean.
[1:38:24] And I know,
[1:38:27] yes, I know.
[1:38:30] Oh, Jesus blood can make the vilest
[1:38:33] sitter.
[1:38:36] In temptation,
[1:38:39] he is near.
[1:38:41] He holds the power
[1:38:44] of hell at bay.
[1:38:47] Guide you to
[1:38:50] the path of safety.
[1:38:53] Gives you grace
[1:38:55] for every day.
[1:38:58] And I know,
[1:39:01] yes, I know
[1:39:04] Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner
[1:39:07] clean.
[1:39:10] And I know,
[1:39:12] yes, I know
[1:39:15] Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner
[1:39:19] clean.
[1:39:21] He will keep
[1:39:23] me while the ages
[1:39:26] grow throughout
[1:39:29] eternity.
[1:39:32] For things
[1:39:35] hell ragees
[1:39:37] all must work
[1:39:40] for good to thee.
[1:39:43] And I know
[1:39:46] yes I know
[1:39:48] Jesus blood can make the vowest sinner
[1:39:52] please.
[1:39:54] And I know,
[1:39:57] yes, I know
[1:39:59] Jesus blood can make the vilest sinner
[1:40:03] clean.
[1:40:06] Amen. There's a fountain
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; flowing for us. Amen. I just want to
[1:40:12] sing one more if we could. Just kind of
[1:40:15] this theme that we heard today. Trust
[1:40:17] and obey.
[1:40:19] Trust and obey.
[1:40:23] Learning to trust the Lord.
[1:40:28] When we walk with the Lord
[1:40:33] in the light of his word,
[1:40:37] what a glory he sheds on his way.
[1:40:46] While we do his good will,
[1:40:50] he abides with us still and with all who
[1:40:56] will trust and oy.
[1:41:02] Trust and oy
[1:41:06] for there's no other way to be happy in
[1:41:13] Jesus.
