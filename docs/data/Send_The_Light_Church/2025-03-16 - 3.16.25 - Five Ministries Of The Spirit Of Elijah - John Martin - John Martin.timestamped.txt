[33:55] would have maybe a opinion of the things
[33:58] that will be uh read today but Lord

[34:04] of our opinions away and that you would
[34:06] give us the mind of Christ as we read
[34:09] Thy word please give us Lord what we
[34:12] have need of today and we'll give you
[34:13] the praise for this in Jesus precious

[35:07] the word of the Lord for he went and
[35:08] dwelt by the Brook Sheriff that is
[35:11] before Jordan and the Ravens brought him
[35:14] bread and fish in the morning and the
[35:16] bread and the fish in the evening and he
[35:18] drank of the brook and it came to pass
[35:21] after a while that the brook dried up
[35:23] because there had been no rain in the
[35:24] land and the word of the Lord came unto
[35:26] him saying arise get thee to
[35:29] zerth which belongeth to zidon and dwell

[37:54] place um and God
[37:58] uses the office of a prophet to get his
[38:03] word across to the people yes now he
[38:06] also needs to show them a sign to that
[38:10] they would know because a prophet is
[38:11] really a
[38:13] Seer and and God uses Major Prophets to
[38:16] unveil the mind of God to the people but
[38:18] how many people do we know say God told
[38:20] me this and it didn't come to pass so
[38:23] there's a lot of people like that so how
[38:24] do we know a true Prophet well we can go
[38:27] here to the book of Deuteronomy these
[38:30] are going to be all scriptures today no
[38:33] quotes Deuteronomy 18 verse number 20
[38:36] says but the prophet which shall presume
[38:38] to speak a word in the in my name which
[38:43] I have not commanded him to speak or
[38:46] that or that shall speak in the name of
[38:49] other gods even that Prophet shall die
[38:53] and if thou shall say in thy heart how
[38:55] shall we know the word which the Lord
[38:57] have not spoken and when a prophet
[39:00] speaketh in the name of the Lord if the
[39:02] thing follow not nor come to pass then
[39:06] that is the thing which the Lord has not
[39:10] spoken but the prophet have spoken it
[39:13] presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid
[39:15] of him so there's so many people that
[39:18] prophesy things and some of them come to
[39:23] pass let some you not but God's prophet
[39:27] when he speaks it comes to pass in the
[39:29] name of the Lord it always comes to pass
[39:33] that's how you know you can have
[39:38] confidence Amos 3:7 says surely the Lord
[39:41] God will do nothing but he revealeth his
[39:45] secret unto his servant his Prophet the
[39:48] prophets so God always uses a prophet
[39:51] that's just all there is to it and it's
[39:54] just not the New Testament like I said
[39:56] there's two in the old and three in the
[39:58] New Testament and God help us we're
[40:00] going to get through these so Elijah
[40:03] predicts the drought according to his
[40:04] word I like how verse one says and
[40:06] Elijah the tishbite said unto Ahab as
[40:08] the Lord God of Israel liveth be whom I
[40:11] stand there shall not be dun or rain
[40:13] these days but according to my word he
[40:16] calls it my
[40:19] word James 5 uh 17 James 5:17 Isaiah
[40:24] speaking of the same man was uh uh isaas
[40:28] was a man subject to like passions as we
[40:30] are and he prayed earnestly that it
[40:32] might not rain and it rained not on the
[40:35] Earth by the space of three years and
[40:38] six months can you imagine having no
[40:40] rain for three and a half
[40:43] years and he spoke and it was according
[40:46] to the will of God and he prayed again
[40:49] and the heavens gave rain in the earth
[40:51] brought forth her fruit and this is
[40:54] important because God is looking at his
[40:58] people and he sees his people they are
[41:02] they're they're walking in sin they're
[41:04] not believing they're serving other gods
[41:06] they're in the things of the
[41:08] world and God has to get the attention
[41:11] of the
[41:12] people and God uses a prophet to cause
[41:15] things to happen to get people's
[41:17] attention to to bring judgment sometimes
[41:20] of various reasons but we know that God
[41:22] uses this office in a very very serious
[41:26] manner amen
[41:28] so the ministry of Elijah had power to
[41:31] control weather we've seen that in this
[41:32] age as well am it had power to sustain
[41:37] the poorest Widow who was willing to put
[41:40] the prophet
[41:42] first you know you would think that God
[41:45] would say don't you go ask in a will she
[41:47] don't got anything in fact she's only
[41:50] got enough for one more meal and you're
[41:52] going to go to her and be so rude to say
[41:55] give me first a little bit
[41:58] you know God is always waiting to see if
[42:00] we're going to put him
[42:02] first and if we can't put God first then
[42:06] then God is not first in their
[42:10] life too many people in this age don't
[42:12] want to put the message before their
[42:15] life that's the
[42:19] truth now I'll tell you God did not send
[42:22] this message so you could take and just
[42:23] spring over it if you want it or don't
[42:25] want it amen I'm telling you God is
[42:27] watching your attitude towards
[42:33] it we're going to pick it up here in
[42:35] First Kings
[42:36] 713 I like this that the Widow all she
[42:39] had was a handful of of meal in a baron
[42:41] a little oil and a cruise and sticks and
[42:43] and Elijah said unto her in verse 13
[42:45] fear not go and do as thou has said but
[42:49] make me therefore there a little cake
[42:53] first and bring it unto me and after for
[42:56] the and for thy son for thus sayith the
[43:00] Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal
[43:01] shall not waste neither shall the cruise
[43:03] of oil fail until the day that the Lord
[43:06] sendeth reain upon the Earth that was
[43:09] three and a half years that the barrel
[43:12] never ran Dr the oil never ran out you
[43:15] talk about a
[43:17] miracle our God is able to do
[43:19] exceedingly above all that we could ask
[43:21] or even think he's the one that makes a
[43:23] way only thing we have to do is put him
[43:25] first
[43:27] not figure out how to do it put him
[43:30] first he'll Supply the
[43:32] miracle and she went and did according
[43:35] to the saying of Elijah and she and he
[43:37] and her house did eat many days and the
[43:39] barrel meal wasted not neither did the
[43:41] cruise of oil fail according to the word
[43:43] of the Lord which he spake by Elijah the
[43:48] ministry of
[43:50] Elijah so if you put the word of the
[43:53] Prophet first in your life I want to say
[43:55] that if you put the word of the Prophet
[43:58] first in your life God will not only
[44:01] sustain you but I believe this he'll
[44:03] Prosper you he'll Prosper
[44:06] you amen the word of God's Prophet will
[44:10] spiritually sustain the believer in this
[44:13] hour Amos
[44:15] 811 behold the days cometh sayeth the
[44:18] Lord God that I will send a famine in
[44:20] the
[44:21] land not a not a famine of
[44:24] bread nor a thirst of water but the
[44:27] hearing of the words of the Lord you
[44:29] can't hardly go anywhere and you feel
[44:31] like you got to sift out what's being
[44:34] said it's a
[44:37] truth and they shall Wander from sea to
[44:39] Sea and from North even to the east they
[44:41] shall run to and fro and seek the word
[44:43] of the Lord and shall not find
[44:46] it but God is able to sustain the
[44:51] believer in This
[44:52] Hour 2 Chronicles 20:20 hear me oh Judah
[44:57] Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[44:59] believe in the Lord your God so shall
[45:00] you be established Believe In His
[45:02] prophets so shall ye Prosper amen now
[45:06] this word belief is like believing in
[45:08] Jesus you it's not it's not say well I
[45:10] believe Jesus exist that's not what
[45:13] brings prosperity it's not I believe you
[45:16] know I believe in the prophet of this
[45:18] hour that does not bring Prosperity you
[45:21] literally have to believe the message
[45:23] that he spoke and to the point that you
[45:25] apply everything to your heart that you
[45:28] you you read it and you say God I want
[45:29] it and you take it in and you start
[45:31] living other people see it that is
[45:33] really what it means to
[45:38] believe so we know that he he raised the
[45:41] Widow son from the dead we won't have
[45:43] time to get into all
[45:47] these Elijah prayed and God miraculously
[45:50] brought the Widow son back to
[45:53] life and then he had this show down at
[45:57] Mount carel we all know about that
[45:59] Elijah challenged 450 different
[46:04] religious I'll just say it like this
[46:06] false Believers yes
[46:10] right they had so many things in
[46:13] common brother brandham
[46:16] said they had so many they were they
[46:18] were had so many things in common yet
[46:23] they didn't believe in
[46:25] God and First Kings 18:21 said Elijah
[46:29] came unto all the people and said how
[46:30] long halt ye between two opinions if the
[46:35] Lord God if the Lord be God follow him
[46:39] but if baale then follow
[46:41] him you know that's the thing there's
[46:43] there's too many people that want to
[46:45] just be in lukewarm leoa going here
[46:48] going there one day you can't even count
[46:50] on
[46:51] them so how long Hal between two
[46:54] opinions if you believe the message
[46:56] start walking in
[46:57] it if it's not find something
[47:04] else so he prophesied and he brought
[47:07] forth rain at the end of the drought
[47:11] after the mount carel we don't have time
[47:13] that's a great story Mount Carmel The
[47:15] Showdown when fire came
[47:19] down afterwards he destroyed 51 Soldiers
[47:23] with
[47:24] fire and lightning
[47:27] two different
[47:30] times and uh King hazer a hazra had
[47:36] gotten ill and he sent men to inquire
[47:38] listen of be elub the god of acran
[47:41] whether I shall recover of his disease
[47:43] because he got one in 2 Kings 1:3 and
[47:46] the angel of the Lord said unto Elijah
[47:48] the tishbite according arise go to meet
[47:52] The
[47:53] Messengers uh of the king of Syria
[47:56] Samaria and say unto them is it not
[47:59] because there is not a God in Israel
[48:01] that you go and inquire beab the god of
[48:03] acran God knows sometimes we go and we
[48:07] try to get our needs met in another way
[48:10] than God
[48:11] am God doesn't like that when we don't
[48:14] put him first he demands respect can you
[48:18] say amen God demands respect we have a
[48:21] choice not to respect but God demands it
[48:24] right so the king sends 50 men with a
[48:27] captain to tell Elijah to come down off
[48:29] his Hill we'll pick it up in 2 Kings
[48:31] 1:13 here if they put it up on the board
[48:34] and the King sent again a captain of the
[48:37] third
[48:38] 50 with his 50 and the third captain of
[48:42] the 50 went up and fell down on his
[48:45] knees before Elijah and besought him and
[48:47] said unto him oh man of God I pray thee
[48:50] let my let my life and the life of these
[48:53] 50 servants be precious in thy sight now
[48:56] notice the two the two groups of 51 that
[48:59] came
[49:00] up they come up and said Elijah come
[49:03] down you know our King wants to talk to
[49:05] you kind of this disrespectful
[49:09] attitude no humility at all and finally
[49:13] the king sends this another group of 50
[49:15] up he says man I know what's going to
[49:17] happen to me if I go up and just do what
[49:19] my king told me to
[49:20] do I'm going to be consumed so they
[49:24] walked the church with humility amen
[49:28] right they came in with a right manal
[49:31] attitude and said behold there came fire
[49:34] down from heaven and burnt up the two
[49:36] captains of the formal 50s with their 50
[49:38] therefore let my life now be precious in
[49:41] thy sight and the angel of the Lord said
[49:43] unto Elijah go down with him be not
[49:45] afraid of him and he arose and went down
[49:47] with him unto the king see God God can
[49:49] trust somebody who's humble God can
[49:51] trust somebody who's
[49:55] real be afraid of that person who's not
[50:01] respectful respect God's prophets God
[50:04] demands respect to His
[50:07] prophets I'll say like this respect or
[50:09] you or you spiritually
[50:12] die you respect the prophets or you
[50:14] spiritually die 1 Chronicles
[50:17] 16:20 and when they went from Nation to
[50:21] nation and from one Kingdom to another
[50:24] people he suffered no man to do the
[50:26] wrong y he approved Kings and for their
[50:29] sakes saying touch not my anointed and
[50:34] do my prophets no harm now this
[50:38] scripture is so important you'll find it
[50:39] two times in the
[50:42] Bible touch not my anointed and do my
[50:45] prophets no harm God watches over His
[50:50] prophets and the thing is I'll say like
[50:53] this anything that you do against the
[50:56] prophet in the message it's going to
[50:57] come back and hurtt
[50:59] you it will so the last one was when he
[51:05] parted the Waters of the Jordan River
[51:08] and Elijah was with Elisha when this
[51:11] happened and they parted the river and
[51:14] they went across on dry land and I just
[51:16] want to read a little bit here in First
[51:17] Kings 19:19 there's going to be a lot of
[51:20] a lot of scripture a lot of information
[51:21] but I want you to do is just catch the
[51:22] spirit of
[51:23] everything so Elijah in verse 19 so
[51:27] Elijah departed then and from Elisha and
[51:30] found Elisha the son of japa who was
[51:34] plowing with 12 Yol of oxen before him
[51:38] and he with the 12 and Elijah passed by
[51:41] him and he cast his Manel upon
[51:43] him I just think this is so
[51:46] beautiful and he left the oxen and ran
[51:49] after Elijah and said let me I pray thee
[51:51] kiss my father and my mother and then I
[51:54] will follow thee and he said unto them
[51:56] go back again for what have I done to
[51:59] thee I mean if that's your choice you
[52:00] want to go do that you go do that and he
[52:03] returned back from him and he took a Yol
[52:06] of oxin and slew them and bowed their
[52:08] fle uh flesh with the instruments of The
[52:11] Oxen and gave unto the people and did
[52:13] eat then he arose and went after Elijah
[52:16] and ministered unto him Elisha became
[52:19] Elijah's
[52:23] servant Elijah became a Elisha's
[52:30] Mentor we all are following
[52:34] somebody you just need to be careful who
[52:37] you're
[52:38] following because the
[52:41] spirit that you're because the spirit
[52:43] that's on them who you're following is
[52:45] really what's leading
[52:50] you so when Elisha heard the call of God
[52:54] through the prophet he left everything
[52:56] to follow the prophet's message of that
[52:59] hour no different than in in this hour
[53:03] Second Kings 21 you can say Amen to that
[53:06] by the way
[53:07] amen 2 Kings 2:1 and it came to pass
[53:10] when the Lord would take up Elijah into
[53:14] Heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went
[53:16] with Elisha from gilgal and Elisha said
[53:20] unto Elijah said to Elisha Terry here
[53:24] and I pray thee for the Lord have sent
[53:26] me to bethl and Elijah said unto him as
[53:29] the Lord liveth as thy soul liveth I
[53:32] will not leave thee so they went down to
[53:35] bethl and the sons of the prophets that
[53:37] were at bethl came from forth to Elisha
[53:40] and said unto him knowest thou not that
[53:43] uh the Lord will take away thy master
[53:45] from thy head today and he said yeah I
[53:47] know it hold your
[53:50] peace hold your peace and Elijah said
[53:53] unto and Elijah said unto him Elisha
[53:56] take carry here and I pray thee for the
[53:58] Lord have sent me to Jericho and he said
[54:00] as the Lord liveth as thy soul liveth I
[54:03] will not leave thee so they came to
[54:06] Jericho and the sons of the prophets of
[54:08] the Jericho came out to elishah and said
[54:10] unto him knowest not that the Lord have
[54:12] taken th will take thy master from thy
[54:14] head today and he answered yeah I know
[54:16] but hold thy peace and Elijah said unto
[54:18] him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord
[54:20] have said to me said sent me to Jordan
[54:23] and he said as the Lord liveth and as my
[54:25] soul liveth I will not leave thee and
[54:27] they too went on notice that Elijah made
[54:31] so much opportunity to keep Elija from
[54:35] him and a lot of times the Lord will
[54:37] will provide opportunities for us to to
[54:41] to to have a problem that we can't make
[54:43] it to
[54:46] church make make make it so you you you
[54:48] you just don't have time to to to listen
[54:51] to a tape to to read your Bible to he'll
[54:53] just he'll do that because he wants to
[54:55] see if you're to say is the Lord liveth
[54:57] I'm going to do what the will of the
[54:58] Lord
[55:01] is and the 50 men of the
[55:04] sons want to make sure I got that verse
[55:06] 7even and and the 50 men of the sons of
[55:09] the prophets went and stood to view far
[55:12] a far off and the two stood by Jordan
[55:14] Elijah took his man and wrapped it
[55:16] together and smot the waters and they
[55:18] divided hither and thither hither and
[55:21] thither so that they the two went over
[55:24] on dry ground
[55:27] same as he did with Moses right and it
[55:30] came to pass when they were gone over
[55:33] that Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I
[55:37] shall do for thee before I be taken away
[55:41] from thee and Elijah
[55:44] said I pray
[55:46] thee let a double portion of your spirit
[55:50] be upon
[55:51] me what a thing to
[55:54] ask he didn't care about anything of
[55:57] this world he wanted the spirit he
[56:00] wanted a right spirit and he he he
[56:02] wanted a double
[56:06] portion he got it
[56:08] too and he said thou has asked a hard
[56:13] thing
[56:14] nevertheless if thou see me when I am
[56:17] taken from thee it shall be so unto thee
[56:20] but if not it shall not be so he knew
[56:23] that God would have to take control of
[56:25] the situation right that is right and it
[56:27] came to pass as they still went on and
[56:31] talked and behold there appeared a a
[56:33] chariot of fire and a horse of fire and
[56:36] part of them both as sun and Elijah went
[56:38] up and a whirlwind into heaven it was
[56:40] his own Rapture
[56:43] amen and Elisha saw it and he cried my
[56:46] father my father the Chariots of Israel
[56:48] and the horsemen thereof and he saw him
[56:50] no more and he took hold of his own
[56:52] clothes and rent them into two pieces he
[56:55] took up also the man of Elijah and fell
[56:59] that fell from him and went back and
[57:01] stood by the bank of Jordan he took that
[57:03] man of Elijah and that fell from him and
[57:05] smot the waters and said where is the
[57:07] Lord God of Elijah and when he and when
[57:11] he also had Smit the waters they parted
[57:13] and thither thither hither and thither
[57:15] and Elijah went
[57:17] over and
[57:19] this this was the beginning of his
[57:24] ministry this was uh we could say like
[57:27] the first
[57:28] miracle Elisha hungered for the god that
[57:32] the Prophet Elijah had talked about and
[57:35] I just wonder I wonder in this age how
[57:37] many people are really hungering for
[57:40] what the prophet had talked
[57:43] about I wonder how many people want a
[57:45] double
[57:49] portion Bible says we have not because
[57:52] we ask
[57:53] not Elisha asked for the right thing and
[57:56] he got
[57:57] it and Elisha perform twice as many
[58:01] miracles as Elijah
[58:04] did amen we got we got one a amen out of
[58:07] that it's the truth he did he asked for
[58:09] a double portion and the Bible records
[58:11] twice as many miracles as Elijah did
[58:14] amen I just want to read a couple you'll
[58:16] find it all if you write it down Second
[58:17] Kings you will find these Miracles but
[58:20] God gave fertility to a woman of a
[58:23] shemite raised a child from the dead he
[58:26] healed nam in the of leprosy you know
[58:29] also uh Gesa was cursed with Leprosy so
[58:34] one was healed and one was
[58:36] cursed he made iron axe head
[58:39] float and he struck the amanian blind so
[58:44] and there's many things 16 of but I just
[58:47] wanted to read some but Elijah was the
[58:49] SEC was the uh the the Elisha was the
[58:53] second time that God had used this min
[58:56] Ministry in the
[58:59] Bible now the third was in the New
[59:04] Testament but I want to read a prophecy
[59:06] that spoke about it in the Old Testament
[59:08] and that's Malachi chapter 3 behold I
[59:11] send my messenger and he shall prepare
[59:14] the way before me and the Lord whom you
[59:17] seek shall suddenly come to his Temple
[59:20] even the messenger of his Covenant whom
[59:22] ye Delight in behold he shall come sayth
[59:26] the Lord of
[59:28] host one more prophecy it's in Isaiah
[59:31] 40:3 the voice of him that crith in the
[59:33] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[59:35] Lord make straight um in the desert a
[59:38] highway for our God every Valley shall
[59:41] be exalted Every Mountain shall Hill
[59:43] shall be made low and the Crooked shall
[59:45] be made straight and the rough places
[59:47] plain so here it is this is a prophecy
[59:50] in the Old Testament about a prophet
[59:52] that's coming in the New Testament are
[59:54] you with me amen amen amen amen and the
[59:58] and I'll say the first two uh uh
[1:00:01] ministries of Elijah were very very
[1:00:03] powerful very powerful so we want to
[1:00:07] pick it up here in in the New Testament
[1:00:09] it's in Luke 1:
[1:00:11] 13 but the angel said unto him fear not
[1:00:16] Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and
[1:00:19] thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son
[1:00:21] and thou shalt call his name John and
[1:00:24] thou shalt have joy and glad gladness
[1:00:26] and many shall rejoice at his birth for
[1:00:29] he shall be great in the sight of the
[1:00:30] Lord and shall drink neither wine nor
[1:00:33] strong
[1:00:34] drink but he shall be filled with the
[1:00:36] Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb
[1:00:40] and many of the children of Israel shall
[1:00:41] be turned to the Lord their God many of
[1:00:47] the children of Israel shall be turned
[1:00:49] to the Lord their God and the Lord shall
[1:00:54] go before him what in the spirit and the
[1:00:58] power of
[1:01:01] Elias this is the third time that this
[1:01:04] spirit is being
[1:01:06] used the spirit and the power
[1:01:10] ofas
[1:01:11] ielas to turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:01:14] to the children the disobedient of the
[1:01:15] wisdom to the just to make ready a
[1:01:17] people prepared for the Lord so notice
[1:01:20] his job was to prepare the people for
[1:01:22] the first coming of Christ amen
[1:01:31] it was to deal with the hearts of the
[1:01:35] people and I'll say it like this we're
[1:01:37] going to call them Old Testament
[1:01:41] fathers and turn them to Christ that was
[1:01:45] his job to take the Old Testament and
[1:01:48] say look Behold the Lamb of God who
[1:01:50] takes away the sins of the world that
[1:01:52] was his job amen because Christ was
[1:01:54] going to bring them to the New
[1:01:57] Birth Verse 18 and Z Zachariah said unto
[1:02:01] the angel whereby shall I know
[1:02:04] this how I know what I'm hearing is the
[1:02:08] truth for I am an old man and my wife
[1:02:12] well stricken in years and the angel
[1:02:15] answering said unto him I am Gabriel
[1:02:17] that standeth in the presence of God and
[1:02:20] I'm sent to speak unto thee and to show
[1:02:22] thee these Glad Tidings and behold Thou
[1:02:24] shalt be dumb and not able to speak
[1:02:27] until the day that these things shall be
[1:02:30] performed because thou believest not my
[1:02:32] word which shall be fulfilled in their
[1:02:34] season how important it is to believe
[1:02:38] what the prophet said what the what the
[1:02:40] seventh age messenger said how's that so
[1:02:44] we need to be careful no no doubting
[1:02:47] God's word don't got doubt God's
[1:02:51] prophets it's it's it's one thing to say
[1:02:53] I don't understand I don't I I've never
[1:02:56] heard that before I didn't see that in
[1:02:58] the Bible I I I don't it's okay to say
[1:03:00] that it is not okay to say I don't
[1:03:02] believe it it's not even okay to have an
[1:03:05] attitude that I don't believe
[1:03:10] it because that's what God's looking at
[1:03:15] amen John chapter 1 St John chapter 1
[1:03:18] verse 19 and this is the record of John
[1:03:22] when the Jews sent priests and Levites
[1:03:24] from Jerusalem to ask him who art thou
[1:03:27] and I want you to catch this John comes
[1:03:30] on the scene the priests and the
[1:03:34] Levites are trying to figure out and the
[1:03:37] Jews trying to figure out who John
[1:03:40] really is amen and so they asked the
[1:03:42] question who art thou well we know he
[1:03:44] was the The Prophet
[1:03:47] Elijah the third time it was being used
[1:03:51] uh and but listen he says and he
[1:03:56] confessed and denied not but confessed I
[1:03:59] am not the Christ he made it clear he
[1:04:02] looked so much like Christ but he said
[1:04:05] I'm not Christ and they asked him what
[1:04:07] then art thou Elias and he answered I am
[1:04:12] not art thou that prophet and he
[1:04:15] answered
[1:04:17] no I don't think John was trying to be
[1:04:20] humble
[1:04:23] here I don't think he was trying to be
[1:04:25] humble and say no I'm not a prophet I'm
[1:04:27] not that
[1:04:30] Prophet they had him mixed up with a
[1:04:33] different
[1:04:36] Elijah
[1:04:39] amen because he said that
[1:04:43] Prophet we'll we'll see they were
[1:04:46] referring to the prophet that was coming
[1:04:49] before his second coming not his first
[1:04:51] coming and he didn't lie he wasn't being
[1:04:54] humble he was humble but he wasn't
[1:04:56] trying to be
[1:04:58] humble then said they unto him who art
[1:05:02] thou then G give us give uh that we may
[1:05:05] give an answer to them that sent us what
[1:05:07] sayest thou of thyself and what does he
[1:05:10] do he quotes the very scripture of the
[1:05:12] Old
[1:05:13] Testament he said I am the voice of one
[1:05:16] crying in the wilderness make straight
[1:05:18] way the Lord as he said the prophet
[1:05:20] Isaiah or I Isaiah and they which were
[1:05:24] sent were of the phes and they asked him
[1:05:27] and said unto him why bapti baptizes
[1:05:31] thou then if thou be not the Christ or
[1:05:34] isaas neither that prophet and John
[1:05:37] answered them saying I baptize thee with
[1:05:40] water but there standeth one among you
[1:05:43] whom you know not he it is who cometh
[1:05:46] after me is preferred before me whose
[1:05:48] shoe latchees I am not worthy to un lose
[1:05:52] amen right at that time John was on
[1:05:56] earth and the majority of the people did
[1:05:59] not recognize the
[1:06:02] ministry just like in this age same
[1:06:05] thing in this
[1:06:07] age we find out that this prophet he
[1:06:10] didn't play
[1:06:12] around he said it was he said it like it
[1:06:14] was he wasn't a
[1:06:18] pushover this Elias's Ministry was a
[1:06:21] fiery
[1:06:23] Ministry I want to pick it up here
[1:06:25] Matthew 3:1 in those days Came John the
[1:06:29] Baptist preaching in the wilderness of
[1:06:31] Judea and he said repent ye for the
[1:06:33] Kingdom of Heaven is at hand turn around
[1:06:37] amen for this is he that spoke by the
[1:06:40] prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one
[1:06:42] crying in the wilderness prepar the way
[1:06:44] of the Lord make straight path make his
[1:06:47] paths straight amen the same John had
[1:06:51] his remnant of camel hair he he didn't
[1:06:54] go to Men's Warehouse did
[1:06:57] he and a leather girdle about his loins
[1:07:01] and his meat was Locust and wild honey
[1:07:05] he probably didn't hit the Texas
[1:07:09] Roadhouse then went out to him Jerusalem
[1:07:13] and all Judea and all the regions round
[1:07:15] about Jordan and were baptized of him in
[1:07:18] Jordan confessing their sins so you see
[1:07:20] he was turning many of them to Christ
[1:07:24] amen and then when when he saw many of
[1:07:26] the Pharisees and Sadducees they came to
[1:07:28] the baptism Al also he said unto
[1:07:32] them why are you
[1:07:34] here why are you here oh ye Generation
[1:07:38] of Vipers who has warned you to flee
[1:07:41] from the Wrath that is to come he said
[1:07:44] bring forth therefore fruit meat for
[1:07:47] repentance there's got to be some sort
[1:07:49] of some sort of fruit that shows you're
[1:07:53] real you just can't say sorry
[1:07:57] you can't just say well I don't want to
[1:07:58] miss out I and I don't want to go to
[1:08:00] hell and I'm just no you got to
[1:08:02] thoroughly
[1:08:03] repent you got to have fruit meat for
[1:08:07] repentance and think not to say within
[1:08:10] yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father
[1:08:12] for I say unto you that God is able of
[1:08:14] these stones to raise up children unto
[1:08:16] Abraham amen and now also the ax is laid
[1:08:19] to the root of the trees therefore every
[1:08:21] tree that bringeth forth not good fruit
[1:08:23] is hewed down and cast in the fire now
[1:08:25] this is somebody that you don't want to
[1:08:27] go to church with and just to hear a
[1:08:29] good sermon to make you feel good
[1:08:32] am he said it like it was he said I
[1:08:35] indeed baptize you with water into
[1:08:37] repentance but he that cometh after me
[1:08:39] is mightier than I who shoes I am not
[1:08:42] worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with
[1:08:44] the Holy Ghost and with fire now I'm
[1:08:46] telling you today Saints our greatest
[1:08:47] desire should be to be filled with more
[1:08:49] of the Holy Ghost not be content with
[1:08:52] going to church not be content to saying
[1:08:54] I'm in the message not be content with
[1:08:56] just saying I know Jesus but to get so
[1:08:59] full of the Holy Ghost that our life
[1:09:01] displays
[1:09:03] it whose fan in his hand and he will
[1:09:06] thoroughly Purge his floor and gather
[1:09:08] his wheat to the Garner but he will burn
[1:09:11] up the chaff with
[1:09:13] unquenchable fire amen now just like
[1:09:17] Elijah and Elisha Eliza's Ministry this
[1:09:22] John the Baptist it was fiery
[1:09:25] the Bible says the Lord went before him
[1:09:28] in the spirit and the power of
[1:09:33] Elias to turn the hearts of the Old
[1:09:36] Testament fathers to
[1:09:41] Christ and Christ led him to the New
[1:09:45] Birth you must be born again
[1:09:49] amen he prepared the way of the
[1:09:52] lord and there came a time when John's
[1:09:55] Ministry had to actually
[1:09:57] decrease said I must decrease he must
[1:10:01] increase
[1:10:03] amen now the five ministries of the
[1:10:06] spirit of
[1:10:07] Elijah
[1:10:09] Elisha um John the Baptist and now I
[1:10:14] want to speak on the fourth Ministry of
[1:10:18] Elijah yes sir there seems to be more
[1:10:22] scriptures for telling the fourth
[1:10:23] Ministry of johnen
[1:10:26] uh of the fourth Ministry than of John
[1:10:28] the
[1:10:31] Baptist but so many people see John the
[1:10:34] Baptist just because of what's written
[1:10:36] about him in the New
[1:10:38] Testament but there's so many things not
[1:10:41] spelled out in the Book of Revelations
[1:10:44] that's going to happen it doesn't mean
[1:10:47] it's not going to
[1:10:48] happen it just means it's not spelled
[1:10:54] out so let's take a look here at the
[1:10:56] first one and it's Malachi chapter
[1:10:58] 4 for behold the day cometh that shall
[1:11:02] burn as an oven has that happened
[1:11:06] yet and all the proud ye and all that do
[1:11:10] wickedly shall be stubble and the day
[1:11:13] that cometh shall burn them up sayeth
[1:11:15] the Lord of hosts that it shall leave
[1:11:17] them neither root nor
[1:11:21] Branch now
[1:11:23] that's that's a that's yet to come do
[1:11:26] you believe that but unto you that fear
[1:11:29] my name can you say Amen to that amen
[1:11:32] shall the son of righteousness arise
[1:11:34] with healing in his rings and ye shall
[1:11:36] go forth and grow up as calves of the
[1:11:39] stall now you know that this ministry
[1:11:41] that came was came with such a powerful
[1:11:44] Healing Ministry it really attracted the
[1:11:47] attention of the people amen so much
[1:11:50] healing was done in this ministry we
[1:11:52] might even say more more was done in
[1:11:54] this ministry of healing than any other
[1:11:56] Ministry than since the time of
[1:12:00] Christ verse three and ye shall tread
[1:12:04] down the wicked for they shall be what
[1:12:07] ashes Under The Souls of your feet in
[1:12:11] the day that I shall do this sayeth the
[1:12:14] Lord of
[1:12:18] hosts well we know the Bible says that
[1:12:20] the Earth is going to
[1:12:22] burn it's going to burn it's I mean I
[1:12:26] believe it is going to burn
[1:12:30] everything he says remember ye the law
[1:12:32] of Moses which I command unto him in
[1:12:35] Horeb for all Israel which with the
[1:12:38] statutes and the
[1:12:40] judgments so God gave the Prophet The
[1:12:43] Commandments to give to the people just
[1:12:46] like God gives this Prophet The
[1:12:49] Commandments to the people can you say
[1:12:52] amen
[1:12:53] amen behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:12:57] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:13:00] and Dreadful day of the
[1:13:02] Lord well that couldn't have been John
[1:13:05] the
[1:13:06] Baptist we could if he would have said
[1:13:08] Dreadful it would been okay because when
[1:13:11] he came the first time he says I bring
[1:13:14] you great Good Tidings of of great
[1:13:17] Tidings of good Joy or something along
[1:13:19] those lines it was a great his first
[1:13:23] coming but it wasn't Dreadful
[1:13:26] there was nothing in that speech from
[1:13:27] the Angels about being Dreadful it is
[1:13:30] spread the good news a son is born a
[1:13:34] savior is
[1:13:36] here so it wasn't that Elijah It Was
[1:13:39] Elijah before the great and Dreadful day
[1:13:41] of the
[1:13:44] Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:13:47] fathers to the children the hearts of
[1:13:48] the children to their fathers lest you
[1:13:50] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[1:13:52] without getting into it this there's
[1:13:54] been a number scriptures in the Bible
[1:13:56] that's referring to do different time
[1:13:57] periods and I'm talking about even two
[1:14:00] or 3 th000 different years and Jesus
[1:14:02] spoke of him one
[1:14:06] himself so this is speaking of of of of
[1:14:09] first part of John the Baptist and also
[1:14:12] of the prophet in this age
[1:14:17] sir this is the last book in the Old
[1:14:22] Testament where God himself says that
[1:14:25] he's going to send a prophet
[1:14:28] future and the Elijah Ministry Prophet
[1:14:31] is to come on the scene right before the
[1:14:34] second coming of
[1:14:38] Christ because he said if he don't send
[1:14:40] him he's going to Smite the Earth with a
[1:14:48] curse his ministry happens before the
[1:14:51] wicked are burned up and before we walk
[1:14:54] upon the uh on on the ashes of of them
[1:14:59] and this fourth Ministry of Elijah has
[1:15:01] been often mistaken for the John the
[1:15:05] Baptist ministry unfortunately because
[1:15:09] of just not knowing all the
[1:15:11] scriptures no wonder Jesus said search
[1:15:13] the
[1:15:14] scriptures study be you know I'm I'm
[1:15:18] going say it's not important that you're
[1:15:19] all theologians but it's real important
[1:15:22] that you're serious about being in the
[1:15:24] place that God want want you to be so
[1:15:25] you can truly truly hear the
[1:15:30] truth so now Jesus talks about this
[1:15:33] Prophet I want to talk about
[1:15:35] that go with me if you would to Matthew
[1:15:37] chapter
[1:15:38] 17:9 this is after Jesus was
[1:15:41] transfigured before Peter James and John
[1:15:43] I'll tell you at this time they also saw
[1:15:46] Moses and
[1:15:47] Elias in verse three starting here in
[1:15:50] verse
[1:15:51] 9 and as they came down from the
[1:15:54] mountain Jesus Jesus charged him saying
[1:15:55] tell the vision to no man until the son
[1:15:57] of man be risen again from the
[1:16:00] dead and his disciples asked him saying
[1:16:04] why then say that the scribes that Elias
[1:16:07] must first come does everybody
[1:16:10] understand
[1:16:11] that there's
[1:16:13] no mumble jumble in this question it's a
[1:16:18] it's straight out you know why do the
[1:16:20] scribes why are people saying that
[1:16:22] there's a prophet that's supposed to
[1:16:24] come first
[1:16:26] and Jesus answered them and said Elias
[1:16:29] truly shall first come and restore all
[1:16:35] things when he makes this statement John
[1:16:38] the Baptist is already beheaded he's
[1:16:41] already dead and he's making this
[1:16:44] statement that Elias shall first come
[1:16:47] and restore all things amen so they're
[1:16:52] the the the these uh
[1:16:56] uh these uh scribes were talking about
[1:17:00] the Elias that was to come before the
[1:17:02] second coming of
[1:17:03] Christ and Jesus saying he is going to
[1:17:06] come he's going to come and his job is
[1:17:09] to restore
[1:17:11] am John the Baptist didn't restore
[1:17:25] he didn't restore the
[1:17:27] word he didn't restore all things the
[1:17:31] Bible says that he didn't even do
[1:17:36] Miracles so he didn't restore the
[1:17:41] Miracles so Jesus spoke of the Prophet
[1:17:44] that came in this
[1:17:45] age I think this is
[1:17:50] beautiful it's right here in the word of
[1:17:52] God that this is not just a
[1:17:56] man and this ministry is so
[1:18:03] important why then say the scribes that
[1:18:06] Elias must first come because they were
[1:18:09] thinking that the ministry of Elijah had
[1:18:11] to come before the second coming it's in
[1:18:14] the last chapter of the Old
[1:18:17] Testament but they were referring to the
[1:18:19] fourth Ministry of the spirit of Elijah
[1:18:25] and we must understand that God uses
[1:18:27] this ministry five
[1:18:29] times Jesus refers back now to the third
[1:18:32] Ministry of the spirit of Elijah in the
[1:18:34] next verse verse 12 so he's talking
[1:18:38] about both of them but I say unto you
[1:18:40] that Elias is already come and they knew
[1:18:44] him not but they done unto him
[1:18:47] whatsoever they listed likewise should
[1:18:48] also the the son of man suffer them in
[1:18:51] other words John the Baptist got
[1:18:53] beheaded he got killed the son of man is
[1:18:55] also going to be
[1:18:57] killed because to be honest with
[1:19:01] you the children of the devil don't know
[1:19:03] who the children of God
[1:19:08] are don't there's no representation
[1:19:12] there they're
[1:19:15] blind look at verse 13 then the
[1:19:18] disciples understood that he spake unto
[1:19:20] them of John the Baptist
[1:19:25] understood there's two different
[1:19:28] ones now speak Peter
[1:19:32] speaking and I want to just zoom in on
[1:19:35] the the restoration this this Prophet
[1:19:37] that came in this age he's to restore
[1:19:39] the word that's why it's so important
[1:19:41] for us to get into the message and
[1:19:43] listen to the tapes don't depend on the
[1:19:46] preacher do not depend on the pastor do
[1:19:48] not depend on me do not even depend on
[1:19:51] the the other four-fold Ministry that
[1:19:53] sits that stands here yes God sent a
[1:19:56] prophet it is our job to listen to it
[1:20:04] amen unfortunately I think there's some
[1:20:06] laziness amongst
[1:20:10] us well I'm just I just I just know you
[1:20:12] know brother John he's just going to
[1:20:14] tell us the
[1:20:15] truth that has nothing to do God did not
[1:20:18] send me as Elijah the fourth Ministry to
[1:20:22] this
[1:20:23] age I'm just a I'm just a
[1:20:27] person but God sent this man with a
[1:20:30] message and it's up to all of us to get
[1:20:33] into it get serious with it because if
[1:20:35] we don't catch it we're going to miss it
[1:20:37] it doesn't matter if you receive me as
[1:20:39] your
[1:20:42] pastor this this ministry is so much
[1:20:47] higher and I'll say it like this you got
[1:20:49] to have a hunger for what God sent you
[1:20:52] you got to have a hunger for what God
[1:20:54] sent you amen Acts 3: 19 Peter speaking
[1:20:59] to the people at Solomon's porch he says
[1:21:01] repent ye therefore and be
[1:21:02] converted that your sins may be blotted
[1:21:05] out when the times of refreshing shall
[1:21:07] come from the presence of the Lord and
[1:21:09] He Shall send Jesus Christ which is
[1:21:11] which before was preached unto you whom
[1:21:14] the Heaven Must receive until the times
[1:21:18] of restitution of all things which God
[1:21:24] has spoken by his mouth by the mouth of
[1:21:26] all his holy prophets since the world
[1:21:27] began in other words restitution had not
[1:21:30] happened when John the Baptist was
[1:21:33] there in fact Jesus the heavens was
[1:21:36] going to retain Jesus in other words he
[1:21:38] wasn't coming back again until there's a
[1:21:42] restitution and God sends a prophet with
[1:21:45] a word that restores the people back to
[1:21:48] the original faith that was once
[1:21:52] there so it's under the the fourth
[1:21:55] Ministry of the spirit of Elijah that
[1:21:57] the word of God is restored to the
[1:21:59] Gentiles and it's under the five the
[1:22:01] fifth Ministry of the spirit of Elijah
[1:22:04] that the Jews are restored to the word
[1:22:06] of
[1:22:07] God that Ministry won't help
[1:22:13] us but this ministry will help
[1:22:17] us and remember when the prophet wanted
[1:22:19] to go to the
[1:22:20] Jews right perform they'll believe
[1:22:23] they'll believe this
[1:22:27] but he was the wrong Prophet to
[1:22:30] them he was a prophet he had the gift he
[1:22:33] he knew that they would receive it but
[1:22:35] it wasn't the will of God Amen
[1:22:38] Revelations 10:7 very common for many of
[1:22:41] us but in the days of the voice of the
[1:22:43] seventh
[1:22:44] angel this is the seventh angel
[1:22:47] Messenger to the Church of
[1:22:49] leoda when he shall begin the sound the
[1:22:52] mystery of God should be finished if he
[1:22:54] declar
[1:22:54] to his servants the prophets so we see
[1:22:57] here that he had the ministry that
[1:23:00] brought conclusion to everything there's
[1:23:02] no more mystery there's no more
[1:23:04] confusion there's there's there's we
[1:23:07] know the right baptism we know the
[1:23:09] godhead we we we understand what
[1:23:11] happened in the Garden of Eden we know
[1:23:13] the Seven Seals we know the trumpets we
[1:23:16] know
[1:23:19] everything there's no more
[1:23:21] mystery I'll say it like this I am soad
[1:23:24] glad I never thought I was so smart that
[1:23:26] I had to prove everything and I'll tell
[1:23:29] you what happened this is this is the
[1:23:31] greatest thing get a revelation of who
[1:23:34] the prophet is and you'll never doubt
[1:23:36] anything he
[1:23:37] says but you miss that
[1:23:40] Revelation and you'll be dicting
[1:23:43] everything everything everybody
[1:23:47] says when you have a
[1:23:50] revelation of the ministry that God sent
[1:23:53] am then you just just eat the book you
[1:23:56] just eat it eat it eat it eat it and you
[1:23:58] become the
[1:24:01] book people look at your life and say
[1:24:03] you're
[1:24:04] different they're
[1:24:13] different it is true that we must
[1:24:15] identify this
[1:24:17] Prophet because if we don't then we can
[1:24:20] never identify the message that God sent
[1:24:22] us so we need to put a name to that
[1:24:27] Prophet we must identify who the prophet
[1:24:29] is and I I've always said this if
[1:24:31] William Brandon is not that Prophet to
[1:24:33] this age then tell me who
[1:24:35] is tell me who is show me that
[1:24:42] Ministry but too many people have
[1:24:44] acknowledged the prophet and I've never
[1:24:47] identified with the
[1:24:51] message in other words they feel safe
[1:24:53] being in a message
[1:24:57] church it's not the acknowledging of the
[1:25:01] messenger that makes us a
[1:25:03] bride it's receiving the message into
[1:25:05] our lives that vindicates our identity
[1:25:08] as his bride I hope you catch that when
[1:25:11] I see the blood I'll pass over you when
[1:25:15] I see the Life of Christ Living inside
[1:25:17] of you in this age overcoming this world
[1:25:21] that is the truth you've received the
[1:25:22] message I don't care how long you sit in
[1:25:24] a message
[1:25:25] Church it doesn't make you a message
[1:25:29] believer we've got to receive the
[1:25:31] message God didn't send a a a a prophet
[1:25:35] to just say oh look I sent a prophet
[1:25:37] we've got to receive the message of the
[1:25:42] Prophet we are
[1:25:45] believers we must be if we are believers
[1:25:48] we must be restored because that was the
[1:25:50] reason that God sent this this Prophet
[1:25:53] was to restore us to restore the word to
[1:25:56] our
[1:25:58] lives not so we can put a picture up of
[1:26:00] William brandom and say yeah he's the
[1:26:08] prophet
[1:26:12] no what the bride needs in this hour has
[1:26:15] been brought to us to the Elijah
[1:26:19] Ministry of William brandham of Malachi
[1:26:22] 45 and6
[1:26:25] if people can make it in the Rapture in
[1:26:28] this hour without this message then tell
[1:26:33] me why God sent the
[1:26:37] message we need the message to make it
[1:26:41] yes sir brother baham said rapturing
[1:26:43] faith lies in those
[1:26:47] tapes in 1933 when brother Brandon was
[1:26:50] baptizing I believe the 17th person in
[1:26:52] the Ohio River
[1:26:55] a voice spoke from heaven and said as
[1:26:57] John the Baptist was sent to for on my
[1:26:59] first coming so shall you in your
[1:27:01] message forerun my second
[1:27:07] coming as elzer was sent to get a bride
[1:27:10] ready for Abraham's promised son Isaac
[1:27:12] so I believe that this message is sent
[1:27:15] to get a bride ready for the promised
[1:27:18] son Jesus
[1:27:20] Christ
[1:27:22] Amen brother brand had his own Mont
[1:27:25] carel sown in Chicago during the Chicago
[1:27:29] Ministerial Association when they came
[1:27:31] and they wanted to trap him there was a
[1:27:33] I don't know how many ministers there I
[1:27:35] would think that I I think there was a
[1:27:37] lot more than 450 Brother Bruce might
[1:27:39] remember L there was a lot and they came
[1:27:43] there and they wanted to challenge
[1:27:44] brother brandom on his Doctrine and the
[1:27:47] doctrine of baptism and the godhead and
[1:27:48] things like that but God had warned him
[1:27:52] just like he wared Elijah what was going
[1:27:54] to
[1:27:55] happen forewarned
[1:27:58] him and he and he began to tell Tommy
[1:28:01] Hicks who why don't you just go in there
[1:28:03] and you you take my spot he says oh no I
[1:28:05] can't do that he was trying to be sneaky
[1:28:08] with him that's
[1:28:09] right but brother Bram knew because God
[1:28:13] had showed
[1:28:15] him and so when he when he was when
[1:28:17] Tommy Hicks I believe it was introducing
[1:28:19] brother brandom to the podium says now
[1:28:21] many of you ministers you may not agree
[1:28:24] with brother brandom
[1:28:27] here but I'll tell you what he's
[1:28:29] Fearless
[1:28:31] that's and he walked up there and think
[1:28:35] about this he's standing in front of a
[1:28:37] group of people who in their heart were
[1:28:40] against
[1:28:42] him but he had no
[1:28:44] fear because when God is with you
[1:28:46] there's nothing to
[1:28:48] fear he had a perfect love for the word
[1:28:50] of God Amen cast out all fear
[1:28:56] he says I want one of you to come
[1:29:00] up with your Bible and prove one of my
[1:29:05] doctrines be to be wrong that's
[1:29:08] right I don't want your prayer
[1:29:11] books I don't want your man-made stuff
[1:29:14] come up with the Bible and show me where
[1:29:15] I'm wrong he said not one of them would
[1:29:19] move he says okay why don't you come up
[1:29:22] with a a group come up with your group
[1:29:25] your committee because
[1:29:27] maybe maybe you're just afraid to come
[1:29:29] by
[1:29:30] yourself and nobody would come that's
[1:29:34] right because they knew that God was
[1:29:37] with
[1:29:39] him finally he said then stay off my
[1:29:42] back if you don't believe it that's what
[1:29:44] he
[1:29:45] said you don't believe stay off my
[1:29:48] back if you don't want to believe the
[1:29:51] truth and you want to believe something
[1:29:52] different than the truth you go ahead
[1:29:55] but God sent me to get a
[1:29:58] bride praise
[1:30:00] God the the dead had been raised in
[1:30:04] brother brandom's
[1:30:05] Ministry no different in than in
[1:30:09] Elijah's numerous times the the dead had
[1:30:12] been been raised to life
[1:30:16] again
[1:30:17] many brother brandom showed the sign of
[1:30:20] a
[1:30:22] prophet he brought forth the word that
[1:30:24] brings us to a complete new birth right
[1:30:28] a lot of the churches out there they say
[1:30:30] I I I'm born again this is what you need
[1:30:32] to do be to be born again just put your
[1:30:34] name on the book just get baptized just
[1:30:37] do this just do that just speak in
[1:30:40] tongues and you got it
[1:30:42] boy or girl excuse me
[1:30:46] believer but brother Brandon brought the
[1:30:50] truth I'm so glad for this message
[1:30:53] Saints
[1:30:54] I would not be here today without the
[1:30:56] message of the
[1:30:58] hourl and God so arranged it that the
[1:31:02] message even though brother rand's gone
[1:31:04] the message is still
[1:31:07] recorded and we should be in it all the
[1:31:11] time because I know this that there's
[1:31:13] things in this message that I need yet
[1:31:16] to make
[1:31:17] it I'm not here telling you I've
[1:31:19] listened to every tape and I'll tell you
[1:31:22] if if I did listen to every tape three
[1:31:24] times I still believe there's something
[1:31:27] in the tape that I have to hear
[1:31:30] yet the thing is are we going to put our
[1:31:33] heart and put Elijah first you
[1:31:37] understand I'm saying the word of the
[1:31:39] Lord that came from Elijah and I love
[1:31:42] this because
[1:31:44] Elijah this Prophet never led us to
[1:31:47] himself ever you can't listen to a tape
[1:31:50] where he says look at me
[1:31:54] you you hear the message and you get
[1:31:55] done and he's pointing us to Jesus
[1:31:59] Christ how could you listen to that and
[1:32:01] say he's a false
[1:32:04] prophet you got people in this message
[1:32:08] that have such a spirit on them that say
[1:32:09] look at
[1:32:10] me look at me or they want you to follow
[1:32:17] them that's not the spirit of the
[1:32:19] Prophet that was not the spirit of the
[1:32:22] ministry Lord Lord help
[1:32:26] us it's not good enough to belong to a
[1:32:29] message church we we must receive the
[1:32:31] message inside of us it needs to become
[1:32:35] life it needs to change
[1:32:38] us if anyone doesn't have a revelation
[1:32:41] of this message we need to pray that God
[1:32:43] would give it to
[1:32:45] us pray for it God give me a revelation
[1:32:49] of this
[1:32:50] message if anyone's struggling with
[1:32:53] believing and a prophet to this
[1:32:55] generation we need to pray God reveal it
[1:32:57] to me because today we went over the
[1:32:59] scriptures we didn't do any
[1:33:01] quotes just
[1:33:06] scriptures you don't want to be on the
[1:33:08] fence with Elijah's fourth
[1:33:12] Ministry we got to get serious about it
[1:33:15] I believe we need it to make a
[1:33:17] Rapture all right my time is up but I
[1:33:20] just want to go over the last Ministry
[1:33:21] if I could
[1:33:24] so this is like
[1:33:26] bonus bonus time all right Revelations
[1:33:29] chapter 11 this is the fifth Ministry
[1:33:31] the Elijah Ministry to the
[1:33:37] Jews people to say that God doesn't have
[1:33:41] prophets in the New
[1:33:47] Testament and there in verse one and
[1:33:49] there was given me a re like unto a rod
[1:33:51] and the angel stood saying rise and
[1:33:53] measure the temple of God and the Altar
[1:33:56] and then that worship therein but the
[1:33:58] court which is without the temple leave
[1:34:00] out and measure it not for it is given
[1:34:02] unto the
[1:34:04] Gentiles in other words this is going to
[1:34:06] be for the Jews the holy city which
[1:34:08] shall tread under under 40 uh foot 40
[1:34:12] and two months three and a half years
[1:34:15] and I will give power unto my two
[1:34:20] witnesses and they shall prophesy a
[1:34:23] thousand 203 score days clothed in
[1:34:27] sackcloth so they won't be looking real
[1:34:32] pretty these are the two olive trees the
[1:34:35] two candlesticks standing before God
[1:34:38] before the god of the earth and you if
[1:34:41] you want to look that up that's in
[1:34:43] Zechariah chap 4 veres 2 and 3 if you
[1:34:46] want to write it
[1:34:47] down verse five and if any man will hurt
[1:34:50] them fire proceedeth out of their mouth
[1:34:55] and devour their enemies If any man will
[1:34:58] hurt them he must in the this manner be
[1:35:03] killed so we see the
[1:35:07] same same Elijah ministry
[1:35:10] here these have power to shut up Heaven
[1:35:14] that it rain not in the days of their
[1:35:16] prophecy and have power over the waters
[1:35:19] to turn them to blood and smite the
[1:35:21] Earth with all the plagues as of we see
[1:35:23] MO is there right as often as they will
[1:35:27] and when they shall have finished their
[1:35:30] testimony the Beast shall Ascend out of
[1:35:32] the bottomless pit and shall make war
[1:35:35] against them and shall overcome them and
[1:35:37] kill them God will allow them to get
[1:35:40] killed and their dead bodies shall lie
[1:35:43] in the street of the great city which
[1:35:46] spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt
[1:35:48] where also our Lord was crucified yes
[1:35:51] sir and they of the people and and
[1:35:53] kindreds and tongues and Nations shall
[1:35:56] see their dead bodies there uh three
[1:35:59] days and a half and shall not suffer
[1:36:02] their dead bodies to be put into the
[1:36:03] grav can you imagine so much
[1:36:07] hate that they they won't even give them
[1:36:10] a proper
[1:36:12] burial and everybody and the whole world
[1:36:15] is going to see it every nation every
[1:36:17] tongue it it's just going to be all over
[1:36:20] the TV all over the phones everybody's
[1:36:23] going to see them it's it's going to be
[1:36:24] a
[1:36:26] reality and they that dwell upon the
[1:36:28] Earth shall rejoice over
[1:36:31] them and make Merry and show send gifts
[1:36:34] one to another because these two what
[1:36:40] prophets notice the word says prophets
[1:36:44] amen God has prophets
[1:36:48] amen these two prophets tormented them
[1:36:52] that dwelt on the Earth and you know
[1:36:55] something if you ever come to church and
[1:36:57] you feel like you're tormented I want
[1:36:59] you to understand you're you know what
[1:37:01] you're doing you're recognizing an evil
[1:37:03] spirit on
[1:37:08] you look the word of God should never
[1:37:10] offend
[1:37:11] you the word of God comes to help us and
[1:37:16] understand that our flesh is always
[1:37:18] emnity with God always it's never going
[1:37:20] to say if you're looking for your flesh
[1:37:23] to to be happy then you're looking for a
[1:37:24] church for
[1:37:26] entertainment something that makes you
[1:37:28] feel
[1:37:29] good but that's not what these two men
[1:37:31] did they said it like it was and praise
[1:37:34] God for their Ministry because their
[1:37:36] Ministry brought out 144,000
[1:37:39] Jews it it did but the rest of the world
[1:37:44] hated them the rest of the Jews hated
[1:37:47] them yes
[1:37:50] sir you thought they tormented
[1:37:53] and after 3 days and a half the spirit
[1:37:55] of life from God entered into them and
[1:37:58] they stood on their feet and great fear
[1:38:00] fell upon all which saw them and they
[1:38:03] heard a great voice from Heaven saying
[1:38:05] unto them come up hither and they
[1:38:07] ascended up into the heavens and the
[1:38:09] cloud and their enemies beheld
[1:38:13] them they all saw them
[1:38:16] raise and then they all saw them going
[1:38:18] in they saw these two going to
[1:38:21] Rapture God is so awesome
[1:38:24] God has always got the final
[1:38:27] Cil always in that same hour there was a
[1:38:31] great earthquake and the 10th part of
[1:38:33] the city fell and the earthquake was SL
[1:38:35] were slained of men 7,000 The Remnant
[1:38:38] were frightened and gave glory to God Of
[1:38:40] Heaven the second wall is passed and
[1:38:42] behold the third wall cometh quickly
[1:38:46] amen God bless you let's Stand Together
[1:38:47] these are the five ministries of the
[1:38:49] spirit of
[1:38:51] Elijah we've had the privilege of being
[1:38:53] introduced to the fourth Elijah Ministry
[1:38:55] of Jesus
[1:38:56] Christ and he he like
[1:39:02] Paul did not shun to declare unto us the
[1:39:05] whole Council of
[1:39:08] God if you want to know more about God
[1:39:11] listen to the
[1:39:13] tapes you get a good understanding we
[1:39:15] were had at our last men's meeting we
[1:39:17] were with uh brother uh our our our
[1:39:21] brother Charlie here in the back and he
[1:39:23] told me in the men's meeting he told us
[1:39:26] all in the men's meeting he said you
[1:39:28] know when when I read the Bible I tell
[1:39:29] you it is it is really hard to be honest
[1:39:31] with you to understand some of these
[1:39:33] things in the Bible I says he says but
[1:39:35] when I go and I read that church age it
[1:39:37] just opens up to me and I can see things
[1:39:40] and tell what a testimony of the
[1:39:43] importance of the message of getting
[1:39:45] into the message because it opens the
[1:39:47] word to us it it speaks in a way that we
[1:39:50] can understand certain things
[1:39:55] he is God's voice to this
[1:39:58] age he's not just one of
[1:40:02] many God is not the author of confusion
[1:40:05] God sent this man with a Ministry to
[1:40:08] help us get ready for a
[1:40:10] Rapture I believe all Ministries that
[1:40:13] are
[1:40:14] connected uh to that same ministry will
[1:40:17] be preaching the same message I believe
[1:40:19] that with all my
