thank you for all this lord we committed now the rest of the service into your hands in the precious name of our lord and savior we ask you amen amen philippians chapter 2 starting with verse number one if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be like minded having the same love and being of one accord and of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god he thought it not robbery to be equal with god but he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashionism and he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross god bless you may be seated notice here this the description of jesus he that he made himself with no reputation he became a servant he was made in the likeness of man he humbled himself he came these are the characteristics of god they're not just god is different than christ they're they're one and the same and uh want to get back into a series that we started actually back in december 19 of 2021 was almost two months ago we did part one of god's conscious series and so to be god conscious is not only to have the thoughts of god or the same opinion or the same idea that god has but it means to be like god the process of those thoughts and making them manifest it's easy to say yes the mind of christ is to be a servant and it's another thing to live your life as a servant the mind of christ in one way could be oh i know that what christ would do would would esteem the other better than the self and that would be the mind of christ because i read that in the word but if i have the mind of christ i will be doing that if i don't have the mind of christ i'll just be stating what the mind of christ does so on december 19th i made a statement that statement was through these the series god will provide us all an opportunity to become more god conscious not just the knowledge of the truth now but in our behavior how we handle things and that's what this purpose is this this is about so we can we don't have to guess what the will of the lord is when we have the mind of the lord we have we know what to do with the situation we established that we can number one let this mind be in you that was in christ we established that it can happen you just got to believe it it's got to start with the faith but how do we let it brother john you see and we will see all the opportunities of how we let the mind of christ be in us through humility you'll you'll never see it outside of that it will only be through humility that will ever become more god-conscious brother random told us made this statement he said that we should always have a spirit that says i could be wrong now a lot of times we'll use those words i could be wrong but never have the spirit i could be wrong so we we need to have a spirit of i could be wrong and that's the only way that you'll you'll serve one another and esteem one another and not uh vaunteth yourself and and talk about yourself when when you see a man with confidence you you tend to look at them as somebody that has something right you see somebody who doesn't have confidence in their self they they're wishy-washy they're up and down it's kind of hard to have confidence in that but there is a a difference between god and the man when you brother brown talks about uh or the bible talks about david being small and ruddy and and a lot of people picture samson is some big strong guy he was he was small and jesus brother brandon said jesus was small but brother brother branham was small so there was nothing outwardly that we should behold some greatness but yet they possessed a power that was so strong inside of them it was the power of god so it's one thing when god is speaking through us and it's another thing when we're trying to mimic god and it's really not god so i say it like this always have a spirit that i could be wrong we also stated that the mind of christ will always be pressing us to manifest all of god it won't get to a place to say where been there done that that's behind me or i've attained it'll always be as paul express of pressing towards a mark no matter how long you've been serving no matter what he achieved no matter what the credentials it was doing the same thing at the end that he was doing at the beginning being found faithful being born again doesn't just have a beginning then it's all over and we're born again like we we state to one another have you been born again yes i'm born again as as if we got the credentials now we may mention that being born again has a beginning and it has a process and we should never think that it has an end for us it'll be over when god says it's over but we can't see in the scriptures where it ever describes that uh we're there and we had a prophet that came that resolved all the issues all the mysteries all the questions and made it real clear the truth of the word and yet he taught us in the message press towards that image press towards that and i believe that's if we just focus on that we'll be better off so we're going to just take our time we're not going to get through uh even part two today isn't that funny we're not going to get through part two but we just want to take our time and it's been two months since we got we started this philippians 2 5 says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus the mind of christ could be defined therefore through the scriptures as a humble obedient mind that serves the master's plan the master plan of god humble obedient and serves the master plan of god because that's what jesus was described as having the mind uh that was uh uh that was in christ jesus so there's no he didn't have thoughts of vain glory or that he was better than others and in fact when he was washing the feet of his disciples he says you call me master and lord so i am it's the truth just like when he was there are you the king of the jews well who says that he was but he didn't brag about it he says but if i am your lord and i am your uh your master if i'm gonna serve you and wash your feet who are you to think anything different anything higher than that you should you should do the same thing you should have the same mind so there's no consciousness of esteeming ourselves or building our own reputation it's not about us jesus always glorified the father and our thought should be about glorifying the father he did those things which only pleased the father the mind of god was in christ and paul is saying to us let it be in us just transfer it to us wouldn't it be nice if we could just go to as it were the library and check out a book just you know get the mind of christ like that you know every man's right in his own eyes so so many people think they've got the mind of christ just by default by the thought by pride basically in the beginning we were in the mind of god brother brahm taught us we were a part of god's eternal thoughts and god said in jeremiah 29 11 for i know the thoughts i think towards you saith the lord their thoughts of peace they're not of evil and to give you an unexpected end so god had a vision for our end how we would end up we could say also that god thinks thoughts of peace the way he thinks the mind of god is is thinking peace it's not always he never went around trying to oh i'm going to prove all the pharisees and the sadducees and how they were wrong and they should he listened to me you know he didn't do that he's a peaceful thinker and i'll say it like this the bible says blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god they got the mind of god amen we on the other hand are usually in a temporal state of mind our thinking therefore we look at what's going on in our present life or who we're talking to at the moment when we look at others we usually look at them in a 2d fashion like a picture you see only part of their lives we usually don't think about the things that are going on in their lives what they're going through brother brahm talked about putting ourselves in somebody else's shoes so we can kind of feel what's going on but we but when we look at situations in a 3d perspective we can see more clearly what's going on 3d is you you you see like when you look at this picture here you see basically a front view of jesus just say right now of a person but but when you look at me you know you see 3d you're seeing all of me well our mind functions in a 2d thought pattern i we look at how we're dressed and we look at the things that are being said and maybe what we heard about somebody but when god looks at us well that word is a discern of the thoughts intents of the heart that that he sees everything he knows every thought in fact he told brother branham that our thoughts speak louder in heaven than our words do on earth and and he he could know that even though uh the the the the pharisees with their lips they worshipped him their heart was far from them amen because god sees and his mind is in a 3d uh perspective the bible says that god's thoughts are higher than our thoughts they're a higher perspective he sees things before they happen so we could say that his thoughts or his vision encompasses eternity that's why he could predestinate us according to foreknowledge because he sees such 3d he knows what's going to happen next week before it ever happens he sees all things before it happens therefore the mind of christ is constantly in continuity of god's eternal vision amen remember jesus saying in matthew chapter 5 verse 19 he says verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for whatsoever what what things so ever he doeth these also do it the sun likewise amen remember when jesus said i must needs go by samaria he was walking in god's eternal vision he was walking in the mind of god and even when brother bryan would have a vision and he knew it was absolutely the truth but there was a time that had to wait before it came to pass and a lot of times we're thinking well i did this i did this it should be happening right now and we don't encompass god's timing i do nothing except the father show me first the bible talks about waiting on the lord brother branham taught us when you you think you received the holy ghost he says you stay there and you wait longer and you you you wait to receive more and then when you think you got it you wait longer and you seek him more and then when you think you got he said stay there longer because as soon as you come up here to start seeking more of god i guarantee the devil is going to be working on your shoulder and telling you you ain't going to get it and then after you say i am staying here i am going to get you know he's going to tell you you got it now you got it now because he don't want you serious with god he don't want you humbling yourself before god he don't want you calling on god seeking knocking asking because he's in trouble when your will unites with god's will amen god had a desire for fellowship with his own kind amen there wasn't any no matter the angels and how great and the holy holy and the recognition of of god's greatness was constantly coming before him in praise and adoration which it should i believe it's still happening in heaven there was still something in the heart of god that he longed for fellowship of his own kind in genesis chapter 1 verse 26 the bible says let us make man in our image after our likeness amen verse 27 so god created man in his own image and in the image of god created he him both male and female created he them so here he was he decides that he's going to make a creation that's going to be after his image and after his likeness it wasn't just he's a man but it was the same image the same lightness the same character the same mind handling things the same way in a 3d perspective not well i want to bet on the races and i want to do this and i want to do that and i got this going on and no after his likeness his image his will we know man obviously fell from that image and likeness in the garden amen but god's desire for man to be in his image never did fall he still wants it it's in the forefront of his mind if i could say it like that in fact romans 8 29 declares that that certain believers have been predestinated to be conformed back to that very same image that he had in the garden god is going to have a bride not only washed in his blood but washed by the word amen one thing that's our trust in calvary and it's another thing to prove it by when the word is being preached just to say be it unto me according to thy word she's going to be without spot without wrinkle or any such thing this bride will be in the same image that adam originally was created in she will have the same character of god we're taught by the prophet bride will willingly take on the responsibility of making herself ready she's not going to throw it off on god and every man that has this hope the bible says in him purifyeth himself even as he's already pure brother branham said character will never be gifted to us it's not a gift we all got gifts we didn't work for them we didn't earn them we didn't do something to get them but character is different it's not given to any man it's it's something that you choose in the middle of a battle to be a humble servant obedient to what the master has told us to do and it's easy to say yes god wants me to do this and god wants me to do that but you get in a trial and somebody's fussing and fighting with you well then it really comes real it's where the rubber meets the road to where if you've got character or not if you're gonna handle that situation exactly with the mind of christ or are you going to prove your right or prove they're wrong are we going to strife and vain glory and reputation and you can't do that to me and are we just going to simply have the character of christ so we see that the character is never gifted to us we'll have to fight our flesh and overcome it to get the character or the image of christ now i'm not worried about the devil he's no match for my god in fact he was already defeated at calvary so i'm not worried about the devil i am worried about myself my greatest enemy the one who doesn't want to be humble who doesn't want to submit to the word who doesn't want to lower himself and esteem others better that's who i'm worried about because that's the guy that can keep me out of the rapture amen and that's why we need the mind of christ i don't know if i'll get to it today but there's just something about that spirit of pushing predestination it does more harm than good no matter how much i'm predestinated seed of god i must at some fashion sometime i must get the character of christ or i'm not going so we can talk about predestination and how much we're seed but if we never get the character it really doesn't matter it's like who are we trying to convince first john chapter 3 verse 2 says but beloved now are we the sons of god and does not yet appear what we shall be but we know when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is so so when he appears do we just say i'm seen i'm in the message i believe the prophet oh i'm like him that's the criteria now when we look at this part of the scripture when he shall appear it really could have a compound meaning one referring to when jesus returns to catch his bride away we're going to be like him or the other is when jesus returns to open the word to us every time we come to church and we accept that word into our heart that we're going to become more like him second corinthians chapter 3 verse 17 now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty so when we come to church yes we're here but a lot of times we come with a thousand different motives but god is looking for liberty because he's interested in one thing not the 2d stuff going on in her life if that's all he was interested in he would never say seek ye first the kingdom he wants us to come seeking the kingdom first and it's just not the knowledge of how great and vast everything's happening in the mission world but what's going on in our life the kingdom that's going on in their life what is he have in his way so verse 18 now says but we all with open face beholding when we come to church as in a glass the glory of the lord that's in the opening of the word now we are changed into the same image of god from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord we're changed from this situation where the glory of god came upon us revealed to us what we need to do we accepted it we go out with strength to lay down our life to manifest the character that god just told us about last service and we're changed the bible says into the same image not a one-shot deal character is not a gift we're not born again one day and the next day we don't have to think about the rest of our life we're changed from glory unto glory here a little there a little we're growing into the statue of a perfect man we're adding to our faith uh a temperance and patience and all these things till we come to that statue of the perfect image the masterpiece of jesus christ now god has a vision for our lives we might say it's god's conscious vision we've been predestined to be changed into his image now without god's vision we will perish in other words if god just says i'm going to have a human race i'm going to die for them we'll see who you know just whoever gets into my image they're going to you know make it and who don't if god didn't have a vision for you and i we would never make it a lot of times we go through the course of a time and we don't even think about god we don't think about his will we don't think about am i doing things displeasing to you should i be doing better lord and god reminds us and shows us and knocks on our heart and says what's going on here when uh i think david said when you spoke to my heart and you said when god said seek ye my face my my heart said unto me thy face well i seek there's an obedience to the call of god so god has a vision for us and without that vision we would perish now what's important is that we must have that vision for us as well we must unite with that vision we must consciously possess god's mind or vision for our lives can't lose track of that now before i get more into that vision i want to also make this statement that satan has a vision for your life as well he wants to take his image just like god does and put it in you there's a very reason that god started out and said you must be born again or you can't even understand what's going on in heaven because we were born with such a basically the opposite of our opening scripture it wasn't humble didn't want to serve it only cared about itself it's i ca i want a a number one record i i want to be the best boxer i want to be the best football player super bowl on tonight so i can say that or whatever it's not i don't even know what to sign but the point is our our our natural life wants to be first and we got to die out to that and be born again with the the spirit of god the nature of god the character of god and and it don't happen through just church attendance and it don't happen by just uh uh repenting and getting baptized and then it's all done and then we just come and we we hear we listen to tapes and and and somehow we put forth little efforts and somehow we get there i'm sorry it won't be there jesus told us we need to strive we need to strive because this nature is constantly warned against us every day we need to deny ourself every day pick up our cross simple it's the only way that will develop the image and the character of jesus christ amen now the image of lucifer was described in ezekiel 28 15 as as perfect in the beginning but he chose not to obey the bible says that thou was perfect in thy ways from the day thou was created till iniquity was found in thee so the image of satan is described as a knowledge of good and evil right it's a tree of knowledge of good and evil and james 4 17 says therefore to him that know what to do good and to do with it not to him it is sin so it is the same image of lucifer when a human being knows the right thing to do and chooses not to do it we become more in the image of lucifer i believe it was david he said in in psalms 51 somewhere i was aborned in sin i was shapen in iniquity it was part of my makeup i was born in this condition to do what i wanted to do instead of what the will of god was for my life genesis chapter 2 verse 17 says the tree of knowledge of good and evil john martin's definition of the tree of knowledge of good and evil is possessing the knowledge of god's will and choosing not to do it and they couldn't partake of that tree they only did it once caused everything that every suffering that ever has transpired in the world and yet somehow that same spirit comes around us and says it's not a big deal if i it's not a big deal if because god knows you're a seed you god knows you're predestinated god's trying to develop his image his character which is to do the same thing that god would do are you with me that's why the prophet said when we when we come to church he says we will never ever leave church the same way we came in i don't know about you i don't know how many times i sat in church and thought what did i get out of that or what's why should i have even came or thoughts of boy that was a good service i enjoyed this i enjoyed that but in reality we when we make a conscious decision to to come before the judgment seat of christ where his word is being spoken we will never leave the doors the same way we came in never it don't matter what we're thinking about the service whether we felt it didn't feel it end out that don't matter the truth of the matter is you will hear god's word you will heal you will hear the will of god for your life and if you choose to say be it unto me according that word i'm going to live that word i'm going to apply it to my life when i leave the service the brother man says you will be closer drawn to the lord but if you know the will of god as it's presented and you choose not to adhere to it you don't put your heart to it no matter how you feel you will be further away from god than when you came in those doors the thing is we don't think it we don't feel those things but the truth of the matter is you can't get any favor with god by rejecting his word we see the image of lucifer we see the image of satan he he wants us to come into church hear the word and choose not to do it revelations 12 9 says that old serpent called the devil and satan all the same image the same devil that was in the garden is in the world today and what is he doing he's deceiving the world he's deceiving everyone to take his image we look and say oh the world's going crazy you can't hardly hear any news and say i can't believe it's getting worse every week every month every year things are getting worse why is it why isn't satan satisfied with just keeping a man from becoming born again why can't he just be satisfied that they're born in sin shape and iniquity uh and just just go on and live a halfway decent life without without hurting one another and killing one another and and and and and changing all the their agendas not their agendas their their their genders [Laughter] why does he keep wanting to blow nations up and and kill and murder and do why because there's something in satan that wants to see him the full image of his evil and hatefulness so manifested in humanity he wants to see his image inside every human being just like god is not satisfied with us being saved i'm predestined i'm going i'm elected i'm going in the no he wants to see his image manifested in his bride and he will not stop and she will not stop until it's manifested you see why when we come to church how our flesh hates to hear the word that challenges it hates it abhors it makes excuses he can't live it no you can't live it but god can in you if he did it for someone he'll do it for you he overcame in somebody's else's life he can overcome in your life but it's about getting serious with god not being satisfied with just coming to church doing our our our duty but becoming more serious with god satan is anti-god and his whole vision is to see the whole world in the very same image of himself we've all talked about it and heard about it how the antichrist is is going to just be so evil but remember he has the ability to look like the hero revelations 13 17 says that no man might buy or sell save he that are the mark the name of the beast the number of his name we're talking about a mark a name or a number all the same can't buy herself here is wisdom let him that have understanding count the number of the beast where's the number of a man and now the beast and the man are the same and his number is 603 score and six we've been schooled we understand if we take the roman numerals of the vicarious philly idea dili dei should have it up there on the board so you can know how it's really how it really is instead of the way i'm saying it writtens there in the vatican somewhere it doesn't matter it's something that they believe and what it means is instead of christ vicarious means substituting for or in place of philia means sun and delay de la means god so it means instead of the son of god and that the pope believes that he's uh i had a catholic place tell me one time that that the the pope has the power to change the word of god and at that moment something inside of me said whoa whoa son just didn't it didn't click with me before i came into the message that was that happened but if you take the roman numerals of this instead of christ instead of the son of god it adds up to hundred three scoring six six six six now the bible tells us it's the same number uh as man man was was created on the sixth day so it's not just the pope instead of christ it's man man's will instead of christ exalting himself above what the will of god is for his life see how deceptive satan has to be in a church to get a man a religious man not to do the will of god and one great way is to believe so much that you're predestinated that that's all that matters i mean can we just shelf that thing have we heard enough about it no one the prophet said we need to stay away from that preachers need to stay it confuses the people well one of preachers preaching about predestination he don't think he's confused in the people and he may not be but satan is it it confuses the people in thinking if i'm predestined and then what do i got to worry about because that's what the preacher says god's going to take you through what do you got to worry about well in one sense i am in the palm of god's hand but in another sense he puts me out there and he gives me a choice to lay down my life and do his will or just to be so pious about i'm a son of god i'm i'm a i'm predestinated it doesn't have to do anything that's what's confusing about it so revelation 12 9 says the great day dragon he deceiveth the whole world he was cast out to the earth and his angels were cast out with him so he he deceives a third of the angels he jesus just sees adam and eve and you know he he he's still going still deceiving turn with me if you would to james chapter 1 verse 21 satan is deceiving the church into not having to take the full word of god how many people mandy will come to me in that day and say lord lord didn't i do this do this didn't do that whatever and he says i didn't know you because there was a work of iniquity which simply means knowing to do the right thing and choosing that it's not that big a deal not against it won't preach against it but just for me you know it's not that big a deal god still loves me god's still going to take me through i'm still predestined just because i don't do that it's that attitude that's without the fear of the lord they're not working out their salvation with fear and trembling they're working it out with i know the i know will send more people to hell than anything because see satan takes the knowledge of your good that you know and he says things like god death no you're going to be just like him god knows don't just look don't you rather you know go to heaven and then be able to do what you want in your flesh on earth that's what he offered eve james chapter 1 verse 21 wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness just get rid of that type of thinking and receive with meekness notice not arrogancy but meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls now the thing is you might say well brother john i was saved ten years ago well if jesus was here in corporate body what he say to you but my brother my sister my son my daughter don't you realize it's to him that endureth to the end the same is said would he say to you today is the day of salvation i'm bringing you a new word i believe in inserts eternal security i do believe in predestination but i believe in all growing and obeying in the word that's being presented to me you can't just take one and leave the other if you're going to do that take the one where you obey there will be more people who thought they were predestinated and miss it so just believing in predestination and believe in your elected seed does not put you in john said bring forth fruit meat for repentance you don't just repent you just don't get baptized you bring forth fruit god wants to see fruit that we're predestinated that means i'm different today than i was a year ago that means i have grown that means i'm more in his likeness in his image because remember in church satan still has the same desire to see his image in you and it's real simple to get you to think that you don't have to be serious about the word that you've got the most important things handled and everything else is just you know filler some sort of thinking that you can walk out without fear and trembling no god i gotta please you more i heard from heaven i know what you want me to do lord that's why we need to come into church soft meek humble broken he's not god will heal you god will give you his strength but you come in thinking you know enough and you're here for other motives he's deceiving us we're becoming more in the image of lucifer and don't even realize it verse 22 he says but be doers of the word and not hearers only what happens you're deceiving your own self that's exactly the same image of lucifer for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like like unto a man be holding his natural face in a glass but he beholdeth himself and go straightway out of the doors of the church and he forgets exactly what kind of man he was when he was looking amen just kind of forgot about the word that was preached like you know i must have got what i needed and didn't need i must be okay because i didn't really get anything [Laughter] it's it's it's terrible the attitude but it's not the mind of christ not the conscious mind that god has but whosoever looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continues power from god this is what god wants me to do he being not a forgetful hero but to do of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed in other words this is the man that's going to come into the image of christ he's the one that's going to be changed from glory unto glory he will be blessed if we're interested only or mainly in making it to heaven and not to hell we haven't reached the love affair that needs to make it to get in come to church we ought to be developing our love affair amen we're not just trying to stamp our eternal security deeper and you know drive the stakes in more but developing our love affair he said if you love me keep my commandments a lot of times our flesh don't even want to hear him i got enough to do now i got to do that come on what's this thing all about this thing is about you coming into the image of christ that's what this thing's about it ain't for everybody how many people are literally in church if they really knew what was required of them they would stop going to church but you won't find one person not a single person on the day of judgment that goes to hell that wish he wouldn't have tried harder when he had a chance so what are we up against we're up against our fleshly nature that doesn't want to hear the truth it wants uh to be entertained it wants to be comforted only strengthen tell me how i can get the promises and there's no mindset about the image of christ which really that is what god has for us i personally could never come up with the thought you know healing i mean what healing is just the bait on the hook i'm sorry that to me seems harsh it's not the main thing that god wants from us is to heal us and to see us prosper in our health but he wants to see our soul prospered that's what he's after it's the relationship the healing just got your attention hey now that you're you're feeling real good and praising god god brought you through this now i want something to talk to you i want to talk to you about a relationship i want my image to be seen in you this is where the majority of the people are satisfied with the loaves the fishes the healings the natural needs taken care of and aren't interested in that love affair because truly to love god you know this you you that are married when you think about i need to love my spouse more you're you automatically think humbling myself giving myself over pleasing the other right when you think about the responsibility of loving your spouse more it's that relationship part no different with god it's no different with god god is interested in the relationship all right i just want to finish that last verse if any man among you seem to be religious and bright on out his tongue but he deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain now he don't believe that he thinks he's as religious as all get out but if you can't write all your tongue that is exactly uh what lucifer had at the beginning he didn't bridle his tongue in the beginning satan said i will be like the most high i will exalt my throne above the throne of god or i will exalt my will above god's will so his vision was to have everyone exalt their own will above the will of god his vision to see his image manifested in humanity to where everyone was exalting their will so much above god they didn't even think about god they didn't like to retain god i think it's romans 1 28 says and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mine you talk to some people who are sold out to sin they don't want to talk about god they've crossed the line how many people have crossed the line i know i want to cross the line for god that's what i want to do i'm going to cross that line for god i want to press towards that i want to be able to to apprehend the same thing that god has apprehended one time jesus turned and he said to to peter in matthew chapter 16 verse 23 he said get thee behind me satan thou art an offense unto me for thou savers not the things that be of god but those that be of men see the same number satan and man become the same thou art in offense in other words the ministry that satan speaks to our mind is a ministry that opposes what christ is really trying to teach us true amen that's right and what was jesus trying to teach peter and his disciples at that point that you have to suffer amen and they did they weren't wanting to do that when jesus said if you're going to come after me if you're going to follow me you need to deny yourself and no that's suffering any time that you decide i'm not going to eat that those double stuffed oreo cookies i i i'm not going to watch that program i i'm not going to it's a suffering it's a pain it hurts because your flesh wants to go after it and the the things that savorous men is they want the way of least resistance to make it to heaven to make it to rapture to me to be god's elect that word savorist it means if you look it up it means to exercise the mind satan loves to exercise the mind with things that entertain the nature that they were born with so see satan is not trying to convince man that he is wrong and that he needs to be more evil he wants to give man what their flesh wants and that makes him more evil see the difference the way to become more in satan's image is to do more what your flesh wants that's how he's deceiving the whole world saint loves to exercise man's mind with things that exalt their own will above what god wants him to do you want to do this go do it nobody's stopping you that's more in satan's image god has a vision to see man back in his image and satan has a vision to see man in his image and this is the great battle brother adam said it's the greatest battle ever being fought satan has set out to share his vision to others adapt to the same vision of his own now let's just try to i'm going to try to stop after i get through this because time's up and honestly i didn't even get through half of what i have didn't get to half but that's okay i want to take my time i want to make sure you understand this genesis chapter 3 verse 4 the serpent said unto eve ye shall not surely die first thing consequences are not what you think they're going to be this is the first thing satan tells us and don't worry about the circumstances hey just go steal this thing you're not going to get caught don't think about the circumstances so satan says you shall not surely die you're still predestinated you don't have to be faithful you don't have to go to church every service you don't have to to listen to the tapes brother john he'll just tell you brother bruce he'll just tell you i mean somehow i'm just perfected by the five five-fold ministry that's all i gotta do is listen to the fightful ministry i'll be afraid i don't need to i don't need to be a doer the word just be a hearer of the word see he he doesn't get you to think about the consequences second thing look at all you're able to gain by doing your will over god's that's what he tried to do with eve look what you're going to gain for god does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil in other words you're not in that place yet you're not there but if you do this you're gonna get something out of it now isn't that how satan gets us to sin come on be honest satan exercised eve's mind with a lust for knowledge to be like god to know everything an easier path to get to just partake of this beautiful idea you will be in control of bringing forth without god anymore in other words you won't have to speak the word you can just go do it that's what satan presents to us and through that fall she literally became more into the image of of satan because she partook of the tree the tree is here we can't get away from it you can't say well i'm getting out of that church i'm getting away from that tree i'm sorry as soon as you get in the car that tree's there as soon as you go down the the road you see the billboard that's their thoughts you can't get away from it the thing you have to learn is don't partake of it verse six and when the woman saw look at this and when the woman saw that the tree was good this looks like a good idea and that it was pleasant to the eyes not to the soul it was to the flesh a tree to be desired to make who don't want to be wise she took of the fruit thereof and she ate she gave also the idea to her spouse and he did eat boy that caused a real problem but you know this stuff happens all the time in our homes happens in our families we just don't recognize it because we're so sold out on how predestinated we are well she was predestinated oh we don't got time but god willing we're going to fight she didn't even repent adam never repented well we can see the most subtle beast he didn't repent certainly the serpent didn't repent and that's what you need to get back to the image of god that's where this is going to there's one way we talked about this is the image of of satan and and what he's trying to get us to that we don't need to repent but when the word comes forth and we see we haven't been doing what he's asked us to do the only way to get to his image is to repent and this church needs to be zealous about it amen to give back to the image of christ because we're just not going to be predestinated into it i'll tell you i've been in this message long enough to know that nothing just seems to be happening all by itself in fact the more i do nothing the more i become nothing right amen the more i crucify my flesh as the prophet said if he can just get one man in his hand he can't get you in his hand if you're do you want to do this look at me how's he gonna use that you got to become nothing oh i can use that there's a mute thing let me use it that's what god's looking for man let's stand together god bless you i know it wasn't probably what you were anticipating when you came but we want to uncover expose the enemy who speaks to us and tries to get us to relax in this laodicean age that we're living in amen let's it's just thing creating me a clean heart amen just spend a little bit of time just you and the lord kind of focus on him forget about what music we have what music we don't have who's here and just yield him for just a few moments before we're dismissed [Music] [Music] [Applause] within [Music] oh and we
