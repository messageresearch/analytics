[0:31] of a good man
[0:33] are ordered by the lord and he
[0:36] delighteth in his way
[0:38] though he fall he shall not be utterly
[0:42] cast down
[0:44] for the lord upholdeth him with his hand

[0:54] verse number 16.
[0:58] for a just i'm sorry you're some some of
[1:01] you are still
[1:02] turning it's so beautiful to hear the
[1:03] pages going
[1:06] proverbs chapter 24 verse 16 for a just
[1:08] man falleth
[1:10] not just once but seven times
[1:14] and riseth up again but the wicked shall
[1:17] fall
[1:17] into mischief amen let's bow in a word
[1:21] of prayer heavenly father
[1:23] we thank you for your precious word and
[1:25] these words are encouraging to us today
[1:28] lord knowing that none of us were are
[1:31] perfect and we found our
[1:33] ourselves following not just once or
[1:35] twice but
[1:37] many times we think about the words of
[1:39] your prophet that said we
[1:41] we even backslide 100 times a day
[1:46] it's in our thoughts lord just coming
[1:48] short of your glory and what you really
[1:49] desire and expect of us
[1:52] and today lord we're thankful that you
[1:55] lift us up and hold us up and reach down
[1:58] and grab us to get back up again
[2:02] lord i pray for every believer here
[2:03] today everyone in the sound of my voice
[2:06] lord
[2:07] no matter what their situation is no
[2:09] matter how they feel
[2:10] lord may they know that they do stan
[2:13] have within them the strength to get
[2:15] back up
[2:16] lord to keep walking in the direction
[2:18] that you've called us
[2:20] lord it's a hard walk it's not for the
[2:22] faint in heart for sure
[2:24] lord but you've called us to perfection
[2:27] and i pray that you bless us now lord as
[2:29] we gather around your word
[2:31] and you come and lift us up into
[2:33] heavenly places we'll give you the glory
[2:35] for these things lord
[2:36] for we humbly ask it in jesus christ's
[2:38] name amen
[2:40] amen god bless you may be seated
[2:43] well god is the giver of life amen
[2:46] he's the author and the creator of our
[2:49] life
[2:50] the fact that we were approximately one
[2:53] out of a million people that were born
[2:56] right amen that he chose you one
[2:59] out of a million it's something to think
[3:02] about god chose you and he chose to give
[3:05] you life and then he turns right back
[3:07] around and he places within you a choice
[3:10] what you want to do with that life
[3:13] you can give that life back to god as
[3:15] your creator recognizing where you came
[3:18] from or you can make the choice
[3:22] to selfishly use it for yourself as if
[3:25] there
[3:25] you weren't created by god
[3:28] those are the choices amen joshua
[3:32] one time stood up before a nation of
[3:34] people and said in joshua chapter 24
[3:36] versus
[3:37] verse 15 and if it seemed evil unto you
[3:40] to serve the lord
[3:43] a lot of people it seems evil
[3:47] choose you this day whom you will serve
[3:49] whether the gods which your father
[3:51] served that were on the other side of
[3:53] the flood or the gods of their amorites
[3:54] in whose
[3:55] land you dwell but as for me
[3:59] in in my house i am making a
[4:03] choice we will serve the lord amen
[4:07] today we stand facing the same choice
[4:10] today
[4:12] it's not only a choice that we make when
[4:14] we first come to the lord
[4:15] to choose to to follow him but it is a
[4:19] choice that we have to make
[4:20] every single day of our lives
[4:24] now we're stuck inside this selfish
[4:27] flesh this is selfish i am just as my
[4:29] flesh is just as selfish as yours
[4:34] flesh is flesh
[4:38] that's why we need to follow the word
[4:41] that jesus spoke the example that he set
[4:44] for to
[4:44] to die daily to that thing so christ can
[4:48] live in us
[4:50] paul never said i'm not dead never said
[4:56] uh
[4:57] jesus died for me i don't got to do
[4:58] anything
[5:00] so we got to follow that example right
[5:03] amen we're not going to preach this
[5:04] morning's message
[5:08] but when we don't fully die we end up
[5:11] falling from our old stenfastness into
[5:15] traps that the enemy has set for us
[5:18] and right there we have to make a choice
[5:21] again
[5:23] and it's just as critical as the choice
[5:25] we made when we first
[5:26] surrendered our life to jesus christ
[5:28] amen it's a choice to get up
[5:31] and serve the lord amen
[5:34] it doesn't become less important
[5:38] it's just as important because jesus
[5:41] said he that endure to the end
[5:44] he shall be saved right amen so we have
[5:47] to keep getting up
[5:49] and enduring to the end for a just man
[5:52] follows seven times and riseth up again
[5:55] but the wicked shall fall into mischief
[5:58] amen
[5:59] a just man a righteous man a man of
[6:02] faith the bible says the just
[6:04] shall live by faith they they have a
[6:06] revelation
[6:07] and yet he can fall seven times
[6:13] [Music]
[6:16] it's important to see
[6:20] how valuable our choices are
[6:25] it's not up to somebody else
[6:28] to pick us up
[6:34] if that's true then i'm just not going
[6:36] to do nothing i'm going to make
[6:37] everybody
[6:38] help me
[6:42] it's not the right spirit it's not the
[6:43] right attitude
[6:45] the bible says every man shall bear his
[6:47] own burden
[6:50] now the difference between the just and
[6:52] the unjust is simply
[6:54] the wicked do not get back up
[6:58] they have chosen to stay down when they
[7:01] fall in their own mischief
[7:04] we all fall into mischief we all make
[7:06] mistakes we all make wrong choices
[7:08] we all get spiritually lazy we all fall
[7:12] in doing our own will
[7:13] and judging others and not esteeming
[7:15] others better than ourselves
[7:17] we've all failed to represent christ
[7:20] properly
[7:22] we can all get more concerned about our
[7:24] own reputation
[7:26] than the reputation of christ
[7:29] we can all fall into our own purpose and
[7:31] plans and forgetting his and
[7:33] really the value of a soul
[7:36] we can all fall into strife and drama
[7:38] and debating hateful and
[7:40] ill thoughts not wanting to wash not
[7:43] willing
[7:44] to wash somebody else's feet no more
[7:48] the difference between the just and the
[7:49] unjust is simply
[7:51] the just get back up from their
[7:53] condition
[7:54] [Music]
[7:55] well the unjust don't mind living in
[7:58] that condition
[7:59] they get used to it but the just shall
[8:02] live by faith
[8:03] they get back up because they're
[8:05] believers
[8:07] and when they fall seven times in a row
[8:10] all seven
[8:11] times they get back up
[8:17] we all can be just today all we gotta do
[8:21] is get back
[8:21] up amen don't gotta be perfect just get
[8:24] back
[8:25] up maybe that's why peter asked
[8:29] if for giving someone to jesus he said
[8:32] do i just forgive somebody seven times
[8:34] maybe he found this scripture in the
[8:36] bible i don't know
[8:38] but we know seven times is not enough to
[8:42] forgive somebody
[8:43] yes amen
[8:46] in the mind of god there is no number
[8:49] that he's put on forgiving you
[8:52] none amen how many times has jesus
[8:54] forgiven you
[8:55] since you came to him amen i wonder why
[8:58] it was the oldest
[9:00] that began to to to leave first when he
[9:02] asked he that's without sin
[9:07] moses was a murderer
[9:11] and all of god's people down through the
[9:13] ages have fallen and had to get back up
[9:16] amen moses was a murderer and yet god
[9:20] used him to change
[9:21] the world to turn the world as the world
[9:23] upside down brother brown said
[9:24] amen he had a a major problem
[9:28] of feeling inadequate anybody can
[9:31] anybody relate to that
[9:32] oh yeah he was not a very good speaker
[9:36] anybody can relate to that oh yeah
[9:40] yet god chose him to advance god's
[9:42] kingdom
[9:45] the children of israel they murmured and
[9:47] complained
[9:48] all the way yes right
[9:52] yet god had a seed in the midst of that
[9:56] amen
[10:00] why cries unto me he said to moses
[10:03] speak unto the children of israel that
[10:06] they go
[10:06] forward yes in other words get up from
[10:09] your situation
[10:11] and move forward don't stay in that
[10:14] condition
[10:16] the christian armor does not have
[10:18] anything
[10:19] for its back there's no retreat
[10:25] go forward amen
[10:28] i know it looks like it could be bleak
[10:30] but go forward amen
[10:33] moses struck the rock twice
[10:37] we should never crucify christ again
[10:40] amen
[10:41] but god didn't throw moses away
[10:44] moses got back up and he served the lord
[10:48] he continued to lead the children of
[10:50] israel
[10:52] towards the promised land to get up and
[10:55] serve the lord again
[10:57] for he was a just man amen he was a
[11:00] righteous man
[11:02] even though he fell he didn't he didn't
[11:04] follow he let the anger get beside him
[11:07] and he said something
[11:08] he shouldn't have said he did something
[11:10] he shouldn't did
[11:11] but yet he got back up he repented and
[11:14] he moved forward
[11:17] did you know 80 of the ministry during
[11:19] the time
[11:20] of moses spearheaded
[11:24] wasn't willing to suffer
[11:28] 80 percent of the ministry of his in his
[11:31] hour
[11:32] they didn't want to lay down their lives
[11:35] they didn't believe it was necessary to
[11:38] lay down their lives
[11:41] to go over they said we'll serve the
[11:44] lord on this side
[11:45] you're right right you don't have to do
[11:48] that because those are giants over there
[11:50] it's hard to give up your will
[11:54] it's terrible
[11:58] that's scary these were
[12:01] 80 of the message believers in that hour
[12:08] here we see joshua and caleb they had to
[12:11] suffer an extra 40 years
[12:13] just because of the attitude of the
[12:16] majority of the message believers
[12:18] amen they didn't cop the same attitude
[12:23] they have
[12:24] whoa it's not fair you know we should
[12:27] have to suffer
[12:28] 40 extra years because of them
[12:32] no sir they got up and they went to
[12:34] church and they served the lord every
[12:37] day
[12:38] he said we're more than able to take the
[12:41] promised land
[12:42] they maintain the right mental attitude
[12:45] all the way through
[12:47] yes there's a negative attitude in the
[12:49] church i know that
[12:50] god knows that amen
[12:54] that doesn't mean we change ours
[13:01] god's calling the elect to act like
[13:04] they're elect
[13:06] joshua and caleb were of another spirit
[13:09] amen
[13:09] they couldn't murmur and complain there
[13:11] was something different about them
[13:13] they had the holy ghost
[13:18] that's what made them get up continue to
[13:20] serve the lord
[13:21] amen joshua chapter 14 verse 10
[13:26] caleb said and now behold the lord have
[13:29] kept me alive
[13:31] as he said these 40 you know i was
[13:33] thinking i'm not going to like read any
[13:34] scriptures you know
[13:35] i'm going to give this message to just
[13:37] tell stories and
[13:39] i just can't do it i try so hard
[13:44] i love the word and he said these 40 and
[13:47] five years
[13:48] even since the lord spake his word unto
[13:51] moses
[13:51] while the children of israel wandered in
[13:53] the wilderness and now lo
[13:55] i am this day 85 years old
[13:58] as as yet i am as strong this day
[14:03] as it was in the day of that moses sent
[14:05] me
[14:06] as my strength was then even so is my
[14:09] strength now
[14:10] for war both to go out and to come in
[14:14] now therefore give me this mountain
[14:17] amen whereof the lord spake in that day
[14:20] for thou heardest in that day how the
[14:22] amakites
[14:24] were then and that the cities were great
[14:26] and fans
[14:27] for if so be the lord will be with me
[14:30] then
[14:30] i shall be able to drive them out as the
[14:32] lord said
[14:33] and joshua blessed him and gave unto
[14:36] caleb
[14:37] the son of genoa to noah
[14:43] uh inheritance
[14:50] see it's going to be easy for the saints
[14:52] in heaven to remember my name to call my
[14:53] name
[14:54] but i'm trying to have a hard time with
[14:56] all these names in the old testament
[15:01] think about it his attitude was just the
[15:04] same
[15:05] his inner strength was just the same
[15:07] you're right amen
[15:10] and now he waited 45 years
[15:13] not because he failed
[15:17] because he was part of a body yes
[15:20] that's why the strong needs bear the
[15:22] infirmities of the weak amen
[15:26] so we need to stand in the gap
[15:31] it's easy to call out people's problems
[15:35] but who's going to stay in there and
[15:36] wash their feet do you know
[15:38] it's love that covers a multitude of sin
[15:40] amen
[15:41] joshua chapter 1 verse 3
[15:45] what a beautiful attitude joshua has
[15:51] no we hear god speaking
[15:55] every place that the soul of your feet
[15:57] shall tread upon
[15:59] that have i given you as i said unto
[16:02] moses
[16:04] in other words get up and keep walking
[16:07] amen
[16:08] and where you walk it's yours what you
[16:10] claim
[16:11] is yours what you say i'm going through
[16:14] is yours
[16:15] would you say i can't i'm afraid it's
[16:18] not yours it's not for you
[16:20] it's for the believer
[16:26] verse 5 then shall not there shall not
[16:28] be any man be able to stand before thee
[16:30] all the days of thy life
[16:32] as i was with moses so i be with thee i
[16:34] would not fail thee nor for safety
[16:37] what a precious promise you know that is
[16:39] to every one of us
[16:41] yes
[16:44] now the devil is going to try to stand
[16:46] in your life and he's going to use a lot
[16:51] of situations
[16:55] but you got to just take a stand
[16:59] you got to believe greater is he that's
[17:01] in me than he that's in the world
[17:04] verse six be strong be of good courage
[17:07] for unto this people
[17:08] shall thou divide for inheritance the
[17:10] land which i swear
[17:11] unto their fathers to give them only be
[17:14] thou strong and very courageous
[17:17] that thou mayest observe
[17:21] to do accordingly to all that all the
[17:23] law which
[17:24] moses my servant commanded thee turn not
[17:26] from it to the right hand or to the left
[17:28] that thou mayest prosper whether so ever
[17:30] thou goest
[17:32] get up and keep observing to do the word
[17:35] yes if i could say it like this get up
[17:38] and follow the example get up
[17:42] and follow the example verse 8 this
[17:46] book of the law shall not depart out of
[17:48] thy mouth
[17:49] but thou shalt meditate therein day and
[17:52] night
[17:53] amen that thou mayest observe
[17:56] to do all that is written therein notice
[17:59] the
[18:00] purpose of reading the book the purpose
[18:03] in reading the book
[18:04] is so you can obey it
[18:07] if there's another reason get away from
[18:12] it for then thou
[18:14] shall make thy way prosperous and then
[18:17] thou
[18:18] shall have good success
[18:21] have not i commanded thee get up and be
[18:24] strong
[18:25] and be of good courage be not afraid
[18:27] neither be thou dismayed for the lord
[18:29] thy god is with you whethers whoever
[18:31] thou goes
[18:32] that's good enough for me i mean you
[18:34] know when you're down
[18:38] and the person that's looking at you is
[18:40] up here and you're down there
[18:44] and it doesn't look like you got a
[18:45] friend it's hard to get up
[18:47] right but if you can visualize that
[18:51] jesus said i'll never leave you i'll
[18:52] never forsake you right he's there
[18:54] reaching like this
[18:56] just grab his hand he'll help you up
[18:59] amen
[19:00] he'll get you up back where you need to
[19:01] be amen
[19:05] elijah was a mighty prophet
[19:08] he faced 400 prophets one time
[19:12] and these prophets they believed the
[19:16] same word
[19:19] there was just one little thing that was
[19:22] missing in their ministry
[19:26] and he was able to face all of them men
[19:30] with the word of god united
[19:34] in one accord just wasn't god's
[19:38] cord and because
[19:42] they left out part of the word
[19:46] and yet we find him running
[19:49] from just one woman
[19:54] who wasn't a prophet he didn't have the
[19:58] word
[19:59] she believed in makeup
[20:03] it's awful quiet i didn't mean that in
[20:05] any negative way but
[20:07] look god made this perfect
[20:10] amen amen amen i know
[20:14] we can make ourselves better i
[20:18] i understand that
[20:22] but if i went to do something
[20:25] it's like telling god i didn't like what
[20:28] you did
[20:36] i didn't want to say anything like that
[20:39] that just
[20:39] came amen but yet
[20:44] he was feeling all alone
[20:47] he ran from her and he fell all alone
[20:50] that there was no one
[20:52] with him he was left all alone after he
[20:54] destroyed those
[20:55] prophets and in first kings chapter 19
[20:58] verse 11 let's pick it up there and
[21:02] god said get up elijah go forth and
[21:05] stand
[21:06] unto the mountain before the lord and
[21:08] behold the lord pass by in a great
[21:10] strong
[21:11] wind rent the mountains and break into
[21:13] pieces the rocks before the lord and the
[21:15] lord was not in the wind
[21:16] after the wind and earthquake but the
[21:18] lord was not an earthquake
[21:20] and after the earthquake of fire
[21:23] but the lord was not in the fire amen
[21:25] and after the fire
[21:27] there's a still small voice
[21:31] and it was so when elijah heard it that
[21:34] he wrapped his face
[21:35] in his mantle went out and stood in the
[21:37] entrance of the cave and behold
[21:39] there came a voice onto him and said
[21:44] what are you doing here yes sir that's
[21:46] right
[21:47] what is going on elijah
[21:52] you know oftentimes we find ourselves
[21:55] sitting around moping about our current
[21:58] situation
[22:02] god said get up there's 7 000 others
[22:05] that have not
[22:06] bowed their knee to their own will right
[22:10] amen
[22:12] amen it's time for us to get up saints
[22:14] there's still souls
[22:16] to be rescued there's souls to be saved
[22:18] there's a light to send out to others
[22:22] i don't know if there's 7 700 or
[22:26] seven but we need to be about our
[22:27] father's business and we need to get up
[22:30] and and do our job that's what god told
[22:32] elijah
[22:35] yes yes sir jonah
[22:38] i want you to go preach to nineveh
[22:41] they need to repent of their sins
[22:44] and and turn towards me
[22:49] well jonah didn't
[22:53] really want to try to help nineveh
[22:59] like a lot of us who are content with
[23:03] just knowing god ourselves
[23:05] not too interested in helping others
[23:09] so he just runs
[23:14] to do his own will do his own thing
[23:18] and where did it lead him it led him
[23:21] to the end of the road of his road
[23:26] i mean he was he was in a pickle
[23:30] god got him in a condition they had to
[23:33] really think about
[23:35] the choices that he was making right now
[23:38] he didn't force him
[23:40] but he put him in a position to look at
[23:43] his choice that he made
[23:48] and he prayed he turned his
[23:51] his his uh his heart towards the lord
[23:54] and he repented let's pick it up from
[23:57] his selfish
[23:58] nature jonah chapter two verse one jonah
[24:01] chapter two verse one
[24:03] then jonah prayed unto the lord his god
[24:06] out of the fish's
[24:07] belly now we might say
[24:13] then john prayed unto the lord his god
[24:16] out of his fishy situation
[24:20] amen and said i cried by the reason of
[24:24] my afflictions unto the lord
[24:26] and he heard me out of the belly of hell
[24:28] yes sir
[24:29] cried i that and thou heard us my voice
[24:33] for thou hat for thou hast cast me into
[24:37] the deep
[24:38] into the midst of the sea
[24:41] and the floods come pass me about all
[24:44] thy billows and thy ways pass me over
[24:46] notice
[24:47] he is he was actually saying the
[24:49] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[24:51] of the lord
[24:53] that's what he's saying here the lord
[24:56] orchestrated everything
[25:00] then i said i am cast out of thy sight
[25:02] yet
[25:03] i will look again toward thy holy temple
[25:07] the waters can pass me about even to my
[25:09] soul the death close
[25:11] me round about and the weeds were
[25:13] wrapped around my head
[25:14] and i went down to the bottoms of the
[25:16] mountains
[25:18] the earth with her bars were about me
[25:20] forever
[25:22] yet has thou brought up my life from
[25:25] corruption
[25:25] o lord my god yes and when my soul
[25:29] fainted within me i remembered the lord
[25:35] that's all we got to do remember the
[25:37] lord and get back up
[25:40] and my prayer came in unto thee into thy
[25:43] holy temple
[25:45] it started in the midst of a dark ugly
[25:48] situation
[25:49] but it it weeded through all the seaweed
[25:51] and all the vomit and the skin of the
[25:53] fish
[25:54] and it went directly to god's temple
[25:58] we don't got to be a church we just got
[26:01] to have church in our hearts
[26:05] he said they that observe lying vanities
[26:08] forsake their own mercies
[26:15] that's exactly what happened to the
[26:16] children of israel when they
[26:18] went spied out the land
[26:21] they were looking at lion vanities and
[26:24] they forsook
[26:25] their own mercies but praise god
[26:29] we're gentiles god deals with us as
[26:31] individuals
[26:32] and we can have a different spirit when
[26:34] we look at our situation
[26:36] we can get the holy ghost we can be
[26:38] overcomers
[26:39] when we just get up
[26:43] amen but i will sacrifice unto thee
[26:46] the voice of thanksgiving i will pay
[26:48] that i have vowed
[26:50] amen salvation is of the lord yes
[26:53] and the lord spake unto
[26:57] jonah's situation and it vomited out
[27:01] jonah upon dry land amen
[27:05] you know what jonah did he literally got
[27:08] up
[27:10] and he went and did exactly what god had
[27:13] told her to do the first time
[27:16] for a just man falls seven times and it
[27:18] riseth up again
[27:20] and do what god's called him to do
[27:23] don't look at the fall don't look at the
[27:25] mistakes don't count how many times
[27:27] just get up and do it again
[27:32] keep marching forward
[27:35] notice in jonah chapter one verse two
[27:38] jonah chapter one verse two
[27:43] god says arise go to nineveh that great
[27:46] city that
[27:47] that and cry against it for the
[27:48] wickedness has come up before me
[27:51] now notice two chapters later
[27:55] i just want to start with in chapter
[27:57] three verse one and the word of the lord
[27:58] coming to john and the second time
[28:00] sin arise go to nineveh that great city
[28:02] and preach unto it
[28:05] onto it the preaching that i baby
[28:09] in other words we can forget
[28:12] what god spoke to us before
[28:15] but god hasn't forgotten amen
[28:18] you can go through many trials and many
[28:20] situations and many things but
[28:22] god will bring you right back amen
[28:25] if god has asked you to do something see
[28:28] to it that you do it amen
[28:30] don't put it off
[28:35] so jonah arose in verse 3
[28:38] and went to nineveh according to the
[28:40] word of the lord now nineveh
[28:42] was exceeding great city amen the king
[28:45] james version
[28:46] said oh it says arise as we read it
[28:49] arise
[28:50] but the new living translation the
[28:52] christian standard bible and many
[28:54] other versions use the word get up
[28:59] which was nice because i was three
[29:00] quarters of the way in this message when
[29:02] i read that that was exciting to me
[29:03] and not only that i walked out two times
[29:06] and showed brother marty
[29:07] songs i had written down to sing at the
[29:09] end of the service that brother ron had
[29:11] already picked
[29:12] i had to cross that off the list cross
[29:14] that off the list
[29:18] i say church get up amen it's time for
[29:21] us to go into all the world
[29:23] amen and preach the gospel make as
[29:25] brother brandon said make converts to
[29:27] jesus christ
[29:28] get up and be wise and be about the
[29:30] father's business
[29:33] get up and go baptize people in the name
[29:35] of jesus christ
[29:37] teaching them to observe all things
[29:39] whatsoever i've commanded you
[29:41] and lo and with you just as he is with
[29:43] joshua he's with us too
[29:45] amen we just got to do what he told us
[29:47] to do
[29:48] to observe to do all that's according to
[29:50] the law don't make this gospel your
[29:53] personal gospel
[29:54] come into the gospel the word and get
[29:56] dressed with the whole word
[30:01] satan wants us to cherry-pick things
[30:05] call it christianity that's not true
[30:07] christianity
[30:09] that's what peter tried doing end up
[30:12] following jesus from afar
[30:15] believe in them but i kind of you know
[30:17] certain things i do certain things i
[30:18] don't
[30:19] right i mean the ministry at the church
[30:21] you know it's good
[30:23] you know
[30:26] i go but i'm not into it
[30:32] peter always wanted to lead the pack
[30:37] lord if that you walking on the water
[30:39] bid me to come
[30:41] well peter jumps out of the boat after
[30:43] jesus said come
[30:45] he jumped out with both feet got got
[30:47] right there started walking on the water
[30:49] he stepped out by faith
[30:53] and god honored it amen and when we
[30:56] began when he began
[30:58] to look at the situation
[31:02] how difficult and what could possibly
[31:05] happen
[31:06] wasn't happening but what could possibly
[31:09] happen in his situation
[31:10] he began to doubt that god was going to
[31:13] take him through
[31:14] amen as soon as he began to doubt he
[31:17] began
[31:18] to sink yes
[31:21] sir but praise god he called out
[31:25] jesus lord save me amen and jesus just
[31:29] reached down amen
[31:34] [Applause]
[31:45] i've trained you better than that
[31:49] i gave you faith to cast out demons
[31:54] oh ye of little faith
[31:58] it's easy to pray for somebody else
[32:03] it's hard to have that same faith for
[32:04] yourself amen
[32:07] the bible says and when when they come
[32:10] into the ship the wind it cease
[32:13] and that that when they were all on the
[32:14] ship they worshipped
[32:16] and saying all the truth thou art the
[32:19] son of god
[32:21] i'll tell you today we're in the safe
[32:23] haven of god's holy spirit
[32:26] it should be no problem as brother ron
[32:28] said to worship the lord in spirit
[32:30] and in truth amen
[32:34] peter wanted to prove he was the
[32:35] greatest of the disciples
[32:39] he wanted to fight for jesus to the very
[32:41] end
[32:43] but as we know he denied the lord three
[32:46] times
[32:48] i could just see jesus looking over from
[32:51] the cross and whispering
[32:53] get up peter when thou art converted
[32:57] strengthen thy brethren see jesus
[33:00] knew it was going to happen just like
[33:02] jesus knew every time you
[33:04] fell what's going to happen get up
[33:08] get up be be righteous be just
[33:11] and get up don't judge yourself as
[33:15] unrighteous because of what you've done
[33:20] if you stay down that's wrong
[33:25] that's what makes you unrighteous so it
[33:27] makes you unjust
[33:29] it's what makes us wicked
[33:32] yes we got to stand up for jesus
[33:38] get back up amen
[33:42] that's what makes you righteous right
[33:43] there the fact that you get up from your
[33:46] situation
[33:47] says you are a believer yes
[33:50] you're a defined gravity you define the
[33:54] devil's wishes
[33:56] and you're identifying yourself in this
[33:58] bible that says you're a
[33:59] righteous man if you get back up that's
[34:02] where i want to be identified
[34:06] failure doesn't disqualify you
[34:11] staying down disqualifies you
[34:14] so get out amen god doesn't call the
[34:18] qualified
[34:20] he qualifies those that he's called amen
[34:23] now get up and let him qualify you
[34:27] in other words finish the race that he
[34:28] started
[34:30] has he called you to this place or has
[34:33] he caught you to perfection
[34:36] amen the other day
[34:39] brother mark came over and he had a
[34:41] little his little costco card
[34:45] so i thought i'd play a little joke and
[34:46] i put it on and i just start talking
[34:49] i just got home from work you know a lot
[34:53] of times we want the badge
[34:54] i'm in the message i've attained
[34:58] i'm there this is all there is for me
[35:01] and they're not reaching for anything
[35:03] right
[35:06] what is your goal get up from your
[35:09] situation
[35:10] and reach forth for what's in front of
[35:13] you what you don't have yet
[35:19] well it's been 45 years talk to joshua
[35:21] talk to caleb
[35:22] go get your mountain that's right
[35:28] it's time to get up and run the race
[35:30] with patience
[35:33] simon do you love me more than anyone
[35:39] so jesus asked him yea lord thou
[35:42] knowest that i love us the
[35:46] female lambs he said
[35:49] simon senator jonas now loves me
[35:52] you know lord will feed my sheep
[35:58] simon do you really
[36:01] love me the bible says peter
[36:04] was grieved at the word
[36:09] because he heard it three times
[36:13] i wonder how many was grieved this
[36:14] morning
[36:16] hearing it three times brother john it
[36:19] wasn't three thousand thirty three times
[36:23] he was grieved that the word
[36:28] but peter said thou knowest all you
[36:31] know that i love thee right and jesus
[36:34] said
[36:35] then get up and feed my sheep
[36:41] amen we need to get up
[36:45] it's one thing just to say i love you
[36:47] lord i love you lord
[36:51] do you love god enough to get up
[36:55] and do his will
[37:03] one time a woman was caught in adultery
[37:05] the very act the bible says
[37:08] and jesus asked when he went through the
[37:11] situation woman where's your accusers
[37:15] and she said there are none lord
[37:18] i don't have any and these wonderful
[37:21] words that jesus spoke
[37:24] neither do i now get up
[37:28] and go sin no more right amen
[37:32] that's right humanity it don't matter
[37:34] the situation am i
[37:36] it matters the direction god's grace is
[37:39] here to meet every need
[37:40] yes amen notice the word
[37:44] had to deal with everyone else's
[37:46] conscience first before he dealt with
[37:48] herself
[37:53] you know sometimes you can be around a
[37:55] bunch of judgmental people
[37:56] that's true yeah just judge you
[38:00] right and we all got enough to be judged
[38:03] amen right
[38:07] thank god we have someone that took our
[38:09] judgment amen
[38:10] you notice these people that are around
[38:11] judging you as if
[38:16] they're a little higher than you they're
[38:18] a little better
[38:19] as if they don't have anything to be
[38:21] judged
[38:23] amen it's sad
[38:29] you know the bible says that we
[38:31] shouldn't sit in the seat of the
[38:32] scornful
[38:33] right we need to get up
[38:36] amen we need to get up off that seat
[38:39] amen
[38:40] get off the seat of judgment
[38:44] and go washed the disciples feet
[38:47] amen don't wash somebody's feet amen
[38:50] get them clean then you won't be
[38:51] pointing a finger at them
[38:53] i don't want to do that's not my job
[38:56] they should know better
[38:57] i've told them so many times
[39:02] okay explain to me what spirit that is
[39:06] explain that to me well that's the
[39:09] gospel according to
[39:10] john martin who wants to what it wants
[39:14] to listen to that gospel
[39:16] who's going to follow that gospel that
[39:17] gospel ain't going to save anybody
[39:19] amen only the gospel of jesus christ
[39:22] amen
[39:24] the disciples fell asleep three times
[39:26] during a very
[39:27] important prayer meeting
[39:31] how many times you hear jesus ask his
[39:33] disciples would you come and pray with
[39:35] me
[39:36] to come and watch
[39:42] and even asked him what could you not
[39:44] watch and pray with me
[39:46] one hour just one hour so i asked of you
[39:49] i've done so much
[39:50] for you
[40:02] peter ended up following jesus from afar
[40:06] because remember jesus said pray that
[40:08] you don't fall into temptation
[40:12] oh i got it covered i got it covered
[40:16] you know i'm real close to jesus
[40:19] well just wait to you know
[40:27] they don't want to enter into temptation
[40:31] we need to get up and follow our example
[40:38] i know it's hard to pray exactly
[40:41] all the times that we probably need to
[40:43] pray but we need
[40:45] to spend more time in prayer
[40:48] amen prayer makes us more spiritual
[40:53] prayer makes us less carnal
[40:57] prayer opens a door to hearing the same
[41:01] word
[41:01] but the correct meaning amen
[41:05] amen one time he said children have you
[41:08] any meat
[41:11] they said no he says well get up and
[41:13] cast your net on the right side of the
[41:15] ship
[41:19] a yes of times we find ourselves doing
[41:22] things
[41:23] that is not bringing forth fruit right
[41:25] just get up
[41:30] just get up from your situation don't
[41:33] don't keep fishing on the same side
[41:37] i mean more likely if anybody's ever
[41:39] done any fishing
[41:40] if you're not catching something you
[41:42] usually put a different lure on
[41:44] or you get up like brother mike he'll
[41:46] travel to another another lake
[41:55] god wants us to bear fruit amen their
[41:57] fruit would remain
[41:59] one time a couple of jesus's disciples
[42:01] were walking to him
[42:02] on the road to emmaus and they were
[42:04] talking about all the
[42:06] bad things that had just happened amen
[42:10] jesus drew near to them but jesus hid
[42:14] himself from from their presence from
[42:17] from knowing who he was and you know a
[42:19] lot of times
[42:19] i believe jesus is right in our midst
[42:21] and we don't even realize it
[42:25] he's usually veiled behind some humanity
[42:32] and he said to them what manner of
[42:34] communications are these
[42:36] that you have with that you have one
[42:38] with another as you walk
[42:40] and are sad
[42:44] and they started to tell jesus all their
[42:46] woes all their problems
[42:49] and finally had enough of their
[42:51] negativity
[42:55] and you know what he said to them come
[42:57] on boys
[43:01] everything's going to be okay i'm here
[43:02] now
[43:04] no he called his own disciples fools
[43:11] he said old fools and slow to
[43:14] heart to believe all that the prophets
[43:17] had spoken
[43:18] now notice what they left out ought not
[43:22] christ to have suffered these things and
[43:24] to enter his glory
[43:26] we want to leave out the suffering
[43:30] he wanted them to get up and follow the
[43:34] example
[43:34] amen hebrews chapter 2 verse 10
[43:38] for it became him for whom are all
[43:41] things and by whom
[43:42] are all things in bringing many sons
[43:46] unto glory to make the captain of their
[43:49] salvation
[43:50] perfect through sufferings
[43:56] i want to talk about the person that you
[43:58] want to christ
[44:02] i want to ask you did you win that
[44:04] person
[44:06] without suffering
[44:09] [Music]
[44:11] you had to give up your time
[44:16] you had to lay down your own reputation
[44:20] for christ
[44:22] you had to represent him to truly
[44:25] represent him
[44:27] it's not like being these politicians
[44:34] right
[44:36] we need to get up follow our example
[44:38] amen
[44:40] when god called abraham to leave his
[44:42] family he didn't fully realize the
[44:44] suffering that awaited him
[44:46] and i'm telling you when i first started
[44:48] that story i and just imagine
[44:50] god called abraham i'm going to make you
[44:51] a father of many nations just leave your
[44:53] family forsake all come follow me
[44:56] and it's going to happen
[45:00] wow he wasn't even able
[45:05] to go into the promised land and you had
[45:08] to wait how many years to have a son
[45:11] why didn't god say all that at the
[45:13] beginning
[45:17] why didn't god tell me i'd be stuck in
[45:19] this church brother ron
[45:22] listen to this old john martin again
[45:31] you know god has many things he'd like
[45:33] to tell us but we can't bear it right
[45:34] now
[45:38] but by faith it took abe abraham took
[45:41] god at his word
[45:43] not knowing where he was going
[45:47] but by faith he took god at his word
[45:51] and he just followed it was led by the
[45:53] spirit of god amen
[45:55] he couldn't tell anybody he couldn't
[45:56] even tell his family where he was going
[45:58] because god didn't tell him no man knows
[46:00] the day or the hour but jesus is coming
[46:02] soon
[46:03] amen amen
[46:06] you're going to be a father of many
[46:07] nations and sarah is going to have a son
[46:11] but many years went by and sarah
[46:15] still didn't have their son right
[46:18] right so abraham tried doing things his
[46:21] way
[46:23] and it caused a lot of trouble you know
[46:25] the story he got so caught up in the
[46:28] flesh
[46:29] with ishmael having ishmael being the
[46:31] promised son that when god reminded
[46:33] abraham of his promise that abraham
[46:37] said o lord that that ishmael
[46:40] right would live that he would be the
[46:44] promise
[46:47] isn't that sad
[46:51] that's how far he had gotten from the
[46:54] original promise
[46:58] but you know what abraham got up
[47:03] he told abraham get out i said sarah
[47:06] is going to have a son
[47:10] about this time next year and even in
[47:13] her old age god still promised
[47:16] and he kept his promise
[47:19] for a just man falls seven times and he
[47:21] riseth up again
[47:22] but the wicked shall fall into mischief
[47:25] abraham got up because he believed
[47:30] the just shall live by faith
[47:33] when you read the story let's go to the
[47:35] romans chapter four
[47:38] when you read the story in the new
[47:40] testament
[47:41] you don't hear of the falls
[47:45] of abraham
