[36:27] way in Jesus Christ let me pray amen
[36:31] if we could turn to the book of Hebrews
[36:33] and we'll read uh in chapter 11. a
[36:37] little bit of lengthy opening for
[36:39] opening scripture but just bear with me
[36:43] amen
[36:45] who's thankful being the house of God
[36:46] tonight amen
[36:50] so Hebrews 11 and we'll start off with
[36:52] verse 17 probably very very familiar
[36:54] scriptures they've been read many times
[36:56] by faith Abraham when he was tried
[36:59] offered up Isaac and he that received
[37:02] the promises offered up his only
[37:04] begotten son a full moon was said that
[37:07] in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[37:09] accounting that God was able to raise
[37:12] him up even from the dead from whence he
[37:14] also he received him in a figure verse
[37:16] 22 or verse 23 by faith Moses when he
[37:20] was born was hit three months of his
[37:22] parents because they saw he was a proper
[37:25] child and they were not afraid of the
[37:27] king's commandment by faith Moses when
[37:30] he was come to years refused to be
[37:32] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[37:34] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[37:36] notice he had to make a choice there
[37:38] choosing red to suffer Affliction with
[37:40] the people of God than to enjoy the
[37:42] pleasures of sin for a season
[37:44] is stimula approaches of Christ greater
[37:47] riches than the treasures in Egypt for
[37:49] he had respect unto the recompense of
[37:52] the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not
[37:54] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[37:57] endured seeing as him who was invisible
[37:59] through faith he kept the Passover and
[38:02] the sprinkling of the bloodless
[38:03] Destroyer the firstborn should touch him
[38:06] by faith they pass through the Red Sea
[38:07] as by dry land which Egyptians are
[38:10] saying to do were drowned verse 30. by
[38:12] faith the walls of Jericho fell down
[38:14] after they were compassed about seven
[38:16] days
[38:17] by faith the Harlot Rahab perished not
[38:20] with them that believe not when she had
[38:22] received the spies with peace verse 32
[38:24] and what shall I say more the time would
[38:27] fail me to tell of Gideon of Barack and
[38:29] of Samson of jephthah of David also
[38:32] Samuel and of the prophets who through
[38:34] faith subdued kingdoms wrought
[38:36] righteousness obtained promises stop the
[38:39] mouth of lions
[38:40] quenched the violence of fire escape the
[38:42] edge of sword out of weakness were made
[38:44] strong wax valid and fight
[38:46] turn to fight the armies of the aliens
[38:49] women received their dead race to life
[38:51] and others were tortured not accepting
[38:53] Deliverance that they obtained a better
[38:55] Resurrection verse 36 and others had a
[38:57] trial of cruel mockings and scourgings
[38:59] gave moreover of bonds and imprisonment
[39:02] they were stoned they were sauna Sunder
[39:04] they were tempted were slain with sword
[39:06] they wandered about the Sheep's
[39:08] sheepskins goat skins being destitute
[39:10] Afflicted tormented of whom the world
[39:13] was not worthy they wandered in deserts
[39:15] and in mountains and in dens and caves
[39:17] of the earth and these all having
[39:19] obtained a good report through faith
[39:22] receive not the promise God having
[39:24] provided some better thing for us that
[39:27] they without us should not be perfect
[39:29] amen you may be seated
[39:31] so the top the tower the the title of
[39:34] this uh sermon so it's part two of our
[39:35] series The Power of a good decision
[39:39] so I read this interesting fact uh let's
[39:41] just dive into the scriptures so just
[39:43] noticed Moses he had a choice when he
[39:46] was of age he had a choice whether to
[39:49] choose Egypt and the riches and my angel
[39:51] Egypt had many riches wealth Untold they
[39:55] were the most high-powered Nation at
[39:57] that time and Moses even had an
[39:59] opportunity to be next in line to
[40:01] Pharaoh so imagine all those things the
[40:03] devil was tempting him with had any
[40:06] woman he want but rather he made the
[40:08] choice to suffer Affliction with the
[40:10] people of God because he knew that the
[40:13] choice of sin
[40:14] only lasts for a certain amount of time
[40:16] it may feel good you may get millions of
[40:19] dollars have all these accolades Nobel
[40:21] Peace Prize whatever it is but those
[40:23] things will pass away but he knew
[40:26] Christ
[40:27] would never pass away he knew that
[40:29] opportunity would never ever pass away
[40:31] of him taking that so just a look a fun
[40:34] fact I looked up in fact some sources
[40:37] suggest that the average person makes an
[40:40] eye-popping 35 000 choices per day so
[40:43] assuming that most people spend around
[40:45] seven hours per day sleeping this
[40:47] blissfully Choice free makes roughly 2
[40:50] 000 decisions per hour or one decision
[40:52] every two seconds
[40:54] I never thought of that I was just like
[40:56] just imagine all the decisions that we
[40:58] make I was just like
[41:00] and so I wanted to read a quote get
[41:03] really tied along with the scripture
[41:04] because uh you guys probably remember
[41:06] his brother Branham uh when he was in
[41:09] the service and they spoke in French
[41:11] and he thought somebody spoken in
[41:13] tongues and somebody interpret it from
[41:14] the U.N but I just thought it was a
[41:16] perfect lined up with it because thou
[41:18] has chosen the narrow way the harder way
[41:21] that was walked in your own choosing
[41:23] now I can see that Moses had to make
[41:26] this choice too see thou has picked the
[41:29] precise and correct way correct decision
[41:31] and it is my way underline my way the
[41:35] Holy Spirit speaking back because of
[41:37] this mountainous decision a huge portion
[41:39] of Heaven awaits you awaits thee what a
[41:42] glorious decision now listen close what
[41:45] a glorious decision now has made this in
[41:48] itself is that which will make and come
[41:51] to pass a tremendous victory in love
[41:53] divine
[41:55] so brother Branham had to make a
[41:56] decision it's like Moses had to make a
[41:58] decision and just as Moses and brother
[42:00] better make a decision we have to make
[42:01] that same decision because the straight
[42:03] and narrow way is the harder way
[42:06] the the Broadway the wide way is easy I
[42:09] mean it's it's easy to your flesh
[42:11] because your flesh gravitates towards
[42:14] stimulation and whatever stimulates the
[42:16] flesh the flesh wants to gravitate
[42:18] towards that whatever it is you can fill
[42:20] in the blank whatever it could be
[42:21] pleasures of this world
[42:23] and so we have to make that same
[42:25] decision every day which path are you
[42:27] going to walk and the power of a good
[42:29] choice this isn't well I guess I'm
[42:31] trying to hit home is it's a spiritual
[42:33] choice because you can make a good
[42:35] choice in a grocery store oh that's five
[42:37] dollars off comparison to three dollars
[42:38] off but that doesn't really matter
[42:40] necessarily or you can make this choice
[42:42] in a car or this Choice well I want this
[42:45] car over this car yes I believe God can
[42:47] be in those things but we want to go
[42:50] focus on the spiritual decision of a
[42:52] good choice because each decision you
[42:54] make a good decision spiritually is
[42:56] going to lead you one step closer to
[42:57] being more in the image of God and
[42:59] that's what that's what God is looking
[43:00] for is for us to be more In His Image
[43:03] but we have to make a good choice that's
[43:06] what God has placed in our hands see God
[43:09] isn't just expecting us to sit in our
[43:12] Lazy Boy and relax but we play a part in
[43:14] making a good decision
[43:16] everything is laid before us God has
[43:18] given us a blueprint of what to do
[43:21] examples in the Bible see there's
[43:23] examples in the Bible for us to follow
[43:25] and not to follow like Samson he chose
[43:28] to he gave his heart to Delilah but not
[43:30] to God but he gave his strength so we
[43:33] have to give our heart to God every
[43:34] single day that's the power of a good
[43:36] choice you give your heart every day to
[43:38] God is a choice that we have to make
[43:40] every day because Satan wants to trick
[43:44] you he wants to use you use your
[43:46] emotions because
[43:47] emotions can be good feelings can be
[43:50] good but they I guarantee they're not
[43:52] always going to line up with God's word
[43:54] because once again these were used to
[43:59] contact our Earthly home these senses
[44:02] so
[44:04] amen
[44:06] so let's go to Romans Chapter 4 Verse 18
[44:09] to 25.
[44:11] amen
[44:13] this is very familiar scripture as well
[44:15] the father of our faith
[44:18] so Romans 4.
[44:22] amen we'll start with verse 18 I said
[44:26] all right actually let's go to verse 17
[44:27] actually as it is written I have made
[44:29] thee a father of many nations before him
[44:32] we believed even God who quickened the
[44:35] dead called those things which be is not
[44:37] they were let's go to verse 16 as well
[44:39] therefore it is a faith that it might be
[44:42] by grace to the end of the promise be
[44:44] sure to all the seed he's talking to us
[44:47] not to that only which is of the law but
[44:49] that's also which is of the faith of
[44:51] Abraham who is the father of us all
[44:53] Verse 18 who against hope believed in
[44:55] hope that he might become the father of
[44:58] many nations according to the that which
[45:00] was spoken so shall as seed be
[45:03] and being not weak in faith he
[45:05] considered not his own body now dead
[45:07] when he was about a hundred years old
[45:08] neither yet the deadness of Sarah as
[45:10] well must stop right there and we'll
[45:11] keep going we just want to point out now
[45:13] Abraham had had never saw this thing
[45:16] come to pass he've only heard God speak
[45:18] to him so Abraham had a choice either to
[45:22] take God at his word or to stay where he
[45:25] was but Abraham made that hard choice
[45:28] now choosing a good decision you're
[45:31] choosing the harder way spiritually
[45:33] speaking and every day we need to choose
[45:35] the harder way because a harder way is
[45:37] what's going to cause growth in your
[45:39] life so Abraham made a good decision he
[45:42] made the decision that was pleasing to
[45:44] God all God ask of us is to be obedient
[45:48] to his word you may not have seen see
[45:52] God is calling us to things that we've
[45:54] never been
[45:55] so we have we have to trust God on the
[45:57] process it's like he's calling me if I
[46:00] if the Lord tells I get married he's
[46:01] calling me to be a father he's calling
[46:04] me to uh to give more of myself to him
[46:07] see these things I've never seen or
[46:09] experienced but if I trust God he's
[46:11] going to take me through these things
[46:13] but I have a part to play in making that
[46:15] decision every day so each good decision
[46:17] I make is going to lead to a closer walk
[46:20] with God
[46:21] Let's Go reverse uh
[46:24] 19. and being that weak in faith he
[46:26] considered his own body now dead Abraham
[46:29] had to deny all senses or reasons
[46:31] because they did not go with the word of
[46:33] God as he was getting older I imagine
[46:36] Satan was saying think you're really
[46:37] going to have this baby you're an old
[46:39] man you're walking on crutches and Canes
[46:42] you think you're really going to have
[46:43] this baby but Abraham had to cast that
[46:45] aside and say God said this God said I'm
[46:49] having this baby I don't care what the
[46:51] doctors say I don't care what Satan says
[46:53] I don't care uh what lot says his wife
[46:55] says I'm claiming this babe because God
[46:58] has promised he's led me this far he's
[47:00] going to lead me to the finish line and
[47:02] that's how we have to be as well believe
[47:04] that God if he called you then he's
[47:06] going to finish a good work in you
[47:08] you're still here for a reason God still
[47:10] wants to use you because where his hands
[47:13] his feet he's you use his vessel he's in
[47:15] his spirit so he can use our bodies if
[47:18] God can get his hands upon one man or a
[47:20] woman fully surrendered just imagine the
[47:22] things he can do in your community your
[47:24] homes uh everything
[47:28] he staggered not at the promise of God
[47:30] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[47:32] giving glory to God verse 21 and being
[47:36] fully persuaded so you must be fully
[47:38] persuaded that God can move in your life
[47:42] but you have to recognize and see Lord
[47:45] what are you trying to do in my life
[47:46] right now what things do I need to let
[47:49] go what things do I need to add to my
[47:51] life this that open honesty that's what
[47:54] God is looking for that's what touches
[47:55] the heart of God we truly want to be
[47:58] pleasing to him
[47:59] and it's the motive don't be pleased
[48:01] because the Pastor said so but you be
[48:04] pleasing because you wouldn't be
[48:05] pleasing to God that's what's going to
[48:07] touch the heart of God I can't write the
[48:09] coattails off for brother John's uh walk
[48:11] and neither can we
[48:14] amen
[48:15] verse 22 and therefore is imputed to him
[48:18] for righteousness
[48:19] now it was not written for his sake
[48:21] alone that was imputed to him but for us
[48:24] also you got to place your name in there
[48:26] but for also for Brother Bruce for
[48:28] sister Donna brother James brother Roger
[48:30] sister Trisha so you got to put yourself
[48:32] in the word because God is speaking to
[48:35] you you got to recognize and realize he
[48:37] wants to speak to us personally
[48:40] man
[48:41] but for also to whom it shall be imputed
[48:44] if we believe on him that raised up
[48:46] Jesus our lord from the dead who is the
[48:48] who was delivered for our offenses and
[48:50] was raised again for our justifications
[48:52] I just want to read this familiar
[48:54] scripture verse Romans 3 uh Romans 8 28
[48:56] it's not in the notes but
[48:58] and we know that all things work
[49:01] together for the good to them that love
[49:03] God and people stop right there
[49:05] but notice this to them who are the
[49:07] called according to his purpose
[49:09] so God wants all things to work together
[49:11] for your good yet praise God but are you
[49:15] recognizing that you're called to a
[49:16] certain purpose a Heavenly purpose that
[49:20] it's not about you anymore but it's
[49:22] about others around you it's about
[49:24] helping reconcile others around you it's
[49:26] about making sure that your soul is
[49:28] prospering because if your soul is not
[49:31] prospering how can you help somebody
[49:32] else I'm pretty sure we all flown before
[49:34] when it says get your mask on first
[49:37] before you help others because that's
[49:39] your life support so we need to make
[49:42] sure that Christ is at the center of our
[49:44] life before we try to stop helping
[49:46] people because if you're not connected
[49:48] with the Life Source then you can't get
[49:51] anybody life you can only give them
[49:52] death because Mark Cosby can't do
[49:55] anything but if God is leading and
[49:57] directing and God in my life and using
[49:59] my lips then I can give life to somebody
[50:01] then I can reconcile somebody
[50:03] amen
[50:05] so Abraham when it seemed like so
[50:07] Abraham
[50:08] he he he had all he could have all
[50:11] excuses in the world right he could he's
[50:13] never seen these things
[50:15] but he didn't use excuses and who are we
[50:17] to use excuses we have all this example
[50:19] of people we know personally we got
[50:22] people in the scripture all these
[50:23] examples that we have so we need to Cast
[50:25] Away all doubt all unbelief and just put
[50:29] nothing this is around atmosphere of
[50:30] faith
[50:31] I don't know when God is going to do it
[50:33] but I know he's going to do it in his
[50:35] appointed time that's we need to have
[50:37] faith in those things and it takes us to
[50:39] make takes a decision to have faith
[50:42] it's something you can't even please God
[50:43] without faith the scripture tells us
[50:46] so Abraham what if he would have stoned
[50:48] with his Stone he would stop for
[50:50] reasoning when he told him he's going to
[50:52] have a baby by Sarah and she was 65 and
[50:54] him 75. and when he was a hundred and
[50:57] she was and she was 90. he still he
[50:59] confessed that God's word was true see
[51:02] it has to be a confession has to be in
[51:04] here first so you can truly outwardly
[51:06] confess it something has to go on in
[51:08] here first it has to be quickened you
[51:10] have to believe it
[51:12] he confessed that God's word was true
[51:15] and he called those things which were
[51:17] not as though they were see even Hope
[51:19] Was there any hope he didn't even use
[51:21] hope well you say I hope I can get all
[51:24] right I hope I'll be well I hope I get
[51:26] the Holy Ghost I hope I'm a Christian I
[51:28] hope I do this you don't want that
[51:30] Abraham never looked at that amen
[51:33] against hope he still believed God's
[51:36] word faith is beyond hope faith comes
[51:41] from back here in the inside faith comes
[51:44] from here how does he get how does it
[51:46] get in through this mind the door the
[51:49] battle from standing there now when you
[51:52] get the battle set in a ray now the
[51:54] devil is sitting right to every heart
[51:56] this morning he's sitting in this little
[51:57] girl's heart he's sitting at your hearts
[51:59] he's sitting all around there he's
[52:01] saying oh I've seen you tries before I
[52:03] heard this before cast them out that's
[52:06] all cast him out when the Bible says
[52:08] hear our text casting him out that's
[52:10] right casting him out we've been trained
[52:14] so that's the thing that we have to do
[52:16] if you want to you gotta make that
[52:18] decision to cast him out no matter what
[52:21] the doctors say no matter what my
[52:23] symptoms are no matter what pain I'm in
[52:25] whatever you're seeking tonight if it's
[52:27] healing if it's the Holy Ghost if it's
[52:29] Deliverance if it's restoration if it's
[52:31] your family brought back together claim
[52:33] that God can do it no problem God
[52:37] doesn't see problems with small problems
[52:38] and big problems he just sees a problem
[52:41] that he can solve because there's not
[52:43] one problem that you can give me that
[52:44] God cannot solve but you have to have
[52:47] faith and trust in God and Play Your
[52:49] Part make sure you're in the right
[52:50] position that God wants you to be in so
[52:52] he can use you to help restore something
[52:55] that's how it has to be done that's
[52:57] that's the way God economies operated he
[53:00] cannot move in your life if you don't
[53:02] have trust and faith in him it's one
[53:04] thing saying you believe in God but God
[53:06] knows if you're true even Satan knows
[53:08] even Satan knows that if you're bluffing
[53:10] or not he does you can't fool Satan
[53:13] amen
[53:16] amen right down it reason right on down
[53:18] you say sin says oh I can feel it yeah
[53:20] there it is uh-huh oh I might smell it
[53:22] or so forth these things are they are
[53:25] yeah next thing you reason well it looks
[53:27] like he ought to know what he's talking
[53:29] about the doctor says I can't get well
[53:31] that ought to be yeah you right right
[53:33] there you're wrong that's the devil
[53:35] standing there the devil poking these
[53:37] things into you don't you believe that
[53:39] Hallelujah God's word I said above all
[53:42] things I would that you would prosper in
[53:43] health God wants you to prosper in
[53:45] health his scripture declares it that's
[53:47] right how can you be a real Soldier out
[53:49] there see I want you to prosper in
[53:51] health
[53:52] so you have to believe we have to
[53:54] believe for everything that we're we're
[53:55] needing of we believe that God supplies
[53:58] it
[53:58] if he even even a sparrow doesn't drop a
[54:01] bird doesn't drop without him knowing he
[54:02] even feeds The Sparrows the scripture
[54:04] says he's given us a cure to anxiety
[54:07] he said but seek ye first the kingdom of
[54:10] God and his righteousness and all these
[54:13] things will be added unto he knows you
[54:15] have back pain he knows you can't lift
[54:17] your arms he knows that you you want
[54:19] your children back serving God he knows
[54:22] these things but let God work in your
[54:24] life don't have doubt because God
[54:27] doesn't work through doubt he's waiting
[54:29] for you to have faith not for you hold
[54:31] on to doubt and say oh Lord I believe yo
[54:33] I think you can do this but say Lord I
[54:34] know you can do this your word declares
[54:37] that your word doesn't say you can't do
[54:39] this your word says you can and I'm
[54:40] holding to the word of God I'm not
[54:42] holding to what Johnny Johnny Appleseed
[54:45] said over here or Dr Suzanne over here
[54:47] I'm holding to What God Says
[54:49] amen then if Satan can get through there
[54:52] get these by the conscience and all
[54:54] these other things he gets right down
[54:56] there to the end of the soul and the
[54:58] mind so that's why it's a mind battle
[55:00] see your mind is gonna dictate
[55:04] whether you're going to receive the word
[55:06] or not because it says the right mental
[55:08] attitude it starts with that first if
[55:09] you can't believe the right mental
[55:11] attitude attitude is everything to God
[55:13] if you have a bad attitude then how can
[55:15] God ever move in your life he can't even
[55:17] speak to you because you're so focused
[55:18] on having a bad attitude
[55:21] amen then if Satan can get through there
[55:23] get these by these conscience and all
[55:25] these other things then he gets right
[55:27] down there to the end of the soul and
[55:29] the mind now if he can just get you
[55:31] you'll never you'll never look at one of
[55:32] them until you first have to let him in
[55:34] there wow you have to let him in then
[55:38] when he gets in he gets control see
[55:40] Satan can't just bombard in your mind
[55:42] you first have to let him in you have to
[55:46] give him access to to your mind
[55:49] so now same thing like with God see like
[55:52] our brother in the last couple men's
[55:53] meetings talks about God demands worship
[55:56] and Satan wants worship that that's the
[55:59] battle's right there the worship and if
[56:02] we're succumbing letting the devil
[56:05] plant seeds in our mind and we're
[56:07] manifesting those seeds then we're
[56:08] worshiping the devil
[56:10] because we're feeding upon him but if
[56:12] we're kicking things out and trying the
[56:14] spirit like the scripture tells us in
[56:15] John
[56:16] I think it's first John 4 1 it says try
[56:18] the spirit and see that be of me so we
[56:20] have to try these things that are going
[56:21] into our mind
[56:22] because we can't just have vanilla kind
[56:24] of thoughts that's going on our mind we
[56:26] have to try to make sure it is of god
[56:27] because Satan likes to come as he is of
[56:29] God
[56:30] but we can't be fooled we have to and it
[56:33] comes to practice like we're like in
[56:34] Hebrews 4 it was saying you got to
[56:36] exercise you got to practice if you want
[56:39] to be able to lift heavy things you got
[56:40] to practice lifting heavy things it
[56:42] takes steps there's gradual steps up you
[56:44] can't just go try to lift the you know
[56:46] 225 pounds just like right now you got
[56:49] to build up to it just like with faith
[56:51] you gotta let your faith be built up
[56:52] built up built up built up until we get
[56:54] that that Supreme faith and it's by
[56:57] little things that we do every day like
[56:58] brother Aaron says the little things
[56:59] that we do every day that gets us to
[57:01] that Pinnacle of faith and your faith
[57:03] keeps growing it doesn't just stop you
[57:04] get to a certain level and it caps out
[57:06] at 99 no it keeps going
[57:08] amen
[57:09] you have to let him in there then he
[57:11] gets in he's got control then what does
[57:13] he do he begins to use the conscience he
[57:17] begins to use this begin to use the
[57:18] outlet what is it see taste fill smell
[57:22] here imaginations conscience memories
[57:25] reasons affections he begins to use all
[57:27] those different little channels as long
[57:29] as he could get in above this one here
[57:31] he's got to come into your mind first
[57:34] and you have to accept it listen to it
[57:37] and can batter against it but it can't
[57:39] get until you accept it
[57:41] so we have to make that choice every day
[57:43] are we going to let Satan just take over
[57:46] our minds and just let anyone kind of
[57:48] thought in there are we going to say
[57:50] What God Says cast on all imaginations
[57:52] all reasonings every High thought and
[57:54] put every thought into the subject of
[57:55] Christ are we going to do that that's
[57:57] the choice we have every day if we make
[57:59] that choice guess what that's a good
[58:00] choice that's going to lead us closer
[58:03] and more intimate with Jesus
[58:06] when Satan walked up to Eve he and said
[58:09] you know the fruit is Pleasant she
[58:11] stopped for a moment
[58:13] oh that's what she made a mistake when
[58:15] she stopped for a moment
[58:17] don't stop for nothing you've got the
[58:20] message Jesus Lives God Is A Healer
[58:22] that's the message don't stop fighting
[58:25] for nothing no reasoning is nothing else
[58:26] that's from the greatest battle ever
[58:28] fought in 1962.
[58:30] so we're in a battle on a daily basis
[58:33] the the victory we're going to get the
[58:35] victory the battle is the Lord's but you
[58:37] have to play your part if you want that
[58:39] if you want victory in your life you
[58:41] have to play the part he's called us to
[58:43] be Overcomers in his age one of the
[58:46] hardest ages to live in but with
[58:48] anything is is possible with God it
[58:50] doesn't matter how hard the age is or
[58:52] this or that you you have if you look in
[58:54] the back of the book we win so what do
[58:56] we have to fear
[58:57] why are we holding to fear Satan is
[59:01] gives you fear God doesn't give the
[59:03] spirit of fear he can't it's impossible
[59:06] let's go to James 4.
[59:08] and read verses 5 through 10.
[59:21] so verse 5.
[59:24] do you think that the scripture saith in
[59:26] vain the spirit that dwelleth in us
[59:28] lusts us to Envy just really hitting
[59:30] home in the battle that we got
[59:31] constantly on a daily basis just because
[59:33] she became a Christian the battle is
[59:36] actually even it's raging now that's
[59:37] when the battle really starts and as you
[59:40] grow closer with the Lord and the years
[59:41] go on then the battle it gets even more
[59:44] it gets even more hard because Satan
[59:46] wants to get you to think well you've
[59:48] been serving the lord for x amount of
[59:50] years or you prayed good yesterday or
[59:52] you had a good church service on Sunday
[59:54] Hallelujah you take a little break but
[59:56] it's no time to take breaks the hour is
[59:58] getting too late for us to take breaks
[59:59] we have to be full force Pell to the
[1:00:02] metal we got to be pressing into God if
[1:00:05] you want things changing in your life
[1:00:07] see change
[1:00:09] I'm talking a different subject now but
[1:00:11] change there's two things you you can
[1:00:13] change people in the world change people
[1:00:15] in the world get new jobs uh take on new
[1:00:18] new responsibilities all these things
[1:00:20] but what kind of change is God looking
[1:00:22] for he's looking for change in your life
[1:00:24] that's going to make fruit that's what
[1:00:27] he's looking for as a tree is changing
[1:00:29] you plant a tree in the ground water it
[1:00:32] and take care of it it begins to grow
[1:00:34] and what are you looking for the results
[1:00:36] for it to bear fruit and what does God
[1:00:39] look in our lives for us to bear fruit
[1:00:41] that's the type of change we need to
[1:00:42] have
[1:00:43] because a tree that's planted by the
[1:00:46] water is roots are grounded no strong
[1:00:49] wind can move it it loosens it so the
[1:00:51] roots can grow deeper and we have to
[1:00:53] grow deeper in our walk with god let's
[1:00:56] go deeper in the word of God
[1:00:58] that's what God is calling us to is
[1:01:00] change every decision you make is going
[1:01:02] to change you to the good way or to the
[1:01:04] bad way
[1:01:06] and we want we all want change
[1:01:08] we may want to lose weight eat healthier
[1:01:10] all those things are good praise God but
[1:01:14] I'm looking for Spiritual change in my
[1:01:16] life because that's what's going to
[1:01:17] matter that does not matter how many
[1:01:19] times I Juiced how many times I ate a
[1:01:21] Big Mac or whatever it is that's not
[1:01:23] going to matter at the end of the day
[1:01:24] what's going to matter was my soul
[1:01:26] prospering was I making the right
[1:01:28] decisions towards God was I keeping my
[1:01:30] mind staying upon God and was my life
[1:01:32] truly changing the way the scripture
[1:01:34] declares it too because the scripture is
[1:01:36] declaring us to all things be new all us
[1:01:39] to be born again and our Nature has to
[1:01:43] change if we never get a nature change
[1:01:45] if we never become born again then we
[1:01:47] miss what God is calling us to because
[1:01:49] Jesus said he must be born again he
[1:01:51] didn't say you may have to be born again
[1:01:53] but he said he must because you can't
[1:01:54] even see the things of God unless your
[1:01:56] Nature's changed and your nature our
[1:01:58] Nature's still changing he's still
[1:02:00] trying to restore us back to what we
[1:02:01] once were before the fall
[1:02:03] God wants to work in your life he wants
[1:02:06] to change you but he's not going to
[1:02:08] force himself upon you you have to make
[1:02:10] that decision every single day it's a
[1:02:12] hard decision yes but it's a decision
[1:02:14] you must make if you want growth in your
[1:02:16] life the right kind of growth
[1:02:19] amen
[1:02:22] but he giveth more grace wherefore he
[1:02:25] saith God resisteth the proud but give a
[1:02:28] Grace unto the humble
[1:02:30] so humility is something that we have to
[1:02:33] do it's something we have to Humble
[1:02:34] ourselves under the mighty hand of God
[1:02:37] and we had to kill Pride because pride
[1:02:39] comes from what comes from Satan it's a
[1:02:42] perverted form of humility that's all it
[1:02:44] is Satan just perverted humility and
[1:02:48] made it to Pride because pride is
[1:02:50] overconfident Pride likes to build
[1:02:52] itself up Pride likes to
[1:02:55] act like humility but in reality all it
[1:02:58] is is prideful that's all it is is pride
[1:03:00] humility and pride are Polar Opposites
[1:03:02] night and day
[1:03:04] so submit yourselves therefore to God so
[1:03:07] we play a part we have to submit
[1:03:09] ourselves to God then resist the devil
[1:03:12] and he will flee from that that's that's
[1:03:14] the program right there submit yourself
[1:03:16] to God because you yourself your
[1:03:19] strengths you cannot fight the devil
[1:03:21] yourself you will fail it's a spiritual
[1:03:24] battle we're carnal beings we're we're
[1:03:26] born in carnality and we have to
[1:03:29] recognize that God is our strength Jesus
[1:03:32] said all power is given to me in heaven
[1:03:34] and in Earth
[1:03:35] so if Jesus has that power then to me I
[1:03:39] see that Satan is powerless against God
[1:03:41] he is he can't do anything against God
[1:03:44] unless God permits him to do something
[1:03:46] in our lives trials afflictions pains
[1:03:49] that's something that he can do anything
[1:03:51] but those things are going to work
[1:03:52] together for your good because he
[1:03:54] promised it to yeah
[1:03:56] yeah draw an eye to God and He will draw
[1:03:58] an eye to you so knows that choice
[1:03:59] that's a good choice if you're drawing
[1:04:01] nigh to God he's going to draw an eye
[1:04:03] into you but look at this we read this
[1:04:05] or I think Sunday cleanse your hands ye
[1:04:07] Sinners and purify your hearts be
[1:04:10] double-minded see we can't be
[1:04:12] double-minded we may say oh I believe
[1:04:14] I'm gonna get healed oh I believe I'm
[1:04:16] gonna get delivered I'm gonna believe
[1:04:17] I'm gonna get the Holy Ghost but you're
[1:04:18] constantly saying well I might get it
[1:04:20] then God can't do anything he's looking
[1:04:22] for you to be anchored be stand anchored
[1:04:26] in his word stand upon that rock be
[1:04:28] firmly anchored in him so he can move in
[1:04:30] your life
[1:04:31] God is obligated to fulfill his word if
[1:04:34] you fulfilled your part he's obligated
[1:04:37] he he he can't his word his word can't
[1:04:39] return void
[1:04:42] verse uh verse 9 be afflicted and mourn
[1:04:45] and weep let your laughter be turned to
[1:04:46] mourning and your joy to heaviness
[1:04:49] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[1:04:51] Lord knows it says humble yourselves
[1:04:53] doesn't say Lord's going to Humble
[1:04:55] yourselves but says humble yourselves in
[1:04:57] the sight of the lord lord can't do
[1:04:58] things to Humble you to you know get you
[1:05:00] off your high horse he can but it says
[1:05:02] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[1:05:04] Lord and He Shall lift you up let him
[1:05:05] lift you up don't lift yourself up Let
[1:05:08] Him lift you up
[1:05:10] Hebrews 12.
[1:05:14] verses for Shepherds Hebrews 12 what's
[1:05:17] up with verse 1.
[1:05:20] praise God Amen wherefore seeing we also
[1:05:24] are compassed about with such a great
[1:05:26] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:05:29] every weight in the Sin which doth so
[1:05:32] easily beset us and let us run with what
[1:05:34] patience the race that is set before us
[1:05:37] looking unto the Jesus the Jesus looking
[1:05:40] unto Jesus the author and finisher of
[1:05:43] our faith so you make a choice to look
[1:05:45] to Jesus or not in your trials in your
[1:05:48] depression in your Sorrows you can look
[1:05:50] to Jesus or you can look to the problem
[1:05:52] I'd rather look to the problem solver
[1:05:54] than to the problem because I know the
[1:05:56] problem solver can get me out of the
[1:05:58] problem that I'm in but you have to look
[1:06:00] to him you have to have faith that he's
[1:06:03] going to move in that situation
[1:06:06] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:06:08] endured the cross he endured all these
[1:06:10] things so we can become Victorious
[1:06:13] through him through his blood through
[1:06:15] his strength that's why we're Victorious
[1:06:17] not how good I can uh tie my shoes how
[1:06:21] good I can drive a forklift how good I
[1:06:23] can type on a computer now that stuff
[1:06:24] doesn't matter what matters is that why
[1:06:27] he endured for you that you can be an
[1:06:29] overcomer that you could he became you
[1:06:31] so you could become him that's what he
[1:06:33] died for he died so you can be that
[1:06:36] state before the fall of Adam and Eve
[1:06:38] that's what he's trying to get us back
[1:06:40] to is that that Eden moment it was
[1:06:42] perfect it was calm it was peaceful
[1:06:44] nobody had to die no killings and we're
[1:06:47] slowly we're getting back to that and
[1:06:49] it's coming sooner than we think he says
[1:06:51] that come into hours that you think not
[1:06:53] so that's why he said to watch and pray
[1:06:55] the script says in Peter to be sober and
[1:06:57] to be vigilant because we have an
[1:06:59] adversary who he's cunning he's crafty
[1:07:02] he's smart he's wise and he like brother
[1:07:05] Ferguson said he looks and see your
[1:07:08] weaknesses your faults he wants to
[1:07:10] accuse you he's studying you all the
[1:07:13] demons they've been studying the human
[1:07:14] race for I don't know how many years but
[1:07:17] they've been studying they know the
[1:07:19] things that that uh entice you that
[1:07:21] stimulates your flesh they give you
[1:07:22] entertainment and we have to get to know
[1:07:25] our enemy because Paul said we're not
[1:07:28] ignorant of Satan's devices so we have
[1:07:30] to study our enemy and see
[1:07:32] how we fell before in the past we had we
[1:07:35] got to look at these things and analyze
[1:07:36] these things so we don't fall on the
[1:07:38] same trap that we did see God when we
[1:07:40] make a mistake and he convicts us we
[1:07:42] have to recognize what we did to lead to
[1:07:45] that so we don't go into the same
[1:07:47] mistake again we're going to make
[1:07:48] mistakes we are
[1:07:50] but make those mistakes turn into growth
[1:07:53] but we don't want to keep making the
[1:07:54] same mistake over and over I want to
[1:07:56] keep walking on Wilderness 40 years and
[1:07:58] 40 years I want to go around that
[1:07:59] mountain once
[1:08:01] I want God to be able to go into the
[1:08:04] next phase to the next growth growth I
[1:08:07] want this keeping growth growth growth
[1:08:08] because we can have a testimony every
[1:08:10] day of the Lord moving in our life it's
[1:08:12] how bad do you want it how bad do you
[1:08:14] want to a a testimony and say the Lord's
[1:08:17] been changed in my life he's been
[1:08:18] dealing with me this subject I got a
[1:08:20] chance to witness to this individual
[1:08:22] this these things that can happen in our
[1:08:24] life but we have to want it you have to
[1:08:26] have a strong desire and a want for God
[1:08:29] to do those things in your life
[1:08:31] let's go to verse three for consider him
[1:08:33] that endured such contradiction of
[1:08:35] Sinners against himself lest ye be weary
[1:08:37] and faint in your minds
[1:08:40] you have not ye have not yet resisted
[1:08:43] unto blood striving against sin
[1:08:45] and you have forgotten the exhortation
[1:08:47] which speaketh unto you as unto a
[1:08:49] children my son despise that thou the
[1:08:52] chastening of the Lord
[1:08:54] nor faint when thou are rebuked of him
[1:08:57] for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:08:59] so when he's chastening us he loves us
[1:09:02] he knows there's potential inside of us
[1:09:05] he's trying to refine that he he he he
[1:09:07] sees those things
[1:09:10] but says if you endured chastening God
[1:09:13] deals with you as with sons for what son
[1:09:16] is him whom the father chasten not
[1:09:20] but if he be without chastisement
[1:09:21] wherefore all our partakers then you are
[1:09:23] bastards and not of sons and not Sons
[1:09:26] furthermore we have fathers of our flesh
[1:09:28] which corrected us
[1:09:30] when we get spankings when we get yelled
[1:09:32] at they did it for they did it because
[1:09:35] they wanted you to learn from that
[1:09:36] situation yes they may have done it in
[1:09:39] the right way every single time they're
[1:09:40] human it's okay but their heart was to
[1:09:43] help you
[1:09:45] but now our father who's a perfect
[1:09:47] father if we believe he's perfect then
[1:09:50] we we should just say Lord you know what
[1:09:52] you're doing I'm gonna just listen to
[1:09:54] you I'm gonna be obedient to you right
[1:09:56] now right then I'm not going to question
[1:09:57] you because you know the path my life
[1:09:59] needs to go in you know the things that
[1:10:01] I don't need in my life you know these
[1:10:03] things
[1:10:06] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[1:10:08] flesh
[1:10:09] which corrected us we gave them
[1:10:11] reverence so not much more we'd rather
[1:10:13] be in subjection unto the father of
[1:10:15] spirits and live
[1:10:17] for they verily for a few days chasing
[1:10:19] us after their own Pleasures but he for
[1:10:21] our Prophet that we might be partakers
[1:10:24] notice the reason but for our Prophet is
[1:10:28] going to profit us to listen to God it's
[1:10:31] going to cause growth in your life it's
[1:10:34] going to profit it's gonna bless you
[1:10:35] fruit's gonna bear because you're being
[1:10:37] obedient to him
[1:10:39] that we might be partakers of his
[1:10:41] wholeness
[1:10:42] I just love that of his Holiness I can't
[1:10:45] be holy without him it's his Holiness
[1:10:47] that makes me holy
[1:10:49] now no chastening for present seemed to
[1:10:51] be joyous it doesn't it's not to your
[1:10:53] flesh your flesh is going to hate it
[1:10:54] every single time
[1:10:56] but Grievous nevertheless afterward it
[1:10:59] what it yielded the Peaceable fruit of
[1:11:01] righteousness that's the type of fruit
[1:11:03] we need
[1:11:04] unto them which are exercised thereby oh
[1:11:07] look at that word exercise again
[1:11:09] wherefore lift up hands which hang down
[1:11:11] in the feeble knees and make straight
[1:11:14] the paths for your feet lest that which
[1:11:16] is lame be turned out the way
[1:11:18] but let it rather be healed follow peace
[1:11:21] with all men and Holiness which without
[1:11:23] which no man seeth the Lord
[1:11:26] looking diligently let any man fail of
[1:11:28] grace of God let any root of bitterness
[1:11:30] spring me up trouble you thereby may be
[1:11:33] defiled let's go to Daniel 3. I want to
[1:11:36] just look at a couple characters
[1:11:38] who made a good choice
[1:11:40] in situations
[1:11:43] where their back was against the wall
[1:11:50] before we turn that I want to read this
[1:11:52] a couple things I've written down notice
[1:11:54] it says despise not the chastening of
[1:11:56] the Lord notice you have to make that
[1:11:58] choice whether you despise it or it is
[1:12:01] accepted
[1:12:02] see that is a good decision we said
[1:12:04] before it causes growth a good decision
[1:12:06] spiritual decision
[1:12:08] will cause growth in your life a
[1:12:10] decision to be obedient in God will
[1:12:12] cause growth in your life it will be
[1:12:14] harder like we said before
[1:12:15] it may even cause your FL cause your
[1:12:17] flesh to rile up but Jesus tell us the
[1:12:19] what to crucify the flesh daily a
[1:12:22] decision to crucify your flesh daily is
[1:12:24] a good decision also to pray and to
[1:12:27] press and we don't feel like it is a
[1:12:29] good decision it's easy to pray when
[1:12:32] everything is going all right when your
[1:12:34] time is just open you everything's open
[1:12:37] you have anything planned uh no problems
[1:12:40] going on at work nothing
[1:12:42] but when those things come in
[1:12:44] are you pressing in
[1:12:46] because that's the that's what's going
[1:12:48] to show if you have the goods that you
[1:12:49] say you have because anybody can pray
[1:12:51] when everything's all good
[1:12:53] but can you get on your knees when your
[1:12:56] body's just beat down when uh Satan's
[1:12:59] has been attacking every inch your
[1:13:00] family your church members everything
[1:13:02] your your
[1:13:03] but that's the time to really get
[1:13:05] together and pray
[1:13:06] we see we see all everybody sister
[1:13:08] Kathleen's sick brother Marty
[1:13:11] um brother Johnson uh you see the
[1:13:13] devil's just been attacking with that
[1:13:15] prophecy said if we come together and
[1:13:16] pray for one another that's we need to
[1:13:19] come together that much closer and pray
[1:13:20] that much more for one another that's
[1:13:22] what builds unity in a church coming
[1:13:24] praying
[1:13:25] because the devil he'll attack
[1:13:28] but he can't he can't stop if you're
[1:13:29] fully surrendered a guy you're prayed up
[1:13:31] in the spirit he can't stop that in fact
[1:13:34] he doesn't want you to get there
[1:13:36] he wants you just to pray fleshly
[1:13:37] because he knows if you get to the in
[1:13:39] the spirit prayer then he is powerless
[1:13:42] he can't do anything
[1:13:45] let's go to Daniel 3.
[1:13:49] and we'll start with verse
[1:13:51] verse 6.
[1:13:54] so during this time
[1:13:55] um this is they are the children of
[1:13:57] Israel Exile and Nebuchadnezzar was uh
[1:14:00] the king and he made this decree that uh
[1:14:02] who
[1:14:03] who wouldn't fall down and worship this
[1:14:05] this Idol this this these Idols then
[1:14:08] they'll be cast into the fiery furnace
[1:14:10] now they had it now the three Hebrew
[1:14:12] children Shadrach Meshach and Bendigo
[1:14:14] they had a choice
[1:14:16] they could have bowed down to the image
[1:14:19] in fear of begin throwing a fire
[1:14:20] firmness or they could just trust in a
[1:14:22] living God
[1:14:24] because he's a living God
[1:14:27] and whoso followeth not down in worship
[1:14:29] it shall the same hour be cast into the
[1:14:31] midst of a burning fiery furnace verse
[1:14:33] 7.
[1:14:34] therefore at the time when all the
[1:14:36] people had heard the sound of the Cornet
[1:14:38] flute harp sackbut Upholstery and all
[1:14:41] kinds of music all the people the
[1:14:43] Nations and languages fell down and
[1:14:45] worshiped the golden image that
[1:14:47] Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up verse
[1:14:48] 8. wherefore at the time certain
[1:14:50] Chaldeans came near and accused the Jews
[1:14:53] they spake and said to the King
[1:14:55] Nebuchadnezzar O King live forever thou
[1:14:58] O King has made a decree that every man
[1:15:01] that shall hear the sound of the Coronet
[1:15:02] flute harp sack but Upholstery and
[1:15:05] dulcimer and all kinds of music shall
[1:15:07] fall down and worship the golden image
[1:15:09] and whoso fought not down in worship
[1:15:11] that he should be cast into the midst of
[1:15:13] a burning fiery furnace
[1:15:15] there are certain Jews who now have set
[1:15:18] over the Affairs of providence of
[1:15:19] Babylon Shadrach meshech and Abednego
[1:15:22] these men O King have not regarded thee
[1:15:25] they may serve not thy Gods nor worship
[1:15:27] the golden image without set up
[1:15:30] so now uh sometimes at work I feel like
[1:15:32] I'm living in a modern modern day
[1:15:34] Babylon the music they play the language
[1:15:37] they speak
[1:15:38] but that gives me no excuse
[1:15:40] to act like them in fact they they still
[1:15:45] didn't have a church like this they
[1:15:47] didn't have brothers and sisters to call
[1:15:49] on the phone and they didn't have Bibles
[1:15:51] like we got like this to read every day
[1:15:53] like we are and to pray in their knees
[1:15:55] and quiet and calmness of their home
[1:15:56] they were constantly surrounded by
[1:15:58] paganism Hedonism 24 7 hours a day 24 24
[1:16:02] hours a day
[1:16:04] and but they still made the choice they
[1:16:06] still made a good choice so where I work
[1:16:08] at I have a decision to make a good
[1:16:10] choice am I just gonna just sit like a
[1:16:12] little Christian in a box or I'm Gonna
[1:16:13] Let Jesus manifest in my life am I
[1:16:15] scared to let him manifest because he
[1:16:17] promised he's a light
[1:16:19] he called me to be a light because he's
[1:16:21] a light inside of me so I need to let my
[1:16:23] light shine no matter what the sick
[1:16:25] circumstances are situations that work I
[1:16:27] need to let Jesus Shine through me so
[1:16:30] others can see that I'm not just some
[1:16:32] regular nominal Christian but I'm a born
[1:16:34] a green Christian filled with the Holy
[1:16:36] Ghost
[1:16:37] that's what they need to see because all
[1:16:39] these people want to slap the name of
[1:16:40] Christian talk any old kind of Life cuss
[1:16:43] like a sailor and still say oh I believe
[1:16:44] in Christ oh I'm born again how are you
[1:16:46] born again if you're born again your
[1:16:48] nature is changed God doesn't gravitate
[1:16:51] towards those things he cares about your
[1:16:52] languages the things you think the way
[1:16:54] you dress he cares about all those
[1:16:55] things he isn't a God to say well you
[1:16:58] can serve me and just keep these things
[1:17:00] over here and still you know say any
[1:17:01] okay you can go to the bar and get drunk
[1:17:03] and all these things no he's been
[1:17:05] calling us he's calling us to a full
[1:17:07] nature change
[1:17:08] a full nature change not a partial but a
[1:17:11] fool he's not coming back for halfway
[1:17:13] Believers he's coming back for believers
[1:17:15] that are fully surrendered and ready to
[1:17:18] do whatever he says if he says pick up
[1:17:20] and drop something you pick up and drop
[1:17:21] it and go
[1:17:25] where we at now verse 13.
[1:17:27] the Nebuchadnezzar and his rage and fury
[1:17:29] commanded to bring Shadrach meshech and
[1:17:32] Bendigo
[1:17:33] their boss was mad
[1:17:35] they brought these men before the King
[1:17:37] Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them
[1:17:39] is it true oh sheriff they could have
[1:17:42] said well no King it's not they're lying
[1:17:44] but no they told the truth brother Bram
[1:17:46] said tell the truth no matter the
[1:17:48] outcome
[1:17:49] no matter what I don't care if you did
[1:17:52] something wrong tell the truth don't
[1:17:54] cover up because it's going to come to
[1:17:55] light eventually David tried to cover
[1:17:58] his mistake up and it came to light if
[1:18:01] he just would have just came out and
[1:18:03] said Lord I did wrong instead of
[1:18:04] covering up his I believe his punishment
[1:18:06] punishment a lot less but no
[1:18:09] uh the the prophet gave him this uh this
[1:18:11] parable of this and David's like oh he
[1:18:13] should kill him like no it's talking
[1:18:14] about you David he's like but he did
[1:18:16] repent at that time
[1:18:18] but let us when we make a mistake
[1:18:21] make it right make it right with God and
[1:18:23] make right with that person just do it
[1:18:25] right then and there because the longer
[1:18:27] we prolong it the more our prayer life's
[1:18:30] going to suffer those around us are
[1:18:32] going to suffer like I said before last
[1:18:34] sermon I preached every decision you
[1:18:36] make is going to directly affect those
[1:18:39] around you your family your church
[1:18:40] members and we have to think about it
[1:18:43] think about the things that you're
[1:18:45] trying to don't hide things don't do it
[1:18:46] just don't do it don't do it
[1:18:52] amen Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto
[1:18:55] them is it true o Shadrach Meshach and
[1:18:57] Abednego
[1:18:58] do not ye serve my gods nor worship the
[1:19:00] golden image will have set up now if you
[1:19:02] be ready that at what time you hear the
[1:19:04] sound of the Cornet flute harp I wanna I
[1:19:08] don't know where the sackbutt is but
[1:19:09] it's something Upholstery and dulcimer
[1:19:12] and all kinds of music You Fall Down and
[1:19:14] Worship the image
[1:19:15] which I have made well but if you
[1:19:17] worship not if you shall cast if you if
[1:19:19] you shall cast the same hour into the
[1:19:21] midst of the burning fiery furnace and
[1:19:23] who so that God shall deliver you out of
[1:19:24] my hands and who is that God that should
[1:19:26] live without my hands now he gave him a
[1:19:28] choice
[1:19:29] you can worship right now and your life
[1:19:31] be saved or you can get thrown in the
[1:19:33] furnace and your life be ended
[1:19:34] but they didn't count they didn't care
[1:19:36] he was like we're serving God no matter
[1:19:37] what as we read
[1:19:39] and not give it away let's keep this
[1:19:40] keep going
[1:19:41] Shamrock Meshach and Abednego answered
[1:19:43] and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar
[1:19:45] we are not careful to answer thee in
[1:19:47] this matter I love that if it be so our
[1:19:51] God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us
[1:19:55] from the burning fire in furnace and he
[1:19:56] will deliver us out of thy hand O King
[1:19:58] but if not be it known unto thee O King
[1:20:01] that we will not serve thy Gods nor
[1:20:04] worship the golden image which thou has
[1:20:06] said reminds me the Christians that the
[1:20:08] the Roman Church killed over 68 million
[1:20:11] I believe 65 million plus
[1:20:13] they had that same choice
[1:20:15] they could have said literally lions
[1:20:19] they were all these things they were
[1:20:20] executed but they chose to hold God was
[1:20:23] so real in their life that they didn't
[1:20:25] care what happened to their bodies
[1:20:26] because they could say what Paul said
[1:20:27] death whereas I sting grave where's our
[1:20:30] Victory they were totally sold out amen
[1:20:32] amen they knew that the god they served
[1:20:34] whether he delivered them or not he's
[1:20:36] still God and they knew that if they
[1:20:39] killed me
[1:20:40] I'm not dead I'm going on to my body
[1:20:42] over another side so they didn't care
[1:20:44] either way they were going to serve God
[1:20:46] they're not bow to any image no Roman
[1:20:49] paganism they didn't want to bow to any
[1:20:50] of those things because they knew those
[1:20:52] things like Moses said Moses thought he
[1:20:55] knew the season a pleasure of season
[1:20:56] this is for a season it's going to go
[1:20:58] away
[1:20:59] but living for we're living for God
[1:21:01] that's eternal life I'm not willing to
[1:21:04] give up eternal life to have some
[1:21:06] pleasure to have some money in my pocket
[1:21:07] I'd rather be flat out broke
[1:21:10] and have God than to be flat out rich
[1:21:12] and think I have God because it says in
[1:21:14] uh Revelations 3 they're rich and they
[1:21:18] need of nothing they have all these
[1:21:19] things but yet they have the very thing
[1:21:21] they're missing the very key ingredient
[1:21:23] to a prosperous life that's a rich life
[1:21:25] to me having God in your life not having
[1:21:28] 20 cars a mansion house pools uh girls
[1:21:32] and this thing doesn't matter those
[1:21:34] things are going to pass away but if I
[1:21:36] have God doesn't matter what state I'm
[1:21:37] in as long as I have God and he has all
[1:21:40] part of my life every fiber and being in
[1:21:41] my life it doesn't matter then
[1:21:46] so where are we at let's go verse 17 or
[1:21:48] verse 18.
[1:21:51] but if it not be unto thee O King that
[1:21:53] we will not serve thy God it's going to
[1:21:55] worship the golden image which I was set
[1:21:56] up then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fear
[1:21:59] that boss was really mad that day and
[1:22:01] fourth his uh of his Vestige was changed
[1:22:04] his countenance was changed so a Vestige
[1:22:05] means his face was changed
[1:22:08] was changed against Shadrach Meshach and
[1:22:10] Abednego therefore he spake the
[1:22:12] Commandment uh he he commanded that they
[1:22:15] should heat the furnace one seven times
[1:22:16] more than it was to be heated
[1:22:19] and he commanded the most mighty men
[1:22:21] that were in his army to bind Sherry
[1:22:23] Meshach and Abednego and to cast him out
[1:22:26] and said burning fiery furnace then
[1:22:27] these men were about these men were
[1:22:29] Bound in their coats and their hoses and
[1:22:31] their hats and their other garments and
[1:22:33] were cast into the midst of burning
[1:22:35] fiery furnace therefore because the
[1:22:36] King's Command was urgent and the ferns
[1:22:38] exceeding hot the flame of fires flew
[1:22:40] those men that took up sharick Meshach
[1:22:42] Abednego because money that scripture
[1:22:43] don't don't touch my holy anointed ones
[1:22:45] so it kind of reminds me of
[1:22:47] and these three men Shadrach Meshach and
[1:22:49] Abednego fell down bound to the midst of
[1:22:52] the burning of fire reference
[1:22:53] Nebuchadnezzar is knew knew there could
[1:22:54] be burned to Ash they're going to be
[1:22:56] nothing left
[1:22:57] but to his surprise then Nebuchadnezzar
[1:23:00] the King was astonished and Rose up in
[1:23:02] haste and spake and said unto his
[1:23:04] counselors did not we cast three men bow
[1:23:06] into the midst of the fire
[1:23:08] they answered and said the king true O
[1:23:11] King he answered and said lo I see four
[1:23:14] men loose walking in the midst of the
[1:23:16] fire and they have no hurt in the form
[1:23:18] of the fourth is like the Son of God
[1:23:21] praise God
[1:23:24] then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the
[1:23:27] mouth of the burning fiery furnace and
[1:23:28] spake and said Sheikh Abednego ye
[1:23:31] Servants of the most high God come forth
[1:23:34] and come hither then Shadrach meshech
[1:23:37] and the Bendigo came forth of the midst
[1:23:39] of the fire and the princes and
[1:23:41] governors and captains and the Kings
[1:23:43] counselors but Gathering Together saw
[1:23:45] these men upon whose bodies the fire had
[1:23:47] no power now check this out nor was a
[1:23:50] hair of their heads singled singed
[1:23:52] neither will their coach changed nor the
[1:23:55] smell of fire passed on them that is all
[1:23:58] the act of God
[1:24:00] because any anybody knows if we're on a
[1:24:03] campfire a bonfire you're going to smell
[1:24:05] just like fire you can try your hards
[1:24:08] you can clone up everything you're going
[1:24:09] to smell like fire so the hand of God
[1:24:11] God himself came down and protected them
[1:24:16] they know why because they were obedient
[1:24:18] to God they were even willing to
[1:24:21] sacrifice their lives to God that's what
[1:24:23] God is looking for us to be as obedient
[1:24:25] to death
[1:24:26] no matter if if the gun's pointing your
[1:24:29] head be obedient it doesn't matter the
[1:24:31] situation be obedient
[1:24:36] then Nebuchadnezzar speaker verse 29
[1:24:38] therefore I make a decree that every
[1:24:40] people nation and language which speak
[1:24:44] anything amiss against the god of
[1:24:46] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego shall be
[1:24:47] cut into pieces and their houses shall
[1:24:49] be made at dung Hill because there is no
[1:24:52] other God that can deliver after the
[1:24:54] source that's the kind of God we serve
[1:24:56] there's no AAA meeting there's no
[1:24:58] counseling that can take the place of
[1:25:01] Jesus Christ being the mighty counselor
[1:25:03] in your life
[1:25:04] people people can go to meetings and get
[1:25:06] helped but that that that is still in
[1:25:09] there is that linger to still do it is
[1:25:10] still in there and so any day
[1:25:12] something's going to strike that and go
[1:25:13] right back to what they're doing that's
[1:25:15] why true only delivers to come from God
[1:25:17] if you want deliverance from your life
[1:25:19] that Deliverance is going to last
[1:25:21] go to God he'll give it to you
[1:25:23] I can testify that personally in my life
[1:25:26] pretty sure we all can
[1:25:28] then the king promoted Shadrach Meshach
[1:25:30] and Abednego in the Providence of
[1:25:31] Babylon so it looked like if you want a
[1:25:33] promotion a true promotion from God be
[1:25:35] obedient
[1:25:36] if you want to if you want
[1:25:38] your work you'll be promoted just trust
[1:25:41] God he can open the door that no man can
[1:25:43] close this is our brother said in the
[1:25:45] men's meeting
[1:25:46] no matter if you have a bad interview a
[1:25:48] bad what if God wants you to have that
[1:25:50] job you're going to have that job
[1:25:53] if God wants you to have that car that
[1:25:54] house that church building as we prayed
[1:25:56] for
[1:25:57] you're going to have that church
[1:25:58] building no matter how much they put the
[1:26:00] price up God's going to supply that
[1:26:02] Financial need it may come from a smile
[1:26:04] write a check for you or they may lower
[1:26:06] the price but God is going to supply
[1:26:07] that need what you have need of he's not
[1:26:10] going to feed your greeds but your needs
[1:26:11] that's what he's going to do he knows we
[1:26:13] have needs we need food on the table we
[1:26:16] need clothes to wear we need a car to
[1:26:17] drive we need heat in the winter he
[1:26:19] knows these things let him be the
[1:26:21] provider he is but you first be obedient
[1:26:25] God will honor your faithfulness to him
[1:26:27] every single time if you're faithful to
[1:26:28] God he'll be faithful to you and he
[1:26:30] would be faithful sometimes we're not
[1:26:31] faithful that's how the kind of God we
[1:26:33] serve a gracious and merciful god he's
[1:26:36] long-suffering
[1:26:39] are we doing on time not too bad
[1:26:42] um we finished let's go to
[1:26:45] see we're at
[1:26:47] oh
[1:26:48] that's your Battleground I wonder your
[1:26:50] quote your Battleground is back here at
[1:26:52] the beginning back here in the soul back
[1:26:54] in your mind that opens the mind is the
[1:26:56] gate to the soul the gate to the spirit
[1:26:58] rather so the gate to the spirit your
[1:27:00] mind opens up and accepts the spirit or
[1:27:03] rejects the spirit you have a little
[1:27:05] conscience and little feelings and
[1:27:07] Sensations all these things has nothing
[1:27:09] to do with it they're just little
[1:27:11] Sensations things but when it comes to
[1:27:14] reality your mind opens it up your mind
[1:27:16] either accepts it or rejects it that's
[1:27:18] it friends so Shadrach and Meshach and
[1:27:20] Abednego they had that same decision yes
[1:27:23] and they accepted God's word they
[1:27:25] accepted that word into him and they
[1:27:27] just whatever situation they would end
[1:27:29] up they still trusted God
[1:27:32] let none of them miss it see it's your
[1:27:34] mind that opens the door or closes the
[1:27:37] door
[1:27:38] listen to your conscience listen to your
[1:27:39] memory listen to your affections but
[1:27:41] when your mind closes itself to these
[1:27:43] things and let God the spirit of his
[1:27:46] word come in it blows the rest of that
[1:27:48] stuff I'll read it one more time maybe
[1:27:49] you didn't hear it okay I hear amen but
[1:27:51] when your mind closes itself to these
[1:27:53] things and let God the spirit of his
[1:27:56] word come in it blows the rest of the
[1:28:00] stuff out every doubt is gone every fear
[1:28:03] is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone
[1:28:06] every feeling is gone there's nothing
[1:28:08] standing in there but what the word of
[1:28:10] God and take this sentence out and Satan
[1:28:13] cannot battle against it one more time
[1:28:15] there is nothing standing in there but
[1:28:17] the word of God
[1:28:20] and Satan cannot battle against that he
[1:28:23] is powerless he is weak he's defeated
[1:28:25] creature he can do nothing in the
[1:28:27] presence of God he has to bow down he
[1:28:30] may not want to bow down but he has to
[1:28:31] bow down no matter what demon is on you
[1:28:33] or whatever it is whatever situation is
[1:28:35] on you that situation has to leave in
[1:28:37] the presence of God
[1:28:40] it's the kind of God we serve
[1:28:42] the demons couldn't even he permitted it
[1:28:46] and speak one word when he casts him in
[1:28:47] the into the uh the pigs and they were
[1:28:49] like oh you're coming to torment this
[1:28:51] already because they knew who they were
[1:28:53] standing in front of
[1:28:54] see the devil knows if you're connected
[1:28:56] or not to God he knows that he's not
[1:28:59] going to tremble if it's just you but if
[1:29:01] God inside of you he'll tremble that
[1:29:03] that's what he's going to tremble
[1:29:07] right no sir he cannot battle against it
[1:29:11] now we know
[1:29:13] that's true
[1:29:15] amen
[1:29:18] let's go to Daniel 6.
[1:29:21] we'll close here the next five minutes
[1:29:23] almost done
[1:29:26] 6 10. so now Daniel
[1:29:29] we see three chapters later
[1:29:32] it was a decree that you couldn't pray
[1:29:35] or anything like that but he still made
[1:29:38] the choice to pray he didn't care what
[1:29:42] they said in Babylon he was going to
[1:29:44] pray to his God
[1:29:45] even Jesus told us give give diseases
[1:29:48] with Caesar and God saw a God God
[1:29:50] deserves your praise no matter what
[1:29:51] Caesar saying if Caesar's going against
[1:29:53] the word of God then I'm following God
[1:29:55] every every time every single time 10
[1:29:57] times out of ten yes
[1:29:59] but it's a balance because if Caesar
[1:30:02] asks you to pay taxes pay taxes no no
[1:30:04] because they're going to get you
[1:30:05] eventually IRS are going to get you they
[1:30:08] if they owe you money they're going to
[1:30:10] take their sweet time but if you owe
[1:30:11] them money
[1:30:13] just speaking the truth
[1:30:17] so we always get God was God don't if
[1:30:20] you have convictions
[1:30:22] because a lot of times Christians we
[1:30:25] used to have all these convictions we
[1:30:26] used to have these strong convictions
[1:30:27] and we let them down
[1:30:34] that's when the goats come in all these
[1:30:37] things we used not to do we're starting
[1:30:38] to slowly implement it see the devil is
[1:30:40] truly trying to implement it slowly
[1:30:42] slowly trying to get in
[1:30:44] technology internet you got TVs on your
[1:30:47] phone all these things we got all these
[1:30:48] distractions we got
[1:30:51] not a bad thing to have technology not
[1:30:53] not at all but don't let technology rule
[1:30:55] your life that's what I'm trying to say
[1:30:57] so let's go to verse 10. now when Daniel
[1:30:59] knew that the writing was signed he went
[1:31:01] to his house he even I love that he even
[1:31:04] knew and he's I'm still going to pray
[1:31:06] and his windows he even opened the
[1:31:08] windows being open in his chamber toward
[1:31:10] Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees
[1:31:11] three times a day
[1:31:14] I think sometimes we can barely do it
[1:31:15] twice a day or once a day sometimes
[1:31:17] and he prayed with all the pressure he
[1:31:20] had against him
[1:31:21] everybody was against him in Babylon all
[1:31:23] these things he had a written bill from
[1:31:26] Congress
[1:31:28] that he couldn't even pray but he still
[1:31:30] made that choice to pray he prayed
[1:31:32] hardest one of his hardest to pray when
[1:31:34] everything was against him and we had to
[1:31:35] make that same decision
[1:31:37] same decision they're going to close
[1:31:39] these doors one day
[1:31:41] so every make sure you're in your post
[1:31:43] duty every time you can be
[1:31:45] every time because God wants to meet
[1:31:47] with you
[1:31:48] he actually he appointed this very time
[1:31:51] to meet with you the very God of heaven
[1:31:53] took time on his schedule to meet with
[1:31:55] you individually that's how much he
[1:31:58] loves you
[1:31:59] that's how much he wants to see you grow
[1:32:00] in his likeness in His image
[1:32:04] three times a day and he and he prayed
[1:32:06] and gave thanks before God as he did a
[1:32:08] fourth time then these men assembled
[1:32:10] from Daniel praying and making
[1:32:12] supplication before his God then they
[1:32:14] came near and spake before the Kings
[1:32:15] concerning the king's decree hast thou
[1:32:18] not signed a decree that every man that
[1:32:20] shall ask Petition of any God or man
[1:32:21] within 30 days of thee O King shall be
[1:32:24] cast Into the Dead of lions the king
[1:32:25] answer said the thing is true according
[1:32:27] to the law of the medes and Persians
[1:32:30] which alterth not then yesterday and
[1:32:33] said before the king that Daniel which
[1:32:35] is the children of the cafeteria of
[1:32:36] Judah regardeth not thee O King nor the
[1:32:39] decree that I was signed but make his
[1:32:41] petition three times a day
[1:32:43] and the King when he heard these words
[1:32:45] was so displeased with himself and set
[1:32:47] his heart on Daniel to deliver him and
[1:32:49] he labored till the going down of the
[1:32:52] son to deliver him
[1:32:55] then these men assembled unto the king
[1:32:57] and said unto the king now O King that
[1:32:59] the law of medes and Persians is that no
[1:33:01] decree nor statue which is the king
[1:33:03] established may be changed verse 16.
[1:33:05] then the king commanded and they brought
[1:33:07] Daniel and Castle into Lion's Den now
[1:33:09] the king spake and said unto Daniel thy
[1:33:12] God whom now service continued he will
[1:33:15] deliver thee he even had faith in his
[1:33:17] God
[1:33:18] Daniel had faith in his God he knew yeah
[1:33:21] I'm gonna get thrown in Lions then but
[1:33:23] God has a final say so God has a final
[1:33:26] say so to the decision you're in right
[1:33:28] now whatever it is he has the final say
[1:33:30] so don't let the Devils think he has the
[1:33:33] final say so but God has the final say
[1:33:36] so in your life he's the absolute
[1:33:39] and the stone was brought and laid upon
[1:33:42] the mouth of the dead and the King
[1:33:43] sealed with his own Signet with the
[1:33:45] sickness of his Lords and the purpose
[1:33:46] might be changed concerning Daniel then
[1:33:49] the king went to his Palace and passed
[1:33:51] the night fasting neither were
[1:33:53] instruments of Music brought before him
[1:33:55] and his sleep went before him while he's
[1:33:56] praying for him fasting
[1:33:58] then the king arose very early in the
[1:34:00] morning and went and haste into the den
[1:34:01] of lions and when he came to the den he
[1:34:03] cried with a little voice unto Daniel
[1:34:05] and the King spake and said to Daniel oh
[1:34:08] Daniel servant of the Living God is thy
[1:34:11] God who thou service continually able to
[1:34:12] deliver thee from the Lions then said
[1:34:14] Daniel unto the king O King live forever
[1:34:17] my God has sent his Angel and has shut
[1:34:20] the mouth of of lions they that hurt me
[1:34:24] for as much as before my identity was
[1:34:26] found in me and also before the O King
[1:34:28] have I done no hurt then was a king a
[1:34:31] seedly glad for him and commanded that
[1:34:33] they should take Daniel up out of the
[1:34:34] den So Daniel was taken up out of the
[1:34:36] den and no manner of hurt was found upon
[1:34:38] him because he believed in his God he
[1:34:40] had faith and the King commanded they
[1:34:42] brought those men's which was accused
[1:34:45] Daniel they cast them into the denim of
[1:34:47] lions then their children their wives
[1:34:49] and the Lions had the Mastery of them
[1:34:52] and broke their bones into pieces that
[1:34:55] came in the bottom look at the decisions
[1:34:56] they made and it caused their family to
[1:34:59] the parish there's that decision that
[1:35:00] they made
[1:35:02] and then we're gonna we're gonna close
[1:35:04] it right here we're going to reverse and
[1:35:05] close it now just looking at that just
[1:35:08] seeing that Daniel he prayed three times
[1:35:10] and if we look later in the chapter
[1:35:13] God said I heard your prayer every time
[1:35:15] it just it took time the angel was
[1:35:17] fighting here to take time so don't
[1:35:19] think that God isn't hearing your prayer
[1:35:21] he's going to answer in your due time
[1:35:23] you may want healing he knows it he's
[1:35:26] waiting for that perfect appointed time
[1:35:27] he's waiting for the right moment God is
[1:35:30] always on time always he's never late so
[1:35:33] have your faith and say Lord I don't
[1:35:35] know where it's going to happen but I
[1:35:36] know it's going to happen and I'm gonna
[1:35:38] be I'm I'm already accepting that Lord
[1:35:39] you ever healed me to speak into
[1:35:41] existence already
[1:35:43] speaking to existence all right it's got
[1:35:44] Isaiah 26 3. it's going to close at this
[1:35:47] last verse
[1:35:48] this is the key right here
[1:35:52] with anything you're asking for
[1:35:54] A Closer Walk
[1:35:56] anything
[1:36:00] so 26 3.
[1:36:02] says
[1:36:04] thou will keep him in perfect peace
[1:36:06] whose mind is stayed on thee because he
[1:36:12] trusted them one more time thou will
[1:36:14] keep him in perfect peace we all want
[1:36:16] perfect peace
[1:36:17] amen whose mind is stayed on me no
[1:36:21] matter the circumstances no matter the
[1:36:23] situation going on at home at work in
[1:36:25] life keep your mind stayed on him
[1:36:28] because because if you keep in mind if
[1:36:30] you can do that you're trusting in Him
[1:36:32] that's like keep your mind if you're
[1:36:33] trusting in Him but if you're not
[1:36:35] trusting in Him how can you keep your
[1:36:37] mind on him a double-minded man is
[1:36:39] unstable in all his ways so he said
[1:36:40] final final thought there's that
[1:36:43] scripture right there the power of a
[1:36:45] good decision right there
[1:36:48] stay into our feets our feets our feet
[1:36:54] amen
