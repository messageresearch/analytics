[5:00] true. So humble yourself and see what
[5:04] God will
[5:07] do.
[5:09] Amen. Humble yourself before your Lord

[5:24] air.
[5:27] Amen. There's no

[6:08] heart is
[6:11] true. So humble yourself and see what
[6:15] God will
[6:18] do. Amen.
[6:21] Amen.
[6:24] So that's my testimony.
[6:29] I was talking with uh uh young brother
[6:34] and sister that I know Friday night at
[6:37] brother Johnson's uh showing and
[6:40] and I told him I said you every person
[6:44] every person has a purpose in life.
[6:48] Amen. There's something that
[6:52] God wants you to do.
[6:56] Give him your heart
[6:59] first. Do that. I mean, before you do
[7:02] anything else, give him your heart.
[7:05] Before you get a job, give him your
[7:07] heart. Before you find a wife or a
[7:09] husband, give him your heart. Give him
[7:11] your heart. Give him
[7:14] everything. and then all these other
[7:17] things will be
[7:19] added.
[7:21] So I was telling brother John before
[7:23] service that we we went through we were
[7:26] looking
[7:28] um so brother Johnson and I we've been
[7:31] friends for a long time. He married us
[7:34] in
[7:36] 1976.
[7:37] Um, and we were privileged to bring him
[7:41] to church, the best we can tell, since
[7:44] April of 22.
[7:46] Amen. I didn't realize that it had been
[7:48] that long. Praise the Lord.
[7:52] [Applause]
[7:55] But, but
[7:58] uh, one time we had a long discussion in
[8:01] his driveway and I said, "Well, Brother
[8:02] Johnson," I said, "It's like this." I
[8:04] said, "If this is all God has for me to
[8:06] do right now, I'm happy doing what he
[8:09] wants me to do." See, you know, Brother
[8:12] Brandham said that. He said, "If God
[8:14] only called you to be a housewife, be
[8:16] the best housewife that you can be." You
[8:20] You say, "Oh, I can't do anything for
[8:22] the Lord." He says, "Raise your
[8:23] children. Teach them the ways of the
[8:25] Lord." If you say, "Oh, I can't." You
[8:28] know, you
[8:29] are I I I Don and I were just floored at
[8:35] the effect of just taking somebody to
[8:39] church for just a little while.
[8:43] Yeah. It just it's no big deal. We're
[8:46] just driving by your house every day.
[8:48] What kind of a Christian would I be if I
[8:50] said, "Ah, well, sorry. Can't I don't I
[8:52] got this nice back seat here. I can't
[8:54] pick you up."
[8:56] Give God your heart. Give him
[8:58] everything.
[9:01] And then the Lord will just take care of
[9:03] all the rest. Amen. So I sorry for
[9:08] talking and I promise well I can't
[9:12] promise. I try not to cry during the
[9:15] song
[9:16] service. My wife always says she says
[9:19] don't get him start crying because if he
[9:20] starts crying you can't get him to shut
[9:22] up.
[9:24] And I'm not a crier. I just don't do
[9:27] that.
[9:28] So when I when I do, then it's a bad
[9:32] place. I guess a good place. But let's
[9:35] bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we're so
[9:37] thankful, Lord,
[9:39] for the testimony that Brother and
[9:43] Sister Johnson have been to all of us
[9:45] over the years.
[9:47] And Lord Jesus, now he's stepped into
[9:49] his new body. He's stepped into those
[9:53] the new place, the place of rest, that
[9:55] place of peace, and we all desire to go
[9:58] there. I just pray that Lord, you'll
[10:03] accept our offerings. You'll accept the
[10:07] songs of our lips. Heavenly Father,
[10:09] you'll just come down and break the
[10:12] bread of life with us, Lord. Anoint our
[10:13] brother as he comes to minister. Give
[10:16] him liberty. And Lord Jesus, let us
[10:20] focus our hearts and our eyes on you,
[10:23] Lord Jesus, for you are the center of
[10:25] our
[10:26] lives. Everything else just dims when we
[10:29] look at you. I just pray that you'll
[10:32] just come and bless the service this
[10:33] morning. We love you and thank you for
[10:35] all things. In Jesus Christ's name we
[10:38] ask it. Amen.
[10:40] You may be seated. Amen.
[10:50] I remember the night I got the Holy
[10:53] Ghost. I was up at the altar and I was
[10:55] crying in my nose cuz I have bad
[10:57] sinuses. My nose was running like
[11:00] crazy. And I stopped, got some Kleenex.
[11:04] This brother goes, "What are you doing?"
[11:06] I says, "I can't
[11:07] [Laughter]
[11:09] breathe." And it wasn't long after that,
[11:11] boy, I got a fireball.
[11:15] And it has not stopped. I had one guy
[11:18] tell me one time, he says, "What is
[11:19] wrong with you?" I said, "I got saved. I
[11:21] found out all my sins are washed away
[11:24] and I ain't been right
[11:26] since." Love lifted
[11:29] me. Amen.
[11:31] I was sinking deep in sin, far from the
[11:37] peaceful
[11:40] shore, very deeply stained
[11:45] within, sinking to rise no more.
[11:51] But the master of the sea heard my
[11:57] desparing
[11:59] cry from the water lifted me now safe am
[12:09] I. Love lifted me.
[12:14] Love lifted
[12:18] me when nothing else could help. Love
[12:25] lifted
[12:27] me. Love lifted
[12:32] me. Love lifted me.
[12:38] And nothing else could have
[12:43] love
[12:45] lifted
[12:48] me. All my heart to him I give. Ever to
[12:54] him I'll
[12:57] cling. In his blessed presence live.
[13:03] Ever his praises sing.
[13:07] Love so mighty and so true merits my
[13:13] soul's best
[13:15] song. Faithful loving service to to him
[13:22] [Applause]
[13:25] belongs. Love lifted
[13:29] me. Love lifted me.
[13:35] And nothing else could help. Love lifted
[13:43] me. Love lifted
[13:48] me. Love lifted
[13:52] me. When nothing else could have
[13:59] love
[14:00] lifted me.
[14:04] Souls in danger. Look above. Jesus
[14:10] completely
[14:12] saves. He will lift you by his love out
[14:18] of the angry
[14:20] [Music]

[18:39] One of brother Johnson's favorite chorus
[18:41] is I'm going
[18:44] through. He'd be hobbling out of the
[18:47] garage. I said, "Come on, brother
[18:48] Johnson." He says, "I'm going to make
[18:50] it. Lord, I have started to walk in the
[18:56] light shineing upon me from heaven so
[19:02] bright. I made the world and its
[19:05] follyies are due. I've started in Jesus
[19:10] and I'm going
[19:12] through. I'm going through. Yes, I'm
[19:16] going through. I'll pay the price
[19:21] whatever others do. I'll take away with
[19:26] the Lord's despised view. I'm going to
[19:30] Jesus. Yes, I'm going through.
[19:35] Oh, there are many who start in this
[19:39] race but with the light refuse to keep
[19:44] pace. Others accept it because it is
[19:49] new. But not very many expect to go
[19:54] through. I'm going through. Yes, I'm
[19:58] going through. I'll pay the price
[20:03] whatever others do. I'll take the way
[20:08] with the Lord's despise view. I'm going
[20:12] to Jesus. Yes, I'm going through. I'd
[20:16] rather walk with Jesus alone and have
[20:22] for a pillow like Jacob a stone.
[20:26] living each moment with his face in
[20:30] view. Then drink from my pathway and
[20:34] failed to go
[20:35] through. I'm going through. Yes, I'm
[20:39] going
[20:41] through. I'll pay the price whatever
[20:45] others do. I'll take away with the
[20:49] Lord's despised view. I'm going through
[20:53] Jesus. Yes, I'm going to. Oh, brother,
[20:58] now will you take up the cross? Give up
[21:02] the world and count it as trust. Sell
[21:07] all thou hast and give to the poor. Then
[21:12] go through it, Jesus, and those who
[21:16] endure. I'm going through. Yes, I'm
[21:20] going through.
[21:22] I'll pay the price whatever others do.
[21:27] I'll take the way with the Lord despise
[21:31] you. I'm going to Jesus. Yes, I'm going
[21:36] through. I'm going through. Yes, I'm
[21:40] going
[21:41] through. I'll pay the price whatever
[21:45] others do.
[21:47] I'll take the way with the Lord's
[21:50] despise view. I'm going through Jesus.
[21:54] Yes, I'm going
[21:57] through. Amen.
[22:00] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[22:04] As we take up our prayer requests this
[22:06] morning, let's remember the Johnson
[22:09] family, also Sister Norma, that the Lord
[22:13] will just comfort them and give them
[22:16] wisdom. Let's also remember um Anna

[22:36] Tasha's gone in her
[22:39] house. Those holes don't get filled
[22:44] easily. Sister Linda Helm says, "Please
[22:46] pray for my friend Gracie Row. Her
[22:49] boyfriend has been abusing her. She
[22:51] needs a place to stay that's safe. She
[22:53] also has children as well that need to
[22:56] be cared for." Amen. Let's also pray for
[22:58] her salvation. Amen.

[32:22] I was thinking as we were singing that
[32:25] song I'll meet you in the eastern gate
[32:28] and um thinking about meeting brother
[32:32] Johnson there and then I thought about
[32:34] when he crossed
[32:37] over all the people that came up to him
[32:40] that have gone on before
[32:43] him and saying to him we wouldn't have
[32:45] made it if it would not been for
[32:48] you and I thought all the lights. Every
[32:51] one of them represent a light over there
[32:54] attached to him. As I was sitting there
[32:58] thinking, I thought heaven, who would
[33:01] who would not have someone coming up to
[33:03] them? And I thought to myself, one
[33:07] person who doesn't have anyone coming up
[33:10] to them that's attached to
[33:13] them, and that's the last soul that
[33:16] comes in.
[33:18] In other
[33:19] words, brother instructed by the prophet
[33:23] if we and brother Johnson
[33:26] often if God is lit us if we're saved
[33:31] we're duty bound to go share it with
[33:33] another person.
[33:36] And um the last one is the last one.
[33:41] And I'll just say like, you know, we we
[33:43] we need to be putting our treasures on
[33:47] the other side because one
[33:50] day we're going to all meet at the
[33:52] Eastern Gate. Amen. Amen. We want to

[37:27] [Music]
[37:30] Amen. You happy to be in the house of
[37:32] the Lord this morning? Have you come
[37:34] under an expectation? You know, brother
[37:37] Brandon would say that was the angel of
[37:38] the Lord's favorite song. Only believe.
[37:41] And I believe that's the attitude of the
[37:43] bride is Lord, I believe. No matter how
[37:46] impossible the situation or circumstance
[37:49] may look, I still believe. Amen. And um
[37:53] if you would have your Bibles, let's
[37:55] open our scriptures. I got a few
[37:57] different places. Ephesians 2 and
[38:01] 4, then Ephesians 1
[38:04] and3 and Luke
[38:07] 2:25. I'd like to say it is an honor to
[38:09] be here again this morning. Uh my
[38:11] family's not with me uh this time. Um
[38:15] that's why I'm wearing a vest this
[38:16] morning. I earned my own shirt and so I
[38:18] figured the vest would cover up all the
[38:20] wrinkles that I missed. And so, uh, I'm
[38:23] telling you what, I have a good wife
[38:25] that irons my clothes. And so, whenever
[38:27] I'm traveling by myself, I definitely
[38:28] miss
[38:29] her, but no, not just because she irons
[38:32] my clothes, but she's a a good
[38:34] companion. Those who travel at all, it's
[38:36] it's boring traveling by yourself.
[38:38] Nobody to talk to and things to keep you
[38:40] awake. And so, the Lord has blessed me
[38:42] with a a wonderful wife that that
[38:44] travels with me. A may I bring greetings
[38:47] from my home church, Brother Wendell
[38:49] Martin and the Saints at New Life
[38:50] Outreach. and their greetings. But
[38:52] Ephesians
[38:53] 2:4, the Bible would say, "But God, who
[38:57] was rich in mercy, for his great love
[39:00] wherewith he loved us, even when we were
[39:03] dead in sins, hath quickened us together
[39:06] with Christ. By grace ye are saved, and
[39:09] hath raised us up together, and made us
[39:12] sit together in heavenly places in
[39:15] Christ Jesus." Amen. Then Ephesians 1:3,
[39:19] we'll just read one verse out of this.
[39:22] Blessed be the God and father of our
[39:24] Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us
[39:26] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[39:30] places in Christ. And Luke
[39:34] 2:25, are you thankful for the reading
[39:37] of the word?
[39:38] Amen. Ephesians or Luke 2:25, behold,
[39:42] there was a man in Jerusalem whose name
[39:45] was Simeon. And the same man was just
[39:47] and devout, waiting for the consolation
[39:50] of Israel. And the Holy Ghost was upon
[39:53] him. And it was revealed unto him by the
[39:56] Holy Ghost that he should not see death
[39:59] before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
[40:01] And it came by the spirit unto the and
[40:04] he came by the spirit into the temple
[40:06] when the parents brought in the child
[40:08] Jesus to do for him after the custom of
[40:11] the law. Then he took him up in his arms
[40:13] and blessed God and said,"Lord, now let
[40:16] us thy servant depart in peace according
[40:19] to thy word. For mine eyes have seen thy
[40:23] salvation." Ain't that wonderful? For my
[40:25] eyes have seen thy salvation. Can we bow
[40:28] our heads this morning? Dear gracious
[40:30] heavenly father, Lord, what an honor it
[40:32] is to come into your house one more
[40:34] time, Lord, to feel your presence, God,
[40:36] to just have a freedom of worship, Lord,
[40:38] that we can come and lay aside our
[40:40] burdens and our our trials that we we
[40:43] went through throughout the week,
[40:45] Father. And Lord, as we come into this
[40:47] part of the service, God, as we would
[40:49] break the bread of life, we ask that you
[40:52] would just feel welcome among us, Lord.
[40:54] Just we ask that you would just draw
[40:56] near us, God, and you break the bread,
[40:58] Lord, where not a man is speaking,
[41:00] Father, but it's you speaking, Father,
[41:02] where you you breaking the bread by
[41:04] inspiration. Lord, may your anointing
[41:07] just come so so richly among us, Father.
[41:10] touch the hearts and and touch the needs
[41:12] today. Father, you know every situation,
[41:15] Lord. You know every every problem that
[41:18] is in the building this morning, Lord,
[41:20] and only you can meet it. Father, we ask
[41:22] that you would just feel welcome among
[41:24] us in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You may
[41:28] be seated this morning, and I just have
[41:30] a simple simple subject, but it would be
[41:33] expectations from the heavenlies. Amen.
[41:36] And brother Brandham would would read
[41:38] Ephesians 1 and would say, "Who has
[41:40] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[41:43] whereabouts in heavenly places in
[41:46] Christ?" He says, "Heavenly places." Oh,
[41:48] how I wished I had the time. Here, I've
[41:51] got them marked right here in my Bible
[41:53] about heavenly places. What is heavenly
[41:55] places? Heavenly places, just for a
[41:58] moment, is the believer's position in
[42:01] Christ. See, where the believer stands
[42:04] in Christ is heavenly places. And I
[42:07] believe that is something that that God
[42:09] has promised us for today. Not not
[42:12] something in the future where we we
[42:14] might be able to obtain it. You know,
[42:16] brother Brandon would talk about divine
[42:17] healing and would say many people put
[42:19] divine healing in the millennium. He
[42:21] says we won't need it in the millennium
[42:23] because we won't be sick. You know, so I
[42:25] believe that heavenly places, the
[42:27] position for the bride is something
[42:30] right now. I don't believe it's
[42:32] something to come or or something that
[42:34] that that will that that'll take place
[42:36] in the rapture, but I believe a heavenly
[42:39] position is happening right now where
[42:41] the bride can can step into a place and
[42:44] a fellowship with our Lord. And I
[42:46] believe that spiritual blessings is in
[42:49] this place. And and spiritual blessings,
[42:52] I believe, is is more than more than
[42:54] just a nice car and a and a nice house
[42:57] or a good job. We're thankful for those
[42:59] things. And those are the blessings of
[43:02] God. But God never promised us to have a
[43:05] good job. He never promised us. You
[43:07] know, last time I was here, I I just got
[43:09] back from Nicaragua. Many of them don't
[43:11] have electricity. They they they have
[43:13] huts. You know, that the the the
[43:15] churches that we was preaching in didn't
[43:17] have no no AC, no heating, and nothing
[43:20] like that. So, we're thankful for a nice
[43:22] building this morning with AC, with
[43:24] heat, with electricity. But does that
[43:27] mean that the Nicaraguans don't have the
[43:29] spiritual blessings of God? You see, God
[43:31] never promised us uh natural things like
[43:35] electricity. But he did promise us his
[43:37] spiritual blessings. He promised us that
[43:40] we can have healing for a body. He
[43:42] promised us that we can see a rapture.
[43:44] He promised us that we can that we can
[43:47] have all of these things because
[43:49] sometimes we get discouraged whenever we
[43:51] don't have a a lot of money in the bank
[43:53] account and we say, "God, have you
[43:55] forsaken us?" No, you might not have a
[43:57] lot of money in the bank account, but if
[44:00] you've got the spiritual blessings of
[44:02] God, that's what counts. If you've got a
[44:04] revelation of this message, I say we're
[44:07] a blessed people. Oh my, you might not
[44:10] have a lot of material things you can
[44:11] point to, but if you've got a revelation
[44:14] in this hour, you are a blessed people.
[44:17] And brother Brandon would tell us that
[44:19] this position is only for the church. He
[44:22] would say that the this position is not
[44:25] addressed to the world or to the
[44:27] outsider. He would say this is for the
[44:30] church that is in Christ Jesus. So I
[44:33] don't believe it's just the church, but
[44:35] it's the church. It's the called out
[44:38] that has been positioned in Christ
[44:40] Jesus. And the Bible would tell us that
[44:42] we're living in a day of gross darkness.
[44:45] The Bible would tell us that that the
[44:47] the Isaiah 60 and2 for behold darkness
[44:51] shall cover the earth. Right? Gross
[44:53] darkness the people, but the Lord shall
[44:56] arise upon thee, and his glory shall be
[44:59] seen upon thee. So I believe it's
[45:02] talking about two different classes of
[45:04] people. There's gross darkness that is
[45:06] coming upon the earth, not just upon the
[45:09] earth, but upon the people. But then the
[45:12] Bible says, "But the Lord shall arise
[45:14] upon thee, and the glory of the Lord
[45:17] shall be seen upon thee." So it ain't
[45:20] just rising upon the earth, but it's
[45:22] rising upon a people. Gross darkness is
[45:25] not just upon the earth, but it's upon
[45:28] the people. So I believe that that
[45:30] there's got to be a separation take
[45:32] place. I believe we're living amongst
[45:34] gross darkness. But we don't have to be
[45:37] a part of the gross darkness cuz the
[45:39] Bible would tell us there's been what
[45:42] 200,000,000 demons that has been
[45:44] released in this age. And and I don't
[45:47] believe it's spirits that you can see,
[45:50] but it's spirits in another dimension.
[45:52] Now, you might not see angels here, but
[45:54] they are here. You might not see spirits
[45:56] here, but they are here. It's two forces
[46:00] that are combating each other and we're
[46:02] going to fall subject to one of those
[46:05] forces. Right, brother Brown would tell
[46:08] us that it's been good and evil battling
[46:10] back and forth. It was Cain and Abel,
[46:12] Jesus and Judas. It all throughout the
[46:15] Bible. It was good and evil going back
[46:18] and forth. And I believe the gross
[46:20] darkness is an evil spirits that that
[46:23] are trying to come into homes, trying to
[46:25] come come into marriages, come into
[46:28] families, but at the same time, the
[46:31] glory of the Lord has risen upon you.
[46:34] So, we're going to fall subject. We're
[46:37] going to submit oursel to one of these
[46:40] forces. And brother Brandon would tell
[46:42] us that that man wants to look like
[46:44] women and women wants to look like man.
[46:46] It goes to show there's a perversion, a
[46:50] dark spirit hanging over, gross darkness
[46:53] over the people. He was saying in
[46:55] another place and I've come to the spot,
[46:58] I believe that people don't know what
[47:01] they're doing. It comes to the time to
[47:03] where the human being looks uh it looks
[47:06] like becomes such subject to evil. It's
[47:09] a pathetic thing. It seems like there's
[47:12] a shadow of darkness just over the
[47:15] people that is pressing them. Ain't that
[47:18] powerful? He says people has become so
[47:21] subject to evil that that this darkness
[47:24] is is literally pressing against them.
[47:28] And that's what we battle every time we
[47:30] go to work, every time we go to the
[47:32] store. and and I'm sure you're you're a
[47:34] witness of it as well that that you
[47:36] can't even go to Walmart and when you
[47:38] leave there's a heaviness that's over
[47:39] you rather there there's naked women
[47:42] everywhere there there's cursing and and
[47:44] this and that and and it's darkness that
[47:47] is pressing against you trying to make
[47:50] you subject to those spirits but I don't
[47:53] believe that we have to fall subject to
[47:56] the spirits that is pressing against you
[47:59] I don't believe that you have to fall
[48:01] subject object to spirits that is coming
[48:04] against your home, coming against your
[48:06] your family, coming against your
[48:08] children, coming against your marriage.
[48:10] But when the when the enemy comes in
[48:12] like a flood, the spirit of the Lord
[48:14] will rise up a standard against him. And
[48:17] I believe that God has lifted up a
[48:19] message him this generation and would
[48:21] say, "Come out of her, my people."
[48:24] Because there's a separation that has to
[48:27] take place. And the Bible would tell us
[48:29] in Exodus 8:22, "And I will sever in
[48:33] that day the land of Gan in which my
[48:35] people dwell that no swarms of flies
[48:39] shall be there. To the end thou mayest
[48:41] know that I am the Lord in the midst of
[48:44] the earth, and I will put division
[48:47] between my people and thy people." Yeah,
[48:51] I love it cuz that word sever means to
[48:54] be separated, to make separate, to set
[48:57] apart. And so here was Moses pronouncing
[49:00] judgment upon upon Egypt saying, "If you
[49:03] don't let my people go, there's going to
[49:05] be flies that's going to be that is
[49:07] going to come. There's going to be lies.
[49:09] There's going to be frogs. There's going
[49:10] to be all of these plagues. But I'm
[49:13] going to separate my people from thy
[49:16] people." that even though we're in
[49:18] Egypt, we're going to be in a land of
[49:21] Goan. Oh, hallelujah. And even though we
[49:24] are in Leodysa, brother Brand, I'm going
[49:27] say that we've been caught up in a
[49:29] bright age. Right? So even though we're
[49:31] amongst judgment, even though gross
[49:33] darkness is coming against the people,
[49:36] we have been separated into a bride age.
[49:40] But so so our body can be claimed by the
[49:43] glory of the Lord. And brother Brandon
[49:46] he brother Brandon would say this here
[49:48] he would say uh didn't Jesus say in the
[49:51] last days in Matthew 24 and 24 that the
[49:54] two would be so close that it would
[49:57] deceive the very genes the predestinated
[50:00] the elected ones if it was possible
[50:04] almost like the real thing. See, so in
[50:06] the last days, now you see it's wheat
[50:09] time now. It's getting harvest time.
[50:12] This is not Luther's age. This is not
[50:14] the Pentecostal's age. This is the bride
[50:17] age. As Moses called a nation out of a
[50:20] nation, Christ today is calling a church
[50:24] out of a church. You see the same thing
[50:27] in type, taking them to the glorious
[50:30] eternal promised land. So let just like
[50:33] Moses message was calling a nation out
[50:36] of a nation. Brother Brandham's message,
[50:39] this message is calling a bride out of a
[50:43] church. So the bride is fall or the
[50:45] church is falling subject to evil. You
[50:48] can look at all the church world.
[50:50] They're subject to evil. They're smoking
[50:52] like the rest of the world. They're
[50:54] they're cussing. They're they're
[50:55] dressing like the rest of the world.
[50:58] They have fallen subject to evil. But at
[51:01] the same time there has been a message
[51:04] Revelations 18 and4 would say and I
[51:06] heard another voice from heaven saying
[51:09] come out of her my people that ye be no
[51:12] partakers of her sins that ye receive
[51:15] not of her plagues. What was thy voice?
[51:18] It was the message saying come out of
[51:21] her my people that even though you're
[51:23] among the plagues you don't got to
[51:26] partake of them. Oh come on little
[51:28] church. Even when we see that divorces
[51:31] are up on the rampage, you don't have to
[51:33] partake of it. When you see that the the
[51:36] the rebellious teenagers are are going
[51:38] out into the world and and doing this
[51:39] and doing that, we don't have to partake
[51:42] of it. We can say we've been separated
[51:45] by the word of God and we can believe
[51:48] for the supernatural. Oh, hallelujah.
[51:51] You see, brother Brandon would say,
[51:52] passed from death and creed into a
[51:56] living word of the living God. God's
[51:58] only provided plan for his age for for
[52:02] this age. His sons in the word age
[52:05] quickened by the spirit like a spark
[52:08] that's lit off of something to make it
[52:11] alive and seated now in heavenly places.
[52:14] He says in past tense already alive
[52:18] subject to every promise in the word.
[52:21] Then what does that do? You being a part
[52:24] of God, of God's gene, a part of the
[52:27] word, other men a part of God's word,
[52:31] seated together, manifest the entire
[52:34] body of Christ. Ain't that powerful? So
[52:38] once we get caught up into heavenly
[52:40] places, then we we begin to to manifest
[52:44] the body of Jesus Christ. And I believe
[52:47] that's why we are upon earth today.
[52:50] We're not on earth to fall subject to
[52:52] the spirits of the world. We're not on
[52:54] earth to fall subject to lukewarmness
[52:57] and and laxness and formalism. We're not
[53:00] these are spirits of darkness that is
[53:02] pressing against you and you feel it
[53:04] every time you come to church, right?
[53:06] Every time you come to church and and
[53:08] you want to lift up your hands and
[53:10] worship the Lord, there's something that
[53:11] presses you that says, "Nah, you don't
[53:13] feel like it or what's so and so going
[53:15] to think?" You want to say amen to the
[53:18] word of God, but then the spirit presses
[53:20] you and says, "What is this one going to
[53:22] say? Maybe I'll get too loud and and
[53:24] I'll disturb somebody else." It's the
[53:26] spirits of darkness trying to damper you
[53:30] down. Oh my. You see, no brother Brandon
[53:32] would say that you get what you expect,
[53:35] right? You pull out of the minister what
[53:37] you expect. And so whenever you say
[53:40] amen, you're defying the darkness and
[53:43] saying, "God, seat me in heavenly places
[53:46] so that I can see the miraculous." I
[53:49] want to see the miraculous in my life. I
[53:51] know that's your desire as well. I know
[53:53] you want to see the miraculous in this
[53:55] church. You want to see the miraculous
[53:57] in your family, in your children. Well,
[54:00] you can see it whenever you defy the
[54:02] darkness and say, "Lord, catch me up in
[54:06] heavenly places so that I can see the
[54:09] miraculous." Amen. Amen. Oh, you may see
[54:12] how do we get into this heavenly place
[54:14] by the word of God. Oh, hallelujah. As
[54:18] you feed upon the message, Brother
[54:20] Brandon would tell us that we're
[54:22] heavenlies in our souls. Let me try to
[54:24] find that. Brother Brandon would say
[54:26] this here. He says, "Oh, let's stop one
[54:28] more minute here in heavenly places."
[54:31] Now, not just out anywhere, but in
[54:33] heavenly places. We are assembled in
[54:36] heavenly. And then that means that's the
[54:38] position of the believer that if I'm
[54:41] prayed up, you're prayed up, the church
[54:44] is prayed up, we're ready for the
[54:46] message. Oh my. So, you've got something
[54:49] to do as well. Oh, come on now. It's
[54:52] It's not just the preacher being prayed
[54:55] up. It's not just the song leader being
[54:57] prayed up, but if you're prayed up, that
[54:59] when the message does come, oh, when he
[55:02] says we're ready for the message, we
[55:04] have assembled ourselves together as
[55:06] saints, called out, baptized with the
[55:08] Holy Ghost, filled with God's blessings,
[55:10] called elected, set together in heavenly
[55:13] places. We are heavenlies in our souls.
[55:17] Our spirits has brought us into a
[55:20] heavenly atmosphere. He says, "Oh,
[55:22] brother, there you are. A heavenly
[55:25] atmosphere. Oh, what could happen
[55:27] tonight? What could happen tonight if we
[55:30] would be sitting in a heavenly
[55:32] atmosphere?" So, what catches you up in
[55:35] this heavenly atmosphere when you're
[55:37] prayed up, when you're ready to go and
[55:40] as the word comes across the pull pit,
[55:42] comes across your your tape player,
[55:45] across your phone, your your your
[55:46] tablet, whatever it is, and you're ready
[55:49] and that word strikes that soul and then
[55:52] it lifts you up where you're heavenly in
[55:54] your soul. Oh, that's what this message
[55:57] come to do to contact your soul and not
[56:00] your flesh man, not your spirit man. You
[56:02] know, cuz brother Brandon would tell us,
[56:04] and I think I talked about this before
[56:05] last time that we're trium being, right?
[56:08] We're body, we're soul, and we're
[56:09] spirit, right? And brother Brandon would
[56:11] tell us that that that our body has five
[56:14] senses, right? It's taste, it's smell,
[56:16] it's here, it's feel,
[56:19] and and it's tight. Thank you. And then
[56:22] you have the spirit man. But the brand
[56:24] says you've got five senses to the
[56:25] spirit man, right? He says it's the
[56:27] imagination, its reasoning, its
[56:29] conscience, its
[56:31] affection, and its memory. And he says,
[56:33] but then that soul only has two senses,
[56:37] right? It's faith and its doubt. And
[56:39] then he would tell us that your faith
[56:42] rescues you from those five senses. And
[56:45] so your spirit man is still going to
[56:47] reason. It's still going to to remember
[56:50] the things you used to do. It's a it's
[56:52] it's going to your conscience is going
[56:54] to be there. affection is going to be
[56:56] there. But the faith from the soul
[57:00] rescues you. Oh, hallelujah. And what
[57:03] did Malachi 4 come to do? To turn your
[57:06] heart back to the faith of the original
[57:09] fathers. Right? So once there's a faith
[57:11] established in that soul, it rescues you
[57:15] from those five senses that tries to
[57:18] bring you out of the heavenlies and back
[57:21] into an earthly realm. Oh my. How do you
[57:24] get the faith? By the word of God,
[57:26] right? Faith cometh by hearing and
[57:28] hearing the word of God. So, as you feed
[57:31] upon this message, it's building up a
[57:34] faith. It's building up a faith in that
[57:37] soul that is calling you up into a
[57:40] heavenly height where you can believe
[57:43] that all things are possible.
[57:46] Even when you don't see anything
[57:47] different, it's still heavenly in the
[57:49] soul. Oh, come on now. When your
[57:52] situation ain't changing, there is still
[57:54] a faith that is rescuing you from that
[57:58] soul. Oh, hallelujah. Brother Brandon
[58:00] was saying now you you'll be crazy to
[58:02] the world when you do that because you
[58:05] come out of this atmosphere that you're
[58:07] in into another
[58:10] atmosphere. He says when that when you
[58:12] do that, God lifts you up from the world
[58:15] and you live in a heavenly atmosphere.
[58:19] And 11, brother Brandham, he he putting
[58:21] in another place in heavenly places in
[58:24] Christ Jesus. For we claim that we have
[58:27] passed from death unto life by his
[58:29] promise. And we are caught up in a
[58:32] heavenly atmosphere sitting with him
[58:35] right now. And I love it. Brother
[58:37] Brandham, he he he would put heavenly
[58:39] places as an atmosphere. Oh my. You see,
[58:42] sometimes we we fail to realize how
[58:45] important atmosphere is. Come on. Come
[58:47] on. Now, Brother Brandon would say that
[58:49] the things you talk about creates an
[58:51] atmosphere. The things you look at
[58:53] creates an atmosphere. The way you act
[58:56] creates an atmosphere. And he would tell
[58:58] us that we're miniature creators. Right?
[59:01] He would tell us that there's there's
[59:03] some people that you don't like to be
[59:04] around. Right? And he says, "How come?"
[59:07] Because it's the atmosphere that they're
[59:09] creating. But then there's other people
[59:11] that you can go to and and you'll pick
[59:13] up like you like you never left each
[59:15] other. and you and you go to talking. He
[59:17] says it's because it's the atmosphere.
[59:20] Oh my. You see, sometimes it's God
[59:23] trying to call us into heavenly places,
[59:26] but the atmosphere we're creating, oh,
[59:29] come on. It's keeping us earthbound. Oh,
[59:32] I'm preaching now. You remember that
[59:34] little eagle that was in the barnyard
[59:36] and before he can get into the heights,
[59:38] he had to let go of the earth. Amen.
[59:41] Right? Because maybe brother Brandon
[59:42] would tell us that the rest of the
[59:43] chickens were saying, "You're crazy.
[59:46] There's no way you can get up there.
[59:47] What are you doing?" But he would start
[59:49] to flap those wings. And as he would
[59:51] flap those wings, he was defying he was
[59:54] defying the the the the pull of gravity
[59:58] upon his body and then he would get up
[1:00:00] on the he would get up on the fence,
[1:00:02] right? He would then would get up on the
[1:00:03] barn. He would then start to go higher
[1:00:06] and higher. It did not happen right
[1:00:08] away. Oh, you see, sometimes the devil
[1:00:10] gets us discouraged because we don't see
[1:00:13] things happening right away. But as long
[1:00:15] as you're feeding upon this message,
[1:00:18] you're defying the gravity of this earth
[1:00:21] that is trying to keep you down. You're
[1:00:23] defying the darkness that is trying to
[1:00:26] press against you. Oh, and every time
[1:00:28] you listen to a message, you're flapping
[1:00:30] those wings and a little higher you go.
[1:00:32] A little higher you go. And one day,
[1:00:34] you're going to realize, where am I? I
[1:00:37] stepped out of this dimension into my
[1:00:39] body change. That is what this message
[1:00:41] is doing. It's calling us up higher and
[1:00:44] higher and higher until we step into our
[1:00:47] body change. Amen.
[1:00:49] Oh, hallelujah. But you see, sometimes
[1:00:52] it's our atmosphere that we create that
[1:00:55] pulls us down. But you can change your
[1:00:57] atmosphere. That's right. Come on now.
[1:00:59] You remember brother Brown? I'm going to
[1:01:00] talk about the time that he would come
[1:01:02] home and and his children were
[1:01:04] screaming. Y'all remember the story? And
[1:01:06] his wife was crying. She hadn't cooked
[1:01:09] any any breakfast yet or any any food
[1:01:12] for the children yet. The dishes wasn't
[1:01:14] done. The the house was erect. And what
[1:01:16] would happen? Brother Brandon would walk
[1:01:18] into that house. And she would say,
[1:01:20] "Billy, I'm going to lose my mind. I
[1:01:23] think I'm going crazy." And many
[1:01:26] housewives sometimes feel that way,
[1:01:27] right? I know my my my wife feels that
[1:01:30] way sometimes. My my my children act
[1:01:32] like their mother and they're crazy
[1:01:33] sometimes, you
[1:01:35] know. Now, she I'm the on one as you as
[1:01:38] you can tell. But but sometimes mothers
[1:01:41] get that way. But what would brother
[1:01:42] Brandham do? And I love how Brother
[1:01:44] Brandham, he he would show that he was
[1:01:46] human too. That his wife was human, too.
[1:01:49] His children were human, too. His his
[1:01:52] home life was humanity. He would walk
[1:01:55] into that house and and his wife felt
[1:01:58] like she was going to lose her mind. And
[1:02:00] what would brother Brandham do? Brother
[1:02:02] Brandham says he would start to talk to
[1:02:04] her. And all all the while that he was
[1:02:07] talking to her, he was praying. He was
[1:02:10] praying saying, "Lord, she has stood for
[1:02:12] you." The reason her hair is all gray is
[1:02:15] because of my ministry. And I'll ask I
[1:02:18] ask that you would come and and be with
[1:02:21] her right now. And what would brother
[1:02:22] Brandham do? Brother Brandham says he
[1:02:24] would go and start to wash the dishes.
[1:02:27] He would say, "Honey, I'm going to cook
[1:02:28] some supper. I see you haven't cooked no
[1:02:30] supper for the children yet. I'm going
[1:02:32] to cook supper tonight. And brother
[1:02:34] Brandham says she would look at him and
[1:02:36] say, "Billy, you don't know how to
[1:02:38] cook." And what would he say? Oh, you
[1:02:40] have not tried my mashed potatoes. You
[1:02:42] have never tried my potatoes yet. What
[1:02:44] was he doing? He was not be he was not
[1:02:47] becoming subject to the darkness. Come
[1:02:50] on now. He was not falling subject to
[1:02:54] the darkness that was pressing. Oh, come
[1:02:57] on, fathers. Come on, mothers. You don't
[1:03:00] got to fall subject to the darkness, the
[1:03:03] presses against your home, the presses
[1:03:06] against your mind, the presses against
[1:03:08] your children. And what would brother
[1:03:10] Brandham say? He says, "Then she would
[1:03:12] come back around smiling." He says,
[1:03:14] "What happened? I changed the
[1:03:16] atmosphere." That is somebody that is in
[1:03:19] heavenly places that refused to be
[1:03:23] dictated by the darkness of the world.
[1:03:26] He was among the darkness, but not a
[1:03:28] part of the darkness. You're among the
[1:03:30] darkness, but you're not a part of it.
[1:03:33] Oh, come on now. We are an eagle that
[1:03:36] has been called for the heights. You're
[1:03:38] not called to be in darkness. You're
[1:03:41] called to be in light.
[1:03:44] Hallelujah. We're heavenlies in our
[1:03:47] souls. You see, we've been caught up
[1:03:49] into a place. And and what is so
[1:03:52] incredible is brother Brandon would tell
[1:03:53] us that heavenly places is an
[1:03:56] atmosphere, a heavenly atmosphere. So
[1:03:59] not just any atmosphere, but it's a
[1:04:01] heavenly atmosphere. And he would tell
[1:04:03] us some things that was in this heavenly
[1:04:06] atmosphere. He was in a prayer line one
[1:04:08] time and there was a lady that would
[1:04:10] that would that would come close to him
[1:04:12] in this prayer line and she would start
[1:04:14] to cry. And brother Brandham says she
[1:04:16] realizes there's something different
[1:04:18] right here. She don't know what it is,
[1:04:20] but it's the angel of the Lord in this
[1:04:23] heavenly atmosphere. And so this lady
[1:04:27] could not could not declare what was
[1:04:29] there. But there was a prophet that can
[1:04:32] look into that other dimension that can
[1:04:35] look into that other atmosphere and
[1:04:37] declare what was there. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:04:40] Another time he would say he he he would
[1:04:43] say good friends in this heavenly
[1:04:45] atmosphere he says the angels of God are
[1:04:49] mingling near. Amen. And I love that
[1:04:51] because we cannot see them naturally.
[1:04:54] We're dictated by five senses. Right?
[1:04:57] We're dictated. If you you can't see
[1:04:59] radio waves here until there's a radio
[1:05:02] that catches you. Then you can know what
[1:05:04] is being said. Right? There's pictures
[1:05:07] going through here. But you can't see
[1:05:09] them until there there's a phone or a
[1:05:11] television that brings those pictures
[1:05:14] from that other dimension into this
[1:05:16] dimension. And so we we cannot see
[1:05:19] what's in that other dimension. But
[1:05:21] there was a prophet that could right
[1:05:23] where the Brandon would tell us that he
[1:05:24] he would have to pinch himself sometimes
[1:05:27] to see if he was here or in a vision. He
[1:05:30] lived most of his life in that other
[1:05:32] dimension. He was a prophet. So God
[1:05:34] would send us somebody that would tell
[1:05:37] us what was in that heavenly atmosphere.
[1:05:40] Oh, but but let me say this. But God was
[1:05:43] not just happy with just a prophet
[1:05:46] experiencing these things. Cuz brother
[1:05:48] Brandham then would tell us he would say
[1:05:50] when by faith when he catches the word
[1:05:53] it sends him into another dimension. Oh
[1:05:57] my. So now it's not just us believing or
[1:06:00] or or saying well brother Brandham says
[1:06:02] there's angels here but our faith sends
[1:06:05] us into heavenly places where we believe
[1:06:09] that those angels are mingling here. Oh
[1:06:12] my. You see spiritual blessings are in
[1:06:15] heavenly places. But it's not just good
[1:06:18] enough for you to say well brother
[1:06:19] Brandham told us this and brother
[1:06:21] Brandham told us that. What do you
[1:06:22] believe? It's got to go from just saying
[1:06:25] brother Brandon believes it. said, "Do
[1:06:27] you believe it?" And your faith in the
[1:06:29] word of God sends you into heavenly
[1:06:32] places where all the spiritual blessings
[1:06:35] are at your disposal. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:06:38] Oh, hallelujah. What else is in heavenly
[1:06:41] places? Brother Brown, I'm going to tell
[1:06:43] us. Blessing us with what? Divine
[1:06:45] healing, fornowledge, revelation,
[1:06:48] visions, powers, tongues,
[1:06:50] interpretations, wisdom, knowledge, all
[1:06:52] the heavenly blessings, joy unspeakable,
[1:06:55] full of glory, every heart filled with
[1:06:58] the spirit walking together, sitting
[1:07:01] together in heavenly places. Not one
[1:07:03] evil thought among us, not one cigarette
[1:07:06] smoke, not one short dress, not one
[1:07:08] this, that, or the other, not one evil
[1:07:11] thought. Nobody got anything against one
[1:07:13] another. Everybody speaking in love and
[1:07:16] harmony. Everybody with one accord in
[1:07:20] one place. That's spiritual blessings in
[1:07:23] heavenly places. Your joy, your your
[1:07:26] your happiness, your peace is in
[1:07:29] heavenly places. And it's your faith
[1:07:31] that can usher you into that heavenly
[1:07:34] atmosphere. Right? Oh, you see those are
[1:07:37] potentials. You see potentials. And like
[1:07:40] like brother Brand, I'm going to talk
[1:07:41] about a about an acorn seed, right? He
[1:07:44] would say, "If you want a tree and I
[1:07:45] give you an acorn seed," he says, "When
[1:07:48] once you plant that," he says it's got
[1:07:50] to grow. But before you plant it, it's
[1:07:52] just potentially a tree. He will talk
[1:07:55] about the apple tree. And we see every
[1:07:57] bushel of apples is in that apple seed,
[1:08:00] but you got to plant it first, right?
[1:08:03] So, it's potentially apples, but it's
[1:08:05] never manif manifestation of apples
[1:08:08] until it's planted. You're seeing
[1:08:10] spiritual blessings are only potentials
[1:08:14] until you are planted in heavenly
[1:08:16] places. Amen. Amen. Then it goes from
[1:08:19] just potentially having a peace to
[1:08:22] having a revelation of my peace. Oh, you
[1:08:26] see, I believe that God has not just
[1:08:28] called us to potentially be the bride of
[1:08:30] Christ, but he has called us and placed
[1:08:33] us in heavenly places that we are acting
[1:08:37] like the bride of Christ. Oh, come on
[1:08:39] now. We're not beggars saying God,
[1:08:41] please, please, please, please. But we
[1:08:43] are the bride of Christ that has been
[1:08:45] placed in our position. And there's an
[1:08:48] authority where I'm claiming my
[1:08:50] children. I'm claiming my body change.
[1:08:52] I'm claiming a rapture. It is mine. All
[1:08:55] the spiritual blessings are mine in
[1:08:58] heavenly places. Amen. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:09:02] That's your position. Amen. That's who
[1:09:05] you are. You know, Brother Brand, I'm
[1:09:07] going to talk about the little cop,
[1:09:08] right? He would say, "There can be cars
[1:09:10] flying by at 70 m an hour, and there can
[1:09:13] be a little cop that weigh hardly
[1:09:15] anything with with with his hat covering
[1:09:18] up his eyes." But he says, "Let him step
[1:09:20] into the street with that little whistle
[1:09:22] and blow that whistle." And he says,
[1:09:25] "All of those cars come to a screeching
[1:09:27] halt." He says, "How come he don't have
[1:09:30] the power to do it?" But what did he
[1:09:32] say? He had the authority to do it. He
[1:09:36] had nothing in his own ability. But he
[1:09:38] says all of the city was behind him. Oh
[1:09:42] little church, you might knock the power
[1:09:44] to to battle spirits, but you've got the
[1:09:47] authority. All of heavens and earth.
[1:09:50] What would Jesus say? All of heavens and
[1:09:52] earth is is behind me. Is that my
[1:09:54] disposal? But then he would tell you,
[1:09:57] you speak the word. Whatever you what
[1:10:00] whatever you say with faith, it'll
[1:10:02] happen. You speak to the mountain. You
[1:10:04] say you speak to the tree. You speak
[1:10:06] just like Adam whenever he was in garden
[1:10:08] in the garden of Eden. That's why we've
[1:10:11] been we've been brought back to
[1:10:14] Oh, my brother Brandon would tell us
[1:10:15] that the the the the Adam in the Garden
[1:10:18] of Eden would say if a storm would come,
[1:10:21] he would say, "Peace, be still." Right?
[1:10:23] He would say, "Storm, go away." And the
[1:10:24] storm would go away. If it was too hot,
[1:10:27] brother Brandham says he would speak to
[1:10:29] the tree and would say tree be plucked
[1:10:31] up and planted over here. Right? He says
[1:10:33] he wasn't running from Leo the lion. He
[1:10:35] was petting Leo the lion. But once he
[1:10:38] fell from this position, he says now
[1:10:41] he's running from the storm. Right now
[1:10:43] he's running from Leo the lion. He's
[1:10:45] running from things because he fell from
[1:10:47] his authority. He fell from his
[1:10:50] position. But this pride, you see, I
[1:10:53] don't believe prosperity gospel. Amen.
[1:10:55] Come on now. I don't believe that we're
[1:10:57] speaking for a million dollars. Brother
[1:10:59] Brandon would say whatever God leads
[1:11:01] your soul to believe. You see, God ain't
[1:11:04] going to lead your soul to believe for a
[1:11:06] million dollars. I'm sorry, but God will
[1:11:08] lead your soul to believe for your
[1:11:10] healing. Amen. Cuz brother Brandon would
[1:11:13] say when you speak the word, he says
[1:11:14] when you ask for healing, he says,
[1:11:16] "What's your motive and objective?"
[1:11:18] Right? He says, "What are you going to
[1:11:20] do with your healing? What are you going
[1:11:23] to do with your healing or your
[1:11:25] deliverance? What are you going to do
[1:11:26] with it? That's we got to we got to run
[1:11:29] our our requests by your motives and
[1:11:32] objectives. Well, Brandon, tell us that
[1:11:35] cuz God ain't going to heal you if
[1:11:36] you're going to go out and sin, right?
[1:11:39] God ain't going to heal you if you're
[1:11:40] going to use that for something else.
[1:11:42] So, our motive and our objective has to
[1:11:45] be the right way. Then once we speak the
[1:11:48] word and our motive is pure for our
[1:11:51] healing, then watch God bring that
[1:11:53] miracle.
[1:11:55] Hallelujah. Oh my. You see, but there
[1:11:57] potentials until we get into heavenly
[1:12:00] places. But sometimes that it's it's
[1:12:02] hard to get into this place, you know,
[1:12:05] cuz brother Brown, I'm going to say this
[1:12:06] here. And now to you that's here and
[1:12:09] you're needing healing for your body. He
[1:12:11] says, "How many believers are here?
[1:12:13] Raise your hand. I'm a believer as far
[1:12:16] as I know my heart and in my in my heart
[1:12:18] he says how many possesses you know
[1:12:20] beyond a shadow of doubt that in your
[1:12:23] heart right now you've been raised from
[1:12:25] the dead you know oh my what could
[1:12:28] happen in a meeting like this I know I'm
[1:12:31] late but what could happen right now
[1:12:34] just think of what could take place the
[1:12:37] potentials are laying in you right now
[1:12:41] amen the potentials are laying in you
[1:12:44] right now. But brother Brandon would
[1:12:46] tell us a secret. He would preach in the
[1:12:48] message pardon and would say the church
[1:12:50] ought to be a million miles up the road.
[1:12:53] And he says Christ is waiting for the
[1:12:55] church to get there. But he and he says
[1:12:58] the potentials are laying there. But he
[1:13:00] says something's wrong. You know what he
[1:13:02] says is wrong? He says we go to rituals.
[1:13:05] We have our traditions. But he says
[1:13:07] there's no sincerity.
[1:13:09] Oh my. You see, sometimes we get to that
[1:13:13] place. Brother Brand, I'm going to talk
[1:13:14] about the denominations. He says there's
[1:13:16] many people coming to the altar. They're
[1:13:18] giving their heart to Christ, but he
[1:13:20] says they're chewing their bubble gum,
[1:13:21] right? He says they're hitting one
[1:13:23] another and laughing and snickering. He
[1:13:25] says there's no sincerity. And here the
[1:13:28] potentials is laying there, but they're
[1:13:31] not willing to get sincere enough to be
[1:13:33] caught up in heavenly places.
[1:13:37] Oh, come on. Now, what brother Brandham
[1:13:39] say about the third pool? He's got to be
[1:13:41] more sincere. Right up with a brand of a
[1:13:43] prophet. How to be more sincere. What
[1:13:46] about us? We got to be more sincere.
[1:13:49] It's more than just books and tapes.
[1:13:51] It's our life. Come on now. It's more
[1:13:54] than just listening to a sermon. It's my
[1:13:56] inheritance. You see, brother Brandon
[1:13:59] would talk about Zakius. And he says,
[1:14:01] "Sometimes God gets a man to do the
[1:14:04] ridiculous to see how determined he is
[1:14:07] to get to Jesus." He would say that. He
[1:14:09] would talk about Zakius. I'm going say
[1:14:12] Zakius was a tax collector. You I know a
[1:14:15] simple story. He was a tax collector, a
[1:14:17] man of prestige and wealth, but he had a
[1:14:20] desire to see Jesus. And what I love
[1:14:22] about the story of Zakius is the Bible
[1:14:25] said he desired to see Jesus who he was.
[1:14:29] So he didn't want to just see the body
[1:14:30] of Jesus. He wanted to see who was
[1:14:33] inside of that body. And you know what
[1:14:35] happened? Brother Brandham said that he
[1:14:37] could not get to Jesus. And so he would
[1:14:39] come up to a tree and brother Brandham
[1:14:41] says that would grab a trash can and
[1:14:44] push it up to that tree, climb on top of
[1:14:47] that trash can and then would climb the
[1:14:49] tree. He says God was having Kim to do
[1:14:51] the ridiculous. Oh. He says sometimes
[1:14:54] God causes us to do the ridiculous. Come
[1:14:58] on now. You see sometimes we're not
[1:15:00] sincere enough to do the ridiculous.
[1:15:04] Oh, come on now. Hope this is okay this
[1:15:07] morning. What does that mean? If when
[1:15:09] we're sincere enough to do the
[1:15:10] ridiculous, we'll throw things out of
[1:15:12] our home, right? Oh, I'm preaching now.
[1:15:15] We'll throw we'll delete things off our
[1:15:17] phone. We'll delete things off of this.
[1:15:19] We'll throw clothes away cuz we're
[1:15:21] sincere enough to do the ridiculous. I
[1:15:24] want to do what it takes to see the
[1:15:27] potentials come to manifestation.
[1:15:30] I don't want to just say, "Thank God for
[1:15:32] the message. Thank God for healing." But
[1:15:34] it's only potentials. Come on, you with
[1:15:36] me now? I don't want to just potentially
[1:15:39] have these things. I want to see the
[1:15:41] realities of these things. Oh my. But
[1:15:45] Brandon, tell us. But that but in order
[1:15:48] to be persistent, you have to know that
[1:15:51] what you're after, you can achieve it.
[1:15:54] And that that is something that really
[1:15:55] spoke to my heart because sometimes the
[1:15:58] potentials of God or something that's
[1:16:00] unachievable. How many's ever thought
[1:16:02] that before? That I know God can heal,
[1:16:04] but it's not for me. Sometimes we can
[1:16:07] have more faith praying for somebody
[1:16:09] else than for yourself, right? Because
[1:16:11] you don't think you can achieve it. It's
[1:16:14] like losing weight. How many's ever been
[1:16:15] on a
[1:16:16] diet? You see, and I've lost I've lost
[1:16:19] about 40 pounds. I started last year
[1:16:21] around January. And man, I had tried for
[1:16:25] most of my life. I've always been a
[1:16:27] pudgy boy, you know, always had to wear
[1:16:29] the husky the husky jeans, you know, and
[1:16:32] I've always tried. I always tried to
[1:16:34] lose weight. But what would happen is I
[1:16:37] would get motivated. I would say, you
[1:16:38] know what, I can do this. I'm going to
[1:16:40] start working out. I'm going to go on a
[1:16:42] diet. And the first four to five days,
[1:16:44] I'm motivated until I don't see no
[1:16:46] results. Right? Then what happens? You
[1:16:49] tap out mentally. Your mind says you
[1:16:52] can't achieve it. It's something it's
[1:16:54] not even worth trying for. So once I
[1:16:56] started to think I could not achieve it,
[1:16:59] I'm not going to I'm not I'm not willing
[1:17:00] to persevere. Right. Right. And
[1:17:02] sometimes the devil does that to us
[1:17:04] spiritually. We can't achieve the
[1:17:07] potentials of God. So why be
[1:17:09] persevering? Oh, but we need a church
[1:17:12] that is persevering. Amen. Even when our
[1:17:15] spirit man, our affection and our
[1:17:17] reasoning and our memory is saying
[1:17:19] anything everything else contrary.
[1:17:21] There's a faith that is perseverant that
[1:17:24] says, "I'm going to see a revival. I'm
[1:17:27] going to see my children saved no matter
[1:17:29] what it cost. No matter if I have to do
[1:17:31] the ridiculous, I'm perseverant.
[1:17:34] I'm going to see him. Oh, mighty man.
[1:17:37] And the story of Zakius is brother
[1:17:39] Brandham says he would push up a trash
[1:17:40] can, climb up the tree, and he would
[1:17:42] come to the fork of the tree. And he
[1:17:44] says that's where the New Testament and
[1:17:46] the Old Testament met. And he says right
[1:17:48] there, he was in position to see Jesus.
[1:17:51] And what would happen? So once he got up
[1:17:54] on the fork of the tree, it wasn't him
[1:17:56] crying Jesus, Jesus. It was now Jesus
[1:17:59] saying, "Zakayas, Zakayas." So once he
[1:18:03] was willing to do the ridiculous, then
[1:18:06] it was Jesus seeking out him. Oh, come
[1:18:10] on now. Once you're willing to persevere
[1:18:12] and press into a service and press to
[1:18:15] get into your prayer closet, press to
[1:18:17] listen to a tape, press on a Wednesday
[1:18:19] night whenever your pastor is preaching,
[1:18:21] then it's Jesus coming your way and
[1:18:24] says, "Ji, whatever your name is, Aus,
[1:18:27] I'm coming to your house today."
[1:18:30] It was a kiss that was willing to
[1:18:33] persevere. Then the potentials would
[1:18:36] come into realization, come into
[1:18:38] reality. Oh man, what would happen next?
[1:18:40] Cuz Jesus would say, "Zakayas, come down
[1:18:43] there. Come down from there for I must
[1:18:45] abide in your house." What does that
[1:18:47] word abide mean? To take up residence.
[1:18:49] But Jesus would leave, right? So that
[1:18:52] mean Jesus lied? No. Cuz remember Zakius
[1:18:55] wanted to see Jesus in who he was. So
[1:18:58] the body of Christ left, but the
[1:19:01] revelation of Jesus abided in that home.
[1:19:04] Oh, come on now. The we've got brother
[1:19:06] Brandham's went off the scene. The
[1:19:08] corporate body of Jesus is no longer
[1:19:10] upon the earth. But the revelation of
[1:19:13] who Jesus is has been restored in this
[1:19:16] generation and it's abiding in every one
[1:19:19] of your homes. What would happen? The
[1:19:21] Bible would tell us that Zakius would
[1:19:24] make all of his wrongs right. Oh, it
[1:19:27] would start to change him. It would
[1:19:29] start to change him. Right? It's no
[1:19:31] longer just potentials. Now it's a
[1:19:33] revelation. Amen. But the Bible says
[1:19:35] that he would give back to the ones he
[1:19:37] done wrong. What was it? The revelation
[1:19:39] of Jesus would start to change him. And
[1:19:42] I believe that's what this message is
[1:19:44] doing. It's changing us. Changing us day
[1:19:47] by day from glory unto glory that one
[1:19:50] day we're going to behold him and we're
[1:19:52] going to look just like him. Hallelujah.
[1:19:54] It's changing us. You see, it's our
[1:19:57] expectation. You see, our expectation is
[1:20:00] from the heavenlies. And and I know I'm
[1:20:03] going a little bit slow this morning,
[1:20:04] but our expectation is from the
[1:20:06] heavenlies. Our expectation ain't from a
[1:20:09] man. As much as we love our pastor, our
[1:20:12] expectation ain't no good he can preach.
[1:20:15] Right? Our expectation is what he's
[1:20:17] bringing to us. Amen. Oh, come on now.
[1:20:20] Your expectation ain't in my gift. Your
[1:20:23] expectation is in the message of the
[1:20:25] hour. And brother Brandon would tell us,
[1:20:27] I'm going to use a subject of
[1:20:30] expectation. He says expectations is
[1:20:33] usually based upon a faith. You have to
[1:20:36] have faith before you can expect
[1:20:38] anything. Oh my. So before you can
[1:20:41] expect anything, you have to have faith.
[1:20:44] And brother Brandon, I'm going to
[1:20:45] continue on. Excuse me. And I've often
[1:20:48] quoted this that God is obligated to his
[1:20:51] word. And I like to read just a word or
[1:20:53] two of it because what I say will fail
[1:20:56] because I'm a man. But his word cannot
[1:20:59] fail because it is God. God, if God is
[1:21:02] ever called on the scene at any time to
[1:21:05] make a decision and the first decision
[1:21:08] that God makes has to be the same
[1:21:11] decision every time. Now, that's where
[1:21:14] you solemnly base your faith on thus
[1:21:17] saith the Lord. You must believe it that
[1:21:20] it's God's word and that's the only hope
[1:21:23] we have. He says it's on the word of
[1:21:26] God. Now, God is being infinite and
[1:21:28] cannot make a mistake. He's perfect.
[1:21:31] Therefore, all of his promises must be
[1:21:34] perfect as he is perfect. Amen. My And
[1:21:39] so, we're not just believing in
[1:21:40] imaginary God. We're believing in an
[1:21:43] infinite God that cannot change. He
[1:21:45] can't change in his ways, in his
[1:21:47] essence, in his actions, in his word.
[1:21:50] So, if his word promised us, that's the
[1:21:52] final say. Oh my. That's why the Bible
[1:21:55] would say uh or the promises are yay and
[1:21:58] amen, right? In him is the yay and the
[1:22:01] amen. The word amen stands for finality,
[1:22:04] right? It stands for the final say. And
[1:22:07] so the promises of God or the final say.
[1:22:10] No matter the condition that's in your
[1:22:12] body, no matter the doubt and the
[1:22:14] unbelief that comes against your mind,
[1:22:16] comes against your spirit man, the final
[1:22:18] say is the promises of God. And that's
[1:22:22] where our expectation is. The Bible
[1:22:24] would tell us in Hebrews 11:6, "But
[1:22:27] without faith, it is impossible to
[1:22:30] please him. For he that cometh to God
[1:22:32] must believe that he is that he is a
[1:22:35] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:22:39] him." So before we can seek him, we got
[1:22:42] to know there's a reward for us. Yes.
[1:22:44] You know, how many's ever tried potty
[1:22:45] training their kid?
[1:22:48] Only a few of you. I'm telling you what,
[1:22:50] whenever I started potty training my
[1:22:52] little boy Ethan, he he's three now, you
[1:22:54] know, and it was the hardest thing to
[1:22:56] get him potty trained. But you know what
[1:22:58] we had to do? And man, we had to bribe
[1:23:00] him. We had to tell him if he poops in
[1:23:02] the toilet, you'll get a piece of candy,
[1:23:05] right? And it worked. But then all of a
[1:23:07] sudden, he had to poop all the time,
[1:23:10] even when he didn't have to poop. But he
[1:23:12] knew there's a reward for me. Amen. He
[1:23:15] knew if I go and I sit on the toilet,
[1:23:18] there's a reward for me. And that's the
[1:23:20] way it is with the bride of Christ.
[1:23:22] We're not just seeking God. We know
[1:23:24] there's a reward for us. There's
[1:23:26] something that we can obtain. There's
[1:23:28] something we can achieve. There's
[1:23:30] there's something that we can grab a
[1:23:32] hold of. Amen. The promises of God ain't
[1:23:34] just potentials. They're realizations,
[1:23:37] the revelations to us. And and brother
[1:23:40] Brown, I'm going to talk about talk
[1:23:42] about Abraham. And I think it is so
[1:23:44] powerful. He would say that when he
[1:23:46] would go to the doctor and say, "We're
[1:23:48] going to have a baby." And then the
[1:23:50] doctor would look at him and say, "Man,
[1:23:51] you're crazy." But he says it was his
[1:23:54] expectation wasn't upon the doctor's
[1:23:56] word, but upon God's word. And then he
[1:23:59] would bring it down to you. And he would
[1:24:01] say, "It's not what do people think." He
[1:24:03] says, "What do you think? It's not what
[1:24:06] it's not you growing up the people and
[1:24:08] saying, "You think I can get my healing?
[1:24:10] You think I can get this? You think I
[1:24:12] can get that?" Brother Brandham says
[1:24:14] that has nothing to do with it. It's not
[1:24:16] what faith, it's what do you think. Oh,
[1:24:20] come on now. It's not what does
[1:24:21] everybody else think. Can you have a can
[1:24:24] you make a rapture? It's what do you
[1:24:26] think? You see, because the Bible the
[1:24:29] Bible would tell us that that it's faith
[1:24:31] that pleases God. So, it's it's not what
[1:24:33] I can do. It's not how good I can live,
[1:24:35] how good I can be, how many messages I
[1:24:38] can listen to. That's not that's not
[1:24:40] what it ain't actions, right? That was
[1:24:43] why Luther Luther came out. The just
[1:24:45] shall live by faith, right? It's not
[1:24:48] stuff I can do. It's my faith that can
[1:24:51] be built up. Right. Cuz if you listen
[1:24:53] out of if you listen to the messages out
[1:24:55] of duty, it's never going to build
[1:24:57] faith. Right. Right. But if you're
[1:25:00] listening to the message out of
[1:25:01] sincerity, that builds up a faith. And
[1:25:04] you remember whenever the whenever the
[1:25:06] the the the the the man would come to
[1:25:08] Jesus in the Bible and this little boy,
[1:25:10] his kid was possessed with the spirit,
[1:25:13] right? Right. And the Bible says that
[1:25:15] this man, this boy, the spirit would
[1:25:18] throw him into the fire, throw him into
[1:25:20] the water, would would throw rip his
[1:25:22] clothes off, would throw him here and
[1:25:24] there. And the Bible says that this
[1:25:26] father would come up to Jesus and would
[1:25:29] say in Mark 9:22 and often times they
[1:25:32] cast him into the fire and into the
[1:25:34] waters to destroy him. But if thou canst
[1:25:37] do anything, have compassion and help
[1:25:40] us. And Jesus said unto him, "If thou
[1:25:44] can't believe, all things are possible
[1:25:47] to him that believeth." So Jesus didn't
[1:25:50] look at him and said, "You got to follow
[1:25:51] my ministry for a year. You got to go
[1:25:54] back and you got to listen to the sermon
[1:25:55] on the mount. You got to do this. You
[1:25:57] you got to you got to give to the poor.
[1:26:00] No, he didn't say your actions is going
[1:26:02] to bring the these potentials. He says
[1:26:05] you believing amen. You believing is
[1:26:08] going to bring these potentials. And
[1:26:10] look at the sincerity of this man. This
[1:26:13] man would stop and would see, I believe,
[1:26:16] but help my unbelief. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:26:19] And I know that's our desire. Lord, I
[1:26:21] believe, but sometimes I get weak.
[1:26:23] Sometimes I get weary. Sometimes the
[1:26:26] circumstances, the darkness just battles
[1:26:29] me and presses against me. Lord, I
[1:26:31] believe, but help my unbelief.
[1:26:34] Lord, I have not lost my faith, but I'm
[1:26:37] discouraged. I have not lost my faith,
[1:26:39] but I'm weary in mind. I'm weary in
[1:26:41] body. That don't do away with you. Come
[1:26:44] on now. This man says, "I believe, but
[1:26:47] yet there's some doubt that is pressed
[1:26:49] in against me. Help my unbelief." Amen.
[1:26:52] Sometimes we get to that point, we get
[1:26:54] weary. We get tired, but it's okay. Just
[1:26:58] cry out to God, Lord, I believe. But
[1:27:00] help my unbelief. Amen. And what I love
[1:27:03] about the story is the Bible's telling
[1:27:06] us here that this man comes to Jesus and
[1:27:09] says, "If you can do anything, just have
[1:27:12] compassion on me. just have compassion.
[1:27:14] And brother Brandham would tell us, you
[1:27:16] remember whenever Jesus would would
[1:27:18] would go out to the pull of Bethesda,
[1:27:20] right? And brother Brandham says that
[1:27:22] that that Jesus walked by the lame,
[1:27:24] walked by the the the halt and the and
[1:27:26] the blind and the deaf and the crippled.
[1:27:29] He walked by all of these individuals
[1:27:31] and would go to a man that was only
[1:27:34] tired. You remember that, brother Brown
[1:27:36] would say that this man could walk, he
[1:27:38] could talk, he could get around, but he
[1:27:40] was just weary. He says he was weary and
[1:27:43] he said brother Brand or Jesus would
[1:27:45] come up to this man and would raise him
[1:27:47] would would would say pick up your bed
[1:27:49] and walk. Brother Brandham says you
[1:27:50] would think Jesus full of compassion
[1:27:53] would go to everybody else too. You
[1:27:55] remember brother Brandham saying that
[1:27:57] brother Brandham says many people
[1:27:58] mistake compassion for human sympathy.
[1:28:02] He says human compassion is different
[1:28:04] from God's compassion. He says what was
[1:28:07] the compassion of Jesus to do the will
[1:28:09] of the father. Amen. So here would come
[1:28:12] Jesus. Here would come this man to Jesus
[1:28:14] saying, "Have compassion on me. Give me
[1:28:16] human sympathy." Oh, hallelujah. Give me
[1:28:20] some sympathy. Just make me feel better.
[1:28:22] But Jesus wasn't going to give him
[1:28:24] sympathy. He was going to give him the
[1:28:26] will of the father, which was for that
[1:28:28] boy to be delivered. Come on now. We
[1:28:30] have not got God's sympathy in this
[1:28:33] generation. We got an open book. Wake up
[1:28:36] the will of the father that says if you
[1:28:38] can believe all things are possible. If
[1:28:41] you can only believe all of heaven is
[1:28:44] backing you up. Oh, I believe that the
[1:28:46] witness of heaven has been opened up and
[1:28:49] the blessings of God can shower down
[1:28:51] upon a congregation. Can shower down
[1:28:53] upon a a household if you can only
[1:28:56] believe. We have not got sympathy. We
[1:28:59] have gotten the will of the father. Oh,
[1:29:01] I just love that. Give me give me some
[1:29:03] sympathy. And Jesus says, "If you can
[1:29:05] only believe, all things are possible."
[1:29:08] If you can only believe. And brother
[1:29:10] Brandon tell us that the hardest thing
[1:29:13] to do is to get the people in an
[1:29:16] atmosphere of believing. Cuz how come
[1:29:19] that's a hard thing to do? Cuz once you
[1:29:21] get in an atmosphere of believing, then
[1:29:23] all the potentials of heaven are for you
[1:29:25] to grab a hold of. So that's why the
[1:29:27] devil fights you so hard is to get in
[1:29:30] that atmosphere of believing. You
[1:29:32] remember that the the the when brother
[1:29:34] Brown was preaching I believe in Mexico
[1:29:36] I believe or or maybe in Arizona and
[1:29:38] there was a a young lady that her baby
[1:29:41] had died right and she was trying to get
[1:29:44] to brother Brandham trying to get to
[1:29:45] brother Brandham and brother Brandham he
[1:29:47] would stop everybody and would say does
[1:29:49] she have a prayer card they say no she
[1:29:51] don't got a prayer card and brother
[1:29:52] Brandham would would look to Jack Moore
[1:29:54] and would say you go pray for her she
[1:29:56] don't know the difference right now
[1:29:58] remember that you go pray for her she
[1:30:00] won't know the difference and as brother
[1:30:01] Jack was going making his way to go pray
[1:30:04] for her. There'd be a vision, right? The
[1:30:06] brother Brandham would see a vision and
[1:30:08] it was a baby that was dead. And as he
[1:30:10] would pray for that baby, it would come
[1:30:13] back to life. Oh my. Then what would
[1:30:14] brother Brandham say? He would say,
[1:30:16] "Stop. Bring that baby to me." And
[1:30:18] brother Brandham says, "There wasn't 300
[1:30:20] ushers that could keep that girl from
[1:30:23] getting to that platform." What was it?
[1:30:26] There was a vision. Amen. Amen. There
[1:30:28] was a vision that was spoke over her
[1:30:30] baby's life. All she had to do was be
[1:30:33] perseverant.
[1:30:35] Oh, you may say, "What are you talking
[1:30:36] about, brother Josh?" There's no vision
[1:30:38] being looked over me. Sometimes we think
[1:30:40] that I wish I was in brother Brandham's
[1:30:42] meeting so that I can get into the
[1:30:44] prayer line. He can look over my life
[1:30:45] and and pronounce me healed, pronounced
[1:30:47] me delivered. How many has ever thought
[1:30:49] that before? If I could only be with
[1:30:51] Jesus and he can discern me, you know,
[1:30:53] but that you see the word is the
[1:30:55] discerning, right? What would Hebrews
[1:30:57] tell us? That the word is powerful,
[1:30:59] quick, strong, and what is it? It's a
[1:31:01] discerner. It's the word that can
[1:31:03] discern. And we're thankful for brother
[1:31:05] Brandham. He was a prophet, but the word
[1:31:07] can still discern.
[1:31:10] Come on now. We don't got a prophet
[1:31:11] today, but we still got the word. That's
[1:31:14] what happens whenever you're sitting in
[1:31:16] a service like this morning and the
[1:31:18] word's coming across and something
[1:31:20] strikes that heart and you say, "That's
[1:31:22] for me." What is the word that is
[1:31:24] discerning? Amen. Oh, hallelujah. You
[1:31:27] see, I just a quick testimony. I was I
[1:31:30] was preaching in North Carolina a few
[1:31:33] months ago and and I I was preaching on
[1:31:35] heaviness and and I read a quote that
[1:31:38] brother Brandon was in a prayer line and
[1:31:40] he was he would speak to this lady and
[1:31:42] was say, "You've got two two shadows
[1:31:44] over you." And he says, "It's heaviness
[1:31:46] that is over you and it's because you
[1:31:48] wanted a baby." And he says, "You've had
[1:31:50] two miscarriages. He's discerning her
[1:31:52] life." and and would say he had two
[1:31:54] miscarriages and this this heaviness has
[1:31:58] come over you because of these
[1:32:00] miscarriages. You know, brother Brown,
[1:32:01] he he would he would talk to her and he
[1:32:03] would pronounce her delivered and and
[1:32:05] and we had a prayer line after that
[1:32:07] service after that that service. And in
[1:32:09] that prayer line, there would come up a
[1:32:12] lady that would say, "Brother Josh, I've
[1:32:14] had heaviness for a long time, and I
[1:32:16] didn't realize what it was. And whenever
[1:32:18] you was reading that quote, that's me. I
[1:32:21] had a miscarriage and that's where my
[1:32:23] heaviness came from. You see, I'm not a
[1:32:26] prophet, but there's a word that I can
[1:32:29] quote, that I can preach. And that same
[1:32:32] word that we discerned back in the 60s,
[1:32:35] we begin to discern that girl's life and
[1:32:37] she could be delivered. Oh, that's what
[1:32:40] we do when we preach the message of the
[1:32:43] hour. Preach this word. It's a
[1:32:45] discernment over your life that you can
[1:32:47] say, "That's for me. That's what I need
[1:32:49] to be healed. That's what I need to be
[1:32:51] encouraged. That's what I need to be be
[1:32:54] delivered and filled with the Holy
[1:32:56] Ghost. Amen. The word is still a
[1:32:58] discerner. Oh, hallelujah. The word or
[1:33:01] my sister-in-law there in Ohio and uh
[1:33:04] she she she had a she had a condition in
[1:33:07] her body because of of having one of her
[1:33:09] children, I believe, and she was
[1:33:11] listening to a message. And brother
[1:33:13] Brown, he he's in a prayer line and he
[1:33:15] stops and he calls out a condition and
[1:33:18] he says, "You're made well of that.
[1:33:19] You're healed of it." And that was the
[1:33:21] same condition that my sister-in-law was
[1:33:24] struggling with. You know what she would
[1:33:25] do right there? She would say, "That's
[1:33:27] for me." And right there, God would heal
[1:33:30] her body. So the same word that
[1:33:32] discerned in that prayer line is still
[1:33:35] discerning today. Amen. Oh, that's what
[1:33:38] this message is all about. To bring out
[1:33:40] the potentials in you.
[1:33:43] Hallelujah. To bring out the potentials.
[1:33:46] You see, it's not a church. It's not
[1:33:50] just some church that has the authority
[1:33:51] of the word of God. The word of God can
[1:33:54] bring forth the same results anywhere
[1:33:56] you put it. Brother Brandham, I talked
[1:33:58] about the acorn tree. I I mentioned a
[1:34:00] few a few things about it earlier.
[1:34:02] Brother Brandham says if you want a
[1:34:03] tree, he says you can plant that seed in
[1:34:06] the south just like you can't in the
[1:34:08] north. And he says it'll bring forth the
[1:34:10] same results. So it don't matter if it's
[1:34:13] in the north or in the south. If it's
[1:34:15] the same seed, it'll bring forth the
[1:34:18] same results. Cuz sometimes we think,
[1:34:20] man, if I was only in that one's church,
[1:34:22] if I was only over here or maybe in this
[1:34:24] one's church, I can see the power of
[1:34:26] God. No, it's not a church that dictates
[1:34:28] it. It's your faith. Oh, no. that your
[1:34:31] faith in the word of God that plants
[1:34:33] that seed in your life and then your
[1:34:37] expectations bring forth the same
[1:34:39] results.
[1:34:41] Hallelujah. You say because sometimes we
[1:34:44] we we get offended at God and and our
[1:34:47] ground is not fertile like it should be
[1:34:49] because the Bible would tell us that the
[1:34:51] were a field right whether Brandon or
[1:34:54] Jesus would talk about the parable of
[1:34:55] sewer and would say a man would go and
[1:34:57] he would plant the seed some fell by the
[1:35:00] wayside. Some fell on stony ground. Some
[1:35:02] fell over here. Some fell over there.
[1:35:04] And as it started to grow up, this year
[1:35:06] choked it out. This had no roots over
[1:35:08] here because the the the the ground was
[1:35:10] stony. And then Jesus would would come
[1:35:13] down to one point. And and I think this
[1:35:15] is incredible in Matthew 13 and 20. But
[1:35:18] he that received this received the seed
[1:35:21] in the stony places. The same is he that
[1:35:24] heareth the word and and and and anod
[1:35:28] with joy received it. Yet he not he hath
[1:35:31] no root in himself but endureth for a
[1:35:33] while. For when tribulation or
[1:35:35] persecution ariseth because of the word
[1:35:39] he is offended. My you see sometimes we
[1:35:43] get to that place that our our our
[1:35:45] ground is fertile and the word of God
[1:35:48] falls in it but we get offended at the
[1:35:50] word because of things we're going
[1:35:51] through. Amen. How many's ever been
[1:35:53] there? Brother Brandon would talk about
[1:35:54] the John the Baptist and would say that
[1:35:57] there's many people there's more people
[1:35:59] offended at Jesus than any other man
[1:36:01] that's ever been alive. He says
[1:36:03] everybody gets offended at Jesus. And it
[1:36:05] was John the Baptist that would say that
[1:36:07] would send his disciples to Jesus and
[1:36:10] would say are you the one or we to look
[1:36:12] after another. What was it? John the
[1:36:14] Baptist he he become offended at Jesus
[1:36:18] because here he was standing for the
[1:36:20] word's sake. Standing saying the Messiah
[1:36:22] is here. Behold the lamb of God that
[1:36:24] taketh away the sin of the world. And
[1:36:26] now he's in prison. And what would
[1:36:29] happen? Now he's starting to doubt. Oh
[1:36:31] my church, don't get to this place. He's
[1:36:34] starting to doubt that Jesus is Jesus is
[1:36:37] now the Messiah. He's doubting that
[1:36:39] thing. How come? Because of his offense.
[1:36:42] Oh, hallelujah. But how would Jesus deal
[1:36:45] with this offense? And I love it because
[1:36:48] here he sends his disciples to Jesus.
[1:36:50] And what would Jesus turn around and
[1:36:52] tell the disciples? Brother Brandon, I
[1:36:54] love it. Brother Brandon, I'm going to
[1:36:55] put it. He didn't send the disciples
[1:36:57] back with with literature on how to be
[1:36:59] good in prison. He didn't tell go tell
[1:37:02] John to act this way and to straighten
[1:37:04] up. Of course, I'm the Messiah. But what
[1:37:06] would Jesus tell the disciples? Go tell
[1:37:09] John what you do see, what you do hear.
[1:37:12] The blind receive their sight. The deaf
[1:37:15] are hearing that the poor have the
[1:37:17] gospel minister to them. In other words,
[1:37:20] the same word before the offense is the
[1:37:24] same word after the offense. Hallelujah.
[1:37:27] The offense never changes God. Oh, come
[1:37:31] on now. Your offense towards the word
[1:37:33] never changes the word. Changes your
[1:37:36] expectation.
[1:37:38] Oh, but Jesus, what would Jesus do? He
[1:37:40] would turn around and say, "What come
[1:37:42] you to see?" Right? He would start to
[1:37:44] speak of John. And what I love about it
[1:37:46] is even though John was looking at Jesus
[1:37:49] a different way, now Jesus never seen
[1:37:52] John differently. He would say John's a
[1:37:56] prophet. There's never been a man
[1:37:57] greater than John. So even though uh
[1:38:00] John was offended at Jesus and begin to
[1:38:03] look at him different, it did not change
[1:38:05] the way God seen John. Oh, and sometimes
[1:38:08] we get offended and we get we get doubt
[1:38:11] and and we get discouraged and we look
[1:38:13] at the word differently. But that does
[1:38:15] not change the way the word sees you.
[1:38:18] Come on now. You might be offended,
[1:38:20] saying, "God's forsaken me. God's left
[1:38:22] me. God's not hearing my prayer." But
[1:38:24] the word still sees you. Hallelujah.
[1:38:27] God's still looking at you as the bride
[1:38:29] of Christ. And the potentials are still
[1:38:33] laying there. Amen. Oh my. The word has
[1:38:36] not changed, but our offense can change
[1:38:40] our expectations sometimes. Oh my. Her
[1:38:43] offense can change your expectation and
[1:38:46] it's so incredible because it was strong
[1:38:48] at the Jordan River that would say
[1:38:51] behold the lamb of God right that taketh
[1:38:53] away the sin of the world. He was there
[1:38:55] when the pillar of fire you know when
[1:38:57] the dove would come upon him and would
[1:38:59] say behold my my behold my son in whom
[1:39:02] I'm well pleased to dwell. John was
[1:39:04] there all of that time but because of
[1:39:07] the hardships. Oh how many's ever been
[1:39:10] there before? I've been there where I
[1:39:13] know this message is true. I know God's
[1:39:16] alive, but because of hardships, because
[1:39:19] of circumstances, because of the
[1:39:21] darkness that is pressing against me,
[1:39:24] pressing against my mind, pressing
[1:39:26] against my family. But sometimes you
[1:39:28] just get discouraged and you say, "God,
[1:39:30] have you changed? Have your word
[1:39:32] concerning me changed?
[1:39:35] Have you forgot about me? Am I really
[1:39:37] not your bride? Have I done something
[1:39:40] wrong?" And your Jesus is saying he's
[1:39:43] still a prophet, right? What have you
[1:39:45] come out to see? A reed shaken in the
[1:39:47] wind, right? He was starting to speak to
[1:39:50] them that John is still the same in my
[1:39:53] sight. And let me say this, that you're
[1:39:55] still the same in God's sight. No matter
[1:39:58] what you go through, no matter the
[1:40:00] discouragements, no matter the
[1:40:02] conditions, just be seated in heavenly
[1:40:04] places and be led by that spirit.
[1:40:07] Because brother Brown, he he would
[1:40:09] preach and he would he would use uh John
[1:40:11] or Simeon in many different places and
[1:40:13] and I'll bring this down to a close here
[1:40:15] in a few minutes. He would use Simeon in
[1:40:18] many messages expectation led of the
[1:40:20] spirit being led by God. He would use
[1:40:22] him in many places. And I love it
[1:40:25] because here John the the Bible says
[1:40:27] that the Holy Ghost would would reveal
[1:40:29] to Simeon that he was to see the Lord's
[1:40:32] Christ. Right? So it wasn't Simeon just
[1:40:34] coming up with us in his own own accord,
[1:40:36] but it was the Holy Ghost and then the
[1:40:39] Holy Ghost would lead him. My go then
[1:40:42] John the Bible uh Simeon sorry Simeon
[1:40:45] was sitting there. Brother Brandham
[1:40:46] would say that the spirit of the Lord
[1:40:48] would then speak to Simeon and would say
[1:40:51] get up and start walking. He would say
[1:40:53] where am I walking to? He says it don't
[1:40:55] matter just keep walking. And what is
[1:40:58] incredible brother Brandon I'm going to
[1:40:59] make a statement. He would say that
[1:41:01] Simeon had a right to expect it because
[1:41:05] it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost
[1:41:07] and he God had a reason to reveal it.
[1:41:11] Amen. So once God would reveal to Simeon
[1:41:14] that he was to see the Lord's Christ, he
[1:41:17] then had a right to expect it. Amen.
[1:41:19] Come on now. And if the promises of God
[1:41:21] are revealed to you, you've got a right
[1:41:24] to expect it. Amen. But all we got to do
[1:41:27] is be led by the spirit of God. And and
[1:41:29] here by brother Brandham, he he would
[1:41:31] talk about Simeon and how he was being
[1:41:33] led by God, being led by the spirit of
[1:41:35] God. And that would lead him straight to
[1:41:37] the promised child. And the Bible would
[1:41:39] tell us that the sons of God are led by
[1:41:41] the spirit of God. Brother Brandham, I'm
[1:41:43] going to talk about John. I'm going say
[1:41:45] when John in Revelations, he would say,
[1:41:47] I was in the spirit on the Lord's day.
[1:41:50] Brother Brandham says he got into the
[1:41:51] spirit and was transported into the
[1:41:54] Lord's day. And what would John say? And
[1:41:56] I heard a voice behind me saying, "I'm
[1:41:58] Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
[1:42:01] ending." What was it? Once John got into
[1:42:04] the spirit, got into the right
[1:42:06] atmosphere, he then was transported to
[1:42:09] the Lord's day that he then would come
[1:42:12] back with the testimony. He's the alpha,
[1:42:15] am the omega, the beginning, and the
[1:42:18] end. You see, that's what happens when
[1:42:20] you get into the right atmosphere. You
[1:42:22] get transported into the realities of
[1:42:26] the almighty God. And you come back with
[1:42:28] the testimony. He's Jesus Christ the
[1:42:31] same yesterday, today, and forever. He's
[1:42:34] the alpha and the omega, the beginning,
[1:42:37] and the ending. It was John getting in
[1:42:40] the spirit and then the revelations.
[1:42:42] Brother Brandham says that's how all
[1:42:44] those revelations would come to John was
[1:42:46] him getting into the spirit. And then he
[1:42:48] says, "Now, in order for us to receive
[1:42:50] those revelations, we got to get into
[1:42:53] the spirit." That's right. Oh, what is
[1:42:55] it? We're getting into the right
[1:42:56] atmosphere. And the same things that
[1:42:59] John saw, we begin to see. He's the
[1:43:02] alpha, the omega. Brother Brandon was
[1:43:04] saying, whenever you get into the
[1:43:06] spirit, you'll go to seeing things. When
[1:43:09] you get into the spirit, oh my. When you
[1:43:12] get into the spirit, you'll go to you
[1:43:14] you'll start seeing things. It's it's
[1:43:16] not you hallucinating, but it's you
[1:43:18] looking into the realities of God and
[1:43:20] seeing that the promises are yay and
[1:43:23] amen. He's the alpha and he's the omega.
[1:43:27] Hallelujah. You go to seeing those
[1:43:29] things. Not just the prophet seeing
[1:43:31] them. But Brandon says you'll start
[1:43:33] seeing them. You'll start seeing the
[1:43:35] potentials are for me. You remember the
[1:43:37] story of the aunt
[1:43:39] Jamael and and I was listening to it
[1:43:41] this morning. And brother Brandham says
[1:43:43] he was coming from Dallas, I believe.
[1:43:45] And he says there was a storm that would
[1:43:47] ground his plane there in Memphis,
[1:43:49] right? And little did brother Brandham
[1:43:51] know that the reason his his plane was
[1:43:54] grounded was because there was a woman
[1:43:56] that was praying. And what I love about
[1:43:58] the story is brother Brandham was saved
[1:44:01] this boy, we all know the story, this
[1:44:03] boy had a had a sickness and and it was
[1:44:06] from him sinning. I believe a public
[1:44:08] disease I think brother Brandham would
[1:44:10] put it I think. And it wasn't he, this
[1:44:12] boy was not sick because he was a good
[1:44:14] boy. He was sick because he was a
[1:44:16] sinner. He was out doing things he
[1:44:17] shouldn't be doing. And still the
[1:44:19] promises of God was so real to this
[1:44:22] woman that she would believe even when
[1:44:24] her s her son was a sinner. Oh my.
[1:44:27] That's what we need some more of as
[1:44:29] parents. That the promises of God does
[1:44:31] not change. No matter the condition of
[1:44:34] my loved ones, no matter the condition
[1:44:36] of my body, no matter the condition of
[1:44:38] my mind, the promises of God are still
[1:44:41] true. Oh my. She would begin to pray.
[1:44:45] And I think it's incredible because here
[1:44:47] the plane would get grounded and brother
[1:44:49] Brandon would get up the next morning.
[1:44:50] He had some mail he was going to go put
[1:44:52] at the post office, right? And he was
[1:44:54] walking and the spirit of the Lord says,
[1:44:56] "Keep on walking. Keep on walking."
[1:44:59] Right? And he would then go and he he
[1:45:01] would go into the post office. He would
[1:45:02] go into a restaurant, I believe. And the
[1:45:04] spirit of the Lord would say, "Turn
[1:45:05] around and go that way, right?" And he
[1:45:08] was walking and he would say, "Lord, is
[1:45:09] that you telling me this? Is that you?"
[1:45:11] And he was walking. And then there was a
[1:45:13] woman, right? Brother says, "The answer
[1:45:15] would say, "Morning Parson." Brother
[1:45:18] Brandon would stop and would say, "How
[1:45:19] you doing, auntie? How did you know I
[1:45:21] was a parson?" And she would say, "Well,
[1:45:24] you see, I'm a Shunomite woman." And he
[1:45:27] says, "You're my Elijah." Amen. And what
[1:45:29] is incredible is the reason brother
[1:45:31] Brandham is being led
[1:45:34] is being led to her doorstep was because
[1:45:37] she got into the spirit and begin to see
[1:45:40] things right cuz brother Brandham says a
[1:45:43] at 3:00 that morning the previous
[1:45:45] morning while brother Brandham was
[1:45:47] laying in bed she was she was
[1:45:49] interceding she was praying and she was
[1:45:52] telling Mr. Brother Brandon and we see I
[1:45:55] was praying at 3:00 this morning and I
[1:45:57] fell asleep and I had a dream that
[1:46:00] you're my Elijah and you was when you
[1:46:02] came by my way. So as she was praying,
[1:46:06] as she got into the spirit, she then
[1:46:08] would begin to see things. She would see
[1:46:11] her Elijah coming by her way. So when
[1:46:15] brother Brandham got up that morning and
[1:46:17] was being led, it was her answer coming
[1:46:20] to her doorstep. Amen. Hallelujah. And
[1:46:23] that's what a preacher does when he gets
[1:46:25] up and preaches and you're in the spirit
[1:46:28] and God reveals to you that you can have
[1:46:30] a certain thing. The preacher gets up
[1:46:32] and starts to preach. It's your answer
[1:46:35] coming to your doorstep. Amen. It's your
[1:46:39] breakthrough coming to your family. It's
[1:46:42] the deliverance coming to your marriage,
[1:46:44] coming to your children, coming to the
[1:46:46] church. It's because you're led to
[1:46:48] believe it. Amen. You're got into the
[1:46:51] spirit. It's not you just saying, "God,
[1:46:53] I want this. I want that." No, you got
[1:46:55] into the spirit and then he gave you an
[1:46:58] expectation that you've got a right to
[1:47:00] expect it. Hallelujah. And what would
[1:47:03] happen? And brother Brandon would say,
[1:47:05] "Well, you got, you know, he he she
[1:47:07] would tell him what's going on." And he
[1:47:09] would say, "Well, I pray for the sick.
[1:47:11] You want me to come and pray for him?"
[1:47:12] She said, "I don't know about that. All
[1:47:14] I know is you're my Elijah." She she did
[1:47:17] not care that he prayed for the sick.
[1:47:20] God did not show her that. But he did
[1:47:23] show her that that was her Elijah. And
[1:47:26] as he would go into the home, brother
[1:47:27] Brandham says he had been in king's
[1:47:29] palaces, right? He had been in mansions
[1:47:32] and never felt more at home than that
[1:47:34] little hut. He says he would walk in and
[1:47:37] would see a see a sign that says, "God
[1:47:39] bless this home." Right? And brother
[1:47:41] Brandon says she would begin to pray.
[1:47:43] She would lay her hands on that boy and
[1:47:45] would begin to pray. And he says that he
[1:47:48] knew that she had prayed before. He knew
[1:47:51] she prayed before. He says she would
[1:47:53] wipe the tears and say, "Okay, Parson,
[1:47:55] now it's your turn." And why would
[1:47:57] Brother Brandon pray? Brother Brham
[1:48:00] would pray this. Uh, let me find a
[1:48:02] quote. He would say, and I said, "I will
[1:48:04] pray now, Anthony. I'll put my hands
[1:48:06] over on his feet." I said, "Lord, I
[1:48:09] don't know what to say. Is this why you
[1:48:11] made me miss my plane?" to come down
[1:48:14] here to pray for this woman's boy. If it
[1:48:16] is, oh Lord, let it be known that your
[1:48:20] God and you respect her prayers and her
[1:48:24] sincerity.
[1:48:26] Ain't that incredible that it ain't
[1:48:28] brother Brandon praying over the boy,
[1:48:30] he's saying you respect her prayers. You
[1:48:33] respect her sincerity. How come she was
[1:48:37] led to believe it? Oh, little church,
[1:48:40] we're led to believe these things. How
[1:48:42] come you believe for a rapture? You're
[1:48:45] led to believe it. How come you believe
[1:48:48] that your lost loved ones can come home?
[1:48:50] Because you're led to believe it. You've
[1:48:52] got the sincerity.
[1:48:54] And as you pray, the gates of heaven
[1:48:56] will be open up. Why? That you can see
[1:48:58] it. Well, that's my promise. That's for
[1:49:01] me. You remember the story of the little
[1:49:03] girl that that was blind from Memphis.
[1:49:06] And brother Brown says that and it's and
[1:49:08] it's incredible a period of time there
[1:49:10] because brother Brown he would go into
[1:49:11] the ambulance, right, and would pray for
[1:49:13] that woman that was dead. God would
[1:49:14] raise her up and he was trying to get
[1:49:16] back into the into the sanctuary and as
[1:49:19] he would come out of that ambulance he
[1:49:21] was pushing, right? And he was pushing
[1:49:23] through everybody and he says he hit a
[1:49:25] man and the man says, "Hey, quit
[1:49:27] pushing." Y'all remember that? And
[1:49:28] brother Brandham says he pushed again.
[1:49:30] He was trying to get there and he and
[1:49:32] the man says, "I said stop pushing." And
[1:49:34] brother Brandham says he looked at the
[1:49:35] man. He was a big old man and he had a
[1:49:37] knife and he was whittling on something.
[1:49:39] And brother Brandham says, "Man, I
[1:49:41] stopped pushing." And he says, "Then I
[1:49:43] heard a little cry saying, "Daddy,
[1:49:45] daddy, daddy." I remember that. And it
[1:49:48] was a little girl. And brother Brandham
[1:49:49] would say, "Surely somebody's going to
[1:49:51] help that girl." And he says, "Well,
[1:49:53] maybe I can help her. Maybe the Lord
[1:49:55] will hear will heal her." He seemed that
[1:49:58] she was blind. And brother Brandham
[1:49:59] said, "I started to work my way to her."
[1:50:02] Oh, I love it. and and and you can look
[1:50:04] you can look it up. Brother Brandham
[1:50:06] says that she would start to come.
[1:50:08] Brother Brandham says he positioned
[1:50:10] himself that she would bump into him.
[1:50:13] Oh, hallelujah. And all the while this
[1:50:15] girl is saying, "Daddy, daddy." And
[1:50:17] everywhere she would go, brother Brandon
[1:50:19] would walk that way until she would bump
[1:50:21] into him and she would say, "Excuse me,
[1:50:23] sir." And he and she would say, "Can you
[1:50:25] help me find my daddy?" And brother
[1:50:27] Brandham would look at her and say,
[1:50:28] "Where are you from?" She was saying,
[1:50:29] "I'm from Memphis." Brother Brandham
[1:50:31] says, "I looked over and I seen the van,
[1:50:33] the buses that said Memphis, and he
[1:50:35] said, "I could have got her there easy,
[1:50:38] but I wanted God to heal her." Oh,
[1:50:40] hallelujah. So, Brother Brandham starts
[1:50:42] to talk to her, right? I know y'all know
[1:50:44] the story. And she and he would say,
[1:50:46] "What are you doing here?" She would
[1:50:47] say, "We're here to see the healer." And
[1:50:49] he she would say, "I heard on the radio
[1:50:52] that there was a blind man just like me
[1:50:54] that was healed." And he showed it by
[1:50:56] the scripture. But I thought, my
[1:50:58] goodness, that's her expectation. Not
[1:51:00] just that he could be that he was
[1:51:02] healed, but the scripture backed it up.
[1:51:04] So her expectation was a scriptural
[1:51:08] expectation. And brother Brandham says,
[1:51:10] "No, you don't believe that's true." She
[1:51:12] says, "Oh yes, I do. I believe it's
[1:51:14] true. Can you just help me find my
[1:51:16] daddy?" And he was saying, "We're living
[1:51:18] in a a day of technology. Don't you
[1:51:21] think the doctors can help you?" Brother
[1:51:23] Rand says, "I was testing her faith."
[1:51:25] Yeah. Don't you think the doctors can
[1:51:26] help you? And she says, "Sir, I've been
[1:51:28] to all the doctors. Nobody can help me.
[1:51:31] I've been to that doctor, this doctor,
[1:51:33] but if I can only get to the healer,
[1:51:35] brother Brandham says, you don't believe
[1:51:37] that." And she would say, "Let me tell
[1:51:39] you what, sir. You get me to the healer,
[1:51:42] I'll find my own daddy." Hallelujah.
[1:51:45] Brother Brandham says, "I'm not." And
[1:51:46] he, Brother Brandham, I say, "Suppose
[1:51:48] I'm the one you're looking for." Brother
[1:51:50] Brandham says she grabbed a hold of him
[1:51:52] and would not let him go. And he would
[1:51:55] say, "Honey, I'm not the healer, but I
[1:51:57] am brother Brandon. I preach that God
[1:52:00] can heal." And she would grab a hold of
[1:52:02] that coat. Brother Brandham says he she
[1:52:04] would not let him go. And he was trying
[1:52:06] to get her right hand, right? Trying to
[1:52:08] get a hold of her with her right with
[1:52:10] his right hand. And she could not get a
[1:52:12] hold of her cuz she was hanging on so
[1:52:13] tight. Amen. Well, the Brandham says,
[1:52:15] "Just let go of me, honey, so that I can
[1:52:17] grab a hold of your hand." She says, "Oh
[1:52:19] no, I am not letting you go." Brother
[1:52:21] Random says, "Okay, grab a hold of me
[1:52:23] with your right hand. I'll grab your
[1:52:25] left hand." She said, "Okay." She
[1:52:27] grabbed a hold of him. And she would
[1:52:29] even look at her and say, "Honey, if you
[1:52:31] believe it, I'm going to pray for you
[1:52:33] and close your eyes." And this is what
[1:52:35] is so incredible to me. He would say,
[1:52:37] "Close your eyes. And whenever you feel
[1:52:40] something rising up in your heart, open
[1:52:42] your eyes." You see, that was not all
[1:52:45] upon brother Brandon. It was a pulsation
[1:52:47] of faith for her. It seems she had
[1:52:50] something to do. She had to believe. And
[1:52:53] as he was praying for it, brother
[1:52:55] Brandham says she opened up her eyes and
[1:52:57] would say, "Is that the sun? Is that the
[1:52:59] trees? Is that this? What was it?" When
[1:53:02] she felt the pulsation of faith start to
[1:53:05] rise up, she would open her eyes and her
[1:53:08] expectation would become a reality. Oh
[1:53:12] my. That's what's going to happen one
[1:53:14] day. We're going to wake up for the last
[1:53:16] time, fight our last man, my mind mind
[1:53:18] battle, fight the last spirit, and then
[1:53:20] we're going to step into eternity. Our
[1:53:23] expectation is going to be made a
[1:53:25] reality. Amen. But it was brother
[1:53:28] Brandon that would would look at her and
[1:53:30] would would position himself for her to
[1:53:33] bump into him. And that's the way it is
[1:53:35] with God. Whenever you come to church,
[1:53:38] sometimes we we seem confused. Now, dear
[1:53:41] brother Brandon, I'm not I'm not doing
[1:53:42] that at all. But sometimes God
[1:53:44] positioned himself maybe behind a
[1:53:47] preacher. And when a preacher starts to
[1:53:49] preach, it's him bumping into you. The
[1:53:51] promises of God bumping into you. And
[1:53:54] it's the end. You're bumping into the
[1:53:56] healer. You're bumping into the
[1:53:57] encourager. You're bumping into your
[1:53:59] joy. You're bumping into your peace.
[1:54:02] Amen. And right there, God can give it
[1:54:04] to you. Let our musicians come tonight.
[1:54:07] Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Brandham would
[1:54:09] say and and believe ye that I am able to
[1:54:11] do this. And 50, brother Brandham say
[1:54:13] every which way she was going, I'll make
[1:54:16] myself get right in her way. And
[1:54:18] finally, she bumped into me and she
[1:54:20] said, "Excuse me, sir." He would
[1:54:23] position himself that she would bump
[1:54:25] into him. And I believe that God is
[1:54:28] leading us. And brother Brandham would
[1:54:30] would would talk about uh uh uh would
[1:54:32] talk about the blind Anna. And brother
[1:54:35] Brandham says no matter her condition
[1:54:37] that she was in, she was standing at the
[1:54:40] right place. And brother Brandham says
[1:54:42] that the Holy Ghost would lead her
[1:54:44] through the crowd would lead her by air.
[1:54:46] She would not she wouldn't bump into
[1:54:48] nobody, but that spirit of God would
[1:54:50] lead her all the way to the G to to the
[1:54:53] Christ, lead her to Jesus. And brother
[1:54:55] Brandham says that's the same spirit
[1:54:56] that is leading us. He would he would
[1:54:58] say, "And here she would come winding
[1:55:00] her way through there." And now if the
[1:55:02] Holy Spirit could wind that old blind
[1:55:04] woman around all those people to get to
[1:55:06] him, how much more can I wind you around
[1:55:09] these streets tonight? Oh, hallelujah.
[1:55:13] If the same spirit that raised up Christ
[1:55:16] from the dead dwelleth in you, it'll
[1:55:18] also quicken your mortal body. It's not
[1:55:20] a different spirit. It's not a different
[1:55:22] promise. It's the same spirit. And where
[1:55:25] the spirit of the Lord is, there is
[1:55:27] liberty. That's what we got in this
[1:55:29] generation. a quickening power, an
[1:55:31] anointed word, not just word, not just
[1:55:34] spirit, but an anointed word. The two
[1:55:37] coming together, the mechanics and the
[1:55:38] dynamics coming inside of a vessel,
[1:55:41] coming inside of a body. Amen. Let's bow
[1:55:44] our heads this morning.
[1:55:47] Dear gracious heavenly
[1:55:49] father, Lord, I know I took a little
[1:55:52] long this
[1:55:54] morning, but Lord, these what what was
[1:55:56] upon my heart.
[1:55:58] Lord, we're being
[1:56:00] led. Lord, I believe we're we've been
[1:56:03] seated into heavenly places and we're
[1:56:05] led to believe these things. The
[1:56:08] spiritual blessings of God are at our
[1:56:10] disposal if we can only believe. Lord, I
[1:56:14] believe it's more than just human
[1:56:16] sympathy. It's not your sympathy. And
[1:56:18] you I hope they're good enough. I hope
[1:56:21] they can do it. But Lord, you've given
[1:56:23] us your will, your word, saying we can
[1:56:26] be good enough. And maybe there's some
[1:56:28] here tonight that's like John the
[1:56:30] Baptist that is offended because of the
[1:56:33] hardships. Lord, may you strengthen
[1:56:35] them, Father. Strengthen their faith.
[1:56:37] Encourage their faith,
[1:56:39] Lord. Lord, may the weak say, "I am
[1:56:42] strong." Lord, and as we leave this
[1:56:45] place, may they say, "I bumped into you.
[1:56:48] I bumped into my encouragement. I bump
[1:56:51] into my my hope and my peace, my
[1:56:54] satisfaction. I bumped into you, Lord. I
[1:56:57] believe every time we come to church,
[1:56:59] every time we listen to a message,
[1:57:01] listen to a tape, Lord. It's you
[1:57:04] positioning yourself for us to bump into
[1:57:06] you. And Lord, may we keep
[1:57:09] walking, Lord. I know we get tired
[1:57:12] sometimes, but Lord, may we keep walking
[1:57:16] in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:57:20] This ain't time to give up and lay down
[1:57:22] on the feet. you know, this is the time
[1:57:24] to keep walking. And brother Brandon
[1:57:26] would talk about Simeon and would keep
[1:57:28] and the spirit of the Lord would keep
[1:57:29] telling him, "Keep on walking. Keep on
[1:57:32] walking." Then he would come to the end
[1:57:33] of that message and I'm going to say,
[1:57:35] "You in the wheelchair, you may say, how
[1:57:37] am I going to get out of this
[1:57:38] wheelchair?" He says, "I don't know.
[1:57:41] Just start walking." Amen. How am I
[1:57:43] going to get my healing? He says, "I
[1:57:45] don't know. Just start walking." Oh my.
[1:57:48] You may say, "How am I going to make a
[1:57:49] rapture?" I don't know. Just keep
[1:57:52] walking. Amen. This ain't time to lay
[1:57:53] down in the in offenses and
[1:57:55] discouragement and hardships and say,
[1:57:57] "God, why did you forsake me?" Just keep
[1:58:00] walking. Brother Brandham says he'll
[1:58:02] take care of the rest when you keep
[1:58:03] walking. Can we sing that song? Uh, it's
[1:58:06] amazing grace.
[1:58:07] Amen.
[1:58:12] Amazing
[1:58:14] grace,
[1:58:16] sweet the
[1:58:21] sound. A
[1:58:23] rich like
[1:58:26] me. I
[1:58:29] once was lost, but now we all stand this
[1:58:34] morning.
[1:58:36] was blind, but now life was
[1:58:42] [Music]
[1:58:50] grace. God bless you this morning. We
[1:58:52] turn it to our pastor.
[1:58:56] [Music]
[1:59:19] souls and
[1:59:22] I
[1:59:23] have
[1:59:25] already
[1:59:28] come. His grace have brought me
[1:59:36] safe and grace will lead me home.
[1:59:45] We been there
[1:59:49] 10,000
[1:59:50] years. When
[1:59:53] shineing as the
[1:59:57] sun, we know the days to sing God's
[2:00:04] praise.
[2:00:06] And when we first
[2:00:12] began, praise God. Praise God. Praise
[2:00:17] God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:00:24] Praise
[2:00:26] God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:00:33] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[2:00:38] Praise
[2:00:39] [Applause]
[2:00:41] God. Amen. It is no secret what God
[2:00:44] could do. If anyone wants special
[2:00:46] prayer, we just welcome you to come
[2:00:48] forward as we sing that. It is no
[2:00:52] secret. It is no
[2:00:58] secret what God can do.
[2:01:04] What he's done for
[2:01:08] other he'll do for
[2:01:13] you. With arms wide
[2:01:18] open, he'll pardon
[2:01:23] you. It is no secret.
