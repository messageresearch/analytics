name jesus you're worthy lord jesus amen how great is our god and today by his grace because of his mercy we can let our little light of ours shine amen certainly inspired by that song by our youth amen i believe god uses little children in fact he commends us unless we become like them we can't even enter in amen we really enjoyed our time last night such a wonderful time to be together and something about eating together kind of draws you together and about to sing the christmas songs and we really appreciate all the effort that was done or what a blessing it's been to have love in the heart of the people to labor it's just i am blessed i just want you to know that and thank you to each and every one of you that that labor amen turn with me if you would into the book of second corinthians chapter five for just one verse a reading i want to talk about a portable embassies today amen before we read let's look to the author of this word our gracious lord savior king master you are everything to us lord amen thank you for rewriting our life one day getting a hold of our attention turning our lives around lord we want to be sure to give you thanks for the mercies that we that you give us every day that are new every day for our life and lord we need your mercies we pray that you forgive us of our sins our thoughts and anything lord that would hinder the moving of your spirit in our heart and in the service because of other hearts that we're standing by lord we all need you and we pray today that you come and take the preeminence and the service that you would accomplish the very purpose that you've gathered us together for lord we commit ourself into your hands lord myself as the speaker lord take these lips and use them lord we the people as our ears take our ears and listen give us an ear to hear what you're speaking to the church lord lord we don't want to be away from you but we want to be in the spirit today and catch what the very meaning of your word is in the spirit we committed all to you lord we ask that you meet the needs that would be amongst us lord whether they be physical whether they be spiritual mental financial lord you're a god that is able to do exceedingly above all that we'd ask or think and you care about every one of us we thank you for these things now we praise you and ask it all in jesus christ's name amen amen second corinthians chapter 5 verse number 20. now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ's dead be reconciled to god god bless you may be seated here paul says we are ambassadors for christ one of the most misunderstood ideas i believe about being a believer is just because we gave our life to christ one day doesn't mean we have given our life to christ every day doesn't mean that we're walking in the spirit every day but jesus told us a powerful secret he said if we could just deny ourselves paul said if you walk in the spirit you'll not fulfill the lust of the flesh god will be able to use us more what happens when we walk in our flesh simply we fulfill our desire so what happens when we walk in the spirit we fulfill god's desire we don't we don't even want to walk in our flesh and try to do god's desire it just messes things up god takes a selfish life self-centered only concerned about themselves and changes their very nature into the image of christ whereby the love of christ inside their hall now constrains them to live for others they feel in debt to live out god's desire and not their own anymore and so god says here in the scriptures that he makes us ambassadors for christ this is not an option like going to college where you decide what you want to be god's perfect will is not for you to have an opinion about being an ambassador for christ it's not like we have a electoral vote whether we want to or not if your nature gets completely changed when all where all things become new and all things are of god god is going to take your life and you will become an ambassador for him he gives us a ministry of reconciliation the bible says no this is not meant as a preacher or a preaching but rather as a servant that god gives attendance to god god makes us servants and he takes our lives and we now are used them in every possible way as that's our ministry this word manifested in the flesh to bring people closer to the image of christ it can't just be in front of a group of people this ministry is for every for the young for the old it's for every single one that comes to christ and christ has his way god will use that vessel because all things were created by him and for him and for his glory he's not interested in my glory not even the slightest not even the very little god would you just no no flesh will glory in his presence we make glory but we'll step out of his presence he just goes like this now embassies that we know are in foreign countries and they're a they're in a fixed location people seek asylum and refuge there is a u.s citizen or they want to be it's considered a place of safety and security a shelter like a safe house from the foreign country that they're in at the time but we as ambassadors for christ are not in a fixed location we are a portable embassy we're mobile we move from place to place but with the same purpose not for the physical body but for the souls that need to be convinced that they need christ not just for those who know they need christ you first have to give them the word and let them know that they're going to go to hell in this world this foreign country that they're in and if something inside them says i believe that then they found the refuge through you their souls need refuge they need safety the bible says that the name of christ is the high tower where the righteous run into and are safe that he is a present help in a time of needs psalms 91 verse 2 says i will say of the lord he is my refuge he is my fortress my god in him i will trust i'll say today thank god that he sent somebody by my way he sent a portable embassy my way to tell me that i am going to hell without him because the churches i went to i felt if i just did this and if i just did that they told me i would be just fine but my nature never seemed to change and that's the evidence when christ comes into your heart something happens on the inside god doesn't want our wa our wallet our wardrobe our hair the way that we look he's not interested in how many candles we burn he wants our heart inside there he has control of changing the nature and when he does every one of those things will be his your hair your dress your pocketbook everything will eventually because he become his because everything was created for his glory now we're sent out as a beacon of light i love that little song by our young people this morning in this foreign world where people don't even know they're lost our job is to convince them that they need christ and it's pretty hard we've all experienced it have we not but we still have to convince them that's the that's the job now we got to do it in a way that they're not offended but they may get offended and as long as they don't get offended by you it's okay but if the word offends them you can't do nothing about it i'll say like this if you ever get offended by the word something is wrong in your relationship with christ because the bible says great peace have they that loved my law and nothing shall offend them fall in love with jesus that's always the test paul was told by jesus and his encounter like his first encounter with jesus he said i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to open the eyes of the people to turn them from darkness to light from the power of satan unto god now all that responsibility was put on paul so he just couldn't say you know what i think you should maybe you know kind of consider you know going to church you know you know jesus maybe he you know he could be that ain't going to convince anybody when we're living in the world and trying to convince somebody of jesus that ain't going to convince anybody they've got to know you're serious it's a serious job but that's our job and we've got to accept that responsibility jesus said in matthew 28 verse 19 before he left he said go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i've commanded you and along with you always even to the end of the world this is called god's great commission to the church it's still happening now the majority of believers view this commission as not so great come on you can be honest with with me this morning trying to be honest with you it's more like a a college elect a college elective it's optional it's not really necessary or mandatory these believers i'm gonna say it like this straight out have not totally surrendered over to god they have not allowed christ to be preeminent in their life their personal mission is not in life is not the commission that he gave they have a different commission but those who have set their affections on things above and not on things of earth god has given them the ministry of reconciliation amen they are truly ambassadors for christ working from my portable embassy sometimes our power has gone out at work the phones have gone out sometimes the phones have gone out power's gone out but the work must go on so you get on your cell phone you get your car and you're talking to your customers we may not have the perfect setting when we're in the grocery store when we're at the fuel pump but god wants to use you right where you're at right where you live with your family with your neighbors with those you come in contact that you've never met before we're sent out as beacons of light in this former world with an awesome responsibility being prepared for this work requires more time on our knees than it does studying let that sink in we need to study it's required paul told timothy in 2 timothy chapter 2 verse 15 a familiar scripture to us all study to show thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth do you know the word study only appears three times in the bible the word pray is mentioned over 300 times the word prayer is mentioned over a hundred times now we've got 400 to three i think we need to spend more time praying than studying come on we need to spend more time with the author of the manual to know exactly what it's saying than we do trying to figure things out with our understanding when god got a hold of the disciples they went out as portable embassies they didn't sit around waiting for people to come to them oh i can't wait for an opportunity you've got your whole life occupied till i come once our candle has been lit god wants us to go light one amen fact the prophet said it's not fair that we should hear the gospel twice if others have not heard it once who's even concerned about the person who hasn't heard it once jesus said that you shall be witnesses or portable embassies unto me in jerusalem in all judea in samaria and the uttermost parts of the earth you have to be a portable embassy to to go on all those places you can't invite the whole world to this place so god sends us out with a commission to bring christ to them they don't know they need to come here before christ was introduced to me i thought it was just fine after peter and john received the power of the holy ghost god sent them out as a portable embassy to the gate called beautiful turn with me if you would acts chapter 3 verse 1 if you want to write it down there's a man there that needed healing peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer notice the hour of prayer wasn't the hour of studying being the ninth hour and a certain man laying from his mother's room carried was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple what what a life to have to ask all your life we're blessed we're blessed all we've got to do is believe the word do what god tells us to do yeah it may some of us uh some of us honestly need to start working more who's seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked at alms and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us wow kind of like follow me as i follow christ look on us they became a portable embassy for christ and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them and then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give iv in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk a portable embassy [Music] such as i have i wonder what we have today because money can't buy you power can't buy you the the faith in jesus christ tell you but the power of the holy ghost will do it that's what we need is the power of the holy ghost that's why we need to pray you know we can sit down and read the bible like we do a newspaper a magazine but when you get down on your knees it's a whole nother ballgame in acts chapter 4 verse 13 now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were we might just say just unlearn and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus i don't care how unlearned you are i don't care how ignorant you may seem at times but if you just spend more time with jesus people are going to take knowledge that you've been with him something happens in that prayer closet change takes place and the holy ghost comes upon us people will notice there's something different they're not going to see you and you about to say look on me because you'll know it's not you it's christ in you the hope of glory when jesus looked at the people he looked through the bible says the eyes of compassion how he could help so many people he said he was moved with compassion upon them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd so when you go to the grocery store you're driving down the road you see all these cars you also just recognize that there's so many people in the world that are scattered abroad having no shepherd having no leadership for their lives in matthew chapter 9 verse 37 then saith jesus to his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers the laborers those who are willing to do more than sit around the laborers are few he said pray pray pray don't study pray pray ye there for the lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into the harvest in other words he was saying pray for portable embassies pray there'll be somebody that goes out and gets things that are scattered and let them know that we have a great shepherd you christ in you will lead christ to them to him christ isn't doing the work you're going to lead them to you i wonder today what eyes we're looking through what is our interest with others are we looking for a friend for fellowship for a following what is our real interest when we talk to others is it about our reputation is it we want them to see cease that we're special or are they are we really wanting them to see a special god there's a difference do we see them the way jesus does do we see others fainting when we look at them or do we see them in some carnal way do we feel they're scattered and a lot of people are scattered their own thoughts are scattered do we see people need a shepherd then it's our responsibility to bring the shepherd to them most of the world doesn't want a shepherd that's why we have to be moved with compassion because it's going to take the love of god in our heart to go there and be tore up by their words to bring them a greater life a greater light than they're living in and i'll tell you today's saints it's not just for those who don't know christ it's for those who only know christ so much and god wants to be more to them do we love others enough to lay down our life for others brother branham said eternal life is living for others but do we really know what that means the only way that we're going to live for others correctly is by being moved by compassion the same thing that jesus had when he looked at them there's a lot of people that don't have compassion and they want a following they want people coming to their church buying their magazine buying their prayer books their prayer cloths you just send a love offering we'll send you out this whole set of tapes it's only 500 just cover you know the postage if we're supposed to teach others to observe all things whatsoever god has commanded us it's going to take more than just words brother branham said one place compassion is doing the will of god doing the will of god not talking about it not saying amen to it or i believe it it's actually doing it if we're going to teach others what god's perfect will is for their lives it's going to require sacrifices romans chapter 12 verse 1 says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your body a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god this is your reasonable service my you go get your car worked on you you you you go into a restaurant you get service and all of us um things stick out to us if it's a real bad service it sticks out to us i'm not giving them a tip i'm not coming here no more i'm going to not put a i'm a bad review or if it's really good you're so excited that you just want to tell them now you would think laying down your life every day for god would be a top-notch service but god says that's just your reasonable service that's the least that we should to me we should be doing for god as a portable embassy present your body a living sacrifice and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god amen what i love about this scripture is every day we all have a chance to prove what is the perfect will of god i know it's the perfect will of god for me not to steal to go rob to punch people and i can feel good that i'm in god's perfect will and neglect the great commission neglect to be an ambassador neglect the ministry of reconciliation neglect to be a portable embassy i i'm so glad god showed me one day that there's not a man on the planet that can keep me from serving him from the dictates of my heart it's okay if people don't want to give ain't going to stop me it's my relationship with god god is not going to reward you according to my labors and i am not going to receive any kind of reward from your labors we're all rewarded from our labors not that we do it for reward the only reward i want to i don't even want to hear anything of course i want to hear i want to make it in that's what i really want how do you feel like it's going to be well done i want to hear it i don't think i i deserve that i don't know what else to say that's just how i feel but i want to make it in there and i want to have the right garment on i don't want to be found getting kicked out because i had the wrong garment on turn with me to second timothy chapter four verse one these set of scriptures paul not only explains to timothy his responsibility as an ambassador but he also conveys to timothy what it's going to be like walking in a foreign country so just imagine yourself in liberia afghanistan especially now it would not be fun you'd be looking for refuge and so paul is trying to explain this to timothy in verse one he says i charge thee therefore before god the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom now every time we come to church god is appearing unto us he's bringing his judgment to our lives and why is he doing that it's because we don't want to be judged at the white throne judgment without mercy today we can come to church and be judged by the word with mercy his word isn't anything less and it's just the same as it is going to be on the white throne if you ever wonder what's going to happen on the white throne judgment he's he's going to judge according to this word the same thing we hear at church and when we accept the word into our heart lord i want to i want to obey it i want to become it i want to manifest it god gives you mercy today first peter chapter 4 verse 17 says for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god is that right and if it first began at us what shall the end of them that obey not the gospel in other words we have mercy with us and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear we gladly come here we know god's mercies are here how is he going to judge the quick and the dead when he appears we can either be quick to hear say amen i want that for my life or we can just sit like a bump on log and be dead about it just it all depends on you primo agency your choice your desires i want to be quick i i may not make it home how many you know when i was young i used to gamble and i gambled quite a bit and i gambled a lot and i'll say it like this where all the whole world is a gambler of some sort anytime you put off doing something that god asked you to do today that's gambling god wants you to pray and you say i'll put it off no that's gambling all right i charge thee before god and the lord jesus christ you shall judge the quick and the dead and disappearing and his kingdom notice that word charge that's a strong word paul is charging timothy that word charge means demand certify with clear evidence before god a demand not an option it's a charge from heaven preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine now don't think for a minute this is for preachers that word preach just means herald proclaim as a public crier the divine truth it's up to all of us to proclaim the truth as a portable embassy we need to always be ready to bring more of christ to others it doesn't matter if you feel like it's the season or not it's always the season to bring christ the word more to others doesn't matter if you feel there's an opportunity or there's not an opportunity help someone every one of us ought to be bringing christ to one another that's what it means to edify the church every contact every every conversation that you have with somebody there ought to be some sort of building going on if you can't do nothing except in your heart say god bless this man when i shake his hands inside lord how use me to help this person amen that's the only way that the whole body can edify itself it can't be just behind the pulpit right then everybody'd have to get up here and do it that's not what it means every content we have with somebody to me provides an opportunity to bring christ to them now we can either just blow it off and talk about ourselves or we can actually help that person you know brother branham said i'm starting to feel a little religious right now but it's a true saints we blow so much opportunity because we're interested in something else edify edify one another it starts with a compassion in your heart i want to see this person that i'm talking to a little higher in christ god is very serious about us growing and he wants to use one another he wants to use all of you to help me can you believe that so don't don't mess up an opportunity to help me i need you i want you to help me i need you to help me you young children i need you to help me christ and everyone helping everyone we need to see christ in one another we're spending too much time looking at the wrong things with one another trying to build ourselves or something we it needs to be all of christ in our church now we need to be instant that means be presently in the mind of christ walking in the spirit always ready to give an answer for the hope that lies within us reprove rebuke and exhort now harmony wants to be that kind of embassy sounds scary doesn't it that word reprove means to prove to be false i want you to think when you're coming to either somebody in the church or somebody that don't know the lord we're supposed to reprove rebuke and exhort i already made mention every one of us ought to be provoking one other good works that's just scriptural i don't care if you're young or old to reprove means to prove to be false to convince or to tell a fault that seems to be pretty easy we don't have no problem doing that one to rebuke means to tax upon to express a stern disapproval to exhort means to call invite beseech entreat or to pray about the situation so we see a need the first thing we have to do is convince the person that this is wrong hey if we care about the person if you truly care and you want that person to walk in truth you have to let them know that where they're at isn't truth and then you have to put a tax upon them that await to express a stern disapproval if i say to uh brother mark brother mark you have gone to the very end of my approval and the ties that you have been wearing here of late do not match now he's gonna walk home with a disapproval attacks upon him i need to be more careful about the ties i put on for brother john and then we as christians we call we invite we beseech we entreat we provide the answer amen pray about this look in the mirror green doesn't always match orange pray about this you understand what i'm trying to say the problem with a lot of portable embassies is that they don't have the life of the word inside in other words they can tell a fault they can prove something is wrong or they can sternly disapprove of somebody but they don't know how to have the right spirit about it they don't know how to do it with patience and long suffering they don't want to take the time to really help somebody they just have enough time to prove that somebody's wrong about something but this is not a god's portable embassy when this happens repeatedly it shows their motive is wrong they're not looking through eyes of compassion they're looking through eyes critical eyes i really you know what every time i have interaction with everybody i'm staring at how much they care i don't judge him on that but you know we all know this we'd rather know when somebody is speaking something to us we'd rather know how much somebody cares about us than how much they know is that true we all want to be cared for loved if you're my brother if you're my sister help me well brother you're the pastor and and what scripture are you talking about pastors don't need help no they're just bombarded with everything but they don't need help they carry everything they deal with everything and they don't need help god bless this couple here coming and just having a burden that meant so much to me we need burdens one for another we need to check our motives we don't want to be too proud to think that we couldn't be wrong about something now paul taught timothy to re reprove rebuke and exhort the right way as a portable embassy you must do it with all long suffering what if all you're going to do is just tell you know brother roger you need to wear shoes in the church that's all you're interested in doing is just telling somebody when they're wrong there's no need to be long-suffering but you have to do it with long-suffering so you have to do it in such a way that he may keep wearing body without the shoes into the sanctuary but you you have a vision you know eventually those shoes are going to be on that feet that's what long suffering's for and doctrine scriptural instructions so we need to be fortified i'm just going to talk about that word long suffering it means to be fortified with forbearance in other words self-restraint to have strength enough to handle the situation with proper grace it means to have patience enough to teach others with humility now this is the way a portable embassy works come on in other words you possess self-control you're not rude you're not arrogant you're not mean about it your motive is pure compassion hallelujah you're not interested in hurting people and if you do you do something about it something inside of you just wants things to be right it's the love of god in your heart colossians chapter 4 verse 5 says as a portable embassy walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time don't putts around don't lay around don't be talking about things that are just meaningless you know you only have a little time to help me and i'm still waiting for you to come and help me redeem the time what about your brother your sister those that you live with why do we say oh god's got to do that god's got to deal with it god's got to i can't that's not scriptural you've got to have faith to help you got to have so much faith in god that god inside of you can help somebody you can't say i'm a portable embassy in the working and you know we're under construction right now and one day you know i'll be uh ready you know to to go out and help my brothers and sisters that only last so long the bible says we ought to we ought to be teaching and we have need that one would teach us the first principles of the oracles of christ in other words there's things that are persuaded of us by god we should be further along time's running out we need to redeem the time amen let your speech be always with truth no it doesn't say that does it it says let your conversation be always with grace and then season it put a little seasoning in there season it with salt you are the salt of the earth you're the light of the world let it shine let people taste you that ye may know how you ought to answer every man every man not just those that are less spiritual than you every man every man that means you must have all of god to deal with all of men don't think you're incapable all you need is love compassion paul not only commissions timothy with proper authority but he lets him know it's not it's not going to get easy er it's going to get worse in the world things are going to wax worse and worse we're going to feel more and more as time goes on that we're in a foreign country every month that goes by things are more crazier like my daughter was telling me last night it's not getting hard to be praying for lord jesus come just done done with this place second timothy chapter 4 verse 3 says for the time will come when they these are believers will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lust simply means after their own desires they shall heap or accumulate to themselves teachers having itching ears people think they have enough truth to get by so they become picky and choosy of what they want to hear that's why it'd be better to come to church and say lord i know that i'm lacking i know that i'm needy i know there's something in my life that you want me to have god open my eyes to see open my ears to hear we're going to face the facts when most people come to church they want to hear what they want to hear they may not say it out loud but it's the truth but when the bride comes to church she's longing to know how to be more in his image how to possess more of the nature of her husband because she wants to be like him how to live the life of the word that's actually being preached to them we don't come here for information we come here for the life of the word and they notice these people and they shall turn their ears away turn their ears from the truth and shall be turned onto fables now fables are just something that isn't all truth i don't care what science fiction thing you've ever looked at there's an element of there that's of truth that you can relate to because that's how it grabs you to go there i mean planet of the apes when i was a kid i used to watch them i had dad you got to take me to these things we go to sit there go out have the big drive in put the thing inside you know well there's apes on the earth there's a reality there and the whole world knows that you know there's there's some sort of at one time they used to talk or something something there to grab you but we know there's a missing link for sure so the word when when satan gets this off track he'll give you some truth that's okay you got enough you don't have to dig in anymore hey if you're really elect you know yeah if you're elect you're going to make it that's amen but if you're also elect you're going to dig in you see what i'm saying it's in which how that spirit is coming across and as much as god is amongst us we already know satan is not going to leave us alone he's going to look for an open door to try to get in there to rock us asleep but you know what we got to get out there we got to be a portable embassy we got to go out there and tell others about jesus we got to redeem the time the time is short so there's an element of truth that you can relate to but there's a portion that's not true and people in the churches are turning from the truth they they want entertainment they want the lights flashing they want the music going they want to feel a good time what if christ is trying to tell us that he wants to be more in her life that takes a dying out to achieve that to have that why wouldn't we rather sit here and be entertained you understand and if we when we come to church we're in the flesh for in the spirit it's up to us to get out of the flesh because the flesh always wants i i the flesh always wants my flesh is no different than your flesh all flesh is the same it's just it's all bad it's all bad don't be satisfied with how much of christ you have long for the fullness of his nature to be able to bring christ to every single person with all your conversation with all your behavior verse 5 but watch thou in all things endure affliction do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry do the work of an evangelist this means be a portable embassy and we're all called get out there win souls bring souls to the truth of the hour think it would be wrong in this age to bring souls to martin luther message you have to start there but you don't be satisfied there motive has got to bring them to the word of the hour because they're living in this age make full proof of thy ministry in other words don't just preach it make full proof your life becomes the word that you're preaching your behavior how you interact how you handle things are you talking with grace are you full of compassion make full proof of your ministry not partial proof bring souls to christ there's my proof come on now don't get quiet on me people are attracted to the life of the word inside of you not to the verbality it's a new word i made up to the life of the word good example to me of a portable embassy is we heard a little bit about it in our our men's meeting last wednesday and a little bit here in this in the service uh that brother bruce had ministered but i wanted to take a little bit further in saint john chapter four starting with verse 24. now there was a woman of samaria and she was at the well he says i must needs go by there as a portable embassy and jesus told her that his father is seeking true worshipers let's pick it up in verse 24 god is a spirit they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth and the woman saith unto him i know that when that the messiah cometh which is called christ he when he has come he will tell us all things now jesus said in verse 26 i that speak unto thee am he at that moment god revealed to her who jesus was i that speak unto thee am he upon this rock i'll build my church something happens when christ is revealed to us now we understand why jesus felt led that he must needs go by samaria i want us to recognize what happened after god reveals himself to her in verse 27 and upon this came his disciples and marveled and they talked with that he talked with this woman yet no man said well what seeketh thou or why talk his doll with her the woman then left her water pot and noticed and went her way the same way that she always went her way into the city but she had a different motive this time and say it to the men come see a man which told me all things that i did is not this the christ now christ revealed to her and now as a portable embassy come see this same christ that's why we have to go out because jesus isn't here in a mortal body anymore he is in the his body of believers doing the same works in fact he said greater works shall you do because i go to my father so he calls us to be a portable embassy for him come see i'm sure everybody didn't come and we're living in an age where the evil is just as worse as it's ever has ever been so not many are going to come but should that take away the compassion that we have in the heart for those that are his i believe the bible says that god doesn't have and take any pleasure in the death of the wicked he will that all men would be saved and where is that nature inside of us when we're laying on our beds when we're praying in a prayer closet something inside should be stirring redeeming the time to get out there let others know that this thing is real not have this uh intellectual attitude of well if if they're elected or god somehow he's gonna what are you gonna do you might as well tear this out of the bible moses tara the great commissioner of the bible take out the words go ye out and put in there he'll bring them in come on may not want to hear it let's say it anyways because here's the thing the devil is the one that preaches that to us because that way we can sit comfortably in church in the message and say i'm a message to them that i'm safe glad you're safe care about the others that are not god give us time to to get through this message today she went her way but she had a different motive this time go home today with a different motive share jesus with somebody if you're not sure what to do say jesus loves you come to church jesus loves you come to church let them get in the presence of god then you make sure you pray for them very much that when they come to church they will feel the presence of god amen she didn't wait around after she got in contact with god she didn't wait around waiting for other believers to come to her she went out as a portable embassy she brought the good news to whoever would hear the same spirit that willed the disciples to go e out and preach the gospel that same spirit was now moving inside of her she was moved by compassion hey listen this is just about me you need to come and hear this man amen she was moved with compassion the love of god because there are souls that need to be saved how about you do you feel obligated today do you feel the spirit of god moving you to go out let god use your body to be a portable embassy i i told brother mark yesterday i believe it was yesterday how proud i was of him of his reaching out and i'll say every single one of you that are taking time to reach out to somebody i'm proud of you that's what we need to be doing fighting against this flesh that just wants everything to be easy like we want an audience go give jesus to somebody go give jesus to somebody let your spirit now become an ambassador for christ beseeching others to be reconciled to god in a greater way it's okay if somebody has christ they can have more now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you and christ said be reconciled to god what an honor it is to bring christ to somebody it is just an honor it isn't our knowledge that constrains us to go it's not our wisdom it's not our talents it's not our gifts it's not our abilities second corinthians chapter 5 verse 14 says for the love of christ constrains us not all those other things doesn't matter about the talents and the abilities we need the love of christ that's what constrains us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which lived should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him that died for them and rose again amen when you really sink your teeth into what christ has done for you you don't feel like you're your own anymore that you're governed by a different will the love of christ constrains us to reach out to others what's god love doing in your hearts today are you looking for people to come to you are you looking for the easier path to share christ come on just be be honest with me i i am not pointing any fingers just kidding but i want you to be honest are you looking for the easier way to bring christ to somebody brother branham said in the message running from the presence of the lord he says but it's the e but it's easy to go the way the world goes i would imagine if we preached the gospel that made everybody feel good we would probably have more people here today i think so if we had more entertainment more laughter more fun more enjoyment more coffee donuts type of thing we would have more because that is appealing he said it's easy to go the way the world goes he said but christianity is an everyday rugged life living for god in this present world he said it's a constant burning of the fire and the love of god in the heart that sets you of fire it's the fire of god that sets you on fire not just i have the fire of god but i'm you're not set on fire the fire sets you on fire there's a difference between you holding a picture of a fire and walking around like this and saying i've got the fire of god versus you being lit up it's a constant burning not a sundays and wednesdays and i'm i'm i am challenged on here i'm challenged this is not i'm here and you're not this is lord help us all to get there it's a constant burning of the fire in the love of god and heart that sets you of fire and puts you out yonder notice put you out yonder not lord bring people to me give me an opportunity put you out yonder with people people where there's people their souls and what do you do with those people make converts to christ wow you mean so much for friendship fellowship following get i can't do any of that i can't just hang out and have a good time no that's not the commission now i know this is a strong word but it cannot get any simpler than this it can't get any simpler he says but you must accept your responsibility it's a reason brother brandon's calling it a responsibility the same thing paul was telling timothy and the responsibility that that god has given us in this day is to bring this message this message this message that's strong and as i get older and i know my days are shortening up i feel the responsibility greater than i've ever felt pressing on he said we must do it we must get down to it in everywhere we go and tell the message and tell the people that jesus is coming amen i love the simplicity of the message come see a man that told me all things jesus is coming because if they really i'll tell you i remember laying on my bed knowing that if i did not give my heart to jesus i was going to hell something inside of me just knew that i had to give my life to god and if you just tell people jesus is coming soon it's the same thing as saying um you're you're going to be you're going to be dying next week and you need to get your house in order you need to make sure you take care of the important things in your life because when jesus comes it's all over it ain't like he's coming and then we're going to go on with our life so by simply letting people know jesus is really coming soon god will be doing the work in their heart and that he's god and he's coming soon and there's not a hope left in the world but the coming of the lord i know i've read this message or this quote a few times but i think it's something we just can't let it slip a little bit too much the love of god is shed abroad in their heart by the holy ghost that's why i say we need to pray more it's not about studying and knowledge it's about getting on your knees and having god move you he can use a child child don't even know what's going on but god will use that child how much more someone says god use me are you with me to be a portable embassy i just want to read one more scripture here it's in first corinthians chapter 15 verse 58 i don't know i don't think i gave it but it's first corinthians 15 verse 58 now it doesn't matter if you're a male a female young or old rich or poor it doesn't matter if you're smart not smart talented not talented we've all been called and elected to bring christ more to the next person understand the calling there it's it's a responsibility but everybody don't take it seriously like you know it's like it's more private it's not you're you're like public you're for the public that's what that word preacher means that you're for you're you're a public servant therefore my beloved brother and be ye steadfast unmovable and always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord let's stand together what what a commission to be steadfast to be unmovable to be always doing the work of the lord and to be encouraged that our labor is not in vain i was sitting at the dinner table i believe it was the dinner table i'm not sorry i i i i don't know if it was with brother mark or my daughter ann but i said the one thing that i regret i think was the dinner table with both of you i regret not spending more time laboring for the lord because everything that i have spent for myself is in vain it will not profit i want to i want i want to commission you but it's not my commission i want you to feel a renewed in god's commission to you to go out be a portable embassy look at yourself as someone that can bring a refuge to others and you don't you don't have to be real good you have to be really in love amen really in love not real good reading love the love of god in your heart that love will just reach out it automatically has its own motive to make a convert for christ we don't have to worry about working on the motive we just give ourselves over to the lord amen amen let's bow our heart in a word of prayer i wonder with every heart bowed wonder if there'd be someone here today says brother john would you remember me in prayer i want to be what the word today that's almost every hand just raised praise the lord let's believe now let's believe our heavenly father we're grateful for all the times that you have used us in our lives as a a portable embassy the lord as we've heard today lord something inside of us feels that we need to be getting out a little bit more reaching out a little bit more to be to let our little light of ours shine that others would see our good works and be give glory to you father pray for the hearts behind the hands that was raised the desire lord that is inside of each one to just be used by you may they feel that freedom and liberty to just give themselves so much to you lord that nothing could stop them nothing could hinder them and i pray that you would use them in a mighty way to bring many souls to you to make many converts may they not look in a small way but may they look in a big way you have not because you asked that lord we're asking that you would use us to win many souls lord we know that's our that's what's going to be shining around us lord help us to redeem the time we may not get called upon by our neighbor by our husband by our wife by our brother our sister but lord you've called us to go out use us lord no matter how many times we get turned down use us how many times we get rejected use us lord let us feel your presence as we're in your will let us give you praise when we're rejected when we're thrown down when we're when we're when somebody wants to put us in chains lord and says we're just not anything lord may you just break those chains and help us to go and preach your word more yes lord help us to to preach it with all longsuffering point others to that straight narrow path lord you are the greatest one you are worth living for you're worth you're worth giving our lives for may the love of god constrain us to go out lord we commit ourselves to you as a body lord bless this church maybe the lighthouse intended it may we edify one another in love lord we commit ourselves to you give you all the praise now in jesus christ precious name we pray amen we thank you jesus amen let's

groundwork it's done for us a couple years ago before i retired we were in the city truck going out to a job site i was bothered because i had been into brother branham's teachings and that and he always said that you think this is just for me it's not amen it's for you too if you can get in that channel amen that's right i thought that's true but things like he did and it was about the colorado storm i was going through that over and over and i'm thinking man that's hard you know amen that if god would call him back up to the top of the mountain to speak to him and tell him to speak to the storm speak to the storm amen and i thought that's for prophets it's not for me but i was under strong conviction right along in that truck and i was getting goose bumps and i knew something was going to happen and uh the lord spoke to me he said open your mouth and speak and i thought real quick you know trying to cover my tracks lord i don't know what to speak he said open your mouth make an utterance i'll speak through you i thought that's easy now so i opened my mouth and spoke made another utterance all i did was made another uh i heard him talk he spoke through me amen fellas we'll go up here to maple we'll go up here we're on a hill road coming out front we'll go up here to jennings road make a right turn we'll go down toward the airport when we hit maple roll we'll make a left turn and as we along the woods so big woods on that north side and said when we cross over that little bridge or that little creek and we come to the edge of the woods we'll see a field to the right side and it will be divided in half by hedgerow 50 foot in from from the woods on the right side was it will be a deer he'll be standing side right broadside to us and he'll be grazing grass my boss says well we'll see right so he turned he went down the maple rose made a left turn we went over the bridge and he slowed down as we come to the edge of the field to about two miles an hour and the boys in the backseat are jumping over my shoulders looking around i saw the hedgerow we moved along real slowly and as we cleared the woods there was a deer standing sideways broadside with his head down crazy amen my boss says it's 10 30 in the morning my boss says you put that deer there didn't you i said no but there was a lesson for me and and i said no but i know who did besides i believe you guys don't yes and uh so they sat there and washed the while then we left amen next day we go down there again he makes the left turn we're supposed to go over to the uh on the field and the airport and he goes down there and i said jim that deer is not going to be there he said you don't mind if i see you and i said no i don't mind but he won't be there so we pulled up there and wasn't there and so he just turned around we went back to work but the lord spoke to me instantly he said keith i love that oh and and since things that happened that happened that was happening a lot especially when i was doing a lot of prayer fasting amen and that's really a key amen thank you brother amen amen i tell you you maybe she just said we're gonna we're gonna sing a song be dismissed send the light i know it's getting late what i love about that is that brother batman the lord didn't didn't allow brother batman to think that was for the unbelievers that were in the car for his boss i should say only because i'm not god i don't know but god wanted brother batman to come up higher as much as he knew about god as much as he believed but that he needed to believe more that god could use him and that's how we must when we come to church feel the same way that god no matter how much we know this this message is not to take away our christianity never is the the this this ministry is to continually bring us up higher and and god wants us to believe more help the our belief and to believe more amen let's sing send the light before we're dismissed and you may be seated
