[37:57] reading of the word turn with me if you
[37:59] would to first john chapter four we want
[38:01] to
[38:02] speak on love today
[38:05] love is very important
[38:07] um brother branham said nothing but
[38:09] perfect love can enter into that place
[38:12] and he said whatever you do lay
[38:13] everything aside until you get perfect
[38:15] love that's how important it is he said
[38:17] get to the place where you can love
[38:19] everyone
[38:20] even your enemies
[38:22] so
[38:23] love is is very important
[38:25] before we begin reading let's look to
[38:27] the author this book heavenly father
[38:29] we thank you for the privilege that we
[38:31] have today to be in your house
[38:33] to worship you lord to express
[38:36] such love that you placed inside of us
[38:38] back to you
[38:40] oh god we love you today because you
[38:42] first loved us
[38:44] and lord we thank you for your great
[38:45] love and today lord as we enter into
[38:48] this
[38:49] part of the service lord
[38:52] we ask that you would come in a mighty
[38:53] way today
[38:55] come in the power of revelation and help
[38:58] us to see the depths of your love today
[39:01] lord we want to know you in a greater
[39:04] measure lord
[39:05] only you can do this
[39:07] lord to take our carnality our our flesh
[39:11] the scales off our eyes the wax out of
[39:14] our ears
[39:15] and god
[39:16] fill us so full of the holy ghost today
[39:20] lord we commit this service and ask that
[39:23] you would meet every need that be among
[39:24] us there's unspoken requests things on
[39:27] our hearts and lord the word of god
[39:29] today is a discerner of the thoughts and
[39:31] intents of our heart we pray that thy
[39:34] word would come and minister to each and
[39:36] every one of us
[39:37] be with those that are live streaming in
[39:39] their homes wherever they might be we
[39:42] ask god that you would minister
[39:44] revelation to each of them we thank you
[39:46] for these things now we commit the
[39:48] service and lord that you fulfill your
[39:51] purpose all in the precious name of
[39:53] jesus christ
[39:54] amen amen first john chapter 4 verse
[39:58] number 7
[40:00] reads
[40:01] beloved let us love one another
[40:04] for love is of god
[40:06] and everyone that loveth is born of god
[40:08] and knoweth god
[40:10] and he that loveth not knoweth not god
[40:15] for god
[40:16] is
[40:17] love
[40:19] not just an attribute of god
[40:22] but actually divide love is god amen and
[40:26] then one more scripture beast
[40:28] uh saint john chapter 3
[40:31] verse 16 perhaps
[40:33] the most
[40:35] read scripture
[40:36] in the bible
[40:40] for god so loved the world
[40:44] that he gave his only begotten son
[40:47] that whosoever believeth in him should
[40:50] not perish but have everlasting life
[40:53] amen
[40:54] for god sent not his son into the world
[40:56] to condemn the world but that the world
[40:58] through him might be saved and he that
[41:00] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[41:03] that believeth not is condemned already
[41:05] because he
[41:06] have not believed in the name of the
[41:08] only begotten son and this is the
[41:10] condemnation that light has come into
[41:12] the world
[41:13] and men
[41:16] choose to love darkness
[41:19] rather
[41:20] than light
[41:21] because their deeds
[41:24] were evil
[41:25] god bless you may be seated may god
[41:28] add
[41:29] his blessings
[41:31] all abundantly
[41:33] to this service amen
[41:34] before i forget in case i
[41:37] i missed this i was given this
[41:39] announcement
[41:42] that all checks that would be written
[41:44] this month
[41:45] and put into the offerings for for ties
[41:47] and offerings will not be deposited
[41:50] until next month because you know we're
[41:52] going to be gone so i just want that
[41:54] you all to know that in case your checks
[41:57] don't clear
[41:59] that's our excuse this time
[42:01] [Laughter]
[42:03] amen homie's happy to be a christian
[42:06] amen
[42:07] amen
[42:08] amen
[42:10] well when we think about love we
[42:13] we think about
[42:14] wonderful things do we not
[42:17] things perhaps
[42:18] like romance
[42:20] or someone being nice or sacrificing for
[42:23] us or or forgiving us of something that
[42:25] we've done wrong and we say that was
[42:26] love
[42:28] but there
[42:29] are things that we may not think so much
[42:31] about
[42:32] about love and and one of them is the
[42:35] strength of love its ability to
[42:37] withstand opposition
[42:40] i want to entitle this message love
[42:42] hurts
[42:44] love hurts
[42:45] love will get hurt
[42:47] and love will hurt you
[42:49] it's a little playing words but we want
[42:51] to take a look at the the strength of
[42:53] love and
[42:55] the motive of love this morning amen
[42:59] the love of of god is it's very hard to
[43:02] define
[43:04] can you say amen to that
[43:06] it's often misunderstood
[43:08] it's a mis
[43:12] represented and misinterpreted
[43:16] um we know that god's love is is
[43:18] unconditional but yet one day it will
[43:21] only be conditional
[43:23] it's available for everyone but only if
[43:25] you embrace it
[43:28] the bible tells us that nothing can
[43:29] separate us from the love of god yet
[43:31] many become separated from it
[43:35] love has no respect to persons yet one
[43:37] day it will respect only those that love
[43:40] god amen
[43:42] it's incomprehendable yet
[43:45] we are biblically instructed to be
[43:48] rooted and grounded in it
[43:53] so we got to know it right ephesians
[43:55] chapter 3 verse 18 says that we may be
[43:57] able to comprehend with all saints what
[44:00] is the breath length death and height
[44:03] and to know the love of christ which
[44:05] passeth knowledge
[44:07] that we might be filled with the
[44:08] fullness of god amen so knowing the love
[44:12] of god is it's mightily important
[44:16] it's imperative
[44:18] we must
[44:21] and not just on the surface
[44:24] but if i was to ask you to come in here
[44:27] sometime that i was gone and i probably
[44:29] did this with brother stan when i was
[44:31] away
[44:32] and i said can you please measure the
[44:35] width the length of the room
[44:38] and the height and the bible is telling
[44:40] us to know
[44:42] the love of god in these
[44:45] boundaries
[44:47] in one sense
[44:49] the love of god is boundless yet in
[44:51] another sense it has boundaries
[44:56] too often we look at god
[44:58] in part in god's love and part
[45:02] we might say there's a lot more to the
[45:03] love of god than what meets the eye or
[45:05] what comes into the mind of a man
[45:08] god who we know we read this morning is
[45:11] love it is patience his kind is
[45:14] long-suffering yet he's also identified
[45:17] this god of love is also identified as a
[45:20] consuming fire amen amen and it's a
[45:23] fearful thing to fall in the hands of a
[45:25] living god
[45:27] if if god says take your shoes off you
[45:29] better take your shoes off
[45:31] and god wasn't waiting around in front
[45:33] of moses being patient and long
[45:35] suffering he expected those shoes to
[45:38] come off
[45:41] god was not ashamed to go to calvary for
[45:44] you and me
[45:46] in fact the bible says he's not ashamed
[45:48] to call us brethren
[45:50] yet one day he will be ashamed of many
[45:54] in fact he said if you're ashamed of him
[45:56] on earth that he'll be ashamed of us in
[45:58] heaven
[46:01] for god so loved that he gave
[46:05] love has a purpose
[46:08] love will finish its objective it has a
[46:11] motive
[46:12] it has a purpose to fulfill and it will
[46:15] complete it
[46:17] love doesn't sit around like a a bump on
[46:20] a log or a picture on a wall
[46:22] waiting
[46:23] to be admired
[46:27] too many christians really don't know
[46:29] the love of god the depth of the love of
[46:31] god they don't dive into the depths they
[46:34] don't want to jump off into the deep end
[46:38] they don't know the
[46:40] depths of god's love nor do they want
[46:43] to actually
[46:45] know the responsibilities of love
[46:47] because there's a responsibility to love
[46:51] they want to run away from it
[46:54] they want to leave it for somebody else
[46:57] brother branham said in a man running
[46:59] from the presence of the lord he says
[47:01] how wishy-washy there's too many
[47:03] christians today are so soft soaped and
[47:06] everything until they think all they
[47:07] have to do is join a church or go
[47:09] somewhere and put their name on a book
[47:10] or a little something jump up and down
[47:12] and shout and something like that and
[47:14] they call it christianity
[47:18] christianity is an everyday
[47:21] rugged life
[47:22] living for god
[47:24] in this present world
[47:26] he said it's a constant burning of the
[47:29] fire and the love of god in the heart
[47:31] that sets you a fire and puts you out
[47:34] yonder with people making converts to
[47:38] christ
[47:39] and you know the next word he says
[47:41] responsibilities it's a responsibility
[47:45] love has responsibility
[47:48] love has a driving force behind it it's
[47:50] like an
[47:51] engine that powers through anything
[47:54] right
[47:55] it's really what makes it love it's its
[47:58] motive and its objective and its purpose
[48:03] love will reach to the lowest degree to
[48:07] save it
[48:09] jesus said i must needs go by samaria
[48:12] there was a need and love went to meet
[48:15] that need
[48:16] jesus made a convert out of her amen
[48:19] john chapter 4 verse 28 she left her
[48:22] water pots and went away into the city
[48:25] and saith to the man come see a man
[48:28] which told me all things
[48:29] that i ever that ever i've done is not
[48:34] this the christ
[48:38] love
[48:40] was projected amen amen sovereign grace
[48:44] took over
[48:46] brother branham said when
[48:48] when love is projected sovereign grace
[48:50] will take over it will go out and
[48:53] achieve the very purpose that love was
[48:55] projected for amen amen showing us that
[48:58] love has
[48:59] a
[49:00] purpose
[49:02] of course filial love i'm sorry
[49:06] yes filial love has a carnal purpose
[49:11] has a selfish purpose what i can get out
[49:14] of it if i do this if i do that then
[49:16] maybe you know i'll get something out of
[49:19] it
[49:20] but that is not divine love
[49:23] it's not the love of god
[49:25] amen one time the spirit led jesus to
[49:29] pass through jericho
[49:31] and i'll tell you what that was it was
[49:32] the love of god in jesus
[49:34] there was an unconverted man there his
[49:36] name was zacchaeus
[49:39] and he was a man that didn't have a good
[49:41] report
[49:43] he was rich
[49:44] but not all the riches came from fairly
[49:48] working and fairly trading
[49:50] he kind of took advantage of people
[49:53] took their money when he shouldn't have
[49:56] can you say man i mean knows the story
[49:59] amen the bible says that he was actually
[50:02] the chief
[50:04] among the publicans
[50:06] not a chief but the chief
[50:08] there was something more inside
[50:11] zacchaeus than curiosity when he wanted
[50:13] to see jesus
[50:15] i believe he was a predestinated seed
[50:19] but he was like a
[50:23] he climbed up into a sycamore tree to
[50:25] have a look at jesus when he went by and
[50:28] jesus being led by the spirit with a
[50:30] purpose when he walked he stopped when
[50:33] he got underneath that tree he looked up
[50:35] and said zacchaeus make haste and come
[50:37] down for today i must abide at the house
[50:43] wow
[50:45] oh my
[50:47] that's god working on both ends
[50:50] zacchaeus made hayes came down and
[50:52] received him joyfully the bible says
[50:55] love without respect of persons was
[50:58] being projected right amen but when all
[51:02] the people saw the bible says that they
[51:04] all murmured
[51:07] that jesus was going to be a guest with
[51:09] a man that was a sinner
[51:14] how many times have we judged somebody
[51:20] but something was happening in zachus's
[51:23] heart
[51:24] it was the goodness of god that was
[51:26] leading him to repentance
[51:28] amen that's what was happening the
[51:30] people didn't see it
[51:32] the purpose of love projected watch
[51:35] sovereign grace take over
[51:37] amen
[51:39] in that awesome presence of jehovah the
[51:42] prince of peace if i could say it like
[51:44] that in zacchaeus heart was being mended
[51:46] back to god
[51:48] because he was with them at the
[51:49] beginning
[51:51] we all were we were in god's thoughts
[51:54] before the foundation of the world
[51:59] he stood there
[52:00] and said unto jesus
[52:02] behold lord
[52:04] the half
[52:06] of my goods i give to the poor
[52:09] and if i have taken anything from any
[52:12] man by false occasion
[52:15] i restore him
[52:17] fourfold
[52:20] that was the goodness of god
[52:24] love was projected and you know what
[52:28] sovereign grace took over and love was
[52:30] responding i love him zacchaeus could
[52:33] say i love him because he first loved me
[52:36] and jesus said unto him this day is
[52:39] salvation come into this house for as
[52:42] much as he also is the son of abraham
[52:44] for the son of man has come to seek and
[52:46] to save that which was lost love was
[52:50] being projected
[52:51] amen
[52:53] love has a purpose
[52:56] there's a motive behind it for god so
[52:59] loved the world that he came in the form
[53:01] of the son of man to seek out and save
[53:04] that which was lost
[53:06] love was at work
[53:08] amen
[53:13] love has to go to work
[53:16] calvary had to take place
[53:20] love
[53:21] doesn't just sit around and fellowship
[53:24] right it's true no sir
[53:27] it has a more important agenda than that
[53:31] today i say is still seeking out that
[53:33] which was lost
[53:36] amen love isn't always easy
[53:39] turn with me if you would isaiah 53
[53:43] the bible says who have believed our
[53:45] report
[53:46] and to whom
[53:48] is the arm of the lord revealed what a
[53:52] powerful question today brother ryan
[53:54] said the most important thing we could
[53:55] pray for is revelation
[53:59] now who have believed our report and to
[54:03] whom is the arm of the lord revealed
[54:06] boy there are so many depths of of
[54:08] belief and and revelation
[54:12] i think we just i'll tell you when god
[54:15] gives us a revelation
[54:17] it should just make us so humble
[54:20] so grateful so thankful
[54:23] but when the devil tells you a little
[54:26] truth
[54:26] it'll just puff you up
[54:29] brother brandon said in the message god
[54:31] hiding himself in simplicity then
[54:34] revealing himself in the same in 63 he
[54:36] said let me read it again closely he
[54:40] said who had believed our report and to
[54:42] whom is the arm of the lord revealed he
[54:45] said in other words if you have believed
[54:48] our report then the arm of the lord has
[54:52] been revealed
[54:54] why do you think the angel of the lord
[54:56] said to brother branham
[54:57] only believe i like that song only
[55:00] believe it's got to start with you
[55:02] standing up and i say i believe that
[55:05] word i believe what's being spoken and
[55:07] the god of revelation will come and he
[55:10] will reveal the whole thing to you
[55:13] amen
[55:14] god wants you to step out draw an eye to
[55:16] him and he'll draw an eye to you
[55:19] in the message the sixth seal brother
[55:21] brennaman said who have believed are
[55:22] reported to whom is the arm of the lord
[55:24] been revealed see he said believe the
[55:27] report then the arm of the lord is
[55:30] revealed the arm the word of god is
[55:34] revealed right now oh i love that
[55:37] the arm of the lord is the word
[55:41] first
[55:42] uh saint john chapter 1 verse 1 in the
[55:44] beginning was the word the word was
[55:46] the word and the word was god and the
[55:50] i'm sorry the word was with god and the
[55:53] word was god i want to read it just like
[55:56] it is
[55:57] in the beginning
[55:58] was the word in verse 14 says the word
[56:01] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[56:04] beheld the glory of the word the glory
[56:07] as of the only begotten of the father
[56:10] full of grace
[56:12] and truth
[56:14] jesus said in matthew 16 verse 17 he
[56:18] said flesh and blood have not revealed
[56:20] it unto thee but my father which is in
[56:23] heaven and upon this rock i'll build my
[56:26] church and the gates of hell shall not
[56:28] prevail against it amen you know i we
[56:31] should never
[56:32] be concerned
[56:34] about all the churches
[56:37] that are out there in the world
[56:40] honestly
[56:44] the whole church the whole world could
[56:45] be full of churches
[56:49] but the only church that god is truly
[56:52] interested in is the church that he is
[56:55] building
[56:57] and he builds his church
[57:00] by revelation amen
[57:02] in other words no man can lay a stone
[57:07] to it
[57:10] the bible does say the the the
[57:12] foundation was laid by the apostles and
[57:15] the prophets but it wasn't their word
[57:17] they were just speaking the word of god
[57:21] god holds
[57:23] and it holds back the revelation to whom
[57:26] he wants to give it to
[57:29] and he hides it from the wise and the
[57:31] prudent to think that they got it sold
[57:33] up in a bag
[57:35] but you know what he does he reveals it
[57:36] to babes
[57:38] babes
[57:40] those that that praise is perfected in
[57:43] that little group who's who's always
[57:45] needy who always recognizes
[57:48] their heavenly father is the one that
[57:50] supplies all their needs amen that's
[57:52] right god never meant for us to walk
[57:54] around acting like we got it all figured
[57:57] out and we got it all sold up and i got
[57:59] this walk all taken care of and that god
[58:02] is so much with me no he wants you to
[58:04] testify that though i'm weak he is
[58:06] strong he meets my knees i look to the
[58:09] hills for what cometh my hell my help
[58:12] cometh from the lord
[58:14] too often we get things uh
[58:17] messed up
[58:19] this rock that jesus talked upon
[58:22] this rock
[58:24] i will build my church
[58:26] that's the church i want to be in
[58:29] i want to be in that church that rock
[58:33] was not peter
[58:37] that rock was not
[58:39] jesus is the christ the son of the
[58:41] living god
[58:44] no sir
[58:46] the devils believe that
[58:48] they said have you come to tormundus
[58:50] you're the son of god have you come to
[58:52] torment us before well that's not where
[58:54] jesus was building his church
[58:58] now that rock is christ being revealed
[59:01] to you personally
[59:03] and you standing on it
[59:06] those demons weren't standing on it
[59:08] the knowledge is not the rock
[59:11] it's when god reveals it to you and you
[59:13] say yes lord it is mine i'm standing
[59:16] with you
[59:18] i'll tell you that has everything to do
[59:20] with your attitude
[59:27] may the lord bless us
[59:30] with
[59:30] understanding revelation today
[59:33] our dependency needs to be on christ not
[59:35] our intellect
[59:39] we need to pray for revelation
[59:42] we can't muster it up we
[59:44] we can't force it
[59:47] we can't make god do it all you can do
[59:50] is get as humble as you can as lord you
[59:53] can submit to the word he gives grace to
[59:55] the humble
[59:57] more grace to the humble
[59:59] but he resists the pride and i'll tell
[1:00:01] you let me just say this about pride
[1:00:03] every one of us in here deals with pride
[1:00:06] amen every one of us
[1:00:08] the problem is we don't look at the
[1:00:11] pride that we have we're always looking
[1:00:13] at somebody else's pride who's greater
[1:00:16] who's worse who's acting wrong and we're
[1:00:19] missing the pride that's keeping us from
[1:00:21] the revelation that god wants to give us
[1:00:26] let's look a little deeper into the
[1:00:28] boundaries of god's love here verse 2 of
[1:00:29] isaiah 53 for he shall grow up
[1:00:32] before him as a tender plan is the root
[1:00:35] out of the dry ground he have no form
[1:00:37] nor coming us and we we shall see him
[1:00:39] there's no beauty that we should desire
[1:00:41] him
[1:00:42] he didn't this love didn't look great
[1:00:44] from the outside like when we look at
[1:00:46] one another we say oh he's cute or she's
[1:00:49] pretty or he's a real man or she's a
[1:00:52] real woman but when you looked at jesus
[1:00:54] he didn't have any of that
[1:01:00] but look
[1:01:01] he's the man
[1:01:03] he was the man and he is the man and he
[1:01:06] will be the man
[1:01:09] amen
[1:01:10] he was you talk about now this is for
[1:01:13] god so loved the world that he gave
[1:01:15] right here he was despised and rejected
[1:01:19] of men
[1:01:20] a man of sorrows acquainted with greece
[1:01:23] and we all hid our faces from him
[1:01:26] we were ashamed
[1:01:28] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[1:01:32] i'll tell you love hurts
[1:01:36] surely he had borne our griefs and
[1:01:37] carried ourselves
[1:01:39] yet
[1:01:40] we did esteem him
[1:01:42] stricken smitten of god and afflicted
[1:01:47] kind of like job's
[1:01:49] friends
[1:01:50] job
[1:01:51] you must have done something wrong
[1:01:55] mm-hmm
[1:01:57] what they say to jesus hanging there on
[1:01:58] the cross
[1:02:00] well if god's with you why don't you
[1:02:01] just you know
[1:02:03] do
[1:02:04] something
[1:02:06] save save yourself save us
[1:02:09] just mocking
[1:02:11] not having any understanding on the love
[1:02:14] of god you know sometimes people don't
[1:02:16] know why you're laying down your life
[1:02:17] for them they think they're just taking
[1:02:20] advantage of you they don't know but you
[1:02:22] know what jesus said you don't take my
[1:02:24] life i lay it down and when you got a
[1:02:26] revelation of the love of god and you
[1:02:28] lay your heart down you know what you're
[1:02:29] doing you know what you're doing
[1:02:35] he was wounded
[1:02:37] for our transgressions he was bruised
[1:02:39] for our iniquities the chastisement of
[1:02:41] our peace was upon him and with his
[1:02:43] stripes we are healed love hurt for us
[1:02:49] love hurt for us if that doesn't make
[1:02:51] you feel indebted that you just want to
[1:02:53] yield your life and say thank you jesus
[1:02:56] praise you lord i love you more today
[1:02:59] remind me why do you think those nail
[1:03:02] prints are still going to be in his
[1:03:03] hands when we get on the other side
[1:03:06] he hurt for us
[1:03:09] that's where love is manifested when
[1:03:11] love gets hurt
[1:03:15] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[1:03:17] have turned everyone to his own ways
[1:03:20] the lord have laid upon him the iniquity
[1:03:23] of us all
[1:03:25] wow
[1:03:27] he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he
[1:03:29] opened not his mouth he was brought as
[1:03:31] the lamb to the slaughter and there's a
[1:03:33] sheep before the shears is dumb he
[1:03:36] so he opened not his mouth
[1:03:39] he could have said to any one of us
[1:03:43] called out our iniquity and our sin any
[1:03:45] day of the week
[1:03:47] but he opened not his mouth
[1:03:52] love was hurting for you and i am amen
[1:03:56] he was taken from the prisons in the
[1:03:58] judgment who shall declare his
[1:04:00] generation will you
[1:04:02] for he was cut off out of the land of
[1:04:04] the living for the transgressions of my
[1:04:06] people was he stritten he was made he
[1:04:08] made his grave with the wicked and and
[1:04:10] with the rich in his death because he
[1:04:12] had done no violence neither was any
[1:04:15] deceit in his mouth oh i love that
[1:04:18] what a challenge for you and i
[1:04:22] what a challenge for you and i
[1:04:24] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[1:04:28] to make him hurt and suffer
[1:04:32] and if
[1:04:32] he had put him to grief
[1:04:35] when thou shall make his soul an
[1:04:37] offering for you and me
[1:04:41] his soul became an offering for you and
[1:04:45] me
[1:04:47] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[1:04:49] his days and the pleasure of the lord
[1:04:52] shall prosper in
[1:04:54] his hand
[1:04:57] i'll tell you if it wasn't for the
[1:05:00] perfect
[1:05:00] lamb of god
[1:05:03] none of us would be here today
[1:05:06] and i'll tell you even being stuck in a
[1:05:08] church
[1:05:09] without
[1:05:11] god in it because if you read the book
[1:05:14] of revelations in this age
[1:05:16] speaking to the church as a whole
[1:05:20] they kicked jesus out a long time ago
[1:05:23] yes they're still having church but it's
[1:05:26] man having church
[1:05:28] it's a group of people it's it's
[1:05:30] entertainment it's it's fun it's it's
[1:05:33] delightful it's it's it's it's coffee
[1:05:36] and donuts and and you name it but i'll
[1:05:39] tell you
[1:05:40] give me that old-time religion give it
[1:05:42] to me the way that it was given to us by
[1:05:44] the apostles
[1:05:47] love isn't always easy
[1:05:50] if i could say it like this love still
[1:05:53] hurts
[1:05:54] god hurt for you and i
[1:05:56] he bore griefs he carried our sorrows
[1:06:00] just like you would for your children
[1:06:02] you bear the grief you you help them
[1:06:06] he was wounded for our transgression
[1:06:07] bruised for iniquities he was chastised
[1:06:10] for our peace and he was whipped
[1:06:13] for our healing
[1:06:15] so when you're desiring healing for your
[1:06:17] body
[1:06:19] i want you just to close your eyes and
[1:06:21] picture
[1:06:23] the stripes that he bore for what you're
[1:06:25] asking for
[1:06:29] he paid the price there's no other man
[1:06:33] that
[1:06:34] stood there and got whipped
[1:06:36] for you
[1:06:38] but when you can realize what god has
[1:06:40] done for you your face you better rise
[1:06:42] to the place to receive your healing
[1:06:46] he hurt for us
[1:06:48] god suffered blood and died
[1:06:51] tell me that love
[1:06:53] is not going to suffer
[1:06:56] it will suffer to bring a restoration
[1:06:59] we're taking a look not at just a
[1:07:02] history of god's love
[1:07:04] but we're trying to bring it home today
[1:07:07] love went to work at calvary
[1:07:10] he said at calvary it is finished
[1:07:15] calvary
[1:07:17] paid the price for our sin
[1:07:21] the work of paying the debt of sin was
[1:07:23] purchased and paid for at calvary but
[1:07:25] the responsibility of love is still
[1:07:29] moving forward
[1:07:30] it's still suffering it's still hurting
[1:07:33] it's still moving forward
[1:07:35] paul said it like this all that i might
[1:07:37] know him in the power of his
[1:07:39] resurrection and in the fellowship of
[1:07:41] his sufferings
[1:07:43] it's still suffering today
[1:07:46] even after calvary
[1:07:48] god has still had to turn his head
[1:07:51] away
[1:07:52] from us
[1:07:54] when there's things that we've done that
[1:07:56] we shouldn't have done
[1:07:59] things we've said we shouldn't have said
[1:08:02] things we looked at that we shouldn't
[1:08:03] have looked at
[1:08:05] things that we thought that we shouldn't
[1:08:06] have been thinking
[1:08:09] god has still had to turn his head
[1:08:13] it brings a pain to god
[1:08:16] when we don't care enough
[1:08:18] to keep our vessel under subjection
[1:08:22] love still hurts friends
[1:08:25] we still move god
[1:08:28] one way or the other we move god amen
[1:08:31] how many times has god been long
[1:08:32] suffering towards
[1:08:36] us many
[1:08:39] how often has he waited patiently for us
[1:08:43] how lazy we've been how unconcerned and
[1:08:46] uncaring at times
[1:08:48] and you think god hasn't hurt because of
[1:08:51] us
[1:08:53] love still hurts brother and sister
[1:08:56] but i'll say it like this love
[1:08:59] has
[1:09:00] the love of god is so strong
[1:09:02] that it has a purpose that it will
[1:09:05] withstand endure all things
[1:09:10] because it has its subject in mind its
[1:09:14] purpose in mind the song goes how
[1:09:17] measureless and strong it shall
[1:09:19] forevermore enter the saints and angels
[1:09:21] song
[1:09:23] when love is projected sovereign grace
[1:09:26] will take over and meet what love has
[1:09:29] projected for
[1:09:30] patiently projected
[1:09:33] projected endured law endured for
[1:09:38] it's all because love has a purpose to
[1:09:41] seek and save that which is lost
[1:09:45] now it isn't just about oh yeah i
[1:09:48] repented and i got baptized and i'm
[1:09:51] saved
[1:09:58] i hope i'm not misunderstood but i
[1:10:00] probably will be
[1:10:01] because love is misunderstood but i'm so
[1:10:03] against that
[1:10:08] every day
[1:10:09] is the day of salvation
[1:10:11] and a day is not going to go by where
[1:10:13] god is not going to speak to you and
[1:10:15] call you up higher
[1:10:18] because love is always growing and we've
[1:10:20] been predestined to come into his image
[1:10:24] and we need to be interested in the
[1:10:27] image
[1:10:28] the full image of christ
[1:10:30] we haven't been predestined to be saved
[1:10:34] alone
[1:10:38] we need to have a full understanding of
[1:10:41] what we're being called to and that's
[1:10:43] why the word of god should move us
[1:10:46] it should prick our hearts
[1:10:48] it should cause us to come higher with
[1:10:50] god
[1:10:52] i'll say like this love cannot rest
[1:10:55] until it has seen its last predestinated
[1:10:58] seed saved
[1:11:00] and i'll tell you
[1:11:02] those that are going in the rapture love
[1:11:04] will not rest until they're ready
[1:11:07] until they're ready
[1:11:10] because she has to make herself ready
[1:11:13] we're not going in the rapture because
[1:11:14] my name is john martin
[1:11:16] because we're in the message because we
[1:11:18] belong to a church because fill in the
[1:11:20] blank it's when you become a manifested
[1:11:23] adopted son and daughter of god that
[1:11:25] that god has put you through the test
[1:11:27] and you now are living the life that god
[1:11:30] has ordained you to live amen
[1:11:34] and i'll say it like this i say it with
[1:11:37] the fear of god
[1:11:39] don't
[1:11:40] don't think that you're there
[1:11:51] you don't want to take my word for it
[1:11:52] now i'm okay with that i don't ever want
[1:11:54] you to take my word
[1:11:56] i'm not bringing my word by the way
[1:11:58] and i know you'll take paul's word paul
[1:12:00] said
[1:12:02] i'll press towards that mark
[1:12:05] here is a man that we have so much
[1:12:06] confidence that we read his word
[1:12:09] 14 books we have confidence in it but
[1:12:12] you know his attitude was never
[1:12:17] i've attained
[1:12:19] been there you got a little ways to go
[1:12:21] before you catch up to me
[1:12:24] i've apprehended i got it right here
[1:12:27] no
[1:12:28] no he wasn't like that
[1:12:30] he was a man that was still pressing god
[1:12:32] do you wanna know why he wanted to know
[1:12:34] god so bad brother mark he wanted to
[1:12:36] know god so bad that god was revealing
[1:12:39] himself daily to him the revelations
[1:12:41] were so great
[1:12:45] and every time god was showing oh i want
[1:12:47] to be like that i want to manifest that
[1:12:50] he gave his life to god and god took
[1:12:52] that life and he used him as a as a
[1:12:55] potter had the clay in his hands and
[1:12:57] molded him into a vessel that he could
[1:13:00] bring the gospel to many people and save
[1:13:03] many people amen amen
[1:13:10] love is still working
[1:13:13] it's still hurting
[1:13:15] how many can testify that
[1:13:18] it can be very difficult for us when
[1:13:20] we're dealing with people
[1:13:22] all the hardships we go through
[1:13:26] all the rejections and the persecutions
[1:13:28] all the backbiting
[1:13:32] murmuring we're trying to help them
[1:13:34] complain
[1:13:37] love hurts today
[1:13:41] i'll say this love is not one-sided
[1:13:49] yes love is unconditional but it always
[1:13:51] has a purpose
[1:13:55] just because love possesses the power to
[1:13:58] love its enemies it doesn't love for
[1:14:01] kicks
[1:14:02] it doesn't love for show-off
[1:14:06] we can't stop others from using us
[1:14:09] and i'll say it like this nor do we want
[1:14:10] to
[1:14:12] that's not scriptural
[1:14:14] what scripture was pray for those that
[1:14:16] use you
[1:14:17] that's scripture
[1:14:19] because how are they going to see the
[1:14:21] love of god
[1:14:22] if you don't
[1:14:24] take the abuse remember brother brian
[1:14:27] says it's not the action towards you
[1:14:28] it's how you react
[1:14:33] by this example perfect love shall all
[1:14:35] men know you're my disciple
[1:14:38] not by how god used you
[1:14:41] not by what god's done in your life
[1:14:44] not by saying what you've attained
[1:14:47] oh my my brothers and sisters for us
[1:14:51] trying to impress one another
[1:14:53] while we're talking with one another i'm
[1:14:56] telling you
[1:14:57] it's time to grow up
[1:15:01] it's time to to prove
[1:15:03] in our test
[1:15:05] in our trials that the love of god is
[1:15:07] with us
[1:15:09] amen that we can still produce a life of
[1:15:12] christ behind closed doors
[1:15:15] amen
[1:15:18] but there's another side to love
[1:15:21] and that is love has a purpose
[1:15:24] to turn others to the truth
[1:15:27] a greater truth
[1:15:29] more truth till it gets to the place
[1:15:32] that when he the spirit of truth to come
[1:15:34] he will lead and guide you to what all
[1:15:37] truth don't be satisfied with part of
[1:15:40] god get a heart for all the truth
[1:15:42] because that's where god's heart is at
[1:15:45] get into the bible and read it get into
[1:15:47] the message and listen to it
[1:15:49] talk about it fellowship you want to be
[1:15:51] fellowship and fellowship around the
[1:15:53] word of god
[1:15:56] it will not stop laboring god the holy
[1:15:59] ghost will not stop laboring for us
[1:16:01] until he sees
[1:16:03] all the truth inside of us
[1:16:06] so why should we
[1:16:11] the bible says that paul endured a lot
[1:16:13] of hurt
[1:16:15] for god's elected bride
[1:16:19] paul didn't have some
[1:16:20] daddy old
[1:16:22] uh
[1:16:24] uh understanding
[1:16:27] about god's love
[1:16:28] that it
[1:16:31] just a false
[1:16:33] you know the bible says that we need to
[1:16:34] study
[1:16:35] to rightly divide the word of truth
[1:16:38] a lot of times we don't have a good
[1:16:39] understanding
[1:16:42] we
[1:16:43] the whole the bible brother brahm did
[1:16:45] say in the message he said
[1:16:47] the evidence of the holy ghost is having
[1:16:50] a correct understanding of the word of
[1:16:52] god and i believe that's what the holy
[1:16:55] ghost does it will lead you to know the
[1:16:57] word of god the way it was meant to
[1:17:03] but he didn't think that uh
[1:17:06] that all the elect of god are going to
[1:17:08] make it in just fine
[1:17:11] that you don't have to do nothing
[1:17:13] they're elected they're predestinated
[1:17:16] and everything's just going to be just
[1:17:17] fine just because they're elected
[1:17:23] no we have to endure things for the
[1:17:26] elect's sake
[1:17:28] you want scripture let's read it ii
[1:17:30] timothy chapter 2 verse 1 not belittling
[1:17:33] any scripture what i'm belittling is our
[1:17:36] attitude that we don't want to work like
[1:17:38] we need to work
[1:17:41] second timothy 2 1 thou therefore my son
[1:17:45] be strong in the grace that is in christ
[1:17:47] jesus
[1:17:48] and the things that thou has heard of me
[1:17:50] among many witnesses the same thou
[1:17:53] commit
[1:17:54] uh to faithful men who should be able to
[1:17:56] teach others i wonder today
[1:17:58] how many here
[1:18:00] wants to be one of these men
[1:18:03] amen
[1:18:05] how many wants to be a faithful witness
[1:18:08] for jesus christ
[1:18:12] okay we're getting instructions from
[1:18:13] paul pretend you're timothy
[1:18:17] and paul is telling you
[1:18:20] that you need to
[1:18:22] the things that that you've heard you've
[1:18:24] learned from them you've been a witness
[1:18:26] of now you to take this same word and
[1:18:29] and teach it to others who will teach it
[1:18:32] to others
[1:18:34] that's a responsibility right there
[1:18:37] i'd rather have somebody try to tell me
[1:18:40] how to
[1:18:42] how to help myself
[1:18:45] get closer to god
[1:18:49] that when they see something wrong that
[1:18:50] they'll actually come over and help me
[1:18:53] get me on the right track
[1:18:57] now therefore what's the first thing
[1:18:59] thou therefore endure hardness
[1:19:03] love has to be strong
[1:19:06] as a good soldier jesus christ no man
[1:19:08] warth entangleth himself with the
[1:19:10] affairs of this life that he may please
[1:19:12] him have chosen us to be a soldier so we
[1:19:15] need to step away from the world the
[1:19:18] things of the world
[1:19:22] you can't do both
[1:19:24] don't get entangled
[1:19:26] and if a man also strive for the
[1:19:28] masteries yet he's not crowned except he
[1:19:31] strive lawfully
[1:19:34] you gotta you gotta do the right thing
[1:19:38] the husbandman that laboreth must be
[1:19:40] first partakers of the fruits consider
[1:19:44] what i say in the lord give the
[1:19:46] understanding in all things how many
[1:19:48] wants this understanding how many wants
[1:19:50] to do how many is willing to be a
[1:19:52] partaker of the fruit
[1:19:55] not easy
[1:19:56] remember that jesus christ of the seed
[1:19:59] of david was raised from the dead
[1:20:01] according to my gospel wherein this
[1:20:03] gospel that we're talking about i suffer
[1:20:06] trouble as an evil dealer can you
[1:20:08] believe it i'm suffering trouble as an
[1:20:10] evil doer even when i'm in prison
[1:20:16] but the word of god
[1:20:18] is not bound
[1:20:21] in other words the word of god is just
[1:20:23] as much alive in your home in your car
[1:20:26] in your prison situation as anywhere
[1:20:29] because the word of god is not bound
[1:20:33] therefore i endure all things
[1:20:41] see love has a vision it has a purpose
[1:20:45] it will lay down its life for the elect
[1:20:50] it has a job to do it has to endure a
[1:20:53] whole lot
[1:20:55] that they may also
[1:20:57] obtain the salvation which is in christ
[1:21:00] jesus with eternal glory it is a
[1:21:02] faithful saying for if we be dead with
[1:21:03] him we shall also live with him
[1:21:06] if we suffer
[1:21:09] we shall also reign with him
[1:21:13] wait a minute the way that i was taught
[1:21:15] that jesus suffered for me at calvary
[1:21:18] and now i don't have to suffer
[1:21:23] see how important it is to have the
[1:21:25] right understanding of the gospel
[1:21:29] because if we suffer we shall also reign
[1:21:31] with him but if we deny him how do we
[1:21:34] deny him we're unwilling to suffer
[1:21:39] unwilling to take the responsibilities
[1:21:44] he will also deny us it's awful quiet i
[1:21:46] wonder if somebody is
[1:21:48] feeling the holy ghost this morning
[1:21:52] amen i'm feeling it
[1:21:55] not that we go by feelings
[1:21:58] but you know i'll say it like we ought
[1:22:00] to have a hallelujah meeting
[1:22:02] i know if your favorite team was playing
[1:22:04] right now and they just scored you'd be
[1:22:06] you know you'd be a little louder
[1:22:11] turn with me to second corinthians
[1:22:12] chapter 11
[1:22:14] the love of god now we got so much more
[1:22:17] to go i'm just going to try to go
[1:22:19] through this quickly the love of god
[1:22:21] through paul suffered many things for
[1:22:23] the elect's sake
[1:22:25] and the reason i'm bringing this is
[1:22:27] because
[1:22:28] he's he told timothy and timothy was
[1:22:31] supposed to teach others right and then
[1:22:33] others taught others and others taught
[1:22:34] others and others taught others and
[1:22:37] and others taught brother johnson and
[1:22:40] brother johnson taught me
[1:22:44] and we're still teaching
[1:22:46] amen
[1:22:48] amen
[1:22:51] verse 23 says are they ministers of
[1:22:53] christ speaking of others other churches
[1:22:55] and things
[1:22:57] he said i
[1:22:58] am
[1:22:59] more
[1:23:01] are they ministers i am more well that's
[1:23:04] pretty bold to say i don't really think
[1:23:06] it was
[1:23:07] the carnality
[1:23:09] man that was speaking
[1:23:12] he's bringing a point and he he showed
[1:23:14] how he's more of a minister not that he
[1:23:16] had more powerful messages he doesn't
[1:23:18] say anything in here about his powerful
[1:23:21] uh preaching
[1:23:23] in fact one place he said i didn't come
[1:23:24] to you with enticing words of man's
[1:23:26] wisdom
[1:23:29] no he's talking about the fruit
[1:23:33] that transpires through suffering
[1:23:36] he said in labor's more abundant in
[1:23:38] stripes above measure in prisons more
[1:23:40] frequent in debts often
[1:23:42] of the jews five times received i 40
[1:23:44] stripes
[1:23:46] i thought only jesus had to bear the
[1:23:48] stripes
[1:23:50] must jesus bear the cross alone
[1:23:53] and the whole world go free
[1:23:56] there's got to be someone who had
[1:23:58] counted in a privilege to suffer for a
[1:24:01] soul
[1:24:02] that's what was happening here
[1:24:04] love was being projected through paul
[1:24:08] thrice that was beat with rods once i
[1:24:10] was stoned
[1:24:11] suffered shipwreck
[1:24:12] in journeyings often in perils look at
[1:24:15] all the perils he even had pearls among
[1:24:17] false brethren
[1:24:20] in weariness and painfulness and
[1:24:22] watchings often hunger and thirst and
[1:24:23] fastings in the cold and naked it
[1:24:26] but those things which are beside those
[1:24:28] things which are without
[1:24:31] those things that are happening in the
[1:24:33] world around me as i'm going out and
[1:24:34] trying to bring the gospel
[1:24:38] that which cometh upon me daily the care
[1:24:41] of all the
[1:24:42] churches who is weak am i not weak who
[1:24:45] is offended i burn not if i must needs
[1:24:48] glory i will glory of the things which
[1:24:51] concern my infirmities
[1:24:58] you know here's
[1:24:59] most people complain about their
[1:25:01] problems
[1:25:04] but paul
[1:25:05] was glorying because that his problems
[1:25:07] were a direct result because love was
[1:25:11] being projected through him
[1:25:14] see love hurts
[1:25:16] it hurts today
[1:25:21] but it didn't
[1:25:22] bother
[1:25:24] paul think about that
[1:25:27] have you ever realized how many times
[1:25:29] paul had to exercise forgiveness
[1:25:31] long suffering and love
[1:25:35] the love was so strong that it can
[1:25:37] endure all things
[1:25:40] for the elect's sake
[1:25:42] i'm so thankful
[1:25:44] for paul
[1:25:46] so grateful for paul second corinthians
[1:25:49] chapter 12 verse 9 just one chapter over
[1:25:52] and he said unto me my grace is
[1:25:54] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[1:25:56] made perfect in weakness
[1:25:58] most gladly will i rather glory
[1:26:04] not my puffed upness
[1:26:06] what i think i'm great but in my
[1:26:09] infirmities
[1:26:10] that the power of christ may rest upon
[1:26:14] me because as soon as you bloat your
[1:26:16] goat christ is gone he takes his flight
[1:26:19] he goes sits up there and he waits till
[1:26:21] the right spirit gets on you
[1:26:24] he's not going to share his glory with
[1:26:26] the devil
[1:26:30] i'll say the key to becoming strong in
[1:26:32] christ is not to become a weak
[1:26:34] christian amen
[1:26:36] not becoming a weak believer
[1:26:38] no sir
[1:26:41] the key to spiritual strength is to
[1:26:44] become weak in how you look at yourself
[1:26:48] amen it's your dependency on christ
[1:26:54] he said therefore i take pleasure and
[1:26:56] infirmities i take pleasure and
[1:26:58] reproaches and necessities and
[1:26:59] persecutions and distresses for what
[1:27:03] there's a purpose
[1:27:05] for christ's sake for when i'm weak then
[1:27:08] i am strong
[1:27:09] in other words christ is able to use
[1:27:11] this body if i'm not trying to do what i
[1:27:13] want to do
[1:27:17] you know we all have agendas right it's
[1:27:19] true
[1:27:24] we all have agendas
[1:27:27] every one of us going to one another's
[1:27:28] house to visit has an agenda
[1:27:33] it may be just for food
[1:27:35] but you got an agenda
[1:27:39] paul had an agenda
[1:27:41] the love of god has an agenda
[1:27:46] the love of god in paul had a purpose to
[1:27:48] fulfill and nothing nothing was going to
[1:27:52] stand in his way
[1:27:54] first corinthians 9 19
[1:27:56] look at the attitude and the
[1:27:59] anybody can have this attitude right
[1:28:00] here for though i be free
[1:28:03] from all men god set me free he died for
[1:28:06] me at calvary i'm free
[1:28:08] for thou i be free from all men yet have
[1:28:12] i made
[1:28:13] myself
[1:28:14] a servant unto all
[1:28:17] what's the purpose brother john why
[1:28:19] would you do something crazy like that
[1:28:21] that i might gain
[1:28:23] the more
[1:28:28] no one else can make you a true servant
[1:28:31] coming to church don't make you a true
[1:28:33] servant
[1:28:35] hearing the true word of god don't make
[1:28:37] you a true servant
[1:28:41] giving money don't make you a true
[1:28:42] servant
[1:28:44] but when you make a decision in your
[1:28:46] heart
[1:28:47] that at all costs i want to be a true
[1:28:49] servant
[1:28:51] and you mean it
[1:28:52] and every time the devil comes and he
[1:28:54] offers you an easier way
[1:28:57] a way that you don't have to be a
[1:28:58] servant and still be a christian you
[1:29:00] resist that spirit you rebuke that
[1:29:03] spirit
[1:29:04] you make a choice and then you keep
[1:29:06] making that choice every day you get up
[1:29:08] every day you deny yourself you deny
[1:29:11] yourself you deny your will you pick up
[1:29:14] your cross and you follow jesus and that
[1:29:16] is a true servant of god
[1:29:22] you have to crucify that nature that
[1:29:24] wants to be served
[1:29:28] and make yourself a servant
[1:29:30] unto all
[1:29:32] i love paul's motive do you know love
[1:29:35] always has the right motive
[1:29:38] love always has the right mode and i'm
[1:29:41] speaking of divine love
[1:29:43] amen i'm not
[1:29:45] agape divine love always has the right
[1:29:48] motive it's that uh that love that comes
[1:29:51] in and tricks you
[1:29:54] that mixed mode of love that filial love
[1:29:58] that wants you to
[1:30:00] mix your motive in and try to get
[1:30:02] something
[1:30:03] when you're doing something for god
[1:30:07] stay away from it
[1:30:09] come on it's time he that have this hope
[1:30:12] amen that we're going to be like christ
[1:30:14] one day he that had this whole he
[1:30:16] purifies himself even as he's pure so we
[1:30:18] got a job to do amen
[1:30:21] look at verse 22 i just love this mode
[1:30:23] of here
[1:30:25] he said in verse 22 i am made all things
[1:30:28] to all men
[1:30:30] that i might by all means
[1:30:32] save some
[1:30:34] it's like the same purpose jesus christ
[1:30:37] had
[1:30:38] he came to seek and save that which was
[1:30:41] lost
[1:30:42] in the message the mighty conqueror
[1:30:44] brother branham said
[1:30:46] and the strongest force that i know of
[1:30:49] he said is love
[1:30:54] though i speak with the tongues of men
[1:30:56] and angels and have not love i am
[1:30:58] nothing or become as a sounding brass
[1:31:00] and tinkling symbols though i have the
[1:31:02] power to move mountains and have not
[1:31:04] love i am nothing
[1:31:06] he quotes
[1:31:08] that's what each individual of the
[1:31:09] church ought to purpose in their heart
[1:31:14] to purpose in their hearts amen
[1:31:17] to do their very best for the kingdom of
[1:31:19] god
[1:31:21] and how
[1:31:22] do you serve god question
[1:31:25] when you're serving one another
[1:31:29] when you're taking care of the little
[1:31:31] end of the horn
[1:31:33] as it was to say
[1:31:35] and men who has ever ever amounted to
[1:31:38] very much in the world has been men
[1:31:41] who's come down and become not great men
[1:31:44] they made themselves small in order to
[1:31:48] accomplish
[1:31:49] a purpose
[1:31:51] a purpose
[1:31:54] see divine love of god has an eternal
[1:31:58] purpose always in its mind
[1:32:02] if we're just operating with fetal love
[1:32:04] then our motives are going to be mixed
[1:32:08] we're trying to get some personal gain
[1:32:10] while working for god
[1:32:13] you can smell it
[1:32:15] a mile away coming
[1:32:19] i wish there was a a lot of hallelujahs
[1:32:23] you know you can't fool god amen
[1:32:26] you can't fool the holy ghost
[1:32:30] in the message do you now believe
[1:32:31] brother branham said the mightiest force
[1:32:34] there is on earth is love that's exactly
[1:32:36] there's nothing that will break down
[1:32:38] love no matter what it is
[1:32:41] the love is the strongest force nothing
[1:32:44] can break it down think about that you
[1:32:46] get so in love with god that nothing
[1:32:47] shakes you
[1:32:49] nothing moves you
[1:32:51] nothing takes you away from being
[1:32:53] faithful to the house of god nothing
[1:32:55] takes you away from digging into the
[1:32:57] message of the hour nothing takes you
[1:32:59] away from the word of god man shall not
[1:33:01] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:33:03] that proceedeth out of the mouth and
[1:33:05] what is it it is the love of god if you
[1:33:07] love me keep my commandments
[1:33:11] in the message the statue of a perfect
[1:33:13] man brother man says so when you
[1:33:15] surrender your complete being
[1:33:18] then the holy spirit just pours through
[1:33:20] you
[1:33:22] in these virtues
[1:33:25] then you're a living tabernacle
[1:33:30] then the people look out and they say
[1:33:32] that's a man full of virtue
[1:33:35] knowledge
[1:33:36] he believes the word temperance patience
[1:33:38] godliness brotherly kindness full of the
[1:33:41] love of the holy ghost
[1:33:43] see
[1:33:44] there he is
[1:33:45] he's walking around
[1:33:49] not
[1:33:51] the pulpit
[1:33:54] he's walking around you and i ought to
[1:33:57] be seeing one another
[1:34:00] walking in these virtues
[1:34:02] now it's kind of hard
[1:34:04] to show you long-suffering
[1:34:07] if we're just
[1:34:08] shaking hands and saying i love you i
[1:34:11] love you god bless you we're good we're
[1:34:13] good we're one yes
[1:34:15] it's really hard to see the fruit of the
[1:34:18] spirit there you see the fruit of the
[1:34:20] spirit when you're down in the dumps
[1:34:23] when you've been rejected
[1:34:25] when you've been slapped at and kicked
[1:34:28] at and used and abused and they still
[1:34:30] asked you to do something for him that's
[1:34:32] when the love of god swells up in your
[1:34:34] heart and it manifests to the world that
[1:34:36] you're one of them
[1:34:41] is that your desire amen he said what is
[1:34:44] it
[1:34:45] he said a statue that unbelievers can
[1:34:48] look at and say there's a christian
[1:34:50] there's a a man or a woman who knows
[1:34:52] what they're talking about
[1:34:54] you never seen a kinder sweeter
[1:34:57] godlier person
[1:34:59] he says you're sealed a seal shows on
[1:35:01] both sides a seal shows on both sides
[1:35:06] you don't even need to say i'm sealed
[1:35:11] why
[1:35:12] because it shows on the outside
[1:35:15] if you have to spend time proving
[1:35:17] something to somebody you may want to
[1:35:19] get back on your knees and know you
[1:35:21] don't got to prove anything to anybody
[1:35:24] a real seal shows on both sides whether
[1:35:27] you're going or coming you see the seal
[1:35:30] just the same there you are when a man
[1:35:32] or woman possesses this then the
[1:35:35] capstone
[1:35:36] amen perfect love
[1:35:38] comes down and seals them into the
[1:35:42] kingdom of god which is the holy ghost
[1:35:53] love hurts
[1:35:55] love gets hurt
[1:35:57] so it has to be strong enough to endure
[1:36:00] the pain
[1:36:01] that it's going to in order to reach
[1:36:03] this objective how many times have you
[1:36:05] tried to do something for somebody i'm
[1:36:07] going to do this thing i'm going to do
[1:36:08] this and you go to do it
[1:36:11] and they don't even seem to be thankful
[1:36:15] or they they they had this attitude like
[1:36:17] well you should have you owe me this
[1:36:20] i deserve this
[1:36:24] and if you yield to that thing
[1:36:27] you'll stop helping them
[1:36:30] you'll say
[1:36:34] shake the dust off my feet and walk away
[1:36:36] from them
[1:36:39] but you know you'll never meet your
[1:36:41] objective
[1:36:44] if you stop
[1:36:47] don't stop love doesn't stop
[1:36:49] it bears all things it endures all
[1:36:52] things it hopes all things
[1:36:55] it it'll it'll go to the end because
[1:36:57] because charity never fails
[1:37:01] it will reach its objective
[1:37:05] its objective
[1:37:06] is always to bring a person to a higher
[1:37:09] truth yes if they're unsafe they got to
[1:37:10] get saved if they're safe they got to
[1:37:12] get into a higher truth well it's not as
[1:37:14] important to who to you
[1:37:16] to you
[1:37:18] this is why we must always have a burden
[1:37:20] one for another to pray one for another
[1:37:22] to care about one another to see one
[1:37:24] another coming up higher in christ
[1:37:27] don't be satisfied with just dropping
[1:37:29] into a church and being and being in the
[1:37:32] message right that's complacency that's
[1:37:35] laodicea right here
[1:37:39] just because we came out of lao to see
[1:37:41] it doesn't mean that spirit ain't
[1:37:43] trying to creep into our lives
[1:37:47] how many wants more love
[1:37:49] all right romans 5 verse 5 says the love
[1:37:52] of god is shed abroad in our heart
[1:37:55] by the holy ghost
[1:37:59] which is given unto us
[1:38:05] you can't separate god in love
[1:38:09] and to want god's love without wanting
[1:38:12] god's holiness god's righteousness
[1:38:16] keeping his commandments
[1:38:18] pleasing the lord
[1:38:20] god is not one-sided
[1:38:22] this is a chance for us
[1:38:25] to get all of god amen
[1:38:29] the problem with believers who feel they
[1:38:31] have
[1:38:34] the holy ghost all the time
[1:38:36] is they're never pressing in for more
[1:38:41] i'm not taking away the holy ghost that
[1:38:42] we have
[1:38:44] but if that seems to be our badge all
[1:38:46] the time
[1:38:48] i got it i got it i got it
[1:38:50] we're not going to be looking for more
[1:38:55] will the holy ghost be looking for
[1:38:56] vainglory
[1:38:59] look at me
[1:39:00] in its conversation look at me
[1:39:03] no
[1:39:05] it won't it's not going to share its
[1:39:06] glory with any man
[1:39:09] will the holy ghost be looking to build
[1:39:11] some man's reputation
[1:39:14] no
[1:39:15] there needs to be more amens i'm telling
[1:39:17] you
[1:39:19] if i have to make every one of you come
[1:39:20] stand go across the early
[1:39:25] christ made himself of no refutation
[1:39:27] what do you think he's going to do and
[1:39:28] let yours become great
[1:39:31] don't do it galatians chapter 5 verse 22
[1:39:34] but the fruit of the spirit now
[1:39:37] is love
[1:39:42] it's joy peace on suffering generals
[1:39:44] goodness faith meekness temperance
[1:39:46] against such there is no law now faith
[1:39:48] is great faith is great
[1:39:51] christ dwells in our heart by faith
[1:39:54] but you could have faith to remove
[1:39:55] mountains and have not love
[1:39:58] we're still nothing
[1:40:01] so we want to put it in its place amen
[1:40:03] the emphasis needs to be the love of god
[1:40:07] will take you through
[1:40:08] and still you will lay down your life to
[1:40:10] help somebody
[1:40:12] keep the focus on the objective of love
[1:40:16] and the bible says verse 24 and they
[1:40:19] that are christ what have they done they
[1:40:22] that belong to the holy ghost they've
[1:40:25] submitted
[1:40:26] they have crucified the flesh with the
[1:40:29] affections and the lust now this is not
[1:40:31] a one-shot deal because jesus told us we
[1:40:33] had to do it
[1:40:34] daily amen
[1:40:36] if we live in the spirit let us also
[1:40:38] walk in the spirit and let us not what
[1:40:41] have a desire
[1:40:45] of
[1:40:46] getting attention
[1:40:49] of and because it's just called
[1:40:51] vainglory
[1:40:52] there's not even desire to provoke one
[1:40:55] another that i'm i'm better than you i
[1:40:57] know more than you
[1:41:00] or envying one another
[1:41:02] i wish i was
[1:41:04] get away from that
[1:41:06] the only desire you should have is to be
[1:41:08] like christ
[1:41:11] paul did not like it when you
[1:41:13] when if we if men followed him
[1:41:17] he had strict restrictions on that
[1:41:20] he said you only follow me as i follow
[1:41:22] christ
[1:41:24] if i decide to preach any other gospel
[1:41:26] than what i preach
[1:41:28] let me be a curse
[1:41:31] don't even listen to me don't follow me
[1:41:33] no more
[1:41:35] love
[1:41:37] will get hurt
[1:41:39] and love
[1:41:40] will hurt you
[1:41:43] jesus said in revelations 3 verse 19 as
[1:41:46] many as i love i rebuke and chase and
[1:41:49] hummy's ever been rebuked before
[1:41:52] homie's not participating in this
[1:42:01] i'll tell you
[1:42:02] a lot of times
[1:42:05] a rebuke hurts
[1:42:09] when you get chastised it hurts let me
[1:42:10] ask these kids have you ever been
[1:42:12] spanked before
[1:42:14] did you jump up and down and say yeah
[1:42:18] no
[1:42:19] because it hurts
[1:42:22] it hurts
[1:42:24] but daddy and mama wants you to be
[1:42:27] better
[1:42:29] god wants us to be better
[1:42:34] and so the answer
[1:42:36] to that is just simply repent
[1:42:39] and to be zealous about it to be excited
[1:42:42] about it lord i want to get back on the
[1:42:44] right track
[1:42:45] don't sit there and try to defend your
[1:42:47] reputation
[1:42:51] god is calling us to his image
[1:42:54] now time is running so i'm just going to
[1:42:56] give you scriptures to read when you get
[1:42:58] time
[1:43:00] because
[1:43:02] there's lots hebrews chapter 12 verse 1
[1:43:04] through 15.
[1:43:07] what a wonderful chapter god does not
[1:43:09] want us
[1:43:11] to despise his chastening
[1:43:14] because every everyone gets it amen amen
[1:43:18] and then
[1:43:19] ephesians chapter 6 verses 10
[1:43:22] through 18 god wants us to be strong in
[1:43:24] the lord and to put on the whole armor
[1:43:26] of god
[1:43:28] love gets hurt and we have to be strong
[1:43:33] love hurts when we have to forsake our
[1:43:36] family
[1:43:38] our friends
[1:43:39] our brothers our sisters our mother and
[1:43:41] our father
[1:43:42] because that's what jesus said
[1:43:44] if we don't put god first
[1:43:48] i remember my
[1:43:50] i had kicked out some things out of my
[1:43:52] house when i was younger
[1:43:54] and my dad came
[1:43:56] to visit me
[1:43:59] and he said
[1:44:03] i don't understand why you're taking
[1:44:04] away that tv from your kids
[1:44:08] you got to have a tv when you were
[1:44:10] raised
[1:44:12] i couldn't deny it
[1:44:14] but nobody taught me any better
[1:44:17] so i had one of those things in my
[1:44:19] bedroom
[1:44:22] i got to enjoy whatever i wanted
[1:44:25] but when i came to the truth
[1:44:28] i realized it wasn't the most edifying
[1:44:31] thing for my children
[1:44:37] love hurts
[1:44:40] and the devil's still going to come
[1:44:42] and try to get you
[1:44:44] to compromise
[1:44:46] that's why i shared that story
[1:44:48] you're gonna have to make a decision
[1:44:51] i love god
[1:44:53] more than i love
[1:44:54] fill in the blank
[1:44:58] it hurts to give up the world the things
[1:44:59] of the world it does there's pleasure in
[1:45:02] sin
[1:45:03] come on now
[1:45:05] love hurts when you're persecuted you're
[1:45:07] forsaken or you're lied to or used
[1:45:14] especially to those that you love and
[1:45:16] you respect
[1:45:18] love hurts
[1:45:20] but the neat thing about love is it's
[1:45:22] long suffering
[1:45:25] it'll go through that
[1:45:27] it keeps its eyes
[1:45:29] on the end result
[1:45:32] don't be wishy-washy don't let feelings
[1:45:35] and emotions and drama come in your life
[1:45:39] stay focused
[1:45:41] god's taking me through
[1:45:43] i'm gonna be in his damage i'm not gonna
[1:45:45] let anything stand in my way
[1:45:48] all right read first corinthians 13
[1:45:51] chapter
[1:45:52] or chapter 13 verses 1 through 13.
[1:45:56] the love chapter that's such a beautiful
[1:45:58] because god is calling us to maturity
[1:46:01] amen
[1:46:02] not to love
[1:46:03] carnally anymore but to love
[1:46:06] as a son and daughter of god
[1:46:09] i just want to read
[1:46:11] two more sets of scriptures is that okay
[1:46:13] you be patient with me
[1:46:16] you're not going to see me for a while
[1:46:17] after this
[1:46:19] responsibility is on the other person
[1:46:21] that's up here
[1:46:23] john chapter 13 verse 33 little children
[1:46:28] yet a little while i'm with you
[1:46:30] you shall seek me
[1:46:32] as i said unto the jews whether i go you
[1:46:34] cannot come so now i say to you
[1:46:37] a new commandment i give unto you
[1:46:40] that you love one another
[1:46:43] as i have loved you
[1:46:45] don't try to love one another
[1:46:48] with your interpretation
[1:46:52] it has limits
[1:46:55] go the limitless way
[1:46:57] how many likes uh
[1:46:58] having a cell phone with luminous
[1:47:02] minutes
[1:47:04] right tax all you want talk all you want
[1:47:08] who wants to pay a hundred dollars for
[1:47:11] just 10 minutes of talking
[1:47:14] right
[1:47:16] god don't want just us to be limited
[1:47:19] he wants us to be limited less limitless
[1:47:23] in love
[1:47:26] you know i'm so thankful that you know
[1:47:28] what i'm saying even if i don't have the
[1:47:30] ability to say it right
[1:47:33] a new commandment i give you that you
[1:47:35] love one another as i have loved you
[1:47:37] that ye love one another
[1:47:40] do not love one another the way they're
[1:47:42] loving you
[1:47:45] step it up
[1:47:47] look for them to cross you look for them
[1:47:49] to say something negative
[1:47:51] to turn the oh i don't want to talk down
[1:47:53] i don't want to
[1:47:55] shine for jesus
[1:47:58] by this shall all men know that you're
[1:48:00] my disciples if you have
[1:48:02] love one for another remember jesus
[1:48:06] he was the one that should have got his
[1:48:08] feet washed but he was washing everybody
[1:48:09] else's
[1:48:11] romans chapter 8 verse 35 just going to
[1:48:13] read end with this chapter here
[1:48:16] romans 8 verse 35 who shall separate us
[1:48:18] from the love of christ
[1:48:21] shall tribulation
[1:48:23] i don't think so
[1:48:25] distress
[1:48:27] persecution famine nakedness peril or
[1:48:30] sword
[1:48:32] money
[1:48:34] my job
[1:48:36] my husband
[1:48:37] my wife
[1:48:39] my kids
[1:48:40] my neighbor
[1:48:42] some brother church some sister at
[1:48:44] church
[1:48:51] love hurts but it shall forevermore
[1:48:53] endure
[1:48:54] as it is written for thy sake for our
[1:48:57] sake we're killed all the day long
[1:49:01] we are counted as sheep for the
[1:49:02] slaughter
[1:49:05] it's okay
[1:49:07] we know what's coming
[1:49:10] but we're going to be strong in the lord
[1:49:12] and the power of his night nay and all
[1:49:14] these things were more than conquerors
[1:49:16] through him that loved us
[1:49:18] for i am persuaded that neither death
[1:49:20] nor alive nor angels or principality nor
[1:49:23] powers nor things present nor things
[1:49:24] that come
[1:49:26] nor height nor death nor any other
[1:49:28] creature
[1:49:30] shall be able to separate us
[1:49:32] oh i love that
[1:49:34] from the love of god
[1:49:36] which is in christ jesus our lord god
[1:49:38] bless you let's stand together
[1:49:40] love will get hurt
[1:49:42] and the love of god inside of you will
[1:49:45] end up hurting someone
[1:49:48] not purposely
[1:49:51] but you're trying to help that person
[1:49:53] and you may say something that they just
[1:49:56] feel i i don't want that
[1:50:01] i think of a number of times
[1:50:04] that people
[1:50:05] have spoken to me
[1:50:08] but it wasn't them it was god
[1:50:11] i think it was just this service right
[1:50:13] out here
[1:50:16] i was staying there and brother johnson
[1:50:17] was talking to someone
[1:50:19] as brother johnson was talking to
[1:50:21] someone
[1:50:22] god was speaking to me through brother
[1:50:24] johnson
[1:50:29] god knows what he's doing
[1:50:35] we want to take our lives place them in
[1:50:37] the hands of god and say god fill me
[1:50:39] with the love that will go all the way
