TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] by his grace i'll overcome [Music] [Music] amen by his strength i'll prevail by his strength i'll never fail by his reign how overcome by his grace [Music] amen amen by the blood of the lamb by his strength by his grace by his love by all that he has for us we need all that he has for us to overcome amen god bless each and every one of you what a great blessing it is that brother johnson with us um thank you for persevering and uh finding the the address to get here brother johnson i didn't get your message to about quarter to 10 this morning and i apologize for that left my phone at home um but it's an honor because brother johnson's our father in the lord i know that if it had not been for the lord to direct us to become established and to grow that i wouldn't be here for one and then how could i do anything for the lord so i'm just grateful for uh the scripture says upon every remembrance i give thanks for brother johnson amen and uh we're just to really appreciate him good to see brother bruce mr donna back this is their first time to be here and uh we're grateful that god watched over them and brought them safe amen well turn with me if you would to the book of nehemiah chapter 12 nehemiah chapter 12. that's uh after the chronicles between ezra and esther it's not a book we often read into we're going to start we're going to read two verses verse 27 verse 43 but before we do let's look to god in a word of prayer our gracious heavenly father we stand here in need of you lord unless you come and build the church they that labor labor in vain lord we need the great builder the great revealer lord you said upon this rock i'll build my church lord we pray that you'd come to the ministry of the word now and reveal yourself to us that we might become a stronger church stronger vessel for you a vessel that you could use for your honor and for your glory pray that you'd cleanse us from all sin from unbelief from all iniquity from all thoughts anything presumptuous anything lord that's been displeasing we just pray that the blood of christ would just cover us today amen lord come in and commune with us speak to our hearts and call us up higher help us to see lord what you're leading us to father we pray that you bless prepare our hearts now for this word we commit all of our needs and our lives into your hands receive glory now we pray in jesus christ's name we ask amen amen nehemiah chapter 12 verse number 27 and at the dedication of the law of jerusalem they sought the levites out of all their places to bring them to jerusalem to keep the dedication with gladness both with thanksgiving and with singing and with symbols and salt trees and with harps let's drop down to verse 43 also that day they offered great sacrifices and and rejoiced for god had made them rejoice with great joy the wives also and the children rejoice so that the joy of jerusalem was heard even afar off god bless you may be seated homie's been practicing trying to yield your vessel since wednesday think about that lucifer when he was made he was made perfect for the purpose for the greatest purpose that could have been given him which was to do the perfect will of god and he lowered himself to the lowest purpose that there is which was to serve himself here we were born with the purpose to serve ourself and through the process of regeneration and god conforming or transforming the way that we think to prove what is the good and perfect will of god that god is calling us to the highest purpose that we could have in our lives which is to do the will of god amen but it doesn't happen by coming to church coming to church does not manifest christ it doesn't automatically osmosis make us a christian we have to take the word that we hear and and apply it in between services and then it will become materialized in preparation for our church dedication coming up i want to speak on the subject rejoicing and entitled this message he has made me glad nehemiah had a burden for god's people and it led him to pray and to fast and to to mourn and to weep and god opened the door for him to to help build the people back up because they were broken and part of that rebuilding was to rebuild this wall nehemiah was instructed to rebuild a wall around jerusalem to to protect the people that's what it was for against any attacks of the enemy and it took less than two months to do it about 52 days and this to me was an amazing achievement but the greater achievement was the ability to stay focused in building the wall while overcoming all the scorning the laughing the mocking the despising and everything the enemy threw at them now say you try to do something for the lord and it becomes a lot harder than just doing the act because you have to withstand the enemy's attack against you to keep you from doing it he's thinking about the the timing of the dedication of this this service that they had the actual wall was completed in chapter seven and one would think that after the wall was done that you know you'd have the the dedication service at that time but they didn't the people were not ready for true dedication it took a revival of the people in chapters 8 and 10 8-10 for the people to be spiritually ready rushing a dedication service before the people would be ready would just be a waste it wouldn't glorify god but now in chapter 12 everyone was ready for the dedication everyone came to church the choirs the musicians the the priests they even took up an offering god had his people to to just walk around that wall as a great uh possession uh around and they were singing and they had dedicated the the the wall with gladness with with singing and they were just rejoicing they were prepared the wall was done the bible says that god had made them rejoice with great joy the wives also the children rejoiced it's a rejoicing time it was so great that the joy of jerusalem was heard even afar off praise the lord it's sad to say that many believers have lost their joy no one is hearing about their joy from afar off whether they say satan stole it or sin had gotten in the way and separated their fellowship with god they ended up missing their joy and oftentimes believers can become lazy when this happens in other words they just blame it on somebody they don't want to labor before the lord to get purified and to to to maybe deal with the little the little things that the little foxes that spell the vine as it were it's hard to be joyful when we're out of fellowship with god when we haven't maybe forgiven someone that done us wrong more and more believers are are lowering themselves to to try and just to survive with a it's true happiness like the world satan has brainwashed the world into thinking that we're to rejoice and to give thanks when we feel something is worthy of our rejoicing something's worthy of our thanksgiving like if there's a surprise birthday party a paid vacation or our team won or we win the lottery or some someone did something nice for us something special for us this is what the world would deem worthy of our rejoicing and our thanksgiving the whole world operates in this this vein of thought they're programmed to exercise this happiness only when their senses have declared something is worth rejoicing over something is worth giving thanks for the situation we don't want to confuse joy with being happy they're really not the same at all happiness is circumstance driven but joy is holy ghost driven it's god driven it's a it's a deep peace in christ the bible says god have made them rejoice with great joy there's nothing wrong with happiness but what we really need is joy so the world rejoices when they see and they feel things worthy of their thanksgiving but the believer doesn't operate with those senses come on now he operates by a different sense the sixth sense called faith he sees things in a different light it's a greater light they are shown to him by a different source he's able to rejoice when the world wouldn't think there's anything to rejoice about he's able to give thanks when the world wouldn't deem it a situation to give thanks and it's because god is the one that makes them glad on the inside they don't need the circumstances to be right they don't need their feelings and their emotions to declare a worthiness for them to express to thanksgiving they don't need to see situations with their own understanding to exercise a thankfulness god is the one that has made them glad their relationship with god is much deeper than circumstance driven it's not about our circumstances it's about us and god we must learn to walk and abide in the spirit of christ that's where we get joy it's in his presence the bible tells us in his presence is fullness of joy we don't want to try to lower ourselves to just try to be happy through outside circumstances and trying to tough it up and and trying to be a christian and put us a smile on all we need to do is get serious with god get in his presence die out to the flesh philippians chapter 4 verse 1 says therefore my dearly beloved and longed for he says my joy and crown so stand fast in the lord stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved i beseech eudius and beseech sinchi that they may be of the same mind in the lord i don't know if these are brothers or sisters but we all need to be of the same mind in the lord and i ain't treat the also true yok fellow help all right there it is those women which labored with me in the gospel with cl clement also and with other my fellow laborers whose names are in the book of light he says rejoice in the lord always and again i say rejoice always i don't know it's i don't know how many times you've used the word always but i'm pretty sure when you use it you mean it always always tell me the truth i always love you rejoice in the lord always and after you do that again i say rejoice send in a message to us let your moderation be made known unto all men that the lord is at hand notice we're not called to just be happy we're called to rejoice it's different and we're not called to just rejoice but we're called to rejoice always we want to get the full message rejoicing sets the atmosphere for god's presence in heaven we know there's rejoicing in hell there isn't think about this they're they're weeping they're gnashing of teeth there's torment we need to stay in an atmosphere in our minds and our thoughts in our church in our fellowship and rejoicing in the lord not looking at circumstances not looking at feelings and emotions but because we've spent time with god and inside of us he has made us glad rejoicing sets the atmosphere for god's presence to do amazing things look at the syrophoenician woman her circumstances she she had a need with a family member she just wanted god to move in the behalf of of healing but she was met not only with those terrible circumstances but she was met also with god not not finding favor with her request it's not meat it's not it's not kosher it's not in the in the in the process it's not in the in the way in fact you are viewed as just a dog but she did agree with the lord and because of that she didn't get all down and discouraged because of her circumstance she kept the right attitude and it brought the divine promise to pass amen rejoice in the lord always it doesn't matter what the word says to you doesn't matter how much god does not lie to us he tells us the truth we are just dogs by the grace of god we're saved by the grace of god we're his bride but we're nothing without him we are everything with him that's why we rejoice rejoice in the lord always and again i say rejoice word rejoice means to be glad to be full of cheer now you would think when you went to a football game or a baseball game or a hockey game or any kind of game and you would see the people uh that were cheering for their team full of cheer and glad you would think they would be rejoicing well they are in the world because of circumstances how often do you see the team rejoice when they lose and they do bad no you don't they start booing the quarterback the goalie not a christian just because something goes wrong no he's instructed to go help somebody amen to steam others better than themselves to wash feet if a righteous man falls seven times let's help him back up seven times somebody's done you wrong forgive him once twice three times let's go seven hey no let's not stop there let's go 490. it's that's the mind of christ and we're to rejoice doing it i wish not wasn't a christian you gotta do this the world is trying to be glad they're trying to be glad while leaving the lord out but you can't we don't want to be conformed to the world's way of rejoicing don't accept having to have circumstances right in your home with your job with your family with the bills that has nothing to do with rejoicing in the lord amen that's right you don't need evidence you have christ rejoice in the lord always he has made me glad not my bank account he has made me glad keep your eyes off your circumstances look to the lord for your joy he will keep the imperfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee for he had made them rejoice with great joy psalms 92 verse 4 for thou lord has made me glad amen for thou lord has made me glad through thy work not my circumstances through thy work i will triumph in the works of thy hands what's god doing this morning he's working on us we will rejoice that he's dealing with our heart and he's calling us up higher rejoice in the lord always and again i say rejoice you know we've gotten so far away from rejoicing that we forgot what it feels like remain glad everywhere at all times dwell in the state of god's joy don't settle for worldly happiness i'll tell you it's it's fun but it's so short-lived it's so short-lived i mean even sarcasm laughing about somebody something it's good for the moment but 60 seconds later you feel bad about it it's because you're not rejoicing in the lord amen doesn't the bible say that are rejoicing are rejoicing in that we sin james you're rejoicing is you're boasting you're rejoicing just don't rejoice in the world okay that's all i'm trying to say that's the point i'm trying to say paul writing this letter that we read here out of of philippians held to his conviction that he who had begun a good work in him that he was going to keep working on it keep working on it until jesus returned he was settled on it he didn't write this letter from a resort with white sandy beaches he wrote it from a prison cell and i'm sure the circumstances were really bad terrible circumstances but paul wasn't staring at the circumstances because he was made glad by god and that's why he could say rejoice in the lord always and again i say rejoice you know too often we're having a good time we're in a good mood we feel good and we're trying to hey what's wrong with everybody else some people have a hard time rejoicing when things aren't going the way they want them to go despite prison and being beaten and hated and persecuted used and abused and cast out such terrible circumstances but paul knew that everything was working out for his good that wasn't just a scripture to quote what you wanted it was real to him he committed himself to god's eternal purpose rejoice in the lord always because god makes us glad god has called us for a greater purpose than just the stuff that happens to us naturally our goals and our our desires and what we're plans are what we want to do and even our attempts to do something uh we save for the lord but it can be carnal paul wasn't the only one that had terrible circumstances look at the apostles in acts chapter 5 verse 40 and to him they agreed and when they called the apostles and beaten them and commanded them that they should not speak in the name of jesus and let them go they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing not talking about how bad they were but rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer for the shame suffer shame for his name see is a a a natural a human being that's walking carnally in the flesh oh this isn't worthy of my thanksgiving this is not worthy of my appreciation but they were in the presence of god because the presence of god was staying with them even though they were in the presence of the council the presence of god was still inside of them they weren't looking at what they were going to give them to rejoice in hey you got front row tickets no you got front row beatings it doesn't matter god greater is he that's in me then than he that's in the world how could a man be stoned like stephen the glory of god shining forth from him something inside of him saying father forgive them they don't know really what they're doing because there was something greater inside of him than outside circumstances saints we need to learn to get into this presence get our joy from the lord it's a real thing that verse 42 and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and to preach jesus christ it didn't stop them from spreading the word persecution shouldn't stop you from spreading the word apostles had a revelation of 8 romans 8 28. they were called for a greater purpose acts chapter 16 verse 22 you know i say like this the apostles they and paul they loved fulfilling the purpose of god that's why they didn't mind suffering why because they knew that eternal life was going to come forth from their labors somebody was going to get saved that is the eternal purpose of god acts chapter 16 verse 22 and the multitude rose up early against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them and cast him to the prison charging the jailer to keep them safely who having received such a charge thrust them to the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks but tell you these are some more terrible circumstances aren't they but look what happened at midnight there were two people filled with the holy ghost they prayed and they sang praises unto god why did they sing praises because god had made them glad you can look at your circumstances or you can look to the god inside amen and whatever you look at is whatever you're going to express that's why we got to keep our eyes on the promise amen no man the bible says that no man can take your joy away now you can forfeit it to worldly pleasures no man can take it jesus said in john chapter 16 verse 22 you know therefore i says you now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you now that's a promise of jesus christ you either stand on the promise or you call god's word a liar we all here should be filled with the joy of the lord amen the world will drain you circumstances will drain you but god is here to fill us up god is here to make us glad god is here to take us through but you know what is needed just a heart to believe the word that god is speaking directly to me most people want to sit in church and when they see eighty percent of the people say yes i got it now then they'll think seriously maybe i should try to get it seriously that's how we sit in church but god only needs one one man on fire one man to believe it won't you be the one to take god's word seriously amen won't you be the one to say god wants me to be filled with joy god wants me to be glad i receive that lord i receive it from you oftentimes when someone does this wrong our old worldly nature wants to just get back at them some way right just you'll be standoffish first thessalonians chapter 5 verse 15 as if someone stoled your joy because they did something to you shame on you shame on you god gives us something greater than that see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves here in the church and to all men out in the world rejoice ever more don't be picky choosy don't be picky choosy about what songs are song whether how the song service went how the preaching went as if that has anything to do with you and your relationship with god that ought to be stronger than anything you ought to be bringing a greater presence to the church to make it better amen rejoice evermore at all times rejoice don't be happy be joyful you're happy it'll stop i mean you can go to places and you know they'll just tell jokes and you'll laugh for an hour and when it's over you're over but spend an hour in the presence of god they don't don't stop when it's over and the joy of the lord's our strength we need the joy rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is god's will for the church the bible says concerning you concerning you who cares about the person you're sitting next to when it comes to the joy of the lord you you be the one that takes the joy and if we all become that determined i'm not saying not care about one another but the prophet did say if there's only one going to make it in that city you make sure you're that one so you have to get that serious about it you know if you get full of joy you will be able to help the person sitting next to you don't wait for some preacher to come by and make you feel good for about an hour and 40 minutes and then go home and continue to do the same things that brought your that took your joy away to begin with we're talking about something that stays with you 24 7. seven days a week 30 days a month 12 months a year get everything give thanks take it personally because it's concerning you and it's not my will not preaching my wealth this is god's will if we stop judging circumstances worthy enough for our gratitude worthy enough for our rejoicing and take the scriptures personally if we humble ourselves to do all things without murmuring and complaining if we just accept the will of god for our lives that in everything we're to give thanks it will make a difference you to god's word let him make you glad if i could do whatever i wanted to do in my flesh and still be glad in the lord oh i would try to do it and so would you how do i know that because we try to do it all the time we can't it won't work might be happy for a little bit but god is looking to have all of us all the time to do his will all the time it's a different life because we're not of this world when you're going through trials learn to give thanks when you're suffering learn to give thanks when you're asked to do something learn to give thanks don't say well it depends live by the sixth sense believe god is in it rejoice in everything give thanks look what peter said in first peter chapter 4 verse 12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you why do we think it's strange because we don't want it we didn't ask for it we had never prayed for it but you know what we need it here's what we need to do when we recognize that we're going through a trial rejoice rejoice in as much as you are a partaker of christ's sufferings what an honor he suffered for me it's about to honor to be able to suffer and be a partaker of that suffering that's an honor that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy how many times you you go through a child you realize god was there i'm sure those three hebrew children were in there in the fiery furnace they weren't talking to jesus like this what'd you make us go through i thought we were yours i think there was a rejoicing going on there was great joy in their heart that god had not left them god had not forsaken them that god was going to see them even in the middle of this trial god is wanting us to have faith in our situations instead of questioning our situations i feel like saying amen if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy are you you ever get reproached and you're not happy but if you get reproached for the name of christ you're happy for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part is evil spoken of but on your part he's glorified you have a different attitude than they do first peter chapter one verse five first peter chapter 1 verse 5 we are kept by the power of god in only one avenue through faith that's the only world will ever be kept is you've got to believe through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time how many believers were in the last time wherein you greatly rejoice not just a a beanie peasy little bit at church but you greatly rejoice though now through now no though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptation i mean the darts are coming from every angle that the trial of your faith it's much more precious than anything that you can think of on this world more precious than of gold that perish though it be tried with fire it might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ look at this whom having not seen we love think about this we are to fall in love with jesus christ somebody we have not seen the way we fall in love with jesus christ is to fall in love with his word that is the way you fall in love with somebody i mean think about this if we're going to have some sort of dating app and we're going to go there my name is so-so i've got blue eyes i'm this tall on this way this is my hobby this is what it man i don't like this i don't but i like this and that and before you somebody's on the other side says oh they they they like to go uh hiking i like that oh they like to they they like to go canoeing they they like baseball you know what that's my type of person they're reading god's word amen something inside says that connects with me that's what i'm looking for it matches my type that's my type too often we're wanting the word to be something different than what it is that's why we get in the part where we we pick certain scriptures ignore others pick certain quotes ignore others pick certain preachers ignore others and before you know it we make something that it's not we in whom having not seen we love in whom though now we see him not yet we believe the word he rejoiced with joy unspeakable and full of glory amen you don't need me to to rejoice you don't need circumstances to be right you don't need anything to be right just god you you be right with god get in his presence say god fill me fill me not being satisfied with how much you got be hungry for more be thirsty you want to be full of glory joy and speak of full glory not just a little bit receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls if you believe then rejoice rejoice look at all the pain and suffering jesus went through yet he was full of joy and that joy was never driven by outward circumstances it was driven by an inward circumstance amen he had the father's joy in his heart for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son he was out to do the work of the father the bible says for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross something inside of him he was able to be so full of joy that it gave him strength to give his life that we could sit here one day and know him he operated by the sixth sense of faith it wasn't like i don't deem this um worthy of rejoicing in my thanksgiving my appreciation i don't think i'm sorry i'm out of here no he wasn't carnal christian he saw something inside he had a vision for souls yes god give us that burden give us that vision he chose to endure the cross for you and i he wasn't ashamed to call his brethren too often we're ashamed to be associated with somebody because we don't like something about somebody shame on us shame on us we should be washing their feet we should be helping them we should be so full of the love of god amen it shouldn't be just something preached from the pulpit it should be something preached by the body amen not judging the body saying this one don't got it that no god look what they did who cares satan can do that he's an accuser of the brethren looking for somebody that would get on their knees care about somebody have a burden build the wall build the body get the rejoicing going psalm 16 verse 8 i have set the lord always before me because he's at my right hand i shall not be moved therefore my heart is glad my glory rejoices my flesh also shall rest in hope for thou will not leave my soul in hell neither will thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption that will show me the path of life and in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore don't you want to be in the right hand of god i'll tell you there's no moodiness there let's take a look here at matthew chapter 20 21 15. you don't have to know the lord very long to get in his presence to feel the joy of the lord to to to to get the benefits of of rejoicing the bible says that when the chief priests and the scribes saw that saw the wonderful things that jesus did the children crying in the temple saying hosanna to the son of david they were so displeased you ever come into church somebody is kind of quiet and somebody's really trying to enter in and you're sitting there and you keep going like come on you know what i'm talking about how about somebody gets back from a men's meeting gets back from a special service and and they're really trying to put forth an effort to build an atmosphere and the majority are just that's well that's what was happening in this situation they were so displeased because they themselves weren't in the same mood they didn't have the same rejoicing going on and said unto him hearst thou what these say and jesus said unto them yea have ye never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise now this word perfected it means repair or to restore are you with me i think we need to repair and to restore our praise to god i don't think we should wait until you feel the circumstances just right what kind of relationship is that with your god i'm just gonna wait i'm just you don't need to wait to rejoice you don't need to wait to praise all you need to do is breathe all ye that have breath praise ye the lord he's worthy of all praise at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth continually we have a church to dedicate we have our lives to rededicate amen and we need to prepare with proper worship it's easy to worship with our lips you're the old saying in the world put your money where your lips are at your mouth is that i need i believe we as christians we need to put our life where our mouth is at i always remember never can't forget brother johnson i'm sure brother bruce remembers brother johnson would say it's not my notes but he would say don't ever jump higher than you can walk make sure you can walk the talk i'm okay with jumping i'm okay with sean i'm okay with having a great time i'm not okay with it just being left at church take it home take it home keep rejoicing keep jumping keep bringing christ to those in the home around you your neighbors spread the gospel make it real true worship isn't for babies look at all what the disciples had to go through all their sufferings timothy was wanting his worship to god to be without suffering and so was peter before he got the holy ghost we are not going to have this in our church you're going to do this i'm going to find another place imagine how long suffering god has to be with us he's trying to get the truth to us now our flesh doesn't want it but we get inoculated with the holy ghost we can't sit still with it you just got to tell somebody about the love of god god has high expectations for worship given to him we must always remember as humans we live in a physical realm that's subject to emotions and feelings sometimes we don't feel like worshipping god let me reword that the majority of the time we come to church we don't feel like it and then we put all the pressure on the song leader up here come on because we don't feel like it he's got to do a better job than that if i'm going to worship where is your relationship with god amen is this how you're going to treat him because you don't feel like it i tell you true worship is not for babies anybody can worship and offer a sacrifice when they feel like it that's right but try praising god when everything the bottom falls out try trusting him try singing all as well and meaning it because you're a believer john chapter 4 verse 24 john chapter 4 verse 24 god is a spirit even though we're humans we come in with feelings of emotion and baggage get it off because we're going to meet god in spirit form come on god is the spirit and they that worship him must it's an absolute must i don't have to it'll never reach him they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth what do you say about that you know not what you worship you know you know what's going on you think you think you know what you worship in spirit means out of flesh try to keep it simple in truth means all that god is get to a place where it's all god that's all you see it's him only him i know there's other people in the room i know things are but i'm so in tune with him it's all him right now take me lord take me lord that's the spirit we need to get into the spirit of the word out of our emotions and feelings out of our circumstance-driven attitude and into the realm of god's spirit where faith can see that god has complete control of what's happening right now complete control he's doing something here i don't know what he's doing we're getting tuned get out of the flesh get in tune god wants to do something in us jesus said in verse 23 now the same chapter the hour cometh and now is now is that's right this second now is when the true worshiper shall worship the father in spirit and in true for the father is looking right he's coming down every aisle he's looking will you be the one will you be the one to step out of your flesh say lord i'm sorry for my carnality today but i just want to worship you why because you're worthy not because we had a good day a good week but you're worthy i don't care what how hard your week was i don't care how you feel i don't care how sick you are he's worthy he's worthy get your eyes on jesus he's worthy he's worthy of all praise i feel like a hypocrite praise him anyways he's worthy don't put your yourself in a place where you think it doesn't deem worthy why we have fallen we're talking about grace here when you first got saved he didn't say well let's just stick this thing through no something inside of you was bubbling it's a bubble in i gotta praise him you weren't thinking about how bad you were you were thinking about how much he saved you from your badness he's here to do the same his mercies are new every day just enter into the spirit we want to dedicate this church with the right spirit the right attitude want to dedicate our our lives to to never look back to never go where we came from we're heading into in the in a forward direction don't just sit here and be a part be the part let god use you marching in the symphony that god you have a part to play in this church play that part come with all your heart amen be a true servant and serve serve that's what they do they serve they're not served they sir we're all servants of god we all serve get our thoughts away i deserve i need i pretty soon you're going to deem things worthy or not worthy of your thanksgiving there are two completely different sacrifices that we need to offer to god one the sacrifice of praise to the sacrifice of our lives hebrews chapter 13 verse 15 says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god once you feel good once in a while at church periodically offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually what does that mean that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks unto his name thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord i'll never forget this brother johnson was preaching one time and i guess he had maybe got done preaching a a service on being thankful or something along those lines and that night he was by the fire and i don't know if he was doing marshmallows or what it was but it seemed like one of the marshmallows popped came right on his eye and the devil came in and said well what are you going to be thankful about that for he says devil i'm thankful that it didn't get in my eye find something to give thanks for there's always something if you've got a spirit of thanksgiving in you the whole world judges deeming things whether they're worthy of our thanksgiving or not but we're not of the world we're christians and we need to rise up i'm thankful that we're here but you know what i don't i don't mean this building now i'm thankful that we're here but i don't want to be here i want to be a bear i want to be in this image i want to be in his lightness i want to handle life the way he does i want to think the way he thinks you know he's he knows all the evil that's going on in the world but he don't sit there and dwell on it not about knowing the evil he's he's still his mind is looking for the seed that hasn't come in yet it isn't about making a little bit of your time through the week to try to help in that scenario help god out friends it's about being sold out to an eternal purpose it's about being called to his eternal purpose and if we can love god that much that we give our lives to god how can we have the joy of the lord and not be committed to god don't try to get by day after day with just happiness to happiness to happiness you'll be searching like a gerbil in a scroll cage durable cage you know what i'm trying to say they just go around around chasing their tail get nowhere there's something more everlasting and it's right here inside it's about your relationship with god inside now he may ask you to do something just do it just do it he may ask you to stop doing just stop doing it i mean i should just start spending some time with him just spend time with him don't make it complicated he's here to take our complicated lives and simplify them he's here to take our our complexity of i just got so many things going on i just i just and make them peaceful this up and down happiness and give us a steady joy full glory his glory all right number two the sacrifice of our lives romans chapter 12 verse 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you offer or present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable in god which is your reasonable service and i'll tell you what this we really prove true worship um i think honestly if we can't come in here and give our all in worship i question what's happening outside look the devil would like to bring us down amen till we come to the place of a carnal former church that's man directed with no moving of the holy ghost don't let god don't let the devil use you don't settle for this wherever you think we are and i know you all are rejoicing because we have this nice church and you should but don't settle don't settle for this just because this is better than that don't settle the beauty of the church is the character of the people we need to get characterized i need more of his character i wake up in the morning with aches and pains i want to wake up in his lightness i wake up with wrong thoughts i want to wake up with the right ones every time somebody comes into your mind give thanks pray for them give thanks don't sit there as a judge and say well this is worthy or this is not worthy just do what god does offer your body a living sacrifice that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god amen jeremiah chapter 33 verse 11 jeremiah 33 verse 11 the voice of joy the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom the voice of the bride the voice of them that say shall say a voice of them that shall say praise the lord of hosts i think there ought to be a unison here god wants us to praise him i believe the voice of the bride praises him for the lord is good for his mercy endureth forever and a then that shall bring this sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord did you bring it did you bring it don't wait to get here start building it before you get here bring it with you i brought my wallet i didn't bring my phone i had to ask brother mike to text my wife and bring my phone because i didn't bring it now either i brought my phone or identity i brought my wallet or dinner i bring my praise and i don't you don't assume i didn't bring my phone i assumed i did but i did it don't assume that you brought your praise bring your praise be able to pull it out and say here it is praise you the lord in the house of the lord he wants to be praised here this church is getting dedicated to the lord make it the way he wants it don't bring god down here come up in the heavenly places lift the name of the lord his name is a high tower the righteous run into it and they're safe we don't come here to work on our natural problems we come here to work on our spiritual problems the whole world is full of places you can go take care of natural needs now i'm not saying god don't care about him all he does but don't lower him to just be concerned about that he's getting a bride ready amen he's getting a bride ready for a rapture psalms 105 verse 43 43 and he brought forth his people with joy and is chosen with gladness now noticed he brought forth in other words he's the one that made them glad i say it like this when you make a decision that you're going to stop deeming whether things are worthy in your eyes to be grateful or not put that that childish when i was a child i thought as a child i put away childish things and start praising god and thanking him because he's worthy because the scriptures tell us he brought forth his people with joy and is chosen with gladness isaiah 63 verse 3 i'm sorry isaiah 61 verse 3 we're getting ready to close very soon it will i guarantee it will be promise it'll be in the next hour isaiah 61 verse 3 2 appoint unto them that mourn in zion to mourn in zion that get in the prayer closet when they get to church and say god take this vile life of mine make it mourn your image to give unto them the give them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified isn't that beautiful what god can wants to do for us we just got to let go and let him have his way humble our south before the lord isaiah 65 verse 18 but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which i create for behold i create jerusalem or rejoicing are you spiritual jerusalem amen then he's creating you with rejoicing in your heart he create you know god is gonna have some angel or seraphim up there with two wings saying look at me i'm great two wings say i'm not gonna worship you and two wings you know just just ignore no god's going to create creatures that will worship him that will reverence him that will humble themselves and who are we the bride of jesus christ worships god just as much as everybody else you know what i think they do more i think they do more and what the beauty of that is is coming through feel more agency bring more agency take someone that came out of the gutter that only cared about himself look at me i'm so great change that vile nature into a nature that says i know i'm nothing he's great he's the great one we don't ever want to lose that vision amen psalms 27 verse 5 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing with all my heart i will sing praises unto the lord i won't come here and sit in the seat and be entertained anymore look for some entertainment to get me in a mood to deem me a happiness to be here no i will come and i will bring my praises to the house of god and i will offer them i will give my vitals i will give my vows to god what he's done for us give it back to him you ever seen that where you know i already said thank you for that that's old news that's past i already thanked him for saving me it ought to be just as fresh today you know if it's just as fresh today that means you see how bad you are without him bring the sacrifice of of joy and thanksgiving it's not about coming and rallying behind brother ron or rallying behind the preacher or the pastor it's not it's about bringing what you've got to the table it's about bringing what's inside of you to the atmosphere that we create for god's presence to come and do things among us that he's never done yet i want him to do those things he wants to do those things you want him to do those things what's in the way our flesh our carnality coming in not prepared expecting the preacher the song leader to get us ready it's not their job that's a personal job it's a personal job yeah god uses one another to help one another but how do you know god didn't call you to come in and give some encouraging word to the song leader before he went up there how do you know well that's just not my job well why do you think you're so such a judge of somebody else's job how come not your own we need to to come in with all of our heart god this is your home i'm coming i'm going to bring my my joy my rejoicing my heart i'm coming with gladness for you have done great things for me use me to encourage somebody use me to help let the words of my mouth glorify your name i don't want to talk about this talk about that tell you this joke that joking you know what happened here and i don't care about that we have our homes for this this is the house of god i'll tell you if there's anything that we need here is we need to be building one another we need to dedicate ourselves to god well brother john i'm not used to this i understand i understand it's time to make a decision let's start working towards it start working towards it i believe it's the will of god we can make church whatever we want to make it i just so happen to want to make it all that god is i want you to join with me with that isaiah 55 verse 11 soul shall whoa did i read verse 6 yes i did yes i did yes isaiah 55 just two more scriptures and

two i sent it now when we come to church we should be longing for the word to speak to us yes because the one thing is for sure god's word will not return void something inside should be god prepare me help me to hear your word long for it don't i'm just writing them in the message as if that's going to bring god to speak to you i'd rather be out of the message and in the right spirit with the hunger and the thirst god i need to know you for ye shall go out with joy amen for you shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace how many want that today amen the mountains and hills shall break forth before you in singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands i'll tell you as we are approaching this time of the year and the wind and the colors i want you to think about

atmosphere isaiah chapter 12 last scriptures here therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation you can't come to church and expect to get well out of the water with negativity with sadness with nobody cares about me you can't do that it's okay you're battling but i'm telling you you can't sit here and just have that kind of attitude in church it isn't like god's going to
