you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I want to say it's it's good to be in the house of the Lord today amen I've just been feeling as we were singing that song just even prior uh to the service how grateful I am how thankful I feel God is good to us and there's no place better place to come I mean he's worthy of all praise at all times but to be in the place that he dedicated to be his house and to praise and worship him to bring that sacrifice I believe the Lord is well pleased with that amen if you would turn with me in your Bibles to the book of uh Isaiah we're going to um just read a few scriptures there in Isaiah chapter 38 and then have you be seated we're going to show a few pictures but I just keep you from standing again Isaiah chapter 38 verse 1-5 before we read let's look to the the author of this book amen our precious Heavenly Father Lord we count it a privilege to be in your house today thank you for the promise that you said you'd meet us there many songs have been written even in the Psalms of your word David talks about meeting you in this place so God we count it a privilege to be in your house today thank you for being the the keeper of your house and Lord for for the order that we have and the confidence that when we come here that we can hear from heaven we can hear your voice and Lord that we can receive all the blessings that you have in store for us a place where faith is given out to your people because Lord you said your word declares that we're faith uh where where um Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen we thank you for this Lord we ask that you would bless this service bless your your people may you bless this word and all that would be spoken to each and every heart here may we leave here more dedicated more consecrated and encouraged to serve you in uh the light of this late hour that we're living as we commit the service your blessings and the reading of the word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen Isaiah 38 starting with verse one in those days was Hezekiah sick unto death and Isaiah the prophet the son of Amos came unto him and said unto him thus saith the Lord set thy house in order for thou shall die and not live and Hezekiah turned his face towards the wall and prayed unto the Lord and said remember now oh Lord I beseech thee how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and Hezekiah wept sore and the L and then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah saying go and say to Hezekiah thus sayeth the Lord the god of David thy father I have heard thy prayer I have seen thy tears behold I will add unto thy days 15 years amen God bless you may be seated before we stepped into this I just I wanted to um show some pictures uh from the Philippines that was sent I know that uh many of us have been praying for the Believers there that uh many of their homes were uh destroyed by the floods and even though it's far away from us and um but they are our Brothers and Sisters in Christ and I she sent these pictures and I I thought we could just pass them on so we could could maybe uh get a vision of of how to pray for these people that are less fortunate than us today and uh I'll just read what she had given us here here are some pictures that Brother Gary from nuba uh Kenneth sir they are just some of of the houses of his members where he was able to visit riding a small bat signal is still very intimate and slow uh he can't send more there are 17 families in his church whose houses and livelihood have been affected Brother Gary lost more than 300 Hogs some of you may remember remember me speaking this before the typhoon because of the African swine view flu and they were supposed to harvest rice last week but even before they could do it the rice fields were already flooded they were supposed to harvest 1500 LBS or 1500 bags but ended up with just 34 which they got a day before the typhoon so the brother cannot help his members because because he himself doesn't have any means now amen praise the Lord that there are believers on the other side of the world that believe in prayer believe in support and by the grace of God this church was able to send some some help over to help these people I I believe every prayer every offering you put in the back in that says missions I believe God records he says he's not forgetful to forget your labor of love which you have shown unto the Saints and say God remembers a cup of cold water would not even be the reward of giving a cup of cold water to somebody it will not be forgotten amen I'm thankful that God is keeping some good records now we're all um maybe a little bit tired because we're like watching the good news course the the the election um that happened I'm sorry as to say that but the election was taking place and um it is um um well I'm I'm just thankful the Bible tells us to pray for those that are in authority and we're we're we're just anxious to see uh the results of that and I want to thank everybody for praying I believe that's uh in order and there has been a great relief uh about what has transpired in uh all across America and I know everybody isn't you know maybe in favor and that's very okay it's really okay um but um we know that we're living in a dark hour and we still have to get ready we still have to make sure that we're ready no matter who is being president no matter what's happening what is allowed there is a relationship that we have as individuals with God that that's really what matters and that's why we're here today uh one more thing before we get into the word and that's uh brother uh Gideon wanted to send his greetings U most some of you I could say like this had been praying for some time for him to get a Visa well he was just able to get his visa and uh he really appreciates the prayers of all the saints and um and so now we can at least have uh to look forward to him coming uh sometime and I don't know when that would be but at least the means to get here now we just want you know the will of the Lord amen we want to entitle this message this this evening your house we want to talk about your house now God came to Hezekiah with an important message from heaven and this message was set thy house in order Hezekiah didn't even realize this his house was out of order you notice this from the scriptures he said I've walked before thee in truth with a perfect heart I've done that which is good in thy sight and he was kind of thinking that what he had done in the past should have sufficed but that's not the way God looks at things God is not a god of the past he he is a god of the present amen he when he he told Moses tell him that I am that I am he's in I am God so God is really interested in what's happening in our house today no matter what we've done in the best he's interested in what's happening today but God said your house is out of order you need to set your house in order am God had found things out of order and hezek his house maybe the priorities were out of sequence you ever get priorities out of sequence right the God made it clear what the priorities are seek ye first the kingdom Priority One maybe there was some swearing going on in his home maybe some fighting or arguing or some gossiping or backbiting maybe there wasn't enough prayer time maybe there wasn't not enough respect in the home but God saw that something was out of order and someone was needed to rearrange the laxidasical attitude or the spirit that was in his home and God said Hezekiah I know you're sick but you are the head of the home and you're responsible for all the things that happen in your home and it is your responsibility to set the home in order notice he didn't leave as zekiah to go to the wife or to the children didn't matter if he was sick didn't matter if he was ready to die he had a responsibility and that was to set things in order and I believe it is our responsibility in our homes to make sure that things are in order so God wanted him to start directing his home towards him towards peace towards love command every devil to leave your premises to put away the other gods because we can't serve God and ourselves at the same time to instruct your house in the righteousness of God to rearrange your priorities and put me first in your house to set thy house in order know a lot of times in our homes there's confusion kids the family everybody's not on the same page Bible says for God is not the author of confusion but a peace as in all churches of the Saints well we are the church are we not the church we are the church and this Spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets can I interpret that for us a little bit the spirit the spirits that be of God are subject to God or the word of God so if the spirit that you're projecting is of god you will stay in the boundaries of the word of God Amen not try to like well you got to do it my way or the way that I'm saying it or I'm the boss or you're not listen listening that's just a ball of confusion and God is not the author of Confusion And so I believe that God wants our house in order just like he wanted hezekiah's house in order he don't want confusion in this house this is his house James 3:16 Says for where envy and strife is there is confusion and every evil work Envy Strife when the spirits in your home are not subject to the word of God there will be Strife there will be resentfulness you ever feel resentfulness discontentment well that's what envying is there'll be confusion and the Bible says look this is basic every evil work just because of confusion see the devil knows how to yeah we've all had this we've all had a problem with somebody in our house doesn't necessarily need to be our spouse our children our parent could be sister brother and it starts out with something ridiculous like you ate the last cookie without asking me if I wanted half something so ridiculous and before you know it there's this anger and and and hatred and this this evil all because I didn't know how to handle the cookie that's because the spirit of the enemy was really in control because you allowed things to get out of control and I believe we're living in an hour that this needs to become a priority our homes are a priority because you we are nothing different in this church than what we are in our homes nothing different so it's important that our homes our homes make up with the churches you ever come to church I just don't feel like trying you want to know why that is because in your home you didn't feel like trying you you you ever come to church and don't want to get in the prayer room that's because you don't want to pray in home or you come to church and you just want somebody to serve you that's because in your home you wanted somebody to serve you and and we if our if we get our homes in line with the word of God that means our church Spirit wise will be more in line with the word of God Amen so we need to stop making excuses and get our our house in order don't sit around on the Lazy Boy don't sit around on the high horse don't act like there's nothing to do in your home there's need of nothing direction is needed from the headship rule regulation is needed structure is needed time spent building is needed your house won't get in order just because your name is John Martin just because you've been serving God for two years it doesn't mean your house is in order and it's a subject that we really maybe haven't wanted to look at but when I see the things that have transpired the things that have been happening and just praying God what would you have me to do what would you have me to say what can help well this is what came to my heart we've got to get an agreement that there's a job that we need to do in our homes because our homes are what our church is and even though we don't necessarily come out manifest yelling and swearing and getting upset and angry and want to punch the pastor I understand that but that Spirit still comes here and then it's hard to enter in hard to really worship from the dictates of our heart hard to just say God have your way with me because at home we don't let God have our way his way because we're going to be the boss because you're the boss doesn't mean the house is in order I think our houses get out of order and we don't even realize it and we're left and if I'll say if they're left out don't order too long you know what happens this is the truth you develop a spirit of I don't even care that they're out of order in other words you put forth no effort you just kind of want to walk out like ignore it I'm done I'm not listening to that anymore I hate I hate you may not say the words but the spirit of you not just getting down and washing the feet of your family is a spirit of hate that's what it is it's love less now you ought to be you ought be saying Amen to this message but because as clear as anything it's the right message for tonight that I know what an awful condition to be stuck in leoda and not even care an awful condition to not care about the character of our own children getting to the place that we don't even care about our example our spirit our attitude or or or the repercussions that our kids are going to act like just because our attitude is not caring we need to get a house in order an awful thing to be little God thinking it's his job to raise our children in the fear and ammonition of the Lord it is our job to raise our children in the fear and am it ain't God's job we can't just well it doesn't matter what I do it matters extremely what you do because what you do is going to make your children either want to serve God or could care less set thy house in order brother bam said in the message sure we would see Jesus he says you know we talk so much in America about juvenile delinquency it ain't juvenile delinquency it's parent delinquency so a lot of times it's the parents' fault not the children's one of the meanest mans in town brother BR said delinquent mothers and delinquent fathers is what makes delinquent child in the message influence he says I think our great problem of what we believe to be juvenile delinquency is parent delinquent a home delinquent think about it we don't even care how our home condition is our people have gotten away from the things they should have stayed with prayer real down to earth God is going to be the God of this home let's get serious and pray let's stop this attitude let's stop this talking we don't hear this in the word we don't hear this in church let's not have it in our homes Jesus said because iniquity just do whatever you want to do would abound the love of many would wax cold too many parents have lost genuine love for the character of of seeing the character of Jesus Christ in their children I I I've been around long enough to let you know children just don't wake up grow up and have character of Christ on their own that is a false conception there is a reason that we've been given the responsibility to bring them up in the way they should go brother Bandon said you are the Holy Ghost until your children get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost cares about its attitude cares about what it says it it cares about the example that it sets the way we Act is like we we're some denominational Church doesn't matter it matters we need a fear of God in our heart when we lose respect for ourselves we will automatically lose respect for our children you can't say you respect yourself and disrespect your children respecting yourself is not believing and having your own way and thinking your your will is important that is not respect respect is keeping yourself under subjection to the word brother BR said in the message the world has falling apart he's talking about this policeman he this policeman said well I admire that he said that's right when I was on the police force and everything uh it was juvenile delinquency that's what we call it today and and I said brother BR said and I said sir I don't I don't want to disagree with you but I said it's not juvenile delinquency it's parent delinquency the parent is delinquent parents don't know how to handle things and they don't care they either don't care or they don't know and instead of humbling themselves like the Bible says and get on your knees to just pray and say God would you help my children would you help my spouse would you help my home no they'd rather just I don't care so what do we develop a delinquent home a home out of order a home that God if he showed up at the door would have to say set your house in order before I come in he says' what did you do you put a true story magazine on the table instead of the Bible instead of prayer meetings you had to run out somewhere and do something else you know prayer meeting is just not important to many people nowadays that's what the matter with the world is today that's what the matter with our called Christians see it's parent delinquent not child delinquent the parent is delinquent uh he was saying this for years in many messages in the message door to the doors brother brand said this is the last quote so bear with me after you acquaint he says are you acquainted with the Amish this is back in ' 65 he says I don't know whether you have them out here uh long hair they're very sweet people very clean very nice type you know and all those menites and Amish and so forth he says we've not got one record of juvenile delinquency you he says call them funny if you want to but we got something lacking in our homes that they have they have't one record in the courts of juvenile misbehavior coming among them they bring up their children just in one way and that's the way they go the more consistent we are the more the children will not be confused and the more the children not confused the more they'll have their head on straight of how they're supposed to act and what they're supposed to do we can't expect them to be more intelligent more spiritual and and be able to overcome emotions and feelings better than us we're not trying to teach them to be to to be under subjection to us we're trying to teach them to be under subjection to God the motive has to be God God has to teach your children to love the Lord thy God with all their heart with all they soul with all they might if you want God to back you up put God first now the first thing I would do to get my house in order I would do the same thing that Hezekiah did you know what he did he turned his face towards the wall and prayed unto the Lord that's the first thing he did to get his house in order amen and I'll just say Ladi this you need to get serious with God right this thing of God knows my heart and this he does he knows what I'm going through humble yourself dig out those clothes of humility and put them on the Bible says all ye be subject one to another humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God and he shall exalt you in due time how many want God to do something in your home but we have the remedy right here in the word of God look this can be applied to our children our grandchildren our our great grandchildren our brothers our sisters you apply this word and God will bless you James 5:15 and the prayer of faith this is how important prayer is the prayer of faith shall save the sick the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven what a promise through prayer prayer changes the situation and this is a perfect example and Hezekiah you got 15 more years so prayer does change situations if it Chang that for him it can certainly forgive me of my sins it can certainly deal with spirits that are trying to get in my home deal with my kids prayer brings down the power of God from Heaven to overcome the devil don't try to over become the devil yourself right don't try to say I cast you out in the name of John Martin and I'll say this don't use the name of Jesus if you don't respect it yourself God honors a heart that has put him first there's power in prayer mix your prayer if you're struggling just mix your prayer with a broken and contrite heart a broken and contrite spirit just mix it God will see God will not despise that I don't care about the condition you you you go ahead and you look at Jonah you look at um many examples in the Bible where people gotten away from God if they just humbled themselves God was always merciful to them yes God will move in your behalf when you're in there in prayer the right way you get up from prayer with the determination that I am truly with from my heart I'm going to set things in order in my home you have to care about doing that you have to get up in faith you have to say I'm moving forward because your house is not going to get order just because you got them in church it don't happen like that you've got to take the word you've got to eat the word you got to say I'm going to become the word I'm going to manifest the word prayer is the first thing I can't quite remember but was it brother Boaz that said there's three things prayer is number one prayer is number two prayer is number three prayer is powerful amen it's your it's your heart's communication with God you can't sit there and say well God knows all things God knows my heart God knows what I want no God wants to see you put clothes of humility on humble yourself before him well I'm just you know I don't feel like doing it John that's probably why we got the mess that we got that's probably why we struggle with the things that we struggle with because we haven't taken god seriously we come to church we hear the word and we think oh that's just Brother John John's opinion no is not brother John's opinion God's Gonna back up his word he's not GNA back up John Martin he will back up his word let God fill your home with his presence the presence of peace and how do you do that by humbling yourself to respect your home and put prayer back in the home I like what that one brother said I don't know who it was but he said you know we get all B out of shape because they could they took prayer out of the school and we talk about how bad it is they took prayer out of the school and it's really hurt our school and they let the devil get prayer out of their own home Isaiah 567 yeah maybe we can put that one up there Isaiah 567 how many is enjoying the word today amen it's the word of God you think we need the word of God Isaiah 567 says even them will I bring to my Holy Mountain and make them joyful In My House of Prayer we're still talking about prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrific shall be accepted upon my Altar for my house shall be called a house of prayer for that generation for all people amen so I want you to think about what this this building is really what it really is this this building that we call Sendel light church this non denominational church this this place where we go we we sing songs we hear the preaching what is really this place this place is a House of Prayer and we struggle to get here and pray in God's House of Prayer it's because we don't respect it as a House of Prayer come on we think it's some name we call it the House of Prayer no he wants his house to represent this is a place we come and have contact with him we get serious with him if God wanted his house to be one of prayer shouldn't we want our house to be one of prayer yes I mean you want God in your home right this is the place we believe God is I I tell you if you want God out of your home if you want God out of your church pick disrespect respect the word and kick part of the word out Don't Preach all the word and God will leave that or you might have manifestations because people have certain faith for certain things but you know what when it comes down to revealing who he really is you kick that out because he has hid it from the wise and prudent revealed it to babes and I'll say if you want God out of your home all you do is you disrespect the word you can't expect God to be in your home when you're not respecting his word which is what he stands for so it's important Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Amen God has never intended his house to be a fellowship hall or a place that we come and we sit in church and we demand God to speak to us what we want to speak to or else we're going to have an attitude God has always intended this place to be a place where his people can come to and be intimate with him that's what prayer is you know that's what prayer is all about you know prayer is really is really not a prayer request we we write out our prayer requests and we say God this is what I want and that's the end of our prayer prayer is meant to be intimate it's where you come in contact with God you hear his voice he hears your voice he sees your love you see his love Faith grows and there's a relationship going on that's what it's intended to be for a place where the weary can come in and get connected with God to sincerely wait on him for his presence to come and begin to instruct Us in the ways of life but you know what the problem is with a lot of people and why they kicked out the real reason they kicked Jesus Christ the word of God out of their churches they replaced it with bands they replaced it with entertainment they replaced it with Bingle they replaced it with everything and I'm going to tell you why because they don't need to be intimate they can have church without them I'll tell you why would we ever want anything without God Isaiah chter 40:3 says even the youth shall faint our youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint what a promise here this church has been set up and dedicated for that for the relationships of people but if we don't reverence it we're not serious about it we're turning our nose up to God and making this something different than what he intended it to be my house shall be called a House of Prayer amen Jeremiah 29:12 says then shall ye call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and you know what I will hearken unto you you shall seek me and you shall find me when you search for me if we believe it's all of our heart then let's start seeking him with all our heart amen because I'm going to say it like this I have seven children and if I have one child doing their chores giving their best being respectful to one another honoring their father and mother am I going to reward them with the same amount that these other six who just could care less Jesus said this I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work God's got good records we have we you know we this is the way that we've gotten in life we can get mad we can get upset we can swear we can do what we want to do walk away forget about it and think you know since I'm not thinking about it everything's okay God isn't like that that's how the churches are in the world this is a we believe the word of God we believe in realness genuiness yeah we got people in the church who are human who make mistakes who have a testimony I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to serve God and they're going to fall that's that is acceptable what's not acceptable is to stay down after you fallen that's wrong get up get up and serve the Lord with all your heart put some effort into it seven times seven times get up this is a God we serve a God that's worthy to be getting up off our fallen faces give them our best he's worthy he saved you how many blessings has he blessed you with and you can't find a reason to get up and do your best that's just a devil Church is a place we can seek and worship God with all of our hearts church is a place to make a Joyful Noise to to bring our our offerings to God you know sometimes we come into church and the only offering we want to give give is a is an amen or a little I like that song so I'm going to try to sing that one no heart just emotion feeling if I feel good then I'll say Amen not even thinking about any kind of offering to keep the lights on or the air conditioning on or the heat on you know it's like well that you know somebody else takes care of that where's your burden are you part of the church that wasn't in my [Laughter] notes it's a place to come and lay before the Lord in reverence say God I really want to hear from you take away my hard heart let me hear from you because that's I don't know how many times we could hear the word of God hear directly from God but we're in another planet too many people don't want to hurt and suffer to to to bring a sacrifice they want somebody else to handle it somebody else to do it Mark 11:1 17 Jesus taught the people saying unto them is it not written my house shall be called of all Nations the House of Prayer but you you have made it a den of Thieves wow now you say well brother John none of us are in here trying to Pedal some books that's not how I read that we can end up making God's house something different than what it is for our own personal gain something that we're trying to get from being amongst other people doesn't have to be money maybe we just make us a place of fellowship with our believer our family maybe meet somebody there like the main thing is I'll just I'll just meet you there we'll talk then or maybe do we just want to build up our reputation in front of somebody else and let them know you know how spiritual we are maybe a place just to to show up at God's house make an appearance and just to appease ourselves that we went to church making the church which should be a House of Prayer something different than what it is now I'll say I'll say this and I mean this from my heart those of us that are sincere and humble and really want to serve God I say God bless you to those who are are not sincere who are not humble who have not been putting their heart into it I want this word to bring conviction to you because that's what it's for Jesus wants his house to be reverenced and he wants his house to be kept his house not to be made something different exactly the way he wanted it now if we've all worked for somebody and when we we work for somebody we have to kind of find out the way they want things done you just can't walk into some place make $40 an hour and start calling the shots of what you're going to do there if they're going to pay you 40 60 bucks an hour you want to make make sure that you're doing the things that they want you to be doing right this is God's house it's your responsibility to care enough to know how to please him it is not the preacher up here to keep pounding how you should act and how you should be still during the service it is not the job of the preacher it's the job of your heart to get your house your house in order to set it in order to teach these things to your children God wants to meet his people we have come into this place we've gathered in his name to worship him just for get about yourself concentrate on him and word worship him we sing we got the word all we need is the heart our heart to be in the place that things can begin to supernaturally happen that we can be conformed into the image of Jesus Christ now I believe in the reality of this word because I know what I used to be I don't want to go back I don't want to go back to what I was our personal attitude can make the church completely different than what God intended to be in other words when you walk through the doors remember this is God's House of Prayer get your agenda on what God wants it to be and not on what you got in your mind now if God's house needed to be cleaned up right he went in there with a whip and he cleaned up the house if God's own house needed to be cleaned up how much more should ours it's good to clean up our attitudes in our homes to do a checkup from the neck up as it were to make sure that we get our house in order because he's coming soon now if he spoke tonight he might not say Thou shalt not live but Thou shalt die he may not say that but if he did speak to you tonight I believe he would say get your house in order I'm coming soon I believe that with all my heart imagine if Jesus came over your house and spent a few days with you absolutely but you know what we'd have to do we'd have to stop all the things that we had planned going I mean it's easy to say no I'm busy I I I'm working I can't come to church I I don't have money to give you know this is you don't understand my circumstances you can do that but you're standing in the front of in the front of Jesus you will never do that that only shows that you don't believe he's here it's the truth which means your attitude has made this church a denominational Church how is God going to bless your home your home with that attitude be careful how you've entertained strangers no be careful how you entertain Angels some have entertained angels unawares God wants us we don't he doesn't want us to have oh yeah you're going to have an encounter today an angel is going to meet you and I you got to be on your best behavior now he wants us to be in our best behavior all the time he wants us to respect others talk to people the right way have a good attitude towards them because God is real if we want to live in a fantasy that's our business but God Still Remains real Hebrews chapter 3 we're going to have to hurry now because this election is not going past midnight you know what I'm saying Hebrews 3:4 for every house is builded by some man so every one of us is building a house I don't you to think about your house here but he he that built all things is God and that's what we want to build our house is God and Moses verely was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were spoken were to be spoken after now we know Moses had a struggle in his home of circumcising his boys remember that yet today the Bible is written that he had a testimony that he was faithful in all his house as a servant now we know Moses he was a leader he was a chief commander brother Bron said he was a oneman army yet he became a servant to take care of his home he humbled himself and got his home in order when God said circumcise your children he was a leader Deuteronomy 18:15 says the Lord thy God shall raise up to thee raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy Brethren liken unto me unto to him you shall hearken so here's a prophecy of of of of Jesus Christ is going to be just like Moses this Prophet was Jesus Christ he was the captain of our Salvation he is the chief commander he said unless you believe I am he you're going to die in your sins but you know what he was likened unto Moses and this chief commander this captain of our Salvation he made himself of no reputation and took upon himself the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man the Bible says he being found in the fashion of a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross he took on the form of a servant you want to know why because he wanted brother Ron he wanted to get his house in order and you know whose house he is right we are his house in order to get his house in order he had to Humble himself doesn't the Bible say he cleansed and washed her by the water of the word that's how much he loves us now he's got a spiritual house to live in that's us brother Bron said we are the sickest body that he knew of the Holy Ghost is getting us ready for his dwelling John saw the New Jerusalem coming down it was the Tabernacle of God it was the house of God and it was man so his whole desire is to build a character in us that he could live in dwell in Hebrews 3:5 Moses verely was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which are spoken after verse 6 but Christ as a son over his own house whose house we are we If We Hold Fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the Hope firm unto the end so what was your beginning confidence when you got saved tell me about it when you got saved you really got saved did you come into church and say well whatever happens happens did you skip five Services did you say offering whatever that's not me it's not did you just go home and continue to yell and scream and fuss and fight I mean there was a change that took place we can all testify of that I mean even praise is perfected in a babe that just comes to Christ Christ but I'm going to be perfectly honest with you Satan has done a good job to get us to lose our beginning confidence and unfortunately we're not of that group that believes once saved always saved I do believe in a predestination but if you're predestinated you will maintain you will hold you will get back you will clean your house you will get that confidence that you had at the beginning and you will keep going till this race is over you will look to the author and the finisher of your faith you will keep running this race you will be like Paul I fought a good fight I finished the course laid up for me is eternal life don't lose that don't let it slip don't let the world distract you from your confidence in Christ I'll just say like this if things have gone to the side you got a word tonight the word is set thy house in order you got a job to do look at you I'm going to say like this if we're in a backsliding condition in some fashion form way how you didn't get there through the power of the Holy Ghost and I'm going to tell you what de the devil never bypassed your free more agency and and made you do the bad things that you did you made a choice and I think God wants you to make a choice I'm going to set my house back in order God will meet you there god'll meet you there Matthew 7 ver 24 we're going to have to hurry therefore whosoever heareth the Saints of mine and do with them I will liken unto him I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rains have said the floods came the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock so how many times have you heard somebody talk about their marriage and they went through a lot they had a lot of ups and downs and you know there was times that things are just but somehow it was just kept together I'm going to say it like this trials are going to come in our life problems are going to penetrate our home they're going to want to rock the home if you make sure that your decision making is based on this word you will be able to stand the test but if you get off and you leave Christ and Well church don't matter this don't matter that don't matter I don't care I can't deal with it right now you start having that attitude there is you have no promise that's foolish how many people have been Shipwrecked everyone that heareth the sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be liken unto a foolish man which buildt his house upon the sand the rang just said the floods came the winds blew and what happened it beat upon the house and it fell and not only that it said and great was the fall of it great was the fall of it Joshua 24:14 if we could put that up Joshua 24:14 just bear with me now therefore the Lord It's that simple be honest with yourself serve him in sincerity doesn't matter what your your kids speak your your your your parents think it it doesn't matter what your spouse thinks make a decision for your own heart serve him in sincerity and in truth put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and make a decision to serve the Lord and if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord then choose you this day whom you will serve whether it's the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord a a conscious decision made and you know what I need my daughter I need my wife to hold me accountable I need you the sheep of the pastor to hold the pastor accountable I need to want to know am I offending you hurting you displeasing you am I missing the Lord am I grieving him do you see something in my life that just needs to be dealt with that's what it means sincerity serving the lord isn't coming to church and just saying this is I believe the message and you kind of go home and live the life that you want to live that is not serving the lord we choose Christ every day of Our Lives we choose to serve him every day in sincerity but if we have let things come between us and God then it's real simple make a decision to clean your house to set the house in order we need a good cleaning the Bible says be confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in you shall perform it so God promised to finish a spiritual work that he started with you at the beginning of course we just read that there's something that we've got to do we've got to hold our beginning confidence steadfast we've got to we can't let it go and expect God to keep his end of the promise we got to clean our act up now Paul who who really wrote that in Philippians chapter 1 verse 6 he said what we need to do in chapter 3 he said not as though I've already attained either we're already perfect but I follow after if I may apprehend that for which also I'm apprehended of Jesus Christ Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do I forget those things which are behind me and I reach forth towards those things which are before you know too many people want to look at that promise God's going to finish the work that he started and so they just want to feel they've attained they've already attained because God promised to finish the work but that's not really what Paul's saying Paul's saying I press toward the mark in other words that's my beginning confidence when I got saved I went to church said Lord I want to serve you I want to know about you I want to walk here's my commitment here's my vows Paul's saying after 33 years he's got the same testimonies he did when he first got saved I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God and Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if any and if anything you be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this to you I trust that we have ears to hear what the spirit is saying to the church let's Stand Together set thy house in order in other words press toward the Mark Press towards the mark the only real peace the only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you the only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you in all life's triy I need you I know I [Music] do for the only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you the only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you he all only real peace that I have dear Lord is in you in all lives TR I need you I know I do the only real peace that I have here Lord is in you cast all your C upon [Music] Him bir down at your feet come I don't know just what to do okay cast all my cares upon you I cast all my cares upon you lay all my burdens down at your feet any time I don't know just what to do I will cast all my cares upon [Music] you I cast all my cares upon you I lay all of my burdens down at your feet anytime I don't know just to do I care on you amen I'm so thankful that we have someone to go to when we don't know what to do a lot of times there's situations in our home and there's just like no instructions what to do right just like chaos beginning to develop just say when that stuff is happening just know God saw that happening saw that was going to happen when you were praying this morning and you you just just believe that God's going to meet you there in the middle of the trial and if your heart's desire is sincere God I really want you to be the head of my home and I really don't want this to happen I believe God's going to meet you there I I believe God wants to be that personal to us to help help us with our our homes our homes are like all Sovereign right we we all have different rules God just wants to be the head of the home he's not too interested if the shoes are allowed to be on or not be on if the plates have to go from the table to the sink but he is interested in the spirit in the home the working together and and making this a place where Christ feels welcome amen amen let's bow our heart in the word of prayer I wonder if there be anybody that say brother John God has spoken to me today I want to submit to this word would you remember me in prayer amen God bless these hands God sees your hearts it's beautiful beautiful amen Lord we come to you in your name The Only Name that we know that there's power to break every stronghold Every Chain every every demonic Force every complex it's the name of Jesus oh we love your name Lord and Lord we just feel us a not only a comfort in that name but we feel a security in that name today we feel Lord the the security and that peace that that comes because we have lifted our hands and subjected ourself to the word we have acknowledged your word Lord that we want our homes to be just like you want them to be Lord I pray that you would bless us in the days to come that have such an interest about our homes that we would spend more time in prayer that when we read the Bible that we would read it with the intent of learning how to better please you in our homes that when we we listen to the tapes we read your word and we pray that we'd have an intent how we could better respect one another in our homes and that we could be to others what we're Desiring them to be to us help us not to wait to have a perfect setting to perfectly please you help us not to to wait to be in loveed before we to love one another but I I pray oh God you see my hand lifted Lord would you bless our homes with your spirit I pray you see our hearts desire we've not have been perfect Lord there things that we all need to get in order and Lord we're standing in prayer with Hezekiah Lord you see our heart's desire that we want to walk with you I pray that you'd hear our prayer tonight Lord that you could send better that Assurance like you sent it back to Hezekiah that You' heard our prayer that you would bless our homes that you will your presence will be felt your peace will be felt your joy will be felt your love will be felt because you will be the king of our homes we honor you Lord we give you ourselves and we thank you for this Grace this power through the Lord Jesus Christ we thank you in your name
