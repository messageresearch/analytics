have privileges of in the united states you know we have doctors we have insurance most of the insurance but when you know you get over in india you get in one of these uh countries that don't have and all they have is their faith you know they don't have and sometimes that you know when you've been on the mission field you realize that sometimes we have it way too good and uh we don't rely on

throughout the world like i said for all these countries that we really unless you've been on the mission field unless you've done anything you really don't get a real good grasp of how they live and

bless you may be seated [Applause] amen i grateful for our moms today it's getting harder and harder we got more things to contend with yes well god bless you let's stand together for opening scripture in genesis chapter 2 we want to entitle this message spiritual mothers how many spiritual mothers do we have here spiritual mothers let me see your hand if you consider yourself a spiritual mother praise the lord for you that did not raise your hand there are things in this message for you i don't want you to think you're here in vain amen before we begin reading here in genesis chapter 2 let's look to the author of this precious word heavenly father what a privilege it is for us when we bow our head and approach you in prayer that we have a revelation of who we're talking to you're not just some thought out there some unknown some question lord you've revealed yourself to us that you are a heavenly father and we thank you today that we can approach you as your children our father in heaven how great thou art lord we invite your presence in the revealing of the word now we thank you for these beautiful songs of worship and praise and lord we're grateful lord for the mothers that have brought us up and did the very best that we could even as our brother ron has said lord we've all given our mothers a hard time lord we're thankful that there's been goodness in them and mercies and love to help us along the way today we thank you for being a spiritual guide for us lord lord we're helpless without you unless you come and reveal this simple message to us today lord we would be lacking and but we know that you can make up the difference amen bless this word to our ears lord take these lips of clay and lord just use them for your honor and glory we love you thank you for these things ask your blessings now in jesus precious name we pray amen amen genesis chapter 2 starting with verse number 21 and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her un to the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man amen and then chapter 2 verse number 20 i mean chapter 3 right over chapter 3 verse number 20 and adam called his wife and and adam called his wife's name eve because she was the mother of all living amen amen god bless you may be seated the dictionary definition of a mother is a female who has given birth to offspring amen and i don't care how much a man wants to be a woman these days or how much he wants to act like a woman or how he may change his physical or autonomy of his body to match that of a woman he will never be able to bring forth offspring like a woman amen because that's what god that god created her that way to bring forth offspring you're something in the nature of a woman to be a mother brother brenham said but does it that it if she doesn't mother a child she'll most likely want to mother a dog or a cat or some animal right it's just in the nature that god created in her to mother something and we see it manifested even in an early age as most of you know we we had five girls we have five girls and when they were young we often witnessed them mothering adoles a baby doll just being a real mother to them it's the cutest thing it was so cute their their instinct inside of them is to cuddle and to hold them to feed them to to bottle them they literally eventually came up with dowels that you could put water in them and the water would come out and they better change the diapers and they feel you know like but they would put cute outfits on them and put matching bowls they'd comb their hair and put matching hair clips in braid their hair sometimes and they'd sing songs and uh rock with them and rock them to sleep and then once they put them down this feet they never went back to see if they ever got up they were done playing at the time [Laughter] but they they loved to mother of course at that moment in their life they didn't realize what it takes to really mother a child yet her instinct only appealed to the part of mothering that brings pleasure and self-gratification that's why they were doing it and it's really no different for some mothers with children they only want a child so they can mother like a doll they're interested in the part of mothering that brings pleasure to themselves and self-gratification but have no idea what they're getting into they don't understand the necessary part of of doing things that does not bring pleasure that's still a part of mothering amen it's a pain-wrenching responsibility that can bring the worst out of a mother it can make a mother yell and scream and cry and beg for help with her child yes amen for some to the point that they before that baby is even born they want to abort the idea right yeah but a good mother is willing to take that pain wrenching responsibility of all their nonsense to see their child through to grow up to be a mature lady or son someday amen a good mother wants their children to listen to them any good mother would want that to follow their example and to be like them i was always i was raised mainly by a single parent my dad and i always question when he said to me do as i tell you to do not as i do he wanted to cover the bases but a good mother wants their child to think like them and to believe like these so they can make the right decisions in school and not get mixed up in the wrong things wants to be a perfect example for them we could say that a good mother would want their children to be brought up in the way that they should go now as a mother you can teach your children a lot of things but the most important thing that you can do as a mother is to teach them about jesus christ amen for jesus christ is the creator of who they are he is the giver of life of of them and to teach your child where they came from is the greatest thing that you could do because nowadays people grow up and they don't know who they are they're trying to find their identity trying to find what they belong to who are they right amen but when we can have a revelation that we will our our creator is jesus christ we belong to god it brings a stability and a foundation to our lives amen amen nothing's more important than the will of god deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 5 says and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might amen and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart right amen and thou shall teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sittest down in thy house and when thou walk is by the way and when the lie is down when that rises up it sounds like quite often we need to spend time teaching our children the ways of the lord and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and thou shall they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shall write them on the pulse of the house and on the gates everywhere that our children go they need to see the love of god in our lives because if we don't give them god they will never find the chances of them finding god are not very good because my neighbor doesn't really care the people at school don't really care the people at work just don't care it's not a bad thing to share jesus with our children amen now i know if you all feel like i do we feel like we failed as parents it's a real predominant emotional feeling but it is impossible to bring forth a perfect child it is impossible to be a perfect parent it doesn't matter to what extreme that you go to um children have to make their own decisions at their own time and go through the experiences that they go through in our little nest uh all my all of our sorry cheryl all of our little children uh they were all in the same nest we didn't have different nests we all had bible studies together we all eight together all have the same rules they all chose different paths yes and so we can't ever ever beat ourselves up for feeling like we failed as a parent because every parent feels that way in some way or another we have got to trust god that he makes up the difference [Music] not my dad and mom they never taught me the way to go and god found a way yes amen our faith is not in our parents our faith is in god amen now every mother has the hardest job in the world to bring up her children the way they should go we've heard behind every good man was a good mother a mother is always a mother and it seems like her work is never done sometimes the children have told us your work is done stop telling me what to do but there's always a need when you see your children in john chapter 19 verse 26 when jesus saw his mother hanging from the cross that just and the disciples standing by her whom he loved now notice john was the only one that recorded this he saith to his mother woman behold thy son here he was dying and he wanted his mother to take care of john just as if jesus was still going to be living didn't want to feel like something was missing just continue on it's inside of us to take care no matter what happens in life then say if he to his disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took onto his own took his own took her into his own home now notice john never said oh but jesus i already have a mother he didn't have that attitude and from that hour that disciple took her onto his own home our work isn't complete until god says it's complete we may want to quit god had created man for a purpose he created a woman for a purpose and that purpose was to fulfill his will which is the only way that god ever gets pleasure and gratification amen can you imagine your little girl putting a baby in a stroller and taking her down for a walk down the driveway and that little baby dollar just says hey no way get me out of here ain't doing this not only would it scare her and go what what's going on it would not be fulfilling the will of that little girl the only way that god ever gets pleasure is when we do his will not scream and kick and we want to do our own thing revelations chapter 4 verse 11. it says thou art worthy o lord how many believe the lord is worthy this morning to receive glory and honor and power i believe that's why we need to worship not only in the worship service but as the word is being preached because he is worthy for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created so why were you created real simple not a big mystery to bring glory and honor and pleasure to god god wants pleasure from his children colossians chapter 1 verse 16 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones dominions principalities or powers it just doesn't matter all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn of the dead that in all things he might have the saso he wants to say so he does not want us sitting here in church without him being first in our thoughts and our minds and our hearts he wants the preeminence you ever been sitting down and and uh somebody's sitting next to you and you want a little bit more room how about when two people are wanting to watch something and one wants to watch this and the other ones watch that how about when there's only so much food on the table and one wants somebody's got to get god wants the preeminence he created us nobody is here by chance amen god foresaw this day amen he put us here for a purpose and that purpose was to bring him glory and honor and pleasure and gratification amen now god sets out to have children genesis chapter 1 here verse 26 genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and god said let us make man in our own image after our likeness notice not somebody else's image not somebody else's likeness amen he wanted us to be like him and let them have dominion over the fish of the seas and over the fowls of the air and the cattle and over all all the earth and every creeping thing uh that creepeth upon the earth god wanted the man that he made in his image to have a dominion over everything else except god in his will so god created man in his own image the image of god created him male and female created he them so at the time that this original creation was created that man was both male and female it was the only time on earth a man could say or a person could say well i i think i'm a female or i think um i'm not sure yes sir because it's the only time that it it that that man was both that's right but something happened there was a uh uh in our opening scripture but let me first read this genesis chapter five verse one this is the book of the generations of adam in that day that god created man in his likeness in the likeness of god made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and he called their name adam not his name their name adam in the day that they were created amen genesis chapter 2 verse 21 and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fallen at him and he slept and he took one of the ribs and closed up the flesh thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bone flesh my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man and god took the feminist part of adam and placed it into eve and there was that attraction between man and woman right there there was something there that was associated with him to make them one that when they're separated they they weren't complete they weren't one right amen and then verse 28 of genesis chapter 1 and the lord and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful be multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and the fowls of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth genesis chapter 3 verse 20 and adam called his wife eve because she was the mother of all living god had something in his mind for adam and that was to replenish the earth to be fruitful to multiply that's what he told them to do did he not amen but now here's what we've got to understand even though adam was like a miniature god he would tell the mountains to move and they would move god did not want adam and eve having children outside of his will right now there should be so many more amen since it's a true statement god will he wanted them before before i wanted to multiply but it had to be by god's word by the spoken word amen and and not by their word adam was a very smart man very intelligent very high iq great memory he had to name all those animals i'd be saying cheryl what'd i name that one i forgot his mind though was so one with the mind of god right amen when adam saw this four-legged creature walking with a long neck he said i'll call him a giraffe and god said that's exactly what i was thinking about yeah yes sir when he saw this fat creature with a long snout so that's got to be an elephant i'll call him an elephant and god said that's exactly what was on my mind amen amen because god's thoughts were so much higher than what we're used to at that moment before the fall adam had the mind of the lord amen it was up there very high amen everything was beautiful and sublime in the garden amen all the decisions that adam made were right in line with bringing pleasure to god amen until eve wanted to do something that was not in the mind of god nor would it bring pleasure to god and what was that she wanted to be fruitful to multiply and replenish the earth without god's mind without god's authority and without god's will she wanted to have control of her life and make her own decisions and have the the children that she wanted to have right yeah the way she wanted to have she wanted to be like god in that sense no longer wanted to be created for god's pleasure but her own pleasure and her own will she wanted to have her own baby dow to control as if she was the creator of that life she had her own ideas she wanted your own way she was deceived into thinking that she was going to be just like god because that most subtle beasts told her said he shall be as gods right amen amen do your own will it's appealing to do your own will the thing is eve was not created to do her own will she was created to do the will of god amen amen not to bring forth and multiply after her own will but after god's own will right amen god didn't mess up when he said be fruitful multiply there was no mistake in that it was just how it was to be done every man that's born into this world outside of jesus christ has been born out of god's will they were born by the will of flesh not by the will of god jesus came to the earth as a sacrifice for our sinful selfish nature that we were born with we didn't care about god we didn't care about pleasing them we didn't care about giving gratify if we could just fit him in do some little thing we were probably okay with that and call that religion but our whole nature was selfish i want to do my own thing it was no longer so what do you want to do when you grow up oh i want to be a fireman i want to be a doctor i'll tell you so many things i wanted to be but none of them is i am born to bring pleasure to my creator none of them were that because that's not where my nature was he provided a way for us and he let us know he let me know he let you know he must be born again amen you must be born in a way that brings me pleasure that brings me gratification because how you sit you can't make it into heaven amen you can't even see the kingdom of god you can't understand the kingdom of god you need to be born again the way in my mind that i created adam and eve in the beginning according to my own image my own will you need to be born that way john chapter 3 verse 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life amen for god sent not his son into the world to condemn it that wasn't his purpose but that the world through him might be saved right amen and he that believeth in him is not condemned but he that believeth not he doesn't accept what god has done he's already condemned amen because you have not believed in the name of the only begotten son and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and men choose they love darkness right rather than light amen amen our choice of what we love makes the difference any person says i'm called i'm like this i can't do anything i'm stuck i am what i am that's a lie from the devil we have a choice we have a choice in the matter today amen amen god did not make robots he will not be uh ever uh labeled on the other side that uh he was someone that made robots that had to do for that even the angels in heaven that became devils he gave him a choice to leave if they wanted to i'll say today we're set free amen choosing to believe in the light believing in the love of god believing that god sent his only son for us now we're still instructed today just want to bring us today we're still instructed today to be fruitful to multiply and replenish the earth but not carnally not trying to bring pleasure to ourselves but to god now we have to work through a different set of circumstances but still the same instructions as before be fruitful be multiplied and replenish the earth he told his disciples the very same thing when he said come and i'll make you fishers of men that's right we have a chance to be spiritually fruitful to multiply and bring forth another child of god to replenish the earth with sons and daughters of god amen look in adam both there was male and female and eve was taken out of adam and god put that feminist spirit in every she became the one that bore the children the seed from abraham abraham from adam excuse me today we were in christ he took the feminist part out of him made us amen amen amen that's right that's right amen to bear the children amen amen it's through us but it's his will and then it's it's through us but it's his will you have not only received the life of god in you to become his bride but now you are carrying his seed amen the more you make love to god the more of seed will be inside of you the more of the seed that you have inside you the more fruitful you'll be the more you'll multiply what's inside of you and the more you'll replenish those of light precious faith amen amen they that win souls is wise come follow me and i'll make you fishers of men that's what he meant when he said go yell and multiply amen go yelp preach the word teach them to do all that i've commanded you along with you always even to the end amen he shall be witnesses of me both in jerusalem judea and samaria and to other most parts of the earth what is that all about it's about replenishing multiplying bringing four sons and daughters of god to a spiritual room a spiritual word to bringing forth spiritual sons and daughters in his own image we're all called to be spiritual mothers jesus told paul to that he would be turning many of those that were in darkness to light and today we are the people who were once in darkness but have come into the marvelous light today and our job is to spread that light yes well that light isn't john martin christ and when that light lives in us and it's really the light of christ he's given each and every one of us his seed and we need to go multiply it amen turn with me to second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 when we become born again we're born of god's nature to carry out his pleasure remember that we were created for his pleasure so somehow we've got to bring pleasure then the wonderful thing about those babies that are our girls mothered is that they always did what they told them to do now once in a while something would strike their mind and they'd want to whip that baby i i just don't know where they got that from all right second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17. therefore if any man be in christ he is something different yes amen not the same person he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new amen and this new describing this new thing it's all about god yes all things are of god now amen who has reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation now what do we do is that just between me and god did god tell adam and eve just stay as you are don't multiply just it's all about you and me no there was something inside of him that wanted them wanted them to multiply and have a family god wants a family he hasn't changed he's the same yesterday today and forever amen to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and it's committed unto us the word of reconciliation yes the ministry and the word amen now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ said be reconciled back to god amen that's our ministry now god has given that to every man that is a new creature amen now he even when peter and andrew and james and bartholomew and matthew and john when they were all chosen by jesus to be fishers of men he did not allow them to start that ministry until after they received his spirit in fact he gave them a warning tarry here until you be endue with power from on high amen then you shall be witnesses for it's me only way you can be a proper witness amen is when god witnesses himself it's they're going to hear it from the horse's mouth then that's right because my mouth is just going to fail my mouth is going to be next we're just humans we fail this morning i said are you ready to cut my hair to my lovely wife i said you said you were going to cut it before sunday she says i know i lied but when god does the witnessing god cannot lie amen he's a true witness amen that's why we need the holy ghost amen you cannot spend too much time seeking the holy ghost too much time knocking too much time asking amen but you can spend too little right you can be guilty of too little amen you cannot put too much assurance in getting more of the holy ghost this ministry that god has given to us will yield more children of god this ministry of reconciliation that he's given it will yield more children of god it will multiply children of god i'd like to talk about an example of bringing forth children of god as his bride being a spiritual mother and teaching god's children to love the lord their god with all their hearts turn with me if you would to first corinthians chapter 4 verse 5 15. first corinthians chapter 4 verse verse 15. just want to talk a little bit about an example of bringing forth children of god as his bride amen for though we have ten thousand instructors in christ yet have ye not many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel i have begotten you through the gospel the word begotten here means regenerate or procreate of the father but by the extension of the mother you go look that up we're just the extension of god he places his seed in us we share it with another heart they receive that word when they receive that word you are giving birth to that new life amen that's being changed you are building with god the kingdom of god amen you are part of the winning souls is wise yes it's all god but you're letting god use your body your mouth your mind your thoughts to bring forth more children of god paul was saying here i've begotten you i've regenerated i've procreated you through the gospel wherefore i beseech you be followers of me not 10 000 instructors in christ to help you follow me verse 17 says for this cause i've sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son now they weren't related in the flesh gospel but he was a faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ as i teach everywhere in every church when you thought about paul he was the same when you think about god he's the same when you think about children of god they should be the same yes different personalities sure we've got uh uh different attributes but god is the same yes the spirit of god is the same birth is being given spiritually god didn't make only one type of tree i mean some some trees you can plant and they grow like crazy fast some they just grow so slow they're already growing they're all different colors but it's the same god the same creator that's right children of god are our brothers and our sisters same family and the integral part that we play and multiplying the seed of god we play a part amen just as it happened naturally that's how it happens spiritually it's just in a spiritual you're no longer doing what you want to do to bring forth a child this morning i gave seven kisses to my wife for the seven children we had that's naturally but spiritually we need to spend time with jesus amen receive the seed inside amen so we can go share it with somebody so it means something who wants to be a mother that's just it's all about me you were created to replenish to multiply i love this word what an awesome responsibility to carry god's seed right inside your soul amen amen to bear god's seed and to watch it multiply to let god use you through the gospel to regenerate the nature of somebody else that you have a part to get them to think different because we're transformed amen by the renewing of our mind when you can get somebody to think differently it's okay we're all a salesman or something right most of the time we're selling herself but god told paul he says if you well god told brother branham if you can get the people to believe he told paul that it is your job to turn the people from darkness onto light we play a part in our talking and are convincing amen knowing the terror of the lord we persuade men persuade the way they think because we're interested in bringing forth the birth of of a son and daughter of god in the nature of god in the image of god with the desire of god amen everyone wants to be the bride of christ but very few want to receive his seed right amen it's one thing to want to be the bride and it's another to carry his seed and to bear children of the gospel amen in the message amen running from the presence of the lord brother brandon says too many christians today are soft and everything until they think all they have to do is just go join the church go on somewhere put their name on the book and do a little something maybe somebody they gotta jump up and down or something like that and you call it christianity that's talking about sons and daughters now he said christianity is an everyday rugged life right amen i just want you to remember the things that are not pleasurous about being a christian here christianity is an everyday rugged life living for god in this present world bringing pleasure to god not ourselves it is a constant burning of the fire and the love of god in the heart that sets you of fire and puts you out yonder with people and making converts to christ he calls this christian responsibility we were called to replenish to multiply that's right to bring four sons and daughters that's our reason it's not a choice friends not to god we can say yes or no to it but not according to god's will i don't think there's been one new creature that said no i'm not going to do it right i believe there's been a lot of people who thought they were new creatures and said i'm not going to do it a lot of people have been deceived you know the new birth doesn't happen in a second the complete new birth just think it takes nine months for a baby to develop inside and that whole nine months you can shout i've got a baby inside it's coming one day it's going to be born it's going to be just like me it's going to look just like me and it comes out and it's just completely different wrong eyes wrong hair what's going on sometimes no hair and it's a girl and you're wondering what's going to happen when they buy wigs when they're young but eventually through time there sees some resemblance and you know how the lord is brother bruce a lot of parents looks just like me doesn't even look like me a lot of times the lord wants to encourage us it does not yet appear but we know yes we're going to be just like him [Music] i think it's a beautiful thing for us to go to stand and and count ourselves as a christian as the bride of christ even when we fail miserably our testimony needs to be i believe yes i don't i'm not saying being a hypocrite not caring but if a righteous man falls seven times seven times he'll get back up yes we he's only is going to act on the profession of our faith abraham didn't have a child but he believed he had to believe so long before it happened can you imagine having to go that long on the bride on the bride i'm not even acting like the way you should but you need to you need to be here at church you need to be doing everything you can to do what the bride does amen we need to take the words that are preached and begin to apply them to our life and this word that we're hearing today we need to put some emphasis in multiplying sons and daughters of god that is in your power that is in your control you do not say well this i got deal with coven i've got so much time and i'm working and i can't you know it just i don't believe that trash i'm here god is here amen so is the devil and he's given you every excuse in the world why you don't have to bring forth a son and daughter of god amen only thing brother brandon said this if he could just get one man in his hand here lord here lord take my life use it bring forth a son and daughter for you amen now well you just it's meant to be does it come by my way just lay there and just say give it to me give it to me no no if paul had to get if noah had to get all the rotten tomatoes and eggs thrown at him for 120 years if if if paul had to get beat up and talked about and everything else he had to go through just to bring forth timothy my beloved in the gospel i've begotten one soul worth ten thousand worlds and we don't got time come on think about that you know what's needed we need to spend some time with her husband not just on the phone hey what's going on can you make sure you meet my knees my bills are coming yeah i mean we need to go from the kitchen hearing the gospel start having a a a sit down conversation in the living room get a little bit more in depth about the time that we're spending on other things and work our way to the bedroom we need to receive the seed of god that burden for our soul [Music] i just i just i don't feel i just i've just got so many things going john you don't understand dr jesus can take care of it whatever you got going on whatever is so hard whatever reason you think it's impossible for you to bear a seat of god who take care of it right amen dr jesus amen the friend says it's easy to go the way the world goes it's easy to flow down the stream in other words it's easy not to take on the responsibility of a hard rugged life winning souls most of this world is living a hard rugged life barely making it through but it's not for jesus amen they're stuck in their own world they don't got time it's easy the way the world goes the way the world goes it doesn't win souls it's not out there trying to win a soul just interested in taking care of itself their own future in other words it's just easy to come to church and say i've done my job this week brother and said you're just floating with the world easy the way it goes he says you don't want to do that no sir but you must accept your responsibility must accept the responsibility what's he talking about you must accept that you got to get out there and start burying children because you were called right from the beginning to replenish to multiply amen not just to get saved and say i'm saved i don't have to go to hell that wasn't the plan that's what was in it for you but you were still created for his pleasure we ought to be so excited about this word our first responsibility is to stir up the love of god in our heart get so in love with god a constant burning of the fire and love of god in the heart that's the first thing yes amen the second is the responsibility to let him place his seed inside of you the seed of the word is not just for you to become more like him but a burden to see god multiplied in another's person's life beside you that's the part of god that we don't pay attention to very much you're here because of that part you are here because of that part of god in other words god didn't just die for you right he died for your brothers and sisters amen amen and he loves them as much as he loves you and we need to love them as much as we love god eternal life is living for other people's souls for their soul that's that constant burning put you out yonder winning converting souls to jesus christ multiplying children of god those of light precious faith that's what eternal life is there was someone that are working um he makes cheesecakes so i wanted to do something for my wife and make her cheesecake for mother's day not me but buy it you know it's easier to buy than it was the sacrifices most ever paid for for a cheesecake so i wasn't a great sacrifice on my part but that's not living for others there's no soul involved there it's a nice good deed it's encouraging it helps it's but it's not living for others living for others is when you stop your life and you're talking about another person's soul amen when you're doing something that's going to bring that soul to a place of conversion otherwise you could do live your whole life for somebody their soul never be converted and it will absolutely be in vain at the end of the day right amen so living for others is not naturally let our conversation be more about getting somebody saved brothers brother said that his deep love his love down deep inside of us should be a constant burning of the fire and love of god in their heart that doesn't stop with us doesn't stop with us it should put us out yonder with people making converts to christ to be fruitful multiply and to replenish the earth with god's children i'll tell you i just cringe when people say and my children you know i just want to be like you you do not want that dream you do not want that no matter what what you think you see i want to hear you say i want to be like jesus no stains in that the ministry that god has given to us will yield more children of god right we just must accept the responsibility of it second corinthians chapter 11 verse 2 where we have to multiply quickly for i'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ why does god want us as a chaste virgin he doesn't want any other seed inside of us he wants to place his seed inside of us for i fear lest by any means as the serpent begowed eve to a subtly so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that's in christ yes eve was hooked by the devil's thoughts in thinking that she could she could have control of her life and she would still be okay with god and it's the same thing the devil tells us every day right that's true we're at church i don't have to do that that's just brother john he certainly doesn't understand where i'm at what's going on i just want to say you don't understand who's talking thank you very much if we don't use the word we don't come up with the word we're saying our own words that's okay but how can we disagree with the word and say where did not the prophet say the holy ghost will never deny the word right amen so if you've got the holy ghost in you you can't wait to say amen to what you just heard amen amen now your flesh don't want to but that spirit inside you greater is he that's in you than the outside man amen amen god wants to place his seed inside of you he wants to see you bring forth another son and daughter of god you're special you've been called you've been predestinated by his foreign knowledge you are elect you are chosen for what to go replenish to multiply and to have dominion do not let any devil tell you that you can do what you want to do not dominion in the flesh dominion over all spirits right amen you'll cast out devils in my name dominion amen praise god amen first peter chapter 2 verse 9 we'll have to go quickly but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light amen which in times past were not a people but are now the people of god which have not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy we're sitting in a different place than we were before we knew christ amen and today if you feel in your heart that you're not where you need to be in child in christ you still need to believe that you've been chosen you need to start walking in that direction amen don't wait till you do a lot of great things before you say oh yeah i think i'm there now no don't do that but don't have the attitude if i can't get there don't have the attitude of i guess i just am what i am no believe what god says about you that is the seed of god i'll tell you this if you're born in the image of god you will believe just like god believes it's by faith not by sight everything that god created was invisible when he created it it wasn't even in there there was no proof that it was going to happen but he believed it and it happened and his children are the same way amen whether you're for healing or whatever it is that you need you've got to believe it when you don't see it and that is a good evidence that you are in his image and believing it right luke chapter 1 verse 26 luke chapter 1 verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph by the house of david and the virgin's name was mary you all know the story and the angel came in unto her and said hell lord highly favored the lord is with thee blessed are thou among women amen and when she saw him she was troubled her heart sin and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said and here fear not mary for you have found favor with god yes today you are here for the reason of you found favor with god amen and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus what are you here for to receive god's word his son into your hearts luke chapter 1 verse 39 and mary arose in those days and went to the hill a country with haste into a city of judah and entered into the house of zechariah and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spake out with the love voice can you imagine being filled with the holy ghost what's going to happen to you you're just going to start speaking the word of god so this is something prophetic is coming out of here blessed same message that the angel told her blessed earth now among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and when says this to me that the mother of the lord should come unto me for lo as soon as the voice of thy saltation sounded in my ears the baby leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believed speaking of mary now speaking of you now for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord now it's important for you to believe that what you're hearing is from the lord and not from a man you don't want my performance i'm graded pretty bad i'm weighed in the balance and found mining amen but you need to believe in the word of the lord simple to believe what god says about you and through that belief you can become what he said it may bypass your feelings because when mary received the word there was no feelings no emotion no oh this is great this is exciting it wasn't any of that in fact her testimony is how can this be i have not known a man so she received the woo the word inside of her without sensation without emotion without feeling right she was sitting in church saying be it unto me amen so be it unto me according to that word amen we can receive the word the same way amen we can leave here knowing something happened because i believed it i never doubted it i took it with me and in time your belly your life will begin to show there'll be rivers of of living water springing forth out of you it'll show that something happened nine months from now you'll be able to look back and say yeah i told you nine months ago i said amen i believed at church amen don't try to walk out of here you know the only way that you know you received is something you flew off the fell down dances this no no just believe the word sure everybody likes that i like that let it happen we all can fall over get back up fall over here get back up dance in the spirit twirl around but you know none of that means anything what means everything is receive the word of god because that will change you that will get you out there making converts to christ it's inside of god for us to be fruitful to multiply you are the bride of christ you are the wife of christ what is a bride what does a wife do brings four children to who your your father your husband our heavenly father god almighty amen amen he's the firstborn of many brethren what greater privilege you women okay put yourself in the spot that mary was what an honor would be to have to give birth and she didn't really fully realize what was happening even after it happened she still that testimony your father and and and and your mother has been looking for you denouncing where jesus even came from but through a period of time i sure she could look back and knew that was truly a son that had been born without sin the son of god wouldn't it be glorious to be that woman now we know the catholic church they they've they made some thing out of it that they shouldn't have right right but wouldn't you like to bear the word of god today in a different form to take the word that you have been given so preciously by god through the power of a revelation into your heart and to take that precious word that's been revealed to you and bring it to someone who's just crazy out of there doesn't know nothing about god doesn't care about god and you bring them the light of the word and their nature gets changed all because of you there ain't no greater calling friends no greater honor we've been created for that purpose let's stand together share the gospel of jesus christ god wants us to be spiritual mothers to make converts to christ not complex it's not hard it can be a little time consuming i think who owns a car free and clear who owns a car free and clear okay big brother larry first brother has a car he owns it free and clear not leasing it doesn't bother anybody if i say brother larry i'll give you twenty thousand nine hundred dollars for that car would you sell it so the answer to that is yes i'll be praying for my pastor when i'm done with this deal but not before after i bought that car that car belongs to me the lawyer can't come back and say now i want to do something with that car no he's going to take his twenty thousand dollars and buy another one and still have 15 left over god bought and purchased our souls amen our lives our bodies it was well worth the deal oh yeah yeah sure lord any i want to be saved we can't go back on the deal amen we were born to bring him pleasure so let him take your life and use it the way he wants to yes amen amen it'll bring glory and honor you never ever regret winning someone to the lord you'll never go a hundred thousand years and say you know what it probably really wasn't worth it on the other side but everything else will be in vain everything else will come tune and only what's done for christ will last amen that's our heart amen with every head bound every eye closed what if there's someone here today that say john would you pray for me i want god to use me in this way god bless these hands god sees you amen amen heavenly father we come to you with all of our hearts believing your word believing why we were created lord we have a greater understanding why our flesh needs to be crucified because it isn't our desire to serve you the way you want us to lord we pray that you give us the grace to deny our flesh that we may be able to fulfill your will i pray that you take our lives i pray that you begin to multiply sons and daughters through us through our time to our mind to our burden it's hard it's rugged may that burning fiery love of god begin to grow inside each of us burn up all the dross sanctify the whole put us out yonder lord on our jobs the supermarkets wherever you would take us perhaps a phone call a text that uses to win converts for
