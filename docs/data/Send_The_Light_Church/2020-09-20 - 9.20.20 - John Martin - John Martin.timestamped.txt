[0:00] put it into our body to identify who we
[0:02] are
[0:05] and where we're at at the same time
[0:09] this chip could have enough information
[0:12] that it has all your banking
[0:14] your account your identification you
[0:17] won't bow to buy or sell without it
[0:19] makes sense doesn't it
[0:23] is it a monster computer in brussels
[0:25] that knows everything
[0:28] is it the barcode that we see
[0:31] on every item that we buy
[0:35] is it a universal id card or a health
[0:38] card
[0:39] or a hidden dna marker that they're
[0:41] going to put in a vaccine
[0:45] is it tied to a credit card or our
[0:47] social security card
[0:51] there's a lot of thoughts out there
[0:53] there's actually a number of things
[0:55] and names that end
[0:59] or add up to 666 and i want to show you
[1:01] one of them right now
[1:03] on the screen if ain could put it up
[1:05] there
[1:06] here are the titles of the roman
[1:08] catholic church that add up to 666.
[1:14] and you can see uh they're in in latin
[1:17] but what it means i tell you in church
[1:19] or the vikar of god's son the head of
[1:22] the clergy
[1:24] latin kingdom latin speaking man all
[1:27] these are
[1:28] adding up to 666 and
[1:31] there are so many more
[1:35] oh i've got pages and pages and pages
[1:38] of things that add up to 666.
[1:43] i want to draw our attention to one
[1:45] vicarious
[1:46] philiadi and most of us that are in the
[1:49] message have
[1:50] heard of that but the wikipedia
[1:52] encyclopedia said the vicarious
[1:54] philiadiliae
[1:56] means the viker or the representative
[1:59] of the son of god you can actually find
[2:02] this
[2:02] in most common dictionaries
[2:07] but uh it refers to simon peter a leader
[2:11] of the early church
[2:12] was regarded as the first pope by the
[2:15] catholic church and he was
[2:17] since he was given the keys right jesus
[2:20] gave him the keys to the kingdom
[2:22] jesus was gone and peter is conversation
[2:25] when you're gone strengthened
[2:27] thy brethren and you have the keys to
[2:30] the kingdom acts 2 38
[2:33] he he preached the keys so they kind of
[2:35] went to seed on that
[2:38] and every pope that came along became
[2:41] the next
[2:42] in line viker
[2:46] is a person who acts in place of another
[2:49] or instead of so we might look at that
[2:51] is the instead
[2:53] of the son of god another way of looking
[2:56] at it
[2:57] is uh the substituting for or the place
[3:00] of another
[3:04] read accounts where people have saw the
[3:06] crown
[3:07] war by the pope with the words written
[3:10] on it
[3:11] right there's been others that have
[3:13] identified it
[3:15] many accounts of it in the catholics
[3:18] writing i mean i've got
[3:19] pages and pages and pages that their own
[3:23] catholics talk about it
[3:31] brother branham said in the message
[3:33] questions and answers he said well
[3:36] it isn't over the latin the latin words
[3:38] isn't over the vatican city
[3:40] it's over the throne of the pope where
[3:42] he sits on
[3:43] his throne and he he wrote up their
[3:45] vicarious philly idea i
[3:47] if you wish to in the morning i'll bring
[3:49] it out everything and put it
[3:51] on a piece of paper and if you want i'll
[3:53] bring it to you in the morning where you
[3:54] can spell it out
[3:56] in the roman letters vicara's
[3:58] philadelphi the word means instead of
[4:00] the son of god
[4:01] he is the successor of the son of god
[4:04] the catholic church believes that peter
[4:06] was the first pope he is the successor
[4:08] of jesus christ
[4:09] which is an heir yes
[4:13] all right then they claim that every
[4:15] pope following him is the successor
[4:18] and the pope now that is now is the
[4:20] successor of jesus christ
[4:23] and there it's rolled up there a
[4:25] successor
[4:26] of jesus christ
[4:29] take the roman letters and just write x
[4:32] for ten and v
[4:33] for five and so forth and spell out
[4:36] vicarious filial id and draw a line
[4:38] and you've got 666 write it out and find
[4:42] out
[4:44] now i've got a quite a bit of reading
[4:47] that i have to do
[4:47] so at this point i'm going to say you
[4:50] don't even have to pay attention
[4:52] i'll let you know when you need to pay
[4:54] attention
[4:57] viker of christ the title used almost
[5:00] exclusively of the bishops of rome
[5:03] as a successor of peter therefore the
[5:05] one of the church who particularly takes
[5:07] the place of christ but used also
[5:09] bishops in the general and even even a
[5:12] priest
[5:12] first used by roman sidna of ad495
[5:18] refers to pope oh and this list i'm
[5:20] telling you
[5:21] it there's so much in the catholic
[5:25] writings
[5:28] i don't have time to read any of that
[5:31] amen
[5:32] the crown represents power and of the
[5:35] authority
[5:36] of the pope many of you have heard of my
[5:40] own personal testimony
[5:42] as i was talking to a priest and he told
[5:44] me that the pope
[5:45] has the power to change the word of god
[5:50] amen and that is what just changed my
[5:54] thoughts about church and afterwards
[5:57] god said that i'm not in the church i am
[6:00] in the word that's right
[6:06] that's why the emphasis in here is not
[6:08] the church but the word
[6:13] wherever he goes the insignia of john
[6:16] paul ii
[6:17] is displayed embolizing on the pope
[6:20] mobile
[6:21] hung from stages and on high as the post
[6:25] at the outdoor masses the various parts
[6:28] of the
[6:29] papal symbol show below and i didn't
[6:32] put that up on the screen but it's has
[6:34] the triple crown and the two keys
[6:37] referring to peter having the keys
[6:40] the red cross there
[6:44] all means something various parts of the
[6:47] papal symbols shown below describe the
[6:49] power of the papal
[6:50] pepper see one who as pope
[6:53] leo the 13th explained occupies the
[6:57] place
[6:58] on earth of god almighty
[7:02] most notable in the papal
[7:05] papal emblem is the terror of the triple
[7:09] crown
[7:09] until recently during the coronation of
[7:12] a new pope
[7:13] the tierra was placed on the head
[7:17] with the words receive
[7:20] the terror adorned with three crowns
[7:24] and know that you are the father of
[7:26] princes
[7:27] and of kings the guide of the world the
[7:30] viker of the savior jesus christ
[7:34] in this age where its appearance before
[7:37] masses
[7:38] and media and so forth the last two
[7:40] popes chose not
[7:41] to have this crowning ceremony including
[7:43] their coronation
[7:45] however lest we think they have
[7:47] abandoned the incredible claims of this
[7:48] crown
[7:49] it is displayed everywhere as the
[7:50] symbols of papacy
[7:53] therefore since it is in still
[7:55] widespread use it is good to understand
[7:57] the meaning of the three crowns the
[7:58] first circle of the crown symbolizes the
[8:00] pope's
[8:01] universal
[8:10] e-p-i-s-c-o-p-a-t-e
[8:12] for sure when you need her this means
[8:15] that he claims to be the ruler all
[8:19] over all the church of christ as
[8:22] priestly power including the power to
[8:25] forgive
[8:26] sins must come through him
[8:29] and his agents
[8:33] this is why the current pope john paul
[8:34] ii felt justified in reminding us
[8:38] that you should be in submission to him
[8:40] in order to be saved
[8:42] no salvation outside the church of rome
[8:45] quite simple that makes this makes
[8:48] spiritual slaves of nearly one billion
[8:50] people who christ died for
[8:56] the viker of christ is actually the same
[8:58] as
[9:00] antichrist
[9:04] with the same results the pope
[9:05] substitutes himself
[9:07] in place of god and earth and that's
[9:08] exactly what the meaning of antichrist
[9:10] is
[9:10] amen
[9:14] said in the in 63 and christ in the
[9:16] mystery of god revealed he says
[9:18] and a man that is a god-sent man would
[9:21] never stay
[9:22] in a denomination after hearing this
[9:25] or seeing what it is
[9:29] if he's got enough to go out and look at
[9:31] it certainly see
[9:32] i don't say that critically i say that
[9:34] truthfully see
[9:36] that's right the revelation notice in
[9:38] the last days lucifer is doing the same
[9:40] thing can you see it the devil's doing
[9:43] the same thing
[9:44] building a high bred church a hybrid
[9:47] a high bred members high blood and
[9:49] knowledge instead of the word of god by
[9:51] intellectual men
[9:52] instead of born again men building an
[9:55] intellectual kingdom
[9:56] that will outshine christ little
[9:59] bitty flock see what is that
[10:04] what is that did that fallen
[10:07] angels yes the bible said it was fallen
[10:10] angels who listened to lucifer instead
[10:12] of christ
[10:14] instead of christ who they once belonged
[10:18] to
[10:18] is that right now listen close fallen
[10:21] angels
[10:23] what kind of fallen angels luther wesley
[10:26] catholics pentecostal who kept not their
[10:29] first
[10:30] estate like the angels did
[10:33] and it fell into an organization yes
[10:37] like lucifer's main hold on nicaea
[10:40] and what they have done they organized a
[10:42] great and medical association of
[10:44] ministers to make it
[10:46] a church and orders like it see
[10:49] it's lucifer at his work
[10:55] strong brother brandon said in the
[10:58] message presuming he said the world
[11:00] councils of churches
[11:01] is forming the image of the beast
[11:13] i'm sure you're paying attention now and
[11:15] nobody's taking notes everybody just
[11:16] takes notes at my boring subject when
[11:18] they're falling asleep
[11:23] all right i was i thought there'd be a
[11:25] lot more chuckles with that one but the
[11:28] pulpit is not a place
[11:30] to joke so i deserve that one
[11:33] when we think of the mark of the beast
[11:35] much time has been spent emphasizing
[11:38] the name of the beast or
[11:42] the number of his name so it's either
[11:44] been the denominations
[11:45] the catholic church the pope or 666
[11:49] that's what the
[11:49] emphasis has been and little emphasis
[11:53] has been put on the wisdom of the mark
[11:56] of the beast
[11:57] on the wisdom part which is the same
[12:01] as a man
[12:04] same as the number of man here's wisdom
[12:06] let him that understand
[12:08] count the number of the beast for it is
[12:09] the number of a man and his number
[12:12] is 666. so it's about the man
[12:17] let's bear that in mind as we go through
[12:20] this
[12:21] this second beast exercised all the
[12:24] power
[12:25] of the first beast which by the way
[12:29] way killed 68 million protestants yes
[12:33] the second beast calls the earth to
[12:35] worship
[12:36] the first beast whose wound
[12:40] deadly wound was healed amen the second
[12:43] beast
[12:43] deceived the people to make an image
[12:46] unto the first beast
[12:47] amen the second beast had power to give
[12:51] life to the first
[12:52] beast so the motive of the second beast
[12:56] is to get back to the plan of the first
[12:59] beast
[13:02] to get the world to worship him
[13:06] now remember lucifer's motive from the
[13:08] beginning
[13:10] was to get worship amen
[13:14] to get people to worship him to get at
[13:16] that time
[13:17] angels to worship him instead of god
[13:22] get it instead of god i will exalt my
[13:26] throne
[13:26] above the throne of god i want to be
[13:28] like the most high
[13:30] i want everybody looking up to me
[13:36] now nobody
[13:39] is going to worship second string
[13:43] over god
[13:46] which is not going to happen
[13:49] no one in their right mind is going to
[13:51] lead the creator
[13:54] of all living to worship something that
[13:56] cannot create
[13:59] so what does he do he makes an image
[14:03] unto himself he exercises the power
[14:07] towards his motive to be exalted so
[14:10] that's his
[14:10] end game satan can't create
[14:13] he's been if i could say it like this
[14:15] he's had to be content with not being
[14:17] able to create
[14:18] so what does he do he perverts what god
[14:21] has already created for himself
[14:24] and he causes them to look to the image
[14:28] instead of god he causes everyone else
[14:32] to turn away
[14:33] from god's will to their own will
[14:39] that's why we must clearly see what's
[14:41] happening
[14:42] when we have the satanic urge to get
[14:45] people to look at us
[14:47] instead of pointing them to the glory of
[14:49] jesus christ
[14:51] [Music]
[14:53] amen
[14:56] he manipulates all people both small and
[14:59] great rich and poor free and bond
[15:01] and causes all to receive a mark in
[15:04] their right hand or their foreheads
[15:08] people on earth will not be able
[15:12] to function without the image of the
[15:14] beast
[15:17] that image could be the mark of the
[15:19] beast the name of the beast
[15:22] the number of the beast
[15:26] we find in verse 18 there's a clue with
[15:28] wisdom
[15:29] and understanding that the number
[15:32] of this horrible beast is the same
[15:36] number as a man
[15:40] so i think we need to dig into the man
[15:45] the word beast means wild
[15:49] dangerous brutal
[15:52] savage
[15:57] same as a man
[15:59] [Laughter]
[16:01] that word mark is a badge
[16:04] of servitude
[16:10] satan wants us to be his servant
[16:18] and since we're not just going to
[16:22] outright
[16:23] live a life and worship the devil
[16:30] as long as we worship our will and do
[16:33] what we want to do we are serving the
[16:36] devil
[16:40] because there's only two wills gods and
[16:43] everybody else's
[16:44] [Music]
[16:46] and i know we don't want to put ours
[16:48] with satan because we feel we don't do
[16:50] horrible things but when we're not doing
[16:52] god's will it's horrible
[16:56] amen
[17:00] you can give the right hand a fellowship
[17:02] to a man-made denomination
[17:06] and you can agree in your forehead of
[17:08] what that what they're saying or what
[17:09] they're preaching
[17:14] but this mark is the same mark that's
[17:16] inside of a man
[17:20] satan perverted what god created in the
[17:22] garden
[17:23] by getting man to choose to do his own
[17:26] will
[17:26] instead of there's the mark right there
[17:30] instead of god's will
[17:32] instead of the the son of god's will it
[17:35] started right there
[17:38] and every man that's been born since
[17:41] that time
[17:42] is in the very image of the beast
[17:46] he's not the beast but he's in the image
[17:48] of the beast
[17:51] and that the thing that's in common is
[17:53] that man is born
[17:54] with his own will
[17:58] i just want that to soak in amen every
[18:01] man was conceived in sin
[18:03] shaping in iniquity speaking lies and
[18:06] doing his
[18:06] own will you didn't have to
[18:09] teach him to do that you couldn't stop
[18:11] him from doing that
[18:14] and remember satan was perfect until
[18:17] iniquity was found in him
[18:20] not doing what he knew he should be
[18:24] doing
[18:24] which was putting god first
[18:29] he decided to put himself first his will
[18:32] first his pleasures
[18:33] his plans his future first it became
[18:37] first
[18:38] that's what was found in his heart and
[18:40] that's when perfection became perversion
[18:45] and if you look at the church today
[18:49] pleasures
[18:54] more than pleasures of god lovers of
[18:57] themselves
[18:58] more than lovers of god right inside the
[19:01] church
[19:02] is the mark of the beast
[19:04] [Music]
[19:07] and so what does satan do he makes an
[19:10] image
[19:11] like unto himself here's cain
[19:16] just doing his own thing god comes to
[19:19] him and says
[19:20] you know if you if you do well you're
[19:22] going to be accepted
[19:23] but if you don't sin lies at the door
[19:27] right amen he
[19:30] chose not to do the right thing
[19:33] amen iniquity
[19:42] he perverts a perfect creature to do
[19:46] his own will above the will
[19:49] of his creator and that's what he did
[19:51] with eve
[19:53] and that's why jesus prayed when he when
[19:56] he was struggling with his
[19:58] will he prayed lord not my
[20:01] will thine be done amen
[20:05] that's why he taught his disciples to
[20:07] pray thy
[20:08] will be done on earth as it is in heaven
[20:13] amen
[20:16] iniquity is simply not doing the things
[20:19] that we
[20:20] should be doing
[20:24] it's the easiest sin to commit
[20:28] a man's life is shapened
[20:31] into a life of iniquity
[20:35] our thoughts of sinning are usually
[20:37] centered around
[20:38] not doing bad things because we know
[20:42] bad things are sin but we put little
[20:45] emphasis
[20:46] on not doing good things is really not
[20:49] that bad
[20:56] as long as i'm not doing bad things
[21:04] people in the denominations think that
[21:06] they're safe
[21:07] as long as they're not in the catholic
[21:08] church
[21:12] people in this message think they're
[21:13] safe as long as they're not in the
[21:14] denomination
[21:15] [Music]
[21:19] people right inside this message still
[21:22] have the mark of the beast
[21:24] they're still in their own will they've
[21:27] really never
[21:28] decided to put gods first
[21:34] now they don't mind paying tithes they
[21:36] don't mind changing their clothes
[21:39] but they're not giving up their will
[21:41] their will is instead of gods
[21:52] these things aren't good enough
[21:56] a change of clothes
[21:59] or giving up 10 that you never had to
[22:01] give up before
[22:05] nothing will be accepted outside of
[22:07] god's perfect will for your life
[22:08] nothing that's why jesus said you must
[22:11] be born
[22:12] again amen not you must pay your tithes
[22:16] not you must change your clothes you
[22:17] must take care of your hair
[22:19] your hair you must be born again
[22:24] amen or you'll never enter heaven amen
[22:27] you're just not going to enter heaven
[22:29] with your will right
[22:30] that's the very reason he put flaming
[22:33] swords
[22:35] to protect the tree of life you're not
[22:37] coming into life with your will
[22:44] we have to be born of god's will
[22:49] that's why peter said in first peter
[22:52] chapter 1 verse 23 being born again not
[22:55] of the corruptable seed but the
[22:56] incorruptable
[22:57] by the word of god which liveth and
[22:59] abideth
[23:01] forever we must be born
[23:05] of the word of god
[23:08] not just god's word saying you're born
[23:10] again
[23:14] the whole nature needs to change
[23:20] the corruptable seed that we were born
[23:23] with is just
[23:24] the seed to do our own will
[23:31] paul said that when we're truly born
[23:33] again of an
[23:34] incorruptible seed that there's a nature
[23:37] change
[23:38] yes there's a nature change with our
[23:40] will
[23:41] he describes it in second corinthians
[23:43] chapter 5 verse 17
[23:45] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[23:48] a new creature
[23:50] old things are passed away behold all
[23:53] things become new and look at this
[23:55] wonderful verse
[23:56] and all things are of god
[23:59] the emphasis is all things are of god
[24:02] we're born
[24:04] by the seed of god the will of god
[24:07] it's incorruptible it is incorruptible
[24:10] the will of god is
[24:11] incorruptible the seed of god is
[24:14] incorruptible
[24:16] but you know what our will is
[24:17] corruptable it gets us in trouble every
[24:19] time we use it
[24:21] every time we say i'm going to handle it
[24:22] my way i'm going to do it my way
[24:25] corruption comes something happens
[24:33] amen the devil has made a hybrid church
[24:39] they still believe in god as their
[24:40] savior
[24:42] but all things don't have to be of god
[24:47] they still believe in god as their
[24:49] provider
[24:50] but all things don't have to be done
[24:52] according to his will
[24:54] it's a carnal church without the
[24:57] complete new birth
[25:00] it's an intellectual church figuring out
[25:03] what they can get away with and what
[25:05] they can't
[25:08] and you're not going to outsmart the
[25:12] devil
[25:14] you need to just say amen to the word of
[25:16] god and stay with it
[25:19] lean not to your own understanding
[25:25] god knows his sheep
[25:28] paul told timothy in second timothy
[25:30] chapter 2 verse 19
[25:32] nevertheless the foundation of god
[25:35] stands sure having this seal
[25:37] the lord knoweth them that are his can
[25:38] you say amen
[25:40] but we don't want to stop there
[25:43] if you're his sheep and let everyone
[25:48] that says i believe in jesus yes sir
[25:52] if you name the name of christ what are
[25:54] we to do
[25:56] depart from iniquity
[26:01] depart from
[26:04] i know i should do this
[26:09] but i kind of don't want to
[26:13] do it because it crucifies my flesh i
[26:16] have to die out
[26:17] amen i've got to depart from that way of
[26:22] thinking
[26:24] now i've got to accept that god's
[26:26] perfect will
[26:27] is the most important thing of my life
[26:30] amen
[26:31] and it's no longer about oh just not
[26:33] doing bad things
[26:35] but it's about learning to do more good
[26:36] things
[26:41] his will becomes first this is all about
[26:45] god's will
[26:48] you know we want to claim where his and
[26:50] do whatever we want to do i'm telling
[26:51] you it's just tommy rot
[26:52] it's sickening amen
[26:57] it's the mark of the beast amen
[27:01] and we don't even know it we've been
[27:04] deceived
[27:07] every one of us every one of us ought to
[27:10] be departing
[27:11] from doing our own will and our own
[27:18] things
[27:22] defining iniquity is not doing what we
[27:24] know we should be doing
[27:25] and we know we should be putting god's
[27:27] will first in our lives
[27:31] lucifer was perfect until in his heart
[27:34] he wanted to do what he wanted to do
[27:38] which was simply not doing what god
[27:41] wanted him to do
[27:42] you know when we think about the devil
[27:44] we think of him just being some
[27:47] man with a fork and
[27:51] fire coming out of his mouth and he
[27:52] wants to just kill people
[27:56] we never look at him as being pretty and
[27:59] beautiful
[28:00] and sitting in church in the most
[28:01] religious of all of us
[28:05] but so stubborn won't do the will of god
[28:16] we were born with the same nature
[28:20] of satan
[28:24] he made an image unto himself and he
[28:27] knew what he was doing in the garden
[28:32] our nature has to change completely
[28:36] into the perfect will of god
[28:40] we need to get away from just defending
[28:43] who we
[28:44] are and we need to be putting the
[28:47] emphasis
[28:48] on a humble lord help me to do your will
[28:55] the only thing that can change our
[28:58] nature
[28:59] is god
[29:02] and he doesn't use a magic wand
[29:06] he uses his living word
[29:11] come on i'll read it peter said being
[29:14] born again not of corruptible seed but
[29:16] incorruptible
[29:17] by the word of god amen we're born by
[29:20] the word the emphasis
[29:21] is the word now not the dead letter
[29:25] but it's the life of this word it's
[29:27] believing that these words are spirit in
[29:29] their life
[29:30] amen it's the living word that changes
[29:33] us
[29:33] when you say amen i believe it that's
[29:36] for me
[29:37] that can change your life
[29:42] that's all that's going to matter when
[29:43] it's over the living word
[29:49] that's why we need the holy ghost
[29:54] but not just the holy ghost
[29:57] the seal
[30:01] the seal of the holy ghost it needs to
[30:04] be sealed
[30:06] we've all experienced the holy ghost
[30:11] but you know some people identify the
[30:14] seal
[30:15] as i spoke in tongues or
[30:24] i've got the seal because i believe
[30:31] because if you remember
[30:35] aber uh abraham believed it was counted
[30:38] on him for righteousness
[30:41] but then brother ram says
[30:45] but god gave him a seal of circumcision
[30:51] god has to give us something if we're
[30:53] sealed
[30:56] it don't come by us saying well
[31:00] brother john i come here to get it
[31:05] you're more likely to get it if you're
[31:09] fearing and trembling at the word of god
[31:12] reverencing god lord if it isn't for
[31:16] your grace
[31:18] i hope he holds out that's happened to
[31:21] her and accepts me today
[31:25] we've made a mockery
[31:32] the type of people a real christian
[31:34] ought to be
[31:39] defending what we believe
[31:42] more than living the life
[31:53] brother madam says the mark of the beast
[31:56] is not to receive the seal of god
[32:02] and we should say amen to that one
[32:08] and we think well the mark of the beast
[32:10] is something out there
[32:13] and all he's saying is if you don't get
[32:15] the seal of the holy ghost you got it
[32:19] it's an ultimate it's an automatic thing
[32:22] we we agree with the preaching
[32:24] that says you were born with that seed
[32:27] if you ever had eternal life you've
[32:28] always had is your life that seed is
[32:29] lying in you
[32:31] we all say amen to that we don't want to
[32:34] say amen that was born with the
[32:37] the nature of the beast
[32:40] but we were yes that thing has to die
[32:44] out
[32:46] don't preach on suffering brother john
[32:48] but try to get the holy ghost
[32:50] without dying out try to get the nature
[32:53] of god without dying
[32:54] out you know the world don't want that's
[32:56] why we got all those denominations out
[32:58] there
[33:01] well we don't believe like that
[33:02] denomination we got we take this little
[33:04] creed and now we're all saved we got the
[33:06] holy ghost
[33:10] what about the nature of god amen amen
[33:13] why can't we just take that word and let
[33:15] that word judge us every time we open
[33:16] the book
[33:20] why do we gotta tout around like we got
[33:22] something let the word speak to you
[33:32] in other words man is already marked
[33:34] with the same nature
[33:36] of self-will as lucifer had
[33:40] he's born with it second peter chapter 2
[33:43] verse 10
[33:44] but chiefly them that walk after the
[33:46] flesh
[33:48] in the lust of uncleanness and the
[33:50] despised government
[33:52] how many has been despising the
[33:53] government lately
[33:56] presumptuous are they self-willed i'm
[33:59] going to do this i'm going to do that
[34:04] they're not afraid to speak evil well
[34:06] this is what i think about
[34:08] those red wings
[34:12] this is what i think
[34:16] we're as angels which are greater in
[34:19] power and might
[34:21] bring not a railing acquisition
[34:24] accusation
[34:25] against them before the lord
[34:29] but why would we be so bold
[34:34] it's not bold
[34:38] it's pride
[34:41] there's a difference between boldness
[34:45] and pride which is arrogance
[34:51] the boulders righteous is a lion but
[34:53] there is humble as a lamb
[34:54] at the same time
[35:02] ah we don't got time to get that we had
[35:03] to get going we had a message here
[35:05] but i got a lot of things i can say
[35:07] about that but these
[35:08] as natural brute
[35:12] beasts made to be taken
[35:16] and destroyed speak evil those things
[35:18] which they understand not
[35:21] and shall utterly perish in their own
[35:25] seed that they were born with
[35:35] said in the message just once more lord
[35:37] he says brother sister i don't know
[35:39] in my bible of any other thing that god
[35:42] has promised
[35:43] to do before the rapture of the church
[35:46] he says i don't
[35:48] he says you're thinking a mark of the
[35:51] beast is coming
[35:53] he says i've told you they've done
[35:57] got it he said the next thing left is
[36:01] the rapture of the church
[36:04] it'll it could come at any time and not
[36:07] just
[36:08] disrupt any scripture in the bible as
[36:11] far as i know
[36:12] god knows that to be the truth yes sir
[36:14] the time is at hand it's later
[36:16] than we think
[36:20] please don't make the same mistake that
[36:22] other messenger
[36:24] messenger message believers make
[36:28] they feel safe that they're not in a
[36:30] denomination
[36:34] they feel safe claiming
[36:37] they're born again they feel safe
[36:40] claiming they've received the holy ghost
[36:42] they feel safe
[36:43] claiming that they're sealed
[36:48] our safety isn't in what we claim
[36:53] many will come to me in that day and say
[36:54] lord lord
[36:56] did not i did not i did i
[37:00] but they did not want to depart from
[37:04] their own will right
[37:11] god is interested in us doing his will
[37:17] more than if a righteous man's false
[37:20] seven times sometimes he's going to get
[37:22] back up
[37:22] we put our emphasis on oh look what he
[37:25] did
[37:28] oh yeah amen
[37:32] as well as i'm not doing bad things i
[37:34] can do whatever i want to do where
[37:36] what gospel is that that's the gospel
[37:39] according to satan
[37:45] i urge you to take a look at your will
[37:50] are you walking
[37:53] are you waking up every day doing your
[37:56] will
[37:58] or you honestly know that you're doing
[38:00] god's will
[38:03] because look god is not asking everybody
[38:06] to get up
[38:11] get baptized every day
[38:14] we're supposed to be going on to
[38:16] perfection amen
[38:18] not well there's nothing left for me to
[38:21] do i guess i'm perfected
[38:25] look at the attitude that's true
[38:28] where is your vision of perfection
[38:32] what should we be doing
[38:39] don't give me a list of the 15 things
[38:41] that you're doing for the lord
[38:52] give me the list of things that you're
[38:54] doing for your own will
[38:57] because that's the list that god's
[38:59] staring at
[39:06] we must continue to die out until the
[39:09] will of god
[39:10] is completely born again in us
[39:14] every single day
[39:17] [Music]
[39:19] not just back there back then
[39:23] that's good that we can point back there
[39:25] but today
[39:26] is that day of salvation that we prove
[39:29] what is that good
[39:30] and perfect and acceptable will of god
[39:33] for our lives
[39:37] that is the image that we've been
[39:38] predestinated to our first
[39:42] birth was very cute
[39:48] ask our parents
[39:52] no matter how ugly you were you were
[39:54] cute
[39:57] they're the only ones that can vouch for
[39:58] that
[40:02] no matter how cute our first birth was
[40:05] we grew up into monsters how do i know
[40:08] ask the same parents that thought you
[40:10] were cute
[40:15] it was the mark of the beast right
[40:16] before him
[40:21] and if that human nature continues on
[40:25] right it's no telling what it will do
[40:30] in a spiral out of control
[40:33] now the second verse
[40:36] it was also messy but it was beautiful
[40:39] amen
[40:41] this time it wasn't your natural parents
[40:45] i thought it was good
[40:49] it was your heavenly father that was
[40:51] rejoicing and all of heaven was
[40:53] rejoicing
[40:54] amen i remember my wife's parents they
[40:58] were so
[40:58] mad and upset i remember my dad he just
[41:01] thought i was
[41:02] in a cult
[41:06] what you know i gave you a tv and you
[41:08] ain't giving your kids tv
[41:11] yeah my my natural parents didn't think
[41:14] the idea was so cute
[41:20] in fact they never took they never told
[41:23] me
[41:24] sit in that catholic church and be a
[41:28] listen to them and do what they tell you
[41:29] to do
[41:31] they were just happy that you were you
[41:32] know you go to church be a good boy
[41:41] but as we grow we become more like
[41:43] humble
[41:44] lambs amen the nature of god
[41:48] and if that nature continues in us as
[41:51] humans we will become
[41:53] more into the image of christ
[41:57] in fact things will become so much like
[41:59] him that the very nature of christ
[42:02] in man will be seen again
[42:06] it does it doesn't yet appear but we
[42:08] know when he shall appear
[42:09] we shall be like him we will be not in
[42:13] the image of the beast
[42:14] but in the image of god amen
[42:19] because a man at his very best
[42:23] can't nowhere get to the image of christ
[42:30] why we got to be born again romans
[42:33] chapter 8 verse 29
[42:35] for whom he did for no he also
[42:38] did predestinate to be conformed
[42:42] to the image of his son
[42:46] that we might that he might be the
[42:48] firstborn among many
[42:50] brethren
[42:54] do you ever see a family where they all
[42:56] look the same
[43:00] he just you knew who their parents were
[43:06] i do believe that we're going to be like
[43:08] jesus amen
[43:12] we've been predestinated it's a
[43:15] conforming
[43:17] if you think of that word conforming
[43:21] it's not doesn't sound like a
[43:23] comfortable word i'd rather have one of
[43:26] these
[43:27] you know done over but a conforming
[43:32] a constricting a pressurized
[43:42] we don't have to prove it by saying i
[43:44] know what the mark of the beast is
[43:47] i know its number is 666.
[43:50] i know the name of it is some
[43:53] denomination
[43:54] or the mother harlot the first one in
[43:57] all the other ho
[43:58] its daughters
[44:02] we don't prove it by knowing
[44:06] who the head the antichrist is
[44:10] we don't prove it by saying i know i got
[44:12] the holy ghost
[44:13] that's right we prove it by living it
[44:17] out
[44:17] every single day
[44:22] by living out the will of god every
[44:24] single day
[44:26] how can i start brother john how can i
[44:28] start doing that
[44:30] romans
[44:34] chapter 12.
[44:38] romans chapter 12 just a a a few verses
[44:41] later look at it look at it start out
[44:44] let's start with verse 22
[44:45] the holy spirit will conform us to the
[44:48] image of christ
[44:49] romans chapter 12 verse 2 and be not
[44:51] conformed to this world but be
[44:53] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[44:56] that you may
[44:57] prove what is the good and acceptable
[44:59] and perfect will of god now that's what
[45:00] we've been born
[45:01] to is the will of god
[45:05] not just i'm in the message i receive
[45:08] william branham as the prophet
[45:10] i'm in denominations are out
[45:15] is that what you think
[45:18] the image of christ is
[45:23] we're supposed to be proving with our
[45:26] life
[45:28] what the will of god is proving it
[45:32] so why are we so defending with our
[45:34] words
[45:37] don't want anybody to cross us
[45:40] don't challenge me don't tell me i'm not
[45:44] why are we comfortable with just i'm
[45:45] happy with the life that i'm living
[45:48] i want everybody to look at it
[45:51] i want them to see me every day give up
[45:53] my will for the will of god
[45:54] i want to see them deny myself and pick
[45:58] up my cross and follow me
[45:59] why aren't i happy with that
[46:02] because we want to do our own will and
[46:05] say we're born again
[46:07] amen
[46:10] it's another jesus it's just another
[46:12] denomination
[46:14] hiding behind the religion of this
[46:16] message
[46:21] look at verse one i beseech you
[46:22] therefore brethren by the mercies of god
[46:26] that you present your bodies a living
[46:29] sacrifice
[46:30] [Music]
[46:31] holy acceptable unto god
[46:35] this is your reasonable
[46:39] service amen not making it to church
[46:41] twice a week
[46:43] and paying your tithes and changing your
[46:45] clothes and changing your hair
[46:51] it's about the will of god do you wake
[46:54] up with i got to do god's will i gotta
[46:56] do as well
[46:58] or i just wake up as long as i'm not
[46:59] doing anything bad i'm okay do what you
[47:01] want to do as long as i'm not doing
[47:02] nothing bad
[47:04] what gospel were you listening to right
[47:07] that's the mark of the beast
[47:09] it's the same number as a man
[47:13] it's the same as a man he let let him
[47:16] that have wisdom
[47:18] count that number who's got wisdom today
[47:25] we need to become more serious about
[47:27] pressing towards the mark
[47:29] yes instead of defending that we've
[47:31] already
[47:32] received it or that we're already there
[47:34] or that we're already
[47:35] received the holy ghost
[47:39] defending that will never
[47:42] defending will never change our nature
[47:47] you can defend all you want they ain't
[47:48] going to change your nature ain't going
[47:49] to make you become more of a lamb
[47:53] you're gonna make you lay down your life
[47:55] for your brother wash your brother's
[47:57] feet go the second mile love your enemy
[47:59] defending what you believe doesn't
[48:01] change your nature
[48:06] but pressing in to become more into his
[48:08] image will
[48:10] humble contrary lord i recognize
[48:13] this beastly nature inside of me i give
[48:16] up my will for the your will lord i want
[48:18] to do your will
[48:20] you have a revelation of what it means
[48:22] to get up every day and pray
[48:23] lord let thy will be done here in this
[48:26] earth as it is
[48:27] your desire in heaven for me
[48:32] paul lived a life of pressing towards
[48:35] the mark
[48:37] he pressed into the mark in fact the
[48:40] mark became more
[48:41] and more a part of his life that it
[48:43] became actually
[48:46] in his life in his body galatians
[48:49] chapter 6 verse 16. let's start with
[48:51] that
[48:53] as and as many as walk according to this
[48:56] rule
[48:56] peace be unto them in mercy and upon the
[48:59] israel of a god
[49:01] from henceforth let no man trouble me
[49:03] for i bear in my
[49:04] body the marks of the lord jesus
[49:10] what an honor it would be
[49:13] to be tattooed with the marks of jesus
[49:19] and not by man putting some cross
[49:23] here
[49:23] [Music]
[49:26] but by you laying down your life and
[49:29] suffering
[49:30] for it so much that your body becomes
[49:34] marked
[49:36] amen paul's life became marked
[49:40] through persecution
[49:43] to giving up his will right that's
[49:46] where his life become marked what we
[49:49] hear we heard some
[49:50] requests today or some something that
[49:53] was said about
[49:54] uh the people there in in india
[49:58] india indiana there that that that uh
[50:01] were rejected because they they took
[50:03] christ as their savior and now they're
[50:05] being
[50:05] persecuted by their their own uh people
[50:09] by their own family
[50:12] and this is how you get the marks of
[50:14] christ by giving up your will
[50:17] of course we understand they were in his
[50:18] body in second corinthians chapter 11
[50:21] when he was comparing himself with other
[50:23] ministries
[50:24] the marks of other ministries he said
[50:26] are they the ministers
[50:28] he says i am the more and more uh in
[50:30] labor's more
[50:31] abundant and stripes above measure and
[50:33] prisons more frequent deaths often
[50:35] of the jews five times receive thy forty
[50:37] stripes say one thrice was i beat with
[50:39] rods once i was stoned
[50:41] thrice i was shipwrecked i suffered
[50:44] shipwreck night and day and i've been in
[50:45] the deep now i'm stopping there but you
[50:47] notice
[50:48] these things affected his body
[50:51] they became marks in his body because of
[50:54] him denying his
[50:56] will giving up his will to do the will
[50:59] of god remember he
[51:00] he told to ananias he says i must i will
[51:03] show him how much
[51:04] things he must suffer for my name's sake
[51:08] i wonder has god showed you what you're
[51:11] going to suffer for him
[51:12] or do you believe you don't have to
[51:14] suffer because he died for you at the
[51:16] cross
[51:17] and you don't have to give up anything
[51:20] i feel like preaching today
[51:25] we need a balance we need understanding
[51:27] of the scriptures
[51:28] not take them carnally and twist them to
[51:30] our fleshly favor
[51:32] we got to feel in debt to what god did
[51:34] for us something's got to put us out
[51:36] there and go yell
[51:37] out there give the gospel to others it
[51:39] doesn't matter what persecution comes
[51:44] if we don't suffer form the bible says
[51:46] we won't reign with him
[51:51] turn with me to ephesians chapter four
[51:53] we're gonna be
[51:55] closing with this if we could
[52:02] and i know you're all praying we could
[52:03] right
[52:06] lord bless john with that supernatural
[52:08] strength to close with this scripture
[52:16] ephesians chapter four
[52:20] i want us when we read this to keep
[52:23] in mind god's motive
[52:26] for his will inside the church
[52:30] his will that's what this is all about
[52:33] it's about his will
[52:35] therefore i therefore the prisoner of
[52:37] the lord beseech you
[52:38] that you walk worthy of the vocation
[52:40] where with your call so what will we
[52:42] call it to
[52:44] to prove i got it
[52:51] well we prove it with all lowliness
[52:55] and meekness longsuffering for bearing
[52:58] one another in love endeavoring to keep
[53:00] unity
[53:01] unity means oneness
[53:04] oneness of the spirit in the bond of
[53:06] peace
[53:08] there is one body now look where he goes
[53:10] in so many times he says
[53:11] one here there's one body
[53:14] one spirit even as you are called
[53:17] into one hope of your calling one lord
[53:21] one faith one baptism one god
[53:26] one will one will
[53:31] not ours we can inject ours into it
[53:34] it's the mark of the beast
[53:38] one faith one baptism one god and father
[53:40] of all who is above all and through all
[53:42] and in you all
[53:45] wow there's no room left
[53:49] for me can i just squeeze a little bit
[53:53] me in there
[53:59] oh but you know we get to know satan's
[54:01] voice real good
[54:05] you know as soon as church is over
[54:18] god reserves who he's going to spend
[54:21] eternity with
[54:23] don't let satan trick you and deceive
[54:26] you
[54:27] that just because you're not in the
[54:28] denomination and you're in a message
[54:30] church
[54:31] that you're ready
[54:34] you're in the right place to get ready
[54:37] but you need to come through those doors
[54:39] with prepared to hear the word or
[54:42] satan's going to be ministering to you a
[54:44] carnal interpretation how many times you
[54:46] walk in the church
[54:48] you're offended at the word and think
[54:49] well i don't got to do that
[54:53] think about that to the word
[54:58] and it isn't because the word is wrong
[55:02] it's because our attitude
[55:06] we got the same attitude as laodicea in
[55:08] need of nothing
[55:09] i don't need that kind of preacher i
[55:11] need a preacher it makes me feel good
[55:14] makes me just stand up and claim what i
[55:17] want for my life
[55:20] in other words we want to service
[55:22] without the will of god
[55:24] and at least we want a service that
[55:26] tells us that the will of god is
[55:28] you know you whatever you ask for you
[55:30] can have
[55:37] i just wonder what we're born of what
[55:40] what spirit
[55:42] is preeminent it it ought to be leading
[55:46] us to be more in his image
[55:49] now the mark of the beast won't it's
[55:50] just the opposite it will
[55:53] look i remember when i was first
[55:55] introduced to come to church
[55:58] i did not want to go
[56:03] i didn't want to go to the catholic
[56:04] church
[56:07] but after i went to the message church
[56:10] oh my my
[56:12] i started hearing all these things
[56:15] my flesh didn't want to go there tell me
[56:18] i got to give up my music
[56:20] i'm married to my music
[56:29] i had the mark of the beast and i didn't
[56:30] know it
[56:33] and that nature wants to creep up yes
[56:38] that's why it's a daily affair don't be
[56:42] looking out there
[56:44] please don't be looking out there for
[56:45] the mark of the beast and feel
[56:47] safe and comfortable in here
[56:51] it's right there inside trying to come
[56:54] out and have its own will every single
[56:56] day in our lives
[57:00] and if you're courageous enough to
[57:02] crucify it
[57:04] i say that courageous enough if you're
[57:06] willing to stay there in prayer long
[57:08] enough
[57:09] to you mean it from the depths of your
[57:10] heart lord let thy will be done today
[57:15] praise god you're on the right track
[57:17] you're starting out right
[57:21] but you can't get to the place don't get
[57:23] to the place so deceived i got the holy
[57:26] ghost i don't got to worry about
[57:27] anything
[57:31] pretty soon you won't be doing anything
[57:32] for god
[57:34] you won't be dying out to anything
[57:40] verse 7 but unto every one of us is
[57:43] given
[57:44] grace according to the measure of the
[57:45] gift of god wherefore he saith
[57:47] when he ascended on high he lay kept his
[57:49] captive and gave gifts
[57:51] unto men now that he is
[57:54] thou that he ascended what is it but he
[57:56] descended first
[57:57] into the lower parts of the earth he the
[57:59] descendant is the same that also
[58:01] ascended up far above heavens that he
[58:04] might fill all things so god is
[58:06] everywhere
[58:08] he went into the heavens and what did he
[58:09] do he sent a five-fold ministry for us
[58:15] and he gave some apostles and prophets
[58:17] and evangelists and pastors
[58:19] and teachers now what did he give them
[58:21] for just to let them know
[58:25] that their seed of god and
[58:29] and no matter what happens they're going
[58:31] in the rapture
[58:37] but that's the kind of preacher we like
[58:39] don't we yeah
[58:40] thank you brother mike somebody said
[58:42] amen our flesh wants that
[58:45] our flesh does not want to come here and
[58:47] have its hide
[58:48] tore off
[58:51] and god knows anybody that knows me
[58:54] outside of this pulpit
[58:56] knows that is not my nature
[59:00] you've seen people you've seen people
[59:03] outside
[59:04] you're just like whoa what what kind of
[59:06] nature is that
[59:08] so it i have to say this this is not the
[59:11] nature of john martin
[59:14] the five-fold ministry is not it's not
[59:16] the nature of a human being
[59:20] now god has an expression through
[59:23] different people and it's expressed
[59:24] different ways and
[59:26] different parts of the gospel come out
[59:28] every time they preach
[59:30] and we can't get by with just a one-fold
[59:33] ministry we need a a five-fold
[59:38] why is it so important it's for the
[59:41] perfection of the saints
[59:42] yes amen for the work of the ministry
[59:45] for the edifying of the body of christ
[59:49] till we all say i got it
[59:54] no till we all jump and have a
[59:56] hallelujah service
[59:58] nope can we all feel
[1:00:01] more self-esteem about herself nope
[1:00:05] till we all come into the unity
[1:00:10] of the faith
[1:00:13] we've got to believe the word right down
[1:00:15] the middle
[1:00:16] amen not dissecting it the way we want
[1:00:20] to and taking it the way we want to
[1:00:22] believing it the way we want to
[1:00:26] hum we got to stay humble and let let
[1:00:29] that five-fold ministry
[1:00:31] speak to us exactly the way that god
[1:00:33] wants
[1:00:34] us to take it oh i love that
[1:00:40] till we all come into the unity of faith
[1:00:41] and the knowledge of the son of god
[1:00:43] unto a perfect man
[1:00:48] unto the measure of the statue of the
[1:00:50] phone sounds to me
[1:00:52] like this is the image of christ
[1:00:58] the fivefold ministry is for us to come
[1:01:01] into the image of christ
[1:01:03] yes amen now when you're not listening
[1:01:05] to the word
[1:01:10] means you're open to every other thought
[1:01:11] that comes into your head

[1:01:17] emphasize
[1:01:19] the mark of the beast amen
[1:01:22] amen which is exercise your will amen

[1:01:34] couple more verses and i want you to
[1:01:36] read the rest
[1:01:38] of this chapter if you would later today

[1:01:44] image amen
[1:01:46] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:01:48] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:01:50] every

[1:02:15] word
[1:02:15] for what the word says it won't bring
[1:02:17] you peace

[1:02:22] you're trying to fit the word to your
[1:02:24] own

[1:02:27] gotta lay it all aside
