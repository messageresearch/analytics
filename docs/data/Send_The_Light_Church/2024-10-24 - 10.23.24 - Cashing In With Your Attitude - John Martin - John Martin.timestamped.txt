[34:23] today it's like we want to like get
[34:25] everybody go like this in the middle but
[34:27] no this is fine let's look to the Lord
[34:29] in a word of prayer and then we'll get
[34:31] straight into the word our heavenly
[34:33] father we thank you God we count it a
[34:36] privilege to have a desire and a heart
[34:38] to serve you
[34:39] today Lord and we we're we're thankful
[34:44] Lord that that desire that's there in
[34:46] our heart you've kept it
[34:49] there you you've kept it there you
[34:51] you've not allowed the things of the
[34:54] world to to squish it out or to to put
[34:57] under a a a some
[35:01] doormat but Lord
[35:04] I it's been your grace Lord that today
[35:08] we were standing looking for the coming
[35:10] of the Lord looking for that hour Lord
[35:13] that we're going to be called away and
[35:15] we just thank you today that we could
[35:16] gather together it's such a precious
[35:19] precious precious time and Lord we we
[35:22] pray that your presence would be felt
[35:25] amongst each of us today Lord there
[35:27] wouldn't be one that would go home and
[35:29] just not know of assurity that you were
[35:31] there for them that you they felt your
[35:35] presence and Lord they they not only
[35:38] heard you speak to them but Lord uh you
[35:43] you were able to to correspond with them
[35:46] and communicate with them and they could
[35:49] talk back and Lord that each one of our
[35:52] relationships could be just lifted up
[35:55] just a little bit closer to to you from
[35:58] this service I pray that you'd encourage
[35:59] every heart and Lord that you would
[36:02] bless us as we commit ourself in this
[36:05] service into your hands now for we ask
[36:07] these things in Jesus Christ's name amen
[36:11] amen turn with me if you would to Mark
[36:13] chapter n for just one verse Mark
[36:18] chapter N I wonder if there'd be anyone
[36:20] here today that could could say that I
[36:24] have something that I would like God to
[36:27] do just a amen just it's such a simple
[36:31] request but I think we have the word for
[36:37] that today Mark chapter 9 starting with
[36:39] verse number
[36:42] 23 Mark 9 verse
[36:46] 23 Jesus speaking
[36:49] here says if thou can't believe all
[36:53] things are
[36:54] possible to him that believeth amen amen
[36:59] if if thou can't believe all things are
[37:03] possible to him that believeth you may
[37:06] be seated God bless the reading of his
[37:08] word and we're we want
[37:11] to we want to look at building faith but
[37:14] maybe in a in a little bit different way
[37:16] than we have before and um I I hope that
[37:20] you can you can go with me but this word
[37:23] this scripture that Jesus uses here if
[37:25] thou can't believe
[37:28] uh he uses the word
[37:31] if and if is a conjunction used to
[37:35] introduce a conditional Clause it shows
[37:39] a condition uh therefore if we if we do
[37:42] not believe then all things are not
[37:45] possible to us so that that one little
[37:47] twetter word is extremely important and
[37:52] Jesus actually uses this a lot in his
[37:54] ministry this word he says you are my
[37:57] friends
[37:59] if if you do whatsoever I command
[38:02] you if you love me keep my
[38:06] Commandments and and and and we know
[38:09] that you know there people
[38:12] claim their view their their
[38:14] Vision um that they they they love God
[38:17] they're they're a friend of God but
[38:20] God's word really has the final say so
[38:22] about these
[38:25] things he says if you keep my command
[38:27] you shall abide in my love even as I
[38:29] kept my father's Commandments and abide
[38:31] in his love if you keep my Commandments
[38:34] then you're going to abide in my love if
[38:36] not you're going to grieve the grieve my
[38:38] spirit and I'm going to step
[38:41] back I mean the and these are just
[38:44] facts one time Jesus said if if you he
[38:48] he's speaking to some Believers that
[38:50] believed on him he says if you continue
[38:52] in my word if you continue in my word
[38:55] then are you my disciples indeed and
[38:57] many people would want to claim that
[38:59] they're a disciple of Christ without
[39:02] that
[39:04] condition and they're just gonna no
[39:06] matter what I do I'm still a disciple of
[39:09] Jesus Christ I was 15 years ago and I am
[39:12] today but they're not continuing in the
[39:14] word and so the the word is the final
[39:16] absolute but we're just showing how
[39:17] important this word if is right now
[39:21] amen by this shall all men know you're
[39:23] my disciples if you have Lov one for
[39:26] another amen and maybe we're going to
[39:28] get into that a little bit Sunday but
[39:32] but the the word if it shows a condition
[39:37] I I just can't say that everybody should
[39:39] know I'm a disciple because I'm a
[39:42] preacher like who
[39:44] cares i' I've got to be able to
[39:47] demonstrate love everyone the
[39:51] same not respect a persons not on my
[39:54] favorite day just love just like Jesus
[39:59] loved did you know that we won't remain
[40:04] saved if we don't keep in our memory or
[40:08] the memory of our heart the things that
[40:10] God has taught
[40:11] us and that's we can find that in 1
[40:14] Corinthians
[40:15] 15:1 uh if we want to put that up there
[40:17] 1 Corinthians 15:1 moreover Brethren I
[40:20] declare unto you the gospel which I
[40:23] preached unto you which also you
[40:27] received it and wherein you stand
[40:30] today by which you are saved if is that
[40:34] word again if you keep in memory what I
[40:38] preached unto you unless it all been in
[40:41] vain unless you're original believing in
[40:44] it at the beginning turns vain because
[40:48] no it it doesn't matter how we start out
[40:50] it only matters that we're continuing in
[40:52] that we finish the way that we said that
[40:55] we're going to amen
[40:58] amen so we can fall from grace we can
[41:01] fall from our old steadfastness we can
[41:03] fall from salvation right our names can
[41:06] be taken out of the book of life we are
[41:08] capable of going
[41:13] backwards and I'm just just speaking
[41:16] here with the scriptures we're not going
[41:17] to be talking about predestination
[41:21] and the thing is we must walk
[41:26] with certainty and keep walking in that
[41:30] direction we can't just let back off and
[41:33] expect everything to continue to be
[41:37] okay that's why Peter said in second
[41:40] Peter 1 wherefore the rather Brethren
[41:42] give diligence to make your calling and
[41:46] your election
[41:48] assure for if you do these things what
[41:51] things if you keep adding Christ to your
[41:54] life the virtues if you keep adding if
[41:56] you do these things you shall never fall
[41:59] but the moment you just like you know
[42:01] what I'm just going to back up I'm going
[42:02] to take a backseat I'm just going to sit
[42:04] back here and just kind of take it
[42:07] easy you're going to fall and not even
[42:09] know it because your whole mindset has
[42:12] to be I'm going forward into the image
[42:14] of Jesus Christ and and I'm not stopping
[42:16] till I'm
[42:17] there so ye are saved if you keep in
[42:22] memory what I preached unto you unless
[42:24] you believed in vain right
[42:27] 1 Thessalonians 3:8 for now we live if
[42:31] we stand fast in the Lord Colossians
[42:34] 1:20 and we're just kind of laying a
[42:37] kind of a lengthy Foundation here and
[42:40] having made peace we've all made peace
[42:43] through the blood of of his
[42:45] cross by him to reconcile all things
[42:49] unto himself by him I say whether they
[42:52] be things in the Earth or things in
[42:54] heaven so he has reconciled us and
[42:57] everything back to him through the
[43:00] cross and you that were sometimes
[43:04] sometime alienated and and and enemies
[43:07] even in your own mind by Wicked Works
[43:09] yet now he's reconciled you he is he's
[43:14] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[43:19] through
[43:20] death to present you holy unblamable
[43:23] unreprovable in his sight we could say
[43:25] Amen to that couldn't we
[43:27] but there's not a period there there's a
[43:30] colon and the very next word says if if
[43:34] you continue in the
[43:37] faith grounded settled and be not moved
[43:41] away from the hope of the Gospel which
[43:43] you have heard and and and which was
[43:46] preached to every creature that is under
[43:48] heaven where of I Paul and made a
[43:51] minister amen you know we when we were
[43:54] growing up in this message and we we
[43:56] learned that you know tongues was not
[43:59] the evidence that you have the Holy
[44:01] Ghost right we were taught that we
[44:04] learned that and so many people wanted
[44:08] that to be true and still believe it
[44:11] today
[44:13] because if I just speak in tongues I
[44:16] know I have it and I don't have to worry
[44:18] about getting it ever
[44:20] again just like putting my name on the
[44:23] book just like getting baptized a
[44:24] certain way if I if I if I can
[44:28] identify something out here
[44:30] naturally that tells you I've got the
[44:33] Holy Ghost then I don't have to worry
[44:35] about living the life and I don't have
[44:36] to worry about what I do from here on
[44:39] out but you know the prophet came and he
[44:42] taught us that the holy ghost lines up
[44:45] with the
[44:46] word and gifts or callings are without
[44:50] it and so the focus is uh Christ
[44:54] manifest the word and if we had the
[44:56] spirit of Christ brother say will
[44:57] manifest Christ just like if we had the
[44:58] spirit of bolaven B
[45:01] bolaven
[45:03] Beethoven then we would we would play
[45:05] music like bethoven right okay so we we
[45:09] understand that we we've just got to
[45:11] follow through and continue in the faith
[45:14] that word if all right Colossians 3:1 if
[45:18] you then be risen with Christ then then
[45:21] seek those things which are above where
[45:23] Christ sth on the right hand of God set
[45:24] your affections on things above and not
[45:26] on things of the Earth for you dead and
[45:28] your life is hid with God so there's
[45:31] these are some
[45:34] conditions
[45:35] faith is a contingency with
[45:43] god without faith we can't even please
[45:46] God one time Jesus said in Matthew 17 if
[45:50] you have faith as a grain of mustard
[45:54] seed you shall say unto this mountain
[45:57] remove hence To Yonder place and it
[45:59] shall be removed and nothing shall be
[46:02] impossible unto you amen if you have
[46:06] faith as a grain of mustard seed we know
[46:10] a grain of mustard seed is the smallest
[46:11] of all the seeds herb seeds but yet it
[46:14] grows into such a big place that birds
[46:17] have their nest and they they Lodge
[46:20] there so you don't need much you just
[46:25] need you just need need it to be
[46:28] real it just needs to be
[46:31] real one time Jesus said to Martha if
[46:34] thou wouldest believe thou should us see
[46:38] the glory of God again a condition
[46:42] you've got to you've got to
[46:44] believe Jesus said in Luke 17 take heed
[46:47] to yourself If thy brother trespass
[46:49] against thee rebuke him if he repents
[46:51] forgive him if he trespassed against the
[46:54] seven times in one day seven times one
[46:57] day turn again say I Repent thou shallal
[47:01] forgive him that's a lot of forgiv you
[47:05] might say that was a bad
[47:07] day and and most likely we've none of us
[47:11] have ever experienced one person doing
[47:13] something to us the same thing seven
[47:16] times in one day they might have did
[47:19] different things right talk this way
[47:21] treated you bad did
[47:25] this but it's a bad day right so the
[47:28] apostles said unto unto the Lord
[47:31] increase our faith the only way to deal
[47:35] with forgiving somebody seven times in
[47:38] in one day is you got to give me more
[47:40] faith
[47:41] amen and the Lord said if you had Faith
[47:46] as a grain of mustard seed you might say
[47:49] not to this mountain but to the sicamore
[47:51] tree be thou plucked up by the root and
[47:54] be thou planted in the sea and it should
[47:57] obey
[47:59] you this little little thing called
[48:04] Faith Can Do wonders if ye had Faith as
[48:08] a tiny grain of mustard seed amen one
[48:12] time Jesus said if you abide in me and
[48:14] my words abide in you then you shall ask
[48:17] what you will and it shall be done unto
[48:18] you amen there's some conditional
[48:21] contingency here Jesus said if thou
[48:24] can't believe all things are possible
[48:29] Right amen now did you know faith is a
[48:32] real
[48:34] substance and it comes from God and it
[48:38] comes from God
[48:41] Alone Romans 10:17 so then Faith cometh
[48:44] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[48:47] God
[48:48] Amen and that God use faith in his word
[48:53] to create the entire universe
[48:56] Hebrews 11:3 tells us through faith we
[48:59] understand that the worlds were framed
[49:00] by the word of God so that the things
[49:02] which are seen are not made which uh
[49:05] made of the things which do appear so
[49:08] God used his word but it was faith in
[49:11] his word amen that when he would spoke
[49:14] it it would happen
[49:16] amen God is still operating by faith
[49:21] amen he not only created everything that
[49:24] we see through faith
[49:27] he has created new bodies Paul said
[49:30] they're waiting for
[49:31] us he is presently in the midst of
[49:34] creating Born Again
[49:37] creatures right before our eyes right in
[49:39] our life it is the word of God coming to
[49:42] life
[49:43] amen he is in the midst of creating
[49:46] brand new natures and how is he doing it
[49:50] by his own
[49:52] faith he tells us we believe it and then
[49:57] our faith becomes his faith and we live
[50:00] by the faith of the son of man just like
[50:01] Paul
[50:02] did in fact without faith God will not
[50:06] do anything amen he's building his
[50:09] church by faith amen he's restoring her
[50:12] by faith he's going to have a bride by
[50:14] faith he's going to have a a people that
[50:17] make a Rapture by faith she's going to
[50:21] be without spot or
[50:23] wrinkle no wonder the Bible tells us
[50:25] that we should earnest ly contend for
[50:28] the faith that was once delivered to the
[50:30] saints that we should build up ourselves
[50:33] in the Most Holy
[50:35] Faith that we should fight the good
[50:37] fight of Faith lay hold of eternal
[50:41] life as important as faith is there's a
[50:43] great apostasy right now as we know just
[50:47] even people in our own church are
[50:50] drifting away from the
[50:51] [Music]
[50:53] Faith Can Say Amen to that
[50:57] 2 Thessalonians 3 tells us that all men
[51:01] have not
[51:04] faith and I'll say it like this they
[51:06] must have set Faith
[51:09] aside they must have set the faith that
[51:12] they had aside when God spoke to their
[51:14] heart because when God speaks because he
[51:17] gives Every Man a chance does he
[51:21] not Romans 12:3 we might have touched on
[51:24] this last service God has doubt to every
[51:26] man a Measure of
[51:28] Faith so if every man gets a A measure
[51:31] then some men don't have it they must
[51:33] have laid that Faith aside somewhere
[51:36] they must have just kind of sat back and
[51:38] just let the weeds take
[51:41] over so it's what we do with the faith
[51:44] that that that
[51:47] counts we're all going to get a chance
[51:49] to hear from God but what are we going
[51:50] to do with it will we exercise what God
[51:53] spoke to us or we we just kind of let it
[51:58] dormant because like any muscle it if
[52:02] it's not exercised it won't
[52:05] grow our brain they tell you to do
[52:07] crossworld puzzles they they tell you to
[52:09] do certain things so you don't get
[52:11] Dimension you don't what I'm talking
[52:13] about it's the exercising curs it is the
[52:15] ground for thy
[52:17] sake because by working the ground
[52:20] you're because your body's done you're
[52:22] actually going to stay healthier by
[52:24] staying active
[52:27] so faith has to stay
[52:30] active faith is like a
[52:34] muscle can be the smallest
[52:38] seed but it has to be exercised and and
[52:42] Jesus typed it with
[52:45] that a a a grain of mustard seed
[52:48] becoming so great that it actually is
[52:51] benefited by the the other animals that
[52:54] he created
[52:59] faith is not going to grow on its own
[53:02] there has to come some sort of
[53:03] resistance right anybody's that's ever
[53:06] had any problems with knees you go to
[53:08] therapy or ankles or arms they give you
[53:11] resistant bands and you you tie them
[53:13] against something and you you you you
[53:15] you just force yourself to move with
[53:19] resistance and what that does is it it
[53:21] may hurt slightly for a little bit but
[53:24] it builds your muscles makes it stronger
[53:27] so now you you can get done with therapy
[53:30] how many's ever been done with therapy
[53:31] and you just feel so much better I mean
[53:34] I have many many times I've been to
[53:37] therapy because I always push myself to
[53:39] the Limit
[53:41] right Jesus speaking of our die of our
[53:44] day he says when the son of man cometh
[53:46] shall he even find faith on the earth so
[53:49] we know that it could be a real struggle
[53:51] sometimes to find faith in our lives and
[53:53] I'm I'm sure you could say Amen to that
[53:56] we've all all battle just looking for
[53:59] Faith and
[54:02] situations I want to encourage you with
[54:04] the the rest of this message if you
[54:06] haven't been encouraged so
[54:09] far since faith comes from God it can be
[54:13] often hard waiting
[54:16] around for God to give us
[54:19] faith and if we haven't been used to
[54:21] exercising it we can feel
[54:25] weak but I believe that there's a way
[54:27] that we can activate God more in our
[54:29] lives without waiting for him to speak
[54:32] to us in a direct way I was just sharing
[54:36] with the the brothers in the in the
[54:37] men's meeting there was no no doubt uh
[54:41] when God spoke to me about having
[54:43] trusted
[54:45] tool it was just one word dropped there
[54:48] never battled it I don't care what
[54:49] anybody ever said to me I they they're
[54:52] going to eat you up alive I heard a
[54:54] number of things but to me I was just
[54:57] was just never moved it didn't bother me
[54:59] I didn't debate it I didn't do
[55:01] nothing now when the Lord spoke to to to
[55:05] to Cheryl and said we're going to we'll
[55:07] we'll have that money we'll sell our
[55:08] house within seven
[55:10] days well I'm telling you I didn't have
[55:12] that that was not a revelation to me
[55:15] that was not Faith to
[55:17] me she had it but I
[55:19] didn't of course I had of trusted too
[55:22] but she didn't so you understand when
[55:25] God speaks it's real easy to have
[55:30] faith but there's so many things in the
[55:32] word and so many things that we want for
[55:34] our lives that
[55:36] we're
[55:38] we and God is not just going to speak
[55:40] them all to us like we
[55:42] want but yet he wants us to have
[55:47] them and and if we apply what we're
[55:50] going to talk about here I believe that
[55:53] we will bring we will see God manifest
[55:56] more of his word in our
[55:58] life it it it is that simple brother not
[56:01] brother yeah it was brother brother
[56:03] Charles sendell we haven't met him but
[56:06] uh he's our
[56:08] brother I've read this quote it's been a
[56:11] while probably since I've read it but he
[56:13] said attitude is more important than
[56:16] facts is more important than the past
[56:18] than education than money and
[56:20] circumstances then failures and success
[56:23] then what other people think or what
[56:25] they say do it's it's more important
[56:27] than appearance ability or skill it will
[56:30] make a break a business a home a
[56:34] friendship an organization the
[56:36] remarkable thing is I have a choice
[56:40] every day of what my attitude will
[56:42] be I cannot change my
[56:45] past I cannot change the action of
[56:49] others I I cannot even change the
[56:51] inevitable but the only thing I can
[56:55] change is my
[56:57] attitude life is 10% of what happens to
[57:01] me and 90% of how I react so we're going
[57:04] to talk about okay God did not speak all
[57:07] the things that we wanted to speak to us
[57:09] when we come to church and I don't feel
[57:11] like I'm getting what I want to get out
[57:12] of it but I have a a a a choice to make
[57:17] of how I'm going to respond to
[57:20] that and and brother brother Charlie
[57:23] said it it's it's 90% that it's 90% so I
[57:27] just I I brother brandom spoke about the
[57:32] right mental attitude and I want to read
[57:33] some Cults with
[57:35] this because it's filtered throughout
[57:38] his ministry it starts in the 50s 1950
[57:41] and right through
[57:43] 63
[57:45] um he talks about the importance of a
[57:47] right attitude and I want to kind of dig
[57:49] into this a little bit not just having a
[57:51] raid man altitude but what it means to
[57:53] have that and and how do we how do we
[57:55] get that so
[57:56] would just start off here brother BR
[57:58] says believest Thou this he says and I
[58:00] say this with a challenge in
[58:03] faith he's challenging in
[58:06] faith that every promise of God will be
[58:09] brought to pass if you take the right
[58:11] mental attitude towards
[58:14] it so what kind of attitude do I have at
[58:18] whatever I
[58:19] want what am I wanting what kind of
[58:22] attitude do I have towards
[58:24] it because if you think about there's so
[58:26] many things that we've wanted in our
[58:27] life that we just we we almost lose hope
[58:31] that we'll ever get it you know what I'm
[58:33] talking about and then you you you you
[58:35] develop this sense well you know I guess
[58:38] it's not for me I'm not going to have it
[58:40] now the thing is how can we know what
[58:43] God's will is for us unless he tells us
[58:46] now if he told us then it would be okay
[58:48] but if he hasn't told us why we accepted
[58:51] that so brother BR said in the message
[58:54] expectation he says we always get what
[58:57] we
[58:58] expect when people expect anything well
[59:01] then they usually get what they look for
[59:04] it's the mental attitude that you
[59:07] have so now he's bringing it home we all
[59:10] come into church with an attitude don't
[59:11] we we we do we do and it's it's a mental
[59:15] attitude it's not we're spiritual you
[59:18] know we're I got these 10 visions that
[59:20] happened to me when I come in church
[59:21] this is going to happen it's not that we
[59:23] walk in with a mental attitude
[59:27] he said remember this and never forget
[59:29] it the right mental attitude towards any
[59:32] promise of God will bring it to
[59:37] pass he's didn't say
[59:42] faith he says the right mental attitude
[59:45] towards any promise of God now I I was
[59:48] trying to share with the the brothers in
[59:51] in
[59:53] in in the men's meeting that
[59:57] if faith comes from God I have like no
[59:59] choice in it I I he's he's got to speak
[1:00:03] to me for it to be
[1:00:04] Faith it's got to come from his
[1:00:07] mouth it wasn't brother Bron that spoke
[1:00:10] the squirrels in
[1:00:13] existence it was God's word through
[1:00:16] brother brandham when God told him to do
[1:00:19] it brother brandham did it and it
[1:00:20] happened but brother BR says that that
[1:00:22] wasn't me that wasn't my choice to do
[1:00:25] that if it was he'd probably be doing it
[1:00:27] many more times and we'd read about it
[1:00:29] since
[1:00:31] then but this I want to say I believe
[1:00:34] this quote these quotes and there's like
[1:00:36] probably 60 or more of them in the
[1:00:38] throughout the message where he uses the
[1:00:40] right mental attitude that I have it
[1:00:42] that I have tangency to it's like trust
[1:00:46] in the Lord and he'll bring it to pass
[1:00:48] trust I can trust but I can't make God
[1:00:52] reveal anything to
[1:00:53] me but I believe that if I keep trusting
[1:00:57] if I keep um committing myself to him if
[1:01:01] if I just keep keep having the right
[1:01:04] manal attitude towards what his word is
[1:01:07] already said then God will bring the
[1:01:10] faith amen and it is I'm just saying if
[1:01:14] we apply this
[1:01:19] more he said it doesn't take Gifts of
[1:01:21] healing to heal sick
[1:01:24] people any person in ear has a right to
[1:01:27] meet Satan anywhere if you're a
[1:01:29] Christian and defeat him on any grounds
[1:01:33] that he could stand
[1:01:35] on wow that means God is not going to
[1:01:38] speak to everybody give him this this
[1:01:41] gift of healing to go pray for somebody
[1:01:43] and see them healed all you need is a
[1:01:45] right mental attitude because the word
[1:01:48] says do this and you can expect it to
[1:01:50] happen
[1:01:51] additions here is the first and only
[1:01:54] foundation for Divine Healing or
[1:01:56] anything from God is is the Bible he's
[1:01:59] just saying you use the Bible use God's
[1:02:01] word if you get off of that then you're
[1:02:03] out of God's will that's right and
[1:02:06] Divine Healing isn't a Hocus Pocus
[1:02:11] Affair it isn't saying a few mysterious
[1:02:13] words and somebody is
[1:02:15] hypnotized
[1:02:17] amen it's the truth revealed through
[1:02:19] Jesus Christ is Divine Healing he said
[1:02:22] that's right gifts of the Spirit are
[1:02:24] brought down to edif
[1:02:26] or other words it's the flag flying over
[1:02:30] the top of the building it's the
[1:02:32] appearance of the outside to attract the
[1:02:34] people in out of the rain see what I
[1:02:37] mean now gifts come from God if they are
[1:02:40] from God they'll testify of God and God
[1:02:43] will testify of them is that true yes
[1:02:45] says if you are sick pray until you
[1:02:48] believe with all your heart if you're
[1:02:52] sick he didn't say wait till you believe
[1:02:55] right
[1:02:57] he just said pray until you
[1:02:59] believe in other words you can trust
[1:03:03] that when you're praying faith is going
[1:03:05] to come and healing is going to come
[1:03:11] amen he said did you ever pray for
[1:03:14] something you just known was going to
[1:03:16] get it he said that's
[1:03:19] Faith now if you believe that with all
[1:03:21] your heart accept it and act on it now
[1:03:25] you can believe it just as much as you
[1:03:27] want to if you didn't act on it you'll
[1:03:30] just sit right there like a sinner would
[1:03:33] lay at the
[1:03:35] altar
[1:03:37] wow something about acting on the word
[1:03:42] not just saying I'm I believe I'm a
[1:03:44] Believer yeah amen I believe no act on
[1:03:47] it act on it God wants to see action you
[1:03:50] know God is not some some
[1:03:53] picture he's not some picture on a wall
[1:03:56] he's a God that lives in our heart he
[1:03:58] wants a live
[1:04:00] relationship he wants us to act upon him
[1:04:03] not just come to church twice a week are
[1:04:05] you with
[1:04:07] me God is looking for us to act and
[1:04:11] there's promises and we need to act on
[1:04:13] them amen he said if you got down there
[1:04:17] and prayed and prayed and you said Lord
[1:04:20] I know you saved me but that's just I I
[1:04:23] know he'll he'll never go through until
[1:04:26] he raises and confesses and says it with
[1:04:29] it and shows works with it yes so you
[1:04:34] just can't sit there and say well
[1:04:36] I I I repented I I got baptized and and
[1:04:41] that that's it that's it that's all I
[1:04:42] need to
[1:04:44] do no you got to continue on with What
[1:04:47] God Says to do next amen we did we did
[1:04:50] the first thing but we got to continue
[1:04:51] on you just you just can't sit there you
[1:04:55] got to rise
[1:04:57] confess and stay with it it shows the
[1:05:01] works with it James says just as a body
[1:05:05] is dead without the spirit so is faith
[1:05:08] without works no matter how much you
[1:05:10] believe so I imagine you know God said
[1:05:14] um oh yeah you're going to have a you're
[1:05:15] G to have a company right there this is
[1:05:16] where you're going to have your business
[1:05:17] and I said okay yeah that's great God
[1:05:18] see you
[1:05:20] later if I don't go act upon it if I
[1:05:23] don't go hey is this land for sale
[1:05:27] well you it's it's amazing how God just
[1:05:31] you know brought it all to pass but he
[1:05:34] didn't do it without me doing something
[1:05:36] without me acting by faith on it and and
[1:05:40] and if you want you want joy you want
[1:05:43] love you want peace you want you want
[1:05:46] wisdom you you want to grow in Christ
[1:05:48] you want to be more like you want to
[1:05:50] love like him you've got to act upon
[1:05:53] what you want you got to have that
[1:05:55] Vision this is is what I want this is
[1:05:56] and you you you you pray and you seek
[1:05:59] and you
[1:06:00] trust and it will happen faith will come
[1:06:04] faith will
[1:06:05] come you can't expect God to just always
[1:06:10] tell you
[1:06:13] everything where's the relationship
[1:06:15] that's
[1:06:16] robots he wants he wants to see us
[1:06:19] hunger and thirst after
[1:06:21] righteousness he wants us to to get down
[1:06:24] on our knees and wait upon the Lord that
[1:06:26] we might re receive our
[1:06:29] strength so we have a part to play in
[1:06:32] whatever we're looking for and and
[1:06:34] brother br's talking about every Divine
[1:06:36] promise of God will come to
[1:06:38] pass in the message the hour is come he
[1:06:42] says no that this holy spirit is here
[1:06:45] and he's just willing and he can work
[1:06:47] through the people as the people will
[1:06:49] let him work right do you do you believe
[1:06:52] that he said now there's where many uh
[1:06:56] there was many things that Jesus himself
[1:06:58] could not do because of unbelief is that
[1:07:01] right many things he could not do and we
[1:07:04] hate to think of that but he could not
[1:07:07] do it because of their
[1:07:09] unbelief now the right mental attitude
[1:07:12] all you along here do you understand
[1:07:14] what I mean when I say the right mental
[1:07:18] attitude your right mental attitude
[1:07:22] towards God's Divine promise will bring
[1:07:26] any promise to pass amen now he's not
[1:07:30] saying here he's not saying what you
[1:07:33] just
[1:07:34] just just believe it you you got to have
[1:07:37] faith to make God's promise come to pass
[1:07:41] which is a true statement by the way but
[1:07:44] but it almost seems
[1:07:46] untangle like we're waiting on God but
[1:07:49] brother Brandon says no there's an
[1:07:51] Avenue you don't have to wait on God you
[1:07:54] put your best foot for forward and up
[1:07:56] here in your mind have the right mental
[1:07:59] attitude up
[1:08:01] here in other words don't be wishy-washy
[1:08:05] that ain't the right mental attitude
[1:08:06] doubl minded man is unstable in all his
[1:08:08] ways this is this is the way walking in
[1:08:14] it now maybe you don't believe that you
[1:08:18] say well my faith is weak he said I
[1:08:21] wouldn't confess that
[1:08:23] see don't let the devil know
[1:08:28] that always say I've got good
[1:08:37] faith if you got any faith that comes
[1:08:39] from God of course the devil's going to
[1:08:42] make you feel like you don't got faith
[1:08:44] Devil's going to make you feel like
[1:08:45] you're not saved the devil's going to
[1:08:46] make you feel like you're not happy the
[1:08:48] devil's going to make you feel miserable
[1:08:50] that's his job am but there's something
[1:08:54] about fighting the good fight of Faith
[1:08:57] amen so always say I've got faith I
[1:09:00] believe God with all my heart see don't
[1:09:03] testify nothing of the devil amen and
[1:09:07] when you accept him as your healer don't
[1:09:10] ever act like you're sick or crippled
[1:09:14] anymore now that that this is a real
[1:09:16] hard one this is a real hard one because
[1:09:21] look if if you're if you're you're hurt
[1:09:23] you're crippled and you're walking and
[1:09:25] you're sick and
[1:09:26] you're things are going on in your lungs
[1:09:29] things are going on in your body you you
[1:09:31] can't help that is a real thing but your
[1:09:35] attitude towards it can be the right
[1:09:39] mental
[1:09:41] attitude that's what the prophet's
[1:09:43] telling
[1:09:47] us believe that you're healed take him
[1:09:51] at his word then it's all over on God
[1:09:55] God then and not on
[1:09:59] you
[1:10:03] wow we're waiting on God to give us
[1:10:05] faith and God's waiting on us to trust
[1:10:07] him
[1:10:11] right I can't make Faith come but I know
[1:10:15] I can trust
[1:10:17] him and my trust may be weak right now
[1:10:20] but it will grow to I can have a perfect
[1:10:22] trust in him amen
[1:10:30] as long as you take God at his word then
[1:10:33] the word will produce what it promised
[1:10:34] to produce is that right now have faith
[1:10:38] believe with all your heart and I love
[1:10:42] how he brings this the right mental
[1:10:44] attitude just produces it's really what
[1:10:47] it is it's how can you have how can you
[1:10:50] have faith that trusted tool is going to
[1:10:53] come and not have a right mental
[1:10:56] attitude towards it you understand when
[1:10:59] you have faith you have a right mental
[1:11:01] attitude but when you don't have faith
[1:11:03] you can still have a right mental
[1:11:05] attitude because that's all
[1:11:12] choice in the message God revealing
[1:11:14] himself to his people he says now many
[1:11:17] times this may seem strange everybody be
[1:11:21] real reverent if you can get the person
[1:11:26] just what I'm trying to do with due to
[1:11:28] the woman was get her in the right
[1:11:31] mental
[1:11:33] attitude and haven't quite heard it like
[1:11:36] that he he because he would say it like
[1:11:38] this in times he would say I'm just
[1:11:41] trying to get her faith raised right
[1:11:44] standing in the prayer line and he's
[1:11:46] trying to get her faith to raise and
[1:11:48] then all a sudden the spirit would go
[1:11:49] out in the audience and something would
[1:11:53] happen and it was the the whole thing
[1:11:56] was trying to get her faith to a place
[1:11:58] to receive what brother Bon was going to
[1:12:00] say and now he's saying in this place
[1:12:03] he's not using Faith he says I was
[1:12:05] trying to what I was trying to do with
[1:12:07] the woman was to get her in the right
[1:12:09] mental attitude
[1:12:14] right he
[1:12:17] says she wouldn't have to be prayed
[1:12:21] for with the right mental attitude amen
[1:12:26] that's why brother Brian was against
[1:12:27] somebody coming to the Altar and getting
[1:12:29] prayed over and over and over and over
[1:12:30] because you don't have the right mental
[1:12:37] attitude the right mental attitude
[1:12:39] towards any promise of God will bring it
[1:12:41] to pass the word is a
[1:12:45] seed and that s sowed in the ground and
[1:12:49] every seed will bring forth of its time
[1:12:51] if you need salvation the seed is here
[1:12:54] if you need he
[1:12:56] heing here's the seed in the word the
[1:12:59] word of God is the seed put it in your
[1:13:02] heart don't dig it up every morning to
[1:13:04] see if it's
[1:13:06] sprouted put it in there leave it in
[1:13:08] there it's God's business to bring it
[1:13:11] bring the
[1:13:12] Harvest you just leave it there water it
[1:13:14] by faith and praise every day thanking
[1:13:17] God for it every
[1:13:19] day I think I can do that I think I
[1:13:21] could take God's word and just say yes
[1:13:23] it's for me I'll hold to it and I'm not
[1:13:27] going to sit there and you know try to
[1:13:28] prove to somebody that I got faith I'm
[1:13:31] I'm just fa faith is Paul said have
[1:13:34] faith to
[1:13:36] yourself right didn't he say
[1:13:43] that I love this word in the message
[1:13:47] expectations he says I claim tonight
[1:13:49] this and God will confirm my
[1:13:52] claims that's right I claim that there's
[1:13:55] no disease too deep embedded there's no
[1:13:59] crippled too badly crippled there's no
[1:14:01] eyes too badly blind I have seen those
[1:14:04] were born literally blind and can and
[1:14:07] can even read now there's no disease too
[1:14:10] great but what our Lord hasn't already
[1:14:14] healed the right mental attitude towards
[1:14:17] God's Divine promise will heal every
[1:14:20] person in this building tonight
[1:14:26] I think there's something for us to tap
[1:14:27] into here I really
[1:14:30] do God is looking at us to get what we
[1:14:34] can get right in our facility right
[1:14:37] because he knows we can't manufacture
[1:14:40] Faith here right we can't put that there
[1:14:43] but we can get this thing right
[1:14:47] amen amen I say that not not being
[1:14:50] ashamed of my testimony and knowing this
[1:14:53] that in the presence of all almighty God
[1:14:56] I'll have to stand and give an account
[1:14:58] for everything that I've said every word
[1:15:01] that I spake will be brought before me
[1:15:04] in the judgment and I say this and I'm
[1:15:06] not afraid to make this statement
[1:15:08] allmighty God knows I want you to
[1:15:12] believe
[1:15:14] me I'll tell you this this one you know
[1:15:17] you could see certain things in his
[1:15:19] brother B's Ministry just kind of like
[1:15:20] unfolding and and growing and building
[1:15:23] because more Revelation was being
[1:15:26] added this one thing about a right manal
[1:15:28] atud it didn't change from the beginning
[1:15:30] to the end and that's what I love about
[1:15:33] this we don't wouldn't have time to read
[1:15:35] all the quotes the right mental attitude
[1:15:38] brother Braham said in the principles of
[1:15:39] Divine Healing towards any Divine
[1:15:41] promise of God will bring it to pass if
[1:15:43] you're a sinner confess your
[1:15:45] sins believe that God saved you and then
[1:15:48] go testify it tell people that you're
[1:15:51] saved it'll work righteousness right
[1:15:56] you think about
[1:15:57] that when we all got
[1:16:01] saved we couldn't go to anybody and
[1:16:04] prove
[1:16:05] it right but our lives just started
[1:16:09] changing and then before you know it
[1:16:11] people saw
[1:16:15] it he uses this example the right man
[1:16:18] attitude about just being saved just
[1:16:20] confess
[1:16:22] It Go testify
[1:16:25] believe that God saved you okay then
[1:16:27] believe the other promises you want more
[1:16:29] love believe it you want more joy
[1:16:32] believe it you want more peace believe
[1:16:34] it you believe it and then you begin to
[1:16:37] act on it there's if there's anything
[1:16:40] that's you know brother Braham said the
[1:16:41] sickest body that there is is the body
[1:16:43] of Christ and if she just acted on what
[1:16:46] God has already provided to bring
[1:16:48] healing he's waiting on
[1:16:51] us when we're sitting around waiting on
[1:16:53] him
[1:16:55] what a trick of the
[1:16:58] devil and I've
[1:17:01] seen sarus cancer healed by the right
[1:17:07] mental
[1:17:09] attitude towards God's Divine
[1:17:13] word that that's a testimony in itself
[1:17:16] right
[1:17:16] there all right seeking after Jesus now
[1:17:19] listen to this closely any Divine
[1:17:22] promise of God the right mental attitude
[1:17:25] towards any Divine promise of God will
[1:17:26] bring it to pass if you can look at it
[1:17:29] right believe it in the way that it's
[1:17:32] written God it's your word and take the
[1:17:37] right mental attitude towards the Divine
[1:17:39] promise it'll bring it to pass because
[1:17:42] there's no defeat faith cannot be
[1:17:44] defeated there's no defeat in Faith H
[1:17:48] now in this he's interwoven the right
[1:17:51] mental attitude and Faith but to be
[1:17:54] honest with you when you know you have
[1:17:56] absolute Faith you heard from God
[1:17:59] brother B says you don't even have to
[1:18:00] get prayed
[1:18:01] for you just know it's going to
[1:18:05] happen but unless you have that you need
[1:18:09] to build whatever you do have so say
[1:18:12] it's a little mustard grain seed or say
[1:18:15] you just have the right man to take it
[1:18:17] any way you want to but you've got to
[1:18:19] act upon it take it in your heart let's
[1:18:22] look at the syap phenician woman who
[1:18:24] wanted healing for her daughter with had
[1:18:27] an unclean Spirit she literally came the
[1:18:30] Bible says she came to Jesus worshiping
[1:18:34] now this would have been pretty much a
[1:18:37] slam dunk here's somebody that really
[1:18:40] believed right if how many people have
[1:18:42] worshiped you
[1:18:44] today right I mean nobody worships so
[1:18:49] when this person came to Jesus it was
[1:18:52] real and it seemed like Jesus wasn't
[1:18:55] even interested in her
[1:18:59] need he said for it's not meat to take
[1:19:01] the children's bread and to cast it unto
[1:19:05] the dogs yes
[1:19:10] wow Jesus was walking in this certain
[1:19:13] direction you know it ain't nothing to
[1:19:15] do with you I just I'm sorry I don't
[1:19:18] even look at you is
[1:19:20] worthy of being he of of your request
[1:19:23] for your daughter to be be
[1:19:26] heal but you know she wasn't
[1:19:29] deterred look at her
[1:19:31] attitude yes Lord yet the dogs under the
[1:19:35] table eat the children's
[1:19:40] crumbs she never got offended by the
[1:19:42] word when she came to
[1:19:43] church she didn't start accusing the man
[1:19:47] of God for being
[1:19:50] rude she never felt disrespected by
[1:19:53] Jesus
[1:19:56] she had what the prophet taught was the
[1:19:58] right mental
[1:20:01] attitude and Jesus said these words he
[1:20:03] said for this
[1:20:06] saying go thy way the devil has gone out
[1:20:09] of thy daughter for this
[1:20:13] saying for just saying the right mental
[1:20:19] attitude I I just believe this word is
[1:20:22] amazing amen the right mental attitude
[1:20:26] brings about a faith that God honors
[1:20:29] your
[1:20:30] attitude he he does look Satan left
[1:20:34] Heaven because his attitude became what
[1:20:36] I want to be like God I want to do this
[1:20:39] I want my will I want to be like the
[1:20:40] most high his
[1:20:42] attitude um it it it changed to
[1:20:48] self-centeredness and so God looks at an
[1:20:52] attitude greatly and I think a lot of
[1:20:54] people people miss out on a close
[1:20:56] relationship with God because they don't
[1:20:58] care about their attitude I don't want
[1:21:00] to get into that today but I want to
[1:21:02] show us that we can have more from God
[1:21:04] if we just have the right mental
[1:21:06] attitude I I I'll say it like this I
[1:21:09] want to entitle this message cash in
[1:21:11] with the right mental attitude this
[1:21:13] woman cashed
[1:21:14] in got what she needed by just having
[1:21:17] the right mental
[1:21:18] attitude the same thing with the
[1:21:20] Centurion beseeching Jesus for one of
[1:21:23] his servants who was grievously
[1:21:25] tormented the Bible said and Jesus said
[1:21:27] all right I'm going to go in your
[1:21:28] direction you know I I'm going to come
[1:21:30] and I'm going to
[1:21:32] heal and the Centurion answered and said
[1:21:35] Lord I am not worthy that you should
[1:21:37] come in this direction that you should
[1:21:39] come under my roof but speak the word
[1:21:42] only and my servant shall be
[1:21:46] healed he just had the right
[1:21:52] attitude he says for I'm a man of their
[1:21:54] Authority having soldiers under me and I
[1:21:56] say to this man go and goeth and and to
[1:21:58] another come and he cometh and to my
[1:22:00] servant do this and he doeth it and when
[1:22:03] Jesus heard it he marveled and said unto
[1:22:05] them that follow verely I say unto you I
[1:22:07] have not found so great faith no not in
[1:22:12] Israel and the Centurion didn't have
[1:22:15] some some uh he didn't have a vision of
[1:22:20] what was going to happen let me just say
[1:22:22] it like this Jesus was going this way
[1:22:23] hey let's go to your home
[1:22:25] home and all of a sudden no so it wasn't
[1:22:29] like even Jesus had the vision to go to
[1:22:33] the home he just spoke the word and he
[1:22:36] said whoa no I'm not worthy that you'd
[1:22:39] come and
[1:22:41] that that that humbleness attracted
[1:22:47] God and then he he gave a reason look
[1:22:50] your word is all that I need
[1:22:54] so it's the right mental attitude
[1:22:56] towards any Divine promise it's the
[1:23:00] word we don't need to prove it it's
[1:23:03] already been proven by God we believe
[1:23:05] God so we're just taking the right
[1:23:08] mental attitude towards it and we're
[1:23:09] we're just going to March forward with
[1:23:12] all that we have and keep
[1:23:14] trusting what about the man that brother
[1:23:17] Brandon prayed for he was blind right he
[1:23:20] came through the line he was blind and
[1:23:22] he came through the line brother br
[1:23:24] you're healed as thus sayith the Lord
[1:23:26] and he walked off the platform and he
[1:23:28] was praising God but he was still blind
[1:23:30] and he sat there a while and the devil
[1:23:32] got talking to
[1:23:34] him he says well maybe you didn't get
[1:23:39] enough and so he came right back on the
[1:23:44] platform and just you know just need you
[1:23:47] to pray for me again I just you know I I
[1:23:49] still can't see you know obviously you
[1:23:51] know something's wrong brother BR says
[1:23:53] well wait wait a minute God said you're
[1:24:00] healed brother bam told him says you
[1:24:02] just leave and you keep testifying of
[1:24:06] your
[1:24:07] healing he had to take this attitude
[1:24:10] that wasn't quite right and brother
[1:24:13] Brandon just pointed him to a right
[1:24:15] mental attitude just go and confess
[1:24:18] it he didn't have a revelation you
[1:24:21] understand he didn't have that Faith he
[1:24:23] just heard the word said you are
[1:24:25] healed and he he left and he kept
[1:24:28] testifying it testifying of it and
[1:24:30] before long God said okay I'm G to I'm
[1:24:33] going to give him his heart's desire I'm
[1:24:35] going to bring this Divine promise to
[1:24:37] pass because he had a right mental
[1:24:40] attitude we know the story in the barber
[1:24:41] chair
[1:24:43] right I just I just see the power in in
[1:24:47] having the right mental attitude Our
[1:24:49] Lives can
[1:24:51] change look at non he had an
[1:24:55] attitude but it wasn't the right
[1:24:57] attitude was
[1:24:59] it the the word just told him go wash in
[1:25:06] Jordan and he just thought he was he was
[1:25:09] better than that he didn't need to do
[1:25:11] what the church was telling him to
[1:25:15] do and he just got this little old
[1:25:17] attitude in his
[1:25:20] home just going to fight and fuss and
[1:25:24] he had somebody there that loved
[1:25:30] him spent a few minutes with him to try
[1:25:33] to tell him look just follow what the
[1:25:37] word
[1:25:38] says and you know what he did he changed
[1:25:41] his attitude it became a right manal
[1:25:44] attitude why because it was based on the
[1:25:45] word the word said go washing Jordan and
[1:25:47] if you just have your mind on the right
[1:25:50] on the
[1:25:51] word it'll come to pass and so he got
[1:25:55] his mind off of those clean
[1:25:57] Waters and he put his mind right where
[1:25:59] God told him to put it and he did what
[1:26:01] he he was supposed to do and after this
[1:26:04] I don't know if it was the seventh time
[1:26:06] he came up and he was clean
[1:26:08] amen oh because of the right manal
[1:26:11] attitude he already had the word the
[1:26:13] word was given to him but if we question
[1:26:15] the word I can't get healed I can't get
[1:26:17] better I can't get healthier I I I can't
[1:26:20] get more joy I can't get more of Christ
[1:26:22] if you keep that at itude it cannot come
[1:26:25] to
[1:26:26] pass so you got to make a stand I'm
[1:26:29] against that I'm going to agree with the
[1:26:32] word brother bam said in the message
[1:26:35] taking God at his word he says but I
[1:26:37] believe every word of it to be true and
[1:26:39] every Divine promise is a seed that will
[1:26:42] produce just exactly what it said it
[1:26:44] will do
[1:26:46] if that word
[1:26:48] again remember why we spent so much time
[1:26:51] at the beginning if you'll take the
[1:26:53] right mental attitude remember this the
[1:26:57] right mental attitude towards any Divine
[1:26:59] promise will bring it to pass try it
[1:27:03] don't say try it just go do
[1:27:08] it if you got enough behind you to push
[1:27:12] you and say I can do it by the grace of
[1:27:16] God I will do it then God is with you
[1:27:19] think about that if you got enough in
[1:27:22] you to say I I I'm G to move forward in
[1:27:25] this I'm going to trust God as God's
[1:27:27] word I'm moving forward he said God is
[1:27:30] with you god what because God's with his
[1:27:34] word don't wait till you have
[1:27:38] faith let that sound strong don't wait
[1:27:42] till you have faith but just start
[1:27:44] acting upon the word with the right
[1:27:46] mental
[1:27:47] attitude faith will
[1:27:50] come he says he said then God's with you
[1:27:53] but if you're just a wishy-washy well
[1:27:56] I'll go up and I'll see if they can do
[1:27:58] anything for me he says
[1:28:01] no that won't
[1:28:05] work you can say Amen because I want to
[1:28:07] go on to the next thing okay
[1:28:11] okay now
[1:28:13] Jonah Jonah made up his mind that he
[1:28:16] wasn't going to be led by God or do
[1:28:19] God's
[1:28:20] will I'll say anybody who has the idea
[1:28:24] that you're just going to do what you
[1:28:25] want to
[1:28:26] do you got the wrong mental
[1:28:31] attitude you know what God just said
[1:28:33] okay go that's what you want to do go he
[1:28:35] didn't stop him he let him do his own
[1:28:38] thing we know the scriptures that the
[1:28:40] way of a transgressor is hard and things
[1:28:43] got real hard for Jonah in the midst of
[1:28:46] his bleakest Darkest Hours Jonah still
[1:28:49] had power to change his
[1:28:52] attitude and I love this doesn't matter
[1:28:56] how bad it
[1:28:57] is Charles Sendo says that's the one
[1:28:59] thing you got the right you have a a
[1:29:03] choice in your
[1:29:05] attitude and what did he
[1:29:07] do he took on the right mental
[1:29:10] attitude he just
[1:29:13] changed the way that he viewed God's
[1:29:17] word for his life and you know what it
[1:29:20] did it brought the Divine promise of God
[1:29:22] to pass which he needed obviously being
[1:29:24] in the the well the the well the the
[1:29:27] belly of the well or
[1:29:30] the you you know what the great fish
[1:29:34] that was prepared for
[1:29:35] him Jonah 2 verse4 thou thou I cast uh I
[1:29:42] am cast out of thy sight yet I will look
[1:29:45] again toward thy Holy Temple amen so he
[1:29:50] knew he was cast
[1:29:51] out but he took you know he was the one
[1:29:54] that left right and if we leave God then
[1:29:57] we're separating right the word you
[1:29:59] abide in the word the word abides in you
[1:30:01] then say what you will come to pass so
[1:30:04] he looked again towards the temple
[1:30:06] saying okay I'm I'm turning
[1:30:09] around I I didn't want to go towards the
[1:30:11] temple I didn't want to do God's will
[1:30:13] but now in this terrible situation I'm
[1:30:16] I'm going to I'm going to go to
[1:30:20] church and when my soul fainted within
[1:30:23] me I remember remembered the Lord verse
[1:30:25] 7 and my prayer came in unto thee into
[1:30:28] thy Holy Temple they that observe Lyon
[1:30:31] vanities forsake their own
[1:30:33] mercies but I will sacrifice unto thee
[1:30:36] with the voice of Thanksgiving I will
[1:30:39] pay that that I have vowed salvation of
[1:30:42] the Lord salvation is of the Lord and
[1:30:44] the Lord spake unto the fish and it
[1:30:47] vomited out Jonah upon dry
[1:30:50] land wow so Jonah was in there did he
[1:30:53] get sound like like
[1:30:55] Revelation did he have faith be when he
[1:30:58] was on the
[1:30:59] ship I want you to see that there was a
[1:31:01] reality that God lets us play out our
[1:31:04] life the way we want
[1:31:06] to and God the Bible says God is able to
[1:31:10] make all grace abound to you and it
[1:31:13] wasn't until Jonah got the right mental
[1:31:15] attitude and start doing the right thing
[1:31:17] that God spoke to the
[1:31:21] fish and God wants to speak to our fish
[1:31:24] fish yes God wants to speak to our fishy
[1:31:30] situation Jonah cashed in with the right
[1:31:33] mental attitude last
[1:31:36] quote show us the father 63 brother B
[1:31:40] says and now I realize that this is
[1:31:42] being
[1:31:43] taped these tapes we have a tape
[1:31:46] Ministry all over the world and many
[1:31:48] people just here tonight where about a
[1:31:51] thousand people are listening before the
[1:31:55] tape stops there'll be 10,000 time 10
[1:31:58] there'll be 10 times 10,000 hear it and
[1:32:01] see around the world so now he's making
[1:32:04] this statement of how many people are
[1:32:06] going to hear what he's going to say
[1:32:08] right here and I go on record I say this
[1:32:12] about the word of God being a seed if
[1:32:15] you can take the right mental attitude
[1:32:17] towards any Divine promise of God it
[1:32:19] will bring it to pass if you can get
[1:32:22] yourself in
[1:32:25] position to believe that the promise was
[1:32:28] to
[1:32:29] you boy if this this one this one the
[1:32:33] way he explains
[1:32:35] it he says if you can get yourself in a
[1:32:40] position where the position is in a
[1:32:43] position to believe in other words you
[1:32:45] don't believe it
[1:32:46] yet you just have the right man attitude
[1:32:49] you don't believe it yet but get in a
[1:32:51] position to believe it that the promise
[1:32:55] was to
[1:32:59] you let's stand together I want to read
[1:33:02] the the three verses there's three words
[1:33:05] and three verses that will help us get
[1:33:07] in
[1:33:08] position to believe for any Divine
[1:33:11] promise of God and it's in it's in
[1:33:13] Psalms 37 and as I was walking back to
[1:33:16] the men's meeting this scripture came to
[1:33:18] me and this is what we we opened up with
[1:33:21] we really didn't even read all three
[1:33:22] verses
[1:33:24] that's we we just got so involved in our
[1:33:27] in our uh but if we can put that up on
[1:33:29] the board Psalms 37: 34 and
[1:33:33] five says trust here's the three words
[1:33:36] in each verse it's the first word trust
[1:33:39] delight and commit trust in the Lord
[1:33:43] Delight thyself also in the Lord and
[1:33:46] commit thy way unto the Lord now you can
[1:33:48] do
[1:33:48] that you can trust you can delight
[1:33:52] yourself I I'm going to remind you today
[1:33:54] Lord that I'm taking a stand here I'm
[1:33:56] going to praise you that eventually this
[1:33:58] is things this is going to come to pass
[1:34:00] in my life and the third is just commit
[1:34:04] it commit it to God don't don't sit
[1:34:06] there and and and and and and keep
[1:34:09] battling back and forth with the devil
[1:34:10] take a
[1:34:12] stand faith will
[1:34:15] come faith will come commit thy way unto
[1:34:19] the Lord trust also in him and he shall
[1:34:22] bring it to
[1:34:25] pass wow the right mental
[1:34:29] attitude how many
[1:34:32] desires to exercise more of a right
[1:34:34] mental attitude amen let's let's look to
[1:34:37] him in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we
[1:34:40] need
[1:34:43] you we need thee as the song goes every
[1:34:46] hour Lord Satan is always buffing us
[1:34:50] always hammering us over the head always
[1:34:52] trying to
[1:34:54] to to to get us to even question
[1:34:57] sometimes our Salvation where we're
[1:35:00] standing our relationship with
[1:35:04] you people are Fallen Away by
[1:35:08] the by the
[1:35:10] numbers but Lord your word is just as
[1:35:13] true today as the first time we've ever
[1:35:14] heard
[1:35:16] it your word has not dis diminished your
[1:35:19] power hasn't diminished
[1:35:24] but Lord we found a little a little
[1:35:27] rope as it were that that
[1:35:31] Rahab let
[1:35:34] down something that we can hold on to
[1:35:37] today that we can exercise we can leave
[1:35:40] here and exercise our right manal
[1:35:43] attitude and know that faith will
[1:35:46] come and that you honor Faith Lord but
[1:35:50] we know according to this message today
[1:35:52] and throughout the message message Lord
[1:35:54] that you sent through your Prophet that
[1:35:57] you do honor a right mental attitude to
[1:36:00] the point that it will bring any of your
[1:36:02] Divine promises to pass amen so God
[1:36:05] we're holding on to that today and as we
[1:36:08] lord are coming to you in prayer now you
[1:36:10] see our hearts and our hands are mid
[1:36:11] lifted just Desiring to exercise more of
[1:36:14] that right mental attitude I pray that
[1:36:16] you would give us the grace to do
[1:36:19] that remind us Lord over and over amen
[1:36:24] may we share with one another what this
[1:36:26] word that we heard to remember what we
[1:36:29] heard what the prophet said
[1:36:32] amen that Lord we could just start
[1:36:34] putting it into
[1:36:37] action for Lord there's so many things
[1:36:39] in our life that we love to see come to
[1:36:42] pass and we know that
[1:36:44] Lord shall we say the greatest you said
[1:36:49] that that we're going to be just like
[1:36:51] you when you appear Lord and he that has
[1:36:54] this hope in him purifies
[1:36:57] himself Lord we want to be like you we
[1:36:59] want to be in your image we want to be
[1:37:01] in your lightness we want to have the
[1:37:03] same love and the same spirit and Lord
[1:37:06] to be just like
[1:37:08] you so I pray heavenly father that you
[1:37:10] would just bless us with the right
[1:37:12] mental attitude help us to start
[1:37:14] exercising that Lord whether it be in
[1:37:16] our homes or at work or in our in our
[1:37:19] with our families our texting Lord our
[1:37:22] friends our neighbors even our enemies
