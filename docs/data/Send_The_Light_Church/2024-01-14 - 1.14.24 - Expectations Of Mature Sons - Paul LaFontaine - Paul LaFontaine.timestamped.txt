[37:05] praise the Lord I'm so happy to see such
[37:06] a good turnout this morning I don't know
[37:09] who normally comes but man for this cold
[37:10] weather this is good and I'm glad to be
[37:13] here with you this is great and um just
[37:15] to know that the arctic cold is out
[37:18] there it was pretty cold for all of us
[37:20] and to make the effort to come out and
[37:22] be in the house of God and fellowship
[37:23] together I think it's a wonderful thing
[37:25] and to be around friends and family here
[37:28] this this church isn't just uh this
[37:30] church is family and we've been in this
[37:32] journey for many many years and together
[37:35] and we know each other and we are
[37:37] thanking thanking God last night for
[37:39] Brother John and his wife and their
[37:42] faithfulness faithfulness to the message
[37:44] and to Christ and preaching it is to be
[37:47] commended today because there's some
[37:49] dropping by the way side there's some
[37:51] bailing out there some have taken
[37:53] reasoning and so it should be uh
[37:57] appreciated when someone has been
[37:59] faithful this many years to keep doing
[38:02] it people come and go things go up and
[38:05] down but to stay consistent and to have
[38:08] sheep that are consistent say we're
[38:10] sticking with it uh rain or shine we're
[38:12] sticking with what God sent us in this
[38:14] age we're going to keep preaching it big
[38:16] numbers or Little Numbers it doesn't
[38:18] matter we keep preaching it because it
[38:20] is not our message this is not our
[38:22] message it's God's message and it's what
[38:25] he sent and and uh the the privilege is
[38:28] greater than the
[38:30] pressure um the vision is greater than
[38:33] the burden because there is a burden but
[38:36] the the vision that God had for this age
[38:38] is greater than the burdens that we
[38:40] would bear to Bear it uh God's vision is
[38:43] always greater than the
[38:45] circumstances God's vision is bigger
[38:47] than us it's bigger than you it's bigger
[38:50] than troubles uh it's his vision and he
[38:53] will see it through and and I'm just
[38:55] glad to be amongst family this morning
[38:56] and when brother John says I'm busy I
[38:58] don't want to be busy I really don't uh
[39:02] my wife and I are trying to make some
[39:04] adjustments because I'm not in my 30s
[39:06] anymore I'm not in my 40s anymore and uh
[39:09] in my 50s so we're trying to make some
[39:11] adjustments to that because I really
[39:13] just want to love the Lord serve him I
[39:16] want to keep doing things for the Lord
[39:17] but God raises up the Next Generation to
[39:20] carry on the word so I want to encourage
[39:22] them to carry it on through and I really
[39:25] just want to preach feed the sheep and
[39:27] write songs that's basically what I'm
[39:29] coming down to that's all I want to do
[39:31] and let the other stuff go praise the
[39:33] Lord but it is uh good to be amongst
[39:36] family here this morning and to hear the
[39:39] voices and the music go before God I
[39:42] love it and uh I join in with it and I
[39:45] don't know what about this age Brother
[39:46] Bruce it just seems like the the lyrics
[39:48] we can sing songs like that but we can
[39:51] miss the lyrics and I know what it is at
[39:53] this age I just the lyrics so minister
[39:55] to me uh as we see what God inspired
[39:57] those men to write they're so true and
[39:59] they're so relevant to our lives even to
[40:01] today and uh I just I ministered to by
[40:04] them I have I I could sing a couple I
[40:07] always ask my wife to sing she don't
[40:08] sing with me much anymore and um so
[40:11] she's I don't know why but she leaves it
[40:13] to me and then when all the kids come
[40:15] along then she really don't want to sing
[40:16] she wants to let them sing and then when
[40:18] they're around I let them sing too I
[40:20] don't sing and I used to be my wife's
[40:22] favorite
[40:23] singer and then my son Gideon came along
[40:26] and I'm no long I'm no longer her
[40:28] favorite and she lets me know that and
[40:30] he's he's I I enjoy him too I enjoy him
[40:33] too I used to get invited to all the
[40:35] weddings to sing I don't get to invited
[40:37] to any weddings my son and all the kids
[40:39] get invited so I'm just there in the
[40:41] back row of the wedding just observing
[40:44] basically that's that's how it happens
[40:46] you know after so many years so I um my
[40:49] sister um asked me to write uh she was
[40:51] doing some new uh new Christmas songs
[40:54] and she asked me to write some Christmas
[40:56] songs songs and I only got to one but I
[40:58] thought I would do that this morning um

[52:09] if you'd read this morning in Romans
[52:11] chapter 8 we'll share a portion of the
[52:13] word and fellowship around the word this
[52:15] morning in Romans 8 and um we pray that
[52:19] we can be a blessing to you amen and the
[52:22] local congregation here praise the Lord
[52:26] Romans chapter 8 verse
[52:28] 14 for as many as are led by the spirit
[52:32] of God they are the sons of God for ye
[52:35] have not received the spirit of bondage
[52:36] against to fear but we have received the
[52:39] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[52:42] Father when we receive the Holy Ghost
[52:45] it's called here the spirit of adoption
[52:48] which to me means we receive something
[52:50] within us that begins a journey of
[52:52] bringing us to full adoption bringing
[52:55] bringing us to full maturity um when we
[52:58] receive that Spirit of adoption we have
[53:00] all the potential already within us to
[53:02] take us to full adoption the spirit
[53:04] itself bear witness with our spirit that
[53:06] we are the children of God and if
[53:08] children then heirs Heirs of God and
[53:11] join HS with Christ if so be that we
[53:13] suffer with him that we may be also
[53:16] glorified together for I reckon that the
[53:18] sufferings of this present time are not
[53:20] even worthy to be compared with the
[53:23] glory which shall be revealed in US us
[53:25] for the earnest expectation that's where
[53:28] I want to take my text from the earnest
[53:30] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[53:33] the manifestation of the sons of God for
[53:36] the creature was made subject of vanity
[53:38] not willingly but by reason of him who
[53:40] had subjected the same in hope all of
[53:42] creation fell when Adam and Eve fell
[53:45] everything would become subject to this
[53:47] fall verse 21 because the creature
[53:50] itself also shall be delivered from the
[53:52] bondage of corruption into the Glorious
[53:54] Liberty of the children of God as we get
[53:57] our Liberty and come to our adoption and
[53:59] restoration and Redemption all of
[54:02] creation comes with us for we know that
[54:05] the whole creation Groth and travaileth
[54:07] in pain together until now and not only
[54:10] they but ourselves also which have the
[54:12] first fruits of the spirit even we
[54:15] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[54:18] for the adoption to it the Redemption of
[54:21] our body Amen to the word of God father
[54:25] father we ask you to help us this
[54:26] morning learn something from your word
[54:28] we ask you to anoint it Lord we ask you
[54:30] to come and be present Among Us Lord
[54:33] greatest thing that we can receive is
[54:35] revelation from you so we know how to
[54:37] live and receive strength and Lord we
[54:39] pray every person here every one
[54:42] listening online every uh maybe some
[54:44] couldn't come because of the weather we
[54:46] pray you Minister each one even the
[54:48] children the teenagers everyone that's
[54:50] here be personal to them this morning
[54:53] Lord come alongside them father and just
[54:55] draw their hearts to you through your
[54:58] word and we commit this service in this
[55:00] day to you in jesus' name amen God bless
[55:04] you may be
[55:08] seated so we want to take this portion
[55:12] of scripture and um just elaborate on it
[55:15] and see what the Lord would speak
[55:16] through it this morning and it's been a
[55:19] subject that uh for many many years that
[55:21] I've en enjoyed and pondered and thought
[55:24] about but I guess will just title this
[55:26] this morning the expectation of mature
[55:29] Sons um expectation is a a beautiful
[55:33] thing um expectation and expecting
[55:36] something uh whether it be in this life
[55:39] or with God but we know the greatest
[55:41] expectation we can have is what God will
[55:43] do what God's going to do next what is
[55:47] what is happening with God and that that
[55:49] creates something within us and that's
[55:52] expectation and we know about expect
[55:55] ation from a little child because we
[55:57] know what it is to expect and be looking
[55:59] forward to something that's coming ahead
[56:01] whether it's your birthday or whether
[56:03] it's something that's a a date that's
[56:05] coming ahead or a holiday or something
[56:08] and so we've learned to be under
[56:10] expectation for something that will
[56:12] bring us joy something that will
[56:15] encourage us and just the thought of the
[56:17] expectation of it has joy in it am and
[56:20] so expectation is a great thing because
[56:24] it brings Joy and in this scripture in
[56:26] um 19 it says the the it speaks of an
[56:30] Earnest expectation an Earnest
[56:33] expectation and that means it it's eager
[56:36] it's an intense expectation there's a
[56:38] passion that goes with it it's something
[56:41] to look forward to and he and here in
[56:44] scripture we have for the earnest
[56:46] expectation of the creature it even
[56:48] tells us that all of creation all of the
[56:51] animals all the animal kingdom is all
[56:54] under
[56:55] expectation it's all looking forward to
[56:58] the restoration of this Earth because
[57:00] this Earth fell and and sin came on this
[57:03] Earth and sin begin to take over and now
[57:06] you know you have uh uh the things
[57:09] killing animals not just for meat that's
[57:11] fine but killing them randomly and so
[57:13] all of creation lives in nervousness of
[57:15] that well we have killing on the streets
[57:17] we have killing in cities we have
[57:19] killing in little cities going on people
[57:21] killing one another that's because we've
[57:23] had 6,000 years of sin on the earth Adam
[57:25] and Eve fell and so now the whole earth
[57:28] fell with it and so now because we've
[57:31] Fallen God put in his word that there's
[57:33] going to be a full restoration to take
[57:36] us back to Eden again and somehow in
[57:39] creation it knows this expectation it is
[57:43] expecting for God to restore it
[57:45] completely back so listen let me say it
[57:48] this morning if all of creation has an
[57:50] expectation of complete restoration
[57:53] ought we to have an expect expectation
[57:55] in our heart God has not finished the
[57:57] job in you yet God has much more to do
[58:00] in you yet and we should be under joy
[58:03] and expectation of that an expectation
[58:06] you know it's it's we it should be eager
[58:09] intense and if we lose expectation of
[58:11] Life uh life becomes boring amen even
[58:15] the Christian Life can become boring if
[58:17] we don't have have
[58:19] expectation of what God's going to do
[58:21] next I think when we come to church we
[58:23] should be under expectation
[58:25] every service every Wednesday night
[58:27] because you see we're not dealing with
[58:28] just the pastor or just another service
[58:30] we're dealing with God we're dealing
[58:33] with God we're going to meet with God
[58:35] and God could do anything he could drop
[58:37] a little Revelation in your heart on a
[58:39] Wednesday night even and you realize
[58:41] that's the most powerful thing that's
[58:42] ever happened in your life but you see
[58:45] now we have to be under expectation of
[58:48] God God we're looking forward to what
[58:51] you want to do when you come to church
[58:52] you'll sing different if you're under
[58:54] expect
[58:55] you'll say Amen different if you're
[58:57] under expectation you'll drive distances
[59:00] to get to church because why expectation
[59:04] and earnestness and eagerness does that
[59:06] to you I'm looking forward to what God
[59:08] can do if we lose that we lose the joy
[59:10] of life we lose the joy of serving the
[59:12] lord and it's not just coming to church
[59:14] every day we should be under expectation
[59:18] God what are you going to do today what
[59:19] can you do through me today every day is
[59:22] a new day with my Lord every day his
[59:25] mercies are new every morning whatever
[59:28] happened yesterday is yesterday what God
[59:30] what are you going to do today and we
[59:32] should live under this expectation or we
[59:34] become dead life becomes boring life
[59:38] becomes a a
[59:39] drag but when you got expectation then
[59:43] you have something to look forward to
[59:45] especially in God now when you realize
[59:49] the season that we're in spiritually
[59:51] right now scripturally uh it's very very
[59:55] exciting because we've been a people
[59:58] that has able to see I'm just going to
[59:59] jump right to I know you're taught well
[1:00:02] here so I'm going to jump right to some
[1:00:03] things we know but I want to remind you
[1:00:05] of them that we're in a season now it's
[1:00:07] very exciting because we've been the
[1:00:09] people to be able to see things in the
[1:00:12] Bible that has been fulfilled already
[1:00:15] right in front of us scripture has been
[1:00:17] fulfilled right in front of us uh and
[1:00:20] God said something he would do for this
[1:00:22] age God said that he would uh send us
[1:00:25] Elijah the prophet and he promised that
[1:00:28] all the way back in the Bible and then
[1:00:30] he did it in front of us he sent that
[1:00:32] and he's already finished his commission
[1:00:34] to bring us back to the word so that's
[1:00:36] something that we know God said he would
[1:00:38] do and we're a people privileged to see
[1:00:40] wow we've seen that happen in front of
[1:00:42] us so we we know that God is able to
[1:00:46] fulfill his word I like the song Brother
[1:00:49] Bruce sang this morning that that hymn
[1:00:51] that says I know I may not know a lot of
[1:00:53] things but I know he's able to keep that
[1:00:56] which I've committed to him I'm
[1:00:59] persuaded that he's able to keep his
[1:01:00] word and guess what too here's another
[1:01:02] thing God never disappoints amen if
[1:01:06] we're under expectations the right
[1:01:08] expectations for the word God never
[1:01:10] disappoints now when you go through
[1:01:12] things in life it looks like God's
[1:01:14] disappointed you it looks like maybe
[1:01:16] sometimes you didn't get your request
[1:01:18] but when you step back and look at the
[1:01:20] whole picture of your life I can tell
[1:01:22] you he's got 6,000 years of history he's
[1:01:25] got a perfect track record he's always
[1:01:27] kept his word he's never disappointed
[1:01:30] he's always been right on time God never
[1:01:34] disappoints
[1:01:35] you people will disappoint you people
[1:01:39] will disappoint you and you'll
[1:01:41] disappoint yourself but don't ever let
[1:01:44] the devil tell you that God will
[1:01:46] disappoint you just because he doesn't
[1:01:48] answer a prayer right on time or
[1:01:50] whatever God never disappoints us God
[1:01:53] always comes comes through can you say
[1:01:57] amen and I can trust a god like that he
[1:02:00] never disappoints and so now we are
[1:02:02] gathering of people who are blessed to
[1:02:04] see scripture fulfilled in our time
[1:02:06] right in front of us what was expected
[1:02:08] for the end
[1:02:09] times just it's happened just like God
[1:02:12] said he would do it and and we all know
[1:02:15] that and but then with knowing we've
[1:02:17] seen things fulfilled I'm going to give
[1:02:19] you some scriptures that have already
[1:02:20] been fulfilled in our age seeing it's
[1:02:23] been fulfilled this we know that it's
[1:02:25] not all completed yet it's not all
[1:02:28] fulfilled yet one of the reasons we know
[1:02:31] that is we're still sitting here in
[1:02:32] church in
[1:02:34] 2024 and none of us expected to uh be
[1:02:37] here this long okay one of the reasons
[1:02:40] we know there's still some some to be
[1:02:41] fulfilled is we're still here this
[1:02:43] morning um you know I never thought uh I
[1:02:46] never I thought we'd be in the coming of
[1:02:48] the Lord Brother Bruce I thought I'd
[1:02:50] never finish High School of course my
[1:02:53] parent my parents thought I'd never
[1:02:55] finish high school but it was for other
[1:02:57] reasons they thought I'd never finished
[1:02:59] high school too but but but I thought
[1:03:01] I'd never get to finishing High School I
[1:03:03] thought the coming of the Lord he going
[1:03:05] to come and then so now my 20s and my
[1:03:07] 30s and I thought no this will be over
[1:03:09] in a long time God sent the prophet bang
[1:03:11] bang bang we're done we're out of here
[1:03:12] and here we are in 2024 and we don't
[1:03:14] know all the reasons why but we know
[1:03:17] there's still more to be
[1:03:18] fulfilled there must be more to come
[1:03:21] from our lives
[1:03:23] yet because a a link to the Rapture is
[1:03:26] the link to this manifested sons of God
[1:03:29] a link to the restoration of the earth
[1:03:31] and all creation being restored is this
[1:03:33] manifestation of the sons of God this
[1:03:35] this maturity that comes in his sons
[1:03:37] this positioning I know who I am as a
[1:03:40] son and with that comes power it comes
[1:03:42] character and we when we get to that
[1:03:45] position fully then we know instantly
[1:03:47] the Rapture takes place cuz God's all
[1:03:49] finished but we know we're not there yet
[1:03:51] so what's it do it sets us under expect
[1:03:55] expectation so there were some
[1:03:57] expectations in the Bible to remind you
[1:03:59] of them this morning that uh there was a
[1:04:01] cry for certain things to happen and so
[1:04:04] Malachi 4 5 and 6 Matthew 1711 acts
[1:04:09] 3:21 Revelations 5:7 Revelations 101
[1:04:13] Revelations 10 1-7 there was a cry for
[1:04:17] hundreds of years for these things to
[1:04:18] take place but I'm happy to say this
[1:04:21] morning that all of these scriptures
[1:04:23] have fulfilled or under under still
[1:04:25] being fulfilled but a lot of them have
[1:04:27] already been fulfilled where people can
[1:04:30] take that many scriptures and there's
[1:04:31] more and and I can't I don't have time
[1:04:33] to let you write them all down but all
[1:04:35] these Matthew Malachi 4 Matthew 1711
[1:04:38] acts 3:21 Revelations 57 all of these
[1:04:41] have been fulfilled or being fulfilled
[1:04:44] and we live in that day yes so it's a
[1:04:47] wonderful thing they've been fulfilled
[1:04:48] and then you come to Romans
[1:04:51] 819 that says for the earnest
[1:04:54] expectation of the creature waited for
[1:04:56] the manifestation of the sons of God I
[1:04:58] personally believe that all those
[1:05:00] scriptures I read to you have been
[1:05:02] fulfilled but yet they're to set us up
[1:05:05] for Revel Romans 8:19 to be fulfilled
[1:05:09] all of those scriptures have been
[1:05:11] fulfilled to bring us to the Fulfillment
[1:05:14] of Romans 8:19 and that's the manifested
[1:05:18] sons of God the end result to God
[1:05:21] sending a prophet the end result to God
[1:05:24] go restoring us back to Bible Faith the
[1:05:26] end result to all the Mysteries being
[1:05:28] revealed in the end time the end result
[1:05:29] for God sending the seventh angel to
[1:05:32] reveal the mystery of God should be
[1:05:33] finished the end result all of it is
[1:05:35] manifested sons of God that's the end
[1:05:39] result to the message it's doesn't stop
[1:05:42] at God sending a prophet it's manifest
[1:05:45] so this is yet to be fulfilled this is
[1:05:47] happening now and the Fulfillment of
[1:05:50] this is because he's already fulfilled
[1:05:52] all of those other things amen
[1:05:55] hallelujah this is where we are now you
[1:05:58] know it doesn't say in the Bible that
[1:06:00] all creation
[1:06:01] groans for a prophet to come
[1:06:04] amen doesn't say
[1:06:07] that all creation is waiting and
[1:06:10] groaning for the restoration of all the
[1:06:12] mysteries of God for all the Mysteries
[1:06:14] it doesn't say that all creation is
[1:06:18] waiting and groaning under expectation
[1:06:20] for for a prophet to come from the
[1:06:22] Mysteries to be revealed for a
[1:06:24] restoration message to bring us back to
[1:06:26] no no no no no it's all creation groans
[1:06:29] for the manifestation of the sons it
[1:06:32] doesn't say son singular Jesus Christ
[1:06:35] it's Sons it's plural it's a body it's
[1:06:39] it's a world of Sons and Daughters of
[1:06:41] God this is what creation is under
[1:06:43] expectation for we're looking at you
[1:06:46] this morning we're looking at where your
[1:06:48] life is in Christ where the Holy Ghost
[1:06:50] is taking you every day that's the
[1:06:53] expectation
[1:06:54] CU if those Sons come into their
[1:06:56] position and recognize it in the word of
[1:06:58] God and they come to a place of power
[1:07:00] and character restored back again it all
[1:07:04] of a sudden begins to start the wheels
[1:07:06] turning to this entire Earth being
[1:07:09] restored again it starts with Suns it
[1:07:12] fell because a sun
[1:07:15] fell this Earth was created for sons of
[1:07:20] God to rule and Reign and Adam stood
[1:07:23] there with Eve ruling and reigning over
[1:07:25] this Earth in charge of the elements I
[1:07:29] mean there was no storms back then like
[1:07:31] this but if there had been Adam could
[1:07:33] speak that storm away can you say amen
[1:07:36] he had control he named all the animals
[1:07:38] he had control because the whole Earth
[1:07:40] was created not for God but for his sons
[1:07:43] to rule and Reign through God and so
[1:07:46] they were in control of this earth when
[1:07:48] he fell in sin Eve fell in sin Adam fell
[1:07:51] with her everything got lost all of
[1:07:53] creation fell the whole earth fell and
[1:07:55] sin came into the picture and so now
[1:07:57] because a son got out of his position
[1:07:59] and fell everything fell with it but
[1:08:03] when Sons come back into their place and
[1:08:05] start living like sons of God on this
[1:08:08] Earth everything begins to trickle down
[1:08:10] and be restored with it you watch a man
[1:08:13] put his life in order according to this
[1:08:15] message and according to this word and
[1:08:17] you watch over time God will start
[1:08:19] putting his family
[1:08:21] together God will start restoring a
[1:08:23] marriage
[1:08:24] you start with a son getting his
[1:08:26] position in humility and he starts to
[1:08:28] see his place and his sins have been
[1:08:31] forgiven his past has been forgiven he
[1:08:33] no longer views himself for his past
[1:08:35] this is who I am in Christ and I'm
[1:08:37] staying here upon the word of God you
[1:08:39] watch that be a trickle down effect to
[1:08:41] the rest of the church to the rest of
[1:08:43] the families it may take a while for
[1:08:45] some kids to come back to the Lord but
[1:08:47] they're coming back can I get an amen
[1:08:50] this morning it may take a while you
[1:08:52] just hold your position
[1:08:54] you keep praying can you say Amen
[1:08:56] because everything I see in the word is
[1:08:58] when we find our position that
[1:08:59] everything that's precious to us all of
[1:09:01] our children that's precious to us God's
[1:09:04] promised us our
[1:09:06] children don't doubt that it's a promise
[1:09:09] in the word of God but it fell because a
[1:09:12] sun fell and so it'll come back again
[1:09:14] because a son gets his position again
[1:09:17] all creation is under Earnest
[1:09:20] expectation for Sons man manifested sons
[1:09:24] of God I love it I love it
[1:09:27] amen so the word being fulfilled sets us
[1:09:30] under expectation for what's next or
[1:09:32] what's coming or what's to be finished
[1:09:34] in this if you've looked close at the
[1:09:36] word you will see seasons change
[1:09:39] sometimes under the same message we
[1:09:41] won't spend a lot of time on this I'll
[1:09:43] skip through this but if you watch the
[1:09:45] Bible pattern when God sends a message
[1:09:48] he initiates it and brings the initial
[1:09:50] part of it but then there's a it begins
[1:09:52] to change and see reasons within that
[1:09:54] message to bring it to the full
[1:09:56] manifestation of why he sent it um we
[1:09:59] could refer to the former and latter
[1:10:01] Reign being under the same move move of
[1:10:03] God at the last days we could refer to
[1:10:05] the change from Elijah to Elisha you
[1:10:08] could you could talk a lot about that
[1:10:10] change from Elijah to Elisha he had a
[1:10:13] double portion of the Spirit come on him
[1:10:15] Elijah had to go off the scene but there
[1:10:17] was a change that
[1:10:19] Administration and uh so we could speak
[1:10:22] of going from the change from Moses a
[1:10:25] prophet to Joshua that was a change
[1:10:28] under the same message the Moses
[1:10:30] commission was to bring the people out
[1:10:32] of Egypt the Joshua commission was to
[1:10:35] take the people into their Promised Land
[1:10:36] you see it's all under the same message
[1:10:39] but it's a different commission it's a
[1:10:41] Joshua commission and so uh once Moses
[1:10:45] brought them out then the expectation
[1:10:48] changed and many of the people children
[1:10:50] of Israel were so immature and upset uh
[1:10:52] they they wanted to either stay in the
[1:10:54] wilderness or they wanted to go back to
[1:10:56] Egypt why because they didn't have the
[1:10:58] vision where the message was taken them
[1:11:00] amen right they didn't have a vision of
[1:11:03] where this message was taken them it and
[1:11:05] it wasn't to stay under Moses it wasn't
[1:11:07] to sit around for 40 years and watch
[1:11:09] signs of Moses give us another sign Lord
[1:11:12] help us God we need we're out of this
[1:11:14] we're out of that even when they were
[1:11:15] crossed over the Red Sea they were still
[1:11:18] complaining I've been thinking about it
[1:11:19] lately how in speaking about maturity
[1:11:22] coming more in our Liv lives instead of
[1:11:24] childishness for 40 years the children
[1:11:26] of Israel will immature little kids
[1:11:28] depending on Miracles and signs to keep
[1:11:30] them
[1:11:30] going I believe in miracles and signs
[1:11:33] sister Sharon my sister Sharon had stage
[1:11:35] four cancer this year and God has
[1:11:38] completely she had two tumors on her
[1:11:39] body they're completely gone she's
[1:11:41] completely cancer free by the glory of
[1:11:44] God he still heals he still raises the
[1:11:46] dead amen can you say amen and our
[1:11:49] children and unbelievers need to see the
[1:11:51] power of God that way but for me I don't
[1:11:53] need to see another miracle to make me
[1:11:55] stay that's right God if God never did
[1:11:57] another miracle I'm here to stay I'm
[1:11:59] going to the Rapture but God's still
[1:12:01] doing those things but immaturity learns
[1:12:04] to depend on that do this or I'm going
[1:12:07] back to Egypt Lord do this answer my
[1:12:09] prayer just this way I'm going to that's
[1:12:11] immaturity and on this side of the Red
[1:12:14] Sea the Pharaoh's Army was coming the
[1:12:16] Red Sea was in front of them they all
[1:12:18] begin to complain oh what are we going
[1:12:20] to do what are we going to do and even
[1:12:21] Moses is a little scared and God has to
[1:12:24] come down and correct his own prophet
[1:12:26] and to say why are you
[1:12:29] crying immaturity immaturity why cry
[1:12:33] speak and go forward I gave you a
[1:12:35] commission speak and go forward well
[1:12:38] somebody stepped up in faith in Moses
[1:12:39] and he says listen let the O Red Sea
[1:12:41] just open up and we'll cross over on dry
[1:12:43] ground and God did
[1:12:45] it the interesting thing to me is they
[1:12:48] walked over on dry ground in a
[1:12:49] supernatural
[1:12:50] Miracle then they get on the other side
[1:12:53] and Pharaoh's Army was dumped all with
[1:12:56] the water he swallowed the whole
[1:12:57] Pharaoh's Army the waters begin to and
[1:12:59] and their enemies destroyed right in
[1:13:01] front of their eyes and that's why
[1:13:02] Miriam got happy and grabbed the
[1:13:04] tambourine I don't know if there's a
[1:13:05] tambourine here but that's when shouting
[1:13:07] took place that's when all they begin to
[1:13:09] rejoice as they seen the enemy and guess
[1:13:11] what and a lot of preaching today really
[1:13:14] does a lot of themes about Miriam
[1:13:16] grabbing the tambourine and they work it
[1:13:18] up I love messages like that I don't
[1:13:21] hear too many messages though um the
[1:13:23] immaturity of the Saints before they Red
[1:13:26] Sea and then 3 days later after they
[1:13:28] shouted with the tambourine they're
[1:13:30] already complaining that they don't have
[1:13:34] something don't hear Too Many sermons on
[1:13:36] that right but oh we hear them about the
[1:13:38] tambourine and shouting and
[1:13:41] dancing what is it we have to preach the
[1:13:44] manifestation of the sons of God this
[1:13:47] message is not taking us just to another
[1:13:49] shouting time it is to take us to mature
[1:13:53] pure manifested Sons and Daughters of
[1:13:57] God is that okay the pastor Pastor can
[1:14:00] correct me if I need anything corrected
[1:14:03] but this has been on my heart to see
[1:14:05] what's the expectation for what's the
[1:14:08] right expectations where are we going
[1:14:10] with this thing not back to another
[1:14:12] Pentecostal Revival not backwards but
[1:14:15] forward amen amen so it changed under Jo
[1:14:19] Moses and Joshua it changed it there's
[1:14:21] so many more examples that change of
[1:14:23] leadership from Saul to David it's in
[1:14:25] the Bible as a type the leadership
[1:14:28] because remember the children of Israel
[1:14:29] they chose Saul as the leadership they
[1:14:30] chose the wrong leadership but I want
[1:14:32] you to know Saul and David were were
[1:14:34] anointed by the same
[1:14:36] Prophet Saul and David were under the
[1:14:39] same message anointed by the same
[1:14:41] Prophet it was just the wrong type of
[1:14:44] leadership and the people chose the
[1:14:46] wrong lead and God said okay go ahead
[1:14:49] I've got somebody in mine I've got
[1:14:50] something somebody in my heart already I
[1:14:52] know you need a king but I've got a king
[1:14:54] after my own choosing I've got a pastor
[1:14:56] I got a leader after my own
[1:14:58] choosing to lead your
[1:15:01] lives people wanted their own they chose
[1:15:03] their own leadership a lot of years in
[1:15:05] the message is because people choose the
[1:15:07] wrong the wrong leadership to lead them
[1:15:10] and leads them the wrong way and so that
[1:15:12] translation was under the same message
[1:15:14] from Saul to David all under the same
[1:15:17] Prophet anointed by the same anointing
[1:15:20] anointed by the same prophet Samuel they
[1:15:22] chose the wrong leader and God gave them
[1:15:24] right one to lead them praise the
[1:15:27] Lord right in the middle of the
[1:15:29] prophet's message Paul's message right
[1:15:32] in the middle of him bringing the word
[1:15:33] for his age he says therefore leaving
[1:15:36] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[1:15:38] let us go on to
[1:15:40] Perfection so he's he's prophesying he's
[1:15:44] saying you don't get stuck in just what
[1:15:46] I'm bringing in this message you under
[1:15:48] expectations let's leave the principles
[1:15:50] which leaving does not it means to it's
[1:15:53] getting past the elementary stages of
[1:15:55] the Gospel
[1:15:57] amen leaving the doctrine of Christ it
[1:16:01] doesn't mean to get rid of it it just
[1:16:02] means we move deeper than just the
[1:16:05] elementary stages of the Gospel
[1:16:08] Perfection does not mean intellectual
[1:16:11] quote knowing all the quotes that's not
[1:16:13] what Perfection means it means your life
[1:16:15] is showing maturity and positioning of
[1:16:17] real sons and daughters of God it's
[1:16:19] Christ in you it's what Christ looks
[1:16:21] like in you what will Christ look like
[1:16:24] in your life not brother bram's not
[1:16:27] brother John's not Brother Bruce but
[1:16:28] what will what is he starting to look
[1:16:30] like in your
[1:16:32] life leaving the principles of the
[1:16:34] doctrine of Christ and and and laying on
[1:16:37] of hands and emphasizing all those
[1:16:39] things let's go on to Perfection and
[1:16:42] once again Perfection is an intellectual
[1:16:44] stimulation sometimes intellectual that
[1:16:46] we know all the quotes of the Prophet no
[1:16:48] it's maturity and positioning there was
[1:16:51] a transition from John John the Baptist
[1:16:53] to Jesus he said you were willing for a
[1:16:56] season to rejoice in the light of John
[1:16:58] the Baptist but now when the May Messiah
[1:17:01] Came John said I must decrease he must
[1:17:04] increase it's a transition under the
[1:17:06] same
[1:17:07] messag and brother bandam said it this
[1:17:10] way in 1965 what is the attraction on
[1:17:12] the
[1:17:12] mountain behold I send my messenger
[1:17:15] before my face to prepare the way don't
[1:17:17] you know this fulfills prophecy prophecy
[1:17:19] was being fulfilled and about the time
[1:17:21] the prophet turned and said John the
[1:17:23] Baptist behold there comes the Lamb of
[1:17:26] God that takes away the sin of the world
[1:17:28] now what's the attraction he's actually
[1:17:30] saying the attraction changes it's not
[1:17:33] to John their baptized it's not to
[1:17:35] Elijah's Spirit he said now what's the
[1:17:37] attraction it changed from the prophet
[1:17:41] to his
[1:17:42] prophecy now we might as well be at home
[1:17:45] here today we got a lot of emphasis in
[1:17:47] our ranks that's still emphasizing the
[1:17:50] prophet I mean we read the truth but
[1:17:52] it's it's idolizing the prophet it's
[1:17:54] taking even the young people back to
[1:17:56] those days and idolizing if I can get a
[1:17:59] Bel Buckle like him and it's idolizing
[1:18:01] because people are reaching back to a
[1:18:03] comfort blanket we knew God worked
[1:18:05] through him so they reached back to that
[1:18:06] but they're not under expectation of
[1:18:08] what's coming where this message is
[1:18:10] taking us so that in their comfort
[1:18:13] blanket they reach back to idolizing a
[1:18:15] man almost deifying a man in fact they
[1:18:18] do they deify him what a shame brother
[1:18:20] Brandon would have never been for that
[1:18:23] he never would have never stood for that
[1:18:25] and yet when he's dead and gone then
[1:18:27] they make an idol out of him and it's
[1:18:29] because many times people are not
[1:18:31] changing from the emphasis and
[1:18:32] attraction to a prophet to the
[1:18:34] attraction of the prophecy and the
[1:18:36] prophecy is what's supposed to happen in
[1:18:40] you prophecy is what's happening in you
[1:18:43] amen does me no good it's dead to go
[1:18:46] back and just spend my days reading all
[1:18:48] the stories of what happened in God's
[1:18:49] life and the prophet I like to hear it
[1:18:52] it builds Faith sometimes but when I
[1:18:55] read this message when I was 16 years
[1:18:56] old I got filled with the spirit of God
[1:18:58] and with that for the Youth that's here
[1:19:01] with that change in my heart God changed
[1:19:03] my heart with that came such a
[1:19:06] incredible hunger for the word of God I
[1:19:08] watch these boys here with their notes
[1:19:10] and taking scriptures and stuff God
[1:19:11] bless you young men because may God put
[1:19:14] a deeper hunger in you for more of the
[1:19:16] word of God this world will fall apart
[1:19:18] friends will fall apart but what you're
[1:19:19] holding there in the word and listening
[1:19:21] today will hold your life together
[1:19:22] Forever and For Eternity but when I was
[1:19:25] 16 I was changed and one of the things
[1:19:26] that came with that change of the holy
[1:19:28] ghost in my heart is that incredible
[1:19:30] craving and hunger for the word of God I
[1:19:32] couldn't get enough of it and I said If
[1:19:34] God Was gracious enough to send me a
[1:19:37] prophet in my own language in my own
[1:19:39] tongue in my own generation in the 1960s
[1:19:42] I ought if God took the time and he sent
[1:19:45] the prophet I ought to take the time to
[1:19:46] hear what he
[1:19:48] said so they didn't have apps back then
[1:19:50] but they got them now it's the main app
[1:19:52] on my phone I'm listening to and
[1:19:54] following what God Said to direct us
[1:19:56] back to Bible faith in this day and he
[1:19:58] sent a prophet to do that and so but
[1:20:00] when I fed on it I didn't just see what
[1:20:03] God did in William
[1:20:05] brandham my faith Rose to now what can
[1:20:08] God do in
[1:20:09] me what can God do in my life the same
[1:20:12] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:20:14] forever only believe all things are
[1:20:16] possible in my life what can he do in
[1:20:19] your life how could God become real to
[1:20:22] you because it's not about the prophet
[1:20:24] anymore it's about what he can do in
[1:20:25] your life John said I must decrease now
[1:20:28] he must increase Jesus said or excuse me
[1:20:31] John the Baptist says I will baptize you
[1:20:34] with repentance but when he comes it'll
[1:20:36] go deeper I'll baptize you with the Holy
[1:20:38] Ghost in fire right that's deeper that's
[1:20:41] right he's setting them under
[1:20:43] expectation of what's next all these
[1:20:45] transitions under the same message the
[1:20:48] season changed under the same message
[1:20:51] you know you have to be in the right
[1:20:53] season with god of what he's doing in
[1:20:55] the season if you're out of
[1:20:58] season then uh you're going to miss what
[1:21:00] God's doing in this season if you're
[1:21:02] reaching to the past and trying to
[1:21:04] recreate that you can't go back to a
[1:21:06] Pentecostal age and try to recreate that
[1:21:08] you can't go back to Luther's age and
[1:21:10] just preach that you can't go back to
[1:21:13] Wesleyan age and the open door age and
[1:21:15] it's all about just one thing and
[1:21:16] Outreach you can't reach back and use
[1:21:18] that because there's more of a full
[1:21:20] message now there's
[1:21:23] you you can't try to reach back and say
[1:21:25] if we could recreate that it would work
[1:21:27] today no we take all of that plus the
[1:21:29] restoration of the word but then we're
[1:21:31] looking Where's God want to take the
[1:21:32] people today something deeper than just
[1:21:35] dedication something deeper than just
[1:21:37] praying fasting something deeper than
[1:21:40] just looking to the the the restoration
[1:21:42] of the gifts something deeper than
[1:21:45] that God wants to take us deeper can you
[1:21:47] say amen amen so um I I I think of
[1:21:52] seasons and I think of um I was thinking
[1:21:55] how cold it was this morning being out
[1:21:56] there and I remembered um we used to
[1:21:59] have a swimming pool where we lived for
[1:22:01] many years and the kids grew up in that
[1:22:02] house and they had a swimming pool and
[1:22:04] we enjoyed it in the summer they enjoyed
[1:22:05] it it was nice it was a finc in pool so
[1:22:08] it was private and they did a lot of
[1:22:09] swimming they learned how to swim and so
[1:22:11] I remember one day and my wife will
[1:22:13] remember this it was the Dead Winter
[1:22:15] freezing the the pool was covered in
[1:22:17] snow and so I got in the living room and
[1:22:19] it was warm in the house and I just say
[1:22:21] hey you guys you want to go swimming and
[1:22:23] they're just you know they're just four
[1:22:25] and five years old I said you want to go
[1:22:28] swimming and they didn't think of what
[1:22:30] season it was and so I said you guys
[1:22:33] want to go swimming and they go yeah
[1:22:34] let's go swimming let's do it and I got
[1:22:37] him more excited got them pumped up
[1:22:38] let's go swimming let's go swimming go
[1:22:40] get your suits on he went in the they
[1:22:41] went in the uh in the in their bedrooms
[1:22:43] they got all their suits on so I was
[1:22:44] waiting at the door by the pool and so
[1:22:46] they come running swimming swimming swim
[1:22:48] I open the door and let them run out
[1:22:50] there by the pool full of snow in the
[1:22:52] swimsuits and I slam the door and I lock
[1:22:57] it this is fun I just enjoyed it I
[1:23:00] didn't I didn't don't call Child
[1:23:02] Services I didn't leave them out there
[1:23:04] that long but I do have pictures of
[1:23:07] Solomon oriah standing out there going
[1:23:10] please let us in please and they didn't
[1:23:13] realize what season theyd forgot it was
[1:23:15] winter and it always reminds me of
[1:23:17] people doing things in a certain season
[1:23:20] but it's not the season for it
[1:23:23] please don't be offended that I did that
[1:23:25] to my kids it was fun at the time but I
[1:23:28] probably shouldn't have done it they're
[1:23:30] still living they survived
[1:23:33] okay but uh people are trying to push
[1:23:37] for things it would be being in the hot
[1:23:39] summer of which is hard to imagine today
[1:23:42] but you know 95 100 degrees and sitting
[1:23:45] around a a hot fire with a bonfire and
[1:23:48] drinking hot
[1:23:49] chocolate doesn't fit the season does it
[1:23:52] right but you put a nice in the today if
[1:23:55] we did a bonfire had a nice fire in our
[1:23:56] house get a little hot chocolate get
[1:23:58] around it oh that's perfect for the
[1:23:59] season you see and so spiritually people
[1:24:04] can do things out of season and not
[1:24:07] realize they're doing it push for
[1:24:09] certain things it's not the season for
[1:24:12] that and spiritually you see that happen
[1:24:14] sometimes even our own ranks where
[1:24:16] there's a push for something but it sets
[1:24:19] the people under false expectations amen
[1:24:23] that's right now we preachers we preach
[1:24:25] people under expectations that's part of
[1:24:27] our Ministries and callings but it's
[1:24:30] become ever so important to me the last
[1:24:32] few years especially that I make sure
[1:24:34] I'm in tune with what God and where he's
[1:24:37] taking the people right now because I am
[1:24:40] my gift I I'm gifted God's given me a
[1:24:42] gift but I I can preach the people under
[1:24:45] any expectations that I want that's true
[1:24:48] if I preach a certain thing emphasize a
[1:24:49] certain thing the people will come along
[1:24:51] with that and you you'll see it happen
[1:24:53] you'll see it manifested but is it the
[1:24:54] right season for it is it the emphasis
[1:24:57] you see so preachers can preach the
[1:25:00] people under false expectations and
[1:25:02] that's a tragedy because we don't want
[1:25:04] to be in this hour under false
[1:25:05] expectations we want to know what the
[1:25:07] expectations are for this hour and we
[1:25:09] want to be standing there saying I'm
[1:25:10] under expectation for this to happen in
[1:25:12] my life you see people can be misled and
[1:25:15] expecting the wrong thing and it's a
[1:25:17] crucial time when we sit in the middle
[1:25:19] of the prophecy being fulfilled of a
[1:25:21] prophet that Satan can mislead people on
[1:25:24] what's coming
[1:25:26] next I think of the end of the sermons
[1:25:30] on the the sermons on the seven seal the
[1:25:32] sermon of the Seven Seals and I don't
[1:25:34] know if you ever noticed it but in two
[1:25:36] or three places the last messages
[1:25:39] questions and answers on the seals and I
[1:25:41] believe even in the seventh seal I don't
[1:25:43] know if you caught it but after this
[1:25:44] glorious revealing of God's word and the
[1:25:47] seals taken off the book of redemption
[1:25:49] after all that powerful thing happens at
[1:25:51] the end of the the week he starts to say
[1:25:54] things like this know if you remember it
[1:25:57] if you haven't go read it which are just
[1:25:59] as important instruction as the entire
[1:26:02] seals that's right he said now don't try
[1:26:06] to interpret anything that's
[1:26:09] right don't try to interpret I wish more
[1:26:11] preachers would have listened to that
[1:26:13] because what we had is a lot of people
[1:26:14] trying to take okay what's next who's
[1:26:16] the next messenger who's the next age
[1:26:18] and they try to interpret it and they
[1:26:19] mess it up and mislead people and he's
[1:26:22] saying don't try to interpret anything
[1:26:25] God has done something here leave it
[1:26:27] alone just go to your church read your
[1:26:30] Bible be a good Christian and if God
[1:26:32] wants you to know anything he'll let you
[1:26:36] know that's the way under the to be
[1:26:39] under the right expectations something's
[1:26:41] happening I tell you friends something
[1:26:43] happened definitely a transition in 1963
[1:26:45] when the seals were open definitely a
[1:26:47] huge transition for the bride of Christ
[1:26:49] and you see it in your Bible our lamb
[1:26:51] went to Cal 2,000 years he's the high
[1:26:54] priest we can be touched by the feeling
[1:26:56] of our infirmities and then John at the
[1:26:58] end of the age he has this vision and in
[1:27:01] the vision I was going to preach on this
[1:27:02] this morning I didn't have time but in
[1:27:04] the vision at the end time what's the
[1:27:06] emphasis it becomes about a book that's
[1:27:08] sealed with Seven Seals okay the
[1:27:11] emphasis in the vision becomes a book
[1:27:13] and the book no one was worthy to look
[1:27:15] at it was our title deed it was our book
[1:27:18] of identity it's who we are in Christ
[1:27:20] amen but it was sealed with Seven Seals
[1:27:22] no one's found worthy so in the vision
[1:27:24] for the end time the emphasis is about
[1:27:26] the book of redemption so the same lamb
[1:27:29] that went up to Calvary and died for our
[1:27:31] sins where's he gone for 2,000 where
[1:27:33] he's the son of man in the midst of
[1:27:35] Candlestick he's there but now in this
[1:27:37] Vision the lamb our lamb that went to
[1:27:39] Calvary steps forth a bloody lamb and
[1:27:42] steps into this Vision because he's the
[1:27:44] only one worthy to take this book right
[1:27:47] so it's about the book and it's about
[1:27:49] Christ taking the book and when he does
[1:27:51] the worship changed the worship was
[1:27:53] incredible they come unglued because our
[1:27:57] our kinsman redeemer he's got this book
[1:28:00] in his hands it went back to the
[1:28:01] original owner now it's in the hands of
[1:28:03] our Kinsmen and he's going to tear the
[1:28:05] seals off of it and the Book of our
[1:28:07] identity is going to be revealed to us
[1:28:09] sons are going to see who they are in
[1:28:12] Christ Christ is the book and the bride
[1:28:15] is the words in the book that's a direct
[1:28:17] quote from Brother Bram Christ is the
[1:28:18] book and the bride is the words in the
[1:28:20] book so when he starts breing that which
[1:28:22] he's been doing since I believe since
[1:28:24] 1963 when he does that Sons come into
[1:28:27] manifestation CU they start to see who
[1:28:29] they are daughters start to see who they
[1:28:31] are they quit dressing like the world
[1:28:33] they quit acting like the world not
[1:28:35] because some Holiness religion told them
[1:28:37] to do it it's because they see I'm not
[1:28:39] that I'm
[1:28:41] this this is my this is my biography
[1:28:44] this is my true biography my if you had
[1:28:46] a biography already written of your life
[1:28:48] and you found out about it it's your
[1:28:50] whole life and it's your biography I I'd
[1:28:52] say you'd be curious to go buy
[1:28:54] it somebody wrote a biography of my life
[1:28:56] already and it's got all it's got the
[1:28:58] past it's got the present it's got the
[1:28:59] future I'm going to go buy that book
[1:29:01] because I'm curious about it spiritually
[1:29:03] there's already a biography been written
[1:29:05] about your life your spiritual life is
[1:29:07] in this book of redemption and as the
[1:29:09] bride begins to feed on it she starts to
[1:29:13] know and rises in power and character to
[1:29:16] realize wow praise be to God I'm not
[1:29:20] that I'm this this is who I am I can't
[1:29:23] dress like that because this is who I am
[1:29:26] you know the message brought back the
[1:29:28] integrity and the blessedness of a true
[1:29:30] woman of God and somebody told people
[1:29:33] that the message came as a woman hater
[1:29:36] Prophet to put the PE the women under
[1:29:39] bondage what a lie what a lie no it's
[1:29:43] come to restore the true Dignity of what
[1:29:46] a woman of God
[1:29:49] is how the devil took and twisted that
[1:29:51] thing I was talking to fellowship with
[1:29:53] Brother John last night at the
[1:29:54] restaurant he graciously gave me time to
[1:29:56] have a coffee with him and I was picking
[1:29:58] his brain a little bit there on some
[1:29:59] stuff and uh I was talking about my
[1:30:03] Christmas message was how that the um
[1:30:07] the scandle and the you know the time
[1:30:10] for the birth of Christ and all of a
[1:30:12] sudden now but what went out from that
[1:30:14] was Mary got
[1:30:16] pregnant Mary got pregnant out of
[1:30:18] wedlock and so now all that's the word
[1:30:21] that gets around and and that's that's
[1:30:24] not good because when you got Pharisees
[1:30:26] Sadducees the Jews one of the worst
[1:30:27] things that could happen is a girl get
[1:30:29] pregnant um and they're not even married
[1:30:32] yet her and Joseph so the the shame
[1:30:33] comes on Joseph the shame comes on Mary
[1:30:36] comes on her parents we we watch uh
[1:30:38] something called The Nativity Story it's
[1:30:40] a tradition at Christmas we watch that
[1:30:42] together I love that the way they
[1:30:43] presented the birth of Christ and Mary
[1:30:45] and it's so funny in that certain
[1:30:47] section of that movie where uh excuse me
[1:30:50] if I'm not supposed to be Pro promoting
[1:30:51] movies I I don't promote movies but good
[1:30:54] ones I promote and uh I love the section
[1:30:57] where Mary has to tell her parents and
[1:30:59] Joseph in front of him that she's
[1:31:01] pregnant and you would not believe you
[1:31:03] know her dad's going hysterical he just
[1:31:06] he don't know what to do you know uh and
[1:31:09] and uh she says something like but
[1:31:11] Elizabeth is is pregnant you know
[1:31:13] Elizabeth and her dad goes but Elizabeth
[1:31:15] has a husband you don't have a husband
[1:31:17] yet and so the the the n and so the
[1:31:20] Bible says they're all in distressed and
[1:31:22] while they they're thinking on how to
[1:31:24] fix this and Joseph's minded to put her
[1:31:27] away privately and they're trying to how
[1:31:28] do I because it's the word that's going
[1:31:30] to go out it's going to be it's going to
[1:31:31] be real embarrassing to everybody and
[1:31:34] God allows his own birth of the
[1:31:36] revealing of himself the greatest thing
[1:31:39] that hit planet Earth is going to be
[1:31:41] under a thing that's looked at from the
[1:31:43] world that way I don't understand why
[1:31:45] God does it but he did it in the birth
[1:31:47] of
[1:31:48] Christ and so while he thought on these
[1:31:51] things trying to fix it the angel
[1:31:53] appears to him in a dream and once the
[1:31:55] angel came to him say he said listen
[1:31:58] don't you be nervous what's happening is
[1:32:00] the word being
[1:32:02] fulfilled and so I was preaching on
[1:32:04] finding God in our
[1:32:07] circumstances finding God in our
[1:32:10] circumstances when the angel of the Lord
[1:32:12] comes to you he'll say don't be nervous
[1:32:15] find God being born in your
[1:32:18] circumstances because in all your
[1:32:20] circumstances for a son of God there's
[1:32:22] always something God's wanting to do in
[1:32:24] that but you have to not get blinded by
[1:32:26] the circumstances in your life you have
[1:32:28] to say Lord let me be mature let me find
[1:32:31] God in this God's doing something God's
[1:32:33] doing something with your children God's
[1:32:35] doing something this you don't know what
[1:32:37] God is doing but you you don't want to
[1:32:39] be blinded by the circumstance and the
[1:32:41] embarrassment of it it's embarrassing it
[1:32:44] was embarrassing for Joseph and and and
[1:32:47] embarrassing for Mary's parents it was
[1:32:49] the whole thing was but it's amazing to
[1:32:51] me and then I as we were fellowshipping
[1:32:53] last night look at all the reproach that
[1:32:55] goes with the message of the last days
[1:32:58] look at the package God brought this in
[1:33:01] until to today it's not accepted by
[1:33:03] scientists or the intellectual mind or
[1:33:05] denominations and never man with a
[1:33:07] seventh grade education and he begins
[1:33:09] the message that way and and even till
[1:33:11] today we're getting reported on I had a
[1:33:13] reporter at my church just a few weeks
[1:33:15] ago and she's examining all the message
[1:33:17] groups and everything there's such
[1:33:18] negative sometimes that goes around it I
[1:33:20] have to live with some of that approach
[1:33:22] but hopefully I share some positive
[1:33:24] things of what this message really is I
[1:33:26] don't know if she'll write about it most
[1:33:27] of the time they don't but I tried
[1:33:29] anyway but listen till this day we're
[1:33:31] bearing a reproach but you know what
[1:33:33] Joseph did he said you know what now
[1:33:35] that I've met the angel now that I've
[1:33:36] got a dream I know this is God's word
[1:33:38] being fulfilled I'm committed to I'm
[1:33:41] going to marry this girl and I'm going
[1:33:42] to carry this word all the way
[1:33:45] through I don't care how much
[1:33:47] persecution comes I'm going to carry
[1:33:49] this word in my heart this message is
[1:33:51] got something to it this message is the
[1:33:53] greatest revealing of Christ that's ever
[1:33:56] hit planet
[1:34:00] Earth this is not some just little thing
[1:34:04] this is the Visions bigger than anything
[1:34:06] man could do it's not William Brown's
[1:34:09] message that's right this is bigger than
[1:34:12] you or I this is this is
[1:34:15] big this is big
[1:34:19] hallelujah oh I'm having a good time
[1:34:21] this morning thank you for making me
[1:34:22] feel comfortable praise the Lord I love
[1:34:25] the word of God I love to just talk
[1:34:26] about it and fellowship around it and is
[1:34:29] so rich you know we're spiritual
[1:34:31] billionaires yes we are I don't know how
[1:34:34] much money you got today we and my me
[1:34:36] and my wife we don't have a lot but it
[1:34:38] doesn't matter we're spiritual knowing
[1:34:41] these things we're spiritual
[1:34:42] billionaires you're rich people in
[1:34:44] Christ can you say
[1:34:45] Amen so let me just move on
[1:34:49] here oh my
[1:34:54] so brother briam says in what is this
[1:34:56] Hol what is the Holy Ghost
[1:34:59] 1959 Luther walked in one light Wesley
[1:35:04] walked in another Wesley walked in one
[1:35:07] light Pentecost walked in another but
[1:35:09] we're walking on higher than the
[1:35:11] Pentecostal light today look he's not
[1:35:13] done and if there's another generation
[1:35:16] it will go beyond
[1:35:19] us so he's he's prophesying and putting
[1:35:23] us under expectation that we haven't
[1:35:26] arrived just because we come to the
[1:35:28] message of the last days or Beyond
[1:35:30] Pentecost we haven't arrived yet if
[1:35:32] there's another generation which I'm
[1:35:33] preaching to someone some of them here
[1:35:35] this
[1:35:36] morning it will go beyond
[1:35:39] us because see this is something this
[1:35:42] isn't something that just ends when God
[1:35:44] sent a Prophet this is something he's
[1:35:46] doing in sons and daughters and it's not
[1:35:48] going to end until we're in a Rapture
[1:35:50] till we're in the coming of of the Lord
[1:35:52] and so I love reading that because I
[1:35:54] know when I'm gone someday and I kick
[1:35:56] the bucket God's not gone people say
[1:35:59] that you know it's like the some big
[1:36:00] preacher and healing evangelist and boy
[1:36:02] if we could just just get him to come
[1:36:04] and lay hands on the sick and and one
[1:36:06] preacher said I don't know what we're
[1:36:08] going to do I don't know what the
[1:36:09] bride's going to do when this man goes
[1:36:11] off the scene if God takes him I don't
[1:36:12] know and I just say what what the
[1:36:15] bride's going to be
[1:36:17] fine the bride was fine before this
[1:36:20] healing evangelist came praise God that
[1:36:22] he can lay hands on and get results
[1:36:24] praise God but when he's gone and when I
[1:36:26] kick the bucket and when brother John's
[1:36:28] gone God is going to take the new
[1:36:31] generation onto the coming of the Lord
[1:36:35] there's going to be young hearts get a
[1:36:36] hold of this message on fire for God and
[1:36:39] take it on and make it even better I had
[1:36:41] one Pastor say I'm training my young men
[1:36:44] so they can take the Sheep further than
[1:36:46] what I've even taken them you don't hear
[1:36:48] a lot of old men say that but this was
[1:36:49] an old brother I said that's my vision
[1:36:51] too is that we don't know when this is
[1:36:52] going to end so we train these young men
[1:36:55] that can take the bride even further
[1:36:56] than when we've taken them I only have a
[1:36:59] certain season here to give my all but
[1:37:01] it'll be over sometime and God God will
[1:37:04] raise up another generation and they'll
[1:37:06] go beyond us so we don't want to go
[1:37:08] backwards we want to go
[1:37:11] forward how many raise your hands I want
[1:37:13] to go forward I don't want to go I want
[1:37:15] to well I'm going to be under
[1:37:16] expectations for what God has for my
[1:37:18] life I want to have joy and hope you may
[1:37:20] feel like you're you're older and you're
[1:37:22] like oh my your life's all about
[1:37:24] finished no don't think that way he
[1:37:26] might still have something to do in your
[1:37:28] life it's expectations of what God will
[1:37:32] do you know I was talking last night to
[1:37:34] Brother John about my friend and his
[1:37:36] friend brother Bill Sanchez just we were
[1:37:38] just getting ready to take him to
[1:37:39] Honduras I wanted him to see his old
[1:37:41] friends wanted to preach with him again
[1:37:42] he's my interpreter and all these years
[1:37:44] when I go to Honduras and for Brother
[1:37:46] John as well and he's got throat cancer
[1:37:49] and we've been praying and you've been
[1:37:50] praying and and he can't go on the trip
[1:37:53] but I wish he could go because he was
[1:37:55] such a good companion and every time we
[1:37:58] would run into trouble on the mission
[1:37:59] field and run into bad food or uh
[1:38:04] roaches in the motel all the things that
[1:38:06] I enjoy so much about missionary work I
[1:38:10] am not a missionary and I can tell you
[1:38:12] clearly I'm not I don't like any of it I
[1:38:15] I go and stay I have to see the golden
[1:38:18] arches within the distance of my motel
[1:38:21] that's the kind of missionary I am I
[1:38:23] don't go that often but sometimes
[1:38:24] brother Bill and I've went out because
[1:38:26] the brothers have asked to come out and
[1:38:27] every time I do it you know I used to
[1:38:29] get sick or something like that but you
[1:38:31] know he's he's amazing because he's
[1:38:32] always going hey brother and I can be
[1:38:36] sick or we can run into trouble you know
[1:38:39] it can be so hot and all these other
[1:38:40] things going on the food and and he says
[1:38:43] we go forward brother Paul we go forward
[1:38:46] and we have the D the darkest times and
[1:38:48] he's like brother Paul we go forward and
[1:38:50] it's it's a good thing we had that cuz I
[1:38:52] don't I don't want to go forward I want
[1:38:53] to get on the plane and go
[1:38:55] home but he's encouraging brother Paul
[1:38:58] glor we go forward brother we go
[1:39:00] forward and he's always doing that and
[1:39:03] and he did it one time when we come into
[1:39:05] a very poor uh place in Nicaragua very
[1:39:08] poor place and I asked them to try to
[1:39:10] get the best Motel they could uh to stay
[1:39:13] there if they could and so they say we
[1:39:15] got the best one we walk in we're in the
[1:39:16] lobby brother Bill and I'm there getting
[1:39:18] my room up there and I said brother Bill

[1:40:24] go forward brother we go forward in the
[1:40:28] name of the
[1:40:30] Lord didn't feel too good that day but
[1:40:32] I'll tell you I like the saying I like
[1:40:34] to stand by it I'm still standing by it
[1:40:36] no matter what happens in this message
[1:40:38] no matter what happens in your life no
[1:40:40] matter what circumstances may you may
[1:40:42] hit tomorrow we're going forward in the
[1:40:44] name of the Lord we're going forward
[1:40:46] we're under expectations of what God can
[1:40:49] do the song Brother Bruce sang had a
[1:40:52] lyric in it said here we have our
[1:40:55] disappointments right here we have our
[1:40:58] disappointments but God has a bigger
[1:41:02] vision for our lives we can't get
[1:41:04] snagged by the disappointments he can't
[1:41:07] get snagged by people who leave people
[1:41:10] people will come and go they're unstable
[1:41:11] it's an instable age unless they anchor
[1:41:14] themselves to this word they'll be gone
[1:41:16] in no time there's an instability
[1:41:18] there's a mental instability there's a
[1:41:20] emtional instability unless they get
[1:41:22] anchor to this word you'll stay
[1:41:24] emotionally in unstable there's only
[1:41:27] stability in the word of God and people
[1:41:29] will come and go I mean when we got this
[1:41:31] new building I'll share with you we got
[1:41:33] this new building and we went up in
[1:41:34] numbers and all these other things now
[1:41:36] some of those families they've left they
[1:41:38] gone and it makes you wonder what did
[1:41:39] they come for what were they coming for
[1:41:42] the music or some other thing were the
[1:41:44] question is were they coming for the
[1:41:46] word because if you're coming for the
[1:41:48] word they're not not going to be in and
[1:41:49] out jumping from church to church
[1:41:52] church but we're going to have that
[1:41:54] because of the generation we live in and
[1:41:56] we have a small little core in our
[1:41:58] church in a small little core maybe in
[1:42:00] your church that's really catching it
[1:42:02] and anchoring to this word because we
[1:42:04] can't force this on people we can't
[1:42:07] force anything on people you say why
[1:42:08] don't they get it why don't they get
[1:42:09] mine why don't they anchor and settle
[1:42:11] down I don't know why it's the age it's
[1:42:13] the time but we keep preaching it and if
[1:42:16] you got a core that's saying we go
[1:42:18] forward we're moving on with this word
[1:42:21] there'll be some join along with you but
[1:42:23] we're not looking at the disappointments
[1:42:25] we're not looking at the we're not
[1:42:26] looking at the ups and downs of
[1:42:29] people there's something anchored in our
[1:42:31] hearts can you say amen amen I hope this
[1:42:34] is ministering to you this
[1:42:36] morning Hallelujah so we're under
[1:42:39] expectations for the right
[1:42:42] thing amen there's something about said
[1:42:46] being to something to be said about
[1:42:48] expectations and longing for something
[1:42:51] and then we get nervous and try to
[1:42:53] produce something in that Abraham and
[1:42:55] Sarah with Hagar the promise was
[1:42:58] supposed to come and they got nervous
[1:43:01] Sarah got nervous maybe he meant Hagar
[1:43:04] we can really produce a lot of ishmail
[1:43:06] in our life if we're trying to produce
[1:43:09] something
[1:43:11] ourselves
[1:43:14] Hallelujah I look at the prophet
[1:43:17] um it's interesting when he talks about
[1:43:19] the many meetings that he had which were
[1:43:22] powerful but many places he'll say
[1:43:25] things like this we've had Miracles
[1:43:27] we've had things that God has had men to
[1:43:29] wait he's performed Miracles it but it
[1:43:31] never changed our country sin is on the
[1:43:34] Rampage worse than it ever was and moved
[1:43:36] right into the locks of the church and
[1:43:38] has tore it up what did our miracles do
[1:43:40] what did our healing campaigns do I
[1:43:43] believe in Divine Healing but you but
[1:43:45] you can never major on a minor divining
[1:43:49] Divine Healing is a minor we we can
[1:43:50] never major on those things the church
[1:43:52] ought to be in maturity by now and we've
[1:43:55] had rushing winds and we've had all
[1:43:57] kinds of Sensations and where the
[1:43:59] where's the church at where are we at
[1:44:01] today still more denominations growing
[1:44:03] every day and colonizing and everything
[1:44:05] and still the same men what we need is
[1:44:07] to wait till we hear the voice of God as
[1:44:10] individuals every man and every woman
[1:44:13] 1959 he says no one never knew what
[1:44:15] those Visions has caused me they're
[1:44:17] awful hard on me and if it could be just
[1:44:19] one then the rest of them would be all
[1:44:21] right but it's not but it's one it's got
[1:44:23] to be all or they just don't want to
[1:44:25] believe it what he's saying is people
[1:44:26] once they get a vision of the Lord
[1:44:27] through the prophet there's all they
[1:44:29] they want a vision they don't want to
[1:44:30] have their hands laid on them they don't
[1:44:32] want to just believe in their seat right
[1:44:34] right I want a vision from the prophet
[1:44:36] they learn to depend on that that's true
[1:44:38] and that's not maturity no you don't
[1:44:40] need a vision every day to live this
[1:44:42] word that's right you don't need a dream
[1:44:44] to live this word you have his word we
[1:44:47] have a more sure word of Prophecy
[1:44:48] Hallelujah hlj you got everything you
[1:44:51] need to go forward can you say amen and
[1:44:53] but he says people are depending on it
[1:44:55] and if it's one that's got to be all or
[1:44:57] they don't want to believe it so the
[1:44:58] church is not in its right State we have
[1:45:01] to remember it's not matured the church
[1:45:03] is not matured so we just have to linger
[1:45:06] and do the best we can and there's no
[1:45:08] one can bring it to maturity only the
[1:45:10] Holy Spirit as we listen to it I don't
[1:45:13] believe it'll ever come by man it'll
[1:45:15] have to come by
[1:45:16] God God all the time was looking for
[1:45:19] something more in individuals even in
[1:45:21] the healing revivals of the prophet he
[1:45:23] was looking for something deeper in
[1:45:25] individuals something deeper than
[1:45:27] majoring on a minor amen not a deeper
[1:45:30] knowledge but deeper in our walk in the
[1:45:32] spirit sons of God being led by the
[1:45:34] spirit of
[1:45:35] God both of these quotes I read to you
[1:45:37] and many others refer to the word
[1:45:39] maturity he's proclaiming that the
[1:45:41] expectations that we're under for the
[1:45:43] church is a maturity in Sons that's my
[1:45:46] emphasis today manifestation in Sons is
[1:45:49] happening now there's power with it but
[1:45:51] not just with you can't preach holy
[1:45:54] ghost's power without preaching Holy
[1:45:56] Ghost character and growth in character
[1:46:00] you can't just preach the power but
[1:46:02] growing into maturity you can't preach
[1:46:05] expectations of power without preaching
[1:46:08] expectations of maturity of
[1:46:11] sons
[1:46:15] hallelujah amen amen so all creation is
[1:46:19] groaning and waiting for this did you
[1:46:21] ever think if animals if they're all
[1:46:24] under expectation for the manifestation
[1:46:26] of something you ever think of if they
[1:46:28] could talk to
[1:46:30] you and they've got this groaning and
[1:46:32] exp what they could say to Sons and
[1:46:35] Daughters of God I know I think about
[1:46:38] stupid things like this but if an animal
[1:46:40] if a squirrel could talk to you today
[1:46:41] when you go home and you got your your
[1:46:43] squirrel there in the neighborhood and
[1:46:44] he comes up wonder if they could talk
[1:46:46] wonder what they would say to the
[1:46:48] bride they can't talk you know they just
[1:46:51] have a spirit they don't have a soul and
[1:46:53] they can't talk to but I wonder if they
[1:46:54] could talk if they're groaning for this
[1:46:56] manifestation of the sons of God they're
[1:46:58] waiting on this I wonder if they would
[1:47:01] you know I I don't think they're
[1:47:02] concerned about who the next president
[1:47:05] is I don't think they're about concerned
[1:47:07] about what next movie is coming out of
[1:47:09] Hollywood I don't they're not concerned
[1:47:11] about their next meal because God takes
[1:47:13] care of
[1:47:14] them they don't worry about where the
[1:47:16] next you know they're taking care of
[1:47:19] they're not what do they thinking about
[1:47:21] if they could talk they would probably
[1:47:22] say hey you guys that are the bride get
[1:47:25] your act
[1:47:27] together grow in the Lord get your act
[1:47:30] together we're waiting on you to get
[1:47:33] your act together get a hold of this
[1:47:35] word get filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:47:38] let's finish this up because we're
[1:47:40] wanting to see the restoration of all
[1:47:42] creation we want to see this Earth
[1:47:44] purged by a fire and a new millennium
[1:47:47] come and it's because sons are getting
[1:47:48] in their place oh what if animal animals
[1:47:51] can't talk uh I know what they think
[1:47:54] about I know dogs I hate dogs I don't
[1:47:56] like dogs dogs I know what dogs think
[1:47:59] about it's food all the time it's food
[1:48:02] which I can relate to that a little bit
[1:48:04] myself I can relate to that a little bit
[1:48:06] thinking about food all the time but uh
[1:48:10] dogs I I don't like dogs if you're a dog
[1:48:12] lover praise the lord and there will be
[1:48:15] dogs in heaven you have a quote for
[1:48:19] it but I just don't like them so when we
[1:48:22] get the other side just keep them on the
[1:48:24] other keep them keep them to your
[1:48:28] yard but if if if if creation if the if
[1:48:32] the if the raccoon could speak to you
[1:48:35] today I wonder if they're under groaning
[1:48:38] under these expect I wonder if they
[1:48:39] could say that to you say Hey
[1:48:43] listen get your act together and get a
[1:48:46] hold of this word this thing's about
[1:48:48] wrapped up and it all depends on you
[1:48:50] yielding yourself to
[1:48:52] God oh praise the Lord I love him don't
[1:48:55] you I think of I just will close this I
[1:48:59] think of uh Hannah being under certain
[1:49:02] expectations to have a baby
[1:49:05] Hannah uh is a special lady in the
[1:49:07] scripture because she wanted a baby and
[1:49:10] pray for my daughter she wants another
[1:49:12] child too I was just talking to brother
[1:49:14] in the back and they had a child after
[1:49:17] 16 years so I I'll tell my marah that
[1:49:20] when I get home uh and encourage her
[1:49:23] because God can still bless you with a
[1:49:25] child you know after that many years I'm
[1:49:28] not praying that for me and my wife at
[1:49:30] all we we just want grandkids we don't
[1:49:33] want but uh I'll encourage her with that
[1:49:36] but Hannah she she had she wanted to
[1:49:39] have a baby which is very much like a a
[1:49:43] mom wants and she craves to have a child
[1:49:46] but the thing about Hannah and she was
[1:49:49] she lived in Conant craving and
[1:49:51] expectation for that but she didn't
[1:49:53] wasn't catching the god part because
[1:49:56] there was a prophecy over Hannah's
[1:49:59] life that she wouldn't just be having a
[1:50:01] baby but it would be a special baby it
[1:50:04] would be a a prophet and it would
[1:50:07] fulfill the word of the Lord so when
[1:50:08] your life comes under the word of the
[1:50:10] Lord you can't just have these desires I
[1:50:12] want this I want that it has to come in
[1:50:14] tune with the will of God Amen you see
[1:50:17] and so now there was a little change I
[1:50:19] talk about a little change and I'm going
[1:50:21] to close here in just a minute but
[1:50:22] there's a little change needed in the
[1:50:24] attitude of Hannah it's not that was it
[1:50:26] was wrong that she wanted a child but
[1:50:28] she had to get her life and her
[1:50:30] expectations in line with the
[1:50:32] predestinated plan of God you see so it
[1:50:35] wasn't wrong for her to have a baby but
[1:50:37] she had to align herself and you young
[1:50:39] people listen you'd be better to get
[1:50:40] your life under the will of God right
[1:50:42] now when you're young than to wait till
[1:50:45] 30 years from now and say Lord what is
[1:50:47] your blueprint God has a blueprint for
[1:50:49] every every one of your lives God has a
[1:50:52] plan and say Lord I want to fit right
[1:50:54] into that plan show me your plan and
[1:50:58] Hannah was crazy and so as the scripture
[1:51:00] says she had uh her husband she had two
[1:51:03] wives and the other wife was having baby
[1:51:06] after baby Hannah's having nothing and
[1:51:08] she as as the other woman has all these
[1:51:11] children constantly having kids she
[1:51:14] becomes more depressed she had an
[1:51:16] oppressor the Bible says she gets more
[1:51:18] into depression she's all angry she even
[1:51:20] gets a tad angry at God she's upset and
[1:51:23] every year she's going to the temple
[1:51:24] asking for the same request I want to
[1:51:27] have a baby and she brings it every year
[1:51:29] they come to the temple every year I
[1:51:31] want to have it and she was depressed so
[1:51:32] every year she came before the
[1:51:33] congregation she's got this same request
[1:51:36] she's got the same expectation and she's
[1:51:38] she's very depressed when she sings a
[1:51:41] special nobody wants to sing hear to
[1:51:43] sing anymore because it's such a
[1:51:44] depressing special and it's the same
[1:51:47] song every year uh it's is probably
[1:51:50] called a song like woe is
[1:51:52] me cuz that's how her attitude was she
[1:51:56] was serving the lord and she was and
[1:51:58] then look at the scripture her husband
[1:52:00] comes and says what can I do to help you
[1:52:02] you know how can I get you out of this
[1:52:04] depression oh my goodness that you know
[1:52:06] I I'm your husband ain't I better than
[1:52:08] 10 Sons to you and he's saying what am I
[1:52:10] shop liver you know hey you know how
[1:52:13] about me you know but that wasn't good
[1:52:14] enough she wanted a baby you know she
[1:52:16] comes every year she sings whoo is me
[1:52:19] whoo is
[1:52:20] me wo is me cuz I don't have a baby I'm
[1:52:25] making this up as I go
[1:52:27] along depressing song and nobody wanted
[1:52:30] her to sing anymore because it's the
[1:52:32] same special it's the same depression
[1:52:34] and it brings the whole there's no
[1:52:36] revival going on it
[1:52:37] just brings the whole atmosphere down
[1:52:40] it's because of her attitude and there's
[1:52:41] just a little change needed in Hannah's
[1:52:46] attitude see it had to come in line with
[1:52:49] something deeper and that's what I'm
[1:52:51] preaching to you this morning our
[1:52:53] expectations have to come in line with
[1:52:55] God's
[1:52:56] expectations and when they do then we
[1:52:59] have joy so she came one year and you
[1:53:01] know what she God allowed her to tap
[1:53:03] into that book of redemption that book
[1:53:05] of life and she tapped in her prayer now
[1:53:08] her prayer was deeper because it tapped
[1:53:10] into the predestinated will of God now
[1:53:12] she didn't come that year and just pray
[1:53:14] for a baby she said Lord if you give me
[1:53:16] this baby notice the unselfishness
[1:53:19] notice she loses some of her unselfish
[1:53:21] her
[1:53:22] selfishness if you give me this baby I'm
[1:53:24] going to give it back to the temple and
[1:53:26] I'm going to give it back to God that
[1:53:28] was the difference it wasn't wrong with
[1:53:29] having a baby but she aligned her desire
[1:53:31] in and tap her prayer tapped into the
[1:53:34] predestinated plan of God and she said
[1:53:36] if you give it to me and then soon as
[1:53:38] she said that God looks wow she just
[1:53:40] lined herself with my plan and now I'm
[1:53:43] going to bless her now I'm going to
[1:53:45] bring what she desires amen you see so
[1:53:48] then the Bible says when she released
[1:53:50] that prayer she didn't even have the
[1:53:52] baby yet but she worshiped different
[1:53:54] when she came to the temple that day
[1:53:56] even the the priest and the the person
[1:53:59] in charge says she's acting drunk she's
[1:54:01] acting drunk she's been drinking and
[1:54:03] Hannah gets mad said I'm not drinking
[1:54:05] like you suppose but I've released this
[1:54:07] to the Lord and I believe God's going to
[1:54:09] bless she just it's like where where
[1:54:11] Hannah's back what's what's she doing
[1:54:13] she's out of her depression
[1:54:15] now praise the Lord and she almost
[1:54:19] rebukes the pastor and says I'm not
[1:54:21] drunk like you're thinking don't look at
[1:54:23] me that way but I have brought my prayer
[1:54:25] to the Lord I'm going to give that child
[1:54:26] to God and and so her attitude changed
[1:54:29] to positive and the right expectation
[1:54:32] before she even had the
[1:54:34] baby that's what's got to happen friends
[1:54:37] God help me God help me and the prayer
[1:54:40] lines most of the prayer lines brother
[1:54:42] brandham
[1:54:44] saying prays for them and said now go on
[1:54:46] your way happy and rejoicing many of
[1:54:49] them had not been healed yet but go on
[1:54:51] your way happy and rejoicing as if the
[1:54:54] work's been done CU it's our attitude
[1:54:56] about it in other words your attitude
[1:54:58] should be just as if God's already done
[1:55:00] the
[1:55:01] promise when God can see that Bo I tell
[1:55:03] you it begins to move had he writes the
[1:55:06] right
[1:55:07] attitude the right attitude about itall
[1:55:10] trigger the Holy Spirit and so Hannah
[1:55:14] comes to church after she talks to the
[1:55:16] priest and she I'd like to sing a
[1:55:18] special and everybody goes no don't
[1:55:19] don't let her sing please get somebody
[1:55:21] else don't and she said please let me
[1:55:23] sing so she gets up that year and it's
[1:55:25] not the special woe is me she's not
[1:55:27] depressed she getes I just want to
[1:55:29] testify the Lord today praise the Lord
[1:55:32] I've released this to the Lord I believe
[1:55:33] the Lord's going to give me a baby if he
[1:55:35] does it that's fine but I believe he's
[1:55:37] GNA and when he gives it to me I'm GNA
[1:55:39] give it back to the Lord and I'm here to
[1:55:40] shout and give glory to God today and
[1:55:42] everybody's going wow wow praise the
[1:55:44] Lord this is a new Hannah she's never
[1:55:47] come to church this way amen
[1:55:50] and she sings maybe every praise is to
[1:55:54] our God every word of worship in one
[1:55:58] Accord Every Praise every I don't know
[1:56:00] if you know that one but that's probably
[1:56:01] the one Hannah sang I imagine Hezekiah
[1:56:04] Walker's song every praises to her God
[1:56:06] and she starts to shout all over that
[1:56:07] building she doesn't even have a baby
[1:56:09] yet brother John but she's shouting
[1:56:11] praising God as if she has it
[1:56:14] already Hannah's attitude come under the
[1:56:17] expectations of God and she was living a
[1:56:20] better attitude didn't even have the
[1:56:22] baby yet went home got pregnant had the
[1:56:25] baby gave him back to God it happened
[1:56:27] she's rejoicing in the Lord before she
[1:56:30] has it that song every
[1:56:33] praise a a little black boy five years
[1:56:37] old I believe it was was kidnapped in
[1:56:40] Atlanta Georgia remember the story few
[1:56:43] years ago and he was kidnapped and he
[1:56:46] sang that song all day in the back of
[1:56:48] the van he was taken hostage and he sang
[1:56:51] that so every praise is to our God he
[1:56:54] sang all day until the kidnapper got so
[1:56:56] frustrated with him he took him back to
[1:56:58] the house dropped him off to the parents
[1:57:00] says take this kid off my hands I can't
[1:57:02] stand him
[1:57:07] anymore and I seen the news I seen the
[1:57:09] news the news interviewing this boy he
[1:57:11] says what did you do what did you well
[1:57:14] he told me I couldn't say anything but
[1:57:16] he didn't tell me I couldn't
[1:57:18] sing so I just sang the whole time I
[1:57:21] couldn't talk but I sang and it's how it
[1:57:23] happened praise be to God that's how
[1:57:25] they did it in the book of Acts in the
[1:57:27] jail that's how they did it in the book
[1:57:29] of Acts in the jail they just begin to
[1:57:32] sing the Praises of all Mighty God it's
[1:57:37] a change in our expectations it's a
[1:57:39] change in our attitude and that little
[1:57:42] term a little change is in the message
[1:57:46] humble thyself after the seals were
[1:57:48] preached brother Brandon was looking for
[1:57:50] a little change and he saysi just
[1:57:52] praying for a little change in my own
[1:57:55] life and he said after the seals after
[1:57:58] the seals I'm praying for a little
[1:58:00] change in my own life he said not that
[1:58:03] I'm sinning or not not that he says I
[1:58:05] just need a little change in my life he
[1:58:07] says I need to love people a little
[1:58:09] deeper I've called these guys the Ricky
[1:58:11] and retas and he said the Lord Tomo
[1:58:13] shouldn't do that he said I need to go
[1:58:16] out to them and I need to have Grace for
[1:58:18] them and love them that was the theme of
[1:58:20] it but he needed a little change you
[1:58:21] know most often us preachers are
[1:58:23] preaching on the big change and I could
[1:58:25] have preached that this morning the big
[1:58:26] change which is the rapture the big
[1:58:27] change of our bodies a lot of preachers
[1:58:30] preach on it it is a truth we're going
[1:58:31] there we're headed there but this wasn't
[1:58:34] the big change he said I just need a
[1:58:36] little change Hannah needed a little
[1:58:39] change in her
[1:58:42] attitude we need a little change in our
[1:58:45] attitude we may not be need big changes
[1:58:48] today but but we need a little change in
[1:58:50] our attitude to set us under the correct
[1:58:53] expectations of what God is going to do
[1:58:57] the future is looking so bright I got to
[1:59:00] wear
[1:59:02] sunglasses the future is looking bright
[1:59:04] for these children the future is looking
[1:59:07] bright for this
[1:59:08] congregation not not because of the
[1:59:10] circumstances or the disappointments
[1:59:12] it's because we hold God's word here and
[1:59:15] so the future looks bright because of
[1:59:17] that let's have those
[1:59:19] expectations the manifestation of the
[1:59:22] sons of God is upon us it's not coming
[1:59:25] it's it's actually now we are the sons
[1:59:28] of God and it does not yet appear what
[1:59:30] we shall be but when he shall appear we
[1:59:32] shall be like him he's appearing right
[1:59:34] now so it's our time for the
[1:59:36] manifestation of the sons of God when he
[1:59:38] appears and we see him in All His glory
[1:59:40] and revealed in the seals the bride
[1:59:42] looks at that and they're transformed
[1:59:44] because when they see him they see
[1:59:46] themselves they see their true identity
[1:59:49] and they rise to the occasion and that
[1:59:51] sets them under expectations of where
[1:59:54] this actual this message and this word
[1:59:56] can actually take us it's Limitless it's
[2:00:00] it's an inexhaustible Fountain brother
[2:00:02] brandom called it it's not
[2:00:05] exhaustible it's Limitless in its power
[2:00:09] its character where it can take
[2:00:11] us it is the book of our
[2:00:14] identity how do I know that that book of
[2:00:16] redemption was a book of identity in our
[2:00:18] true biography because when he opened it
[2:00:21] in Revelations 5 they begin to worship
[2:00:24] not because they had power to cast out
[2:00:26] Devils but they begin to worship and say
[2:00:29] he hath made us Kings and
[2:00:33] Priests this word is making us into
[2:00:36] something this word is maturing us
[2:00:39] because we're coming to a kingdom Age
[2:00:41] and what do you need in in a true king
[2:00:43] and a true PE priest you need
[2:00:46] character nothing worse than a country
[2:00:48] having a prime minister or a king
[2:00:50] without character power without
[2:00:52] character is satanic this kingdom is
[2:00:54] going to need character to rule and
[2:00:56] Reign and we're getting that through our
[2:01:00] trials it's the book of our identity it
[2:01:02] made them into something and it
[2:01:05] corrected or it it enhanced their
[2:01:07] worship because their worship was not
[2:01:10] about the power of sons but what the
[2:01:12] word was making them which Jesus
[2:01:14] corrected his disciples CU they came
[2:01:16] back rejoicing that the Devils were were
[2:01:19] subject to them and Jesus said don't
[2:01:22] worship because the devils are subject
[2:01:24] to you but worship because your names
[2:01:27] are in this
[2:01:28] book that's the reason for worship
[2:01:31] that's the deeper purpose of
[2:01:37] worship oh I love him this morning let's
[2:01:39] stand together if you
[2:01:48] would
[2:01:53] let's just bow our heads and you raise
[2:01:55] your hand and say pray for me brother
[2:01:57] Paul that this word would be manifested
[2:02:00] more and more in my life God bless
[2:02:04] you this manifestation of the sons would
[2:02:07] come to fruition in my life this
[2:02:11] maturity this attitude this this little
[2:02:14] change that brother Brown even wanted in
[2:02:16] his own life this little change would
[2:02:17] happen in me as well
[2:02:20] and I could go forward with the word and
[2:02:23] the season he's given me to live in he
[2:02:25] didn't call me to Paul's day or Luther's
[2:02:27] day or Wesley's day he called me to live
[2:02:30] and go to school and go to work in this
[2:02:33] time in this age under these
[2:02:35] circumstances and if he put me here
[2:02:37] he'll give me the strength to be able to
[2:02:41] live the life in this particular
[2:02:46] generation Our precious Lord
[2:02:49] we just feel a solemn feeling towards
[2:02:53] you this
[2:02:55] morning and we love to rejoice and we
[2:02:59] love the stimulation of Revelation and
[2:03:01] we do feel very moved today Father I
[2:03:04] feel moved in my heart again over these
[2:03:07] subjects and these things but Lord
[2:03:10] sometimes it's just in these peaceful
[2:03:12] moments we just want to say how much we
[2:03:15] love you how much We crave for you how
[2:03:18] much more of you that we want father and
[2:03:21] somehow Lord take us in the condition
[2:03:24] we're in and take us as Brother Bruce
[2:03:27] sang to us this morning we sang together

[2:03:33] Ground I'm pressing on an upward Way new
[2:03:37] heights I want to be gaining every
[2:03:41] day oh God take us to Higher Ground take
[2:03:45] us to higher places take us to deeper

[2:03:54] attitude is like Hannah that we just
[2:03:55] want something just for ourself forgive
[2:03:58] us of that father and may we rearrange
[2:04:00] our lives every day that we're seeking
[2:04:03] to tap into that predestinated will for
[2:04:06] our lives that we're looking for Jesus
[2:04:09] to be
[2:04:10] born even amidst all the embarrassing
[2:04:13] circumstances in our past we're looking
[2:04:16] for your word to be born in our lives we
[2:04:19] pray father that you would uplift the
[2:04:20] people here at send theight that you
[2:04:24] would encourage them that you'd
[2:04:25] strengthen them Lord that you would put
[2:04:28] a fire deeper and deeper in each of them
[2:04:30] Lord for the commission you've given
[2:04:33] them in this particular season in this
[2:04:35] area that you have commissioned him to
[2:04:38] be here with this Lighthouse it's not up
[2:04:40] to us who you bring but Lord we pray
[2:04:43] you'll call your last elected seed if
[2:04:46] they be in this area may we be a
[2:04:48] available to them to minister to teach
[2:04:51] to to create an atmosphere for a new
[2:04:54] birth may we always continue to be
[2:04:57] available for that Lord May the fires of
[2:05:00] God continue to be in our brother John
[2:05:02] our brother Bruce and the leaders and
[2:05:04] deacons of this church and the women

[2:05:24] ever before I pray for it in my own
