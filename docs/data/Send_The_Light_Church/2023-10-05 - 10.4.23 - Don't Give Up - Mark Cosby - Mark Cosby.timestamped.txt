[31:41] immensely and there was one
[31:44] thing that helped that trust to be as
[31:48] great as it is because it can only be
[31:51] God is was his faithfulness to the word
[31:54] of
[31:55] God he was just faithful
[31:58] and when you're faithful to the word you
[32:01] don't have to worry about getting
[32:04] hurt can you say amen amen amen so we
[32:09] just appreciate the life that he's lived
[32:12] here and
[32:14] uh through everything I mean what a
[32:18] wonderful privilege to see him grow up
[32:22] spiritually and what a privilege it is
[32:24] to see him obey
[32:27] what he feels in his
[32:29] heart and have faith to to leave
[32:33] everything that means so much to him
[32:36] honestly and

[32:50] more uh because we're not here to
[32:53] encourage and put our arm around him and
[32:56] say I love you and it's good to see you

[37:31] much uh for each and every one of you
[37:33] who's been a part of my life all of you
[37:34] guys have been a part of my life for all
[37:36] the prayers and support for all these
[37:38] years this helped me made me the man I
[37:40] am today each one of you and I just
[37:43] thank God for each one of you and I'll
[37:45] never forget you know where God shaped
[37:48] me and molded me here in Michigan it's
[37:50] send the light um so I really appreciate
[37:52] that and this this is get into the word
[37:55] we'll bow our heads
[37:58] oh dear heavenly father we just thank
[38:01] you for this Precious Moment
[38:03] Lord it just felt like this day just
[38:07] came up so quick Lord amen Lord as we're
[38:10] just here tonight Lord I pray you just
[38:12] move in such a mighty way Lord may you
[38:15] bring your word to life like only you
[38:17] can Lord may you move me out the way
[38:19] Lord I'm nothing without you lord I pray
[38:22] that you speak to your children tonight
[38:23] Lord may you just bring each quote to
[38:26] life scripture to life Lord and may we
[38:28] just be able to say that we met with you
[38:30] Lord personally tonight we ask all these
[38:33] things Jesus Christ name we pray amen
[38:36] amen so if we turn to our Bibles in uh
[38:39] Philippians chapter 1
[38:42] amen and we go over verse 6 get there
[38:46] myself getting used to a mic and a iPad
[38:51] and a Bible at the same time bear with
[38:54] me good practice
[38:58] So reading uh chapter 1: 6 very familiar
[39:02] scriptures we all read before so it says
[39:04] Paul speaking being confident of this
[39:06] very thing that he which hath begun a
[39:10] good work in you will perform it until
[39:12] the day of Christ Jesus you may be
[39:15] seated amen so we see that God has
[39:17] started a work in us and so what do we
[39:21] have to worry or fear if God has started
[39:23] that work all you have to do is trust
[39:26] that if God has called you if you can
[39:28] see in your life where God has just
[39:30] moved mightily just your nature changed
[39:32] your attitude changed then you got to
[39:34] have faith that God can handle anything
[39:36] and everything in your life and so the
[39:39] title of this uh little sermon is don't
[39:41] give up CU we've all been tempted to
[39:43] give up in life whether it's been a job
[39:46] or whatever it is family whatever it is
[39:47] we've been tempted to give up but if you
[39:49] give up the victory will not come and so
[39:52] whatever you're doing if it's a workout
[39:54] goal if it's a diet goal whatever it is
[39:56] you have to not give up to succeed in it
[39:59] so we don't have to worry all we have to
[40:01] do is trust in God your life is in his
[40:04] hands he has a plan for you and let's go
[40:07] to Jeremiah 29 so God has a plan for
[40:10] each one of us and it's up for us to
[40:13] find out what that plan is personally
[40:15] your plan is not my plan and my plan is
[40:16] not your plan so it's a custom plan that
[40:19] God has for each one of us so Jeremiah
[40:22] 29 111-113 we've heard this many times
[40:25] but we really need to just get the the
[40:27] spirit behind what God is trying to tell
[40:29] us in here so verse 11 for I know the
[40:32] thoughts that I think toward you sayeth
[40:35] the Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[40:37] evil to give you an expected End Amen so
[40:42] God wants to see you prosper he wants to
[40:45] see you blessed not not just financially
[40:47] but spiritually see God wants to work at
[40:50] the inside and the outside let's go to
[40:53] verse
[40:54] 12 then you shall call upon upon me he
[40:56] shall go and pray unto me and I will
[40:59] hearken unto you and now it get really
[41:01] into depth in 13 it's talking about you
[41:03] know he has plans to prosper you but how
[41:05] do you go about finding that out and it
[41:07] says in verse 13 and he shall seek me
[41:10] and find me when ye search for me with
[41:13] all your heart so it's a personal thing
[41:15] you have to search it out you have to
[41:17] ask God what is your plan for my life
[41:20] because you can live a life of L
[41:21] luxurious riches and all these things
[41:24] but that's not necessarily the plan that
[41:25] God has for your life you can't place
[41:28] riches against God's plans cuz
[41:30] Prosperity doesn't mean you're
[41:31] prospering with God we have all these
[41:33] mega churches out here and all these
[41:34] other these things but doesn't mean that
[41:36] they're prospering with God so riches is
[41:39] not always a sign God can bless you
[41:40] Abraham was a rich man Solomon was a
[41:43] rich man but they didn't desire after
[41:44] these riches God blessed them for
[41:47] faithfulness amen he said ye shall seek
[41:49] me and find me when ye search me with
[41:52] all my heart so that's the part that you
[41:54] and I play you have to seek and in
[41:56] search what God has for your life God
[41:58] promis you'll be the best thing you ever
[41:59] done in your life I can testify of that
[42:02] and we all can testify of that amen now
[42:05] be found of you sayeth the Lord and I
[42:07] will turn away your captivity and I'll
[42:09] gather you from all nations from all the
[42:11] places whether I have driven you sayeth
[42:13] the Lord so amen so God has a plan for
[42:16] your life I love that let's go to
[42:18] Deuteronomy
[42:22] 4 verses
[42:25] 29-31
[42:30] amen how many love the word tonight amen
[42:33] amen so
[42:35] 29 but if from thence Thou shalt seek
[42:37] the Lord thy God look it's talking about
[42:39] seeking God again that's how important
[42:41] that is to God cuz he's a Gentleman Just
[42:44] As You Like Somebody's knocking at the
[42:46] door of your house you have to let them
[42:47] in and the same thing with God you have
[42:50] to invite him into your heart he's not
[42:52] going to force himself but he's waiting
[42:54] for you to let him in so he can up with
[42:56] you to have fellowship with you it's a
[42:59] personal Affair but if from then Thou
[43:02] shalt seek the Lord thy God thou shall
[43:04] find him so it's saying if you truly
[43:06] seek God with all your heart he will be
[43:09] found he'll make known himself to you
[43:11] because he sees the motive and intent of
[43:13] your heart to know
[43:15] him amen it says with all thy heart and
[43:18] with all thy Soul so you have to put
[43:20] your all into it if you put your all
[43:22] into it God is going to be known to you
[43:24] personally look what ver vers 30 says
[43:27] when thou are in Tribulation amen and
[43:30] all these things are come upon thee even
[43:32] in the latter days if thou see if is a
[43:36] conditional
[43:37] statement so something is if you do this
[43:41] if thou turn to the Lord thy God and
[43:43] shall be obedient unto his voice so
[43:46] obedience is key just as a a parent is
[43:48] raising a child they expect the child to
[43:51] be obedient and if the child is not
[43:53] being obedient he's not going to get
[43:55] rewarded because you don't reward bad
[43:57] hav with good things because you become
[44:00] a spoiled brat so for the Lord thy God
[44:04] is a merciful god so we serve a god of
[44:06] Mercy a god of love and grace but we
[44:08] also serve a god of judgment so you
[44:10] don't want to spurn the grace of God you
[44:14] don't CU he's given each one of us a
[44:16] chance to serve him to get to know him
[44:19] in a personal way but you have to take
[44:22] that step you have to take that leap of
[44:24] faith it may not you may understand it
[44:26] because you can't understand god with
[44:28] human intellects cuz you weren't meant
[44:30] to understand god with human intellects
[44:32] his ways are past understanding distrust
[44:34] believe amen amen so he will not forsake
[44:38] thee neither destroy thee nor forget the
[44:41] Covenant of thy fathers which he swear
[44:43] unto them amen see the problem is a lot
[44:46] of times we want God in our own terms
[44:49] and own conditions but you got to come
[44:51] to God in his terms and conditions and
[44:55] and the thing is we we want all the
[44:56] benefits we want all the blessings we
[44:58] want all our bank accounts full we want
[45:00] our house payment full all these things
[45:02] but if you're not going God's way then
[45:05] how is he going to reward you he rewards
[45:07] faithfulness if you're faithful to God
[45:09] he will be faithful to you simple as
[45:12] that don't make it complicated God is
[45:14] hidden simplicities you don't have to
[45:15] put your name on the book or give give
[45:17] money to this and that but just give God
[45:19] your heart that's all he asked and I
[45:22] promise you'll be the best thing you've
[45:23] ever done in your entire life I promise
[45:26] you but are we willing to pay the price
[45:29] are we willing to surrender oursel are
[45:32] we willing to let him take control of
[45:33] the driver's will see you can't hold on
[45:36] and let God and God is going to hold on
[45:37] at the same time God is waiting for you
[45:40] to let go and sit in the backseat and
[45:42] prepare for the ride let him be the
[45:44] pilot of let him take you to the
[45:46] destination he wants you to go to amen
[45:49] let's go to Second
[45:50] Timothy Chapter 2 chapter 2 veres
[45:54] 1-4
[45:58] thank you Jesus see we we've come too
[46:00] far to give up we've come too far in our
[46:03] walk with the Lord to let something
[46:06] Sidetrack
[46:08] us and we got to get
[46:10] back we got to get back in the groove of
[46:13] things put your foot pedal to the metals
[46:15] they
[46:16] say so second Timothy read verse chapter
[46:19] 2 amen let me get there
[46:24] myself amen
[46:29] and we'll start with verse one Paul an
[46:32] apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[46:34] God according to the promise of life
[46:36] which is in Christ Jesus that promise is
[46:38] to you and to me to Timothy my dearly
[46:41] beloved Son grace and mercy and peace
[46:44] from God the father in Christ Jesus our
[46:46] lord I thank God whom I serve from my
[46:49] forefathers with pure conscience that
[46:51] without ceasing I have remembered of
[46:53] thee in prayers night and day greatly
[46:56] Desiring to see that being mindful of
[46:58] the tears that I may be filled with joy
[47:01] verse 5 when I call to remembrance the
[47:03] unfin faith that is in thee which dwell
[47:06] first in thy grandmother Lois and thy
[47:09] mother inise and I am persuaded that alt
[47:11] thee also wherefore I put thee in
[47:13] remembrance thou stir up the gift of God
[47:16] which is in thee by the putting on of
[47:17] hands look what verse 7 says right here
[47:20] for God ha not given us the spirit of
[47:23] fear so when we fail to give up
[47:26] that's not God telling you to give up
[47:28] that's the enemy speaking lies to you to
[47:31] give up cuz it said my Bible says here
[47:33] that God has not given us the spirit of
[47:36] fear but what but of Power of Love of a
[47:39] sound mind says verse 8 be thou
[47:43] therefore be not therefore ashamed of
[47:46] the testimony of Our Lord nor of me his
[47:48] prisoner but be thou partaker of the
[47:51] afflictions of The Gospel According to
[47:52] the power of Goden amen and then let's
[47:57] go to uh amen now we go to chapter 2
[48:01] verses 1- 4 that was verse that was
[48:03] chapter 1 so thou therefore my son be
[48:07] strong in the grace that is in Christ
[48:10] Jesus so notice Paul isn't saying be
[48:12] strong in the politics that you're
[48:13] watching or be strong in the trends and
[48:16] the fashion statements and the movie
[48:17] stars but he said be strong in Christ
[48:21] Jesus because that's the only strength
[48:23] that's going to last Heaven and Earth
[48:24] will pass away but word will not pass
[48:26] away so you can put all your eggs in a
[48:29] basket on on stocks I'm not not getting
[48:31] stocks stocks are good not saying that
[48:33] but you don't put all you have into
[48:35] stocks put all you have into Jesus cuz
[48:38] that's the only investment that will
[48:40] never fail see investments will go up
[48:43] and down but Jesus Christ won't he's the
[48:45] same yesterday today and forever so he's
[48:49] un he doesn't change he told us that
[48:52] amen let's go to verse two and the
[48:54] things that thou has heard heard of me
[48:56] among many witnesses the same commit
[48:58] thou to Faithful Men Who should be able
[49:01] to teach others also so look what the
[49:03] motive is when you give your heart to
[49:05] God and you start growing you want to be
[49:07] able to teach somebody the same thing
[49:09] that God has taught you teach them to be
[49:12] a leader teach them what surrendering
[49:14] really is what a Christian Life really
[49:16] is your life needs to be a Bible to
[49:19] somebody not you can't just cram the
[49:21] Bible down people's throats what you
[49:24] believe you should be living it and
[49:26] people should be able to see that
[49:28] organically see a sheep does not
[49:31] manufacture wool but a sheep Bears wool
[49:33] and the same thing with this gospel you
[49:35] have to bear it let the Lord just bear
[49:37] the gospel in you that's the that's the
[49:40] desire of every Christian is to let let
[49:42] Let Jesus be saw in me in you amen let's
[49:46] go to verse three thou therefore endured
[49:48] hardness as a good soldier of Jesus
[49:50] Christ so we're we're in a a Heavenly
[49:52] Army a Heavenly military amen so so
[49:55] we're soldiers and we get and there's
[49:57] going to be hardness there's going to be
[49:59] pressure there's going to be uh
[50:00] sufferings there's going to be hardships
[50:03] that's part of a Christian
[50:05] Life verse four no man that worth
[50:08] entangle himself with the fairs of this
[50:11] life that he may please him who had
[50:13] chosen him to be a soldier so our desire
[50:16] and our goal is to please our Lord and
[50:18] savior because the end of the day that's
[50:20] all that's going to matter not how much
[50:22] you have in your savings account not not
[50:25] you that that you can retire at 45 or 55
[50:27] it doesn't matter cuz tomorrow is never
[50:30] promised I this could be my last day you
[50:33] ever seen me again I could die the next
[50:34] day you never know and so you want to
[50:36] make sure that every Stone's unturned
[50:39] that your heart is right with God
[50:41] tonight because at the there's no you
[50:44] can't if you're dead there's no you
[50:45] can't make anything up you can't go back
[50:47] in time so make it right tonight
[50:50] tonight's the right night amen amen 1953
[50:53] brother Brandon speaking here now along
[50:55] this journey he promised to supply every
[50:57] need we have so God knows every need
[51:00] you'll have from from last week until
[51:03] the end of your journey so don't think
[51:05] God doesn't know the Bible tells we have
[51:07] a high priest that can be touched by the
[51:10] feeling of our infirmities so he was
[51:13] watching human flesh like you and me he
[51:15] knows what pain he knows what what
[51:17] sadness is he knows what hunger feels
[51:19] like he knows what homelessness feels
[51:20] like he knows all these things he said
[51:22] the son of man is on place even to lay
[51:24] his head and so God understands how you
[51:27] feel amen amen he says whatsoever you
[51:31] will ask in my name that will I do
[51:35] whatsoever things mark 11:24 whatsoever
[51:38] things you desire When you pray believe
[51:41] you receive it and you shall have it now
[51:44] the thing is I want to add this to this
[51:47] now you can't just say hey Lord can I
[51:49] have five fleets of Cadillacs it doesn't
[51:52] work that way it no it doesn't work that
[51:54] way so the thing is it's the motive and
[51:57] attitude of your prayer that's going to
[51:58] touch the heart of God that's what's
[52:00] going to touch it not not how much he
[52:02] can bless you with this and that but
[52:05] what are you going to do that with that
[52:07] prayer that you ask God with when he
[52:08] answers it that's the key he's looking
[52:09] at now he gave us check this out he gave
[52:12] us the strongest weapon that there is
[52:16] it's not a nuclear bomb it's not a
[52:17] missile not a AK-47 not a tank but check
[52:20] what it is he gave us the strongest
[52:22] weapon that there is in all the world
[52:24] that's prayer
[52:26] prayer is what changes things the
[52:29] Christian doesn't realize what a force
[52:31] he has check this out when he kneels on
[52:35] his knees before who the almighty God In
[52:39] The Name of Jesus Christ he doesn't
[52:42] realize what power that is if the people
[52:45] could only realize that what is given
[52:48] right unto them anything that you ask
[52:51] for will be given if you can appropriate
[52:54] the faith to believe it for God's word
[52:58] is true remember that let's go to 2
[53:01] Corinthians
[53:03] 12 Amy
[53:07] man read verses 9-
[53:12] 11 amen so it says to
[53:18] another I'm in the wrong book second I'm
[53:21] in First
[53:23] Corinthians amen
[53:26] amen so right here this is Paul asked
[53:29] for something he had this uh this issue
[53:30] in his life and he asked God three times
[53:33] and Look What the Lord answer was he
[53:35] said we start pick up in verse eight for
[53:37] this thing I besought the Lord Thrice
[53:39] that it might depart from me verse n and
[53:42] he said unto me my grace is sufficient
[53:46] for thee for my strength is made perfect
[53:50] in weakness most gladly therefore will I
[53:54] rather Glory glory in my
[53:56] infirmities amen glory in my
[53:59] infirmities that the power of Christ May
[54:02] rest upon me verse 10 therefore I take
[54:06] pleasure and infirmities and reproaches
[54:08] and necessities and persecutions and
[54:09] distress for Christ sake for I am weak
[54:12] then I am strong so we say the way up
[54:15] with God is down you got to humble
[54:17] yourself before the Mighty God don't
[54:20] think you have everything figured out
[54:22] because I promise you you don't and know
[54:25] it all does not have it all figured out
[54:26] I've been there
[54:28] before so it won't it won't solve
[54:31] anything in fact it'll get you into more
[54:32] trouble than you
[54:34] realize so amen let's go to verse 11 I
[54:38] became a fool in gloring you have
[54:40] compelled me for ought to have been
[54:42] commended of you for nothing am I behind
[54:45] the very cheses of the Apostle though I
[54:47] be nothing to if to recognize that we
[54:50] came into this world with nothing and
[54:52] anything we have is by God's tender hand
[54:54] of grace and mercy that we have it we
[54:56] woke up today we woke up today not
[54:58] everybody has that testimony they woke
[55:00] up today God is giving you breath in
[55:03] your lungs he let you get out of bed
[55:06] thank you Lord he's giving you the
[55:07] health that you have maybe not be the
[55:08] health that you want but it's a people
[55:10] would kill to have the health that you
[55:11] have right now I promise you that
[55:13] there's people in a hospital bed laying
[55:15] on their back can't even
[55:17] move but we have the God has given us
[55:19] the ability to move to to work to pay
[55:23] our bills to drive to have a nice
[55:25] beautiful church so we got to be more
[55:28] thankful be more grateful amen look at
[55:31] it don't stop looking at the things that
[55:32] you don't have but be thankful the
[55:34] things that you do have cuz when you
[55:36] start looking the other direction you
[55:38] start you start becoming ungrateful you
[55:40] start murmuring you start complaining
[55:41] about everything then before you know it
[55:43] it gets contagious and the next person
[55:45] gets it's attitudes can be contagious
[55:47] it's like a basketball team you can have
[55:49] the best basketball players together but
[55:52] if they're all if if one has a rotten
[55:53] attitude it begins to spread and it
[55:56] ruins the whole team like one app a
[55:58] rotten apple with a bunch of Good Apples
[56:01] they start to spoil the other ones
[56:04] amen let's go to uh let's go to Mark
[56:14] 11 verse
[56:17] 22 so Look what Jesus said this this one
[56:20] simple statement right here and Jesus
[56:22] answering sayth unto them have faith in
[56:24] God that one statement but it's so
[56:27] powerful think about that have faith in
[56:32] God we read this already but we read it
[56:34] again for verily I say unto you that
[56:36] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[56:39] so it's not saying you got to be black
[56:40] you got to be white you got to be Asian
[56:42] you got to be Hispanic but saying who
[56:43] shall ever shall say unto this mountain
[56:46] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[56:48] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[56:52] so maybe somebody needs healing tonight
[56:54] maybe somebody needs Deliverance tonight
[56:56] you got to not doubt in your heart you
[56:58] got to believe that God can supply the
[57:01] need that you have amen the channel is
[57:04] open tonight but you have to be willing
[57:06] to get into that channel you be willing
[57:08] to say God I believe what your word says
[57:11] help my unbelief because I know you are
[57:14] God be thou removed and be cast in seed
[57:17] but shall not doubt in his heart but
[57:19] shall believe that those things which he
[57:21] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[57:24] whatso ever he saith verse 24 therefore
[57:27] I say unto you whatsoever things you
[57:29] desire When you pray believe that you
[57:32] receive them and you shall have them and
[57:36] look at verse 25 says right here and
[57:38] when you stand praying forgive if you
[57:40] ought against any that your father also
[57:42] which is in heaven May forgive you for
[57:44] your trespasses look at verse 26 says
[57:46] but if you do not forgive neither will
[57:49] your father which is in heaven forgive
[57:51] your trespasses forgiveness is one of
[57:54] the hardest things that a human being
[57:56] could ever do especially when somebody
[57:58] did you so wrong that it's not even
[58:01] funny but the thing is you got to be
[58:03] able to let go and the thing is you
[58:04] can't let go of it alone you need God to
[58:07] help you but you got to be willing to
[58:09] say God I want to get rid of this I want
[58:12] to make this a peace but lord I can't do
[58:14] it without you Amen on see you can't
[58:16] hold on to and expect God to do
[58:17] something you got to be willing to let
[58:19] go and let God have his way to give you
[58:22] that Spirit of forgiveness cuz he sees
[58:25] your heart Isaiah
[58:29] 49 how many love the word
[58:32] tonight it's his words not
[58:37] mine so we at 13-
[58:40] 16
[58:45] amen second
[58:51] amen
[58:53] second
[58:59] let me find it I think I got the wrong
[59:06] one I'm read a quote real quick I said
[59:10] Do you believe the seven Redemptive
[59:11] names so I want now let's get into the I
[59:15] the Lord just led me to this there's
[59:16] seven Redemptive names I'm not going to
[59:18] get a chance to get into all of them but
[59:20] there'll be maybe Lord willing when I
[59:21] come back be a part two so I really want
[59:23] us just to
[59:25] just realize what we have at our
[59:27] fingertips in God he's so many things to
[59:31] us I think a lot of times we don't just
[59:33] recognize how powerful and mighty God is
[59:36] how awesome he really is we just look at
[59:38] it like one channel of he's this but
[59:40] he's all over he's omnipresent he's
[59:43] everything amen do you believe the seven
[59:46] Redemptive names compound names belongs
[59:48] to Jesus if he wasn't and didn't fulfill
[59:51] in him was the seven compound names he
[59:53] was Jehovah J
[59:55] there is Jehovah Gyra God's provided
[59:57] sacrifice and you have to admit that or
[1:00:00] say that he wasn't the Son of God then
[1:00:02] then if he is Jehovah gy he is Jehovah
[1:00:04] rapi the Healer also for all seven
[1:00:07] compound names our Victory amen check
[1:00:09] that our Banner our Shield our buckler
[1:00:12] our healing our Salvation our provided
[1:00:15] sacrifice all laid in him think about
[1:00:18] that and when he died on Calvary he
[1:00:20] spoiled principalities raised up throwed
[1:00:23] his hands out said it's finished
[1:00:25] Hallelujah Devils trembled hell shook
[1:00:28] it's a type of every way and he rose up
[1:00:30] on Easter morning I am he that was dead
[1:00:33] and is alive again there he is Jehovah
[1:00:35] RFA Jehovah Manassa Jehovah jyra God's
[1:00:39] provided sacrifice couldn't have a word
[1:00:41] to say Amen so let's go to go to Genesis
[1:00:45] 22 so the first compound Redemptive name
[1:00:49] that we know him as is Jehovah Gyra the
[1:00:51] Lord will provide see God can provide
[1:00:55] at any time any way but you got to have
[1:00:57] faith that he can provide for you God
[1:01:00] can provide the very need that you have
[1:01:02] right now but if you can't trust that he
[1:01:04] can do that then how can he ever provide
[1:01:06] that need for you so you got to have
[1:01:08] faith that God is going to come through
[1:01:10] in the clutch he will come in as time
[1:01:13] and time again allow him let him be God
[1:01:16] in your life that's the key if you don't
[1:01:18] let God be God then he can never show
[1:01:20] you that Redemptive name right there
[1:01:21] Jehovah Gyra so we go to Genesis
[1:01:25] 22 and read verses 7 through
[1:01:30] 8
[1:01:38] amen so it says so it's after so Abraham
[1:01:41] had a son Isaac we all know the story
[1:01:44] and uh they were going up to the
[1:01:45] mountain and uh he had to sacrifice his
[1:01:48] son and look what uh Isaac asked his
[1:01:51] father here and Isaac spake unto Abraham
[1:01:54] his father father and said my father he
[1:01:56] said here I am thy son he said behold
[1:01:58] the fire in the wood but there's where
[1:02:01] is the Lamb for the burnt offering verse
[1:02:04] 8 and Abraham said my son God will
[1:02:08] provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[1:02:10] offering and how many are thankful for
[1:02:13] Jesus Christ tonight he was that lamb
[1:02:15] that God provided for us he was that
[1:02:18] lamb that gave you a way to life more
[1:02:21] abundantly the lamb that gave you a
[1:02:24] chance for deliverance gave you a chance
[1:02:26] for healing I know I can't speak for
[1:02:29] everybody but we all had past maybe some
[1:02:32] worse than others but we can all testify
[1:02:35] that God delivered us from that dark
[1:02:37] past not nothing that we did nothing
[1:02:39] that we could ever do or Merit but it's
[1:02:41] what he did
[1:02:43] so why would you denounce something
[1:02:46] that's free it's free to
[1:02:49] everyone amen let's finish verse 8 so
[1:02:53] they went both of them together together
[1:02:54] so God has provided a lamb let's go to
[1:02:57] Philippians
[1:03:01] 4:19
[1:03:10] amen
[1:03:13] amen look what it says right here so but
[1:03:17] my God shall supply all your need
[1:03:22] according to his riches and the glory by
[1:03:24] Christ Jesus I'm going to say that one
[1:03:25] more time but my God shall supply all
[1:03:29] your need according to his riches and
[1:03:32] Glory by Christ Jesus so Christ knows
[1:03:35] you have the need he knows whatever
[1:03:38] you're going through he knows it so stop
[1:03:41] doubting stop looking everywhere else
[1:03:43] but him and just believe that he's going
[1:03:45] to supply your need God knows we have
[1:03:47] spiritual needs physical needs but the
[1:03:49] most important need that you have is
[1:03:51] what's in here cuz if in here is
[1:03:54] supplied then the other is going to but
[1:03:56] seek ye first what the kingdom of God
[1:03:59] and what his righteousness and all these
[1:04:02] things shall be added unto you let's go
[1:04:04] to Matthew
[1:04:07] 6:25 we all know this we can all Quote
[1:04:09] this but I think a lot of times if we we
[1:04:12] got to be able to know it personally in
[1:04:13] the trial that we're going through
[1:04:15] because it's it's good if you can quote
[1:04:17] it but it's it being manifested in your
[1:04:19] life in the time of a trial cuz that's
[1:04:21] the most important time if it's that
[1:04:24] because if I if I can just quote it it's
[1:04:26] not going to do me any good but if I can
[1:04:27] live it that's when it's going to
[1:04:29] benefit me the best amen verse 25
[1:04:32] therefore I say unto you take no thought
[1:04:34] for your life what you shall eat or what
[1:04:35] you shall drink for for your body what
[1:04:38] you shall put on it's not the life more
[1:04:40] than the meat and the body than a
[1:04:42] Remnant behold the fowls of the air for
[1:04:44] they sow not neither do they reap nor
[1:04:47] gather into barns yet your heavenly
[1:04:49] father Feth them so God cares about the
[1:04:52] birds how much more does he care about
[1:04:53] you
[1:04:54] his child his son his
[1:04:57] daughter amen verse
[1:05:00] 27 say he even says are verse 26 he says
[1:05:03] are ye not much better than they verse
[1:05:06] 27 which of You by taking thought can
[1:05:09] add one cubid unto a stature how many
[1:05:11] can grow from 5 foot to six foot by
[1:05:13] themselves nobody in here nobody I bet
[1:05:17] we all wish we probably could at certain
[1:05:18] points in our life but you can't so
[1:05:20] verse 28 and why take ye thought for the
[1:05:23] remnant the lies of the field sometimes
[1:05:25] we get so focused on the problem that's
[1:05:28] going on in our life and the trial that
[1:05:30] we take our eyes off of
[1:05:32] Jesus and the key is if you keep your
[1:05:34] eyes on Jesus Christ your perfect
[1:05:37] sacrifice your lord your savior then you
[1:05:41] won't be wondering how I'm going get out
[1:05:43] of this what can I escape at but you're
[1:05:45] going to just be saying Lord what is the
[1:05:47] direction you want me to go in this
[1:05:48] trial what are you trying to just mold
[1:05:51] and shape in me I want to be able to
[1:05:52] find it I don't want have to go around
[1:05:54] the mountain again and again and again I
[1:05:57] want to be successful in this trial and
[1:05:58] go to another trial it's like leveling
[1:06:00] up in a video
[1:06:02] game you hit these levels you keep going
[1:06:05] but each level is a little harder it has
[1:06:07] to be like that one of my friends said
[1:06:10] this statement new levels new Devils
[1:06:13] it's the truth so go to verse go to
[1:06:16] verse 29 now let's finish 28 that's true
[1:06:18] brother and why take ye thought for the
[1:06:20] remnant consider the lies of the field
[1:06:22] how they grow they toil not neither do
[1:06:25] they spend and yet I say unto you that
[1:06:28] even Solomon in all his glory was not a
[1:06:30] raid like one of these wherefore if God
[1:06:33] so clothe the grass of the field which
[1:06:35] is today and tomorrow is cast into the
[1:06:37] oven shall he not much more clothe you
[1:06:40] of little faith so God is going to we
[1:06:43] said this he's going to come through he
[1:06:46] knows exactly when to give you the thing
[1:06:48] you need at the very time you need it
[1:06:50] see a lot of times we want something
[1:06:52] from God and if he gave it to you that
[1:06:54] time that you wanted it it would mess
[1:06:56] you up you would you would you wouldn't
[1:06:57] use it properly so God that's why God
[1:07:00] withholds certain things from us to a
[1:07:02] perfect time and so we got to trust that
[1:07:05] God knows the right time to give you
[1:07:08] something it's like with Daniel he
[1:07:10] prayed for 21 days straight God didn't
[1:07:13] give it to him in day 19 or day 18 but
[1:07:15] he waited after 21 days so this and you
[1:07:19] got to realize too sometimes something
[1:07:21] can be happening spiritual warfare and
[1:07:24] that's what the angel told him I was
[1:07:26] fighting and that's why I didn't get
[1:07:28] there on time so you got to hold the
[1:07:30] faith
[1:07:31] amen verse
[1:07:34] 31 therefore take no thought saying what
[1:07:37] we shall eat or what we shall drink
[1:07:38] whether we should be clothed for after
[1:07:40] all these things do the Gentiles seek
[1:07:42] for your heavenly father knoweth that
[1:07:45] you have need of all these things he
[1:07:47] does he knows the needs every single you
[1:07:49] can give me a list of needs God knows it
[1:07:52] amen you can give me a novel God knows
[1:07:53] it
[1:07:55] so look what verse 32 says or verse 33 I
[1:07:57] I love this is one of my favorite verses
[1:07:58] in the Bible amen but seek ye first the
[1:08:02] kingdom of God and his righteousness
[1:08:06] that's so check it out the first thing
[1:08:08] you have to do is seek first the kingdom
[1:08:11] of God seek his will for your life seek
[1:08:13] his will seek his kingdom and his
[1:08:15] righteous look what it says right here
[1:08:16] and all these things shall be added unto
[1:08:19] you spiritual natural you you you fill
[1:08:21] in the blank God is going to supply
[1:08:23] those needs but you first have to seek
[1:08:26] Him trust him believe him amen believe
[1:08:29] who he says he is because he is who he
[1:08:31] says he is verse 34 take therefore no
[1:08:35] thought for the tomorrow for the marrow
[1:08:36] shall take thought for the things of
[1:08:38] itself sufficient unto the day is the
[1:08:41] evil thereof amen let's go to John
[1:08:52] 6 so we have to exercise our faith we
[1:08:56] got to apply it like with the hup it was
[1:08:59] a simple common plan but you got to it's
[1:09:02] like you getting in your car you have
[1:09:04] faith when you get in the car is going
[1:09:06] to start that's the same type of faith
[1:09:08] when coming to God it's believe that God
[1:09:10] is who he is that's all you have to do
[1:09:13] just imagine getting in a car same type
[1:09:14] of Faith you
[1:09:16] have John 6
[1:09:21] 29-36
[1:09:22] amen
[1:09:25] Jesus answered and said unto them this
[1:09:26] is the work of God that you believe on
[1:09:28] him who have sent that's how simple it
[1:09:31] is God's Not trying to confuse you or
[1:09:34] get you to solve a mass equation or or
[1:09:36] or or go to catechism school or do all
[1:09:38] these things but he says this is the
[1:09:40] work of God that you believe on him just
[1:09:43] believe him from your heart not
[1:09:44] intellectually but really believe from
[1:09:46] your heart believe
[1:09:48] it then they said unto him what sign
[1:09:50] showest thou then that we may see see
[1:09:53] man is always trying to see something
[1:09:55] see see see see see I got to see this I
[1:09:57] got to see
[1:09:58] this that's not what God didn't say if
[1:10:00] thou can see it he said if thou can
[1:10:02] believest take God of his word test him
[1:10:05] say prove
[1:10:07] me he said our fathers that eat man in
[1:10:10] the desert as is written he gave them
[1:10:12] bread from Heaven to eat then Jesus said
[1:10:14] unto them verily verily I say unto you
[1:10:17] Moses gave you not that bread from
[1:10:19] heaven but my father give you that true
[1:10:21] bread from heaven for the bread of God
[1:10:24] is he which cometh down from heaven and
[1:10:26] giveth his life unto the world I love
[1:10:28] that Jehovah Gyra the per perfect
[1:10:30] sacrifice that bread that came to us
[1:10:32] from heaven was Jesus Christ amen 34
[1:10:36] they said unto them Lord ever more give
[1:10:38] us this bread and Jesus said unto them I
[1:10:40] am the bread of life he that cometh to
[1:10:43] me shall never hunger see in each one of
[1:10:48] us every person in the entire world God
[1:10:50] has placed a a hunger a thirsting for
[1:10:52] him and the thing is you get to choose
[1:10:56] what you feel it with right you can fill
[1:10:58] it with what womanizing you can fill it
[1:11:00] with alcoholism pornography but it will
[1:11:04] never satisfy you gambling addictions it
[1:11:07] will never satisfy because you'll be
[1:11:08] going to Pillar To Post trying to find
[1:11:11] some form of happiness but never being
[1:11:13] satisfied because you need more to even
[1:11:15] quench what's inside of you but when you
[1:11:18] come to God you don't have to keep
[1:11:20] searching because that's I remember when
[1:11:22] I gave my heart to the Lord 2017 I got
[1:11:24] that Revelation that it was he who
[1:11:27] completed me I had joy unspeakable I
[1:11:30] wasn't constantly searching anymore for
[1:11:33] for pleasure for happiness cuz it was
[1:11:36] right there in front of me joy was right
[1:11:37] there in front of me the whole entire
[1:11:38] time and I missed
[1:11:39] it and that's something each person has
[1:11:42] to experience personally the pastor
[1:11:45] can't push you into it I can't push you
[1:11:46] into it brother Jonathan can't push you
[1:11:47] into it but you have to experience
[1:11:49] yourself personally and it'll be the
[1:11:52] best experience you ever had in your
[1:11:53] life life Amy man I forgot where I'm at
[1:11:56] now verse 35 and Jesus said unto them I
[1:11:59] am the bread of life he that cometh to
[1:12:01] me shall never hunger he that believeth
[1:12:04] on me shall never thirst but I said unto
[1:12:06] you that ye also have seen me and
[1:12:08] believe not all that the father shall
[1:12:10] give giveth me shall come to me and him
[1:12:13] that cometh to me will I in no wise cast
[1:12:15] out for I came down from heaven not to
[1:12:17] do my own will but the will of him that
[1:12:20] sent me and this is the Father's will
[1:12:23] which has sent me check this out that
[1:12:25] all which he ha given me I should lose
[1:12:28] nothing but should raise it up again at
[1:12:31] the last day and this is the will of him
[1:12:34] that sent me that everyone which seeth
[1:12:36] the son believeth on him may have
[1:12:39] everlasting life and I will raise him up
[1:12:41] at the last day see God's desire he
[1:12:44] wishes that everybody would come to
[1:12:46] believe who he is but he knows that not
[1:12:48] everyone is going to come so but he
[1:12:51] still gives an opportunity a outreached
[1:12:53] hand
[1:12:54] to every single person because the day
[1:12:56] of judgment no man can say that God was
[1:12:59] not merciful and gracious unto them and
[1:13:02] so you have the choice right now you
[1:13:04] have the power of decision right now God
[1:13:06] is placed in your hands the power of
[1:13:08] decision right now this very moment and
[1:13:11] you got to choose what you're going to
[1:13:13] do with that decision I can't do it for
[1:13:15] you brother John can't do it for you
[1:13:16] sister an can't do it for Joseph can't
[1:13:18] do it for you but you have to make that
[1:13:20] choice amen the Lord will provide
[1:13:23] you just have to trust no matter how bad
[1:13:25] it gets just keep being faithful keep
[1:13:29] praying keep digging God will come
[1:13:31] through and don't just stop at only
[1:13:33] wanting him as a provider see a lot of
[1:13:35] people just follow him for the lows and
[1:13:37] Fishes a lot of people just follow him
[1:13:38] for Lord that's it bless me in this area
[1:13:41] help me pay this bill help me do this
[1:13:42] but after they get the bill paid they
[1:13:44] forget all about God see the thing is
[1:13:46] it's easy to serve God when you're
[1:13:49] you're you're flowering through the
[1:13:50] flowers when everything is good you're
[1:13:52] in the mountain top but when you're in
[1:13:53] the Valley can you serve God the same
[1:13:56] way is that same desire that same love
[1:13:59] there see that that's that's the real
[1:14:01] test right there if you have a
[1:14:02] relationship with God CU you should be
[1:14:04] able to praise God just as much on the
[1:14:06] mountain top as in the valley that
[1:14:08] should the cir the situation shouldn't
[1:14:10] change the circumstances of your praise
[1:14:12] it shouldn't your praise should just it
[1:14:14] should be a a perfect gradual increase
[1:14:17] if I can say it that way in fact you
[1:14:19] should be praising God even more I
[1:14:22] believe on the Mountain
[1:14:24] Top cuz if you can praise him on the
[1:14:26] mountain top then the Valle is are going
[1:14:28] to surprise you see a lot of times God
[1:14:31] has to get us in that Valley to really
[1:14:33] recognize who he really is cuz we think
[1:14:36] it's us that we do everything but if God
[1:14:39] takes his hand off of you you'll be sick
[1:14:42] your health won't be as good and the
[1:14:45] thing is we don't want that and and job
[1:14:48] didn't even have a choice but job still
[1:14:51] remained faithful to God his wife said
[1:14:54] won't you curse God and die his friends
[1:14:57] called him a secret sinner but yet he
[1:14:59] said the lord giveth the Lord take itth
[1:15:01] away blessed be the name of the Lord so
[1:15:04] during his darkest time his praise was
[1:15:06] still there his praise was still turned
[1:15:08] up he could still say Lord I love you
[1:15:10] Lord I Praise You amen and so we got to
[1:15:13] have that same type of attitude in our
[1:15:15] darkest trials because that's going to
[1:15:17] touch the heart of God he said my son
[1:15:18] isn't to serve me for Loaf and Fishes
[1:15:21] but he served me because he loves me
[1:15:23] amen amen beautiful let's go to John
[1:15:27] 6 and the thing is God isn't asking you
[1:15:30] to be able to understand everything he's
[1:15:32] not cuz we can't understand everything
[1:15:34] it'd be impossible let's go John 6: 6
[1:15:39] 67-69 so this this is uh thousands of
[1:15:42] people were following Jesus at this time
[1:15:45] they they they saw the Miracles he did
[1:15:47] the healings the Loaves and Fishes they
[1:15:49] saw multiply of the bread they saw all
[1:15:50] these things they they were Witnesses
[1:15:52] healing the sick lame being raised all
[1:15:55] these things that they witnessed they
[1:15:56] could say that I saw Jesus do this but
[1:15:59] when Jesus really started to get deep
[1:16:01] see that was the bait in the hook he
[1:16:02] started to get deep into what he was
[1:16:04] here
[1:16:05] for then we'll see what happened let's
[1:16:07] see what happened right here then said
[1:16:09] Jesus unto the twel will ye go also go
[1:16:13] away look what Simon Peter said then
[1:16:17] Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom
[1:16:19] shall we go thou has had the world's
[1:16:23] thou Hast sometimes this Old English
[1:16:25] gets me thou Hast the words of eternal
[1:16:27] life and we believe and are assure
[1:16:31] notice that we believe and are sure it's
[1:16:35] been made personal to them it wasn't
[1:16:37] made personal to the other followers the
[1:16:39] thousand people that follow Jesus even
[1:16:41] gave them power to heal the sick and
[1:16:43] cast out demons to all those people and
[1:16:46] they still didn't stay with him that's
[1:16:49] true think about that I can see why um
[1:16:53] um the Rich Young Ruler and the Lazarus
[1:16:57] how he said
[1:16:59] Abraham you think one rais from the dead
[1:17:01] will will persuade them he said not even
[1:17:03] one raised from the dead if they don't
[1:17:04] believe the prophets that's right so cuz
[1:17:06] these people saw what Jesus could do
[1:17:08] they knew even the Pharisees said we
[1:17:10] know that our man sent from
[1:17:12] God so it's not about seeing things it's
[1:17:15] about believing things amen amen and we
[1:17:18] believe and are sure that thou are
[1:17:20] Christ the son of the Living God you
[1:17:22] could ask pet can you explain all these
[1:17:24] things he said about eating flesh and
[1:17:26] all these things like no but I believe
[1:17:27] it amen
[1:17:30] amen Jesus answered them have not I
[1:17:33] chosen you 12 and one of them is a devil
[1:17:35] he spake of Jews the ISAT isar that the
[1:17:37] son of Simon for he is what should
[1:17:39] betray him being one of the 12 amen
[1:17:42] we're going get into our next uh
[1:17:44] compound Redemptive name next it ain't
[1:17:46] coming because that lays in Calvary it's
[1:17:49] already been done one one thing any man
[1:17:52] can do is is point you to what's already
[1:17:54] been done amen I can't do anything for
[1:17:56] you but I can point to you to who can do
[1:17:58] something for youz I have no power I'm
[1:18:01] weak undone I make mistakes I make bad
[1:18:05] decisions but I can point you to who
[1:18:07] changed my life and is still changing my
[1:18:10] life
[1:18:11] amen amen
[1:18:14] beautiful that's right he is Jehovah
[1:18:16] Gyra he is God's provided sacrifice and
[1:18:20] everything that you have need of him
[1:18:22] Lays in him so you have to go searching
[1:18:25] out in the world politics I'm not saying
[1:18:28] politics is bad to not keep informed but
[1:18:30] I think a lot of times we get so
[1:18:31] involved in what's going on in the world
[1:18:33] we forget about if I read the back of
[1:18:34] the book I win right so you know so
[1:18:38] doesn't matter what man can do to me God
[1:18:40] has a final say so that's right God has
[1:18:42] a final say so so let's not worry about
[1:18:45] Russia and all these things it's going
[1:18:46] to come to pass but let's let us be
[1:18:49] found hid in Christ be found hid in the
[1:18:51] word of God cuz that one thing will
[1:18:53] never pass Jesus told us is Heaven and
[1:18:55] Earth will pass but my words will not
[1:18:57] pass so we got to be found in the word
[1:18:59] that's why I want be found at is in the
[1:19:01] word of God let's go to Psalms
[1:19:06] 103 how we doing on
[1:19:11] time read verses 1-
[1:19:14] six bless the Lord oh my soul and all
[1:19:18] that is within me so we're talking about
[1:19:19] Jehovah RFI the Lord the Healer
[1:19:23] bless the Lord oh my soul and all that
[1:19:26] is within me bless His holy name that's
[1:19:29] some worship right there bless the Lord
[1:19:32] oh my soul and forget not all his
[1:19:34] benefits so there is benefits to serving
[1:19:36] God and and David is going to talk about
[1:19:38] a little bit right
[1:19:39] now who redeemed says who forgiveth all
[1:19:43] thy iniquities who Health all thy
[1:19:46] diseases so we serve a Healer that he
[1:19:49] can heal any disease no matter how
[1:19:51] terminal it is no matter how bad it is
[1:19:54] no matter whatever it is God can heal
[1:19:56] that very thing cuz that's the kind of
[1:19:58] guy he's a great physician for a reason
[1:20:01] says who redeemeth thy life from
[1:20:02] destruction so that's two things he's
[1:20:04] talking about forgiving your iniquities
[1:20:06] he's a Healer says he's a redeemer says
[1:20:09] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[1:20:11] so we can all testify at one point in
[1:20:13] our life we were in the path of
[1:20:15] destruction and God plucked us up and
[1:20:18] put us on Solid ground and he redeemed
[1:20:21] us thank you Lord says who crowneth thee
[1:20:24] with loving kindness so loving kindness
[1:20:26] is favor is
[1:20:29] Grace and Tender Mercies his his mercies
[1:20:32] are new every day every morning verse
[1:20:35] five and there some more benefits he's
[1:20:37] talking about who satisfies thy mouth
[1:20:40] with good things so that thy youth is
[1:20:42] renewed like eagles verse six the Lord
[1:20:45] executed righteousness and judgment for
[1:20:47] all that are oppressed he has made his
[1:20:51] ways known unto to Moses his action to
[1:20:53] the children of Israel the Lord is
[1:20:56] merciful more benefits and gracious he's
[1:20:59] slow to anger and I love this right here
[1:21:02] and plantless in Mercy he will not
[1:21:04] always CH neither he keep his anger
[1:21:06] forever Heath not dealt with us after
[1:21:08] our sins who's thankful that God doesn't
[1:21:11] judge you according to what you've done
[1:21:12] in the past but he said if you truly
[1:21:14] repent he throws it in a sea of
[1:21:17] forgetfulness never to be remembered
[1:21:19] again amen he would not always
[1:21:23] verse 11 for as the heavens is high
[1:21:25] above the Earth so great is his Mercy
[1:21:28] toward them that fear him so the type of
[1:21:30] fear we're talking about is a reverence
[1:21:32] is a respect that's the type of fear God
[1:21:34] just desires just respect him reverence
[1:21:37] him just lift his name up on high he's
[1:21:39] worthy of his praise and
[1:21:40] glory let's go to Psalms
[1:21:47] 107:20 he sent his word and healed them
[1:21:50] and delivered them from their
[1:21:52] destruction
[1:21:54] I'm going to read one more time he sent
[1:21:55] his word and healed them and delivered
[1:21:57] them from their destructions there's so
[1:21:59] many promises in this Bible that are for
[1:22:02] you the right mental attitude towards
[1:22:05] any Divine promise of God will bring it
[1:22:08] to pass so all these you got to put your
[1:22:11] name in the Bible that he was wounded
[1:22:13] for your for transgressions and by his
[1:22:16] stripes you are healed you got to put
[1:22:19] your name and say that this by he's
[1:22:20] talking to you each one to you
[1:22:23] personally but you got to make it so
[1:22:25] personal he has to be he said last last
[1:22:27] time we ministered my God my Fortress my
[1:22:31] righteousness my healer my deliverer he
[1:22:34] has to be all these things to you
[1:22:36] personally because he's not all these
[1:22:37] things personally you can never
[1:22:38] experience what God truly is amen let's
[1:22:43] go to Exodus
[1:22:51] 15:26
[1:23:00] 1526 amen so it says and said if thou
[1:23:04] will diligently hearken to the voice of
[1:23:06] the Lord thy God and will do that which
[1:23:10] is right in his sight and will give ear
[1:23:12] to his Commandments and keep all his
[1:23:14] statutes I will put none of these
[1:23:16] diseases upon you which I have brought
[1:23:18] unto the Egyptians for I am the Lord
[1:23:20] that Health thee amen so it's so simple
[1:23:25] all God requires is obedience he's not
[1:23:28] asking you to cut your arm off or or do
[1:23:30] the Double Dutch or whatever he's not
[1:23:32] asking all these complicated things but
[1:23:34] all he's asking is just believe me just
[1:23:37] listen to me that's all he's asking
[1:23:39] literally it's all he's asking and
[1:23:41] sometimes we make it so hard we get so
[1:23:42] caught up in all these other things just
[1:23:44] take God's word and believe him simple
[1:23:46] as that simple we go to 53 Isaiah 53:
[1:23:51] 4-8 then we'll jump to got time for
[1:23:54] maybe one more Redemptive
[1:23:56] name like I said before if we really did
[1:23:59] an in-depth study we'll be here all
[1:24:00] night and a year from now
[1:24:08] too 53: 4-8 surely Heath borne our
[1:24:12] griefs so he put your name surely Heath
[1:24:14] borne Mark Cosby's griefs and carried
[1:24:16] our sorrows yet we did esteem him he was
[1:24:19] stricken and smitten of God and
[1:24:20] Afflicted but he was wounded
[1:24:23] for Brother John Martin's transgressions
[1:24:25] he was bruised for sister Linda's
[1:24:28] iniquities the chastising of our peace
[1:24:30] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:24:33] healed put your name in there that's for
[1:24:36] you personally this is a love letter
[1:24:38] written back to you put your name in
[1:24:40] there and believe that it's written just
[1:24:42] personally for
[1:24:44] you verse six and all like sheep we have
[1:24:47] gone astray I can I can definitely say
[1:24:49] I've done that and we have all turned
[1:24:51] everyone to his own way and the Lord had
[1:24:53] laid on him the iniquity of us all thank
[1:24:55] you Jesus he was oppressed he was
[1:24:58] afflicted yet he opened not his mouth
[1:24:59] for you he's brought as a lamb to the
[1:25:02] slaughter as a sheep before his shears
[1:25:04] and dumb so he opened not his mouth he
[1:25:06] was humiliated for you so that cuz he he
[1:25:10] knew back in the Garden of Eden when
[1:25:11] Adam and Eve did that that sin or they
[1:25:14] disob obeyed God's voice he made a way
[1:25:17] he made a way a provided way it it took
[1:25:20] thousands of years because that's how it
[1:25:21] had to go be the perfect Plan of
[1:25:23] Redemption but when Jesus Christ rose on
[1:25:26] that Easter morning he made a way for
[1:25:29] all that to happen no matter how how
[1:25:31] what you did if you murdered somebody
[1:25:33] whatever whatever you've done God has
[1:25:36] made a way to cleanse you to redeem you
[1:25:38] thank you Lord so don't think you're too
[1:25:40] far gone because you're not Paul
[1:25:43] murdered murdered Christians Moses
[1:25:45] killed a
[1:25:47] man but look what look what they it's
[1:25:49] not about how you start it's about how
[1:25:51] you finish say say one more time it's
[1:25:53] not about how you start it's about how
[1:25:55] you
[1:25:56] finish amen he was taken from prison
[1:25:59] from the judgment and who shall declare
[1:26:01] this his generation for he was cut off
[1:26:04] the land of the living for my the
[1:26:05] transgression of my people was he
[1:26:07] stricken he made his grave with the
[1:26:09] wicked and with the rich in his death
[1:26:11] because he had done no violence neither
[1:26:13] was any deceit in his mouth yet it
[1:26:15] pleased the Lord to bruise him he put
[1:26:18] him the grief when thou shalt make his
[1:26:19] soul an offering for sin he shall see
[1:26:21] his SE he shall prolong his days and the
[1:26:23] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[1:26:25] his hand amen we go to Jo Jehovah roigh
[1:26:29] the Lord my shepherd it was funny that
[1:26:31] brother Jonathan mentioned Psalms 23
[1:26:33] because it's on my notes I was like wow
[1:26:36] I love how the Lord just gives us Little
[1:26:37] Golden nuggets
[1:26:39] just that's the scripture he want us to
[1:26:42] read so let's go to we'll finish off
[1:26:43] with Psalms 23 verses
[1:26:46] 1 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[1:26:50] want so you have to make the Lord your
[1:26:52] Shepherd the head of your
[1:26:54] life and it says he maketh me to lie
[1:26:58] down in Green Pastures he leadth me
[1:27:00] beside the Still Waters what what's
[1:27:01] weird to me sometimes is I don't know
[1:27:03] understand why they read this at
[1:27:04] funerals because to me it looks like
[1:27:06] it's talking about somebody who's living
[1:27:08] right now because it's kind of hard for
[1:27:10] the Lord to to Shepherd you if you're
[1:27:12] already dead cuz you know you can't just
[1:27:15] Shepherd a bunch of dead
[1:27:17] sheeps just saying so he make me to lie
[1:27:20] down in Green Pastures he leadth me
[1:27:22] beside the Still Waters he restoreth my
[1:27:26] soul he leadth me in Paths of
[1:27:29] righteousness for his name's sake so God
[1:27:31] is in the restoration business so he's
[1:27:34] see he doesn't do a one thing but he's
[1:27:36] constantly restoring you he's trying to
[1:27:38] make you of what the perfect image of he
[1:27:41] saw on Calvary of what you were so he's
[1:27:43] constantly trying to he just why he's
[1:27:44] leading you beside Still Waters he's
[1:27:47] shepherding you through these trials for
[1:27:49] a reason because he sees the potential
[1:27:51] in you he's trying to make that
[1:27:52] potential known it's like with gold when
[1:27:55] you first see gold you got to beat beat
[1:27:57] the gold until you see your image and we
[1:28:00] see the reflection that's what he's
[1:28:01] trying to do is seeing the reflection of
[1:28:02] himself inside of
[1:28:04] us amen I forgot where I was at verse
[1:28:07] verse four ye though I walk through the
[1:28:09] valley of the shadow of death so I want
[1:28:11] you to check this out when you're
[1:28:12] walking through the valley of the shadow
[1:28:13] of death in order for there to be a
[1:28:15] shadow there has to be light so there's
[1:28:18] light in that Valley keep walking until
[1:28:20] you he hit that light that full
[1:28:22] amen so y though I walk through the
[1:28:24] valley the shadow of death I will fear
[1:28:26] no evil say it with me I will fear no
[1:28:29] evil for thou are my rod thou are my
[1:28:32] staff they comfort me God is your
[1:28:35] greatest
[1:28:36] Comfort not binge watching shows which
[1:28:39] I'm not saying that's bad but don't look
[1:28:42] for comfort in other places because it's
[1:28:45] only going to give you temporal Comfort
[1:28:46] vacations are good but they're going to
[1:28:48] go away Monday morning is going to come
[1:28:50] so quick and you're going to say that
[1:28:51] vacation like it never
[1:28:53] happened and so your comfort has to come
[1:28:56] from God cuz Jesus said come unto me all
[1:28:59] you that labor labor and heavy laden and
[1:29:00] I will give you rest he said rest unto
[1:29:03] your soul cuz that's the only rest
[1:29:05] that's going to hold it's going to stand
[1:29:07] the test of the time is rest unto your
[1:29:10] soul verse five thou preparest a table
[1:29:12] before me in the presence of my enemies
[1:29:15] thou anointest my head with oil my cup
[1:29:17] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[1:29:21] shall follow me all all the days of my
[1:29:23] life and I will dwell in the house of
[1:29:25] the Lord
[1:29:27] forever so I just I just love that Psalm
[1:29:30] 23 it just it means a lot to me and
[1:29:33] we'll just we'll read one more scripture
[1:29:34] and we'll close here John
[1:29:50] 10 sh R verse n so Jesus says I am the
[1:29:54] door by me so he said he's the door he's
[1:29:57] the only way you can go through you can
[1:29:59] try to go through the Cellar Door the
[1:30:00] back door and that door may seem good
[1:30:03] cuz every way of a man is right in his
[1:30:05] own eyes but he's the only door that you
[1:30:07] can go through says I am the door by me
[1:30:11] if any man enter in he shall be saved
[1:30:13] and go in and out and find pasture the
[1:30:15] thief cometh not but for to steal and to
[1:30:17] kill and to destroy so the devil's job
[1:30:19] is to steal to kill and to destroy and
