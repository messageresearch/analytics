ass I guess I need to bring my hair glass [Applause] yeah amen let's all stand together and sing I know whom I have believed amen as brother John comes amen I know not why God's wonderous Grace to me he hath made known nor why unworthy Christ in love redeem me for his own but I know whom I have believed in and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day I know not how the saving Faith to me he did impart nor now believing in his word brought peace within my heart but I know whom I have beli and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day I know not how the spirit moves convincing men of sin revealing Jesus Through the word containing faith in him but I know whom I have believed in and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed to him against that day I know not what of good or ill may be reserved for me of we ways or golden days before his face I see but I know whom I have believed in and am persuad ated that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day I know not when my Lord may come at night or noon day Fair nor if I walk a veil with him or meet in in the air but I know whom I have believed it and and persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day but I know whom I have believed it and am persuaded that he is a to keep that which I've committed unto him against that amen that's Faith amen that's faith I know in whom I have believed in amen if someone talked to you in Jesus somebody can talk you out but if God has revealed himself to you no man can talk you out I am persuaded that he is able right good morning and God bless each of you good to see you my family the family of God together think about what it's going to be like brother Johnson when we're on the other side never have to depart no aches and pains no sicknesses no sorrow that's why we're here today amen because we're looking forward and we're believing we're persuaded that that day is coming amen amen God bless you this morning turn with me if you would to the book of second Peter chapter 1 and then also second Corinthians chapter 1 we want to uh hopefully we want to do part three and precious promises and if the Lord will help us to get through we have a lot of scriptures and we have uh honestly uh so many notes that in scriptures that we haven't read because there's so much uh in the Bible of course but there's so many promises of God and so many things but if we just if we go back and we we try to nail the highlights um I believe that there are many promises that we don't receive because we don't do our part now the biggest part is believing amen that's the biggest part but how can we believe if we haven't done what he's asked us to do so you see that that one point that we don't spend much emphasis on is I believe we need to get a balance because if we want our faith to grow we got to do the things that he's asking us to do to receive the promise amen amen amen let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer before we read Heavenly Father Lord this morning as we come before you we know Lord that without you we're nothing so we're asking that You' come and forgive us of all of our sins cleanse us of our unbelief wash Us in the pure blood that was shed at Calvary and let us be uh in perfect harmony with you this morning Lord we don't want to miss anything that you would have for for us and we pray that you'd give us uh ears to hear that still Small Voice as you're speaking Lord there's uh our brothers and sisters are here and they are going to be hearing from you and uh Lord uh there's going to be voices spoken uh Lord but we ask Lord that we would all be in tune with your voice this morning Lord the reason that we want to hear from you because you said my sheep hear my voice and they follow me we want to follow whatever you have for us this morning God we pray that you would prepare our hearts now if they're not prepared we ask Lord that the word would be accompanied with Revelation from above today Lord come and reveal let it let these words not be uh just uh words of spoken by a man but may they be spoken from Heaven this morning Lord we ask Lord Lord that you would give us a greater a a greater revelation of the promises of God this morning we commit it all to you and we give you praise in advance in the precious name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen second Peter chapter 1 just two verses there verses three and four according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these promises we might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through our desires amen and then second Corinthians chapter 1 verse 20 2 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 20 now uh for all the promises of God in him are yay and in him amen that's right unto the glory of God by us now he which establish us with you in Christ have anointed us is God who have also sealed us and given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts amen God bless you you may be seated for a subject this morning I want to focus on meeting God's condition is what builds fate to receive the promises so often I believe God's hidden Simplicity and and and God has often said if thou can't believe all things are possible amen but then we understand that there's sometimes an element of unbelief and and the one man said Lord help my unbelief help this element of of unbelief well all of God's promises are not unconditional they are conditional so there is a condition that has to be met and I believe by meeting God's conditions we can build the faith that we need for the very promise that we're wanting am I believe it's God actually transforms us through these promises so as we meet conditions we're obeying the word of God we're showing that we love him and he changes us he transforms us from Glory unto glory and it's through the Freemore agency it it's not by something that we are forced to do we don't come to church because our parents make us come we don't come because uh um well the Bible says that the Commandments of God are not Grievious so if we just love him we want to please him and as we as we walk in further obedience he changes Us in fact if we had time and we don't have time um in second Peter uh um he goes on and he talks about um giving all diligence and besides these precious promises give all diligence to add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge so you're adding these virtues to your life and that through these you become Overcomers and that if if these virtues aren't even in you it'll leave you Barren unfruitful of the fruit of God God right and uh um you you can even forget what God has done for you in the past the Bible says forget about what Calvary did for us and but if we're predestinated if we're elected then we make our election sure our calling sure we make sure that those virtues are in our life and some of these two of these virtues are actually the fruit of the Holy Ghost so it's a constant adding amen and through our obedience and adding these things to our life that we receive more of Christ in the image and that's what it's all about it's about us getting ready to get out of here he's coming for himself he's coming for himself he's coming for his wife which was a part of him at the beginning and it's taken all these years for all of us to get manifested through time and he's still waiting for the last ones to come in get manifested so we can get out of here so these promises are extremely important so we we talked about that we have a need of promises in our life because of problems and then God has a need of being preeminent in his bride so now we're trying to work these these two things out together and he tells us to put the yoke upon us his word to put it on us to get dressed with the word and let the word become our headship we no longer have a will we no longer want the the hey look at me I'm better we don't have that he's the great one and we actually esteem others better than ourselves we take on the nature of God Amen it's about his will so we grow in obedience we grow in faithfulness we grow closer to him because it's Christ in us the hope of glory now obedience to God's condition is the vehicle that builds our faith to receive the very promises that we want so of course how many times have we sat in church and just wish I had Faith to believe because you can't muster it I wish wish I had Faith to believe there are things that you can do to build your confidence you cannot sit back be lazy don't do the things that you know you should be doing and expect to have faith for things in your life because it's a relationship and brother Brandon makes this statement that God is not obligated to give you anything more if you haven't walked in obedience to what he's already given you in the past amen now our understanding tells us that we can have faith without obedience that's what our understanding tells us that we can have God's promises without being obedient in other words there's an attitude out there it says name it and claim it that's right name it and claim it attitude but God's Yoke the word of God teaches us that faith and obedience opens the doors to God's promises so we can say it like this name it follow the conditions and claim it so I believe in naming and claiming it but I believe in obeying it brother brandom said in the message sir we would see Jes Jesus he says now if it is the same Spirit then it'll do the same work if the people can get themsel in the same condition in the same condition in God's provided way brother Brandon said see we're finite we can say well I was wrong but he God can't be wrong that's right and be God so what action he has taken if he was called on the scene at one time to save a man and he saved that man on a certain basis If any man any time anywhere meets on the same Ground God is obligated to do it again if he healed a man because of his faith then he will have to meet then he will have to meet the same condition each time or he did it wrong when he saved the first man or healed the first man see so brother bandam is teaching us that if we just follow the pattern if we just do what others have done God is obligated to do what for us what he did for them it is no secret what God can do what he's done for others he can do for you amen now what is God's divine nature is it going to church is it paying ties what is his divine nature leoa is blind to God's divine nature why would God tell them to be zous and repent their attitude is not about adding anything to their life and any virtues or building their attitude is I'm in need of nothing in fact I come to church to feel good and if I don't get that hey they kicked Jesus out they brought the lights in they brought the comedians in they brought the entertainment they brought the singing it's no longer worship it's I want to be in a concert I want to feel good about this thing they haven't added ude that Jesus died for me the blood covers my sins see they're close but there's no conscience of adding anything to their life I'll say it like this how can the blood of Jesus Christ cover someone when they refuse to walk in the light and and that's that's the hiccup right there see they're claiming the blood but they're not walking in the light and my Bible tells me in first John that that God cleanses us as we walk in the light as he is in the light so we've got to we've got to take that yoke upon us the word says come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sin come out of that spirit that alls I have to do is what I'm doing right now that's all that's required how can God even speak to us about doing doing other things if we if if we just picture that uh the the form of godliness that I have is really the divine nature of God we need the power of God we need the power to to deny ourself the the the power to lay down our life the the power to to to put our brothers forth the the power to pray and get into Spirit the the power to live for God the power to reach out to others the power to save Souls a that wins Souls is wise leoda is blind but did you know even Believers can backslide and forget about God's divine nature but God has a remedy for the backslider the Bible Jesus said the Holy Ghost will bring all things back to your remembrance thank you Lord Jesus Galatians turn with me Galatians 5:22 this to me is the divine nature of God Galatians 5:22 but the fruit of the spirit is love it is Joy it is peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are are the seed of Christ they that are predestined they that are elected they that are Christ they do something what do they do they have crucified the flesh with the affections and their lustful desires because they can't interact the carnal nature in God's nature they fight their enmity with one another another amen and we don't got time to get into all these but I want to if I by that with the help of the Lord I want to talk about the first three love joy and peace now by these precious promises we tap in to Galatians 5:22 we tap into it amen we we tap into the divine nature at least this promise is telling us here now this this is this is not the one thing that attracts the attention of the The Sinner right this is not it what attracts their attention is seeing somebody healed right seeing some miracle but for those that are they know that they're going to be just like Jesus when he returns this is a precious promise that we can become into God's divine nature and not only that the Bible says it helps us to escape the corruption that's in the world oh I love this amen all right love we know God's divine nature is love the Bible tells us God is love Jesus said in Matthew he said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so this this love is really described in 1 Corinthians chapter 13 the the one very strong thing about it is it never fails our love fails God's love doesn't fail it's able to Bear any situation it endures all things it never stops hoping it doesn't think evil it's not puffed up it's it doesn't seek its own desires this love is supernatural and it is the divine nature of God for God so loved the world that he gave I want to tell you how many times have you woke up and said I I just I want to get and just give everything I'll tell you that's what Jesus did he gave this love is beautiful Ephesians 2 tells us God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we are dead in sins have quickened us together with Christ by Grace you're saved we're able to love God because he first loved us what I mean by that is he places his love inside of us hey look if if God God if God just comes down and showers us with his blessings and we all feel the love of God and we feel good it could be an hour after the service and we actually don't even feel that feeling anymore are you with me but if that love comes down on the inside of the inside of your soul now you're able to love him back with the same love that he's loved you with can you say Amen to that now let's look at the promise of love right here Romans 55 Romans 55 the love of God I want this promise how many wants love all right right here the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto usen it is impossible to have the love of God without having the Holy Ghost Inside you amen the Holy Ghost comes inside of you and it begins to work out its will its will its will is not to be ill towards somebody so if you're like I got this problem with this person and their bother and me but you've got to yield yourself to the Holy Ghost you've got to let God work in you both to will and do of his good pleasure and then you're able to love that person with no ill amen and this is how it works it's not a an emotional thing it's not a thing of feelings it's a thing of Faith the word says think no evil I will think no evil you believe the word you apply yourself to the word I can do all things to Christ it's a reality it's a reality to the believer amen so I want to say if you want more how many wants more love how many is refusing to participate in this it's simple seek the holy ghost seek more of the Holy Ghost the problem is we battle this thing I'm sealed already I'm sealed already I'm sealed I'm sealed there's I can't get anymore oh My my what a battle you must have what a battle you must have praise God for the seal praise God for how much Holy Ghost you have but I'm talking about getting more I'm talking about learning to yield to the Holy Ghost you do God because it will bring forth the genuine love of God Amen now the promise of the Holy Ghost Jesus Promised the Hol the Holy Ghost to us in John 14:16 says I will pray in the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever okay so this is just another promise okay um acts 238 gives us the promise repent be baptize every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so we we we talked about it you seek you knock you you you you ask and you keep doing it and we already know God's desire he wants to give us the Holy Ghost so much more than we want to give good gifts to our kids amen but we still got to do our part so the condition is we've got to truly repent we've got to truly repent we've got to have the correct baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we can't be baptized in the in the titles father son Holy Ghost it just doesn't work the correct baptism according to the gospel and when we meet those conditions we can have faith to receive the Holy Ghost are you with me now here's the big thing brother John how do I know I've truly repented this is a big one there's no doubt when everybody has repented they are sorry for the sins that they've done and they don't want those sins to stand in the way of them going to heaven but is that all that we need to repent for I guess that's a good question is that all we need to repent for in other words if I just repent for that and I continue to go live in the world the way I want to and do the things that I used to do right see if you repent of your past sins God will forgive you of your past sins but if you continue to walk out and do what you want to do hey look you've got new sins you've got new sins that's just all there is to it those things have to be dealt with so brother John how do I know if I've truly repented first you turn around you simply begin to do the Commandments of God so I Repent here I I I I I've repented I get baptized I'm washed I'm going to start walking in the will of God whatever he wants me to do I'm going to start doing it if this word tells me to do it I'm going to do it if you decide I I'm only going to do what I want to do I'm only going to come I'm only going to get I'm only well look there is no gospel for that there's there's no there's no there's no Assurance to that there's no Blessed Assurance of that type of walk you've got to turn around your life has to become off Christ and this is to me we need to evaluate have I do I wake up every day and give my all to God because Satan is on the other side every day trying to get you away from doing the will of God brother sister I'm thankful for every one of you that been baptized I'm thankful for every one of you that said I I want my sins under the blood and and I'm going to give my heart to Christ but today is the day of salvation and you need to make make sure that Monday through Sunday you're giving your all to God amen amen because if not we just become a denomination in the message right we become our own little belief system second you must begin the most important thing in your life which is fall more in love with Jesus every day that's how you know you've done a complete turnaround hey look when I was in the world I love the things in the world and I didn't even have to be taught to do them I just wanted to do them I saw them I heard them I tasted them I this is what I want but we've got to fall in love with Jesus now that that takes I'm GNA be honest with you that takes work you've got to be willing to crucify your flesh you got to be willing to pray and and read your Bible and listen to the tapes and and get into his presence so it does take efforts and Jesus said in for uh John 14:15 he says if you love me keep my commandments so love becomes the motivation for obeying the word amen it's no longer I have to it's I want to it's falling in love with Jesus now look at verse 22 John 14:22 Judas saith unto him not as scar yet Lord how is it that you're going to manifest yourself unto us but you're not going to do it unto the world and Jesus said unto him if a man love me the first thing he's going to do is obey me that's the first thing and my father is going to love him for it and you know what's going to happen we will come in unto him and we're going to make our bold now here's what's the beautiful thing about God coming inside am if the spirit of Beethoven Lives in me well I am going to play like Beethoven if the spirit of who's that artist Rim brand lives in me I'm going to be able to paint like Rim brand so if the spirit of the father is going to come and Jesus is going to live in me now I'm going to begin to manifest not knowledge but manifest manifest the life and it all stems from love I love God so much I'm going to keep his Commandments and just by that simple fact now we meet the condition the Holy Ghost comes in do you get it he gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him there's a condition that has to be met amen how are youall doing this morning you happy it we going to you is it time to stand up and sing all right verse 24 he that loveth me not keepeth not my Saints help us to love you Lord Jesus said the second commandment is liken unto the first love your neighbor as yourself so 1 John 4 1 John 4:19 and I got to go through a number of these scriptures just you know the more you can get behind it amen and get in with me the quicker I'll about able to go here we love him because he first loved us if a man say that I love God I love you Lord I love you but hates his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he have seen how can he love God whom he not seen so I'll just say it like this everybody feels they love God anybody talk to just about in the world that's uh whether they go to church don't go to church whatever it is oh yeah I love God he loves me I love him but it doesn't matter what they feel it doesn't ma matter what a man says it only matters what he lives so if he's talking ill of somebody something is wrong something is wrong somewhere and this is the Commandment which we've heard from him that he who loves God love his brother also now I'll tell you you know what it means to love your brother it means never ever ever ever ever do him any ill that's what that means don't do him any harm don't do him any ill but brother John I'm just human good get the Holy Ghost get more of the Holy Ghost I I'm okay with whatever you're going to say against that but I'm going to tell you there's a word for you to get better am because if we could all get in the condition that they were in the upper room right the Holy Ghost can fall and put us out there wining souls and never be afraid of what they're going to do to us amen CU that's what the happened to the disciples so I say to you if you love them that love you according Jesus what reward have you amen there are others that do that and if you salute just your favorite brother your favorite sister what do you more than others do not even the Publican Soul be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is Heaven is perfect oh this is so important this is the nature of God and we must get it we're not going into Rapture without the nature of God we're not nobody will go in the Rapture without the nature of God and in this age above every other age there will be more manifested Jesus Christ the life than in any other age so there is an high expectation that God has of us as we have an expectation of God that he would give us this promise that we're wanting are you with me all right he says in verse 44 but I say to you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you now I will say this God is going to put every one of us in a wonderful opportunity to do that a wonderful opportunity to fulfill that scripture amen and in order for us to fulfill that scripture we're going to have to deny ourself but we're also going to need to be filled with the power of the Holy Ghost because it's that power of the Holy Ghost that sheds its love into our heart whereby now we can look at our enemies the same exact way that Jesus does because because it's no longer you you can stand next to wish there's a a picture of Paul here but he says it's not I but Christ that liveth in me that's that's what I'm interested in I'm interested in having so much of Christ in me there is no fear because perfect love cast out all fear fear is going to come it's going to show its ugly head just be so full of God nothing nothing can separate you from the love of God all right but I say unto you love your enemy bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them despitefully use you and persecute is that is that a lot to do is that hard to do come on you those of you that that are not not getting into the service I'm speaking to you is is is is is this hard to do now look the believer can escape this corruption this Corruption of hate this Corruption of I don't like this Corruption of I'm not praying for them I'm just think of they don't do they did this to me that's corruption and the precious promise of God of his love you can escape those things do you see what I'm telling you yes that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh the son to rise on the evil and on the good and he sth Reign on the just and the unjust in other words God is expecting you he's expecting your your son the Christ in you to rise on the evil to send your Reign your goodness not yours but Christ goodness in you upon those that hate you those that are evil toward you God is looking for the same thing in us that he is but how can it happen how the realness is Christ in you yes when Christ becomes so real in your life that it happens organically it just happens you don't got a must it up it just flows because he's in there to meet the need it's a realness and I would rather have that above all the knowledge above all the Mysteries above everything I would rather have the love of God brother Brandon said in the message Shalom he says and I've come to that spot I believe that people don't know what they're doing can you say Amen it comes to the time to where the human beings has looks like has become such a subject to evil until it's a pathetic thing it seems like there's a shadow of Darkness just over the people that presses them you can relate to this can you not he says like for instance this one thing crossing the nation around and speaking and the Lord God identifying and vindicating his word and showing that's exactly and never let nothing be said unless it come to pass exactly what he said speaking it right into existence and so forth and he's been doing as he's been doing and people just sit there and look at that and continue right on in their same condition now he's talking about Humanity who's not changing God's whole desire for the bride is to change amen of course he would that all men would be saved but only the predestinated are going to get serious about this word they're the only ones that going to get dressed in it start living it making sure they're doing it and change like we don't need to see the Miracles we've already see received the message of the hour and the message of the hour is leading us up to the Statue of a perfect man it's leading us into the image of Christ so I can say with brother B amen what a pathetic thing to see someone who doesn't want to grow come on now I'm I'm not here to to judge I I don't mind provoking you just to want to grow a little bit more I want to read this next quote it's in the adoption because there's a strong Spirit a strong leodan spirit in this message that they just don't care about getting any more love than what they already got they they they they they they they they they have this badge on them I'm in the message I know this and that's that's all it's needed so now remember this is an adoption for so this is maturity right when you're talking about adoption talking about maturity amen he said that's he said that that's what bothers me though to preach to you people don't remain on the same condition that you've been going he said change now exclamation point hear me as I say it thus saith the Lord I've never called myself this I'm not that but you call me your Prophet or a prophet the world believes that the world around millions and millions and millions of people I've spoke directly and indirectly I really want you to listen to this quote I've spoke directly and indirectly to tens or 12 milli million people or more directly speaking I've seen tens of thousands of visions and signs and wonders and not one of them has ever failed wow what a testimony I'd like to have that testimony and that's right he's foretold me things that's never failed to happen just exactly I'll bring any man to trial for that that's right now I don't claim to be a prophet but you listen to me thus sayith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place wow wow you're going to go through all that tell me all your credentials tell me how God's never failed all these Mighty things all these seals and everything these Mysteries that you've talked about and you're going to bring me back to perfect love and he's saying thus sayith the Lord to two times I think this is important I think it's a I'm going to stay with the word I'm going to stay with the message thus saith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place for that's all there was there in other words there was nobody saying look at me I'm better than you look at me I did this there's none of that none of it he says no matter what money how much religious demonstration how many Good Deeds you've done or whatever you've done that won't count nothing on that day it'll take perfect love he says so whatever you do you lay aside everything else until you are just so filled with the love of God till you can love those who hate you now first of all we can't stand being around anybody that hates us in fact when we see somebody that doesn't like us we just hey hey Teddy how you doing I want to get to that place I want to get to that place sister Linda and you know what that means that means I'm going be tried a lot that means there's going to be a lot of guns pointed at me there's going to be a lot of hateful things said about me behind my back but I want to pass the test I want to pass the test because this is not my home I'm getting out of here but I want what I need to get out of here you you know back before we had phones you had to make sure you had your ticket in your hand before you went to the airport the ticket is perfect love it comes from being so full of the Holy Ghost God sees you keeping all his Commandments that he just comes takes his bold in you and that Holy Ghost working through your life nothing phases you nothing separates you no hate no Hurt No Pain perfect love and to be able to demonstrate it don't you think your heavenly father looks down upon you and smiles every time somebody does something mean to you and you genuinely love them not some make fake thing not something you make up but something real inside of you you can love them as if they never done it yes sir I'll tell you that put you in harmony with heaven today that put you on the right course and I'll tell you you don't need some theology you just need to believe what's been spoken and I'll say it like this to to many of us we are so busy in our life we're not we're not obeying what the prophet said he said lay it aside lay your busy schedule aside lay aside what is so important to you and go after something instead of just thinking it's going to come because your name is John John Martin I don't care for your name is John Martin and ain't coming to you until you lay everything aside and go after it and make sure you get it to be able to to demonstrate perfect love this is the victory that overcometh the world even your faith when you have faith and what's faith faith is confidence now how do I know how do I know brother Dennis you're the closest one I don't want to pick on Brother Joseph right here but look how am I going to have confidence to overcome this world to escape the corruption through lust this brother slaps me on the face talks behind my back stabs me with some rotten words look the only way I know I've Got Confidence is when I pass the test and genuinely love him for give him then I can have confidence then I can have faith this is what overcomes the world but if I say oh you know I don't have to apply that scripture because God God knows how vicious this was how real this was God knows how much I was hurt God knows what it made me feel like God knows it wasn't right what does that have to do with one thing don't lean to your own understanding lean to God lean on God lean on that word let this word become your headship amen I'll tell you the I'll tell you the bride's hat is the word it is the word it is the word it is the word amen I'm starting to feel like I want like I I want to preach right now let talk about Joy I don't know if we're going to get through this love joy now people have their different ideas about Joy you know some people just get Joy when they're cutting up you know what I'm saying laughing it up cutting it up proverb says Folly is joy to him that's destitute of wisdom but a man of understanding walketh uprightly let's talk about the the promise of Joy how many wants joy we could all use joy and I'm G tell you it is it is so important to have joy Jesus said in John 1713 says and now come I to the he's praying to the father he says I come now to thee and these things I speak uh these things I spake in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themelves I want God's joy fulfilled in me Psalm 1611 says Thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more so right in the presence of God are these precious Promises of Joy so we see the condition don't try to get the joy of the Lord without being in his presence amen when you know You' said something done something that griev G God maybe nobody knows about it but you grieve God I mean you got to take care of that thing you why because you got to get back into the presence of the Lord because that's where fullness of joy is that see people try to get the promise of God without the condition of God Joy is not just having a good time Joy is one of the most important fruits to have bearing in the believer's life and I'm going to tell you why it's crucial for our trials it's not about being happy it's not about feeling good Nehemiah says for the joy of the Lord is your strength the joy you need the strength that comes from the joy of the Lord to go through your trials so if we want joy we need to spend time in prayer get in the presence of God wait on the Lord and he promised that they that wait upon the Lord he shall renew their strength so how does he do it he gives them Joy well I tell you when the presence of God comes you get joy I don't care if you're crying I don't care if you're laughing you get joy when the presence of the Lord comes you do do I'll say it like this even when God's presence comes and You Feel So Unworthy God I'm not worthy you you repent can't you make things right I'm telling you tears make uh uh you may sow tears uh but they'll come forth reaping Joy the Bible tells us if we we sow tears of tears that will come forth reaping joy and I believe that if it's what you sow if you you repent you you get out of yourself and you say God I'm not worthy of you just fill me with your presence in his presence is fullness of joy amen they that soow tears shall reap in Joy all right we need spiritual strength to go through our trials do you believe that sometimes you're going through a try say I just I forget I'm I'm done with this I'm not doing it no more I've tried are you with me that's not the joy of the Lord that's not the fruit of God Isaiah 12:3 says therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of Salvation with joy you shall draw Waters out of the wells of Salvation amen now I would like to say for a moment H it takes effort to deny our flesh to come into this church and start drawing from the wells you just can't come in here with all your problems not caring always down the dumps always expecting God just to come no matter what your attitude is it takes effort if anybody's ever drawn water out of a well it takes effort I I don't think Rebecca just sat there and pushed the button for Isaac for eler I'm sorry for aler no draw and you know what she has so much joy hey I'm not only going to draw water for you I'm going to draw water for your camels and we know how much brother Bruce we know how much water she had to draw amen that's a lot of work we want the joy of Salvation we want God's presence but what do we do when we come in here don't want to draw sit here make that song leader let him let him do all the work make us feel good don't feed on the word don't hunger for the word and expect have the joy of the Lord Brother sister it ain't the preaching it ain't the singing it ain't because we're lacking instruments in here it's we're lacking a vision for God that's what it is yeah we we brought hey we just brought the tidwells here they lit up the place they lit up the place let me ask you do you got that same Joy is if you bring that same joy to church you will draw from the wells of Living Water if if I understand the scripture to the hungry every bitter thing is sweet we should not have any problem now we need the strength that comes only through Joy the joy of the Lord gives us strength to endure to be forbearing to be longsuffering to deal with our brothers and sisters to deal with our spouses to deal with our family members it takes the joy of the Lord uh Paul said I Endure all things for the elect sake so he must have had Joy Jesus had joy for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross you see Joy is important not just to feel good but to better go through your trials properly so you don't murmur you don't complain Paul said I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me who continues to give me joy a believer that doesn't have joy doesn't have strength he's going to fizzle out he's just going to fizzle out he's just going to all a sudden I I'm just going to go to church cuz it's time for church I'm just going to get on I'm going to go to work cuz it's time to go to work it just Fizzles out does it not be doesn't bear the fruit of the spirit are you with me our joy has ways of Disappearing how many truly has you you feel you you're you're missing the joy of the Lord in your heart all right just be be honest those of you that don't want to participate David said restore unto me the joy of thy salvation The Joy restore it we didn't lose salvation but I'll tell you what we did lose a closeness that we once had with God showing us that our relationship can be real close and be further away from Goden and this is important for us to see maybe if if Joy is missing maybe we got to dive in to to to just seeing God is there anything there that I should be doing just spend some time waiting for him on prayer if there is anything he'll show you he'll tell you you ever been in prayer and conviction just comes that you know what that is that's the Holy Ghost that's the Holy Ghost he's he's brighter than our hearts and then when we take care of it we have confidence that confidence gives us Faith to believe for the presence and then more joy comes into our life that's how it works we meet conditions that's what this whole thing is about amen now there's so many scriptures that I have to pass up because it's late H we have Wednesday we do H you know I really really really really have a lot of [Laughter] hair sometimes we do things that grieve the Lord sometimes we don't do things that Grieves the Lord and all of a sudden we keep doing that and then after a while we're missing joy and then we don't have strength to even do the things that we were doing and so Joy is such an important it's important promise for the believer it gives you strength to serve God the way you ought to serve God when I think about Paul when he was being told the Bible tells us that he was gone Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall him save the Holy Ghost is witnessing in every city that bonds and afflictions abide me who would want to go somewhere where you got trouble getting there you know what we do we we avoid talking to somebody on the phone when we think there's going to be trouble we avoid a text we avoid a handshake we here was a man that was not moved that's what I love what he had he says but none of these things move me neither count I my life dear unto myself so that I may finish my course with what joy joy strength he wasn't moved he had strength he was willing to do anything God wanted him to do amen and I know some of us feel so strong that we'll go up to some demon-possessed person and we'll just knock him in the face in the name of Jesus and I understand all that but do we have enough Faith to just get under our knees and be faithful in our prayer closet do we have enough Faith just just to come to church early get in the prayer room and pray for your brothers and sisters do you have you have enough Faith to to apply the thing that you heard the last sermon you listen to the last one you live stream the last tape you listen to the last time somebody sent you a text and said oh you know what that was just for me I needed that but then do we apply it you know what I'm talking about we'll take that little 60c word of encouragement but then what we do we let it go help us Lord brother Brandon said in the message where has thy strength gone Samson God's Bible says that he's the same yesterday today and forever and his power is the same they've come too late to tell me about it see I've experienced it I know what I'm talking about he's still God and he'll always be God and he is just as much God right here in this building tonight as he was on the day of Pentecost now we've got the same blessings the same thing if he can get the people in the same condition the same thing will operate every time we're looking to God to do all the work to bring these promises that we're wanting and the prophet is telling us that we've got to get in the same condition because God will do what he promised to do because he's God and he will not change see we're not fighting one another we're not fighting the denominations we're not fighting Hamas we're not fighting Russia we're not fighting China we're fighting principalities we're fighting spirits that are trying to keep us in a lukewarm Spirit that's what we're fighting I'll tell you I don't what are we waiting for we need men and women to rise up and say this day I give my all to the Lord this day I'm not waiting till tomorrow and you know what here's the sad thing we got to do it every day I I uh I like the inspiration that uh Sister Anne had when brother darl preached that message here in our church oh back in 2014 she was inspired to have that put on a plaque and we got it hanging in the back there this day I Give My All to Jesus Christ what I love about it is it wasn't just a good sermon it was something to live by it's something to live by God is calling us to live by these precious promises to take them take the conditions and build our confidence build our faith amen being confident of this very thing he which begun a good work he's going to finish it Joshua said every place that The Souls of your feet tread upon it's yours but be courageous be strong to do what to observe everything in the word of God Amen put the Yoke on make sure you do your condition because if you meet the condition God is Duty bound to give you whatever you're asking for whatever you ask in my name if you can believe all things are possible what I love about this little series it's little just three parts it it shows us how I can build my faith JW said building yourself up in the most holy faith faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God we've heard the word of God the word of God is telling us to start meeting his conditions right and when you meet the conditions then you have confidence then you can l a greater claim how many times have we heard sometimes God puts things on people for a reason right hey we got this in the Old Testament how many times did God allow the Philistines to come on the children of Israel because they were being disobedient because they weren't following the conditions of the word amen and only thing God wanted them to do was repent make things right and that there would be nobody to be able to stand before them all the days of their life I think in the spiritual realm that we're in we deal with Spirit sometimes that I'll be honest with you we've let come into our home we've let come into our life we we we've let just surround us and then we we come to church and we're hoping that there be some sort of miracle that happens where we don't have to do anything and God just delivers us from that well maybe God is wanting us to H humble ourselves before him call upon him I mean humble yourself under the mighty hand of God that he may lift you up well he can Li well why can't he just lift me up now brother John I want to be lifted up God is wanting you to get to a place where he can develop his character in you his nature so that Divine image of God that's what he's looking for if we lose sight of what God's trying to do in our life we may miss the importance of seeing why it's so important to obey the word amen God bless you let's stand together I love this word I'll tell you it's been a great blessing to me it's helped me to look at things differently that I probably get in the way of God accomplishing His blessings more than I realize either way we need to wait on the Lord because we get joy we give God a chance to speak to us a and then we get a chance to walk in his will I believe that we have a lot of tests coming don't you um we're going to turn on this air probably should have did that before you just you make it so hot in here you brought so much Holy Ghost with you you just like really putting this place on fire we're going to have to not quench the Holy Ghost but just get that the temperature a little bit cooler here he's going to shake heaven and earth right the bombs are coming that's true amen one day the door will be closed you will not even be able to call your favorite preacher favorite brother your favorite sister you won't be able to do that at that point time is running out very very quickly at that at that moment you don't have time to re-evaluate how you want to spend your time with God because we we're panicking where's our food going to come from do I have faith to pray my food on the table right now look this word that God has given us let's get serious about it it's real and I I don't believe G God is holding back any truth from us I believe he's given us everything that we needed that pain to life and godliness I believe it it's up to us when we leave here to love that word to love it I love it I want him to take a greater Abode in me so I'm gonna I'm gonna Ponder these things I'm gonna pray about these things and I'm gonna I'm gonna become more in love with God what's it going to do it's going to produce more of an obedience may God bless us with that is is my my prayer amen let's let's sing uh I know the Lord will make a way for me amen I know the Lord will make a way for me and I know the Lord will make a way for me if I live a holy life sh the wrong and do the right I know the Lord will make
