[15:36] there okay
[15:40] dad go fill
[15:46] in you want to come up
[15:57] here
[16:04] as much as I could talk to any of you
[16:06] personally and not be nervous I always
[16:08] get up here and immediately get nervous
[16:10] so forgive me
[16:12] um I was talking to somebody uh the
[16:15] other day and some things have
[16:17] transpired in in our life my life
[16:19] personally my walk with the Lord um but
[16:22] a lot of things that have affected my
[16:24] family
[16:25] and I was telling this person that I
[16:28] feel like I need to give a testimony but
[16:30] I I don't want to jump the gun if the
[16:32] Lord's got um a specific way that it's
[16:35] going to be shared or or what have you
[16:38] and this morning I woke up an hour and a
[16:40] half before my alarm went off and the
[16:43] song that I sang Over The Summertime
[16:45] with reys um God Will Make A Way is what
[16:49] I woke up to just in my mind and I could
[16:52] just like hear it like it was on a
[16:53] radio and
[16:55] um I was like all right lord well if you
[16:58] want me me to get up and and share these
[16:59] things then this is what I'll do so that
[17:02] song was on my heart if you haven't
[17:04] heard it I I uh encourage you to go find
[17:06] it and just listen to it because I stood
[17:09] here in front of all of you and sang
[17:11] that song just knowing that the Lord was
[17:12] going to make a way for me and my family
[17:14] and the things that I've been dealing
[17:16] with um so just a really abbreviated
[17:19] testimony there's so many things I can
[17:20] tell you but I just want to encourage
[17:22] you that whatever whatever it is that
[17:25] you're going through right now the Lord
[17:27] cares and we you might not see immediate
[17:29] results all the time but when it happens
[17:32] you're going to be moved amen
[17:36] um
[17:37] so nobody tells you when you first
[17:40] surrender your life to the Lord and you
[17:42] get baptized you may have dealt with
[17:44] hard things before but it's going to get
[17:46] harder and only by the grace of God can
[17:49] you make it
[17:51] through and um the Lord is just he's
[17:55] faithful okay so last summer I sang this
[17:58] song believing that the Lord was going
[17:59] to make way for me with these different
[18:02] situations and I just thought Lord I've
[18:05] already dealt with a lot of hard things
[18:07] how could it get any
[18:08] worse but it did and I kept saying to
[18:12] people that I would talk to and just
[18:14] share these trials with that were
[18:16] praying with me that I'm so boldly made
[18:18] the stand that I'm not backing down and
[18:20] I'm not going to stop coming to church
[18:21] I'm not going to keep making this stop
[18:23] making the sacrifice to have my children
[18:25] here especially on Wednesday nights when
[18:27] it would be so easy just to stay
[18:30] home
[18:31] and the Lord has been
[18:34] faithful we uh have had some real
[18:37] serious Financial struggle struggles and
[18:40] the Lord has been faithful we've had
[18:43] struggles with vehicles and the Lord has
[18:46] proven to be
[18:48] faithful I'm currently dealing with a
[18:50] situation with my
[18:52] children that I can't see a way out but
[18:55] he can and he has proven to be faithful
[18:57] amen
[18:59] we um that's right we we can try to
[19:03] figure out all these things on our own
[19:05] and we can you know go here or go there
[19:08] but if it's not his will it's not his
[19:10] what he has for us the door is going to
[19:12] continuously be closed and if that
[19:14] happens we know that we just do all that
[19:16] we can do and then we stand and just
[19:17] trust the Lord amen and every time I try
[19:21] to do something and I just don't have an
[19:22] open Avenue I just keep all right Lord
[19:25] whatever it is that you have with me and
[19:26] he has proven time and time again that
[19:28] he's faithful and brother Marty thank
[19:31] you for sharing that because I am a
[19:33] child of God and that is such a good
[19:36] thing to just remember and how wonderful
[19:39] is that we're his children he cares
[19:42] about the things that we care about amen
[19:44] so whatever you guys are going through
[19:46] right now whatever it is remain faithful
[19:49] because the Lord is faithful to us
[19:50] that's the truth amen amen praise the
[19:54] [Applause]
[19:57] Lord
[19:59] thank you sister Gabrielle um yeah all
[20:02] of us have something in our lives that
[20:05] is just very Troublesome uh I mean
[20:07] there's a lot of examples there that
[20:09] probably each and every one of us have
[20:10] had that situation and uh it's great to
[20:13] have that testimony just to rely on the
[20:15] Lord amen because he's the only one
[20:17] every time I've ever gotten involved in
[20:20] making a decision and it was only on me
[20:22] it's always failed 100% of the time I'll
[20:25] tell you um so I finally have learned
[20:28] that I can't relay on myself that's for
[20:30] sure um uh brother Orlando would you uh
[20:34] if we could just stand and uh pray for
[20:37] these requests that we uh
[20:57] spoke
[21:27] e
[21:57] heart
[22:26] are
[22:48] if uh brother Dennis could pray over the
[22:53] offering dear father to to
[23:26] chur
[23:46] amen you may be
[23:48] seated I do want to make a comment about
[23:51] the tithes and offerings that um I want
[23:53] to encourage everybody here we're all
[23:55] faced with a lot of bills every month
[23:57] and and sometimes it just seems
[23:59] overwhelming but um sister Kathleen and
[24:02] I got the Revelation about that many
[24:04] many years ago when we were first saved
[24:06] and I would encourage you to make that
[24:09] your first payment in the month before
[24:11] any of your bills even though it seems
[24:13] like you won't be able to uh do it but
[24:17] every time we did that we didn't have
[24:18] the money we didn't know where it was
[24:20] going to come from but somehow the Lord
[24:22] said prove me and uh he always did was
[24:27] through coupon or something it was just
[24:29] we found it was a way and and uh just be
[24:32] faithful and he will reward you for that
[24:34] so amen amen let's sing Sweet By and By

[32:45] each and every one of you we're very
[32:47] grateful for brother Marty just uh
[32:50] filling in just taking the Bow by the
[32:53] horns and helping um we got a call late
[32:56] from uh Brother Bruce he was on his way
[33:00] here maybe maybe about a third to a half
[33:04] of the way in and he started having uh
[33:06] car troubles and he had to turn around
[33:09] he made it home safe just after um the
[33:13] song service started and and we trust
[33:15] he's uh with us on the live stream this
[33:18] morning um I don't know if a request got
[33:20] in but let's pray for his vehicle and
[33:22] the situation God give him wisdom there
[33:25] on how to handle that I could say if uh
[33:28] of assuredly the devil did not want this
[33:31] service
[33:33] today I'm more sure of that than any
[33:36] other service I've ever attended and
[33:38] I've tended a lot to know that he is
[33:40] there but Satan is so against the
[33:43] service
[33:44] today but praise the Lord we're on The
[33:47] Winning Side amen turn with me if you
[33:50] would to the Book of Matthew chapter
[33:53] 28 we're going to read two scriptures
[33:56] one in Matthew 28 and 1 in 2 Corinthians
[34:00] chapter 5 and in both of those set of
[34:03] scriptures we're going to read three
[34:04] verses 18 through
[34:08] 20 amen well
[34:11] usually you know this is the Super
[34:16] Bowl we're all probably not not may
[34:20] maybe some of us never thought about it
[34:22] but a lot of the world has woken up
[34:25] today thinking about that and I'll say
[34:28] probably all over the world it's a
[34:30] well-known thing but today we're going

[36:25] heavenly father Lord as we approach you
[36:27] this morning there's a Thanksgiving in
[36:29] our heart this morning for all that you
[36:32] have done for us for that great
[36:34] sacrifice at Calvary Lord that today we
[36:37] could all stand here with a confidence
[36:39] and a faith knowing Lord that we are
[36:42] saved by the sacrifice that you made at
[36:45] Calvary Lord that we are trusting
[36:48] completely in your word that you cannot
[36:50] lie you've never failed and Lord by your
[36:54] grace you have shined your your spirit
[36:56] into our lives you've changed our nature
[36:59] we are in the midst of being changed
[37:01] more that's why we've come this morning
[37:02] to receive more of your Holy Spirit and
[37:05] father as we enter into this service we
[37:08] just pray that you'd forgive us of our
[37:10] trespasses our sins you cleanse us from
[37:14] anything that would be of disbelief or
[37:16] Lord that would be against the word of
[37:19] God we pray that you'd cover us with
[37:21] your blood that we could there be
[37:23] nothing standing between us and you as
[37:26] your word word would come forth and Lord
[37:28] as we'd hear these testimonies Lord may
[37:30] they just Inspire us may they just cause
[37:33] us Lord to be a greater Ambassador for
[37:36] you to work Lord to to to reach out to
[37:39] others to let them uh know Lord that uh
[37:43] what you've done for us that you can do
[37:44] for them bless each one now father we
[37:47] commit the service everything that be
[37:49] said and done for your honor into your
[37:52] hands and For Your Glory we pray in
[37:54] Jesus name amen God bless you you may be
[37:57] seated this
[38:01] morning we uh we do have a lot on the
[38:03] plate
[38:07] today but this super thank you
[38:10] sweetheart I also want to thank Ann who
[38:14] spent so much time making this um
[38:19] presentable for for us to see she's put
[38:23] together a a a a PowerPoint presentation
[38:26] for us but we want to entitle this
[38:29] message the super great commission for
[38:30] our subject a mission report for
[38:33] 2023 now we live in a very big world out
[38:37] there and there's a lot of bad things
[38:39] happening amen it is so easy to get
[38:42] caught up in the things that are
[38:44] happening in the
[38:46] world and it can cause us to be over
[38:50] involved in those things but it can also
[38:54] cause us to recline and seclude F and
[38:57] come into a shell and only think about
[38:59] oursel to protect
[39:02] ourselves I don't want to get stuck
[39:05] living for myself
[39:07] amen I don't think we completely realize
[39:10] just how important this commission is I
[39:13] believe we need to make sure that we
[39:15] catch the vision we maintain the vision
[39:18] and then we carry out what Christ has
[39:20] asked us to do Bible says where there's
[39:23] no vision the people perish we're on a
[39:26] timetable we only got so much time to
[39:28] play our role brother Marty was talking
[39:31] about uh some of us are going to go by
[39:33] the way of the grave and and some are
[39:35] going to make a rapture we don't know
[39:37] when it's all in God's hands but I'll
[39:38] say this whatever time that you have on
[39:41] this Earth you want to make sure that
[39:42] you played the role that God wanted you
[39:44] to play for his kingdom because you play
[39:46] any role for anything down here it will
[39:49] accomplish it will matter nothing on the
[39:51] other side now don't misunderstand what
[39:53] I'm saying a cup of of cold water are
[39:56] given in his name is good but you can
[39:58] spend all your time working on the
[40:00] things of this world and it won't save
[40:02] one
[40:03] soul and and and and and God is
[40:07] interested in the saving of a soul and
[40:10] the changing of a nature that it can be
[40:12] ready for the other side now that's
[40:14] where God is at that's where his heart
[40:15] is at that's where I want to be amen so
[40:18] we must carry out the role that God has
[40:20] ordained for us brother Brandon says we
[40:22] must accept our responsibility to get
[40:25] the message out that Jesus Christ is
[40:27] coming soon and I love the Simplicity of
[40:30] that message the thing that we have
[40:32] because of this message we know what
[40:34] that means it's more than just a mouth
[40:36] confession it's it's it's more than just
[40:39] getting dunked in water it's more than
[40:41] just putting your name on the book it's
[40:42] more than just saying yes I'm in the
[40:44] message no it's a change of nature to
[40:47] where all things become
[40:49] Christ my brother here had asked me uh
[40:53] some some little time ago uh what I did
[40:56] did with the mission money and that's
[40:58] kind of what prompted this whole service
[41:01] today and uh I I I I would think there
[41:04] would be uh some others here that could
[41:07] benefit that didn't maybe know what we
[41:09] did with the mission money amen amen are
[41:12] you with me am man I wonder if there' be
[41:15] anybody here who knows what we do with
[41:17] the mission money who has an idea what
[41:19] we do with the mission
[41:20] money okay all right so we got a little
[41:23] we got a little mixture our our sister
[41:25] Gabrielle made mention uh yesterday that
[41:28] she she remember that when she was a
[41:30] little child she remember we would do
[41:32] these reports at the other church and I
[41:36] have not done these on a faithful basis
[41:38] but what I have tried to do to share is
[41:41] when we do get some reports in uh that
[41:44] periodically we would show them on the
[41:46] screen and this is what's happening in
[41:47] this country and this is this brother
[41:49] but we haven't just did a full report
[41:52] and by the grace of God we wanted to do
[41:54] that but when I was when that brother
[41:56] had had asked me about that I just said
[41:59] the first thing I was thinking about is
[42:01] I I I really don't uh like to let my
[42:03] right hand know what my left hand's
[42:05] doing you know Jesus said but what thou
[42:07] do when thou doest thy alms let not thy
[42:09] left hand know what thy right hand doeth
[42:12] that thine alms may be in secret and thy
[42:15] uh and thy father which seeth in secret
[42:18] himself shall reward thee openly in
[42:21] other words it's between us and God and
[42:24] that's the way it should be but we can't
[42:27] do that with other people's
[42:29] money when somebody gives you money to
[42:31] do something with you got to keep that
[42:33] open and you got to make that sure
[42:35] that's there and so I really really
[42:37] respect that this
[42:40] morning as we provide a report for
[42:43] 2023 I want to First Express my sincere
[42:47] gratitude to each of you that have given
[42:50] for missions in support financially and
[42:53] in your prayers because no matter what
[42:56] what amount that you've given it makes a
[42:59] difference it makes a difference and
[43:02] you're giving for the saving of souls
[43:04] amen
[43:06] amen May our heavenly father bless you
[43:09] for that I believe it's important that
[43:12] we store up Treasures in
[43:14] Heaven for 2023 this
[43:18] church has given a total of $
[43:23] 7,426 for Missions
[43:29] let's take a look where your money has
[43:32] gone you want to do
[43:33] that
[43:35] amen and we're going to see a number of
[43:39] Brothers here on the board and each one
[43:41] of these
[43:43] brothers have taken time to put this
[43:47] together because I requested it and I
[43:51] want to thank them for their time that
[43:54] they did this for us
[43:56] and also uh they every each one of them
[44:01] wanted to send their uh Thanksgiving
[44:04] their appreciation to each of you for
[44:06] your prayers and for your support for
[44:09] them and they they pray for us and I I
[44:12] hope as we watch this that we'll get a a
[44:16] a a greater burden to pray for them amen
[44:20] all right I guess I am I supposed to
[44:21] start
[44:25] this
[44:27] all right oh no that's that all right

[44:35] brother to our support and um his name

[45:05] he told of a need one time we we gave
[45:10] him some money to meet that need what he
[45:12] did it he there was a some poor people
[45:15] that needed some some clothes and um uh

[45:23] he got it and he he he he shared with
[45:26] the people and this brother goes out
[45:29] numerous times a week and he just shares
[45:32] the gospel with people it's it's a it's
[45:36] been a huge blessing uh to me because
[45:40] he's never asked for
[45:42] anything it it's it's that you you you
[45:44] you catch that and it it's so he'll just
[45:47] send reports and
[45:49] so
[45:51] um and here's just a a little a little
[45:55] video of
[46:14] just just a little uh uh Taste of what's
[46:18] Happening Here in India where we at
[46:21] right over here so we're FR over here
[46:24] and he's over here
[46:26] and I just think that's wonderful to to
[46:28] support um here is a brother now I just
[46:31] if I if I can you bear with me this is
[46:34] what he said about this brother
[46:35] greetings in his precious name the Lord
[46:38] Jesus Christ Our soon coming king after
[46:41] attending a prayer meeting I was
[46:43] returning home by a walk and I saw one
[46:46] unknown person walking on the other side
[46:49] of the road with a Bible in his hand
[46:51] when I saw that person the Holy Spirit
[46:53] told me go and speak the word of God and
[46:56] I walked across the road uh Road and I
[46:58] preached God's word to him for 10
[47:01] minutes and then he started crying after
[47:03] listening to God's word I asked that
[47:06] brother why are you crying and he said
[47:08] that he had a lot of financial problems
[47:10] and he was going to commit suicide after
[47:12] listening to him I strengthened him in
[47:14] the word of God and made him stronger he
[47:16] said God has sent you to sent you to me
[47:20] to survive
[47:22] am I have explained I I had I have
[47:25] explained about water baptism acts 238
[47:28] and he come out of the denomination and
[47:31] he accepted acts 238 was baptized in the
[47:34] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we believe
[47:36] what the prophet of God said one soul is
[47:39] worth 10,000 worlds and he is believing
[47:42] the message of the hour and is standing
[47:44] for the truth in his area pray for him
[47:48] and his family and I just thought this
[47:52] is a wonderful testimony and he he he
[47:54] goes to so many many places and when I
[47:58] had inquired whether he was getting
[47:59] support he he didn't he said he wasn't
[48:01] getting support so um and I I believe
[48:04] him and I'll tell you why this right
[48:06] here uh we just you know we woke up
[48:10] uh going to say it might have been last
[48:14] Saturday I woke up and I was in prayer
[48:16] and just a burden for this man came on
[48:18] my heart and I just I went got some
[48:21] money and I sent it to him immediately I
[48:24] just knew that what the Lord wanted me
[48:26] to do and I didn't say what it was for
[48:28] or nothing I just I just wanted to
[48:30] support him because he just working for
[48:32] the lord well some about a week later uh
[48:37] or eight something like that maybe five
[48:39] days later he sends this
[48:41] picture and he bought this little sound
[48:45] system so he could go out and preach the
[48:48] gospel so he said he's going to use it
[48:50] in his and also when he goes out in both

[58:42] Ministry Lo Logistics there supporting
[58:46] him but he's also gone out and did some
[58:50] outreaches and uh visiting other
[58:52] churches and he's also worked a lot in
[58:55] his community and this is his wife
[58:58] Esther sister Esther very beautiful
[59:01] picture this is a a a motorcycle they
[59:05] were able to use to get around that is
[59:08] not fun that's for work and then uh uh
[59:13] this is just a wedding he was in here at
[59:15] one time of the year it's around the
[59:17] Easter time people just come from
[59:19] everywhere and he uses this to to reach
[59:21] out and do some Street
[59:23] meetings
[59:26] this just him him preaching in the
[59:28] church there very got a very big church
[59:32] here he is
[59:33] baptizing this is the community had
[59:37] recognized him as the one that had did
[59:41] the most for the community in that area
[59:43] and they actually gave him a reward and
[59:46] this is or an award and that's what it
[59:48] was so we're we appreciate brother
[59:50] Gideon he's sent out many bibles he's
[59:53] distributed them he's dist distributed
[59:55] food clothing Medical Care he's helped
[59:58] people with uh that needed some some
[1:00:01] tuition for some some learning so we're
[1:00:04] grateful for What the Lord Has
[1:00:07] Done uh through through brother Gideon
[1:00:10] now this here is I believe is
[1:00:15] this is
[1:00:17] this um oh this is going to be a video
[1:00:20] here so I'm not sure what this we're
[1:00:22] just okay we're we're going to go over
[1:00:24] to Mal
[1:00:26] malali Mala are you with me this is over
[1:00:29] now on the east east side of Africa so
[1:00:32] so sorry this is it's going to be right
[1:00:34] over here way down here it's a skinny
[1:00:38] little area there
[1:00:40] and um I've been working with brother
[1:00:45] um brother Jeff nodr has kind of
[1:00:48] spearheaded we sent $5,000 for Bibles in
[1:00:52] the chi chiwa language
[1:00:55] uh there and that was last year and
[1:00:59] honestly
[1:01:00] because there's been some complications
[1:01:03] with the Bibles one is they just really
[1:01:06] jacked up the prices so he didn't want
[1:01:08] to do that he wanted to look around the
[1:01:10] other they're starting to go they only
[1:01:12] have it in the IV they don't have in the
[1:01:14] King James and then they started making
[1:01:17] the IV Bible where it's not a he it's
[1:01:20] it's not a she it's not a he it's a them
[1:01:23] it's perverted so and he didn't want we
[1:01:25] don't want to buy those Bibles so we did
[1:01:27] find out that they're running they got
[1:01:30] more Bibles in just the regular NIV and
[1:01:33] I believe it's better to have the NIV
[1:01:35] than no Bible at all right can't get the
[1:01:38] King James and um so right now we're
[1:01:42] we're we're we're praying and we're g to
[1:01:46] probably do a joint effort with brother
[1:01:47] Donny Reagan and brother Ron Gilliam for
[1:01:52] 2,400 Bibles it's going to cost about3
[1:01:54] $30,000 so I want us to be in prayer for
[1:01:57] God's leadership on that because if you
[1:02:00] don't get the word into somebody's
[1:02:02] language they're not going to understand
[1:02:04] so that's the one thing about doing lots
[1:02:06] of different missions in different areas
[1:02:08] they speak different languages so you
[1:02:10] got to make sure they get the Bible in
[1:02:12] their language amen so let's remember to
[1:02:15] pray for the bride there in
[1:02:18] Mala um that's just
[1:02:21] another picture of that now this here
[1:02:24] we're going to go over to the
[1:02:26] Philippines now I'm just going to say
[1:02:29] this about the Philippines in the past
[1:02:31] we've done a lot of work in the
[1:02:34] Philippines with brother roel um this
[1:02:37] last year we did not do as much uh we
[1:02:42] worked a little bit with sister
[1:02:43] Chi-Chi's wife and uh we helped
[1:02:47] construct um some you camp quarters we
[1:02:50] sent some money for that we've sent some
[1:02:53] money uh for for for sister uh uh
[1:02:57] Chi-Chi her home it was for for leaking
[1:03:00] and had some termite situation we also
[1:03:03] sent some money um uh I'm speaking just
[1:03:06] of
[1:03:07] 2023 to help uh the needs of their
[1:03:10] Church to help the church that she
[1:03:12] attends which was um brother Ro's Church
[1:03:15] to help with that building uh we're just
[1:03:17] trying to get um to befriend the new
[1:03:20] pastor and to try to help in that
[1:03:23] Mission Outreach because brother Ro had
[1:03:25] a very special burden for Souls a very
[1:03:29] special burden he did a lot of Outreach
[1:03:32] and uh it it's it it was wonderful so in
[1:03:35] the past you know we've we helped I
[1:03:37] think maybe the year before with some
[1:03:39] victims that went through the Hurricanes
[1:03:41] there so let's just pray for the
[1:03:43] Philippines pray for our sister and pray
[1:03:45] uh that we could uh be connected to help
[1:03:49] with what God would have us to help with
[1:03:51] there all right now we're going to go
[1:03:54] these are some before and after where we
[1:03:56] helped with uh I think we did show these
[1:03:59] you know prior so this is just hurricane
[1:04:03] victims that had we put the roof back on
[1:04:05] help their buildings okay this is
[1:04:06] Brother Jason dears now we're going into
[1:04:09] the Middle East here and uh brother
[1:04:12] Jason has been very uh he's had a burden
[1:04:16] on his heart for the Middle East and so
[1:04:19] we've helped support mission trips to
[1:04:21] Turkey meetings among the Persian
[1:04:23] churches we've also supported a trip to
[1:04:25] Egypt for some special meetings we've
[1:04:29] helped further the work of putting the
[1:04:31] revelation of the spoken word into the
[1:04:33] Arabic language and he's pictured here
[1:04:36] with brother
[1:04:37] Meli uh he's a pastor that is helping
[1:04:40] with the translation work and if you
[1:04:41] remember he was sentenced to prison and
[1:04:44] his sentence was not overturned in fact
[1:04:47] it's on delay uh to be to to go up in
[1:04:51] the spring and we need to keep him up in
[1:04:54] in prayer for when that happens he he
[1:04:56] just basically went into a building
[1:04:58] before they said okay you can go in as
[1:05:00] the construction was done so it's a real
[1:05:03] small technicality it isn't like there's
[1:05:05] any problems but um you know in certain
[1:05:08] places if you don't just told the line
[1:05:11] you can get in trouble
[1:05:14] right um our church has supported the
[1:05:17] translation of of the messages how the
[1:05:20] angel came to me his commission God of
[1:05:23] this even age into the Arabic language
[1:05:27] and we've also uh helped or did the
[1:05:31] printing uh supplied the funds for the
[1:05:33] printing messages of the Rapture and
[1:05:35] birth pains so I'm thankful to be
[1:05:38] associated with the work in the Middle
[1:05:40] East amen we've heard of enough bad

[1:08:41] doing work there in Tanzania as as
[1:08:44] well um one of the larger outlays of the

[1:08:56] are simply in a humanitarian crisis
[1:09:00] where a doctor may be paid $100 a month
[1:09:03] and a teacher may earn $75 a month and

[1:10:35] older picture but um right now the war
[1:10:39] in Israel has had effect on everyone
[1:10:42] there he said that the Believers are
[1:10:45] exhausted from the war so we know how to
[1:10:47] pray they've had to deal with rockets
[1:10:50] and explosions they're always having to
[1:10:52] contend with the sound of war and their
[1:10:54] thoughts but God has kept them he said
[1:10:57] and by the grace of God they have only
[1:10:59] missed a few Sabbath
[1:11:03] meetings although they are only meeting
[1:11:06] occasionally on their midweek which is

[1:17:24] thanks amen praise the Lord I really
[1:17:27] love that he's such a precious
[1:17:31] brother yeah that that that country is a
[1:17:33] real it's a country that's filled with
[1:17:36] violence a lot of bad things have
[1:17:37] happened there and to be able to live a
[1:17:39] Godly life amongst evil is really
[1:17:42] wonderful it's beautiful
[1:17:45] amen
[1:17:47] um and is it okay to show these videos I
[1:17:50] know they're not like entertaining you
[1:17:52] know they're but their information they
[1:17:54] let you know where your money's
[1:17:56] going amen um alusma was what we set up
[1:18:01] at the very very beginning so we could
[1:18:03] make we just send the money there we
[1:18:05] know it's controlled I don't have to
[1:18:06] worry about you know the
[1:18:10] hundreds hundreds and hundreds of places
[1:18:13] it would go because I don't speak that
[1:18:16] language I don't know them but if I can
[1:18:18] just get it in the hands of somebody who
[1:18:21] will make sure it gets into the right
[1:18:23] place then God can do what he needs to
[1:18:25] do I've really tried to stay away from
[1:18:28] being
[1:18:30] controlling uh in that scenario as long
[1:18:33] as God puts it on my heart this is where
[1:18:35] it's got to go and we see the fruit of
[1:18:37] it that's all that's mattered to me now
[1:18:40] from the beginning we'd had a great bre
[1:18:42] when this was set up that the money
[1:18:44] would be used to reach new Souls into
[1:18:46] establish and that was the main thing I
[1:18:48] wanted to try to stay away as much as I
[1:18:51] could from established church churches
[1:18:53] because there's always need in churches
[1:18:54] we look at brother Stan this church is
[1:18:56] established but brother Stan is making
[1:18:58] this church better every time you come
[1:19:00] in you see construction Works been on
[1:19:02] since we've been done here and the
[1:19:04] reason I'm okay with that is when you
[1:19:05] come in I want you to believe that when
[1:19:07] you come to church you're coming under
[1:19:09] the construction of always getting
[1:19:11] better so when you see brother St
[1:19:12] working on something you see Works being
[1:19:14] done just know that we believe in
[1:19:17] continuous
[1:19:18] Improvement but uh not that we haven't
[1:19:21] helped establish churches we we've had
[1:19:24] but most of it has been starting from
[1:19:26] the beginning you send the radio uh we
[1:19:29] been doing radio broadcast since
[1:19:30] probably around 2,000 maybe even a
[1:19:32] little bit before um I'm pretty sure
[1:19:36] before we have but we got two brothers
[1:19:37] that have been with us the early uh
[1:19:40] 2000s 2003 and the radio goes out then
[1:19:44] we send uh Evangelistic ministers out
[1:19:47] there to to campaign in that area that
[1:19:49] here because you know you they when you
[1:19:51] hear on the radio
[1:19:53] you call in we here come to us they go
[1:19:58] and they get a group and they begin to
[1:20:01] evangelize there and establish and
[1:20:03] eventually they get a pastor and then
[1:20:04] you get you purchase land then you start
[1:20:06] building a church and so it's a
[1:20:09] continual work it's nothing that's done
[1:20:11] you know in three months but it's it's a
[1:20:13] vision it's a long-term vision and so
[1:20:15] that's what we've been doing there in uh
[1:20:18] the country of Honduras uh mainly but
[1:20:21] also we been in the other Central uh
[1:20:25] America countries as well so this is a
[1:20:29] one of the radio uh uh bro who just does
[1:20:32] radio broadcasting and Fact one time
[1:20:34] when I went down there and did a radio
[1:20:36] broadcast you got to be gifted to do
[1:20:38] that I mean I I when I'm when I'm
[1:20:41] talking to somebody about the Lord I
[1:20:42] want to look in their eyes you know I
[1:20:45] want I want to make sure they're paying
[1:20:46] attention to me but when you're doing a
[1:20:48] radio broadcast and you're just you know
[1:20:49] you're sitting in a room looking at
[1:20:51] somebody that doesn't understand the
[1:20:52] language that you're saying he's just
[1:20:54] you know you got an interpreter there's
[1:20:56] nothing there there's nobody to respond
[1:20:58] amen sometimes you know it's like it's
[1:21:00] here no there's no
[1:21:02] response so I had a hard time with that
[1:21:05] but you know when you're called to do a
[1:21:07] a a work on the radio you it's a special
[1:21:10] calling and this brother has
[1:21:18] it all right I'm sorry I got another
[1:21:21] one
[1:21:25] God bless you brother at this moment
[1:21:28] this is the brother Salvador Samora

[1:41:31] reason certain areas are easier than
[1:41:33] other areas Costa Rica is a harder
[1:41:36] area we're just going to come over here
[1:41:38] to Costa Rica for a
[1:41:40] second
[1:41:44] and just here just a little
[1:41:47] bit Shalom beloved Brothers we greet you
[1:41:50] you in the Glorious name of the Lord
[1:41:53] Jesus Christ with deep gratitude we
[1:41:56] report the war Carri out during
[1:41:59] 2023 in the Emanuel
[1:42:02] Tabernacle as you remember we were in
[1:42:05] the city of Gracia Costa
[1:42:07] Rica to this date we reach our
[1:42:12] 18th anniversary and during this year we
[1:42:16] have made an effort to improve the
[1:42:18] conditions of the annex bu building
[1:42:22] which we built at the end of
[1:42:25] 2019 and started using in January
[1:42:29] 20120 since then we have made partial
[1:42:32] improvements to house the ministerial
[1:42:35] offices the bookstore and the Sunday
[1:42:38] School
[1:42:39] there while the work is still in process
[1:42:43] we found a need to provide preventive
[1:42:47] maintenance on the
[1:42:49] roof because was the inclement of
[1:42:52] winters in the country in addition to
[1:42:55] investing in the electrical installation
[1:42:58] which until then we had not been able to
[1:43:02] carry
[1:43:05] out as you can see we proceed to supply
[1:43:09] electricity to the entire building is it
[1:43:13] is it just a little clip we can't do
[1:43:15] them all we just can only do a little
[1:43:17] bit but you got a taste there uh and he
[1:43:20] didn't really share his Outreach but
[1:43:22] they're reaching out they're baptizing
[1:43:24] they're getting the word out but he's
[1:43:26] been a faithful a faithful brother
[1:43:29] now this is just a piece of where your
[1:43:34] money is going for the mission field
[1:43:37] there's other places I'm sure there's
[1:43:38] other testimonies many of which I don't
[1:43:41] even know I'll be honest with you but I
[1:43:43] know on the other side we will we will
[1:43:45] find out
[1:43:47] amen now that seems to be a lot of
[1:43:49] mission work for 7,000 ,
[1:43:52] 426 don't you
[1:43:54] think remember God can take what little
[1:43:57] you give and multiply it yes I remember
[1:44:00] one year we sent a whole a whole semi
[1:44:03] full of Bibles down and um we thought we
[1:44:08] were doing good when we could buy the
[1:44:09] Bibles for like three and a half bucks
[1:44:12] but if you keep working and you got a
[1:44:15] heart for Missions you can come up with
[1:44:16] a way to save a lot of money we were
[1:44:19] able to get on a program where you could
[1:44:22] buy buy H buy one and get one free after
[1:44:25] you buy so many we were able just to set
[1:44:28] a whole semi I mean hundreds we've sent
[1:44:30] hundreds of thousands of Bibles
[1:44:32] overseas and you just got to have a
[1:44:36] heart for you know the all the semis
[1:44:38] we've done the golf outings and things
[1:44:40] of the past but um we did help some of
[1:44:45] course with this we were able to add to
[1:44:49] that 7,000 another $
[1:44:53] 78,79
[1:44:56] well brother John you probably gave out
[1:44:59] of your
[1:45:01] abundance
[1:45:02] well no I have a
[1:45:05] $360,000 mortgage I have a car payment I
[1:45:09] have monthly payments just like you I
[1:45:13] could easily use that money for myself
[1:45:15] this
[1:45:17] year brother John you must have had a
[1:45:19] good year no not necessarily we're
[1:45:22] actually L lot a lot like half that we
[1:45:26] were last
[1:45:29] year as you already know I don't believe
[1:45:32] in doing my alms before
[1:45:36] people the fact that somebody had asked
[1:45:38] me what I do with my money shows that I
[1:45:41] don't talk about much about
[1:45:43] it remember a minister came back one
[1:45:46] time after doing a missionary trip and
[1:45:48] he came and he said I have to go
[1:45:51] overseas to find out what brother John
[1:45:53] is doing in my backyard overseas because
[1:45:55] I just don't talk about
[1:45:57] it but I want to encourage you to know
[1:46:00] and also to have a scope of the
[1:46:02] missionary work that we do here the
[1:46:04] scripture says to know them that labor
[1:46:07] among you in one sense I want you to
[1:46:09] know who I am and what I do in another
[1:46:13] sense it's between me and the Lord but I
[1:46:15] believe our family has spent hundreds of
[1:46:17] thousands and I'll say this at one doubt
[1:46:20] me if it's
[1:46:21] Millions honestly millions of dollars
[1:46:24] since I've started
[1:46:27] overseas and that's not money that had
[1:46:30] come in and been given to
[1:46:34] me well brother John how did you make
[1:46:36] that happen it's real
[1:46:39] simple you are just consistent in
[1:46:44] giving just be
[1:46:46] consistent don't wait till you get a lot
[1:46:49] don't wait till you get just start
[1:46:50] giving get start with giving your time
[1:46:53] your
[1:46:54] prayer remember brother Dan daisley at
[1:46:56] the beginning he told me he says if
[1:46:58] you're going to work for the Lord you
[1:46:59] better have tough skin because the devil
[1:47:02] is going to be against it and so is
[1:47:04] everybody else amen and I tell you
[1:47:07] that's why I say the devil was against
[1:47:08] this morning he really was I heard the
[1:47:12] prophet say missionary work is always in
[1:47:14] the will of
[1:47:15] God I've invested in in a number of
[1:47:19] things I've invested in people and
[1:47:22] businesses but I'll tell you one thing
[1:47:24] the one investment that's been true has
[1:47:27] been the right investment for me has
[1:47:29] been investing in the kingdom of
[1:47:31] God I've never regretted it I believe
[1:47:35] this super Great Commission of God is
[1:47:37] always in the will of God that we should
[1:47:39] be reaching
[1:47:40] out I've had people who
[1:47:44] criticize but I also have those that
[1:47:47] encourage me as
[1:47:49] well I that people who criticize me but
[1:47:52] if the Lord be with you who can be
[1:47:54] against you that's right I've always
[1:47:56] preferred taking the back seat to others
[1:47:58] but I'll say it like this it has never
[1:48:00] stopped me from working in the back seat
[1:48:03] for the Lord amen because I'm not much
[1:48:07] I'm not anything I've to this day I
[1:48:10] don't want to be behind a Pulpit and
[1:48:12] preach it's not in my desire to stand in
[1:48:15] front of people and to talk but there's
[1:48:17] an overwhelming desire inside of me has
[1:48:20] been from the beginning to help people
[1:48:22] it's a love in my heart to help people
[1:48:26] and that's why I'm
[1:48:28] here I love working for my
[1:48:32] savior and I can't wait to meet
[1:48:36] him Amen to see him face to face do you
[1:48:39] got time if I read just a couple
[1:48:41] prophecies where this this all started

[1:50:21] thing that has always stuck with me all
[1:50:23] these years was

[1:55:17] opportunity Now you listen to me you you

[1:55:23] brother Dennis I know you believe this
[1:55:26] verely verely I say to thee be thou Not
[1:55:28] Afraid when an opportunity would come to
[1:55:31] thee to witness for me and to speak for
[1:55:33] me sayeth the Lord thy God yay for
[1:55:35] verily I say unto thee for Moses was
[1:55:39] afraid therefore I say unto thee be thou
[1:55:42] not afraid for as I was with Moses so
[1:55:45] shall I be with thee sayith the Lord thy
[1:55:46] God y verily I say unto thee that that
[1:55:49] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:55:51] ordered of the Lord and I am leading
[1:55:53] thee by my spirit yay for thou has a
[1:55:56] burden for law Souls yay and I say unto
[1:55:59] thee I will give thee Souls through the
[1:56:02] fruits of thy labor thus sayeth the Lord
[1:56:05] thy
[1:56:11] God I used
[1:56:13] to it's been years it's been a number of
[1:56:16] years that I went to Wal a game but I
[1:56:21] went one a number of times I I would
[1:56:23] take my computer and I'd be working on
[1:56:25] my uh my my my notes and I take my Bible
[1:56:29] and I'd be working on a sermon and I
[1:56:31] would sit there many times and I'd look
[1:56:33] at all these
[1:56:35] people and I would think they have no
[1:56:40] Shepherd amen they have no Shepherd and
[1:56:44] I be it would just it would just burden
[1:56:46] me and I'd cry about it and and and what
[1:56:50] I've learned is that people don't want a
[1:56:55] Shepherd they don't want somebody
[1:56:58] watching over their soul they want
[1:57:00] somebody for what they can get from them
[1:57:03] naturally what they could get when they
[1:57:05] help me with this help me with that but
[1:57:07] that that is not the call of a
[1:57:11] Shepherd it's
[1:57:15] not
[1:57:16] just but you have to take care of those
[1:57:20] things as well but
[1:57:22] notice it's about
[1:57:25] souls it's not just getting somebody
[1:57:28] saved it's getting them to the nature of
[1:57:30] Christ which takes a lot of
[1:57:33] cooperation now you know tithes and
[1:57:35] offerings are part of every service we
[1:57:37] come and we pray over the offerings and
[1:57:40] I think we just kind of get through that
[1:57:41] real
[1:57:42] quick I think we should really really
[1:57:44] put our heart to the mission field now
[1:57:48] I'm not here to say you need to get give
[1:57:50] more than you're given I'm not I'll be
[1:57:52] honest if nobody gave anything I know
[1:57:54] what I'm doing next year I know what I'm
[1:57:56] doing the year after if God would te I
[1:57:58] know where I'm going I know what God
[1:58:00] wants me to do as brother Bruth was
[1:58:02] talking about finding your place in the
[1:58:04] scriptures I found my place in the
[1:58:06] scriptures but I want to inspire you
[1:58:08] because I do believe that some of you
[1:58:10] are ignoring the things that God wants
[1:58:12] you to
[1:58:15] do so I think when we take up an
[1:58:18] offering we should really really be
[1:58:20] sincere and pray over
[1:58:22] that and some of you might know I've
[1:58:25] never taken anything out of the ties and
[1:58:28] offerings for
[1:58:29] myself or my
[1:58:32] family it's the god truth I never have
[1:58:36] when I would go and preach in another
[1:58:38] church they' give me an offering I'd say
[1:58:41] no but if they made me take it I'd put
[1:58:43] it right back into the missions I've
[1:58:46] never used a penny from the people if I
[1:58:49] can just say this I have been here for
[1:58:52] one reason and that's to serve you Amen
[1:58:55] to serve your
[1:58:56] family to help you to help you make a
[1:59:00] Rapture to get to the other side as the
[1:59:02] prophet
[1:59:03] said the scripture says to watch over
[1:59:06] your soul and to be an example of what
[1:59:09] it really means somebody has to take the
[1:59:12] oversight make sure no evil spirits
[1:59:15] deceptive Spirits get behind the pulpit
[1:59:17] somebody's got to do that
[1:59:21] Amen to be an example of what it really
[1:59:24] means to live for
[1:59:25] others I've been here for
[1:59:32] you God's given me the ability to work
[1:59:36] and you know if anybody's ever worked
[1:59:38] with me you know I like to
[1:59:41] work I love to
[1:59:45] work I'm thankful that you know there
[1:59:48] are people that don't have their legs or
[1:59:49] arms they can't do things you know what
[1:59:51] I mean I'm just grateful that I still
[1:59:53] have them I want to keep going as long
[1:59:56] as I can now you just bear with me okay
[1:59:59] we're almost done can you is that okay
[2:00:03] thank you brother BR said in the message
[2:00:04] the my life story he says now I've I I
[2:00:08] never took up I tried to take up an
[2:00:10] offering in my life I and I failed on
[2:00:13] that but I I never would let me do it I
[2:00:18] never wouldn't let me do it I worked and
[2:00:20] I pastured the brandham Tabernacle in
[2:00:22] Jeffersonville which is a inter
[2:00:24] denominational institution I worked
[2:00:26] every day sometimes with a pack and a
[2:00:28] shovel a pick and a shovel sometimes a
[2:00:31] patrol sometimes in the line work and so
[2:00:33] forth worked 12 years in Pastor a church
[2:00:35] and never received one penny not one
[2:00:38] cent
[2:00:40] now what I chose to do never had
[2:00:42] anything to do I just got this quote
[2:00:44] honestly about uh about about a week ago
[2:00:47] this quote
[2:00:49] but it's between you know people that
[2:00:53] I'm going to say this your ties go to
[2:00:54] the ministry your ties that's what the
[2:00:56] prophet taught that's what it should do
[2:00:58] you should pay your
[2:01:00] tie you should give offerings to make
[2:01:02] sure the light stay on you should get a
[2:01:04] burden for souls for the mission field
[2:01:06] because there's people overseas that are
[2:01:08] are searching they given their life
[2:01:10] searching for the for the seed
[2:01:15] amen now he says not not as I got
[2:01:18] anything against against
[2:01:20] anyone a minister he's he's to live by
[2:01:23] the gospel but I was young and I was
[2:01:25] healthy why shouldn't I work and not to
[2:01:27] be obligated to the people that's just
[2:01:29] how I
[2:01:30] feel not because that there wouldn't be
[2:01:33] there wouldn't do it they would they
[2:01:35] would be glad to do it but I just felt
[2:01:38] like if the rest of them worked then I'd
[2:01:42] work also so I worked and paid my ties
[2:01:45] right at the church I believed in paying
[2:01:47] ties and God is has blessed it to me
[2:01:51] millions of times and I never would take
[2:01:56] up offerings I told you believe the
[2:01:58] other day how I tried to take up my
[2:02:00] first offering wife and I would get a
[2:02:03] tough spot where we couldn't make the
[2:02:05] ends meet many of you know what I'm
[2:02:07] talking about so I told her I said well
[2:02:09] I'm just going to take up an offering
[2:02:11] over at the church and she said well I'm
[2:02:14] going to come over and watch you do that
[2:02:18] and she sat down in the back a a little
[2:02:20] piece from me a little piece from me the
[2:02:23] way they talk back then and all the time
[2:02:25] my heart was failing I just kept talking
[2:02:28] around different things directly I said
[2:02:30] oh I forgot I said I I got to take up an
[2:02:34] offering tonight for myself I said I
[2:02:36] hate to ask but I just got in a snag and
[2:02:39] I got to get through and I looked around
[2:02:41] and blessed their hearts I knew some of
[2:02:44] them that are in here here this
[2:02:46] afternoon were there and I I have
[2:02:48] happened to look and sitting to my right
[2:02:50] and a little old mother uh was wearing a
[2:02:53] little old gingham I guess and whatever
[2:02:57] kind of clothes I don't know nothing
[2:02:58] about the goods that women wear so the
[2:03:00] little old dresses on and you know the
[2:03:03] little pockets beneath her apron and she
[2:03:05] went down there like that like Grandma
[2:03:07] used to have and she uh brought out one
[2:03:10] of them little old pocket books you know
[2:03:13] that you snap over the top and she was
[2:03:15] reaching down uh after those nickels and
[2:03:18] I looked around and I thought oh
[2:03:21] my that would haunt me as long as I
[2:03:25] lived if I took that I just couldn't do
[2:03:27] it the Deacon then went and he got my
[2:03:30] hat and was going to pass the hat and I
[2:03:33] I looked at that and my I felt a big
[2:03:36] lump come
[2:03:37] up and I said well I said now look I was
[2:03:42] just teasing you but I really didn't
[2:03:45] mean that I just wanted to see what you
[2:03:48] would say
[2:03:50] he just couldn't do it and my wife
[2:03:53] looked at me I just I just when I'm
[2:03:55] reading this I'm thinking just like when
[2:03:57] Jesus looked at Peter when he denied him
[2:03:59] you know like I knew and we really had
[2:04:02] an obligation that had to be met but you
[2:04:05] know what I had an old bicycle over home
[2:04:08] and I went and sold that old bicycle and
[2:04:10] went and and we got uh we got to meet
[2:04:13] the that obligation didn't have to take
[2:04:16] up an offering after all so I never want
[2:04:19] myself tied to any Earthly thing I Want
[2:04:22] to Be Free where I can study the word of
[2:04:25] God amen amen amen God loves a cheerful
[2:04:31] Giver amen he loves a cheerful Giver uh
[2:04:36] it's been my greatest honor to serve the
[2:04:38] Lord amen most of which is just not done
[2:04:42] here honestly we all can be working for
[2:04:45] the Lord more than just the little time
[2:04:47] that we're here at the church don't you
[2:04:49] believe that I want to read a scripture
[2:04:51] here in 1 Corinthians
[2:04:54] 15:57 and
[2:04:56] 58 we're closing it up here but thanks
[2:04:59] be to God which giveth us the victory
[2:05:02] through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore
[2:05:05] my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast
[2:05:10] unmovable always abounding in the work
[2:05:13] of the Lord for as much as you know that
[2:05:16] your labor is not in vain in the
[2:05:20] Lord I mean when you read the Bible
[2:05:24] you've got to believe that that
[2:05:26] scripture is speaking to you you don't
[2:05:29] want to read the Bible like some Ouija
[2:05:31] board you don't want to read the Bible
[2:05:34] like oh maybe there's only three
[2:05:35] scriptures are for me you got to fall in
[2:05:37] love with that word fall in love with
[2:05:39] the whole word man shall live by every
[2:05:42] word of God I'm grateful all these years
[2:05:45] to know that trusted tool really belongs
[2:05:50] to God Amen he just he had me be just a
[2:05:55] little Steward over it and you know he
[2:05:58] just said one thing to me occupy till I
[2:06:01] come occupy so by the grace of God
[2:06:04] that's what I've been doing with all my
[2:06:06] money for my money outside of the money
[2:06:10] that you see over there and the money
[2:06:13] that I'm going to have to work more to
[2:06:14] pay off the mortgage you know what I'm
[2:06:16] trying to say but every year it's been
[2:06:18] able to support God's missionaries and
[2:06:20] it's been a great honor for us the last
[2:06:23] scripture I want to give you is in
[2:06:25] Hebrews chapter 6 verse 9 if you want to
[2:06:27] stand Hebrews chapter 6:9 but beloved we
[2:06:31] are persuaded better things of you and
[2:06:36] the things that accompany salvation
[2:06:39] though we thus speak for God is Not
[2:06:42] unrighteous to forget your work and
[2:06:45] labor of love which you have showed
[2:06:48] towards his name in that ye have
[2:06:50] ministered to the Saints and do Minister
[2:06:53] and we desire now here it is that every
[2:06:57] one of you do show the same diligence to
[2:07:02] the full Assurance of Hope on to the end
[2:07:07] and that you be
[2:07:09] not verse 12 that ye be not
[2:07:14] slothful but
[2:07:16] followers of them who through faith and
[2:07:20] patience inherit the promises
[2:07:24] amen I
[2:07:27] trust that you've been
[2:07:31] encouraged
[2:07:34] inspired to give more to the
[2:07:40] Lord I would never ask you to give money
[2:07:42] but I am asking you to give your life
[2:07:44] God will take care of the rest let's
[2:07:46] labor in prayer let's labor in love
