[11:27] well I'll just change the word service
[11:29] here amen
[11:30] just a few requesters so let's just
[11:33] remember all those that aren't here that
[11:37] he might be home with you know some kind
[11:39] of thing that's keeping them from here
[11:43] whether it's an immune system or
[11:45] whatever it would be here and that the
[11:48] Lord would just saw first of all calm
[11:49] their spirits and give them clarity of
[11:52] mind and of spirit amen
[11:55] and that we can just believe by faith
[11:59] that we'll see them all soon a mountain
[12:02] and because you know we all know that no
[12:06] further longer you stay away you know
[12:09] candles can start getting a little dim
[12:13] so just just hold them all up in prayer
[12:16] and we got a four-door fire itself in
[12:19] the Lord amen and I think this is really
[12:21] when the tree starts to shake
[12:24] you gotta got to know your roots are
[12:26] deep
[12:27] so let's just pray for all those that
[12:32] aren't here amen
[12:33] it's also pray for the country and just
[12:37] the direction that everything's going is
[12:40] so chaotic and so what today's norm is
[12:44] is not tomorrow's and there's you don't
[12:46] know whose truth or not you know but one
[12:51] thing we can't see no no that's the Word
[12:53] of God so I truly believe at the end
[12:56] times that we're living in that you know
[12:59] God hold the God's unchanging hand
[13:02] because everything else is changing so
[13:07] pray for that and lead people to that
[13:10] because people need that that's why we
[13:12] got all that's what's going on out there
[13:14] right now it's just there's so much
[13:16] uncertainty no place nobody everybody's
[13:19] leaning in their own understanding it is
[13:22] so chaotic it's unreal so lead them to
[13:26] Jesus amen
[13:28] I'd scream mber my neighbor his name's

[14:21] has CA let her have a revelation of the
[14:26] importance of her faith in Him

[14:45] was told to us until you have that
[14:48] personal revelation yourself it doesn't
[14:51] you know somebody can talk into somebody
[14:54] can talk you out of it but when it's
[14:56] revealed to you then you know it'll hold

[33:28] because we love the Word of God above
[33:30] everything amen
[33:32] we'll turn with me if you would to the
[33:34] book of Saint Luke if you have a Bible
[33:40] it's always good to be with God's people
[33:44] amen Saint Luke chapter two we're going
[33:50] to begin reading with verse number eight
[33:55] through 14 then we'll have a word of
[33:58] Prayer but this is this is where the
[34:02] Angels introduced the Lord Jesus as a
[34:09] baby amen
[34:11] starting here with verse number eight
[34:13] and there were in the same country
[34:15] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[34:18] watch over their flock by night and lo
[34:22] the angel of the Lord came upon them and
[34:25] the glory of the Lord shone round about
[34:27] them and they were sore afraid and the
[34:31] angel said unto them fear not for behold
[34:33] I bring you good tidings of great joy
[34:36] which shall be to all people for unto
[34:40] you Is Born This Day in the City of
[34:42] David a savior which is Christ the Lord
[34:45] and this shall be a sign unto you he ye
[34:49] shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling
[34:50] clothes lying in the manger and suddenly
[34:53] there was with the angel a multitude of
[34:57] heavenly hosts praising God and saying
[34:59] glory to God in the highest and on earth
[35:03] peace and goodwill toward men amen let's
[35:07] just pray and ask God to bless this
[35:10] precious word to a seventy Father Lord
[35:12] were not even worthy to read your holy
[35:16] word it is the only book Lord that is
[35:20] perfectly true that we can have
[35:22] confidence in above every other book
[35:25] that's been written and Lord you've
[35:28] given us your word that we might have a
[35:31] roadmap how to get to heaven how to make
[35:34] sure that we be found pleasing in your
[35:37] sight and Lord we ask that you would
[35:40] take this scripture that we read Lord
[35:43] the scriptures that we will read
[35:45] Hereafter and Lord that you wouldn't
[35:47] reveal them to us and anoint them to us
[35:50] and help us to catch the meaning of the
[35:53] message that you have for us tonight for
[35:55] we
[35:55] desire in a heart to know you in a
[35:59] greater way Lord we commit this service
[36:02] and all of our hearts into your hands
[36:06] now come receive glory through
[36:09] everything that's said and done we pray
[36:11] in Jesus Christ precious name Amen amen
[36:14] god bless you may be seated
[36:19] usually this scripture would be taken at
[36:23] a Christmas time and rightly sold but
[36:29] today we want to take our text from
[36:31] verse 11 for unto you Is Born This Day
[36:35] in the City of David a savior which is
[36:38] Christ the Lord and we want to take for
[36:42] a subject today dividing Jesus in half
[36:46] to better understand our relationship
[36:49] with him we want entitle this message
[36:52] Savior or Lord and it's something maybe
[37:01] we we wouldn't want to do is divide
[37:04] Jesus in half but we want to to better
[37:09] understand our relationship with him
[37:13] jesus said in little further in this
[37:16] book in Luke chapter 6 verse 46 jesus
[37:20] said these words he said why call me
[37:23] Lord Lord and do not the things which I
[37:27] say so as we split Jesus right down the
[37:33] middle I want to talk about the two
[37:35] different relationships that we can have
[37:37] with Jesus most people know Jesus as a
[37:41] savior that no end they know them as a
[37:44] savior a savior is someone who rescues
[37:46] another from danger so whether we're
[37:49] rescuing a soul or we're getting rescued
[37:54] from losing our job or our home or our
[37:58] health or finances or a marriage or an
[38:01] accident
[38:02] we mostly know Jesus as someone who
[38:06] rescues us or saves us from
[38:08] really just a it seems like a manifold
[38:12] situations in her life a number of
[38:15] problems that were having we need a
[38:17] savior we need someone that will rescue
[38:19] us and help us with our situation and
[38:22] this is in really where most people know
[38:25] Jesus as a savior Jesus is good to all
[38:30] men Psalms 145 verse 9 says the Lord is
[38:34] good to all not just to some but to all
[38:39] Acts chapter 10 verse 34 says that God
[38:42] is no respecter person so he doesn't
[38:45] respect one person he you know he's not
[38:47] racist he's no respecter persons that
[38:53] James chapter 1 verse 5 the Bible says
[38:57] if any man if any of you lack wisdom let
[39:00] him ask of God that giveth to all men
[39:02] liberally and upbraideth not and it
[39:06] shall be given him so God even gives out
[39:08] wisdom to those that just ask you got
[39:11] asking faith of course but but but
[39:14] that's the type of God he is that's the
[39:16] type of Savior he wants to to rescue and
[39:18] how Matthew chapter 7 verse 7 Jesus
[39:23] saying ask and it shall be given you
[39:25] seek and you shall find knock and it
[39:27] shall be opened unto you for every one
[39:29] that asketh receiveth and he that
[39:32] seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh
[39:34] it shall be opened Amen it's a promise
[39:39] that the Savior gives us most of our
[39:43] relationship with Christ is centered on
[39:45] the side of Christ who provides for us
[39:49] or who rescues us from so many problems
[39:52] in our life we know God in that way the
[39:58] Bible records many times people that
[40:03] Jesus had rescued them there were two
[40:06] thief's on the cross one asked and he
[40:10] received
[40:12] Jesus rescued him because he was asking
[40:15] remember me when you come into your
[40:19] kingdom the other just kind of mocked
[40:23] had a negative attitude the very last
[40:27] moment of his his life since he wasn't
[40:33] humble since he didn't believe he wasn't
[40:37] rescued so he never even got to know
[40:40] Jesus as the Savior there was a Greek
[40:45] Cyrille Phoenician woman she had a young
[40:47] daughter that was grievously mixed vexed
[40:50] by a devil and she cried Oh have mercy
[40:53] on me O Lord thou son of David
[40:56] but Jesus the Bible says did not answer
[40:59] her a word kind of a ignored he might
[41:03] say that Jesus was rude to her somebody
[41:09] don't answer you you think they're being
[41:10] rude and even the disciples were trying
[41:15] to tell Jesus would you just send her
[41:17] away so they were being rude it was a
[41:20] real confusing situation in church that
[41:25] day in Matthew 15 verse 24 but he
[41:31] answered and said I am NOT sent but unto
[41:34] the lost sheep of the house of Israel
[41:37] can you imagine Jesus coming and saying
[41:39] I am not sent to you that's basically
[41:44] there was no hope he did not provide a
[41:48] hope for this woman but you know what it
[41:53] did turn her off the very next verse she
[41:56] came and worshiped him saying lord help
[41:59] me I need to be rescued amen and then
[42:04] Mark sat in chapter 7 I'm taking this
[42:07] from two different Gospels here chapter
[42:12] 7 verse number 27 but jesus said unto
[42:14] her let the children first be filled for
[42:19] it's not meet to take the children's
[42:21] bread and to cast it unto dogs
[42:25] oh my mind if that didn't offend her you
[42:31] know some people you know we can come to
[42:33] church robbing guilty of this another no
[42:36] not our visitors this is not to our
[42:37] visitors what I'm saying this is
[42:40] everybody else we've come to church and
[42:43] we hear something that just wasn't right
[42:45] and we can get offended by we need to
[42:53] have we need to learn from this woman of
[42:56] what pleased God in verse 28 and she
[43:01] answered and said unto her yes Lord yet
[43:04] the dogs under the table eat the
[43:07] children's cross in other words they
[43:12] didn't come right from Jesus but from
[43:15] his people
[43:19] that's pretty humbling and he said unto
[43:23] her in verse 29 for this saying now this
[43:27] is what I underlined that for this
[43:29] saying it was for what she said the
[43:31] attitude that she had go my way the
[43:36] devil is gone out of my daughter
[43:40] Jesus rescued a mother's daughter from a
[43:47] devil sickness there was a woman with a
[43:51] blood issue she was rescued she tried
[43:56] everybody else to rescue her lots of
[43:58] doctors could not get rescued but she
[44:00] tried Jesus and Jesus was the answer and
[44:05] he Jesus loves to help us no matter what
[44:09] her situation is not to be a little ones
[44:11] situation because God loves to help
[44:16] there was a Centurion that besieged
[44:19] Jesus one time for one of his servants
[44:22] have had palsy and Jesus was willing to
[44:25] come to his house and pray and rescue
[44:31] but he said no I'm not worthy I'm not
[44:35] worthy that you should come under my
[44:36] roof but if you just speak the
[44:40] my servant shall be healed and the seer
[44:45] Tyrion understood how authority works
[44:48] and this is important he himself did not
[44:51] have faith to heal the servant but he
[44:57] had faith in someone that was authority
[45:00] over the devil and that that's important
[45:04] and in verse 9 of Matthew chapter 8
[45:07] verse 9 he says from a man under
[45:10] Authority having soldiers under me and I
[45:12] say to this man go and he goeth into
[45:13] this man come and he cometh and to my
[45:16] servant do this and he do with it and
[45:17] when Jesus heard he marveled and said to
[45:20] them that followed verily I say to you
[45:22] I've not found so great faith no not in
[45:25] Israel it wasn't his faith that he could
[45:29] do it it was his faith that Jesus could
[45:33] do it our faith needs to be in Jesus
[45:36] amen one time there were 10 lepers and
[45:39] Jesus rescued all of them no respecter
[45:43] persons but there was only one that came
[45:46] back and he wanted to work on his
[45:48] relationship we want to get into that
[45:58] Jesus said in mark chapter 9 and we know
[46:01] there's a lot of Scripture we don't have
[46:03] to go go to them but I want to at least
[46:06] quote some of them if thou canst believe
[46:08] all things are possible to him that
[46:11] believeth he's no respecter of persons I
[46:16] ask and it shall be given God is good to
[46:20] everyone he's gracious he's merciful
[46:24] he's no respecter persons God will
[46:27] rescue even his enemies just like you
[46:31] guys you and me he loves his enemies he
[46:35] blesses them that curse him he does good
[46:39] to them that hate him and he is
[46:44] long-suffering towards them which
[46:46] despitefully use him and persecute him
[46:52] to those that take the name of the Lord
[46:54] in vain right that's the truth he maketh
[46:59] the Sun to rise on the evil and on the
[47:01] good he sends rain on the just and the
[47:03] unjust that is what our God is it's his
[47:09] character it's just who he is he loves
[47:12] to help if he could do that for his
[47:17] enemy we should really believe he wants
[47:20] to do that for us his children amen he
[47:26] would that all men would be saved the
[47:27] Bible says God can save us and rescue us
[47:34] from a multitude of situations in her
[47:36] life he's awesome we can testify of his
[47:40] amazing grace his saving grace of his
[47:42] faithfulness and still never know him as
[47:47] Lord and this is what I wanted to buy
[47:51] him today into to do from the house
[47:53] because so often we just kind of want to
[47:56] put him together and think they're the
[47:58] same awful quiet if we don't know him as
[48:10] Lord furthermore he will never know us
[48:13] as his Lord I'm going to say some things
[48:18] obviously maybe haven't heard of but I
[48:21] want you to I want you to think I want
[48:23] to provoke your relationship with Christ
[48:25] that's what we're doing here it's one
[48:28] thing to know Christ as a savior as a
[48:30] healer as a provider but it's totally
[48:33] different to know him as Lord you can
[48:37] know the saving grace of God and never
[48:39] come to know the side of Christ is Lord
[48:43] unto us is born unto us was born 2,000
[48:48] years ago a savior which is Christ the
[48:56] Lord
[48:57] but we got to come to know him as Lord
[49:00] that word Lord means supreme in
[49:03] authority
[49:05] it means controller it means master and
[49:10] we're talking about our relationship
[49:13] with him we know as according to
[49:18] Philippians chapter 2 verse 9 the Bible
[49:21] says wherefore God also have highly
[49:24] exalted him and given him a name which
[49:28] is above every name and that at the name
[49:31] of Jesus every knee should bow of things
[49:37] in heaven and things in earth and things
[49:39] under the earth and that every tongue
[49:42] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[49:46] to the glory of God the Father now Jesus
[49:53] Christ is Savior Jesus Christ is Lord
[50:00] the world can choose to ignore today the
[50:03] Ault but ultimately God will make sure
[50:06] to it that every knee is going to bow
[50:10] humbly reverently to Jesus and that
[50:14] every mouth will acknowledge what admit
[50:17] will agree Foley that's what it means to
[50:20] confess or profess that Jesus isn't
[50:23] Savior but he's Lord he's the supreme
[50:28] authority to the glory of God the Father
[50:33] before they go to hell
[50:38] what a privilege we have today to bow
[50:41] before him and call him Lord of lords
[50:43] and King of Kings willingly but the
[50:47] majority of the people will never
[50:48] experience that side of Jesus in fact
[50:53] very few will because Lord has
[50:56] everything to do with surrender
[50:58] your will to his that's what we want to
[51:03] get into the Lord has everything to do
[51:05] with your unconditional surrender to his
[51:09] will your desire is no longer for what
[51:13] you want the Lord is my shepherd I shall
[51:15] not want amen you have forfeited your
[51:19] wants and your desires is to you to you
[51:22] to heal completely to God's will
[51:25] your will is no longer on the forefront
[51:28] of your plans just like Jesus said not
[51:31] my will but thine be done you have
[51:34] forfeited your will and now your will is
[51:38] to achieve God's will as a subject to
[51:46] your Lord you're subject to your Lord
[51:50] you simply present yourself to the
[51:54] complete domain over you this is a
[51:57] totally different part of a relationship
[52:01] with Christ then God dealing with us
[52:05] with all the things that we want him to
[52:07] rescue in our life and I felt strong
[52:13] about this message for the aspect of us
[52:16] being able to understand the difference
[52:18] because so often when we see Jesus moved
[52:21] so graciously in her life and meet our
[52:24] needs we can't deny him amongst us but
[52:29] it has nothing to do necessarily with
[52:32] where our relationship is with God and
[52:36] as the Bride of Christ our relations he
[52:40] has to become Lord of our lives as
[52:44] foolish virgin no I don't have to but as
[52:51] bride he has to that's important so Paul
[52:57] was teaching lordship in in Romans
[53:02] chapter 12 verse 1 and 2 when he said I
[53:05] beseech you therefore brethren by the
[53:07] mercies of God that you present yourself
[53:12] your bodies a living sacrifice holy and
[53:17] acceptable unto God which is your
[53:20] reasonable service if somebody I went to
[53:25] work and they told me I want you just to
[53:27] present yourself just you just give your
[53:31] all and I don't want you taking the
[53:33] breaks now you just I want you to do
[53:35] exactly what I say don't make any
[53:37] mistakes and that your reasonable
[53:38] service and all I don't work here but
[53:44] Paul is calling this calling this a
[53:47] reasonable service and be not conformed
[53:50] to this world but be transformed by the
[53:53] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[53:55] what is that good and acceptable and
[53:58] perfect will of God now I'm not talking
[54:08] about what job you should take what car
[54:13] you should buy or what vacation you
[54:15] should go on I'm talking about giving
[54:20] yourself completely over to his will
[54:23] that you must prove that it's your
[54:28] reasonable service I'm talking about how
[54:32] you live your life out how you how you
[54:36] present yourself to be transformed into
[54:40] God's will we need to be able to prove
[54:47] it too often we we spend time proving
[54:53] things that is just God being good to us
[54:58] and gracious to us and and providing for
[55:03] us but I'm not really interested in you
[55:10] proving that it was God's will for you
[55:15] to have the house that you're in
[55:18] for the car that you drive for the job
[55:20] you're at for the boat you bought I'm
[55:24] interested in you proving how to live
[55:27] your life completely to the will of God
[55:30] because I got scripture for that I don't
[55:33] got scripture for the car you want let's
[55:39] take an example of this in 1st Peter
[55:41] chapter 2 and we're just going to talk
[55:43] about what's acceptable to God first so
[55:46] it is the will of God that with well
[55:48] doing you put to silence the ignorance
[55:50] of foolish men as free not using your
[55:54] liberty as a cloak for maliciousness but
[55:56] as servants of God honor all men don't
[56:00] pick and choose love the Brotherhood
[56:02] fear God honor the King servants be
[56:06] subject to your masters with all fear
[56:09] Wow this is this is not a gift this
[56:14] takes the dying of your own will not
[56:18] only to the good and gentle but to also
[56:20] the froward for this is thank worthy if
[56:23] a man for conscious towards God now this
[56:25] is all about your your consciousness
[56:27] towards God your relationship with God
[56:30] if a man for conscience toward God
[56:34] endured grief suffering wrongfully for
[56:38] what good is it when you're buffeted for
[56:41] your own faults and you take it
[56:42] patiently but if when you do well and
[56:45] you suffer for it take it patiently this
[56:47] is acceptable with God so you're proving
[56:52] what is that good and acceptable and
[56:55] perfect will of God
[56:56] I've got scripture here this is what I
[56:58] want you to prove I want you to prove to
[57:01] me this because this has to do with
[57:06] lordship not Savior you can rescue some
[57:12] you all the rescuing that God has done
[57:18] it's him and His goodness
[57:22] doing it but when you do this you're
[57:29] letting him use your life to prove out
[57:32] to who's ever watching that God gets all
[57:36] the glory
[57:42] see it's normal to prove someone's wrong
[57:45] when they're wrong right but don't be
[57:48] conformed to the world that's the way
[57:52] the world does it but be transformed by
[57:55] the renewing of your mind that you may
[57:56] prove what is the good and acceptable
[57:59] and perfect will of God
[58:01] it's not about buying the right boat for
[58:04] your life it's about you yielding your
[58:08] will to God's control for even unto here
[58:14] where you called look at verse 21
[58:16] because Christ also suffered for us
[58:19] leaving us an example that we should
[58:21] follow his steps God is not interested
[58:24] in seeing us suffer but the only way
[58:29] that character can be developed is if
[58:32] we're willing to suffer because
[58:36] character is not a gift it's a victory
[58:40] Matthew chapter 7 verse 21 not everyone
[58:44] that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter
[58:48] into the kingdom of heaven but he that
[58:52] doeth the will of my father which is
[58:54] neversea lordship comes with giving God
[59:00] pre-eminence let them have freedom as he
[59:03] has domain his will is first notice
[59:07] they're not saying Savior or rescuer
[59:12] they're saying Lord many will say to me
[59:18] in that day Lord Lord have we not
[59:21] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[59:24] cast out devils and in thy name done
[59:25] many wonderful works many had access to
[59:30] the name of Jesus he is a provider a
[59:33] rescuer
[59:34] revealer to many believers his name is
[59:37] used to cast out devils his name is is
[59:41] used to talk about the future to
[59:43] prophesy the future but it has nothing
[59:48] to do with the relationship it has
[59:50] nothing to do with the part of Christ
[59:53] that's Lord and too many people want to
[59:57] claim Lord just because God used them in
[1:00:01] and provided for him and met their needs
[1:00:03] on the Savior side and then why profess
[1:00:11] unto them I never knew you relationship
[1:00:18] Lord Lord is about relationship when it
[1:00:22] comes down to the end of the road doing
[1:00:25] all of his will is the only thing that
[1:00:28] will matter the works
[1:00:35] think about all think about the children
[1:00:39] of Israel that died in the wilderness
[1:00:42] because Jesus himself said they all died
[1:00:45] in the wilderness right when they when
[1:00:49] they were saying they are our fathers
[1:00:52] eight men in the in the wilderness and
[1:00:54] Jesus said there everyone dead so at the
[1:00:58] end of the road what was important not
[1:01:00] forty years God provided for them saved
[1:01:04] them from the snakes and you know gaper
[1:01:07] gave them water and and and their shoes
[1:01:10] and wear out that didn't matter the and
[1:01:13] what mattered at the end is did they do
[1:01:15] the will fulfilling only part of God's
[1:01:22] will come short of lordship
[1:01:28] so this calling about lordship is it's a
[1:01:32] high calling it's not easy
[1:01:36] we should all be struggling to fulfill
[1:01:39] it
[1:01:39] [Music]
[1:01:41] the way I read the scriptures there's
[1:01:44] still things I'm struggling with every
[1:01:47] day in my life if I ignore those things
[1:01:51] right well I think I'm a pretty good
[1:01:54] Joel but when I realized that I need to
[1:02:01] do all of God's will
[1:02:03] I've got dying out to do
[1:02:05] I got surrendering to - I have no no no
[1:02:10] no authority to call him Lord
[1:02:15] maybe Savior lord help me with the
[1:02:18] situation but he's calling us to a
[1:02:21] lordship relationship where he can have
[1:02:24] dominion over us and what a privilege it
[1:02:30] is verse 24 therefore whoever we hear at
[1:02:34] these sayings of mine and doeth them I
[1:02:36] will liken unto him waking on I will
[1:02:39] liken him unto a wise man which built
[1:02:42] his house upon the rock so I'll say it
[1:02:47] like this the more that you do what God
[1:02:49] tells you to do the more of a rock
[1:02:52] you're building your relationship with
[1:02:56] Christ with don't look at the things
[1:03:03] that you're already doing
[1:03:06] if you want a bill you have to look at
[1:03:09] the things you're not doing the rain
[1:03:16] descended the floods came the winds blew
[1:03:18] and beat upon the house and it fell not
[1:03:21] for it was founded upon a rock hey men
[1:03:26] well there was a lot of winds today
[1:03:29] wasn't there and every one that heareth
[1:03:32] these sayings of mine and doeth them not
[1:03:34] shall be likened unto a foolish man
[1:03:35] which built his house upon the sand the
[1:03:37] rains descend the floods came and the
[1:03:39] winds blew and beat upon the house and
[1:03:40] it fell and great was the fall event
[1:03:43] I'll just say it like this it's not a
[1:03:45] matter of whether we know what's right
[1:03:49] or wrong in tough situations that go on
[1:03:54] in our life what is necessary is that if
[1:04:00] you stand for Christ he'll stand for you
[1:04:05] if you're willing to suffer wrongfully
[1:04:09] this is acceptable to God
[1:04:11] it's your reasonable service so it's
[1:04:15] like you're building your relationship
[1:04:17] with God that's the rock it isn't like
[1:04:23] nothing's gonna happen to us no things
[1:04:26] are gonna happen to us bad things are
[1:04:28] gonna happen but we need Christ there
[1:04:32] yeah when we're all when we are born
[1:04:39] again we are born to do God's will that
[1:04:43] we probably heard that thousands of
[1:04:44] times but we're really born to manifest
[1:04:51] his will
[1:04:56] John 1:11 says he came to his own and
[1:04:59] his own received him not but as many as
[1:05:02] received and to then gave he power to
[1:05:04] become sons of God even to them that
[1:05:06] believe on his name so we have to
[1:05:08] receive him receive the word which were
[1:05:13] born not of blood nor the will of the
[1:05:16] flesh nor of the will man but of God I
[1:05:23] don't believe God would ever will and
[1:05:26] give birth to someone that would rebel
[1:05:28] against him it's just not in his nature
[1:05:36] so he has that expectation of us 1st
[1:05:39] Peter chapter 1 verse number 23 being
[1:05:42] born again not if the corruptible seed
[1:05:45] but of incorruptible by the Word of God
[1:05:47] which liveth and abideth for ever second
[1:05:52] Corinthians chapter five verse ten sorry
[1:05:54] for so many scriptures tonight I guess
[1:05:56] there's more of a teaching than the
[1:05:58] preaching for we must all appear before
[1:06:02] the judgment seat of Christ that every
[1:06:05] one may receive the things which he done
[1:06:07] his body according to what you have done
[1:06:09] whether it be good or bad so we're all
[1:06:11] coming before the judgment seat of
[1:06:13] Christ every one of us now we're
[1:06:20] fortunate because today at this very
[1:06:25] moment we are standing at the judgment
[1:06:29] seat of Christ
[1:06:32] we're willingly judging ourselves by the
[1:06:37] word that God gives us and if we judge
[1:06:44] ourselves proper which is on wrong and
[1:06:46] our right Lord then we will sit with him
[1:06:50] on the throne
[1:06:51] and judge everybody else who was
[1:06:53] unwilling to judge themselves verse 11
[1:07:01] knowing therefore the terror of the Lord
[1:07:03] knowing the real situation about
[1:07:06] seriousness is
[1:07:07] we persuade men we're interested in
[1:07:12] helping other men not to be damned
[1:07:16] but we are made manifest unto God and
[1:07:20] Trust also are made manifest in your
[1:07:24] conscience
[1:07:25] so before others verse 14 for it's the
[1:07:28] love of Christ that constrains us to do
[1:07:31] this because we thus judge that have one
[1:07:34] died for all then we're all dead we
[1:07:37] don't have a will anymore right it's
[1:07:40] been forfeited verse fifteen in that he
[1:07:43] died for who for all that they which
[1:07:48] live should not henceforth live unto
[1:07:51] themselves Benanti him which died for
[1:07:57] them and rose again so we see here that
[1:07:59] our will has been forfeited now we've
[1:08:02] given our will over to God and the
[1:08:06] relationship of lordship begins now
[1:08:09] here's the problem to many people like
[1:08:12] the children of Israel they were
[1:08:14] satisfied with how much God was in their
[1:08:16] life they didn't they never battled that
[1:08:20] God was with them the battle was that
[1:08:25] they that they had to continue on when
[1:08:33] in their flesh they didn't want to give
[1:08:35] up more of their will they thought they
[1:08:39] would lose their life by going and
[1:08:42] facing the Giants and a lot of times we
[1:08:45] were facing the enemy in her life that
[1:08:46] will those those habits whatever it
[1:08:50] might be we face those things and we
[1:08:54] were too afraid to deal with them
[1:08:56] because we we think that we can't
[1:08:58] overcome them to Christ but all we have
[1:09:04] to do is will to do God's will and God
[1:09:08] will fight our battles take men it's the
[1:09:11] truth I know it wasn't Joshua's strength
[1:09:16] in himself that took those giants
[1:09:20] it was his faith in golf right and we've
[1:09:22] got to believe greater is He that's in
[1:09:24] US and he that's in the world yes
[1:09:30] verse 16 wherefore henceforth know we no
[1:09:35] man after the flesh
[1:09:37] yea though we have known Christ after
[1:09:40] the flesh yet now henceforth know we him
[1:09:44] no more in other words we don't know him
[1:09:46] no more as this day this baby is born
[1:09:53] the relationship is in the spirit we
[1:09:58] know Christ by the spirit God is a
[1:10:06] spirit they that worship Him must
[1:10:07] worship Him in spirit and in truth so
[1:10:13] our relationship as lordship it happens
[1:10:15] in the spirit is not outwardly it gets
[1:10:19] manifested out early but it's it starts
[1:10:24] inside so therefore if any man is really
[1:10:31] in Christ he's no longer the same he's a
[1:10:38] new creature old things are passed away
[1:10:41] behold all things become new and all
[1:10:43] things are of God now this is where
[1:10:46] every one of us are at were in this
[1:10:48] process of all things becoming new all
[1:10:54] of us can stand and testify of how many
[1:10:56] things are passed but is he Lord of
[1:11:03] everything as the song goes he sees now
[1:11:07] Lord until he's Lord of everything that
[1:11:09] Lord at all until he's Lord of
[1:11:11] everything because that's what it really
[1:11:13] means brother John what are you doing
[1:11:17] preaching telling me that Christ is not
[1:11:20] Lord of my life I am not telling you
[1:11:22] that yes what you're thinking
[1:11:29] and we we trust by the grace of God that
[1:11:33] God is speaking to us concerning the
[1:11:36] things that we need to surrender over to
[1:11:38] him
[1:11:42] all things are of God who reconciled us
[1:11:44] to himself by Jesus Christ and given to
[1:11:47] us a Ministry of reconciliation and you
[1:11:50] know I'm going to tell you the problem
[1:11:53] with John Martin is that the people the
[1:11:56] problem with John Martin is he don't
[1:11:58] want to do all of God's will
[1:12:00] the problem with John Martin is that he
[1:12:02] only wants to do most of God's will and
[1:12:08] I'm just that's right that's right
[1:12:11] that's the battle right there that we're
[1:12:13] in
[1:12:14] but as lordship he's given us a
[1:12:17] responsibility the greatest battle that
[1:12:24] we have is not allowing the devil to
[1:12:27] convince us that we don't have to do
[1:12:30] everything the word says brother Brandon
[1:12:35] said in a message convinced then
[1:12:37] concerned he said talking about Moses
[1:12:40] Moses likewise when he thought to take
[1:12:42] over down in Egypt and he killed that
[1:12:46] Egyptian had got unconcerned he wasn't
[1:12:52] concerned about it if God was going to
[1:12:56] be with him
[1:12:57] why wasn't he with him in other words it
[1:13:00] didn't happen the way that he planned it
[1:13:02] so when it didn't go his way
[1:13:05] he lost his concern so he went out he
[1:13:11] married a beautiful woman and so he had
[1:13:13] a baby by her Gershom and they were
[1:13:16] settled down and he was going to inherit
[1:13:19] a big flock of sheep out there from
[1:13:21] Jethro
[1:13:22] the midnight priest and he was
[1:13:24] everything was on easy street he would
[1:13:28] live with his wife and have a little
[1:13:30] home and you know just doing fine a good
[1:13:33] job
[1:13:34] well was going to be fall he was going
[1:13:38] to fall
[1:13:39] and everything was going to be alright
[1:13:44] he was unconcerned he didn't feel the
[1:13:49] taskmasters whip no more he wasn't
[1:13:53] concerned about his brethren down there
[1:13:56] about the poor midwives the women having
[1:14:00] their babies that a burst of their heads
[1:14:02] and thrown him to the crocodiles and now
[1:14:05] they made them serve hard down there in
[1:14:09] slavery and bondage he wasn't interested
[1:14:11] so he got to a place where he lost his
[1:14:16] concern he had his home pay for just
[1:14:21] like we do today that's the first thing
[1:14:23] we think about pay for a home he said
[1:14:26] that's good you ought to that's right
[1:14:28] but there is something ought to be come
[1:14:33] before that he said it's God God first
[1:14:39] and listen to this the going on of the
[1:14:44] church it's every man's duty in this
[1:14:48] church right here to see that that thing
[1:14:52] goes on right and you put your force to
[1:14:58] it to bring every man every woman boy
[1:15:01] and girl that you can in the streets and
[1:15:03] the hedges and the byways to bring him
[1:15:06] into the church we don't want to become
[1:15:14] what happened to Moses because things
[1:15:19] didn't go the way we worked on us how
[1:15:22] many times we tried to go out and share
[1:15:24] Jesus with somebody and they just you
[1:15:26] know totally made us feel like a heel
[1:15:30] made us to question
[1:15:32] come on maybe earlier in our on our in
[1:15:39] our Christian walk and then we kind of
[1:15:41] get discouraged and you think well maybe
[1:15:43] what I need is wisdom how I talk to them
[1:15:48] if I need to know more of the Bible
[1:15:50] maybe I gotta just give them and before
[1:15:54] you know it became so complexed and hard
[1:15:56] and we just kind of got discouraged from
[1:15:59] it yeah I am telling you the
[1:16:05] responsibility has not left us God still
[1:16:09] holds us accountable to the
[1:16:11] responsibility God is still concerned if
[1:16:15] God is living in us we will be concerned
[1:16:18] now I'm not questioning God's now
[1:16:20] Adina's what I in question in the is he
[1:16:22] lordship because too often we have that
[1:16:26] well God is in me as my savior I see him
[1:16:28] moving all these things in my life and
[1:16:30] you can't get in a question or doubt you
[1:16:32] know when I'm not trying to what I am
[1:16:35] trying to get across is a different
[1:16:37] relationship than what you have a
[1:16:42] different relationship Luke chapter 14
[1:16:46] verse 26 if any man come to me and hate
[1:16:50] not his father and mother and wife and
[1:16:52] children brothers and sisters ate his
[1:16:54] own life also he cannot be my disciple
[1:17:01] now that disciple was real important as
[1:17:03] we get into some scriptures coming up
[1:17:06] and whoever does not bear his cross and
[1:17:08] come after me cannot be my disciple
[1:17:11] verse 33 so likewise who suffer he be of
[1:17:15] youth that forsake not all that he had
[1:17:18] he cannot we're talking about a lordship
[1:17:21] relationship here why so many people
[1:17:23] ignore these scriptures is because
[1:17:25] they're satisfied with just seeing God
[1:17:27] in their life and rescue from the
[1:17:29] situation in that situation and they can
[1:17:31] say God is with me
[1:17:32] I believe in God but they're missing the
[1:17:35] part of God that we need to have in
[1:17:37] order to make a rapture John chapter 13
[1:17:47] st. John chapter 13 verse number three
[1:17:52] my-my-my so many scriptures so many
[1:17:58] faults not enough time
[1:18:02] pray for me Jesus verse 3 Jesus knowing
[1:18:07] that the father had given all things
[1:18:09] into his hands and that he was come from
[1:18:13] God and he went to God and he raises
[1:18:16] from supper and laid his side his
[1:18:19] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:18:20] himself and after they had forth water
[1:18:22] into a basin began to wash the disciples
[1:18:24] feet to wipe them with the towel
[1:18:26] wherewith he was girded then cometh he
[1:18:30] to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto Him
[1:18:32] Lord does that wash my feet I'm
[1:18:34] questioning you what you're doing and
[1:18:37] jesus answered and said to him what I do
[1:18:39] thou knowest not now
[1:18:42] well that was an obvious thing is you
[1:18:43] don't want to question God amen but thou
[1:18:48] shalt know Hereafter and Peter saith
[1:18:50] unto Him thou shall never wash my feet
[1:18:52] jesus answered if I watched be not thou
[1:18:56] has no part with me that's not good
[1:19:01] Simon Peter said unto Him Lord not my
[1:19:03] feet only but also my hands in my head
[1:19:07] and just keep it going and jesus saith
[1:19:10] unto Him he that has washed needeth not
[1:19:13] saved to wash his feet but it's clean
[1:19:17] everywhere and he are clean but at all
[1:19:26] Lord and Master have washed your feet
[1:19:29] you also ought to wash one another's
[1:19:33] feet for I have given you an example
[1:19:37] that you should do as I have done to you
[1:19:40] verily verily I say to you that this
[1:19:42] servant is not greater than his Lord
[1:19:45] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:19:47] that sent him if you know these things
[1:19:50] happy are he if he do them lives their
[1:20:00] situations and for okay about given our
[1:20:08] two sons you about how wrong your bad
[1:20:11] they are but for some reason there's no
[1:20:14] concern to get down on her knees pray to
[1:20:20] get a burden Lord show me how to help my
[1:20:24] sister my brother my enemy might my
[1:20:28] neighbor by my fellow co-worker whatever
[1:20:31] it might be if you don't do it you're
[1:20:35] not going to be happy God deserves such
[1:20:38] a joy for those that are willing to
[1:20:40] suffer for him when you think about
[1:20:44] Jesus as your Savior provider of all
[1:20:46] your needs or the rescue of your
[1:20:49] situations we need to realize there's
[1:20:52] more than one side to Jesus when we look
[1:21:01] at Jesus that way we're looking at Jesus
[1:21:05] he's the one doing all it's a one-sided
[1:21:08] relationship Jesus is doing all the
[1:21:12] sacrificing he's doing all the rescuing
[1:21:15] we pray lord help me comes in the house
[1:21:18] he's faithful he loves to do it he has
[1:21:21] no regrets
[1:21:22] none he's a joyful giver and sometimes
[1:21:28] we can get so carnal that we're breaking
[1:21:30] about that as if we found a greater
[1:21:35] favor than somebody else in the church
[1:21:44] let me just say like this you're just a
[1:21:47] better factor in your relationship
[1:21:50] if that's all you don't miss Savior
[1:21:52] you're just a benefactor and if you're
[1:21:54] lost praise God for salvation but we're
[1:21:57] not talking about that today we're
[1:21:58] talking about the maturity of our
[1:22:00] relationships with Christ now when we
[1:22:06] think of the other side of Jesus as the
[1:22:08] Lord of our lives
[1:22:09] then Jesus becomes the benefactor he
[1:22:15] becomes the benefactor why calls me Lord
[1:22:20] Lord and do not the things I say God has
[1:22:25] an input in the relationship he wants to
[1:22:27] take your body your life and he wants to
[1:22:30] use it to give himself glory no man can
[1:22:39] say that Jesus was lord but by the holy
[1:22:41] ghost it takes the Holy Ghost inside
[1:22:46] manifesting it out who the Lord really
[1:22:49] is because our flesh don't want to do it
[1:22:52] our flesh wants glory reputation look at
[1:22:59] me look God look what God look what
[1:23:02] God's doing through me I wouldn't be the
[1:23:09] Holy Ghost
[1:23:11] that would be John Martin's ghost
[1:23:14] [Music]
[1:23:17] lordship is more about perfecting our
[1:23:21] relationship with Christ as we decrease
[1:23:24] he increases when it becomes less about
[1:23:28] us and all about the Holy Ghost his will
[1:23:33] and his purpose Christ becomes the
[1:23:37] benefactor of the relationship he didn't
[1:23:40] save us for just the purpose so he could
[1:23:45] do all the providing he wants a
[1:23:47] relationship st. John chapter 14 helps
[1:23:54] us to understand more how to perfect a
[1:23:58] relationship from Savior the Lord you
[1:24:00] get time read that but in st. John
[1:24:02] chapter 14 verse 14 jesus said if ye
[1:24:06] shall ask anything in my name I will do
[1:24:10] it
[1:24:11] that's a rescuer that's one side the
[1:24:15] relationship but look at the very next
[1:24:17] verse if you love me do what I ask you
[1:24:23] to do this is the other side of the
[1:24:27] relationship where he becomes the
[1:24:29] benefactor there is a reason God wants
[1:24:31] you to do what he asked you to do he's
[1:24:36] getting something out of it he wants
[1:24:42] he's going to get something out of it he
[1:24:45] don't have you do things in vain there's
[1:24:47] some soul that he's got in mind somebody
[1:24:49] that's gonna get help
[1:24:50] [Music]
[1:24:52] he doesn't do things in vain there's a
[1:24:54] purpose verse 21 he that hath my
[1:25:00] Commandments and keepeth them he it is
[1:25:03] that loveth me and he that loveth me
[1:25:06] shall be loved of my father and I will
[1:25:08] love him and will manifest myself to him
[1:25:13] when your relationship moves towards
[1:25:16] obeying the word you will come to know
[1:25:21] God more because he's gonna reveal
[1:25:22] himself more the promise here is if you
[1:25:29] if you keep his Commandments
[1:25:34] Jesus says we will come in the Holy
[1:25:38] Ghost God Almighty his name is Jesus
[1:25:43] he'll be your friend will come into you
[1:25:47] and will manifest himself in you now you
[1:25:50] can't make that happen you can't force
[1:25:53] it knowledge can't do it
[1:25:55] quoting the scriptures won't do it it's
[1:26:00] a love affair it's I'm willing to do
[1:26:05] what you ask me to do the reward is now
[1:26:08] you get to know Christ more you what is
[1:26:13] greater what greater thing could we have
[1:26:16] with God but to know him more to know
[1:26:24] God is beautiful
[1:26:25] it's life I'd rather know God more than
[1:26:30] any other thing Philippians chapter 3
[1:26:40] verse number 10 I have to skip so much
[1:26:45] here but Paul speaking he says that I
[1:26:49] might know him and the power of his
[1:26:53] resurrection the Fellowship of his
[1:26:55] sufferings being made conformable unto
[1:26:57] his death that if by any means I might
[1:27:01] attain to the resurrection of the Dead
[1:27:05] there the only way we really know that
[1:27:09] Christ in the Fellowship of his
[1:27:11] sufferings is not by how much we suffer
[1:27:15] but how much we surrender our will
[1:27:19] because if you surrender your will you
[1:27:23] will be suffering
[1:27:25] yeah you you can't do the will of God on
[1:27:30] a flowery bed of ease you can't be an
[1:27:35] administrator you have to lay down your
[1:27:43] life you have to pick up your cross you
[1:27:46] have to get down and wash somebody's
[1:27:48] feet so they could really see the love
[1:27:50] of God people don't want to suffer but
[1:27:58] it takes suffering to know Christ if I'm
[1:28:01] going to love God the way that he tells
[1:28:06] me love is which is to obey Him I'm
[1:28:10] gonna have to suffer cuz my flesh don't
[1:28:12] want to my flesh does not want to obey
[1:28:16] no flesh does so why doesn't be
[1:28:19] crucified why why we have to die out die
[1:28:23] daily and to do that require suffering
[1:28:28] until we're in the new bodies yes we're
[1:28:34] gonna be battling amen I just write
[1:28:38] these down if because we don't have time
[1:28:42] to go from but first Peter chapter 3
[1:28:44] verse 17 and 18 first Peter chapter 4 12
[1:28:49] through 15 16 through 19 I guess that
[1:28:56] would be first Peter chapter 4 chapter
[1:28:58] chapter 4 verses 12 through 19 oh my my
[1:29:04] these scriptures talk about suffering
[1:29:08] that it is the will of God for us to
[1:29:11] suffer as a Christian and second Timothy
[1:29:17] chapter 2 verses 1 through 13 write that
[1:29:20] down spend some time reading that Paul
[1:29:23] was tellin Timothy to be strong in in
[1:29:27] the grace of the Lord Jesus endure
[1:29:29] hardness as a good soldier he he speaks
[1:29:33] that he himself suffers trouble as an
[1:29:37] evildoer
[1:29:37] therefore all things for the elects sake
[1:29:40] he endures well that's that ain't
[1:29:43] sitting on a you know a platform like
[1:29:45] this and enjoying yourself
[1:29:49] no therefore i endure all things for the
[1:29:52] elects sake that i may also that they
[1:29:56] may also obtain salvation see there's a
[1:29:59] purpose and our suffering is not for us
[1:30:02] just to be you know cramped into some
[1:30:07] do's and don'ts we're suffering that
[1:30:11] somebody can be saved if you can't see
[1:30:13] somebody else's salvation in your
[1:30:15] suffering you're looking at the
[1:30:16] situation wrong and he says in verse 12
[1:30:22] if we suffer we shall also reign with
[1:30:25] him if we suffer we should also reign so
[1:30:30] it's a requirement it's a requirement
[1:30:38] for unto you is born two thousand years
[1:30:41] ago on the Sea of David a savior which
[1:30:44] is Christ the Lord you shall you shall
[1:30:50] find him when you seek for his shirt for
[1:30:53] him with all your heart love him with
[1:30:57] all your heart Colossians chapter 1
[1:31:03] verse 17 and 18 I just want to close
[1:31:06] with this he is before all things and by
[1:31:10] him all things consist
[1:31:12] and he is the head of the body the
[1:31:15] church who is the beginning the
[1:31:18] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:31:21] things he might have the preeminence God
[1:31:27] desiring the preeminence will not force
[1:31:32] it he'll continue to have a relationship
[1:31:36] with us as a savior rescue us from our
[1:31:40] situations
[1:31:42] anytime it's going to enter into the
[1:31:44] lordship we have to be willing to
[1:31:47] surrender our will with two gods what an
[1:31:55] opportunity we have to surrender our
[1:31:59] will to gods can I just read one more
[1:32:03] global okay

[1:32:12] but it don't bring the spirit and the
[1:32:15] power of God down it might bring
[1:32:17] enthusiasm but it don't bring the power
[1:32:19] of God there they're not willing to pay
[1:32:22] the price
