[12:29] We need to pay more attention to what
[12:32] God's saying through the spirit than
[12:34] what all these loud noises out in the
[12:37] world. Amen. What a day that'll be.
[12:40] Amen. I'm looking for it. There's a
[12:44] there's coming
[12:47] a day
[12:48] when no heartache
[12:51] shall come and no more clouds
[12:55] in the sky.
[12:58] No more tears that dim the eye and for
[13:03] peace forever more
[13:06] on that happy golden shore.
[13:11] What a day. A glorious day that will be.
[13:16] Just think about it.
[13:19] What a day
[13:21] that will be when my Jesus I shall see.
[13:28] When I look upon his face, the one who
[13:32] saved me by his grace. When he takes me
[13:38] by the hand and leads me through the
[13:42] promised land. What a day, a glorious
[13:47] day that will be.

[14:11] I will be with the one who died for me.
[14:18] What a day, a glorious day that will be.
[14:26] What a day that will be. When my Jesus I
[14:32] shall see. When I look upon his face,

[14:47] through the promised land. What a day,
[14:52] glorious day that will be.
[14:58] What a day that will be. When my Jesus I
[15:04] shall see. When I look upon his face,

[15:18] through the promised land. What a day, a
[15:24] glorious day that will be.
[15:29] Hallelujah.
[15:31] Hallelujah. But what a day that will be.
[15:35] I hope you're thinking about that day,
[15:38] you know, because your thoughts mean a
[15:40] lot.
[15:42] And if your thoughts are on Christ, then
[15:44] they're in the right spot.
[15:47] Not about what I got to do tomorrow,
[15:49] what I got to do the next day, because
[15:50] there's always going to be something to
[15:52] do tomorrow and something to do next
[15:53] day. But where where are we eventually
[15:57] going to end up? Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[16:02] Well, I just want to change of order of
[16:04] service and just a few needs here. Our
[16:07] sister Linda has a request here. Uh on
[16:11] September 16th,
[16:14] I have to go in for an
[16:18] ablation
[16:20] in my heart again.
[16:23] Uh my head is
[16:28] her her heart's gotten weak. So, let's
[16:30] just pray for our sister Linda. Amen.
[16:33] That the doctors uh can solve whatever
[16:37] is going on. Amen. And also, she has a
[16:40] request for Michael to be completely and
[16:43] complete and surrendered. Amen.
[16:47] I mean,
[16:48] we can look at somebody and say, "Oh,
[16:50] they need to be delivered." But we all
[16:52] need to be delivered. We all need to be
[16:55] completely sold out, not just half sold
[16:57] out. even even 80% or 90%.
[17:02] You know, God wants all of us. He's a
[17:05] jealous God. He don't want to share us
[17:07] with anybody. Amen.
[17:10] Um
[17:12] let's just pray for our s remember to
[17:14] continue to pray for our sister Donna.
[17:16] Amen. I heard that she's live streaming
[17:19] um the services. So we pray that she God
[17:22] gives her strength and uh in this time
[17:26] we would just want her to know that
[17:28] we're praying for her
[17:31] and whether it's here or at home, you're
[17:34] always in our heart.
[17:38] also for uh brother Bill and sister
[17:42] Elizabeth with cancer. Anybody else
[17:44] that's dealing with cancer or any kind
[17:47] of illness. I pray that uh the Lord
[17:50] touches our sister Cheryl and our sister
[17:52] Ann's complete for our sister Linda. Uh
[17:56] for our brother um
[18:00] the Beckman's. Amen. I don't know where
[18:02] they are tonight but um we pray that I
[18:05] know their desire would be to be here.
[18:07] So, we just pray that the Lord's
[18:08] protection over them. Oh, yes. And
[18:11] brother Marty, um, he's not feeling
[18:14] well, so he's on some pain pills and
[18:16] he's just live streaming tonight. So, we
[18:19] hold you up in prayer, brother. And, uh,
[18:21] we just want to know that, uh, we're
[18:24] praying for you. Amen. So, uh, let's
[18:27] just remember them, um, prayers tonight.
[18:31] Let's remember all the missionaries. Uh,
[18:34] brother Boaz sent me a a text, you know,
[18:38] just to say, "Hi, love you. I'm praying
[18:41] for you."
[18:44] Sometimes
[18:46] that's what's needed.
[18:49] It doesn't have to be a long
[18:51] conversation,
[18:54] but just, you know, just something I
[18:56] love you. Amen. Well, before we go in
[19:01] prayer, I just I I just I just want to
[19:04] give a little testimony. And sometimes,
[19:06] you know, we think, well, what, you
[19:08] know, a testimony of what do I what I
[19:10] got to testify, but God's always working
[19:13] in our lives. You know, if you're in
[19:15] Christ, there's always something going
[19:17] on and there's always something to
[19:19] testify of him. You know, for a long
[19:21] time, we've had this couch out here that
[19:24] every time I clean, pieces come off of
[19:26] it, right?
[19:28] you know, and it's it was always kind of
[19:30] a like, okay, you know, I got and I got
[19:33] to make sure I clean this couch off when
[19:35] I'm cleaning up. And the other day, I
[19:38] think it was just the day before when I
[19:40] don't know when we got that, but just
[19:42] before we got it, the day before we got
[19:44] it, I was cleaning. I said, Lord,
[19:48] I says, you know, I said, put somebody
[19:50] on Facebook or or just put it in
[19:52] somebody's heart for we need a new
[19:54] couch. I came in church and we got a new
[19:56] couch.
[19:59] No, I didn't tell anybody, but he knew.
[20:02] And
[20:04] that's how God is, you know. So, let's
[20:07] just remember that sometimes it might
[20:09] seem like a odd request. It's only a
[20:12] couch, but God hears your prayers. So,
[20:15] he don't, you know, he just wants you to
[20:17] know that you can rely on him.
[20:22] Also, um, as I was cleaning today, you
[20:25] know, just another thing I I was in the
[20:27] church praying and, uh, I asked God for
[20:30] a revival in our church.
[20:35] You know what he told me? Start one.
[20:40] Don't rely on somebody else to be the
[20:42] one to start it.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; You start it.
[20:48] And if everybody had that attitude,
[20:51] then we would have a revival.
[20:55] It only takes one.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; But
[20:59] everybody's waiting on that one.
[21:02] And God's waiting on us.
[21:05] So, let's just remember that. Amen. And
[21:08] not just an announcement. Let's remember
[21:09] the Fontaine family band on September uh
[21:13] 13th. Amen. at 6:00 we have these flyers
[21:17] out there.
[21:19] Amen. Um just try to bring 10 people,
[21:24] try to tell them people. Um we all know,
[21:27] we've all probably listened to him
[21:29] before. So we know that uh they're
[21:33] inspired by the Lord and uh we want to
[21:37] inspire other people through that
[21:39] ministry.
[21:41] you know, we want we have to set oursel
[21:43] aside. We're just not a church, you
[21:47] know, that believes in part of the word.
[21:49] We believe it in the whole word. And
[21:52] sometimes it makes us a little bit small
[21:55] in numbers, but God is big and he cares
[22:00] about the little numbers because of the
[22:03] ones that really touch his heart. So,
[22:06] amen. Let's just stand tonight.
[22:10] Let's just go on one chord. Dear
[22:12] heavenly father, Lord, as we come before
[22:14] you tonight, Lord, we come, Lord,
[22:16] because you've given us this opportunity
[22:18] once again, Lord, to submit ourselves to
[22:21] you, Lord God, to come with and be with
[22:24] brothers and sisters of like faith, Lord
[22:27] God, that we can unite one on one
[22:29] accord, Lord God, for one thing, Lord,
[22:32] that just to Lord, to just fall more in
[22:34] love with you, Lord, to submit
[22:36] ourselves, Lord God. for without
[22:38] submission Lord there is no there is no
[22:41] completeness Lord there is no Lord up
[22:45] 100% Lord we Lord we just stand here

[23:07] And may Lord they receive something Lord
[23:10] that would just help them Lord that
[23:13] would help them claw draw close to you
[23:15] and realize Lord that you are the truth
[23:17] the way and the life Lord there is
[23:19] nothing at the end of the road that Lord
[23:22] that we can take with us Lord but you
[23:25] Lord we just love you Lord and we just
[23:28] praise you Lord. We lift you up on high,
[23:30] Lord God, because you are our mighty
[23:32] God, Lord, and there is nothing that can
[23:35] stand between us and not even the gates
[23:37] of hell, Lord God, can come between us,

[30:47] And I am bound for the promised land.
[30:52] Oh, who will come and go with me? I am
[30:57] bound for the promised land.
[31:02] When shall I reach that happy place and
[31:07] be forever
[31:10] blessed?
[31:12] When shall I see my father's face and in
[31:18] his bosom rest?
[31:21] I am bound for the promised land.
[31:26] I am bound for the promised land.
[31:31] Oh, who will come and go with me? I am
[31:36] bound for the promised land.
[31:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; I hope you are determined to be bound
[31:47] for the promised land.
[31:50] For it's all about your expectation.
[31:54] I believe God can meet every expectation
[31:56] that we have if we just are truthful in
[32:00] our hearts. That's what we want. Amen.
[32:02] Let's just sing only believe as our
[32:04] brother Mark comes. Amen.
[32:07] Only
[32:10] believe.
[32:13] Only

[33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe that tonight?
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads in a word of
[33:53] prayer. Dear gracious heavenly father,
[33:56] we always count it an honor and a
[33:58] privilege to be in your presence in your
[34:01] house. Lord, we just want to give you
[34:04] the full preeminence, Lord, in our
[34:06] lives, in our hearts, every part of our
[34:08] life, Lord. May you just speak to us
[34:10] through the preaching of the word. May
[34:12] you move me far out the way, Lord, that
[34:14] the people may hear directly from you,
[34:17] Lord. Lord, May you bring each
[34:18] scripture, each quote to life, Lord, and
[34:21] let us be able to have a testimony that
[34:22] you spoke with us and walked with us,
[34:24] Lord, during the service. Father, now we
[34:27] give this service into your hands from
[34:29] the opening prayer to the ending prayer.
[34:31] And Lord, we want to just we know your
[34:33] word declares if two or three are
[34:35] gathering your name, there you'll be in
[34:37] the midst. And Lord, we're more than
[34:38] three. We're more than two. And Lord, we
[34:41] know that you're here, Lord. You
[34:42] promise, Lord.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; And Father, once again, meet each need
[34:45] here tonight, Lord. You know each heart.
[34:47] You know each unspoken Lord. In Jesus
[34:49] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[34:52] I want to say it's always an honor and a
[34:54] privilege to be with family.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Um it's been a while. It's actually been
[34:58] exactly a year I believe. So time time
[35:01] flies and I can see when the prophet
[35:03] said that um when you come back in a
[35:05] year, you won't see people. I never
[35:07] experienced that. But just seeing one of
[35:09] our uh one of our own just brother Bruce
[35:11] just going to be with the Lord is, you
[35:13] know, it's surprising. But God knows
[35:16] all. And um one of my favorite songs
[35:18] that Brother Bruce used to sing was the
[35:19] evening time. That's one of my favorite
[35:21] songs that he used to sing. So I always
[35:23] think about that um since he's passed.
[35:26] But let us open the word into Psalms 46.
[35:32] Very familiar scripture. Let me set a
[35:35] timer so I don't preach for three hours.
[35:37] I'm just kid. I'm just kidding.
[35:40] Um so it'll be Psalms 46 and we'll read
[35:43] the first. So actually we'll read the
[35:44] whole chapter. It's not very long. So
[35:46] say amen when you get there and we'll
[35:48] we'll start.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; So it says, "God is our refuge and
[35:53] strength, a very present help in
[35:57] trouble." So I love how David just
[35:58] starts off right there just telling you
[36:00] what God is. So now, in order for you to
[36:03] experience that, you have to have a
[36:05] personal experience of God being your
[36:07] refuge, your strength. And the thing is
[36:09] a lot of people just wait um for trouble
[36:12] for God to be all those things. God can
[36:14] be all those things in trouble and out
[36:17] of trouble. So it says, "Therefore will
[36:19] we not fear though the earth be removed
[36:22] and the mountains be carried into the
[36:24] midst of the sea. Though the waters
[36:26] therefore roar and be troubled, though
[36:28] the mountains shake with the swelling
[36:31] thereof, salah." So salah really it's
[36:34] like a pause like like like like take it
[36:36] in like like like really uh see what the
[36:39] author is talking about right here.
[36:41] There's a river the streams whereof
[36:43] shall make glad the city of God. The
[36:46] holy place of the tabernacles of the
[36:48] most high God is in the midst of her.
[36:51] She shall not be moved. God shall help
[36:54] her in that right and early. The heathen
[36:57] raged and the kingdoms were moved and he
[37:00] uttered. His voice the earth melted. The
[37:03] Lord of hosts is with us. The God of
[37:05] Jacob is our refuge. Salah. Come behold
[37:08] the works of the Lord. What desolations
[37:10] he hath made in the earth. He maketh
[37:12] wars to cease at the end of the earth.
[37:14] He breakth the bow and cutth the spear
[37:16] in a sunder. He burneth the chariot in
[37:19] fire. Be still and know that I am God.
[37:23] I'll be exalted among the heathen. I'll
[37:25] be exalted in the earth. The Lord of
[37:27] hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is
[37:30] our refuge. Salah, you may be seated.
[37:33] So, the title of this sermon is though
[37:36] the oceans may roar.
[37:39] And so, I I'll a little uh further down
[37:42] the sermon, I I'll give where the
[37:44] inspiration came from. Um, so I look up
[37:46] the word roar. It's to cause a loud
[37:50] continuous sound. We say the sea or the
[37:52] wind roars. A company roar and
[37:54] acclamation to make a loud noise. And so
[37:57] I want to break these scriptures down
[37:59] that we just read. So as we're looking
[38:01] at these set of scriptures, a lot is
[38:03] going on that David has mentioned. The
[38:05] first thing he says, though the earth be
[38:07] removed, and that could be a very tragic
[38:10] experience in your life, it could be
[38:12] many things. Though the mountains be
[38:14] carried into the midst of the sea, your
[38:15] world can be turned upside down. Though
[38:18] the waters therefore roar and be
[38:19] troubled, though the mountains shake
[38:21] with the uh with the swelling thereof,
[38:23] then he says salah. But before he before
[38:26] he gets into that, he says God says,
[38:29] "God is our refuge and strength, a very
[38:33] present help in trouble." I know that
[38:35] the Sendelite Church has been through a
[38:36] lot of loss lately, Brother Bruce,
[38:39] Brother Johnson, but I will tell you
[38:41] this that God is still your refuge. God
[38:43] will still supply every need that you
[38:46] have. God knows what you need and he
[38:48] always an ontime God.
[38:51] And so I want to read uh one quote and
[38:53] we'll read it from uh as as I thought of
[38:56] my ways. So David later cried, I'll bind
[38:59] thy commandments on my bedpost. I honor
[39:02] thy statues and all when he sees the
[39:04] goodness of God. But you know the
[39:06] psalmist said again that God is our
[39:09] refuge, a very present help in a time of
[39:11] trouble. So it's good to know God. Find
[39:15] God, get on speaking terms with him
[39:17] while there's nothing wrong. So, I love
[39:19] how the prophet points that out because
[39:21] a lot of times people will come to God.
[39:23] It could be when they're in prison, when
[39:26] they're broke, when they're bankrupt, or
[39:29] when uh they get a divorce, or whatever
[39:31] it may be. A lot of times, God, they
[39:33] they use God as a last resort. But the
[39:36] thing is, if you're on good speaking
[39:38] terms with God, it doesn't matter if
[39:40] you're in distress or not in distress.
[39:42] You know that God is your refuge in
[39:44] trouble or without trouble. So the
[39:46] prophet is trying to tell us that we
[39:47] need to have good speaking terms because
[39:49] God wants to speak to you. He he wants
[39:52] to supply your spiritual needs, your
[39:54] physical needs. A lot of times people
[39:55] just want their their physical needs. I
[39:57] need more money in the bank account or I
[39:59] need a brand new car. I need this. But
[40:01] I'll tell you this that God honors
[40:02] faithfulness. If you're faithful to God,
[40:04] he'll be faithful to you. God even cares
[40:07] about the little things that may not
[40:09] mean anything to other people, but God
[40:11] cares about those little things.
[40:14] And so I gave the inspiration where I
[40:16] got the the title of the sermon from.
[40:17] So, uh, Brother Jack's daughter, Brother
[40:19] Rebecca, she made an album last year.
[40:21] And, um, I was just I listened to this
[40:23] song a lot. And I was listening to it,
[40:25] um, I think before I was before I was
[40:28] uh, my trip this last week. And the the
[40:32] title just hit me because she says,
[40:33] "Though the I'll read the I'll read you
[40:35] the lyrics where the inspiration came."
[40:37] said, "Though the oceans may roar and
[40:39] the mountains be shaken, I know I'm not
[40:43] forsaken. You are with me. Every step,
[40:46] every step that I take, know I don't
[40:49] have to worry. I know your hand will
[40:51] guide me because you are with me." And
[40:53] that just like just struck and I was
[40:55] like, "All right, Lord." And so that
[40:57] just in those lyrics right there, even
[40:59] the oceans are roaring, we know that God
[41:01] is still in the midst with us as David
[41:03] said in Psalms. So when everything seems
[41:05] like it's going wrong, God said that he
[41:08] will not give you anything you cannot
[41:10] bear. So sometimes it seems like we're
[41:12] drowning, but we're really not. God is
[41:15] right there with you. And so the thing
[41:16] is, we got to keep our eyes on the
[41:18] author and finisher, Jesus Christ.
[41:20] Because what the enemy is trying to do
[41:22] is he's trying to discourage you. He's
[41:24] trying to take your faith away. And he
[41:26] knows if he can take your faith away, he
[41:28] has you. He knows that he's powerless
[41:30] when you're inside of God. and he knows
[41:33] he's trying same thing he did to he did
[41:36] to Eve to everybody he tries to get you
[41:38] to disbelieve even if this one part of
[41:40] the word of God so in this day and age
[41:43] Satan has he's studied mankind and he
[41:46] knows your weaknesses he knows your
[41:49] strengths and so what we have to do is
[41:51] we have to cling to God that much more
[41:54] because I can't defeat the enemy with my
[41:56] own strength
[41:57] &gt;&gt; I'm weak but in Christ I am strong we're
[42:00] more than conquerors as the Bible Ible
[42:02] says, so it's not our job to try to
[42:05] figure everything out. So sometimes say,
[42:07] why did brother Bruce die? Why did this
[42:09] person why did this? Why why why is this
[42:11] going wrong? Why why is this bill here?
[42:13] Sometimes we're trying to figure
[42:14] everything out. Don't figure everything
[42:17] out cuz it's what's going to do is going
[42:18] to give you a headache. It's going to
[42:20] stress you out. It's going to actually
[42:21] it's going to it's going to decrease
[42:23] your faith because God never asked you
[42:25] to figure everything out. He said just
[42:28] believe me. No, you cannot find me one
[42:30] time in scripture. Jesus said, "Figure
[42:32] it out." He said, "If thou canst,
[42:33] believe." And you can't figure God out
[42:36] by your intellects. He's not meant to be
[42:38] figured out. He's figured out by faith,
[42:40] by trusting. And so, that's what that's
[42:42] what the issue we have in this world is
[42:45] we're trying to figure every single
[42:46] thing out. And God's just saying, "Just
[42:48] walk with me. Trust me." Let's go to
[42:51] Romans 8. This is another very familiar
[42:53] scripture that we probably can all
[42:54] quote. We probably read it thousands of
[42:57] times, but I believe it's so so vital
[42:59] and so important.
[43:04] Let me get there myself. So 8:35 and
[43:06] we'll just read the rest of the chapter
[43:08] there.
[43:09] So Paul says here, "Who shall separate
[43:12] us from the love of Christ?" That's a
[43:13] question he's asking us. Shall
[43:15] tribulation or distress or persecution
[43:18] or famine or nakedness or prevail or
[43:21] sword? And a lot of times people will
[43:23] let these things separate them from the
[43:27] love of Christ. And God is trying to
[43:29] tell talk to us through the prophet here
[43:31] Paul that none of these things should
[43:33] separate us from the love of Christ.
[43:35] None of these things. And he says as it
[43:38] is written for thy sake we are killed
[43:40] all the day long. We are counted as
[43:42] sheep for the slaughter. Verse 37. Nay,
[43:45] I love it right here is talking to all
[43:47] of us here. Nay, in all of these things
[43:49] we are more than conquerors through him
[43:52] that loved us. So you got to realize
[43:54] when he died on the cross and rose
[43:56] again, it gave you he he called you to
[43:59] be an overcomer.
[44:01] You can no longer be defeated by the
[44:03] devil if you're inside of Christ. Only
[44:05] time you're defeated by the devil if you
[44:06] go outside of Christ. So we have to stay
[44:09] inside of Christ. And it's not a an easy
[44:12] thing. It's difficult because it's a
[44:15] constant battle between your flesh and
[44:17] your spirit. So that's why it's so
[44:19] important to be feeding on the things of
[44:21] God, to be keeping our eyes on the
[44:23] things of God because it's so easy to
[44:24] get caught up in our own lives. I mean,
[44:26] look how busy, look 10 years ago until
[44:29] now, how much busier you are.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; It seems like every year more things get
[44:33] added to our we got to do this, we got
[44:34] to do this, now this goes wrong, we got
[44:36] to fix this, we got to fix that, we got
[44:38] this issue, this problem. And and Satan
[44:40] knows. So he and the thing is he he
[44:43] can't get us with these bad things but
[44:45] he can get us with other things that we
[44:47] consider to be good like family is
[44:49] amazing but we can't put anything before
[44:51] God. We got to put everything in its
[44:53] proper place. Um let's go to verse 38.
[44:56] I love He says, "For I am persuaded," I
[45:00] love that neither death nor life, nor
[45:03] angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
[45:07] nor things present, nor things to come,
[45:09] jobs, you could put whatever you put,
[45:11] you could put fill in the blank in
[45:12] there. None of these things should uh
[45:14] separate us from the love of Christ, nor
[45:17] height, nor depth, nor any other
[45:19] creature. So now Paul is like telling us
[45:22] everything. So nothing's left out. He
[45:24] said, "Nor height, nor depth, nor any
[45:26] other creature shall be able to separate
[45:28] us from the love of God which is in
[45:30] Christ Jesus our Lord." So basically
[45:33] what it's telling me is that I have no
[45:36] excuse.
[45:37] God is not accepting any excuse.
[45:41] None whatsoever. And I know sometimes we
[45:44] we think we we can trick ourselves with
[45:46] good excuses, but God doesn't want to
[45:49] hear our excuses. Not my excuses, not
[45:51] your excuses. Um, and so the thing is
[45:54] the enemy wants us to make excuses like
[45:56] you can just do it tomorrow or do it
[45:57] next week, do it next year. But a lot of
[45:59] times tomorrow isn't promised. I always
[46:01] tell people it doesn't matter how young
[46:02] you are, how old you are, tomorrow is
[46:05] not promised. You could be the
[46:06] healthiest person in the whole entire
[46:07] world and die the next day. So to me is
[46:10] what you do with this life is the most
[46:14] important thing because we're going to
[46:15] be judged how we how we use this life.
[46:18] And the thing is what's done for Christ
[46:20] is the only thing that's going to
[46:21] matter.
[46:23] So I I love looking up definitions. So I
[46:25] the first I look is tri tribulation. So
[46:27] the definition of that is severe
[46:29] affliction, distress of life, vexations.
[46:32] In scripture, it often denounces the
[46:34] troubles and distresses which proceed
[46:37] from persecution. Now distress extreme
[46:40] pain anguish of body or mind as to
[46:43] suffer great distress from gout or from
[46:46] loss of near friends. I'm pray all of us
[46:48] all of us can relate to these
[46:50] definitions. Um also means affliction,
[46:52] calamity, misery on earth distress of
[46:56] nations. Now another definition a state
[46:59] of danger as a ship in distress from
[47:01] leaking loss of spars or want of
[47:03] provisions of water. And then
[47:05] persecution.
[47:08] The act of practice of persecuting the
[47:10] infliction of pain, punishment or death
[47:12] upon other injustly particularly of
[47:14] adhering to religious creed. Now we
[47:17] don't we don't experience the type of
[47:20] persecution as giving our life like they
[47:22] did in the dark ages. But we still go
[47:24] through persecution. How many of us can
[47:27] relate of family members or friends
[47:29] walking away from us or not wanting to
[47:31] be friends? I lost many friends. Um,
[47:34] just because you're living a different
[47:35] because there's two different spirits.
[47:36] The spirit of God and the spirit of
[47:38] Satan. And when your friends realize
[47:40] that you don't do the things, it could
[47:42] be drinking, smoking, whatever it is,
[47:44] then you guys have nothing in common
[47:45] anymore. And so that's that that that's
[47:49] the thing is we all can experience loss.
[47:51] We all can testify, oh, I've lost this
[47:53] friend, that friend, but it's okay. It's
[47:55] it's normal. That means you're growing
[47:57] in Christ. And so the next one is
[47:59] famine. So scarcity of food, dirt, or a
[48:03] general one of provisions sufficient for
[48:06] the inhabitants of a country or besieged
[48:08] place. So there's a famine in the land.
[48:10] Now nakedness is once a means of
[48:11] defense. And the last one's prevail,
[48:14] danger, risk, hazard, jeopardy,
[48:16] particular exposure of a person or
[48:18] property to injury, loss, or destruction
[48:21] from any cause whatever. So now these
[48:24] things that we go through, we got to
[48:26] realize that they're to make us more
[48:29] like him. Just like brother John was
[48:30] preaching on Sunday, it's about the
[48:32] building. God is building a building
[48:34] inside of us. And it's supposed to get
[48:37] to the perfect stature of a perfect man.
[48:39] And like you said, the first foundation
[48:41] has to be faith. If you can't trust God,
[48:44] then you can never have a true walk with
[48:46] God. And God never asks you to figure
[48:49] out. He says faith. He says believe me.
[48:51] So the thing is it's so important that
[48:52] you come to God in faith. That's the
[48:55] first foundation. And like if you build
[48:56] a house and the foundation is not
[48:58] strong, the house would eventually
[49:00] crumble. A lot of people try to come to
[49:03] God with halfway faith or no faith and
[49:06] then when when things start happening,
[49:08] trouble happens, they run away. They go
[49:10] back into the world. So it's so
[49:11] important to build your house upon a
[49:13] rock and not upon sand as Jesus said.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; And so the thing is you can't be called
[49:19] a conqueror and overcomer if there's
[49:21] nothing for you to overcome. So when
[49:23] people think when they come to Christ,
[49:25] everything is all hunky dory, a walk
[49:28] through flowers. No. If he calls you
[49:30] being an overcomer, there's going to be
[49:32] obstacles. There's going to be issues,
[49:34] situations that you're going to have to
[49:36] overcome through Christ Jesus. Because
[49:39] otherwise, if you win a war, you can't
[49:41] win a war without not without without
[49:43] not fighting. You got to fight every
[49:44] inch. So the same thing with your walk
[49:46] with God. If you got to fight in the
[49:47] natural and a war, you got to fight the
[49:48] spiritual as well.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; And so it's such important thing. And I
[49:52] love I love just the how Peter says this
[49:54] in 1 Peter chapter 4:12-19. He said,
[49:58] "Beloved, think it not strange
[50:00] concerning the fiery trials which is to
[50:03] try you." He's trying to tell us, don't
[50:05] don't be surprised when these things
[50:07] come. When situations comes, issues
[50:10] come. They're going to come. If you're
[50:11] serving God, they're going to come. And
[50:13] they're not meant to decrease your faith
[50:15] or or or or uh hurt your faith. They're
[50:18] actually meant to build your faith. And
[50:20] he says, "But rejoice in so much." He
[50:22] says, "Rejoice." So be thankful that
[50:24] you're being tested. You're being tried
[50:27] cuz it's an opportunity for more Christ
[50:28] to be in you. So this is a trial you're
[50:31] going through. All this loss. It's a
[50:33] trial, but it's not meant to hurt you.
[50:36] It's not meant to break you in half, but
[50:38] it's but something has to die for you to
[50:41] live. So sometimes we have to uh I guess
[50:45] metaphorically like it's like almost
[50:46] feeling like we're being stabbed, losing
[50:48] a loved one. But in reality, life is
[50:51] actually blooming.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; And so, but rejoice in so much as you're
[50:54] partakers of Christ's suffering. That's
[50:57] a beautiful thing that when his glory
[50:59] shall be revealed, you may be glad also
[51:02] with exceeding joy. If you be reproached
[51:04] for the name of Christ, happy are ye.
[51:07] So, that's that's a that's a blessing
[51:08] and a testimony within itself to be
[51:11] reproached for the name of Christ. For
[51:13] the spirit of the glory and of God
[51:15] resteth upon you. On their part is evil
[51:18] spoken of, but on your part he is
[51:20] glorified. So let's read a quote from uh
[51:23] the resurrection of Lazarus.
[51:26] So he got sick and sometimes God tries
[51:29] your faith. Do you believe that? Every
[51:31] son that cometh to God must be tried.
[51:34] Think it not strange that fiery trials
[51:36] come because it's only done to perfect
[51:39] your faith. Draw you closer. They're
[51:42] worth more than gold to you. All right.
[51:46] So, once again, the prophet just is
[51:47] hammering that these trials are to build
[51:50] you. God wants to build you. That's his
[51:53] whole desire, his whole purpose. The
[51:55] more he can build you, the more he can
[51:57] use you. God wants to use each one of
[52:00] you guys.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; And so, if we're not going through
[52:02] trials, then how is he going to use us
[52:05] in the magnitude that he wants to use
[52:07] us? Because God has a plan and purpose
[52:09] for each one of our lives. and and and
[52:11] the purpose is to uh he gives us he
[52:14] gives us the ministry of reconciliation
[52:16] restoration.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; God is in the restoration business.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; It says in Joel um what the cankerworm
[52:23] eating the palmer worm uh the
[52:24] caterpillar. Am I missing one? The
[52:26] locust, he said, "I will restore."
[52:31] &gt;&gt; And restoration. He wants restoration in
[52:33] all of our lives. At my church back
[52:35] home, we uh the our uh word for the last
[52:38] year and a half has been restoration and
[52:40] get back in. It started with get back in
[52:41] step and restoration. And so when we
[52:44] seen uh some test I guess I share some
[52:46] testimonies. There's some people who've
[52:48] walked out away who walked away have
[52:50] come in and we just seen a restoration
[52:52] in their lives. We had some meetings in
[52:54] July and um after the meetings um this
[52:57] young lady testif because on Wednesday
[52:59] nights after we have service we have
[53:01] like a testimony like testimony night.
[53:03] So if somebody wants to testify, it
[53:04] could be or a prayer request, you you
[53:06] you you go up and take the microphone
[53:08] and and share. And one of the young
[53:10] ladies said um she she walked away from
[53:12] God and she said during the meetings
[53:14] that God restored her. And it was just
[53:16] such a beautiful a beautiful thing um
[53:19] just to see restoration in this young
[53:21] lady's life and just like a complete 180
[53:23] turn and um just just to see things that
[53:27] you you would never expect or people to
[53:29] walk back in the door you'll never
[53:31] expect. So, it just shows you that God
[53:33] is still in the restoration business.
[53:35] He's still restoring families that I
[53:36] tell you, there's nothing um too hard
[53:39] for God to restore. Nothing too hard.
[53:42] You could give me the craziest situation
[53:44] and God can still restore. And and and I
[53:47] love how how how God works. Um because
[53:50] when brother Brandon read that
[53:52] scripture, that's what the whole
[53:53] ministry is about restoration and get us
[53:55] back to who? Christ.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; And that's the most important thing is
[53:59] Christ. that that I can do all things
[54:01] through Christ who strengthen me. And
[54:03] God wants to restore each one of us.
[54:04] Whether it's it could be anything.
[54:06] Whatever is in your life, God is trying
[54:07] to restore. And I always think ask God
[54:11] big things. Don't just ask small things.
[54:13] Ask God big. God God wants to hear the
[54:16] big things that you desire. Now,
[54:18] obviously, we got to make sure that it's
[54:20] with his in his will. Nothing crazy.
[54:23] Nothing crazy, but obviously maybe it's
[54:25] your to see your family walk through the
[54:27] doors or maybe it's to have a deeper
[54:29] walk or or or maybe see restoration in a
[54:31] relationship. Whatever it may be, ask
[54:33] God these things cuz he's still in a
[54:35] restoration business. So, let's go to a
[54:37] familiar story in Exodus 14 9-31.
[54:41] And so, this is so now this is a literal
[54:46] uh a sea that's roaring in in this one.
[54:49] So now this is a just imagine um you
[54:53] just escaping from Egypt and there's
[54:55] literally a sea that is just roaring. If
[54:58] you want to put the scripture up there
[54:59] for me, imagine there's a sea just
[55:01] roaring right there and then right
[55:02] behind you there's horses, chariots and
[55:06] sword. I'll read from I'll read from
[55:07] here. But the Egyptians pursued after
[55:09] them all the horses and chariots of
[55:11] Pharaoh and all the horsemen's and his
[55:13] army and overtook the encamping by the
[55:15] sea be behind Filthroof. Forgive me for
[55:18] these names are hard before Bazoon. You
[55:20] want to go to verse 10 for me? And so
[55:23] just a little backstory before we
[55:24] continue. So um so uh God led the
[55:28] children of Israel out of Egypt, showed
[55:30] many signs and wonders, and we're going
[55:32] to just see how how the people what the
[55:35] reaction is. And when Pharaoh drew nigh
[55:38] to the children of Israel, lifted up
[55:39] their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians
[55:41] marched after them, and they were sore
[55:43] afraid. And the children angel cried out
[55:45] to the Lord. So I I just want to just
[55:48] stop right here real quick. So a lot of
[55:50] times we'll see God come through. Do it
[55:53] again. Do it again. But a lot of times
[55:56] we start crying and forget what God has
[55:59] done.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; In our past.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; I look at David's life. David didn't
[56:03] even have the Holy Ghost. But he could
[56:05] look back and said, "If God had g gave
[56:08] me strength to kill the bearing a lion,
[56:09] I can kill this Goliath." And we have
[56:11] the Holy Ghost. So what excuse do we
[56:13] have? So, we know what God can do. He's
[56:16] done it over and over and over again.
[56:19] All we have to do is remember what his
[56:20] word says. That's why it's so important
[56:22] to read the word of God.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; So important to read the word of God.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; It has all you need in there. It has I
[56:28] don't know how many promises, but it has
[56:30] so many I can't even count.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Has has a has a for each situation you
[56:35] have. You can find it right here. It
[56:37] It's the only book in the world that has
[56:39] an answer for every situation that you
[56:41] have. The only book. And so let's go to
[56:44] verse 11. So we see them just crying and
[56:46] and they said unto Moses, just look at
[56:48] this right here. Because there were no
[56:50] graves in Egypt, has thou taken us away
[56:52] to die in the wilderness? And I would
[56:53] say to them, did you not see what God
[56:56] did? Did you not see how God killed the
[56:59] every firstborn in the land of Egypt?
[57:01] Did you not see when he put locusts and
[57:03] fleas and blood? Did you not see all
[57:06] these things that he did? Did you not
[57:08] see that there was only light in Gan and
[57:10] not light in Egypt? Did you not see
[57:12] these things that God did? And and the
[57:15] thing is like sometimes people just
[57:17] can't catch faith sometimes. Sometimes
[57:20] people get so caught up in in um their
[57:23] their fleshly thoughts, their intellects
[57:25] that they fail to see that God can do it
[57:28] in this situation again. And he said um
[57:31] to die in the wilderness. Bless you.
[57:33] Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us
[57:35] to carry us forth out of Egypt? Verse
[57:37] 12, please. Is it not this the word that
[57:40] we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us
[57:42] alone and and the funny part is that
[57:44] they were crying for deliverance. God
[57:47] said I have heard the cries of my
[57:48] people. Let us alone that we may serve
[57:51] the Egyptians. The how see how
[57:53] wishywashy they are. See the thing is
[57:55] sometimes human beings we want
[57:56] everything to be perfect. Oh I can serve
[57:59] God when everything's all perfect and
[58:00] hunky dory. It doesn't work that way.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; If so everybody would be Christians.
[58:06] Everybody would serve God if it was
[58:08] easy. And it's not an easy thing. For it
[58:10] been better for us to serve the
[58:12] Egyptians that we should die in the
[58:13] wilderness. Verse 13, please. And Moses
[58:16] said unto the people, "Fear ye not, and
[58:19] stand still, and see the salvation of
[58:22] the Lord, which he showed to you today.
[58:24] For the Egyptians who have seen today,"
[58:26] Moses is speaking by faith. I love that.
[58:28] "You shall see them again no more
[58:31] forever." I believe that's inspired. The
[58:32] Lord shall fight for you. And I'll tell
[58:34] you today, the Lord is still fighting
[58:37] for you. Sometimes we try to fight the
[58:39] battle and we get so worn out
[58:41] physically, mentally, and emotionally.
[58:43] It's because you're trying to do God's
[58:45] job. Let God do his job and you do your
[58:48] job. Simple as that. You're not God. You
[58:51] can't change situations. Let God do the
[58:54] changing. Sometimes we we want to change
[58:56] people um based upon our own intellects.
[58:59] No, God has to be the one who does the
[59:01] changing. God can harden and soften
[59:04] hearts. And he said, "The Lord shall
[59:06] fight for you." I right there, that is
[59:08] so much spiritual encouragement that the
[59:10] the Lord loves you so much that he's
[59:13] willing to fight for you and he and you
[59:15] shall hold your peace. Verse 15, please.
[59:17] And the Lord said unto Moses, "Wherefore
[59:20] cry thou to me." I think sometimes there
[59:23] the Bible says there's a time to speak.
[59:25] There's a time to cry. There's a time a
[59:27] lot everything in every season. So, I
[59:28] think a lot of times we we in situations
[59:30] we're we're crying instead of speaking.
[59:33] Speak the word in a situation that
[59:35] there's so much. Speak faith, speak
[59:38] healing, speak whatever need that you
[59:40] have, speak it out into the atmosphere.
[59:42] God loves to be reminded of his word.
[59:44] Remind God of his word. Cuz he told
[59:47] Moses, "Speak unto the children of
[59:49] Israel that they go forward." God never
[59:51] tells us to look back and go backwards.
[59:53] He says, "Move forward." God is always
[59:56] telling us. He said, "Put your hand in
[59:57] the plow and move forward." And so, but
[1:00:00] thou lift up thy rod and stretch forth
[1:00:02] out thy hand over the sea and divide it,
[1:00:05] and the children of Israel go on dry
[1:00:07] ground through the midst of the sea.
[1:00:09] Verse 17.
[1:00:11] And I beheld, I will, and behold, I will
[1:00:13] harden the hearts of the Egyptians.
[1:00:15] Look, God hardened. And they shall
[1:00:17] follow them, and I will get me honor
[1:00:19] upon Pharaoh and upon all the hosts, and
[1:00:21] upon his chariots, and upon his
[1:00:23] horsemen.
[1:00:24] And the Egyptians shall know that I am
[1:00:26] the Lord, when I have gotten me honor
[1:00:29] upon Pharaoh, and upon his chariots, and
[1:00:30] upon his horsemen. Verse 19, and the
[1:00:33] angel of God, which went before the camp
[1:00:34] of Israel. I want to tell you this, the
[1:00:37] angel is a camped around those that fear
[1:00:40] the Lord. Angels are camped around. God
[1:00:45] will send his angel before you to fight
[1:00:47] the battle for you. Remove and went
[1:00:51] behind them. and the pillar of the cloud
[1:00:53] went before their face and stood behind.
[1:00:54] I want to point this out that they they
[1:00:56] literally seen all this with their eyes.
[1:00:59] All of this and yet when it when if you
[1:01:03] if you if you've ever finished reading
[1:01:04] Exodus and Deuteronomy, you'll see that
[1:01:06] they do the same thing over and over and
[1:01:09] over again. It's like what more do you
[1:01:12] guys need to see? A brazen serpent, um
[1:01:15] grapes in the land of Canaan, um bread
[1:01:18] falling from heaven. And you see how
[1:01:20] history repeats itself. The same thing
[1:01:22] I'm getting off my notes. The same thing
[1:01:24] you see when Jesus came in flesh that he
[1:01:27] had 70 disciples and they literally
[1:01:30] could cast out demons, heal the sick.
[1:01:32] They they saw Jesus b break bread um
[1:01:36] twice fishes, multiply all these things.
[1:01:39] But yet when it came time to the
[1:01:40] showdown, they literally turned away.
[1:01:44] And to me it's like
[1:01:47] what do you guys miss? No man has ever
[1:01:49] done this before. No man in the history
[1:01:52] of history has ever done this before.
[1:01:55] And you're willing to walk away from all
[1:01:57] of this. I understand you don't
[1:01:58] understand it. But the thing is, are you
[1:02:01] willing to to separate forever from God?
[1:02:04] And so a lot of people would do the
[1:02:06] history always repeats itself. If Jesus
[1:02:08] came today, they do the same thing even
[1:02:11] not worse because at least at least
[1:02:12] Jesus said about the Pharisees, lest
[1:02:14] your righteousness exceed the Pharisees.
[1:02:16] to the Pharisees has some sort of
[1:02:18] righteousness. They they live clean
[1:02:20] lives cuz now today you have pastors um
[1:02:25] gay pastors, homosexual, all these
[1:02:27] things you have in the ranks. He's like
[1:02:29] like how are we getting these things?
[1:02:30] Like Jesus never allowed these things.
[1:02:33] Not one bit. You got women preachers,
[1:02:35] all these things that they're allowing.
[1:02:38] At least when the Pharisees, they had
[1:02:39] some sort of um some sort of holiness.
[1:02:42] you could say they they actually cared
[1:02:44] about uh even in the priesthood when you
[1:02:47] were a high priest you had to make sure
[1:02:49] that your life was clean cuz if your
[1:02:52] life was not clean you would die in the
[1:02:54] presence of God. That's why they tied
[1:02:55] little bells and pomegranates. And now
[1:02:57] today people who step behind the pulpit
[1:02:59] they live any kind of lie that it' be
[1:03:01] pastors sleeping women in the church.
[1:03:03] It's like where's this stuff even in the
[1:03:05] scripture? Like can you give me some
[1:03:06] scripture for this please? and the and
[1:03:09] they're going to have to obviously pay
[1:03:10] for it. But the thing is I I just don't
[1:03:13] like to see that the that the church
[1:03:15] world is becoming so loose and so laxed.
[1:03:18] That's why we have so many issues in the
[1:03:19] world today. And a lot of people turn
[1:03:21] away from church because they're hurt or
[1:03:23] because they've been taught wrong. And
[1:03:26] um anyways, getting off my notes, let's
[1:03:27] let's continue back in verse 19. And the
[1:03:29] angel of God which went before the camp
[1:03:31] of Israel removed went behind them and
[1:03:33] the pillar of fire and the cloud from
[1:03:35] before their face and stood behind them.
[1:03:37] Verse 20, please. And it came between
[1:03:39] the camp of the Egyptians and the camp
[1:03:40] of Israel. And it was a cloud and
[1:03:43] darkness to them, but it gave light to
[1:03:45] night to these so that the one came not
[1:03:47] near the other all night. The next
[1:03:49] verse, please. And Moses stretched out
[1:03:51] his hand over the sea, and the Lord
[1:03:53] caused the sea to go back by a strong
[1:03:55] east wind all that night, and made the
[1:03:57] the dry land, and the waters were
[1:03:59] divided. Go to verse 22. And the
[1:04:02] children of Israel went in the midst of
[1:04:03] the sea, upon the dry ground, the waters
[1:04:05] were a wall upon them on their right
[1:04:08] hand, and on their left hand. Verse 23.
[1:04:11] And the Egyptians pursued and went in
[1:04:13] after them to the midst of the sea, even
[1:04:15] all of Pharaoh's horses, and his
[1:04:17] chariots and his horsemen. So, I want
[1:04:18] you to notice that
[1:04:20] the children of Israel did not have to
[1:04:22] do anything. They didn't have to fight.
[1:04:24] They didn't have to no swords, no
[1:04:26] nothing. God is literally showing them,
[1:04:28] I can fight your battle. I can I will
[1:04:31] protect you. I will supply your needs.
[1:04:34] Matthew 6:33. And the Egyptians pursued
[1:04:37] and went in after them the midst of the
[1:04:38] sea. And it came to pass that in the
[1:04:40] morning watch the Lord looked upon the
[1:04:42] host of the Egyptians to the pillar of
[1:04:43] fire and the clouds and trouble the host
[1:04:45] of the Egyptians. Verse 25. and took off
[1:04:48] their chariot wheels that they drove
[1:04:50] them heavily. So the Egyptians said,
[1:04:51] "Let us flee from the face of Israel.
[1:04:53] The Lord fightth, look at that, they
[1:04:55] even recognized, for the Lord fightth
[1:04:58] for them against even their enemies
[1:05:00] recognize that God was fighting for
[1:05:02] them." Verse 26. So even your enemies
[1:05:05] will recognize when God is fighting for
[1:05:08] you. So when you let go and stop trying
[1:05:10] to do God's job, even your enemies will
[1:05:13] recognize that God is fighting for you.
[1:05:17] I I I something I remember um brother
[1:05:19] Jack said cuz sometimes maybe if you
[1:05:22] work in uh retail, whatever you work at,
[1:05:24] you have bosses and employees. Sometimes
[1:05:27] there's some Sauls there. Some Sauls,
[1:05:29] they just hate you for no reason. I
[1:05:31] don't know why, but they just hate you.
[1:05:34] You could be the a good worker, whatever
[1:05:36] you are, they just hate you. I remember
[1:05:38] he said this statement. He said, "Let
[1:05:39] God kill Saul." And the thing is, let
[1:05:42] God handle that. Don't you get all been
[1:05:44] out of shape. He's there for a reason.
[1:05:46] That Saul is there for a reason and it's
[1:05:48] to build you. Don't start complaining
[1:05:51] about him. He's there for a reason. So,
[1:05:53] we don't realize that God puts us in
[1:05:54] certain places, puts people in certain
[1:05:56] positions for a reason to to build us,
[1:05:59] to test us. And and and I've had
[1:06:02] situations like that. And you know what
[1:06:03] happens? We let God do it. God will move
[1:06:05] them. God God will do God will do his
[1:06:07] job. And so instead of us always trying,
[1:06:10] see, we're so used to because this world
[1:06:13] gets so easily defended, always
[1:06:15] complaining, and we can't do what the
[1:06:17] world does. God God didn't call us to
[1:06:19] murmur and complain. In fact, the Bible
[1:06:21] tells us not to murmur and complain cuz
[1:06:24] we see what they're the children of
[1:06:25] Israel did. They were murmuring and
[1:06:27] complaining even though God was
[1:06:28] supplying the whole time. And the Lord
[1:06:30] said unto Moses, "Stretch out the hand
[1:06:32] over the sea, and the waters may come up
[1:06:34] against the Egyptians, upon their
[1:06:35] chariots, upon the horsemen." Verse 27.
[1:06:38] And Moses stretched his hand over the
[1:06:39] sea, and the sea returned to his
[1:06:41] strength. And the morning appeared, and
[1:06:42] the Egyptians fled against, and the Lord
[1:06:44] overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of
[1:06:46] the sea. Verse 29, if you want to go for
[1:06:48] me, one more. One more verse. Verse 29.
[1:06:52] But the children of Israel walked upon
[1:06:53] dry land in the midst of the sea, and
[1:06:55] the waters were a wall unto them on
[1:06:56] their right hand, on their left hand.
[1:06:58] Verse 30.
[1:07:00] And thus the Lord saved Israel that day
[1:07:02] out of the hand of the Egyptians, and
[1:07:03] Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the
[1:07:06] sea. And then verse 31, and that'll be
[1:07:08] the last verse. And Israel saw the great
[1:07:10] work which the Lord did upon the
[1:07:11] Egyptians. So you'll think right there
[1:07:14] that would just increase their faith
[1:07:15] right there that from this moment now,
[1:07:17] they'll just walk into the promised land
[1:07:19] with faith. But no, it didn't. And so I
[1:07:23] I I think we could learn from this story
[1:07:25] that if God could do all this for them,
[1:07:28] he could do the same thing for you.
[1:07:31] Because the title of the sermon, though
[1:07:32] the seas may roar, the sea was roaring
[1:07:34] right in front of them. And what did God
[1:07:36] do? He calmed it. He opened it. They
[1:07:40] walked through. And I believe all of us
[1:07:41] have had a Red Sea experience. Or maybe
[1:07:43] we're having one right now. And I'll
[1:07:45] tell you this by eyes of faith that God
[1:07:47] will get you through. He's the same God
[1:07:50] that opened the Red Sea for the children
[1:07:52] of Israel. He's Jesus Christ the same
[1:07:54] yesterday, today, and forever. He's
[1:07:56] going to supply every need. And don't
[1:07:59] just focus on the physical spirit. Don't
[1:08:01] just focus on the um the physical and
[1:08:03] the material needs. Focus on the
[1:08:05] spiritual needs because that's the
[1:08:07] that's that's the most important thing
[1:08:09] in this world because money will come
[1:08:11] and go. The Bible says money has wings.
[1:08:14] Things will come and go. Cars will break
[1:08:15] down. All these things. But I tell you
[1:08:17] one thing, God will never break down.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; He He's He's He's He said, "I change
[1:08:22] not." So, we can have confidence that
[1:08:24] God will not change. He He loves you. He
[1:08:28] cares about you. He's your fortress.
[1:08:30] He's your strong tower. He's your
[1:08:31] refuge. He's your rock. He's all those
[1:08:34] things. No, we cannot say no, no one
[1:08:37] person can be all those things but God
[1:08:39] himself. But God himself. Let me get
[1:08:42] back to my notes.
[1:08:44] All right. Um, so let's go to uh Joshua
[1:08:46] 10:1.
[1:08:48] I'm actually turn there myself.
[1:08:51] Get there. One second.
[1:08:59] Second. Verse 10 and one. Okay.
[1:09:03] So it says, "Now it came to pass when
[1:09:06] Anzekiah, king of Jerusalem, had heard
[1:09:08] how Joshua had taken Ai and utterly
[1:09:10] destroyed it as he had done to Jericho
[1:09:12] and her king. So he had done to Ai her
[1:09:14] king and bless you." And how the
[1:09:16] inhabitants of Gibian had made peace
[1:09:18] with Israel were among them. That they
[1:09:20] feared greatly because Gibian was a
[1:09:22] great city as one of the royal cities
[1:09:24] because it was greater than I. Ai, and
[1:09:27] all the men thereof were mighty.
[1:09:29] Wherefore Hezekiah, king of Jerusalem,
[1:09:31] set upon uh sent unto him home king of
[1:09:34] Heram, and upon these sometime these
[1:09:36] names a little hard, Pyram king of
[1:09:38] Geroth, and upon Jippa, king of Lakish,
[1:09:41] and upon Derbick, king of Iligon,
[1:09:44] saying, "Come unto me and help me that
[1:09:45] we may smite Gibian, for it have made
[1:09:47] peace with with Joshua, with the
[1:09:49] children of Israel." So, I I want you I
[1:09:51] want to point this out. So, the en their
[1:09:54] enemies are plotting against Joshua. So
[1:09:57] the devil is always looking to plot
[1:10:00] against us. In fact, he's constantly
[1:10:02] looking how he can throw traps when
[1:10:05] you're sleeping. He's thinking of ways
[1:10:07] he can get you to disbelieve God. And so
[1:10:10] I love this thing is we got to know our
[1:10:11] enemy. We got to know how he comes. He's
[1:10:14] going to come the same way he came to
[1:10:15] Eve. Same way he came to everyone in the
[1:10:18] Bible, Samson, wherever it may be, he's
[1:10:19] going to come the same way. So we got to
[1:10:21] recognize how he comes. If we recognize
[1:10:24] how the enemy works, then guess what's
[1:10:25] going to happen? He's going to have a
[1:10:27] hard time. Cuz my Bible, our Bible tells
[1:10:30] us in Ephesians 6:10, we need a full
[1:10:32] armor of God. If we got the full armor
[1:10:34] of God on, the devil can't penetrate.
[1:10:37] Anytime a demon came in the presence of
[1:10:40] Jesus Christ, what happened? What
[1:10:42] happened?
[1:10:45] The what? The demon bowed down in fear
[1:10:48] and crowing every single time in the
[1:10:50] presence of Jesus Christ. So if we're in
[1:10:52] the presence of Jesus Christ, I mean, in
[1:10:54] the presence of Jesus Christ, the devil
[1:10:56] is powerless. I think brother Brandham
[1:10:57] said, "Get to a point where the devil
[1:10:58] don't know what to do with you." So, and
[1:11:01] we can all get to a point like that.
[1:11:02] It's hard, but it's possible. It's
[1:11:05] possible. And we got to say boo back to
[1:11:07] the devil, cuz the devil is constantly
[1:11:09] trying to scare us all the time. Say boo
[1:11:11] back to the devil. Use the That's why I
[1:11:13] say it's so important. Jesus never had
[1:11:15] to reason with the devil. If you look in
[1:11:17] the the three times that he tempted him,
[1:11:19] Jesus never reasoned with the devil.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "It is written, thou shalt bow
[1:11:25] before me. A men shall not live by bread
[1:11:27] alone." See, the thing is the de what
[1:11:29] the devil wants to do is he wants to get
[1:11:30] you to reason.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; And once he gets you to reason, he has
[1:11:34] you right there. When Eve be because the
[1:11:36] thing is we think sometimes we're
[1:11:38] reading Genesis 3 that is a oneshot
[1:11:41] deal. No, de the devil was working on
[1:11:42] her day by day. Day by day. It's not
[1:11:45] just like a one-shot thing. No, he was
[1:11:46] working on it. And that's what the devil
[1:11:48] tries to do. He tries to chip at you
[1:11:50] over here. Don't let them chip at you.
[1:11:52] You can't stop the thoughts from coming,
[1:11:54] but you can stop them from staying
[1:11:56] there, cuz they're going to come, but
[1:11:58] you have the right to either to accept
[1:12:00] them or kick them out.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Let's go to um we'll read a quote. So,
[1:12:08] God is still God. I love that prophet
[1:12:10] said, "God is still God." God is a God
[1:12:13] that was at Pentecost. God is a God that
[1:12:16] was in the burning bush. God is a God
[1:12:19] that opened the Red Sea. I'm so thankful
[1:12:20] that the prophet helped us to realize
[1:12:22] that the same God was in the Old
[1:12:24] Testament, in the New Testament, is
[1:12:26] still the same God with us today.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; So, we got nothing to fear. We got
[1:12:31] nothing to fear because God is with us.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; God is with his bride. God will take
[1:12:38] care of his little bride. No matter how
[1:12:40] bad it seems it gets, God will take care
[1:12:42] of his little bride
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; because he's in the bride. He can't
[1:12:46] reject his own. He has to take care of
[1:12:49] us because we're part of him. Because he
[1:12:52] loves us. All he asks us is to be
[1:12:54] faithful. That's all he asked us. Be
[1:12:56] faithful. He said, "Love the Lord thy
[1:12:57] God with all thy heart, all thy mind,
[1:12:59] and all thy soul." That's all he's
[1:13:00] asking from us. Um God God has opened
[1:13:04] the Red Sea. What do we care about?
[1:13:06] hydrogen bombs or fallout shelters or
[1:13:08] what more can we make. God is our refuge
[1:13:10] and his strength. A very present in the
[1:13:12] time help in the time of trouble. He's
[1:13:14] still God of Abraham, Isaac, God of
[1:13:17] David. Certainly, he's still God. We
[1:13:19] just want to hear the word. That's what
[1:13:21] we're thankful that we've heard the word
[1:13:23] and found it to be. So, yes, sir. He's a
[1:13:26] rock, a mighty tower. He's a shelter in
[1:13:29] the time of a storm. So, he is our
[1:13:31] shelter. The righteous run into So, the
[1:13:33] I love this one. The righteous runth
[1:13:34] into this tower and are safe. Yes, they
[1:13:37] are safe. That's right. He is on the
[1:13:40] home plate. He's called it safe by the
[1:13:43] supreme judge. That's right. He's that
[1:13:44] he's safe. They that wait upon the Lord
[1:13:47] shall renew their strength.
[1:13:50] And I'll read Joshua 8. And the Lord
[1:13:53] said unto Joshua, fear them not. So this
[1:13:57] is the scripture we're reading. He said,
[1:13:59] "Fear them not, for I have delivered
[1:14:01] them into thy hand. There shall not a
[1:14:04] man of them stand before thee. So God
[1:14:06] has given us confidence that our enemies
[1:14:08] can't defeat us. You know why? Because
[1:14:11] we have the great general, the great
[1:14:12] captain, and he's never lost a battle.
[1:14:16] He's never stried out at home. He home
[1:14:18] run every single time. So like like a
[1:14:20] song CC whining sends never lost a
[1:14:22] battle. He's never lost a battle. So we
[1:14:24] don't have to worry about losing if God
[1:14:27] God has promised a victory every time.
[1:14:30] Deuteronomy 4. So I I was want to
[1:14:33] compare these two scriptures. So this is
[1:14:35] was said to Moses. For the Lord your God
[1:14:37] is he that goeth with you to fight for
[1:14:40] you against your enemies to save you. So
[1:14:42] I love telling the same a similar thing
[1:14:44] to Joshua
[1:14:46] as he did to Moses. So I just love the
[1:14:48] continuity of that God is just giving
[1:14:50] giving them confidence that yes there's
[1:14:52] enemies. Yes, there's obstacles but then
[1:14:56] they can't stand before you because I am
[1:14:57] with you.
[1:15:00] So, I tell you there's going to be How
[1:15:02] much time I got? Okay. I tell you
[1:15:04] there's going to be moments that the
[1:15:05] oceans will roar. Hard times, very
[1:15:08] difficult times. I'm pretty sure if I
[1:15:10] sat all you guys down, we all talked,
[1:15:12] you could always you all tell me this
[1:15:14] time was difficult. This this when I was
[1:15:16] this age, this was difficult. We could
[1:15:17] all we could probably talk for days. You
[1:15:19] know, all the times that we had
[1:15:20] difficult times. There's probably times
[1:15:22] where you felt like you're just
[1:15:23] drowning. Just like drowning like Lord,
[1:15:25] I can't take much more. or like one more
[1:15:27] thing, I'm going to just explode. But
[1:15:29] God is saying, I I will not give you
[1:15:31] more than you can bear.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; You can do this. I'm with you.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; But I tell you, God is right there
[1:15:36] lending a helping hand. Feel like you're
[1:15:38] drowning. God's right there. He's going
[1:15:40] to pull you up like he did Peter. See,
[1:15:42] sometimes what happens is we're walking
[1:15:43] on the water and we look over to the
[1:15:46] Sometimes what we do is we worship the
[1:15:48] problem instead of worshiping God. And
[1:15:51] we're so we're so worried about the
[1:15:53] problem and the issue, we're worshiping
[1:15:54] it. And the thing is, we don't realize
[1:15:56] it. But God said, "Hey, worship me."
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; And that problem will soon pass. I'll
[1:16:01] give you strength. I'll give you wisdom
[1:16:02] to handle this problem.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; So God is letting this happen because he
[1:16:08] knows what he's doing. All these things
[1:16:10] that are happening now, God knows what
[1:16:12] he's doing. All these thing in the world
[1:16:14] that's happening, God knows what he's
[1:16:16] doing. All these things have to happen
[1:16:19] so it can set in place for everything to
[1:16:22] happen like a domino effect. That's why
[1:16:24] these things are happening. See, Russia
[1:16:27] and all these things thinking think
[1:16:28] that, oh, they they're getting over a
[1:16:30] one on God. No, you're falling right
[1:16:32] into God's God's plan just like that.
[1:16:35] And they don't even realize it.
[1:16:38] All we have to do is trust and walk
[1:16:40] forward. Just like Moses, God told
[1:16:42] Moses, we got to speak. Sometimes we got
[1:16:44] to just speak and go forward. You may
[1:16:46] not know how it's going to change,
[1:16:47] what's going to happen. to speak and go
[1:16:50] forward. Cuz go sometimes God gives you
[1:16:53] a word and you don't know how it's going
[1:16:56] to happen. You don't know where it's
[1:16:57] going to happen, but you just got to
[1:16:59] walk in faith knowing that God is going
[1:17:01] to work everything out. Let's go to
[1:17:03] Romans 8:28. I'm pretty sure we can all
[1:17:06] quote this, but let's let's not we're
[1:17:08] going to read the whole 8:28. Some
[1:17:10] people like to stop, but we're going to
[1:17:12] read the whole 28. So it says, "And we
[1:17:16] know that all things work together for
[1:17:17] the good to them." And some people stop
[1:17:19] right there, but let's keep going. That
[1:17:21] love God, okay? To them who are called
[1:17:24] according to his purpose. So that's the
[1:17:28] important part right there. Call if you
[1:17:29] Now, if you go further down, it talks
[1:17:31] about um we go to 29 if you want. We'll
[1:17:33] go to verse 29. For whom he did forno,
[1:17:35] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:17:37] to the image of his son. So now it's
[1:17:40] getting more intimate right there. See,
[1:17:42] we're supposed to be conformed to the
[1:17:44] image of his son, that he may be the
[1:17:46] first um born among many brethren. Verse
[1:17:49] 30, moreover, whom he did predestinate,
[1:17:53] them he also called. Whom he called,
[1:17:55] them he also justified. And who he
[1:17:57] justified, he also glorified. In verse
[1:17:59] 31,
[1:18:01] what shall we say then to these things?
[1:18:03] If God be for us,
[1:18:06] who can be against us? That's fa That's
[1:18:09] a promise right there to each one of us.
[1:18:11] A promise to each one of us. If God is
[1:18:13] for us, who can be against us? No enemy
[1:18:16] can stand. This wasn't on my notes, but
[1:18:19] let's go to Joshua chapter 1. Wasn't on
[1:18:21] my notes, but let's read it.
[1:18:25] So, do Joshua chapter 1, and we'll read
[1:18:27] the um we'll read the first like seven
[1:18:28] verses, I believe. You want to pull that
[1:18:30] up for me. So, now after the death of
[1:18:32] Moses, a servant of the Lord, it came to
[1:18:34] pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua,
[1:18:36] the son of Nun. Moses minister saying
[1:18:39] verse two for me. Moses my servant is
[1:18:41] dead. You notice you notice that God
[1:18:43] doesn't say I want you to mourn. I want
[1:18:45] you to stop. But he said now therefore
[1:18:48] arise. God said let's keep this going.
[1:18:52] Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo
[1:18:52] Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo Mo M Moses was a
[1:18:53] great servant, but we got to keep moving
[1:18:56] on. We got a promise to fulfill. Now
[1:18:59] therefore, arise, go over this Jordan,
[1:19:01] thou and all his people into the land
[1:19:02] which I do give thee, even to the
[1:19:04] children of Israel. Verse three, every
[1:19:06] place that the soul of your foot shall
[1:19:08] shred upon, that have I given unto you,
[1:19:10] has said unto Moses, speaking to us,
[1:19:13] there's so many promises in this book.
[1:19:16] more Holy Ghost for you, more victory
[1:19:19] for you, more whatever whatever you
[1:19:22] desire, more strength. They that wait
[1:19:24] upon the Lord, um more faith, more
[1:19:28] whatever it may be. Every place that the
[1:19:31] soul of your foot shall tread upon, that
[1:19:33] have I given unto you as I said unto
[1:19:35] Moses. Verse four,
[1:19:40] verse four for me. from the wilderness
[1:19:43] unto this Lebanon, even to the great
[1:19:45] river, the river Euphrates. So now I
[1:19:48] want to let's talk of some natural
[1:19:49] things. If God has a job for you, I
[1:19:52] don't care how much the boss hates you.
[1:19:55] If that job is for you, no man can close
[1:19:58] it. No man can close the door. No man
[1:20:00] can open it but God. A house. Brother
[1:20:03] John, they can testify. They had a
[1:20:05] house. They didn't have no money to put
[1:20:07] the house down. But look at the house
[1:20:09] they have. If that house is for you, God
[1:20:11] will open the door. Like this church, if
[1:20:14] that church is for you, no man can stop
[1:20:18] it. So it's just that's how our God
[1:20:20] works. If God has something, a purpose
[1:20:22] for you, whatever it is, mission work,
[1:20:24] whatever it is, opening a church,
[1:20:26] whatever it may be, I don't care if they
[1:20:29] say you can't do this. You don't have
[1:20:30] the money to do this. Okay. Well, God
[1:20:32] does. My father has everything I need,
[1:20:35] so it doesn't matter. It was his
[1:20:37] brother. He was trying to get a house. I
[1:20:40] believe he lives in over in the UK.
[1:20:42] What's my timer? He had a He's trying to
[1:20:45] get a house in the UK and um he had no
[1:20:47] money to really do it. And I'll tell you
[1:20:50] how faithful God is. So, he had this
[1:20:52] friend, I guess, and this this this
[1:20:54] gentleman literally
[1:20:56] I'm not telling the whole testimony, but
[1:20:58] I'm going to give bits and pieces, but
[1:21:00] literally he gave him I'll tell you
[1:21:01] this, an $8,000 $800,000 check for the
[1:21:05] house. Not even joking. That's how God
[1:21:08] can work. And it's many testimonies of
[1:21:10] where people didn't have enough money
[1:21:11] for the church and God just supplies the
[1:21:14] need. So that's how God works. Some
[1:21:16] sometimes we put God in this box like he
[1:21:18] can't supply every need. He said he'll
[1:21:20] supply every need. All you have to do is
[1:21:23] just be faithful to him.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Pay your tithes, offerings. Watch what
[1:21:27] God can do. Your barns will overflow.
[1:21:31] All he asks is 10%. All he asks is
[1:21:33] offerings. Just just do these things and
[1:21:37] watch. I can testify God has God will
[1:21:40] bless a faithful tithe payer, a faithful
[1:21:42] offering. He will do it. I promise you.
[1:21:44] And these people who got the got these
[1:21:46] blessings, guess what?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Faithful.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; From the wilderness of the Lebanon, even
[1:21:52] unto the great river, the great river
[1:21:53] Euphrates, the land of the high tites
[1:21:55] unto the great sea toward the going down
[1:21:57] of the sun shall be your coast. Verse 5,
[1:22:00] there shall not any man be able to stand
[1:22:04] before thee all the days of thy life. As
[1:22:07] I was with Moses, Saul be with thee, I
[1:22:10] will not fail thee. Say it with me. Nor
[1:22:14] forsake thee. I will not fail thee, nor
[1:22:19] forsake thee. I don't care how big the
[1:22:22] Goliath is. I don't care how big the
[1:22:25] situation is. Guess what? The bigger it
[1:22:28] is, the harder it would fall in the
[1:22:30] presence of God every single time. Verse
[1:22:33] six, be strong. It's talking unto us.
[1:22:37] And of good courage, for unto this
[1:22:39] people shall shall divide for
[1:22:41] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[1:22:43] their fathers to give them. Verse 7.
[1:22:48] Only be thou strong and very courageous
[1:22:50] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:22:52] to all
[1:22:55] all the law. Not just what you feel like
[1:22:59] doing. Give God all
[1:23:02] which Moses my servant commanded thee.
[1:23:05] Don't say, "Oh, I I can't afford this.
[1:23:07] Oh, I can't do this." God gave it all
[1:23:10] for you. You can't just give the little
[1:23:12] he's asking for us. He ain't asking for
[1:23:14] a lot. He ain't asking for a lot. He's
[1:23:17] asking for the simple things which mo
[1:23:20] he's just asking for you. Moses, my
[1:23:23] servant, command thee, turn not from it
[1:23:25] to the right hand or to the left, that
[1:23:27] thou mayest prosper whatsoever thou
[1:23:29] goest. Verse eight,
[1:23:33] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:23:34] out of thy mouth. It's so important to
[1:23:36] read. Get familiar with the word. In
[1:23:38] fact, get get familiar with the author.
[1:23:42] But thou shalt meditate therein day and
[1:23:44] night. Thou mayest observe to do
[1:23:46] according to all that is written
[1:23:48] therein. For then thou shalt make I lost
[1:23:52] my place. Thou it is written. For then
[1:23:55] thou shalt make thy way prosperous and
[1:23:56] then thou shalt have good success.
[1:23:58] There's another verse. Verse 9.
[1:24:00] Have not I commanded thee? If you notice
[1:24:03] how many times he said be strong and of
[1:24:05] good courage. He mentioned I think
[1:24:07] almost three times. Good courage. Be not
[1:24:10] afraid. He's trying to imagine us. He's
[1:24:12] trying to not he's trying to show us how
[1:24:14] how God is trying to show us who he is.
[1:24:17] Neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[1:24:19] thy God is with thee whatsoever thou
[1:24:21] goest. So he's trying to do is he's
[1:24:23] trying to increase our faith and saying
[1:24:25] there is nothing too big or too small
[1:24:27] for me to handle just trust me. Is there
[1:24:30] another verse? Is there verse 10?
[1:24:33] Then Joshua commanded the officers of
[1:24:35] the people saying verse 11
[1:24:38] pass through the host and command the
[1:24:39] people saying prepare your vehicles for
[1:24:41] within three days you shall pass over
[1:24:43] this Jordan to go in the possess the
[1:24:45] land which the Lord your God uh giveth
[1:24:48] you to possess it. So today our land is
[1:24:50] what the Holy Ghost. There's more for us
[1:24:52] to possess. There's a deeper walk for us
[1:24:55] to possess. There's more of Christ for
[1:24:57] us to possess. He wants to live in you
[1:25:00] fully. more in you. Actually, I should
[1:25:02] say there's there's doors there's
[1:25:04] there's doors in your heart that you
[1:25:05] have not opened for him to gain access.
[1:25:08] Open those doors. I know sometimes it's
[1:25:11] hard to open those doors, but as soon as
[1:25:13] you open the doors, the more Christ you
[1:25:15] can have, the more victory that you can
[1:25:18] have. In closing,
[1:25:21] I'm going read.
[1:25:24] Okay, I'm going read Hebrews 4:12 and
[1:25:28] then I'm going to close. Hebrews 4:12.
[1:25:30] For the word of God is quick and
[1:25:33] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:25:37] sword, piercing even to the dividing
[1:25:39] ascender of soul and spirit and of the
[1:25:42] joints and marrow and is discerner of
[1:25:44] the thoughts and intents of the heart.
[1:25:48] So I want you to know that even Jesus
[1:25:50] said heaven and earth will pass away but
[1:25:52] his word will not. They asked a prophet
[1:25:55] where you want to be when the bombs are
[1:25:58] in the word. Because the word cannot
[1:26:00] pass away. This word is forever settled
[1:26:03] in heaven. Line upon line, precept upon
[1:26:05] precept. This word has been proven time
[1:26:08] and time again through every age,
[1:26:11] through every walk of believer's life.
[1:26:14] It's been proven time and time again.
[1:26:16] There's no book that has life like this.
[1:26:20] No, you you can give me every self self
[1:26:22] book you want, every manual, whatever
[1:26:24] you want, but this is the only book is
[1:26:27] that's going to take you to a rapture.
[1:26:29] Only book. Only book is going to take
[1:26:31] you to a rapture. No other book that
[1:26:33] there's a lot of good books that people
[1:26:35] write about God, but it's not like this
[1:26:37] book. And I'm not saying you can't read
[1:26:39] other books. I'm not saying that. What
[1:26:40] I'm just saying is that this book has an
[1:26:43] answer to everything that you have a
[1:26:45] question of. If you have if you have a a
[1:26:46] Bible question, there's a Bible answer.
[1:26:48] So just in closing, let's let's rise to
[1:26:50] our feet and uh we'll just close in a
[1:26:53] word of prayer.
[1:26:57] Dear heavenly father,
[1:27:00] we just count it such an honor and a
[1:27:02] privilege just to serve you in this day
[1:27:05] and age, Lord, knowing that soon we'll
[1:27:09] be going home. We don't know how soon it
[1:27:10] may be, Lord, but Lord, we know, Father,
[1:27:14] that that we see the signs of the time.
[1:27:17] We see the world just in complete chaos
[1:27:20] and complete craziness, Lord. But,
[1:27:23] Father, you're still God and God alone.
[1:27:26] You're still on the throne. You're still
[1:27:28] mediating. You're still calling men and
[1:27:30] women to repentance, Lord. And, Father,
[1:27:34] I'm We all can say that we need a deeper
[1:27:36] walk with you. We all can say that we
[1:27:39] need a a refilling, a renewing, a
[1:27:41] revival, Lord, in in inside of us, Lord.
[1:27:44] Father, may you come right now, Lord,
[1:27:46] and just renew our strength, Lord. Just
[1:27:49] increase our faith, Lord. Just move in
[1:27:52] our midst. We all have needs. We all
[1:27:54] have unspokens. Lord, come and just show
[1:27:57] each one of us, Lord, who you are in a
[1:27:59] deeper, more per deeper, more personal
[1:28:01] way. Father, we want to just walk with
[1:28:04] you, Lord Jesus, like we never walked
[1:28:06] before. We want to pray like we never
[1:28:08] prayed before. We want to have faith
[1:28:10] like we never had faith before. We want
[1:28:12] revelation like we never have revelation
[1:28:14] before. Father, may you open the windows
[1:28:16] of heaven, Lord. Each time we would hit
[1:28:18] our knees, may we just enter into the
[1:28:20] presence of May we just strive to enter
[1:28:23] into your presence. Each time we read
[1:28:25] the word, let us just see you in every
[1:28:27] line, every phrase in each scripture,
[1:28:29] Lord. Father, from this day forth, Lord,
[1:28:33] let us not forget that even though the
[1:28:35] oceans may roar, you are right there
[1:28:37] holding our hand. You are right there
[1:28:40] fighting that battle, Lord. All we have
[1:28:42] to do is walk in faith. All we have to
[1:28:44] do is just fight. Take our sword out and
[1:28:47] just cut away at Goliath, Lord. And
[1:28:49] Father, we thank you for all things,
[1:28:51] Lord. Just knowing that, Father, you are
[1:28:54] all we need. And we ask all these things
[1:28:56] in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Certainly appreciate you, brother. Amen.
[1:29:09] Amen.
[1:29:11] How many you love the word?
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:15] I believe
[1:29:18] God was in this service. Don't you,
[1:29:20] Sister Linda?
[1:29:22] Amen. I believe there was confirmation.
[1:29:27] And we all have times of our lives being
[1:29:31] an uproar
[1:29:33] and things at home being an uproar,
[1:29:35] things at work being an uproar,
[1:29:39] our finances being an uproar.
[1:29:43] Um,
[1:29:45] but God is our refuge
[1:29:48] and he's our strength. He's a present
[1:29:50] help in a time of need. And I I love the
[1:29:53] idea of building our relationship with
[1:29:56] the Lord when things are are going good
[1:30:00] because eventually things are going to
[1:30:01] go bad.
[1:30:03] We're we're going to we're going to
[1:30:05] enter into another trial. How do we know
[1:30:07] that? Because our life has been full of
[1:30:09] trials.
[1:30:10] And I believe that we've heard a word to
[1:30:14] encourage us today that that God is
[1:30:18] going to see us through. And so we want
[1:30:21] to take this word home with us and and
[1:30:24] remember to to build upon that so we
[1:30:29] don't have to be scared. We can just
[1:30:32] take the land and tell the devil to get
[1:30:35] behind us. Amen. Let's sing. Got any
[1:30:38] rivers?
[1:30:40] Got any rivers?
[1:30:45] God any
[1:30:47] rivers
[1:30:50] you think are uncrossable.
[1:30:56] God any mountain
[1:31:00] you can't tunn through.
[1:31:06] God specializes
[1:31:11] in things thought impossible.
[1:31:17] And he will do
[1:31:20] what no other friend can do.
[1:31:27] [Music]
[1:31:29] Not any rivers
[1:31:33] you think are uncrossable.
[1:31:39] God in any mountains
[1:31:43] you cannot
[1:31:45] tunnel through.
[1:31:50] specializes
[1:31:54] in things thought impossible.
[1:31:59] And he will do
[1:32:03] what no other friend can do. One more
[1:32:08] time.
[1:32:11] Not any
[1:32:13] rivers
[1:32:15] you think are uncrossable,
[1:32:21] God. Many
[1:32:23] mountains
[1:32:25] you cannot
[1:32:27] tunnel through.
[1:32:31] God specializes
[1:32:35] in things thought impossible.
[1:32:41] And he will do
[1:32:45] what no other friend can do.
[1:32:51] [Music]
[1:32:53] Amen. How great is our God?
[1:32:59] Amen.
[1:33:01] How great is our God?
[1:33:07] How great is his word?
[1:33:12] He's the greatest one
[1:33:16] that ever was heard.
[1:33:21] He rolled back the water
[1:33:26] of the mighty Red Sea
[1:33:31] and he said, "I will lead you.
[1:33:36] Put your trust in me."
[1:33:41] How great is our God?
[1:33:46] How great is his word?
[1:33:50] He's the greatest one
[1:33:55] that ever was heard.
[1:34:00] He rode back the waters
[1:34:05] of the mighty Red Sea.
[1:34:09] And he said, "I will lead
