[30:43] to be instant in season out of season
[30:46] reprove rebuke exhort with all

[30:51] amen that's the right spirit and
[30:53] doctrine
[30:54] for the time will come
[30:57] when people will not endure sound
[30:59] doctrine anymore
[31:01] but after their own desires shall they
[31:03] heap to themselves a certain type of
[31:05] preacher
[31:07] that will speak to them exactly what
[31:09] they want to hear
[31:11] and they shall turn their ears from the
[31:13] truth
[31:14] and shall be turned unto fables
[31:17] but watch thou on all things in your
[31:19] afflictions
[31:20] do the work of evangelists make full
[31:23] proof of thy ministry

[31:44] give me at that day

[32:35] i don't get everything
[32:38] is it ready oh yeah let's do it so when
[32:42] you don't fully understand
[32:43] why brother john chose a certain color
[32:46] for the walls over there
[32:56] i had brother george
[32:58] pick out the color paint
[33:00] i wanted him to be a part of it
[33:04] but he brought a real good point
[33:06] and this point is
[33:08] we don't know everything that's behind
[33:11] what we see
[33:14] and the advice that not brother george
[33:16] gave us but that god
[33:18] gave us through his servant
[33:20] big difference wasn't the opinion of a
[33:23] man it was god speaking to us how we
[33:26] need to conduct ourselves amen just want
[33:29] to finish it
[33:31] when you don't understand an issue or
[33:33] something that's going on be careful
[33:36] it could be part of a bigger picture
[33:37] it's there for a reason or not right and
[33:39] god allows these scenes to play out in
[33:42] order to bring our reactions to the
[33:44] surface
[33:46] be careful
[33:48] god has not called me or any of you to
[33:50] straighten everything out that's right
[33:53] years ago when i was working over the
[33:55] jeffersonville with billy paul you're
[33:57] 75 way back there someplace
[34:00] so i forget what was going on i said you
[34:02] know what billy if i was god i just
[34:13] amen
[34:14] god is in control we have to trust god
[34:18] we know
[34:19] that we
[34:20] all make mistakes on a daily basis
[34:23] so if we're making them that means the
[34:25] others that we're
[34:26] around are going to be making them right
[34:29] what we probably lack a lot is praying
[34:32] one for another that's what we're really
[34:34] lacking that's really what god wants us
[34:35] to do but i really appreciated
[34:38] the message
[34:40] uh that
[34:41] uh brother george brought to us and uh
[34:45] really down to earth just
[34:48] simple
[34:49] but yet profound
[34:53] and
[34:55] this evening we want to talk about
[34:57] finishing our course because
[34:59] we're near the end
[35:01] we're at the coming of the lord
[35:04] and uh we're all in a race
[35:06] and uh
[35:08] we all want to finish the course with a
[35:10] good fight
[35:12] and we want to keep the faith
[35:15] and uh just thinking about that crown of
[35:18] righteousness
[35:20] i don't know but i just
[35:22] i have a thought
[35:25] that
[35:27] everybody's going to have a crown there
[35:28] but it's going to be different
[35:32] of course it's all going to be attached
[35:33] with eternal life but somehow brother
[35:36] branham taught us
[35:38] that every soul is going to be attached
[35:40] to us
[35:42] and i do believe that some of the crowns
[35:44] are going to be brighter than others
[35:48] and um
[35:50] um
[35:54] the more souls
[35:56] that you won i believe you're going to
[35:58] shine like the stars as the bible says
[36:03] and those souls that you win win souls
[36:06] and those souls win souls
[36:08] are going to be attached to your crown
[36:11] but they may be a dimmer light
[36:14] but still attached to your crown
[36:16] do you see and so i want us to get
[36:19] excited about a crown that's bright
[36:22] amen
[36:23] amen and that we have a part to play to
[36:25] get there it's not just oh i hope i make
[36:28] it i'd be honest i don't want to be
[36:29] there with the dull you know my
[36:31] batteries out
[36:32] you know what i mean i want people to
[36:34] know that i worked for the lord
[36:37] that while i was here i did something
[36:40] for the kingdom i won souls because
[36:42] that's all that matters
[36:47] that's what our course is supposed to be
[36:50] when we were born we were born on a
[36:53] course that headed straight to hell
[36:57] we were wild by nature
[36:59] we were just saying and doing anything
[37:01] we wanted to do ephesians 2 verse 2 says
[37:04] where in times past he walked according
[37:07] to the course of this world
[37:10] according to the prince of the power the
[37:11] heir of the spirit that now worketh in
[37:13] children in the children of disobedience
[37:16] among whom also we all
[37:19] had our conversations in
[37:21] times past in the lust of the flesh and
[37:24] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[37:26] of the mind and were by nature the
[37:29] children of wrath even as others so we
[37:31] were on the course of this world
[37:36] and even though we were fulfilling the
[37:38] desires of the flesh and of the mind we
[37:41] were by nature the children are even as
[37:43] other the bible says we're actually
[37:45] walking according to the course of the
[37:47] prince of the power
[37:49] of the air amen so we thought it was we
[37:52] were doing our will doing our thing but
[37:54] we really weren't right
[37:55] we were doing exactly what satan wanted
[37:57] us to do
[37:59] the thing is
[38:00] he was
[38:01] he was using our desires to get what he
[38:04] wanted
[38:05] right
[38:06] the devil was actually directing our
[38:08] course to the channel of our own will
[38:11] and we didn't know it
[38:14] was right
[38:15] that's why hey whatever you want have a
[38:17] good one whatever it is
[38:21] it's that's the broad way
[38:25] it didn't matter if you went this way or
[38:27] that way you were still doing your will
[38:30] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[38:33] great love wherewith he loved us
[38:37] he got our attention and he let us know
[38:39] that we were headed straight to hell
[38:42] and he told us he provided a way for us
[38:44] at calvary
[38:47] amen
[38:48] all we had to do was surrender our will
[38:51] over to god amen
[38:53] repent for our hideous selfish attitude
[38:57] amen
[38:58] and get baptized in the name of jesus
[39:00] christ
[39:01] and start on a new course of life amen
[39:06] this is god's course for our lives
[39:09] now it's vital to get a clear
[39:11] revelation of what this course really is
[39:16] too many people have misinterpreted
[39:18] their course
[39:20] right
[39:21] there are some who keep on living
[39:24] according to their own will and their
[39:26] own desires thinking they're on the
[39:28] course of life
[39:32] jesus expressed that there were two
[39:35] courses that we could take one was a oh
[39:37] it started out with a wide gate a broad
[39:39] way it was easy to travel
[39:42] and you could just do your own will
[39:45] and satan encourages the human race to
[39:48] take it to take that course
[39:50] it's a course that really everybody's
[39:52] started on but but jesus told us that
[39:55] the end of that course is destruction
[39:58] amen and he told us about the correct
[40:01] course for our lives
[40:03] that we have to get off the first one to
[40:06] get on the right one amen
[40:08] and it's a real straight
[40:11] and narrow
[40:13] path
[40:16] and we we've often heard it when people
[40:18] say you're you know you're you've heard
[40:20] you're narrow-minded
[40:22] you need to open up a little bit
[40:24] well many people when you preach the
[40:26] gospel from cover to cover of what it
[40:28] says exactly what we need to do it's
[40:31] looked at as being narrow-minded let's
[40:33] find a church that we can kind of do
[40:34] what we want to do
[40:40] you can see that satan is incur satan is
[40:42] in the churches
[40:44] right it's true
[40:46] god is in his word i remember just being
[40:48] a a kid and god was dealing with my
[40:51] heart and i was trying to find the right
[40:53] church and god said i'm not in the
[40:55] church i'm in my word and i've never
[40:58] never forgotten that
[41:00] satan is allowed to go to church
[41:03] that's why we can sit in church and have
[41:04] all these mind battles what's going on
[41:07] satan is trying to keep us from the word
[41:09] amen
[41:11] now god left us his precious word that
[41:13] we might know the new course of life to
[41:16] follow
[41:17] romans chapter 12 verse 1 says i beseech
[41:20] you therefore brethren by the mercies of
[41:23] god that you present your body
[41:26] a living sacrifice
[41:29] holy and acceptable unto god which is
[41:32] your reasonable service
[41:36] be not conformed to this world but be
[41:38] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[41:40] that you may prove what is that good and
[41:42] acceptable and perfect will of god this
[41:46] is the new course of life for us and god
[41:49] wants us to prove it right
[41:52] to prove around the right course which
[41:54] is the will of god
[41:56] it's not our job it's not our house it's
[41:58] not our vehicle it's not our personal
[42:00] plans for our future
[42:03] it's the will of god amen
[42:05] and we have to present our lives to the
[42:07] will of god
[42:09] for his purpose
[42:11] not for our personal lives
[42:13] now the bare bones reasonable
[42:16] service
[42:18] that's acceptable to god
[42:20] for the new course is to present our
[42:23] body a living sacrifice
[42:26] that's not just come to church twice a
[42:29] week pay your tithes and then do what
[42:31] you want to do
[42:34] unfortunately there's too many that have
[42:36] misinterpreted
[42:38] the course of life that we should be on
[42:40] amen
[42:42] paul had a revelation of his new course
[42:45] of life
[42:46] he helped before he had a real
[42:48] experience with christ he was so puffed
[42:50] up that he wanted to be the absolute
[42:53] best
[42:56] but he learned that he had to forsake it
[42:59] all
[43:00] to gain christ
[43:03] he had to look at himself as to being
[43:05] not the best
[43:07] but the least of all saints amen right
[43:10] as he said
[43:12] paul's new course of life was filled
[43:16] with hardships sufferings afflictions
[43:20] jesus showed him how great things he was
[43:22] going to suffer in his new course of
[43:24] life is that true
[43:26] it seemed like it was really this new
[43:29] course was death
[43:32] in that life
[43:34] because of all the sufferings
[43:36] paul presented his body a living
[43:38] sacrifice to god
[43:41] he had a revelation from jesus what it
[43:43] really meant
[43:45] jesus by revelation i believe told paul
[43:48] to deny himself and to take up his cross
[43:50] daily and follow him
[43:53] in fact he preached it he said i i died
[43:55] daily he must have got the revelation
[43:57] from god amen he didn't say i learned it
[44:00] from any other disciple he said i
[44:02] learned it from no man but i got it from
[44:05] jesus christ himself
[44:07] tell you this even though it's written
[44:09] and it's been preached we need to get in
[44:11] the prayer closet and we need to hear
[44:13] from god ourselves amen amen
[44:17] paul knew the only way that he could
[44:20] that he could save his own life would be
[44:22] to lose it
[44:25] to give it up give it to jesus
[44:27] present it back to god for his eternal
[44:30] purpose on a daily basis
[44:33] not just repent be baptized and then
[44:36] that's all you got to do
[44:39] life has to be changing amen
[44:45] i believe it was this morning early this
[44:47] morning
[44:50] after i got a coffee i was looking at
[44:52] some furniture for the church and i went
[44:54] and looked at it it was used because
[44:56] just trying to save some money
[44:59] and um
[45:01] it was not a good not a good fit for us
[45:04] it was just
[45:05] you rub it and and it was coming off so
[45:07] i knew it was just it was too used i
[45:10] said it was good good deal but not good
[45:12] for us not a good fit for us
[45:15] but as i was leaving i noticed that
[45:16] there was this big tree is about this
[45:19] big in diameter
[45:21] but it was so short it was maybe just
[45:23] from there maybe maybe five feet taller
[45:27] and it just looked odd to me
[45:30] and he said yeah it was about um
[45:34] about 10 years ago it just sprung up on
[45:36] its own and every year i cut it down
[45:38] well it just continued to grow this way
[45:41] instead of that way
[45:43] but if there's the life of christ inside
[45:46] of us we're going to be growing amen
[45:49] amen
[45:50] we're not just going to say i'm in it
[45:53] we've got to grow our life's got to
[45:55] prove it
[45:59] this new course that paul was on it
[46:02] seemed like death
[46:04] but it was really life
[46:06] everywhere he went and everything that
[46:08] he did
[46:09] totally discouraged the flesh it was a
[46:13] decay to the flesh
[46:17] he wrote about in second corinthians
[46:19] chapter 4 verse 7
[46:21] he says but we have this treasure in
[46:24] earthen vessels that the excellency of
[46:26] the power may be of god and not of us
[46:32] he says we are troubled
[46:33] on every side so if i go over here
[46:36] there's trouble if i go over here
[46:38] there's trouble if i go over here
[46:40] there's trouble
[46:42] accept it
[46:44] we lived
[46:45] in trouble
[46:48] yet not distressed
[46:50] perplexed
[46:52] but not in despair
[46:54] persecuted but jesus is still with us
[46:58] we're cast down
[47:00] but we're not destroyed
[47:02] always bearing about in our flesh
[47:07] our body
[47:09] the dying of the lord jesus now how how
[47:12] is that how do i how do i bear in my
[47:14] body of the dying of the lord jesus i do
[47:17] not do my will
[47:21] that's how you bear
[47:22] the dying of christ is when you refuse
[47:25] to do your will
[47:29] that the life also of jesus might be
[47:33] made manifest in our body
[47:35] you can't do your will and god's at the
[47:37] same time now no saint monster wants to
[47:40] get you to believe that but you can't
[47:42] [Music]
[47:45] the only way the life of christ will be
[47:47] manifested in us is when we're willing
[47:49] to die out to our will and it has to be
[47:52] on a daily basis
[47:54] present your body
[47:56] a living sacrifice every day god what
[47:58] would you add me to do don't just say
[48:00] the prayer and then go on with your day
[48:02] don't do that
[48:05] for we which
[48:06] live are always delivered
[48:09] unto the death
[48:11] unto death
[48:12] for jesus sake
[48:15] that the life also of jesus might be
[48:17] made manifest in our mortal flesh
[48:20] manifest in our mortal flesh i want
[48:23] jesus in my mortal flesh
[48:26] the only way is when jesus delivers me
[48:30] unto my death he says
[48:32] this is what i want you to do pray keep
[48:35] my commandments uh reach out first so
[48:38] whatever he's asking me to do i've got
[48:40] to die out to what i want to do and just
[48:42] do what he told me to do amen
[48:46] so then here's the conclusion death
[48:50] works in us
[48:52] but life in you
[48:54] see this this this new course of life
[48:57] it seemed like death
[49:00] but it was really life amen
[49:02] that's right
[49:04] what works in the believer death
[49:07] death to our will it's constantly
[49:09] working on a daily basis
[49:13] we can see the new course of life for
[49:15] paul was a crucified lifestyle
[49:19] you've heard about people having such a
[49:21] a good lifestyle
[49:23] right well paul's lifestyle was a
[49:26] crucified lifestyle
[49:30] that's why we can't allow ourselves to
[49:33] become at ease in zion
[49:37] we've got to make that hard choice
[49:39] every day
[49:40] paul said in galatians chapter 2 verse
[49:42] 20 i am crucified with christ
[49:46] amen i am crucified with christ
[49:50] not just christ
[49:52] was crucified for me
[49:56] but i'm there with him
[49:57] nevertheless i live yet not i but christ
[50:00] liveth in me and the life which i'm now
[50:02] living in my flesh i'm living by the
[50:05] faith of the son of god who loved me and
[50:07] he gave himself for me
[50:09] [Music]
[50:11] paul learned to die daily
[50:14] amen
[50:15] to live
[50:16] that crucified life
[50:18] he was following the instructions that
[50:20] christ gave him to to deny himself daily
[50:24] to pick up his cross and follow him
[50:27] think about this we can all testify of
[50:30] of of of something that we did for the
[50:33] lord at some time
[50:35] but what's being presented to us through
[50:36] this gospel is that we should be
[50:39] daily following the lord
[50:42] daily not weekly
[50:47] doing what we should be doing for the
[50:49] lord every day
[50:50] amen it may just be one person that you
[50:54] reach
[50:56] because god knows you got to work
[50:58] right
[51:00] god knows what you got to do
[51:03] but i'm telling you
[51:04] he also knows
[51:06] that you have a heart that wants to
[51:09] please him
[51:10] or you just have a heart to kind of go
[51:12] the way that you want to go
[51:14] [Music]
[51:18] peter said this new course of life was
[51:21] a calling
[51:23] to suffer
[51:24] amen for jesus he did first peter
[51:27] chapter 2 verse 21 for even herein to
[51:31] were you called
[51:33] because christ also suffered for us
[51:35] leaving us
[51:37] an example
[51:39] that we should follow his steps
[51:42] for what i'm going to go to verse 20 now
[51:44] with this so you can kind of catch it
[51:46] for what glory is that when you're
[51:47] buffing it for your own faults and you
[51:49] take it patiently
[51:50] but if when you're doing the right thing
[51:53] you suffer for it and you take it
[51:56] patiently this is the acceptable and
[51:59] perfect will of god for our lives
[52:04] we don't got like
[52:07] brother george we're saying we don't
[52:08] gotta prove straighten everything out
[52:12] let your life be a manifestation
[52:14] amen
[52:17] this new course of life is really a
[52:20] crucified lifestyle think about it we
[52:23] ought to be living a crucified lifestyle
[52:25] here's the beautiful thing about this
[52:27] brother martin we can be full of joy
[52:29] with a crucified lifestyle
[52:32] amen
[52:35] instead of trying to act like we're
[52:36] really something special in our flesh we
[52:39] need to crucify it
[52:41] first corinthians chapter 2 verse 1.
[52:44] first corinthians chapter 2 verse 1 and
[52:46] our brother when i came to you i came
[52:48] not with excellency of speech or of
[52:51] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[52:55] of god
[52:57] for i am
[52:58] determined
[53:00] not to know anything among you
[53:03] save jesus christ and him crucified amen
[53:07] and i was with you in weakness and in
[53:09] fear and in much trembling
[53:13] and my speech and my preaching
[53:16] was not with enticing words of man's
[53:19] wisdom but in the demonstration of the
[53:23] spirit and the power
[53:27] that your faith
[53:29] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[53:31] but in the power of god how many seen
[53:34] the power of god ministers sunday amen
[53:39] amen
[53:40] the power of god isn't being slain in
[53:42] the spirit
[53:43] dancing in the spirit that's right
[53:46] that's right
[53:47] it could be
[53:50] but don't put god in the box
[53:54] something inside should have been
[53:56] connecting amen that was the power of
[53:58] god
[53:59] he wasn't speaking with man's
[54:02] wisdom or enticing words he wasn't even
[54:04] trying
[54:07] but he said it like it was
[54:11] can you imagine
[54:12] the great theologian paul
[54:15] who was determined not to know anything
[54:18] save christ died
[54:23] i wonder
[54:24] if his sermons became a little boring
[54:27] yeah right a little repetitious
[54:30] the old same old same old
[54:32] christ and him crucified that
[54:34] that's it's all i know
[54:36] sorry
[54:40] paul not only had a revelation of christ
[54:44] suffered for him but he also had a
[54:45] revelation that he was called to suffer
[54:49] in order for others to be saved as well
[54:53] now what's important about that
[54:55] statement is too often we have what we
[54:58] say a revelation that christ suffered
[55:01] for us
[55:03] who am i i'm not worthy
[55:06] but we have no revelation
[55:09] that that same
[55:10] sacrifice
[55:12] was supposed to be lived out through me
[55:14] to to to another soul
[55:17] it's like we we don't capitalize on that
[55:20] revelation because it's filled with
[55:22] responsibility the first one was god's
[55:25] responsibility
[55:30] remember jesus telling ananias
[55:33] that he was going to show paul how great
[55:34] things he must suffer from my name's
[55:37] sake in his new course of life
[55:41] his new course of life that he was he
[55:43] was on
[55:45] paul's ministry was christ and him
[55:48] crucified
[55:49] amen it wasn't a ministry of sermons
[55:52] preached
[55:53] no sir
[55:55] it was a hard rugged life ministry
[56:00] he never compared his sermons with other
[56:02] ministers
[56:03] other disciples whose was better
[56:08] remember paul talking in second
[56:10] corinthians chapter 11
[56:12] verse 23 he said that he labored more
[56:16] abundant
[56:17] than all the other ministers
[56:19] not whose whose sermon was better
[56:22] but who labored more
[56:24] his proof was his stripes he was he had
[56:27] stripes above measure he was in prisons
[56:29] more frequent he was in debts more often
[56:32] it was always about what happened from
[56:35] his ministry
[56:38] it was talking about the results of his
[56:40] ministry what it did
[56:42] what it did towards him
[56:46] and it all
[56:47] was about how much he suffered he was
[56:50] measuring his ministry with other
[56:52] ministers by how much he suffered amen
[56:59] he was beat with rod stone shipwreck in
[57:02] journeyians often in perils of his own
[57:04] countrymen in weariness painfulness
[57:07] watchings often in hunger and thirst and
[57:10] fastings often and cold in nakedness
[57:13] wow
[57:15] all just to get the message out
[57:18] christ died for you
[57:20] that's all i know
[57:21] jesus died for you
[57:26] yeah god gave him an abundance of
[57:29] revelation but you know he never puffed
[57:32] himself up he still preached christ
[57:34] crucified give your heart to god lay
[57:37] down your life for the one who laid down
[57:39] his life for you
[57:42] verse 28 besides those things that are
[57:45] without that which cometh upon me daily
[57:49] and the care of all the churches
[57:52] he said who is weak am i am i not weak
[57:54] who's offended and i burn not
[57:57] if i'm gonna glory
[58:00] in anything in my life
[58:03] it's not gonna be
[58:04] in my sermons about my shermans
[58:08] i will glory of the things which concern
[58:11] my
[58:12] weaknesses
[58:14] my
[58:14] infirmities my sufferings because that's
[58:18] what he called me to do
[58:21] and i'll tell you you want to go get the
[58:22] gospel to somebody it's going to take
[58:24] the height off of you you're going to
[58:26] have to give up your time you're going
[58:27] to give some money you're going to give
[58:29] some reputation you're going to you're
[58:32] going to get turned down and turned down
[58:33] and turned down
[58:38] that's what paul said
[58:40] that's what i'm going to glory in right
[58:42] there
[58:43] that proves that i'm living for god
[58:46] that's proves my ministry
[58:50] not this that and the other
[58:56] second corinthians chapter 12 verse 9
[59:02] it was all about christ being crucified
[59:05] amen
[59:08] paul wanted the same
[59:10] message lived out in his life
[59:15] that jesus lived out in his
[59:22] i don't know how we could sit
[59:26] under
[59:27] a ministry like this
[59:30] and not give more of yourself to christ
[59:36] you'd have to come become hard to the
[59:38] gospel
[59:40] amen
[59:43] and he said unto me
[59:45] my grace
[59:47] is sufficient
[59:49] for my strength is made perfect in
[59:51] weakness that's right
[59:55] i'm able to get something done in your
[59:57] body
[59:58] when you say i can't do nothing
[1:00:01] when you're down when you're against the
[1:00:04] wall you have no
[1:00:06] ability to go do your will
[1:00:10] that's when i can come in and
[1:00:13] become strong in your life because alls
[1:00:15] i'm wanting you to do my my son my
[1:00:18] daughter is say i need you lord i can't
[1:00:22] do it without you
[1:00:25] that's when he can be strong
[1:00:27] most gladly therefore well i rather
[1:00:30] glory in my infirmities
[1:00:33] that the power of christ may rest upon
[1:00:36] me
[1:00:38] not going out there trying to handle
[1:00:41] blaze some new trials
[1:00:46] therefore i take pleasure he said i take
[1:00:48] pleasure
[1:00:49] in infirmities
[1:00:52] we take pleasure and run away from them
[1:00:56] reproaches
[1:00:57] man we run the other way
[1:00:59] in necessities no way i ain't getting
[1:01:01] myself in the spot right need
[1:01:03] and persecutions i know when to stay
[1:01:06] away from not to get persecuted
[1:01:08] just do a little compromising
[1:01:13] in distresses
[1:01:15] for christ's sake for when i am weak
[1:01:18] then i am strong
[1:01:21] he pointed people to everything that he
[1:01:24] suffered because he stood for the for
[1:01:27] calvary
[1:01:30] i think if paul was here today he'd be
[1:01:32] dealing with the same thing doing the
[1:01:34] same thing during the culvert during the
[1:01:35] 21st century right i don't think you'd
[1:01:38] be doing anything different right
[1:01:43] you know the world
[1:01:44] they got to spend a whole time
[1:01:46] compromising with the new
[1:01:48] new stuff yes sir
[1:01:50] give me this old-time religion
[1:01:52] give me this this old way just believing
[1:01:55] in calvary
[1:01:57] this new course of life was completely
[1:02:00] different than paul's old course of life
[1:02:03] yes in the old course of life we ran
[1:02:06] away from our problems
[1:02:08] that weakened us
[1:02:12] but our new course of life we face our
[1:02:15] problems
[1:02:17] we embrace what we have to go through
[1:02:21] we're not afraid
[1:02:23] of what god is leading us to
[1:02:26] he wants us to be a witness he wants us
[1:02:28] to be a testimony he wants us to
[1:02:31] manifest a part of christ that other
[1:02:33] brothers and sisters don't seem to care
[1:02:35] about
[1:02:37] they'd rather just say they're a
[1:02:39] christian without british manifesting it
[1:02:42] and god wants you god wants you to
[1:02:45] manifest the word for this hour
[1:02:49] to stand the test and and and win souls
[1:02:53] regardless of just how busy and corrupt
[1:02:55] this world is
[1:02:58] don't wait for colby to stop
[1:03:02] don't wait for the next presidency
[1:03:05] time is running out we need to be christ
[1:03:07] everybody
[1:03:10] just jump off the diving board and start
[1:03:12] telling somebody about jesus
[1:03:19] this is the hour
[1:03:20] do not wait we got to finish the course
[1:03:26] in the new course of life we have
[1:03:27] learned to embrace the things
[1:03:30] that once we were scared or afraid of
[1:03:33] for when i'm weak then i'm strong it's
[1:03:35] okay for me to get weak it's okay for me
[1:03:38] to get needy it's okay for me to be
[1:03:40] without
[1:03:42] this
[1:03:43] um
[1:03:44] reputation
[1:03:46] amen i don't need a reputation
[1:03:48] i need christ
[1:03:50] i need the love of god in my heart
[1:03:54] remember timothy wasn't really excited
[1:03:57] about this
[1:03:58] rugged
[1:03:59] new course of christianity
[1:04:02] right
[1:04:03] he wasn't excited about the things that
[1:04:06] accompanied a true believer
[1:04:09] like the many persecutions that follow
[1:04:12] when you're living a new godly life
[1:04:17] it'd be better just to kind of hide in
[1:04:19] the background
[1:04:23] i'm glad this is in the bible to let me
[1:04:26] know
[1:04:27] that the things that timothy went
[1:04:29] through we can relate amen
[1:04:33] but paul taught timothy to be a partaker
[1:04:36] of the afflictions of the gospel
[1:04:40] to partake of the afflictions not just
[1:04:42] take the good scriptures that you want
[1:04:44] to get out of there
[1:04:46] not just the promises
[1:04:48] but be a partaker of the afflictions
[1:04:51] or be a partaker of the new manner of
[1:04:54] life this new course of life according
[1:04:57] to the power of god
[1:04:59] it's a new course of life
[1:05:01] with a new purpose than we had before
[1:05:03] before our purpose was just to get
[1:05:05] whatever
[1:05:06] we wanted to get out of life and enjoy
[1:05:09] it and build the future and just have
[1:05:11] you know so many people love us
[1:05:14] now the new course of life is we don't
[1:05:16] care people love us we care that they
[1:05:18] love jesus
[1:05:20] that's what we care about because jesus
[1:05:22] died for me i'm dead
[1:05:25] i'm in debt to him i'm a prisoner of him
[1:05:28] i'm bought by him it's no longer about
[1:05:30] me it's about the one who bought me amen
[1:05:36] this new course of life
[1:05:39] is the token on display amen
[1:05:42] yes it is
[1:05:44] ii timothy chapter 3 verse 10
[1:05:48] but thou
[1:05:49] has fully known my doctrine do people
[1:05:52] fully know your doctrine
[1:05:55] put yourself in here my manner of life
[1:06:00] nothing about how many times we go to
[1:06:01] church
[1:06:03] my manner of life
[1:06:04] my purpose
[1:06:06] my faith
[1:06:08] and my long-suffering
[1:06:10] my charity
[1:06:11] my patience
[1:06:14] my persecutions
[1:06:16] my afflictions
[1:06:19] think about how he's trying to identify
[1:06:23] his manner of life
[1:06:25] his purpose
[1:06:28] my persecutions and afflictions which
[1:06:30] came upon me at anac iconium
[1:06:34] at lystra
[1:06:35] what persecutions i endured
[1:06:38] i mean you could just like magnify them
[1:06:41] it wasn't some little thing he said they
[1:06:43] were mighty persecutions that i endured
[1:06:48] but i love this testimony
[1:06:50] but out of them all the lord delivered
[1:06:52] me
[1:06:54] no you don't have to be afraid of
[1:06:57] persecutions
[1:06:58] if you believe god's with you he will
[1:07:00] deliver you
[1:07:03] you've got to believe it
[1:07:06] you don't have to be bothered don't be
[1:07:08] afraid
[1:07:10] you have to trust god
[1:07:13] he'll see you through he will deliver us
[1:07:17] brother branham conveyed that this new
[1:07:20] course of life as a christian was a very
[1:07:22] difficult it was a very hard way
[1:07:28] it's really
[1:07:30] you've heard this that when we become a
[1:07:32] christian we get baptized we repent and
[1:07:35] we give a heart to god that's when the
[1:07:37] battle really starts you're right
[1:07:41] i've read this quote before but i want
[1:07:42] to read it again because it's in a
[1:07:44] different
[1:07:46] subject a different message a man
[1:07:47] running from the presence of god
[1:07:49] brother brown said christianity thinking
[1:07:52] a new course of life now
[1:07:54] sort of honestly laying the foundation
[1:07:57] and you know me long foundations
[1:08:00] quick little thing at the end right
[1:08:02] christianity is is an every day rugged
[1:08:06] life
[1:08:06] living for god in this present world
[1:08:11] so it didn't stop when covet started
[1:08:15] when we got the new presidency when we
[1:08:16] got all the broadway all the bills nope
[1:08:21] it's an everyday rugged life living for
[1:08:23] god in this present world right
[1:08:26] so what is what is the constant what is
[1:08:28] the constant
[1:08:30] about this
[1:08:31] it's a constant burning of the fire and
[1:08:34] the love of god in the in the heart
[1:08:36] that's what should be constant no matter
[1:08:39] what yes
[1:08:40] i don't care what you're going through i
[1:08:42] don't care what's happening i don't care
[1:08:43] i don't care if the tires are flat
[1:08:47] we lose our job the house burn i don't
[1:08:49] care what happens there needs to be a
[1:08:52] constant fire and burning of the love of
[1:08:55] god in our heart amen
[1:08:57] now what is it there for so we can just
[1:08:59] say we're christian
[1:09:00] no
[1:09:01] no
[1:09:04] that sets you a fire and puts you out
[1:09:08] yonder with people making converts to
[1:09:11] christ
[1:09:14] now to me that is the exact same thing
[1:09:16] that we read in the bible about paul's
[1:09:19] life amen it's true
[1:09:22] but it's to us 21st century
[1:09:25] are we going out do we wake up in the
[1:09:27] morning
[1:09:29] i want to go out and get it
[1:09:31] a convert for christ
[1:09:34] do we even have those thoughts yeah
[1:09:36] right
[1:09:40] do we have that go ye out
[1:09:44] that's right
[1:09:46] to me this is the correct course of life
[1:09:50] right here
[1:09:51] of a christian life
[1:09:53] now he uses the word responsibilities
[1:09:57] in other words it's our responsibility
[1:10:02] remember brothers in our
[1:10:03] men's meeting talking about that one
[1:10:05] word
[1:10:07] he says but it's easy to go the way the
[1:10:09] world goes okay it's easy to flow down
[1:10:11] the stream now that's
[1:10:13] the first course of life that we were
[1:10:14] all born with
[1:10:17] get out there and sit down
[1:10:19] in the river with your boat
[1:10:21] you get your oars and start pulling up
[1:10:23] against the current you don't make much
[1:10:25] time it goes hard
[1:10:28] but you just want let loose of those
[1:10:30] oars and watch how fast
[1:10:32] you pass the trees going down
[1:10:35] but look where you're going
[1:10:37] when things are floating easy
[1:10:40] he's inside remember you're going
[1:10:42] towards a great cataract down there
[1:10:44] remember it leads to destruction jesus
[1:10:47] said
[1:10:48] he said of some sort you're going
[1:10:51] towards the falls and it won't be too
[1:10:52] long and you're going to go over the
[1:10:54] falls just floating with the world easy
[1:10:59] the way it goes
[1:11:01] he says you don't want to do that no sir
[1:11:03] he says but
[1:11:04] you must accept your responsibility so
[1:11:08] let me just say it like this
[1:11:11] god has never been a pusher
[1:11:14] he's a gentleman
[1:11:17] he said this is my will
[1:11:24] with this will is a responsibility if
[1:11:26] you love me keep my commandments it's
[1:11:28] just there's a responsibility to this
[1:11:33] now we can get up tomorrow morning
[1:11:36] and we can take it easy
[1:11:39] and just wait for the next service
[1:11:42] or we can get up because we heard from
[1:11:44] god wednesday night
[1:11:47] it's your choice
[1:11:48] but to to god he has given us his
[1:11:51] responsibility it's up to us whether we
[1:11:54] want to follow it or not
[1:12:03] he says in the responsibility
[1:12:05] that god has given us in this day
[1:12:10] is to bring this message
[1:12:12] to bring this message
[1:12:16] and as i get older and i know my days
[1:12:19] are shortening up not feel that now
[1:12:22] right
[1:12:23] we all think about well when i get
[1:12:24] covered well that could be it
[1:12:27] we're we're thinking about our days
[1:12:29] shortening up don't tell me we're not
[1:12:32] right brother that's right
[1:12:34] the whole the whole world isn't we don't
[1:12:37] have much time to to win a soul for the
[1:12:40] lord
[1:12:42] we don't get all the time in the world
[1:12:44] he says as i get older i know my days
[1:12:46] are shortening up
[1:12:48] and i feel the responsibility greater
[1:12:49] than i've ever
[1:12:51] felt think about that
[1:12:52] at the very end when he preached this is
[1:12:55] this is the last year of his life 1965.
[1:12:59] more than he ever felt at the end at the
[1:13:01] end of his course that he was running
[1:13:04] pressing on we must do it we must get
[1:13:06] down to it everywhere we go and tell the
[1:13:09] message and tell the people that jesus
[1:13:11] is coming
[1:13:12] amen that he's he's god
[1:13:15] and he's coming soon and there's no hope
[1:13:18] left in the world but the coming of the
[1:13:20] lord amen
[1:13:24] we must finish our course
[1:13:30] people have
[1:13:32] got lazy they've laxed out they've
[1:13:34] gotten out of the race
[1:13:36] they never even had a revelation of how
[1:13:38] to run the race
[1:13:46] brandon said that these are the
[1:13:47] responsibilities of a true christian
[1:13:50] amen
[1:13:51] every day rugged life making converts to
[1:13:54] christ amen whoa whoa whoa whoa i want
[1:13:57] to ask you when's the last time you did
[1:13:58] that
[1:14:00] when's the last time you did that
[1:14:06] brother john
[1:14:08] it's not about brother john
[1:14:10] i'm sorry brother john isn't up here
[1:14:15] i would never ever want to be up here
[1:14:17] without god ever
[1:14:21] still never don't even want to be up
[1:14:23] here
[1:14:26] but the problem is we think it's brother
[1:14:28] john
[1:14:29] we think it's a man talking
[1:14:32] is it a man was it a man or what was it
[1:14:35] was it god and brother branham that
[1:14:36] spoke this
[1:14:41] it's a hard rugged life making converts
[1:14:43] to christ
[1:14:45] well brother john that's not what i
[1:14:47] signed up for
[1:14:49] that doesn't sound like joy and peace
[1:14:52] that was promised to me
[1:14:56] i say brother and sister the joy and
[1:14:58] peace that god has promised you
[1:15:00] comes as a result of doing god's will
[1:15:05] everybody wants joy and peace
[1:15:08] that nobody wants to do the will of god
[1:15:12] i'm talking about the hard things the
[1:15:13] suffering
[1:15:15] all that paul went through
[1:15:17] he had joy and peace
[1:15:19] yes he did yes amen
[1:15:22] now how did he have joy and peace
[1:15:24] when he was suffering all the time
[1:15:27] because he was in the will of god amen
[1:15:30] and when you're in the will of god doing
[1:15:32] the will of god i don't care how much
[1:15:33] you're suffering there's an internal joy
[1:15:37] and peace that happens inside of you
[1:15:39] did not jesus say uh peace i give unto
[1:15:42] you not as the world giveth give i unto
[1:15:44] you it's a
[1:15:46] the peace that you get from the world
[1:15:47] when everything's got to be okay with
[1:15:49] everybody
[1:15:52] when they say peace and safety
[1:15:55] the world goes oh yeah this is great but
[1:15:57] we know what's going to happen
[1:16:00] but the bottom could be falling out in
[1:16:02] your life and you could have peace
[1:16:08] you can just be wretching in pain and
[1:16:11] have a joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:16:16] because it doesn't come from man it
[1:16:18] comes from god and god gives it to man
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:23] think about it he can he can withhold
[1:16:27] his joy from anybody
[1:16:29] he can withhold his peace from anybody
[1:16:32] and he's able also to
[1:16:34] make grace abound
[1:16:36] to the fullness in any man's life
[1:16:40] it's just who wants to get serious with
[1:16:42] god amen
[1:16:44] who who who will dare to believe god is
[1:16:47] speaking tonight
[1:16:54] i'm scared i am scared for those
[1:16:58] who do not see god
[1:17:00] behind his word
[1:17:03] because it doesn't matter the vessel
[1:17:08] it's the word
[1:17:09] that's what he'll back up
[1:17:14] if we don't suffer with them we're not
[1:17:15] going to get to reign with them
[1:17:20] what is all this suffering for
[1:17:22] the suffering is to get a soul in
[1:17:24] it's not just going through a bunch of
[1:17:26] pain ridiculous hardships for nothing we
[1:17:29] all the whole world's got that
[1:17:31] the whole world's suffering
[1:17:35] but to suffer for the lord
[1:17:40] how many can testify that you belong to
[1:17:42] jesus
[1:17:47] remember just because we've accepted the
[1:17:49] benefits of calvary doesn't mean that
[1:17:51] we've accepted the responsibilities of
[1:17:56] calvary in other words
[1:17:59] we really belong to god
[1:18:03] we have no right to do our will
[1:18:06] if we do it's called rebellion
[1:18:08] right that's right come on
[1:18:14] we must finish
[1:18:15] our course
[1:18:17] crucified amen
[1:18:20] we must finish our course crucified
[1:18:26] lives
[1:18:28] crucified to our will crucified to our
[1:18:31] flesh
[1:18:34] paul said in galatians 5 24 and they
[1:18:37] that are
[1:18:39] christ they that belong to christ have
[1:18:42] crucified
[1:18:43] the flesh
[1:18:45] with the affections
[1:18:47] and the lust that's right amen amen
[1:18:51] if we live in this spirit will also
[1:18:53] let us also walk in the spirit
[1:18:56] let us not be desirous of vainglory
[1:18:59] let's not be desires of provoking one
[1:19:01] another let's not be desirous of envying
[1:19:03] one another
[1:19:05] in other words we need to embrace the
[1:19:07] new course of life
[1:19:11] sure when we accepted jesus into our
[1:19:13] heart
[1:19:14] we like made a decision i'm going to
[1:19:16] crucify this flesh and the affections
[1:19:18] with the lust but you know you wake up
[1:19:20] the next day and here comes satan trying
[1:19:22] to give you a desire
[1:19:26] so we must remain we must live we must
[1:19:29] finish our course crucified
[1:19:33] don't be led astray
[1:19:38] brother sister always remember that at
[1:19:41] any time you embrace the old cushy style
[1:19:45] of life
[1:19:46] or begin to desire vainglory
[1:19:50] riches popularity
[1:19:52] envying
[1:19:53] having a desire to provoke someone you
[1:19:56] have opened the door to be led astray
[1:20:00] right right
[1:20:03] now the thing is you don't think so but
[1:20:05] you don't realize it
[1:20:09] but doesn't the bible say he that
[1:20:10] looketh in the perfect law of liberty
[1:20:13] walks away and forget what he read for
[1:20:16] his life as he goes on monday tuesday
[1:20:20] that he deceives him own his own self
[1:20:24] he's the one that brought about being
[1:20:26] led astray because he already purposed
[1:20:28] that he didn't have to do it all right
[1:20:31] all i gotta do is say amen to it
[1:20:34] so as i say amen
[1:20:38] you gotta do it
[1:20:39] can't be a hero of the word only gotta
[1:20:41] be a
[1:20:45] that's doer
[1:20:46] no no this message isn't a real popular
[1:20:48] message
[1:20:50] but if there's one bride member here
[1:20:53] they appreciate it
[1:20:53] [Laughter]
[1:20:56] i want to preach to the bride because
[1:20:58] you know what you cannot make
[1:21:01] a foolish virgin a bride
[1:21:04] and it's impossible to take a bride
[1:21:08] and they become a foolish virgin
[1:21:11] because every seed is going to bring
[1:21:12] fourth of its kind
[1:21:14] and and the seed is this is the seed in
[1:21:18] the beginning was the word the word was
[1:21:20] with god and the word was god it will
[1:21:22] remain
[1:21:24] when the battle is all over
[1:21:26] the smoke is settled you will see the
[1:21:29] words standing there
[1:21:32] and they that are the word are going to
[1:21:33] be standing with them amen
[1:21:38] all we have to do is desire something
[1:21:40] more than pleasing christ that's all we
[1:21:42] got to do to be led astray
[1:21:46] it will open the door to be led astray
[1:21:49] just wanting anything more than pleasing
[1:21:52] christ
[1:21:53] ii peter chapter 2 verse 15.
[1:21:56] which have forsaken the right way
[1:21:59] and have gone astray
[1:22:02] following the way
[1:22:04] of balaam the son of
[1:22:08] bolsor have loved the wages
[1:22:12] of unrighteousness
[1:22:14] you know satan's got some good wages out
[1:22:15] there for us
[1:22:19] so it's easy to be led astray we don't
[1:22:21] want to be led astray
[1:22:24] that's why jesus said he then endure to
[1:22:25] the end amen
[1:22:27] stay on track
[1:22:30] as soon as we get a little pride going
[1:22:32] in this new course of life
[1:22:35] you've gotten out of favor with god
[1:22:38] the bible says that
[1:22:39] god resists the proud and gives grace to
[1:22:42] the humble
[1:22:43] so we must keep ourselves crucified this
[1:22:45] is where i'm going with this
[1:22:47] there's a purpose for self-crucifixion
[1:22:53] i mean we i i want a greater revelation
[1:22:57] that there's nothing good in me
[1:22:59] [Laughter]
[1:23:01] i don't care what revelation i got i
[1:23:02] want to i want it greater i want the
[1:23:04] iron field taken off a little bit more i
[1:23:07] want to see how rotten i really am
[1:23:15] it's our own desire that leads us astray
[1:23:18] it's not some false doctrine
[1:23:21] it's not the devil against your will
[1:23:24] it's the devil uniting with
[1:23:26] your will
[1:23:28] that leads you astray
[1:23:30] it's the devil saying that's what you
[1:23:32] want i'll give it to you
[1:23:33] that's what you want i'll give it to you
[1:23:35] that's what will lead you astray right
[1:23:37] not some false doctrine
[1:23:40] right
[1:23:41] true we don't have to worry about that
[1:23:45] but we certainly got to worry about our
[1:23:47] desires
[1:23:49] james chapter 1 verse 14 every man is
[1:23:52] tempted when he is drawn away from his
[1:23:55] own
[1:23:56] drawn away of his own lust
[1:23:59] and enticed
[1:24:01] see how the devil works with our
[1:24:03] i mean
[1:24:05] if brother bob
[1:24:07] purposely didn't pick on you
[1:24:09] if brother bob
[1:24:11] had a a problem
[1:24:13] with
[1:24:14] having with stealing in a store
[1:24:19] well it's going to be very hard for the
[1:24:21] devil
[1:24:24] to get me to steal
[1:24:29] because i i just i don't have that
[1:24:31] desire where bob does
[1:24:35] where he's going to get me is what what
[1:24:37] i desire in my flesh
[1:24:39] so it's not a matter of well let's just
[1:24:41] preach this this and this what about the
[1:24:44] thousand things
[1:24:47] this is where we come to church and we
[1:24:48] allow god to speak to us god search my
[1:24:52] heart know my
[1:24:53] thoughts amen
[1:25:01] then when lust have conceived it
[1:25:03] bringeth forth sin and sin when it's
[1:25:05] finished and bringeth forth death do not
[1:25:08] air my beloved brethren don't air
[1:25:12] keep yourself crucified with christ
[1:25:18] don't be led astray by your wants
[1:25:20] keep yourself crucified before one
[1:25:23] another
[1:25:24] esteem others more than yourself
[1:25:26] lay down your will lay down your time
[1:25:29] live for one another find a time that
[1:25:32] you can get away make a phone call tell
[1:25:34] somebody you love them get on your knees
[1:25:36] and pray for them some of you won't call
[1:25:38] somebody because of your pride
[1:25:42] some people you won't do it because you
[1:25:44] got
[1:25:46] other excuses
[1:25:48] right
[1:25:50] i say pray for one another with love and
[1:25:52] compassion
[1:25:55] don't be led astray of your own wants
[1:25:59] the devil's easiest priority job is to
[1:26:02] give you what you already want
[1:26:08] no what makes his job hard
[1:26:10] is when you've laid down your life for
[1:26:12] christ and you're just out there winning
[1:26:14] a soul that's your whole mother that's
[1:26:16] what you're doing your purpose you're
[1:26:17] laying everything else aside to do that
[1:26:19] then he's got to go out there and stick
[1:26:21] some lures out in front of you
[1:26:24] but if you're not working for the lord
[1:26:26] and you just got your own believe me
[1:26:29] you're easy
[1:26:32] keep yourself crucified
[1:26:35] brother john why are you pushing it
[1:26:36] because we got to finish this course
[1:26:38] that's why
[1:26:40] first peter chapter five verse eight
[1:26:42] first peter chapter five verse eight be
[1:26:44] sober
[1:26:45] be vigilant
[1:26:47] this is your job in other words be
[1:26:49] serious christian
[1:26:50] because
[1:26:52] your adversary
[1:26:54] your real adversary is not your brother
[1:26:56] it's not your sister
[1:26:58] it's the devil
[1:27:00] as a wrong line he's walking about
[1:27:03] seeking whom he may devour
[1:27:08] he'll devour somebody that just i so bad
[1:27:11] wanna go steal
[1:27:14] easy target
[1:27:16] let's just go to the store
[1:27:20] he looks at your desire
[1:27:22] and he sets the test for you
[1:27:26] that's why you need to be sober be
[1:27:28] vigilant
[1:27:29] amen
[1:27:30] who resists steadfast in the faith
[1:27:33] knowing that the same look at this
[1:27:35] afflictions
[1:27:36] are accomplished in your brethren that
[1:27:38] are in the world
[1:27:40] the same what the same crucifying of
[1:27:42] yourself
[1:27:45] every christian has to crucify
[1:27:47] themselves
[1:27:48] and when you live godly
[1:27:51] just like all your other brothers and
[1:27:52] sisters you're going to suffer
[1:27:54] persecutions right amen
[1:27:59] we can't get away from it we must remain
[1:28:01] sober we must remain vigilant we must
[1:28:04] remain crucified with christ
[1:28:08] we must take charge of our wants
[1:28:14] and the best thing i can say to you is
[1:28:16] psalms 23
[1:28:18] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:28:21] [Laughter]
[1:28:23] take charge of your wants
[1:28:26] want to please him
[1:28:32] don't allow yourself to be a victim of
[1:28:34] satan's tactics by giving you what you
[1:28:36] want
[1:28:38] romans chapter 6 verse 6.
[1:28:45] knowing this
[1:28:46] that our old man
[1:28:49] is crucified with him
[1:28:52] that the body of sin might be
[1:28:54] destroyed that henceforth we should not
[1:28:58] serve
[1:28:59] sin
[1:29:01] for he that is dead
[1:29:03] is free from sin how many has been free
[1:29:04] from sin amen okay but
[1:29:08] that's right that's right
[1:29:10] but notice you're free from sin but you
[1:29:13] sin every day and you want your flesh
[1:29:15] wants to sin
[1:29:17] so understand
[1:29:19] this cockapur nature we still got to
[1:29:21] deal with and the way that you deal with
[1:29:23] it is crucify it daily
[1:29:26] but because of calvary because of what
[1:29:28] he did you have power
[1:29:30] you have power if you yield to god
[1:29:34] now if we be dead with christ we believe
[1:29:37] that we shall
[1:29:38] also live with him knowing that christ
[1:29:42] knowing that christ being raised from
[1:29:43] the dead dieth no more
[1:29:45] death have no more dominion over him
[1:29:49] for in
[1:29:50] that he died he died unto sin once
[1:29:54] calvary just one time
[1:29:56] but in him that
[1:29:58] in him that he he liveth he liveth unto
[1:30:02] god
[1:30:03] so now he's trying to tell us what kind
[1:30:05] of attitude to have what kind of
[1:30:07] direction he says likewise
[1:30:10] reckon yourself also
[1:30:13] you're wrecking your also yourselves to
[1:30:16] be dead
[1:30:17] indeed onto sin so if you don't look at
[1:30:20] yourself as look i'm dead understand i'm
[1:30:23] not going to do my will
[1:30:24] if you don't reckon yourself like that
[1:30:28] then you're going to keep uting yourself
[1:30:31] to the easy path
[1:30:34] but alive unto god through jesus christ
[1:30:36] our lord
[1:30:37] he's telling us that we have control
[1:30:39] here let not sin therefore
[1:30:43] reign
[1:30:44] in your moral body
[1:30:45] that ye should obey it in the lust
[1:30:48] thereof
[1:30:50] neither healed ye your
[1:30:53] members as instruments of
[1:30:54] unrighteousness unto sin but yield
[1:30:56] yourselves unto god as those that are
[1:30:58] alive from the dead and your members as
[1:31:00] instruments of righteousness unto god
[1:31:02] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[1:31:06] for you're not under the law but under
[1:31:07] grace
[1:31:10] there's control that we can take in our
[1:31:12] lives
[1:31:15] we can either make excuses
[1:31:18] or we can say i'm not going to let this
[1:31:20] happen
[1:31:22] wherever the soldier your feet shall
[1:31:23] tread upon that ground i've given you
[1:31:25] amen as i was with paul as i was with no
[1:31:29] so shall i be with you
[1:31:32] you gotta take a stand you gotta fight
[1:31:34] the good fight of faith
[1:31:36] don't get lazy
[1:31:38] don't get lukewarm
[1:31:40] finish your course
[1:31:42] you started the race now finish it
[1:31:45] make a decision for christ to finish it
[1:31:48] see it through
[1:31:50] use the talents that god has given you
[1:31:52] to win a new soul for jesus
[1:31:55] use your time
[1:31:56] your compassion your love reach out to
[1:31:59] somebody your flesh don't want you to
[1:32:03] help change the course of another soul
[1:32:05] think about that
[1:32:07] help change the course of another soul
[1:32:10] because
[1:32:11] the souls that are not uh
[1:32:14] in christ are in their flesh
[1:32:17] they're heading towards hell
[1:32:19] and and and some having compassion
[1:32:21] making a difference the other could care
[1:32:24] the less
[1:32:27] make a difference
[1:32:28] we don't got much time take action in
[1:32:30] your course to change the course of
[1:32:33] another soul
[1:32:36] don't stop working for god
[1:32:39] don't just think well it's at the end
[1:32:41] i'm just going to coast in now no you've
[1:32:43] got to accept your responsibility
[1:32:45] brother branham said
[1:32:47] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17
[1:32:50] we're winding down
[1:32:52] we don't have long
[1:32:55] to go
[1:32:57] of course i'm considering this with
[1:32:58] eternity
[1:33:03] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17
[1:33:04] therefore if any man be in christ he's a
[1:33:08] new creature all things are passed away
[1:33:10] behold all things are become new so this
[1:33:13] is a new course of life
[1:33:16] that means we're not allowed
[1:33:18] to do our own thing
[1:33:22] and this is just a matter of just being
[1:33:24] honest
[1:33:25] lord am i
[1:33:27] pushing my will too much in my life
[1:33:32] and all things are of god
[1:33:36] who have reconciled us to himself by
[1:33:38] jesus christ and has given to us
[1:33:41] the ministry of reconciliation
[1:33:44] here
[1:33:45] is exactly what god gave paul
[1:33:49] a ministry of reconciliation
[1:33:51] and this ministry
[1:33:53] caused him to suffer
[1:33:56] but it brought life to others
[1:33:59] amen right
[1:34:00] and when he talked about how great the
[1:34:02] ministry was
[1:34:03] he talked about all the sufferings
[1:34:05] i love that spirit
[1:34:09] that was christ and paul
[1:34:11] and i would recognize that christ in a
[1:34:13] person today
[1:34:16] a ministry of reconciliation he was
[1:34:19] willing to suffer to see somebody else
[1:34:21] reconciled amen
[1:34:24] not just
[1:34:27] to wit that god was in christ
[1:34:29] reconciling the world unto yourself not
[1:34:31] imputing their trespasses unto them and
[1:34:34] has committed unto us
[1:34:36] the word of reconciliation
[1:34:40] the word
[1:34:42] now
[1:34:43] we can preach the word
[1:34:47] or we can let our life preach the word
[1:34:52] didn't brother george say preach the
[1:34:53] word always
[1:34:55] absolute have to use some words
[1:35:01] that's the word of reconciliation what
[1:35:03] attracts people you hear people talk all
[1:35:05] the time and that don't attract them but
[1:35:07] when they see you lay down your life
[1:35:09] when they see you turn their their cheek
[1:35:12] and they still when they see somebody
[1:35:14] still loves them regardless of how
[1:35:16] they're treated
[1:35:21] only god can do that man can't do that
[1:35:25] now then verse 20 we are ambassadors not
[1:35:29] for send the light
[1:35:31] not for brother branham
[1:35:34] but for christ
[1:35:36] as though god did beseech you by us we
[1:35:39] pray you in christ said be reconciled to
[1:35:42] god that should be our motive when we
[1:35:43] get up in the morning lord use me to
[1:35:45] reconcile somebody
[1:35:47] you want to finish the course not just
[1:35:49] well yeah i made it to the end i'm sorry
[1:35:51] do something with your course
[1:35:54] we know through the parables that jesus
[1:35:56] gave that we got to give an account
[1:35:58] amen
[1:35:59] we need to use our talents
[1:36:01] we need to we need to bring more to him
[1:36:04] than what we started out with he expects
[1:36:07] us to bring more to him than what we
[1:36:09] started out with
[1:36:12] and i'll tell you if i come up short i
[1:36:14] want to die trying
[1:36:16] i want to die trying i do not want to
[1:36:18] face god as a coward
[1:36:22] i don't know what's happening here
[1:36:24] but more than likely
[1:36:27] it's this
[1:36:32] well-used
[1:36:34] thing in my pocket
[1:36:35] we have another one awaiting us
[1:36:39] praise the lord things are
[1:36:40] uh we're gonna get a fire uh inspection
[1:36:44] tomorrow and and after that is just the
[1:36:46] final inspection and things are
[1:36:48] looking really really good
[1:36:53] turn with me if you would acts chapter
[1:36:55] 20. just got two more scriptures
[1:36:57] just a couple more scriptures i want to
[1:36:59] read
[1:37:00] this is one
[1:37:02] that
[1:37:04] brother mark brought up and he said
[1:37:06] would anybody like to read this
[1:37:07] scripture
[1:37:08] and i said not me i'll be reading it
[1:37:10] later
[1:37:13] and now behold paul says
[1:37:16] i want to follow paul's example
[1:37:19] who stayed the course
[1:37:21] stayed working to the very end and he
[1:37:23] didn't care about the persecutions that
[1:37:26] got in his way he kept going
[1:37:28] he just kept his eyes focused
[1:37:32] and now behold i go bound in the spirit
[1:37:35] unto jerusalem not knowing the things
[1:37:37] that shall befall me there say that the
[1:37:39] holy spirit witness in every city saying
[1:37:41] that bonds and afflictions abide me
[1:37:45] he didn't know what was going to happen
[1:37:47] the only thing he knew is that he was
[1:37:49] going to be suffering
[1:37:51] he had that revelation from the
[1:37:52] beginning
[1:37:56] paul said i suffer as an evil doer
[1:38:00] he said in second timothy chapter 2
[1:38:02] verse 10 don't turn there he said i
[1:38:04] endure all things for the elect's sake
[1:38:06] his whole motive of suffering was to see
[1:38:09] a soul saved
[1:38:11] the elect
[1:38:12] the elect not the foolish virgin
[1:38:16] the elect
[1:38:17] i wonder how many is like interested
[1:38:20] in getting to the elect
[1:38:23] i endure all things for the elect's sake
[1:38:25] that they may also obtain
[1:38:28] the salvation which is in christ jesus
[1:38:31] with eternal glory
[1:38:33] and verse 12 if we suffer we shall reign
[1:38:36] with him
[1:38:37] but if we deny him
[1:38:39] deny suffering
[1:38:41] right
[1:38:42] because the first one says if we if we
[1:38:44] suffer we're going to reign
[1:38:46] so if we deny suffering he will he also
[1:38:49] will deny us
[1:38:50] think about that how in the world could
[1:38:53] god tell brother branham
[1:38:55] tell us
[1:38:56] through paul through the word through
[1:38:58] the message
[1:39:00] that
[1:39:01] this is the way
[1:39:03] and let us get off on a flowery bed of
[1:39:06] ease
[1:39:09] it just wouldn't be fair
[1:39:11] it would not be fair
[1:39:14] all right verse 24 back to acts there
[1:39:16] but none of these things move me
[1:39:20] neither
[1:39:22] count i
[1:39:24] my life dear unto myself why paul why
[1:39:28] why why why why
[1:39:29] so that i might finish my course
[1:39:33] with joy
[1:39:35] and the ministry
[1:39:37] which i have received of the lord jesus
[1:39:41] to testify the gospel of the grace of
[1:39:43] god
[1:39:45] paul wanted to finish his course strong
[1:39:49] he wanted to finish it with joy he
[1:39:52] wanted to finish it he didn't have that
[1:39:54] well you know i've done so much for the
[1:39:56] lord
[1:39:58] no let me go i want to my life i want to
[1:40:01] witness some more of the resurrection of
[1:40:03] jesus christ that he was crucified and
[1:40:05] risen again inside of me
[1:40:08] amen
[1:40:10] his life wasn't dear to him
[1:40:16] how about you
[1:40:20] have you been moved away
[1:40:23] from the ministry
[1:40:27] paul wanted to finish his course
[1:40:30] with joy in the ministry which he had
[1:40:32] received of jesus
[1:40:37] have you counted your time
[1:40:39] and your resources and your personal
[1:40:42] life dear unto you
[1:40:45] paul didn't
[1:40:49] have your thoughts been to finish the
[1:40:51] course with the same joy that was set
[1:40:53] before
[1:40:54] paul
[1:40:55] and the same joy that was set before the
[1:40:57] lord
[1:41:02] how are you planning to finish your
[1:41:04] course that's my question to you today
[1:41:09] the last verse hebrews chapter 12 verse
[1:41:11] 1
[1:41:13] paul knew
[1:41:14] that heaven was watching him
[1:41:18] is he going to be willing to go to
[1:41:20] jerusalem
[1:41:21] is he going to go there and be a witness
[1:41:23] be be the testimony
[1:41:26] or is he going to be afraid
[1:41:29] even when satan got into the other
[1:41:32] brothers and sisters and said don't go
[1:41:34] don't go don't go they're gonna kill you
[1:41:37] he says what do you mean to break my
[1:41:39] heart right amen i'm not only willing to
[1:41:42] go but i'm willing to die for my lord
[1:41:47] so i want to say how are you going to
[1:41:48] finish the course are you just going to
[1:41:50] take it easy and just try to stay in
[1:41:51] church stay in the message
[1:41:55] won't you challenge yourself i know you
[1:41:57] want a message that says you're doing
[1:41:58] really good
[1:42:00] praise god you're doing good you got it
[1:42:02] now i got a message for you also how are
[1:42:05] you going to finish your course
[1:42:08] hebrews chapter 12 verse 1. wherefore
[1:42:11] seeing we also we also not just paul we
[1:42:15] also are compassed about what's so great
[1:42:18] a cloud of witnesses
[1:42:21] what should we do just say yeah they're
[1:42:23] watching us yeah they're watching us no
[1:42:26] that's not what the writer says
[1:42:29] the writer says let us lay aside every
[1:42:33] weight
[1:42:35] and the unbelief of what's being
[1:42:38] preached to us
[1:42:39] lay it
[1:42:40] aside
[1:42:42] and every sin
[1:42:44] which does so easily so easily
[1:42:49] besets us
[1:42:50] gets us out of the race
[1:42:53] and let us run
[1:42:55] with patience
[1:42:56] the race that is set before us
[1:43:02] the hardest thing is to get up and do it
[1:43:04] again
[1:43:05] it's easy to go do something for christ
[1:43:07] right now
[1:43:08] the hardest harder things get up and do
[1:43:09] it again
[1:43:10] get up and do it again and get up and do
[1:43:12] it again that's what the patience is
[1:43:14] needed for
[1:43:16] looking
[1:43:18] unto jesus now this is what we need to
[1:43:20] do
[1:43:22] the alternate finish of our faith
[1:43:24] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:43:26] he endured the cross the joy was set
[1:43:29] before he knew
[1:43:31] someone was going to be helped
[1:43:34] this should be what gives us joy
[1:43:36] when we give up our time our money our
[1:43:39] talents our resources everything that we
[1:43:42] have just to see one soul
[1:43:45] it's worth ten thousand worlds right
[1:43:47] amen for the joy that set before me
[1:43:50] endure the cross despising the shame and
[1:43:51] set down the right hand to the throne of
[1:43:53] god for consider him consider jesus that
[1:43:56] endured such contradiction of sinners
[1:43:59] against himself
[1:44:01] lest
[1:44:02] you
[1:44:03] be weary and faint in your mind
[1:44:07] in other words you're not the only one
[1:44:08] that's in a battle right you're not the
[1:44:10] only one that's going through this
[1:44:13] we're all in a race
[1:44:17] we all have a course we all have uh
[1:44:20] hardships we all have battles
[1:44:23] but we got to keep our eyes on a soul
[1:44:28] because i'm telling you if you're
[1:44:29] looking at jesus jesus is going to be
[1:44:31] telling even from the cross son behold
[1:44:34] my mother mother behold the son
[1:44:36] he's going to be leading you to help
[1:44:38] somebody
[1:44:40] so look to the author and finish your
[1:44:42] faith if you keep your eyes on jesus you
[1:44:45] will be helping us you will be living
[1:44:47] for us because the prophet god sent a
[1:44:48] prophet in this hour and he told us what
[1:44:51] real eternal life was
[1:44:54] it wasn't something we were just going
[1:44:55] to see on the other side
[1:44:58] it's something that was demonstrated and
[1:45:00] lived on this side
[1:45:02] not living for others over there living
[1:45:04] for others here
[1:45:09] and i'll tell you let your relationship
[1:45:10] be so sweet with jesus
[1:45:13] that you don't have to wait for somebody
[1:45:15] to ask you to do something
[1:45:19] you get in that prayer closet
[1:45:21] you feel this burden
[1:45:23] that's how god works
[1:45:27] i haven't felt that in a while brother
[1:45:29] john just keep praying
[1:45:31] keep praying it will come he's just
[1:45:33] looking for somebody that will yield
[1:45:36] amen let's stand together god bless you
[1:45:46] that little chorus that
[1:45:48] or song that brother mark had led us in
[1:45:51] must jesus bear the cross alone
[1:45:54] was that not a perfect
[1:45:56] song for this message a preparation
[1:46:00] must jesus bear the cross alone i to be
[1:46:03] honest with you even if he did i
[1:46:05] wouldn't want him to
[1:46:07] i feel in debt
[1:46:09] i i feel like i just want to help
[1:46:13] carry the cross now of course if i was
[1:46:15] there literally when it was happening i
[1:46:17] would want to be one
[1:46:20] but i wasn't
[1:46:22] but i can still do it today
[1:46:26] i can do it today
[1:46:27] by bringing the crucifixion of christ to
[1:46:31] some soul
[1:46:33] that just looks at it as some story
[1:46:36] and how that can change a person's life
[1:46:40] amen
[1:46:43] let's sing god is god is so good
