but to trust and obey hallelujah hallelujah how true that is amen hallelujah well let's change the order of service here we just have one request but i think there's many on our hearts and i think everybody knows that jerry mead passed away so let's just keep the mead family lifted up and the chenault family lift it up it brings reality home when somebody really close to your passes away like that because all of a sudden wow you know you're just talking to them the day before or you were just you know fellowshipping with them or maybe even on the phone and all of a sudden they're not there anymore it shows us how frail our lives really are and how about a short time you know we're going to meet jesus you know for him he's on his way to glory for us we're so here and it shows us that you know if there was something that we wanted to do the next day we couldn't do it if there's somebody we wanted to talk to the lord about it's gone you can't do that now so we need to be diligent about just following what the holy ghost says he says go talk to that person stop what you doing go talk to that person don't make well you know i'll do that tomorrow because tomorrow comes and then tomorrow the next day comes right so if there's ever a time that we need to be winning souls for christ it's now it's a lot of people looking for an answer to just a lot of people looking for peace and out there because there is no peace out there other other than christ amen so let's just keep them lifted up in our prayers tonight amen also um in the same aspect he went hunting with my brother and and um danny so the three of them were all together so my brother's quarantined now and danny's and danny's you know quarantined do so just keep them lifted up in your prayers too if you would uh so it's just re and anybody else you know that's that's suffering from ill from this uh covid it's a real thing and uh you know you think you got tomorrow like jerry he thought he had tomorrow he's going to go to the doctor tomorrow well tomorrow didn't come for him right so let's be diligent about what the holy spirit speaks to us and trust and obey amen amen our sister cheryl has a request please pray for aaron and elizabeth and the entire family they have a bad flu virus i would also uh appreciate your prayers i am not feeling well so we know that sister cheryl's not feeling well and i'm actually kind of surprised she's here so she's pressing the mark and i'm thankful for that sister also for all those that are out there live streaming we pray that the lord's spirit would just be upon you steer you and guide you and direct your path amen um and let's just remember all the missionaries throughout the world this is epidemic it's worldwide so it says in our brother's country probably just as bad as it is in ours so let's just be diligent to pray not only for our country but everybody and uh that the lord would just use whomever to bring him to him amen so remember brother john is he prepares his heart and the word for us and i pray for one another that we can just receive whatever the lord would have for us tonight and just believe it's for us you know instead of just saying oh yeah i've heard this one before there's there's always something in the word that can call us up higher if we just believe it so let's just do that tonight uh let's just stand and amen if there's something on somebody's heart just in silent prayer just lifting your hands just let let it known before the lord tonight let's just go on one accord tonight dear heavenly father lord as we come before you tonight lord a needy people lord jesus we are nobody without you lord lord your grace came to us lord and called us out of the darkness in the light and we're thankful for that we're so thankful lord but it just didn't come to call us out of the darkness lord it came out that we might be a light lord upon this world for others lord to see to lord to be in an attraction to lead them to you lord so lord as we submit ourselves to you and your spirit tonight lord jesus we pray that you might just have your way lord for lord our our our brother lord that passed away in his family lord for his wife lord the mead family lord for just an all family lord for our sister trish lord lord that you might just be the peace that uh encompasses all lord god and lord jesus the lord

hearts lord god for those that i haven't mentioned lord for this baby lord that uh sister kathleen was praying for him excuse me i don't know the name lord but i know it's surgeries do lord and we

for a service or or two or just just one amen it's so good to have you and uh our special guest visitor brother ike from nigeria somewhere in nigeria amen god bless you well thank you for coming and being with us it's a privilege to have you and we appreciate the work that's being done in nigeria we uh supporting a couple brothers there and uh their work is endless because the souls uh there are many souls uh but there's few laborers and we're thankful for every labor amen god bless you well we are so saddened to hear about the passing of brother jerry mead he's been in our church a number of times we many years ago we were deacons together and spent time together and our brother has had nothing but just good things to say uh and we all of our thoughts about him are just wonderful thoughts and we can't wait till we get to the other side to not be separated and we want to continue earnestly to pray for the family at this time all that we have is one another and christ in us can touch the hem of uh of of of his garment and and needs can be met and hearts can be comforted and and i just want you to put yourself in their place and it just helps us to enter into prayer amen let's turn to the book of exodus chapter 33 for opening scripture before we have you be seated we were going we're going in another direction and then when this had transpired we just felt to minister on the rock we want to tell this message the rock and we if there's ever a time that we need a rock it's it's now the world's getting worse and uh god has given us a rock amen amen let's just bow in a word of prayer before we begin reading heavenly father lord as we approach this part of the service lord we need your anointing we need it uh on in our minds in our ears in our lips lord would you just take full control of the service today lord would you help your people lord lord i pray that you'd reach out lord to our sister trisha and her her sisters and her brothers and lord the whole family lord we pray that lord you would remember lord our brothers sisters gail lord we pray that you would just remember all the everyone connected lord jesus at this time reach out and bring the comfort to their hearts bring the peace that passeth all understanding and bring the love that would just mold the family and knit the family together oh god i just pray that you do what we cannot do we're looking to you father we ask that you bless this word now to each of our hearts as we commit this into your hands for your honor and glory we pray in jesus precious name amen amen exodus chapter 33 and this is the time that moses was seeking a a clear vision of the lord and we'll start with verse number 20 and he said thou canst not see my face god's speaking to moses here for there shall no man see me and live and the lord said behold there is a place by me amen and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that i will put thee in a cleft of the rock and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by amen god bless you may be seated god wants us to stand by him he has a place for us amen there's a little cleft in the rock praise god well we've mentioned this i believe in past but most people know dwayne johnson as the rock he was a professional wrestler he later became a hollywood icon as an actor that fans grew to love and people saw him as very muscular his body was described as being chiseled and swollen cut and and ripped and jacked and there's definitions for all of them he carried his own image of toughness and strength and when people saw him in film they knew when he was there that he was going to take care of business he was the go-to man he brought a a sense of feeling of security that everything was going to be all right and and heroism and when it comes to entertainment that is exactly what the world is looking for but when it comes to real life issues that hollywood image doesn't help to the believer he has found jesus to be the rock of ages now jesus he didn't have much of a physical physique his body wasn't chiseled or ripped there wasn't much to behold isaiah 53 verse 2 says he had no form nor comeliness and when we would see him there's no beauty that we should desire him so quite contrary to dwayne johnson the rock we're talking about two different rocks here amen he didn't have the fame and fortune like dwayne johnson he was just the opposite actually verse three said he was despised and he was rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with greece and we hid as it were our faces from him in other words people didn't want to watch jesus on tv he was despised and we esteemed a knot they mocked him in in many ways they ridiculed him they whipped him they called him beelzebub an illegitimate child a carpenter's son he was a a troublemaker a liar he was accused of a lot why he looked about 20 years older than his age he packed the sins of the world on his shoulders verse 4 he had borne our griefs and he carried our sorrows amen hollywood would have passed them up but to those who really know him oh they're singing past me not old gentle savior hear my humble cry one others are calling do not pass me by he could never compete with the culture of hollywood people in hollywood they love horror films killings comedy gay and lesbian relationships hey that's what's on you don't hear that people are boycotting the tv no that's what they want no he would never have had a star rating on tv but those who know him know him as the bright morning star he's the north star that always points us true north right back to the word he is the star that is shining in our own world he's the star that gives us light in the midst of the darkness that's all around us psalms 27 verse 1 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life whom shall i be afraid good questions to ask there's nothing to fear when god puts us in the cleft of the rock and covers us with his hand there is nothing to fear amen there's nothing to be afraid of who's going to get to us what's going to penetrate the armor of god nothing can nothing he holds us in the palm of his hand and no man can pluck us out amen he has tucked his way in the cleft of the rock second timothy chapter 1 verse 7 says for god have not given us the spirit of fear but a power and of love and of a sound mind fear is not of god we read in our men's meeting first john chapter 4 verse 18 that there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear of torment and he that feareth is not made perfect in love and when you're standing on this rock that he's placed by him there is no fear on that rock there's only love because you're in the presence of jehovah so there's nothing to fear when you're standing on the rock amen amen amen praise the lord jesus really wasn't fitly framed but he sure framed our lives he took her lives which were without uh form and and they were void and he took him and he gave us uh a frittly a a frame a life a nature change and he made us uh made us new if i could say it like that he chiseled he chiseled a new creature out of us wasn't chiseled but he he was chiseled out of god brother man said he came from god he came out of god the longest that came out he became our savior no doubt we're living in a very troubled time very troubled world it's perilous times the bible says it's going to get worse and worse we can see today that we're living in an hour that the love of many has wax cold they're no longer getting it they're they're waxing cold there's less and less love more and more hatred we all keep wanting to hold on for for something to be better things to turn around but it's not going to get better for the world we ought to be focusing on getting ready to leave that jesus is coming soon just let that go with all the confusion going around there's a place there's a place of shelter in the midst of the storm god has prepared a place for you and i to stand it's a rock it's a rock for you we want to focus on that rock because it's it takes god to show us what that rock is we'd like to say it is this word we know this word is the rock we know jesus is the rock but i'm talking about the rock for your situation there's a rock when we're in our place when we're standing on the rock next to god nothing can touch us isaiah chapter 32 verse 2 says a man isaiah 32 verse 2 a man shall be as in hiding place from the wind and a cover from the tempest as the rivers of water in a dry place is the shadows of a great rock and a weary land a man can be so one with god that he himself can be a hiding place from the storm in christ amen when christ is in you you are a hiding place john 14 verse 20 at that day ye shall know that i am in the father and ye me and i in you it's a union together amen isaiah uh i'm sorry uh psalms 91 verse 1 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord he is my refuge my fortress my god in him will i trust amen trust is the key amen no matter what you're going to trust is the key when you're dwelling in the secret place you're dwelling with christ you're dwelling in the rock that trust nothing can move you because god won't let anything move you when you put your trust in him that's all he wants you to do you don't got to sit there and and fix the problem all you got to do is trust the lord he'll fix the problem he don't want competition with you you know if you think about that's the nature we were born with i'm going to handle i'm going to do this i'm going to control this god wants us to forfeit that and just trust him for the situation he is my refuge and my fortress in god i will trust now when you're standing on the rock think about this i believe it's isaiah tells us that he dwelleth in the high and lofty place but he also dwells with them of a humble and contrite spirit so what does god do he brings us up to how many places with him so when we're on the rock i want you to imagine you're not down here in your situation you're you're in a high place you're standing you're risen now you've risen with christ the bible says when you set your affections on things above then you're risen with christ for you are dead colossians 3 3 says and your life is hid with christ in god and nobody can see it nobody knows it but you know because you're hid away with god nothing is affecting you nothing can you imagine god being affected because the check didn't come in because you got a flat tire god is not affected when you're in christ all is well but the thing is it's not knowing it's not knowing not knowing the message not knowing the bible is that knowing that christ is the rock the rock is hearing his voice right now for your situation and where to stand in that situation that's the rock it's an invisible rock it doesn't matter the troublesome time that we're living in we have a rock in the midst of of of the confusion and chaos and persecution people trying to destroy us and destroy our reputation i say we have a rock to stand on we're not left alone turn with me if you would to first kings chapter 19. verse number nine first kings chapter 19 verse 9. elijah was kind of in a turmoil situation very troublesome and wasn't clear you'll see here as we read and he came thither into a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou hear elijah and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down the altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away how many times have you felt you're left alone nobody understands it's not the first time that this feeling has been felt we all experience this we all go through times to where we feel alone that gives god a chance and if we learn to look to him we can find the rock if we learn to trust in him there is a rock to stand on and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord so notice where we gotta stand and behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains it was so strong it break in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind you know there's things always happening in our life and they're so loud they're so vicious they're so strong we actually see the effects of things happening about us and we're trying to figure it out what does this all mean but maybe we shouldn't be looking to that and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake i mean you you hear about earthquakes going on the oh this is what the number was on the richter scale and all the news goes out and we're wondering and after the earthquake was a fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice that's the rock that's the rock that's what we need to be listening for that's where we need to stand amen and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in the manner went out and stood in the entering of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou hear elijah now i want you to understand something it does not matter what anybody else says it doesn't matter what the news says it doesn't matter what's going on out there it doesn't matter the opinions of very smart people it doesn't even matter what the government says doesn't matter what a family member says what matters is that you're willing to be still long enough with all this going around to hear his voice because once you hear it you know where to stand you know where the rock is until that voice comes you're shaken you don't know and god don't want us to figure it out on our own he wants us to trust him one time there was a contest of who could paint the most peaceful scene you've heard the story and there was a a number of beautiful pistol pictures paintings and there was just wonderful sun sunsets over the over the water and over the horizon and with the different uh pastel colors in the sky and uh there was a a a picture of a children a plane just there was no fighting they had smiles on their face they seem to be happy and you know children you know people look at children they just feel sometimes there's a real peace with that there was some with uh a a brook through the wood and there's a deer drinking from the brook and that just looked peaceful just real there was there was one where uh there was this beach and the ocean was there and there was this little beach chair all sitting by itself thinking oh wouldn't it be just so peaceful to be sitting there right there just real peaceful pictures a number of different ones and there happened to be another one that just seemed to be out of place it was a dark stormy painting with rain and streaks of thunder going through around all these rocks and it looks so scary it just it really looked out of place but when you looked real close in the middle of these rocks was a little cleft in the rock and there stood a bird that didn't look scared at all wasn't afraid of the storm he was protected amen he was sheltered and that won the contest and i'll say today when we get in the cleft of the rock when we stand on that rock when we know where to stand by him our place by him when we know where to stand we are not bothered no matter what happens what is said we can stand there and know our god lives look what job went through man he went through so much though the skin worms destroy this flesh i shall still see god amen we all got a a trying time and it's getting worse and worse think about it it's coming so bad on the earth that people are going to want to seek death we it's it's going to get worse that's right i'm not going to tell you that rock moves but every time you got a situation you need to seek the lord where to stand that's the job we have to do stand in that class stand on that rock when problems escalate stand on the rock next to god when there's a surge of turmoil we're supposed to rejoice when everybody forsakes you and you're left alone god's with you what does it matter you're going through things that nobody understands god is there with you he not only understands it he allowed it to happen to you for a purpose beyond the flesh about her character about about becoming his bride he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you even to the end so i'll say like this when god shows you something when he speaks to you you need to learn to stand there don't just say oh yeah stand there stand where he tells you stay put on the rock because that rock is there for a reason he spoke that for a reason it's a rock in a weary land we're in a weary time if you stay on the rock you will remain protected it's a calm from the storm it's a piece in a world full of anxiety and fears and the cares of this life it's it's like a trap coming on the world yes sir isaiah 26 3 says thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee that little bird didn't have anything to worry about he wasn't like whoa what if i was out there no i'm right here protected we need to keep our mind on christ don't need to figure out anything amen all we got to do is hear his voice now the rock is his word revealed to you personally god told me to stand here on this but he didn't speak it to you you don't know where to stand yet we could read it we could read something out of the bible uh confess your faults one to another pray one for another but if that's not spoken to you personally you're not sure how to interpret that so the rock is not just well it's the bible it's the message it's christ it's got to be spoken to you personally that becomes your rock it's god's rock but when he speaks it to you it now becomes your rock he shares the rock with you and nothing can move you until then you're not sure where i where i stand where do i stand lord when he speaks to you personally that's god showing you where to stand where the rock is actually at my opinion doesn't get the job done i can give you three or four different ideas what we can try to do to fix this problem but what we need is the rock we need his voice and i'll tell you it's around us the world fumbling around in darkness trying to figure out how to survive they don't even know who to look to for leadership sometimes they want to quote somebody and sometimes they don't depend if it agrees with them or not but god has not left his little bride in the dark he has given her a rock to stand on a light to see and ears to hear he is speaking to her his will and that has become the rock for her amen amen she's standing right there on the rock of his word and you know what she's obeying it because that's it isn't just i don't got a rock here iraq isn't just knowledge of the bible it's he's a person and that person individually customizes the rocks for you because he knows what you're going through he knows your situation he knows what you're battling but when he speaks differently it's still the same rock customized for you but nothing can take that place not a person's opinion not experience what he usually has me do do he may want you to go this way sometimes he wants me to say maybe he wants to not say anything we don't know that's why we gotta we gotta wait on the lord until he speaks to us personally in other words it's no longer just saying wow i spent some time in prayer but i know i need to pray some more what we need to do is stay there until we hear from god it's something that we need to practice because all of us could stand we for hours could talk about all the needs that we have so we're not lacking things to talk to the lord about we're lacking spending time getting serious with the lord without that voice church attendance doesn't do it and even jesus said they think they're going to be heard for their much speaking in their prayers so it's about being real with god it's about being real with god being sincere with god being being lord i place myself on the altar here today when he speaks to you it's now your vision it is clear as anything there's the rock there's where i stand and here i'll stand until he tells me to move his rock has become her rock and she shall not be moved hebrews chapter 12 verse 28 hebrews chapter 12 verse 28 wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear you would think if we receive the kingdom we can do what we want but the first thing we need to do is have grace serve god acceptably and you do that with reverence and godly fear the world is groping in darkness not knowing what to do where to go who to look to but the bride has found the only rock that can stand everything that this world is going to be going through and when god speaks to her it becomes personally her rock amen i'll say it like this stay put when he gives it to you it's for you and you alone psalms 119 verse 105 says thy word is a lamp unto my feet it is a light onto my path when he speaks then you can see because that's the word we know this word is a lamp we know that we know god sent a prophet to interpret to rightly divinely interpret the word we know that but the bride my sheep hear my voice that's the rock for them god is not going to come and speak to me about your situation i don't know why there's so many people that want to discuss everything that they think about somebody in somebody's situation i'm not saying god don't do that but i'm here to tell you god hasn't called me to tell you what to do with your i situations god keeps that for himself he doesn't want to share his glory with nobody he wants you to get alone with him now i know this is children we've all had children except you and you and you and player but the point that i'm trying to say is sometimes you got to tell your children this is what you got to do they need a little help a little a guidance but how would you like it if your neighbor came all over all the time and said this is what i think i would have been watching your son out my window and this is what i think he should be doing you as a parent would say you know thank you but mind your own business is that right okay let let god be god let god be god let's begin to believe we need to pray one for another that god would speak to each one of us personally lead and guide us into all truth look he called you here he'll take you through he that began a good work in you is going to finish it we need to put our trust in god every other voice can bring confusion god's voice is the only voice that straightens the thing out amen oftentimes we really don't know what to do we learn to to make the best decisions ourselves because we have to go through life and we handle natural things the same way we try to fix something we don't know how to do it we fix it we make it worse we we learn how to do it we do it right sometimes it costs us more money and we learn that's kind of life how life is but we ought to be practicing asking god more what to do amen sometimes we're a little bit too wise in our own eyes we think we already know what to do we don't need to listen to google maps we don't need to uh read the instructions we don't need to uh ask uh we don't need to pull out the the recipe we know it by heart or we think we do well we don't we don't need to you know ask our parents anymore because you know we're on our own come on how about uh we don't need to talk to the pastor it's not his job proverbs chapter 3 verse 7 be not wise in your own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil so what is evil what do we what do we need to depart from evil can be making our own choices doing our own will god handle thank you don't need you that's what evil can be be not wise in your own eyes in other words don't think you know what to do all the time proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path we're talking about the rack we're talking about the rock amen we've got to go beyond jesus is the rock we've got to get to the place where he's leading us what to do in our life that's the rock to you personally the choice to fear the lord opens the door to wisdom is that what the bible teaches us and godly wisdom starts with i could be wrong about this as the prophet taught i could be wrong to me that's godly wisdom that respect to god that you could be wrong opens the door now for god to give you direction but we try to bypass that but this is what i think and i should be able to handle this and this is probably what god wants like it doesn't matter what you think god probably wants you to do do you care enough to to wait on the lord and listen to the lord and see if he speaks about ask him about lord what would you want this time making the choice to lean not to your own understanding it opens the door to trust it's really hard to trust the lord if you keep leaning to your own understanding you've got to make a decision i could be wrong i'm not going to lean to my own understand this situation that opens the door to trust amen now when you trust the lord with all your heart it opens the door for a conversation with god amen you begin to acknowledge him lord you see the situation you know what i'm going through i need direction from you amen that gives a chance for the lord to direct your path but without it how is he going to do it he's not going to use my proud mind brother mark he's not going to use what i think i could be wrong i'm not going to lean to that understanding i'm going to take time to knock on the door lord what would you have me to do here show me i could be wrong you've got to talk to the lord first he's not going to direct you don't expect god to direct your path without talking to him he wants a relationship amen and it all starts at the beginning of wisdom i could be wrong if any man lack wisdom in any situation let him ask of god liberally and and god will grant it but he's got to ask he's got to start the conversation with god he's got to say lord i don't know what to do here i need wisdom i need you to direct me and god says okay i'll just give it why the mere fact that he's asking in faith that he's putting his trust in god that god was going to give it to him because a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways once god has spoken to you and giving you direction that is the rock where he wants you to stand now stand on what he has shown you and stay put amen this is important if you just you just going through all the things that we've we've read about can you imagine if that bird said okay here's the cleft of the rock this is where i'm supposed to be and he just decides to dash out in the storm and sail through the storm and oh yeah i'm some big bird because i know where the cleft is at you stay in the cleft until the storm is over yes that's what the club's for we don't want to be blazing some new trails upon this rock i'll stand and the gates of house shall not prevail against it when god speaks to you personally this is what to do this is my will for your life stand on the rock amen everyone's standing somewhere everyone stands up everybody's following somebody and everybody's standing somewhere we just need to take inventory of who we're following and what we're standing on matthew chapter 7 verse 24 therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and do with them in other words you're standing on the rock you're not just being a hero of the word but a doer i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rains descend the floods came the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock a solid foundation this is what god wanted i i could go back in my life and i could a number of things hearing the voice of god telling me what to do i do not expect god to tell you what i need to do and do not expect me to tell you what god wants you to do but i hope you have faith in the office that god has put for your leadership [Music] because if you have it right god will be speaking to you from this place [Music] and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not just add one more word shall be likened unto a very very very very very foolish man which built his house upon the sand now did you know that sand are just little pieces of rock same material but they're just little pieces think about that just little pieces take a little here a little this little that a little this but just not solid i don't think i really need to do exactly what god's telling me to do i mean for the most part i do but you know i don't need to let's see what happens well the rains descended the floods came the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell it didn't fall a little the bible says and great was the fall of it in other words there is no comfort in just taking little bits and pieces of the bible and say this is what i believe you've got to take from cover to cover word upon word line upon line you need it all we need it all the rock becomes our comfort it becomes our shelter it becomes our refuge it becomes the direction for our life it becomes our peace there's no peace outside of christ the benefits of trusting in the rock isaiah 26 verse 3 isaiah 26 3 the benefits of trusting in iraq thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me why because he trusteth in thee the benefits of trusting you know it's hard to do i remember all of my children driving for the first times in the vehicle with them i was so used to getting the back seat buckle up i'm driving and now they reach that age where you got to sit in the side seat over here and hand them the steering wheel and then you got to trust trusting the lord is hard but he's he's not a baby it isn't like he's learning to guide your life he already knows how to guide your life the reason it's hard to trust the lord is because we're so full of trust in herself he does a much better job if i look back i just say this with all my heart i'd make some major changes in my life i would have made some different decisions think about that the devil's still the devil he still tries to trick us deceive us we have a rock but the word that he speaks to us is so real it is a solid foundation for our life it's not about now how we feel it's about our future that's the reason that we got to stand on what he told us to do amen if we don't anything else is going to sink and eventually whatever we're building is going to deteriorate and come down are you with me proverbs chapter 16 verse 20 he that handleth a matter wisely shall find good and who so trusteth in the lord happy happy how many wants happiness trust the lord when you can really give it over to him happiness comes you may not know exactly what's going to happen but you know it's going to be good it's like our brother was saying in our men's meeting everything that god did at the beginning he said it is good everything he created it is good so whatever you committed to god's hands it's going to be good and whatever you try to get involved with it'll turn up not as good maybe even bad amen having a rock is something worth praising god for we need to thank the lord for the rock psalm 62 verse 6 he only is my rock psalm 62 6 he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense you don't need to defend yourself he is your defense i shall not be moved because you're on the rock in god is my salvation my glory the rock of my strength strength as a rock my and my refuge is in god amen i am scared honestly i'll be honest with you i am totally scared of making my decisions but when he makes it that's my refuge that's my rock the gates of hell it doesn't matter what happens because he's made the decision he showed me where the rock is and i just okay this is where i stand this is what i believe this is right here why because this is the light he showed to me when he spoke to my heart about the situation and he says stand here in time we'll see amen trust in him at all times not just when it's easy not just when it's obvious trust in him at all times she people pour out your heart before him amen god is a refuge for us i just don't know how god you expect god to ever ever guide you to show you if you don't bring before him your heart he wants a conversation with us amen when david's son died he didn't rejoice over the fact that he died and in fact i can imagine david felt very bad that he died because it was for david's sin and he felt responsible that the death of his own son was because of him so i imagine that he felt bad so he didn't rejoice over the fact that he died but david rejoiced because he had a rock to stand on he knew one day i would see him i would go to him he rejoiced because death wasn't going to separate him nothing is going to separate us from the love of god nothing romans chapter 8 verse 38 for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities or powers nor things present or things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god you talk about a rock you talk about a clef which is in christ jesus our lord david had a rock it was invisible he knew what to do for his situation it didn't matter if he fell he knew what to do it's important for us to know what he wants us to do in our situation it's not good enough to come to church and say well i came to church i heard the word if you don't take it home personally if you don't hear personally from god what he wants you to do i'm going to ask you what is the rock what is the rock to you it's got to be real we've gotta we've gotta if you want if you want this church if you want the word that comes forth from this church to help your personal lives then you've got to hear from god when the word is being preached you cannot expect okay uh account number five six the bank your license plate number it's not like that it's hearing that still small voice in the midst of all the all the other stuff that's banging and going around in the fires and you've got to be in that little cleft of the rock with god you hear that voice this is where you stand this is what you do then you're protected no matter what you're going through no matter what you're experiencing remember the rock that god has for you he is he has a rock next to him that he's play he's wanting to place you on that rock if you're not there all you do is acknowledge him he will direct your path he will show you where the rock is he'll show you where to stand in your situation we serve a personal god with personal relationships he he is touched by the feelings of your infirmities he knows exactly what you're going through and he cares taking time to remember that there's a rock for you amen let's stand together we want to go stand on that rock make it your personal right claim it amen like that it's in that little course jesus i'm depending on you that's what we need to do jesus i'm depending on you jesus i'm depending on you [Music] jesus i'm depending on you depending on you to see me through [Music] oh jesus we're depending on you jesus we're depending on you jesus we're depending on you depending on you to see us through o jesus and depending on you jesus i'm depending on you jesus and depending on you depending on you to see me through amen you know what you're saying you're just saying jesus i'm not leaning to my own understanding amen let's sing the solid rock amen the solid rock my hope is built on nothing less than jesus blood and righteousness i dare not trust the sweetest frame but holy land on jesus [Music] sinking sand all other ground is sinking sand when darkness seems to hide his faith i rest on his unchanging grace in every high and stormy gale my anchor holds within the bell on christ's solid rockets and all other ground is sinking sand [Music] [Music] rock i stand on underground is sinking sand all other ground is sinking sand when he shall come with trumpets out oh may i then in him be found dressed in his righteousness alone thoughtless to stand before the throne on christ's solid rock i stand all over the ground is sinking sand all other ground is sinking sand [Applause] [Music] amen we have a rock a solid rock amen amen it's i just love it that god could speak to all of us about our personal lives all at the same time and now we got the light what to do that's why it's important to come to church with purpose because if you're serious god seriously amen he's looking for those that be want to be serious with him amen amen let's sing the rock of ages cleft for me amen it's a time for you to worship the lord with all your heart [Music] rock of ages clap for me let me hide myself in thee let the water and the blood crown thy wounded sight which flowed me [Music] [Applause] [Music] good [Music] in my hand no price i bring simply to the cross i clean while i draw this leading breath when my eyes shall close in death when i rise to worlds unknown and behold beyond thy throne rock of ages [Music] amen praise the lord let's look to the lord in prayer at this time our gracious heavenly father we want to thank you for being a rock lord it's not hard for me to look back one time in my life where i didn't even know there was a rock that existed i didn't know that that there was a truth
