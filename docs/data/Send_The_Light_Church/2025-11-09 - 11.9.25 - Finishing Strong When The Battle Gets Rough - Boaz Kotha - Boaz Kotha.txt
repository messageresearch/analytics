The angels beckoned me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel that home in this world anymore. They're all expecting me. And that's one thing I know.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Greetings everyone in the name of Jesus Christ. It's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said where two or three are gathered uh he will be in the midst of us and we are more than two and three. Amen. Thank the Lord for the goodness he has bestowed on every one of us and so grateful to God that God has uh once again you know made a way for me to come by uh this place and share with you what the Lord is doing and he's going to do and he's done in our lives. Uh thank you brother John for giving me this place and appreciate it and the lord bless you. You know let us read from the word of god 2 Timothy chapter 4 verse 7 and 8. It's a very familiar scripture and uh we might have heard many sermons on this uh the scriptures but you know one thing I have found out that every time I read a scripture or I go through a scripture it's new to us you know so so let us uh listen let us wait upon the lord and see what the lord has in store for us this morning you know uh let us be attentive let us give the lord his place so that he can do great wonders and miracles in our life. 2 Timothy chapter 4 7 and 8. I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day. and not to me only but unto all them also that love is appearing. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. May the Lord bless you this morning. Once again, I would like to thank the bride of Jesus Christ. I would like to thank the man of God, brother John, for giving me this place. And you know, um I pray that my presence here uh the time I stand would be a great blessing to every one of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. have not come with any different doctrine or different things but I only have come with the pure unadulterated one of word of god you know so I would like to just give a brief uh uh a short uh report on what the lord has been doing uh the lord is good after I left in uh during my last trip went back to India I baptized about 67 new souls &gt;&gt; and I thank the lord for his grace and mercy. &gt;&gt; Just before I came within a span of 13 days, I baptized about 32 people and that was a great blessing for me and the ministry also that you know there's one thing about uh saving souls you know and uh you get so much of peace and joy. uh you go through stress in life, you go through ups and downs in life, but you know when it comes to soul-winning you know &gt;&gt; it's something different you know &gt;&gt; there's so much of peace and there is so much of joy in it that you know you are doing something for the Lord Jesus Christ and I'm so thankful to God that God has made me able to be a part of his vineyard you know and we are all the workers of his vineyard we are all you know partakers of you know everything we do to serve the lord and bring glory to god. So I'm just a little part of that you know a little tool which god is using me in the nation of India. Uh the situation back home uh the persecution is is very much on the rise since I left in May. You know it has been very bad. you know the government is trying to bring so many rules and so many regulations you know and uh on the 29th October you know um the 13th state of our c of of our country has come with the anti-conversion law so day by day each state are embracing this anti-conversion law and it is putting us preachers in trouble you know so uh it's not yet come into our state but I truly believe that you know the the prime minister of our country is trying to uh force you know this bill to be passed in all the 29 states and and the few union territories in India so it's a squeeze squeezing time you know you know it's a time to wrap up you know the prophet said it's a time to unpack ourself you know you know and wait for the coming of the lord you Because very soon, one day we have to take a solo flight. You know, &gt;&gt; we have to meet the rapture. You know, is there anybody who doesn't think of the rapture here? &gt;&gt; No one. Amen. Everybody is thinking about the rapture, you know. What a glorious day that will be that we will all see him face to face, you know. So, uh the Lord is good. I bring greetings from my family, you know, and uh God has blessed me with, you know, four children, you know, three daughters and one son, one son-in-law and one daughter-in-law and two grandchildren, Jason and Josie. You know, uh please remember Josie in your prayers. She's having a little bit of breathing problem, breathing issues. And uh the doctor says so many things but you know I believe the great physician Jesus Christ who is in the midst of us. So uh please remember Josie in your prayers. She's just 5 years old you know the other day u she was crying and she was battling for you know to breathe and uh but the Lord is good you know she's I just spoke to them this morning and they are doing better you know. So when it's morning here it's night over there you know. So it's almost a big uh I'm still fighting the jet lag. So pray for me too. You know that uh the remaining trip would be a blessing not only to me but also to the ministry back home. You know we sure appreciate uh what the send of send the light is doing. Amen. Uh this church has been a great blessing as well as uh a part and parcel of our ministry in India. you know, &gt;&gt; I I truly want to thank the almighty God first and then I would like to thank uh the man of God, brother John, you know, so he's such a wonderful man of God, you know, I don't want to praise a man, but I want to praise the God who is in that man, you know, such a caring and uh personality and loving personality, you know, and I I surely appreciate God and I thank God for bringing him and his family and the church, send the light church into our lives and to our ministry in India. &gt;&gt; Just pray for us that we will be more faithful, you know, to take care of those orphans and leprosy people and also uh take care of the elderly and the widows and and the ministers you know who are working in association with us, you know, and we are trying to do what best we can do. Um the road is rough you know but as the sermon title says we need to finish strong you know finishing strong when the battle gets rough you know when the battle get fierce you know so that is the only time that we need to stand up guard our loins and we need to face the heat of the battle you know &gt;&gt; the prophet of god said that it's Christian life is not a flowery bed of ease you know you know it's not the bed of roses but it is always you know we have to go through trials and troubles in our life you know and I always share it with myself my family and the and the family of God I say I would rather walk with Christ in the dark valley you know in the lowest valleys than to walk in the light alone you know &gt;&gt; I don't want to be alone anywhere whether it is darkness or whether it is light but I want my Christ to be with me. So please pray for the souls which are being won and you know that they would be faithful you know because our government is trying to uh threaten them and make them you know bring them back to recon conversion into Hinduism you know so but the seed is the seed you know &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; the shak is the shock it has to go away you know and I truly believe that you know uh as the persecution is on the rise Guys, I have seen that God is working in many of the lives of the people in India. &gt;&gt; Many are thirsting for the word of God. Many are coming into the light of this this great message of the hour. You know, &gt;&gt; many people are giving their hearts to Christ. So, that's the good sign. You know, &gt;&gt; I don't care, you know, how much squeeze is going to come or how much pressure is going to come. You know the prophet of God said you know it's a contest between two strengths the great strength of God and the great strength of the enemy you know &gt;&gt; but who will win &gt;&gt; the Bible has already said you know that we will win that's why Paul boldly could say nay in all things we are more than conquerors so I truly believe that you know uh let us live with that attitude and let us go forward marching you know We need to finish strong. &gt;&gt; We need to endure it till the end. It doesn't matter how much the battle is going to be rough and fierce. You know, it's good to serve the Lord when you are sick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I would rather be a sick man and serve the Lord than to be a a good man or a you know strong man and then not to serve the Lord, you know. So, so it's all about what we are doing in our situations, in our circumstances, you know. As I woke up this morning, I could see everything white, you know, and snow everywhere. So, it gives me joy when I see the snow, you know, but uh a little snow is good, you know, but more I I think I would be in big trouble, you know. So because I come from a country you know which has got so much of heat you know and uh I'm not used to the sweaters and all those things you know so but you know when I see people everywhere you know wearing sweaters and caps you know and shoes and everything so it makes me wonder how they are able to survive you know so but but thank god you know that uh the the the place here is warmer you know it's it's Good to serve the Lord this morning. Nice to see every one of you. You know I would like to just talk for few not much time but you know just encourage you and you know comfort you with the word of God. You know here we see the life of Apostle Paul. &gt;&gt; That man is such a great example for every one of us. You know here we see that you know Apostle Paul when he writes this you know he's near the nearing the end of his life you know &gt;&gt; but he's reflecting his journey of faith here you know you know he's boldly he's not talking about his merits he's not talking about his achievements you know he's in the end of his life he's in the prison you know but he's declaring that he has faithfully endured every battles of life which he has come through and gone through. You know see today we need to be in such a position that as we walk in this journey as we go forward we need to reflect also on our walk before the walk which we started many years ago. You know &gt;&gt; how our walk has been with the Lord. You know, you know how we have been in the valleys, how we have been in the mountains, you know, because we believe the Bible says our God is not only the God of the mountain, but he is also the God of the valley. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we need to reflect sometimes you know we have become so busy you know and I always say you know we are busy for nothing you know &gt;&gt; many a times you you just talk to anybody they say I am busy I am busy but I think you know we are busy for nothing you know &gt;&gt; people have learned the art of doing nothing that's true you know people have learned the art of doing nothing you You know &gt;&gt; that's why they are busy you know &gt;&gt; sometimes I wonder you know come to the field in India come to the you know the ministry see the ministry in India there is so much to do you know but there are very few to do you know &gt;&gt; harvest is plenty but the laborers are few we need to realize we need to reflect we need to take time in our life to See how our walk has been all these years, you know. &gt;&gt; Look at this man. You know, he's he's is shackled. He's in chains. He's bound in chains. You know, he's in such a critical situation. But look, he's not looking at his pain. He's not looking at the battle he's going through. He's not looking at the thorns he has in his life, but he's looking more forward. Here we see you know he has faithfully declaring that he has faithfully endured the battles of life. He has completed the mission God gave him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that we are here for a purpose? &gt;&gt; Amen. We are all here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; You know we are not here for a picnic. The prophet said you know &gt;&gt; it's a battleground. That's right. You know we are not on a picnic. You know, we are here for a purpose. Brothers and sisters, here he's declaring that he has faithfully endured the battles of life, completed the mission God gave him, and he says, "I have remained true to the word, true to the gospel." Look at this. In confidence and hope, he looks forward to receiving the eternal reward. You know &gt;&gt; what is that reward? He talks about the crown of righteousness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Who will give that crown? The righteous judge Jesus Christ. You know &gt;&gt; not say look look he's not only talking about him you know he passes. He says not only me but everyone who will see his appearing. You know &gt;&gt; look at his appearing. You know he assures believers that this reward is not just for him but all those who long for the return of Christ. &gt;&gt; Why we have gathered here? Why we are even though it is snowing outside there are many people who are sitting at home but why you have come here? Why you have gathered here? &gt;&gt; Because we want to be in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I pray my brothers, my sister, it won't be a wonder or it won't be a you know nothing to think or be amazed about. Maybe the coming of the Lord might come as we are here today. &gt;&gt; I pray you know as the word of God says the creation is groaning for his coming. &gt;&gt; We are all looking forward for his coming. Yes. &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you my brothers, as far as possible, as long as we are upon this earth, we need to fight this battle. &gt;&gt; We need to finish strong. &gt;&gt; I know maybe the battle is not yet rough. It will get rough. &gt;&gt; More worse time is coming in our lives. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And we have to be prepared for that battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so sad to, you know, hear about the passing of of brother, you know, Bruce. You know, &gt;&gt; it was really a shock to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every time I would come, I would see him leading the songs, you know. &gt;&gt; And sometimes my brothers, my sisters, I feel, you know, my daddy always said when he was, you know, lying down with liver cancer, you know, he gave up. He said, "I want to go." And you know what he said? Is it maybe the Lord this is the avenues this is the channel you know sickness called cancer which is a way for me to go home you know that's true sometimes our sicknesses become aware for us to go onto the other side you know &gt;&gt; but the one who we are yet here we have a great responsibility today &gt;&gt; then we need to stand guard our loins and fight this battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message the beginning and the ending of the gentile dispensation he says if there is no battles there is no victories. &gt;&gt; Before you can have a victory there has to be a battle. &gt;&gt; If there is no battles there is no victories. So we ought to be thankful for the battles and the trying. It's God giving us the opportunity to have victories in our life. &gt;&gt; If there's no battle, there's no victories in our life. The prophet said God is getting his soldiers ready for the battle. He says the army that's getting ready for a battle first it's got to select some soldiers. They've got to be dressed for fighting. They have got to be trained for fighting. Says I believe that the greatest battle that was ever fought now is now ready to go in action. He says I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers. I believe he's been dressing them, training them, and the battlefront is now set, getting ready to start. Look at the words of Paul here. You know, he's in such a situation, a miserable condition in his life. He's in the dungeon. The prophet said he is in the dungeon. He's not in a position even to see anything. The whole body it's bleeding is in such a circumstances all he can talk about is pain pain how we do but look at his boldness look at his courage he says I have fought a good fight &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; I've not only fought a good fight but I have finished my course. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not only I have finished my course, but I have kept my faith. &gt;&gt; We can't leave one and hold to other. We can't hold one and leave the other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to fight. &gt;&gt; We need to press on. &gt;&gt; We need to keep. &gt;&gt; These three things are very important today. He says, "I have fought a good fight." And here Paul is trying to use this image of a soldier or an athlete. You know, the prophet said the Christian life is a spiritual battle. Battle against sin, temptation, false doctrines, persecution, discouragements in our life. But Paul says he didn't give up. &gt;&gt; Amen. He remained courageous and obedient fighting for truth and righteousness. &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said? The greatest battle that was ever fought was in the mind. &gt;&gt; The greatest battle ever fought is in the human mind. You got to stand with the word just like Jesus did. &gt;&gt; What is mind? It's the mutual ground for the battle. And says in this there's a mutual ground. No man's land. For example, if I want to fight with with brother John, you know, I would tell him, you know, come to India, come to Hyderabbad, you know, and fight. let us fight and he will say no come to heartland and we will fight there but there's a mediator here brother Ron says you don't go to India or no you don't go to heartland but you know you you come to this church place and you fight there you know what is that this is the place it's a mutual ground you know &gt;&gt; for the battle and that's the way our mind the prophet said it's a mutual ground Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a no man's land and they fight here at this place, a mutual meeting place. &gt;&gt; He says when this great battle started on the earth, there had to be a mutual meeting place. &gt;&gt; There had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and the battlegrounds begins in the human mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's where the battle starts. &gt;&gt; Amen. The human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was to begin. And that is because that decisions are made from the mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the devil chose the head of a man and God chose the heart of a person. &gt;&gt; Now you got to meet your enemy where it's in the mind. You got to make your choices where in your mind. You know I was just going through the the messages you know I never knew before you know but when I went through that message from that time there the prophet is talking he was a professional boxer he says when I was a young boy I was fighting in the golden gloves and then from there went into professional fighting and won 15 straight professional fights but he says I came to the Lord. &gt;&gt; He says, "When I came to the Lord, I finished my carrier of fighting. The first night I met the Lord Jesus, that settled it, you know." And he says, "I have a new opponent." He says, "I I'm not fighting with my brothers. I have a new opponent, the devil. And I know you have to watch him because he hits low and fall &gt;&gt; and all of his licks are like that. But I'm so glad that we have a real referee. &gt;&gt; A real one. That's our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the captain of our salvation. &gt;&gt; Brothers, sisters, church of the living God. Sometimes in our life, we'll be all alone. Remember, when others leave you alone and run away, you can't run away with them. You have to stand courageously. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to stand there and fight your battle. Be bold, courageous, because it's not your battle. It's the battle of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says it's the Lord's battle and he will fight for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we need to stand there. We need to be ready. We need to be trained. We need to be dressed for the battle. &gt;&gt; Yes. The Bible talks about he has not left us without warning. 1 Peter 5:8 said, "Be sober, vigilant, because your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has not left us without a warning. Neither he has left us without an example. You know I was going through what example you know the prophet talks about the Bible talks about you know he talks about Nehemiah you know 4:16 and 17 he says and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my servants wrought in the world and the other half of them held both spears the shields and the boughs and the habedians and the rulers were beyond all the house of Judah. You know they which build it. Now look at this. They which build it on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that laid it. Everyone with one of his hands wrought in his world in the world and with the other and held a weapon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What were they doing? They were busy building &gt;&gt; and busy fighting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is what we need to do. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to build. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We need to fight. We need to work. We need to fight. We need to eat. We need to fight. We need to sit. We need to fight. We need to sleep. We need to fight. &gt;&gt; We can't escape this battle. &gt;&gt; We can't. Sometimes, you know, when the when I go through stress and trials in my life, I say, Lord, why me only? &gt;&gt; Sometimes we do that. &gt;&gt; Why me? But there is a purpose that in this battle we need to win victory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Victory is ours. My brothers, my sisters, you know the Bible says the enemy comes from all the sides. But thank God he lifts our standards. Amen. &gt;&gt; When enemy comes like a flood, &gt;&gt; the Lord himself will raise lift our standards. And we have experienced it many times in our life. &gt;&gt; When the enemy comes, I was going through this message. He says it will come. The enemy will come only during the harvest. Talks about the Philistines. He says, "When the Philistines came, the people in the fields fled away." He talks about the only man Shamgar who killed 600 Philistine, 600 men with just an ox goat. &gt;&gt; He says when the Philistine came, the people in the field fled away. This lets us know that the enemy most likely come in the time of harvest. It was a time when most of the people were occupied in business of getting their crops in. Why the enemy came? The enemy came for two reasons. To inflict casualties to destroy the crops. What did the enemy found? The verse tells us that when the enemy came all the people fled from before them. And the prophet said, "Sounds just like some of the church doesn't, doesn't it?" He says, "Things will be going along just fine. And the devil will stir up trouble. He will use someone in the church to start a ruckus. When this happens, 99% of the people the church flee from the scene of the battle. No one wants to take a stand. &gt;&gt; After all, we don't want to hurt anyone's feeling." He says, "Now we need to realize that this is the reason many churches are falling apart. No one has the courage to stand up against the enemy." &gt;&gt; What is that in your hand? He says, "Shamar, son of Anath, judge of Israel and a farmer." He says, "Shamar." He looked around. He thought, "Well, I'm not a soldier. I can't fight. I don't know nothing about fighting." He says, "I ain't got time to get out there and learn how to dwell so I can fight these fellas." But he just got all stirred up &gt;&gt; and he looked up laying on the shelf and there laid an ax gold. They punched the cattle into their stalls and maybe when they are plowing they ra the dirt of the end of the plow and old ox go. You know what did Shamgar do? He didn't have time to train to fight. When everybody fled, when everybody run away, he was all by himself. He says he was a farmer. He didn't know nothing about fighting, but it was time to fight. &gt;&gt; If there was ever a time to fight, my brothers, my sister, this is the time to fight the enemy. &gt;&gt; This is the time to finish strong &gt;&gt; when the battle against us is raging. He took a decision when everybody left him. He stood alone. He didn't know nothing about fighting. But it was time to fight. And he said, "One thing I know, I am an Israelite." Hallelujah. I'm circumcised. I am in the covenant. God Jehovah is with me, &gt;&gt; brother. The prophet said, brother, he grabbed that ox go. The only thing he could get in his hand was an ox code. And out that door he went and he slew 600 Philistines. &gt;&gt; The Philistines were armed. Was the power in that ox? No. &gt;&gt; Was power in in Shamgar? No. It was the power of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the psalmist said, "If thousand on this side and 10,000 on this side, yet will I." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We need to stand today. &gt;&gt; We need to be bold and be courageous. &gt;&gt; God wants us to be victorious, brothers and sisters. The prophet said in Elijah and Alicia message, he says, "It's high time to be on our toes. You have to be certainly be on your toes when you are fighting this great enemy. I'm certainly happy having nothing against the arenas and sports when it's clean. It's very fine thing. I just don't listen to them or nothing because it was in my blood. So I just keep away from it. He says but I got such a great fight now and such an awful enemy and this fellow is not my body. Is our enemy our buddy? &gt;&gt; No. He says, "This fellow is not my body. He's my enemy." That's right. &gt;&gt; The devil. He says, "But I'm so thankful that I got so much sitting around." Faith. What it takes to defeat this enemy? And God will grant you that faith. And Paul is boldly talking that I fight the if I fight the good fight of faith. I fought a good fight. Why he could do that? Why he could be victorious? Why he could, you know, win? You know what the prophet said? Paul got rid of his ecclesiastical armor. Because he got rid of his armor, his education, he could challenge death and grave. Perfect strength by perfect weakness. He says when he got the rid when he got rid of the armor, you know, he took off the ecclesiastical armor. He says he did like David did. He said when Saul come to the end of the road, he said I have fought a good fight. That was the last enemy to conquer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Death is the last enemy to conquer. &gt;&gt; He says that was the last enemy to conquer. He said I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. He says henceforth there is laid up for me a crown that the Lord the righteous judge will give me at that day. Not only me but all them who love his appearing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh death, oh death said I will get you in few minutes." The grave said I will mold you out yonder. The grave said I will rot you in few minutes. But look at his boldness. He says oh death where is your sting &gt;&gt; grave where is your victory? &gt;&gt; You know the prophet explains this so clearly. He says I know. He says Paul I know I'm laying here in this Roman dungeon bound in chains. My wrist and my hands. I got 39 stripes across my back. I'm here with tears scalding my eyes until I can see no more. I can see with my natural eyes, but I can see a crown of righteousness. &gt;&gt; He's not able to see with his natural eyes. But he says, I can see the crown of righteousness laid up yonder. My ankles are wore out. I have fell off so much from the old molded bread they threw in here. The rats run over me, the spiders all over my body. It's creeping over me till I am weak. But he says he just stand in the face of the death and say where is your sting grave? Where is your victory? With chain shaking on his hands. Hallelujah. He says that's what we need. Grave, where is your victory? Grave said, I will rot you, Paul. He said, but thanks be to God, I have already got the victory through Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's why he could boldly say, I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course. Hebrews 12:12 says, you know, "Wherefore, seeing also our compassion about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience and the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is sat down at the right hand of the throne. throne of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Paul compares his life to a race with a set path marked out by God. He didn't stop halfway. He endured it till the end. Completing the work God assigned to him. And every one of us, each believer has their own course to run today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This reflects purposeful living. Not wandering aimlessly but striving toward a goal with endurance and faithfulness. &gt;&gt; Yes, this Christian life is a race. &gt;&gt; It's a personal calling. Every believer is called to run a personal Godord race. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not about competing with others but fulfilling God's purpose in our life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe, brothers and sisters, God has a purpose for every man and woman &gt;&gt; born into the kingdom of God? &gt;&gt; There is a purpose. There's a race we are running. We must never forget it's an individual affair. God is not interested in a church relationship. God is not interested in a group in an association. No, he's not interested in a group affair. He's looking for a personal individual affair relationship with God. &gt;&gt; Today we need to as we march as we fight this battle as Paul said we need to lay aside every weight and sin. &gt;&gt; Many Christians they failed to run the race because they are burdened by unnecessary weights, worries, distractions or unrepented sins. Brothers and sisters, if you're ever going to do anything for God, what we need to do, we need to get rid of the weights. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything that hinders us, lay it aside. You can't run a race loaded down. You know what will happen when you have everything on? It will slow you down. &gt;&gt; That's why Paul said, "Lay it aside." unbelief, grudges, pride, worldly attachments. You know, &gt;&gt; it's time to unpack, you know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's time to endure with patience. We must run it with patience through trials, persecution, and suffering, looking forward to the crown of life. &gt;&gt; The Christian race is a lifelong commitment. That's why the Bible said, "Patience is virtue." You got to stand the test. Endure it to the end. For the crown is waiting for us. &gt;&gt; I want to encourage my brothers and my sisters. Don't quit in trials. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because during this trial, God is building our character. &gt;&gt; Our victory lies in keeping our eyes on Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The author and the finisher of our faith. You know, the only way to run this race successfully is keeping your my eyes on Jesus. &gt;&gt; Not on the world, not on the failures of others, but on him who never fails. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ himself. He ran his race, endured the cross, and sat down at the right hand of God. So will we if we stay faithful to God. &gt;&gt; Pressing toward the mark. He says we are pressing toward the mark of the high calling. There's a crown waiting for us those who finish. He said don't stop. Don't be discouraged. Just finish your race. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, you're not running in vain. As you run this race, the heaven is watching over you. &gt;&gt; The saints are cheering over you. We need to run our race faithfully and keep our eyes on Jesus &gt;&gt; because our reward is sure. Christ finished his course. Then despite the same but boring and was nailed at Calvary as substitute for us dying in capital punishment born in a stable went out in the capital punishment when their eyes were open. And he says, "If I'm telling you the work is already finished, which the Bible declares that is finished, then what could I do for it? It is already finished. It rest within your personal faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ at Calvary. And by faith, we draw dividends of our exter eternal salvation. This is the earnest of our salvation." &gt;&gt; Amen. Today we need to stand like Paul and say I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course and I have kept my faith despite trials, prison beatings, betrayal and rejection. Paul never abandoned the gospel. He never abandoned this truth. He guarded it. He preached it and he lived it. Amen. &gt;&gt; We as ministers, we need to guard it. &gt;&gt; We need to preach it and we need to live it. &gt;&gt; That's what you have to do. You need to guard this word, this truth. You have to preach it. How? By the life you live. &gt;&gt; We are the written epistles of God read by all men. &gt;&gt; Paul remained loyal to Christ even it costed him everything. at the end of his life is not boasting about his achievements. He's not boasting about his miracles of fame. But he says, "I have kept the faith." In the time of apostasy, compromise and persecution, keeping the faith is not easy, but it is essential. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are living in such a time that keeping the faith is not easy, but it is essential. &gt;&gt; We need to keep the faith. We need to run the race. We need to press on. We need to fight the battle. &gt;&gt; It isn't how you start. It's how you finish. &gt;&gt; Just keep the faith. Stay with the word. What does it mean? You may say, "Brother Bo, what does it mean to keep the faith?" It's nothing but remain true to the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. True to the word, true to the message which God has given to us in this age, not mixing it with man's tradition. We need to hold to the original word with no compromise. What is keeping the faith is holding to the pure unadulterated word of God no matter how unpopular it is. As I said before, a Christian journey is not a pikney. We are in a battle. Deceived church by the deceived world. He says we are not on a picnic. We are in a battlefield. Don't ever get that in your head. For I become a Christian to fight. Amen. Fight the good fight of faith. I become a Christian to get in the battle lines. We are Christian soldiers against the flesh, against the devil, against the false doctrines. &gt;&gt; Amen. To keep that faith, we must fight to hold on to truth. In the world of deception, &gt;&gt; we'll have to fight every inch of the way. You know, brothers and sisters, the road to glory is full of battles, but in every step there is his grace. &gt;&gt; The road to battle is full of battles. Full road to glory is full of battles. But in every step there is the grace of God. That's why he said, "I have fought a good fight of faith. I have finished my course. I have kept my faith." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not only that, he says, "Henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness." Revelation 3:101 said, "Because thou has kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, &gt;&gt; Amen. which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth. &gt;&gt; He says, "Behold, I come quickly. Hold that fast which thou has that no man take thy crown." What crown? The crown of righteousness. That's what Paul is talking about. I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept my faith. I'm waiting for that crown of righteousness which the righteous judge is going to give me. Paul is looking at that reward, a crown given not by man but by Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; He says apostle Paul was not speaking from a place of regret but of victory. He was not looking at the gallows of death but at the gate of glory. Paul's eyes were fixed beyond this life where the crown of righteousness awaited him. What a day that would be brother John. Then we meet him over yonder and he would open arms open wide and he would say well done my faithful son my daughter. The prophet of God said very soon we will meet him at a destination &gt;&gt; and that will be through the valley of the shadow of death. He said either we will meet him as a masterpiece which he has worked upon us or we will meet him as a driftwood drifting floating on the water doesn't know its destination. The same way true every true believer is in the race not for a fading earthly crown but for an eternal reward that the righteous judge Jesus Christ will place upon our head. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know one thing before he gives you the crown of righteousness he will give you the crown of thorns. We have to be ready for that. We happy you know when we receive something good from God you know we are so happy today we talk about oh I'm going to get the crown of righteousness you know but remember the road to glory is full of battles &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; before he gives us that crown of righteousness he will give us a crown of thorn &gt;&gt; it's a battle every day for a Christian but remember you are not fighting for victory victory. You are fighting in victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are not fighting for victory. You are already one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are fighting in victory. That's what Paul is talking about. I can't see anything. I'm bound in chains. But he's looking beyond as a victorious, as an overcomer. He swore by himself. It's time to walk unconsciously. He says you're here to fulfill it. Just walk unconscious of fear. Walk unconscious of criticism. Walk unconscious into the world. Walk as you walk in Christ. Walk with him. Not paying attention to left or to li right. Just keep moving on. He says if something comes up in the church, walk with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If sickness strikes you, walk with God. If the neighbor don't like you, walk with God. Just keep on walking with God. &gt;&gt; What we need to do, brothers and sisters, we need to endure this battle, this race with patience in our life. There are people who are running this race for the crown that is perishable, but we do it for the crown that is imperishable. &gt;&gt; Amen. First Corinthians 9:25 says, "Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things." Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we and incorruptible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Sufferings will come. Sufferings will come to make us perfect. Revelation 2:10 says, "Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that he may be tried, and he shall have tribulation 10 days, be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. &gt;&gt; During these sufferings, brothers and sisters, during the trials we go through, during the sickness we go through, the prophet said, "Great characters are made in this time." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are not made of luxuries. They are made by suffering because the prophet said character is victory and fit to rule. What we need is we need to be overcomers today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to be victorious. We need to finish strong. And the battle is raging over us. It's not going to be easy. I've come here to just encourage you and comfort you that what we need to do is be strong. &gt;&gt; We need to be strong so that we will finish it strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the battle is going to be rough. It's going to be fierce. The storms will come. It will rage over us. But thank God, we need to hold on to his unchanging hands. We need to stand on that rock. The rock called Christ. &gt;&gt; Look at the sufferings of Paul. Five times 39 stripes. Three times beaten with rod. One time stone. Three times suffered shipwreck. So many pains, troubles he had to go. A night and a day been in the deep. journeys often. Perils of water, perils of robbers, perils by my own countrymen, perils by the heathen, in the perils of the city, in the perils and wilderness, in the sea, among false brethren. He says, in weariness and painfulness, in watching often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings, in cold and nakedness, beside those things that are without, that which come upon me daily, cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. But look at him. He says, "Who is weak? I am not weak." Who is offended and I burn not. &gt;&gt; Today we have to be like Paul. &gt;&gt; Have we ever suffered like Paul suffered? &gt;&gt; But how many complaints we have made? You know, &gt;&gt; I always tell my young children at the orphanage, he says, "The more you complain, &gt;&gt; the devil gets the glory." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He will pat on you. He'll pat at the back of you say complain my son. Complain my daughter. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Because God is not getting glory. &gt;&gt; He is getting glory. &gt;&gt; So he wants us to complain. He wants us to murmur. He wants us to stop. He wants us to paralyze. But no, we can't stop. We have to fight. &gt;&gt; We have to fight this battle. We need to endure it with patience. &gt;&gt; Revelation 22:12-4, he says, "Behold, I come quickly. My reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be." He says, "I am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end and the first and the last." He said, "Blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in the in through the gates into the city." Smint and church age. He says the crown of righteousness is for those who stayed with the word no matter what the world said about them. Truth will always bring persecution but it also brings a crown. Amen. &gt;&gt; Truth will bring persecution but remember on the other hand it will bring crown to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which crown the righteous judge Jesus Christ is going to give us. Brothers and sisters, Paul at his end of his earthly journey. He was not speaking in fear or regret or uncertainty. He was speaking with confidence. He was looking beyond the sword of Nero, beyond the dungeon, beyond the trials and persecution. and he saw a crown laid up for him by the righteous judge. Beloved, this is not just Paul's testimony. It's a promise for all those who love his appearing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul had this assurance. His faith had secured him a crown. Paul's confidence was not in his works but in the finished work of Christ. He remained faithful and the faithfulness is always rewarded. The crown is not just for Paul as he mentions. It is for every faithful believer today. &gt;&gt; Paul's testimony can be our testimony. If you fight the good fight, finish the race and keep the faith, there is a crown waiting for us. &gt;&gt; Not a crown of corruption, but a crown of eternal righteousness. As I close, I want to end up with these words. Let us live in such a way that we love his appearing. &gt;&gt; Let us keep our eyes on the crown and not be weary in welloing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Church of the living God, the world may offer pleasures for a season, but Christ offers a crown for eternity. Amen. &gt;&gt; What we need to do, we need to surrender fully to Christ today and one day &gt;&gt; we will finish it strong. &gt;&gt; We'll endure it till the end. You know where our eyes should be on the finishing line. &gt;&gt; Not to the right, not to the left, not to the past which we have left behind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But let us move forward. move on. The devil wants us to stop. But remember, we as the bride of Jesus Christ, we as believers, we need to move forward. What we need to do, let us surrender fully to Christ today. And one day soon, we too shall receive that unfading crown. It's an invitation to all Christians to live with a purpose, purity, and perseverance. What we need today is a purpose in our life, purity in our life and a perseverance. We need to be determined today that no matter how many battles will come in our life, we will finish it stronger. &gt;&gt; Amen. we will move forward because at the end of the day we are waiting for that crown &gt;&gt; the crown of righteousness which our Lord Jesus Christ is going to give to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My prayer today is let us run with patience. &gt;&gt; Let us be like Paul who can boldly say I have fought a good fight. &gt;&gt; I have finished my course and I have kept my faith. These three things are very important. Then only we can meet him there. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it's not enough. It's not easy for us to meet our Lord Jesus Christ. How many of you want to meet him there? Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to meet him. I want to see you all in heaven. &gt;&gt; That's my desire. If you don't want to see me, that's okay. But I want to see you all in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why all these things? Why service after service, church after service? Why we are getting together? Just because we can be ready for that rapture. &gt;&gt; As Revelation speaks about, the bride has made herself ready. And I pray that this bride, this little flock will be ready for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let us run with patience. Let us fight this battle. Let us finish strong. No matter how much the battle rages over us or how much rough it becomes, by the help of the Lord, let us move forward and let us run this race. I thank you for this time and thank you for your patience. &gt;&gt; Just a small encouragement this morning. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord &gt;&gt; that we all have to endure it with patience and finish it. Why? Because only assurance which Christ has given to us on Calvary. He said it is finished. &gt;&gt; With that word we will move forward. Go forward. Remember us in your prayers and I promise you I pray for you all every day &gt;&gt; and I will be praying for you continuing to pray. &gt;&gt; If we don't meet here we'll meet over there. &gt;&gt; Let us pray for one another and let us love one another. Thank you very much for your love, your prayers and for your kindness and for your support from time to time. Thank you brother John for all your love. God bless you all. And I believe we heard that God wants us to be fighting &gt;&gt; as clear as anything. There's a great falling away and God is saying to us fight. &gt;&gt; That means he knows that we're facing decisions in our mind to keep the foot off the gas a little bit or to just coast and you haven't felt that it it's probably coming. &gt;&gt; But we we know God has spoken to us today. Keep pressing. Keep pressing. It's a good word for for us today. Let's let's sing together and sing that little What a day that'll be. &gt;&gt; What a day that'll be.
