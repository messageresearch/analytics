[31:32] so
[31:40] [Music]
[31:58] sorry
[32:05] [Music]
[32:17] it's not hard
[32:19] to believe
[32:22] standing on the mountaintops
[32:26] of glory
[32:30] when you can hear the songs of angels
[32:35] and a breeze from heaven sends your
[32:38] spirit
[32:40] sorry
[32:43] but in the valley once more
[32:48] will jesus still be lord
[32:52] that's the question
[32:55] [Music]
[33:01] for believing
[33:03] when believing
[33:05] isn't easy
[33:08] that is the testing
[33:11] [Music]
[33:16] i
[33:17] need faith for the times when the sun
[33:23] does not shine
[33:26] and the mountaintop
[33:28] is just a
[33:30] memory
[33:32] [Music]
[33:33] when there's no sign to be seen
[33:38] and i don't feel a thing
[33:42] to the word of god alone
[33:46] i must clean
[33:49] i
[33:50] need faith for the day
[33:54] when trouble comes my way
[33:58] and i just don't
[34:00] understand what it means
[34:04] [Music]
[34:06] that's when nothing else will do
[34:10] faith alone will get me through
[34:14] and believing
[34:17] becomes my victory
[34:26] it's not hard to believe
[34:31] when things are going well and skies are
[34:35] sunny
[34:37] [Music]
[34:39] when you feel you're making progress
[34:43] doing good
[34:45] living in a time of plenty
[34:48] [Music]
[34:51] but if all of that should change
[34:54] would you still keep the faith
[34:58] that's the question
[35:02] [Music]
[35:06] for believing when believing
[35:10] isn't easy
[35:13] that is the testing
[35:21] i
[35:22] need
[35:22] faith for the times
[35:26] when the sun does not shine
[35:30] and the mountaintop
[35:32] is just a
[35:34] memory
[35:37] when there's no sign to be seen
[35:42] and i don't feel a thing
[35:45] to the word of god alone
[35:49] i must clean
[35:52] i
[35:53] need
[35:54] faith for the day
[35:57] when trouble comes my way
[36:01] and i just don't
[36:03] understand what it means
[36:08] that's when nothing else will do
[36:12] faith alone will get me through
[36:16] and believing
[36:18] becomes my victory
[36:24] that's when nothing else will do
[36:28] faith alone will get me through
[36:32] and believing
[36:34] becomes my victory
[36:37] [Music]
[36:42] [Applause]
[36:49] the scripture says
[36:51] this is the victory that over the world
[36:53] given
[36:54] our faith
[36:57] without faith
[36:58] we can't make it without faith we can't
[37:00] please him

[40:39] ago he had a service on a thursday night
[40:41] and a friday night
[40:42] to fit me in between preaching um
[40:45] in lima and then also preaching in uh
[40:49] ottawa lake and
[40:50] he found out i was in town he said can
[40:52] you preach i said well i'm only in town
[40:54] wednesday through sunday and i'm already
[40:55] preaching wednesday and sunday he said
[40:56] what are you doing thursday night and
[40:57] friday night
[40:58] and we ended up having preaching on a
[41:00] thursday and friday night and i was the
[41:02] first minister they ever had guest
[41:04] minister they ever had in the church
[41:06] after it started that year so i feel
[41:08] like i'm part of the beginning
[41:10] and i feel like i'm the last one to
[41:12] preach in the new building though but
[41:13] it's uh
[41:15] but we're happy to be able to be here
[41:16] tonight and see god blessing still
[41:18] persevering and continuing just seeing
[41:21] god adding to the ministry and to the
[41:23] work and
[41:24] it just shows that you don't labor in
[41:26] vain when you labor for the things of
[41:28] god
[41:29] so we're happy to be here and considered
[41:31] a great honor and privilege to be able
[41:32] to minister this is home for us
[41:34] and we appreciate the privilege james
[41:37] chapter 2
[41:38] i'd like to read verse start with verse
[41:40] 20
[41:41] read to verse 24 then i also like to
[41:43] read
[41:45] in the book of romans
[41:47] and
[41:49] not sure
[41:50] just how far we can get tonight if the
[41:52] lord terry's and we're here on sunday
[41:53] morning he would continue to lead like
[41:55] to pick up
[41:56] on the same subject that we're
[41:57] ministering tonight so i i appreciate
[41:59] the opportunity just to take my time
[42:01] with the subject
[42:02] james chapter 2
[42:04] verse 20 but will thou know o vain man
[42:07] that faith without works is dead
[42:10] was not abraham our father justified by
[42:12] works when he had offered isaac his son
[42:15] upon the altar
[42:16] see us thou how faith wrought with his
[42:18] works and by works was faith made
[42:20] perfect and the scripture was fulfilled
[42:23] which saith abraham believed god and it
[42:24] was imputed unto him for righteousness
[42:26] and he was called the friend of god you
[42:29] see then how that by works a man is
[42:31] justified and not by faith
[42:33] only
[42:34] and then james chapter four
[42:37] excuse me romans chapter four
[42:39] romans chapter 4
[42:41] verses 12 to 18.
[42:48] says romans chapter 4 verse 12 and the
[42:51] father of circumcision so speaking of
[42:53] abraham and the father circumcision to
[42:55] them who are not of the circumcision
[42:56] only but who also walk in the steps of
[42:59] that faith of our father abraham which
[43:01] he had
[43:02] being yet uncircumcised for the promise
[43:05] that he should be the heir of the world
[43:06] was not to abraham or his seed through
[43:09] the law
[43:10] but through the righteousness of faith
[43:12] for they which are of the law be heirs
[43:14] faith is made void and the promise made
[43:17] of none effect
[43:18] because the law worketh wrath for where
[43:20] no law is there is no transgression
[43:22] therefore it is of faith that it might
[43:24] be by grace to the end of the promise
[43:26] might be sure to all
[43:28] the seed not to that
[43:30] only which is of the law but to that
[43:32] also which is a faith of it the faith of
[43:34] abraham who is the father of us all as
[43:38] it is written i've made thee a father of
[43:39] many nations before him whom he believed
[43:41] even god who quickeneth the dead and
[43:43] calleth those things which be not as
[43:45] though they were who against hope
[43:47] believed in hope that he might be the
[43:49] father of many nations according to that
[43:51] which was spoken so shall thy seed
[43:55] be
[43:55] amen if we could just bow our heads in
[43:57] prayer our gracious heavenly father we
[43:59] considered a wonderful privilege to be
[44:01] together this evening as family on these
[44:03] wednesday nights to sit at your table
[44:06] lord knowing that as we come together
[44:08] that we'll be feasting on eternal things
[44:11] that we do not come in a way of lifting
[44:14] up tradition or man
[44:16] that we come
[44:17] because there's something in our hearts
[44:18] drawing us
[44:19] we see the promise and the word of god
[44:21] where we're gathered there you'll be in
[44:22] our midst
[44:23] we see the time that we're living in and
[44:25] know that we ought to gather ourselves
[44:26] together even more so
[44:28] for it's in these gatherings like this
[44:30] that our faith has increased and grows
[44:33] so bless all that are here and we know
[44:34] that being a midweek maybe school has
[44:36] started back for some families maybe
[44:38] there's just the demands of a thursday
[44:40] morning that are looming but we pray
[44:42] that in the lateness of the day and the
[44:44] time that we have together you can make
[44:45] the most of it as we look solely to you
[44:48] to come and speak to us we ask this in
[44:50] the name of lord jesus christ amen
[44:53] and you can be seated
[44:54] my title tonight is supreme faith
[44:58] supreme faith and
[45:00] i'd like to use a
[45:02] a statement at the very beginning to
[45:04] kind of get us thinking in the right in
[45:06] the same channel
[45:07] brother branham when he's speaking uh
[45:09] the sermon balm and gilead in 1959
[45:13] he says one thing that we have to move
[45:15] up to now is a supreme faith to what we
[45:18] have had
[45:20] and that that statement we can connect
[45:22] with rapturing faith a perfect faith and
[45:24] we know he teaches us that we have to
[45:26] have more faith than there was in any
[45:28] age and i think that's part of what his
[45:30] burden was if not the exact vision that
[45:32] he had when he makes this statement he
[45:34] says the one thing we have to move up to
[45:36] now is a supreme faith to what we have
[45:38] had
[45:39] and he says you cannot have that faith
[45:42] until you know perfectly what you're
[45:43] doing so you can't have supreme faith
[45:46] until you know perfectly what you're
[45:47] doing and then all of us feel like we
[45:49] should quit now because there's probably
[45:51] nothing we've ever done that we could
[45:52] say we knew perfectly what we were doing
[45:54] if we were being honest with ourselves
[45:56] so it's supreme faith is quite a high
[45:58] bar but notice what he says you just say
[46:01] well i'm going home i'm going to go out
[46:03] and start the car that's all an act of
[46:05] faith tomorrow i'll meet you at a
[46:07] certain place that's all an act of faith
[46:10] because you've just done it so much
[46:11] because it's a regular routine with you
[46:14] well that's the way things of god are
[46:17] so we think of supreme faith that we've
[46:19] got to move up to a supreme faith in
[46:21] what we have had we start feeling this
[46:23] pressure i got to know perfectly what
[46:24] i'm doing i got to figure it all out
[46:26] i've got to have all these things in
[46:27] place but brother brahma's just telling
[46:29] us how that we get there and he uses
[46:31] just the common example of saying well
[46:32] i'm going to go home tonight so i'm
[46:34] going to start my car and go home i'm
[46:36] going to go meet you at a certain place
[46:37] he says those are acts of faith
[46:39] and he says you've just done it so much
[46:41] towards a regular routine so he says
[46:43] that's the way the things of god are
[46:45] after you have trusted him
[46:47] and watched him do so many things till
[46:49] it becomes just like a regular routine
[46:52] so it's all it's it's in watching him
[46:54] that supreme faith has developed it's in
[46:56] keeping your eyes on the word of god and
[46:58] he says and that's the condition i think
[47:00] the church will be in before the coming
[47:02] of the lord so the rapture will just go
[47:04] right on that way
[47:06] it'll be it'll just be a regular routine
[47:09] of following the scriptures and the
[47:11] plans of god amen isn't that amazing to
[47:14] think that the rapture the change of our
[47:15] body is going to be in the regular
[47:17] routine of following the scriptures
[47:19] and the plans of god
[47:22] and so as our title is supreme faith we
[47:24] can get in our minds while that's an
[47:26] unattainable unreachable faith but keep
[47:28] that in mind that to come to the supreme
[47:30] faith brother braham said it's just
[47:31] going to be the regular routine of
[47:34] following the plans of god following the
[47:36] scriptures to where you see him meet his
[47:38] promises so many times that our faith
[47:41] just continues to grow and continues to
[47:43] grow
[47:44] and i want to draw out of the example of
[47:47] abraham this example of supreme faith
[47:49] because i believe it's supreme faith
[47:50] that was revealed in abraham
[47:53] and you forgive me if i don't know what
[47:54] to do with all this space
[47:56] here at sin of the light this brother
[47:58] aaron gary might finally be loosed i
[48:00] hardly ever move a foot when i preach
[48:02] but with all this space i feel like i
[48:03] need to use it
[48:05] and i was telling brother john on my
[48:07] when i pulled in i said how many people
[48:08] are here tonight he goes i don't know
[48:10] and i said i've just never seen that
[48:11] many cars in the parking lot that
[48:13] weren't for sale
[48:15] and so
[48:16] i i like these people are here for
[48:18] church this is wonderful and so it's
[48:20] great to see everyone here
[48:22] i want to draw out of abraham's life
[48:23] this example of supreme faith because
[48:25] it's supreme faith that's revealed in
[48:27] abraham's life
[48:28] and we use the phrase rapturing faith
[48:30] we've all heard that
[48:31] and we know rapture and faith is what
[48:33] lays in this word it's what's coming to
[48:34] us that quickening power at the opening
[48:36] of the seals uh it's a perfect faith
[48:38] that we have to come into in this hour
[48:41] uh to change our bodies to be changed in
[48:43] a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[48:45] and when we speak of faith in that
[48:47] manner and brother braham says you'd
[48:48] hardly have enough faith for your a
[48:50] headache and you've got to have faith to
[48:52] change your body we can begin to feel as
[48:53] if uh it's out it's it's not something
[48:56] that we have let alone something we're
[48:57] ever going to get to so it can feel very
[48:59] out of reach
[49:00] uh maybe in some ways it seems
[49:01] unrealistic you might even feel that way
[49:03] just about general faith and just the
[49:05] faith uh for the daily needs
[49:07] and we make it very mysterious uh
[49:10] rapturing faith seems very mysterious
[49:12] it's a perfect faith seems very
[49:13] unattainable
[49:15] but in the as we look at the example of
[49:17] abraham i want it to become more
[49:19] practical
[49:20] i'd like for it to seem to be more
[49:22] reachable abraham and we're just going
[49:24] to jump into the life of abraham drawn a
[49:26] lot from romans there and james and
[49:28] we'll just pick up these scriptures but
[49:30] abraham is called our father abraham
[49:32] jesus refers to him as our father
[49:33] abraham he's called the father of faith
[49:36] he's the great patriarch so when we
[49:38] begin to think about even the christian
[49:39] faith and we think about the father of
[49:42] faith we think of one man abraham and
[49:44] there are over 400 billion followers of
[49:47] abraham in the world today
[49:49] he has a birth three different religions
[49:51] judaism christianity and islam
[49:54] nearly 60 of the whole world or
[49:56] abrahamic religions that's a lot of
[49:58] people one man
[49:59] has
[50:00] over 4 billion followers
[50:02] that look to him as the father of their
[50:04] faith and the one that began
[50:06] their religion
[50:08] and abraham's faith i think we could all
[50:10] agree is a legendary faith if we were to
[50:12] say nama name a character of faith and
[50:14] tell us someone who is faithful you'd
[50:15] have to start with abraham because he is
[50:18] the father of faith he's the epitome of
[50:20] faith and it's a legendary faith
[50:22] and and when we look at his faith and
[50:24] how the bible speaks of it even the
[50:26] different scriptures we've read already
[50:28] we see that his faith was unwavering
[50:30] called those things that were not as
[50:32] though they were
[50:33] and who against hope believed in hope
[50:35] and when everything was said against him
[50:37] i mean still persevered and when we look
[50:40] at him we can applaud his faith and we
[50:42] can honor his faith and lift up his
[50:45] faith and maybe perhaps we think that
[50:46] his faith is unreachable
[50:49] but i want it to become more realistic
[50:51] for us
[50:52] james chapter 2 verses 20 to 22. just
[50:55] read this portion it says but will thou
[50:57] all wilt thou know o vain man that
[50:59] without faith without works uh that
[51:02] faith without works is dead
[51:04] was not abraham our father justified by
[51:06] works when he had offered isaac his son
[51:09] upon the altar since thou how faith
[51:12] wrought with his works
[51:13] and by works was faith made perfect that
[51:16] was a real beautiful thought maybe
[51:18] if the lord would lead we could amplify
[51:19] this more on sunday but
[51:22] james is saying that abraham's faith was
[51:24] made perfect reached its full and
[51:26] supreme expression so this was supreme
[51:29] faith it reached its fullness and and
[51:31] was complete when he offered isaac his
[51:34] son upon the altar
[51:35] and i think it's a very peculiar word if
[51:38] you read this to anybody who wasn't
[51:39] familiar with the scripture that you
[51:40] know i know this guy whose faith was
[51:42] manifested perfectly when he was willing
[51:43] to sacrifice his only son i might seem a
[51:46] little bit odd but this is where
[51:47] abraham's faith reaches its supreme
[51:50] expression when he offered up isaac his
[51:52] son upon the altar and it's something to
[51:54] think about why is that why was that
[51:57] supreme faith why was that the full
[51:59] expression of his faith but it was
[52:01] through this this instance and this
[52:03] moment in abraham's life didn't happen
[52:05] at the beginning
[52:06] it's happening at a critical juncture at
[52:08] a time in which god had fulfilled his
[52:10] promises and and kept his his word to
[52:13] abraham and it was something he did out
[52:15] of faith and the word of god is saying
[52:17] that's when abraham's faith was made
[52:19] perfect when he offered up isaac his son
[52:22] and just a few statements very brief
[52:25] statements
[52:26] from the message just so you can kind of
[52:28] pick up where
[52:30] see where i'm identifying abraham as
[52:31] such a great example of the supreme
[52:33] faith brother branham says abraham was
[52:35] the example
[52:36] what all he was going to do to abraham
[52:38] he was going to do to him and his seed
[52:41] so abraham is an example whatever god
[52:44] did to abraham he does to his seed he's
[52:46] going to do he did it to abraham he'll
[52:49] do it to his seed we are his seed he
[52:51] says in the message influence he was
[52:52] showing an example of what he was going
[52:54] to do in the last days so abraham's life
[52:58] gives us a foreshadowing or a type of
[53:00] what he's going to do in the last days
[53:03] he says in the sermon god is identified
[53:05] by his characteristic in one day when
[53:07] god seen that his servant was determined
[53:09] to be an example for people today
[53:13] if you go home and you read james
[53:15] chapter 2 and just begin to think about
[53:17] it and examine it and ask yourself how
[53:19] does this relate to where we are in the
[53:21] end time you begin to see how that
[53:22] abraham's life was set forth as an
[53:25] example for our faith today he was going
[53:28] to show in abraham an example of what
[53:30] god was going to do in the last days and
[53:33] what he did to abraham he does to his
[53:35] seed after him
[53:37] and even though and even in that if i
[53:40] could say this i think it already begins
[53:41] to
[53:42] emphasize this point that abraham is not
[53:45] set before us as an idol
[53:48] but he's set before us as an example
[53:51] i don't we don't worship him and we're
[53:52] not idolizing his faith but god wants
[53:55] his faith to become practical to us
[53:57] because he's to be an example to us in
[53:59] the last days he was an example for
[54:01] people today what god did to abraham
[54:03] he's going to do to you so then
[54:04] abraham's life is not something that we
[54:07] venerate in honor but something that we
[54:09] recognize is for us
[54:11] because abraham's faith was simple
[54:14] and it was practical
[54:16] to where it it actually came to a place
[54:18] where it was so simple and practical but
[54:20] it matured to supreme
[54:22] it matured to
[54:24] uh uh to grow into the supernatural
[54:26] works that we see in his life
[54:28] and in hebrews chapter 12 verse two this
[54:30] is speaking of us we look unto jesus the
[54:33] author and finisher of our faith
[54:36] so christ is the leader the originator
[54:38] of our faith but he is also the original
[54:41] or the perfecter the finisher of our
[54:43] faith
[54:44] and if we could even just bring this
[54:45] into our view tonight faith has an
[54:47] origin and faith has a destiny amen
[54:50] if we if we recognize that our faith had
[54:52] a beginning in our lives i began to
[54:54] believe and this is when i became a
[54:56] christian and this when the word of god
[54:57] began to open up to me and we can
[54:59] generally point back uh to a time
[55:02] especially people who are here on a
[55:03] wednesday night there's something real
[55:05] that's happened we have a saying at our
[55:07] church uh there and i was i meant to
[55:08] bring greetings from the church there in
[55:10] phoenix arizona believers church forgot
[55:12] to do it you can show just how good i am
[55:14] at this but greetings from all the
[55:16] believers there in phoenix at arizona
[55:17] believer's church but we have a saying
[55:19] that if you go to church on sunday
[55:20] morning
[55:21] you love church if you go to church on
[55:23] sunday evening you love your pastor and
[55:25] that's why we don't have an evening
[55:26] service at our church
[55:28] and then if you go if you go on
[55:30] wednesday nights you love the word so i
[55:32] know you're here because you love the
[55:33] word
[55:34] and and you can those of you who are in
[55:36] love with the word you can look back and
[55:37] identify the time when that began to be
[55:40] awakened inside of you my faith has a
[55:42] beginning but don't ever forget it has a
[55:43] destiny
[55:45] your faith has an origin and it also has
[55:47] a destiny and if you leave the destiny
[55:49] side out we're always looking back it's
[55:50] easy to get discouraged but christ is
[55:53] not only the author or the originator of
[55:55] our faith but he is the perfecter of our
[55:57] faith so what he started he will finish
[56:02] and so let's look at the genesis of
[56:04] abraham's faith so we can catch this
[56:06] example of our faith has an origin it
[56:08] also has a destiny and we want to
[56:10] recognize this in abraham's life because
[56:12] paul writes in first corinthians 15 19
[56:14] if in this life only we have hope in
[56:16] christ we are of all men most miserable
[56:20] now that's that's a scripture to think
[56:21] about for a while
[56:23] that if we in this life only have hope
[56:26] in christ then christians are the most
[56:28] miserable people in the world
[56:30] that's exactly what paul's saying that
[56:32] if your hope is only in this life then
[56:34] we of all men are most miserable and so
[56:37] the key to our
[56:39] our being the most happy people in all
[56:40] the earth isn't necessarily what's in
[56:43] this life but what is in the life to
[56:44] come because we do not just have hope in
[56:47] this life only but in the life become
[56:49] that's why we of all men are the most
[56:50] happy
[56:52] because we have a we have a life to come
[56:54] we have a hope in christ that's beyond
[56:56] time beyond what we're living in now
[56:59] so if we look at the genesis of
[57:00] abraham's faith let's look at hebrews
[57:02] chapter 11.
[57:03] i think i just have a few verses here to
[57:05] read
[57:07] and it describes abraham this way it
[57:09] says by faith abraham when he was called
[57:11] to go out into a place
[57:13] which he should after receive for
[57:14] inheritance obeyed
[57:17] and he went out not knowing whether he
[57:20] went now i'm reading some of these
[57:21] things his background before we actually
[57:23] read in genesis about the life of
[57:25] abraham but i want you to catch how
[57:28] how much it's amplified by the writers
[57:30] in the new testament it says by faith
[57:32] when he was called to go out into a
[57:33] place which he should after receive for
[57:35] inheritance obeyed and he didn't know
[57:38] where he was going
[57:40] god asked him to begin to journey
[57:42] without telling him the ultimate
[57:43] destination he says by faith he soldier
[57:46] and he continued he he lived in the land
[57:49] of promise as in a strange country so
[57:51] it's promised to him but he's a stranger
[57:53] it's his but he's a foreigner by faith
[57:55] he soldiered in the land of promises in
[57:57] a strange country dwelling in
[57:59] tabernacles with isaac and jacob the
[58:01] heirs with him of the same promise for
[58:03] he looked for a city which hath
[58:05] foundations whose builder and maker is
[58:07] god
[58:08] abraham though he lived in the land of
[58:10] promise as a foreigner was looking for
[58:12] an ultimate destination that was
[58:14] permanent a city that had foundations
[58:17] not just pitching these temporary tents
[58:19] and these temporary dwellings and always
[58:21] being able to wrap up and move on
[58:23] eventually he wanted a place that had
[58:25] foundation an eternal home an eternal
[58:27] city whose builder and maker is god amen
[58:31] and in romans chapter 4 verse 12 we
[58:33] believe we already read it he says and
[58:34] the father of circumcision to them who
[58:37] are not of the circumcision only but who
[58:39] also walk in the steps of that faith of
[58:42] our father abraham which he had being
[58:45] yet uncircumcised so there's that puts
[58:47] us in the pattern of abraham that he is
[58:50] the father of us all and we are to walk
[58:52] in the steps of that faith of our father
[58:55] abraham if he has a legendary faith if
[58:58] he had a perfect faith if he had a faith
[58:59] it's hard to understand your calling is
[59:01] still yet his walk in the very same
[59:04] steps of that faith of our father
[59:06] abraham so this is what you want to
[59:08] claim tonight and just believe you
[59:10] possess that faith
[59:11] that's the takeaway from this scripture
[59:13] that we walk in the steps of that faith
[59:15] of our father abraham though it may seem
[59:17] to be legendary by this scripture i
[59:19] believe that we possess the same faith
[59:22] of abraham
[59:24] and then he says we walk in the steps of
[59:25] that faith and we are to perform the
[59:27] same exercise
[59:29] of that faith
[59:30] abraham's what we'll call we'd call the
[59:32] parent believer he's the father of our
[59:34] faith he's the parent believer he's the
[59:36] model of justification by faith uh and
[59:39] we are walking after his type he is the
[59:42] parent believers he is the type that we
[59:44] are following in he's the first example
[59:47] of this faith
[59:49] says in isaiah chapter 51 verses 1 and 2
[59:51] hearken to me
[59:53] ye that follow after righteousness ye
[59:55] that seek the lord look into the rock
[59:57] once you're hewn into the hole of the
[59:59] pit which you are digged
[1:00:01] look under abraham your father
[1:00:03] and unto sarah that bear you
[1:00:05] for i have called him alone and blessed
[1:00:07] him and increased
[1:00:10] really abraham was that rock they were
[1:00:11] hewn from it says i called him alone and
[1:00:14] blessed him and increased him and so you
[1:00:16] that follow after righteousness and seek
[1:00:18] me look at what i have brought you out
[1:00:20] of from look at the pit from which you
[1:00:22] were digged abraham is your consider
[1:00:25] abraham your father look to him look at
[1:00:27] him as the example of how i called him
[1:00:29] alone and blessed him and increased him
[1:00:32] telling israel he's your example you are
[1:00:34] hewn from him he's your example even in
[1:00:36] new testament he is our example of faith
[1:00:40] brother branham in the sermon possessed
[1:00:41] in the gate of the enemy after trial and
[1:00:42] the patriarch was faithful to call to
[1:00:45] his call and the promised word he was an
[1:00:48] example to what we
[1:00:50] should be
[1:00:52] abraham
[1:00:53] was an example to what we should be
[1:00:57] so there in hebrews it says he was
[1:00:58] called to go out into a place which he
[1:00:59] should after
[1:01:01] receive
[1:01:02] abraham's faith begin this is where i
[1:01:04] want you to start identifying with
[1:01:06] abraham's faith begin when god called
[1:01:08] him
[1:01:09] when he was called to go out into a
[1:01:10] place that says he obeyed abraham's
[1:01:12] faith began when god called him and this
[1:01:14] is the basis for all true faith
[1:01:17] it's that faith cometh by hearing and
[1:01:19] hearing by the word of the lord that
[1:01:21] it's got to be our faith is birthed by
[1:01:23] god calling it to us and speaking to us
[1:01:26] and if we start there at this very
[1:01:28] moment if we can say look at this i'm
[1:01:30] going to go through this in greater
[1:01:31] detail that abraham as the bible says he
[1:01:34] called him alone and blessed him and
[1:01:36] increased him he says look at the pit
[1:01:37] that you've been dug out of the rock
[1:01:39] that you've been hewn out of abraham's
[1:01:41] faith began when god called him and that
[1:01:43] should start to make abraham's faith a
[1:01:46] little bit more relatable
[1:01:49] genesis chapter 12 and that will just if
[1:01:51] you could keep your bible close to you
[1:01:53] we'll probably just walk through a
[1:01:54] number of scriptures in in genesis a few
[1:01:56] of them at least
[1:01:58] and so this is where abraham's faith
[1:02:00] began by faith abraham when he was
[1:02:02] called to go into a place that he should
[1:02:03] after receive for a promise says he
[1:02:05] obeyed
[1:02:06] and here's where we begin to see the
[1:02:08] life of abraham in genesis chapter 12
[1:02:11] verse 1 now the lord had said unto abram
[1:02:15] get thee out of thy country
[1:02:17] and from thy kindred and from thy
[1:02:19] father's house unto a land that i will
[1:02:22] show thee
[1:02:24] this the way that the scripture
[1:02:27] describes it
[1:02:28] is it's telling us that god had already
[1:02:30] spoke to him
[1:02:31] the lord had said unto abram get thee
[1:02:34] out of thy country and from thy kindred
[1:02:36] and from thy father's house so there was
[1:02:39] things that he had to do he had to get
[1:02:40] out of his country he had to get away
[1:02:42] from the kindred and ultimately he had
[1:02:44] to separate from his father's house and
[1:02:46] he says unto a land that i will show
[1:02:48] thee
[1:02:49] and hebrews told us that he left uh not
[1:02:51] knowing where he was going and that god
[1:02:53] would just show him later
[1:02:56] he's go there i read these statements
[1:02:58] in a couple places and i thought they
[1:02:59] were just so tremendous it said god did
[1:03:01] not immediately make known the land to
[1:03:03] him
[1:03:04] so that it might be lovely
[1:03:06] in his eyes
[1:03:08] he didn't show him where he was going he
[1:03:09] wanted he wanted it just to he wanted to
[1:03:11] bring him to it for him to see it he
[1:03:14] says he knew not where he was as a man
[1:03:16] that was in the dark
[1:03:18] so he says abraham get up and all he
[1:03:19] knew is he had to leave his homeland he
[1:03:21] had to leave his kindred and ultimately
[1:03:23] he knew he had to leave his family and
[1:03:25] so the bible says in genesis chapter 11
[1:03:27] verses 27 and 28 it says now these are
[1:03:29] the generations of terror terror begat
[1:03:32] abram nehor and haran and haran begat
[1:03:34] lot and heron died before his father
[1:03:37] tara in the land of his nativity in ur
[1:03:40] of the chaldees
[1:03:41] this is where abraham has come comes
[1:03:43] from it says get the out of thy country
[1:03:45] he's coming out of the land of ur of the
[1:03:47] chaldees he is kind of describing his
[1:03:50] family tara
[1:03:51] uh is his father nehor haran are his
[1:03:54] brothers and then it mentions his his
[1:03:56] nephew lord who came from his brother
[1:03:58] haran says here they are in chaldea in
[1:04:01] in ur in the land of the counties and
[1:04:03] this
[1:04:04] signifies to us they're in babylon
[1:04:07] and there in babylon are all are idol
[1:04:09] worshipers
[1:04:11] i think that's something maybe we don't
[1:04:12] think about very often abraham was a
[1:04:13] gentile he was an idol worshiper it was
[1:04:15] just among the nations uh you didn't
[1:04:17] have hebrews then you didn't have the
[1:04:19] jews you didn't have a a religion you
[1:04:21] just had idol worshipers and there was
[1:04:24] and they'd made idols out of the things
[1:04:25] that they could see
[1:04:27] they worshiped the sun they saw the sun
[1:04:28] and they worshipped it they worshipped
[1:04:30] the moon because they saw the moon there
[1:04:31] were certain things and elements in
[1:04:32] nature that they worshipped and if they
[1:04:34] had a god they fashioned an image like
[1:04:36] unto it and they worshipped that image
[1:04:38] and you'd find these images were strewn
[1:04:40] throughout babylonia and there's even
[1:04:42] along the trade routes there was large
[1:04:44] altars that were erected as tributes to
[1:04:46] false deities and it's just it's really
[1:04:49] a logical conclusion that abraham and
[1:04:51] his family were all idol worshipers
[1:04:54] there's some that dispute that but the
[1:04:55] bible says in joshua 24 2 that tara the
[1:04:58] father of abraham and the father nehor
[1:05:01] and they served other gods
[1:05:03] that's what the bible says in joshua 24
[1:05:06] that they served other gods
[1:05:08] so when abraham is called he's not
[1:05:10] called out of a christian family he's
[1:05:12] not called from job's family believing
[1:05:14] in god he's not called from a great
[1:05:16] lineages of parents and grandparents who
[1:05:19] believed in the one true god but abraham
[1:05:21] is called out of idolatry
[1:05:23] called out of unbelief he's called out
[1:05:25] of just worshiping things that they knew
[1:05:26] that had power they had substance and
[1:05:28] they there was something maybe tangible
[1:05:30] to the things that they tried to worship
[1:05:32] but there was nothing remotely akin to
[1:05:34] faith
[1:05:36] and this is abraham's condition
[1:05:38] when god calls him out of
[1:05:40] er of the counties
[1:05:42] it says in genesis chapter 15 verse 7
[1:05:45] and this is the lord now describing how
[1:05:47] he brought abraham out and he said unto
[1:05:49] him i am the lord that brought thee out
[1:05:51] of ur of the counties to give thee this
[1:05:53] land
[1:05:54] to inherit amen so god had called him
[1:05:58] out of the land even though he didn't
[1:05:59] know where he was going
[1:06:01] and he brings them to this place to give
[1:06:03] you this land for an inheritance this is
[1:06:05] why we call it the promised land because
[1:06:07] this is the land that god had promised
[1:06:08] abraham
[1:06:10] and it really is a future promise
[1:06:12] and so he could think of this his origin
[1:06:15] when god calls him there in ur in the
[1:06:16] land of the counties but then god brings
[1:06:19] into a place says this is the land i'm
[1:06:20] going to give you and now he's showing
[1:06:22] him destiny
[1:06:24] in nehemiah chapter 9 verse 7 it says
[1:06:26] thou art the lord the god who did us
[1:06:28] choose abraham
[1:06:30] and brought us him forth out of ur of
[1:06:32] the chaldees and gave us him the name of
[1:06:35] abraham so it's god that chose abraham
[1:06:38] chose him there in the in the in the
[1:06:40] land of the chaldees and ur the counties
[1:06:42] among idol worshipers with family that
[1:06:44] are idol worshipers it's god that chose
[1:06:46] them and brought him out of earth the
[1:06:49] chaldees and changes his name and gave
[1:06:51] him this land of promise
[1:06:54] just picking up several scriptures that
[1:06:56] tell the story
[1:06:57] and in acts chapter 7 verses 2 to 4.
[1:07:03] he said men and brother and fathers
[1:07:05] hearken
[1:07:07] the god of glory appeared unto our
[1:07:08] father abraham
[1:07:10] when he was in mesopotamia
[1:07:12] before he dwelt in quran
[1:07:14] and said unto him get thee out of thy
[1:07:16] country and from thy kindred and come
[1:07:18] into the land which i shall show thee
[1:07:21] then came he out of the land of the
[1:07:22] chaldeans and dwelt in heroin and from
[1:07:25] thence when his father was dead he
[1:07:26] removed him into this land wherein you
[1:07:29] now dwell these scriptures are just
[1:07:31] telling abraham's journey he starts in
[1:07:33] ur and he travels out and we know the uh
[1:07:35] i believe most of us are familiar that
[1:07:37] he gets as far as quran and there he
[1:07:39] lives with his father he's there with
[1:07:41] his with his family his extended family
[1:07:43] he's in his father's house and there he
[1:07:45] is dwelling together with his father and
[1:07:48] with his family
[1:07:49] and the bible says that even from then
[1:07:51] he had to get out of that when his
[1:07:53] father was dead he came down and lived
[1:07:56] in the land of promise this is the
[1:07:58] journey of abraham out of earth in the
[1:08:00] koran down into the promised land
[1:08:04] and so in genesis chapter 11
[1:08:09] let's start with verse 29 i i don't know
[1:08:11] if i read i maybe read a couple of these
[1:08:12] already but
[1:08:14] this is just background in genesis
[1:08:16] chapter 12.
[1:08:24] i hope it's not uh jumping around or
[1:08:26] confusing for you i know it's just real
[1:08:27] simple
[1:08:28] wanting to get some of these uh
[1:08:30] scriptures out before you to consider
[1:08:32] genesis chapter 11
[1:08:34] verses 29 to 32 it says
[1:08:36] abram and nehor took them wives
[1:08:39] the name of abram's wife was sarah and
[1:08:41] the name of nehor's wife was milka the
[1:08:43] daughter of haran the father of milka
[1:08:45] and the father of iska
[1:08:47] but sarah was barren she had no child
[1:08:51] this is should help us to understand and
[1:08:53] relate that abraham's situation was one
[1:08:56] and which those around them are being
[1:08:58] blessed they're having children but
[1:08:59] abraham and his wife are unable to have
[1:09:01] children and it's kind of striking that
[1:09:03] it's put in this
[1:09:05] that sarah was barren and she had no
[1:09:06] child
[1:09:08] it says and tara took abraham his son
[1:09:11] took abram his son
[1:09:12] and lot the son of haran his son's son
[1:09:15] and sarah his daughter-in-law his son
[1:09:17] abram's wife and they went forth with
[1:09:19] them from ur the chaldees to go into the
[1:09:22] land of canaan and they came unto her on
[1:09:24] and dwelt there and the days of terror
[1:09:26] were 205 years and terah died in haran
[1:09:30] now what stands out to you as being a
[1:09:32] little bit different
[1:09:33] in this reading than what we read in
[1:09:35] nehemiah in acts chapter 7
[1:09:37] genesis chapter 15 and these other
[1:09:40] places that we've already read even in
[1:09:41] isaiah 51
[1:09:43] here as we read it in genesis chapter
[1:09:44] 11. this is the background to verse to
[1:09:47] genesis chapter 12.
[1:09:49] genesis chapter 12 says now the lord had
[1:09:51] said unto abram this is why
[1:09:53] you find what takes place in verses 29
[1:09:56] to 32 of chapter 11 because god has
[1:09:58] spoken to abraham
[1:10:00] god spoke to abraham to get up and leave
[1:10:02] er the chaldees and what happens the
[1:10:04] whole family is going
[1:10:06] and so abraham and his and his brother
[1:10:08] they take wives and they and his brother
[1:10:10] has children and it says tara took abram
[1:10:13] and his and his and his grandson and
[1:10:15] although it was god that spoke to
[1:10:17] abraham tara as the father is honored as
[1:10:20] the leader but the bible wants us to
[1:10:22] know they laughed because god had said
[1:10:25] unto abraham
[1:10:27] god spoke unto abraham that's that's why
[1:10:30] they're leaving and we might find this
[1:10:32] true in our lives there's times when god
[1:10:33] speaks to us there might be a lot of
[1:10:35] other people that are moving along with
[1:10:36] us but it's faith when you know that god
[1:10:38] has spoken to you if you can be walking
[1:10:41] in the pattern of abraham it's not
[1:10:42] enough that everyone kind of gets the
[1:10:43] idea and we all go along with it but god
[1:10:46] has to have spoken directly to you
[1:10:49] so it's at the at the end of chapter 11
[1:10:52] it ends with them being halfway between
[1:10:54] ur and canaan
[1:10:57] they're in that place in acts where it's
[1:10:59] called quran or in the in the genesis
[1:11:01] heron this is where they are they're
[1:11:03] halfway between ur
[1:11:06] and the promised land
[1:11:07] halfway in the journey
[1:11:09] and as abraham is halfway in the journey
[1:11:12] he's there he's left but he's not all
[1:11:14] the way
[1:11:15] and it's then that the bible says the
[1:11:17] lord hath said unto abram get thee out
[1:11:20] of that country and from thy kindred
[1:11:22] from thy father's house unto a land that
[1:11:24] i will show thee and in verse 2 it says
[1:11:27] and i will make of thee a great nation
[1:11:29] and i will bless thee and i will make
[1:11:32] thy name great and thou shalt be a
[1:11:34] blessing and i will bless them that
[1:11:36] bless thee and curse them that curseth
[1:11:38] thee and in these shall all families of
[1:11:41] the earth be blessed
[1:11:46] i think it's become common to us because
[1:11:48] the nation of israel is so pronounced so
[1:11:50] established we call them israelites they
[1:11:52] call them the seed of abraham we know
[1:11:55] their promised land all the even the
[1:11:56] physical condition the physical promises
[1:11:58] but god is saying that from one man
[1:12:01] abraham i will make of thee a great
[1:12:03] nation
[1:12:04] and i will make thy name great and all
[1:12:06] and all in thee shall all families of
[1:12:08] the earth be blessed
[1:12:10] see there's going to be a nation whose
[1:12:12] origin
[1:12:13] is faith in one god
[1:12:16] i'm going to call you there's going to
[1:12:17] be a people who can trace their origin
[1:12:19] back to being called from this one true
[1:12:22] god
[1:12:23] and in genesis chapter 14 verse 13
[1:12:26] i don't know if you've this is something
[1:12:28] that's really easy to miss we know we
[1:12:30] call them hebrew children the hebrews
[1:12:33] but this is where the name comes from
[1:12:36] genesis chapter 14 verse 13 and there
[1:12:38] came one that had escaped and telling
[1:12:40] the story of lots capture and told abram
[1:12:43] the hebrew
[1:12:45] this is what others called abram
[1:12:48] abram wasn't one that necessarily called
[1:12:50] himself a hebrew but when he had come
[1:12:52] and traveled into the promised land they
[1:12:54] looked at abraham and they called him a
[1:12:56] hebrew which means one who's crossed
[1:12:58] over
[1:13:00] one from beyond so when abraham traveled
[1:13:02] down out of ur down through haran and
[1:13:05] came down to the promised land he was
[1:13:06] one that they looked at had crossed over
[1:13:09] he had come down into their land he was
[1:13:10] one that was traveling
[1:13:12] and so when we call when abraham is
[1:13:14] called to hebrew it was because he was
[1:13:16] one that was he was a foreigner he was
[1:13:18] one that kind of crossed over and he was
[1:13:20] one from beyond and i believe that
[1:13:22] little did they know they were
[1:13:23] attributing to abraham something that
[1:13:25] had a deeper meaning because he was one
[1:13:27] from beyond
[1:13:28] he was one that had crossed over from a
[1:13:30] life of just natural things and natural
[1:13:32] senses into a life of faith and
[1:13:34] therefore to be a hebrew is not to have
[1:13:36] your origin in natural things but to
[1:13:39] really understand that you come from
[1:13:41] something eternal and you're going to go
[1:13:43] back to something eternal
[1:13:45] abram was a hebrew because he had
[1:13:47] crossed over and had traveled down into
[1:13:49] this promised land with a promise that
[1:13:51] god would make him a great nation he
[1:13:53] would make his name great and in abraham
[1:13:56] all families of the earth would be
[1:13:57] blessed
[1:13:59] it says in galatians 3 29 if you be
[1:14:01] christ then are ye abraham's seed
[1:14:03] and heirs according to the promise
[1:14:07] you're abraham's seed
[1:14:08] the seed is the one the thing that
[1:14:10] contains the german
[1:14:11] the one that has the dna that determines
[1:14:13] the development
[1:14:15] and so it's important for us to
[1:14:16] recognize our dna when we look at
[1:14:17] abraham we're looking at we're looking
[1:14:19] at our dna
[1:14:21] we're looking at our ancestry there's
[1:14:22] people that don't know maybe who their
[1:14:24] father is or their mother or they have
[1:14:26] certain uh
[1:14:27] certain things come up and they want to
[1:14:28] start looking at family history we go to
[1:14:30] the doctor for checkup they ask you
[1:14:31] questions about your family history why
[1:14:33] because it's relevant amen certain
[1:14:36] things exist in your family then they
[1:14:38] expect them to show up in your life and
[1:14:40] they want to know certain things about
[1:14:41] you the health of your mom the health of
[1:14:42] your dad how far back does it go because
[1:14:45] it's kind of projecting what your
[1:14:47] physical makeup is like and the same
[1:14:49] thing for us as the seed of abraham you
[1:14:52] are abraham's seed and heirs according
[1:14:54] to the promise he holds for us the
[1:14:56] phenotype or the example of what we are
[1:14:58] to become
[1:15:00] his faith is very relatable he was
[1:15:02] called out of unbelief called out as an
[1:15:05] idol worshipper when he called out all
[1:15:06] he was he was just following god didn't
[1:15:08] know where he was going is that not how
[1:15:10] it is for all of us we've only responded
[1:15:13] to a call of god we're not quite sure
[1:15:15] where this is going to
[1:15:16] cause us to end up but we only know to
[1:15:18] follow god
[1:15:22] well john would have you ever imagined
[1:15:24] that this is where you'd be having
[1:15:26] church 21 years later you passed by this
[1:15:28] building dozen times a day
[1:15:31] a municipal building a government
[1:15:33] building used for other purposes and all
[1:15:35] you know to do is just put one foot
[1:15:37] where god's telling you to step and he
[1:15:39] doesn't tell you the end it's a good
[1:15:40] thing because you probably would have
[1:15:41] tried to buy it then
[1:15:44] or just show everybody out this is mine
[1:15:46] god showed me this is mine but there's a
[1:15:48] certain way that god wants us to grow
[1:15:49] and to mature in our faith being created
[1:15:51] to be able to possess
[1:15:52] our inheritance and possess the things
[1:15:54] he wants to give us and so abraham is
[1:15:57] our example we need to look into and
[1:16:00] you'll just maybe you could do it on
[1:16:02] your own in your own study is begin to
[1:16:04] recognize family characteristics
[1:16:06] that you have as a believer in the life
[1:16:08] of abraham amen amen
[1:16:11] special characteristics of this nation
[1:16:12] that god said would exist
[1:16:15] brother branham and the sermon faith
[1:16:17] says now we're speaking tonight upon
[1:16:18] faith
[1:16:19] i thought it would be nice maybe we
[1:16:20] could use this great character of
[1:16:22] abraham for an example of faith
[1:16:25] because it was to abraham the promise
[1:16:27] was given
[1:16:28] and we'll kind of review the life of
[1:16:30] abraham just a little a little
[1:16:33] because he was
[1:16:34] an outstanding character
[1:16:37] he was a man who believed god
[1:16:40] and now he had no great background to
[1:16:41] believe god because it's commonly
[1:16:43] believed that he was from a family of
[1:16:44] idolaters he gained town from babylon
[1:16:48] his family dwelt in their land of
[1:16:49] chaldea the city of earth the valleys of
[1:16:51] shinar and was just an ordinary man
[1:16:55] he wasn't an angel
[1:16:57] he was just a man like you
[1:17:00] and
[1:17:00] i abraham was just a man
[1:17:04] like you and i he says nothing
[1:17:06] that that not an angel
[1:17:08] comes from a family of idolaters
[1:17:11] he was just a man like you and i
[1:17:13] it says in the sermon jehovah jair he
[1:17:15] says abraham was just an ordinary man
[1:17:17] he wasn't any different from any of us
[1:17:19] just the same
[1:17:21] people today when they see god put a
[1:17:22] gift in the church some people tries to
[1:17:24] stand that person up as some great big
[1:17:26] outstanding something well that's wrong
[1:17:28] you got your mind on the person then
[1:17:30] instead of on christ
[1:17:32] we're all just the same
[1:17:34] the bible said that elijah was a man
[1:17:36] subject to like passions as we are he
[1:17:38] just had the same ups and downs that we
[1:17:41] have
[1:17:42] now my people formerly are catholic you
[1:17:44] all know that and they're great on holy
[1:17:46] man holy man but to me it's not a holy
[1:17:48] man it's a holy god
[1:17:50] that's right it's god is the object
[1:17:52] we're men
[1:17:53] all the same
[1:17:55] it says notice but abraham was just an
[1:17:58] ordinary man
[1:17:59] came down from babylon
[1:18:01] and he dwelt there in the land of shinar
[1:18:04] this is where
[1:18:06] i i like how brother branham can just do
[1:18:08] this in the way of telling a story and
[1:18:09] perhaps his diet was go in of a morning
[1:18:12] and pick some berries from the bushes
[1:18:14] go back out and kill an animal and have
[1:18:16] his noonday meal and some more berries
[1:18:18] for supper and so forth so i'm not quite
[1:18:20] sure does it sound like intermittent
[1:18:22] fasting doesn't sound like keto or the
[1:18:24] carnivore diet maybe a combination
[1:18:26] of that maybe just the right kind of
[1:18:28] corn carnivore diet because you're just
[1:18:30] eating the whole natural fruits
[1:18:32] and avoiding all the processed things so
[1:18:34] there's an abraham diet i'm sure that we
[1:18:35] can gather from this quote
[1:18:37] sure somebody will be working on it
[1:18:38] tomorrow and let us know all the details
[1:18:40] soon
[1:18:41] but abraham said just pick some berries
[1:18:43] from the bushes go out and kill some an
[1:18:45] animal for his noonday meal some berries
[1:18:47] for supper he's just showing this is
[1:18:49] just an abraham this is his ordinary
[1:18:51] life
[1:18:52] we think of abraham as this great great
[1:18:54] legendary faith and we think that
[1:18:55] perhaps when he was young he was he was
[1:18:58] fasted in praying as a as a child and he
[1:19:00] had access to all sorts of materials and
[1:19:02] the way that he lived his life what was
[1:19:04] so far beyond the life that we would
[1:19:05] lead but he's just saying here that it's
[1:19:07] a very simple life he had breakfast he
[1:19:09] ate lunch and he had dinner
[1:19:11] he was married to his half-sister her
[1:19:12] name was sarah
[1:19:14] and while abraham being just an ordinary
[1:19:16] man god chose abraham by election
[1:19:21] not because he was different from any
[1:19:23] other man but it was because that god's
[1:19:26] election has to stand sure
[1:19:29] can't you see how much more easily we
[1:19:31] can identify with abraham nothing
[1:19:33] special about him we try to figure out
[1:19:34] well how can my faith be like abraham
[1:19:36] look at abraham's life look at his faith
[1:19:38] he's eating berries for breakfast
[1:19:40] see barry's for dinner
[1:19:42] he's uh he's having he's killing an
[1:19:44] animal for lunch there's nothing
[1:19:46] supernatural about his life
[1:19:48] there's nothing in his regular routine
[1:19:50] of the day that would speak out this is
[1:19:51] a man of faith this is different
[1:19:53] abraham's been set apart he wasn't the
[1:19:55] subject of conversation in his
[1:19:56] neighborhood man abraham's different
[1:19:58] abram he's a different guy man he's he's
[1:20:00] different he's going to be special no
[1:20:01] he's a berry eater like everybody else
[1:20:04] he has to hunt his food just like
[1:20:06] everybody else promise he's just an
[1:20:07] ordinary man and that god chose them not
[1:20:10] because he was different than any other
[1:20:12] man but he chose them because it was
[1:20:14] god's choice
[1:20:16] and i realized that election can be
[1:20:17] really really hard for us to get our
[1:20:19] minds around it and i read where it was
[1:20:21] attributed to luther one time and i have
[1:20:24] since not been able to find it but uh
[1:20:26] it's just one of those things where you
[1:20:27] just know that you read it and i don't
[1:20:28] know why it's that way i'm trying to
[1:20:30] remember the effect that they call it
[1:20:31] but
[1:20:32] where they said that luther said to uh
[1:20:35] you you die trying to figure out
[1:20:37] predestination or you lose your mind
[1:20:40] trying to figure out predestination but
[1:20:41] you'll lose your soul denying it
[1:20:44] and it's very very difficult to try to
[1:20:46] figure out election well how does it how
[1:20:48] does my choice fit how does this work
[1:20:50] and how does that work you just have to
[1:20:51] accept that god chose
[1:20:53] abraham was placed on the basis of free
[1:20:55] more agency yes he had the chance to
[1:20:57] choose he had the opportunity to choose
[1:20:59] but he never had a choice to be a son
[1:21:03] god didn't mention you want to be my son
[1:21:04] no god made him his son god chose him to
[1:21:07] be a son and in that way we can identify
[1:21:09] with abraham i'm no special than anybody
[1:21:11] else except that god has chosen me
[1:21:14] and it's upon this basis alone that we
[1:21:17] speak about abraham today abraham is
[1:21:19] known today simply because god revealed
[1:21:22] himself to him
[1:21:24] and i'm just going to be ending on this
[1:21:25] thought i realized that um service
[1:21:28] starting at 7 30 and then you start
[1:21:29] preaching at eight man it's late it gets
[1:21:31] really really late so i'll just be
[1:21:33] long-winded on sunday
[1:21:34] this is a warning maybe only a few
[1:21:36] people that show up that might not be
[1:21:37] very wise
[1:21:39] but do i need to take that back
[1:21:41] okay good brother mark will be here and
[1:21:42] that's all we need two we got two that's
[1:21:44] what we need got the song leader in the
[1:21:45] preacher we'll have church
[1:21:49] abraham
[1:21:51] is a legend today for one reason
[1:21:54] god revealed himself to him that's the
[1:21:56] true legacy of abraham
[1:21:59] that's the the the singular significant
[1:22:01] characteristic of abraham's life faith
[1:22:04] in god
[1:22:05] true faith faith in the one god
[1:22:08] faith in the god of creation amen
[1:22:11] and the bible says
[1:22:13] as we've been reading the lord had said
[1:22:14] unto abram get out of that country from
[1:22:16] thy kindred from thy father's house i'll
[1:22:18] make you a great nation make thy name
[1:22:19] great and thee all the families of the
[1:22:21] earth will bless so in verse 4 it says
[1:22:23] so abraham departed
[1:22:26] this is his testimony
[1:22:27] think about it
[1:22:29] abraham is just eating berries for
[1:22:31] breakfast and dinner and having meat for
[1:22:34] lunch
[1:22:34] and one day god speaks to him and says
[1:22:37] get out of your country away from your
[1:22:39] kindred and from your father's house
[1:22:42] and and to a place i'll show you later
[1:22:43] i'm not going to tell you where you're
[1:22:44] going you just need to start leaving and
[1:22:45] the bible says abraham departed as the
[1:22:47] lord had spoken to them
[1:22:49] that's it
[1:22:50] this is what happened the lord had said
[1:22:52] unto abram and spoke to abram and he
[1:22:54] says he departed just as the lord had
[1:22:56] spoke to him and lot went with them and
[1:22:58] abram was 75 years old when he departed
[1:23:00] out of haran
[1:23:02] so god had spoke to him it was god that
[1:23:05] had let him out it's god who's leading
[1:23:06] them
[1:23:08] and he's in that next step of the
[1:23:10] journey where he has to separate
[1:23:12] from his father's house but then lot
[1:23:14] goes with them
[1:23:16] and i know these are just a few verses
[1:23:18] of the lord speaking to abram and
[1:23:19] telling him to get out of his country
[1:23:21] from his country from his kindred and
[1:23:23] from his family
[1:23:24] but we've got to it's important for us
[1:23:26] to grasp the circumstances that are
[1:23:28] expressed here it's important for us to
[1:23:30] even understand the exact situation
[1:23:33] that's in these verses because it's very
[1:23:35] critical to understanding our faith
[1:23:37] there's a there's just an unassuming
[1:23:39] simplicity in it
[1:23:41] i know there's just things that that we
[1:23:43] we want to make out to be very very
[1:23:45] great but it was just an ob this
[1:23:47] obedient faith is born in this very
[1:23:49] scripture that we're reading it's born
[1:23:51] and it's a faith that's going to change
[1:23:52] the entire world
[1:23:54] so a faith that's going to change all of
[1:23:56] humanity
[1:23:57] and when you read about abraham it's not
[1:23:59] wealth that makes them stand out is you
[1:24:02] read the narrative as you try to figure
[1:24:04] out who abraham was it's not wealth that
[1:24:05] makes him who he is there's no wars that
[1:24:07] make him great right he doesn't rebel
[1:24:10] and cause a civil war in ur he doesn't
[1:24:12] defend against invaders in the land of
[1:24:14] the chaldeans there's nothing of that
[1:24:15] that makes his name great as you look at
[1:24:18] the history of abraham there's no laws
[1:24:19] that he that are ascribed to him there's
[1:24:21] no art that he's to be the originator of
[1:24:24] there's no armies there's no science
[1:24:26] there's nothing about aim there's no not
[1:24:28] even lands that are attributing him that
[1:24:29] makes abraham famous there's one thing
[1:24:31] that makes abraham famous it's his faith
[1:24:34] nothing else
[1:24:36] do you look at his history try to find
[1:24:37] out what made abraham so great wasn't
[1:24:39] his wealth
[1:24:41] wasn't his
[1:24:42] family wasn't his contributions to
[1:24:45] science or the arts
[1:24:46] it was simply his faith
[1:24:49] abraham represents faith in god
[1:24:52] a god that was personally revealed
[1:24:54] to abraham
[1:24:56] and so as abraham travels we're just
[1:24:58] wanting to consider this journey
[1:25:00] it comes out of earth the land of
[1:25:01] counties comes to haran
[1:25:03] and the lord had spoken to him and told
[1:25:05] him
[1:25:05] to go so he departs and he begins to
[1:25:07] leave he departs out of haran and he's
[1:25:09] going to come to that place that god had
[1:25:11] showed him
[1:25:12] and as he travels towards canaan he's in
[1:25:14] obedience to god's command
[1:25:16] he's got faith in the promise
[1:25:20] one commentary i'd read said get thee
[1:25:22] out of thy country from thy kindred and
[1:25:24] from thy father's house unto a land that
[1:25:26] i'll show thee
[1:25:28] this was god's first revelation of
[1:25:30] himself to abraham
[1:25:32] up to this time
[1:25:34] abraham to all appearance had no
[1:25:36] knowledge of any god
[1:25:38] but the deities worshiped by his fathers
[1:25:40] in caldea
[1:25:42] now he finds within himself impulses
[1:25:45] which he cannot resist
[1:25:47] in which he is conscious that he ought
[1:25:49] not to resist
[1:25:51] he believes it to be his duty to adopt a
[1:25:53] course which may look foolish
[1:25:55] in which he can justify only by saying
[1:25:58] that his conscience bids him
[1:26:01] he recognizes apparently for the first
[1:26:03] time
[1:26:04] that through his conscience there speaks
[1:26:05] to him a god who is supreme
[1:26:09] in dependence on this god he gathered
[1:26:11] his possessions together and departed
[1:26:15] as i was thinking about this today
[1:26:18] i was thinking i'm so glad
[1:26:20] abraham did it
[1:26:23] so that i could have the example
[1:26:26] that god wants to start something in
[1:26:28] abraham so now once he has worked with
[1:26:30] abraham and called him in this manner
[1:26:32] it's abraham's testimony that eventually
[1:26:34] becomes the old testament
[1:26:36] right because it's the story of abraham
[1:26:37] and his seed to whom the promise is
[1:26:39] given and then the fulfillment of that
[1:26:41] promise to his seed is the new testament
[1:26:43] so that we don't have to go by
[1:26:45] impulse alone we have a word that's been
[1:26:48] preserved for us we have an example that
[1:26:50] we can look to and go by he says that
[1:26:52] abraham
[1:26:53] had by all appearance had no knowledge
[1:26:55] of a god other than the false deities
[1:26:58] worshiped by his family
[1:27:00] but then god speaks to him and as god
[1:27:01] speaks to me finds an impulse deep
[1:27:03] inside of him
[1:27:05] which he cannot resist and he knows that
[1:27:07] he should not resist
[1:27:10] and he feels compelled that i must
[1:27:12] follow the leading of this god i must
[1:27:14] follow the leading of this spirit and
[1:27:16] though it may seem foolishness to
[1:27:19] everyone else around me
[1:27:21] but i must do it and he knows now
[1:27:23] there's a god who is supreme
[1:27:27] because none of the other deities could
[1:27:28] speak
[1:27:30] they could just imagine a a a a a a
[1:27:33] voice they could just prostrate
[1:27:34] themselves before these idols and desire
[1:27:36] that they speak but this was a god that
[1:27:39] could speak to them and the most
[1:27:40] important to me the most incredible
[1:27:42] aspect is here's everyone worshiping
[1:27:45] physical things worshiping nature and
[1:27:47] the god of nature speaks to abraham in a
[1:27:49] supernatural way he sees no vision he
[1:27:52] sees no man but god speaks to him and he
[1:27:54] knows this is who i ought to follow
[1:27:58] that's why this is a fa the father of
[1:28:00] our faith
[1:28:01] as he didn't put his faith in the flesh
[1:28:03] he didn't put his faith in an altar he
[1:28:04] didn't put his faith faith
[1:28:06] in a man or some sort of image it was
[1:28:08] faith in a god that spoke to his heart
[1:28:10] he says i know this is god i know this
[1:28:13] is the supreme i know this is the one
[1:28:15] that is greater than everyone else
[1:28:18] and so it's faith in the word that
[1:28:19] compelled abraham
[1:28:21] it wasn't curiosity it wasn't a columbus
[1:28:25] wasn't just trying to go and discover
[1:28:27] new lands or get away from his father so
[1:28:28] he can be on his own
[1:28:31] abraham didn't leave for notoriety he
[1:28:32] didn't leave for wealth he didn't leave
[1:28:34] for family
[1:28:36] abraham left
[1:28:38] following god
[1:28:41] and brother ram tells us he's chosen out
[1:28:43] of all humanity a normal man just like
[1:28:45] you or i
[1:28:46] and god chooses him out of all humanity
[1:28:49] to walk with him
[1:28:51] abraham didn't step forth from the
[1:28:53] breath of god
[1:28:54] the bible tells us that we're to follow
[1:28:56] the in the steps of christ
[1:28:58] and we begin to think about christ we
[1:29:00] think wow he was he bypassed the virgin
[1:29:02] birth or he bypassed the sexual birth he
[1:29:04] came born as a virgin and he comes
[1:29:06] knowing who his father was and he lives
[1:29:08] a sinless life and he never never does
[1:29:10] anything wrong i think that's my example
[1:29:13] and it can be very very hard for us in
[1:29:14] our carnal minds to think that i can
[1:29:16] ever be like christ regardless of what
[1:29:18] the scriptural promises are but maybe we
[1:29:20] can begin by identifying that we can be
[1:29:21] like abraham
[1:29:23] abraham was born of a woman just like
[1:29:24] your eye a man with passions just like
[1:29:26] your eye struggles and trials if you go
[1:29:28] and look into his life abraham's life is
[1:29:31] not just this picture of perfection
[1:29:33] abraham had problems
[1:29:35] abraham had struggles he had
[1:29:37] difficulties had ups and downs he had he
[1:29:39] had opposition but abraham's faith is
[1:29:41] what survives it all as something that
[1:29:44] should be admired
[1:29:46] abraham didn't step forth from the
[1:29:48] breath of god he came forth as humanity
[1:29:49] just like your eye
[1:29:51] when abraham begins to walk out of ur
[1:29:53] and he comes down in haran and he
[1:29:55] ultimately ends up in the promise of
[1:29:56] it's not famine that drives them out
[1:29:59] it's not war that drives them out
[1:30:01] but he's under the influence of an
[1:30:02] unseen god
[1:30:05] think of it amid idol worshipers
[1:30:09] idolatrous all bowing to the things that
[1:30:12] can be seen
[1:30:13] abraham bows to the invisible
[1:30:18] his families are idolaters they're in a
[1:30:20] land of idolatry
[1:30:22] but it's from that pedigree
[1:30:24] that god chooses abraham
[1:30:26] and the bible says in abraham
[1:30:29] departed
[1:30:31] this is the first step in a lifetime of
[1:30:32] obedience to the supreme
[1:30:35] the first step
[1:30:36] into a lifetime of an example for us
[1:30:40] brother branham in the masterpieces now
[1:30:42] he's doing the same thing in his
[1:30:43] ever-changing method
[1:30:45] we find out in malachi 3 he said i'm god
[1:30:47] and i change not
[1:30:49] he cannot change his method
[1:30:51] i think this statement is so
[1:30:53] amazing
[1:30:54] now as he started in abraham
[1:30:56] after the fall of the first masterpiece
[1:30:59] he started in abraham on a foundation to
[1:31:02] build
[1:31:03] another masterpiece
[1:31:05] so in the fall
[1:31:06] when god promised genesis 3 15
[1:31:09] that the seed of the woman would crush
[1:31:11] the head of the serpent
[1:31:13] god does not start to bring forth that
[1:31:15] masterpiece
[1:31:16] until the bible says and he called
[1:31:18] abraham said the lord said unto abram
[1:31:22] abram is the beginning
[1:31:24] of the restoration of the fall of the
[1:31:26] masterpiece abraham is the beginning he
[1:31:28] says he started a neighbor on a
[1:31:30] foundation to build another masterpiece
[1:31:33] and what did it climax in christ
[1:31:36] abraham is the beginning of abraham he's
[1:31:38] the seed of the masterpiece he's the
[1:31:40] beginning of the masterpiece and he
[1:31:42] started in abraham to build back that
[1:31:45] masterpiece and he says he started on
[1:31:47] the day of pentecost to build another
[1:31:49] masterpiece
[1:31:50] the original seed word started in the
[1:31:52] first church what was it the seed word
[1:31:54] the word manifest the promise that had
[1:31:56] been given
[1:31:57] so just as abraham's promise culminated
[1:32:00] in jesus christ brethren says on the day
[1:32:02] of pentecost there's seed sown of
[1:32:04] another masterpiece and you are that
[1:32:06] masterpiece what is the bride another
[1:32:09] masterpiece in the making he says she's
[1:32:11] the new testament that's all
[1:32:14] seems a little bit dismissive if i'm
[1:32:15] going to be that's all that's what i
[1:32:16] want to be is the new testament
[1:32:18] so abraham was the seeds of jesus christ
[1:32:22] and jesus christ was the perfection and
[1:32:24] the fulfillment of abraham's faith and
[1:32:26] we too are the perfection and the
[1:32:28] fulfillment of the faith of the church
[1:32:32] we are following in the pattern of
[1:32:33] abraham
[1:32:35] who upon god's call god says
[1:32:37] follow me
[1:32:39] and abraham departed the first step in a
[1:32:41] lifetime of obedience to an unseen god
[1:32:44] it says in matthew chapter 1 verse 1 the
[1:32:46] book of the generation of jesus christ
[1:32:50] the son of david
[1:32:52] the son of abraham
[1:32:54] the son of david brings into view the
[1:32:56] king in the kingdom
[1:32:57] that the son of abraham brings into view
[1:32:59] humanity
[1:33:01] the son of man
[1:33:03] so you have the root
[1:33:05] the foundation
[1:33:06] and you have the the throne
[1:33:08] he calls abraham not a king
[1:33:10] not a deity not a sovereign just a
[1:33:13] normal man but he says he is the son of
[1:33:15] david christ is the son of david the son
[1:33:17] of abraham how could he be that because
[1:33:18] there's your root in offspring
[1:33:21] the root the foundation being abraham
[1:33:23] the son of man the humanity but then the
[1:33:25] deity the kingdom
[1:33:29] the bible says we read it already you
[1:33:30] are abraham's seed and heirs according
[1:33:32] to the promise
[1:33:37] you know a seed is the grain of a plant
[1:33:38] that holds the future plants
[1:33:41] that's what a seed is
[1:33:43] there's something
[1:33:44] reserved
[1:33:46] in the seed as a germ
[1:33:48] he says and if you be christ then you're
[1:33:49] abraham's seed
[1:33:51] there was something there's something in
[1:33:53] the image of abraham
[1:33:54] that was a germ of a new race
[1:33:58] the modern events made clear by prophecy
[1:33:59] he says we are supposed to be
[1:34:02] the royal seed of abraham isaac was the
[1:34:04] natural seed
[1:34:06] but the faith seed
[1:34:08] the faith and the promised word the
[1:34:09] promised word don't miss it was that
[1:34:11] royal seed
[1:34:13] that was the seed abraham's faith we've
[1:34:16] been dead in christ we are abraham's
[1:34:18] seed heirs with him according to the
[1:34:20] promise
[1:34:21] and the seed holds the mystery of the
[1:34:23] plant
[1:34:25] if you ever seen a seed they had an
[1:34:26] issue a couple years ago where people
[1:34:28] receive it in their
[1:34:29] from amazon or just from packages
[1:34:31] overseas just packages of seeds
[1:34:34] they had no idea what they were they're
[1:34:35] coming from china and nobody well what
[1:34:36] is this what what what have i received
[1:34:39] and and they wouldn't know what it was
[1:34:40] until they planted it and it would grow
[1:34:43] and so the department of agriculture
[1:34:44] saying whatever you do don't plant the
[1:34:45] seeds don't grow them turn them over to
[1:34:47] us we don't don't want invasive species
[1:34:49] but you can look at a seed and in that
[1:34:51] seed it holds the mystery of the plant
[1:34:55] and so even in abraham's life if you
[1:34:57] take the time of just introduce i know
[1:34:59] it's very very basic very very
[1:35:01] fundamental very simple apologize if i
[1:35:02] failed you tonight but i just wanted to
[1:35:04] share these things in a very simple way
[1:35:06] uh
[1:35:07] hopefully to be able to build on it
[1:35:08] sunday abraham then as the seed held the
[1:35:11] mystery of christ
[1:35:13] if the seed holds the mystery of the
[1:35:15] plant and abraham then it has is the
[1:35:17] beginning of this and he lays the
[1:35:20] foundation his life holds the mystery of
[1:35:22] christ
[1:35:23] and the life of abram then holds the
[1:35:25] mystery of the foundation of simple
[1:35:27] faith
[1:35:29] supreme faith is a is is the faith that
[1:35:32] we have to rise up to the supreme faith
[1:35:34] is the faith that we have to have in
[1:35:36] this hour but look at the life of
[1:35:38] abraham and see that he lived an
[1:35:39] ordinary life of following the plan of
[1:35:41] god the ordinary life of just doing what
[1:35:43] god told them and it was through the
[1:35:45] faith in god if there was any exploits
[1:35:47] it was god that did them because abraham
[1:35:49] believed
[1:35:53] my last statement tonight from the
[1:35:55] sermon from that time he says let's take
[1:35:56] for instance abraham
[1:35:58] he was just an ordinary man
[1:36:01] he came down from babylon with his
[1:36:02] father
[1:36:03] he dwelt in the land of caldeas in the
[1:36:05] city of ur
[1:36:06] probably a farmer
[1:36:08] an ordinary man he was no special man he
[1:36:11] was just a man
[1:36:13] and he found grace in the sight of god
[1:36:16] and god told him when he was 75 years
[1:36:18] old that he was going to make him a
[1:36:19] father of nations and that he was going
[1:36:21] to give him a child by his wife sarah
[1:36:23] who was 65 years old at the time
[1:36:25] and abraham believed god
[1:36:28] it was imputed in him for righteousness
[1:36:31] that's it
[1:36:32] abraham believed god
[1:36:34] that's the testament of image no special
[1:36:36] man
[1:36:37] he was just a man he says probably a
[1:36:39] farmer
[1:36:41] so what was abraham doing
[1:36:43] when god spoke to him he's just farming
[1:36:47] so he's doing picking berries
[1:36:49] going out killing killing something to
[1:36:50] eat for the midday meal
[1:36:53] so he's probably just a farmer
[1:36:55] he was just farming when god came and
[1:36:56] spoke to him
[1:36:58] and supreme faith brother brahm said
[1:36:59] it's just going to be the regular
[1:37:00] routine to follow in the scriptures in
[1:37:02] the plan of god it's just going to be by
[1:37:03] living your life
[1:37:05] we don't have to go out chasing the
[1:37:06] fantastic we don't have to try to find
[1:37:08] some pie in the sky just stay faithful
[1:37:10] to what god called you to do
[1:37:13] stay faithful to the word of god live a
[1:37:15] simple life do the things that you know
[1:37:16] you ought to do as a christian because
[1:37:18] it's from the regular routine it might
[1:37:21] seem to be the mundane
[1:37:23] it might seem to be just the oh the the
[1:37:26] ho-hum and the hum drum of life but
[1:37:28] that's where god manifests himself
[1:37:30] that's where you're going to hear from
[1:37:32] god that's where god is going to make
[1:37:33] himself known
[1:37:34] and it's just as abraham lived that his
[1:37:37] faith received its realization
[1:37:40] it's and as the bible says that as
[1:37:42] abraham offered up isaac his son therein
[1:37:44] was his faith made perfect it was just
[1:37:46] to live in his life that his faith was
[1:37:47] entirely exemplified it was just to live
[1:37:49] in his life that it was filled up
[1:37:52] he wasn't chasing vindication he wasn't
[1:37:54] chasing a moment to where he would have
[1:37:56] enough faith to do something powerful he
[1:37:58] was just doing what god told him to do
[1:38:00] as he continued and my prayer would be
[1:38:02] that for all of us we could just
[1:38:05] take this into our hearts and have this
[1:38:06] kind of dedication that we would desire
[1:38:08] that god would bring forth from us
[1:38:11] this glorious mystery of faith
[1:38:15] how by ordinary people living ordinary
[1:38:17] lives
[1:38:18] and just by living an ordinary life the
[1:38:20] supernatural unfold in its simplicity
[1:38:23] in our daily life
[1:38:26] could we stand tonight
[1:38:31] abraham was living just an ordinary life
[1:38:36] nothing outstanding nothing remarkable
[1:38:40] but god called him
[1:38:42] he says and he believed god
[1:38:45] that's what we can do
[1:38:46] you know for the young people that's all
[1:38:48] you can do is when god speaks you just
[1:38:49] believe him
[1:38:51] just answer to that call
[1:38:54] and say lord i believe in you lord i'm
[1:38:56] going to trust in you could we bow our
[1:38:58] heads tonight
[1:39:01] i appreciate your patience
[1:39:03] i know these things were
[1:39:05] are just incredibly simple and
[1:39:07] foundational
[1:39:10] maybe you could offer a hand to the lord
[1:39:12] if you need prayer and say lord i i i
[1:39:14] believe help my unbelief
[1:39:17] lord i want my faith to become a supreme
[1:39:19] faith
[1:39:20] i want to become supreme to what i've
[1:39:22] had to this point i want more faith
[1:39:25] and i don't believe that that would
[1:39:27] uh offend god tonight
[1:39:29] if our prayer was for more faith
[1:39:31] our gracious heavenly father
[1:39:33] lord as we are standing in your presence
[1:39:35] tonight having fellowship together
[1:39:37] around these scriptures and these
[1:39:39] quotations
[1:39:42] i trust lord not from my vantage point
[1:39:46] but from the here's vantage point i
[1:39:50] i pray lord that there's been something
[1:39:53] quicken to them
[1:39:55] and it's
[1:39:56] just at the beginning of this thought
[1:39:58] and subject that abraham
[1:40:00] is someone that we can relate to
[1:40:03] ordinary man
[1:40:04] nothing special or outstanding about him
[1:40:06] just a simple ordinary life a farmer
[1:40:10] a gatherer or a hunter
[1:40:13] from a family of unbelievers
[1:40:16] but you called him
[1:40:18] and in him was an impulse
[1:40:21] a drive and a desire
[1:40:24] that he could not
[1:40:26] walk away from he knew
[1:40:28] they ought to heed it
[1:40:31] and lord if there be anyone here tonight
[1:40:33] that has resisted that call resisted
[1:40:35] that voice may they yield to you lord
[1:40:38] may they accept you
[1:40:41] there be any that are getting weary in
[1:40:43] the journey lord encourage their faith
[1:40:46] there's a payoff coming lord
[1:40:48] it's going to be worth it all one day
[1:40:51] i pray that you would encourage them to
[1:40:53] believe
[1:40:54] for the impossible to believe for the
[1:40:56] destiny lord
[1:40:58] lord for this church
[1:41:00] so we see you blessing them and
[1:41:01] increasing them
[1:41:03] we see them growing
[1:41:05] lord may they recognize that it's all
[1:41:07] been done by simple faith
[1:41:10] yielding to you our resources yielding
[1:41:12] to you the things that we have taking
[1:41:13] what was in our hands
[1:41:15] and consecrating it to you
[1:41:18] and what you could do to one man yielded
[1:41:20] what you could do through one man that's
[1:41:22] yielded what you could do through just
[1:41:23] the simple things that we have lord
[1:41:26] all the volumes that could be written
[1:41:28] just from this work alone
[1:41:30] we could just yield ourselves to you
[1:41:32] not to try to have our name on a marquee
[1:41:34] not to do something popular not to get
[1:41:36] attention but just as abraham
[1:41:39] left and obeyed lord
[1:41:41] may we likewise follow you
[1:41:45] and may the supreme faith that can only
[1:41:47] come by following the scripture
[1:41:50] may it rise up within us lord
[1:41:53] commit the people to you tonight those
[1:41:54] that lifted their hands desiring more
[1:41:56] faith desire and encouragement
[1:42:00] a quickening lord i pray that you would
[1:42:01] grant it
[1:42:03] we thank you for this time that we've
[1:42:04] had together tonight

[1:47:47] i
[1:47:48] love the message tonight
[1:47:52] it put in all of our reach we
[1:47:55] are just like abraham we were in the
[1:47:58] same
[1:47:59] place that he was just being called out
[1:48:02] from
[1:48:03] of our family who were idol worshipers
[1:48:06] come on
[1:48:08] and uh and if it wasn't our family it
[1:48:10] was our family's family you know yeah um
[1:48:14] but
[1:48:15] we
[1:48:16] have the same
[1:48:19] i i love to say we have the same genes
[1:48:21] but i just want to say it like this to
[1:48:23] make it in our reach if we're
[1:48:24] questioning that
[1:48:26] all we have to do is
[1:48:28] believe
[1:48:31] and we believe by obeying the call
[1:48:35] how important it is
[1:48:37] when we come to church we hear the word
[1:48:39] you know what we're doing
[1:48:40] we're hearing god call us amen amen
[1:48:45] he and and he tells us okay now you've
[1:48:47] been walking this way i want you to go
[1:48:49] this way and this way in every step that
[1:48:51] we're taking in the steps of our father
[1:48:54] abraham
[1:48:55] their steps leading us to the promised
[1:48:57] land
[1:49:00] and so we don't this is how important it
[1:49:04] is
[1:49:04] to be in tune
[1:49:06] with the lord when we come to church
[1:49:10] because this is a journey for all of us
[1:49:11] for abraham's children
[1:49:14] i really appreciated that message

[1:49:19] we're going to find him that's where
