[0:00] [Applause]
[0:00] I I just want to say thank you to
[0:02] everybody.
[0:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:03] &gt;&gt; Because everybody like participated and
[0:06] working through everything and the I
[0:09] just appreciate everybody working
[0:10] together to give us the very very best
[0:12] that we have.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; Just a great appreciation I have and
[0:17] that ending with that course. Actually,
[0:19] the last two courses just really ties in
[0:22] with our message today. We were on the
[0:24] mind of God.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. even before the foundation
[0:28] of the world and Calvary was just a part
[0:32] where he still had us on his mind when
[0:36] he was suffering.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; And this morning, uh, we are on his
[0:41] mind.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; And it's all part of a vision that God
[0:44] has for us to see us through the end.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:48] &gt;&gt; And I really appreciate Brother Gordy
[0:50] doing that. He's uh just, you know,
[0:53] never practicing with us, never working
[0:55] with us, but uh just a willingness
[0:57] there, you know, I I just think that's a
[1:01] that's the body of Christ working
[1:02] together to help one another. We don't
[1:04] have to have things perfect. We just got
[1:06] to have a heart of love. Amen.
[1:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you would uh for
[1:11] our opening scripture. We're just going
[1:12] to read one verse today, and it's in
[1:14] Jeremiah 29:1.
[1:18] We want to entitle this walking in God's
[1:20] vision for our lives.
[1:23] Walking in God's vision for our lives.
[1:25] Before I read, I just want to let you
[1:27] know that brother Jose
[1:29] from
[1:31] um let me see why did I forget where
[1:34] he's from. Where is he from?
[1:37] Um what Kitchen Kitchen
[1:41] uh had sent his greetings today.
[1:43] Hopefully he's not watching me mess up
[1:45] this morning.
[1:47] Um,
[1:49] and uh, appreciate um, it's so good to
[1:53] see brother Charlie Neyma here,
[1:55] &gt;&gt; and I'm not sure, but I think this is
[1:57] the first time I've seen him look so
[1:59] good and and uh,
[2:02] just good to have him with us today.
[2:04] He's been gone a while. Amen. Amen.
[2:09] Before we begin reading, let's look to
[2:11] the Lord in a word of prayer. Our
[2:13] heavenly father, thank you for your
[2:14] presence, Lord. Thank you for your
[2:17] people that brought you here today
[2:21] um to uh join together to make more of
[2:26] you in our midst.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we just could not have you in
[2:31] this amount without one another. We just
[2:35] thank you for your grace in our lives.
[2:37] And as we come together,
[2:40] Lord, we have worshiped you. We have
[2:42] praised you in song and chorus
[2:45] in testimony and through through
[2:48] trusting you in prayer.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; Now Lord, as we enter into the uh word,
[2:53] we want to worship you in the the
[2:57] unveiling of the word of God. And
[2:59] &gt;&gt; pray Lord that you would fill the hungry
[3:02] &gt;&gt; this this morning, Lord, and draw us all
[3:05] closer to you. Let us leave here with uh
[3:08] more of you than when we came.
[3:11] Lord, as that one song, let our hearts
[3:13] burn within us.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; Lord, as you talk with us along the way,
[3:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, we love you and ask you to bless
[3:19] the reading of your word and the
[3:21] furtherance of this message. May you
[3:23] take these lips of clay, Lord, forgive
[3:25] me of my trespasses and sins, anything
[3:27] that would stand in the way that you
[3:29] just use this vessel to minister to your
[3:31] bride today. And God will give you the
[3:33] glory for it all. in Jesus Christ's name
[3:35] we pray. Amen.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jeremiah chapter 29 verse number
[3:40] 11. For I know the thoughts I think
[3:43] toward you, sayeth the Lord. Thoughts of
[3:46] peace and not of evil. Amen. God bless
[3:50] you. You may be seated. We were on his
[3:52] mind. Amen. We were on his mind not just
[3:56] at Calvary, but before the foundation of
[3:58] the world. And and God does have an
[4:01] expected end for us. Amen.
[4:04] &gt;&gt; Now, God's thoughts towards us are not
[4:06] the same thoughts that we have towards
[4:08] oursel our ourselves. Uh number one,
[4:12] God's thoughts are higher than our
[4:14] thoughts. Our thoughts are lower about
[4:15] our ourselves.
[4:17] Um our carnal mind, the Bible says, is
[4:21] emnity with the mind of God.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; And so that there is separating the two
[4:26] minds. And this is why we need to seek
[4:29] the mind of Christ uh which is the word
[4:32] of God for our lives. The mind of Christ
[4:34] is this word in in in process.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; It it's we don't have to like well I
[4:40] wonder what the mind of God is. No, we
[4:42] know what the mind of God is right here.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; We may not know where our next job is or
[4:48] what we're uh what we're going to be
[4:50] eating. Uh but we know how to conduct
[4:53] ourselves. We know how to act. We know
[4:55] the boundaries of our lives. We know
[4:57] what God wants for us. We know what
[4:59] we're to become. And that's all written
[5:02] in the word of God.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; And Philippians 2:5 tells us, "Let this
[5:08] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[5:10] Jesus."
[5:11] &gt;&gt; So just it's about the process of
[5:14] letting it happen. How do we how do we
[5:16] let it happen? How is the temperature
[5:18] for everybody today?
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Good.
[5:21] It feels a little bit, you know, a
[5:24] little bit chippery, but what we can do
[5:26] is um, you know, just um, get excited
[5:29] about the word and kind of warm things
[5:30] up.
[5:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; In other words, let the same thoughts
[5:35] that God thinks, let them be in you.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; With the mind of Christ, we can know our
[5:42] expected end. We can know God's vision
[5:44] for our lives. Brother Brandham said,
[5:46] "Nothing but perfect love will enter in
[5:49] there." Now we're talking about the end
[5:50] here.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Nothing but but perfect love can enter
[5:54] in that place. It was so perfect, so
[5:57] pure that brother Brandham said that
[5:58] there was no words in the English
[6:00] language or no language at all that
[6:03] could describe how that love really was.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; So the expected end I mean God God has
[6:10] thoughts of us of an expected end. And I
[6:12] understand that I'm just going to take a
[6:13] portion of this this the this scripture
[6:15] today and I'm going to apply it to what
[6:18] God has for us for the end. And he wants
[6:20] us to walk in that vision for our lives
[6:23] today. Not just try to wait hopefully
[6:25] that we make it or we wing it, we get
[6:27] there. But no, God wants us walking in
[6:30] that.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Corinthians 2:9 says, "But as it
[6:34] is written, I have not seen nor ear
[6:37] heard, neither have it entered into the
[6:39] heart of man the things that God has
[6:43] prepared for them that love him."
[6:46] &gt;&gt; Notice the criteria is loving God.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; If that's not there, everything is off
[6:53] the books.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; Everything is off the books. Love has to
[6:58] be there. But God hath revealed them
[7:00] unto us how by his spirit. For the
[7:04] spirit searchth all things, yay, the
[7:06] deep things of God. For what man knoweth
[7:08] the things of a man, say the spirit of
[7:11] man which is in him, even so the things
[7:13] of God knoweth no man,
[7:16] but the spirit of God.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; See, we have to have the mind of Christ.
[7:20] Amen.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; We we can't we can't wing it on our
[7:24] natural intellect and our ability to
[7:26] kind of figure out things.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; It's with the mind of Christ that we can
[7:31] know our expected end.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; And it's when we receive revelation of
[7:35] God's word. I'll just say it like this.
[7:37] When you literally receive revelation of
[7:40] God's word that now becomes the mind of
[7:43] Christ.
[7:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; Because it's the mind of Christ that
[7:46] speaks to you. It's the mind of Christ
[7:48] that reveals himself to you. And as you
[7:51] receive revelation, that becomes the
[7:54] mind of Christ.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; That's how we can have the mind of
[7:58] Christ. We can't have the mind of Christ
[7:59] by just the knowledge of the Bible,
[8:02] &gt;&gt; by just the knowledge of the scriptures
[8:04] &gt;&gt; by by uh John 3:16. No, that is that he
[8:09] hid it from the wise and prudent. I
[8:11] mean, scholars can know the Bible inside
[8:13] and out uh as far as knowing the
[8:15] scriptures and really never know God.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; So, it it's this word has to be revealed
[8:20] to you.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us that we've been
[8:24] predestinated to be conformed to the
[8:27] image of God's son.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; It's it's our expected end that we're
[8:33] going to be in the same image of God.
[8:36] The Bible teaches us that the world is
[8:39] being conformed more and more, right?
[8:43] &gt;&gt; We can see Satan's image is being more
[8:46] and more manifested out there.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Bible says that Satan deceiveth the
[8:50] whole world. Uh and he he's he's getting
[8:53] them to take he's getting them to
[8:56] compromise.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. You you see the world the
[8:59] church world compromise compromise
[9:01] compromise more and more become let more
[9:04] things into the uh let more things into
[9:06] the government let more things into the
[9:08] church let more things into the home
[9:10] compromise compromise
[9:13] &gt;&gt; the world is becoming more into the
[9:16] image of Satan
[9:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus said that that he wasn't of the
[9:21] world he says we're not of the world and
[9:23] he prayed that we would be kept from the
[9:25] world
[9:26] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; 1 John 2:16 says, "For all that is in
[9:30] the world, the lust of the flesh, the
[9:32] lust of the eyes, the pride of life, is
[9:34] not of the father, but is of the world."
[9:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; "And the world passeth away, and the
[9:39] lust thereof." Verse 15, "Love not the
[9:42] world, neither the things that are in
[9:43] the world. For if any man love the
[9:45] world, the love of the father is not in
[9:47] him."
[9:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; So, how can we love God and have those
[9:52] things prepared for us if we're loving
[9:55] the world? There is a separation with a
[9:57] believer. He does not love the world,
[9:59] all the things of the world. He has a
[10:01] love for God inside of him.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Paul taught the the Roman church to to
[10:07] to actively uh be working with uh
[10:11] changing their mind. And he said it here
[10:13] in Romans
[10:15] 12:E 2, speaking from the world to God,
[10:19] staying in the same vein. And be not
[10:22] conformed to this world, but be ye
[10:24] transformed.
[10:26] Oh, I love that word.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; Be not conformed to the things of
[10:31] happening in this world, but be
[10:33] transformed by the renewing of the way
[10:36] that you think
[10:39] &gt;&gt; that you may prove what is that good and
[10:41] acceptable and perfect will of God.
[10:42] Amen.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; For I say through the grace given unto
[10:46] me to every man that is among you, that
[10:48] is to every person in this church,
[10:51] not to think of himself more highly than
[10:54] he ought to think,
[10:56] &gt;&gt; but to think soberly according as God
[10:58] has dealt to every man the measure of
[10:59] faith.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; So pride has a way of lifting you up and
[11:03] say, "I'm just going to do what I want
[11:04] to do."
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; That is not soberly.
[11:09] That's that's high. That's the same
[11:11] thing Satan had. Well, you know what I'm
[11:13] going to do? I'm just going to leave
[11:15] God's authority and I'm going to go
[11:17] build my own kingdom.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; And that he offered that to Eve and he
[11:21] offers that to the to the really he's
[11:23] offering that to the church world.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; And so they still feel that that uh
[11:28] security, but it's a false sense of
[11:30] security.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; There there really when you leave the
[11:33] word, you leave God.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; And you leave God, there is nothing for
[11:37] you. Nothing can save you. Nothing's
[11:40] going to save you out there.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. Because the God has come
[11:45] to save us from the worldly nature.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Most believers don't think very soberly.
[11:59] But
[12:02] they don't think it's a sober thing to
[12:04] suffer.
[12:09] But we have to suffer to become like
[12:11] Christ. Amen.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; We have to there is no way that we can
[12:15] sit in a comfortable life and through
[12:18] intellect
[12:20] uh get character
[12:24] &gt;&gt; because brother Bam said character is
[12:26] only b only built in the fiery furnace
[12:31] of trials.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; That isn't part way you can get it and
[12:34] the other part way you can get it is is
[12:36] on a comfortable lazy boy.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Right. So you have to be willing to
[12:41] suffer.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; And when you're you decide that in your
[12:46] mind, I am going to be transformed by
[12:50] renewing the way I think. In other
[12:52] words, I'm not going to think anymore
[12:53] the way the world thinks. Just kind of
[12:55] wing it, do what you want. Uh fake it,
[12:58] whatever it might be. But I'm actually
[13:00] going to subject myself to the word.
[13:02] Well, when you subject yourself to the
[13:04] word, your flesh is suffering
[13:06] &gt;&gt; because your flesh don't want to do
[13:08] that. Your flesh don't want to come
[13:09] under subjection to the word and and
[13:11] come under obedience to the word. So,
[13:14] there is a suffering that takes place in
[13:16] us in order to be transformed.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; But God has not given us the spirit of
[13:25] fear.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; But of power and of love and of a sound
[13:29] mind. That's a sober mind.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; God wants us to think soberly. The only
[13:36] way we can think soberly is yield to the
[13:39] spirit of God because the spirit of the
[13:42] devil is confusion. The Bible says that
[13:43] Satan is the author of confusion.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; And and God is the author of sound mind.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; A sound mind is the way that God thinks.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; I know the thoughts I think towards you.
[13:57] They're sound thoughts. They're not
[13:59] wishy-washy. One day I want you, one day
[14:01] I don't. No. God wants us. He died for
[14:04] us. He did everything he can. Now he's
[14:06] given us his word that we may dress
[14:08] oursel and become like the image of
[14:10] Christ.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; God's
[14:17] sober mind, a sober mind is the way that
[14:20] God thinks. It's full of of humility.
[14:24] That's why the Bible says that that that
[14:26] we should not think more highly than we
[14:29] ought to think. Brother Rand one place
[14:30] says if you lift your eyes above the
[14:33] dust, you're lifting yourself above what
[14:36] God made you from.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; Always remember who you really are.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; It is by the grace of God that we are
[14:44] his bride.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; I just want to read verse one of Romans
[14:51] 12:1. This is a sobering thinking of God
[14:55] here. I beseech you therefore, brethren,
[14:57] by the mercies of God, that you present
[15:00] your body, a living sacrifice, holy and
[15:04] acceptable unto God, which is your
[15:06] reasonable service. Now, we all know
[15:08] what sacrifices are. We've all heard of
[15:10] the Mayans and the different people
[15:12] who've offered sacrifices, and we've
[15:14] probably even heard of it today.
[15:17] people offering things as sacrifices and
[15:20] they can be animals and they can Hey,
[15:22] there's people that even done human
[15:23] beings.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; And we we think of a sacrifice as
[15:28] something you just you just cut it, you
[15:31] dye it, it's done, and it's over with.
[15:33] But Paul is saying that that's not how
[15:35] Christians are. Christians die daily.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; Christians present themselves to the
[15:40] Lord daily.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um Paul is saying this is the
[15:45] reasonable service of a Christian.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; This this this may not be the the
[15:51] denominational belief of all I got to do
[15:53] is repent, get baptized, and okay, I'm
[15:55] saved. No. No. God, you give your life
[15:58] to God. Your life belongs to God. That's
[16:00] all there is to it.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; And now you give yourself to be used by
[16:03] God on a regular basis.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; So we present our mind to think God's
[16:09] thoughts. We present our body to live
[16:12] out God's thoughts. We just present
[16:14] ourselves a complete living sacrifice.
[16:18] Have thy own way, Lord.
[16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; Now, the full mind of Christ will lead
[16:22] us to the vision that Christ has for our
[16:25] lives. And that's God's expected end.
[16:28] And we just need to follow this
[16:30] sacrificial life to get there. In other
[16:32] words, you're not going to get to the
[16:34] end your way.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; There's two ways. One is straight and
[16:38] narrow and the other is broad. You do
[16:41] not get to the expected end, the broad
[16:43] way. You do not. It leads to
[16:45] destruction. It's the straight and
[16:46] narrow path that leads you onto life.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; Accepting the word of God into your
[16:53] lives will produce the mind of Christ,
[16:57] which is a sacrificial life. You have to
[16:59] accept the word of God. You can't come
[17:01] to church, read your Bible, listen to
[17:03] the tapes, hear what the prophet said,
[17:05] and say, you know, I don't feel like
[17:06] doing that today.
[17:08] You might as well just I don't feel like
[17:10] expected to end today. But see, what
[17:12] Satan wants to do, he wants to tell you,
[17:14] you don't have to do that, and you can
[17:15] still make it. I'm telling you, that's a
[17:17] lie from hell.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; That is a lie from hell.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; So true.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; We have to follow a sacrificial life.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Because that is what's leading us to the
[17:29] expected end. Turn with me if you would
[17:31] to first Peter chapter 2
[17:33] verse 21. How many believes the word
[17:36] today?
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. This word is what are it
[17:40] gives us strength right to to to follow
[17:42] God with all of our heart. First Peter
[17:45] chapter 2 vers 21 says for even here
[17:48] unto were we all called.
[17:52] We were called
[17:54] &gt;&gt; because Christ also suffered for us at
[17:58] Calvary. Right? That's our last chorus
[18:00] there. Leaving us an example
[18:05] that we should follow his steps.
[18:12] His his steps. His steps. His his steps.
[18:16] He's willing to suffer
[18:21] to see God's family come back together.
[18:24] We've got to be willing to suffer to see
[18:27] us come into the image of Jesus Christ.
[18:30] Now, the Bible says that who did no sin,
[18:33] neither was guile found in his mouth.
[18:35] Who when he was vowed, he vowed not
[18:37] again. When he suffered, he threatened
[18:38] not, but he committed himself to him
[18:40] that judgeth righteously. So, here it
[18:42] is. He's the he's he's perfect. He's
[18:46] sinless. He's done no wrong. Pilate
[18:49] says, "I find no fault in him. He's an
[18:51] absolute lamb of God, peerless, without
[18:54] any blemishes. He's done nothing to ever
[18:56] hurt anybody. And yet, he's willing to
[18:59] suffer that you and I might be saved.
[19:02] &gt;&gt; A and Peter's saying, "This is the
[19:04] example that you got to follow."
[19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to go to a cross, but
[19:10] you have a cross to bear.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; You have to suffer. You have to die out.
[19:15] Amen.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; Because one is there's no other way that
[19:18] you will become in the image of Jesus
[19:20] Christ unless you're willing to die out.
[19:22] That's number one. Number two is that
[19:24] God wants to use your life to spread the
[19:26] gospel to somebody else that needs
[19:27] salvation.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:30] 1 Peter chapter 2:13, that same chapter.
[19:34] We're just going to come down and we're
[19:35] going to see in this chapter that that
[19:37] that God wants us to be willing to
[19:40] suffer and come under subjection to to
[19:43] all authority.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; And I start with verse number 13. I'm
[19:46] going to read through this kind of
[19:47] quickly. Submit yourself to every
[19:50] ordinance of man for the Lord's sake,
[19:53] whether it be to the king or the supreme
[19:55] or unto governors as to them that are
[19:57] sent by him for the punishment of
[19:59] evildoers. For or and for the praise of
[20:02] them that do well for in so for so is
[20:06] the will of God that with welloing you
[20:10] may put to silence the ignorance of
[20:11] foolish men.
[20:13] So God wants us to submit ourselves. You
[20:15] know most Christians don't want to be H
[20:22] God is calling. God is a God of order.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; God is not a God of free-for-all.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; You know, you go do what you want to do.
[20:32] No, there's with God, there's headship.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; And when you stay under that headship,
[20:38] then you're under the protection of God.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; But you get out of that headship and
[20:43] then you start doing what you want to
[20:45] do, you are outside of God's boundaries.
[20:47] Amen.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; And under God's umbrella now, he's just
[20:51] telling us that we need to be under
[20:54] subjection to every ordinance of man.
[20:58] Why? For the Lord's sake.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine a Christian wanting to,
[21:05] you know, go against the government and
[21:06] go against the police and go against
[21:08] this and and let's even blow up the
[21:11] abortion clinics and let's do this. But
[21:13] we're going to stand there and say,
[21:14] "Yeah, I'm a Christian.
[21:17] This is not representing who Christ is.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; That's not what Christ did.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; So, we have a word that we come under
[21:24] subjection to. We stay under subjection
[21:26] to that. And then when people look at
[21:28] your life, they say, "Yes, you're a
[21:30] Christian."
[21:32] &gt;&gt; That's how they're going to know.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Okay. And in verse 16, as free. As free.
[21:38] We're free. Not using our liberty to
[21:40] kind of go do whatever we want to do for
[21:43] a cloak of maliciousness, but as
[21:46] servants of God. In other words, take
[21:47] your life and serve somebody. Honor all
[21:50] men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God.
[21:53] Honor the king. Servants. Be subject to
[21:55] your masters with all fear. Not only to
[21:57] the good and gentle, but also to the
[21:59] fraward. For this is thankw worthy of a
[22:01] man for conscience towards God. He
[22:03] endures grief. He suffers wrongfully.
[22:05] For what glory is it? For when you're
[22:06] buffeted for your faults and you take it
[22:08] patiently, but excuse me, but if when
[22:11] you do well and suffer for it and you
[22:13] take it patiently, this is what is
[22:16] acceptable with God. Because this is
[22:18] exactly what Jesus Christ did.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; He suffered. He didn't have to suffer,
[22:24] but he suffered that he might help
[22:25] others. And a lot of times, people don't
[22:27] want to suffer to help others.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; To me, it shows that the spirit of
[22:31] Christ isn't there. I'm I'm sorry, but
[22:33] if Christ is in you, he's the same
[22:35] yesterday, today, and forever. And he
[22:37] will live for others. That's what
[22:38] brother Brandham said. Eternal life is
[22:40] living for others. Sometimes people
[22:42] don't even want to die out to become
[22:43] like Christ. How are you going to die
[22:45] out to live for somebody?
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel like preaching this morning.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; This is the mind of Christ. This is the
[22:54] vision of God for our lives. And it will
[22:57] lead us to what? Our predestination.
[23:00] Something's got to lead us there.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; You know, come imagine if I was still in
[23:05] the world today, right? God tugged on my
[23:07] heart when I was 16, 17 years old. And
[23:10] what if I just decided I'm going to stay
[23:12] in the world because somebody gave me
[23:14] the scripture. I'm predestinated.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; And every time the devil comes or every
[23:20] time a Christian comes and says, you
[23:22] know, you got to start following the
[23:23] word and say, "No, I don't. No, I don't.
[23:25] I'm predestinated."
[23:28] That's what the devil does with the word
[23:30] predestinated.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; He makes you think that you don't have
[23:34] to get in line with the word and you're
[23:35] still okay. It's a false sense of
[23:38] security.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; We need to continue following Christ's
[23:42] example for our lives. Philippians
[23:44] chapter 2 verse one. Philippians chapter
[23:47] 2 verse one. If there be any
[23:50] consolation,
[23:52] we're going to touch on that word at the
[23:54] end of the service, God willing. If
[23:56] there be therefore any consolation in
[23:59] Christ, if there be any comfort of love,
[24:03] if there be any fellowship of the
[24:06] spirit, if there be any bowels of mercy,
[24:10] fulfill ye my joy, that you be
[24:13] likeminded, having the same love, being
[24:15] of one accord and one mind. God wants us
[24:19] to be like him. He wants us to be in his
[24:22] image. He wants us to be willing to
[24:25] suffer, crucify the flesh, that we can
[24:27] actually be in one mind, that we can be
[24:29] in one core, that we can be like-minded,
[24:32] that we can have fellowship under the
[24:34] umbrella of God.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:39] Let nothing
[24:41] nothing be done
[24:44] through drama
[24:49] through I'm going to prove a point.
[24:53] I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to
[24:55] control you. Let nothing be done through
[24:59] strife or vain glory.
[25:03] Amen. Everybody say amen to that. Amen.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; But in loneliness, see, no man ought to
[25:09] think himself more highly than he ought
[25:10] to. But in loneliness of mind, let each
[25:14] person esteem the other person better
[25:18] than themselves.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean find somebody who's a
[25:23] little bit better than you and esteem
[25:25] them.
[25:27] When Jesus taught us to wash one
[25:29] another's feet, he taught us to find
[25:31] someone that was lower than us and
[25:33] esteem them better than ourselves.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're so caught up in in in
[25:41] thinking that we're something that we
[25:42] don't got time to esteem somebody.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; You know what that is? That is the mind
[25:48] of Satan.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; That's being conformed to the world.
[25:54] And the Bible is teaching me right now.
[25:56] Teaching me, John Martin, to be
[25:58] transformed by the renewing of my mind.
[26:00] Do what the word says. Just do what the
[26:02] word says. It will lead you to your
[26:04] desired haven.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Not just sitting in the church for so
[26:09] many years and and never manifesting the
[26:11] character of Christ.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; That doesn't get you in a rapture.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Let nothing be done through strife and
[26:18] vain glory, but loneliness of mind.
[26:22] Let each esteem other better. I'm going
[26:25] to tell you something today. When you
[26:26] leave church today, find somebody in
[26:28] this church that you're going to esteem
[26:29] better than yourself.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; I think, you know, sometimes we don't
[26:34] even know how to do that.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; You know, we're so full of pride that we
[26:37] actually don't know how to esteem
[26:39] somebody. We're actually wanting
[26:40] somebody to come to us and say something
[26:42] to us.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; Just do what the gospel says and you
[26:46] will become the gospel. Amen.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; You you you when you do the gospel, you
[26:51] get the mind of Christ, it will lead you
[26:55] to the expected end. Because I'm going
[26:57] to tell you, there's going to be a lot
[26:58] of people that come to me in that day
[27:00] and say, "Lord, Lord, didn't I prophesy?
[27:02] Didn't I speak in tongues? Did I do many
[27:04] wonderful works?" And then what I
[27:05] profess unto them, I never knew you.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; But you notice, Brother Brandham said,
[27:13] character is the only thing you're
[27:14] taking with you when you leave.
[27:16] character.
[27:18] And what character did he describe when
[27:21] he was over on the other side? What
[27:23] character did he describe? Perfect love.
[27:26] Now, you tell me. It doesn't take a
[27:29] scientist to figure out where we need to
[27:30] be going.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; It we don't have the pyramid in here,
[27:35] but the p, you know, it's perfect love.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandon said rapturing
[27:40] faith is in the tapes.
[27:43] It's in those tapes that we get perfect
[27:46] faith. And brother Bren says it takes
[27:48] perfect faith
[27:52] &gt;&gt; to make a rapture.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; And we need perfect love for perfect
[28:00] faith to make a rapture.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; So fall in love. We got to fall in love
[28:05] with the word. Amen.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; All right. So let nothing be done the
[28:09] wrong way, but have a humble heart and
[28:11] think about others. Verse four says,
[28:13] "Look not every uh look not every man on
[28:18] his own things." Hey, look at me. Look
[28:20] at me. Look at me, but every man also on
[28:23] the things of others.
[28:27] Okay, I want everyone to say amen to
[28:29] that one. We're taught this is the mind
[28:32] of Christ.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:34] Let this mind, this mind that I've just
[28:37] described, be in you, which was also in
[28:40] Christ Jesus,
[28:41] &gt;&gt; who being in the form of God, thought it
[28:44] not robbery to be equal with God because
[28:47] he was God manifested in the flesh.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't he didn't look at it as
[28:53] robbery.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Didn't he say, "I don't you know I could
[29:00] call for 12 legions of angels right now.
[29:04] He was equal with God. He was God
[29:06] manifested in the flesh.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; He could do anything he wanted to do.
[29:11] But what did he chose to do? He chose to
[29:13] have the mind of Christ, humility.
[29:17] But he made himself verse seven of no
[29:22] reputation. He made himself of no
[29:25] reputation.
[29:27] It wasn't look at me.
[29:30] And he took upon him the form of a
[29:34] servant.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; And was made in the likeness of men. And
[29:39] being found in fashion as a man, he he
[29:43] actually humbled himself more and became
[29:46] obedient unto death, even the death of
[29:50] the cross. Amen.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; And this is the example that Christ is
[29:54] telling us to follow, that Paul's
[29:56] telling us, that Peter's telling us,
[29:58] that the word tells us to follow, that
[30:00] we, the way that we get to our expected
[30:02] end is to humble ourselves onto dying
[30:05] out to our own flesh.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; That the character of Christ might be
[30:09] manifested.
[30:10] Because if we don't got that mentality
[30:13] about humility and dying out, I'm
[30:14] telling you, when you go into a trial,
[30:16] you're not going to humble yourself and
[30:18] you're not going to see God there and
[30:20] you're not going to get the character
[30:21] that you need.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; You've got to be set before a trial
[30:25] comes.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Tell me what lawyer, what attorneys,
[30:30] what lawyers going to court and they're
[30:32] not prepared,
[30:34] &gt;&gt; right? Tell me what World Series is
[30:37] going to get together or what Super Bowl
[30:40] or whatever it might be, two teams
[30:42] coming together if they're not prepared.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Even Jesus said to two two two armies
[30:48] going out to war. Uh if if they're not
[30:51] prepared, what's going to happen?
[30:55] If we're not prepared that I'm going to
[30:57] surrender my life to Jesus Christ when
[30:59] you go into a trial, I'm telling you,
[31:01] you're going to flip like a you're going
[31:02] to be like a fish out of water. you're
[31:04] going to be just crazy going, you know,
[31:05] emotions and all this uh uh confusion
[31:09] going on.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; You got to know, you got to be like, you
[31:13] got to know that you're going to meet
[31:14] God in that fiery furnace. That he's
[31:16] going to be there when you get there.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; He's going to lead you through.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; The mind of Christ is to surrender
[31:25] &gt;&gt; to the will of God.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; That is the mind of Christ. To surrender
[31:30] to the will of God. If any man come
[31:32] after me, let him deny himself, pick up
[31:35] his cross, and follow me.
[31:38] And And where is God leading his bride?
[31:43] To an expected end.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; To perfection,
[31:47] &gt;&gt; to the image of Christ.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; From the beginning,
[31:52] God wanted man in his own image.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; Said, "Let us make man in our own
[31:57] image." Today, God has that same desire.
[32:01] He hasn't changed his mind.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; There he spoke the word and it happened
[32:07] and man chose his way and it caused this
[32:11] fall. And brother Brandon says it put
[32:13] every one of us in the same position
[32:15] that he did with Adam and Eve. We have a
[32:17] choice to make.
[32:20] We're either going to choose to become
[32:22] in the image of Christ or we're going to
[32:24] choose to put peacock feathers and just
[32:26] feel like we're the, you know, we're a
[32:28] decent guy or decent Christian. Are you
[32:31] with me?
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Th this this word
[32:36] you ought to ought to love this word.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:38] &gt;&gt; This is just the word of God. Romans
[32:40] chapter 8 29 says for whom he did forno
[32:45] &gt;&gt; he also did predestinate to be conformed
[32:50] to the image of his son that he might be
[32:53] the firstborn among
[32:55] many brethren.
[33:01] This is the end.
[33:03] The end is to be like him.
[33:05] The end isn't to make it to heaven.
[33:09] What good would heaven be if we're like
[33:11] carnal, selfish? Hey Joe, remember what
[33:16] you did to me the other day?
[33:19] &gt;&gt; You know what?
[33:21] I'm going to get back at you at that.
[33:23] Can you imagine heaven being filled
[33:26] with, "Hey, look at me. I'm better than
[33:28] you."
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Or, "You know what? I remember when that
[33:32] person lied to me. I'm just going to
[33:34] like not be friends with him.
[33:38] So you see, we've got to get our
[33:41] character to be like Jesus Christ. And
[33:43] our focus needs to be in having a vision
[33:47] &gt;&gt; in this this process, this journey that
[33:50] God is taking us through right now to
[33:52] get us to where we need to be
[33:54] &gt;&gt; because now is the time for our
[33:56] character to be built.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; And I'll be honest with you, today,
[34:00] today,
[34:02] every one of us has gone through a
[34:03] trial.
[34:04] Amen.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Today, everybody's gone everybody's gone
[34:07] through a trial to some degree
[34:09] &gt;&gt; and and and and and we could say that
[34:12] number of us could probably number a
[34:14] number of things that was a trial to us.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; But it was in those trials that if you
[34:18] you go in there with the mindset, God, I
[34:21] am willing to just die out and to become
[34:24] like you because I know all things are
[34:25] working for the good. I I know I'm
[34:27] supposed to count it all joy in these
[34:29] trials. Something good is going to
[34:31] happen in my character. may not be for
[34:33] my flesh. I may not, you know, get a
[34:35] fanf fair. I may not get more money. I I
[34:37] may not get everything I want to eat,
[34:39] but I know that I'm going to become more
[34:41] like Jesus.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; So, we're not conformed to this world,
[34:49] but we're being conformed to the image
[34:51] of the son of man. Amen.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; See, that's why the world's becoming
[34:57] the carnal believer is becoming more
[34:59] like the world
[35:01] &gt;&gt; and the bride is becoming more like
[35:02] Christ.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; And it's happening right in the church.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this. It's happening
[35:07] right in the home.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; It it isn't like, oh, the Democrats and
[35:16] Republicans. I'm sorry. That ain't it.
[35:19] It's the it it's the bride and it's the
[35:21] makeel believers.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; And here's the thing. It don't matter if
[35:26] we can prove to one another what we
[35:28] think we are.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; It matters what we're living.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Because by this shall all men know
[35:36] you're my disciples.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; When you have the same image of Christ
[35:40] in your life.
[35:42] Amen.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:46] When you have love one for another, that
[35:48] is the same image of Christ.
[35:52] We're being transformed when our minds
[35:55] think according to the word. So, we come
[35:57] to church, we hear the word, we listen
[35:58] to taste, we hear the word. We read the
[36:00] Bible, we hear the word. We're praying,
[36:01] we hear the word, and the word tells us
[36:03] to do something.
[36:05] There should be a hunger inside of us
[36:07] that says, "Yes, Lord, I'm going to do
[36:08] it."
[36:11] That is showing that you're on the track
[36:15] to your expected end.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; But to go ahead and not do nothing about
[36:19] your character
[36:21] and expect somehow to get there,
[36:25] there's going to be a whole lot of
[36:26] people like that.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, you talk about God in
[36:31] real time. You talk about um recognizing
[36:35] God at the service.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; You talk about, "Oh, I saw God there and
[36:39] this happened and that happened." I'm
[36:40] telling you, God is more with you than
[36:42] you realize through the course of the
[36:43] day.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; He just waiting for you to step in that
[36:46] and believe that
[36:49] &gt;&gt; and and and don't try to be looking for
[36:51] other ways to get character.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; It's just not going to come. God's going
[36:56] to place a trial in front of you and you
[36:58] either you're going to walk in it with
[37:00] faith or you're going to say, "Oh, I'm
[37:01] scared. I'm not going to do that.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; I wish it wasn't happening to me."
[37:09] Now look, I'm on your side. Don't get
[37:11] mad at me.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; I'm just I'm trying to build your faith
[37:16] muscles.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; God is not going to put you through
[37:18] something and not be there.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; And God not going to put anything on you
[37:23] that you can't bear.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Look, we're in the manifesting times
[37:28] right now.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; And everybody's making their choice
[37:31] which way they're going.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; But for me in my house, I will serve the
[37:34] Lord. Amen.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Though none go with me still, I'll
[37:37] follow his example of suffering.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Verse 30. Moreover,
[37:45] whom he did predestinate, them he also
[37:47] called, and them he called, them he also
[37:50] justified, and to whom he justified,
[37:52] them he also glorified. What shall we
[37:55] say to these things? What shall we then
[37:58] say to these things? If this is a true
[38:00] statement, if God be before us, who can
[38:05] be against us?
[38:11] &gt;&gt; That's the testimony
[38:14] that God is wanting us to really have.
[38:18] Not something that we quote, but then we
[38:20] go through a trial, we wonder where
[38:21] God's at.
[38:26] What we wanted to be doing is in the
[38:28] middle of our trial when our when our
[38:30] baby's dead or our son's dead, all is
[38:32] well.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; To be able to look death in the eye and
[38:40] still say, "All is well."
[38:45] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of faith I want.
[38:49] And this word is what builds our faith.
[38:54] getting in sync
[38:57] with God, getting in sync with the mind
[38:59] of Christ,
[39:02] nothing shall be able to separate us
[39:05] from God's vision for our lives. If God
[39:08] before us, who can be against us? No
[39:10] tribulation,
[39:12] no distress, no persecution, no famine,
[39:16] no nakedness, no peril, no sword. None
[39:20] of these things are going to distract us
[39:23] from our walk in our walk with God's
[39:27] vision for our lives.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; In other words, I know this stuff's
[39:31] going on. It ain't good. I understand
[39:33] that. But you know what? God's still
[39:35] building character in me, and I'm not
[39:37] going to get distracted by this. I'm not
[39:39] going to wait till this trial is over.
[39:40] I'm not gonna wait till this thing is
[39:42] done so I can have more confidence.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; We are more than conquerors through
[39:47] Christ. That's what the Bible says.
[39:49] We're more than conquerors. We are
[39:51] persuaded this morning that nothing can
[39:54] separate us from God's vision.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Nothing. No demonic angels, no
[40:00] principalities, no powers, no things
[40:02] present, things to come, not in this
[40:05] life, not even death.
[40:09] We're going to make it because
[40:15] we have accepted
[40:17] the word of God for our lives. This is
[40:19] the only thing. This is the only thing.
[40:22] A love for the truth, a love for the
[40:24] word, a love to become it.
[40:28] We're going to go through trials.
[40:30] That's all there is to it. We're going
[40:32] to have to suffer in order to get
[40:34] character that we need.
[40:37] 1 Peter 4:19 says, "Wherefore let them
[40:40] that suffer according to the will of
[40:43] God," notice, "commit the keeping of
[40:47] their souls to him in welloing as unto a
[40:51] faithful creator." So here's our God
[40:54] that loves us. He He's a God of all
[40:56] comfort, but he also he doesn't stop us
[40:59] from suffering.
[41:01] It it pleased the father to bruise
[41:03] Christ.
[41:05] God is when we go through a trial, you
[41:08] know, I I just I can just see God
[41:10] saying, "Oh, I have a care. There's a
[41:13] chance for character to be built right
[41:14] now."
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; But when they're, you know, they're at
[41:19] they're on their lazy boy, the feet's up
[41:20] and they're watching the football game
[41:22] and, you know, everything is rosy.
[41:28] Time is being wasted for character to be
[41:31] built.
[41:34] I think God, the mind of Christ is
[41:37] different than than our minds.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Paul said in 2 Timothy 1:12, "For which
[41:45] cause I also suffer these things.
[41:48] Nevertheless, I am not ashamed, for I
[41:50] know whom I have believed, and I am
[41:52] persuaded that he's able to keep that
[41:54] which I've committed unto him against
[41:57] that day.
[42:02] What did he what did he commit to God?
[42:06] What did Paul commit to God? Jesus said
[42:10] in Matthew 16:26, "For what is a man
[42:14] profited if he would gain the whole
[42:16] world and lose his soul?"
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Or what shall a man give in exchange for
[42:21] his soul?
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Paul committed his soul to Jesus Christ.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; And he did that by submitting his life
[42:31] to the word. That is how you know you
[42:32] you you give your soul to Jesus Christ.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; You don't just say, "Here, Lord, I give
[42:38] you my soul, but but you don't submit to
[42:41] the word."
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; No, you give your soul to Christ as
[42:48] you're as you're submitting to the word.
[42:52] You're putting your your soul under the
[42:55] protection of the word of God because
[42:57] that's the only thing that can save your
[42:58] soul.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; That's why the word has to become more
[43:03] important to you because your soul is
[43:06] hid in that word.
[43:10] Paul was persuaded that God was not
[43:12] going to throw away his soul
[43:17] &gt;&gt; because he committed it to to the word
[43:20] of God. Paul had a a revelation of God's
[43:23] image and he knew that he hadn't
[43:26] attained it yet. He knew that he hadn't
[43:29] apprehended it yet. And after 30
[43:31] something years, he said, "I press
[43:33] toward the mark for the prize of the
[43:35] high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
[43:39] We can find this in Philippians 3:15.
[43:42] Now it says, "Let us therefore as many
[43:45] as be perfect
[43:48] be thus minded."
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Have the mind of Christ.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; And if anything be otherwise minded, God
[43:58] shall reveal even this unto you.
[44:04] In other words, if you've got the mind
[44:07] of Christ, you're going to pre pressing
[44:09] in.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; What are you pressing into? What What
[44:13] are you pressing into?
[44:16] &gt;&gt; You're you're pressing into the
[44:18] character of Christ.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Not the knowledge of it, but to be able
[44:24] to walk like he walked.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; To be able to get slapped in the face
[44:29] and turn your cheek.
[44:31] to to be able to go the second and the
[44:33] third mile, to be able to lay down your
[44:36] life for one another. And so, as we're
[44:38] evaluating ourselves
[44:42] this morning with the word of God,
[44:45] ask yourself, do do you have all the
[44:49] mind of Christ that you need?
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Is there more that you're wanting?
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Because it is the mind of Christ that
[44:58] will lead you to the expected end. God
[45:00] says, "I know the thoughts I think
[45:02] toward you, sayeth the Lord." They're
[45:04] thoughts of peace. They're the right
[45:06] thoughts.
[45:08] But understand,
[45:10] the father had the right thoughts about
[45:13] Jesus.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; But think about what he had to go
[45:20] through to get the expected end.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; I mean, he had to be he had to suffer.
[45:26] He he was bruised for our
[45:28] transgressions.
[45:30] the the chastisement of our peace was
[45:32] upon him. He he took away our our our
[45:35] iniquities. He he suffered for us.
[45:40] He had to go through that process.
[45:42] And then on Calvary for the joy that was
[45:45] set before them, I he endured the cross
[45:49] because the end our thoughts of peace.
[45:53] He is our peace.
[45:56] But just because we have an expected
[45:58] end, it doesn't mean we don't have to
[46:00] suffer to get there.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; It's through suffering that we get
[46:04] there.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; It's through suffering, through dying
[46:07] out that we come in the image of Christ
[46:09] that we can literally literally live the
[46:12] life of loving for others.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; You know, it's easy to give money when
[46:18] you got it.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; And did you know it's easy to not give
[46:22] money when you don't got it?
[46:27] But just try living for others
[46:30] &gt;&gt; because God is calling us to his image.
[46:35] And Paul said, "I got the mind of
[46:37] Christ. I'm pressing towards that. I
[46:39] have an apprehended there. I wrote 14
[46:42] books of the Bible. I'm one called out
[46:44] of a due season." And um Jesus said, "I
[46:49] I called him and he's going to have to
[46:52] suffer many things for me." Jesus said,
[46:54] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[46:55] &gt;&gt; And he's called us. We're predestinated.
[46:57] He's called us. He's chosen us. But
[46:59] we're going to have to suffer for him.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't think this is a bad thing.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; I don't think there's anything to be
[47:05] discouraged about.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. I
[47:07] &gt;&gt; I think what we got to do is sink our
[47:09] our heart into the plan of God for our
[47:12] lives and accept that this is the way to
[47:15] become into his image.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you don't believe me, just
[47:19] wait till later next week and see the
[47:22] trial you go through
[47:24] &gt;&gt; and may this word come to your thoughts.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Because this is the truth that's being
[47:30] ministered today.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; We need the mind of Christ. We need the
[47:34] higher thoughts of God, which is the
[47:35] word of God to reach the expected end,
[47:38] which is the image of Christ in our
[47:40] life. That's what we've been
[47:41] predestinated to. So let us therefore as
[47:45] as be uh let us therefore as many as be
[47:49] perfect be thus minded.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; So it it's the perfect is just if I
[47:55] could just say it like this is that you
[47:57] have the complete mind of Christ.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; It's not that you don't you don't make
[48:01] any mistakes. It's just you got the
[48:04] complete mind of Christ. you're you're
[48:06] willing to walk the way that the Bible
[48:09] has taught us to walk to to be
[48:11] transformed every time we you know,
[48:13] brother Brandon says you never leave the
[48:14] church the same way you came.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; You're either drawn closer or further
[48:17] away. So you're you're either going to
[48:18] be transformed by the renewing of your
[48:21] mind when the word comes and you really
[48:22] mean business with God. You really mean
[48:24] amen from your heart or you're just
[48:26] going to walk away and quietly reject
[48:28] it.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? Same
[48:32] when you listen to tapes.
[48:34] So it takes
[48:37] a willingness to suffer, to die out to
[48:39] the flesh, to become more like Christ.
[48:41] Romans 8:18 says, "For I reckon that the
[48:45] sufferings of this present time are not
[48:48] worthy to be compared with the glory
[48:50] which shall be revealed in us."
[48:53] &gt;&gt; For the earnest expectation of the
[48:56] creation is waiting for us to be
[48:59] manifested.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; It's waiting on us.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to just say it's
[49:05] waiting on them. I want to be part of
[49:08] them.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; I want to be part of the sons of God
[49:11] that are are manifested. And it's not
[49:14] just for them to manifest and for me to
[49:16] say, "Oh, yeah. I'm a part."
[49:19] But let the redeemed of the Lord say so.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Let those that are are are are
[49:26] his child stand up and say, "I I I'm I'm
[49:30] I'm manifesting Christ today. I'm going
[49:32] to get up and I'm going to manifest
[49:34] Christ today.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; I can't wait to do it, too.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; I'm excited. I'm excited to be able to
[49:41] turn my cheek.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; I'm excited to forgive somebody. To love
[49:46] mercy.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. To bind it around my neck.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; To love truth. To let let Christ come
[49:52] forth out of me.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; It isn't at the pulpit
[49:57] that we just see Christ.
[49:59] We all have a pulpit every day.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; We're written epistles read of all men.
[50:10] So the prophet said
[50:12] that character is not a gift, but it's a
[50:14] victory.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; And what is it? A victory over our
[50:18] flesh. It's a victory over our flesh.
[50:22] It's not it's it's not brother it's not
[50:26] me having victory over brother Ben's
[50:28] flesh.
[50:29] You don't put him in his place, tell him
[50:31] what he needs to do. No,
[50:35] character is a victory over my nature,
[50:39] my carnal nature, and I've got to be
[50:41] willing to suffer, die out to what I
[50:44] want that the love of Christ might be
[50:46] manifested in me.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Character is literally created in the
[50:52] furnace. And when you're willing to walk
[50:55] in your trial without fear, without
[50:58] murmuring, without complaining, trusting
[51:01] that you're going to meet the son of God
[51:03] in your trial.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; And there his love. You know what's
[51:07] going to protect you from the flames?
[51:10] His love.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; What protected the three Hebrew children
[51:14] when they went in?
[51:17] &gt;&gt; It was God's love that kept the flames
[51:19] off of them. But notice those flames
[51:21] actually burned those that threw them
[51:23] in.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. They did.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; They didn't love God. They didn't love
[51:28] the word. But the three Hebrews, they
[51:30] did. Every day we we we go through
[51:33] trials. You got to step in there without
[51:36] murmuring, without complaining, without
[51:38] saying, "Oh Lord, why me?" You got to go
[51:41] in there and you got to you got to
[51:42] believe. I love you, God. I I don't want
[51:44] to go through this trial, but I love
[51:46] you, God. I'm going to walk in there.
[51:48] I'm gonna trust in you and your love is
[51:50] going to protect me.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; I I'm not looking to anybody to change
[51:53] my circumstances. I'm looking to you,
[51:55] Lord.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Because you're the one that orchestrated
[51:58] it. You're the one that has allowed it.
[52:01] That's why Jesus said, "Come buy of me
[52:03] gold tried in the fire. It can handle
[52:06] the fire."
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; He didn't sit there and and and and
[52:10] revile back and say, "No, you shouldn't
[52:12] do this. I, you know, don't put that
[52:14] crown of thorns on me. Don't Don't whip
[52:17] me. Uh don't chastise me. Uh don't tell
[52:20] me I I I know who's doing everything.
[52:25] Even though he was blindfolded,
[52:27] he knew everything. But he stood there
[52:30] as a lamb.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, not my will but thy will be done.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; And God wants to use you the same way.
[52:37] Jesus is our example
[52:40] &gt;&gt; to follow his example.
[52:42] Now this choice that you are making is a
[52:46] willingness when you walk in that trial
[52:48] is a willingness to die out to your
[52:51] fleshly nature that doesn't want to
[52:54] suffer only so you can manifest perfect
[52:58] love because what good does it do to be
[53:01] able to be real nice and kind when
[53:03] everything's going good
[53:06] &gt;&gt; that you know even the publicans do the
[53:08] same.
[53:11] But I'm telling you, when you are
[53:12] willing to walk in every trial for the
[53:16] purpose, I'm going to manifest Christ.
[53:18] I'm going to tell you, you're going to
[53:19] grow like gang busters.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Because the what is our natural thing to
[53:23] think about when we go into a trial? Our
[53:26] first nature is I want out of here.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Well, you want out of there. You you
[53:33] want out of character. That's why some
[53:34] people go through life trial after trial
[53:36] after trial and they have no more
[53:38] character than they did 20 years ago
[53:42] &gt;&gt; because they never walked in God's
[53:44] vision for their life. See, this is the
[53:45] thing about this message. This this is
[53:47] giving us a sight of God for our lives.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; This is God showing us how to become
[53:53] more like him
[53:55] &gt;&gt; where in the world you don't get that.
[53:57] You just, you know, you go through
[53:59] trials and you become more hard. You
[54:01] become more bitter.
[54:03] It was the same son that made uh Pharaoh
[54:06] hard soften Moses's heart.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; John 13:34 says, "I new commandment I
[54:18] give unto you, that you love one another
[54:21] as I have loved you,
[54:25] that you also love one another."
[54:30] Now,
[54:32] I'm going to be honest with you.
[54:35] If you are going to love me the way that
[54:38] Christ loves me, you're going to have to
[54:41] be dead to your flesh.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; You won't be able to put peacock
[54:48] feathers in and love me. You can't get
[54:51] warm by a painted fire.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; You can't fake it. You can't have a form
[54:56] of godliness.
[54:58] If I am going to love you
[55:02] the way that Christ loved me, then I am
[55:05] going to have to die out to my flesh.
[55:08] Now, this is the commandment that we
[55:11] love one another as Christ loved us. And
[55:14] when we can do that, I'm going to tell
[55:16] you, we're ready.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; I just I hate to say it. Brother Brandon
[55:22] said, this is how important it is. lay
[55:24] aside everything else in life
[55:28] until you can get to the place that you
[55:30] can love one another.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Even your enemy, he said
[55:38] &gt;&gt; he said that should be your priority in
[55:42] life. That is the image. We don't got
[55:45] time. I'm we don't got time to go
[55:47] through everything, but this I want to
[55:48] say the image of Christ. The Bible says
[55:50] God is love.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to know the image of God
[55:54] is love.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; And perfect love cast out all fear
[56:02] &gt;&gt; that you can have boldness on the day of
[56:03] judgment.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; This is God's vision for our life.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; This is what we've been predestined to.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; This is what we're supposed to be
[56:14] walking into.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; But we don't like we don't get in a car
[56:19] and just get there.
[56:21] What we do is we go through our daily
[56:25] trials to get there
[56:29] &gt;&gt; because it's through the trial that we
[56:32] is it it's through the day that we go
[56:33] through a trial and through that trial
[56:35] we we have a chance to get character and
[56:37] we build a little bit little bit little
[56:39] bit little bit little bit before you
[56:40] know it we can look back and we can
[56:42] overcome a lot more in our lives than we
[56:43] used to.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; And you know what that is? It's a
[56:47] perfect love for the word of God.
[56:52] It's a perfect love for the word of God
[56:53] because perfect love is I am willing to
[56:56] die out.
[56:58] For instance, if somebody if brother
[57:00] Stan I if he slapped me in the face and
[57:03] he said, "Look, I've been wanting to do
[57:05] this for about three years
[57:07] and he wales off and he hits me." I
[57:10] would probably say, "Brother Stan,
[57:13] I had that coming. Why'd you wait so
[57:15] long?
[57:22] Now, the Now, the thing is,
[57:25] the devil is going to tell me a lot of
[57:27] things.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; That's not fair.
[57:31] That wasn't right. That that Christians
[57:33] don't do that.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Remember David said when he got spit on,
[57:39] the Lord told him to.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. The devil's going to
[57:43] give you a lot of things to reason about
[57:44] that situation,
[57:47] but in reality, what God gave me is a
[57:50] gift
[57:52] to be able to go through that trial and
[57:54] love him regardless.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Now, do you think I would trade anything
[58:00] in this world for the character of God
[58:03] to be able to love those that hate me? I
[58:06] wouldn't trade it for anything. There
[58:08] ain't enough money. There ain't enough
[58:09] popularity. There ain't enough anything
[58:13] to be able to love from my heart.
[58:19] I look at trials a little bit different.
[58:23] And here's the biggest thing with a
[58:24] trial.
[58:26] When a trial comes, the first thing that
[58:28] happens in our life is fear floats.
[58:30] Fear. Fear comes.
[58:33] Oh, the what are we going to do?
[58:38] We don't have to know what we're going
[58:39] to do.
[58:40] We don't have to answer the devil's
[58:42] questions.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Alls we need to do is trust in God.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; And when you trust in God, his love
[58:51] becomes your shield.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Becomes your peace.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Becomes even your joy.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; You can have joy in the middle of your
[59:03] suffering. Yeah,
[59:06] &gt;&gt; I I would rather take this word
[59:11] and the message
[59:14] that God sent in this hour to open the
[59:16] word to me to really let me know who
[59:18] Jesus Christ is than all the things that
[59:22] anybody could ever tell me.
[59:28] God has a vision for us saints. Let's
[59:32] stand together. God has a vision for us.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; He's wanting us to walk in that vision
[59:38] today.
[59:40] Not to wait,
[59:42] but to know what it is and to walk in
[59:45] it.
[59:47] To become just like him.
[59:51] And this
[59:53] this vision is not for everybody.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Remember, there were 70 that walked
[59:58] away.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:03] I just I just want to say I I I
[1:00:07] only got literally through half of the
[1:00:10] sermon. Through half of the sermon,
[1:00:14] God I I I I trust that God will reveal
[1:00:19] this to us because if he wanted it to be
[1:00:21] different, it would be different. Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:28] Make
[1:00:30] me more
[1:00:32] like thee,
[1:00:35] Jesus.
[1:00:37] Make me more like thee.
[1:00:45] Give me a heart that's filled with love
[1:00:52] and make me more like thee.
[1:00:59] Oh, make me more like thee,
[1:01:06] Jesus.
[1:01:08] Make me more like thee.
[1:01:16] Be a heart that's filled with love and
[1:01:22] make me more like thee.
[1:01:27] [Applause]
[1:01:29] Oh, make me more. Amen. Lord, we want to
[1:01:34] be like you, Jesus.
[1:01:37] Make me more like thee.
[1:01:43] Oh, give me a heart that's filled with
[1:01:49] love and make me more like thee.
[1:01:57] [Applause]
[1:01:59] Create
[1:02:01] in me a clean
[1:02:05] heart,
[1:02:08] oh God.
[1:02:12] and renew a right spirit within me.
[1:02:22] Create in me a clean heart,
[1:02:28] oh God,
[1:02:32] and renew a right spirit within me.
[1:02:42] Cast me not away
[1:02:45] from thy presence,
[1:02:49] oh Lord,
[1:02:51] and take not thy holy spirit from thee.
[1:03:00] Restore
[1:03:02] unto me
[1:03:05] the joy of thy salvation.
[1:03:11] Come and renew a right spirit within me.
[1:03:17] [Music]
[1:03:20] Create in me a clean heart.
[1:03:26] Oh God,
[1:03:30] and renew a right spirit within me.
[1:03:39] Create in me a clean heart,
[1:03:45] oh God.
[1:03:47] [Music]
[1:03:49] I'll renew a right spirit within me.
[1:03:55] me.
[1:03:58] Cast me not away from thy presence,
[1:04:05] oh Lord,
[1:04:07] and take not thy holy spirit from me.
[1:04:16] Restore
[1:04:18] unto me
[1:04:21] the joy of thy salvation
[1:04:27] and renew a right spirit within me.
[1:04:33] Amen. As they continue to play that
[1:04:35] quietly, if we could just all bow our
[1:04:39] hearts,
[1:04:41] bow our heads if you can.
[1:04:44] Close your eyes if
[1:04:47] just want to invite you to just give
[1:04:50] this time
[1:04:52] over to God.
[1:04:56] Let him reverently
[1:05:00] speak to his children
[1:05:04] oneon-one without anyone looking.
[1:05:12] I wonder if there'd be anyone here today
[1:05:14] that would want to be remembered in
[1:05:17] prayer.
[1:05:19] Maybe there's
[1:05:22] some things that you
[1:05:24] haven't been willing to give up.
[1:05:32] Maybe there's some things that
[1:05:37] you didn't think it was that big a deal.
[1:05:43] Maybe
[1:05:46] maybe just the mere fact that
[1:05:50] getting caught up in Leodysa and having
[1:05:53] a lukewarmness of just not pressing into
[1:05:57] the fullness of his character.
[1:06:03] Maybe you're here today and you know
[1:06:06] that
[1:06:10] you ought to be pressing in more than
[1:06:11] you than you have been.
[1:06:17] Maybe you just you want to mean more
[1:06:20] business with the Lord Jesus today.
[1:06:25] Maybe you're here today. There's just
[1:06:27] something inside says, "I don't want to
[1:06:29] miss it, Lord. I want to be there.
[1:06:40] Maybe you just want to be remembered in
[1:06:42] prayer today.
[1:06:47] Believe God is here to do exceedingly
[1:06:48] above all that we could ask or think.
[1:06:53] And I could just say it like this. I
[1:06:56] know that his presence is here
[1:06:59] and he wants to give us our heart's
[1:07:01] desire.
[1:07:05] If your heart's desire is that expected
[1:07:08] end that he has for you, I want you to
[1:07:11] believe with all your heart as we go to
[1:07:14] him in prayer. Just believe. Believe.
[1:07:18] For Jesus said, "Only believe. All
[1:07:21] things are possible."
[1:07:24] Lord, we come to you
[1:07:27] this day knowing that the gates of hell
[1:07:31] are trying to prevail against us.
[1:07:35] That every demon of doubt
[1:07:38] and discouragement
[1:07:40] and dismay is fighting against your
[1:07:44] bride.
[1:07:47] is trying to
[1:07:49] get us from
[1:07:52] taking all that you have
[1:07:56] given us, Lord,
[1:07:59] your word as a as a shield
[1:08:05] for of our protection to keep us from
[1:08:08] all the tactics of the enemy. And you've
[1:08:10] told us to put on the whole armor of
[1:08:12] God.
[1:08:14] today. Lord, we thank thee that you've
[1:08:17] given us thy word.
[1:08:19] Thy words our spirit and their life.
[1:08:24] And God, we embrace your word today. We
[1:08:27] embrace your word. We embrace the vision
[1:08:31] that you have for our lives, Lord.
[1:08:35] God, you see our our hearts, Lord. You
[1:08:39] saw our hands. You saw the hands lifted
[1:08:42] in our heart. just see the the sincerity
[1:08:44] and the the realness, Lord, that
[1:08:48] that there is inside of us, God. And
[1:08:51] Father, we pray that you would take each
[1:08:53] one of our situations, each one of our
[1:08:55] desires,
[1:08:57] each one of our prayers, each one of our
[1:09:00] our cares, and we're casting them upon
[1:09:03] you today, knowing that you care for us.
[1:09:06] Lord,
[1:09:08] you told us, Lord, to that you would
[1:09:12] bear
[1:09:13] you'd bear our burden, Lord.
[1:09:17] Lord, we thank you, Lord Jesus. You just
[1:09:20] told us to take your yoke and put it
[1:09:24] upon us. And Lord, we willingly take
[1:09:27] this yoke and put it upon us, Lord.
[1:09:30] Lord, whatever you would have us to do,
[1:09:32] whatever pain it may cause, Lord, we
[1:09:36] know that you are leading us by your
[1:09:38] spirit to the expected end, Lord, into
[1:09:42] all truth. The truth, Lord, that you are
[1:09:46] you're the God of not just love, but you
[1:09:49] are love. And Lord, that we are going to
[1:09:52] be in your image, and we're going to
[1:09:54] love just like you love. for you. Said,
[1:09:57] "By this shall all men know that that
[1:09:59] you're my disciples when you have the
[1:10:02] same love one for another that I've had
[1:10:04] for you, God. We embrace it today. We
[1:10:08] accept it today, oh God, and we trust
[1:10:11] you, Lord, for these
[1:10:14] uh these things that we've laid at your
[1:10:16] feet at the altar today, Lord. We
[1:10:20] believe that you are going to bring to
[1:10:23] pass, Lord, for our lives. Such a
[1:10:26] victory, God. A victory. This is your
[1:10:30] victory
[1:10:32] that overcometh the world, even your
[1:10:34] faith. And we're trusting in you, Lord,
[1:10:37] over this victory, over this worldly
[1:10:40] nature that has tried to keep us down
[1:10:42] and keep us from fighting the good fight
[1:10:44] of faith. and and some of us were just
[1:10:47] laying hold of eternal life and and
[1:10:49] pressing in the way we should, Lord. But
[1:10:51] today, God, we're just believing in you
[1:10:55] today to bring us up. Bring us closer
[1:10:58] and we're we're trusting you for it
[1:11:00] today, Lord. We love you. We love you.
[1:11:03] We love you with all of our heart. We
[1:11:05] give you the praise. We give you the
[1:11:06] honor, Lord. Bless your bride. Bless
[1:11:10] your people. Bless them. I pray in the
[1:11:12] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We thank
[1:11:15] you. We thank you now for it, Lord.
