each that are here today uh we're going to kind of get deep into the word today so um um I think it's a good good amount of people for this for this message today amen I wonder if we could just go to the Lord in prayer ask His blessings on the word and we got a request that came in from Brother Alex mulus his um wife uh sister Maria was just admitted to the hospital for some internal bleeding we're not sure what it is but I I let's just unite together our faith for our sister amen our heavenly father Lord we come to you Lord as your word declares God we're lifting up your servant's wife Lord uh who's in uh a desperate need Lord with this internal bleeding God we just ask that your hand would be upon her father that you your wisdom and direction would be with the doctors and father we just pray Lord that you'd bring this to a stop and that Lord you would touch her this very moment Lord hear the prayers of your people Lord that are going Lord around the world Lord lifting her up father we commit her into your hands for her safekeeping now Lord as we uh come before you Lord before we open the Word of Life today God we're asking for the anointing of the Holy Spirit to be upon all of us here today upon Lord those that would be watching in the live stream perhaps those that would be looking in the archives down the road father we just pray that you would Quicken this word to us and Lord that you would close out the enemy from any thought that he would try to bring in Lord that would try to uh bring any confusion at all but Lord may we all have an assurance of your word father for we're depending upon you as only you can break the bread of life we ask that you break it now to us we give you the praise for all these things we pray pray now in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen I believe the bride says amen amen amen turn with me if you would to First Peter chapter 1 we got three scripture readings first Peter Ephesians and then second Peter amen we're going to be talking about uh election and being Chosen and predestination so our first scripture here in 1 Peter chapter 1 starting with verse number one and two Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to The Strangers that are scattered throughout the world amen amen elect they're elect according to the for knowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied Ephesians chapter 1 starting with verse number three Ephesians chapter 1 starting with verse number three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that's righten that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of the children by Jesus Christ to him according to the good pleasure of his will I'm just going to drop down to verse 11 and 12 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and then in second Peter chapter 1 verses 9 and 10 2 Peter chapter 1: 9 and 10 wherefore or verse 9 but he that lackthe things what things is he talking about talking about growing in the virtues of Christ he that's lacking and growing in the virtues of Christ is blind and cannot see a far off and is forgotten that he was purged from his own sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall that's right amen God bless you may be seated we're going to toss uh some big words around tonight for knowledge election which actually just means chosen you could use that and predestination first I want to talk about is for knowledge that means for thought it's only mentioned two times in in the Bible amen we know that God is omniscient which means all knowing amen God is aware of the past the present and the future amen all at the same time amen God doesn't have an experience today that helps him to make a better decision tomorrow like you and I we go through experiences and we learn and we say oh I wish I would have known that if I had the wisdom that I had now when I was younger I would have better children and you know I'd make better decisions in life well nothing takes God by surprise God knows everything right God is aware of the past the Bible says we're all going to stand before the Judgment seat of Christ to give an account so he's he's got to know the past if that's going to be true he said he's coming quickly as rewards with him to give every man according to his W his work so he's got to remember our past the Bible says God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love God is aware of the past God is aware of the present the Bible tells us that he's a present help in a time of trouble amen the Bible says that neither there is any creature that is not made that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with with whom we have to do right amen he knows the present thoughts that we're thinking right now amen he knows the very numbers of our head right this moment and every time we use a brush and a comb what happens when we take a shower what happens I mean we're losing hair so God has a constant he knows amen he knows presently everything God is also a A Ware of our future the Bible says he's the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last and that's why he could speak things in the beginning and we read them in the book and they're called prophecy the Bible from what I understand there's over 2,000 prophecies in the Bible amen now God could write these because he knew the future before it would happen like a virgin shall conceive 800 years before it happened It Was Written many years before it happened or the seed of the woman shall bruise the seed of the serpent maybe 4,000 years before it happened not one time has it ever failed amen the Bible says that Christ was crucified before the foundation of the world so in his thoughts God knew this is very hard for us to to understand this because we live in a present time in the only thing that we have is a memory of the past we could read history books and learn about things in the past but God as we're experiencing this right now and there's not you know any any people sitting here there's no people sitting there there's people sitting here we can experience this right now but God is someone who knows all that at any given moment at at any given time in in in life so we're talking about the foreign knowledge of God we're trying to bring this Foundation because of God's foreign knowledge he knew who would be sitting here in today's service before there was ever a world Amen but he did not make that choice for you he did not make the choice for you to be sitting here you made that choice Amen brother brandham said in the message where I think Pentecost failed he said predestination is not a very good word for the Evangelist or a minister to use but it's kind of confuses the people when you say predestinate in other words God didn't say he's trying to remove some confusion right now God didn't say now I'll make this this man be this and I'll make this man be that but in order to be God he had to know the end from the beginning so by Foreign knowledge he knew he could say this would happen or that would happen right because he was God and he known where everything would be placed amen therefore he could ordain certain things for certain ages so of course we probably knew where Brother Bruce and sister Donna would be sitting because they're always sitting there right but maybe not brother Tyler I'll just say it lat God knew where we'd all be sitting amen and he knew it way before we got here God's for knowledge is awesome amen it's awesome the he knows what we're going through that's why we never have to tell him what we're going through just seek first the kingdom everything's going to be added he knows what we're going through he knows all of our heartaches now just like God did not force us to be here he did not force us to be saved amen right the Bible says we are saved by faith not by force just as God did not force us to be here he did not choose us to be here do you understand if it was about God's choosing then everybody would be saved amen first Titus 2:4 says it was God's if it is it is it is God's will that all men would be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth that's right now if God did the choosing that's what he would choose amen God has given Every Man a free will and he respects that free will he gave it to every man think about Lucifer had a free will he gave it to him he let he still got it God respects Free Will that's why God is not a manipulator and people who manipulate are not being led by the Holy Ghost never never never never never so by God's forign knowledge he knew what choices you would make amen he knew who you would marry before you married them he knew what decision you would choose when God offered eternal life to you God God did not choose those things for us we made those choices so do we understand that as we're moving forward am now on the base of his of his forn knowledge of him knowing everything the decisions that we would make he could elect you or choose you you see the difference because he knew what choice you were going to make and look every seed brings forth of its own kind right and an apple seed never brought forth an orange a seed of God will always bring forth the seed of God Amen a h bread will never bring forth the seed of God Amen so because by his foreign knowledge of him knowing him seeing your love for him him seeing your choice for him him seeing all that he could choose you or elect you are you with me amen Ephesians 1 says God chose us or elected Us in him before the foundation of the world Amen so the his choosing is for us to be in him not have our own separate life not do our own thing not just say we belong to God and live whatever kind of life we want he chose us in him of course if we're a seed of God we will bring forth God we've heard if you were a Son of God if you are a son of God you always were a Son of God right so if you're a seed of God you will bring forth God because every seed brings forth of its own kind now we're just kind of lay this Long Foundation you know that's important John 15:16 because we want to be able to understand the scriptures the scriptures do not cross the scriptures right they duvail John 15:16 says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that word chosen means selected before you chose to serve God God chose you now he didn't make the choice for you but he chose you are you with me okay when we the Bible says when we were dead in sins and trespasses we were still chosen of God right Ephesians 2 we walked according to the course of this world we can all put our sself in it we had our conversation in the past the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others amen when we were in the world you couldn't tell us apart from anybody else in the world but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us doesn't the bible say that he didn't choose us because we were great we were more in number there was something special about us he chose us because he loved us amen he put that great love upon us see there's a lot of people that we love or that God loves and they don't choose to love God back because there's something missing inside of them amen there's just something missing sure they'll they'll be loved as long as you want to love them but there's something in them that is strictly living their lives fors their nature is is self-centered but God sees inside of us this desire to manifest Christ amen to not live for self there's a love that we have we want to give our all to God are you with me so we did not choose God God chose us amen let's take a look at Saul or Paul before he was Paul he was Saul he was a murderer he persecuted the Church of the Living God yet before his conversion God said that he is a chosen vessel unto me Amen to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of Israel he was chosen of God and he didn't even know it amen he didn't even know God he was actually fighting against God and the proof that he was chosen of God was manifested when he accepted the light when it was brought to him yes when Jesus shined before him knocked him off his horse and and and and spoke to him he didn't run away he didn't continue to do what he did what he was doing but he turned around he turned his life around he repented what would thou have me to do Lord amen that was the manifestation that he was chosen right come on now this ought to be super duper encouraging really really should be because you know we all want some some sort of something real Supernatural to happen in our life to to give us that assurance that we're Chosen and you don't want to do that you don't want to do that now the proof that we're chosen is not because we feel we're chosen or that we're going to church or that were're in the message or that we accepted the prophet Paul did not walk in just part of the light he just didn't say Okay God I'm sorry I won't persecute your church no more and I'll start you know being a Believer I'll hang out with the disciples and that that's all you heard of them he continued to walk in the light amen as God gave him more light he walked in it amen every day God told him to go do something he'd go do it that is the proof that you are called that you're called you're chosen you're elected amen too many people stop and yet they still feel they're called they're elected and and and the Bible tells us that we have to make our calling and election sure Paul or Peter told us to do that and if Peter said to do that then I think we should do that now for the genuine believer there's a real Security in being chosen or predestinated but for the person who is not making sure who's not being diligent about it it's a false sense of security you know this message teaches you that you're chosen be because you're in the message and God called you out of denomination how many people have come out of denomination came into the message and then left God it's not the evidence that you're chosen it's a good start but look every time God comes and he brings us new truth we've got to walk in that truth there's the evidence you know brother braham's you always talking about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and speak not speaking in tongues and this and that and uh you know putting your name on the book and I belong to this church and I burn candles and so many different things but he taught us the truth evidence is when you receive all the word amen not just say mentally I believe it that the Bible is true but that our our life manifest what the word is saying so that's a huge responsibility but by God's forn knowledge he chose us he elected us that's why the Bible says who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect he chose us he set his love on us if God be for us who can be against us right so by God's for knowledge he could elect us or he could choose us and because we're chosen because we're elected he can predestinate us so it starts with forn knowledge he chooses and then he predestines us to a destiny now what's the destiny we've been predestinated to be conformed to the image of the son of of God Amen the end result is we're going to be just like him when he appears now we're not going to get there by just sitting in church just belonging to a message church just saying that uh I I believe the M are even listening to the tapes we've got to become what the word says we're going to become and we've got to become Miss Jesus just have to be amen God can predestinate or if I could say it like this predetermine certain things to happen now in your life amen these things are going to happen just like he did the thousands and thousands of things in the Bible he spoke them before they happen and he can do the same in our lives because it's no different right Romans 8:28 says we know that all things work together for the good to a certain group of people that's right it's them that love God remember brother R says you love God he says make sure that make sure that's it's the most important thing to love God to the degree to the degree that he loves us with right he told us to love one another just as he loved us that's right right amen okay so all things work together for the good to them that love God to them now he describes this group who loves God to them who are the called according to his purpose in other words um I love you this much I love you brother bman I love you this much I love you that I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine I'll do this for you if you do that for me now that's the love that we were born with amen and when we don't get what we want we got a lot of enemies because that's the purpose of our calling our first birth was selfish you you climb on one another to get to the top you manipulate things you manipulate situ ations but our calling from God is according to his purpose so when we love God to the place that our whole life is for his purpose then this is the group we're talking about right here see many are called but few are chosen for whom he did for know he also did predestinate so for knowledge to predestination to be conformed to the image of the his son that we that he would be the firstborn among many Brethren now like I we have seven children when we just had our first child we had no idea that there was going to be six more we just didn't nobody told us but pretty soon abig had sisters and brothers and God by his forn knowledge could look and said that there's going to be many just like Jesus amen he could for from the beginning he could he could see that moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called he's all he he also Justified them right and then that he justified he's already glorified it's a done deal for the True Believer amen the one that truly has fallen so in love with God has given their life to Jesus Christ amen I think we need to be very careful about our personal views about predestination election what I mean by that it's one thing to mentally believe that we're Chosen and it's another thing to be sure of it amen we can start off with Christ and be on the right track and later become unfruitful not continuing that hunger and that thirst and you know how it was when we first got saved listening the tapes Lord use me I want to be more like you you just digging into the word well most people that come to Christ that is the beginning of their experience but do they stay on that track now I I'm I'm saying we all go through valleys okay we all go through valleys but we just don't I'm just going to stay here and it's okay I'm still chosen that that's that's the wrong Spirit I'm telling you amen look at the the children of Israel they they they came out of Egypt with a great Victory but they never labor bered to enter the promised land they we too scared a lot of people are too scared to to give their life to Jesus Christ to be honest with you they don't got time they got other Ambitions they want to do other things they're they're just satisfied in this complacency of lukewarmness of just being a good Christian good church member and they they never go on to get the full manifestation of Jesus Christ they don't even pursue it like they they ought to be second Peter's I know it's awful quiet that's I know it's a sobering thought but it's a true one it's a true one we're stuck in leod deia Leo deia is here amen there's a lot of people that are lukewarm they're not hot they're not cold that's how Jesus identified them amen and it's a spirit we're not the Church of Leia we're we're we're in the age where Leo deia is and that Spirit filters in our homes it filters in in the in our our radio it's everywhere it comes into our mind and if we listen to it then we will become more lukewarm so we've got to we got to fight that thing second Peter verse chapter 1 verse 5 says and besides this give all diligence not some but give all diligence add to your faith virtue your virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness and godly kindness uh and godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity so if you were going to start a new job and they said uh um you're going to have to learn these rules I'm going to give you these rules and you're going to have to learn them before you start and you're going to be tested as soon as you came in you know you couldn't start working until you passed the test amen now to me God has given us what we need to do amen if we're done with one thing we should be adding another we should be working on the virtues of Christ the character of Jesus Christ is not just some nice words this is a personal Love Letter to who the elected that's who it's to for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind he cannot see a far off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins I'm not saying he forgot Calvary he forgot how real Calvary was to him understand the difference he didn't forget Calvary he forgot what Calvary once meant to him amen wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if you do if you do give diligence to make your call election sure you shall never fall but if you just oh yeah I'm predestinated I'm in I just know it give diligence to make your calling an election what does that mean it means keep adding like crazy get in love with Jesus that you want to become more like him that's what it means let's take a look at Judas turn with me to John chapter 6 are you getting something out of this message all right I want to take a look at Judas for a moment and I want to start with verse number 60 many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it you ever been to church here to Harvard say and said man I I I can't hear that right all right this is kind of where they were when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured he said unto them does this offend you what and if you shall see the son of man Ascend up to where he was before it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh can't profit us anything the words that I speak Jesus said unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that don't believe it for Jesus knew from the beginning who it was who they were that believe not and who should betray him so here's the you know Jesus got this for knowledge because he's the word amen he's the one that created everything so he he knows who is and who isn't am and the word always separates right does the separating and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him in other words they left church yes they went and found somebody else who believed like they believed amen sad then said Jesus unto the 12 not to the 11 but to the 12 will ye also go away this then Simon Peter answered himl to whom shall we go thou has has the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered them what a a tremendous thing to say he he could have almost just said amen but he said have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil that's right he chose a devil he elected a devil and he spake of Judas es scariot the son of Simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the 12 yes so he chose or elected a devil so that's why I say like this it's not good enough to say that we're chos or we elected we we don't want to just stay there that is not a good evidence he chose all 12 and one was a devil if I could say this chosen for a different purpose because this message I I I didn't at the beginning I just I threw it a title out there chosen for a purpose he was chosen for for a different purpose still chosen but for a different purpose he was a devil now that word devil means a transducer if you look it up now that means one who attacks the reputation of another by slander or labels them or backbiting one who belittles the worth of something or someone of course he belittled the worth of Jesus only thinking he was worth 30 pieces of silver now this same word devil the meaning of this word devil is used in 2 Timothy chapter 3 under false accusers in the last day there shall be false accusers chosen of God for a purpose amen the said the message questions and answers number three he says now watch that pattern I'm taking a lot of time but look Judas es scariot followed those same tracks he was justified by Believing on the Lord Jesus and then accepting him as his personal savior he was Sanctified and give power to cast out spirits put his name on The Book of Life but when it come to Pentecost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost the fullness of the word he showed his colors that's exactly what the Canaan spies did and that's exactly what Esau did so this is if I'm understanding correctly Judas should have never said I I believe on the Lord Jesus I accept him as my personal savior I I I I'm I'm Sanctified I've got power to cast out Devils he shouldn't looked at that as to know that he's chosen by God but he should have he should have been diligent in making sure that his calling and election was really sure are you with me by continuing to walk in the truth but he didn't he went his selfish way for himself at the end of the ministry are you with me the present stage of my Ministry brother B says you think Judas known he was playing the part of Judas it's question he says you you think Pharaoh known he was playing the part when God raised him up for that purpose you think Esau would have done the things that he did certainly not said they got eyes and they can't see they got ears and they can't hear but watch the scripture just unfolding see we're at the end time it's got to be this way and it you know as you read in the these little incidences about Judas it seems like he really didn't know and you know we look at him now we say oh yeah he was a devil but you know he was probably one of the best best Brothers in the church he he took care of the offering right he was the one that that spoke up I think and and said well why are we wasting this oil you know we could have sold it and and and and gave the money to the poor I mean he he was at one time uh rooting for for the for for the Church of Jesus Christ but he didn't make his calling in his election sure and I think there's going to be a lot of people in this age that just too lazy to do that I I don't mean it wrong but look there's nothing that we can do to make the unelect elected not a thing I don't care how the word is preached I don't care what is said and there's nothing that can be done to make those that are truly elected of God to not make it the foundation of God standing the sure God knoweth them that are H there is it's going to happen but I'm when we preach of course we're preaching that everybody's elect everybody amen but the thing is only the they're going to catch it if our gospel be hid is hid to them that are lost in whom the God of this world have blinded the minds of who them which believe not see the choice that we make I'm going to love this word I'm going to put this word first in my life or you know I'm just going to be the best you know church member I can be Luke 22 verse1 now I we got just a little little bit time we can talk about a little bit more about Judas all right say Amen so I can like continue going now the Feast of unleavened bread Luke 221 now the Feast of unleavened bread Drew nigh which is called the Passover and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill Judas oh I'm sorry how they might kill Jesus for they feared the people then look at this then then then then then entered Satan into Judas right surname a scariot be being of the number of the 12 see we can't look at a person today and just say oh because of where they're at today we don't want to label people we want to follow we want to if I could say like this we want to follow one another as you're following Christ right as long as we're following Christ the person that you're you're talking to the person you're hanging out with if they're following Christ with all their heart I say you know praise the Lord but you need to be very diligent if they're leading you to a slack it's okay if you don't in a need of nothing I'm I'm just fine you got to get away from that thing right the the Bible says um is them having a form of godliness but denying the power of what's the what's the next verse say huh from such turn away that's us not somebody making us do it not it's our choice we we've got to turn away from it all right let's drop down to John Chapter 13 now this just so you know skipping a lot of notes Here John 13 I wish I had probably two services on this subject just in this chapter verse one now behold the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour has come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own that were in the world he loved them unto the end now that's what we need to do right there love God to the end and supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of judas's scariot Simon's son to betray him amen so when we think of Judas he he wasn't thinking anything like this when he was walking with Jesus right nothing amen this all got concocted at the End Amen and what I love about this chapter he has communion with his chosen disciples he even gets down and washes the feet of Judas right amen and what he's doing he's proving that his love for Judas is greater yes that he could actually love I believe I don't mean this wrong God loves loves how do I say this word God could have eliminated Lucifer just like that but he didn't he allowed him to go on Amen the Bible says that Jesus knew from the beginning about Judas amen still chose him but he let him go on and God still loved Judas yeah and when he was betrayed he said why do you betray me with a kiss he called him a friend yes amen he truly loved him I want to tell you here what Psalms 41:9 says he says yay my old familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat of my bread and have lifted up his heel against me you know God loves us and he trusts us amen now we've got to love him back and trust him that what that word is telling us to do we're just going to do it we're going to be fightful we're going to get more of God in our life we're going to get God in our homes we're going to see him move like he hasn't moved before we're not going to wait for something to happen and say okay yeah I better get serious today is the day today is the day we got to hear the voice of God not the voice of John the voice of God Amen and we if we had time Matthew 27: 9 and 10 they talk about where Jes the God could foretell what was going to happen with Judas and even though look at this I I just I just I I need to read this because this this is the fear of God for me Judas 27:3 then Judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he had con that he was condemned he repented himself and brought again the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders saying I have sinned in that I betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is it to us see thou to that that's none of my doing and he cast down the the the pieces of silver in the temple and he departed and he went and hanged himself so before he died he realized that he did wrong see Satan I hate Satan I hate him the deception that he doesn't tell you the whole story before he wants you to go do something it's a lot of times when you're mad at somebody because they did something wrong the only thing that you can see is how wrong they are by how they're acting how they're yelling whatever is going on right amen and because you're staring at that you feel you have a right to to to to to to put them in their place but then afterwards I got to say sorry too and he doesn't show you that because he's trying to get you to to step into that all right Romans chapter n oh my my my are you going to bear with me a few more extra minutes tonight Romans chapter 9 I just showing God's for knowledge verse 10 and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth that's right it was said said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated amen now I I'll just say it like this Jacob was willing to do anything to get born again amen and Esau did not care enough about being born again I just that's just the facts and because of the attitude God saw that Jacob had a love for him and that love is what made God love him more and there was that Bond there that nothing could separate them but now Esau he got separated from the love of God because he chose to love the things that were pleasing to his flesh come on this is just this is word I I know I'm not an evangelist but this is the word and we got to understand our our attitude about the New Birth it's really important yes and we can say yes I'm born again because I did this and I did that look Judas was justified Sanctified was able to cast out Devils but he was still missing and we got to keep pressing on until we get the full complete New Birth amen don't let the devil try to talk you out of that that's right now if we're chosen of God then we're chosen for a purpose to fulfill his will amen not ours when we come to Christ we had our own will when we we come to God now we're doing his will right we're born by the will of God to do the will of God all things become God are you with me amen all right you know the scriptures I'm just going back to our beginning Now 1 Peter chapter 1 verse two our opening scripture we're elect according to the for knowledge of God the Father through a process of sanctification so we have to go through a process of sanctification God has to clean up our life we have to get rid of things that are there amen through the sanctification of the spirit unto a place that we become completely obedient to God that's right it's this is God foresees that this is what's going to happen to his elect and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ we can't make it without the blood we just can't all right Ephesians chapter 1 so he chose us before the foundation of the world that we verse four should be holy and Without Blame before him in love right wow that now honestly if you're going to really take that verse that puts us all Lord I need to be doing better it really does to be holy Without Blame before him in love I love you Lord I love you so much that I want to be what you want me to be having predestinated us to the full complete birth that we're children of Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure of his will now we start doing the things he wants us to do it's no longer well I don't know um I I just don't got time right now oh my Lord how long are we going to say that verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works out all things after the counsel of his own will amen that we should be to the praise of his glory now number one it doesn't matter if I go in or I don't go in guarantee God God is going to work out everything according to his will it may not be in my life but God's will will be done amen I I don't know is is is is our country going to be the only one blown up or is there going to be other countries I have no idea but I know that God is going to achieve his will right and it has nothing to do with me understand that now if I choose if I say I'm I'm a part of God well then now it has everything to do with me and I must come under subjection to the good pleasure of his will I must do the will he wants me to do I can't I can't be out of the will of God and just say I'm chosen I'm elected I'm predestinated yeah I'm part of the message yeah I'm you know just going down the road just kind of whistling in the graveyard can't do that you got to look at your life and just you got to examine we've got Saints we just got to I know this is the hardest thing to do but we're we're we're we're talking about a Rapture right it's it's it's nothing we you know we know you know nobody's going to come here and preach Leo DEA to us right but the devil preaches it all day long right right he just comes in our thoughts and he he speaks to us but we are not going to listen to that amen amen amen all right let's turn to claan chapter 3 Colossians 3 verse number 12 Judas fell he did not he lost the fear of Jesus at one time he wanted to please him and he lost that he got off hold of a spirit that didn't need Jesus Anymore didn't need the word anymore he didn't keep making sure that he was where Christ wanted him to be because all the time Jesus would say this go here go do this go do that this is where we're going this is going to happen and he got to a point where he didn't need to get that involved with the church anymore he didn't need to get that involved with Jesus he kind of was on the background in fact he was going to use Jesus for his own self purposes right amen he didn't make his calling an election sure but this I say to you as the elect of God Colossians 3:12 put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved vows of mercy and kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another forgiving one another If any man ever quel against e any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye that's a lot of things to do don't you think right there the elect has to you know it it takes a bigger man to live the life it doesn't take that big of a man to look at somebody as a Christian and say well you're a Christian you should you have to forgive me it doesn't take a big man to do that it takes a big man to actually forgive him when the man is acting like that so this is a a a big thing but this is what the elect are doing they're doing this and above all these things put on the love of God right which is the bond of perfectness amen and let the peace of God ruin your hearts to which also you are called into one body and be ye thankful let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever you do in word whatsoever you do in deed amen do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him amen and the scripture just keeps going wives submit yourselves to your own husband as it is fit in the Lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter to them children obey your parents in all things fathers provoke not your children to anger servants obey your all obeying all things your master see so we've got scriptures of what the elect do in every position whether a child whether they're a spouse whether they're an employee whatever they are they they have a position to hold as the elect of God right yes brother brandham said in the message Shalom he says Lord take me Lord God don't never let me get my my mind like Judas upon an extra dollar upon some fashion of the world or somebody to Pat you on the back and say oh brother Brandon this is no no God never let that happen to me amen I'll just take the way with the Lord's despise you am I'll be a brother to the man do everything that I can Lord to love people with all my heart but Lord never let me move from this word amen I want to raise up at the last day love when you love Jesus you love the word right amen amen right amen now I'm going to be closing with this I just want to say a couple things here we know that Jesus had his name on The Book of Life but it was blotted out he was chose for a different purpose and the Bible says Jesus said that in the last days the two Spirits would be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it were possible can you say Amen to the word amen amen now there is a mimicking going on not so much of people but of spirits and people there's those that are confident and there's those that are overconfident right there's those that are are walking in most of the truth and those that are walking in all the truth are you with me these Spirits are so close now one Spirit the religious hoty spirit of leoda is constantly saying the spirit is saying not the people but their spirit is saying I am in need of nothing now the other spirit it's a humble spirit it's I believe it's the spirit of the bride and they're saying not that I have already attained or already apprehended but I'm pressing towards the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus I'm am pressing towards what my predestination I'm I'm pressing towards my predestination what I've been predestinated to to be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ amen now notice in John or Revelations the last book of the Bible this is my last scripture and then we're done the the bride never says that she's ready I want us to catch this the bride never said she was ready I I I think we should we we should we should cling to this thing because uh Leo deia says I'm in need of nothing right but the bride doesn't say that Revelations 196 John heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty Thunder saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reign Amen Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife have made herself ready there is a group that is pressing towards that image amen now it's not so much naturally I got to have my hair just perfect my dress just perfect my my speech just perfect but there's a real concern of their character a real concern of their virtues that they're really trying to add more of Christ in their life they're not sitting in a leod DEA just you know going from week to week to church and and just you know once in a while trying to get into Christ no there's a real pressing in because we have to get ready right and to her was granted that she should be ar raay in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage of the supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true says of God Amen let's Stand Together the bride of Christ keeps receiving the word and she keeps manifesting the word and she'll keep doing that till Jesus comes and that's what it means to do everything you can to make yourself ready amen you can't look at a preacher what the last thing you you want to do is look at a somebody that you have confidence in and just say you know uh they say looking for someone to say yes you're living such a a good life you're the bride don't you don't want that what you want to do is you want to look at the word every time you read it and if the word says this is what I want you to do and you start doing it that's a greater evidence am that is the evidence that you're looking for if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence towards God if if if they they convict us then we start doing it and then we got confidence towards God see we walk in the confidence of the word amen amen let's let's go to the Lord in prayer our heavenly father we thank you for Thy Thy truth Lord Thy word and father I pray for the elect of God lord wherever they're at in their their walk with you I pray that this word that they have heard would become a more real in their lives Lord that they could take it and walk in it to to Really spend that time with you in prayer just loving you thanking you for calling them bringing them out of the world and bringing them into the truth of this message Lord but we know that not all that are in the message are going to go not all that say Lord Lord not all that feel they're called and chosen and predestinated and God we're not asking that you you would give us as it were that Blessed Assurance we're not asking for that but what we are asking for is that you'd give us such a hunger to want to make sure that we're pleasing you in every way that we can that Lord we could take Serious that we that we're we're doing the things that you've called us to do in your word that we that we're not having to be told at church but that we could go home and read our Bibles listen to the tapes and just say God what would you have me to do and and Lord may your bride just walk in those things that you show them amen and I pray as they walk in them that you would give them Blessed Assurance confidence Lord that that they're walking in all the light that they know to walk in and father I do pray if there be any anyone anyone Lord that's has gotten out of line that's been as it were sitting in the back seat in and and digging into the virtues of Christ and seeking to have more of your character spending more time with you maybe some have just lost their their their their longing that drive and maybe just kind of set things to many things on the Shelf oh God I pray that you would prick their hearts as the prophet taught us to preach our conscience we pray I pray for the bride here Lord that you would touch them that you would speak to them and that you'd let them to know what you would have them to do Lord because the hour is late the the the the your word says it's high time that we wake out of our sleep oh God I just pray for every member every member of the Bride of Jesus Christ Lord that's in this local body here God they're in just different different different places in their walk with you and I pray for the most important one that they'd be walking so in love with you and Desiring to please you more more than ever before God that you'd help us that are battling spirits of lukewarmness things have perhaps crept into our lives oh God I pray that you would meet us in the prayer closet Lord that you would renew our strength oh God you said if they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength our strength comes from you Lord we need you father we can't make it without you we will all be crying Grace Grace Grace Lord come and strengthen us your your bride encourage us your bride to keep pressing on with all of our hearts Lord we love you we commit oursel to you I
