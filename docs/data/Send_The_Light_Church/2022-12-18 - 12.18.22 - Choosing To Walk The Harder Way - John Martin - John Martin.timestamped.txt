[19:37] a one to two minute testimony I'm going
[19:39] to come up here brethren
[19:41] let's give us a little testimony
[19:47] God bless the church
[19:50] my name is Brother Joseph
[19:52] I come for Congo I speak very very
[19:54] French I don't know if someone here can
[19:56] hear or speak French
[19:59] yeah uh I come here in USA to study
[20:02] English and to continue my major with
[20:04] computer science
[20:06] I was talking with Pastor uh brother Tim
[20:11] and he connects me with brother of uh
[20:17] oh no
[20:20] Brother LA Forten and Brother 14 connect
[20:23] me with sister Anna
[20:25] and stack Anna connect me with the
[20:27] pastor I was about to come here during
[20:29] summer
[20:31] but something in me tell me on our
[20:33] remain in Boston coaching to start your
[20:35] English class
[20:36] and serve God there
[20:39] but this was not the will of God the
[20:41] will of God was to me to come here and
[20:43] to to be here among other people of God
[20:46] and I take the permissive will because I
[20:49] pray God God let me remain here in
[20:52] Boston and Jesus was the premise of will
[20:53] it was not a perfect will of God and
[20:56] brother Branham tell us to follow just
[20:58] the perfect will of God don't look for
[21:01] the permissive will because when you
[21:03] live in permissive will be so in the
[21:05] Bible those King asked for God to give
[21:08] him more time and this time he did it
[21:11] all of bad things than to worship God
[21:14] and me also I was struggling I was
[21:17] looking the face of God and I was not
[21:19] seen God in my day in my project in my
[21:22] life but I was asking every time God
[21:25] what thing I do what mistake I'm doing
[21:27] but just I was not following the step
[21:30] who called are leading me
[21:33] and when I decided to come here the evil
[21:36] does it like he starts making the
[21:38] mistake in my mind
[21:40] to feel like I'm Gonna Be Lonely in
[21:43] Michigan are gonna miss my family who is
[21:46] here my sister she's married in Boston
[21:48] and I'm gonna miss the friends who I
[21:50] make in the church but I say
[21:54] evil I'm going to visit Michigan and God
[21:57] gonna provide all of him I need I need
[21:59] friends gonna give me friends I need
[22:01] family God's gonna give me the family
[22:03] and the church gonna God gonna give me
[22:05] the church
[22:06] I took the airplane I reached Michigan I
[22:09] tell pastor Martin I'm coming he said
[22:12] okay you are welcome in Michigan I was
[22:15] praying in my room close to a university
[22:19] and Pastor tell me brother Mark are
[22:22] coming to visit you I didn't know
[22:24] brother Mark but when I reached him I
[22:28] feel something in him and do you think I
[22:31] feel in him is the same thing is in me
[22:33] and I feel is my brother we start
[22:36] Fellowship about the world during worlds
[22:39] we come we come in his house we pray we
[22:43] speak about the Bible he was preaching
[22:45] about Jesus about how our identification
[22:48] must be Jesus we must show the image of
[22:53] Jesus in all of place we are going and
[22:56] he was preaching me I say brother God
[22:58] bless you because you will speak about
[23:01] me we must Show Jesus it was we must be
[23:05] the example of Jesus in all of our
[23:08] routine and I tell him it's not just to
[23:11] believe the message it's not just to
[23:13] walk around to say I'm born in the
[23:15] message it's not just to say I am a
[23:18] preacher but he is to become the message
[23:20] to become the life of message when
[23:23] someone asks you in the road in the job
[23:26] in the school he must see Jesus in your
[23:30] life and you must be the testimony of
[23:32] Jesus in this life and I worship God to
[23:36] put this friend this brother in my road
[23:38] and to reach this family and I call now
[23:41] my family

[23:49] all of place in the world we are we are
[23:51] one we have just one faithful one Lord
[23:53] and one baptism when we are one Accord
[23:56] in one Spirit God is present and God is
[23:59] there I truly believe God is here

[24:05] feel his presence I was praying in a

[35:50] good for us it's encouraging to get good

[36:01] um your support is

[37:23] starting with verse uh 24
[37:28] um and before we be read this if we
[37:30] could just look to the Lord in a word of
[37:33] prayer our heavenly father we thank you
[37:36] for your precious word and so many
[37:39] things can be gained uh in in every page
[37:43] of the Bible a reverse of the Bible
[37:46] and Lord we're wanting what you have for
[37:51] us today and it may not be what uh we
[37:56] were thinking about when we woke up
[37:58] today or perhaps even what we were
[38:02] praying about this week
[38:04] because we all have so many various
[38:07] needs and desires and directions for our
[38:11] life
[38:12] but Lord I believe that contained in the
[38:15] scriptures today and in the message
[38:17] today that you are here for your people
[38:19] to lead to guide to direct to encourage
[38:24] to strengthen and to fortify and to help
[38:27] us in the in the days to come not pray

[38:33] glimpse of the reward that you have for
[38:36] us at the end of the road
[38:39] father bless this word now be with each
[38:42] family in each home

[38:47] the Holy Spirit would reveal yourself to
[38:50] each of them

[38:57] presence just the same Lord because you
[39:01] are the same yesterday today and forever
[39:03] and you promise to be we're just two or
[39:05] three were gathered and our brother even

[39:13] presence we give you ourselves forgive
[39:15] us of our sins forgive us of our
[39:17] trespasses forgive us of anything that
[39:19] would hinder uh you from doing what you
[39:22] desire to do in our hearts our minds and
[39:24] our lives and Lord the prayers that we
[39:27] have prayed for our loved ones that we
[39:29] long to see Lord uh walking in all the
[39:34] truth that has been given to them Father
[39:37] we are trusting you for all these things
[39:39] and we commit ourselves to you in this
[39:41] service receive praise now we ask it in
[39:44] Jesus Christ's name amen amen Hebrews
[39:48] chapter 11 starting here with verse
[39:50] number 24
[39:52] by faith Moses when he had come to years
[39:57] he refused to be called the son of
[39:59] Pharaoh's daughter
[40:01] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[40:04] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[40:07] pleasure of sin for a season
[40:09] esteeming the reproach of Christ
[40:13] greater riches than the treasures of
[40:16] Egypt for he had respect unto the
[40:20] recompense of the reward amen God bless
[40:24] you may be seated
[40:26] amen
[40:28] well we live in the most comfortable age
[40:32] that has ever existed
[40:35] can you imagine Adam and Eve sitting
[40:37] down to watch TV in the garden
[40:42] or Joshua and Caleb under Apple cell
[40:45] phones doing some face time discussing
[40:48] the battle that they were ready to go
[40:50] into
[40:52] we have gone from hollowing out tree
[40:54] logs to make little boats to putting a
[40:57] 350 engine in the back of a ship and
[41:00] basically flying across the water
[41:03] we have more conveniences today than has
[41:07] ever existed in history
[41:09] and we've all been blessed with these
[41:11] conveniences to be honest with you
[41:14] but they can also be a curse
[41:18] and I think one of the greatest tricks
[41:19] the enemy has put in in the churches in
[41:23] in the world is that they feel they are
[41:27] blessed by getting what they want
[41:31] and and honestly it takes them away from
[41:34] needing God more
[41:37] right the more that you get what you
[41:39] want the less you think about what what
[41:42] you need
[41:43] and so it can be a great curse
[41:48] people want to live more comfortable
[41:51] the spirit of this ages is enticing
[41:54] people just to be more comfortable to
[41:56] take the easier path in life
[41:59] and and people have gotten to where they
[42:01] don't need uh others so that they feel
[42:04] that every every man is formed South
[42:07] it's about his own life that matters
[42:10] it's about his own family his own home
[42:12] and it's all about self
[42:15] it's always been about self in every age
[42:19] but it seems like this age people have
[42:23] such a vicious right
[42:26] they're willing to fight for what they
[42:28] want
[42:29] right and brother Brian Thomas this was
[42:31] a rights age a woman's age but it's also
[42:35] we see that sin has got to such a place
[42:38] that that people are willing to go to to
[42:41] court and change the laws and change the
[42:44] Constitution to get what they want
[42:49] we live in an age where people don't
[42:51] want to lay down their lives
[42:53] they don't want to give up their time
[42:55] they don't want to give up their
[42:56] resources
[42:58] just to help other people
[43:01] it just doesn't seem
[43:03] fun convenient to look on the things of
[43:06] others
[43:08] the easier way to serve God
[43:11] who would want to serve God
[43:15] if it's going to hurt
[43:18] and that's how the spirit has gotten in
[43:21] this age uh
[43:24] people are willing to serve God if it's
[43:27] convenient
[43:29] if it works out to their schedule if it
[43:32] doesn't hurt too much if they can gain
[43:34] something out of it then they see a
[43:38] willingness to serve God
[43:41] but this morning we want to talk about
[43:42] choosing to serve God his harder way
[43:45] entitle this message choosing to walk
[43:48] the harder way
[43:50] Walking with God his way is just simply
[43:53] not easy
[43:54] amen
[43:56] he will ask you to do things that you
[43:58] thought you'd never have to do
[44:01] I made some promises to my wife
[44:04] that I couldn't keep
[44:07] because it wasn't God's will
[44:11] and instead of me saying the Lord
[44:13] willing we're never going to have a
[44:15] business
[44:17] I said we're never going to have a
[44:19] business because my dad had a business
[44:20] and I saw what it did in the family and
[44:23] the separation the time and I just knew
[44:26] right off the bat I didn't want that
[44:28] we're never going to have that
[44:30] but that was not God's will
[44:34] because I believe that you can have a
[44:36] business and have it the way God wants
[44:37] it to be
[44:38] to put it in its place to have it's time
[44:41] for it and then time for God
[44:44] but most people don't ought to do that
[44:46] to be honest with you I didn't even know
[44:48] it even existed
[44:51] but we are seeing our opening scripture
[44:53] that Moses chose the harder way
[44:58] he chose to suffer Affliction with the
[45:01] people of God
[45:02] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[45:05] season
[45:06] I mean why couldn't he just chose to be
[45:10] with the people of God without the
[45:12] suffering
[45:13] why does that all why does that have to
[45:16] be there
[45:18] because that's just the way it is
[45:22] he valued the reproach of Christ there's
[45:25] a reproach that comes from being a
[45:27] Christian amen greater riches than the
[45:30] treasures in Egypt for he had respect
[45:33] unto the record Pence of the reward
[45:38] he watched the people of God suffer from
[45:40] the palace
[45:43] he knew it was wrong but honestly he
[45:46] didn't know how to handle it
[45:48] he didn't know how to handle the
[45:50] situation
[45:52] he didn't know how to trust God for the
[45:54] Deliverance
[45:57] so he took it upon himself during a time
[46:00] of his anger and he tried to set things
[46:03] straight and he ended up killing a man
[46:05] right amen amen but when the appointed
[46:07] time came Moses had enough Faith to
[46:11] choose the harder way
[46:14] to choose the harder way it wasn't at
[46:17] the beginning
[46:19] but Moses chose to be looked at as
[46:22] rejected a low lifer
[46:24] perhaps in the the sight of uh
[46:28] uh everyone in in in in in in
[46:31] the pharaoh's uh
[46:34] Camp uh stupid or dumb for his decisions
[46:38] to leave
[46:40] he was regarded as weak incapable and
[46:43] despised but he chose to be looked at as
[46:47] as ill-treated used scorned persecuted
[46:50] and Afflicted of a much greater value
[46:56] than popularity
[46:58] then fame or Fortune
[47:00] and to me we all have a choice in values
[47:05] what we what we value
[47:08] God God bless uh brother Batman uh this
[47:12] this this morning I I believe him or his
[47:15] wife sister Linda had given a pen to my
[47:20] wife to give to me that is a real old
[47:23] pen but it's of great great value
[47:27] and we we and we just appreciate that
[47:30] we're gonna hold on to that remember the
[47:33] story that brother Brown told about the
[47:34] one that had the violin
[47:36] most people didn't think it was worth
[47:39] anything and didn't want to pay much for
[47:41] it and and after the unveiling of what
[47:44] sound that violin made then it become of
[47:47] a greater value and all of us put a
[47:51] value on serving God on Christ and what
[47:54] it's worth to us right
[47:57] show them by the time that we we give
[48:00] but Moses considered being talked about
[48:02] abused
[48:05] oppressed more valuable
[48:07] than trying to prove he was right all
[48:09] the time as a Christian
[48:12] Moses knew that all the Vengeance
[48:14] belonged to God that God was a judge
[48:18] that
[48:18] it wasn't up to men to try to compensate
[48:21] for what he lost or or tried to make
[48:24] amends for things that that uh
[48:27] he got taken away from him that's why
[48:30] the scripture says give and don't expect
[48:32] in return
[48:34] Moses had respect that God was going to
[48:38] be the one to compensate him
[48:40] so he looked away from all that he could
[48:42] gain and he kept his eyes on Jesus he
[48:46] focused on the will of God for his life
[48:49] and I'll say it like this Moses chose
[48:52] the harder way
[48:55] brother Brandon said in the true Easter
[48:57] seal and he's talking about uh the
[49:00] prophecy that came to him and what God
[49:03] spoke to him and he said because those
[49:05] chosen the Narrow Path the heart away
[49:07] that thou was walked of thy known
[49:09] choosing
[49:12] and he says here see you choose it
[49:15] yourself
[49:18] we all got to make that choice are we
[49:21] going to choose to serve God his way the
[49:24] harder way are we going to keep trying
[49:26] to look for the easier way
[49:28] see you choose it yourself Moses made
[49:31] his own choice he didn't have to do it
[49:34] neither did I
[49:36] have to take this path
[49:40] I could have had big buildings out
[49:42] yonder
[49:43] like some of them has got
[49:46] I could be all across on television
[49:51] choice
[49:52] you know many people choose popularity
[49:56] they choose money they choose popularity
[49:59] they choose things
[50:02] to make it worthwhile to them
[50:07] but very few people look at serving God
[50:11] for one thing I just want to please him
[50:13] who saved me
[50:16] and I'll do it at all costs
[50:19] amen if there's nothing not enough
[50:21] getting out of it they're not going to
[50:23] serve God that that way and I'd say if
[50:27] you're going to serve God
[50:28] his way it will be the harder way
[50:34] yeah we all Satan's always trying to
[50:36] show us an easier way just like he did
[50:38] Eve just like he did all the the Angels
[50:41] when he stole the angels
[50:43] he's showing him an easier way you don't
[50:44] gotta listen to this guy
[50:47] you do what you want to do
[50:49] look I laughed it it was okay
[50:53] why don't you leave
[50:55] yeah well Lucifer he didn't get
[50:57] destroyed I'll follow him I I want to do
[50:59] my own thing
[51:03] the Temptation that we have is always
[51:07] to serve God the easier way
[51:11] and
[51:13] yeah I want I want us to be reminded
[51:15] that it's a harder way but I also want
[51:17] us to be reminded that there's a reward
[51:19] coming for us there is a reward for
[51:22] choosing the harder way
[51:26] we all want God to be with us like he
[51:29] was with Moses God told Joshua as I was
[51:31] with Moses so shall I be with you we all
[51:34] want that and honestly God had spoke
[51:38] that one time to me in Prophecy as I was
[51:40] with Moses so shall I be with you
[51:43] we all want that
[51:45] but are we all wanting to walk the hard
[51:49] way
[51:50] see it's like we want a part of God
[51:53] that's going to benefit us but the other
[51:55] part that doesn't benefit us we shy away
[51:58] from
[51:59] and you can't do that it's like
[52:00] separating God from his word you can't
[52:03] separate uh God's good way from his bad
[52:06] way everything about God is good
[52:10] we just have to come to grips with it
[52:12] that the harder way is the good way
[52:18] so if you want God to be with you like
[52:21] he was with Moses you must choose the
[52:23] harder way for yourself
[52:27] now I'm not talking about just attending
[52:29] a a message church and calling that the
[52:32] harder way
[52:34] I'm talking about choosing the harder
[52:37] way of life every single day
[52:39] just like the prophet taught us
[52:43] if there's a union in your heart to want
[52:46] to walk closer to God
[52:48] it'll be harder
[52:50] it won't be easier it'll be hard
[52:53] everyday choices are made people make
[52:55] thousands of decisions every day
[52:59] right I can imagine the devil giving
[53:01] them a lot to choose from
[53:05] every adult who makes dozens and dozens
[53:09] of informed decisions
[53:12] you don't change their mind a lot
[53:15] a recent study showed that of those
[53:18] informed decisions that
[53:20] every adult makes 87 percent of them
[53:23] change their minds after they already
[53:25] decided
[53:30] crazy
[53:32] you talk about people wandering around
[53:34] not knowing what they should be doing
[53:36] for which way to take
[53:38] in the same Study 37 percent of the
[53:41] people found it difficult to decide what
[53:44] to eat
[53:45] or what TV show to watch
[53:49] 29 struggle with what to wear each day
[53:54] now we've all done that
[53:56] should I wear this or should I wear that
[54:01] 27 struggle whether to buy something new
[54:05] or not
[54:07] eleven percent of those people are
[54:09] confused changing their minds at least
[54:12] five times per decision
[54:19] people are struggling
[54:21] to make all kinds of choices in their
[54:25] life
[54:26] and you think a person who's indecisive
[54:29] in the natural like that
[54:31] is going to choose to choose the harder
[54:34] way
[54:36] no they're not going to they're not
[54:38] going to be looking they're not going to
[54:39] want to sit down and and and and hear
[54:42] the scriptures talk about an a harder
[54:45] way when they can go next door to a
[54:47] church that's talking about the easier
[54:48] way
[54:51] the Hardaway is only chosen by those who
[54:55] love the Lord with all their heart amen
[55:00] it takes genuine love for God to choose
[55:04] the harder way
[55:06] to take the back seat to go the second
[55:08] mile to love those who despitefully use
[55:11] you and say oh a manner of evil against
[55:13] you
[55:14] to give up your life in order to hunt
[55:16] for Souls that already ordained have
[55:18] been ordained to
[55:20] eternal life they're out there we don't
[55:21] know who they are but to give up your
[55:23] life just to find one of them
[55:25] is a harder life
[55:28] without the mindset
[55:31] of Fame a fortune a recognition of
[55:33] reputation
[55:36] Paul was a man who chose the easier path
[55:39] of life
[55:42] before he met Christ he chose popularity
[55:45] with people
[55:47] great esteem to build a reputation for
[55:49] himself
[55:51] Saul wanted to stick out and be a a
[55:54] Hebrew of the Hebrews
[55:56] he considered himself blameless
[55:58] concerning the righteousness which is in
[56:00] the law he was a Pharisee of the
[56:03] Pharisees he had so much Zeal that he
[56:05] actually persecuted the Church of God
[56:07] the Bible tells us
[56:09] amen he set himself to the offense of
[56:13] what he believed
[56:15] in other words he couldn't trust God
[56:17] that all Vengeance belonged to God
[56:21] that God needed some help so he went out
[56:23] there and was offensive
[56:27] he had no understanding of spiritual
[56:29] warfare
[56:31] at that time he didn't he thought he
[56:34] thought we'd just fight against flesh
[56:36] and blood we'll just take these
[56:37] Christians and we'll kill him we'll put
[56:38] them in prison we'll do what we got to
[56:39] do to get this out of here
[56:41] amen
[56:42] biting devouring hating destroying
[56:45] killing the nature of man
[56:48] who hasn't been regenerated it's the way
[56:52] people think before their life becomes
[56:55] regenerated
[56:57] the scripture tells us that Saul was
[56:59] breathing out threatenings and Slaughter
[57:02] against the Disciples of the Lord and
[57:04] against them who were who who found
[57:06] choosing to live in this harder way
[57:11] the ball Paul calls it this way right or
[57:15] as he as he's as the book of Acts is
[57:17] being written Maybe by Luke if I could
[57:19] say it like this
[57:21] he said he got anybody that was in this
[57:23] way
[57:24] they threw him in prison well what is
[57:26] this way it's God's way right it's it's
[57:30] the harder way
[57:33] but there was a time that God got a hold
[57:37] of Saul I'll say it like this got a hold
[57:39] of his spiritual attention and said Saul
[57:42] Saul why are you persecuting me
[57:45] you're not persecuting
[57:48] humans
[57:49] other people you're persecuting me
[57:52] we got to think about that when we when
[57:54] we go and we say something about
[57:56] somebody do something that that's
[57:59] hurtful to somebody it ain't against
[58:00] them
[58:02] it's against God
[58:05] and Jesus said
[58:07] uh why why you're persecuting me I'm
[58:11] Jesus whom thou persecutest in other
[58:14] words what you've done to the least of
[58:15] these little ones you've really done it
[58:17] to me
[58:19] God feels every persecution
[58:23] that comes against us
[58:26] and if you value it as an honor or a
[58:31] greater treasure
[58:33] then being lifted up
[58:36] you have a great reward coming
[58:39] because
[58:40] to be mistreated
[58:43] is the way of a Christian Life
[58:47] I know it's not the modern terminology
[58:50] it's not what we want but it is
[58:53] remember when Jesus when he was talking
[58:56] and he
[58:57] uh
[58:59] uh about the the the the the the
[59:02] Pharisees and the people who wanted
[59:05] others to look up to them
[59:07] amen he said they have their reward
[59:10] that's what they their main motive their
[59:13] main focus was that they could be have
[59:16] some recognition down here where when
[59:19] we're serving God our reward doesn't
[59:21] come from this side it comes on the
[59:23] other side
[59:25] our reward comes later we just need to
[59:28] have respect unto the recompense of the
[59:31] reward have confidence that God is going
[59:33] to compensate you on the other side
[59:36] don't worry about this side you know I I
[59:39] talk to people for years and I've seen
[59:42] that it's all about settling things now
[59:45] having things to be right now that that
[59:48] that's not fair what what has happened
[59:50] and I'm I'm saying
[59:54] God rewards us on the other side
[59:58] God didn't go back in Paul's life
[1:00:00] Moses's life
[1:00:04] uh brother Brandon's life and make
[1:00:07] everybody pay for the wrong that was
[1:00:09] done against them
[1:00:12] God settles everything on the other side
[1:00:15] God judges who you want to judge here
[1:00:17] and and judges who he wants to on the
[1:00:19] other side that's just it's just the way
[1:00:21] it is
[1:00:23] but we need to focus on
[1:00:25] the harder way is between us and God it
[1:00:28] ain't between us and God and everybody
[1:00:30] else
[1:00:31] right and if somebody else mistreats us
[1:00:33] somebody else does something wrong that
[1:00:35] we need to like get all huffled and
[1:00:37] bothered and Feathers all fluffed up and
[1:00:40] you know got to say this got to say that
[1:00:42] got to tell this person got to tell that
[1:00:44] person you know that's not serving God
[1:00:47] the harder way
[1:00:49] serving God the hard way is go to that
[1:00:51] person in private
[1:00:53] have enough holy ghost in you and enough
[1:00:56] love of God in you to get things where
[1:00:58] they need to get to
[1:01:00] without anybody else hearing about it
[1:01:03] right that's the harder way
[1:01:05] but I don't feel I can do that they
[1:01:07] won't listen to me well then what you
[1:01:09] need to do is get down in your knees and
[1:01:10] get a hold of God
[1:01:11] [Music]
[1:01:13] don't make up some excuse for going
[1:01:14] talking about somebody
[1:01:19] one day
[1:01:21] God's mercy rewrote Saul's life
[1:01:25] and how did he do it he showed Saul
[1:01:30] that he wasn't what he thought he was
[1:01:33] that was really Mercy that was shown him
[1:01:36] that amen
[1:01:37] that he wasn't as great as he thought he
[1:01:40] was in fact
[1:01:42] he honestly got the Revelation that he
[1:01:44] was nothing
[1:01:47] and gave him a revelation that he
[1:01:49] literally had to give up everything he
[1:01:50] had
[1:01:54] his whole life his reputation everything
[1:01:56] had to become zero new plane I'm nothing
[1:02:00] I don't want nothing about my password
[1:02:03] and I couldn't talk about it
[1:02:07] it's all about a new creature now
[1:02:11] that's when mercy rewrote his life
[1:02:16] in fact one of the revelations that Saul
[1:02:18] got
[1:02:20] is when what Jesus told ananias when he
[1:02:23] said for I must show him how great
[1:02:26] things he must suffer
[1:02:28] he had to have that revelation
[1:02:33] here he was
[1:02:35] persecuting the Christians why because
[1:02:38] he didn't understand that was truly
[1:02:40] God's way well just because Saul became
[1:02:43] a Christian it does not mean
[1:02:47] that everybody knows he Paul's the right
[1:02:50] way
[1:02:53] now he's the one that's going to be
[1:02:54] persecuted from somebody else
[1:02:57] and I'm telling you if when we're
[1:02:59] walking god's way the devil's going to
[1:03:01] make sure he's got somebody on your tail
[1:03:03] right true
[1:03:05] because
[1:03:07] God wants to destroy anything that's
[1:03:10] authentic
[1:03:11] the devil wants to destroy anything
[1:03:13] that's authentic
[1:03:15] anything that's pure anything that's
[1:03:17] wonderful lovely anything that's true
[1:03:19] blue God mix it up and he don't care
[1:03:24] but the bride won't be mixed
[1:03:26] she's going to be a sold out group
[1:03:29] and she's paying the price now she's not
[1:03:32] taking the easy path she has chosen the
[1:03:35] harder way
[1:03:44] love can be the only motivation that's
[1:03:46] willing to suffer to help others
[1:03:50] I believe that love for Christ and a
[1:03:54] willingness to suffer for Christ
[1:03:56] they're in direct relationship if a
[1:03:58] person hardly loves the lord they're
[1:04:00] hardly going to be willing to suffer I
[1:04:03] believe if a person is loves the Lord
[1:04:06] with all everything they got they're
[1:04:09] willing to suffer whatever it takes
[1:04:11] is that that love is that unworthiness
[1:04:13] to give up more of your life and you
[1:04:16] know we all are in the message we all
[1:04:20] are Christians but we don't all love God
[1:04:23] the same
[1:04:24] we want to love God the same we want to
[1:04:28] get to that place where we love them
[1:04:29] with all of our heart with all of our
[1:04:30] soul with all of our might
[1:04:33] but the but the the fact is
[1:04:36] their internal choices and everybody
[1:04:39] makes a different decision
[1:04:42] the message is true
[1:04:45] we all say Amen to the word we all
[1:04:47] believe it's true but do we all love him
[1:04:51] the same
[1:04:52] because with every every encounter with
[1:04:55] the word is like when
[1:04:58] Jesus talked to the Rich Young Ruler and
[1:05:01] he said you know give up all that you
[1:05:02] got and
[1:05:03] go distribute it to the poor and when
[1:05:07] you've got rid of everything
[1:05:09] kind of like Saul then come follow me
[1:05:13] and there's things that we we hold on to
[1:05:15] and they may not be monetarily uh things
[1:05:19] they may be just simply like I don't I I
[1:05:22] I love who I am I want my reputation
[1:05:26] I don't want to give that up
[1:05:28] in fact I want people to know how great
[1:05:30] I am but you know friends it's hard to
[1:05:32] really serve God the harder way when
[1:05:34] that is important to you
[1:05:36] when that is important to you you're
[1:05:39] you're you're only going to go so far in
[1:05:42] serving God and after that you're going
[1:05:43] to stop amen you've got to be willing to
[1:05:46] Bear the reproach of just giving up
[1:05:49] everything
[1:05:50] for Christ
[1:05:53] so instead of Paul now being on the
[1:05:56] offense he goes on the defense
[1:05:59] he became wise as a serpent harmless as
[1:06:01] a dove in Philippians chapter 1 verse 12
[1:06:03] if we could just begin reading there
[1:06:05] Philippians chapter 1 verse 12 but I
[1:06:08] would ye should understand brethren
[1:06:12] and I'm sorry for not giving you time to
[1:06:15] turn there in the scriptures
[1:06:18] but I would ye should be you should
[1:06:21] understand Brethren that the things
[1:06:23] which have happened unto me
[1:06:26] have fallen out rather unto the furthest
[1:06:28] of the Gospel so here's a man he's in
[1:06:30] prison the these things have come
[1:06:32] against him he gets thrown into prison
[1:06:34] and
[1:06:36] um it looks like a very shaky time we
[1:06:38] know that Timothy was a man that was
[1:06:41] greatly bothered because of what Paul
[1:06:44] went through
[1:06:45] and he began to fear and and Paul was
[1:06:50] trying to tell him look God has not
[1:06:51] given you the spirit of fear amen and
[1:06:54] anything uh perfect love cast that out
[1:06:57] God has given us the spirit of of a
[1:07:00] sound mind of of love and and a peace
[1:07:04] and and and and the things that come of
[1:07:07] the Holy Ghost the holy spirit this is
[1:07:09] what God has given us
[1:07:13] but Timothy battling in his flesh hadn't
[1:07:16] totally surrendered and and God told or
[1:07:19] or Paul told Timothy to embrace it to
[1:07:22] embrace this this is this harder way and
[1:07:24] you can read about this in second
[1:07:25] Timothy chapter uh Second Timothy
[1:07:29] chapter one so that my bonds he said
[1:07:32] that my Bonds in Christ are manifest in
[1:07:36] all the palace and in all other places
[1:07:39] everybody knows about it and as many and
[1:07:43] many of the brethren in the lord they're
[1:07:45] waxing confident
[1:07:48] buy my bonds and are much more bold to
[1:07:52] speak the word without fear
[1:07:55] in other words they saw some of these
[1:07:57] Brethren saw Paul being persecuted and
[1:08:01] yet he's standing for Christ
[1:08:04] he's now whining about how bad it is how
[1:08:07] hard it is and that boy ain't worth
[1:08:09] doing that and you know that's forget it
[1:08:12] no he embraced it he called it an honor
[1:08:16] he caught it of a greater value
[1:08:19] then all the fame out there without the
[1:08:22] problems with having the whole world
[1:08:24] behind me
[1:08:26] it was worth so much more to him look at
[1:08:30] those that were that were in prison and
[1:08:33] and they they were thrown into prison
[1:08:35] and they said that they counted an honor
[1:08:39] that they could suffer for the name of
[1:08:41] the Lord
[1:08:42] the reward was so much greater they
[1:08:45] valued suffering for Jesus more than not
[1:08:49] suffering
[1:08:51] amen
[1:08:52] and and this is the thing that our flesh
[1:08:54] is our flesh is looking for constant I
[1:08:57] don't want to suffer
[1:08:59] it's just part of God's way and as soon
[1:09:02] as you step out of that way and it's
[1:09:05] about convenience and it's about what
[1:09:07] you enjoy I want you to understand
[1:09:10] that God may not be in that way
[1:09:14] God may not be in that way
[1:09:17] now I understand he said he'd never
[1:09:20] leave us or forsake us but that doesn't
[1:09:22] mean we don't leave his way right right
[1:09:26] we got to stay in the way
[1:09:28] and it's a Hallelujah way it's a
[1:09:30] glorious way but it's also a way that's
[1:09:33] hard
[1:09:35] a way that you go through tests and
[1:09:37] trials and and and and and people do so
[1:09:41] much evil against you
[1:09:43] but you stand for the defense of the
[1:09:45] Gospel you don't prove you're right
[1:09:48] you don't prove they're wrong
[1:09:52] you just count it in honor to suffer for
[1:09:55] him because that's that just comes with
[1:09:57] the territory amen it really does
[1:10:00] now verse 15 now some indeed preach
[1:10:03] Christ even of envy and strife
[1:10:06] and some of good world will
[1:10:09] see you got people on both sides
[1:10:12] the one preached Christ of contention
[1:10:14] not sincerely
[1:10:16] supposing to add Affliction to my bonds
[1:10:18] so so when people
[1:10:20] are preaching their thoughts to you
[1:10:24] some have other agenda in their mind
[1:10:28] and uh you know people say things it's
[1:10:32] either gonna uh uh start a Strife
[1:10:36] between you know the Bible says Uh
[1:10:38] there's there's seven things that God
[1:10:40] hates and and and the seventh is an
[1:10:43] Abomination and he that stole a Discord
[1:10:45] that that that Vision that Strife amen
[1:10:48] and so God doesn't ever want a saying
[1:10:51] thing that's going to bring a division
[1:10:53] between one brother and another brother
[1:10:54] even though they're not around
[1:10:57] the spirit is wrong
[1:11:02] so verse 17 but the other of love
[1:11:07] knowing I am set
[1:11:10] or that word set means to outstretch you
[1:11:14] just you're just outstretched to help
[1:11:16] anybody come to Christ for the defense
[1:11:19] of the Gospel
[1:11:21] because I'm telling you people have to
[1:11:23] cross they have to they have to make the
[1:11:25] choice to come over to Christ
[1:11:28] and if you can just stretch out your
[1:11:31] life and and let them use you to see
[1:11:35] Christ manifested
[1:11:38] then all glory to God Amen
[1:11:42] as a complete servant of God Paul became
[1:11:46] a servant to all men
[1:11:48] knowing that he would only win a few
[1:11:52] but
[1:11:53] he became a servant to all
[1:11:57] not serving the Flesh of man right
[1:12:01] because you can't serve man and God
[1:12:04] but he became a servant unto man that
[1:12:07] man might find a way to God
[1:12:10] and he became all things to all men that
[1:12:12] he might win some of them and it really
[1:12:14] takes a servant's mentality to win souls
[1:12:19] to really win a soul it takes a a a a
[1:12:23] servant's mentality
[1:12:27] as God's servant you will be used
[1:12:31] you will be abused you will be
[1:12:33] mistreated
[1:12:35] you will be ill talked about you will be
[1:12:38] taken advantage of but as I said before
[1:12:42] it comes with the territory of choosing
[1:12:45] the harder way amen
[1:12:48] in Paul's old life he persecuted the
[1:12:51] church and Paul's new life he became
[1:12:54] persecuted
[1:12:56] and this is what I wanted us to
[1:12:58] understand that if we're not being
[1:13:00] persecuted for serving the lord
[1:13:03] because we'd be persecuted for being
[1:13:05] you know a Democrat a Republican
[1:13:08] for voting this way or that way but I'm
[1:13:11] talking about if we're not being
[1:13:12] persecuted for being a Christian we need
[1:13:16] to take a look at the way that we're
[1:13:17] walking
[1:13:18] even
[1:13:20] First Corinthians 15 9 says for I am the
[1:13:24] least of the Apostles
[1:13:28] that
[1:13:30] that am not meat
[1:13:32] to be called an apostle
[1:13:37] he wasn't didn't even feel worthy to be
[1:13:40] called Apostle because I persecuted the
[1:13:43] church
[1:13:45] look at Paul's humility and his
[1:13:46] unworthiness and indebtedness even after
[1:13:49] he repented
[1:13:51] he still felt the same way before he
[1:13:53] repented
[1:13:55] the reason he repented was because he he
[1:13:57] felt unworthy God got a hold of him said
[1:14:00] this is wrong
[1:14:01] but just because the blood of Christ
[1:14:04] covers you
[1:14:06] and that guilt
[1:14:09] is gone it doesn't mean you still don't
[1:14:12] feel unworthy
[1:14:14] amen that's where people miss it
[1:14:16] and they get rid of that and they they
[1:14:18] don't know how to they don't have no
[1:14:20] energy to serve the way God called him
[1:14:22] to
[1:14:23] but you when you realize that Christ is
[1:14:26] what Christ has done for you you are
[1:14:28] it's so easy to be sold out loud Stock
[1:14:31] and Barrel because you're not your own
[1:14:33] you've been bought with a price
[1:14:35] that's right but if you think God's
[1:14:37] given you salvation like some Christmas
[1:14:39] present you can go do what you want to
[1:14:41] do you never understand what it means to
[1:14:43] walk the hard way
[1:14:47] in one place Paul said that he
[1:14:50] persecuted the church be unmeasured
[1:14:53] and he wasted it
[1:14:56] but when God called
[1:15:00] Paul
[1:15:02] separated him from his mother's womb
[1:15:05] he had a revelation of how great things
[1:15:08] he was going to suffer
[1:15:11] and I I believe this is why so many
[1:15:13] people the majority of the people who
[1:15:15] come to Christ
[1:15:18] are not willing to walk the harder way
[1:15:20] and they stop serving God
[1:15:24] it's just the facts right and I'm I'm
[1:15:27] here not saying we don't understand
[1:15:29] those facts we do we do understand those
[1:15:32] those things here
[1:15:36] and and through our walk from here to
[1:15:39] when we're out of here the devil is
[1:15:41] going to be working very hard to get us
[1:15:43] to walk the easier path to step off the
[1:15:47] hard way and take the easier one this is
[1:15:49] what I want to say to those of you who
[1:15:52] choose to stay the harder path God will
[1:15:54] reward you but don't look for it here
[1:15:57] why do people leave now why do they quit
[1:15:59] why do they go to the Easter path
[1:16:00] because the reward isn't good enough
[1:16:03] there's it ain't worth it to them
[1:16:06] what do you get out of it
[1:16:08] no popularity
[1:16:10] no money
[1:16:11] you don't get anything out of it why do
[1:16:14] it
[1:16:15] why am I going to spend time helping
[1:16:17] somebody when I can help myself make it
[1:16:20] easier for me
[1:16:22] and this is
[1:16:24] this is what we're tempted with but our
[1:16:27] reward isn't on this side Paul never
[1:16:30] received his reward for what he went
[1:16:32] through on this side
[1:16:34] it's on the other side
[1:16:36] it's when you see the one that you
[1:16:39] brought to Christ there in eternity
[1:16:42] forever
[1:16:44] there's your reward
[1:16:47] there's your reward
[1:16:50] First Corinthians chapter 4 verse 10.
[1:16:55] we first Corinthians chapter 4 verse 10
[1:16:57] Paul says we are fools
[1:17:00] for Christ
[1:17:01] we're fools for Christ
[1:17:05] why is Paul identifying himself as a
[1:17:09] fool for Christ
[1:17:11] because to the world only a fool would
[1:17:16] give up their life to walk the heart
[1:17:18] away
[1:17:19] because everybody in the world's look at
[1:17:21] it and says well that's crazy he didn't
[1:17:22] get nothing out of it
[1:17:24] everything he makes he's given away
[1:17:27] all his time his life what he has he's
[1:17:30] given it to help somebody that's so
[1:17:32] foolish to the world that's foolish
[1:17:35] but to those that understand
[1:17:37] that just one soul
[1:17:40] is worth it all Beyond it
[1:17:45] but we but ye are wise in Christ we are
[1:17:49] weak but you're strong you're honorable
[1:17:50] but we are despised
[1:17:53] even unto this present hour we both
[1:17:56] hunger and thirst and are naked and are
[1:17:59] buffeted and have no certain dwelling
[1:18:01] place now Paul is talking about this
[1:18:03] harder way that he chose
[1:18:06] and and labor working with our own hands
[1:18:09] not wanting somebody to give to us being
[1:18:12] reviled we bless being persecuted we
[1:18:16] suffer being defray be being defamed we
[1:18:21] entreat
[1:18:22] we are made as the filth of the world
[1:18:26] and are the off scouring of all things
[1:18:30] unto this day well Paul are you sure
[1:18:35] that you chose the right way
[1:18:39] how many people have deviated from this
[1:18:42] way and have started serving God easier
[1:18:47] still in a message church still claiming
[1:18:50] the message
[1:18:52] but the easier way
[1:18:55] says I write not these things to shame
[1:18:58] you
[1:19:00] but as my beloved Sons
[1:19:03] I warn you
[1:19:07] so Paul is sending a warning now
[1:19:11] for though you have 10 000 instructors
[1:19:15] in Christ
[1:19:17] have ye not many fathers for in Christ
[1:19:20] Jesus I
[1:19:22] have begotten you
[1:19:23] through the gospel
[1:19:26] so he's taken these 10 000 instructors
[1:19:28] he's setting those aside and he says I
[1:19:31] am the one that begotten you in the
[1:19:33] gospel
[1:19:34] and he says wherefore I beseech you be
[1:19:37] ye followers of me
[1:19:40] in other words don't choose the easier
[1:19:43] path follow me as I have chosen the
[1:19:47] harder way
[1:19:48] he wasn't trying to get somebody to just
[1:19:51] you know I need more people in my camp
[1:19:53] I want more people in my church I want
[1:19:55] more people on my uh
[1:19:58] telegram my Facebook my following my
[1:20:02] Twitter my whatever
[1:20:03] he wasn't looking for that he was
[1:20:06] looking for those who who could catch a
[1:20:09] glimpse of what God really wanted for
[1:20:13] their life
[1:20:14] the harder path he doesn't talk well you
[1:20:17] know I got these I got these badges I
[1:20:19] got these plaques on the wall you know
[1:20:22] we blessed we get blessed more a nobody
[1:20:25] persecutes us we ain't suffering no that
[1:20:28] wasn't what he said and they'll come and
[1:20:30] follow me the easier path that's Satan
[1:20:33] baby That's what Satan told his angels
[1:20:36] angels he didn't convince a third of the
[1:20:39] angels to follow him because his way was
[1:20:41] harder and they were going to hell
[1:20:47] I don't care how many instructors there
[1:20:49] are in Christ
[1:20:50] I don't care how many fathers there are
[1:20:53] we got one true revelation of God's way
[1:21:00] and this way can only
[1:21:02] be walked of our own choosing
[1:21:06] let's follow Paul's heart away for just
[1:21:08] a moment we've read it many times in a
[1:21:10] second Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23
[1:21:13] says are they Ministers of Christ
[1:21:16] speak as a fool he says I am more well
[1:21:21] what makes you more of a minister than
[1:21:22] somebody else Paul
[1:21:25] he says in laborers more abundant
[1:21:28] in Stripes hitting my back above measure
[1:21:34] being thrown into prison more often
[1:21:38] in dying going through the experience of
[1:21:41] death often
[1:21:43] in other Jews five times received I-40
[1:21:45] Stripes save one Thrice I was beaten
[1:21:47] with rods once I was stoned Thrice I I
[1:21:49] suffered shipwreck a day and night have
[1:21:51] I been in the deep and Journeys often in
[1:21:53] Perils of water Perils of robbers and
[1:21:56] Perils of my own countrymen and Perils
[1:21:58] of the Heathen and perils in the city
[1:22:00] and in the country and in the wilderness
[1:22:02] and the Sea again must have went to see
[1:22:04] a lot in perils among
[1:22:09] brethren
[1:22:12] but believing
[1:22:13] falsely
[1:22:17] in weariness and painfulness and
[1:22:19] watchings often in hunger and thirst and
[1:22:21] fastings often in cold and nakedness
[1:22:24] man oh man
[1:22:26] this is the harder way
[1:22:29] amen and besides those things that are
[1:22:31] without that which comes upon me daily
[1:22:33] take care of all the churches
[1:22:36] so who is weak
[1:22:39] and I am not weak who is offended and I
[1:22:42] burn not
[1:22:44] if I'm going to Glory I'm going to glory
[1:22:47] in the things that concern my
[1:22:48] infirmities
[1:22:50] Moses
[1:22:51] counted it a greater rich or a greater
[1:22:55] value
[1:22:56] to suffer the reproach of the heart away
[1:22:59] as a Christian
[1:23:01] much greater
[1:23:04] than anything that he could get
[1:23:07] in this world and still serve God
[1:23:13] that sounds personal to me that sounds
[1:23:16] intimate to me that sounds like these
[1:23:19] men had a relationship like I want
[1:23:23] that I'm willing to give up more than I
[1:23:25] have given up
[1:23:28] this is why it's the harder way
[1:23:31] Paul chose it of his own choosing just
[1:23:34] like Moses did just like brother Brandon
[1:23:37] did
[1:23:38] now let's Embrace God's heart away for
[1:23:41] our life
[1:23:43] let's not be afraid of things being
[1:23:45] harder giving up a little bit more
[1:23:48] sacrificing a little bit more
[1:23:51] whatever you do do not compare yourself
[1:23:53] to the person you're sitting to Next in
[1:23:55] the church
[1:23:56] do not compare yourself to anybody that
[1:23:59] is so unwise
[1:24:00] we have this example in this Bible
[1:24:04] we have a Vindicated Prophet that came
[1:24:07] we have the word of God we do not need
[1:24:11] one another so we can just not have to
[1:24:14] try as hard right
[1:24:16] you look to me you may not want to go
[1:24:18] the harder way
[1:24:21] because I'm I may be going the easy way
[1:24:26] you understand what I'm saying if you
[1:24:27] look to somebody else who's not willing
[1:24:30] to pay the price and you're joining
[1:24:33] yourself with them don't you know you
[1:24:35] will become just like them
[1:24:40] you will follow whatever you hang out
[1:24:42] with the most
[1:24:45] whatever you watch whatever you listen
[1:24:47] to wherever you spend your time whatever
[1:24:49] you fellowship with that is what you
[1:24:52] will become
[1:24:54] that's why if you get into the word you
[1:24:56] dig and you say God is this the truth
[1:24:58] that I'm hearing today is this from you
[1:25:02] because there won't be very many in the
[1:25:04] Rapture I'm telling you
[1:25:07] how many will be taken from here I do
[1:25:09] not know
[1:25:12] we come here and we wonder who's going
[1:25:14] to come to church I'll say friends my
[1:25:16] precious Brothers and Sisters in Christ
[1:25:18] you need to be thinking about making a
[1:25:20] Rapture and keeping your eyes focused on
[1:25:21] what you got to do to make it because
[1:25:23] nothing else matters down here
[1:25:29] Acts chapter
[1:25:31] 24 verse 14.
[1:25:39] we need to stop looking at the easier
[1:25:42] path all the time the people we've got
[1:25:44] it easy
[1:25:46] God will reward you
[1:25:49] God will reward you
[1:25:52] know I wonder why people take the easier
[1:25:53] path because they feel there's no reward
[1:25:56] behind it
[1:25:58] they feel it's not worth it
[1:26:00] like what do I get out of it
[1:26:02] they just slap me in the face
[1:26:05] I'm not going to turn the other cheek
[1:26:07] I'm not going to go the Second Mile I'm
[1:26:09] not going to carry this brother's burden
[1:26:11] I don't get nothing out of it they don't
[1:26:14] even appreciate it they just go ahead
[1:26:16] and they do it again
[1:26:20] but if your relationship is with God
[1:26:23] oh my
[1:26:25] God's got a reward for you amen and just
[1:26:28] because you're not getting it now
[1:26:30] it doesn't mean it's not common
[1:26:33] but this I confess unto thee that after
[1:26:36] the way which they call heresy so
[1:26:39] worship I the god of my fathers
[1:26:41] believing all things that are written in
[1:26:43] the law and in the prophets Paul
[1:26:46] worshiped God by giving his life daily
[1:26:50] to convince others that Jesus Christ is
[1:26:52] the only way the only truth and the only
[1:26:55] life and he didn't just say you need to
[1:26:57] walk the harder way
[1:26:59] no he said you need Jesus Christ and his
[1:27:02] life displayed he was walking the hard
[1:27:04] way
[1:27:07] people
[1:27:08] call this giving
[1:27:10] more of your life to God a heresy you
[1:27:13] don't got to do that
[1:27:15] you don't got to do that
[1:27:17] it's unorthodox it's not the the
[1:27:19] mainstream of belief
[1:27:21] but it is God's way
[1:27:26] some people also view brother branham's
[1:27:29] way of Christianity as unorthodox as
[1:27:31] well and I've read this quote in the
[1:27:33] message of man running from the presence
[1:27:34] of God he said Christianity is an
[1:27:36] everyday rugged life living for God in
[1:27:39] this present world it is a constant
[1:27:41] burning of the fire and the love of God
[1:27:43] and the heart that sets you a fire and
[1:27:44] put you out yonder with people and
[1:27:46] making converts to Christ
[1:27:49] but the modern Church world says that's
[1:27:52] heresy
[1:27:54] I'm a Christian I don't have to do that
[1:28:00] and some people in this message look at
[1:28:02] that and say well I believe that's a an
[1:28:04] outstanding you know uh definition of a
[1:28:08] Christian and you know if it's just
[1:28:10] right and uh you know God lead me you
[1:28:12] know put something on my heart you know
[1:28:14] I'll just I'll just speak to somebody
[1:28:17] if that's not what the quote says amen
[1:28:20] right why don't we just stay with the
[1:28:22] message stay with what's written
[1:28:25] we don't want to make it something
[1:28:27] different
[1:28:28] we need to conform to it not try to get
[1:28:31] things to conform to our way of thinking
[1:28:34] that's what gets us in so much trouble
[1:28:38] amen it's good to hear some amens
[1:28:42] makes me feel like preaching
[1:28:44] [Laughter]
[1:28:45] God's harder way is to accept our
[1:28:49] responsibility amen as Christians and
[1:28:52] our responsibility is to win souls it's
[1:28:54] all there is to it we must choose the
[1:28:57] harder way
[1:28:58] make some converts for Christ
[1:29:01] while people persecute you
[1:29:04] you're blessing them
[1:29:06] we must make sure that we don't
[1:29:09] persecute others
[1:29:11] don't say negative things about others
[1:29:14] don't say any other things about
[1:29:15] brothers and sisters who we know or
[1:29:17] think we know they know better
[1:29:20] pray for them
[1:29:22] in fact you want to be a real servant
[1:29:24] get them and Unite with them in prayer
[1:29:28] say brother and sister brother sister
[1:29:30] whoever it may be I I so much
[1:29:34] believe that you're a child of God that
[1:29:36] I just want us to pray together that God
[1:29:39] will move mightily
[1:29:43] begin to build the spirit of the unity
[1:29:48] of Christ
[1:29:48] [Music]
[1:29:50] you know sometimes we just feel like
[1:29:52] well things got to get worked out here
[1:29:54] there and everything else before I'm
[1:29:55] going to be in unity with somebody
[1:29:57] brother sister if Christ had to do that
[1:30:00] for you you would have never came
[1:30:03] his love surrounded you
[1:30:05] for what his great love we're with he
[1:30:08] loved you
[1:30:09] showed he loved you first
[1:30:13] then you repented
[1:30:15] amen
[1:30:17] Galatians chapter 4 verse 28 now we
[1:30:20] Brethren as Isaac was are the children
[1:30:24] of Promise how many
[1:30:26] believes that you're a child of the
[1:30:28] promise
[1:30:30] but as then he that was born after the
[1:30:34] flesh persecuted him that was born after
[1:30:37] the spirit and Paul is saying to the
[1:30:40] galatian church even so it is now
[1:30:45] so I say unto you if you find yourself
[1:30:47] certain things slipping out
[1:30:52] about somebody
[1:30:55] according to the scriptures here
[1:30:57] it's a good indication
[1:31:00] that that's
[1:31:01] of the flesh
[1:31:04] and you're persecuting that which is of
[1:31:06] the spirit
[1:31:08] so I just say
[1:31:10] don't give a some excuse or some reason
[1:31:12] or why you think it's needed
[1:31:14] just stay with the word
[1:31:16] amen stay with the word you can't go
[1:31:20] wrong stay with the word
[1:31:22] if you let the devil begin to reason
[1:31:23] with you
[1:31:25] well this shouldn't have been and this
[1:31:27] was wrong and this has got to be you
[1:31:29] know somebody's got to do something
[1:31:30] about it really
[1:31:34] I think God has called us to the defense
[1:31:36] of the Gospel not the offense
[1:31:40] take a look at the Beatitudes a little
[1:31:42] bit we see in the Beatitudes boy time is
[1:31:46] just
[1:31:46] drifting so quickly
[1:31:50] we see that there's many Rewards or
[1:31:52] blessings
[1:31:53] that come from those who accept their
[1:31:57] Heavenly responsibilities is that true
[1:32:01] Matthew chapter 5.
[1:32:07] now I'll say it like this
[1:32:09] love the word
[1:32:10] love the word I'm going to go a little
[1:32:12] extra because
[1:32:14] um our brother Orlando he came in late
[1:32:16] and I just want to go over through these
[1:32:17] things so
[1:32:19] God bless our brother for pressing in
[1:32:22] and making it it just I'll tell you that
[1:32:25] ministers to me
[1:32:27] that ministers to me choosing the harder
[1:32:29] way but you see in the Beatitudes here
[1:32:31] he's talking about the the uh the the
[1:32:34] blessed are those are poor in spirit
[1:32:36] that that mourn that that are Meek that
[1:32:39] that hunger and thirst for God that are
[1:32:42] um that are merciful that are pure in
[1:32:44] heart that are the peacemakers he's
[1:32:46] speaking to all these who are blessed
[1:32:49] who do them but you notice that those
[1:32:51] things are the harder way
[1:32:53] it's much harder to be merciful than to
[1:32:55] just say it's just like it was reap what
[1:32:57] you sow
[1:32:58] you deserve that I told you I warned you
[1:33:04] it's it's this when he's speaking these
[1:33:07] beautiful Beatitudes it is the harder
[1:33:10] way
[1:33:11] it's so hard it's much harder to be meek
[1:33:13] when you just want to be loud and tell
[1:33:15] everybody you know who you are what you
[1:33:17] know and all this that and the other
[1:33:20] so it's the harder way and look what he
[1:33:23] says here
[1:33:24] in verse
[1:33:25] number nine okay blessed are the
[1:33:29] peacemakers
[1:33:30] for they shall be called the children of
[1:33:33] God
[1:33:34] now a peacemaker let's just say that
[1:33:37] brother Mark has a problem
[1:33:40] with Brother Joseph Ben
[1:33:44] and um
[1:33:46] a peacemaker doesn't come and say all
[1:33:49] right
[1:33:51] I know you'll give me Grace for saying
[1:33:53] this
[1:33:54] brother Mark you're wrong Brother Joseph
[1:33:56] Ben you're right that is not a
[1:33:58] peacemaker
[1:34:00] that's someone that's stating what's
[1:34:02] right or wrong
[1:34:03] a peacemaker honestly a peacemaker never
[1:34:08] ever finds
[1:34:10] uh
[1:34:12] uh
[1:34:13] the appreciation or gratitude by either
[1:34:17] party
[1:34:20] because both have to give up something
[1:34:23] because if they didn't
[1:34:25] if they didn't then the one who didn't
[1:34:28] have to do it
[1:34:30] would be able to make peace himself
[1:34:33] but you've got to humble yourself under
[1:34:35] your brother who's wrong
[1:34:37] you've got to get underneath you've got
[1:34:39] to wash their feet you you've got to
[1:34:41] with neatness
[1:34:45] and if you're not willing to do that
[1:34:49] then you can't make peace it's part of
[1:34:52] getting the peace
[1:34:54] and so this is the harder way
[1:34:57] all right go with me here verse number
[1:34:59] nine blessed are the peacemakers okay
[1:35:02] verse 10 blessed are they which are
[1:35:04] persecuted for righteousness sake for
[1:35:07] theirs is the kingdom of heaven heaven
[1:35:11] not for a living your way but for a
[1:35:15] living God's way
[1:35:18] who in their right mind would want to go
[1:35:21] through persecution
[1:35:23] blessed are they which are persecuted
[1:35:25] for righteousness sake you know a lot of
[1:35:27] times we get persecuted for our own
[1:35:29] mistakes but to go ahead and just you
[1:35:31] know go out there and you know you're
[1:35:32] going to get persecuted for it
[1:35:35] but you're blessed for doing it
[1:35:38] even though you're not getting anything
[1:35:40] at that moment
[1:35:41] even though you don't feel good about it
[1:35:43] but look at here it is blessed are ye
[1:35:46] when men shall revile you and persecute
[1:35:48] you and say all manner of evil against
[1:35:51] you falsely for my sake
[1:35:56] for my sake
[1:36:00] Pierce if you're trying to win souls and
[1:36:03] through this of of winning Souls you're
[1:36:06] going to get persecuted because the
[1:36:08] devil don't want you doing it that's why
[1:36:10] the persecution's coming
[1:36:13] but if you're you're you're going to win
[1:36:16] souls because that's really what the
[1:36:18] Christ's sake is that's what the the
[1:36:20] sake of the Gospel is
[1:36:22] that's why we hear it that's why Paul
[1:36:24] shared it with everyone was to win some
[1:36:27] Souls
[1:36:28] and if you're going to be sharing the
[1:36:30] gospel with others you're going to be
[1:36:32] persecuted you're going to be reviled
[1:36:34] you're going to be defamed you're you're
[1:36:37] going to get people
[1:36:39] saying evil things about you they're
[1:36:42] going to chide you they're going to
[1:36:43] taunt you they're going to rail against
[1:36:45] you
[1:36:46] you're going to go through persecutions
[1:36:48] people are going to say all manner of
[1:36:50] evil why because it's the harder way
[1:36:55] he said rejoice and be exceedingly glad
[1:36:57] for great is your reward in heaven
[1:37:00] notice where the reward comes
[1:37:03] for soul persecuted they the prophets
[1:37:05] which were before you
[1:37:07] see don't you think it would be an honor
[1:37:10] to be persecuted just like the prophets
[1:37:12] were
[1:37:13] amen
[1:37:15] I just believe it would be an honor
[1:37:18] and that's what Paul had that's what
[1:37:20] Moses had they they counted that a
[1:37:24] greater value to them
[1:37:27] than anything they could have gained
[1:37:28] without the persecution
[1:37:32] I just love the scriptures I say be like
[1:37:35] Moses choose the harder way
[1:37:38] choose to suffer Affliction with the
[1:37:41] real people of God
[1:37:42] than to enjoy some Pleasures for a
[1:37:45] season
[1:37:46] choose the reproach of Christ a greater
[1:37:49] value than all the riches that you can
[1:37:51] have
[1:37:52] keep your eyes on the reward that comes
[1:37:54] in the next life get a vision
[1:37:57] people who can't see beyond this aren't
[1:38:00] willing to do anything here
[1:38:02] if all you're going to do is work for a
[1:38:04] reward here you're not you're
[1:38:06] you won't be doing very much
[1:38:09] for Christ
[1:38:15] I I I believe this
[1:38:17] why did God why why did all in the Bible
[1:38:21] it was always the harder way the
[1:38:24] disciples Paul Moses why
[1:38:27] because God's way is higher than our way
[1:38:29] his thoughts are higher than our
[1:38:30] thoughts
[1:38:31] and and we don't see the way he sees we
[1:38:34] don't comprehend the way he does and
[1:38:37] Satan is always trying to with our human
[1:38:39] intellect and our human understanding to
[1:38:41] show us that there's an easier way to
[1:38:43] serve God especially in this Modern Age
[1:38:47] maybe a more intellectual more more uh
[1:38:50] you know you just go and you say the
[1:38:51] word to somebody and and and and if
[1:38:54] they're seed you know what do you need a
[1:38:56] life for
[1:38:57] just get them put them in a headlock
[1:38:59] play Push
[1:39:01] tape let him hear it let go if that's
[1:39:04] what it is no God wanted the World to
[1:39:09] See Jesus and Paul
[1:39:11] and God wants the world our world
[1:39:15] whoever we're around
[1:39:16] to see Christ in US amen
[1:39:22] all who choose the harder way
[1:39:25] is going to Bear the reproach of being a
[1:39:27] Christian look at Mary
[1:39:30] she bore a reproach
[1:39:35] she was persecuted for carrying a child
[1:39:38] without being married
[1:39:41] and then she had to bear that reproach
[1:39:43] all through her life even though the
[1:39:47] baby was born and to some
[1:39:50] who believed
[1:39:52] who who had a revelation this was a work
[1:39:54] of God
[1:39:56] but think about the Millions
[1:39:59] who knew about it
[1:40:01] who weren't who were who were Jews or
[1:40:05] whoever they were that did not would not
[1:40:07] believe she had to bear that reproach
[1:40:09] every time she went to the store and
[1:40:13] but that was of a greater value to her
[1:40:17] all the things that she went through
[1:40:20] having an illegitimate child
[1:40:23] yet God said she was highly favored
[1:40:26] she was blessed among women
[1:40:29] I'll tell you what she went through
[1:40:30] doesn't sound like it's highly favored
[1:40:32] to me
[1:40:33] a daughter sent this to me yesterday I
[1:40:35] just wanted to read it to you
[1:40:38] she was highly favored speaking of Mary
[1:40:41] but was almost put away by the man that
[1:40:43] she loved the most
[1:40:45] highly favored but she rejected by every
[1:40:50] person in Bethlehem
[1:40:52] highly favored but she laid on the dirt
[1:40:55] floor of a barn and gave birth to a baby
[1:40:57] she carried nine months
[1:40:59] highly favored but in the middle of the
[1:41:01] night had to leave all that she knew and
[1:41:04] moved to a strange city because God said
[1:41:06] so
[1:41:08] favor never looks like favor
[1:41:11] at first
[1:41:13] favor sometimes takes you through
[1:41:15] frustrations and failure and fear
[1:41:18] you want to be favored of God it may be
[1:41:22] the darkest night the deepest valley but
[1:41:24] they're in that place where no one sees
[1:41:27] you you will feel no one understands
[1:41:31] but hear a whisper to yourself
[1:41:33] this is only the beginning not the end
[1:41:37] this will turn out for your good and His
[1:41:40] glory because you're highly favored
[1:41:45] and we got to look at the end
[1:41:49] you got to look at the end I think you
[1:41:51] know Mary's life wasn't like she was
[1:41:53] some crown queen of of everyone
[1:41:58] it wasn't like that it's on the other
[1:42:00] side
[1:42:02] we got to keep
[1:42:03] our eyes on the reward that's going to
[1:42:06] come on the other side
[1:42:08] now God has choices as well as I'm
[1:42:10] closing up just please just a couple
[1:42:13] more minutes if you will bear with me
[1:42:16] God has choices as well he makes choices
[1:42:18] he's choosing a bride brother bran gave
[1:42:20] that message just like he chose Mary
[1:42:23] and I believe he's choosing a bride out
[1:42:25] of all the Believers who have chosen to
[1:42:27] go the harder way I believe that
[1:42:30] now they're ordained before the
[1:42:32] foundation where God knows who that they
[1:42:34] are predestined but I believe it is that
[1:42:36] group who will not be deceived who will
[1:42:38] go the harder way
[1:42:41] and God has chosen to reward those who
[1:42:44] choose to walk the hard way
[1:42:48] those who make the choice not to go the
[1:42:51] easy way those who make the choice not
[1:42:54] to persecute but to allow
[1:42:57] to be persecuted
[1:42:59] remember when Jesus was reviled he
[1:43:01] reviled not again not back
[1:43:05] he will reward you with a catching away
[1:43:08] with a Rapture with a wedding with
[1:43:11] sitting with them on the throne and we
[1:43:13] need to keep our eyes on that reward you
[1:43:15] need to be thinking about the people
[1:43:17] that you spoke to here even if it's just
[1:43:21] one that comes up to you on the other
[1:43:23] side and says I wouldn't have made it
[1:43:25] without you
[1:43:27] because nothing else down here matters
[1:43:31] just the souls that you will win to him
[1:43:35] look I can encourage a lot of people
[1:43:37] and I can help a lot of people and I can
[1:43:39] give to a lot of people but I'll tell
[1:43:42] you when it gets on the other side the
[1:43:43] only thing that's going to matter is the
[1:43:45] souls that have been won
[1:43:48] because that's so
[1:43:50] it will be there because of you and
[1:43:52] think about that think about that
[1:43:54] statement they that win souls is wise
[1:43:58] that's the harder way and to really win
[1:44:01] somebody you got to be willing to give
[1:44:03] up your time give up your resources give
[1:44:05] up what you have to see that person get
[1:44:07] to a a new birth or a regeneration a new
[1:44:11] nature to where his life has changed
[1:44:13] that's how we know that they're going to
[1:44:16] be there
[1:44:18] choose the harder way Enoch chose to
[1:44:21] walk the harder way every day and look
[1:44:23] it got him a private rapture
[1:44:26] brother Brandon chose the heart away and
[1:44:30] and God told him a huge portion of
[1:44:33] Heaven awaits him
[1:44:35] it wasn't because he was he spoke as a
[1:44:38] great minister
[1:44:40] no it was because he chose the harder
[1:44:42] way
[1:44:44] last scripture here in Romans chapter 8
[1:44:46] verse 15 or chapter eight yeah verse 15
[1:44:49] through 19 and I'm closing
[1:44:54] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:44:56] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:44:58] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:45:00] we're crying Abba Father
[1:45:04] so I'll tell you just get rid of any
[1:45:08] fear don't have it part of your life the
[1:45:11] spirit itself and I'll tell you there's
[1:45:13] a big fear about going the harder way
[1:45:22] but God's in that way so there's nothing
[1:45:24] to fear
[1:45:25] the spirit itself bear with witness with
[1:45:27] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:45:29] God
[1:45:30] and if children then we're heirs Heirs
[1:45:33] of God and Joint heirs with Christ we're
[1:45:35] looking at a reward right now
[1:45:38] if so be that we suffer with him
[1:45:41] that we may be also glorified together
[1:45:45] right doesn't the scripture say if we
[1:45:47] don't suffer we don't reign right for I
[1:45:50] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:45:52] present time are not worthy to be
[1:45:55] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:45:57] revealed in US
[1:45:59] so now here is you know Paul's telling
[1:46:01] us don't look at what you're going
[1:46:03] through down here it is not worthy to be
[1:46:06] comparative it's a much greater value or
[1:46:09] with the glory that's going to be
[1:46:11] revealed on the other side
[1:46:14] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:46:17] creature wadeth for the manifestations
[1:46:20] of the sons of God
[1:46:23] amen may God just so put his holy ghost
[1:46:28] inside inside of us that we can become a
[1:46:31] completely manifested Son of God
[1:46:34] amen let's Stand Together
[1:46:36] thank you for your patience this morning
[1:46:43] to each and every one of you
[1:46:47] choose to walk
[1:46:49] the harder way
[1:46:53] amen
[1:46:55] I know the Lord will make a way for me
[1:46:58] let's sing that little chorus
[1:47:03] [Music]
[1:47:05] Lord will make a way
[1:47:09] for me
[1:47:13] I know the Lord Lord will make a way for
[1:47:19] me
[1:47:22] if I live a holy life
[1:47:27] shun the wrong and do the right I know
[1:47:32] the Lord will make a way for me let's
[1:47:37] just say that a couple of times
[1:47:39] I know the Lord will make a way for me
[1:47:48] I know the Lord will make a way for me
[1:47:56] if I live a holy life
[1:48:00] shun the wrong and do the right I know
[1:48:05] the Lord will make a way for me
[1:48:12] I know the Lord will make a way for amen
[1:48:18] we are as chosen I know the Lord will
[1:48:23] make a way for me
[1:48:29] if I live a holy light shine the wrong
[1:48:34] and do the right I know the Lord will
[1:48:39] make a way
[1:48:40] for me
[1:48:43] amen as she continues to play that if we
[1:48:47] could just look to the Lord in a word of
[1:48:49] Prayer
[1:48:50] [Music]
