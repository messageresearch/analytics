[36:08] saying to us this morning Father we
[36:11] commit the service into your hands we

[36:19] come forth with Revelation to every
[36:22] heart we pray we'll give you praise for
[36:25] this now in advance as we wait
[36:26] furtherance on thee in the name of the
[36:29] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen am amen
[36:33] turn with me if if you would to uh first
[36:36] John chapter 3 we have actually three
[36:39] scripture
[36:40] readings before we have you be seated
[36:44] the first is in 1 John chapter
[36:49] 3 second is going to be Matthew 24 and
[36:52] the last is going to be Revelations
[36:54] chapter 19 I want to entitled this
[36:57] message making ourselves
[37:01] ready making ourselves ready kind of
[37:04] putting the
[37:06] responsibility on
[37:08] us first John chapter 3 starting with
[37:11] verse number one verses 1
[37:14] through3 be behold what manner of love
[37:18] the father have bestowed upon us that we
[37:21] should be called the sons of
[37:24] God therefore the world knoweth us not
[37:26] because it knew him not that's right
[37:30] beloved now are we the sons of God and
[37:32] it doth not yet appear what we shall
[37:35] be but we know that when he shall appear
[37:38] we shall be like
[37:40] him for we shall see him like he is and
[37:45] every man that have this hope in him
[37:48] purifieth himself even as he is
[37:52] pure amen now Matthew chapter 24
[37:59] what manner of love when we think of God
[38:02] we think of
[38:04] love and we're going to be just like him
[38:07] when he appears that means we're going
[38:09] to be of that same
[38:11] love and each one of us that has that
[38:14] hope is purifying himself now they're
[38:17] getting themselves ready amen Matthew 24
[38:22] and verse
[38:25] 44 therefore be ye also ready for in
[38:30] such an hour as ye think not the son of
[38:34] man
[38:35] cometh amen those are great words of
[38:41] warning from the Lord Jesus Christ to us
[38:44] today and then Revelations chapter 19
[38:48] for our last verse before you're seated
[38:51] Revelations Chapter
[38:53] 19 Verse number 7 let us be glad and
[38:57] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[39:01] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[39:05] wife have made herself
[39:07] ready God bless you may be
[39:15] seated um this
[39:19] morning uh
[39:21] before when you got out of
[39:24] bed um maybe you took your jammies off
[39:29] and then you put your church clothes
[39:30] on because you wanted to prepare
[39:33] yourself for
[39:37] church amen does anybody else agree with
[39:39] that
[39:40] statement
[39:43] okay when it comes to the rapture we
[39:47] have certain things that we have to put
[39:49] off in our nature right and there's
[39:52] certain things that we have to put on so
[39:54] we can be ready for the
[39:57] Rapture now many Believers are leaving
[40:00] it totally up to God for them to get
[40:03] ready they're just putting it all on God
[40:06] it'll be by the grace of God that I'll
[40:08] make the Rapture so their mentality is
[40:11] it's all on God and I if I could say
[40:14] this if we could just look at the
[40:15] children of Israel I believe they had
[40:17] that attitude right because see God took
[40:21] them out of Egypt they didn't have to do
[40:24] nothing God did all the work
[40:28] amen and so they came out and they had
[40:31] that same attitude about the promised
[40:34] land that God was just going to drive
[40:36] out the enemy and then and and God's
[40:39] just going to give him the promised land
[40:41] but this is where it
[40:43] changed God expected them to move in and
[40:48] move out the things that shouldn't be
[40:51] there before they inherited it and it
[40:54] takes Faith to do that and I believe
[40:57] that we've got to to take out the enemy
[41:00] to get into the promised land for what
[41:03] God really has for
[41:05] us now God has already provided a
[41:08] message for us in this hour to dress
[41:11] us and I believe the Bride of of
[41:15] Christ is re has received the message
[41:18] and is receiving the message and there's
[41:20] an invisible Union that's going on right
[41:22] now on the
[41:24] planet you you can't necess neily be
[41:26] seen outwardly but but God is coming
[41:29] into the heart of his bride and is
[41:32] changing the literal nature that she has
[41:35] into the same image of Jesus
[41:38] Christ the wise virgin she's digging
[41:41] into the message and she's becoming the
[41:43] message she's laying aside everything
[41:46] else to go after that perfect love
[41:48] because she knows that she's going to
[41:50] have to have that same manner of love
[41:52] that God has bestowed upon her she's
[41:54] going to have to have that back for for
[41:57] him while the foolish virgins are living
[42:01] with the
[42:02] attitude that they already have enough
[42:05] to make it because they're in the
[42:06] message
[42:07] see they're all ready to go they're
[42:09] already predestinated and that that
[42:11] mentality keeps them from going on and
[42:15] getting more of the Holy Ghost which is
[42:18] the the actual life of God is the Holy
[42:21] Ghost we're allware we're living in the
[42:24] most dangerous hour of all time amen
[42:28] just if you look out there the the whole
[42:30] world's going insane am the whole world
[42:33] has become deceived in one fashion form
[42:35] or way of or another and it doesn't seem
[42:39] uh to be getting like leveling
[42:41] out I I I really think the train has
[42:45] gone over the hill and it is going
[42:50] down along with the world the church
[42:53] world is deceived
[42:57] and the worldly church is deceived as
[43:00] well we're living in perilous times or
[43:02] dangerous
[43:04] times on April 30th of this year I
[43:08] preached a message ready or not here I
[43:11] come I just want to quote one thing from
[43:13] that
[43:14] message they asked brother bran the
[43:17] question is it possible for a person to
[43:19] be lost and end up in hell if they
[43:21] reject the light of the word even
[43:25] though he was genu he had a genuine
[43:28] experience of justification and
[43:32] sanctification and brother brand made it
[43:34] real simple real clear yes sir that's
[43:37] exactly
[43:38] right that's
[43:43] scary so no matter what experience we
[43:46] got when God wants to give us new light
[43:50] right more word that He is wanting us to
[43:54] do amen maybe revealed more of the
[43:56] message maybe reveal more of the
[43:58] word if we don't walk into that
[44:02] light how can we be part of the
[44:04] rapture we can't rely on a past
[44:07] experience or a a a a past work of Grace
[44:11] that God has done in their
[44:13] life I mean think about the children of
[44:15] Israel when they were trying to go into
[44:17] the promised land they didn't say hey
[44:18] you you know you you took us out of
[44:20] Egypt you know shouldn't you give us
[44:22] that we we should still about to go God
[44:25] requires them to do something and it
[44:27] took faith and it's going to take Faith
[44:29] for us to make a Rapture I believe that
[44:31] amen so it takes more to get ready than
[44:34] we realize we've got to be
[44:36] Overcomers just like the children of
[44:38] Israel had overcome and they didn't want
[44:41] to we have to overcome so whether we
[44:44] want to or not we have to amen Jesus
[44:48] said to him that overcometh why I grant
[44:50] to sit with me on my Throne now who is
[44:52] sitting with Jesus on the throne the
[44:56] bride the bride nobody else not the
[44:59] church not those that just do
[45:02] 90% but the bride he chooses the
[45:06] bride now we've got two great enemies to
[45:10] overcome two great
[45:13] enemies to make ourselves ready amen and
[45:17] one of them is the
[45:20] devil he deceiveth the whole
[45:24] world he's the accuser of the
[45:27] brother he's the one that's behind every
[45:30] terrible thing that
[45:32] happens he's the one that lies to us
[45:36] he's the one that tries to deceive us
[45:38] he's the one that gets us to sin we've
[45:41] got to overcome
[45:42] him but then there's another
[45:45] enemy and that is Us in fact brother
[45:49] brandham said that enemy was his
[45:53] greatest enemy amen more than Satan yes
[45:56] and if you notice the only way that we
[45:58] can overcome Satan is by overcoming
[46:03] ourselves right he overcame them with
[46:05] the the blood of the Lamb with the word
[46:07] of their testimony and they love not
[46:09] their lives even until the death so
[46:12] we've got to overcome ourselves to
[46:14] overcome the
[46:15] enemy but God has told us greater is he
[46:18] that's in you than he that's in the
[46:21] world I trust our hearts are prepared
[46:23] this morning that God really
[46:28] God's word can come and find a dwelling
[46:30] place inside our
[46:32] hearts well too many Believers think
[46:35] they're ready enough because they've
[46:36] been baptized they've cleaned up some
[46:38] things in their life they've they've
[46:40] maybe perhaps stopped smoking or or
[46:42] drinking or something like that and that
[46:45] they're they're set because they they
[46:47] always compare themselves with
[46:50] something uh that that that that that
[46:53] was worse than their state and we're
[46:56] thankful for uh for growth taking place
[47:02] but that growth taking place doesn't
[47:04] mean we stop
[47:06] growing and it's it's it's it's a
[47:08] dangerous attitude to feel that I'm I'm
[47:12] I'm pretty good right now it's okay to
[47:16] say greater is he that's in me but it's
[47:18] not good to say I'm pretty good right
[47:21] now I I I feel that I'm
[47:24] I'm I'm worse
[47:26] today than I was back when I first gave
[47:29] my heart to the Lord now why do you say
[47:30] that brother John well when I gave my
[47:32] heart to the Lord I didn't know nothing
[47:35] except I was just I'm not I'm going to
[47:38] hell if I don't give my heart to
[47:40] God but now he's given me so many
[47:42] opportunities from then till now what
[47:45] have I done with my time how faithful
[47:48] have I been to his
[47:50] word have I been as faithful to him as I
[47:54] should it's a dangerous attitude to have
[47:58] 1 John chapter 1 if you like to follow
[48:00] me there 1 John chapter 1 verse number
[48:04] five this then is the message which we
[48:07] have heard of him and declare unto you
[48:10] what is the great message that God is
[48:14] light and in him is no Darkness at all
[48:19] now we're supposed to become like him
[48:21] we're going to see him as he is we're
[48:23] going to be just like him that means in
[48:25] us there's going to have to be no
[48:27] Darkness at
[48:30] all now this is a hard thing to perhaps
[48:35] accept to see how it can be done but
[48:37] we've got to start with the attitude
[48:40] that that's what God is requiring with
[48:42] me and I must take this serious am God
[48:46] doesn't want any darkness in our lives
[48:49] and and the way that we make ourselves
[48:52] ready is start dealing with those things
[48:55] God is not looking for something perfect
[48:58] because there it doesn't
[48:59] exist humanity is full of flaws and
[49:03] Frailty but he is looking for a heart
[49:06] that desires to be like him serious
[49:09] about it verse number six if we say that
[49:12] we have fellowship with him look I got a
[49:15] I I got a I got a a walk with
[49:20] God but we walk in
[49:23] darkness we lie
[49:26] and do not the truth
[49:29] amen so what do we do with this H who
[49:31] who's walking in the
[49:36] light I mean don't you feel that each
[49:39] one of us need to take a good look at
[49:42] this really has nothing to do about what
[49:43] church we're going to or or or anybody
[49:46] else in the church it really has to do
[49:48] with Where I Am with You Lord
[49:54] amen the whole
[49:56] Church world out there saying oh yeah I
[49:57] have fellowship with God I I walk with
[49:59] God I go to church and but are they
[50:01] walking in the
[50:03] light so when God gives us light I
[50:06] believe that God is expecting us to walk
[50:07] in it it's an expectation that God has
[50:11] verse seven but if we walk in the light
[50:14] as he is in the
[50:16] light then we have fellowship with one
[50:20] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[50:23] his son cleanses us from from all
[50:27] sin so we think about this if I don't if
[50:30] I don't forgive you the trespass that
[50:33] you have that you did against me God
[50:36] will not forgive
[50:38] me his blood won't cover me won't
[50:41] cleanse me so the light of the word is
[50:44] I've got to forgive you even though I
[50:46] didn't cause the problem
[50:50] amen so God has an expectation that we
[50:53] walk in his word True Fellowship with
[50:56] one another I'm going to be honest with
[50:58] you is when we're walking in the word
[51:01] you know how it is when you're a
[51:03] Believer you believe the word you're
[51:04] talking to somebody that don't believe
[51:06] the word that Fellowship no matter how
[51:08] much of a friend you may be with them in
[51:10] the world there is a dividing
[51:16] line and True Fellowship is when you're
[51:19] fellowshipping with somebody whose heart
[51:22] is is doing everything they can to walk
[51:24] in all the of God's word that's true
[51:26] Fellowship am anything outside of that
[51:30] it is broken
[51:32] amen now the bride will be taken from
[51:35] all seven Church ages
[51:38] amen
[51:41] right we could almost
[51:43] say there's Catholics that were saved
[51:48] out of out of Luther's
[51:54] time and all they had to do was believe
[51:59] that God is the one that saves them that
[52:02] it's not by works that there's no other
[52:05] mediator between God and man except the
[52:07] man Christ
[52:09] Jesus that had to believe in the grace
[52:13] of God for their
[52:14] salvation and that true Faith does lift
[52:18] the burden of sin just like it did on
[52:21] Martin
[52:24] Luther
[52:26] fortunately for them they didn't have to
[52:29] worry about
[52:31] sanctification they didn't have to worry
[52:34] about the gifts or the the baptism of
[52:36] the Holy Ghost and they certainly didn't
[52:38] have to worry about this end time
[52:41] message where all the word is being
[52:43] restored but yet there will be part of
[52:46] that bride will be from that
[52:49] age this age is by far the hardest of
[52:53] every age because all the word has been
[52:57] restored in this age that's what God
[53:00] sent the message for was to restore the
[53:03] entire word right so in this age it's
[53:08] harder for us to be just like him than
[53:11] it was in Luther's age to be just like
[53:16] him we cannot sit around and saying well
[53:19] I've got this I've got this I've got
[53:20] this I everything should I should be
[53:23] good we can't do that
[53:28] your your Bullseye your
[53:31] goal what you've been predestinated to
[53:34] is to be in His image right you can't
[53:36] put it all on
[53:38] God the bride makes herself ready the
[53:41] wife makes herself ready you have a part
[53:44] to play you have a part to play where
[53:46] you you you take off that which you
[53:49] would shouldn't be there that that your
[53:50] first
[53:52] nature that has to be taken off amen and
[53:55] you have to be dressed in the nature of
[53:57] God now God can only give you his nature
[54:01] that can only come through the Holy
[54:02] Ghost but if you don't get serious about
[54:06] God I I need you to deliver me of this
[54:09] old Wretched Man who's always trying to
[54:12] just have his selfish way through the
[54:14] course of the day and just go to church
[54:16] twice a week and feel that's all he
[54:17] needs to do I need to be delivered of
[54:19] that
[54:23] Lord let's look carefully at Matthew
[54:26] chapter 24 I want to read some some
[54:29] scriptures in here starting with verse
[54:31] number
[54:33] 42 Matthew 24:42 Jesus really speaking
[54:38] to us you know I I I got thinking about
[54:41] this and I don't know if I'll end up
[54:42] doing this but you know there's a lot of
[54:44] things that Jesus spoke and that he was
[54:47] actually speaking to us and he wasn't
[54:49] speaking to his disciples
[54:51] then but he spoke him to his disciples
[54:54] so it could be written and then we could
[54:56] hear it so he's speaking to the last
[54:59] hour and he says watch therefore in
[55:02] verse 42 for ye know not what hour your
[55:05] lord doth
[55:07] come but know this that if the good man
[55:10] of the house had known in what watch the
[55:12] thief would come he would have watched
[55:15] and would have not suffered his house to
[55:17] be broken up now I'm being honest with
[55:21] you we you all left your home and and no
[55:25] body else is there right but if you knew
[55:28] you had an
[55:30] inside word somebody was going to come
[55:33] to your house and break in when you were
[55:35] at church no doubt you would have stayed
[55:38] home maybe called for
[55:42] backup because you
[55:46] know I believe the bride knows the hour
[55:49] that this is the hour that he's
[55:54] coming
[55:55] God is longsuffering he's not willing
[55:57] that any should perish but should come
[55:59] to
[56:00] repentance but Peter said that the day
[56:03] of the Lord will come as a thief in the
[56:08] night he's not going to announce it to
[56:11] everybody I don't believe he's going to
[56:13] announce it to the bride I don't believe
[56:15] he's going to be saying oh by the way
[56:19] I'm coming in a week from
[56:22] now he wants to see if they really want
[56:25] to be his bride that they're going to
[56:27] live for
[56:28] him that they they're going to please
[56:31] him and do his will prior to the
[56:35] announcement so we're living in the
[56:37] night that Peter was referring to this
[56:40] is the hour that the bride is looking
[56:42] for her
[56:44] groom and she's not
[56:46] thinking oh I know he's coming but it's
[56:50] a little bit down the
[56:52] road come on these are not words that we
[56:55] say these are feelings we
[56:57] feel these are thoughts we
[57:01] think which is not from heaven right
[57:04] verse 44 therefore be ye also ready for
[57:07] in such hour as you think
[57:10] not the son of man
[57:13] cometh I want to just talk to the heads
[57:15] of the church for a second the heads of
[57:17] the families if you're ahead so I'm
[57:20] talking to you men
[57:23] fathers
[57:25] verse 45 for who then is a faithful in a
[57:29] wise servant who his Lord have made
[57:32] ruler over his household to give them
[57:36] meat in due season I want to say to you
[57:40] fathers you you you husbands um are you
[57:44] giving your family the spiritual food in
[57:47] due season that they need to make a
[57:49] Rapture I that's just an honest
[57:53] question
[57:58] are you feeding them the food that's
[58:00] going to make them ready for his
[58:06] coming you can't be putting this on the
[58:09] pastor I'm sorry you can't you can't be
[58:11] putting that on pushing
[58:14] play I want to speak to us all as as
[58:16] individuals now I'm including the
[58:18] sisters I'm including the
[58:22] children the Lord made each and every
[58:24] every one of us a ruler over this our
[58:26] household right here amen so have you
[58:29] been a faithful and wise servant are you
[58:33] feeding yourself with the spiritual food
[58:36] that God has set in this hour to get us
[58:38] ready for his coming
[58:42] yes or have we been caught up with the
[58:45] cares of this
[58:48] life because we're not going to be ready
[58:53] if we allow ourselves to to be caught up
[58:56] Jesus said in Luke 21:34 and take heed
[58:59] to yourselves lest at any time your
[59:01] hearts be overcharge with surfing
[59:03] drunkenness and the cares of this life
[59:05] and so that day come upon you
[59:09] unaware for as a snare shall it come on
[59:12] all them that dwell on the face of the
[59:14] whole earth not just
[59:17] America watch ye therefore and pray
[59:20] always that you may be counted worthy to
[59:23] escape all those things things that
[59:25] shall come to pass and stand before the
[59:27] son of
[59:29] man I
[59:31] believe the wife of Christ that made
[59:34] herself Worthy is the
[59:37] one that made herself ready is the one
[59:40] that's worthy to escape these
[59:43] things so we got our our part to
[59:46] play and I wish I could say you know
[59:49] just come just come faithful to church
[59:51] you know just give your tithes and you
[59:52] know you know what everything's going to
[59:54] be okay
[59:55] he the moment I say that you better
[59:57] March me out these
[1:00:02] doors because that's not what the word
[1:00:05] says verse 45 who then is a faithful and
[1:00:10] wise servant whom his Lord have made him
[1:00:13] ruler over his household to give them
[1:00:15] meat in due
[1:00:18] season oh I love that be mindful of what
[1:00:22] your family needs be mindful of what
[1:00:24] your body
[1:00:25] needs your soul feeds on the things of
[1:00:28] God Amen blessed is that servant whom
[1:00:32] his Lord when he cometh shall find so
[1:00:35] doing amen blessed is that
[1:00:38] servant verily I saying to you that he
[1:00:42] shall make him ruler over all his Goods
[1:00:47] I wonder who sitting with Jesus Christ
[1:00:51] on the
[1:00:53] throne
[1:00:55] it's this wise
[1:00:58] servant who was taking the spiritual
[1:01:01] food in the due season for his coming
[1:01:05] and getting ready it's no longer you got
[1:01:08] to get Way Beyond I believe the message
[1:01:12] you got to get Way Beyond it that
[1:01:14] message has got to sink inside your body
[1:01:16] and you've got to start manifesting
[1:01:18] things that that message had brought to
[1:01:22] us that's how we make ourselves ready we
[1:01:25] watch we pray we we stay spiritually in
[1:01:28] tune he's coming that's for
[1:01:35] sure but it's the
[1:01:38] word that gives us what we
[1:01:41] need to be manifest to
[1:01:45] manifest it's not our favorite song it's
[1:01:48] not our favorite scripture it's not our
[1:01:50] our our our our favorite
[1:01:53] encouragement that word is what we are
[1:01:56] to
[1:01:57] become and God is the bride is making
[1:02:02] herself ready by taking the word the
[1:02:04] word this Bible from cover to
[1:02:07] cover and
[1:02:09] saying it's important to God it's got to
[1:02:11] be important to
[1:02:13] me now John the Baptist was sent to
[1:02:16] prepare the way of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:19] he was a voice that cried in the
[1:02:20] wilderness preparing those who would
[1:02:24] hear
[1:02:26] here he prepared the way of the Lord he
[1:02:30] made it clear that Jesus is coming and
[1:02:34] we need to get
[1:02:36] ready now there were Snakes in the
[1:02:40] Grass but there were those that were
[1:02:43] ordained to hear Jesus Christ and I I'd
[1:02:46] like to say if they didn't hear John the
[1:02:48] Baptist's message they probably wouldn't
[1:02:50] hear Jesus's message
[1:02:53] either now when Esther was making
[1:02:55] herself ready to be the Bride of King
[1:03:00] hazeroth the Bible says that she
[1:03:03] required nothing but what the king's
[1:03:06] Chamberlain had appointed her to have to
[1:03:08] get ready right so whatever the king's
[1:03:11] servant had
[1:03:14] said that's what she took and you know
[1:03:16] the Bible says that she found favor
[1:03:20] inside of The
[1:03:21] King and I believe because she did what
[1:03:24] the message told her to
[1:03:27] do I don't know if you realize but a lot
[1:03:30] of us when we
[1:03:32] take uh a
[1:03:35] bath and we want to get real cleaned up
[1:03:38] and we put in uh what's that stuff you
[1:03:42] put in your bathtub Mr bub Mr Bubble
[1:03:46] that we know that's from quite a few
[1:03:49] days ago and uh but there's uh all all
[1:03:52] sorts of epson salts with lavend door
[1:03:55] and all these uh things that turn into a
[1:03:59] bubble
[1:04:00] bath and um you know sometimes we'll
[1:04:04] we'll be in there for an hour and say
[1:04:07] whoa that was a long time I must be
[1:04:10] pretty
[1:04:12] clean but when Esther was getting clean
[1:04:15] she needed more than an
[1:04:18] hour can you
[1:04:21] imagine 12 months of
[1:04:27] purification now when I think about that
[1:04:29] I think that's a little little overdoing
[1:04:31] it don't you think
[1:04:33] King but it it was a type for
[1:04:37] us this purification isn't just I I got
[1:04:41] baptized and I'm trying to do the right
[1:04:42] thing
[1:04:44] now you got to keep on going he that has
[1:04:48] this whole purifies himself even as he
[1:04:50] already is pure but he still keeps going
[1:04:53] because he knows his vision is going to
[1:04:55] be just like
[1:05:01] Jesus God has sent a message
[1:05:06] today I'll tell you without the message
[1:05:08] I wouldn't know the Bible amen you talk
[1:05:11] to you talk to the greatest Scholars
[1:05:14] that there is that knows this Bible if
[1:05:16] they don't know this this message I'm
[1:05:18] telling you you know a lot more than
[1:05:19] they do that is the truth and it doesn't
[1:05:22] matter the age of the child that's
[1:05:25] right there's just something missing I
[1:05:27] could see why God had to sent a
[1:05:30] prophet said behold I send you Elijah
[1:05:33] the prophet before the coming of the
[1:05:36] great and Dreadful day of the
[1:05:40] Lord
[1:05:43] wow well I know that when Jesus came
[1:05:47] born in the
[1:05:49] manger that coming was not Dre
[1:05:52] Dreadful right it was not Dreadful it
[1:05:55] was a
[1:05:56] rejoicing this day I'll bring you good
[1:05:58] tidings of great joy shall be for all
[1:06:03] people this is talking about his second
[1:06:06] coming that's going to be
[1:06:10] Dreadful but God promised to send a
[1:06:13] messenger a
[1:06:16] prophet what's he going to do well Jesus
[1:06:19] said in Matthew 17:11 Elias truly shall
[1:06:22] first come and re rest store all
[1:06:27] things all things amen not just some of
[1:06:33] them Revelations 10:7 says in the days
[1:06:36] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:06:38] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[1:06:41] God should be finished as he have
[1:06:42] declared to his servants the
[1:06:48] prophets we're blessed
[1:06:51] people God chose you out of a big big
[1:06:54] group of people somehow he got the
[1:06:56] message to you somehow he directed you
[1:06:59] to the truth we ought to be the happiest
[1:07:02] people in the world because you need the
[1:07:04] message to overcome you need the message
[1:07:07] to overcome how can you overcome and not
[1:07:09] brother B say is recognizing the devil
[1:07:12] and all his
[1:07:14] tricks this message shows us the devil
[1:07:18] talks about motives and objectives and
[1:07:21] checking those things because the devil
[1:07:23] can
[1:07:27] inside the word of God has been restored
[1:07:30] to the
[1:07:31] church Jesus said in John
[1:07:34] 18:37 everyone that is of Truth everyone
[1:07:38] that is of the truth heareth my voice in
[1:07:43] other words there's something inside of
[1:07:44] us that said yes I believe
[1:07:48] this and that's your connection with
[1:07:51] God there's a small flock who's taking
[1:07:54] the truth and making herself ready amen
[1:07:58] they're purifying themselves with the
[1:08:01] pure word because this is pure there's
[1:08:04] no man's opinion I was talking to
[1:08:06] someone today and I I I
[1:08:10] it's I wasn't talking to him today I was
[1:08:13] talking to him the other day and I was
[1:08:16] trying to get them to read the
[1:08:19] Bible and I told him to start with
[1:08:22] Romans just start with Romans read the
[1:08:23] first three
[1:08:25] chapters and then we talk the next
[1:08:29] week well they just the day before that
[1:08:33] I saw them they they read the first two
[1:08:35] chapters and she started out by saying
[1:08:40] that um well I I think you know you know
[1:08:44] Paul was given his
[1:08:46] opinion his
[1:08:48] View and so I just
[1:08:52] strictly said this this this Bible is
[1:08:54] God's
[1:08:55] word it it is nobody's opinion there's
[1:08:59] no man's opinion in there right our my
[1:09:02] whole soul is banked on this word if
[1:09:05] this word don't get me there nothing
[1:09:06] will amen nothing will there ain't a man
[1:09:09] on this planet I have confidence in my
[1:09:12] confidence is in the
[1:09:14] word Faith's final resting place is in
[1:09:17] the
[1:09:19] word so you pray pray for those Souls
[1:09:22] because we want them to come to
[1:09:26] church but in Ephesians 5:27 I'm just
[1:09:30] going to read it real quick Paul said
[1:09:33] that he might sanctify and cleanse the
[1:09:37] church with the washing of the Water by
[1:09:41] the word amen so when we think about
[1:09:43] washing whether dishes whatever it is
[1:09:45] we're using
[1:09:48] water brother Stan he washes his tools
[1:09:51] when he's done making that beautiful
[1:09:53] beautiful
[1:09:54] entryway he uses water to wash
[1:09:59] it God uses his word to wash us yes and
[1:10:04] the thing is we've got to take the word
[1:10:07] into our heart we don't want to be
[1:10:08] washed on the outside we don't come to
[1:10:10] church to get washed on the
[1:10:12] outside we get washed on the Inside Yes
[1:10:16] it deals with our motives our character
[1:10:19] things that nobody knows about except
[1:10:21] you and God Amen and what's the reason
[1:10:24] verse 27 says that he might present it
[1:10:27] to
[1:10:28] himself a glorious church not having
[1:10:31] spot or
[1:10:33] wrinkle or any such thing but it should
[1:10:37] be holy and without
[1:10:42] blemish I want to be his
[1:10:45] bride
[1:10:47] certainly My Flesh doesn't want to yield
[1:10:50] to this word My Flesh doesn't want to
[1:10:53] have to humble itself and pray and and
[1:10:56] and and make things right and and and
[1:10:59] and pursue the the character of God it
[1:11:02] doesn't want to it's just like
[1:11:05] yours it was just like
[1:11:08] Peter's but thank God somebody not Peter
[1:11:12] or Paul off his
[1:11:14] horse God is attention you're on the
[1:11:16] wrong path and I'm so glad something God
[1:11:20] knocked me off my horse amen got me on
[1:11:23] the right path
[1:11:28] amen I can see now why brother bam says
[1:11:31] we come here to find out where we're at
[1:11:32] with
[1:11:35] god let's go back to Matthew now God's
[1:11:38] giving us just time enough just time
[1:11:41] enough to make ourselves ready we don't
[1:11:44] have extra time verse 48 but if but and
[1:11:49] if that evil servant shall say in his
[1:11:51] heart my Lord delay is
[1:11:54] coming you know how how the evil man
[1:11:58] says that in his
[1:12:00] heart I don't have to worry about that
[1:12:02] right
[1:12:05] now that's how he says
[1:12:10] that and God looks at that mentality as
[1:12:13] being
[1:12:14] evil and shall begin to Smite his fellow
[1:12:18] servants and to eat and drink with the
[1:12:22] drunkard in another words words he
[1:12:24] begins not to care about helping others
[1:12:26] get ready for his coming that's what
[1:12:27] that really
[1:12:31] means yeah we know the whole world is
[1:12:34] killing one another out
[1:12:43] there but when you don't care to help
[1:12:45] somebody get ready for the coming of the
[1:12:47] Lord you're just so focused on
[1:12:51] yourself and spend time with those that
[1:12:54] are in the world what are they doing
[1:12:56] it's all about them it's all about what
[1:12:58] pleases
[1:12:59] them not saying we're we're drinking I'm
[1:13:02] not saying
[1:13:07] that but look if there was a fire in
[1:13:12] here and it was real bad and somebody
[1:13:15] else's child was in
[1:13:18] here you wouldn't say every man for
[1:13:21] himself sir you would be running back in
[1:13:25] there to get that child am but we're
[1:13:28] talking about the coming of the Lord
[1:13:30] there is no service after the coming of
[1:13:32] the Lord there won't be any service here
[1:13:35] I will not be
[1:13:38] here so this train only leaves once you
[1:13:42] know we can miss a service and come to
[1:13:44] the next one we can miss a day of prayer
[1:13:46] and come to the next one you cannot miss
[1:13:48] the coming of the
[1:13:52] Lord verse
[1:13:54] 50 the Lord of that servant shall come
[1:13:57] in that day when he look not for him and
[1:14:00] in an hour that he is not aware of and
[1:14:03] shall cut him aunder and appoint him his
[1:14:06] portion with the
[1:14:08] Hypocrites there shall be weeping and
[1:14:11] nashing to PE notice you know when we
[1:14:12] look at a hypocrite we look at somebody
[1:14:14] who professes one thing and then doesn't
[1:14:17] do it
[1:14:18] right now Jesus is saying hey if I've
[1:14:21] told you about it
[1:14:26] you're not going to walk in that light
[1:14:29] that's
[1:14:32] hypocritical what does it take to make
[1:14:34] ourselves ready that's the real question
[1:14:37] Romans chapter 13 we want to go through
[1:14:40] some scriptures here and just talk about
[1:14:42] taking off some old things and putting
[1:14:44] on some new
[1:14:46] things what does it take to make
[1:14:48] ourselves ready well Romans 13 I'm going
[1:14:50] to start with verse 7 render therefore
[1:14:52] to all their dues tribute to him
[1:14:54] tributors do custom to him Customs do
[1:14:56] fear to him fear honor to him honor all
[1:15:00] no man
[1:15:02] anything
[1:15:04] don't try to leave the planet on
[1:15:06] somebody something oh no man anything
[1:15:11] but to love one another
[1:15:14] amen oh I love that you know if you just
[1:15:18] love you'll take care of
[1:15:20] things for he that loveth another ha
[1:15:23] fulfilled the
[1:15:26] law when you're manifesting Divine
[1:15:30] love you're surely on the right track
[1:15:34] just remember that and if you're not
[1:15:36] manifesting Divine love you better get
[1:15:39] there
[1:15:40] first brother Brandon says without
[1:15:42] perfect love there's no way to to get in
[1:15:44] there how are you going to make a
[1:15:45] Rapture without perfect love James said
[1:15:48] if if you fulfill the Royal law
[1:15:51] according to the scriptures Thou shalt
[1:15:52] Love Thy Neighbor as th you do well but
[1:15:54] if you have respect to
[1:15:56] persons you actually commit sin amen and
[1:16:00] are convince the law and our
[1:16:02] transgressor so if I respect somebody in
[1:16:05] this church more than somebody
[1:16:07] else if I love someone more favoritism
[1:16:12] than somebody else I'm a transgressor
[1:16:17] sir God don't want a wife up there that
[1:16:21] only has love
[1:16:24] for certain
[1:16:26] persons because he's a God that loves
[1:16:29] all persons amen he just has the
[1:16:32] character to deal with
[1:16:34] those who are out of
[1:16:37] character he just has enough love to
[1:16:40] handle it without just getting rid of
[1:16:43] them because if you think about it every
[1:16:45] child of God every member of the
[1:16:49] Bride every foolish version that's go
[1:16:52] through tribulation every single
[1:16:54] one had satanic nature before God came
[1:16:59] to
[1:17:00] them so he's got the capability of
[1:17:02] dealing with a satanic nature amen and
[1:17:05] if we get filled with God's love we'll
[1:17:07] know how to handle it too but I tell you
[1:17:09] you can't do it on
[1:17:11] yourself you know one satanic nature
[1:17:13] trying to deal with somebody else's
[1:17:14] satanic nature it don't
[1:17:17] work no but the love of God in your
[1:17:19] heart covers a multitude of sins it is
[1:17:23] patient it is kind as Longs suffer it
[1:17:25] endures all things it can handle it
[1:17:30] amen Jesus said if you love them which
[1:17:33] love you what reward have you you're not
[1:17:36] even the publicans if you salute your
[1:17:38] brethren
[1:17:39] only what do you do do not even the
[1:17:42] publicans do the same thing Jesus is
[1:17:45] saying you're nothing special if you
[1:17:46] just loves only certain people in the
[1:17:49] church you're nothing special you're not
[1:17:52] considered material if that's how you're
[1:17:54] going to end
[1:17:56] up so if you're there start loving those
[1:17:59] that you have a hard time with get to
[1:18:01] that place where you can love everybody
[1:18:03] even your enemies that's what the
[1:18:05] prophet
[1:18:09] said Jesus said be therefore perfect
[1:18:12] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:18:14] is perfect lay aside everything and go
[1:18:18] after that perfect love get rid of
[1:18:20] respected persons by this shall all men
[1:18:23] know you're my
[1:18:25] disciples by this shall all men know
[1:18:27] you're ready for the
[1:18:29] Rapture when you have love one for
[1:18:31] another that's right all right Romans
[1:18:34] 13:10 love worketh no ill to his
[1:18:36] neighbor therefore love is the
[1:18:38] Fulfillment of the law and that
[1:18:41] knowing the
[1:18:44] time and now is high time to wake out of
[1:18:48] our sleep for our Salvation is nearer
[1:18:51] than when we first believed
[1:18:54] the night is far spent the day is at
[1:18:56] hand let us therefore cast off The Works
[1:18:59] cast them off the works of
[1:19:02] darkness you know some people would read
[1:19:04] that verse and they' say oh that's for
[1:19:06] The
[1:19:07] Sinner no that's for the
[1:19:10] believer The Sinner don't believe
[1:19:15] it the night is far spent the days and
[1:19:18] let us therefore cast off the works of
[1:19:21] darkness and let us put on the AR armor
[1:19:23] of light let us walk honestly as in the
[1:19:26] day not riding drunkenness not in
[1:19:28] chamberling and wanness not in strife
[1:19:31] and
[1:19:32] envy but put ye
[1:19:35] on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not
[1:19:39] provision for the flesh to fulfill the
[1:19:41] lust
[1:19:42] thereof so we're to cast off strife and
[1:19:45] envy and Ill behavior and and just
[1:19:47] wanting things cast that off it's a work
[1:19:51] of Darkness amen and put on the armor of
[1:19:54] light well what is that the Lord Jesus
[1:19:56] Christ
[1:19:57] amen in other words be clothed with
[1:20:00] humility put on the that let the mind
[1:20:03] that was in Christ be in
[1:20:05] you
[1:20:08] amen some people put on Christianity
[1:20:11] like they do
[1:20:12] clothes you know what I'm
[1:20:15] saying when they're done with them they
[1:20:17] just take them off they're just going to
[1:20:18] beat their own self they put them on
[1:20:21] when it's convenient or for sure show or
[1:20:23] if they want to preach to somebody hey
[1:20:25] look at these Duds
[1:20:28] dude pretty fancy huh don't I look
[1:20:33] good I just say if you're going to put
[1:20:35] those clothes on keep them
[1:20:37] on don't be a show be genuine amen
[1:20:42] Christianity is something that you leave
[1:20:45] on it's it's an everyday life it's you
[1:20:48] live it it doesn't matter if who you're
[1:20:50] living
[1:20:51] around is a Believer or not you live
[1:20:55] it it's not to be a
[1:20:58] sh we're not
[1:21:00] Hypocrites we're Believers we're making
[1:21:03] ourselves
[1:21:05] ready it requires more than just the act
[1:21:08] that Christ did for us at
[1:21:11] Calvary he did his part but God is
[1:21:15] asking us to obey his word we've got to
[1:21:18] do our part he did his we have to do
[1:21:21] ours
[1:21:23] and throughout these scriptures you're
[1:21:24] going to see that we have to cast off
[1:21:26] the first nature and then we have to put
[1:21:29] on God's nature and we're just using
[1:21:31] that terminology of casting off and
[1:21:34] putting on but I'm going to say it like
[1:21:35] this this means your heart is actually
[1:21:37] putting forth
[1:21:39] effort you don't sit there and say well
[1:21:41] God's going to have to put me in the
[1:21:43] promised land if I'm going to get
[1:21:45] there you're not going to get there at
[1:21:47] that attitude neither did the children
[1:21:48] of Israel you want you're going to have
[1:21:50] to be like Joshua and Caleb I'm going
[1:21:52] out after the nature of God nothing can
[1:21:54] stand before me if God be with me who
[1:21:57] can be against me and that's how the
[1:21:59] attitude we got to have Ephesians
[1:22:01] chapter 4 verse1
[1:22:05] 15 now we we're talking a little bit in
[1:22:08] our series about
[1:22:11] um be functioning as a healthy body but
[1:22:15] it kind of connects here a little bit I
[1:22:18] believe because God is not marrying a
[1:22:22] child
[1:22:23] he's not marrying a a lady that's
[1:22:26] immature we have to grow up right verse
[1:22:29] 15 but speaking the truth in love may
[1:22:32] grow up into him in all things which is
[1:22:36] the head even Christ and from the whole
[1:22:40] body fitly joined together compacted by
[1:22:42] that which every joint supplieth
[1:22:44] according to the effectual working in
[1:22:46] the measure of every part making
[1:22:47] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:22:50] of itself in love God give us a
[1:22:53] revelation like that then I can stop
[1:22:56] preaching there's a lot
[1:22:59] there this I say therefore and testify
[1:23:03] in the Lord that you you henceforth walk
[1:23:05] not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity
[1:23:09] of their
[1:23:10] mind having the UN having the
[1:23:14] understanding darkened being alienated
[1:23:15] from the real true life of
[1:23:18] God through the ignorance that is in
[1:23:20] them because of the blindness of their
[1:23:21] heart how important is about to see the
[1:23:24] word to not be blinded to the word
[1:23:26] because whatever you think God really is
[1:23:29] that's what you'll
[1:23:32] be you've got to have a you've got to
[1:23:35] know who God is God is Holy so that
[1:23:37] means you're going to be holy God is
[1:23:39] loving you're going to be loving God is
[1:23:40] forgiving you're going to be forgiving
[1:23:42] whatever you you Vision God to be it's
[1:23:45] you got to keep that there and walk in
[1:23:47] it who being past feeling have given
[1:23:49] thems over to lasciviousness to walk all
[1:23:52] all to work all uncleanness with
[1:23:56] greediness it's all about
[1:23:59] them but you have not so learned Christ
[1:24:03] praise God if so be that ye have heard
[1:24:07] of him and have been taught by him as
[1:24:09] the truth is in Jesus that's why we
[1:24:12] believe in preaching the truth here and
[1:24:15] that you put off concerning the formal
[1:24:18] conversation of the old
[1:24:21] man which is corrupt according to
[1:24:24] deceitful
[1:24:25] lust well we all had one thing in common
[1:24:27] before we came to the Lord we wanted our
[1:24:30] own
[1:24:31] will we had that in common we may not
[1:24:33] agree with one another but we wanted
[1:24:34] what we wanted amen and as we the more
[1:24:37] we become like Christ the more we want
[1:24:39] to serve one
[1:24:42] another amen that's
[1:24:46] right all right and be renewed in the
[1:24:50] spirit of your mind this is the way you
[1:24:53] think and that you put on the new man
[1:24:56] which is after God is created in
[1:24:58] righteousness and true Holiness
[1:25:00] wherefore put away that little sneaky
[1:25:03] I'm not going to tell you
[1:25:05] everything speak every man truth with
[1:25:08] his
[1:25:10] neighbor for we are members one of
[1:25:14] another be not angry and or be angry and
[1:25:18] sin not I say for most of you that don't
[1:25:21] have a Revelation on that just don't be
[1:25:25] angry amen if you're going to get angry
[1:25:29] get angry at sin Not a Human
[1:25:32] Being because as soon as you let it out
[1:25:34] on that human being you've
[1:25:37] sinned so be angry and sin not let not
[1:25:40] the sun go down upon your wrath now look
[1:25:43] at we're supposed to be putting this on
[1:25:45] taking this off and putting this
[1:25:50] on put off anger
[1:25:53] and put on don't let the sun go down
[1:25:55] before you make things
[1:25:57] right now we all well now this is the
[1:26:00] Bible this is not the John Martin you
[1:26:02] know Bible this is the King James Bible
[1:26:05] I just read out
[1:26:07] of this is what we need to practice can
[1:26:09] you say amen amen amen be be committed
[1:26:12] to it because you're the bride if I was
[1:26:14] if I was talking to the foolish version
[1:26:17] hey look we wouldn't be having this type
[1:26:18] of
[1:26:21] service I'd be you know trying I'd be
[1:26:23] preaching to them I'd be saying you know
[1:26:26] you're doing so
[1:26:28] good you don't need to do anything
[1:26:33] more you know what I'm saying all right
[1:26:36] don't let the sun go up on your wrath
[1:26:38] neither give place to the devil let him
[1:26:41] that stole steal no more but rather let
[1:26:43] him
[1:26:46] labor don't be looking for things from
[1:26:49] others but
[1:26:51] labor I don't I've never understood it
[1:26:53] where these people go into a store and
[1:26:55] they steal
[1:26:58] stuff or they steal from
[1:27:02] somebody I
[1:27:04] mean what is
[1:27:08] that it wasn't yours to begin with I
[1:27:11] don't care if you give it to somebody
[1:27:12] else I don't care if you're a Robin Hood
[1:27:15] and you are vigilante and steal from
[1:27:17] this guy and give it to the poor you're
[1:27:19] not supposed to steal you want to give
[1:27:22] something away go labor for it and then
[1:27:25] give it
[1:27:28] away let him that stole steal no more
[1:27:32] but rather let him labor working with
[1:27:34] his hands the thing which worketh which
[1:27:37] is good that he may have to give to him
[1:27:41] that needeth
[1:27:43] it let no corrupt communication proceed
[1:27:46] out of your mouth but that which is good
[1:27:50] to the use of the Ed
[1:27:54] that it may Minister
[1:27:57] Grace unto the hearers you know we all
[1:28:00] have a chance to minister don't we every
[1:28:02] time we open our
[1:28:04] mouth I'm speaking to every one of us of
[1:28:07] what we say in our
[1:28:09] homes right because that's where we need
[1:28:12] to practice is is in our
[1:28:15] homes or maybe on our
[1:28:20] jobs and grief not the Holy Spirit
[1:28:23] whereby years sealed until the day of
[1:28:25] redemption let all bitterness and wrath
[1:28:28] and anger and clamor and evil speaking
[1:28:30] be put away from you taken off of you
[1:28:34] with all
[1:28:35] malice and be kind one to another
[1:28:37] tender-hearted forgiving one another
[1:28:39] even as God for Christ's sake have
[1:28:41] forgiven you so we see in these set of
[1:28:43] scriptures that God is wanting us to put
[1:28:46] off a first nature and put on his nature
[1:28:50] and the problem is we go through and we
[1:28:53] make mistakes we give some excuse I
[1:28:56] wouldn't have done it if they would have
[1:28:57] did this and they started first and they
[1:28:58] called me that and they said this and
[1:29:00] they offended me and that wasn't right
[1:29:02] before you know it you've got some
[1:29:05] self-righteous reason to act the way you
[1:29:08] do well Vengeance doesn't belong to you
[1:29:12] it belongs to God Amen what we need to
[1:29:15] do is be so full of the love of God that
[1:29:19] we can actually handle
[1:29:20] things
[1:29:23] hey I'm G to be just like him I'm I'm
[1:29:26] sorry but I just believe
[1:29:29] it I'm stupid enough to believe the word
[1:29:32] of
[1:29:33] God call me odd you go ahead but I'm
[1:29:37] gonna believe it if nobody believes it
[1:29:40] I'm going to believe
[1:29:41] it and the quicker we believe it the
[1:29:44] quicker we'll be able to start handling
[1:29:46] things is we got to we got to start
[1:29:48] working through them you know usually
[1:29:51] when they're comes a problem I don't
[1:29:52] want to get into our Wednesday series
[1:29:55] that we are doing but you know we get so
[1:29:58] afraid when somebody
[1:30:04] goes that's just the
[1:30:06] devil
[1:30:13] manipulative the Bible tells me to be
[1:30:15] tenderhearted amen
[1:30:20] tenderhearted
[1:30:22] I want to be
[1:30:24] that I want to live
[1:30:27] that I don't want to live it just in
[1:30:29] front of you brother
[1:30:32] Ron I want to live it to the person who
[1:30:35] really wants to hurt
[1:30:38] me who really had something bad I just
[1:30:41] talking to a minister just yesterday and
[1:30:44] he was telling me about these things
[1:30:45] that were said about
[1:30:48] him just Plastering him
[1:30:52] so everybody could
[1:30:54] hear and it just hurt me the bride don't
[1:30:58] do
[1:31:00] that I don't care if they're claiming to
[1:31:02] be the bride the bride won't do
[1:31:06] that the thing really needs to be made
[1:31:08] right they need to get right we have to
[1:31:11] put on
[1:31:13] Christ therefore If any man being Christ
[1:31:16] he's a new creature the old has passed
[1:31:18] away all things have become new and all
[1:31:21] things are of God so we got to put on
[1:31:24] all of God we got to put on the the
[1:31:25] whole armor of God
[1:31:28] right things we got to take off we got
[1:31:30] to take off our self-righteousness we
[1:31:32] got to take we got to put off all of our
[1:31:37] iniquities Colossians chapter 3:8 I I
[1:31:41] want to read these quickly here
[1:31:44] Colossians chapter 3:8 but now ye also
[1:31:47] there's more things I like that the
[1:31:49] Bible's not over with but now ye also
[1:31:52] put off these anger wrath malice
[1:31:54] blasphemy filthy communication out of
[1:31:56] your mouth lie not one to another seeing
[1:31:58] the put off the old man with his deeds
[1:32:00] and it put on the new man which is
[1:32:02] renewed in
[1:32:05] knowledge after the image of him that
[1:32:09] created
[1:32:10] him God still has this Vision let us
[1:32:14] make man in our own
[1:32:18] image where there is neither Greek nor
[1:32:21] nor Jew circumcision or uncircumcision
[1:32:24] barbar Barbarian cian Bond or free but
[1:32:28] Christ is all and in all put on
[1:32:31] therefore as the wife this is how you
[1:32:35] make yourself
[1:32:36] ready when you can holy beloved bows of
[1:32:41] Mercy kindness humbleness of
[1:32:46] mind humbleness of
[1:32:49] mind don't be thinking thoughts like I
[1:32:51] wish I could give him a piece of my
[1:32:56] mind that's not humbleness of
[1:32:58] mind if I wasn't a Christian I'd give
[1:33:01] him a piece of my
[1:33:03] mind you still got
[1:33:06] it to the mind of Christ don't think
[1:33:09] like
[1:33:10] that humbleness of Mind meekness
[1:33:13] longsuffering forbearing one another
[1:33:15] forgiving one another If any man have a
[1:33:18] quarrel against another even as Christ
[1:33:21] forgave you so also do
[1:33:24] ye and above all these above everything
[1:33:27] we just heard above all these put on
[1:33:33] charity which is the bond of
[1:33:36] perfectness I got thinking about
[1:33:39] that we that are married we
[1:33:42] think about the bond that we have with
[1:33:45] our spouse we do that from time to
[1:33:50] time
[1:33:53] I say time for time because other times
[1:33:54] we're dealing with
[1:33:56] situations Excuse
[1:33:58] Me Maybe I wasn't supposed to say
[1:34:01] anything
[1:34:02] [Laughter]
[1:34:10] there start
[1:34:16] over but we think of bond and there's a
[1:34:19] bond there yes
[1:34:22] and I think the bond that Christ has
[1:34:23] with his wife it's actually happening
[1:34:26] now she's thinking of what pleases him
[1:34:29] he's thinking about how to help her
[1:34:32] through to get to this point to be in
[1:34:33] His image and he's trying to wash her
[1:34:36] with the word and give her what she
[1:34:38] needs and give her
[1:34:41] faith but if she's going to be lazy and
[1:34:43] she ain't going to cry out to God well
[1:34:45] then she's not doing what the bride
[1:34:47] needs to do because I'll say it like
[1:34:48] this my wife doesn't go to any other man
[1:34:53] and say I want you to build me a
[1:34:59] greenhouse because she would get a flat
[1:35:02] out no
[1:35:07] answer that there's a bond there there's
[1:35:09] a bond between you and
[1:35:12] Christ and it's the love of God inside
[1:35:15] of you that constrains
[1:35:17] you to please him to put off the old
[1:35:20] nature and say God I want to be so full
[1:35:23] of you that when something happens I
[1:35:24] don't want you to come out right and
[1:35:28] that charity is really what bonds you
[1:35:31] the love of God bonds you together God
[1:35:34] is not
[1:35:35] attracted to your human
[1:35:38] love he is not attracted to you'll go
[1:35:41] this far but then you
[1:35:44] stop he's interested in you going and
[1:35:47] never
[1:35:49] stopping that you're in it for the Long
[1:35:53] Haul so I say
[1:35:56] today we got to make ourselves ready
[1:35:59] let's make
[1:36:00] it our first and most
[1:36:04] important because we're not going to get
[1:36:06] a heads up when he's
[1:36:10] coming this is the heads up the heads up
[1:36:13] that he sent a
[1:36:14] message and he's he's given us time to
[1:36:18] get
[1:36:19] dressed he doesn't owe us anymore
[1:36:22] time he doesn't owe us anymore you know
[1:36:25] I I I I just want to give you one more
[1:36:26] day to you know kind of put some time
[1:36:28] and spend it with
[1:36:31] me he's given us time it's up to us to
[1:36:36] number our
[1:36:40] days let's Stand
[1:36:47] Together Revelations 22:17 and the
[1:36:50] spirit
[1:36:51] and the bride say
[1:36:54] come there's a union and he that Hearth
[1:36:57] say say come and let us and let him that
[1:37:00] is a thirst come and what and whosoever
[1:37:02] will let him take of the Waters of Life
[1:37:06] freely for I say unto every man that
[1:37:08] heareth the words of the prophecy of
[1:37:10] this book If any man shall add unto
[1:37:13] these things God shall add into the
[1:37:15] plagues that are written in this book
[1:37:18] and if any man say well I don't really
[1:37:20] have to do them it's not that
[1:37:24] necessary take away from the words of
[1:37:26] the book of this Prophet God shall take
[1:37:28] his part of the book of life and not of
[1:37:30] the holy city and from the things that
[1:37:32] are written in the book he which
[1:37:34] testifieth these things sayith surely I
[1:37:37] come

[1:38:03] place her
[1:38:04] part and I'm so thankful for Revelation
[1:38:07] because it takes Revelation so I'll say
[1:38:10] you that maybe don't quite see things
[1:38:14] the way that they were ministered take
[1:38:16] time to pray and just say God if that
[1:38:18] really is you would you show me
[1:38:22] and I believe God will just open that up
[1:38:24] he's just looking for a willingness amen
