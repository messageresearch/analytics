[39:36] about brother John he told me he's a

[39:41] Marti is a wonderful brother and I think
[39:44] I I got to see that that what he told me
[39:48] is the truth God bless you sir it's a
[39:52] privilege to serve God in your church
[39:56] and the love and trust that you have and
[39:59] someday we trust you come to
[40:02] Nigeria amen I someday we trust to come
[40:06] to
[40:08] Nigeria Hallelujah you know Nigeria is
[40:12] there we are God's children from that
[40:15] part of the
[40:16] world okay and some things we hear from
[40:20] the Western media gives very wrong
[40:25] impression about certain places on the
[40:29] earth the first time I visited Zimbabwe
[40:33] of course you've heard about Zimbabwe I
[40:36] was to vaccinate myself against colera
[40:39] because of what I heard in the news that
[40:42] you know they were trowing up and going
[40:44] to the bathroom trowing up going to the
[40:46] bathroom be getting to Zimbabwe I didn't
[40:49] see anything like that but I heard it in
[40:52] the news and it Formed my
[40:55] impression all right right so some
[40:57] things we hear about certain countries
[41:00] is not actually so but news media must
[41:04] do their job and we as Christians must
[41:07] believe what is necessary to be believed
[41:10] amen hallelujah and uh no matter how
[41:14] dark a place might be God will have his
[41:18] his children amen at that particular
[41:21] location on Earth amen I know we don't
[41:24] have time I just had like 55 minutes to
[41:26] speak and uh but something is coming to
[41:29] my mind now in the parable of the
[41:32] S Matthew Chapter
[41:35] 13 parable of the S I hope you are
[41:38] hearing me my accent and all that
[41:41] hallelujah amen okay so in the parable
[41:44] of the
[41:45] soer a man wore white and he went on to
[41:50] SW
[41:51] wheat the why men
[41:54] slept another one God behind him yes
[41:57] dressed in
[41:59] black and he sold
[42:02] test right and Jesus told us in the
[42:05] parable
[42:07] that the field is the
[42:11] world the field whereing the seed were
[42:14] sewn is the world is the
[42:17] Earth and he told us that the wheat are
[42:21] the children of the Kingdom am isn't it
[42:25] yes and the terrors are the children of
[42:28] the devil
[42:30] amen now if the
[42:34] field is the
[42:36] earth and the wheat the children of God
[42:41] now we see
[42:42] that the Earth is divided into
[42:47] continent isn't the
[42:49] world they have reduced the volume of
[42:51] the microphone I hope are she hearing me
[42:57] the world is divided into
[43:00] continent and the continents are divided
[43:03] into countries and the countries are
[43:06] divided into States and the states are
[43:09] divided into counties yes and the
[43:12] counties are divided into cities and
[43:15] towns and Villages and Hamlet amen isn't
[43:18] it yes now the seed that were sown the
[43:23] wheat the children of God the children
[43:26] of the Kingdom OM they are found on
[43:30] Earth in those continents in those
[43:34] countries in those States in those
[43:37] counties in those uh local councils in
[43:40] those cities and Villages and Hamlet am
[43:44] so go you understand the parable God's
[43:46] children are found everywhere and some
[43:49] of the seed fell at Tifton this Tifton
[43:53] what do you call the name of this city
[43:54] here fentin some see fell in fting and
[43:59] that is why you could come and you are
[44:01] here in this church God's children the
[44:04] whe they were soon Children of the
[44:07] Kingdom amen right some fell in Nigeria
[44:10] some fell in my city some fell in my
[44:12] Village and I happened to be one of
[44:14] them am so God's children are
[44:18] found all over the known Earth they are
[44:21] very few and scy but I believe that
[44:25] there's no there's no there's no country
[44:27] of of the world that does not have a
[44:30] Christian believer on
[44:32] it and is a fulfillment of the
[44:35] parable of the
[44:37] Ser God's children coming forth so God

[47:39] bless the reading of his word in Christ
[47:41] Jesus name amen amen tonight just a
[47:44] little thought though it could take us
[47:47] up to an hour but now we don't have up
[47:49] to an hour anymore before we close
[47:53] because you know in America just one
[47:55] hour and you got to get out of the
[47:59] pulpit amen God bless you so tonight we
[48:03] just want to Fellowship around this
[48:05] thought God
[48:08] workmanship
[48:09] God's
[48:11] workmanship Hallelujah that's almighty
[48:14] God Amen he
[48:18] workmanship
[48:20] sometimes we we call
[48:23] workmanship to be the payment
[48:26] for the labor of a laborer but that is
[48:30] not what we want to talk
[48:32] about what I'm saying is this the
[48:35] carpenter that built this Pulpit this is
[48:38] a beautiful
[48:40] piece sometimes we call his payment
[48:44] workmanship we give him the contract
[48:47] please come and build this pulit the
[48:49] pastor give him the specification the
[48:51] trustees and all that then we now we we
[48:54] now ask him how much much will you
[48:58] charge what will be your pay what will
[49:00] you love to take in terms of money right
[49:04] sometimes we call that
[49:08] workmanship amen
[49:12] but we are not following that that is
[49:16] not the Divination We are following
[49:17] tonight by the grace of God what what we
[49:20] are talking about is God
[49:23] workmanship and workmanship means
[49:27] something that is made something that is
[49:31] affected something that is created amen
[49:34] something that is
[49:36] manufactured praise God now this pull
[49:40] pit is the workmanship of the
[49:44] carpenter that made
[49:47] it this altar is the workmanship is the
[49:51] work is the
[49:54] produce of the one that made it amen
[49:58] glory but these are physical
[50:02] materials amen but these are spiritual
[50:06] materials that no man could make apart
[50:09] from God Almighty
[50:11] himself so these are God's
[50:15] workmanship including myself that is
[50:18] what we want to talk about tonight am
[50:20] for the remaining minute that we have to
[50:23] talk about that so while we continue if
[50:26] maybe we call some quote if they could
[50:28] feature it on the screen we I will
[50:31] really appreciate that so now the art or
[50:35] skill of a Workman that's another
[50:37] definition for workmanship amen the art
[50:40] a r t yes the art or skill of a
[50:48] Workman now we I'm taking from church
[50:51] ages first brother ronam says the Son of
[50:56] God if they could search it while I'm
[50:57] reading it the Son of God himself said
[51:00] believe me for the very work
[51:03] sake Hallelujah he said believe me for
[51:06] the very work
[51:08] sake
[51:10] now he put an emphasis on his own Works
[51:14] while he was here on Earth the prophet
[51:16] say Jesus put emphasis on his own work
[51:21] if you can't believe me as a Son of God
[51:24] if you can't believe me as a prophet if
[51:26] you can't believe me as a pastor if you
[51:29] can't believe me as a preacher
[51:31] Hallelujah believe the works that I do
[51:35] because the works prove Who I Am The
[51:38] Works prove who sent me so if you can't
[51:42] believe me if you can't believe my
[51:44] statement if you can't believe my
[51:46] sentence believe my works because the
[51:50] works were Supernatural amen hallelujah
[51:53] and it takes somebody that come from God
[51:56] to be able to display Supernatural Works
[51:59] yes a canal man cannot manifest
[52:01] Supernatural
[52:02] Works a man that is Canal cannot
[52:07] produce Supernatural work so Jesus
[52:12] emphasized on his work amen while he was
[52:15] here on Earth praise the name of the
[52:17] Lord amen amen maybe for example you
[52:23] were doubting the carpenter the
[52:25] capability of the Carpenter to be able
[52:27] to produce a beautiful pull pit that
[52:31] befits the church or the desire of the
[52:34] pastor I guess you are hearing me
[52:38] right you doubt his capability you doubt
[52:42] his
[52:43] efficiency you doubt his uh
[52:47] skillfulness
[52:50] amen then on his uh trying to convince
[52:55] you he said look Pastor John don't worry
[52:59] give me let me produce there's a bench
[53:03] here I can't raise it up because of
[53:05] there's a bench here wherein our
[53:07] microphones are kept amen he said look
[53:10] give me this small work let me do it
[53:14] when I produce this work that will prove
[53:17] my efficiency to you then you'll be able
[53:20] to trust me to give me this big one
[53:23] here so Jesus was proven to them you is
[53:27] difficult for you to believe me believe
[53:30] the work amen that I do because the work
[53:34] prove who he was and your all prove who
[53:38] you are God
[53:41] workmanship Hallelujah so now ah I don't
[53:45] know I won't be able to read we just try
[53:47] to quote as much as I can
[53:50] now we so the works that he did were
[53:54] ordained of God and to inspire faith in
[53:57] him the work that Jesus I'm reading from
[53:59] church ages exposition of the seven
[54:01] Church ages the Titan Church age now the
[54:05] works that he did were ordained of God
[54:07] to inspire faith in him it was a great
[54:10] part of his ministry his his uh his holy
[54:13] spirit in the Apostle Paul said for we
[54:15] are his workmanship yes created in
[54:18] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[54:21] had for ordained that we should work in
[54:24] them these Works were to faith in him as
[54:28] they will show forth that relationship
[54:30] to him that Paul described as created in
[54:33] him Hallelujah now will take this we
[54:37] read Revelation
[54:41] 3:14 the beginning of the creation of
[54:44] God the prophet says let me quote if I
[54:48] still reading reading our time will be
[54:50] gone I will not go
[54:51] far the prophet says that phrase th word
[54:56] that scripture does not mean as it
[54:59] sounds the beginning of the creation of
[55:02] God if it means as it sounds it will
[55:05] mean that
[55:07] Hallelujah God created Jesus and Jesus
[55:12] started creating other
[55:15] creations that's the literal meaning of
[55:17] that but the prophet said it doesn't
[55:18] mean
[55:20] that Hallelujah the prophet say this is
[55:24] a is a is is a new creation
[55:27] hallelujah amen and Jesus happens to be
[55:31] the beginning of that creation amen
[55:35] hallelujah it was the beginning of the
[55:38] creation of God he was the author or the
[55:42] beginner of the creation of God now
[55:45] Church in the Old Testament really will
[55:48] you hear or see anybody being addressed
[55:51] as Son of God in the Old Testament
[55:56] really I know in Genesis 6 the Bible
[55:59] says and the sons of God saw the
[56:02] daughters of men that were fair and they
[56:05] took unto them wives I mean women amen
[56:09] they took unto them wives but the
[56:11] prophet say supposed to have been women
[56:13] and not
[56:16] wives because a preacher must pronounce
[56:18] the blessings of the Bible upon your
[56:20] marriage before you start living with a
[56:22] woman you don't pick a woman from the
[56:24] street and start living with her
[56:26] she must come by a marriage ordinance
[56:29] amen then Heaven sanctions it yes praise
[56:33] the name of the Lord so in the Old
[56:35] Testament really will you see somebody
[56:38] being addressed as Son of God apart from
[56:43] Adam Adam was a Son of God he came fresh
[56:47] from the hand of almighty God right and
[56:50] and uh he was made in righteousness and
[56:53] his Works were righteous yes until the
[56:56] sin came in Genesis chapter 3 and broke
[56:59] and destroyed that Holy image then Man
[57:02] became
[57:03] mad m a r e
[57:06] d Man became mad man
[57:10] spoil Hallelujah and being that God's
[57:15] workmanship had been spoiled right God's
[57:18] workmanship had been mad God had to take
[57:21] him back to the workshop to work on him
[57:26] to fix him
[57:28] because a man he was made in the image
[57:31] of
[57:32] God he was made in the image of God he
[57:36] was made in the likeness of God Adam was
[57:40] God in the amateur form Adam was God's
[57:44] son right hallelujah amen God's
[57:48] potentials were in Adam in amature form
[57:53] amen what God could do Adam could
[57:57] produce the way his father spoke and he
[58:00] became creative was the same way Adam
[58:03] was speaking and he became creative yes
[58:06] who name all the Creations on
[58:09] Earth who name all the Creations on
[58:15] Earth praise
[58:17] God it was Adam that named all the
[58:21] creationss on Earth amen I don't know
[58:23] whether scientists even know the number
[58:25] of creationss we have on Earth there are
[58:28] so many yeah the Creations in the seas
[58:32] in abundant in the air in abundance on
[58:35] the earth in abundance amen and Adam was
[58:38] so
[58:39] brilliant Adam was so intelligent amen
[58:42] that he could give he could name all
[58:45] amen the
[58:46] Creations right yes now Church give us
[58:51] the opportunity to have 12 individual
[58:54] children give a man an opport to have 12
[58:57] children by the time he he got names for
[59:01] the first to the fifth to the sixth to
[59:03] the
[59:04] sth he may lack name for the
[59:07] eight man is that poor in
[59:10] intelligence are you with
[59:12] me man is that
[59:15] poor because he lost it at the fall but
[59:18] Adam was so connected to God until he
[59:21] was God in a mature form he named all
[59:23] the Creations on Earth amen
[59:26] without giving the name of this to the
[59:31] other he was so
[59:33] intelligent but that image was mad he
[59:36] was spoiled God had to take him back to
[59:39] the workshop I mean yeah to fix him
[59:41] up now we can't read it if we read you
[59:45] can give us Luke chapter 3 from verse 23
[59:49] Luke chapter 3 from verse 23 I just for
[59:52] us to see something in there now in Luke
[59:55] 3 from vers 23 the Bible says and
[59:59] Jesus who was the son of uh let's let's
[1:00:03] see it Luke 3 Luke 23 Luke chapter 3 I
[1:00:07] said
[1:00:09] amen I think uh we just take our time
[1:00:12] until it's time to leave the pulpit
[1:00:15] without adding a minute
[1:00:17] Hallelujah when you rush you just you
[1:00:22] just uh and Jesus began to be about Luke
[1:00:26] 3:23 yes and Jesus himself did what
[1:00:31] began to be about 30 years of age amen
[1:00:35] being as was
[1:00:37] supposed the son of who the son of being
[1:00:41] as was supposed because Joseph was not
[1:00:43] his father right heavenly father was his
[1:00:47] father being as supposed the son of
[1:00:50] Joseph which was what the son of
[1:00:54] heli the next verse
[1:00:57] which was the son of mat which are the
[1:00:59] son of Levi which are the son of Mel

[1:02:43] was not given an Earthly father's name
[1:02:46] Adam was the son of God Hallelujah Jesus
[1:02:51] was the son of God between Jesus and
[1:02:54] Adam
[1:02:55] the Bible could not address
[1:02:58] nobody as Son of
[1:03:00] God so God had to bring in another race
[1:03:05] God had to bring in another creation God
[1:03:09] had to bring in a super race amen
[1:03:12] hallelujah and Jesus happens to be the
[1:03:15] beginning of that race amen son of the
[1:03:19] Living God Amen and by the spirit of God
[1:03:22] in him he could beget other Sons yes
[1:03:26] that could be called or addressed as Son
[1:03:29] of God yes once you are filled with the
[1:03:32] Holy Spirit you become what Son of God
[1:03:35] yes hallelujah amen but Adam could not
[1:03:38] pass the Holy
[1:03:40] Spirit to AB or to se Noah could not
[1:03:44] pass it to shame this could not Abraham
[1:03:47] could not pass it to Isaac Isaac could
[1:03:50] not pass it to Jacob right Hallelujah
[1:03:54] they gave bir to the son of their
[1:03:57] image but Jesus G I mean God created a
[1:04:02] son in his own image so he was Adam
[1:04:06] God yes Adam God but Abraham
[1:04:12] Tera are you with me yes
[1:04:15] Sir Isaac Abraham amen Jacob
[1:04:19] Isaac praise the Lord yes John
[1:04:24] Mar me Joseph right but at the baptism
[1:04:28] of the Holy Spirit you become a Son of
[1:04:31] God Amen and Jesus happened to be the
[1:04:34] beginning of that race amen the
[1:04:37] beginning of the creation of God Amen
[1:04:40] Jesus was the first is the first born of
[1:04:42] that family yes who was a Son of God
[1:04:45] himself amen hallelujah and by virtue of
[1:04:48] his position in the house of God he
[1:04:51] could begot other Sons amen by the
[1:04:53] infilling of the holy spirit amen he be
[1:04:56] so they could be called sons of God sons
[1:04:58] of God sons of God you see in the New
[1:05:01] Testament we are addressed as sons of
[1:05:03] God amen amen hallelujah because God not
[1:05:08] becomes our father but Abraham was the
[1:05:11] father of
[1:05:13] Isaac of
[1:05:15] course the God was responsible for them
[1:05:18] God created
[1:05:20] them I hope you are with us amen now
[1:05:23] let's continue we okay and which are the
[1:05:27] Son of God Amen praise God let's move on
[1:05:32] here so Jesus is the beginning of that
[1:05:35] new race he is the beginning of the
[1:05:37] creation of god let's see that still in
[1:05:39] the seven Church ages I am the beginning
[1:05:42] of the creation of God that is who the
[1:05:45] Lord Jesus say he is but those went
[1:05:47] don't mean exactly as they sound is to
[1:05:50] us he said just taking them the way the
[1:05:52] sound has made some people in fact
[1:05:54] multitude of people
[1:05:56] get the idea that Jesus was the first
[1:05:58] creation of God making him lower than
[1:06:00] the
[1:06:01] godhead then the first creation created
[1:06:03] all the rest of the universe and
[1:06:05] whatsoever it contains but that is not
[1:06:08] right you know that doesn't line up with
[1:06:10] the rest of the Bible the words the
[1:06:13] words ah he is the beginner or author of
[1:06:18] the creation of God Amen now we know for
[1:06:22] a shorty that Jesus is God hallelujah
[1:06:25] yeah Jesus Is God and the prophets say
[1:06:28] very
[1:06:30] God he is the creator John 13 all things
[1:06:34] were made by him and without him was not
[1:06:38] anything made that was made am so if all
[1:06:41] things were created by
[1:06:43] Jesus then the it is wrong to say that
[1:06:48] Jesus being the beginning of the
[1:06:49] creation of God means that God created
[1:06:52] Jesus and Jesus created other creation
[1:06:55] no
[1:06:57] sir he was a Creator amen nothing was
[1:07:00] made that was not made by him that's
[1:07:02] right and for his own good pleasure so
[1:07:05] this is another race this is another
[1:07:07] creation I'll just be reading and be
[1:07:09] jumping so that I go to the conclusion
[1:07:11] because I'm looking at the time now yeah
[1:07:14] he is a Creator so now see there is no
[1:07:17] doubt that he is a Creator I'm feeling
[1:07:20] good I'm beginning to feeling good
[1:07:21] church Hallelujah no doubt that Jesus is
[1:07:26] the Creator and brother Bram says I wish
[1:07:29] they could project it brother Bram say
[1:07:31] he was the creator of a finished
[1:07:35] physical
[1:07:37] creation Jesus was a creator of a
[1:07:42] finished physical creation praise the
[1:07:46] Lord I hope you got that we had the
[1:07:48] trees we had the Lions the cheetah the
[1:07:52] birds the Eagles the vulture the
[1:07:55] you know doves mentioned them we have
[1:08:00] man Hallelujah we have the Earth we have
[1:08:03] the Seas physical creation you got that
[1:08:07] am Jesus was the creator of the
[1:08:11] finished physical creation he finished
[1:08:14] creating it and the seventh day he
[1:08:17] rested is that not the
[1:08:19] Bible six days he worked transforming
[1:08:23] the chaotic Eden into a beautiful Garden
[1:08:25] of Eden brother the Earth is a beautiful
[1:08:28] place the Earth beautiful place and in
[1:08:34] it Fallen state if it's as beautiful as
[1:08:37] it is today how much more when it was
[1:08:40] the beautiful Garden of Eden before sin
[1:08:42] ever came to this Earth but God Almighty
[1:08:46] is returning it back to what it was
[1:08:49] because there's a future home that is
[1:08:51] coming amen and it will be a paradise
[1:08:53] again amen no death no accident no
[1:08:56] sickness no nothing negative Hallelujah
[1:08:59] it will be a beautiful wonderful
[1:09:01] paradise and we are longing for that we
[1:09:05] are longing for that amen hallelujah
[1:09:08] some of our brothers are aging I mean
[1:09:11] they aging they aching in
[1:09:14] pains right the steps are getting slower
[1:09:17] and
[1:09:18] slower mhm but there's another body
[1:09:22] brother There's a Place coming and we
[1:09:25] are nature is
[1:09:27] groaning yes waiting for the adoption
[1:09:30] amen of sons of God Amen and it to
[1:09:32] happen so
[1:09:34] now Jesus I want us to get that he was
[1:09:38] the creator of the finished physical
[1:09:42] creation amen we will use that as we
[1:09:45] progress with this our little thought he
[1:09:47] created everything Colossians chapter 1
[1:09:50] verse
[1:09:51] what he made he created everything yes
[1:09:55] nothing was created I was not created by
[1:09:58] Him and for his own good pleasure amen
[1:10:01] hallelujah amen you know we look at
[1:10:04] Jesus Jesus that body is what was
[1:10:08] begotten but the eternal spirit dwelt in
[1:10:11] that body yes amen and it cannot be born
[1:10:14] because that was God the Eternal Spirit
[1:10:17] the Loos the pillar of fire that became
[1:10:21] flesh Hallelujah I'm feeling good
[1:10:24] blessed be the name of the Lord amen so
[1:10:27] now the prophet says surely we can see
[1:10:31] what this word mean now to have any
[1:10:33] other interpretation of mean that God
[1:10:35] created God how could God be created
[1:10:38] when he himself is a
[1:10:40] Creator but now he is standing in the
[1:10:43] midst of the church as he stands there
[1:10:46] revealing who he is in this last age he
[1:10:49] calls himself the author of the creation
[1:10:53] of God this is another
[1:10:56] creation
[1:10:58] Hallelujah Jesus called himself the
[1:11:01] beginning of the creation of God or the
[1:11:04] author of the creation of God and the
[1:11:06] prophet of God is saying this is another
[1:11:10] creation yes Revelation 3:14 is written
[1:11:14] is written in uh red letter that shows
[1:11:17] it was Jesus himself that was speaking
[1:11:18] in there and he called himself the
[1:11:21] beginning of the creation of God Amen
[1:11:24] Hallelujah or the other oh brother

[1:11:53] that is the church amen
[1:11:56] Hallelujah and that is God's
[1:12:00] workmanship brother amen let's continue
[1:12:03] now this is another creation this has to
[1:12:06] do with the church this is a special

[1:12:40] his strength of your head right without
[1:12:43] God knowing about it amen we are
[1:12:45] privileged on Earth am to have Heavenly
[1:12:50] protection Hallelujah can I say

[1:13:04] president amen hallelujah of the United
[1:13:08] States of America and who could be more
[1:13:11] protected on Earth than the president of
[1:13:14] America but we are more
[1:13:16] protected than the president of America
[1:13:20] because we are his creation we are his
[1:13:22] workmanship yes right yes sir when this
[1:13:25] man finished producing this pit he loved
[1:13:28] it he admired it did he condemn it did

[1:13:48] new creation am all
[1:13:51] things are passed away and all things
[1:13:55] have become new but do you know church
[1:13:59] sometimes we don't we refuse to allow
[1:14:02] All Things become new because we refuse
[1:14:06] to detach from the past right we refuse
[1:14:10] to get detached from the past you have
[1:14:14] been forgiven but you are still carrying
[1:14:16] that guilt God does not remember but you
[1:14:18] are still remembering amen hallelujah
[1:14:21] amen and do you know sometimes we refuse
[1:14:24] to accept
[1:14:25] what God say we
[1:14:27] are right amen if a preacher is
[1:14:31] preaching your pastor is preaching sons
[1:14:33] of the Living God hallelujah you are

[1:14:57] it Hallelujah say born again you are
[1:15:01] Redeemed by his Precious Blood it become
[1:15:04] difficult to accept
[1:15:07] why it should be easier to believe God
[1:15:11] than to believe the devil right but do
[1:15:13] you know sometimes it's easy for us to
[1:15:15] believe the devil than to believe God
[1:15:18] you were saying the men's meeting there
[1:15:20] a brother was saying the devil trick us
[1:15:23] he trick us
