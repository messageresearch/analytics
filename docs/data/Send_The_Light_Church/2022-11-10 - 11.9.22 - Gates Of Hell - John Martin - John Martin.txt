[Music] Because He Lives he lives pocket faced tomorrow Because He Lives all our fear is gone because I know he holds our futures and life is worth the Living Just Because He Lives [Music] amen there is nothing to fear when we're in his hands amen think about all the the fear that's going on in the world just we see it going South we see it going down and yet we have a hope the world is full of fear but we know that he controls all things we're in his hands and we have a bright future and we look to the Lord for our comfort amen amen well praise the Lord God bless each of you that have come to God's house today and uh so so good I want to say Amen to what brother Ron had said the good report from Brother Bruce we're so thankful for what uh it could be a lot worse it could be a lot worse and Brother Bruce always does his homework he's uh he's the man to get if you want something done right he'll make sure it's done right and that's a really good quality to have amen well um how many has been thinking about the place of I don't care yeah brother Ferguson has been speaking to us in the men's meetings about being more sensitive and to the way that God would speak to us and the different ways that he would speak to us and brother Mark has been talking about the choices that we make are very important and I I just uh I feel that the enemy camouflages himself in areas right around us right in our own minds and our thoughts and we don't quite recognize it and the whole purpose of it is to expose the enemy so when he does come to us with little attitudes and things that we can quickly resist them because that's that's the greatest damage that he could do is inside of us and this is the only one that we have control over and us that are their husbands or heads of the home we have to watch out for our wives and our children and so seeing that I don't care creeping in is is you gotta you gotta get rid of it quickly and we we gotta bind together and bind together um tonight we want to talk about the Gates of Hell before we get there we're going to talk about the gates so turn with me if you would to Matthew chapter 7. we're looking forward to the fellowship this uh this Sunday it's just good to be together with brothers and sisters of light precious faith amen let's look to the Lord in in prayer let's also I don't know if a request got in for uh from sister Kathleen about her daughter Emily who's very sick with RSV virus and she's not getting better and and she wanted us to hold her up in prayer we know that she's been a big help to Sister Kathleen over there and if she's sick I'm not sure uh if she's able to help like she'd like to so if we could just remember her in prayers we go to him right now Heavenly Father we thank you that you've all that you've given each of us strength and health to be here today and Lord despite the battles and things that we have uh are going through Lord you have still blessed with with enough health and strength to be here we want to thank you from the bottom of our heart Lord as we look to you in prayer Lord we as brother Ron has prayed for brother Marty and sister Kathleen Lord we want them to to be here and healed and just worshiping you Lord as they used to when they were here and father her sister has a prayer request for her daughter that's been so faithful lord it's just been a real Saint and a real blessing Lord in so many ways and we just pray that Lord you would remember her tonight Lord as we unite together in prayer that you the great physician would go and do the complete work in her body you are that virus Lord that is taken over and Lord May our our next word that we hear that she's getting better that she's on the men Lord may you touch her we love you for it we thank you for it Lord Jesus Lord as we before we look into your word we ask God that you would prepare our hearts for it Lord give us the right ears to hear the the right heart to perceive to understand and give us the grace to walk in it and a Lord above everything give us the the proper Revelation that you'd have us to take from these scriptures or we commit this service to you and all the needs that we have into your hands for your honor we pray in Jesus name amen amen may God receive glory for every for every Revelation that he gives us amen amen Matthew chapter 7 starting with verse number 12. therefore all things whatsoever ye would men should do to you do ye even sow to them for this is the law and the prophets enter in at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in there at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it amen God bless you may be seated well everybody wants to be thought of the very best of it right the scripture says that we should think the very best of everybody because if if we're to do unto others like we want them to do unto us then we can never do we should never do anything you know or say anything ill or or we we should be what we want them to be of course our concept is we take upon ourselves often the place of God in other words what you do to me I'm going to pay back to you and I'll remember this because you did that and we're kind of taking the place of God and in reality the the law is that whatever we would want others to do to us that's what we should initiate to others not only do what we feel it is deserved but we need to initiate we need to be the one laying down the life for others and then Jesus gets in in speaking about the two gates because one gate is certainly going to not do that and and the Straight Gate is going to uh one of these Gates it leads to heaven to eternal life and we learn that's living for others so this one gate leads to living for others where the other gate it leads to a selfish life living for yourself and it it ends up turning into a destruction a destruction and I I'd like to kind of call this the Gate of Hell because it leads to a destruction the the gate that leads to life it's it's a Straight Gate where the other gate it's a wide gate and when you think about a Straight Gate you can think of like the The Straits of Mackinac The Straits of uh uh Gibraltar uh and most Straits um they they narrow down they come to a small a small opening and I think the smallest one is the Straits of Tatar and it's near uh near Russia somewhere over there and so it's really hard just to to take a big boat and just go through there real easy it's actually difficult when you're in the ocean you just go and you don't have to worry about things but when you come into a straight uh straight you got to pay attention when we're in um Georgia and um by Savannah others were the big barges uh come in there and it is so narrow where they got to go that they don't allow the drivers of the votes whatever they're called I don't know if they're called drivers or what but they don't allow them to drive the boats and they're not allowed to and Savannah the the shipping yard will take out their little tug bolts out there and they will be the ones that are doing the directing because it's so hard to navigate in there and this this gate that uh is the straight that leads to life is it's very it's a small a small uh area to get through and uh it's very very difficult to to make it through we know that Jesus is the Straight Gate he he he is the door and as great a God as he is uh his standard is is so so narrow you've heard of somebody being narrow-minded you know you're just so narrow-minded well Jesus is very narrow-minded he's very narrow-minded and and he has you have to stay with the word you can't deviate from the word and um in order to find this Straight Gate you literally have to seek it because the the Bible Jesus said few people find it yet all people want to go to heaven but why only a few people find it because they're not willing to seek but if you a little bit earlier in this chapter it talks about seek and you shall I knock the door shall be open and this is the way that you find God Is by pouring out your heart and seeking after God and then God chose you the way it's just it's all about relationship this this wide gate when you think about the wide gate let's just think about it's it's wide enough to fit any idea that man has any idea that man has can go through there any idea any religion and this is what I think that's what goes through that gate amen and that's it's it's very broad it's very spacious it it has room for anybody's idea but what are the gates of hell they're really demons tempting us to not do God's will whereas the Straight Gate it opens up to a narrow way and that way is Christ the thing is when we we think about these Gates we can think that we have already entered into this gate when we accepted Christ as our personal Savior and we repented and we got baptized and we we entered into that gate and if we say Amen to that uh I'm good to go with that but the way is narrow the way is narrow and we just can't take our foot off the gas because we've entered into the gate and kind of Coast the rest away and and just take certain scriptures and just you know I'm going to make it because I'm predestined it it just doesn't work like that there's a false sense of security and there's a true sense of security in Christ but you have to follow the way the gate it leads to the way and the way is straight and narrow that this way it's it's a harder way and if you if you look up that word narrow it means crowded with afflictions trouble sufferings tribulations this is God's way think about it this is the that's why it's so hard to find because nobody's excited about that I mean in God's way you're either in a trial or you're going to be going into one you don't spend much time just taking it easy the kingdom of God suffered violence and we've got to take it by force we've got to take it by force they that live golly shall suffer persecution so this way it's a harder way I would like us to view God's way as always being set before us just like we talked about this day for me and my house we're going to serve the Lord but we've got to make that decision every day it's not just I made the decision once so it's going to happen automatically it's not you're going to wake up and wanting to do your own thing because your flesh is just that way and so you it has to be it you have to teach uh yourself you have to learn from God to deny your flesh to crucify your flesh to mortify the Deeds of the body to put it under subjection so that the spirit of God can have the preeminence in our lives it's just not automatically going to happen there's a a lot of devils that want to distract us a lot of devils can we turn to Ezekiel chapter 3 verse chapter 3 and I want to start with verse number 16. I want to read some scriptures that I I believe should help encourage us I think all the scriptures should should help us encourage us they they're never meant to discourage us right right no these scriptures talk about our POS our position our relationship with God it's too often we get the the mindset that um because I've entered into the gate everything is okay because I've done these Works everything's okay and we can't we can't think like that we've got to think about an ongoing relationship an ongoing relationship Ezekiel chapter 3 verse 16 says and it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the Lord came unto me saying son to man I have made thee a Watchman over the house of Israel now I want you to put yourself in the position as a Watchman you are a Watchman you are a a servant of God uh someone that God uses to watch over somebody it's the truth you have a family you have a home you have a neighbor you have somebody you work with it this isn't just for for ministers that's correct therefore hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me notice where the warning's coming from when I say unto the wicked thou shall surely die thou and thou givest him not warning nor speakeas to warn the wicked from his Wicked Ways to save his life the same Wicked man shall die in his iniquity in his I don't care to do the will of God when I know but his blood what I require at thine hand that's why it's important to tell people the truth yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his Wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou has delivered thy Soul now now think about this I thought my soul was saved when I repented and I got baptized why do I need to keep saving my soul because if God tells you to do something if you don't do it your soul is required this is why we just can't hide behind something that we've done we've got to be thinking or being sensitive to what he's telling us today again when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commit commit iniquity commit yeah I know I but it's not that big a deal and lay and I lay a summoning pot before him he shall die because thou has not given him warning he shall die in his sin and the righteousness which he have done shall not be remembered but his blood will I require at thine hand so you know for the Lord to tell you that you need to say something to somebody this is serious business this is really serious we are our Brother's Keeper we have to be concerned about one another nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous sin not any and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he is warned also thou is delivered thy soul so the righteous man can sin and and fall off I mean the gates of hell are around us I mean think about the people who we thought would never go away look what's happened I thought certain people they would just be here day in day out service after service what happened I mean we were three more agents and at any time if we're not careful we could listen to the wrong spirits Ezekiel 18 verse 3. as I live saith the Lord God as I live saith the Lord God verse 4 behold All Souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die so God created the soul the soul belongs to him and he places in a body gives us opportunity to do what we want to do with it and by the grace of God he's using us today to help Souls get saved praise the Lord [Music] verse 20 the soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father notice this neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he have committed and keep all my statutes and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die so it's about your end result where the how the tree falls that's the way it lies so you know when we go to bed at night the Bible says don't let the the sun go down upon your wrath don't lay in that situation make sure you make surety of your friends and and and and and and keep the relationship fresh with God amen verse 24 but when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness so we can be righteous and turn away from our righteous and committed iniquity and do it according to all the Abominations that the Wicked Man do it shall he live question mark all his righteousness now that's why I want to get through all his righteousness that he have done shall not be mentioned how many times people rely on the things that they have done to set the Precedence of who they are and they bypass the attitude and spirit that they're walking with is that they're using these things as like credentials and and what God is interested in is is how we're living today do we have an i and I don't care attitude or or or are we very interested in every word of God that he wants us to do in his trespasses they have trespassed and in his sin that he have sinned in them shall we die yet ye say the way of the Lord is not equal hear now o House of Israel is not my way equal are not my your ways unequal so you can call God bad but he's calling you bad when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and commit iniquity and dieth in them for his iniquity that he have done shall he die for his iniquity that he have done shall he die again when the Wicked Man turneth away from his wickedness that he have committed and doeth that which is lawful right he shall save his soul alive I say if there's breath inside of a human being there is a chance for salvation we can't look at we can't look at things in judge you know a lot of times we judge people we just well look what they're at look what they're doing and we judge them and you we can never do that God has called us to help people just help people God is the one that has got to convict the heart and and soften the heart and make somebody get their heart right with God all right that was verse 27 28 because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he have committed he shall surely live he shall not die see so God is looking at the Turning Away not the past not the past I was talking to someone today at our shop and I just said you know the past has nothing to do with right now the past does not judge our future it shouldn't even judge our present it's our past verse 29 yet saith the house of Israel the way of the Lord is not equal all House of Israel are not my ways equal are not your ways unequal so say I went like uh 62 years and I just want to serve the Lord the best I can in 62 years and three months I decide you know what I just I'm so sick of this I want to do my own thing and I die at 64. now God is Fair is is he going to say oh oh 62 years two years oh yeah he's in it this does not matter if I do this it's very important how we are today it's very important our attitude when we come into the house of God when we leave how we are when we wake up how we are when we go to bed this is what God is looking at therefore I judge your house of Israel everyone according to his way saith the Lord God repent and turn yourself from all your transgressions so your iniquity shall not shall not be your ruin cast away from all your transgressions whereby you have transgress and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will you dial House of Israel for I have no pleasure in the death of him that died saith the Lord God wherefore turn yourselves and live ye praise God so if we could just in keep encouraging people to turn to turn to turn just keep turning turn towards the Lord in that if you just save one Soul think about it the worth of that soul is worth ten thousand worlds you cover a multitude of sin by just helping that one person turn towards the Lord the past does not mean a thing we just got to get away from the idea that are good deeds in our works the things that we have done they stand up as a president as credentials to allow us freedom and liberty to kind of do what we want to do God's way is living for God every day not claiming God every day but living for God every day you can claim God all day every day and live for yourself brother Brandon I've read this quote many times and I hope it's okay because to be honest with you if you're getting sick of this quote just pray for me that I live this quote that's just how I feel about it brother Brandon spoke this in a man running from the presence of the Lord he said how wishy-washy that's what too many Christians uh too many Christians today are so soft and soaked and everything until they think all they have to do is just join a church or go somewhere and put their name in the book do a little something jump up and down about shout say something like that and call it Christianity that's called Christianity but Christianity definition this is a brother Branham dictionary I believe it's coming from Heaven don't you Christianity is an everyday rugged life living for God in this present world you're not living for yourself you're living for God and he he goes in and describes what's happening on the inside it's a constant burning of the fire and the love of God in the heart and it sets you a fire and it puts you out yonder with people making converts how many converts have we been making he says converts to Christ and then he says this word responsibilities that's a responsibility being a Christian is a responsibility and brother Brian I'm saying there's too many people who who want to claim Christianity without responsibility he said but it's easy to go the way the world goes it's easy to flow down the streams go out there and sit down and in the river with your boat you get the your oars and start pulling up against the current you don't make much time and it goes hard but you just want once let loose to those oars and watch how fast the trees uh you pass the trees going down and look where you're going when things are just floating easy remember you're going towards a great cataract down there of some sort you're going towards the falls and it won't be long you'll be going over the falls just floating with the world easy the way it goes he says you don't want to do that no sir but you must accept your responsibilities so this is the thing that we are tempted the Gates of Hell attempt us with the easy path we're just taking it easy and God's saying we got a responsibility and and that responsibility isn't just one this this and make sure you got these four things checked off because at any given time at any given day God could be giving you more responsibilities what is he what is he really saying to us if we're supposed to be making Converse what are we doing to make converts and how often do I need to do that is that like a kind of a once a month kind of tradition a once a year only when God brings somebody in front of us I mean I mean we could go a long different ways here but the thing I'm trying to to get to is that this is the way of Christ and and the the gates of hell are broad they're easy they're just you know have any excuse you want to do anything you want and God is calling us away from that to be aware of it we just got to get away from thinking that good things put us in the Kingdom or in favor with God Matthew chapter 7. I want to start here with verse number 18 Matthew chapter 7 verses 15 to 20 discusses God's way is not a mixed fruit God's way that straight nearby it's not a mixed fruit he says in verse 18 a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit so no we are all mixed creatures right we all make mistakes every day and and sometimes people can look at us and they couldn't tell us from a sinner we couldn't tell us a difference from a sinner because we have acted wrong we've we've we've handled a situation wrong we we've uh brother Brandon says it's not the action but the reaction that really counts and and and we've all come short of the glory of God and that's not what I'm referring to what I'm referring to is on a day in day out basis our fruit should be the same our fruit should be the same and he said in verse 20 wherefore by their fruits you shall know them it's the fruits not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven makes it real real clear that one gate you don't have to do the will of God and the other gate you have to remember and and and and the thing that I'm concerned about is not the 18 scriptures that I know in the Bible right right I'm concerned about all the things that God's thinking about me what is he expecting of me the fruit of God is looking for our lives to do all of his will verse 22 many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cussed out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so these believers who profess to belong to Christ they never departed from iniquity they they never departed from knowing to do something about God's will and not doing it they never got away from that they held why they why they did these words for they prophesied boy they cast out Devils why they exercised why they use the name of Christ why they Proclaim Christianity they were still a part of them that knew other things that they should be doing and declined to do them this is this is part of the Gospel this is part of the gospel and and I it would be nice to come to church and to have the preacher just say well you need to be doing this and you need to be doing that you need to and then be okay now I know what I need to do and go do it but you know God wants us to ask him Lord show me what I'm missing show me what I need to be doing because the time that I literally turned it down I didn't want to do it and I just got involved in my own will but brother Brandon says if you want to find out where God's at he's right where you left him and if he told you to do something he wants you to go back there and I don't care if it's one one week one month or 20 years he'll meet you right back at that spot because his word is eternal we read this last service second Timothy chapter 2 verse 19. nevertheless the foundation of God stand Asher having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ move away get away from iniquity so these these people that cast out devils and did all these wonderful things they never had the seal they never had the seal because the Bible says uh the foundation of God stand is sure having this seal the seal is you will depart from iniquity you you have to the Holy Ghost will it will let you stay in that condition it will get every bit out of us I'm not afraid that we know one another's iniquity because we got it when I'm afraid of is us getting comfortable with it that's what I'm afraid of because if we make excuses for we won't depart we've made it a reason to allow it and God is calling us to move away and it's different for you than for me it's different for me than you but it's a realness and the the gates of how are constantly there trying to get us to do our will that's what those gates are there they're all about us so we don't even realize that how close the devil gets to us the devil gets so close to us he could literally use me right yeah have did you ever hear anybody say that's just a devil talking out of you well what what did Jesus say to Peter get behind me Satan anyway we're just going against the will of God it's always doing is going against the will of God it was a horrible thing caught him to to devil to come out of Peter to to to get behind him and stop stop filling his mind with that because thou Savers the things that belongeth to man and not to God as we strive to walk in God's way he's continually showing us because the Bible says when he the spirit of truth will come he will lead and guide you into all truth now as he's showing us it's it's real easy I mean um you're going to go to a wedding they're going to open the door for you and they're going to just say you just come sit right here and you feel oh I get to sit here and you feel real good you think boy if the Lord it just shows me like that the way of truth that's just that's comfortable I can handle that but if he tells me you got to give up this you're going to suffer this you're going to be persecuted for this you've got to lay it on your life for this person you got to pray for this person you've got to give up time and you well all of a sudden this note is appealing and is enjoyable as the other way and so as we're thinking God's showing us his way it's not pampered with enjoyment I mean when God took brother by Adam's wife away and his daughter I believe God was showing brother Brandon something that God's will is preeminent it needs to be preeminent in our lives and I'll tell you I mean there's a lot of people that wanted to be a prophet and have that discernment and I'll tell you the things he had to go through I would have lost all my family I would lost everything I had you understand and it's it's the grace of God that we're here today but we must take this seriously that God is trying to teach us continuously not to of course our flesh is always wanting to be satisfied with where we're at to feel like we've attained and and and but we need to have that attitude that Paul had I haven't attained I'm pressing towards where Christ wants me to be it just needs to be there on a regular basis Isaiah 55 verse 6. we have to put everything we have into it to find the will of God now I'm not speaking about the will of God whether he should lead you to buy this car or that car or this house or that house or things like that but I'm talking about the leadership of the Lord for what he wants you to do today it's something we don't think about often we get up in the day and we go about our day I'm going to work I'm doing this and and really God has a will for us and it's just important to call on God and say God what would you have me to do amen all right Isaiah 55 verse 6 seek ye the Lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near don't you wish sometimes when you went to pray you could just feel his presence let the wicked forsake his way let the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and he will have mercy upon him to our and to our God for he will abundantly pray what a promise I'm okay with uh viewing myself is wicked is unrighteous as of needing Mercy is needing Grace I'm okay with that because it's so dangerous to be to just only claiming myself as I'm a righteous Son of God I'm okay with that when the devil is trying to attack me but the Lord wants me to remain humble because he gives more grace to the humble not the proud not the arrogant remember he says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways so he's already making it clear that the way that a natural man is the broad way for as the heaven is higher than the earth or my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts are then then your thoughts and you just the examples remember when Naaman he wanted to go wash in the The Cleaner rivers and didn't didn't want to go washing dirty his own understanding he was leaning on because he just couldn't understand why God would make him lower himself to go wash in some dirty water or why God would use us to lower ourselves to go help somebody who's in in a dirty situation but it's God's way it's God's way Psalms 16 verse 11 says Thou will show me the path of life amen there's a way that seemeth right unto man right but it's the end of death but the Holy Ghost will leading against all truth thou will show me the path of life and in thy presence is fullness of joy how many wants Joy the remedy's right there just create an atmosphere where his presence just comes hard to have God around you without the joy of the Lord amen at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more amen back to Matthew chapter 7 verse 24. we want to build our life every day on the rock amen therefore whosoever heareth the sayings of mine and do with them I will liken unto him liking unto I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock so you don't got to be a brain surgeon you don't gotta know how to do a lot of things all you have to do is have a heart to want to do what you hear at church when you put a tape on when you read your Bible when you get down on your knees to pray have a heart to do those things and you will be wise you will be wise and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell not for it was founded upon Iraq of course it was Jesus Christ it was the word of God [Music] and everyone that heareth these Saints of mine and doeth them not again talking about this iniquity shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand in other words he was able to build it it was strong enough to build a life remember the foolish virgin they had some oil but it went out they didn't build their house upon the rock because that rock said you got to get the seal and the rain just said and the floods came the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall of it so I don't care how much God has ever used me I don't mean that in a disrespectful way to God I don't mean it that it doesn't mean anything about my future what's important to me is can I can I go back to the last time God spoke to me and can I see myself doing it that's what I want to look like that's what's important because that's what that's what my life is being built on and if you can see that I say praise God but if you can't see that we need to be paying attention to the things that God is saying and you need to see yourself you need to Envision yourself doing what he told you to do no matter if it's just between you and God or it involves somebody else it's important God wouldn't have said it to you if it wasn't brother Branham said in the message from that time he says oh you got good intentions certainly hell is paid with with good intentions you don't think that you think that that's the way to do it he says you're just presuming that you're in the way that you should do it so presuming presuming didn't David say keep back your servant from presumptuous sin just assuming that what I'm doing it's going to be okay my intention this was my intention I I feel that that has a place but we can't just keep doing that you know take time to pray take time to seek God to be this to be serious about it because a lot of people can be sincere and have good intentions but they're sincerely wrong now our flesh is an enemy of God every one of us God hates our flesh God does not love your flesh more than mine you don't even love your flesh now one ounce of it I would say that the gates of hell are continually after us and they're they they they do things to appeal to our flesh they try to entice us into thinking the way that the world thinks and since we were brought up that way to do what we want to do we're very uh it's easy for us to get sick sucked into that and and and so we not we must remember that no matter how spiritual or how long that we've been saved or or how close we think we are at God our flesh is still our flesh and it will always be an enemy of God and we must make sure that we're we're in tune spiritually to the Lord Romans 8 verse 6 is for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded that's life and peace so in other words if this is what God said we need to do this needs to be important we need to be doing this we need to be making a plan for this we need to put this in our home we need to put this in our life we need to get serious we need to get this in our church we need to be we need to be praying we need to be saving Souls if I need to be doing this daily this is what I should be doing that's what God wants to see because the carnal mind is enmity it's against God it is not subject to the law of God now here's the catcher neither indeed can be that's right well no matter what you try to do in a carnal State you're always going to be in opposite sides with God if you do not take your time to crucify your flesh and get into the spirit you will never be able to make God happy you'll never please him you'll never get on the same wavelength with them God he just hates our flesh it gets us in trouble the Broadway it's a worldly way of thinking it's worldly wisdom worldly understanding worldly knowledge it's just worldly now God's way is it's higher his his wisdom is from above it's first peaceful and gentle easy to be entreated without partiality without respect to persons and and you you you sow peace it's just two different wisdoms two different knowledges I'll give you a little example Proverbs 23 verse 12 says apply thy heart unto instruction in thy ears in thy ears to the words of knowledge withhold not correction from the child for if thou bedest him with the rod he shall not die how many times have I I happened seven seven kids I have asked the question many times is this too much am I going too far and I'm so glad God does not stop correcting me no matter how bad I am no matter what I've done because he's he's going to save my soul and we need to think about that with our children thou shall beat him with the rod and thou and shall deliver his soul from hell so here you are you're beating his flesh to save his soul from hell wow there's a connection there's a connection and he also warns us of worldly wisdom and if you read Proverbs we learn about the wisdom of Solomon and it also talks about the wisdom of the world in contrast with one another in Proverbs 7 verse 27 if I could say it like this worldly wisdom and understanding is the way to hell going down to the chambers of death and that's what worldly wisdom and worldly understanding will do Proverbs 15 verse 24 the way of life is above to the wise that he may depart from Hell beneath from these Gates of Hell amen when I think about if you want to turn to Jonah chapter 2 when I think about uh Jonah the gates of hell was after Jonah absolutely the demons got Jonah to enter into iniquity the place of knowing to do good and not doing it he entered the place of I don't care when God told him you need to go to Nineveh you need to preach the gospel well his attitude was I don't want to so he knew to do good and was doing it not he kind of went off in his way I'm just going to kind of do my thing and nobody's going to know about it people on the ship didn't know about it but God knew about it God knew about it Jonah chapter 2 verse 1. then Jonah prayed unto the Lord is God out of the fish's belly and said I cried by reason of my inflation unto the Lord and he heard me and out of the valley of Hell the belly of Hell cried I that's how how how much it was it let his this broad way this broad way of thinking his his own Brewery wisdom if I just don't go then you know Nineveh you know they're just gonna perish because God will have to kill him foreign leads to hell this idea of doing your own thing leads to hell but he said I cried cried I and thou heard us my voice for thou has cast me into the deep in the midst of the Sea and the floods come past me about all the Billows and the waves they passed me over then I said I am cast out of thy sight think about this he went his way away from God away from God's will he got to a place where he realized that he was separated from God and he said yet I will look again toward the Holy Temple he realized he realized that he had to turn towards God he had to repent the Bible's we read it the the wicked man turned from his Wicked Ways and and do the will of God that God would hear it was about relationship it's about where we're at today the waters come past me about even to the soul so not just the body but the soul The Depths closed me around about the weeds wrapped around my head I went down to the bottoms of the mountain the Earth and her bars was about me forever yet has thou brought up my life from corruption oh Lord my God when my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord that's what we got to do we got to remember the Lord not anything else just remember the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thy Holy Temple they that observed lion vanities they forsake their own mercies that we got to get our mind on the Lord the Lord has mercies new every day for us amen but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed we've all vowed I will live for you Lord I will serve you that's a vow that he expects us to keep the gates of hell are trying to keep us from doing that and the Lord's spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon dry land the Gates of Hell shook Jonah but I want you to catch this it never prevailed because Jonah already had the word inside of them the bride already has the word of God inside of her she can get shook up she can get shaken but it can't prevail because she has the word and it's the only thing that the Gates of Hell cannot come against so we see that Jonah went through this God's Prophet it was a terrible thing surely but the word was still in him he just God had to get him to the place that he could realize that there's this is death going this way you know when he said I'm just not going to go to an interview I'm going to go over here I'm going to go do this he wasn't realizing that there was death waiting him he was just thinking he was getting out of his responsibility but God had to show him no it's not going to go the way you think this way that you're thinking if you keep going it's death and it's I remember the Lord I do I don't want to be away from him and I know that he has Mercy for me and that's that's how we've got to be every day just just turn to the Lord with a soft heart and serve him amen and this message called in his presence and brother Brown was just starting out and he was reading Isaiah chapter 6 when Isaiah went in into the temple there and he got into the presence of the Lord and he saw the angels and it was just all a holy holy situation and uh brother Branham I'm just going to pick up right here and just quoting and he laid he laid it upon my mouth talking about the the coals off the fire and Lowell this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged now before he went into there I don't believe that he thought that he had iniquity in sin because remember when he first this first happened he said well unto me boom I'm a man of unclean lips but it wasn't until he was in the presence of the Lord that he realized that yeah and I heard the voice of the Lord saying who shall I send and who shall go forth then said I here am I send me presence of the Lord will do that this is what he went to say may the Lord bless his word I think that's a most striking scripture that we find that in the presence of God men recognize themselves to be sinners he says we may feel pretty good when we're out different places and feel like that we're pretty good people right but when you ever come into the presence of God then we see how little we are I'll tell you if we knew that we couldn't get away with iniquity we wouldn't try it but it's when those Gates of Hell can can get us to think that it's okay we'll be okay the Gates of Hell came to Jesus Matthew chapter 4 and the first thing they tried to get him to identify who he was just like Satan comes to us well if you're a real Christian how many times we wonder are we a real Christian get trying to get us to to question our identity where we stand those that's the gates of hell that we're trying to Prevail against Jesus and and said you know if if you could just bow down and surrender your will to mine this thing is all be over you can have the whole kingdoms of the world because that's what the big thing was I will make my throne above the Throne of God I will be like the most high that's been on Satan's mind ever since and he tried to get Jesus just here you you can have it all he wanted it he came to Earth To Die For Us he wanted us but he didn't want us all to be under Satan and that's what Satan tries to get us to do he tries to get us to compromise just compromise just do this just do that this doesn't matter if that doesn't matter and I'll give you what you want that's why it's more healthy not to want you you're not as tempted right but so that's that's why Jesus said how hard it is for a rich man to enter in because when you got money no you got power to to do a lot with it to buy a lot of stuff to do a lot of stuff it just you fall into a lot of the Bible says a hurtful lust and and and and trials and things all right Matthew chapter 6 verse 13. oh my time has slipped away a little bit on us I'll I'll try to make this great this is a midweek service and I don't mean to take us long but I I hope this is being a blessing Matthew 16 verse 13 when Jesus came under the coast of caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am now Jesus knew he was going to get a big broad view of who he people thought he was that's just the way of the world people are leaning their own understanding their own thoughts and they said some say that they are John the Baptist Elias others Jeremiahs or or one of the prophets there's a big view of who Jesus was just like today you have so many different churches out there so many people going to different churches and oh I go to this church I go to that church and because they feel this is God this is where God is at and he saith unto them but who do you say that I am now he's asking his own disciples for Jesus's identity and this truly is really what it comes down to are we building our life upon the rock and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God amen I love this because Peter identifies himself as Jesus Christ being the unadulterated word of God the absolute and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou sign member Jonah for Flesh and Blood did not tell you to you you didn't hear it at church you didn't read it from a book you didn't hear it from Robin's shoulders somebody that was in the message a while it didn't come from flesh and blood but my Father which is in heaven now I'll tell you this just throws out the crutches and the everything from somebody who doesn't want to dig into Christ for themselves we can't find security just in being in the right Church we've got to find Christ for ourselves and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it the gates of hell this entrance of I don't care about doing all of God's will it shall for it won't Prevail over us because you've heard from God when you just hear from a man well it's not a big thing I mean can't do everything I mean it's but when you hear from God it's personal it means something to you we have a promise when we receive the word of God you may be shaken but Satan will not Prevail amen I mean we can say well look what Peter went through he had a revelation of Jesus who Jesus was and here he denies Christ but I'm telling you when he denied Christ the word of God was in him because Jesus prayed for him that his faith would fail not right you know we go through a lot of ups and downs and we expect we kind of judge people and ourselves of a certain plateau about our ups and downs and when we've done this we think oh my we just oh we're up here we think we're something but in reality it's the word of God that's hidden our heart David said I hide that word that I had not sin against thee amen he got shaken there he did not have the Seal of the Holy Ghost and you know we're going to get shaken we just need to receive more of God more Holy Ghost uh if you're sealed get another one that's not that's not doctrinal that's not that's not a message that was I'm just saying don't stop but seeking more of the Holy Ghost let's Stand Together oh my my you get time read Hebrews chapter 12. 25-29 the devil is trying to shake us the Lord is going to shake heaven and earth all right there's a shaking coming but we've received a kingdom that cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably and how is that with reverence and godly fear amen amen let's bow our hearts Heavenly Father we thank you for this precious word it's your word and Lord we know that we're facing demons every day and they're seeking whom they may devour and Lord we want you to fortify us we want you to uh feel so full of your spirit and Lord May our our attitude always be one that we just want to please you all the time that we just want to obey what you
