[37:57] verse number 18 remember ye
[38:01] not the former things neither consider
[38:06] the things of old amen God bless you may
[38:09] be seated remember ye not the former
[38:12] things neither consider the things of
[38:16] old this thought came on our heart when
[38:19] we were up
[38:21] north and
[38:24] uh last night we were sitting at the
[38:26] table and as I was sitting there brother
[38:28] Mark was to my left as he is today and
[38:30] he says I wonder what things will
[38:32] remember what things we'll forget when
[38:34] we're in heaven and when we get on the
[38:37] other side little did he know our
[38:40] message this
[38:41] morning was learning to forget want to
[38:44] entitled this message learning to
[38:47] forget there are things that we need to
[38:49] learn to forget and there are things
[38:51] that we need to learn to
[38:54] remember Malachi 3:6 says then they then
[38:58] they that feared the Lord spake often
[39:00] one to another and the Lord hearkened
[39:03] and heard it in a book of remance was
[39:06] written for before him for them that
[39:09] feared the Lord and that thought upon
[39:13] his
[39:14] name so God wants us to remember
[39:18] everyone that fears
[39:20] God and that talks about the good things
[39:24] of the
[39:25] Lord Isaiah 49: vers 15 can a woman
[39:28] forget her suckling
[39:31] child that she should not have
[39:34] compassion on the son of her
[39:37] womb yay they may
[39:40] forget yet will I not forget thee amen
[39:44] behold I have Graven thee upon the palms
[39:47] of my hand amen God wants us to remember
[39:52] certain things we'll call them important
[39:55] things things like Proverbs 3:1 my son
[40:00] forget not my law but let thine heart
[40:04] keep my Commandments he doesn't want us
[40:06] to forget the law verse number three let
[40:10] not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind
[40:13] them about thy neck write them upon the
[40:15] tables of thy heart he wants Mercy to be
[40:19] inside of us around us and Truth amen
[40:23] Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse5 and thou
[40:25] shalt love the Lord thy God with all all
[40:27] thy heart with all thy soul with all thy
[40:29] might and these words which I command
[40:31] thee this day shall be in thy heart and
[40:33] thou shalt teach them diligently not
[40:36] just once in a while not just at church
[40:39] right that's right Thou shalt teach them
[40:42] diligently unto thy children and shall
[40:44] talk of them when thou sest in thine
[40:46] house and when thou wst by the way and
[40:49] when thou liest down when thou riseth up
[40:52] and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
[40:54] thy hand and they shall be as frontlets
[40:56] between thine eyes
[40:58] can't miss them and thou shalt write
[41:00] them upon the pulse of the house and on
[41:02] thy Gates God does not want us to forget
[41:06] the importance that we should love the
[41:09] Lord with everything that we have and
[41:11] teach it to our family our wives teach
[41:13] it to our husband teach it to our
[41:15] children our children teach it to our
[41:17] parents just keep it going amen amen 1
[41:21] Corinthians chapter 15 verse 1 just
[41:24] laying a a a Long Foundation as you have
[41:28] have learned by
[41:30] now moreover Brethren I declare unto you
[41:33] the
[41:34] gospel which I preached unto you which
[41:37] also you have received and wherein you
[41:39] stand today by the which you are saved
[41:43] if you keep in memory what I preached
[41:46] unto you unless you had believed in vain
[41:48] so it's important not to just come to
[41:50] church and for the moment understand
[41:53] what is being said to kind of agree with
[41:56] what's being said but what's important
[41:58] when you come to church is to take the
[42:00] word with you you know the parable about
[42:02] the bird that came by and he took what
[42:05] was swn in the person's heart the word
[42:07] that was actually sown in the heart and
[42:09] we we got to take it we got to we got we
[42:12] got to eat the word we got to become the
[42:13] word and we we cannot just you know
[42:16] forget the things of
[42:19] God God doesn't want us to
[42:22] forget about calvary or all the things
[42:25] that he has done for us personally
[42:27] he certainly doesn't want us to forget
[42:30] his
[42:30] word the word that is preached to us
[42:34] James chapter 1 verse 22 but be ye doers
[42:38] of the word and not hearers only
[42:41] deceiving yourself for for man be hear
[42:43] of the word not a doer is like unto a
[42:45] man beholding his natural face in the
[42:48] glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth
[42:50] his way and straightway forgiveth that's
[42:53] right what manner of man he was so God
[42:56] does not want us to just forget when we
[42:59] get conviction and God speaks to us and
[43:02] we feel that we need to start praying
[43:04] more or reaching out more or spending
[43:07] more time uh washing somebody's feet or
[43:10] whatever it is that God's dealing with
[43:12] we need to remember to put those things
[43:14] and not forget those things amen that's
[43:16] right 1 Timothy 4:6 if thou put the
[43:20] brethren in remembrance of these things
[43:22] Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus
[43:24] Christ nourished up in the words of
[43:26] faith and Doctrine where to thou has
[43:29] attained so God wants us to put these
[43:31] things in remembrance one with another
[43:34] the body washing the body helping one
[43:36] another get keeping things going on the
[43:38] right track God has certain things that
[43:40] he wants us to remember amen I believe
[43:43] God does never wants us to forget who we
[43:46] are amen that we belong to God and that
[43:49] he is calling us and transforming us
[43:51] into the image of Jesus Christ
[43:57] there are things that God wants us to
[43:59] learn how to forget that's
[44:01] right for a subject today I want to take
[44:04] the first step in moving forward is
[44:07] forgetting the
[44:10] past as far as our last service for 2020
[44:15] I would like to say this I'm glad 2020
[44:18] is
[44:20] over it's been a very discouraging
[44:24] year it started out with a pandemic that
[44:27] quickly escalated into a world of panic
[44:32] and fear it's rippled even into next
[44:36] year and maybe for the years to
[44:41] come it rocked our nation's economy with
[44:44] multiple
[44:45] shutdowns for the first time in my 60
[44:49] years I was commanded to wear a mask in
[44:53] order to stop the spread of an unknown
[44:55] virus for the first time time in 60
[44:57] years I was commanded to stay away from
[45:00] other human
[45:01] life and they call it social
[45:05] distancing it has brought distress upon
[45:08] Nations as Jesus taught as a snare It
[45:11] Came Upon the face of the
[45:13] Earth anxiety Rose
[45:16] drastically it has caused depression to
[45:19] increase divorce to increase suicide to
[45:22] increase a Madness of hate has
[45:25] increased leing this world in a greater
[45:29] state of fear and
[45:31] uncertainty Luke 21: 26 Jesus said men's
[45:36] Hearts failing them for fear and for
[45:39] looking after those things which are
[45:41] coming on the earth the powers of Heaven
[45:45] shall be shaken and I I you could just
[45:48] tell everybody's wondering what else is
[45:51] going to happen what's coming next how
[45:53] bad is this going to happen men's hearts
[45:55] are failing for fear
[45:59] it's caused many churches to not be able
[46:01] to meet worship
[46:03] together I want to say I'm glad 2020 is
[46:08] over we all could come up with a list of
[46:11] reasons why we want to put this year
[46:13] behind
[46:15] us but it's really hard for anyone to
[46:18] move forward when there's such an
[46:20] uncertainty about the future now this is
[46:24] what we're all facing and it's even
[46:25] harder to move forward when our present
[46:28] state is exactly the same as our
[46:32] past it's no different with our
[46:34] spiritual walk with the Lord the first
[46:37] step in moving forward with Christ is to
[46:40] leave your past in the past you cannot
[46:44] move forward in faith when you're
[46:45] hanging on to your
[46:48] past in our opening scripture in Isaiah
[46:50] remember ye not the former things
[46:54] neither consider the things
[46:57] of old there are four things I want to
[47:00] focus on this morning that we need to
[47:02] learn to forget one is your
[47:06] sins second is your brother's
[47:09] sins third is your achievements that's
[47:12] good and the fourth is your
[47:17] sufferings your past sins if there's one
[47:20] important thing that you must practice
[47:23] is learning to forget is your past your
[47:26] past
[47:27] sins your
[47:28] transgressions your iniquities your
[47:32] shortcomings if we've
[47:35] repented if and we
[47:38] believe then Jesus can't even remember
[47:47] them if you don't put them behind you
[47:50] they're always next to
[47:55] you they're always standing in the way
[47:58] Ephesians
[47:59] 4:31 just pulling some scriptures here
[48:02] we're going to kind of move a little
[48:03] fast if it's okay let all bitterness and
[48:06] wrath and anger and
[48:08] Glamour and evil speaking be put away
[48:13] from you with all malice so put it away
[48:16] don't keep it with you get it
[48:22] away Colossians chapter 3 verse 8
[48:26] Colossians chapter
[48:27] 3:8 but now he also put off all these
[48:33] anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy
[48:36] communication out of your mouth get it
[48:38] in the past put it away from you put it
[48:41] behind you get it away from your life
[48:44] get it out of your mind away from your
[48:46] thoughts amen that's good if you allow
[48:50] Satan to keep your mistakes in the
[48:52] Forefront of your mind they will most
[48:54] definitely keep you from moving for
[48:56] forward in God they will lead you away
[48:59] from Victory they will lead you away
[49:01] from Joy from peace you won't feel
[49:05] strong enough to move forward into the
[49:07] things that God has for you so don't
[49:10] allow Satan to keep you stuck in your
[49:15] past his job is he wants to keep you
[49:19] there
[49:20] Jonah was stuck in his past
[49:27] he made a decision to do his own will
[49:29] instead of following through with what
[49:31] God had asked him to do which was be a
[49:33] witness for him that's right and no
[49:36] matter what he did where he went or how
[49:38] hard he tried he really couldn't move
[49:41] forward he was stuck in his mind because
[49:44] of a wrong decision that haunted him
[49:46] every single day right so with a a last
[49:50] ditch effort to try to get rid of this
[49:53] thing he he went down to and found a
[49:56] ship going to
[49:58] tarus and we all know the story of
[50:02] Jonah he could not Escape his past sin
[50:07] that he
[50:09] made and I don't think God wanted him to
[50:12] praise
[50:15] God he was finally thrown overboard you
[50:19] know the
[50:20] story Satan had tormented Jonah about
[50:24] the sin to his Bitter End
[50:29] Jonah got selfish with his his personal
[50:32] will he got angry and rebellious against
[50:36] God and he ran from God and from doing
[50:39] his will now that's what happened to
[50:41] Jonah and that thing kept him from being
[50:44] able to move forward no matter where he
[50:46] went what he did what he tried to do he
[50:48] couldn't escape that in his
[50:52] mind so what did Jonah
[50:54] do he forgot
[50:57] about his former decision that he made
[51:00] of his own will he repented and he
[51:03] turned around by changing his decision
[51:06] he remembered not the former thing he
[51:09] considered not that dumb decision that
[51:12] he made of old amen the Bible says that
[51:15] Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God and
[51:17] out of the fish's belly he cried by the
[51:19] reason of his Affliction unto the Lord
[51:22] so I'll say no matter how stuck you are
[51:25] in your situation how much seaweeds is
[51:28] wrapped around your head you're not
[51:31] [Music]
[51:33] stuck I don't care how many times you
[51:35] blown up got upset said something you
[51:38] said you shouldn't have said you're not
[51:41] stuck they that observe lying vanities
[51:45] forsake their own
[51:47] mercies let the past be the past if you
[51:51] allow the devil to sit there and say
[51:52] this is really who you are you're
[51:54] nothing but a no download good you're no
[51:57] Christian you're just a sit or faking it
[52:00] as long as you stay there you're
[52:01] forsaken the mercies that God has for
[52:03] you you can't expect to be
[52:06] perfect right we don't uh we're not
[52:11] acting like we're perfect people we
[52:14] serve a perfect God who perfectly
[52:16] forgives us that's the only thing that's
[52:19] perfect
[52:21] [Music]
[52:22] am the blood makes us perfect
[52:27] don't allow Satan to keep you stuck in
[52:29] your past no matter what sin you have
[52:34] sinned come
[52:36] on don't even go
[52:39] there it will keep you from the victory
[52:42] of moving forward in Christ which is
[52:44] what God's will is for your
[52:47] life he doesn't sit up there in a
[52:51] book and write
[52:54] down what degree of a sinner you are
[52:57] this
[52:58] weeken or what degree of a of a
[53:01] Christian you are this
[53:04] week it's simple you're covered with the
[53:07] blood or you're not you're forgiven or
[53:10] you're not there is nothing in
[53:16] between the whole church could get into
[53:19] a a a situation where they're just uh
[53:23] caught up in in in in a spot that they
[53:26] can't move
[53:32] forward because look alls we are in this
[53:35] church is a combination of what we are
[53:38] in our homes we ain't anything different
[53:41] than
[53:42] that so you bring your problems
[53:45] here we just got more problems in the
[53:48] church you bring your doubts here we got
[53:50] more doubts in the
[53:52] church but if you bring more
[53:54] expectation hey
[53:57] God can
[53:58] move We Are Who We Are this church is
[54:02] what we are and it's okay how you
[54:06] are but you must come with an
[54:09] expectation that this hospital has a
[54:12] doctor amen that can meet every need
[54:14] that we
[54:16] have and it comes through faith it does
[54:20] not come through feeling it does not
[54:22] come through emotion it's by faith
[54:30] Lord especially after this year we could
[54:34] get stuck in a in in and be tormented
[54:39] with just doubts and
[54:41] fears by the Devils every single time we
[54:46] come to
[54:47] church anybody ever been bombarded with
[54:50] well it's just going to be the same old
[54:52] same
[54:54] old that little gentle
[54:58] thought tell me is that the
[55:01] expectation that is anti
[55:05] only
[55:10] belief so we can sing only believe or we
[55:13] can only
[55:15] believe I'd rather only believe than
[55:17] sing only believe now we can't do both
[55:21] but we create an atmosphere
[55:24] amen I don't want to get stuck
[55:27] stuck in that
[55:30] state the devil saying oh you can't get
[55:33] the Holy Ghost you can't overcome that
[55:37] you can't get healed you can't be
[55:39] delivered you've gone too far you've
[55:43] already got upset today before you got
[55:45] to church oh you'll never walk in the
[55:48] spirit right we all have our own
[55:52] goliaths in the land that we got to take
[55:55] out
[55:57] or never possess
[55:59] it we got to slay
[56:02] them the Bible says that Goliath of gath
[56:06] was a champion from the camp of the
[56:08] Philistines who drew near the camp every
[56:12] morning and every evening for 40
[56:16] days and he stood and he cried unto the
[56:19] armies of Israel and said unto them I
[56:21] defy the armies of Israel this day give
[56:24] me a man that we may fight
[56:28] together I want you to think about being
[56:33] tormented every day for 40
[56:37] days now forget 40 days because some of
[56:41] us it's been you know 40
[56:44] months but I'm gonna yeah yeah that's
[56:46] right brother but this is why I say that
[56:48] word 40 it just all it's doing at this
[56:51] point is representing tribulation not a
[56:54] certain amount of time
[56:57] but it's the same thing over and over
[57:00] haunting you you're stuck in a situation
[57:04] that you just can't seem to break
[57:05] through
[57:08] from and everyone in the church camp was
[57:11] paralyzed by the giant demon tormenting
[57:13] their minds every single day I defy you
[57:18] being a Believer and trusting in the
[57:20] promises of God I defy you being an
[57:24] overcomer trusting God to overcome your
[57:27] situation I defy you being able to
[57:30] withstand the doubts in flares that that
[57:32] flood our
[57:36] minds Now That's what Satan does every
[57:39] single
[57:42] time and we get scared we just sit there
[57:45] we're afraid to say
[57:48] Amen afraid to say I believe this word
[57:50] with all my heart I believe this message
[57:54] I'll live for it I'll die for it I'll
[57:56] stand for I will manifest
[57:59] it so we just sit there and we
[58:02] just okay if you say
[58:07] so as long as their mind was stayed on
[58:11] their former problem it paralyzed them
[58:15] they couldn't do anything they just
[58:16] stood there they had no
[58:19] plan day after
[58:22] day and as long as our minds are kept
[58:25] considering the them things of old in
[58:26] our lives we'll never be able to move
[58:29] forward in
[58:30] Christ we've got to free oursel from the
[58:33] past before we can move forward free
[58:35] oursel from the past amen don't allow
[58:39] the devil to keep
[58:41] fear in your
[58:43] mind keeping you from
[58:46] freedom God wants to set us
[58:49] free I'll tell you I've been set
[58:53] free but I've also been called in
[58:57] bondage by the snare of the devil and
[58:59] he's he's just walking
[59:03] around seeking who may devour wants to
[59:05] put a snare on
[59:07] somebody it's his
[59:12] job and I don't see anywhere in the
[59:14] Bible where God has ever asked you to be
[59:18] perfect from the day that you gave your
[59:20] heart to the day you leave here
[59:26] I see a whole book just trying to tell
[59:28] us which way to go what to do in our
[59:31] present situations and to let us know
[59:34] that we have an expected End Amen so we
[59:37] need to learn to forget the former
[59:39] things the things of old and move
[59:41] forward in
[59:44] godall David would not allow his mind to
[59:46] be suppressed by the thoughts of bondage
[59:49] that were coming from all the people
[59:51] that were around
[59:54] him just that
[59:59] negativity he had the correct mindset as
[1:00:02] brother Bram said the right mental
[1:00:05] attitude and you know
[1:00:08] what he had what he needed to take care
[1:00:11] of their paralyzed
[1:00:13] problem he said who is this
[1:00:16] unbeliever that he should defy the
[1:00:19] armies of the Living God David said let
[1:00:22] no man's heart fail because of this
[1:00:27] Spirit God has not given us the spirit
[1:00:30] of fear amen but of power and of love
[1:00:34] and of a sound mind and I believe David
[1:00:36] had a sound mind he said I will go and
[1:00:40] fight this ly
[1:00:44] Spirit we need to stand up and say I
[1:00:47] will go and
[1:00:49] fight don't stay in the back of the
[1:00:54] army don't stay in the back seat don't
[1:00:56] mean anything by
[1:00:58] that get in the front David got in the
[1:01:03] front now I thing you know David didn't
[1:01:06] say come on you guys come let's get 10
[1:01:08] of us let's go right come on give me the
[1:01:11] top 10 Generals let's go he didn't do
[1:01:14] that he didn't consider anybody else
[1:01:18] don't consider anybody this is an
[1:01:20] individual walk between you and God
[1:01:22] [Music]
[1:01:32] he said you come to me with a
[1:01:35] sword the law of the word to condemn
[1:01:41] me
[1:01:43] amen Paul said in Romans chapter 8 verse
[1:01:47] number one there is therefore now no
[1:01:49] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:01:52] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:01:54] after the spirit
[1:01:57] amen said you come to me with a spear to
[1:02:00] kill my
[1:02:02] influence that's good but the Bible says
[1:02:05] no weapon that is formed against thee
[1:02:06] shall prosper and every tongue that
[1:02:09] shall rise up against thee in judgment
[1:02:12] Thou shalt
[1:02:15] condemn you come to me with science and
[1:02:18] reasoning and Imagination and fear but I
[1:02:21] come to you in the name of the Lord of
[1:02:23] host right the name of the Lord is a
[1:02:27] strong tower and the righteous run into
[1:02:29] it and are
[1:02:30] safe 2 Corinthians chap 10 verse number
[1:02:33] three for though we walk in the flesh we
[1:02:36] do not war after the flesh for the
[1:02:40] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[1:02:43] But Mighty through God to the Ping down
[1:02:45] of strongholds the strongholds of fears
[1:02:49] in our mind that's trying to keep us
[1:02:52] what does a stronghold do it's trying to
[1:02:54] keep you in a condition
[1:02:56] to keep you in place the devil wants you

[1:03:17] God and bring it into
[1:03:20] captivity amen every thought to The
[1:03:22] Obedience of
[1:03:24] Christ what does the spirit of fear do
[1:03:27] it opens the door wide for all sorts of
[1:03:34] imaginations you just got to cast them
[1:03:36] down you can't expect your feelings to
[1:03:39] do

[1:04:54] Jonah to Revenge all Disobedience when
[1:04:57] your obedience is fulfilled that's he
[1:05:00] got to a place to he put his past behind
[1:05:03] him and he move forward in obedience he
[1:05:06] says do we look on the things after the
[1:05:09] outward appearance If any man trust to
[1:05:12] himself that he is Christ let him not uh
[1:05:15] let him of himself think this again that
[1:05:18] as he is Christ even so are we
[1:05:22] Christ amen I think that's an important
[1:05:25] scripture to remember with your brothers
[1:05:28] and sisters in
[1:05:31] Christ amen David was a great
[1:05:35] man he was a great
[1:05:37] leader he was a believer in
[1:05:40] God but he was just a man with faults
[1:05:43] and failures just like you and
[1:05:46] I he took a national census to compare
[1:05:49] how great a number of people they
[1:05:52] were he failed to discipline his
[1:05:55] children
[1:05:56] children he committed adultery and then
[1:05:59] plotted in his heart to have a man
[1:06:03] murdered he was just a
[1:06:05] man but he was a man after God's Own
[1:06:09] Heart he was just a man but he was a
[1:06:12] god-called
[1:06:13] man but his heart had deceived him
[1:06:17] Jeremiah chapter 17:9 says the heart is
[1:06:20] deceitful above all things and
[1:06:22] desperately wicked who can know it amen
[1:06:26] right but how often we feel we know
[1:06:29] it tell me the times that you thought
[1:06:32] man I don't even know my own heart I'm
[1:06:34] concerned right
[1:06:37] now that's the humble way I could be
[1:06:41] wrong where would we be today if we had
[1:06:44] not been for the Lord's Mercies in our
[1:06:46] life
[1:06:47] amen the Bible says God who is rich in
[1:06:50] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[1:06:52] loved us God is rich in Mercy
[1:06:58] Rich Lamentations chapter 3 verse 22 I
[1:07:02] love this
[1:07:03] scripture it is of the Lord's mercies
[1:07:07] that we are not
[1:07:09] consumed why because his
[1:07:12] compassions fail not they are new every
[1:07:16] morning great is thy
[1:07:19] faithfulness I'm thankful today for the
[1:07:22] mercies of God
[1:07:24] today that should be enough to make us
[1:07:26] want to go to church and praise him with
[1:07:28] everything that we got right there we
[1:07:29] don't need anything else we don't need
[1:07:31] to feel good we just need to recognize
[1:07:34] God's mercies in our
[1:07:36] Liv
[1:07:41] right David like you and I battled many
[1:07:44] problems in his
[1:07:45] life he had many many many many he had
[1:07:50] many many many many problems that's what
[1:07:52] I was going to say he had many problems
[1:07:55] many enemies he carried many burdens he
[1:07:58] had many shortcomings yet he repented
[1:08:02] many
[1:08:03] times he sought the Lord many times he
[1:08:06] cried many
[1:08:08] times the devil threw his past sins in
[1:08:11] his
[1:08:13] face but David made a choice to put his
[1:08:17] past in the
[1:08:18] past to remember not his former things
[1:08:21] neither consider the things of old
[1:08:24] Psalms 51: vers one have mercy upon me
[1:08:27] oh God according to thy loving kindness
[1:08:30] according unto the multitude of thy
[1:08:32] Tender Mercies blot out my
[1:08:37] transgressions notice there's an S
[1:08:40] there amen Wash Me thoroughly from my
[1:08:45] iniquity cleanse me from my sin for I
[1:08:49] acknowledge my transgressions and my sin
[1:08:52] is ever before
[1:08:53] me against thee and only thee have I
[1:08:57] sinned and done this evil in thy sight
[1:09:00] that thou mightest be justified when
[1:09:02] thou speakest and be clear when thou
[1:09:04] judges behold now look at this look at
[1:09:07] this he was he just said it like he was
[1:09:09] he's not just this terrible thing that I
[1:09:12] did here or these things that uh that I
[1:09:15] did last week or last month or last year
[1:09:18] he went all the way back from when he
[1:09:20] was uh uh conceived behold I was shap in
[1:09:23] iniquity in sin my mother conceive me he
[1:09:27] could recognize that his whole life was
[1:09:29] nothing without
[1:09:44] God Psalms 25:18 look upon my Affliction
[1:09:49] and my pain and forgive all my sins now
[1:09:55] I'm just showing some scriptures here
[1:09:57] that he was turning away from the former
[1:10:00] things he didn't allow his past
[1:10:04] iniquities to hold him in a place to
[1:10:07] keep him from moving forward God had
[1:10:09] called him to be a leader we are not the
[1:10:11] tail the bride is the head
[1:10:15] amen amen the mind of Christ is in the
[1:10:22] bride Psalms 121:1
[1:10:26] I will lift up my eyes unto the hills
[1:10:28] from whence cometh my help my Help
[1:10:31] Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven
[1:10:33] and Earth so when you're thinking about
[1:10:36] your
[1:10:37] situation look where your help comes
[1:10:41] from don't keep looking
[1:10:44] down look
[1:10:46] up look up David chose to put his past
[1:10:50] in the past in order to keep moving
[1:10:52] forward he said in Psalms 57:7 my heart
[1:10:56] is
[1:10:57] fixed now when your car is
[1:11:00] broke you can't
[1:11:03] move but when you fix it you can move
[1:11:08] forward David said my heart is fixed I'm
[1:11:11] moving forward amen oh God my heart is
[1:11:14] fixed I will sing and give praise that's
[1:11:17] what we can do when we're moving forward
[1:11:19] is praising the
[1:11:21] Lord and when they looked at the those
[1:11:25] uh the walls of Jericho and they were
[1:11:27] Mighty and they were tall and there were
[1:11:29] giants and oh my can you imagine them
[1:11:33] just standing still full of fear what
[1:11:35] are we going to
[1:11:37] do they moved forward with
[1:11:43] praise when you're feeling down praise
[1:11:45] the Lord it is your duty it is your
[1:11:48] responsibility we don't serve a God by
[1:11:50] feelings that's belittling the God who
[1:11:53] he is amen he's worthy of all praise
[1:11:59] amen David described how blessed he was
[1:12:02] in Romans chapter 4:7 records that
[1:12:05] blessed are they whose iniquities are
[1:12:07] forgiven and whose sins are
[1:12:11] covered blessed is the man whom the Lord
[1:12:14] will not impute
[1:12:17] sin oh how beautiful how beautiful is
[1:12:21] there someone here today that would like
[1:12:23] their sins uncovered can I see your
[1:12:28] hands let me reword that is there anyone
[1:12:32] here today that would like to display on
[1:12:34] the
[1:12:35] internet your
[1:12:40] sins so we would like to keep them
[1:12:43] covered Would we
[1:12:45] not you're blessed today because the
[1:12:50] blood of Jesus Christ covers
[1:12:53] them you're in iniquities are forgiven
[1:12:56] your transgressions are blotted out we
[1:13:00] are a blessed people because of the
[1:13:02] blood of Jesus Christ because of Calvary
[1:13:05] because of what he's done for us we are
[1:13:07] a blessed people and he's worthy to be
[1:13:10] praised for what God has done for
[1:13:13] us why do we ever get to the place where
[1:13:15] we're thinking well we're good because
[1:13:17] we're not doing this or we're not doing
[1:13:19] that or we haven't done this or we
[1:13:22] haven't done that so what I never so
[1:13:25] what I never robbed a bank I sto we've
[1:13:29] all sto we've all lied we've all come
[1:13:32] short of the glory of God in many ways
[1:13:34] if we took the time to be honest with
[1:13:41] ourselves but we're blessed
[1:13:48] today one important thing we must do is
[1:13:51] learn to forget our past
[1:13:53] sins another thing we must learn to do
[1:13:56] is forget our brother's
[1:13:58] sins his trespasses and all those that
[1:14:01] have hurt us and offended
[1:14:04] us if you keep holding some trespass
[1:14:07] over your brother and sister's head
[1:14:09] you'll never be able to move forward
[1:14:10] with
[1:14:16] God when Jesus was teaching his
[1:14:19] disciples how to pray he taught them the
[1:14:22] importance of forgiving others
[1:14:26] it's very critical in your
[1:14:30] prayer that his children can't move
[1:14:33] forward in the father's Kingdom unless
[1:14:36] they forgive
[1:14:38] others Matthew chapter 6 verse 12 I want
[1:14:42] to just read
[1:14:44] that I want to put these these four
[1:14:46] verses 12 through
[1:14:48] 15 together as a theme to help us catch
[1:14:53] the importance of forgiveness
[1:14:55] he starts out in verse 12 he says and
[1:14:58] forgive us of our debts as we forgive
[1:15:00] our debtors now I want you to notice I
[1:15:02] want you to think about today when you
[1:15:04] asked the Lord to forgive you of your
[1:15:06] sins today did you go back to the time
[1:15:09] that you prayed today this morning
[1:15:10] whenever it was and you asked God to
[1:15:13] forgive you of your sins did you even
[1:15:16] think about your brothers and sisters
[1:15:20] that have trespassed against you
[1:15:25] but look at the correlation here and
[1:15:28] forgive us our
[1:15:30] debts as we forgive our debtors in other
[1:15:34] words they come
[1:15:37] in
[1:15:39] simultaneously they come in continuity
[1:15:41] they come parallel one to
[1:15:47] another we we seek the
[1:15:50] Forgiveness of God as we must be
[1:15:53] forgiven
[1:15:55] yeah but God says look I don't want you
[1:15:59] seeking it above you being able to
[1:16:01] forgive those who trespass against
[1:16:06] you don't don't don't look at me as a
[1:16:08] one-sided
[1:16:10] God don't look at me as a a personal as
[1:16:13] a respect of persons or I I I got
[1:16:16] favorites with you and and you don't
[1:16:18] have to with
[1:16:19] [Music]
[1:16:21] others and forgive us our debts as we
[1:16:23] forgive our debtors and lead us not to
[1:16:26] Temptation This is not different it's
[1:16:27] all continuity I'll get back to it here
[1:16:29] in a second but Deliver Us from Evil for
[1:16:31] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[1:16:33] the glory
[1:16:34] forever he said
[1:16:36] amen he said amen to his own word I love
[1:16:40] that for if ye forgive men their
[1:16:43] trespasses your heavenly father will
[1:16:45] forgive will also forgive
[1:16:48] you you wants to make this real clear
[1:16:51] here but if you forgive not men the
[1:16:53] trespass neither will your father
[1:16:55] forgive your
[1:16:57] trespasses you see the continuity
[1:16:59] forgive us our debts as we forgive our
[1:17:01] our debtors
[1:17:03] yes lead us not into temptation the
[1:17:06] devil wants to leave you into an evil
[1:17:08] Temptation that you don't have to
[1:17:10] forgive
[1:17:13] somebody as if you've got
[1:17:17] power to judge
[1:17:20] them but Jesus said for thine is the
[1:17:24] power
[1:17:25] the Kingdom and The Glory the power is
[1:17:28] God to
[1:17:30] forgive to judge he is the
[1:17:34] judge it is our only responsibility to
[1:17:40] forgive I know it's a hard pill to
[1:17:42] swallow but you got to learn to forget
[1:17:44] what people do to
[1:17:50] you now I just I'm just going to say
[1:17:53] this we I've heard this a number of
[1:17:54] times times brother John I will forgive
[1:17:58] but I won't never
[1:18:00] forget and we as
[1:18:04] humans it it it it is we don't have the
[1:18:09] ability the god-given ability to put it
[1:18:12] in the sea of
[1:18:13] forgetfulness and I'll take I'll give it
[1:18:15] to you that far but the the attitude
[1:18:19] that you have that I will not ever
[1:18:23] forget
[1:18:25] you are opening the door to the devil
[1:18:29] who won't really let you forgive he
[1:18:33] don't want you to
[1:18:35] forgive you need to learn how to
[1:18:41] forget in other words when the Devil
[1:18:43] comes to your mind you remember what he
[1:18:45] did to you back 15 years
[1:18:47] ago that's really good remember what he
[1:18:50] what what she did to you last week
[1:18:52] remember what they said
[1:18:55] it's at that point you need to resist
[1:18:57] those
[1:18:59] thoughts because if not you're going to
[1:19:01] be battling some sort of tension inside
[1:19:04] of
[1:19:08] you when you forgive somebody I'm going
[1:19:10] to be honest with you when you forgive
[1:19:13] somebody the way that Jesus forgives
[1:19:16] you he does not want to remember
[1:19:20] it it's not in him to be strategically
[1:19:24] smart and to remember and to watch out
[1:19:28] for the future and make sure
[1:19:32] this that's like a worldly
[1:19:40] wisdom good think about it you could be
[1:19:44] a person with
[1:19:46] only
[1:19:48] one million
[1:19:51] 800,000 sins that you committed in your
[1:19:53] life
[1:19:57] and miss
[1:19:59] it because you would not forgive
[1:20:03] somebody who had 10
[1:20:06] million
[1:20:07] 500,000 sins in their
[1:20:11] life and if that person forgave
[1:20:14] everybody that sinned against
[1:20:16] him he could make
[1:20:19] it so it's not about what we think is
[1:20:23] worth or not worth
[1:20:26] it's learning how to forgive and
[1:20:30] forget you know the thing is think about
[1:20:32] this every time you think about what
[1:20:34] somebody's done to you the things they
[1:20:36] said the things they they cut behind
[1:20:39] your back and trying to hurt you in so
[1:20:42] many
[1:20:44] ways if you think every time you have
[1:20:46] those
[1:20:48] thoughts doesn't it make you feel
[1:20:51] hurt doesn't it make you feel like oh I
[1:20:55] just want to I
[1:20:58] wish it gets to the point where you like
[1:21:02] to just take care of it your
[1:21:05] way you understand what I'm saying but
[1:21:08] here's the blessing that you get if you
[1:21:11] learn to
[1:21:13] forget it's not in your mind you don't
[1:21:16] have to battle that anymore it's still
[1:21:18] happen yes and it may happen again
[1:21:25] but God don't want you walking in a
[1:21:27] state of of torment and in a state of uh
[1:21:30] viciousness and revenge and and
[1:21:35] hurt so just don't worry about whether
[1:21:38] you think it's right to forget or not
[1:21:40] forget you just you just need to learn
[1:21:43] to forget it practice it practice it
[1:21:47] don't only just want to forget about
[1:21:49] your sins forget about your brother's
[1:21:53] sins that's what Jesus is teaching us
[1:21:56] here well brother John you seem to be
[1:21:58] the expert
[1:22:00] here tell me how long do I have to do
[1:22:02] this for I'm so glad you asked that
[1:22:05] question turn with me if you would to
[1:22:07] Matthew 18 verse 21 how many
[1:22:11] times you know it wouldn't be strange
[1:22:14] for you to ask that question because
[1:22:16] Peter asked that
[1:22:18] question then came Peter to him and said
[1:22:21] Lord how often shall my brother sin
[1:22:25] against me not against you but against
[1:22:28] me as a person and I forgive
[1:22:31] him come on most people can't even do it
[1:22:34] once but you know you're you're Jesus
[1:22:37] and you're teaching us and the beatitude
[1:22:39] and you You' shown us the way is it
[1:22:41] seven times to make it
[1:22:45] complete it's human nature to put a
[1:22:47] limit on forgiving
[1:22:51] others but it's a God's nature
[1:22:55] to not to Bear all
[1:22:58] things to endure all things and I'll say
[1:23:02] it like this to forgive all things he
[1:23:04] stood on the cross and he said father
[1:23:07] forgive
[1:23:08] them they don't know what they're doing
[1:23:10] what do you mean they don't know what
[1:23:11] they're doing they're just saying these
[1:23:13] things they're
[1:23:14] they're they were
[1:23:16] deceived they were absolutely 100%
[1:23:21] deceived the the the I'm the he the
[1:23:24] there was two thiefs on the cross next
[1:23:26] to him one was not deceived and one was
[1:23:33] deceived now every Jesus said father
[1:23:36] forgive them they don't know what
[1:23:37] they're
[1:23:38] doing but they didn't say Lord father
[1:23:42] I'm sorry for doing this they kept doing
[1:23:45] it
[1:23:46] right so it's not the action it's how
[1:23:50] you react to what they're doing to
[1:23:53] you there there's a God reaction and
[1:23:56] then there's an ungod
[1:24:01] [Music]
[1:24:02] reaction Jesus said in verse
[1:24:05] 22 I say not unto thee
[1:24:09] until seven
[1:24:12] times but if you must know if you for
[1:24:16] your comprehension to see the end of
[1:24:20] forgiveness I say until 70 times
[1:24:32] seven you know what humanly I can't do
[1:24:38] that and I know when I'm bad on that I'm
[1:24:42] In the Flesh yes I know no matter what
[1:24:46] I'm thinking here it ain't
[1:24:49] right because the nature of God is seven
[1:24:53] * 70 now that's a lot of times to
[1:24:55] forgive
[1:24:59] somebody you might as well forget
[1:25:02] counting forget keeping tabs and you
[1:25:05] might as well just get the spirit of
[1:25:06] forgiveness on get the nature of
[1:25:10] forgiveness say God fill me with the
[1:25:12] same holy spirit that said father
[1:25:13] forgive them for they don't know what
[1:25:16] they're doing because they keep doing it
[1:25:24] we must learn to forget our past sins
[1:25:27] and we must learn to forget our
[1:25:28] brother's past
[1:25:31] sins and we must learn to forget our
[1:25:34] works and our
[1:25:37] achievements Paul was another man that
[1:25:40] was guilty of murder and many other sins
[1:25:42] by the way he was a man full of Pride he
[1:25:45] was taught by the best he had many
[1:25:47] accomplishments before he came to Christ
[1:25:49] and also
[1:25:51] after he came to Christ
[1:25:54] yet he learned to forget about his works
[1:25:57] and his
[1:25:58] achievements Philippians chapter 3:12 a
[1:26:01] very familiar scripture he says not as
[1:26:04] though I've already attained either
[1:26:06] we're already perfect but I follow after
[1:26:10] if that I may apprehend that for which
[1:26:12] also I am apprehended of Christ
[1:26:16] Jesus Brethren I count not myself to
[1:26:19] have gotten
[1:26:21] somewhere but this one thing I do
[1:26:24] I'm forgetting those things which are
[1:26:28] behind they're in the past they're
[1:26:31] behind me but I'm forgetting about
[1:26:34] it not just your past sins not just
[1:26:39] those that hurt
[1:26:41] you but all your
[1:26:43] achievements all those things that that
[1:26:46] you could look back and say Well they're
[1:26:48] real
[1:26:50] Milestones I'm keeping them back there
[1:26:52] why so I can move forward Ward I press
[1:26:56] towards the mark for the prize of the
[1:26:57] high calling in Christ
[1:27:00] Jesus now it's okay to
[1:27:03] Remember The Lion and the bear victory
[1:27:07] that you got that you slain by faith
[1:27:11] it's okay to remember that if it's going
[1:27:15] to give you faith for this hard trial
[1:27:18] that you're going to but it's never okay
[1:27:21] to look at that as some achievement that
[1:27:24] you've attained to something you've
[1:27:27] already got something under your your
[1:27:29] Bel and you don't need to press into
[1:27:30] anything
[1:27:31] harder see the
[1:27:35] difference Matthew chapter 6:3 but when
[1:27:38] thou doest alms let not thy left hand
[1:27:42] know what thy right hand
[1:27:45] doeth now friends this is not just ties
[1:27:48] and
[1:27:48] offerings but the new King James version
[1:27:51] says it like this but when you do a
[1:27:52] charitable deed do not let your left
[1:27:55] hand know what your right hand is
[1:27:59] doing if you keep what you're doing
[1:28:01] between you and God your reward is going
[1:28:04] to be greater in
[1:28:08] heaven God doesn't even want us to
[1:28:12] remember these things that we're doing
[1:28:15] for
[1:28:17] him you know he doesn't want us to go
[1:28:19] out there and let another human know
[1:28:23] about it
[1:28:26] because usually the motive of doing that
[1:28:30] is usually a motive of recognition and
[1:28:33] anything that we do for human
[1:28:36] recognition we want others to know about
[1:28:40] something Jesus said it plainly he said
[1:28:44] they have their
[1:28:47] reward it's simple we either want humans
[1:28:49] to know about it or we want to keep it
[1:28:52] between us and God that's the beauty
[1:28:56] that's why we need to learn to forget
[1:28:58] our works and our
[1:29:00] achievements forget about just keep
[1:29:03] moving
[1:29:04] forward we don't got time to stop in the
[1:29:07] parade and get you know people clapping
[1:29:10] at
[1:29:17] us it's it's a real thing it's seen all
[1:29:21] the time just people don't recognize it
[1:29:25] it's not just offerings and ties it's
[1:29:27] anything that you're doing for for God's
[1:29:34] kingdom keep it between you and the Lord
[1:29:37] I'm telling you that's the way to
[1:29:38] go think about this brother brand at the
[1:29:41] end of his serving the lord he said if
[1:29:46] I'm gonna do anything I better do it now
[1:29:50] you talk about God hid in humility
[1:29:55] here was a man that didn't feel like he
[1:29:56] did anything or did
[1:29:59] enough the way he said it if I'm going
[1:30:01] to do anything it's like what do you
[1:30:03] mean you're GNA do anything you've done
[1:30:04] all
[1:30:06] this he didn't say well if I if I need
[1:30:09] to do some if I'm going to do some more
[1:30:10] I better do now he didn't say it like
[1:30:15] that Paul said that many ministers I
[1:30:18] could just say it like this he said
[1:30:20] ministers but I say it like this many
[1:30:22] people glory after their flesh now
[1:30:24] that's what he
[1:30:25] said but when Paul spoke of his
[1:30:28] achievements he listed all the failures
[1:30:31] the punishments and sufferings that
[1:30:34] followed his
[1:30:36] ministry in other words they didn't look
[1:30:39] like
[1:30:42] achievements they they didn't look like
[1:30:44] well these are how many I baptized this
[1:30:46] is how many meetings I had this is what
[1:30:48] I did for the Lord there's nothing like
[1:30:51] that he said in 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:30:54] 11:3 if I must needs Glory I will glory
[1:30:57] of the things which concern my
[1:31:01] infirmities what does that word
[1:31:03] infirmities mean it means feebleness
[1:31:06] moral Frailty weakness here is a was
[1:31:09] another man where God was hid in
[1:31:14] humility some people take pleasure in
[1:31:17] glorying in their flesh but Paul said in
[1:31:19] 2 Corinthians chapter
[1:31:21] 12:1 he said therefore I take pleasure
[1:31:25] in infirmities in reproaches in
[1:31:27] necessities and persecutions and
[1:31:29] distress for Christ's sake for when I am
[1:31:32] weak then I'm strong he put his glory in
[1:31:37] the
[1:31:37] Lord he gloried in the cross of Calvary
[1:31:41] he kept his glory with Jesus Christ he
[1:31:45] tried to keep people from looking at him
[1:31:48] and what he had done
[1:31:56] another important thing that we need to
[1:31:57] learn to
[1:31:58] forget is our
[1:32:01] sufferings and how we
[1:32:04] feel and I'm going to try to make this
[1:32:06] as quick as I
[1:32:08] can Paul must have had a very short
[1:32:14] memory of
[1:32:18] suffering how many times was he
[1:32:21] stoned and he went right back
[1:32:29] whipped all the perils that he went
[1:32:33] through he just got out of his head had
[1:32:37] a short memory of the suffering that he
[1:32:40] went
[1:32:41] through and we need a short memory of
[1:32:44] suffering if we're going to move forward
[1:32:45] in
[1:32:46] Christ it's the
[1:32:49] past well I don't want to suffer
[1:32:52] anymore the that's what a Christian Life
[1:32:56] is it's a life of
[1:32:58] suffering your Victory isn't free from
[1:33:01] suffering your Victory is the joy and
[1:33:04] peace in the Holy Ghost that you have
[1:33:06] inside of you that's your
[1:33:08] Victory we don't want to live a life
[1:33:11] that's uh strenous or away from being
[1:33:15] hurt we just want the power to be to
[1:33:18] move forward when we do get
[1:33:20] hurt there's a difference turn with me
[1:33:23] if you were to ask chap
[1:33:24] 20 keeping this last one in mind as
[1:33:27] we're getting near to close starting
[1:33:29] with verse number 20 of Acts chapter 20
[1:33:33] and how I kept back nothing that was
[1:33:35] profitable unto you and I just want to
[1:33:37] say
[1:33:42] this you as
[1:33:51] parents there are things that you have
[1:33:53] done wrong in your
[1:33:55] life you're not proud of you're not
[1:33:58] happy
[1:34:00] of but you certainly don't want to set
[1:34:02] your kids down and start telling them
[1:34:04] all about
[1:34:07] it but it's important that what you do
[1:34:10] tell your children is profitable for
[1:34:14] them are you catching what I'm saying
[1:34:17] Paul didn't
[1:34:20] say all the negative things that he
[1:34:26] did but he didn't keep anything
[1:34:29] profitable from the
[1:34:32] people I love that showing the balance
[1:34:35] here and how I kept back nothing that
[1:34:38] was profitable unto you but have showed
[1:34:40] you and have taught you publicly and
[1:34:42] from house to house testifying both to
[1:34:45] the Jews and also the Greeks repentance
[1:34:47] towards God in faith toward our Lord
[1:34:49] Jesus Christ and now behold I go Bound
[1:34:52] in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing
[1:34:55] the things that shall befall me there
[1:34:56] save that the holy spirit is is saying
[1:34:59] everywhere I go that bonds and
[1:35:01] afflictions abide
[1:35:03] me but none of these things moveed me he
[1:35:06] had a short memory of
[1:35:09] sufferings he wasn't moved neither count
[1:35:12] I my life dear unto
[1:35:15] myself so that I may finish my course
[1:35:18] with joy and the ministry amen we all
[1:35:22] got a Ministry sitting here today
[1:35:24] it's we need to recognize it if we don't
[1:35:26] feel it if we don't see it we need to
[1:35:29] come to grips God has given you Ministry
[1:35:32] not this church not your pastor but God
[1:35:34] has given you a Ministry
[1:35:39] amen which I have received of the Lord
[1:35:41] Jesus to
[1:35:43] testify of the Gospel of the grace of
[1:35:47] God and now behold all right all right
[1:35:50] now so here it is I just want to stop
[1:35:53] there and I want to I want to go to uh
[1:35:55] Acts chapter 21 and let's just start
[1:35:58] here with verse number 11 just a few
[1:36:00] verses showing that he did he had a very
[1:36:05] short memory of sufferings because he
[1:36:07] just kept moving forward he didn't count
[1:36:10] his life so dear that he wasn't willing
[1:36:12] to suffer and he didn't let things move
[1:36:14] him he didn't let his sufferings and his
[1:36:16] persecutions and being knifed in the
[1:36:19] back and things said about him and
[1:36:21] whatever it might be it didn't keep from
[1:36:23] moving forward in the things of God and
[1:36:27] when he was come uh unto us he took
[1:36:31] Paul's girdle this Prophet now and he
[1:36:34] bound it with his own hands and feet and
[1:36:36] said thus sayith the Holy Ghost now it
[1:36:37] wasn't the prophet was saying it was God
[1:36:40] that was saying it so shall the Jews of
[1:36:42] at Jerusalem bind the man that onth this
[1:36:45] Giro and shall deliver him to the hands
[1:36:46] of the Gentiles now if God told you
[1:36:49] you're going to suffer wouldn't it give
[1:36:52] you like a holy ghost
[1:36:55] boldness well God has told every one of
[1:36:59] you they that live Godly in Christ Jesus
[1:37:02] shall suffer
[1:37:04] persecution so go boldly and me live the
[1:37:08] life of a
[1:37:10] Christian stand
[1:37:13] up whatever he's told you to do Act
[1:37:16] Right dress right talk right live right
[1:37:19] amen it doesn't matter the persecutions
[1:37:21] that will follow you
[1:37:24] it's the Holy Ghost has told you well
[1:37:27] brother John I don't feel like God's
[1:37:28] told
[1:37:29] me well you need to come to church
[1:37:32] listening to God because I'm telling you
[1:37:34] I can't help
[1:37:37] you I'm might about to get you to feel
[1:37:39] better I might be able to help with some
[1:37:41] natural thing in your life but I'm
[1:37:43] telling you I can't do what God could do
[1:37:45] for you that's let God speak to you
[1:37:52] today verse 12 and when he had heard
[1:37:54] these things both we and they of that
[1:37:57] place besought him not to go to a place
[1:38:01] that you're going to get
[1:38:02] persecuted and Paul answered what meth
[1:38:07] ye to
[1:38:09] cry and to actually break my
[1:38:12] heart my heart you're telling me not to
[1:38:16] do what I want to do for
[1:38:20] Jesus says for I am ready not to be
[1:38:23] bound only but also to die at Jerusalem
[1:38:27] for the name of the Lord Jesus what in
[1:38:30] honor to stand in the face of adversity
[1:38:35] and say I'm a Christian I love Jesus
[1:38:37] Christ I it may hurt you may offend you
[1:38:40] it may make you want to disown me but I
[1:38:43] love Jesus and I want you to love Jesus
[1:38:47] he never went out there with a sword and
[1:38:49] said come
[1:38:50] on he was pleading that they would love
[1:38:52] the Lord that they would give their
[1:38:54] heart to
[1:38:55] Christ Christ was in Paul he had a short
[1:38:59] memory for
[1:39:02] sufferings Peter the first P persecution
[1:39:05] That Came Upon Peter and the apostles
[1:39:07] and they were thrown in
[1:39:09] prison for for preaching the
[1:39:14] truth the answer from Heaven came go and
[1:39:19] stand in the temple and tell them of all
[1:39:23] all the words of this
[1:39:28] life the only way to be a true witness
[1:39:31] for Jesus is get serious about getting
[1:39:33] the Holy
[1:39:36] Ghost if you're you're going to try to
[1:39:38] make it without seeking the Holy Ghost
[1:39:42] you're not going to make
[1:39:45] it you've got to seek the Holy Ghost
[1:39:47] because it's that Holy Ghost that causes
[1:39:51] you to go right back
[1:39:54] love forgive be the example of a
[1:39:57] Christian before others no matter what
[1:39:59] persecution comes God has called us to
[1:40:02] be in His image not what we image we
[1:40:05] want to be
[1:40:06] in in His image Romans chapter 8 ver1 18
[1:40:10] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:40:12] present time are not worthy to be
[1:40:14] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:40:17] revealed in us the first step to move
[1:40:21] forward in your life is to forgive your
[1:40:24] past your sins your brother's sins your
[1:40:28] great victories and whatever sufferings
[1:40:31] you have to go through just put it
[1:40:33] behind you remember ye not the former
[1:40:36] things neither consider the things of
[1:40:41] old
[1:40:43] let not only 2020 be
[1:40:47] done but take this message for your life
[1:40:51] and let your past be the past
[1:40:53] no matter what's happened about matter
[1:40:56] what anybody's done I don't care what
[1:40:58] you've done I don't care what you
[1:41:00] haven't done put it behind you and move
[1:41:03] forward move forward we've got to put
[1:41:06] our past behind
[1:41:08] us it's G to just get in the way of the
[1:41:13] Rapture I'll tell you in Rapture morning
[1:41:15] is anything going to matter what anybody
[1:41:17] said about
[1:41:21] you but the spirit of Christ inside you
[1:41:24] doesn't want does not want
[1:41:29] you to see them miss
[1:41:33] it so this is the hour to forgive this
[1:41:37] is the hour to move forward this is the
[1:41:39] hour to let the past be the past in
[1:41:42] every situation of your life one
[1:41:43] scripture we can stand together
[1:41:45] Revelations chapter 21 verse number
[1:41:49] four and God shall wipe away all tears
[1:41:54] from their eyes and there shall be no
[1:41:57] more death neither sorrow nor crying
[1:42:01] neither shall there be any more pain for
[1:42:04] the former things are passed
[1:42:09] away we might also start learning today
[1:42:12] how to put the former things behind us
[1:42:16] just
[1:42:16] develop that ability just to quickly
[1:42:19] forgive and move forward amen let's
[1:42:22] Stand Together
[1:42:38] We There is a a part of us
[1:42:42] that would like America to move forward
[1:42:46] the
[1:42:47] cony and things to be more hopeful and
[1:42:51] better
[1:42:55] we all want
[1:42:57] that but we're not resting in our
[1:43:02] Christianity for
[1:43:06] that in fact um the more that we
[1:43:10] recognize things going down the tubes
[1:43:13] the more serious we're becoming with our
[1:43:15] walk with the Lord I believe that's a
[1:43:17] true true
[1:43:21] statement and
[1:43:23] though the the world is is honestly it's
[1:43:26] like going over Niger
[1:43:28] Falls and it's
[1:43:32] heading into tribulation it's falling
[1:43:34] into
[1:43:37] tribulation but it doesn't affect the
[1:43:42] bride it's affecting lukewarm church
[1:43:47] members make Believers halfway it's
[1:43:50] affecting but the bride
[1:43:54] she gets her instructions from from
[1:43:57] God and I believe that the Lord has has
[1:44:00] instructed us today with a word of
[1:44:02] encouragement to put the past behind
[1:44:06] you he knows that you're going to make a
[1:44:09] mistake tomorrow he knows you're going
[1:44:11] to get upset he knows you're going to
[1:44:14] blunder and at that moment he's going to
[1:44:17] want you to put the past behind
[1:44:20] you not hold it over your head
[1:44:23] he wants us to forget the former things
[1:44:26] and move forward we have something
[1:44:28] better than a great
[1:44:33] nation we're A peculiar
[1:44:37] people uh we're from a different Nation
[1:44:40] we're a different
[1:44:43] nation and it's it's up to us to to take
[1:44:47] what God has given us and move forward
[1:44:51] amen let's if we could just bow our
[1:44:53] heads a moment and we're going to pray
[1:44:55] before we sing a couple
[1:44:59] songs maybe there would be someone here
[1:45:09] today I'm sure we all want to move
[1:45:12] forward I'm sure of
[1:45:15] that praise the
[1:45:19] Lord but maybe there's someone here
[1:45:21] today that's
[1:45:24] is
[1:45:27] struggling and
[1:45:29] they they're just requesting prayer that
[1:45:32] God would shine a a little more
[1:45:37] grace into their heart that they could
[1:45:40] put the past in the past to move forward
[1:45:44] God sees your hands God sees God sees
[1:45:47] Humanity standing here looking and
[1:45:50] pointing up to deity amen
[1:45:53] it's
[1:45:55] beautiful God is touched by the feelings
[1:45:57] of our
[1:45:59] infirmities I believe that God's grace
[1:46:02] is sufficient
[1:46:04] today that's all we need
[1:46:08] and let's believe that wonderful course
[1:46:13] that brother Ron sung at the beginning
[1:46:16] of the ministry of this word the very
[1:46:20] message that came from an angel show
[1:46:24] that said that I like that song that's
[1:46:27] the song that I
[1:46:30] like Let It Be the theme behind our
[1:46:33] prayer as we go to him and let's just
[1:46:36] unite I don't want us all to pray
[1:46:40] together for this grace to come Heavenly
[1:46:43] Father we just unite in prayer at this
