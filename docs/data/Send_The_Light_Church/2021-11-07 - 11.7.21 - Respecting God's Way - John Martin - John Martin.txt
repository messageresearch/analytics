this morning in the name of jesus um turn with me if you would to the book of first corinthians chapter 14 we're just going to read three verses that will be seated can is my mic okay i just just want to make sure this light is on not sure if it's all working and everything but i just want to this is the first time you ever text before and said i'm hooked up i'm ready and god bless you brother gideon thank you for watching and i i had asked if he hasn't responded if there's a way that we can uh hear from him so it would be so heavenly father we want to thank you for your goodness to us today lord i want to thank you for the keep and power of the holy spirit lord we want to thank you that the day that you saved us we felt like we were in heavenly places lord from that time that you called us you set us free from our sins it's been a a rough road for each one of us a lot of ups and downs a lot of training the school of hard knocks as it were lord you're bringing us into the character of yourself that's not easy but we want to thank you today for keeping us through it lord when we want to at times give up or just sit by in the in the back seat and as it were and not not press in lord you still had mercy on us you still want to see us through or from the depths of our heart we say thank you this morning pray that your presence would come and just direct your thoughts in this service today and that you'd help us to know lord what your will is for our lives we pray bless the reading of of the word and lord the the quotes and the things that would be spoken may you inspire each and every one of them to our hearts that we might hear from heaven today commit the service with all of our needs may there be a faith rise in our heart no matter what the need would be in our lives lord that faith would rise that we could claim the promises of god today we've committed all to you give you the praise now for we ask it in jesus precious name amen amen first corinthians chapter 14 starting with verse number 32 verse 32 and 33 read like this and the spirit of the prophets are subject to the prophets for god is not the author of confusion amen but a peace as in all churches of the saints and then verse 40. let all things be done decently and in order god bless you may be seated um i'm going to follow brother mark and ask you a question before i start how many has seen our church grow in unity the last six to nine months keep your keep your hands up if you would have felt the love of god growing in our church has felt a good spirit in our church okay praise the lord god has certainly blessed us psalms 133 verse 1 says behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity now look how he compares the unity of brotherhood in verse two and three it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down the beard even aaron's beard and went down into the skirts of his garments so the unity of his whole body was just there saturated with this ointment precious ointment amen unity is precious and then he says the same in verse 3 this unity is as the dew of hermann as the dew that descended upon the mountains of zion for there the lord commanded the blessings even life forevermore it's it's from the unity in which god commands his blessings think about it how many times have we heard brother brandon talk about if he could just get everybody in one mind one accord there one be one feeble one among us now if you could just get my revelation if you just recognize i'm the prophet if you could no just get in the unity remember when god spoke to our church he said there shouldn't be any isms and schisms that we should pray for one another love one another and he wanted us to be united in him and he said if we would do this that we would see things that we've never seen before [Music] god has certainly blessed us but brother branham said satan won't allow it to stay that way now i want you to understand what we're up against we're not up against one another we're up against a devil who will not allow us to stay unified in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed brother brahm says love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say he says now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything in other words he's not going to stop he's he's going to do his job until he's put in hell come on god wants us to better handle the devil here he wants us to know where to to put him under our feet wants us to have the character that we need to kick him out he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff i don't know but and he'll start through the church with it he says don't you take sides with it don't you have anything to do with anything else you stay right loving sweet kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved to or that woman or whoever who it is he says just pray for them and stick one with another amen and stay with your pastor see he's a shepherd you give him respects he'll lead you through because he's ordained to do so he's ordained of god to do so now do you remember that congregation says amen the enemy will come and when he does just clean that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you showing the importance of sticking together he says don't never plan or talk or make yourself clannish he said we are one i couldn't say left hand i'm mad at you i'm gonna take you away because you're not a right hand he's my left hand and i want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger i want to stay right there every little part of my buddy's body stay right there and god wants us as a body of believers to stay right exactly with one another right with one another wow this is a responsibility that means i have to try the bible says endeavor to keep the unity of the spirit you know most people have the attitude well if you don't agree with me that's fine i'm still going to stay where i'm at not caring about unity there's no care about unity well how can we be of god and not care about unity amen that's right amen amen it'd be different if we're talking to some person who's anti-god right understand but we're believers and you know we don't we're not all going to agree with the same thing we don't eat the same food we don't drive the same cars we don't wear the same clothes we don't desire the same foods we're different people but we should all be unified in christ no matter what he says now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you've got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave ourselves in the church how we got to come here together and sit down in heavenly places he says don't stay at home if god is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to get open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers now if you don't feel that way then i tell you it's time you got to praying in other words we we always must have that and if we're not feeling that then we just got to spend more time with god amen now for this morning's message i want to for a subject i want to talk about maintaining respect through spiritual growth we are a young church in one sense because we've got new believers and and i'll be honest with you we're always growing amen and everything that god's trying to show you show us is new to us even though we've been in the message a while so we need to maintain respect through spiritual growth and i want to entitle this message respecting god's way through unity respecting god's way of unity oftentimes god is misunderstood he has been misunderstood brother branham said he was misunderstood we can be misunderstood as well sometimes things happen in our church that are misunderstood and they don't seem right to us sometimes things are handled in a particular way that maybe would seem odd wouldn't seem right it would be no different in our homes it's happened in our homes in our businesses sometimes you can't make it through the drive-thru without them getting your order right because of some misunderstanding i don't know how many times i've said something i've had somebody on the phone they've heard me and they come back and they say something just completely different and the person on the fold heard me the correct way so our minds could be in other places this is why when we come to church we need to be prepared we need to be in the spirit i thought it would be important for our church to know a little bit more about me perhaps a better understanding of why i might do the things that i do and say the things that i say i want the church to know what's behind my decisions why i do what i do i'll say this i'm always looking for the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace whatever is happening in this church you have to put a priority somewhere so i'm watching a person's spirit much more than i'm listening to their words it's not that i disrespect what you're saying i'm just just the way i've been built amen right i pay attention to people's spirits first thessalonians chapter 5 verse 12 says and we beseech you brethren to know them which labor among you and they're over you in the lord and admonish you so i want it's important for you to know me now i'll be honest with you i don't want to know one of your sins ever ever your fault your i don't we have a blood amen for that situation and i'm not eager to tell you all of mine i'm just like you but i will say this i got just as many as you can but i want you to know me i want to know you we're god is growing our church people are going to come in and we need to know how we ought to be in church in the body that word admonish means to put in mind that is to caution to warn to reprove gently so i looked at that word reprove that word reprove means to disapprove of strongly to criticize correct especially gently so know them that labor among you are over you that they they have a job that really isn't pleasant first we're to know them and then verse 13 and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake and be at peace among yourselves they have a job to do it's hard to esteem anyone who corrects you or disapproves of you strongly but if you know that they're committed to building your character and watching over your soul then it's much easier to esteem them much highly for the for the lord's work amen and he ends it be at peace among yourselves be at peace it's hard to be at peace with somebody if you're not in peace and with yourself right it's hard to be a peacemaker if that peace is not so strong inside of you i don't want to sing peace like a river i want peace like a river because then i can be a peacemaker now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feeble minded support the weak be patient towards man this is a lot of stuff to do and see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men amen now the scriptures declare that the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets major prophets are a mouthpiece of god we're taught that minor prophets are also a mouthpiece of god god has chosen the foolishness of preaching to save men so preachers are a mouthpiece of god god will also use the mouth of somebody's testimony revelations chapter 19 verse 10 says and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not right from other fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy so god can use the mouth of someone's testimony of jesus even to be a spirit of prophecy we also understand that god uses some to speak with tongues so god has um a variety of ways to speak amen we just can't put god in a box he has a body ministry god can even have more than one mouthpiece on the scene at a time more than one prophet we see this during elijah and elisha now the thing is god is not going to have more than one prophet on the scene with the message for the people at the same time because that would cause confusion but trying to get to a point here god can have more than one preacher among us it's true amen he can have more than one testimony being given he can have more than one person speaking in tongues but if god has more than one among us if god is truly in control of each one being used all things will be done decently and in order and there will be no confusion amen the holy ghost inside of us as long as he's in control there will be harmony god will work in harmony we know that god has an order and he has ordained and called a fivefold ministry for our perfection for our benefit but we also know that satan has ministers that appear as ministers of light the bible says amen but their job is simply to keep us from perfection not so strong that they just gonna take us off the deep end just to keep us from pressing in keep us from uh to the complete image of jesus christ the complete character to keep us from perfection that's their job they they have other agendas and to achieve those agendas that they have satan works through confusion brother branham we've heard that you know brother brandon said that there's there's a lot of mape believers right right but did you ever hear brother branham say we've got a lot of make-believe preachers and a lot of make-believe prophets he said it the rising raising jerry is his daughter wow this is strong and and very very like i need to be careful i don't believe god's fivefold ministry that's ordained to bring a bride to perfection is going to bring confusion to her just don't think that right god is not the author of confusion somehow that five-fold ministry is going to work in harmony if it's you to the lord amen god knows what he's doing amen man only thinks he knows what he's doing but god knows god has placed pastors in the church more than just for preaching that's true amen that's good they're actually play a uh acute role a crucial role and that role is to take us through amen the brahm didn't say that of any of the other four offices but the officer the office of a pastor isn't good enough alone that's why we got a five-fold ministry brother brandon says rapturing faith lies in the tapes so we're not going to make a rapture just staying out of the tapes right that's good staying with the other four-fold see everyone has their place pastors they actually are the burden bearers of the church they carry things that most sheep are not even aware of they see things that most sheep do not see they are shepherds of their flock of sheep they pay close attention to what the sheep are feeding on just take a regular shepherd that's right if a shepherd cares about that sheep he's he's interested that they're not eating a bunch of weeds or grass with the weeds brother branham said in the message what it takes to overcome all unbelief he said so each of you who has a godly pastor has a gift from god in your church a shepherd pastor it means a shepherd to watch over the flock to teach them the word of god so you see that the pastor has a different role than just preaching you know some people who don't understand that they they they just look at it as a as a as a pastor who who he just he's just a preacher of the church and and some uh some of those you know they just they just want your money not truly understanding the role of the pastor yes it's to teach the word of god but they also have to watch over the flock first peter chapter 5 verse 1 reads the elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not by filthy looker but of a ready mine a pastor should never ever be forced to be a pastor he should do it willingly amen god loveth a cheerful giver because the pastor is truly if you ever remember brother i'm talking about what a pastor is typed to is a lily pastor lily and people just come and take from them all different the birds the bees they just they come and take a pastor's job is is a total giving job he's got to do it willingly not for money right that's right it's true should not be i i thank god that i can stand here today by the grace of god that i've never taken a penny from any of you or from anyone i'm grateful that god has provided me a job amen and you've heard me before i'm grateful for my son who's helping me i'll just pray that god would raise him up not only to handle trust you too well but to handle the things that god has for him so not for filthy luker but of a ready mind neither as being lords that's really good control freaks over god's heritage so here we're supposed to take the oversight with the right attitude willingly for the right reasons a ready mind to control things but not as a lord amen wow you know what it's going to take the holy ghost you're going to have to be a man of patience lots of patience because you just can't go up to somebody and say no the way that you do it is an example where's our where's our scriptures they're not working are they this is how you do it you're an example just like jesus was amen he went down there and washed the feet and amen he's the one that lay down his life for his brethren that's the truth the example is important now the example that we set is not an example where we're like perfect in everything that we do right but the example on how we handle things when we haven't done the perfect right yeah that's right that's good it's good because no man can stand behind the dust and say i'm so perfect we'll call my example and when the chief shepherd shall appear we shall receive a crown of glory that faith out of the way likewise you younger submit yourselves to the elders see respecting god's way of unity yeah all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth right now did you know you could be proud and be sitting in church that's true so this is not just unbelievers this is not the world god's talking about a spirit that can get on anybody at any time for any reason and no matter how much we're a son of god if that spirit is on us god is resisting us yes for god resisted the problem by giving grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time how many wants to be exalted in christ the answer is through humility amen that's right that's right get so low that god says there's someone i can use that's what he had to do with moses that's what he had to do with saul that's what he had to do with jonah and that's what god has to do with us the pastor is the shepherd of the flock of sheep they shepherd the responsibility of the flock and that responsibility is to lead the flock towards the character of christ it's it's much deeper than what we think right because sometimes we come to truth well i just want to see what's being preached if it's you know what i've been praying about see if it's like you're just going to help me get what i'm looking for and you know we got our own theme going on i'm not against it but what i'm trying to say it's much greater it's a much greater situation than that god is not interested in how well trusted tools doing right right that's the truth he's interested in how good my character is doing so there's got to be a priority is that that god don't care about trust you how could i ever think those thoughts he was the one that put it there right yeah sure he's interested in it but he's not interested in it above what he's really looking for right right it's to see his character in us not what we know but what we're living amen as i said i don't care about anyone's fault sins mistakes failures but i'm concerned as a pastor is how much we're moving in the direction of god's character that's what i'm looking at when i'm looking at everyone's spirit if that isn't your bullseye for your life things are just going to seem out of place to you amen amen come on amen please catch that amen ultimately the responsibility of the church falls back on the pastor right it's true now if you can imagine being in a church where there was an order and everyone did what they thought they wanted to do then you can imagine what it would be like to be in church without a pastor a lot of confusion a lot of chaos now we're all god sheep of his heritage amen but in god's great pasture remember this there's no confusion there's order god will not offer any confusion but he will offer peace as in all churches of the saints sometimes we get so strong and trying to bring our opinion and and bring what we want to do and we we think we're so right that we're not thinking about what we're causing jonathan knows this i've in at work we we teach that we don't want to try to correct problems with while creating new ones it's not the way god does it right can you imagine being a surgeon and we're going to take out this little bit of cancer and as we're get taking out this little bit of cancer that's wrapped around these organs and we cut through this and oops i got the cancer out but yeah the man is gonna die now because of what you did just other organs in order for things to remain in a right state in any church god raises up shepherds who will take the oversight thereof they look diligently into the flock into what's happening in a spiritual realm they're not just responsible for the preaching but to make sure that there isn't confusion entering the door confusion is a sure sign that god is missing just look at every time there's been confusion between you and your wife you and your children you and some relative right you and your neighbor you never feel good about it something is missing right man it's true of course pride says it's them i said it clearly i don't know what's wrong with them no concern for the unity only concerned about getting your point across i know a very respected pastor in this message we might say he's one of the top i believe it well known and respected by most when he has a visiting minister to speak at his church if he leaves that church with questions among the body he simply doesn't have them come back again think about that statement it isn't that he doesn't believe he's called right doesn't believe he's not gifted right it just means that he's not yielding his gift or himself completely to the lord because god is not going to alter confusion in any church it's something that we ought to be concerned about when we're trying to help somebody it's not about the point that you're bringing god god's true ministry won't alter confusion the spirit of the prophets are subject to the prophets you're subject one to another amen the shepherd watches over the flak they're responsible for the overall decisions they're seeing things in like i said a more acute way because they're watching for things in a spiritual realm amen and that's what that pastor did he was watching what was happening in a spiritual realm he knows this just doesn't work when this stuff happens it's not good for the church it's not healthy for the church when there's confusion among the body right it's true so let's put an end to it here's how we put it into it we just stop it right it's good because from one pastor to another evangelist or a teacher you don't sit there and try to prove he's wrong you knock on the door and you try to share but you know what if i know i was going to be preaching somewhere i'm sure when brother mark stood up here and he was preaching he he spent some time with the lord wanting to make sure that everything was going to be exactly the way that it needed to be and a preacher is not interested in the flock in the unity of the flock let me say this correctly in the unity of the flock you're not respecting the pulpit there are things that are going to be happening in the church but a good shepherd watches the spirit of the things that are happening first john chapter 4 verse 1 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone until the same thing the prophet said try the spirit well the spirit of god is not going to bring confusion in fact it's going to separate the confusion it's going to dissolve god is a dissolver of doubts not one that in in authors them come on i don't care what you know what how much you think you're right if it's not the right spirit i can't say it's of god amen no i'm not saying that where the bible's just trying the spirit it's the same trying the spirits don't try the person that's the right he's not the person it's not the person it's the spirit on the person at any time we can be in the spirit we can be in the flesh hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus has come in the flesh is not of god and this is the spirit of antichrist wherever you've heard that it should come and now already is in the world i'll say it like this jesus in our flesh is not going to author confusion amen amen so if you see something's not happening in a relationship in church i'm telling you need to step back and look at is jesus really having his way in your flesh this order that the bible teaches and the prophet also taught it about speaking in tongues it's for each and every one of us and as soon as we set foot in the church we have a personal responsibility to keep order the pastor is just watching it all right but can you imagine if you all came in here with your own you know what i'm going to start doing things here my way can you imagine what would happen in the church there wouldn't be any the unity would go off the tubes there'd be lots of isms and schisms before you know it it would just be a total mess would it not but the spirit of the prophets the subject thrives we need to be subject one to another we need to respect one another amen we're all sheep of god's great pastor there's no big eyes there's no little use i also want to say this there is no respecter of persons of personalities or gifts we are all one in christ but to keep there from being confusion we must respect god's way of unity amen now even though all the martin clan is one family our children were duty-bound to obey their mother and their mother is still duty-bound to over her husband they are all duty-bound to keep order and yet they're all one family see god is not going to alter confusion i'm sure we've all experienced our children when they wanted their way bad enough if they didn't get what they want from daddy they go to mama and what does it do causes confusion amen same thing in the church can't get what i want from the pastor yeah right i'll go to the missus what does it do it can cause confusion the best thing is you got a problem with daddy spend time with daddy when daddy talk to daddy well god i wish our church had this pray about it maybe god will give it to us amen he does everything beautiful in his time sometimes we try to take carnal control of situations it's no different in a church than a family no different on a job we've all had job experiences that were very confusing more than one person telling you what to do not sure who you should be listening to what should be done first but a well-managed company has a good structure in place to keep all the confusion out they have good headship all that implies employees know who their boss is they know where they get their instructions from same as in a courtroom when court is in session no matter how much somebody wants to talk if they get out of order the judge will hit his hammer he'll say order in the court if you keep that up i'll throw you out for contempt amen because order is necessary contempt of court is essentially seen as a form of disturbance that may impede the functioning of the court right we don't want a form of disturbance in our church that may impede the functioning of god's court right amen that's right that's the truth now everyone that's ever been in the court and he got out of order and he wanted to talk did you know he thought he was right think about it just because we feel we're right god does everything decently and in order amen now it's no different with a spiritual church god is the head of the church and the sheep respect god's headship amen god's way of unity now in the carnal church while that's different in a carnal church there's fussing there's fighting there's arguing isms schisms backbiting talking behind people how many knows of this how many's heard of this there's divisions there's contentions in a carnal church paul said in first corinthians 1 12 he says that every one of you saith i'm a paul i'm apollos i am of cephas i am of christ yes i like this preacher yeah i like that preacher i like the way he says it i like the way he views it paul asked the question real easy is christ divided right no right is christ divided he's talking about unity right is he divided who cares what you're off i only care what your spirit is i'm listening to the spirit of things much more than i'm listening to words when we talk like that we're trying to bring our carnal order to god's church right just like being out being in court what about this you know he's lying what are you on sit down that's really good bringing a carnal order sure we got all opinions somewhere down the law road a spiritual church trust god amen amen when someone gets the wrong spirit on them it will always cause some sort of confusion i always remember brother johnson said you go one day without praying the wife knows about it she's the closest to you kids don't know yet till the second day second day you go without the lord the kids know that you haven't been praying amen dogs still don't know that that third day i'm telling you you'll get so mad and angry and rude you'll kick the dog we're not a carnal church eventually a wrong spirit will cause wrong things in the church may not happen right away but it will but we're not a carnal church with a carnal order we don't walk as men we are a spiritual church with spiritual order and it is our personal responsibility to learn how to walk in the spirit be subject to the word of god now look what happened to the children of israel when they were liberated from the egyptian world you would think they would have been so grateful they would have just done anything jesus asked jesus was even following them he was leading them and follow him and protecting them and and giving them serious diary shoes providing food just did everything but you know what they had the hardest time following god's leadership they didn't respect god's leadership through moses they murmured they complained and they wanted different leadership and if they didn't get it they were even thinking about leaving amen so even though we're all god's sheep and his pastor god has set in order for his sheep and the scriptures teach us that paul set the same order in all the churches yes amen think about it we got to have the same order that paul said not a new age order not a modern order god's order he's the same yesterday today and forever he brought order in respect to god's house brother brown didn't only say that every believer ought to have a home church he talked about the love and attitude they should have when they about their church he says their love their attitude it should be in such a way that they can't wait till the doors are open that's a loving attitude thing amen he taught us our true purpose when we get to church is to find out where we're standing with the great shepherd because all through the week i know that i'm right i know i'm doing the right thing god is with me oh yeah every decision i make right couldn't be wrong no need to work it out with fear and trembling so we humble ourselves in church and find out where we're really at with god amen amen a believer wants to know that he's in order with his shepherd the humble want to make sure but the proud they already know when to get the church and god resists that spirit that's why a lot of times we can come to church we feel we don't get anything out of it it ain't because of the preacher i know my god can feed us through anything because god is much greater than the preacher but god is going to bless you with the wrong spirit he's not going to reward you with something out of order up here and down here that's right i'm sorry he's not right it's true it's up to you to humble yourself be subject lord i need you i promise when i leave here i walk with you amen god is an order of things brother man said in the message trying to do god's service without being his will he said now you pastors should never tell a prophet what to do that's why any man that would say the prophet was wrong in this that's what i feel about that are you evangelists tell a pastor see each one has his office if it's perfectly identified god is not going to offer confusion that's what the prophet is telling us here an evangelist who has been here many times he's well respected and i respect him had told me of a situation that he had he was asked to come to a a certain church and preach for them and feeling led to go he said he would come and he got there early and the pastor wanted to uh have to see him before service they had little food and coffee or whatever it was and the pastor said to this evangelist now he said now i don't want you uh preaching about uh two souls and the return ministry in the tent and a number of what i call false doctrines think about that can you imagine the pickle he was in now i know some preachers would have said i'll preach whatever god tells me to preach all right or if i can't have liberty to preach what i want i'm not going to preach out of love i've seen it many times i've i've seen it in our men's meeting brother brandon said respect another man's pulpit [Music] it's not about what you want to say what you want to testify what you want it's not about that god is not going to alter confusion some preachers don't exercise the spirit of respect and i'll tell you there's times that we need to learn to exercise among one another the spirit of respect so much more than the spirit of i'm right but this evangelist he did preach the gospel from that pulpit and never ever preached against the false doctrines right right he respected that man's pulpit yes he preached the word of god amen he became so respected that they asked him to come back and back and back and you know what he did a lot of good all through the respect of unity not a spirit i'm gonna prove that they're wrong and i'm gonna say it like this and if there's one scene in there they'll come out i don't care about the rest of them sometimes we get so caught up in thinking that we're the shepherd god is the shepherd that's right god is not going to offer more confusion by trying to unconfuse somebody that's true amen that's right well i'm going to straighten them out and bring more confusion let all things be done decently and in order always always always respect another man's pulpit and respect the church respect one another's testimony respect one another song respect one another in the men's meaning respect respect respect you can never go wrong respecting amen well i felt real strong in my spirit it just it's everybody wants to be that prophet that comes out of the wilderness eating locusts and wild honey and lay the axe to the tree if you're a prophet okay if you're a prophet okay but if you're not get an order stay in order keep in order not just today a month a year two years five years ten years from now when i'm dead and gone i hope that this church remains in order because that's what god wants think about when god first saved you i remember when he first saved me he talked about the most important thing with me and that was the sin of my nature i knew that if i was to die without him i'd go directly to hell right now when he saved me and he cleansed me of all my sin and my my my past was literally erased erased he can't even remember i remember because god tell satan tells me about it right but he can't remember it's erased from him at that moment if i died i would be saved as soon as i step into the next day i've got more sins more backslide that's the word and god he sees me i know the thoughts i think towards you saith the lord to give you an expected end i want to be in his image yes but he doesn't come to us the first day and just no he takes us one step at a time he knows what he's doing to get us in order he knows when we get saved we're not perfectly in order with our character he's still working on me [Music] to make me what i ought to be yes i'm safe but he's still working on me why we need to press towards the mark so when things aren't right in the church and you see somebody that's out of order something just isn't right you know hold your horses let it be done decently in order show the church you've got character don't no preaching without respecting another man's pulpit is not liberty in the holy ghost right that's what most people would consider it liberty without respect is the same thing as power without character it's satanic and i'll say it again liberty without respect to satanic i've never heard another man say it but i believe with all my heart amen god is not going to offer more confusion by us trying to unhave liberty to unconfuse somebody and bring more confusion now if i would go to say something that would be contrary to the scriptures from this pulpit like it's okay for a sister to stand behind the pulpit and preach the word of god let's say i would go to say that right it would bring confusion for us to handle it in just any way we want how should we correctly handle the situation should someone stand up in the church and just call it out and say that's wrong pastor should the long should the song leader stand up the next service and say brother john what's wrong for what he said should somebody just stand up after service raise their hand and just say you know i think you i just want to say a little testimony but god pressed it on my heart i feel real grave night i feel brother john was wrong come on this is an important question i don't believe that's the right way to handle something it would bring more confusion to the situation the correct way would be to go to the pastor show him in the scriptures and in the message where he is wrong alone now it would be good it would be good if he can't if he doesn't receive that then it'd be good to take another brother with you see what you're trying to do is correct the problem without offering more confusion i'm going to tell you why most people offer more confusion because they're more interested in getting pumped up to prove that somebody was wrong than they ever are about trying to help somebody the spirit is wrong right you you know you can have mixed motives in everything that you do yeah that's i'm gonna work for god but i'm gonna work for me i'm gonna preach for god but i'm gonna preach for me i'm gonna help somebody and help my reputation at the same time when you go to the pastor alone and you talk to him directly see true love covers can you imagine if if whoever beside me just some preacher some preacher up here a different pastor would stand up here and he would just talk about all well just me let's sorry if i'm going to tell everybody about your faults how is that going to make you feel that's just not the way god does things god handles things in an order and he that covereth a multitude of sin let him know that he'll he'll save amen that love that covers it it saves humility we're supposed to be building respect with one another and we don't care about somebody's faults being talked about right come on what's wrong with that spirit see you don't got to be a preacher to do things wrong [Laughter] but the preacher the the pastor he sees the spirits he's got to deal with them now when i do something wrong i want you to come to me come to me tell me what is wrong if i say i don't want to hear you i don't want to talk to you then go tell somebody okay with that but a pastor should get back up and say i was wrong it is wrong for women to preach behind the pulpit their place is in their home the scripture says it here brother branham said it here i was wrong and that would be nothing wrong for a pastor to do that right because pastors are not perfect they shouldn't portray to be perfect either but it eliminates any confusion see it's done decently in order right now he's the one that tells the church preaching and pastoring is different it's often been said by visiting evangelists that come here an evangelist can come in and preach whatever he wants and he leaves it for the pastor to take care of how he's heard that from a number of evangelists because they they have the mindset that they don't have to worry their job is to stir the people get them on fire for god there's certain evangelists that you you you feel certain ministers look every pastor has comfortable feelings about other ministers they're in a pastor i know of or an evangelist i know of or a teacher i know of that hasn't said those things think about that here you got all of god's fivefold ministry and every one of them feels uncomfortable about another it's got to be that way it's got to be that way there are there are some that aren't mature yet some that don't care yet right right about the unity that's true brother branham said there's a lot of make-believe ones the bible says that the uh there's minister and the enemy as ministers of of that light as ministers of light but their motive is not to get us to perfection so you understand it's okay a shepherd has to be on guard because he's protecting the sheep it's normal it's not abnormal a pastor has to feel comfortable with who's behind here you want to be sitting there and on pins and needles what's going to be said because of other agendas being mixed in with what should be being done because a lot of times you know we're looking at only one part of our motive right and that's right to speak the truth right you husbands you want to speak the truth to your wives your wives do you want to speak the truth to your husband sometimes we forget the other motive i'm going to prove i was right just like last time yeah right right it's not about that's true the motive has to be love that's it i love i love we're family i already one single person in here i don't want to make it amen i love every single one and i want us all to grow up in christ now a pastor needs a lot of patience and helping the church to grow and i understand the difficulty of functioning in a church where everything is not just perfect i've had seven children nine of us oh my heart jonathan can testify i'd go i'd go to five different places to buy five different types of food to try to make everybody happy and you that have had two children you know how difficult it is to keep unity difficult we're a family but you all can't have your own way so patience is needed i have two companies and 15 employees i deal with their family issues we got vendors and customers i understand the difficulty how hard it is to function in order when you got people with their own ideas i understand how hard it is sometimes to come into work and create an atmosphere a right atmosphere in my shop when everybody has had a bad weekend now if that was my shop i could care less what happens in there but it's not mine i've only been a steward over it so now i'm responsible for that atmosphere not by constraint but willingly now i got to create an atmosphere there one that respects god don't have to go to church don't have to be a believer that you better respect right no pinups no wrong talking no arguings no talking behind people's back we don't do that here and when it pops up i don't say uh you know whatever that's just you know work i don't want to be face the lord with making me a steward or something and not really caring so i understand the difficulty of keeping a unity in a church when there's different spirits floating around amen if we all could be under christ checking our spirit being subject one to another respecting god's way of unity we would have much less problems and here's the reward god said i'll bless you with things that you've never seen before amen it don't happen by accident and it don't happen by having our most favorite preacher here it happens when we get mature and serious enough to say you know what i need to i need to be looking inwardly instead of outwardly i have learned a lot at work if you really want things better you make them better you be the leader you be the inspiration not telling people what to do tell you if if you did not know me and you walked into our shop you would never ever ever know i was the boss you would never know as the owner never i do not make my people ever feel like i'm the boss ever ever in fact i serve them i get underneath them and i be an example how they need to be to one another ain't no different in church amen church members have their own ideas new members we know don't have a lot of understanding religious members they have a lot of you know it all understanding attitudes basically to understand the difficult the difficulty of keeping order in the church it may not be the way that you would do it we may not understand pray pray because there's certain things that i believe have to be trusted the scripture teaches us when you're going to have a some deacon in the church you don't want a novice right well he's a believer he repented he gave his heart to god he justified he loves god it doesn't mean anything this is good this is really good it has to be not proven to just your favorite five people so what we want above everything is god in charge now i'm going to stop there because it's late and i'm about about eight pages short and i had the brothers told the brothers i said brothers pray for me he says i i i don't know if i should just go and extend a time or or cut it i i don't usually say those things you know i don't i usually don't tell my wife that but when i told her that she said what she got in other services you know but the thing is it's an important subject homie's going to be here next service okay those that will not be here just you can just watch it but this is for the for the furtherment of our church amen it's good to know who you're laboring with now understand it's not about how many sins i've committed whether it's on the scale of you being good enough or not good enough because if it was true none of us should be in church okay so it's on the basis of what we want to do we want to build our character into the image of christ and so whatever is lacking let's just pray one for another that god would put us in his order that we may grow up together in love i believe somebody's homies has been um this service right here has really helped your understanding let me just see your hands god bless you okay all i want to do is eliminate confusion bring order so so god can have his way amen let's stand together thank you for your patience and and brothers thank you for praying for me i just feel very sure and definite to stop where before service i didn't it was just i didn't know but i believe this is the right order amen amen god any rivers just take a moment just worship him amen [Music] you think are uncrossable got any mountains [Music] you can't know through god specializes [Music] in things thought impossible and he will do what no other friend can do what a friend we have got any rivers you think are uncrosstable [Music] not mountains you can't know through god's special lies in things thought impossible and he will do what no other friend can do [Music] amen let's just bow our heads and look to the lord in prayer our heavenly father lord we want to thank you today for you where would we be if you were not in our lives you brought order to our lives you brought order to our home to our work the way that we deal with things and lord how we desperately need it living in a world that's so out of order and it's getting more and more chaotic we need you on the inside to help us how to keep
