[33:18] this service today and that you'd make
[33:20] known to us by a way of revelation
[33:23] lord the direction that you have for us
[33:24] that lies ahead
[33:26] lord bless each one bless those that are
[33:28] in their homes
[33:29] father those that are live streaming
[33:31] lord those
[33:32] lord that have prepared themselves for
[33:34] the service today
[33:36] just pray that you would meet with them
[33:38] in a very special way lord we commit
[33:40] ourselves to you
[33:41] give you the praise and honor for these
[33:42] things now we ask in jesus name
[33:45] amen amen starting with first
[33:48] corinthians chapter 14 verse
[33:50] number 33 and verse 40 33 reads for god
[33:54] is not the author
[33:55] of confusion but the peace is in all
[33:59] churches of the saints so no different
[34:02] this church is no different than what
[34:03] god wants in another church
[34:05] he doesn't want any confusion he wants
[34:07] there to be peace
[34:09] amen verse 40 let all things be done
[34:12] decently
[34:13] and in order that's a tall order to fill
[34:17] but i believe god can help us with that
[34:20] and then
[34:20] first timothy chapter 3
[34:24] verse number 15. first timothy chapter 3
[34:27] verse number 15. there will have you be
[34:28] seated but if i tarry
[34:30] long that thou mayest
[34:34] know how thou ought is to behave thyself
[34:38] in the house of god which is the church
[34:42] of the living god the pillars and
[34:45] ground of the truth amen god bless you
[34:48] may be seated
[34:50] we've established undolly that god is a
[34:53] god of order
[34:54] it's not just part of him it is him
[34:58] and he is
[35:01] in his order is with reverence and
[35:04] respect
[35:05] he never wants to be approached uh with
[35:08] any kind of
[35:09] haphazard uncaring
[35:12] um i don't need to humble myself in fact
[35:15] the bible
[35:15] says every knee shall bow and every
[35:18] tongue shall confess
[35:20] uh god wants to hear from each of us as
[35:23] we enter
[35:23] into his uh the bible says enter into
[35:27] his gates with thanksgiving to his
[35:29] courts with praise
[35:30] god wants us to come into his presence
[35:32] with worship
[35:34] just like when isaiah came into the
[35:37] presence of the lord
[35:38] he saw that there was worship constantly
[35:40] happening
[35:42] and when you know we live in this
[35:43] natural life and we got to
[35:45] deal with things and it's hard uh to
[35:48] always have that
[35:49] spirit of praise on you but i think that
[35:50] we should um
[35:52] it should we should press towards that
[35:54] the bible says that we
[35:55] pray should continually come forth from
[35:58] us
[35:58] so when we come into god's house god
[36:00] doesn't want us come
[36:02] sitting like a bump on a log we have a
[36:04] job to do we have to reverence and
[36:06] respect him
[36:06] and and come in with worship and we
[36:09] cannot rely
[36:11] on uh brother ron to
[36:14] get us to that place to where we feel
[36:15] like doing it we need to come in with a
[36:17] mindset that this
[36:18] is what god expects out of me and and we
[36:22] need to give him our very best
[36:23] amen god also deals with us
[36:27] in a way of order not not ours i'm just
[36:30] going to throw some scriptures out real
[36:32] quick
[36:32] acts 2 38 then peter said unto them
[36:35] repent be baptized every one of you in
[36:36] the name of jesus christ for the
[36:38] remission of your sins
[36:39] and you shall receive the gift of the
[36:41] holy ghost now notice there is an order
[36:43] here to repent to get baptized
[36:46] and then receive the holy ghost acts 5
[36:48] 32
[36:49] god gave uh god have given to them the
[36:54] holy ghost
[36:55] to them that obey him so in other words
[36:58] we have to obey then the holy ghost
[37:00] comes
[37:01] uh hebrews 10 36 after you have done the
[37:04] will of god you might receive the
[37:06] promise we all want promises of god
[37:09] but we have a job to do right we we have
[37:12] to do
[37:12] the will of god acts 1 8 but ye shall
[37:16] receive power
[37:17] after the holy ghost has come upon you
[37:19] we want power well we need the holy
[37:21] ghost seek the holy ghost power will
[37:22] come
[37:24] isaiah 40 31 but they that wait upon the
[37:26] lord shall renew their strength
[37:28] we all want strength we want to be
[37:30] strong but how many of us are willing to
[37:32] wait on the lord so there's an
[37:34] order that god has for us and how he
[37:36] deals with us
[37:37] brother brahm taught us that god is not
[37:39] obligated to show us
[37:41] any more until we've walked in the light
[37:43] that god has given us
[37:46] think about that the order we want we
[37:48] want we want we're not short of wanting
[37:50] but god says look this is what i've
[37:51] given you i expect you to do this don't
[37:53] ask for anything more
[37:55] until you have done this brother brandon
[37:58] said when
[37:59] um perfect love is projected and has
[38:02] come to its end and sovereign grace will
[38:04] step in
[38:05] and grant what love was projected for we
[38:08] all want the grace of god in our life we
[38:10] want
[38:10] needs met but god says love has to be
[38:13] projected first amen showing in order
[38:17] he also said nothing but perfect love
[38:19] will enter in
[38:21] so what do we do with that statement
[38:23] brother brandon gave us the
[38:25] uh the advice when he said uh whatever
[38:28] you do
[38:29] lay everything else aside in your life
[38:32] tell me what's important to you if
[38:34] you're if your whole life is so
[38:36] important that you really don't care
[38:38] about getting perfect love you're not
[38:40] a candidate you're not a candidate for
[38:43] the rapture
[38:46] we've got to get our priorities set
[38:48] there's an order with god and god deals
[38:50] with the sword
[38:50] and he wants us to keep order
[38:54] there would be times that god would show
[38:56] brother branham a vision before it
[38:58] happened
[39:01] and then when time would go on brother
[39:02] brandon would realize that he's in that
[39:04] vision that the vision is
[39:05] actually presently taking place and he
[39:08] would know what was going to happen and
[39:10] we all remember the story
[39:12] about the the hat and he
[39:15] he says that can't happen till the hat
[39:16] would move and brother ryan would wanted
[39:19] he would he'd want to take that hat but
[39:21] he knew that he couldn't do it he
[39:23] couldn't
[39:24] interfere that god had
[39:27] to do it in his order not our order
[39:31] this is so important to understand that
[39:33] god is
[39:34] particular about order and that we need
[39:37] to
[39:37] to fall in line with the vision of this
[39:39] word and the vision of this message
[39:42] and the and have our church the way that
[39:44] that god set it to be not the way we
[39:46] would like it because look
[39:47] there's there's so many different
[39:48] churches and denominations out there
[39:50] that you could go find something that
[39:51] really fits your fancy
[39:53] it really fits your fa flesh in the way
[39:55] that you want things to be
[39:56] but you know that is not what god's
[39:58] coming for that may be what the world is
[40:00] looking for
[40:00] is something for now but we're looking
[40:02] for a church that will get us ready for
[40:04] a rapture that'll get us ready for his
[40:06] presence to come
[40:07] and do exploits amongst us amen
[40:11] so it all has to do with what we're
[40:13] looking for
[40:16] there's no confusion or misunderstanding
[40:20] in heaven there's no backbiting no
[40:23] murmuring no complaining
[40:24] no sowing discord we know what happened
[40:26] to lucifer as soon as he began to sow
[40:28] discord
[40:30] god threw him out proverbs 6 verse 16
[40:35] these six things stuff the lord hate
[40:38] so in other words they're out of order
[40:39] here yay seven are an abomination to him
[40:41] a proud look
[40:43] think about it a proud look
[40:47] what's that matter to god
[40:50] you don't stand in the presence of god
[40:52] with a proud look friend
[40:55] you may have it out there in the world
[40:57] and in the flesh but in god's presence
[40:59] you don't
[41:00] a lying tongue and hands that shed
[41:03] innocent blood
[41:04] a heart that deviseth wicked
[41:06] imaginations feet that
[41:08] be swift to run into mischief a false
[41:10] witness that speaketh lies
[41:12] and he that soweth discord among the
[41:15] brethren
[41:16] this is out of god's order we maybe feel
[41:20] comfortable with
[41:21] it we may feel like we have our rights
[41:24] but god has always been a god of order
[41:27] he always will be a god of order he will
[41:30] deal with us in an orderly fashion
[41:33] this morning we want to take a subject
[41:35] learning how to behave
[41:38] in the house of god
[41:42] how we behave ourselves in
[41:45] this church has a direct effect in the
[41:48] decision-making of the holy spirit
[41:50] in how or even if
[41:53] he will move amongst us the next time
[41:57] everybody should have said amen to that
[42:00] the prophet said how we act in god's
[42:02] house
[42:03] could hinder the next service
[42:07] so we think what does it matter as long
[42:09] as i'm here
[42:11] you're not here in my house this is
[42:14] god's house
[42:17] this isn't a worldly church the thing is
[42:23] we've gotten away from the way that
[42:26] god's house should be
[42:30] partly partly because it's
[42:34] the way that we have been serving god
[42:37] outside
[42:39] of the church and partly
[42:42] it's because the job of this
[42:46] pastor has not kept before the people
[42:50] how god's house needs to be which is not
[42:52] on you that's on me
[42:56] so we're going through it and by the
[42:57] grace of god i i would like to invite
[42:59] you to pray
[43:01] that that we're reminded of these things
[43:05] because that's that's that's that was
[43:07] the downfall
[43:10] as we're going through these series as
[43:12] we're going through this series and
[43:14] learning about god's order and
[43:18] of and and that we need to keep
[43:20] reverence and respect
[43:21] into his house i think we just we need
[43:23] to recognize that god is here
[43:26] sometimes we come into church and we
[43:28] just we come with such a carnality
[43:31] that uh we think it's just church
[43:34] in other words god's not really here and
[43:37] we come
[43:38] so caught up in our own life that we we
[43:42] we always come with uh this is what i
[43:44] expect out of the church this is what i
[43:46] want to get out of this
[43:47] i'm looking for this answer i'm looking
[43:49] for this direction and we
[43:51] we miss the reverence and respect of
[43:54] coming into god's house to find out
[43:56] where we're out of order
[43:57] where we stand with you lord
[44:00] we've we've made church different than
[44:02] what it should be
[44:08] holiness is the opposite of carnality
[44:15] of course you've got a carnal carnal
[44:17] spirit and and
[44:18] god's spirit they're opposites the
[44:21] carnal mind
[44:22] isn't even subject to god it'll just sit
[44:25] there
[44:25] and hear the word and do nothing about
[44:27] it
[44:30] but it's also the opposite of holiness
[44:34] and and and this is why we need to be
[44:36] serious
[44:37] about learning who god is and what he
[44:40] expects in his house
[44:46] i have so i don't know maybe 30 quotes
[44:49] 30 different messages 30 different
[44:50] messages how about that
[44:52] now i want to go through them just as
[44:53] quick as i can but this is
[44:56] i want to start out by describing the
[44:58] nature
[44:59] the lamb nature of the holy spirit
[45:02] brother iran said in the queen of sheba
[45:04] he says why you couldn't preach or pray
[45:06] for the sick like that
[45:07] there's too much confusion
[45:12] the holy spirit is timid everything must
[45:14] be done
[45:15] decently and in order for the holy
[45:18] spirit
[45:22] brother brother ron was praying in his
[45:25] prayer
[45:26] that or i i believe he was either
[45:29] praying or asking us to pray
[45:30] that um the the utterance that would
[45:33] come forth
[45:34] would be from the lord and what i like
[45:38] about this
[45:38] brother ryan is is got a whole bunch of
[45:40] quotes from the prophet i feel very
[45:42] i feel very comfortable hiding behind
[45:45] this message of knowing that it is the
[45:48] inspiration of the holy ghost
[45:50] in the message and from that time
[45:52] brother bram says see i have been in
[45:54] this
[45:54] world this work for 15 years
[45:58] and it causes confusion and it's not an
[46:01] arena
[46:02] or a playground it's the house of god
[46:04] reverence and
[46:05] respected the holy spirit is timid
[46:10] in the message the lamb and the dove
[46:13] brother brahman says the church of god
[46:14] is sitting in here so we want everything
[46:17] just in order
[46:19] you let it get out of order that's what
[46:21] happened
[46:22] you let it get out of order and watch
[46:25] how quickly
[46:26] the holy spirit will take its flight
[46:30] oh it's tim did you ever notice we've
[46:32] all sat here and we've watched
[46:34] things happen we we saw the spirit move
[46:36] something happened
[46:38] and and in a very strange things
[46:41] take place and all of a sudden it's just
[46:44] like
[46:45] it's just a formality what's going on
[46:50] you know we're responsible for the
[46:52] presence of the lord
[46:57] he says you let someone start
[46:59] disbelieving
[47:01] just watch how it leaves me just as
[47:03] quick as it came
[47:05] a spirit of unbelief in the sanctuary
[47:09] affects the moving of god
[47:17] i'll tell you when every man stands
[47:19] before the lord on that day
[47:21] there won't be no baloney
[47:24] you will not be able at that time to
[47:27] shrug off a negative i don't care what's
[47:30] the matter
[47:30] attitude at that point you will have to
[47:33] stand there
[47:34] and reverence god
[47:38] no matter what we can get away with it
[47:40] here we can have attitudes and
[47:41] negativity and
[47:42] and come into church the wrong way but
[47:44] there it won't happen
[47:46] it will not happen and we might as well
[47:48] get used to reverencing god the correct
[47:50] way now
[47:53] in the message of testimony on the sea
[47:54] brother adam said be alert
[47:57] the holy spirit is very timid i mean
[47:59] know that very timid it won't
[48:01] tolerate nothing wrong
[48:06] god's provided healing for this
[48:08] generation
[48:09] now we just got plenty of he says now we
[48:12] just got plenty of time
[48:14] don't be in any rush see see you get to
[48:17] rushing
[48:18] the holy spirit is very timid and i
[48:21] don't want you
[48:22] to rush i want you to be reverent
[48:25] like you have plenty of time
[48:28] how many times we just want to get out
[48:30] of service
[48:32] we want to get off this subject
[48:36] don't rush the lord he's doing something
[48:42] amen sirs be of good cheer brother
[48:45] brahman said
[48:46] sometimes in moving the holy spirit is
[48:48] very timid very timid the bible said
[48:50] grieve
[48:51] not the holy spirit of god be reverent
[48:55] now faith is moving all through the
[48:57] building
[48:58] so god is moving god is doing a
[49:02] wonderful thing in our midst and one
[49:04] person is
[49:13] any age grieve the spirit
[49:18] so we must be in charge
[49:22] what's going around us in charge
[49:26] it's not well you know here's this
[49:28] excuse and that excuse and
[49:33] the holy spirit's timid if you don't
[49:36] care
[49:36] why should he care
[49:41] you're going to over you're going to
[49:43] overlook your response he's just going
[49:44] to overlook
[49:46] you're look he's going to overlook your
[49:47] overlooking
[49:53] being led by the holy spirit brother
[49:55] says
[49:56] so you see it's so timid the holy spirit
[50:01] just the least little thing
[50:04] grieves it he says now be real reverent
[50:07] and jesus will come to you
[50:10] if you're all excited he can't come to
[50:14] you
[50:17] i'm speaking about being in the flesh
[50:18] i'm not speaking of the
[50:20] expectation of god now be reverent
[50:23] and believe in the message possessing
[50:26] the enemy's gate brethren says now
[50:28] be real reverent everybody now just be
[50:31] real reverend just
[50:33] keep quiet see the holy spirit is so
[50:36] timid let me know that
[50:37] just real timid the holy spirit see just
[50:40] any little
[50:41] interruption bothers him
[50:47] wow look how many quotes we quoted from
[50:50] on this subject and we think it's not a
[50:53] big deal
[50:54] what happens in the church but that's a
[50:58] man-made church
[51:00] that's a man-made thinking but it
[51:03] matters to god
[51:06] and that's what this church should be
[51:08] that's what this church was dedicated
[51:10] for
[51:10] for god to be the head of our church
[51:13] even if we could find the greatest man
[51:15] on the planet
[51:16] i personally i mean i would
[51:19] i would have no problem that man
[51:24] uh being uh the pastor of you all but
[51:27] i'm just speaking this
[51:30] i would rather have the holy ghost be
[51:33] the head of a church than the greatest
[51:34] man on the planet
[51:40] because man can only go so far just like
[51:42] love the human love only goes so far we
[51:45] need the love of god
[51:47] now there are two reasons for church
[51:49] order in our church
[51:51] one by far the most important we must
[51:54] maintain
[51:55] a reverence and respect to god in his
[51:57] house
[51:59] amen thank you brother the more you say
[52:02] amen
[52:02] the more this will become a part of your
[52:04] life
[52:06] if not we will grieve him away from here
[52:09] and not even know it how many times we
[52:13] just leave and
[52:15] come back and
[52:19] i wish we all had spiritual glasses so
[52:21] we could see what's going on in that
[52:22] spiritual realm
[52:24] so we must learn to respect god more
[52:27] by respecting his sanctuary
[52:31] his sanctuary aren't you glad
[52:34] that nobody can come in your house and
[52:37] tell you how to run your house
[52:42] aren't you glad that you are in charge
[52:44] of the decision-making in your house
[52:47] you wouldn't want somebody coming over
[52:49] there drinking and throwing the bottles
[52:51] around
[52:53] right
[52:57] be grateful that we have a place that we
[53:00] can have
[53:01] god's house exactly the way he wants it
[53:04] to be
[53:06] number two we must respect others
[53:09] who are perhaps more serious
[53:13] about god than we are in his house
[53:16] we got we got to respect his house for
[53:18] other people here who perhaps
[53:20] are more serious about god than you are
[53:23] so don't grieve the lord for their sake
[53:25] as well
[53:27] eternal life is living for others
[53:29] spiritual
[53:30] well-being and we can show eternal life
[53:34] right here in the church by respecting
[53:36] god's house
[53:39] our first subject is getting up during
[53:42] service
[53:48] do i hear four that's two three four
[53:52] every time you get up during the
[53:54] preaching
[53:56] you're disturbing someone you could very
[53:59] well be keeping someone
[54:01] from receiving
[54:04] you may not believe that or realize it
[54:07] but it is the truth it does it disrupts
[54:11] the holy ghost
[54:12] each time you get up
[54:16] if you're sick if you're pregnant
[54:20] or you have a small child sit
[54:24] in the back
[54:29] are you with me we're going to kind of
[54:31] get done to the nuts and bolts
[54:35] if you need to take a baby out
[54:39] due to noise it's best to stay out
[54:44] unless the baby quietens down
[54:49] the whole reason you're taking the baby
[54:50] out is to quiet the baby down
[54:52] get the baby quiet then you come back in
[54:56] i've had many practices with that
[54:58] through the years
[55:03] after you do it a couple times i mean if
[55:06] you do it two times and it's still
[55:09] i think then just walk with them in the
[55:12] hall
[55:14] try to try to keep them out
[55:19] and work with them out that's
[55:22] you know babies are babies they just
[55:24] they they don't know how to
[55:26] control themselves
[55:30] as they get older they will push that
[55:32] button as long as i can
[55:35] i don't know how to help myself
[55:44] please use the bathroom and get a drink
[55:48] before service i want to say this
[55:53] unless you're using the bathroom
[56:00] 30 times a day
[56:04] once every half hour whatever
[56:08] i'm sure you can wait an hour and a half
[56:12] if you honestly you have to go every
[56:14] half hour i mean boom boom
[56:16] boom boom boom boom sit in the back
[56:20] but if you can go you know three hours
[56:23] through the course of the day because
[56:24] you're working
[56:27] but you're having a hard time sitting
[56:29] still in church it's a different problem
[56:32] and all i'm saying is i'm trying to get
[56:35] rid of excuses
[56:39] and and
[56:43] don't get upset at me
[56:51] we're trying to establish the house of
[56:53] god
[56:54] there's a big difference
[56:57] i i know there's that feeling that wants
[56:59] to rise up and just
[57:02] but i'm being honest with you you know i
[57:05] would do nothing
[57:06] ever to bother anybody
[57:09] so it's not about me and my opinion or
[57:11] my pride
[57:12] or what i think it's about we need to
[57:15] start
[57:16] shaping this place in which there's
[57:19] as less disturbance less moving around
[57:23] less papers less as much as we can get
[57:26] so the lord feels welcome
[57:30] amen praise the lord in the message
[57:33] the voice of the sign brother brahman
[57:36] says
[57:37] see there's one thing you can't do
[57:40] you can't have a disturbance the holy
[57:43] spirit is timid
[57:45] see you must be obedient
[57:49] during the time
[57:52] and it's hard to be obedient
[57:57] i mean when we're at home we would just
[57:59] love to get on that lazy boy
[58:01] get a cup of coffee listen to a tape and
[58:11] i i feel that we're we're
[58:14] we could be exercising more reverence
[58:18] instead of like less in saying well god
[58:21] knows my heart
[58:23] yes god knows our god knows our heart
[58:26] and i'm so glad that god sent a prophet
[58:29] with not just
[58:30] isolated
[58:33] quotes but sending us a clear cut
[58:36] message of of how the sanctuary needs to
[58:40] be
[58:41] in the message taking god at his word
[58:43] brother brandon says now be just
[58:44] reverent just be as reverent as you can
[58:48] i ask you as christian people to be
[58:52] reverent don't move around
[58:57] love it jesus christ the same yesterday
[59:00] and forever brother
[59:01] says just be real reverend watch now if
[59:03] you want to praise god that's all right
[59:06] but don't get up and walk around you
[59:08] know and things like that
[59:09] it interferes the holy spirit is very
[59:12] timid
[59:12] real timid of course you didn't know it
[59:16] maybe till now but be real reverend oh i
[59:19] love the way he said that
[59:22] in other words okay this is the first
[59:24] time you're hearing about this
[59:26] it's okay but now that we heard
[59:32] see the hard work is going to be how you
[59:34] react to this
[59:35] next week the week after next month
[59:38] that's going to be the hard work
[59:42] because right now nobody is going to
[59:44] move
[59:46] everybody's going to they're going to do
[59:48] everything they can to hold it
[59:51] you know sometimes we just have to learn
[59:55] not to eat and drink so much
[59:59] right before service i mean just try to
[1:00:02] use wisdom
[1:00:07] to think about this i want to try to
[1:00:09] help
[1:00:11] to think that you're honoring respecting
[1:00:13] god more
[1:00:14] doesn't that please you
[1:00:20] you think about making god happy that
[1:00:22] that should make us happy so we're
[1:00:24] we're we're doing this for all the right
[1:00:26] reasons
[1:00:28] in the message spiritual signs of the
[1:00:31] time brother branham says
[1:00:32] after nine o'clock i noticed that the
[1:00:35] people begin
[1:00:35] one getting up walking here going out
[1:00:39] why see that disturbs it distracts
[1:00:42] from the meeting so now he's pinpointing
[1:00:46] a time that usually it begins to happen
[1:00:51] i love that he doesn't say oh that's
[1:00:54] okay the meeting's almost over
[1:00:59] he says don't do that
[1:01:02] in the message god being misunderstood
[1:01:05] brother brahm said
[1:01:06] the least you can do is be reverent be
[1:01:08] quiet
[1:01:10] get you a drink of water before church
[1:01:13] starts
[1:01:15] i know little ones has to have drinks
[1:01:18] mothers they got little fellas if you
[1:01:22] sit near the back keep them just as
[1:01:25] quiet as possible
[1:01:27] and there should never be a whisper
[1:01:30] never
[1:01:31] one whisper he says we're all guilty
[1:01:36] but when that bible is read and the
[1:01:38] minister enters the pulpit
[1:01:40] we should be silent waiting on the lord
[1:01:44] now please try to do that
[1:01:48] and i know i got little ones too that
[1:01:50] squirm around and joseph and
[1:01:52] and mita says i don't get anything out
[1:01:55] of the service trying to keep joe quiet
[1:01:59] well she's trying to do that so somebody
[1:02:02] else can get something out of the
[1:02:04] service
[1:02:05] see she's doing her job
[1:02:08] even though she's not able to get
[1:02:09] something out she's doing her
[1:02:12] job so somebody else can so just because
[1:02:15] you're not getting something out of it
[1:02:17] doesn't mean we can let
[1:02:18] our children just do whatever they're
[1:02:21] doing
[1:02:22] it's not the right motive first is our
[1:02:24] responsibility
[1:02:25] to keep things in order with what
[1:02:27] belongs to us
[1:02:29] and then
[1:02:35] and we always want to respect one
[1:02:37] another same quote and we always want
[1:02:40] right there right underneath and we
[1:02:41] always want to respect one another honor
[1:02:43] one another
[1:02:44] and above all things honor god and honor
[1:02:46] his house amen
[1:02:48] i love that because so many people had
[1:02:50] this mentality of oh it's just between
[1:02:52] me and god and nothing else matters it's
[1:02:54] just
[1:02:55] it's all between me and god nothing
[1:02:57] matters out here
[1:03:00] i don't understand that what about a
[1:03:02] life
[1:03:04] what about the holy ghost inside of you
[1:03:06] where where does that come in
[1:03:08] well it's not necessary it's not we're
[1:03:11] missing it
[1:03:13] we're on trial here when god says well
[1:03:16] done thou good and faithful servant what
[1:03:17] is he referring to
[1:03:19] this private relationship that we have
[1:03:22] with him and nothing else matters out
[1:03:23] here
[1:03:25] no he's looking for this to be put in
[1:03:28] order so he can say
[1:03:30] to us well done amen
[1:03:34] and the message sure we would see jesus
[1:03:36] brother bran says now please
[1:03:38] i ask again don't walk around
[1:03:42] please see the holy spirit is just as
[1:03:44] timid as it can be and sometimes
[1:03:46] when you're moving see you're a spirit
[1:03:50] you're a soul then when you move that
[1:03:53] interferes
[1:03:54] see so just be real quiet be real
[1:03:56] reverent
[1:03:58] so even though we're walking around
[1:04:01] walking out whatever we're doing we
[1:04:03] don't realize
[1:04:04] that it's interfering in the spiritual
[1:04:07] realm
[1:04:09] i just love this and the quotes are
[1:04:11] coming from so many
[1:04:13] different messages
[1:04:16] in the message but it wasn't so from the
[1:04:18] beginning brother branham said
[1:04:20] the reason i didn't have a healing
[1:04:22] service and i can't have it when people
[1:04:25] are moving
[1:04:26] around think about it the holy spirit is
[1:04:30] timid anybody knows that
[1:04:32] he just leaves like he did in the bible
[1:04:36] now he's trying now he's pointing us
[1:04:39] that what he's doing
[1:04:40] in brother ben is the same thing that he
[1:04:41] did in the bible
[1:04:44] and when you move around it just
[1:04:46] interferes
[1:04:48] you just can't do it so i know we got
[1:04:50] these urges and we're
[1:04:52] you know what we have so many urges
[1:04:55] right
[1:04:56] well recognize that's the enemy urging
[1:04:59] you
[1:05:02] and what's happening right now the holy
[1:05:04] spirit is urging you
[1:05:07] to to be still to be reverent because
[1:05:10] god wants to do something
[1:05:11] i'll say it like this they if you just
[1:05:14] wait on the lord
[1:05:16] you know you know brother branham speaks
[1:05:18] many times about
[1:05:19] when you come to deceit the lord and you
[1:05:22] want something from him
[1:05:23] and you think you got it he says you
[1:05:25] need to stay there and make sure
[1:05:27] that you get it and then after you think
[1:05:29] you've got it after that you need to
[1:05:30] stay there a little bit longer and make
[1:05:32] sure you got it it's all about
[1:05:35] forcing yourself to stay before the lord
[1:05:37] more than your flesh wants to
[1:05:39] we all deal with this every morning when
[1:05:41] we get up to pray we only want to pray
[1:05:43] so long and god we know something
[1:05:45] inside of us is telling us we need to
[1:05:47] spend more time with the lord
[1:05:49] but the flesh is saying no i get going
[1:05:51] i'll finish the rest
[1:05:52] in the car eat my bowl of cheerios or
[1:05:54] whatever it might be
[1:06:01] in the message be be not afraid it is i
[1:06:06] now i'm just going to wait a moment i'm
[1:06:09] waiting for the audience
[1:06:11] to get quiet i wonder
[1:06:14] how many times the lord is waiting here
[1:06:18] for us to get in order
[1:06:22] he says i'm waiting for the audience to
[1:06:23] get quiet to get reverent
[1:06:26] the holy spirit is so timid just one
[1:06:28] little thing
[1:06:29] he will go away he will just
[1:06:32] leave me
[1:06:36] the message that identified christ of
[1:06:38] all ages brother abraham said the holy
[1:06:39] spirit is timid very
[1:06:41] very timid and where
[1:06:44] you have just one unbeliever or a
[1:06:46] skeptic
[1:06:48] sitting around and the holy spirit just
[1:06:51] can't work hardly remember jesus
[1:06:55] let a man plum out of the city to heal
[1:06:57] him one time
[1:06:58] get him away from the unbelief
[1:07:02] he come into his own sitting the bible
[1:07:04] says and many mighty works he could not
[1:07:06] do
[1:07:07] we don't want to think in that way but
[1:07:10] the bible said
[1:07:11] he couldn't do it see he cannot do
[1:07:14] anything against your
[1:07:16] belief you've got to believe it
[1:07:19] so we if you don't believe god's here
[1:07:21] and wants to be reverent you know that
[1:07:22] just messes up
[1:07:27] and also in the message it is i be not
[1:07:30] afraid
[1:07:31] but it was a different time that he
[1:07:33] preached it so it's still a different
[1:07:34] message
[1:07:36] i love this we're not reading any from
[1:07:37] the same message so far
[1:07:39] he says now be real reverent now we want
[1:07:41] to worship we want
[1:07:43] god worshipped he said we want god
[1:07:46] worship we like to worship him
[1:07:47] but the holy spirit is so timid just be
[1:07:50] real quiet
[1:07:52] now you little fellows be nice down here
[1:07:57] down here now in front real nice now be
[1:07:59] real quiet
[1:08:01] everybody start praying now i think it's
[1:08:04] okay for the children to sit in front
[1:08:08] absolutely but brother man says got to
[1:08:12] be quiet you got to be still
[1:08:15] everybody start praying now father i
[1:08:18] am needy set in the atmosphere you with
[1:08:24] me
[1:08:25] everybody know what to do about moving
[1:08:26] around in the church
[1:08:29] how many is with me to put start putting
[1:08:31] this in practice
[1:08:34] amen in the message not in the message
[1:08:37] the next topic we'll get into that
[1:08:39] the next topic is talking in the
[1:08:41] sanctuary
[1:08:43] we should never be talking in the
[1:08:45] sanctuary
[1:08:47] we've read a couple quotes but we're
[1:08:48] going to read some more when you bring
[1:08:51] visitors with you you are responsible
[1:08:54] for letting them know
[1:08:55] that this is the place that we meet god
[1:08:57] the sanctuary is holy and we keep it
[1:09:00] quiet and reverent
[1:09:01] here while we're here you can't expect
[1:09:04] them to know it
[1:09:06] so we want to bring visitors but we also
[1:09:09] need to take the time
[1:09:11] to tell them
[1:09:14] well i'm afraid they're going to get
[1:09:15] offended well okay would you rather
[1:09:18] offend them or offend god
[1:09:24] we need to be in prayer in reading our
[1:09:26] bible before
[1:09:28] service and listening to what the spirit
[1:09:30] is saying
[1:09:31] during the ministry of the word
[1:09:36] god we're preparing
[1:09:39] to meet god
[1:09:42] in the message god being misunderstood
[1:09:46] brother brahman says children do
[1:09:49] you not know how to obey yourself
[1:09:53] in the house of god so he's talking to
[1:09:55] the children
[1:09:57] he says do you not know that this is the
[1:10:00] sanctuary of god
[1:10:02] god is in his holy temple
[1:10:05] let everybody keep quiet
[1:10:09] everybody that's not just the children
[1:10:11] that's adults
[1:10:13] it's the place of god where people are
[1:10:15] coming meditating trying to find
[1:10:17] salvation to their soul
[1:10:19] trying to find the problems of people's
[1:10:21] lives trying to
[1:10:22] help someone the least that you can do
[1:10:24] is be reverent be quiet
[1:10:26] and there should never be a whisper
[1:10:28] never one whisper
[1:10:35] this is something that we got to talk
[1:10:37] about in our homes
[1:10:39] this is something that we got to remind
[1:10:40] one another
[1:10:42] because we we forget and things slip
[1:10:48] and then we begin to make excuses
[1:10:51] in the message god hiding himself in
[1:10:53] simplicity and revealing himself in the
[1:10:55] same
[1:10:57] brother brandon says and now this may
[1:10:59] seem a little rude
[1:11:02] but it's not the place to visit it's a
[1:11:05] place of worship
[1:11:07] we should never even murmur a word
[1:11:10] inside of here
[1:11:12] outside of worship to one another unless
[1:11:16] it's
[1:11:16] absolutely necessary
[1:11:21] well you know what in our mind every
[1:11:23] time we do it
[1:11:24] we think it's absolutely necessary
[1:11:29] and all i'm asking you to do is think
[1:11:31] again
[1:11:34] if we need to talk to our children
[1:11:39] carry him out talk to him out there
[1:11:42] now i just i i it is probably not the
[1:11:45] perfect time to say this i don't know if
[1:11:47] it is or not i'm just going to say it
[1:11:48] but
[1:11:49] sister ann was sharing with me something
[1:11:51] that brother roger had uh
[1:11:54] shared with me back when we were having
[1:11:56] services
[1:11:57] in our homes and we weren't gathering
[1:11:58] together and and that was james
[1:12:01] was preparing for church in his home
[1:12:04] and that he would dress up and he'd be
[1:12:07] ready for church
[1:12:08] as if he was coming to church he didn't
[1:12:11] stain his jammies and say
[1:12:15] church at home but
[1:12:18] he he got himself in order and he did
[1:12:21] that because
[1:12:22] he has parents that wanted to encourage
[1:12:25] that
[1:12:27] now what was so wonderful about that is
[1:12:29] that when he came
[1:12:30] back to church it wasn't like he missed
[1:12:33] church for a few weeks and didn't know
[1:12:34] how to sit still
[1:12:36] i know since then there's been some
[1:12:38] times that have slipped
[1:12:42] but it shows you that if we spend time
[1:12:44] training
[1:12:46] at home that we can have things better
[1:12:49] in church and that's why i'm saying we
[1:12:52] need to take time
[1:12:53] to talk about these things at home and
[1:12:55] joe don't just
[1:12:56] expect you know
[1:13:00] church to keep you know saying it
[1:13:02] because
[1:13:03] we want to go on to to to other things
[1:13:06] amen
[1:13:08] amen
[1:13:12] so brethren says god is in his holy
[1:13:15] temple let everybody be quiet
[1:13:17] it's the place of god okay i've read
[1:13:20] that i'm so sorry i'm so
[1:13:22] god hid in simplicity unless it's
[1:13:25] absolutely necessary
[1:13:27] don't murmur a word he said see what we
[1:13:30] should never rally around we should
[1:13:33] never
[1:13:34] run through the building or let our
[1:13:37] children run through the building
[1:13:40] of course many of you are strangers and
[1:13:42] the tabernacle folks know this
[1:13:45] that the building is going to be
[1:13:46] dedicated to the service of almighty
[1:13:49] therefore dedicate dedicating ourselves
[1:13:53] let's remember
[1:13:54] when we enter the sanctuary keep still
[1:13:57] to one another and to worship
[1:14:00] god so it's part of our dedicating our
[1:14:03] lives
[1:14:04] is how we're dedicating our life to the
[1:14:07] tabernacle of god
[1:14:09] see it's so much noise and things it's
[1:14:11] it's just
[1:14:13] humanly and i've seen it in churches
[1:14:16] until it's made me feel real bad
[1:14:19] because we do not come into the
[1:14:20] sanctuary of the lord to meet
[1:14:22] each other we come here to worship
[1:14:26] god then go to our homes
[1:14:30] the sanctuary is dedicated to worship
[1:14:33] stand outside and talk anything you wish
[1:14:38] as long as it's right and holy go to one
[1:14:42] another's homes
[1:14:43] visit with one another in place
[1:14:46] but when you enter that door
[1:14:50] be quiet sometimes you know people enter
[1:14:53] this door just because they're not in
[1:14:55] here
[1:14:58] we'll get into that can't do that
[1:15:05] you come here to talk to him see
[1:15:08] and let him talk back to you the trouble
[1:15:11] of it is we do too much talking
[1:15:14] and don't listen enough then when you
[1:15:18] come in here
[1:15:18] wait on him i stood behind
[1:15:22] three crosses here to dedicate the place
[1:15:25] i would not permit anybody the usher
[1:15:28] stood at the door
[1:15:29] to see that nobody talked
[1:15:32] and when you're done do your talking
[1:15:35] outside
[1:15:36] you come in you desire too silently you
[1:15:39] come to the altar and pray
[1:15:41] silently you walk back to your seat and
[1:15:45] open your bible
[1:15:47] this is before the service now
[1:15:51] what your neighbor done that's up to him
[1:15:54] you had nothing to say if you want to
[1:15:57] talk to him say
[1:15:58] i'll see him outside i'm here to worship
[1:16:02] the lord
[1:16:04] you read his word and sit quietly now
[1:16:06] notice
[1:16:07] brother branham wasn't worried about
[1:16:10] that person getting offended
[1:16:14] how are you going to compare offending a
[1:16:16] person
[1:16:17] against offending god
[1:16:22] i mean yeah we want to say things nicely
[1:16:25] but the thing is we're all we're so
[1:16:28] scared
[1:16:31] to do things to keep things in order
[1:16:33] because we don't want to offend anybody
[1:16:35] it's like our witnessing we don't want
[1:16:37] to witness to anybody
[1:16:38] because we're afraid of offending them
[1:16:41] so you're going to let them go to hell
[1:16:42] because you're afraid offending them
[1:16:44] it just doesn't make sense tell them the
[1:16:47] truth that's the only thing that'll set
[1:16:48] them free
[1:16:51] talking by the bathrooms or
[1:16:55] prayer rooms before service so this is
[1:16:58] now talking
[1:16:59] in the hall by the bathroom outside of
[1:17:02] the prayer rooms here
[1:17:03] not in the sanctuary
[1:17:07] this also is going to tie into church
[1:17:09] preparation
[1:17:11] when we're talking outside of the prayer
[1:17:13] rooms or the halls or even by the
[1:17:15] bathroom door
[1:17:16] before service our voice carries
[1:17:20] into the sanctuary and into the prayer
[1:17:23] rooms
[1:17:25] and i'm sorry about that when we get the
[1:17:27] other church there'll be a little bit
[1:17:28] more liberty
[1:17:30] things are a little bit we've got some
[1:17:32] concrete blocks and
[1:17:34] i think uh we're gonna be a lot better
[1:17:37] shape in this direction
[1:17:38] and we'll be able to have maybe little
[1:17:40] places
[1:17:41] uh but
[1:17:45] it's something that the more we talk
[1:17:49] now the more you're convincing the
[1:17:51] person
[1:17:52] you're talking to that you're here for
[1:17:54] other reasons
[1:17:56] than to meet with god by you keeping
[1:18:00] your focus on god
[1:18:02] your reason why you're here the more
[1:18:05] that you're going to be able to be a
[1:18:06] testimony for the lord
[1:18:09] and the more we're going to get from god
[1:18:11] because remember
[1:18:12] if god's a god of order he deals with us
[1:18:14] in order maybe we haven't been able to
[1:18:16] receive from the lord the way we want
[1:18:18] because things just haven't been in
[1:18:19] order
[1:18:21] are you with me it's okay if more of you
[1:18:23] say amen
[1:18:27] so always remember you can be heard
[1:18:32] we want to learn to be reverent and to
[1:18:34] save our talking for after service
[1:18:38] this is all about learning we're here
[1:18:40] about learning how to be reverent in
[1:18:41] god's house and to maintain
[1:18:43] this reverence
[1:18:47] wherever at in the building talking
[1:18:48] about the service
[1:18:50] talking before the service is going to
[1:18:54] disrupt
[1:18:55] those preparing for the service
[1:18:58] i don't know how many times i've been in
[1:19:00] prayer and here talking
[1:19:04] but i feel not so much for me but for
[1:19:06] those who are really trying to enter
[1:19:08] in trying to get a hold of god
[1:19:11] trying to prepare their heart and a lot
[1:19:13] of time some of these faithful prayer
[1:19:15] wars you know what they're doing they're
[1:19:16] praying for you
[1:19:19] because you're not in the prayer room
[1:19:22] and then you don't care enough to be
[1:19:24] quiet
[1:19:25] but want to talk think about what i'm
[1:19:28] saying here
[1:19:36] be mindful that even after service has
[1:19:38] ended there could still be someone here
[1:19:41] in the sanctuary seeking the lord
[1:19:45] trying to get a need met for their life
[1:19:49] trying to get deliverance seeking the
[1:19:51] holy ghost
[1:19:52] praying for praying
[1:19:56] to get in contact with god for a certain
[1:19:59] thing
[1:20:00] and your voice is carrying after service
[1:20:06] so i'll say it like this make sure
[1:20:08] service
[1:20:09] is really over for everybody but you
[1:20:13] before you begin to talk are you with me
[1:20:17] all right you're not mad at me right
[1:20:20] you love me right all right
[1:20:23] in the message god hiding himself in
[1:20:25] simplicity again
[1:20:27] reviewing himself the same brother
[1:20:28] brandon says but when you enter the door
[1:20:30] be quiet
[1:20:31] you come in here to talk to god to let
[1:20:33] them talk back to you the trouble is
[1:20:35] we do too much talk and we don't listen
[1:20:38] enough
[1:20:40] i want to get to a certain point here in
[1:20:42] this quote
[1:20:46] um
[1:20:50] he says but there is nobody
[1:20:53] but there is nobody worships the lord
[1:20:55] while you're talking passing notes
[1:20:58] and you're helping someone else get away
[1:21:00] from the worship
[1:21:01] of the lord see so that's what's
[1:21:04] happening
[1:21:05] when you're out of and you're in the
[1:21:07] flesh
[1:21:08] dealing with something you're actually
[1:21:11] helping another person
[1:21:14] get out of contact with god
[1:21:17] see so we feel that would be wrong
[1:21:20] and we want to make that a ruling
[1:21:23] in our church
[1:21:26] that in our congregation that to this
[1:21:30] building this church we will dedicate to
[1:21:32] the kingdom of god
[1:21:33] and to the preaching of the word pray
[1:21:35] worship that's the reason you come here
[1:21:38] to worship them so we don't pass notes
[1:21:49] i'd like to say it at any age and here's
[1:21:52] why i'm saying it
[1:21:54] if we let a child pass a no
[1:21:59] a lot of times going to pass it to an
[1:22:01] adult
[1:22:04] and then now adults are passing notes
[1:22:06] and when at what age do we tell them no
[1:22:09] we don't pass notes in church
[1:22:13] you understand what i'm saying so i'm
[1:22:14] just we're trying to use wisdom about
[1:22:16] about the subject if we just shy away
[1:22:18] from it
[1:22:20] then we don't gotta worry about
[1:22:22] retraining
[1:22:25] he says and then i've seen churches
[1:22:27] though
[1:22:28] to where the children were permitted to
[1:22:30] run all over the sanctuary
[1:22:33] and adults standing and hollering across
[1:22:35] the room to one another
[1:22:38] he said that's a good way to ruin the
[1:22:40] service for that night
[1:22:44] for the next service
[1:22:47] or whatever time it is so in other words
[1:22:50] it could be another day
[1:22:52] so as soon as service is dismissed leave
[1:22:54] the auditorium
[1:22:55] you're through in the worshipping then
[1:22:57] then go out
[1:22:58] and talk to one another and whatever you
[1:23:00] want to or and whatever you want to do
[1:23:03] if you get something you want to talk to
[1:23:04] somebody about to see them well
[1:23:06] you go with them and go to their homes
[1:23:08] or whatever it is
[1:23:10] but don't do it in the auditorium let's
[1:23:12] dedicate this to god
[1:23:14] see i always like brother ben says ccc
[1:23:16] all the time
[1:23:18] he wants to make sure we get it this is
[1:23:20] the meeting place
[1:23:21] this is his meeting place where we meet
[1:23:23] with him
[1:23:24] see and the law goes forth from the
[1:23:26] sanctuary of course
[1:23:28] and i believe that would be pleasing to
[1:23:30] our heavenly father and i just say amen
[1:23:32] i believe what we're saying today would
[1:23:34] be pleasing to god
[1:23:38] all right you know we got a lot of stuff
[1:23:41] here
[1:23:43] and is it okay that if we just
[1:23:46] you know go with it
[1:23:53] i'm just by faith i believe everyone
[1:23:55] said amen in their heart
[1:23:56] at that point you know i just i feel it
[1:24:00] all right cell phone use
[1:24:04] we do not have any scriptures on cell
[1:24:06] phones
[1:24:08] we do not have any quotes on cell phones
[1:24:11] they weren't around when brother branham
[1:24:14] was ministering if he was though i
[1:24:17] believe i'd have a lot of them
[1:24:20] they have caused so much disturbance
[1:24:25] i do know that we've had many
[1:24:26] distractions and interruptions through
[1:24:28] the years
[1:24:30] and unfortunately it's added to the
[1:24:32] confusion
[1:24:33] in the sanctuary it's leaving things
[1:24:36] more out of order
[1:24:38] now of course no cell phone goes off
[1:24:41] because you wanted to
[1:24:44] it's the fact as a child
[1:24:48] you have a responsibility with that cell
[1:24:50] phone
[1:24:51] i i don't care if you don't mean it
[1:24:55] i don't care if you didn't attend it i
[1:24:58] care
[1:24:58] that you learn to take care of it before
[1:25:00] you enter into the sanctuary
[1:25:07] it would be great if it's turned off
[1:25:08] then you never have to worry about it
[1:25:10] at the very least is put on silent
[1:25:16] not vibrant
[1:25:25] it if the slightest little thing
[1:25:28] disrupts the holy spirit
[1:25:31] hey god i didn't think it mattered it's
[1:25:33] not a big deal
[1:25:36] it's a big deal we want to take care of
[1:25:39] big deals
[1:25:42] now i'm okay things are going to slip
[1:25:45] all of us are going to slip
[1:25:46] what i'm not okay with is the spirit and
[1:25:48] the attitude that we bring in the church
[1:25:49] that nothing matters
[1:25:52] that's the same thing lucifer had
[1:25:56] it's the same thing laodiceans have need
[1:25:58] of nothing
[1:25:59] it's lacking the fear and reverence
[1:26:03] respect that god deserves so we want to
[1:26:06] do
[1:26:07] all things decently in order with our
[1:26:09] cell phones
[1:26:12] cell phones should be turned off amen
[1:26:17] if it's too if it's too dangerous
[1:26:21] to text and drive which we know it is
[1:26:25] why would we think it's not too
[1:26:28] dangerous
[1:26:30] to have our cell phone on in god's
[1:26:31] sanctuary and i'm going to tell you why
[1:26:34] because you don't think this is god's
[1:26:36] house
[1:26:39] you in your mind in your heart
[1:26:43] you have belittled this place to what
[1:26:46] you have made it
[1:26:51] and that shows that why god's not moving
[1:26:54] amongst us like he could because we're
[1:26:56] not coming with the expectation that
[1:26:58] god's here
[1:26:59] we're coming because it's church
[1:27:02] it's time
[1:27:13] just remember every time you want to
[1:27:15] text when you drive
[1:27:17] think of this god doesn't want us
[1:27:21] texting and dealing with our phones
[1:27:24] hearing our phones have anything to do
[1:27:26] with our phones he didn't invent the
[1:27:27] phones
[1:27:30] that's your own business for your own
[1:27:31] work for your own personal
[1:27:36] god it's between us and god when we come
[1:27:39] here amen
[1:27:42] now when you're using your cell phone as
[1:27:44] a bible
[1:27:45] you are appearing to be on your phone
[1:27:48] during
[1:27:48] service which is not the best example
[1:27:53] the best example would be for you to
[1:27:56] bring
[1:27:56] your bible to church and
[1:28:00] read it
[1:28:03] well brother john i don't think there's
[1:28:06] a difference
[1:28:09] really can i prove you wrong
[1:28:16] how many times have you looked at the
[1:28:18] wrong thing on your cell phone
[1:28:23] well we're all guilty we all should
[1:28:26] raise our heads we should all say amen
[1:28:27] now
[1:28:28] i know you're withholding from me
[1:28:32] how many times have you opened this book
[1:28:34] and looked at something wrong
[1:28:38] let's keep the sanctuary just like this
[1:28:41] book
[1:28:42] are you with me
[1:28:47] we have to use our cell phones sometimes
[1:28:50] for recording
[1:28:51] i've been number of times that somebody
[1:28:54] in our church could not make it to
[1:28:56] church and i've set my phone right up
[1:28:58] here
[1:28:58] so they could hear the service
[1:29:02] and most the times we have to use the
[1:29:04] cell phone
[1:29:05] in the back for the live streaming now
[1:29:09] so if you see
[1:29:11] that happening no it's for the work of
[1:29:15] the lord
[1:29:16] and only for the work of the lord
[1:29:21] eating and drinking in the church
[1:29:29] we don't have time but you can write
[1:29:30] this down there's a scripture first
[1:29:32] corinthians chapter 11
[1:29:33] 17-34
[1:29:37] it's about not having the right motive
[1:29:39] when we come to church
[1:29:42] it's about eating and drinking in church
[1:29:45] and having
[1:29:46] a judgmental spirit when we come to
[1:29:48] church
[1:29:50] and paul said you have houses to eat
[1:29:53] and to drink in and don't come to church
[1:29:57] with a judgmental or critical spirit
[1:30:00] but he said let everyone examine
[1:30:03] themselves that's why we come find out
[1:30:05] where they're at with god
[1:30:08] and then we can truly partake of the
[1:30:11] bread of life the word of god amen
[1:30:14] i believe it would be pleasing to the
[1:30:15] lord not to have any eating or drinking
[1:30:18] of any sorts going on inside the
[1:30:20] sanctuary
[1:30:24] if we need to eat something or drink
[1:30:26] something
[1:30:27] let's do it before we enter the
[1:30:29] sanctuary now i've seen people come in
[1:30:31] here with pops and coffees and the whole
[1:30:33] nine yards
[1:30:36] and the thing is
[1:30:43] can you imagine isaiah hey i just
[1:30:46] you know if it's okay i want to bring my
[1:30:48] mountain dew
[1:30:55] i believe we're expressing to god
[1:30:56] respect
[1:30:58] and offering god reverence when we keep
[1:31:02] that stuff out of the sanctuary
[1:31:06] now we do need to offer water to the
[1:31:09] ministers
[1:31:14] and to the worship team
[1:31:20] because we're coming here to worship the
[1:31:21] lord and
[1:31:23] they need that but that's the line
[1:31:27] that's the line
[1:31:30] um honestly i'd rather be pouched dry
[1:31:34] and not move until service is over
[1:31:40] than to get up because you're thirsty
[1:31:42] before you know it you're always thirsty
[1:31:44] you don't realize it's the spirit that
[1:31:45] god gets on you just wants to disrupt
[1:31:47] the service and you know what's going on
[1:31:53] and the message influences brother bran
[1:31:55] says now
[1:31:56] no wonder they can't believe a real true
[1:31:59] message no wonder they can't have these
[1:32:01] things
[1:32:01] in church no wonder they have to put him
[1:32:04] on the outside in the last days there's
[1:32:06] no reverence in his presence
[1:32:08] notice there's no reverence in his
[1:32:10] presence his presence came
[1:32:12] can come down and they'll laugh and and
[1:32:16] pop chewing gum and walk around and
[1:32:18] carry on
[1:32:19] and i don't know what not no more
[1:32:22] reverence than
[1:32:23] nothing in his presence now no reverence
[1:32:26] at all for god and his people
[1:32:29] why why do they do this now listen close
[1:32:33] why do they do it they are not
[1:32:36] conscience of his presence
[1:32:40] they don't think that god is here
[1:32:51] in the message why brother brahman says
[1:32:52] then you'll have your church
[1:32:54] setting in order then you'll have your
[1:32:56] church setting how many want your church
[1:32:57] in order
[1:32:59] amen that's why we're doing this but the
[1:33:01] way it is they just fly loose
[1:33:03] anywhere somebody chewing gum in another
[1:33:05] eating popcorn and one
[1:33:07] talking and another whispering and
[1:33:09] someone trying to speak in times in
[1:33:10] three and four in time and
[1:33:12] this one trying and oh my it becomes a
[1:33:15] corinthian affair again
[1:33:17] he says you ought to get back in order
[1:33:20] back
[1:33:21] with the holy spirit
[1:33:25] the message hear ye him brother bram
[1:33:27] says in the lame walked and the blind
[1:33:29] seeing the spirit of god fall into the
[1:33:31] meeting discern the very thoughts in
[1:33:32] their hearts
[1:33:33] and great prophetic things will go forth
[1:33:36] that's
[1:33:37] perfect every time just exactly and the
[1:33:39] church says
[1:33:40] well that's all right big wad of chewing
[1:33:44] gum
[1:33:44] sitting there you know yeah that's all
[1:33:47] right but we're going to
[1:33:49] see lucy tomorrow night remember i love
[1:33:52] lucy
[1:33:54] and we just we we're just not going to
[1:33:57] church see the pastor
[1:33:58] he just wants to condemn us
[1:34:04] let him condemn us we'll go over to
[1:34:05] another denomination
[1:34:08] if he wants to condemn us we'll just go
[1:34:10] over there and join that church
[1:34:12] if they run out of that out of the
[1:34:14] church of god
[1:34:15] uh we'll go over to the assemblies and
[1:34:16] if we run out of the assemblies we'll go
[1:34:18] to the oneness and we run out of the
[1:34:19] oneness we'll go to the two nests and
[1:34:20] we'll run
[1:34:21] from the tunis and we'll go to the three
[1:34:22] nests and we got plenty of room see
[1:34:27] in other words there's a spirit on them
[1:34:29] that don't want to be subject
[1:34:37] and the attitude that the pastor just
[1:34:38] wants to condemn us
[1:34:41] it you got to recognize
[1:34:45] thoughts that come because if you don't
[1:34:48] bring them under subjection
[1:34:49] quickly they will become a part of your
[1:34:52] thinking and somewhere down the road
[1:34:53] it'll come out of your mouth talking to
[1:34:55] somebody
[1:34:58] oh yeah they'll come out like uh
[1:35:01] i don't even want to say but it'll come
[1:35:04] out in a very negative way
[1:35:08] when i and and it's not what i wanted to
[1:35:10] say is not is not wrong
[1:35:12] it's just
[1:35:15] we need to respect the house of god more
[1:35:18] and stop thinking and talking as if it's
[1:35:22] a man
[1:35:23] at the pulpit because that's the true
[1:35:26] problem
[1:35:28] if it's god we wouldn't take it lightly
[1:35:30] if we think it's god we wouldn't take it
[1:35:32] lightly
[1:35:33] we wouldn't talk about it lightly we
[1:35:35] wouldn't joke about it and laugh
[1:35:37] about it
[1:35:41] because it's
[1:35:45] because it's god's presence here he says
[1:35:48] yes you
[1:35:49] you got a room brother there's just room
[1:35:52] for christ in you
[1:35:53] if you want to come in to him oh god
[1:35:57] have mercy on the church of this day
[1:35:59] i'll stop after tonight
[1:36:00] because i don't want to make you angry
[1:36:04] brother brandon said but
[1:36:07] i just had to use these nights to drill
[1:36:12] this
[1:36:12] into you to let you know that the church
[1:36:15] is in a terrible condition
[1:36:20] you want to drill it in it certainly is
[1:36:23] our zeal
[1:36:24] we're just slothful you know just
[1:36:27] sloppy-like god don't want us to be like
[1:36:31] that
[1:36:37] so hey let's be soldiers
[1:36:41] let's be soldiers and the message
[1:36:43] questions and answers on the holy ghost
[1:36:47] brother brandon says then after a while
[1:36:48] they began to hear the bell ring
[1:36:51] church has begun to take up then they
[1:36:53] bring these messages
[1:36:55] lay them right there on the on on the
[1:36:57] desk right there
[1:36:59] where they're supposed to be laying and
[1:37:01] i'm somewhere studying and praying after
[1:37:03] a while walk
[1:37:04] out after the songs are being sung the
[1:37:07] church is all in order
[1:37:09] people coming sitting meditating praying
[1:37:12] that's what they're supposed to do not
[1:37:14] to come to the church and talk to one
[1:37:16] another
[1:37:17] come to church to talk to god
[1:37:20] have your fellowship out there see we're
[1:37:23] fellowshipping with god
[1:37:24] now and we come here talking and
[1:37:27] everything quietly
[1:37:29] reverently and the spirit moving the
[1:37:31] pianist come
[1:37:32] to the piano about five minutes before
[1:37:36] the song service starts just
[1:37:40] real sweetly
[1:37:43] down at the cross where my savior
[1:37:48] died down wherefore cleansing from
[1:37:52] sin i cried
[1:37:55] or some good sweet song real quiet
[1:37:59] it brings the presence of the holy ghost
[1:38:03] into the meeting
[1:38:05] i don't know how many times i've been in
[1:38:07] the back just
[1:38:08] you know praying praying
[1:38:12] and sister cheryl gets up here and
[1:38:15] starts
[1:38:16] playing and all of a sudden the presence
[1:38:18] of god comes over there
[1:38:21] how does that happen i've been praying
[1:38:23] for so long and i didn't feel it
[1:38:26] i never told her that i guess i should
[1:38:28] have
[1:38:30] but it's something about building the
[1:38:32] presence of of the lord
[1:38:35] and that's what what brother branham is
[1:38:37] talking about here he says now the
[1:38:38] people are sitting there some of them
[1:38:40] are real
[1:38:42] they just start weeping they come up to
[1:38:44] the altar
[1:38:45] and repent before the service ever
[1:38:48] starts
[1:38:50] that somebody brother branham calls them
[1:38:54] real people there's a realness about
[1:38:57] them
[1:38:58] they come to church for the right reason
[1:39:00] it's not just
[1:39:02] i don't know why we come to church we
[1:39:05] all come for different reasons you
[1:39:06] understand what i'm saying
[1:39:13] i've seen i've been in churches
[1:39:17] mainly mainly overseas and i'll see
[1:39:20] people come to the altar before service
[1:39:22] and just seek the lord
[1:39:28] the holy spirit's there see the churches
[1:39:30] in travail christians are praying they
[1:39:32] got their
[1:39:33] positions they're not sitting there with
[1:39:37] chewing gum saying
[1:39:38] hey liddy give me some of your lipstick
[1:39:42] i want you know you know i need you know
[1:39:45] the other day when i was down there
[1:39:47] shopping i tell you
[1:39:48] i almost stepped on your toes did i
[1:39:51] ever see such what do you think about
[1:39:54] this or that
[1:39:55] he's just expressing how people just
[1:39:57] talk about anything but god
[1:40:00] he says oh mercy and call it the house
[1:40:03] of god
[1:40:05] why it's a disgrace the body of christ
[1:40:10] coming together there we sit
[1:40:14] the man sitting by
[1:40:18] say you know when we were over there
[1:40:21] this so and so
[1:40:22] and and so and so and and that so and so
[1:40:25] that's all right outside
[1:40:29] but in here it's the house of god
[1:40:33] come in praying take your positions i'm
[1:40:36] talking now
[1:40:37] not to your churches brethren
[1:40:41] i don't know what you do i'm talking to
[1:40:44] this tabernacle
[1:40:46] i'm talking to my own back door
[1:40:49] see that's right isn't that beautiful
[1:40:57] well it's up to you
[1:41:01] i've got about
[1:41:05] uh i'm gonna say 12 minutes more for for
[1:41:09] the last one
[1:41:10] or i can stop here you tell me
[1:41:21] is that the best you can do
[1:41:26] the reason i want to get through i'm
[1:41:28] just being honest with you
[1:41:29] um i want to get through this church
[1:41:31] order just as quickly
[1:41:32] as i can there's probably nobody wants
[1:41:34] to get through it quicker than i do
[1:41:37] but i don't want to stop short of being
[1:41:40] able to
[1:41:42] to teach it right and be thorough
[1:41:46] this last subject is being on time for
[1:41:48] church
[1:41:51] being on time for church
[1:41:55] and i know it's customary for some of
[1:41:57] you to say that you've been preparing
[1:41:59] your heart at home before you get here
[1:42:03] that's fine there's nothing wrong with
[1:42:05] that but that is not the excuse to be
[1:42:08] late for church
[1:42:11] your position and your pulse of duty is
[1:42:13] here at the church a half hour before
[1:42:15] service begins
[1:42:18] and i'll tell you we have gotten so far
[1:42:20] out of order with this
[1:42:26] i don't know how many times my wife
[1:42:29] has begun to play the piano and there's
[1:42:32] one or two people in the church
[1:42:37] and it's so sad to me we have gotten out
[1:42:41] of our position
[1:42:43] we've gotten out of our our our post of
[1:42:46] duty
[1:42:46] it's like not even our duty
[1:42:50] and we've made church something
[1:42:52] different than what it is
[1:42:56] if you have an expectation that you're
[1:42:58] going to receive a god you can't wait to
[1:42:59] get there brother brian says you can't
[1:43:01] wait till the doors are open
[1:43:03] should not be hard to get there on time
[1:43:07] but if you're so filled with the world
[1:43:12] always recuperating
[1:43:15] from the night before now i know we
[1:43:17] don't
[1:43:18] we're not drunk and hungover from the
[1:43:20] night before
[1:43:21] but we can get drunk on the world and
[1:43:24] the things of the world and
[1:43:26] and we forgot about this and forgot
[1:43:28] about that how to do this and how to do
[1:43:30] that before you know it becomes a
[1:43:31] habitual habit
[1:43:35] and we have what we have today
[1:43:46] starting to prepare and pray at home or
[1:43:49] at work or in your car
[1:43:50] before you get here is perfectly in
[1:43:52] order
[1:43:56] but next we need to get to church a half
[1:43:58] hour before service begins
[1:44:01] brother john why are you saying that
[1:44:05] believe me things will be so much better
[1:44:08] here at church
[1:44:11] it will be better for church it'll be
[1:44:13] better for you
[1:44:15] it'll honor god's house more god will be
[1:44:18] more pleased with it
[1:44:23] i think brother it was brother uh mark
[1:44:26] was telling me
[1:44:27] no maybe sister ann sorry sorry
[1:44:31] but sister ann said one of them too said
[1:44:34] i don't know which one to say
[1:44:36] so i'm going to try listening to a
[1:44:37] spoken word as the original seed
[1:44:40] it's this six hour message
[1:44:50] so going a few minutes over ain't going
[1:44:52] to be that big a deal is it
[1:44:57] we'll get more out of the word the
[1:45:00] realness the spiritual
[1:45:03] of coming to church now of course if we
[1:45:04] don't come to church for those reasons
[1:45:06] then then it becomes a this becomes a
[1:45:09] law and a pain and we really don't want
[1:45:10] to do it
[1:45:12] but if you're really coming with the
[1:45:14] right motives and the right reasons
[1:45:16] this will benefit you and it'll benefit
[1:45:19] the other person
[1:45:20] sitting next to you
[1:45:24] so why what are we going to do with our
[1:45:26] half hour before we come to church
[1:45:29] if we're honest most of times when we
[1:45:31] get here we still have things hanging on
[1:45:33] us
[1:45:35] even if you spent time preparing
[1:45:40] it'll give you time to to get them out
[1:45:42] of you well brother john i
[1:45:45] i got them off before i got to church
[1:45:48] well
[1:45:49] it's still a good time to search your
[1:45:50] heart because your heart is deceitful
[1:45:53] right and there could be some things
[1:45:55] there you don't even realize
[1:45:57] it can be very very deceitful plus god
[1:46:00] has a lot of things he wants to say to
[1:46:01] us right but we can't we're not ready
[1:46:03] for it
[1:46:04] so it's all about getting ready this
[1:46:06] half hour is preparation
[1:46:09] you think about it how many hours that a
[1:46:12] minister
[1:46:13] actually spends studying for the message
[1:46:18] and we can't give a half hour
[1:46:19] preparation for it
[1:46:30] don't you think god's going to hold you
[1:46:32] accountable to that
[1:46:38] now it'd be different if we just came
[1:46:40] here and popcorn toad jokes made
[1:46:43] everybody feel good
[1:46:44] say a little something
[1:46:48] but if god is really trying to get
[1:46:51] a message across to us the least we can
[1:46:54] do is
[1:46:55] prepare for it amen
[1:46:59] thank you brothers another thing you can
[1:47:03] do
[1:47:03] is you can begin to pray for your
[1:47:05] brother and sister who needs help
[1:47:09] you can pray for the mission field for
[1:47:12] lost souls to be one
[1:47:13] to jesus your time isn't in vain
[1:47:17] you can pray for a burden to pray more
[1:47:22] we need to get to church a half hour
[1:47:23] early
[1:47:25] if anybody wonders because my wife is
[1:47:28] probably one of the most faithful
[1:47:32] come to church and uh
[1:47:36] and i know sickness has really hindered
[1:47:39] her
[1:47:43] but uh i'm sure most of you notice
[1:47:47] cheryl was sitting out in her car
[1:47:50] and everybody's working through their
[1:47:53] own
[1:47:55] thoughts about how they want to deal
[1:47:57] with
[1:47:59] the covet virus we have people that are
[1:48:02] are staying at home and live streaming
[1:48:04] we have
[1:48:05] people that have stayed home a while
[1:48:07] that have come today
[1:48:09] and i respect every single person
[1:48:12] support every single person
[1:48:14] every person's got to work out their own
[1:48:15] salvation with fair trade i think you
[1:48:17] know we shouldn't be telling other
[1:48:18] people how to deal with covet
[1:48:22] i think we should just let believe that
[1:48:24] god is able to lead and guide us
[1:48:26] amen but but she's out there half hour
[1:48:29] before service starts for sure and she's
[1:48:31] preparing before she comes in here
[1:48:34] just the same as when she's in here
[1:48:38] preparation is important brother branham
[1:48:41] said in the message
[1:48:45] experiences he says don't be late at
[1:48:47] your church
[1:48:50] you have to go to church you get right
[1:48:52] on don't
[1:48:53] miss your church now
[1:48:57] brother branham said in the message
[1:48:58] experiences
[1:49:00] at the same time later in the message
[1:49:02] sorry
[1:49:03] he says don't never miss going to church
[1:49:06] on sunday or
[1:49:10] for your prayer meeting
[1:49:15] and you people who have little churches
[1:49:18] here
[1:49:18] that's us who's struggling that's us
[1:49:23] my advice would be for you to stand at
[1:49:26] your post of duty just as
[1:49:28] loyal as you can to the cause of christ
[1:49:33] back up your minister and everything
[1:49:36] that's going on for the cause of christ
[1:49:39] and do that and god will bless you
[1:49:42] the only way that you can respect god is
[1:49:45] to respect one another
[1:49:48] i'll say saints we've got so many
[1:49:51] excuses for missing church
[1:49:55] i'm just going to say it like this you
[1:49:57] do not have a revelation
[1:50:02] you don't know your position
[1:50:07] if you're not going to be at your post
[1:50:09] of duty how do you expect god just to
[1:50:11] grab you on rapture mourning
[1:50:14] every chance you have to come here to
[1:50:17] church and be on time and be at your
[1:50:19] post of duty
[1:50:20] is is actually you know who has a
[1:50:23] revelation of
[1:50:24] of their post of duty it's the person
[1:50:26] who's here all the time
[1:50:28] it's the person who's faithful all the
[1:50:30] time
[1:50:32] they have a revelation the people that
[1:50:35] are not here at their posted duty all
[1:50:37] the time
[1:50:38] are the people who have excuses all the
[1:50:40] time
[1:50:41] ain't no different with paying your
[1:50:44] tithes
[1:50:47] it's no different with anything how do
[1:50:50] you know you got a revelation you
[1:50:51] manifest it
[1:51:00] we all have heard we need a revelation
[1:51:01] of our pastor right why is that so we're
[1:51:03] not listening to 15 different pastors
[1:51:05] trying to get what we want
[1:51:07] looking for what we want
[1:51:11] well we need a revelation of being
[1:51:14] at our post not just say well i know i
[1:51:18] belong to this church
[1:51:20] and when i can make it i'll be here
[1:51:23] now of course i am not saying this i'm
[1:51:25] just real real clear
[1:51:26] i'm not saying this because of our
[1:51:30] sister joyce or sister kelly i didn't
[1:51:33] know they were going to be here you just
[1:51:34] happen to plop in right
[1:51:36] down the middle of church order
[1:51:40] but i'm speaking to those who faithfully
[1:51:43] come here
[1:51:45] i read i'm speaking to the whole church
[1:51:46] but
[1:51:48] we need to be here it shows god i
[1:51:51] reverence you i respect you
[1:51:53] i respect my position in christ with you
[1:51:55] i respect being in my post of duty with
[1:51:58] you
[1:52:01] don't make this your carnal
[1:52:03] denominational church
[1:52:05] that you want to come when you want to
[1:52:06] come and have an excuse when you don't
[1:52:08] want to
[1:52:08] it's a shame it's a disrespect
[1:52:12] every time you're not here
[1:52:16] i understand if you're in the bathroom
[1:52:18] and you're throwing up and you can't
[1:52:19] make it
[1:52:20] i understand
[1:52:24] but if i use a work excuse every time
[1:52:29] and i've got more work excuses than
[1:52:31] anybody
[1:52:35] in fact from the get-go i think it was
[1:52:37] ann telling me who told me this
[1:52:39] now i understand why brother johnson
[1:52:42] said if you want to
[1:52:44] get anything done always give it to the
[1:52:46] person who's the busiest
[1:52:49] because they'll find a way to get it
[1:52:51] done
[1:52:55] but you know what god don't take excuses
[1:53:00] you may want to dish them out carnally
[1:53:02] but god don't take them i just say it
[1:53:04] like this
[1:53:05] you need to pray about the revelation
[1:53:06] you think you have
[1:53:09] about being at your post of duty every
[1:53:11] time the door is open because that's
[1:53:13] what the prophet said
[1:53:15] amen and i'm just saying what the word
[1:53:19] says
[1:53:19] i'm not trying to create something
[1:53:21] different than the prophet created
[1:53:22] i'm not trying to create my own colony
[1:53:24] or my own way of thinking or my own
[1:53:27] view on the message i'm just trying to
[1:53:29] echo what the prophet said
[1:53:33] in the message why brother branham said
[1:53:36] now
[1:53:36] you're here you here that have
[1:53:40] churches that you go to we wouldn't want
[1:53:43] you to miss
[1:53:44] your own service you stand at your post
[1:53:48] of duty
[1:53:49] always when your church has services why
[1:53:53] you're here locally
[1:53:55] why it's your place to stay
[1:53:58] at your church in the message last
[1:54:01] last quote the way of a true prophet
[1:54:04] says so now
[1:54:05] if you if you have had to miss work
[1:54:10] i want to read this good so now if you
[1:54:13] have had if you've had to miss work
[1:54:18] to hear to be here with us and pray with
[1:54:21] us and so forth
[1:54:23] you have to miss work he said that's all
[1:54:25] right
[1:54:28] he says you just go ahead and miss work
[1:54:31] he says but don't you miss church
[1:54:35] now what more do you want me to read
[1:54:38] for you to have a revelation of what god
[1:54:40] is requiring
[1:54:42] the thing is brother sister i have tried
[1:54:45] so hard
[1:54:45] to tell you all along what to be doing
[1:54:48] and you still
[1:54:49] refuse to line up
[1:54:54] don't you see we're all responsible for
[1:54:56] the for the atmosphere here
[1:54:58] and keeping god's house the way it's
[1:55:00] supposed to be
[1:55:01] we don't want a private revelation or
[1:55:04] private interpretation
[1:55:05] of what we think holiness is or what the
[1:55:07] church needs to be
[1:55:09] we need to keep it what the prophet
[1:55:11] taught us
[1:55:13] not just an internal belief but living
[1:55:16] the word out showing it with your life
[1:55:19] showing it with your faithfulness
[1:55:23] anybody can come when they want when it
[1:55:25] works into their own
[1:55:30] schedule
[1:55:32] but to do it when you don't feel like
[1:55:34] doing it
[1:55:35] to doing it we got other things that are
[1:55:37] really important
[1:55:40] i'm so glad the prophet said you can
[1:55:42] miss work
[1:55:44] but you don't miss church
[1:55:48] set a priority
[1:55:51] well brother john he don't that's the
[1:55:54] problem
[1:55:56] cast down all reasoning everything that
[1:55:59] exalts itself
[1:56:01] against this message
[1:56:05] don't he says don't miss church don't
[1:56:08] miss
[1:56:08] church i i won't make you late enough to
[1:56:11] miss church but if you
[1:56:14] do have to miss work once in a while he
[1:56:17] says that won't hurt
[1:56:19] how many times do we mister or miss work
[1:56:21] for something we want to do
[1:56:24] right come on
[1:56:30] we should have that same hunger for
[1:56:32] wanting to be in god's house
[1:56:33] that's really what's missing it's your
[1:56:35] relationship with god that's lacking
[1:56:41] now because work that's just your daily
[1:56:44] bread
[1:56:46] and the lord promised to provide that so
[1:56:48] this you must really be sure
[1:56:50] you come to church you see amen let's
[1:56:53] stand together
[1:56:55] we must make sure that we come to church
[1:57:01] by by doing these things the cell phone
[1:57:03] the church the talking
[1:57:04] what we're doing by just coming to
[1:57:07] church and being on time being at your
[1:57:10] post of duty praying
[1:57:12] you know what you're doing you're
[1:57:13] reverending god
[1:57:16] you're getting things in order
[1:57:21] well what if church hasn't been doing as
[1:57:25] good because
[1:57:25] you haven't been here because you
[1:57:28] haven't been here a half hour to pray
[1:57:31] because you're so busy with your life
[1:57:34] well
[1:57:34] i'm doing the most important thing i'm
[1:57:36] barely that's good
[1:57:38] that's good but this is better
[1:57:41] this is god we just read god's perfect
[1:57:50] will
[1:57:53] it's about behaving ourself
[1:57:56] not being here at church when you should
[1:57:58] be here
[1:57:59] is not behaving yourself in the church
[1:58:01] of god
[1:58:04] didn't brother johnson used to tell us
[1:58:08] if somebody wasn't here and they didn't
[1:58:10] hear
[1:58:11] the word preached they were still
[1:58:12] responsible for what god preached
[1:58:18] because they weren't at their post of
[1:58:19] duty
[1:58:26] i think now look about this we've all
[1:58:28] leaned towards the side of making an
[1:58:30] excuse
[1:58:32] not to be a church why don't we lean to
[1:58:36] the other side
[1:58:38] what do you mean a half hour i'm getting
[1:58:40] here 45 minutes early
[1:58:43] i'm i really want to pray for my
[1:58:45] brothers i really want to see the
[1:58:47] presence of god
[1:58:48] move what about lean to the other side
[1:58:50] what's what what's wrong with it
[1:58:52] if we excuse the one side why can't we
[1:58:55] ex
[1:58:59] we're showing where we're at with god
[1:59:05] i want you to take these words take this
[1:59:08] message
[1:59:10] become more serious with the lord
[1:59:14] apply it don't just
[1:59:18] have a hard heart excuses
[1:59:23] unharden that heart let the tears begin
[1:59:26] to roll
[1:59:27] let your yourself lord i've come short
[1:59:31] i want to start honoring your house
[1:59:33] don't tell me you're honoring god and
[1:59:35] you're not honoring this word
[1:59:36] you're not honoring this message that
[1:59:38] don't work
[1:59:40] it's it's a wrong spirit
[1:59:45] we honor god by honoring the word
[1:59:50] and this is your chance to step up
[1:59:54] not only to your post of duty but to
[1:59:57] your
[1:59:58] position in christ where you can be a
[2:00:00] lighthouse for somebody in this church
[2:00:03] you can be an example for somebody in
[2:00:05] this church
[2:00:06] you can be someone that people look to
[2:00:09] and say
[2:00:10] this is the way i thought i need to act
[2:00:12] this is the way i needed to be
[2:00:14] i need to be faithful i need to do this
[2:00:16] i i need to do that if i was
[2:00:18] if look
[2:00:21] i think when i met her i had a long hair
[2:00:27] and i wasn't quite as as
[2:00:30] long as sister amanda's but definitely
[2:00:32] wasn't as long as
[2:00:34] citrutricious but it was long
[2:00:38] and i had to cut it and i
[2:00:42] looked like a girl and i didn't know i
[2:00:43] thought it was a cool guy
[2:00:49] and she had to get her friend and said
[2:00:52] is that
[2:00:54] no that's good
[2:00:58] imagine me coming to the pulpit every
[2:00:59] day with long hair
[2:01:02] this was the example i'm going to set
[2:01:04] for you
[2:01:07] don't you see how that would affect you
[2:01:13] it wouldn't make the guys the brothers
[2:01:15] the guys would make the brothers want to
[2:01:17] cut their hair
[2:01:19] is that true okay what about you and
[2:01:22] your example
[2:01:23] why do you belittle that why doesn't it
[2:01:25] mean anything to you
[2:01:26] this is your chance to serve god in his
[2:01:29] house
[2:01:30] what an honor it would be to serve in
[2:01:32] the house of god
[2:01:36] i thoroughly thoroughly enjoy
[2:01:40] love doing everything except preaching
[2:01:44] when it comes to working for the lord
[2:01:50] but to stare at faces that i know the
[2:01:53] flesh is not happy with me i know that
[2:01:59] i'll work on my personal relationship
[2:02:01] with you outside here
[2:02:05] but this is what the lord wants and i
[2:02:07] want you to work with me okay
[2:02:09] amen let's bound the word of prayer
[2:02:14] lord we could ask today for a show of
[2:02:16] hands those
[2:02:18] that perhaps
[2:02:22] need to fit into these quotes that we've
[2:02:25] read today
[2:02:26] to be more in church order and every
[2:02:29] hand would be lifted
[2:02:31] lord you see that already you know that
[2:02:38] lord we're asking today that you would
[2:02:40] look in our hearts
[2:02:42] for this strong desire that we have to
[2:02:46] be back in order
[2:02:48] as we move forward here lord we don't
[2:02:50] want to forget these things
[2:02:53] we don't want to let them become
[2:02:56] secondary or or talk light about them
[2:03:02] or to think light about them but lord
[2:03:06] we're asking today that you take this
[2:03:08] word this
[2:03:09] so many of these uh things that we've
[2:03:12] said we're right from the message
[2:03:15] that your prophet taught
[2:03:18] lord we're asking that you'd engrave
[2:03:19] them upon our hearts today
[2:03:23] lord that we wouldn't have to be
[2:03:25] reminded but that literally we could
[2:03:27] become
[2:03:28] written epistles that when people see
[2:03:31] our life
[2:03:32] they would see that it's written on our
[2:03:34] heart it's written
[2:03:36] in our life in our faithfulness here at
[2:03:38] church and how we behave ourself
[2:03:40] in your house lord i pray for every
[2:03:43] brother and every sister here
[2:03:44] lord for those that are live streaming
[2:03:46] perhaps those that will listen
[2:03:48] in the future i pray lord there's that
[2:03:51] desire inside of them to walk
[2:03:53] in this truth and this message lord that
[2:03:56] you'd give them
[2:03:57] the um that measure of grace
[2:04:00] lord that all sufficient grace to
[2:04:04] to please you because lord
[2:04:07] this is what you want
[2:04:13] when we read the scriptures when we read
[2:04:16] that paul taught this
[2:04:17] same thing in all churches
[2:04:21] it wasn't just one church
[2:04:24] but he taught the word of god in all
[2:04:26] churches
[2:04:27] and brother branham said this is not for
[2:04:29] anybody's church but for my church
[2:04:31] what he was really saying there is that
[2:04:33] i'm responsible for my church and that
[2:04:35] the
[2:04:36] other believers that were there in that
[2:04:38] service
[2:04:39] they couldn't speak for their pastor
[2:04:45] lord may it be so of our church
[2:04:48] may it reflect the message of the hour
[2:04:53] the message that the prophet gave
[2:04:58] may we still be that shining light may
[2:05:00] we be that
[2:05:01] lighthouse when other uh believers come
[2:05:04] from other churches and
[2:05:06] and lord when other sinners come
[2:05:09] into this church and the next church
[2:05:11] that we're going to have
[2:05:12] lord that they would they would feel the
[2:05:14] presence of god
[2:05:15] and want to seek you lord and want to
[2:05:18] open their hearts and
[2:05:19] lord let the tears begin to roll
[2:05:24] you squeeze their hearts lord
[2:05:27] father we need you in this hour i pray
[2:05:29] that the all the holy spirit would just
[2:05:31] come
[2:05:32] now and soothe every heart touch every
[2:05:35] mind may there be no one offended
[2:05:38] no one going in that direction

[2:20:08] land
[2:20:11] this is part of the promised land this
[2:20:13] is this is god this is his will this is
[2:20:15] what he wants
[2:20:17] and we have to by faith just do it
[2:20:20] and not try to reason scribulate
[2:20:24] and allow a chance for the enemy to get
[2:20:26] in there
[2:20:27] and get you off course amen is saying so
[2:20:31] be it
[2:20:32] so bad let this word be born in me

[2:20:42] with god blessing our church
[2:20:46] it has everything to do with unity this
[2:20:48] what we preach today
[2:20:50] propagates unity real unity
[2:20:53] not well i like brother ron more than
[2:20:56] brother mark because
[2:20:58] i'm talking about i do not like
[2:21:01] brother ron in the flesh more than i
[2:21:03] like
[2:21:04] uh brother mark but i respect brother
[2:21:09] iran just as much as i do brother mark
[2:21:15] they're equal and
[2:21:18] that's what this message will do for our
[2:21:20] church
[2:21:22] there's so much more to it than what we
[2:21:24] see and that's why we need to stay laser
[2:21:26] focused
[2:21:26] on just following through with it and
