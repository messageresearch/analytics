[39:06] in the lives of people you know
[39:09] we don't know I myself don't know why
[39:13] the kobit was sent in you know you know
[39:16] it was on a purpose and you know the
[39:19] vaccinations and all those things I
[39:22] don't understand all those things but I
[39:24] truly believe that all these sciences
[39:26] and all these inventions and all these
[39:29] uh things are for the downfall of the
[39:32] human beings you know
[39:33] but there is one thing about the Lord
[39:35] that the devil wants us to fall down but
[39:39] the Lord wants us to rise up
[39:42] and we are living in such a great time
[39:45] that we need to Rise Up from our
[39:47] situations no matter whatever we are
[39:50] going through in our life
[39:52] it's time to get up and Rise you know
[39:56] the Bible clearly says Rise and Shine
[39:59] for the light has come
[40:01] so I'm so thankful to God to serve the
[40:04] Lord in the nation of India thank you
[40:06] brother John and the whole church and
[40:09] the family
[40:10] for your love your prayers and for your
[40:13] sacrifices from time to time
[40:16] the Lord has been good you know
[40:18] the more persecution the more pressure
[40:21] you know as it was in the olden days of
[40:24] the Bible you know
[40:26] how much persecution that much people
[40:29] are accepting Jesus Christ in that
[40:32] country of India you know
[40:34] sometimes we think that oh what will
[40:36] happen if persecution comes you know
[40:39] but I think we as Believers we as the
[40:42] children of the most high God we don't
[40:44] have to worry about persecution you know
[40:46] you know
[40:48] those days during the time of Apostles
[40:50] you know during the times of you know
[40:52] the disciples the people the Believers
[40:56] being killed you know
[40:58] thrown into the lion's den
[41:02] we see how they sang songs and how they
[41:06] you know gladly you know they gave their
[41:09] lives to Christ you know amen and we
[41:12] should come to that point no matter we
[41:14] are persecuted but we are not forsaken
[41:17] we are tried everyone is tried here
[41:20] everyone is going through so many issues
[41:24] in life you know
[41:25] you ask anyone here and if anybody can
[41:28] say I am not having any trouble
[41:32] that means something is wrong with you
[41:35] because you are abnormal
[41:39] but if you have trouble that means the
[41:42] Lord is with you you know
[41:44] you know I understand that we make
[41:46] mistakes in our life we have so many you
[41:49] know things which tries to come against
[41:51] us because of the hasty decisions we
[41:54] have taken in our life you know
[41:56] the mistakes we make
[41:58] but no I truly believe you know
[42:01] he has finished just before we came
[42:03] brother John finished you know we are
[42:05] the finished work of God you know
[42:09] he was exalting in the end you know
[42:11] that's true
[42:13] I want to see weakness in my brother's
[42:15] life you know I want to see the flaws
[42:18] and the mistakes you make you want to
[42:21] see what mistakes and what you know what
[42:24] weaker things I have in life you know we
[42:27] are human beings but God doesn't look at
[42:29] us like that
[42:31] he always looks at us as a finished work
[42:34] we are not the byproduct we are the
[42:38] finished product of God
[42:41] why because we are saved by his blood
[42:44] you know
[42:46] he said it is finished you know amen and
[42:49] what the devil wants today is we should
[42:51] fall we should not you know
[42:53] he wants us to paralyze
[42:55] but a person filled with the Holy Spirit
[42:58] you know
[42:59] the person who has you know word in his
[43:03] life
[43:04] no matter how many circumstances how
[43:07] many situations he has to face or she
[43:10] has to face we will stand up
[43:13] amen
[43:15] and will try to move forward
[43:19] the problem today is you know many
[43:22] people are different drifting away you
[43:24] know
[43:25] from this precious word
[43:28] many people are trying to go you know
[43:30] separate themselves
[43:34] from the message of the hour they are
[43:37] trying to you know go away from the
[43:40] presence of God you know
[43:43] they don't want to come to the church
[43:44] they don't want to be in Fellowship they
[43:46] don't want to listen to the word of God
[43:48] you know
[43:50] many people I'm not talking about others
[43:53] but many of the people we know
[43:57] and I have seen in my life we have
[43:59] learned the art of doing nothing
[44:03] you know
[44:05] that's true we have learned the art of
[44:09] doing nothing because you you count on
[44:12] anyone you you touch anybody you talk to
[44:14] anybody all you can say is oh brother
[44:17] I'm busy
[44:19] sister I'm busy busy for what busy for
[44:22] nothing
[44:24] we have learned The Art of Doing Nothing
[44:31] man is trying to you know drift away
[44:34] from the word of God you know
[44:36] you know but thank the Lord for his word
[44:38] the person who has got word in his life
[44:42] who knows what the revelation of Jesus
[44:45] Christ is will never Drift Away
[44:49] at the end of our destination we are in
[44:51] a journey
[44:53] we are just passerby we are just
[44:56] sojourning in this land
[45:00] this world is not our home
[45:03] we are just passing through Heaven is
[45:05] our home and we have a reward waiting
[45:08] for us you know
[45:12] and the message of the hour it says that
[45:15] one day we are going to meet him either
[45:18] as a masterpiece
[45:22] or as a drifting word drifting on water
[45:26] doesn't know where its destination is
[45:30] if we are
[45:32] thirsting after God if we are longing
[45:36] for God and God's presence
[45:40] I don't say we will not fail we will not
[45:43] fall you know
[45:46] we are humans we have weaknesses in our
[45:48] life we do mistakes you know but I truly
[45:52] believe that no matter how far a person
[45:54] goes there is a point there is a time
[45:57] there is an appointed time in his life
[45:59] that that person has to make a u-turn
[46:05] and if a person cannot realize that he
[46:09] has to come back make a U-turn come back
[46:13] where he started from
[46:16] that's not human
[46:21] that's why many people come to me
[46:24] and he said brother my daughter is gone
[46:26] into the world my son is gone into the
[46:28] world
[46:30] and I always tell them don't worry
[46:34] maybe they are thirsting now after
[46:35] something else
[46:38] that's the devil you know
[46:41] God always wants us to thirst after him
[46:45] and thirst is a painful desire
[46:49] it's painful when you want something so
[46:51] bad until it becomes painful to you you
[46:54] long for it
[46:56] man whether it is the word or the things
[46:59] of the world
[47:02] everything is linked to The Thirst if
[47:05] you are thirsty after God you will be in
[47:07] the presence of God
[47:08] [Applause]
[47:13] since the Kobe detect all over the world
[47:17] most of the churches even today they are
[47:20] not gathering at all to worship God
[47:24] they still go on online
[47:27] but I want to tell you the impact of the
[47:30] Holy Spirit which is now it cannot be
[47:32] online
[47:36] God might speak to you through online
[47:39] but he does it more offline you know
[47:45] you know and today people have stopped
[47:48] going to church they have stopped
[47:51] thirsting after God they have stopped
[47:53] giving to God they will stop their
[47:55] Tidings their offerings
[47:57] they have stopped working
[48:00] serving God
[48:01] in the capacity they were once called
[48:05] why because The Thirst the longing is
[48:09] being decreased day by day
[48:12] and it's true
[48:16] and that is one of the reason you have a
[48:20] greatest enemy with you
[48:24] beside you who is that greatest enemy
[48:27] can anybody tell me
[48:29] it's a it's the it's it's it's ourselves
[48:32] but there's one more enemy
[48:35] you always carry
[48:39] that's your cell phone
[48:43] that's true
[48:47] I saw the other day you know I was just
[48:50] you know going into coming towards here
[48:54] I was in Philadelphia Airport you know
[48:57] and I saw a man he was so busy on the
[49:00] phone he fell down from the escalator
[49:05] what is happening
[49:07] the devil has occupied everybody's mind
[49:12] that's why Paul said let the mind of
[49:15] Christ be in you
[49:18] so that we will know how to use our mind
[49:22] so that we will know what to thrust
[49:25] after
[49:30] every person we are controlled by
[49:34] something
[49:36] we have a control tower
[49:40] and we need to realize today who is
[49:42] controlling us
[49:47] the control tower in the body
[49:50] and in the soul
[49:54] there's a control tower in the body that
[49:56] tells you the need that's needed in your
[49:59] body and it's brought to you by a thirst
[50:05] there is a control tower in your soul
[50:07] that tells you the spiritual things that
[50:10] you have need of something in your
[50:13] spirit and You by this can tell what
[50:16] kind of life is controlling you
[50:22] what you trust for you will go after
[50:28] and if you have passed after something
[50:30] you will do it anyhow
[50:33] whether it is pertaining to the word of
[50:36] God
[50:37] or the kingdom of God or it is
[50:39] pertaining to the things of the world
[50:42] why
[50:44] because your soul is thirsting after
[50:47] something
[50:49] but David in his life
[50:52] he had a longing he had a thirst in his
[50:56] life to see God God working in his life
[50:59] God speaking to him
[51:03] leading his life guiding his life
[51:08] and that's what we need to long for we
[51:11] need to run for the word of God today
[51:13] because this word is life
[51:16] the same David says I meditate day and
[51:21] night
[51:27] when we are thirsty
[51:31] nothing has to tell us to go to the
[51:33] Fountain of water and get
[51:36] I'll go to the refrigerator and you know
[51:38] take the bottle and drink
[51:41] nobody needs to teach you
[51:44] nobody needs to lead you and guide you
[51:46] drink water drink water no it is your
[51:49] body the control tower in your body
[51:52] physically when you are thirsty when you
[51:55] are hungry it tells you the five senses
[51:58] which God has put in US
[52:01] it will lead us
[52:04] to thirst after the things we need amen
[52:10] but the soul also has a control tower
[52:16] and the word of this hour it says that's
[52:19] the Sixth Sense
[52:20] that's the super sense that's the faith
[52:25] if we need to test after God we need to
[52:29] Faith have faith in our life
[52:32] why today people are drifting away from
[52:35] the presence of God why the pews are
[52:37] empty why people don't want to come to
[52:39] church anymore it is because of the
[52:41] unbelief and the Bible says unbelief is
[52:44] sin
[52:49] David says my soul thirsts for God
[52:53] for the Living God
[52:57] to the human beings to demand women
[53:01] we have been halted between two desires
[53:07] the flesh thirst to satisfy the desires
[53:10] that's in the body and the spirit
[53:12] desires for the things that's in the
[53:14] soul
[53:17] desire
[53:18] many times this war won against the
[53:21] other
[53:24] and you find today the great trouble
[53:27] today that too many people tried to live
[53:31] between those two desires
[53:34] for one of them the desires the things
[53:37] of the earth and for the other desires
[53:40] the things
[53:42] of Heaven
[53:46] if you are Earthly bound you will think
[53:48] about the Earthly things if you are
[53:51] Heavenly bound
[53:53] we will think about heaven all the time
[54:01] the Bible says in Jeremiah's chapter 2
[54:03] 13 and 14.
[54:06] beautiful words of God
[54:10] life-changing words he says for my
[54:12] people I've committed two evils
[54:18] they have forsaken me
[54:21] the Fountain of Living Waters and healed
[54:25] them out systems broken systems that can
[54:29] hold no water
[54:32] is Israel a servant is he a home Bond
[54:35] slave why is his spoiled
[54:41] what do we get in the broken system
[54:47] what do we get
[54:49] in the system which is not good
[54:52] all we get is wiggle tails
[54:58] all we get is stinking water
[55:03] the Lord's word the Lord says you're
[55:06] wrong after the fountain which gives you
[55:09] living water but man is wanting
[55:16] he's thirsting after those systems where
[55:19] it's wiggle Tails it's you know
[55:28] that's why you know
[55:30] David compared
[55:32] the human being he compared himself you
[55:35] know
[55:36] to the deer
[55:40] you know a good quality of of that
[55:43] animal that deer is
[55:45] when it is wounded
[55:48] the deer looks for water
[55:52] qualities
[55:54] there are many but the three qualities I
[55:56] want to say
[55:58] when it is wounded
[56:00] it looks for water
[56:04] when the enemy is near it can smell the
[56:08] enemy
[56:14] and when the enemy is trying to approach
[56:16] the deer what does the deer do it jumps
[56:20] into the water it immerses himself
[56:22] totally into the water
[56:29] it's not my words
[56:31] if that deer can't find water water has
[56:35] something in it that when the deer
[56:37] drinks the water it stops the bleeding
[56:40] amen
[56:44] see water is so important for that
[56:46] animal amen
[56:48] and for us animals yes
[56:51] yes we also need water
[56:53] we need physical water without water you
[56:55] will die in the same way we need water
[56:57] called the word of God
[57:02] when it is bleeding it needs water
[57:07] when we are wounded
[57:09] when we are lost in our battles when we
[57:12] are going down day by day weakened in
[57:14] our lives what we need instead of
[57:17] running two and four instead of running
[57:19] Pillar To Post what we need is we need
[57:22] to run to the Water of Life
[57:25] when you run to the Fountain of Living
[57:27] Waters
[57:32] why
[57:33] [Music]
[57:34] why it will stop bleeding
[57:37] it will stop you from
[57:39] damaging your lives
[57:44] look at that quality we can learn from
[57:47] that deer today
[57:49] when it sends the enemy that the enemy
[57:52] is approaching what it does it looks for
[57:55] water
[58:00] we are easily attracted today why even
[58:03] our body has a smell you know
[58:06] many people are attracted towards us
[58:08] today we are attracted towards you know
[58:11] the world
[58:13] the fashion
[58:14] the things of this world
[58:18] and the enemy is like a roaring lion
[58:22] ready to devour whomsoever he can
[58:27] what we need to do we need to find for
[58:30] what yes
[58:31] we need to jump into the water
[58:35] we cannot walk like Peter walked on the
[58:37] water
[58:39] but I can know I know we can we can
[58:41] immerse ourselves into the water
[58:46] walking on the world is not important
[58:48] walking in the word with the word is
[58:50] very important
[58:59] if the deer don't get water to cool him
[59:03] the blood keeps flowing out faster
[59:06] because he's running keeping his heart
[59:08] pumping
[59:10] but if we can ever get to that water the
[59:13] deer will live
[59:18] we find that he also has another sense
[59:20] of smell that sets off an alarm in him
[59:24] when his enemy is near
[59:28] he's possessed this little creature
[59:31] got a sense to protect himself he's got
[59:35] a little alarm in him
[59:39] thank God for that alarm
[59:41] in that deer and I want to thank God for
[59:44] that alarm in US
[59:46] what is that alarm that's the Holy
[59:48] Spirit
[59:51] and is God a little alarm in him a
[59:53] little something
[59:58] something get in the Wind of the enemy
[1:00:00] and he knows that there you are
[1:00:07] sometimes a half a mile he can smell you
[1:00:10] and get away or a wolf or any danger
[1:00:13] he's able to sense it because that he's
[1:00:16] made up that way he is a deer
[1:00:20] he's a dear by nature and that sense in
[1:00:23] him is just one that God gave him
[1:00:26] senses to him to live by those senses
[1:00:33] when the deer runs into the water
[1:00:36] the Predator can no longer detect its
[1:00:38] sense
[1:00:39] in addition to finding safety from its
[1:00:42] enemies the deer finds relief
[1:00:45] from thirst in the waters
[1:00:52] if you want your enemy not to track you
[1:00:55] down
[1:00:57] all you need is water
[1:01:00] all you need is the word of God
[1:01:04] we need to have intimacy with God when
[1:01:08] you thirst after God you will have
[1:01:09] intimacy with God
[1:01:12] and that intimacy with God is only found
[1:01:15] in this Unity of spirit
[1:01:19] Unity of faith
[1:01:22] the more you thirst the more you long
[1:01:25] and the more you seek after God God will
[1:01:28] grant your desire
[1:01:32] and that is what we need to do we need
[1:01:34] to seek after him
[1:01:40] we realize that judgment is striking
[1:01:44] Great Falls of falling in Nations
[1:01:48] shaking the earthquakes
[1:01:51] historical things that we have heard of
[1:01:53] the days passed
[1:01:56] of judgment Through the Bible we see it
[1:01:58] repeating again again today
[1:02:03] the Bible prophecy said as it was in the
[1:02:05] days of Noah
[1:02:07] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:02:09] of man as it was in the days of lot
[1:02:13] so shall it be the coming of the son of
[1:02:15] man and we see with our eyes it's
[1:02:17] happening
[1:02:21] man's Hearts filling
[1:02:25] perplexity of time distress between
[1:02:28] nations
[1:02:29] you see the war
[1:02:31] between Russia and Ukraine
[1:02:34] you see the earthquake in Turkey
[1:02:37] you see the signs and wonders science
[1:02:40] happening
[1:02:42] as fought all in the word of God of how
[1:02:45] it will be in the end time
[1:02:49] but still we are not able to realize
[1:02:52] that it's time that we need to thirst
[1:02:54] after something which can bring us close
[1:02:58] to God
[1:02:59] to test after something
[1:03:02] so that we can all be in rapture
[1:03:07] amen many times in our life God gets us
[1:03:09] in a tight Corners where we have to look
[1:03:12] up sometimes we even have to get on our
[1:03:15] back in the hospital
[1:03:17] or a bed somewhere so we can look up to
[1:03:20] see where the great blessings of God
[1:03:22] comes from
[1:03:28] the prophet of God said I thought
[1:03:30] comparing the deer with a man that's
[1:03:32] thirsting for God before the enemy gets
[1:03:35] there
[1:03:36] there is something about the children of
[1:03:39] God
[1:03:40] there is something about a child of God
[1:03:43] that when you once are born into the
[1:03:45] spirit of God
[1:03:49] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:51] there is something about that person
[1:03:53] that can sense the enemy
[1:03:57] you can take a man when he's taking the
[1:04:00] scripture reading the scripture and
[1:04:03] trying to inject something to that
[1:04:04] scripture that's contrary to the
[1:04:07] scripture a man that's filled with the
[1:04:09] Holy Ghost can sense that right quick
[1:04:11] there is something out of the way when
[1:04:14] he gets into a place
[1:04:16] and that little certain sense in there
[1:04:19] that is done to protect your life
[1:04:25] you mustn't you must never go for
[1:04:27] anything unless it's exactly the word of
[1:04:30] God
[1:04:32] we must stay right exactly with the word
[1:04:35] of God
[1:04:36] we are secured with that sense as long
[1:04:40] as we are in the Holy Spirit
[1:04:44] what we need is not to be ruled by the
[1:04:47] five senses it's important but we need a
[1:04:50] super sense we need the Sixth Sense
[1:04:53] that's God's provided way for us
[1:04:58] so that we can thirst more and more
[1:05:01] after the Living God
[1:05:05] example in the Bible Samson
[1:05:10] we all know the story
[1:05:13] it costed him he had to pay a price
[1:05:17] because of The Thirst the desire he had
[1:05:23] but when Jesus was upon the Earth there
[1:05:25] was another woman who touched it after
[1:05:27] something else but came to that well
[1:05:30] uh
[1:05:33] thank God when she knew that the
[1:05:36] Fountain of Living Water was just
[1:05:38] standing right in front of her what she
[1:05:41] said what she confessed he said give me
[1:05:44] the water that I will never thirst again
[1:05:50] we should discern the time we are living
[1:05:53] in we should discern the day we are in
[1:05:55] today
[1:06:00] Sunday after Sunday
[1:06:02] service after service God is speaking to
[1:06:05] us
[1:06:13] we need more women
[1:06:15] as it was in the day of Jesus Christ who
[1:06:18] was at the well
[1:06:20] who can say I don't want to thirst after
[1:06:22] this world
[1:06:26] I am fed up
[1:06:32] involved the world is rationing day by
[1:06:35] day
[1:06:38] the one system the government system
[1:06:42] yes
[1:06:45] the whole creation is groaning
[1:06:49] come quickly O Lord
[1:06:53] if you thirst after God if you know that
[1:06:55] we are Heaven bound we will also pray
[1:06:57] that same prayer
[1:06:59] come quickly O Lord
[1:07:06] you would say brother boys that means we
[1:07:07] stop everything no
[1:07:13] you need to work you need to on
[1:07:16] you are the breadwinner
[1:07:19] it's important
[1:07:21] but everything has time
[1:07:24] everything has a season
[1:07:29] there is time to work there is time to
[1:07:31] play
[1:07:35] but what we have seen is even people
[1:07:37] today they are playing in the church
[1:07:41] playing with God
[1:07:44] we can't this is not the time to play
[1:07:46] with God
[1:07:49] the prophet of God said there are people
[1:07:51] still playing
[1:07:54] in the outer Court
[1:07:58] it's not the time to play in the outer
[1:08:01] Court we need to step into the holy of
[1:08:03] holies we need to step into the presence
[1:08:06] of God we need to thrust up to the
[1:08:08] presence of God we need to long after
[1:08:10] his presence
[1:08:12] my brothers my sister when you when you
[1:08:15] go into that presence of God you need to
[1:08:17] shut the whole world behind you
[1:08:23] you can't say I want the world and I
[1:08:26] want the word
[1:08:28] this too doesn't go parallel
[1:08:34] what we need today is to walk in the
[1:08:37] middle of the road
[1:08:40] don't go far right
[1:08:42] you will be starchy
[1:08:44] don't go far left you will be worldly
[1:08:48] what we need to do is walk in the middle
[1:08:50] of the road
[1:08:51] the start of the Living God
[1:08:56] this is the highway this is the gods
[1:08:58] provided way it's a King's Highway
[1:09:02] he said I am the door
[1:09:06] I am the way the truth and the life
[1:09:15] what are we testing
[1:09:17] after
[1:09:19] what is our desire today
[1:09:23] we need to check it
[1:09:27] we need to check our desires
[1:09:32] and if there's anything which is driving
[1:09:34] you away from the presence of God
[1:09:38] I think we need to
[1:09:40] you know
[1:09:42] ask the Lord
[1:09:44] so that he can take away that desire
[1:09:47] that's why the word of God says love not
[1:09:50] the world for the things of the world
[1:09:54] what is in the world the lust of Flesh
[1:09:56] the lust of the eyes the pride of life
[1:10:01] everything is going to pass away
[1:10:04] Heaven and Earth is going to pass away
[1:10:06] but one thing which is not going to pass
[1:10:09] away it's the word of God
[1:10:12] it's our Lord Jesus Christ the same
[1:10:14] yesterday today and forever
[1:10:18] what we need to do then
[1:10:22] play with God no
[1:10:24] first up to the wall no sir
[1:10:28] what we need to do is Rise Up
[1:10:33] judge rise up
[1:10:41] desperations
[1:10:42] you can't be desperate till God speaks
[1:10:45] to you oh Church rise up and shake up
[1:10:48] yourself
[1:10:49] pinch your conscience wake yourself up
[1:10:52] in this hour
[1:10:54] not tomorrow
[1:10:58] not after a week now
[1:11:04] we must be desperate or perish
[1:11:08] that is coming forth something from the
[1:11:11] Lord I know it is the Lord that is
[1:11:14] coming forth something that we better
[1:11:16] get desperate it's between life and
[1:11:18] death it will pass through us we won't
[1:11:21] even see
[1:11:31] meet God
[1:11:34] when he wants to meet you
[1:11:38] get a touch from him when he wants to
[1:11:41] touch you
[1:11:43] he doesn't go by our our timing
[1:11:47] we have to go by his timing
[1:11:52] Mercy is given Mercy is given
[1:11:55] but if you don't pay attention that
[1:11:58] Mercy will be given to somebody else
[1:12:06] I really liked it it got goosebumps on
[1:12:09] my body you know when I Was preparing
[1:12:13] pinch up your conscience
[1:12:17] stop dreaming
[1:12:19] [Music]
[1:12:26] it's between life and death
[1:12:29] it will pass through us and we won't
[1:12:32] even see it
[1:12:34] my brothers my sisters
[1:12:38] we need to thirst after God
[1:12:41] we need to do what we can do to please
[1:12:44] him
[1:12:46] as a husband tries his best to take care
[1:12:50] of his family and his wife and please
[1:12:52] her in any way
[1:12:56] so are we need to do
[1:12:58] as the wife pleases her husband so are
[1:13:01] we
[1:13:03] we need to please our husband we need to
[1:13:05] make him happy
[1:13:07] we need to thirst after him we need to
[1:13:09] serve him we need to love him
[1:13:13] he would say brother what can I give to
[1:13:15] God
[1:13:19] I want to say God wants everything from
[1:13:21] you
[1:13:24] if you question me if you ask me a
[1:13:26] question what can I give to God this is
[1:13:29] the answer
[1:13:32] what can you give
[1:13:34] and if you want to give you we want you
[1:13:36] have to give it all
[1:13:39] God will receive it
[1:13:43] God will surely receive what you will
[1:13:45] give
[1:13:47] but God there is a condition he wants it
[1:13:50] all
[1:13:51] he wants every bit of you he wants it
[1:13:54] all he wants everything you are he wants
[1:13:56] your life
[1:13:58] he wants your testimony he wants every
[1:14:01] minute you live he wants you to live
[1:14:03] right act right talk right do right
[1:14:08] he wants everything perfectly
[1:14:10] surrendered to him
[1:14:13] why so that he can lead you and guide
[1:14:16] you
[1:14:18] and put you in a place
[1:14:22] where I want to be
[1:14:26] no
[1:14:28] he wants to lead you and guide you and
[1:14:32] totally surrendered so that he can take
[1:14:35] you and put you in a place where he
[1:14:38] wants you to be
[1:14:42] but human beings we want to be where we
[1:14:45] want to be
[1:14:47] we want to do what we want to do
[1:14:50] that's why we are in trouble today
[1:14:57] the prophet of God said you have to have
[1:14:59] the oil in your Lambs yes
[1:15:07] we need to thirst after God
[1:15:11] as I told you my brothers my sisters I
[1:15:14] can see
[1:15:15] a lot of hunger
[1:15:18] in many people in India
[1:15:21] they are thrusting after this word they
[1:15:23] are thirsting after God they are coming
[1:15:25] into the light of this message they are
[1:15:27] coming closer day by day the more they
[1:15:30] are in trouble they have been pressured
[1:15:38] three and a half months ago a pastor
[1:15:41] they got him down from a prayer meeting
[1:15:43] and they cut his tongue
[1:15:47] because he was preaching this gospel
[1:15:51] many many facts many truths it's not
[1:15:55] coming to the outside world
[1:15:59] many preachers many ministers are being
[1:16:02] stoned to death
[1:16:04] churches are being vandalized
[1:16:09] but what I have seen that fire is
[1:16:13] burning more and more yes
[1:16:16] the more pressure the more fire in their
[1:16:19] lives
[1:16:21] because they know
[1:16:24] if they can only trust after God
[1:16:28] and his word
[1:16:30] even though they are tried even though
[1:16:33] they are in trouble even though they are
[1:16:35] persecuted
[1:16:37] they know that they will not be forsaken
[1:16:45] if you can look into the life of Job
[1:16:52] in job 23 2 and 3.
[1:16:55] I really like that verse
[1:16:58] job is in the heap of Ash
[1:17:01] thank you
[1:17:04] troubled on every side
[1:17:07] don't know what to do
[1:17:10] looking for you know God can you know
[1:17:14] help him
[1:17:16] but look at his desire you know as we
[1:17:19] read job 23 2 and 3.
[1:17:22] it says even today is my complaint
[1:17:25] bitter
[1:17:27] my stroke is heavier than my groaning
[1:17:32] look at this next line he says oh that I
[1:17:35] knew where I might find him
[1:17:39] that I might come even to his seat
[1:17:46] where is he
[1:17:48] he's on the Heap of Ashes
[1:17:51] he's in trouble
[1:17:55] but look what he says I want to see
[1:17:58] where he is so that I can knock at his
[1:18:01] door
[1:18:04] to see Jesus
[1:18:06] 54.
[1:18:08] he says if I only knew where he lived
[1:18:11] and I could go up and knock on his door
[1:18:13] or something on that manner and have a
[1:18:16] conversation with him
[1:18:19] why you come into the presence of God to
[1:18:23] talk to him
[1:18:27] why you come into the presence of God so
[1:18:30] that he can talk to you
[1:18:32] amen
[1:18:33] look at the desire of that man
[1:18:36] his friends came
[1:18:39] and they said you are a secret sinner
[1:18:42] and because of that all these things are
[1:18:45] happening in your life
[1:18:47] wife on the other hand says why don't
[1:18:50] you curse God and die
[1:18:55] but look at his desire
[1:18:59] if I only knew where he lived I could go
[1:19:03] up and knock on his door
[1:19:07] and have conversation with him
[1:19:12] God answered his prayer
[1:19:16] but in a different way you know God
[1:19:17] answered him he said job got up your
[1:19:19] loins for I am going to speak to you
[1:19:25] and God came down in the form of a
[1:19:27] whirlwind
[1:19:28] he says Where Were You job when I was
[1:19:30] laying the foundation
[1:19:38] by this
[1:19:40] by the coming of the Lord
[1:19:43] speaking to him face to face
[1:19:48] he got so much of peace
[1:19:52] he came to a point brother that he said
[1:19:55] even though the worms
[1:19:59] slain
[1:20:01] or even if I'm dead
[1:20:04] even if I'm rotten
[1:20:07] I will serve God
[1:20:12] that should be the desire today that
[1:20:14] should be The Thirst today
[1:20:16] no matter what may come or go no matter
[1:20:18] what happens to us
[1:20:21] if you are it's a battle with sicknesses
[1:20:23] praise the Lord
[1:20:27] if your doctor says you are going to die
[1:20:29] praise the Lord
[1:20:33] we need to walk with God Walk In The
[1:20:37] Light
[1:20:38] not only send the light we need to walk
[1:20:40] in the light
[1:20:44] we need to walk with him
[1:20:46] walk unconscious of criticism walk
[1:20:49] unconscious of fear walk unconscious of
[1:20:52] this world walk as you walk in Christ
[1:20:56] if the doctor say you are dying walk
[1:20:58] with Christ walk with God
[1:21:03] if your neighbor doesn't like you
[1:21:06] walk with God
[1:21:12] yourself up
[1:21:14] got up your loins judge
[1:21:16] this is the time we need to cut up our
[1:21:19] loins
[1:21:22] have your own armor
[1:21:24] which God has given to us
[1:21:30] the helmet of salvation the breastplate
[1:21:33] of righteousness
[1:21:36] the belt called Truth
[1:21:38] the sword of the spirit and the shield
[1:21:41] of faith
[1:21:45] and don't forget to wear the shoes you
[1:21:47] need it
[1:21:49] because you need to run in this race
[1:21:54] this race is set in front of us
[1:21:58] if you thirst after that price
[1:22:00] you will run in that race
[1:22:05] there are many who are running but only
[1:22:07] one gets the price
[1:22:10] we had a wonderful time in the men's
[1:22:12] meeting you know
[1:22:14] where Paul says you know
[1:22:17] so many beautiful things
[1:22:22] my brothers my sisters
[1:22:25] we need to steadfast we need to
[1:22:28] you know we need to be unmovable in our
[1:22:32] faith
[1:22:37] to see Jesus 54 again
[1:22:40] he says the way it is tonight those who
[1:22:43] desire to see God must come with a
[1:22:46] perfect heart with all strange feelings
[1:22:49] set aside
[1:22:50] with all my lives towards their neighbor
[1:22:52] set aside with all my lives towards
[1:22:55] other churches other individuals and
[1:22:58] forms of worship you must come with a
[1:23:00] perfect heart
[1:23:04] and he says if I I believe that you come
[1:23:06] with that kind of an intention that God
[1:23:09] is under obligation to reveal himself to
[1:23:11] you
[1:23:12] don't you believe that
[1:23:14] that God is under obligation to reveal
[1:23:17] himself to you here
[1:23:21] that's why we need to thirst after God
[1:23:26] that's why we need to thirst after
[1:23:28] the word of God this word is precious
[1:23:31] amen nothing can match this word
[1:23:36] no matter how much we try to go astray
[1:23:40] go away from this word remember
[1:23:43] if you don't make a U-turn if you don't
[1:23:45] know
[1:23:46] how to come back
[1:23:48] God knows how to bring you back
[1:23:52] he will take you to a tight corner
[1:23:56] and it will bring in such a
[1:23:59] situation in your life that you will
[1:24:01] have to only thirst after God
[1:24:06] there will be no options left anymore
[1:24:12] we are living in the end time
[1:24:17] closing of the hour
[1:24:20] we are just three minutes to midnight
[1:24:24] what we need we need more
[1:24:27] desire
[1:24:30] what we eat
[1:24:33] what we wear
[1:24:34] what we do
[1:24:38] we can eat all our life
[1:24:41] we can wear all our life we can earn all
[1:24:44] our life
[1:24:46] but what are we doing today
[1:24:51] to work for God in his Vineyard
[1:24:57] Paul says in Corinthians he says abound
[1:24:59] yourself always in the work of God Amen
[1:25:06] love one another
[1:25:09] and you were to keep the unity of the
[1:25:11] spirit
[1:25:14] we did more Fellowship we need more
[1:25:16] Gatherings we need love
[1:25:22] what is the devil's doing he's trying to
[1:25:27] play according to your desire
[1:25:32] he knows what you are looking for
[1:25:39] once you go on Google and type in
[1:25:41] something wrong
[1:25:42] and just go and if you see it is wrong
[1:25:44] and you shut it down
[1:25:47] every time you open Google it will be
[1:25:50] all
[1:25:51] one after the other one after the other
[1:25:54] War the devil can smell you
[1:26:00] he knows what you need he knows what you
[1:26:03] are Desiring for
[1:26:11] there are people walking behind
[1:26:20] once they smell what you need
[1:26:25] they just it's like a flood which comes
[1:26:28] in
[1:26:31] but if you are not like that dear if you
[1:26:34] can't smell that enemy which is
[1:26:36] approaching you
[1:26:42] you will land in trouble
[1:26:47] when we are wounded we need water
[1:26:50] we need the word of God
[1:26:54] when we spell the enemy what we need we
[1:26:57] need the word of God
[1:26:59] when the enemy is near is approaching us
[1:27:01] what we need we need to immerse we need

[1:27:28] praise the Lord for mercy
[1:27:31] but that will be not too long
[1:27:36] we are in the closing
[1:27:49] what are we thirsting after
[1:27:54] let us
[1:27:56] think on that decision
[1:27:59] let us make it a priority
[1:28:02] that all we need to do is desire after
[1:28:04] him
[1:28:06] desire after his word of
[1:28:10] this word will bring us
[1:28:12] faith faith comes by the hearing hearing
[1:28:15] of the word of God
[1:28:18] and this word will take us into the
[1:28:20] rapture
[1:28:22] the water which destroyed the whole
[1:28:25] world in the floods
[1:28:28] that same water
[1:28:30] lifted up the family the ark
[1:28:33] and saved Noah and his family
[1:28:38] and how is God going to judge the whole
[1:28:41] world today it's by his word
[1:28:45] what word is going to judge these people
[1:28:48] in this world
[1:28:50] that same word is going to take us into
[1:28:52] the Rapture yeah
[1:28:56] my exaltation to you my encouragement to
[1:28:59] you today
[1:29:01] if you are thirsting after God praise
[1:29:03] the Lord but don't stop
[1:29:05] thirst more after him
[1:29:08] if you're longing for his presence
[1:29:10] praise the Lord
[1:29:12] but long after him more
[1:29:19] you know we should find reasons
[1:29:22] occasions to worship God
[1:29:29] I always do brother John you know
[1:29:31] whenever I get a chance I invite my
[1:29:34] hidden friends my Muslim friends you
[1:29:37] know
[1:29:40] that's my desire what I want to do is I
[1:29:43] want to sow that seed
[1:29:47] show them love
[1:29:51] and in my Ministry you know
[1:29:53] hundreds and hundreds of being baptized
[1:29:56] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:59] thank you Jesus and all glory to go to
[1:30:02] God only
[1:30:04] but the desire God has put in me
[1:30:08] he showed them love first yes yes show
[1:30:12] them the love of God
[1:30:16] amen when you show them the love of God
[1:30:18] when they see a change in you
[1:30:22] they will definitely ask you why you are
[1:30:25] a changed person
[1:30:27] why your desire why you are thirsting is
[1:30:30] different why your longing is different
[1:30:35] why you are a different person
[1:30:40] sometimes I preach a very simple message
[1:30:43] brother
[1:30:44] but people come to me and they say where
[1:30:47] do you get this Revelation from
[1:30:51] and that is the time I tell them
[1:30:53] there is there was a prophet
[1:30:57] amen
[1:30:59] but today you know
[1:31:01] you don't believe this you're not in the
[1:31:02] message
[1:31:05] no we are not here to judge anybody
[1:31:09] there's a right way to do things and
[1:31:12] there's a wrong way to do
[1:31:13] [Music]
[1:31:17] my humble plea todays continue thrusting
[1:31:21] after God
[1:31:23] as David says
[1:31:26] as the heart planteth after the water
[1:31:28] broke so planted my soul after the O God
[1:31:32] he says my soul thirsteth for God for
[1:31:36] the Living God
[1:31:38] When shall I come and appear before God
[1:31:44] may the Lord have mercy upon every one
[1:31:47] of us
[1:31:48] God bless you all and remember us in
[1:31:51] your prayers and the ministry
[1:31:54] the church family there as well as other
[1:31:57] churches which we have built
[1:31:59] in all these years you know
[1:32:02] I have a church permission to be built
[1:32:04] but the government is still troubling me
[1:32:07] and giving me a problem you know but I
[1:32:10] believe in God's timing we'll be able to
[1:32:12] build a church you know we build about
[1:32:14] 108 churches
[1:32:17] my dad and my brother and you know
[1:32:20] we build 108 churches but I thought you
[1:32:24] know this is the time that I need to do
[1:32:27] something for for our church and then
[1:32:29] and the Lord has made a way given us
[1:32:32] permission you know to the municipal
[1:32:34] Corporation but I still have many
[1:32:36] hindrances from the other departments
[1:32:40] please please pray please pray for the
[1:32:43] orphans
[1:32:44] boys and girls the leprosy you know
[1:32:49] and the elderly and the old age people
[1:32:51] you know the widows the widows affected
[1:32:54] with HIV
[1:32:56] we are working continuously
[1:32:59] night and day you know
[1:33:02] there are a lot of needs for the message
[1:33:04] books there are a lot of needs
[1:33:07] there are a lot of calls for Bibles you
[1:33:09] know
[1:33:10] keep all this in your prayers because I
[1:33:13] believe God is able
[1:33:15] when we do it in the right motive
[1:33:19] God will always send a help
[1:33:22] you know in his way in his time
[1:33:26] that's what I want

[1:33:46] well I certainly
[1:33:48] love the message today we could talk
[1:33:51] about how simple it was but I really
[1:33:54] want to talk about how needful it was
[1:33:58] and the rest of that that scripture that
[1:34:01] he read about our soul thirsting and
[1:34:05] then the question is when will I see God
[1:34:07] and I think too often you know we go in
[1:34:09] the prayer rooms we pray in the morning
[1:34:11] pray at night come to church and we pray
[1:34:13] and we don't have a great enough hunger
[1:34:17] when shall I see God it's like okay well

[1:34:20] and we need a greater hunger to see the
[1:34:24] Fulfillment of what thirsting and
[1:34:26] hungering is really for to getting the
[1:34:29] result and

[1:34:34] mind when we go to seek the Lord I ask
