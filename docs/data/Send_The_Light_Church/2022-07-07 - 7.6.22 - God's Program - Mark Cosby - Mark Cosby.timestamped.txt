[0:00] scripture that will be read that you'll
[0:01] bring it to life lord as only you can
[0:03] lord
[0:04] i pray you just bless the service lord
[0:06] from the opening prayer to ending prayer
[0:08] lord and just speak to the hearts lord
[0:10] just move me plum out the way lord and
[0:12] let your voice be heard lord and once
[0:14] again we thank you lord for all the
[0:16] mighty things that you will do tonight
[0:17] lord we ask all these things in your
[0:19] wonderful most precious holy name in
[0:21] jesus christ and we pray amen
[0:24] let's open up to john
[0:27] chapter 3
[0:29] and we'll read verses 1 through 9
[0:32] actually
[0:36] i like to hear uh pages turn in the
[0:38] bible
[0:45] so probably a very familiar scripture
[0:47] we've all read probably
[0:50] thousands of times
[0:54] say amen when you're there
[0:56] all right so it says there was a man of
[0:58] the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of
[1:02] the jews
[1:03] the same came to jesus by night and said
[1:05] unto him rabbi we know they are a
[1:08] teacher come from god for no man can do
[1:11] these miracles that thou doest except
[1:13] god be with him
[1:15] jesus answered and said unto him verily
[1:17] verily i say unto thee
[1:19] except a man be born again he cannot see
[1:22] the kingdom of god so until you're born
[1:25] again you can't even see the kingdom of
[1:27] god
[1:28] the kingdom of god isn't known by
[1:29] intellects
[1:31] it's known by revelation
[1:32] it's known by the changed nature
[1:35] verse 4 nicodemus says unto him how can
[1:38] a man be born when he is old
[1:40] can he enter the second time into his
[1:42] mother's womb and be born
[1:44] nicodemus is was looking at it as a
[1:46] carnal way jesus was talking spiritual
[1:49] carnal can't understand spiritual
[1:51] spiritual has to understand spiritual
[1:53] that's why when we come into the house
[1:55] of the lord
[1:56] we can't come in our flesh because you
[1:59] come in your flesh you can never receive
[2:01] anything from god
[2:03] and god is looking for a hungry and
[2:05] willing heart
[2:07] i want you to last let's sit in too long
[2:08] let's finish these up uh jesus answered
[2:10] verily verily i say unto thee except a
[2:13] man be born of water and of spirit
[2:15] should be born of water and of spirit
[2:19] he cannot enter to the kingdom of god
[2:21] not just water it has to be water and
[2:24] spirit
[2:25] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[2:27] and that which is born of the spirit of
[2:29] spirit spirit marvel not that i said
[2:31] unto thee ye must be born again the wind
[2:34] bloweth where it listeneth and now hears
[2:36] the sound thereof but can this not tell
[2:38] once it cometh and whether it goeth so
[2:40] is everyone that is born of the spirit
[2:43] nicodemus answer to say unto him how can
[2:45] these things be
[2:46] god bless you may be seated
[2:49] so the title of this uh this message is
[2:51] god's program
[2:54] um god has a program and satan has a
[2:56] program and satan's program is to stop
[2:58] you from getting to god's program
[3:01] and satan's program will always be a
[3:03] counterfeit of god's program
[3:05] if he can't get you to be an atheist
[3:07] he'll get you to be a lukewarm believer
[3:09] which is still in the same boat as that
[3:12] because god said it would be hot or cold
[3:15] and so in god's program there's a
[3:17] certain thing before you can get into
[3:19] god's program you have to be born again
[3:22] because otherwise you'd be just like the
[3:24] folks in matthew 7
[3:26] many would come to me that day and say
[3:28] lord lord did we not do these things and
[3:30] they probably read their word every day
[3:32] they probably prayed every day but he
[3:33] did not know them workers of iniquity
[3:36] so just going to church wednesdays and
[3:38] sundays is not going to get the job done
[3:40] you have to come your heart has to be
[3:42] prepared for each service don't just
[3:44] start preparing saturday night to go to
[3:46] sunday but soon as wednesday's service
[3:48] is over we should be preparing our
[3:50] hearts to hear from the lord
[3:52] i think in this day and age we've gotten
[3:54] so lazy
[3:56] in times past there will be all night
[3:58] prayer meetings there'll be fastings but
[4:01] i think we've gotten away from that
[4:03] we've got this that's how you keep the
[4:04] unity in the church is praying and
[4:07] fasting together i remember brother
[4:08] brandon mentioned sometimes that
[4:11] after service brothers and sisters would
[4:13] cry because they had to leave one
[4:14] another just imagine the unity and
[4:17] closeness that they had with the lord
[4:18] jesus and that's what we're lacking in
[4:20] churches today
[4:22] and we need to get back to that get back
[4:23] to the abc's get back to the basics
[4:26] because that's what that's what got the
[4:27] job done this is the same holy spirit
[4:30] in the book of acts it's the same holy
[4:32] spirit today
[4:33] and should be doing the same thing in
[4:34] our lives as it did in the book of acts
[4:36] as it did in the 60s the 70s the 80s
[4:38] it's the same holy spirit i think i
[4:40] think we just gotten lazy with all
[4:42] amazon two-day prime and fast food all
[4:45] these things have making us lazy and we
[4:48] want everything right now now now now
[4:50] welcome to the scripture where it says
[4:51] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[4:53] their strength it doesn't give a time
[4:55] period it says they that wait upon the
[4:57] lord
[4:58] praise let's go to john 10.
[5:03] so i was uh
[5:05] so it was funny so i was in maine and
[5:07] i've been working on a sermon for a long
[5:09] time it was called satan's program and i
[5:11] was sitting in church on sunday
[5:14] at spoken word tabernacle and then
[5:17] my whole sermon has changed into a guy's
[5:19] program i wasn't planning on doing it
[5:20] and so i was like okay lord and then uh
[5:23] that that same night this the lord just
[5:25] began this inspiration this hit i was in
[5:27] my bed and and this just as a sermon
[5:29] came about uh so
[5:31] praise god on that so he knows what's
[5:33] best so i'm thankful for that
[5:36] so we'll start with verse 1 and john 10.
[5:38] verily verily i say unto you
[5:41] he that enter
[5:42] not by the door into the sheepfold but
[5:44] climbs up some other way the same as a
[5:48] thief and a robber
[5:49] but he that entereth in by the door is a
[5:52] shepherd of the sheep
[5:54] to him the porter openeth and the sheep
[5:57] hear his voice and he calleth his own
[5:59] sheep by name
[6:00] and leadeth them out
[6:02] and when he put forth his own sheep he
[6:04] goeth before them and the sheep follow
[6:06] him for they know his voice
[6:09] verse five in a stranger will they not
[6:11] follow but will flee from him for they
[6:14] know not the voice of a stranger so it
[6:16] is really important that we keep
[6:19] in prayer that's your lifeline your
[6:21] connection not every voice that comes to
[6:24] you is of god that's why it's important
[6:26] to be able to sit still and hear his
[6:29] still small voice
[6:31] verse six this parable spake jesus unto
[6:34] them but they understood it not what
[6:36] things they were which he spake unto
[6:38] them
[6:39] then said jesus unto them again
[6:42] verily verily i say unto you i am the
[6:45] door of the sheep so he is the only door
[6:48] that you can go through
[6:49] if you miss it you didn't go through the
[6:51] right door
[6:52] there's many there's many good people
[6:54] christians
[6:55] so-called christians that will miss it
[6:57] they thought they went through the right
[6:58] door but they went through the back door
[7:00] of the cellar
[7:01] we have to make sure every day that
[7:03] we're going through the right door and
[7:04] that's jesus christ
[7:07] he says all that ever came before me
[7:10] are thieves and robbers but the sheep
[7:13] did not hear them verse 9 i am the door
[7:16] by me if any man enter in he shall be
[7:19] saved so if you enter into that door you
[7:21] shall be saved if you're not saved you
[7:23] didn't enter into the door
[7:27] be saved and shall go in and out in the
[7:28] fine pasture verse 10 the thief cometh
[7:31] not but for to steal and to kill and
[7:33] destroy he says i am come that they
[7:35] might have life they might have it more
[7:37] abundantly so he wants to give you life
[7:40] and give you more abundantly
[7:42] but if you're not going through the
[7:43] right source the right door then you'll
[7:45] get a counterfeit
[7:47] and i don't want to counterfeit because
[7:48] if you go if you go to a a store or a
[7:51] bank and give them counterfeit they're
[7:52] not going to accept it so we'll make you
[7:54] think the lord is going to accept your
[7:56] counterfeit praise your counterfeit
[7:57] offering
[7:59] we're not here just to do the motions or
[8:00] raise my hand or the motions to say this
[8:02] or that but the lord wants the real
[8:04] thing here to have you be honest and not
[8:06] do it then you need to be a fallacy and
[8:08] put a put on
[8:10] so he says i am the good shepherd and
[8:12] the good shepherd give his life for the
[8:15] sheep
[8:16] amen
[8:17] i actually want to um
[8:19] go back to john 3 actually you don't
[8:21] have to turn in there that's something i
[8:22] want to read at the bottom
[8:24] so it says uh regeneration
[8:26] is what we're kind of talking about
[8:27] today
[8:28] the necessity of the new birth see the
[8:30] necessity it's a necessity to have a new
[8:32] birth
[8:33] grows out of the incas
[8:35] sorry it goes by the the natural man to
[8:37] see or to enter in the kingdom of god
[8:40] however gifted moral refined the natural
[8:42] man is absolutely blind to the spiritual
[8:46] truth so it shows me if i come in the
[8:48] flesh into church i'm gonna be blind to
[8:50] what god is trying to tell me and it's
[8:52] gonna become head knowledge and head
[8:54] knowledge will not get anything done
[8:56] because if you know to do something just
[8:58] have the knowledge of it but don't do it
[9:00] what's the use of you even knowing it
[9:01] it's no point
[9:03] let's go to matthew 19 uh 28-30
[9:12] matthew 19 20 30.
[9:15] praise god
[9:22] so what's up with verse 27 uh then
[9:24] answered peter and said unto him behold
[9:27] we have forsaken all and follow thee
[9:30] what shall we have therefore verse 28
[9:33] and jesus said unto them verily i say
[9:35] unto you
[9:36] that you which have followed me in the
[9:38] regeneration so look that word
[9:40] regeneration up
[9:42] reproduction the act of producing anew
[9:46] another definition in theology a new
[9:48] birth by the grace of god that change by
[9:51] which the will of the natural enmity of
[9:53] of man to god
[9:55] and his law are subdued in the principle
[9:58] of supreme love to god and his law or
[10:00] holy affections are implanted
[10:02] in the heart so
[10:05] these it can't be a bunch of do's and
[10:07] don'ts for you his judgments he said he
[10:09] wants to write the laws upon your heart
[10:11] and the part upon your mind somebody
[10:13] shouldn't have to tell you every day
[10:15] that you have to worship the lord or you
[10:17] have to keep quiet in the sanctuary or
[10:18] you have to
[10:20] this god's place is a holy place we need
[10:22] to be treating this place holy
[10:24] if you want god to move you need to keep
[10:26] church order going as well because god
[10:28] is god demands respect
[10:30] and we need to be respecting them and if
[10:32] we can all come to the unity of that of
[10:34] the respect and the sanctuary in the
[10:36] household of god this imagine the things
[10:38] that he can do not only in the sanctuary
[10:40] but in your lives as well see god wants
[10:43] to move
[10:44] but the thing is
[10:45] he demands respect reverence him i
[10:48] remember reading the old testament that
[10:50] when he was on that mountain even the
[10:51] animal person that touched him they
[10:53] would had to die and he's still the same
[10:55] guy he's still holy as that amen he says
[10:57] be holy as i am holy
[10:59] praise god let's keep going um
[11:02] follow me in the regeneration when the
[11:03] son of man shall sit in the throne of
[11:05] his glory you shall also sit upon the
[11:07] twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes
[11:10] of israel and everyone that has forsaken
[11:12] houses or brethren or sisters or father
[11:14] or mother or wife or children or lands
[11:17] for my namesake shall receive a
[11:18] hundredfold and shall inherit
[11:21] everlasting life so
[11:23] as i'm reading this
[11:25] we need to be surrendering more and more
[11:27] of our life to him
[11:29] if we want to follow the regeneration
[11:30] because regeneration isn't you give your
[11:32] heart to god and that's it but it's a
[11:34] constant process every day grinding
[11:37] pressing into the kingdom of god this is
[11:39] something you have to press into it's
[11:40] not something that's just given to you i
[11:43] remember and i think it's in john
[11:44] forgive me if i'm wrong he says the
[11:46] kingdom of heaven heaven has suffered
[11:47] violence and the violent take it by
[11:49] force
[11:50] so if if you're if you're getting to the
[11:52] real thing the devil is going to stop
[11:54] you because he knows when he gets that
[11:56] real thing then he's defeated if you get
[11:58] to the life source then he has no power
[12:00] over you but the thing is if you think
[12:02] you can do it by your strength then the
[12:04] devil is going to defeat you 10 times
[12:06] out of 10. you have to be connected to
[12:08] that life source you have to be a tree
[12:10] that's planted by the
[12:11] rivers of water you know it's the rivers
[12:14] is plural but the water is singular
[12:17] because there's as many rivers but as
[12:18] one water that it connects to and we
[12:20] have to be connected to that one body of
[12:23] life and we have to make sure that we're
[12:24] rooted and grounded in him
[12:26] because if a tree is not rooted and
[12:28] grounded then it's going to be blown up
[12:30] blown away so if you're so rooted and
[12:32] grounded when that strong wind comes
[12:34] it's going to shake your roots and just
[12:36] cause you to get deeper and deeper and
[12:37] deeper
[12:38] that's we have to get established in the
[12:40] word of god we have to get established
[12:42] in this message of the hour because it's
[12:44] the same thing it's no different it's
[12:46] the vindicated word of the hour
[12:49] praise god let's keep going let's go to
[12:50] titus 3 3-5
[12:53] and time just runs away huh
[12:59] titus 3-5
[13:08] so it says in titus 3 5
[13:11] not by works of righteousness which we
[13:13] have done
[13:14] but according to his mercy he saved us
[13:16] by the washing of regeneration
[13:20] reproduction the act of producing a new
[13:22] you were we were once living in a sinful
[13:24] nature and when he came in and abode all
[13:28] things are becoming new
[13:30] and all things need to become new every
[13:32] day because you're still in these
[13:33] fleshly bodies and there's still a war a
[13:36] constant war against flesh and spirit
[13:38] and you have to make sure you're feeding
[13:40] on the right things on a daily basis
[13:42] because just because you wake up and say
[13:43] i'm a christian it's not going to do
[13:45] anything
[13:46] you have to crucify your flesh
[13:49] that's what being a christian is being a
[13:50] christian isn't proclaiming that you're
[13:52] always a christian being a christian is
[13:54] living a life
[13:55] a separated life i'm not here to be like
[13:58] my co-workers at work i'm here to be
[14:01] separated
[14:02] and used by the lord because people
[14:04] people shouldn't have to
[14:06] hear you say your christian nations by
[14:08] the way you talk the way you conduct
[14:10] yourself it's the way you live the way
[14:11] you act that's what that's going to
[14:13] really show who you are
[14:16] let's keep going praise god so
[14:19] i was noticing something something a
[14:20] while ago i was noticing but um
[14:23] just a personal experience alone with
[14:25] god won't get the job done
[14:27] because how many people in the world and
[14:30] denominations have had a personal
[14:32] experience with god
[14:34] but they're still living an economic
[14:35] life
[14:36] so if you look at peter's life and
[14:37] disciples life they they had a personal
[14:39] experience three and a half years
[14:41] but when when it came time he still
[14:43] denied jesus three times but the thing
[14:45] is
[14:46] when peter got come fully converted and
[14:49] got filled with the holy ghost he wasn't
[14:51] denying christ anymore he wasn't using
[14:53] profanity anymore he was a different
[14:54] changed person so a personal experience
[14:57] alone won't get the job done you have to
[14:59] go into a full conversion you have to
[15:01] make sure that you're sealed away in the
[15:03] kingdom of god because you can be
[15:05] justified and have a portion of the holy
[15:06] ghost you can be sanctified and have a
[15:08] portion of the holy ghost but if you
[15:09] stop there
[15:11] you're gonna miss it
[15:12] god isn't coming for a a part a part way
[15:15] bride a part-time believer bride but
[15:17] he's coming for a bride that adorns
[15:20] herself a bride that's made herself
[15:22] ready
[15:23] see the bride of christ isn't gonna just
[15:25] sit down and wait for everybody else to
[15:26] get ready but she every day she's gonna
[15:29] be getting ready every day she's gonna
[15:30] be seeking the lord every day she's
[15:32] gonna be pressing into the kingdom of
[15:34] god
[15:35] no matter the no matter the
[15:36] circumstances no matter how busy your
[15:38] schedule is she's going to make time for
[15:40] the lord
[15:41] every time
[15:43] so i don't care how busy we are in this
[15:45] world all those things they're temporal
[15:48] they're not we're not taking them with
[15:49] us only thing we're taking with us is
[15:51] our walk with christ our character
[15:53] what's done for christ is what's going
[15:54] to last that's the only thing that's
[15:56] going to matter in this world
[16:00] so so a full conversion so uh sunday uh
[16:03] brother ben was speaking about uh so say
[16:05] if i go to canada and have 100 us
[16:08] dollars
[16:09] and i want you know a conversion in the
[16:11] canadian dollars a hundred
[16:12] now if they only give me 99 of my 100 i
[16:15] did not get a full conversion so if you
[16:17] only go in 99 say if you're one percent
[16:19] away from getting the holy ghost and
[16:21] stop at 99
[16:22] this isn't a math test
[16:24] it's not about how close that a is
[16:26] it's about going into a full conversion
[16:28] you get that 400 percent
[16:30] that lost sheep
[16:32] he didn't stop at all the 99 but he went
[16:34] to get that one lost one he he didn't
[16:36] stop he went all the way so it makes
[16:39] think you and i he didn't go halfway to
[16:40] calvary he went all the way to calvary
[16:43] so if he has to go all the way to
[16:45] calvary and crucify his flesh and deny
[16:47] himself what makes you think you and i
[16:49] that we don't have to go all the way as
[16:50] well
[16:54] so a full conversion is a must so we
[16:57] can't just assume that we're converted
[16:59] we have to make sure that you have the
[17:01] real thing you want to make sure that
[17:03] you have the seal of god because there's
[17:05] going to be many people on that day that
[17:06] thought that they had the seal of god
[17:09] but they just had a portion of him and
[17:11] he's not looking just for a portion but
[17:12] he's looking for a sealed away believer
[17:15] and when you get the holy ghost get more
[17:18] when you get more get more
[17:20] keep getting more keep feeling that keep
[17:22] trimming that lamp and keep filling it
[17:23] with the oil
[17:25] i look at the word or the conversion is
[17:27] it personal you must
[17:29] forgive me
[17:30] so con conversion turning away from
[17:33] something and going towards something
[17:34] else
[17:35] so if you're truly converted you're not
[17:37] going to have one eye in the world and
[17:39] one eye on christ
[17:40] you're gonna you're gonna put your hand
[17:42] on the plow you're gonna keep going and
[17:44] not look back like a lot's wife she
[17:47] looked back
[17:48] this one look
[17:50] that one look
[17:51] changed her whole life
[17:53] and she became stone
[17:55] so what is there to look back to
[17:57] there's only death and destruction back
[17:58] there so
[18:01] i'm not going back i don't know about
[18:02] you but i'm not going back and i'm blue
[18:03] [Music]
[18:05] let's go to galatians 2 20.
[18:12] so it says
[18:13] i am crucified with christ
[18:16] so looking like me that i have to
[18:18] have a daily crucifixion
[18:21] nevertheless i live yet not i but christ
[18:24] liveth in me so if you want christ to
[18:26] live in you daily
[18:28] you have to deny yourself
[18:31] you have to crucify yourself you're
[18:32] willing to lay your life
[18:34] down for one another for strangers
[18:37] and people are going to walk right over
[18:38] you
[18:39] that doesn't stop you still from laying
[18:41] your life down people walk right over
[18:42] jesus they even wash his feet the very
[18:45] god of heaven they didn't wash his feet
[18:48] they didn't stop that they didn't stop
[18:49] that lady from washing his feet
[18:51] i want to be like her just imagine that
[18:52] privilege just to wash the master's feet
[18:56] and by serving one another you're
[18:58] washing the master's feet don't forget
[19:00] that not even a cup of cold water given
[19:02] in his name is he gonna forget about it
[19:06] so it says but i but christ liveth in me
[19:09] and the life which i now live in the
[19:11] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[19:14] god who loved me and gave himself for me
[19:17] so that's how when the holy spirit
[19:19] is radiating your life brother branham
[19:21] said the holy ghost can't wait for the
[19:22] doors to get open
[19:24] so
[19:25] why aren't we
[19:27] having that same type of attitude
[19:30] the holy ghost can't wait for doors get
[19:32] open so why are we barely just walking
[19:34] in
[19:34] barely coming in 30 minutes praying oh
[19:37] i made it
[19:38] now we should be hungry and desperate to
[19:40] hear the word of god we should be hungry
[19:42] and desperate god just doesn't speak to
[19:44] speak he speaks for a perfect purpose
[19:47] there's something in your life that
[19:49] we're lacking
[19:50] and he wants to make it anew he wants to
[19:52] refine it he wants you to cultivate it
[19:55] so if you're just barely making it in
[19:56] how can you ever get connected with god
[20:00] i think a lot of times we just make
[20:02] excuses
[20:04] why why i couldn't prepare for service
[20:06] on wednesday and sunday
[20:07] god doesn't want to hear excuses and i
[20:09] don't want to hear my own excuses
[20:11] because they may they may sound good
[20:13] to me
[20:15] but they don't sound good to anybody
[20:16] else but what excuses do is excuses make
[20:19] you lazy
[20:21] and we become lazy it becomes a bad
[20:23] habit you have a feel bad eating habit
[20:25] guess what happens it didn't start this
[20:27] on day one but it started countlessly
[20:29] day after day after day after day
[20:32] and the thing we got to break these bad
[20:33] habits
[20:34] anyone can break that bad habits the
[20:36] holy ghost
[20:37] but you got to be willing
[20:39] to put the work in be willing to
[20:41] recognize it and be willing to walk in
[20:42] all the truth that god has given you
[20:45] let's go to ezekiel 36 26
[20:49] we can't just know about god
[20:51] you can't just know about them well
[20:52] brother bruce knows them that's good
[20:54] enough i kind of know him but we must
[20:56] experience god for yourself
[20:59] you can't really can't up like even i
[21:01] know you children it comes to the point
[21:03] where you guys have to have your own
[21:04] personal walk with god
[21:06] mom and dad can't have it for you to a
[21:08] certain extent they can but when you
[21:10] become of age you gotta strive for that
[21:12] personal walk start now while you're
[21:14] young don't wait until you hit teenage
[21:16] years but you start now there's nothing
[21:18] in this world that is worth i've been in
[21:20] the world it will chew you up and spit
[21:22] you out
[21:23] and have no remorse and do it again so
[21:25] you children you keep serving god give
[21:28] god all your heart on a daily basis i
[21:30] guarantee he's gonna bless you
[21:32] tremendously he honors faithfulness
[21:36] let's go to ezekiel 36
[21:38] let me get there
[21:51] 26-27
[21:54] so probably very familiar scripture a
[21:56] new heart also will i give you a new
[21:59] spirit will i put within you a lot of
[22:01] people tend to stop at just the new
[22:04] spirit they put within them but it is
[22:07] more see thing is the heart that you had
[22:09] was stoning he wants to give you a heart
[22:11] of flesh
[22:12] so a new heart also will i give you and
[22:14] a new spirit will i put within you
[22:16] now take away the stony heart out of
[22:18] your flesh and i will give you a heart
[22:20] of flesh and then
[22:22] i will put my spirit within you
[22:25] and cause you to walk into my statues
[22:27] and to keep my judgments and do them so
[22:29] now when it becomes that part you aren't
[22:32] trying to do them yourself right it's a
[22:34] natural it's organic like how vegetable
[22:36] is organic
[22:38] so it becomes a natural thing that you
[22:40] don't have to put it on
[22:41] you're doing it because you love the
[22:43] lord you'll be pleasing on to him but
[22:45] the thing is you can't just stop
[22:47] at just getting a new spirit you have to
[22:49] go on to getting that seal of god
[22:52] and the thing is i'd rather have i'd
[22:54] rather
[22:55] have the seal of god and not know it and
[22:57] keep pressing towards it than to think
[22:59] that i have it
[23:00] but i really don't
[23:02] i rather have that any day of the week
[23:04] because the thing is if you always have
[23:06] an eye no spirit i know everything
[23:08] god can't do anything for you
[23:10] because god god isn't in that that's not
[23:13] type of attitude that god's in it's not
[23:14] the right attitude to have
[23:18] so like i said we must make that
[23:19] decision like i said before we must
[23:21] experience god for ourselves we must
[23:23] make that decision to turn from death
[23:25] unto life
[23:27] so we'll read psalms 34 8. so things you
[23:30] have to taste the lord for yourself
[23:33] you have to experience you have to have
[23:35] experience with the lord for yourself
[23:38] the thing is don't just stop with a
[23:39] one-time experience but you have a
[23:40] testimony every day
[23:44] 34-8
[23:46] so it says
[23:47] o taste and see the lord is good blessed
[23:51] is the man that trusteth in him
[23:54] oh fear the lord ye his saints for there
[23:57] is no want to them that fear
[24:01] so we shouldn't be wanting things
[24:03] that we don't need
[24:05] see a lot of times we want things but we
[24:07] really don't need it see i want in need
[24:09] of two different things
[24:10] so one is
[24:12] i need more of you god i need it the
[24:15] thing is you you have let me rephrase
[24:17] that a need is you need god
[24:20] but the thing is just having that
[24:22] knowledge of i need god
[24:24] isn't going to get the job done unless
[24:25] you're willing to put the work in
[24:27] because if you want more of god there's
[24:29] more of god for you
[24:30] it's it's as much as you want
[24:33] but the thing is don't stop short
[24:35] because right now god is trying to speak
[24:37] to to you to me
[24:39] but if we're not in the right mindset
[24:40] we're thinking about we're going to do
[24:41] tomorrow for work or
[24:43] how long is brother mark going to preach
[24:45] for us he's going to go over an hour you
[24:46] know i'm going to write him off
[24:48] then
[24:49] we're not going to be able to receive
[24:50] these things
[24:51] see the see the lord isn't in these time
[24:53] frames that we're in you know god is in
[24:56] these time frames well i gotta you know
[24:57] i gotta go to work in five minutes no
[24:59] he's he's saying
[25:01] we go to pray to say lord
[25:02] i'm not here to make a timeline i'm just
[25:04] here to meet with you
[25:06] i don't want to leave until i i hear
[25:07] your voice speak back to me
[25:09] and a lot of times we make prayer until
[25:11] like a time i'm gonna pray 20 minutes
[25:13] i'm guilty of it oh i'm gonna pray five
[25:15] minutes ten minutes don't make a time
[25:17] limit get in your knees and just start
[25:18] praying and start pouring your heart out
[25:19] to god labor into the presence of god
[25:23] go to luke 11 24.
[25:28] see and people just
[25:30] and people think just because something
[25:31] has changed in their life they have
[25:33] received the seal of the holy ghost
[25:36] but if you just stop by sanctification
[25:38] you have not received the seal of god
[25:40] yet god wants to feel you see god can
[25:41] deliver you of things
[25:43] but you still not have the holy ghost
[25:46] and we'll read that i believe in luke 11
[25:47] 24 i believe i'm not mistaken
[25:53] 11 24
[25:55] when the unclean spirit is gone out of a
[25:57] man
[25:58] he walketh through dry places
[26:01] seeking rest and finding none
[26:03] he saith i will return unto my house
[26:06] once i came out
[26:08] and when he cometh he findeth it swept
[26:10] and garnished
[26:12] then goeth he and taketh to him seven
[26:15] other spirits more wicked than himself
[26:18] and they enter in and dwell there and
[26:20] the last state of that man is worse than
[26:22] the first so we could say this man was
[26:25] he had sanctification he was cleaned up
[26:28] but he never went on to receive the holy
[26:29] ghost
[26:30] and there the spirits that went into
[26:32] were worse
[26:33] so we can't just stop at sanctification
[26:35] we have to go all the way to the baptism
[26:37] of the holy ghost
[26:38] we can't just see a lot of times people
[26:42] a lot of times people get baptized and
[26:44] come up a wet center
[26:45] my brother brother brandon said that a
[26:47] lot of times people
[26:49] aren't truly repenting
[26:51] see you don't just don't get baptized
[26:52] and get baptized
[26:54] so jesus did say you must be in water
[26:56] and in spirits you think it's got to go
[26:58] on to receive the spirit of god amen
[27:00] because if you just get baptized that's
[27:01] a beautiful thing but if you're never
[27:02] going to receive the spirit of god you
[27:04] can't say the day of judgment lord i got
[27:06] baptized in your name
[27:08] correctly while you know these baptists
[27:09] and other people didn't he's going to
[27:11] say why didn't you go in to receive the
[27:13] holy ghost
[27:14] it isn't about how much better you are
[27:15] than somebody compare yourself with the
[27:17] word of god don't compare yourself with
[27:19] others god isn't looking for how much
[27:21] better you are than this drunkard in the
[27:23] world or this prostitute in the world he
[27:26] is not looking for that
[27:27] he's looking what are you going to do
[27:28] with the truth that he's giving you too
[27:30] much given much is required
[27:34] we at now um
[27:35] let's keep going we'll go to matthew 26
[27:37] next 26 69.
[27:40] i actually don't want to go there but
[27:42] i just i just uh kind of paraphrase it
[27:44] so that's the time when peter when uh
[27:47] jesus told peter that he's gonna deny
[27:48] him three times and
[27:50] three different occasions he denied him
[27:52] and just want to go to show you that he
[27:54] wasn't fully converted yet
[27:56] and so the thing is we have to make sure
[28:00] don't don't assume because as soon as
[28:02] the venturing authority you make sure
[28:04] you hit full conversion
[28:06] because if you only have full conversion
[28:07] you can never
[28:09] be the soldier that god wants you to be
[28:10] in this program like i said god has a
[28:12] program for your life and it's not up
[28:14] all about your life it's about what you
[28:16] can do for god why was the holy ghost
[28:18] given was to continue the works of god
[28:22] not to continue your works in your life
[28:24] but to continue the works of god
[28:26] that's what the holy ghost has give
[28:27] that's what the holy ghost is going to
[28:28] do in a person's life look at look at
[28:30] paul's life in peter's life
[28:33] paul thought he was following god's
[28:34] program he thought he was following
[28:35] god's program
[28:37] and we met he met him on damascus in
[28:39] acts 9.
[28:40] he realized that he wasn't following
[28:42] god's program but if paul would have
[28:44] stopped there
[28:45] he wouldn't have followed god's program
[28:47] but notice
[28:48] he went on to receive the holy ghost if
[28:51] he stopped just at that personal
[28:52] experience he would have missed it but
[28:54] he went on to receive the holy ghost
[28:56] let's go to acts nine we'll read that
[28:58] verses one
[29:04] and saul yet breathing out threatenings
[29:06] and slaughtering against the disciples
[29:07] of the lord went unto the high priest
[29:10] just imagine he he thought he was right
[29:12] in his own eyes every man is right in
[29:14] his own eyes that he thought he was
[29:15] doing the thing that was the right to do
[29:18] and desired of him letters to damascus
[29:20] how many times a week we get caught up
[29:22] in that that type of mentality that oh
[29:24] this is what the lord want me to do and
[29:26] come to find out it's not
[29:28] but after we do that we don't think
[29:29] about it anymore we don't think about
[29:30] how we got tricked we just kind of
[29:32] forget about it and then and then later
[29:34] don't get caught in the same rut again
[29:36] so you have to look
[29:38] and be aware of what what's going on
[29:41] how did that voice trick me what what
[29:43] was i listening to because you want to
[29:45] call god a liar
[29:47] that's why there's so many voices
[29:49] especially in this this day and age this
[29:50] last day and age to lay you to see an
[29:52] age there's so many voices you got
[29:55] techno technological voices phone voices
[29:57] tv voices you got all these things it's
[30:00] going in your ear and if you're not in
[30:02] the right spiritual connection the right
[30:04] mindset you're going to be fooled and
[30:06] tricked every time that's why it's so
[30:08] important to be sober and to be what
[30:11] vigilant
[30:12] because the adversary is roaming like a
[30:14] lying seeking whom he may devour
[30:19] verse two and desired of him letters to
[30:21] damascus to the synagogues that if he
[30:23] found any of this way whether they were
[30:24] men or women he might bring them bound
[30:26] unto jerusalem
[30:28] as he journeyed he came near damascus
[30:30] and suddenly there shine round about him
[30:32] a light from heaven and he fell to the
[30:34] earth and heard a voice saying unto him
[30:36] saul saw why persecuted thou me and he
[30:39] said who art thou lord and the lord said
[30:41] i am jesus whom thou
[30:43] persecute us it is hard for thee to kick
[30:45] against the pricks and he trembling in
[30:47] the stone and said lord what will thou
[30:49] have me to do and the lord said unto him
[30:51] arise and go into the city and it shall
[30:53] be totally what thou must do verse seven
[30:56] and when the men which journey with him
[30:58] speech is hearing a voice but seeing no
[31:00] man and i saw a rose from the earth and
[31:02] when he was eyes were open he saw no man
[31:04] but they led him by the hand and brought
[31:06] him into mass he's going to jump down to
[31:08] 11.
[31:09] so he talked to ananias talked to the
[31:10] lord and told him and the lord said unto
[31:12] him arise and go into the street which
[31:14] is called straight and inquire in the
[31:16] house of judas of one called saul of
[31:18] tarsus for behold he prayeth
[31:20] verse 12 he have seen in a vision a man
[31:22] named ananias coming and putting his
[31:24] hand on him that he might receive his
[31:25] sight
[31:26] then ananias answered lord i have heard
[31:29] by many of this man how much evil he
[31:31] hath done to thy saints in jerusalem
[31:34] and here he hath authority from the
[31:36] chief priests to bind all that call upon
[31:38] his name the lord didn't even
[31:39] acknowledge it but the lord said unto
[31:41] him go thy way for the chosen vessel
[31:43] unto me to bear my name before the
[31:45] gentiles and the kings
[31:47] and the children of israel for i will
[31:48] show him how great things he must suffer
[31:51] so
[31:52] we go to here and we see paul is filled
[31:54] with the holy spirit then he's baptized
[31:57] so once again we're going to see how the
[31:59] life of paul changes we'll go to verse
[32:01] 20.
[32:02] and straightway he preached christ in
[32:04] the synagogues that he is the son of god
[32:06] but all that heard him were amazed and
[32:08] said it's not this he that destroyed
[32:10] them so they noticed a direct change in
[32:12] his life because he was filled with the
[32:14] holy ghost
[32:16] and he was not the same saul but he was
[32:18] now paul he was he was a different he
[32:20] was a different and when he met with the
[32:22] lord he didn't stop at the personal
[32:23] experience but he went on to receive the
[32:25] baptism of the holy ghost
[32:27] and we see him later in philippians he
[32:30] said oh that i may know him in the power
[32:32] of his resurrection and the fellowship
[32:34] of his sufferings
[32:36] so suffering is key to know the lord
[32:38] your flesh is going to suffer
[32:40] if you want to truly know the lord
[32:42] except for big time you have to give up
[32:43] your time
[32:45] your will
[32:46] your sleep sometimes
[32:48] give up a lot of things what are you
[32:50] willing to give up
[32:53] amen but all that hurt him were amazed
[32:55] and said is not this he that destroyed
[32:57] them which called on his name in
[32:58] jerusalem and came nearly for that
[33:00] intent that he might bring them bound
[33:02] unto the chief priest but saul increased
[33:04] the more in strength
[33:06] and confounded the jews which dwelt at
[33:08] damascus proving that this is the very
[33:11] christ
[33:12] and after that many days were fulfilled
[33:14] the jews took counsel to kill him
[33:16] so he was speaking the truth i remember
[33:18] jesus was saying
[33:20] woe unto woe and all men speak good of
[33:23] you so i think a lot of times we try to
[33:25] fit in
[33:26] we're not here to fit in
[33:28] we're from a different kingdom we're
[33:29] from a kingdom above so we're not here
[33:31] to fit into everyday joes we're here to
[33:33] stand out
[33:35] we have a purpose and supposed to be
[33:36] part of god's program
[33:39] so time is running short
[33:41] make sure you have the real thing
[33:44] the real seal of the holy spirit not a
[33:46] counterfeit
[33:47] not not not a fake
[33:49] without it you're going to miss what the
[33:51] lord is calling you to
[33:52] if you've not received the seal of the
[33:54] holy ghost i'm pleading with you brother
[33:56] and sister don't miss it
[33:58] god is not looking for how much you give
[33:59] to the poor
[34:01] how nice you are all those things are
[34:03] wonderful
[34:04] and i think
[34:09] man i'm going to second page
[34:14] i believe you should do them you should
[34:15] do all those things but you think that's
[34:17] going to take the place
[34:18] of the holy ghost then you're wrong
[34:21] but when god comes back he's coming back
[34:22] for all those sealed with his spirit
[34:26] in egypt
[34:27] the blood wasn't applied properly in the
[34:29] land properly
[34:31] he didn't care if you're a hebrew or not
[34:34] he is a certain thing you had to follow
[34:35] he had that seal that blood had to be
[34:37] applied that blood is not applied in
[34:39] your life
[34:40] you're gonna miss it
[34:42] it doesn't matter how good you were to
[34:43] the pastor how good you were to the
[34:45] church
[34:46] doesn't matter how many uh meals on
[34:48] wheels things you did how many toys for
[34:50] tots you did
[34:51] no that's going to matter
[34:52] if you don't have the seal of god
[34:55] so go to matthew 25.
[34:58] very familiar scripture
[35:04] so we look in here in matthew 25 there's
[35:06] there's virgins
[35:08] there's a wise and the foolish and mind
[35:10] you they were both
[35:12] clean they lived pure lives
[35:15] but one they had a difference one had
[35:17] the seal of god
[35:18] and one thought they had enough
[35:20] and the one that had to seal a god they
[35:22] kept getting more of god
[35:24] while the ones that thought they had to
[35:25] seal they thought they could
[35:27] just
[35:28] just know about god and i can you know
[35:30] have prayers and you know and to do this
[35:32] every once in a while and i'm living
[35:34] clean you know i'm not like these other
[35:36] people out here i'm not stealing robin
[35:38] banks
[35:39] but the thing is
[35:41] if they thought wrong because they
[35:42] missed it and we'll take pick up in
[35:44] verse 1. then shall the kingdom of
[35:46] heaven be like unto ten virgins which
[35:48] took their lamps and went forth to meet
[35:50] the bridegroom
[35:51] five of them were wise and five of them
[35:53] were foolish
[35:55] they that were foolish took their lamp
[35:57] and took no oil with them that's
[35:58] dangerous but the wise took oil in their
[36:01] vessels with their lamps
[36:03] while the bridegroom terry they all
[36:04] slumbered and slept
[36:07] and at midnight there was a cry made
[36:10] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[36:12] to meet him
[36:13] then all those virgins arose and trim
[36:15] their lamps and the foolish said unto
[36:17] the wise give us your oil for our lamps
[36:20] are going out
[36:21] but the wise ants are saying not so let
[36:24] sabrinian be not enough for us and you
[36:27] but go ye rather
[36:28] to them that sell and buy for yourselves
[36:30] and while they went to buy the
[36:32] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[36:35] went in with him
[36:37] so the thing is
[36:38] you have to make sure you're ready
[36:41] and you can't say oh no i'm not ready
[36:42] yet can can you hold like five more
[36:44] minutes so i can get some more oil no no
[36:46] no no get ready right now today because
[36:49] tomorrow's not a promise
[36:50] so you want to make sure you plant your
[36:52] potatoes
[36:53] but still live like he's coming today
[36:56] because he's not going to wait because
[36:57] you weren't ready yet
[36:58] when it's time it's time
[37:01] and while they went to buy the
[37:03] afterward came also the other virgins
[37:04] saying lord lord open to us but he
[37:06] answered and said verily i say unto you
[37:09] i know you not and they live clean lives
[37:12] but he didn't know them
[37:14] watch therefore for ye know neither the
[37:16] day
[37:17] nor the hour
[37:19] wherein the son of man cometh so you
[37:22] don't know the day or the hour he's
[37:23] coming
[37:24] so be ready today
[37:27] and persuade others to be ready
[37:29] knowing the terror of the lord we
[37:30] persuade men
[37:34] so we're gonna go to matthew 7.
[37:37] i kind of paraphrased that a little bit
[37:39] but
[37:39] saying this just because you heal the
[37:42] sick and cast devils out
[37:44] doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna
[37:45] make it
[37:47] because remember judas
[37:49] he was given those things as well he
[37:51] walked with jesus for three and a half
[37:53] years
[37:54] treasurer
[37:56] all these things he saw miracles
[37:58] healings
[37:59] all these things he saw but he missed it
[38:02] and he could say i had a personal
[38:03] experience with jesus i walked with him
[38:05] i saw him break bread and fishes and
[38:07] loaves and all these things
[38:09] when it came down to get the real thing
[38:11] he didn't have it
[38:12] he sold out for 30 pieces of silver he
[38:15] sold out
[38:16] and he stayed for a long time
[38:18] but he didn't have the real thing
[38:23] so not everyone that saith unto me lord
[38:25] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[38:27] heaven
[38:28] but he that doeth the will of
[38:31] of my father which is in heaven that's
[38:33] god's program
[38:35] many many will say to me in that day
[38:37] lord lord have we not prophesied in that
[38:39] name and in thy name have cast out
[38:41] devils in that name done many wonderful
[38:44] works
[38:45] and then i'll profess unto them i never
[38:47] knew you depart from me that work
[38:49] iniquity so they knew to do something
[38:51] they didn't do it so they thought that
[38:52] they can go through the back door
[38:54] because we read it earlier if you go
[38:55] through the door you're going to be
[38:56] saved but obviously they didn't go
[38:58] through the door because they weren't
[38:59] saved he said depart from me
[39:02] so it's so important for you every day
[39:05] to be cultivating your walk with the
[39:07] lord every day for you to be seeking
[39:09] with all your heart
[39:11] even pray hards when it's hard is to
[39:13] pray that's the time where victory is
[39:15] going to happen where something really
[39:16] is going to happen it's so easy to pray
[39:18] when everything's in line you get all
[39:20] the time in the world you know nothing's
[39:21] going wrong
[39:22] but what's your prayer life like your
[39:24] prayer life to me is really going to
[39:26] show me we can pray when it's hardest to
[39:28] pray when everything's going around you
[39:30] your wife's yelling at your husband's
[39:31] yelling at you
[39:33] uh you about to foreclose on your home
[39:35] that's the type of things that's really
[39:37] going to show if you have the real thing
[39:40] because it doesn't matter it shouldn't
[39:41] matter the circumstance
[39:43] in your life you should always be
[39:44] looking to him no matter what
[39:48] this is from the greatest bad ever
[39:49] fought
[39:50] no matter how good you are how more you
[39:52] are how truthful you are those things
[39:54] are respected but jesus said except a
[39:57] man be born again see there's
[39:59] something's got to something happen
[40:01] inside it has to happen inside here
[40:05] anything that's on the outside if it's
[40:06] happening outside the inside first is
[40:08] not going to do you any any beneficial
[40:10] it has to start in the inside first
[40:12] you know jesus on the inside working on
[40:14] the outside inside first and outside
[40:17] if you if you do that that's artificial
[40:19] put on
[40:20] for down in your heart you desire to do
[40:22] it anyhow it can't be artificial it's
[40:24] got to be real and there's only one
[40:26] avenue that you can come down and that's
[40:28] by the way a free more agency you have
[40:30] to make the choice daily
[40:32] come into the soul by your thoughts as a
[40:34] man faith in his heart so he is
[40:36] if you say to this mountain move and
[40:38] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[40:40] that you would have
[40:41] have said will come to pass you can have
[40:43] what you said you get it there you are
[40:45] there's the battleground if you only get
[40:47] that started first
[40:49] so
[40:50] when you come to church and say lord i
[40:52] have to receive you i'm going to receive
[40:53] from you
[40:54] i believe you're going to get it
[40:57] don't but the thing is if you don't have
[40:59] the preparation to back it up don't say
[41:01] it
[41:02] because the thing is god isn't saying
[41:03] well don't wait 30 minutes before
[41:05] service and start praying for the lord
[41:06] to speak to you at that point
[41:09] you need to start three days before then
[41:11] so
[41:13] a great revival here not long ago
[41:15] up there in one of these eastern states
[41:17] they claim to have 30 000 converts and
[41:20] six weeks later they couldn't find
[41:22] thirty people holding out
[41:25] it was just a cold dried-eyed confession
[41:28] grind requires death and regeneration
[41:32] that's what the matter
[41:33] this man was a believer the devil walked
[41:35] right out and openly confessed jesus
[41:36] christ and said who you are the son of
[41:38] god they wasn't saved they were devils
[41:42] so
[41:43] devils tremble
[41:45] they even believe that there's one god
[41:47] but they're not even more saved than
[41:50] at all they're not saved at all so just
[41:52] because you believe
[41:53] that jesus christ is the son of god
[41:55] it doesn't mean anything unless you
[41:57] receive it into your heart right
[41:59] and and that blood is applied and your
[42:02] heart is circumcised see your heart has
[42:04] to be circumcised
[42:05] so you think it's not the circumcision
[42:07] of flesh and foreskin anymore it's the
[42:09] circumcision of the heart
[42:11] if your heart never gets circumcised
[42:13] then you're never going to be a soldier
[42:15] in god's army
[42:17] he's that's what that's what god's
[42:18] looking for
[42:20] let's go to proverbs 14 12.
[42:23] see thing is god wants to give you his
[42:24] seal
[42:25] but the thing is he's not going to give
[42:27] it out
[42:28] if you're not willing to fully surrender
[42:30] your life and fully turn away from your
[42:32] ways
[42:33] see the thing is that nature that we
[42:34] were born with god could not coexist
[42:37] with that he refused to coexist with
[42:39] that
[42:40] so that's why he had to give you a new
[42:42] spirit in order for his spirit to be
[42:44] able to live with your spirit
[42:46] but if you never get that new spirit you
[42:47] can never get the holy spirit but if you
[42:49] stop at that new spirit then you're
[42:51] still going to miss it so my thing is
[42:53] you have to go all the way
[42:55] all the way
[42:59] 14 12.
[43:01] let me get there
[43:04] hold on one time
[43:07] proverbs 14 so it says
[43:09] there is a way which seemeth right unto
[43:11] a man but the end thereof are the ways
[43:14] of death
[43:16] that's scary
[43:18] so there's only one there's two ways you
[43:20] can go the straight and narrow or the
[43:21] broad way
[43:23] the brawl is going to be really
[43:25] appeasing to your flesh it's going to
[43:26] feel good
[43:27] while they're straight and narrow it's
[43:29] going to be hard it's not going to be
[43:31] easy
[43:32] it's going to be many sleepless nights
[43:35] friends are going to turn their back on
[43:36] you
[43:37] family members are going to talk turning
[43:38] back on you i've been there
[43:40] there's going to be a lot of rejection
[43:42] those that live golly will suffer
[43:44] persecution so it shouldn't come as no
[43:46] surprise
[43:47] if everybody's liking you then
[43:50] something's going on wrong
[43:52] because you should be suffering
[43:53] persecution in some shape or form
[43:56] people people are going to mock you
[43:58] all the time for living a godly life
[44:01] and people are going to
[44:03] stab you in the back talk behind your
[44:05] back that's okay
[44:08] i'ma pray for them pray for them that
[44:09] despitefully use you
[44:11] bless them that curse you
[44:13] that's the love of god right there
[44:15] love of god doesn't back bite
[44:17] love of god doesn't count wrongs and
[44:19] talia
[44:20] love god for gifts
[44:23] love is let's let's go to that actually
[44:24] it's not my notes let's go to that first
[44:25] first corinthians 13.
[44:27] i think that's something very important
[44:31] see the thing is
[44:32] that's what the holy ghost is love right
[44:34] god is love that's what the holy ghost
[44:36] is going to do in your life
[44:40] so we'll go verse 1 though i speak with
[44:42] tongues of men and angels and have not
[44:44] charity i am become a sounding brass or
[44:46] a tinkling symbol
[44:48] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[44:50] and understand all mysteries and have
[44:51] all knowledge
[44:53] and though i have faith so that i could
[44:54] remove mountains and have not charity i
[44:56] am nothing so you can have all those
[44:58] things
[44:59] your prayers can be answered have faith
[45:01] to move mountains but if charity is not
[45:04] there they profit you nothing
[45:06] and we'll keep going down there and
[45:08] though i bestow all my goods to feed the
[45:10] poor
[45:11] and though i give my body to be burned
[45:13] and have not charity it profits me
[45:15] nothing
[45:18] charity suffereth long
[45:20] is kind
[45:21] charity envy not
[45:23] charity vaulted not himself up is not
[45:26] puffed up charity has no pride
[45:29] charity lifts others up
[45:31] it looks as other's condition like jesus
[45:33] had compassion and a multitude
[45:36] does not behave itself unseemly
[45:38] seek it not her own so love doesn't seek
[45:40] how she can get something out of it love
[45:42] seeks how i can help this person build
[45:44] up how can i how can i point this person
[45:46] to the love of god
[45:49] it rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices
[45:52] in truth beareth all things believeth
[45:54] all things hopeth all things and
[45:57] endureth all things check this out
[45:59] charity never faileth your love will
[46:01] fail my love will fail it has limits but
[46:04] god's love does not have limits
[46:08] but whether there be prophecies they
[46:09] shall fail whether it be tongues they
[46:11] shall cease whether it be knowledge it
[46:13] shall vanish away for we know in part
[46:15] and we prophesy in part
[46:17] but when that which is perfect is come
[46:19] then that which is in part shall be done
[46:21] away when i was a child i spake as a
[46:24] child i understood as a child i thought
[46:26] i was a child
[46:27] when i became a man i put away childish
[46:29] things i think it's time for us to grow
[46:31] up
[46:32] we can't keep doing the same thing we're
[46:33] doing expecting the same results
[46:36] we got to unite together as a body
[46:39] we can't it's not an individual you know
[46:41] body walk yes it's an individual walk
[46:44] but we got to come together as a body
[46:46] the left arm can't say i don't need you
[46:48] like brother ron said you can't just
[46:49] wake up and say i don't need you left
[46:51] foot
[46:52] you need your whole body to work
[46:54] properly
[46:55] so why can't we come together and pray
[46:56] together that's how that's how you if
[46:58] you want god like i said before church
[47:00] order starts with all of us
[47:02] can't be talking in the welcome room in
[47:04] the couches i said it we can't be
[47:05] talking back there having a conversation
[47:07] in powwows you need to be seeking the
[47:10] the either god in the sanctuary or in
[47:12] the prayer rooms
[47:14] is it the back there in a couch room
[47:16] isn't for us to just talk and have
[47:17] conversations on your phone no no no
[47:19] prepare your heart for the lord
[47:21] because you could be hindering somebody
[47:23] receiving from the lord
[47:25] and it's just the lord's sanctuary even
[47:28] a kid running
[47:29] can affect the next service
[47:31] even getting up during the song service
[47:32] you can affect the lord moving
[47:35] i was planning on saying this but it it
[47:37] needs to be said
[47:38] because we preach church order and like
[47:41] we forgot about it
[47:42] we shouldn't be forgetting about church
[47:44] order it's important
[47:45] how you expect god to move
[47:47] if you're not following the abcs
[47:49] literally abc's
[47:51] something we shouldn't have to remind
[47:53] all the time we should be inc
[47:55] think about each think about others
[47:57] don't affect somebody else's walk with
[47:59] the lord they're trying to receive
[48:00] something
[48:02] and say if we can unite together on this
[48:04] imagine the things that god can do in
[48:06] the sanctuary imagine the things god can
[48:07] do in his house that prophecy we can all
[48:09] come together and pray for one another
[48:10] and come together
[48:12] it's all about unity when in an upper
[48:13] room
[48:14] peter didn't say well wait a second let
[48:16] me make a sandwich real first let me go
[48:17] to the bathroom first no they stayed
[48:19] there and when that holy spirit fell
[48:21] look what it did
[48:23] holy spirit following through the same
[48:24] thing and here tonight here today but
[48:27] you have to be willing to crucify
[48:29] yourself you'll be willing to go the
[48:31] extra mile don't wait for brother bruce
[48:32] to do it or for me to do it you do it
[48:34] you be that example you set the
[48:36] atmosphere
[48:39] amen let's keep going like i said before
[48:41] god is not coming for a halfway ready
[48:43] bride
[48:44] he's not coming for a halfway believer
[48:47] nor a part-time
[48:49] he's coming for a full-time believer
[48:51] we'll go to revelations 19 19 7. there
[48:54] we go
[48:59] so the bride of christ
[49:01] she's not going to make excuses
[49:04] the bride of christ
[49:05] is going to follow everything that the
[49:07] master shepherd tells her everything
[49:09] that her husband tells her she's going
[49:10] to follow
[49:11] no matter how
[49:13] no matter how hard it is
[49:15] she wants to please him
[49:17] she wants to be just like him and the
[49:19] fact she will be like him
[49:22] so 19 7.
[49:26] so it reads
[49:28] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[49:30] honor to him for the marriage of the
[49:32] lamb has come and his wife have made
[49:34] herself ready
[49:35] so if you're not ready today
[49:37] make yourself ready right now
[49:39] strive for it press
[49:42] don't wait till tomorrow cause you might
[49:44] not wake up tomorrow i might not wake up
[49:45] tomorrow it might be my last term when i
[49:47] preach who knows
[49:49] but i want to go out
[49:51] trying to stir things into your
[49:52] remembrance i want to go out
[49:55] making sure that you guys have a
[49:56] fighting chance
[49:59] so it's high it's high time for us all
[50:00] to awake
[50:02] time is of the essence
[50:03] like i said before don't assume you have
[50:05] something
[50:07] just keep striving for more the holy
[50:08] ghost on a daily basis
[50:11] don't stop seeking more
[50:13] as
[50:14] and i think of many women today would
[50:16] ever stop step into the light of the
[50:18] holy spirit under the unction of god's
[50:20] spirit in light of god's word
[50:22] everything that god has promised will
[50:24] illuminate to you and be real again read
[50:26] that again
[50:27] i think if men and women today would
[50:28] ever step into the light of the holy
[50:31] spirit under the unction of god's spirit
[50:33] in the light of god's word
[50:35] everything that god has promised will
[50:37] illuminate to you and be real again it's
[50:40] how simple it is it's from the arrow of
[50:42] god's deliverance shot from a bow
[50:45] while the reason moses failed in the
[50:46] first place here's what the matter was
[50:48] it was a lack of having what the burning
[50:50] bush had
[50:51] that's right
[50:52] and what's our failure today is lacking
[50:55] having what the holy spirit has
[50:57] and the holy spirit has all good things
[50:59] for us if we receive the holy spirit
[51:03] and all then all things are possible and
[51:05] not only possible but promise to us
[51:08] jesus said ask the father anything in my
[51:10] name and i'll do it
[51:12] if you abide in me my words abide in you
[51:14] ask what you will and it'll be given to
[51:16] you
[51:17] when we step into the light of god's
[51:19] word with the unction of the holy spirit
[51:20] just to shine the light on it brother
[51:23] the impossible becomes little things
[51:26] amen
[51:28] so then dear people you hearing shiva
[51:30] report
[51:31] let this be a warning to you
[51:34] if you believe me to be god's servant
[51:35] the best thing for you to do around life
[51:38] tabernacle and everywhere is keep an
[51:39] old-fashioned prayer meeting going
[51:42] keep keep the unity of the spirit keep
[51:44] the looking up and watching for the
[51:46] coming of the lord keep all worldliness
[51:49] out of you no matter how bad it hurts
[51:53] circumcised by the holy ghost will cut
[51:55] away the worldly things
[51:57] now begin to see a lot of worldliness
[51:59] creeping into you
[52:00] so now get that out
[52:02] no matter how bad it is life tabernacle
[52:04] i'm talking to you
[52:06] when i was reading that i was just like
[52:07] you're speaking to me because it's so
[52:09] easy for the world just to creep in and
[52:11] you not know
[52:13] remember a couple more quotes and uh we
[52:15] got five minutes moses heard his
[52:17] father-in-law
[52:19] moses was hurting his father-in-law's
[52:21] sheep jethro on the backside of the
[52:23] desert and one day an angel passed him
[52:26] in a burning bush
[52:27] now an angel came down to bring the
[52:29] message to moses and otherwise was to be
[52:31] his god
[52:32] men are they can't you can't guide
[52:34] yourself there's two ways that's your
[52:36] way and god's way and when you're in
[52:38] your way you're out of god's way
[52:40] you can't mix your way in god's way
[52:41] together
[52:42] either you're following god or not
[52:44] following god don't try to switzerland
[52:46] you either you pick god's way or your
[52:47] way each day you wake up
[52:49] you have a choice whether you want to
[52:50] serve you can either go god's program or
[52:52] a satan's program
[52:54] and don't try to sugarcoat a well you
[52:55] know no either guys or satan's
[52:59] if you choose not to crucify your flesh
[53:01] for the day satan's program all day
[53:03] if you choose to crucify your flesh
[53:05] truly crucify your flesh you're gonna go
[53:07] god's program
[53:09] so he was uh see he was called a sheep
[53:12] we're liking the sheep oh and we finish
[53:13] this and we're in your own way you're
[53:15] out of god's way you have to forget your
[53:17] own way to find god's way a man cannot
[53:20] lead himself
[53:21] he was called his sheep we're liking the
[53:23] sheep there's anybody around here knows
[53:25] anything about raising sheep
[53:27] when the sheep gets lost it's perfectly
[53:29] helpless it'll stand and bleed until it
[53:30] dies that's all it's helpless
[53:33] and we without a leader are helpless and
[53:35] christ is our leader and god was moses
[53:37] leader though he sent an angel i send my
[53:39] angel before thee to keep being away and
[53:42] to bring me to the place which i
[53:43] promised the angel was to be his leader
[53:46] so the lord wants to be the leader of
[53:47] your life he wants to guide you direct
[53:49] your paths
[53:51] but the thing is
[53:52] don't just think prosperity
[53:54] of the natural means you have a good
[53:56] walk with god
[53:57] you want prosperity of the soul as our
[53:59] pastor preached
[54:01] god wants to restore you from the inside
[54:03] out right and if you're not getting
[54:04] restoration of the soul
[54:06] then you're missing god's program
[54:08] the thing is this life isn't about
[54:10] living your own life to yourself being a
[54:12] monk
[54:13] it's about going out and finding souls
[54:16] it's about going out and helping one
[54:17] another
[54:18] building cultivating call your brother
[54:20] and sister sometime
[54:21] i know i'm guilty i don't call enough
[54:24] let's let's spend time get to know help
[54:26] build each other iron sharpens iron
[54:28] that's how a church that's how our
[54:29] church is built
[54:31] upon one another caring enough
[54:34] i think sometimes we get so caught up in
[54:35] our lives i'm too busy to call brother
[54:38] so-and-so i'll do it next month next
[54:40] week and a year goes by
[54:43] and then the same thing another year's
[54:44] go by
[54:45] and then we don't see some people in
[54:47] here a lot of people should be here now
[54:49] shouldn't see all these empty seats
[54:50] go call them
[54:52] see what's wrong with them spend some
[54:54] time with them don't scold them because
[54:56] not in church but find out why they're
[54:57] not
[54:58] something could be happening you could
[54:59] help them with pray about it say lord
[55:01] how can i help brother and sister so and
[55:03] so
[55:04] they're part of the body i need i i need
[55:06] them
[55:07] they're the arm i can't be without them
[55:11] so now dear people you're here in shave
[55:13] report let this be a warning to you i
[55:15] think i read this already
[55:17] and i tell you don't let the world creep
[55:19] into you don't let the world get into
[55:21] your church's brother i pray it out fast
[55:23] it out until god comes down and takes a
[55:26] hold that's right keep the joy of the
[55:29] lord among the saints keep them prayed
[55:31] up and guard every little place
[55:34] again and guard every little place
[55:38] if noah seen a leak in the ark why he
[55:40] put some pitch in it and that's about
[55:43] the best thing i know to keep the leak
[55:45] out of the world is
[55:46] stop the leak is the best thing i know
[55:48] to do only way to do it that's prayer
[55:52] prayer stops the leak
[55:54] prayer changes things
[55:56] that's how important prayer is
[55:59] if you don't have a prayer life you
[56:00] don't have a walk
[56:01] you know that sounds bold but it's the
[56:02] truth
[56:03] can't just pray three times just you
[56:05] can't just pray monday tuesday wednesday
[56:06] and just take the rest of the four days
[56:08] off
[56:09] but a prayer life is a seven day a week
[56:11] affair
[56:12] and like i said don't just check the box
[56:15] but the thing is you have to be willing
[56:17] to die out
[56:18] let that flesh rot while you're in
[56:20] prayer
[56:21] let that flesh know who's boss
[56:23] you bring that flesh under subjection it
[56:25] doesn't control you you control it
[56:32] there's something wrong and you got to
[56:34] get the world out before christ can come
[56:35] in
[56:36] he just won't associate with unbelief
[56:38] and things of the world
[56:40] it's matching time you know that's true
[56:42] it's a matching time amen
[56:44] that must have went home that's right
[56:46] listen this is true i'm gonna tell you
[56:48] my brother i don't care whether my shoes
[56:50] match my trousers
[56:51] or my trousers match my coat i want my
[56:54] experience to match god's bible that's
[56:57] the matching time
[56:59] if you want to match something match
[57:00] your experience with paul amen that's
[57:02] what we need today is a matching time
[57:03] with paul's faith in the bible that's
[57:05] our example
[57:06] real matching time don't try to match
[57:08] your neighbor oh
[57:11] match something to say to the bible if
[57:12] you're a saint act like a saint
[57:15] dress like a saint
[57:17] talk like a saint
[57:18] pray like a saint
[57:20] believe like a sin
[57:22] shout like a saint
[57:24] be like a satan live like a saint die
[57:25] like a saint and go to heaven like a
[57:27] saint
[57:29] i'm read one more and i'll shut up
[57:32] separating time this borderline
[57:34] believing is halfway lukewarm do you
[57:36] know what the bible said that that day
[57:37] would come
[57:38] the latest in church
[57:40] he's uh he said you'll just be lukewarm
[57:42] and make god sick at his stomach
[57:45] he said he spew you from his mouth
[57:47] delayed the seeing
[57:48] this enough religion to make you sick
[57:50] we're still longing for things of the
[57:52] world
[57:54] i better not do that oh brother if we
[57:55] wanted to do that i'll do it but i know
[57:57] tonight that there is a good
[57:59] old-fashioned baptism of the holy ghost
[58:02] that makes you love god so well you
[58:05] don't care do it anymore
[58:07] amen
[58:08] that's just
[58:10] a second
[58:11] give me one second
[58:17] all right
[58:20] one second
[58:29] all right
[58:32] but we strike short oh if we never go
[58:34] over to the church we'll join the church
[58:35] and we'll think that's all right that's
[58:37] all right
[58:38] brother don't think short of nothing of
[58:39] god's blessings the bible said jesus
[58:41] christ is the same yesterday today and
[58:43] forever
[58:44] strike it amen don't be afraid god said
[58:46] so i'm the lord that healeth thee strike
[58:49] it god says so it's the arrow of
[58:51] deliverance is brought to the church
[58:53] tonight
[58:55] so if you want the lord to move
[58:57] in this house
[58:59] what are you going to do for the lord
[59:02] what things are you going to stop doing
[59:04] we have to come together collectively as
[59:06] a body
[59:08] see the thing is a house needs all his
[59:10] parts to function
[59:12] and so i need all of you guys to unite
[59:14] with me
[59:16] let's start taking church orders serious
[59:18] let's start taking preparation serious
[59:20] let's start praying more at home for the
[59:22] service
[59:23] and start praying for more for the lord
[59:24] to con we can receive from the lord
[59:27] and it has don't just
[59:29] make don't just think about it but make
[59:31] it put into action
[59:33] because you can have something in your
[59:34] mind but never put into action
[59:36] so each one of us have to put this into
[59:37] action
[59:38] be willing to start checking on one
[59:39] another start praying for one another
[59:41] more don't just say oh just bless for
[59:43] the ron and just go on
[59:45] because brother ron could be dealing
[59:46] with something he's praying for
[59:48] or i could be doing something brother
[59:49] bruce can we deal with something brother
[59:50] jonathan brother sister gabrielle
[59:53] like i say we we need to be praying more
[59:55] for one another earnestly
[59:57] earnestly
[59:58] our loved ones earnestly
[1:00:00] there's still souls out here we need to
[1:00:02] be getting
[1:00:03] and if we're so caught up in our lives
[1:00:05] we're never going to be able to get to
[1:00:07] him because god
[1:00:08] we're a million miles from what god
[1:00:09] wants us to be we move so fast sometimes
[1:00:12] we're always trying to get into this get
[1:00:13] into that get into that
[1:00:15] and god gets like
[1:00:17] a little bit
[1:00:18] god doesn't want a little bit he wants
[1:00:19] to be the center of your life he wants
[1:00:21] to be number one
[1:00:23] he doesn't
[1:00:24] cut the distractions out
[1:00:26] there's things distracted in your life
[1:00:27] cut them out
[1:00:29] only distraction's going to do is going
[1:00:30] to take you away from the mark
[1:00:33] so even a man's best is vanity so it
[1:00:35] shows me
[1:00:36] i can't do it alone i need the lord i
[1:00:38] need all the lord
[1:00:40] he's my you gotta remember i'm running
[1:00:42] around with saying something that's so
[1:00:43] profound
[1:00:45] you gotta be thankful
[1:00:47] the more thankful you can be in this
[1:00:48] life
[1:00:49] the more you can look back to calvary
[1:00:51] and realize your strength comes from the
[1:00:53] lord
[1:00:54] if the lord takes his hand off you like
[1:00:55] he did to job
[1:00:57] satan can do anything to you
[1:01:00] it's by the lord's grace and mercy that
[1:01:02] satan does not destroy us
[1:01:05] don't forget
[1:01:06] that it's the lord's hands that's over
[1:01:08] you
[1:01:09] he's giving me the money he's blessed
[1:01:11] you with a house over here roof over
[1:01:12] your head we're talking earlier
[1:01:14] there's believers who don't even have a
[1:01:17] roof over their head to worship
[1:01:19] but yet they're willing to walk miles
[1:01:20] and miles to attend
[1:01:23] every service they're wearing the
[1:01:24] snowmobile
[1:01:26] because they know they're coming for god
[1:01:29] but but here in america we get so lazy
[1:01:32] we can't even make it to every service
[1:01:36] this is your post of duty this is
[1:01:38] responsibility it's our job each one of
[1:01:40] us don't just plop in the seat
[1:01:42] become prepared come ready
[1:01:45] let it stand
[1:01:50] amen
[1:01:52] we'll bow our heads
[1:01:57] oh lord uh
[1:01:58] we're just so thankful for your word
[1:02:00] tonight lord
[1:02:02] lord i know it's a definitely a hard
[1:02:04] message lord but i know we all needed i
[1:02:06] needed it lord
[1:02:08] and lord i pray is
[1:02:10] we would leave these
[1:02:12] your house lord that we wouldn't forget
[1:02:14] what you spoke to each one of us lord i
[1:02:16] don't know what you spoke to them lord
[1:02:17] but i pray that they their ears were
[1:02:20] open to hear from you lord
[1:02:22] and i pray that each heart was just
[1:02:23] touched lord because they heard from you
[1:02:25] lord i pray they didn't hear from me
[1:02:26] because lord i have nothing to offer
[1:02:28] them lord
[1:02:29] but lord you have life to offer them
[1:02:30] lord
[1:02:32] and if anybody uh just feel they've been
[1:02:34] cold and formal to the lord just
[1:02:37] make a rededication in your heart to
[1:02:39] them
[1:02:39] if you feel like you could you've been
[1:02:41] putting god on the back burner and been
[1:02:43] distracted
[1:02:45] just lift your heart to him
[1:02:47] because i'm right with you i need to
[1:02:48] rededicate myself as well
[1:02:51] and lord this this world is just
[1:02:54] filled with so many twists and turns
[1:02:56] lord and
[1:02:57] forgive us lord for not always keeping
[1:02:59] our eyes on you lord but from this day
[1:03:01] forward lord we want to make a
[1:03:02] declaration a promise
[1:03:04] to keep our eyes on you lord
[1:03:06] because these days are getting shorter
[1:03:08] and shorter
[1:03:09] and satan knows he has about a short
[1:03:11] time
[1:03:12] and we want to make sure that we have
[1:03:13] the real thing
[1:03:15] we don't want to counterfeit we want a
[1:03:16] full conversion
[1:03:18] and lord i pray there's anybody
[1:03:20] listening on a live stream tonight
[1:03:23] or even in church tonight that doesn't
[1:03:24] have the seal of the holy ghost i pray
[1:03:27] lord that they would seek it lord until
[1:03:29] they would get it lord
[1:03:30] they wouldn't stop until they get
[1:03:32] perfect love your prophet said that
[1:03:34] nothing without perfect love will enter
[1:03:36] in
[1:03:37] so there's nothing short of that we need
[1:03:38] that seal lord
[1:03:40] or i pray tonight lord that you just
[1:03:43] fill us lord so full with your holy
[1:03:45] spirit lord
[1:03:46] that we wouldn't even think about this
[1:03:47] life anymore lord we'll just think about
[1:03:49] living for you lord
[1:03:51] this life is so important lord
[1:03:54] we have to find the purpose that you've
[1:03:56] given us lord and lord we don't want to
[1:03:59] just just walk around aimlessly lord
[1:04:01] we want to find that direct purpose you
[1:04:03] have the position that you have
[1:04:05] and lord you've given us a position and
[1:04:07] duty to be be a church
[1:04:10] lord i pray that we would
[1:04:12] just honor that position and duty by
[1:04:14] coming prepared lord
[1:04:16] because if an army if an army was
[1:04:18] getting ready for battle and everybody
[1:04:20] would just halfway prepare
[1:04:22] and how would they ever win a battle so
[1:04:24] how do we expect to win a battle if we
[1:04:26] come halfway prepared
[1:04:28] because lord you give us specific
[1:04:30] instructions
[1:04:31] to put the whole armor of god on
[1:04:34] the lord i pray that we
[1:04:36] would put the whole armor of you on
[1:04:37] daily lord that's the only thing that's
[1:04:39] going to combat the wiles of the enemy
[1:04:42] the shield the sword the breastplate we
[1:04:44] alert our coins up lord
[1:04:46] and lord there's so many things i know
[1:04:48] many times i've
[1:04:50] missed the mark lord and i missed what
[1:04:52] you wanted me to do lord
[1:04:54] and lord from this day forward lord i
[1:04:56] i'm dissolving dedicating lord to spend
[1:04:59] more time in prayer with you lord
[1:05:02] not just garbage time prayer but i want
[1:05:04] to spend true sincere time in prayer
[1:05:06] lord no matter how tired i am no matter
[1:05:08] how busy i am

[1:05:12] let us all change
[1:05:15] let us all just
[1:05:16] our nature just change day let us make
[1:05:18] that that solemn dedication
[1:05:20] from death on to life
[1:05:23] there's no greater thing
[1:05:25] than serving you lord
[1:05:27] not all the money in the world couldn't
[1:05:29] compare to it lord
[1:05:31] and lord as we're here today lord we
