[37:44] is very sad and
[37:48] hurting and
[37:52] i would appreciate your prayers for each
[37:54] one
[37:56] especially for our daughter ann
[38:03] god knows and and and we just need the
[38:07] lord
[38:08] and uh another one lost just in this
[38:12] short period of time um
[38:16] are our hearts are still
[38:20] hurting for the chanult family and
[38:23] all um
[38:27] of of uh our our all the siblings and
[38:32] all the ones that were close
[38:35] brother dan was telling me that brother
[38:37] jerry was his
[38:38] best friend and
[38:42] the hurt the pain and we just
[38:46] need we need the lord and
[38:49] uh we're grateful
[38:52] for his salvation
[38:56] and uh there's there's always two
[38:59] aspects
[39:00] the one is he's in a lot better place
[39:03] uh not suffering not dealing with the
[39:07] bondage that he was under um
[39:10] and it's hard for us thinking that we
[39:13] cannot be with him
[39:15] no more down here on earth
[39:20] it doesn't make it any easier but we
[39:22] just
[39:23] need to know that there is something to
[39:25] help us until we are to the other side
[39:27] and i believe that god has peace for us
[39:30] today we want to title this message
[39:32] peace today and if we could just read
[39:35] a verse or two of scriptures and then
[39:37] we'll have a word of prayer saint john
[39:40] chapter 16 starting with verse number 32
[39:44] behold the hour cometh yea is now come
[39:49] that ye shall be scattered and every man
[39:52] to his
[39:53] own and shall leave me alone
[39:56] and yet i am not alone because the
[39:58] father is with me
[40:00] these things have spoken unto you that
[40:04] he might have peace in the world you
[40:07] shall have tribulation
[40:09] but be of good cheer have overcome the
[40:11] world
[40:12] and then saint john chapter 14
[40:16] verse number 27
[40:19] peace i leave with you my peace i give
[40:23] unto you
[40:24] not as the world giveth divine to you
[40:26] let not your heart be troubled
[40:28] neither let it be afraid amen let's look
[40:31] to the lord in prayer
[40:33] heavenly father we're grateful
[40:37] for the scriptures that we can draw
[40:41] comfort strength from
[40:46] we're thankful that you could look
[40:50] at this moment lord when you spoke these
[40:53] words that you knew we'd be need and
[40:56] peace
[40:58] in the years that were
[41:01] ahead of those words when you spoke them
[41:05] and lord we're asking today that the
[41:07] words
[41:08] would become alive
[41:12] to us real to us today as we have need
[41:15] of these words lord
[41:16] we know these scriptures are true
[41:20] but we need the holy spirit to come
[41:24] and bring peace to all of our hearts
[41:26] lord
[41:28] lord just thinking about the great
[41:32] hour that we're living in and didn't
[41:35] think that things could ever be this bad
[41:37] in the world but
[41:39] it's just the beginning of the
[41:42] of what is lying ahead of us
[41:47] and lord if there's ever an hour as we
[41:50] approach your soon coming of needing
[41:53] peace
[41:54] it's the hour that is before us lord
[41:59] and so we pray that peace would be
[42:02] so magnified in our lives lord
[42:07] we thank you for these things we pray
[42:09] that you'd bless
[42:10] this service now to every one of our
[42:13] hearts for we ask these things
[42:15] in jesus christ's name amen
[42:18] god bless you may be seated
[42:26] death was going to take place
[42:30] jesus was going to die
[42:33] and he didn't want the disciples to be
[42:37] caught off
[42:38] guard
[42:42] um so he gave them
[42:45] time to to think about it
[42:49] and
[42:52] and he spoke about his death because he
[42:55] didn't want them to be overtaken
[42:58] with the situation
[43:03] and he even told them that everybody's
[43:06] going to scatter
[43:08] and i'm going to be left alone but he
[43:10] made it clear
[43:12] that he wasn't alone
[43:15] that the father was with him
[43:18] but at this departure
[43:23] the disciples knew they would need
[43:26] something because their best friend was
[43:28] leaving
[43:31] and he said i am leaving you
[43:35] my peace
[43:38] now they they needed it they needed the
[43:42] piece
[43:43] for a lot of reasons
[43:47] and obviously the first one was because
[43:51] they all scattered just like he said
[43:55] and they were got to a place where they
[43:57] were denying him
[43:58] swearing and just they got so carnal so
[44:01] much in the flesh
[44:02] that uh jesus was left alone
[44:10] and they were missing peace during that
[44:13] hour
[44:18] god scatters his children
[44:21] for good reasons we don't know
[44:25] what they are and always
[44:28] and as we're going through them but we
[44:30] do know
[44:32] that we don't question what god does
[44:37] god is always in control
[44:40] the prophet taught us that
[44:43] one of the main reasons that the
[44:45] disciples
[44:47] were scattered because after they
[44:49] received the holy ghost
[44:52] and they did exactly what jesus told
[44:54] them to do terry in jerusalem to the
[44:56] end of power from on high
[44:59] all sudden they began to witness
[45:04] and and sharing the gospel and what
[45:06] happened
[45:07] persecution came and the prophet taught
[45:10] us
[45:10] that disciples were so greatly
[45:12] persecuted
[45:14] that the reason they that uh
[45:17] they were persecuted is because well
[45:20] there's a couple reasons and we know
[45:22] they that live godly in christ jesus are
[45:24] gonna suffer that persecution
[45:26] but god wanted to scatter them around
[45:29] the world
[45:31] for the purpose of spreading the gospel
[45:32] now that's what the prophet said
[45:36] so when you preach the gospel
[45:37] persecution comes
[45:40] and that persecution is what's going to
[45:42] scatter you
[45:44] and so we should never be dismayed
[45:47] by what's transpiring because god is
[45:49] still in control
[45:51] the holy spirit was directing his
[45:54] disciples to different areas
[45:57] andrew went north to russia and then
[46:00] into scotland
[46:02] philip went to asia minor thomas
[46:06] carried the gospel to india peter
[46:10] eventually went to rome italy and
[46:12] witness to the roman
[46:14] empire nero there peter and his wife
[46:18] were beheaded for believing in the lord
[46:20] all the the
[46:21] uh the disciples died
[46:25] for their belief
[46:28] john pastored a church in ephesus and
[46:31] was taken to
[46:33] the patmos island just off the coast of
[46:36] turkey there
[46:36] we know what happened to him
[46:40] and they think that uh thadetus thadde
[46:43] fedeus took the gospel to mesopotamia
[46:47] preached in iran and he was clubbed to
[46:50] death for his faith
[46:52] in brute lebanon
[46:55] took the gospel to egypt and as far as
[46:58] the british isles
[47:00] and was killed for his belief
[47:03] one of the places that matthew
[47:04] ministered with ethiopia
[47:06] and a couple places bartholomew
[47:09] ministered was persia
[47:10] and um uh armenia
[47:14] so i want you to think about this is all
[47:17] over the place
[47:19] why didn't these 12 disciples say hey
[47:21] let's take a huddle now
[47:23] where do we want to go we gotta you know
[47:24] get away from nero and we gotta
[47:26] you know escape this persecution let's
[47:28] go over here we'll just
[47:29] have our own little church over here
[47:34] because god has something else in mind
[47:39] and so we shouldn't be afraid
[47:44] of what god is in control of
[47:47] he scattered them he got them alone
[47:50] and now he could
[47:53] use them one-on-one without an influence
[47:57] and they had to spend more time in
[48:00] prayer
[48:01] because they didn't have a pastor to go
[48:04] to
[48:05] they didn't have anybody else to look to
[48:08] they went to god but i'll say it like
[48:10] this they had peace for their day
[48:14] they had peace for that day when they
[48:17] first went through the the process
[48:21] of jesus leaving them and
[48:24] the actuality of it happening
[48:29] they were in the flesh
[48:33] and couldn't get a hold of that peace
[48:38] but the scripture says that peace is in
[48:42] him
[48:42] amen he said these things have i spoken
[48:46] unto you that
[48:47] in me you might have
[48:50] peace in the world
[48:53] you shall have tribulation that be of
[48:55] good chair i've overcome the world
[48:58] the only way we can be of good cheer is
[49:00] have that have jesus inside
[49:04] so the peace for us today is inside
[49:07] christ
[49:09] acts chapter 1 verse 8 but you shall
[49:11] receive power after the holy ghost has
[49:13] come upon you you shall be witnesses
[49:15] unto me both in jerusalem
[49:17] judea samaria and the other most parts
[49:18] of the earth
[49:20] these disciples now had the power
[49:24] they had power to lay down their lives
[49:25] they had power to spread the gospel
[49:27] you know spreading the gospel is is not
[49:30] that hard
[49:32] it really isn't but spreading the gospel
[49:36] to the point that
[49:39] it'll bring persecution to your life
[49:42] is a lot harder
[49:46] everybody don't mind witnessing as long
[49:49] as you don't step on somebody's toes
[49:52] but when you you have to say it like it
[49:55] is
[49:57] that this word is the only way
[50:00] to make it
[50:04] they all died in the faith they suffered
[50:06] the pain
[50:07] of their fellow brother dying
[50:12] think about that there was only 12 of
[50:14] them they're spreading the gospel
[50:16] they're getting persecuted everywhere
[50:20] and they were suffering because
[50:23] the core was 12 people
[50:27] i'm sure they were wishing that those 70
[50:30] would have never left
[50:32] i'm sure they were wishing they had more
[50:34] help
[50:35] but they were like islands by themselves
[50:39] spreading the gospel but when you have
[50:42] jesus
[50:44] you have everything you have everything
[50:48] god had left them with peace in that
[50:52] hour
[50:53] a peace that passeth all understanding
[50:56] and a peace that passeth all
[50:58] understanding is a power
[51:00] think about that
[51:04] there's power when you have peace
[51:07] it keeps your heart and your mind sound
[51:10] and god left them with peace it doesn't
[51:14] come
[51:15] with being with everything being okay
[51:17] outwardly because that's the problem
[51:19] this world is falling apart
[51:23] it ain't gonna like january first
[51:26] culvert is gone
[51:29] the life the world in some sort
[51:33] is changed forever in some sort it is
[51:37] it's it's it's a it's but this is not
[51:40] the end
[51:41] we don't even know what's coming but we
[51:44] know it's going to be bad
[51:48] so peace comes when everything is going
[51:51] wrong
[51:52] and still something inside of you said
[51:54] all as well
[51:57] so no matter how hard things are going
[51:59] how bad how sad how terrible
[52:01] god has left us his peace
[52:04] and that's all that matters we don't
[52:06] want the peace
[52:08] the world can give us we want the peace
[52:11] that only god can give us
[52:14] now the father allowed the 12 disciples
[52:16] to be scattered
[52:17] away from jesus when he needed them most
[52:23] they couldn't even get him to pray
[52:24] within one hour
[52:27] the time he needed he tried and he tried
[52:30] he tried three times couldn't get him to
[52:32] pray
[52:33] amen when jesus was hanging on the cross
[52:36] about the ninth hour he cried out my god
[52:39] my god
[52:40] why has thou forsaken me
[52:45] here jesus was left forsaken by his own
[52:49] twelve disciples
[52:51] hanging on the cross even god
[52:54] even the father had forsaken him
[52:59] he was hanging on the cross as a man
[53:05] free more agency
[53:09] giving him his life for us he died
[53:14] as a human he was the the perfect
[53:18] lamb of god that was acceptable
[53:21] for adam's sin and all of ours
[53:26] though he was forsaken
[53:30] though he died as a man
[53:34] there was a joy that was set before him
[53:37] and we know that joy was us he saw us
[53:41] he was living for us and he was dying
[53:44] for us
[53:45] amen so keep your thoughts on joy
[53:49] the joy that god has for us
[53:54] hey if you think about the hardest thing
[53:57] that jesus went through and joy was set
[54:00] before him
[54:02] everything that we go through there's
[54:04] there is a joy that is set before us
[54:07] it's up to us to keep our eyes on it we
[54:10] can turn our eyes off of of the provided
[54:12] way to give us peace
[54:14] and it won't help us so you've got to
[54:17] keep your eyes on what god has provided
[54:20] for us
[54:22] brother john i'm having a hard time
[54:24] seeing it right now
[54:26] keep looking keep searching
[54:30] keep seeking and when you find it
[54:34] it'll give you strength
[54:37] no matter what the tribulation that
[54:39] you're going in because the holy spirit
[54:41] is our love it is our joy and it is our
[54:44] peace
[54:46] god is well acquainted with the feeling
[54:48] of feeling forsaken
[54:53] and he is acquainted with our
[54:57] feelings of feeling forsaken hebrews
[55:00] chapter 2 verse 18
[55:02] for in that he and i'm sorry if these
[55:04] scriptures don't go up on the board i've
[55:06] asked anne
[55:07] i don't know how things are looking on
[55:08] the live stream but i've asked ann
[55:10] not to be messing with the live stream
[55:13] because
[55:14] i just want her to enjoy the word
[55:18] and and she serves and serves and serves
[55:22] and uh she's here for one reason today
[55:28] that because she cares about all those
[55:31] that are home
[55:35] and uh we're we have been graced
[55:39] with ann's giving to the lord or
[55:42] dedication
[55:44] and so if things aren't just perfect on
[55:46] the live stream i just want you to know
[55:48] that
[55:48] that one is on me amen
[55:52] the scripture so if they don't come up
[55:53] here you have to either write them down
[55:55] or get to them quick
[55:57] hebrews chapter 2 verse 18 for in that
[55:59] he himself have suffered being tempted
[56:02] he is able to sucker them that are
[56:05] tempted so he's been there done that
[56:09] and he's able to help us hebrews chapter
[56:12] 5 verse 2
[56:13] who can have compassion on the ignorant
[56:15] and and on them that are out of the way
[56:18] for that he himself also is compassed
[56:21] with infirmities
[56:28] hebrews chapter 4 verse 14 seeing then
[56:30] that we have a great high priest
[56:32] there is someone that can have
[56:35] compassion
[56:36] upon us that is passed
[56:40] into the heavens jesus the son of god
[56:42] let us
[56:43] hold fast our profession we have
[56:47] not a high priest that cannot be touched
[56:49] by the fiends of infirmities
[56:51] but was at all points tempted as we are
[56:53] yet without sin
[56:54] let us therefore come boldly to the
[56:56] throne of grace that we may
[56:58] obtain mercy and find grace to help
[57:01] in a time of need now it doesn't matter
[57:04] what the need is
[57:11] your brother brother uh ron
[57:14] had expressed his company got sold
[57:18] i i believe there's some questions some
[57:20] wonder not only him
[57:21] but everybody that's worked in that is
[57:23] working in that company
[57:26] brother tyler
[57:29] wants help with his son sister brooke
[57:34] of course the channel family
[57:37] every one of us has needs
[57:43] god wants us to come boldly before him
[57:50] come to him with confidence that he has
[57:54] what we have need of today come with
[57:57] confidence
[57:57] god is rich in mercy his grace shall
[58:00] meet
[58:01] our every need the bible tells us
[58:04] john 16 32 our opening scripture behold
[58:06] the hour cometh yea
[58:08] and is now come that ye shall be
[58:10] scattered every man to his own
[58:12] and shall leave me alone and yet i am
[58:15] not alone because the father is with me
[58:18] god may allow others to scatter away
[58:21] from us
[58:22] to will to where we feel alone
[58:26] but we're never alone no matter how
[58:30] alone we may
[58:31] feel god is always with us
[58:34] he said i'll never leave you i'll never
[58:37] forsake you
[58:39] and if there's a to me
[58:43] i think there is such a
[58:46] a a balance between
[58:58] taking what is available from god
[59:03] in other words god this is your word i'm
[59:06] standing on it
[59:08] and allowing the devil to take us places
[59:12] we
[59:13] don't ever want to end up going
[59:17] and it doesn't matter what it's about
[59:19] and one of the hot the hardest things i
[59:21] think for a human being
[59:23] is to deal with separation and death but
[59:26] the next thing
[59:26] is just separation while living
[59:31] it's just it's hard to deal with because
[59:35] it's it's a separation
[59:39] and we need to understand as we're going
[59:41] through
[59:42] a separation that we're not alone
[59:46] we're not alone we may not i i
[59:49] um it was one of the hardest things i
[59:52] went through i
[59:53] believe when my brother
[59:57] had gone on
[1:00:02] and i was young and
[1:00:05] it couldn't get any more closer home
[1:00:09] and i just remember remember
[1:00:13] just grabbing my dad as this teenager or
[1:00:16] not a teenager i was probably my my
[1:00:20] i'm not sure how old i was to be honest
[1:00:22] with you
[1:00:23] um maybe early 20s i'm i'm not sure
[1:00:29] and i'm sorry that i don't remember
[1:00:30] dates you know how my my memory is but i
[1:00:33] remember
[1:00:33] instantly uh at the place where you died
[1:00:37] just
[1:00:38] grabbed my dad and sobbed and began to
[1:00:41] pray
[1:00:44] i didn't know what else to do
[1:00:47] but i prayed i prayed for my dad's soul
[1:00:52] i prayed that we would be together
[1:00:55] i would pray for his help
[1:00:59] and this is what we as christians have
[1:01:02] available to us when we're going through
[1:01:04] separations
[1:01:06] god has not left us he has left his
[1:01:10] peace
[1:01:11] with us and that peace is for us
[1:01:15] we've got to be willing to claim it
[1:01:17] because the devil don't want you to have
[1:01:19] it
[1:01:19] [Music]
[1:01:23] these things have i spoken unto you that
[1:01:25] in me you might have peace
[1:01:28] in the world you shall have tribulation
[1:01:30] but be of good cheer i
[1:01:32] have overcome the world despite our
[1:01:36] tribulations no matter what they are god
[1:01:39] has left us a peace and that's what we
[1:01:42] want to remember
[1:01:44] we want that more than we want the trial
[1:01:46] to leave
[1:01:48] because trials are here to stay they're
[1:01:49] only getting worse
[1:01:53] and we don't want to have you know our
[1:01:55] peace like this we
[1:01:56] just want peace the peace that passes
[1:01:59] all understanding
[1:02:01] when i think about the time that brother
[1:02:03] branham
[1:02:05] was tricked uh into a meeting with 300
[1:02:09] ministers from different denominations
[1:02:12] and just
[1:02:13] for the most part were trinitarian they
[1:02:16] uh they didn't believe in
[1:02:17] a oneness god they didn't believe in the
[1:02:19] the baptism
[1:02:20] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:02:24] and uh he was going to be challenged
[1:02:26] there
[1:02:27] and it was basically a modern
[1:02:31] uh mount carmel showdown
[1:02:36] and he was by himself and even his close
[1:02:39] friends were part of
[1:02:41] uh uh of of the situation and they
[1:02:44] didn't want to tell him what it is
[1:02:46] you remember that brother branham felt
[1:02:50] forsaken
[1:02:54] brother brandon makes this comment when
[1:02:56] the lord spoke to him
[1:02:57] when the lord showed him he says okay
[1:02:59] well i won't go
[1:03:01] and what did god tell him to do he said
[1:03:05] go
[1:03:05] i'll be with you god will send us in the
[1:03:09] midst
[1:03:10] of many people that are against us
[1:03:16] and he went there with a boldness
[1:03:18] because he knew
[1:03:20] god was with him and that he gave him
[1:03:23] peace
[1:03:24] peace that passeth all understanding
[1:03:26] what do you mean go
[1:03:27] what ain't gonna make a difference
[1:03:30] god gave him peace don't you just love
[1:03:34] that
[1:03:35] i want god to say to me go i'll be with
[1:03:38] you
[1:03:41] one time the lord told brother bryan
[1:03:43] says you walk with too many ministers
[1:03:46] we all become influenced by others
[1:03:51] mainly with those that we associate with
[1:03:53] the most to be honest with you
[1:03:56] god wants our influence to come from him
[1:03:58] and him alone
[1:04:01] the three hebrews they felt forsaken
[1:04:05] why were why were they called the three
[1:04:07] hebrews
[1:04:08] because it dwindled down to only three
[1:04:10] of them
[1:04:12] everyone else had scattered all of
[1:04:14] nebuchadnezzar's kingdom was against
[1:04:17] them
[1:04:18] there were only three standing for the
[1:04:20] lord
[1:04:22] i wonder how many are standing today in
[1:04:24] this nation for the lord while
[1:04:26] everything's going on
[1:04:28] you know some people take advantage of
[1:04:30] this covet
[1:04:33] there's looting the hospitals
[1:04:38] let's just tag it
[1:04:43] i i've talked to i talked to this one
[1:04:46] man
[1:04:47] doesn't go to our church i gave him a
[1:04:48] couple a few tapes we're going to see
[1:04:50] what happens but
[1:04:52] you know he said i just i'm really
[1:04:53] getting used to this enjoying
[1:04:56] the you know sitting at home and and and
[1:04:58] and watching from the from the live
[1:05:00] stream
[1:05:01] i said really he says yeah and what's
[1:05:03] really neat is
[1:05:04] um you know when we're on facebook i can
[1:05:06] see everybody's comments or what they're
[1:05:08] thinking
[1:05:09] about what the pastor is saying
[1:05:17] you can see how people
[1:05:21] enjoy not
[1:05:26] being under the influence
[1:05:31] they rather know what somebody else
[1:05:32] thinks about them
[1:05:34] what do you think about what the pastor
[1:05:36] just said
[1:05:38] how about lord is that you speaking
[1:05:43] because it doesn't matter what jim
[1:05:45] thinks about what the pastor said
[1:05:48] it only matters what the lord has
[1:05:50] revealed to me
[1:05:52] and i just my heart just you know just
[1:05:56] heard about that and i i just began to
[1:05:58] minister him just like if he sat here
[1:06:00] and i said
[1:06:01] look the lord can speak to you
[1:06:04] that's all that matters it don't matter
[1:06:06] what anybody else thinks
[1:06:07] it only matters what the lord is
[1:06:09] speaking to you
[1:06:12] but god had left these three hebrews
[1:06:15] with peace
[1:06:16] for their hour and in daniel chapter 3
[1:06:18] verse 16
[1:06:19] shadrach meshach and abednego answered
[1:06:21] and said to the king
[1:06:23] o nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[1:06:26] answer thee
[1:06:26] in this matter i just want to say this
[1:06:28] and i just came to me and i'm kind of
[1:06:30] cutting it but i
[1:06:32] look those of you that are staying at
[1:06:35] home
[1:06:36] for the reasons that you're staying at
[1:06:38] home
[1:06:39] i believe it's beautiful and it's right
[1:06:42] and
[1:06:42] stay with it that's not what i'm talking
[1:06:45] about though
[1:06:47] i'm talking about where the devil gets
[1:06:49] in in the flesh
[1:06:51] and takes advantage of the situation
[1:06:54] that's what i'm speaking about there's a
[1:06:58] difference
[1:07:00] that's what was was what came to me when
[1:07:02] this
[1:07:03] doctor he was actually a doctor was
[1:07:05] telling me this
[1:07:06] and i just wanted to help him to the
[1:07:08] lord
[1:07:10] and because laodicea we know the spirit
[1:07:12] is just you know continually drawing us
[1:07:14] down in a way in an easier path
[1:07:20] but these three hebrew children answered
[1:07:22] and said oh neb
[1:07:24] nebuchadnezzar we are not
[1:07:27] careful to answer thee about this matter
[1:07:30] in other words it we're not worried
[1:07:33] about your threats
[1:07:36] we're not scared we're not moved
[1:07:41] we're not frightened
[1:07:45] god left his peace with them
[1:07:48] verse 17 if it be so if it be so our god
[1:07:52] whom we serve
[1:07:53] is able to deliver us from the burning
[1:07:56] fiery furnace
[1:07:57] and he will deliver us out of thine
[1:08:00] hand so
[1:08:03] he wasn't sure they weren't sure
[1:08:07] exactly what uh what
[1:08:10] god was going to allow the king to do
[1:08:14] but they were solid that they were in
[1:08:17] god's hands
[1:08:19] and that's what we must remember as
[1:08:21] children of god we are still
[1:08:22] in the hands of god and there is a peace
[1:08:25] for us
[1:08:26] there is grace for us there is help for
[1:08:28] us there are things for us to help us
[1:08:31] through these things
[1:08:35] he says but if not be it known unto thee
[1:08:38] o king
[1:08:39] that we will not serve thy gods nor
[1:08:42] worship the golden image which thou has
[1:08:45] set up
[1:08:47] now look if if if the devil
[1:08:51] can take this covet 19
[1:08:56] virus that spread throughout the world
[1:08:59] and use it for his
[1:09:00] propaganda and i'll tell you we could
[1:09:04] spend hours and hours and
[1:09:05] hours of things that are happening in
[1:09:07] the world all because it came forth from
[1:09:10] this virus
[1:09:11] that wasn't there before
[1:09:16] certainly the devil can take any
[1:09:18] situation that's happened in our life
[1:09:20] and get in there and make it worse for
[1:09:23] us
[1:09:28] that's why we've got to be careful not
[1:09:30] to bow down to that thing
[1:09:33] not to give in to what the devil is
[1:09:35] trying to shove down our throat
[1:09:38] there is a difference you know we cannot
[1:09:43] take away
[1:09:46] the pain and the hurt of separation
[1:09:51] i spent some time thinking about my my
[1:09:54] mom
[1:09:55] my dad my brother my cousin my cousin
[1:09:59] ray i spent
[1:10:00] i was so close to him
[1:10:04] there's so many people in life and the
[1:10:06] older you get the more people
[1:10:08] you separate from that's just how nature
[1:10:10] goes and
[1:10:11] anytime i take any one of those and i go
[1:10:13] there
[1:10:14] long enough begin to hurt
[1:10:21] and it's a reality
[1:10:24] and you just never ever ever ever
[1:10:28] get over it you just don't
[1:10:33] you don't
[1:10:36] but you can see
[1:10:39] how the enemy would like to capitalize
[1:10:41] on every situation
[1:10:44] and make it worse another thing i'm
[1:10:48] saying today
[1:10:49] is that god has left us at peace in
[1:10:51] every situation that's all i'm saying
[1:10:53] that god has left us
[1:10:54] a peace
[1:10:58] buy that peace
[1:11:01] it'll keep our minds and keep our hearts
[1:11:04] as we're going through things
[1:11:06] what about daniel everyone's scattered
[1:11:08] away from daniel
[1:11:10] he was called a goody goody shoe shoes
[1:11:13] yeah that's it that's what he was
[1:11:16] considered
[1:11:17] and all the the princes and the
[1:11:20] presidents they just
[1:11:21] they were set up and they wanted to
[1:11:24] destroy
[1:11:24] daniels everyone first took him
[1:11:28] he was the only one brave enough to pray
[1:11:30] three times a day
[1:11:33] i think about that i think that made a
[1:11:37] difference
[1:11:38] in what god gave him
[1:11:41] do you think when he when he he knew
[1:11:44] about the situation
[1:11:46] he went into his room do you think he
[1:11:48] went in there
[1:11:49] playing the lottery i don't think
[1:11:54] no
[1:11:57] he wasn't prayer
[1:12:01] does not keep us from having trials and
[1:12:04] tribulations in her life
[1:12:08] prayer helps us to go through trials and
[1:12:10] tribulation in your life
[1:12:13] we need prayer we need to stay in
[1:12:16] contact with god
[1:12:18] amen david
[1:12:22] didn't pray with fear knowing what would
[1:12:26] happen to him in daniel chapter 6 verse
[1:12:27] 10
[1:12:28] now when daniel knew that the writing
[1:12:30] was signed
[1:12:31] he went into his house and his windows
[1:12:34] being opened in his chamber towards
[1:12:36] jerusalem
[1:12:37] he kneeled upon his knees
[1:12:40] three times a day and prayed and gave
[1:12:44] thanks before his god as he
[1:12:48] did a four time
[1:12:52] so the very pressure of being caught
[1:12:56] and killed did not change his
[1:12:59] attitude about prayer with god
[1:13:05] why because god
[1:13:08] had left daniel peace
[1:13:13] that's something you can't make up
[1:13:16] and if you know what i'm saying how many
[1:13:18] times you've been in a situation
[1:13:20] and you've been bothered many times
[1:13:25] wishing that there was peace
[1:13:28] so peace is something that's real
[1:13:31] and it's not always there
[1:13:34] jonah was forsaken he was left alone in
[1:13:37] the seed
[1:13:39] but was he alone i mean
[1:13:42] can you imagine going on some uh
[1:13:46] what do they call those big boats where
[1:13:48] you go look at different crews go on a
[1:13:50] cruise and they just like push you over
[1:13:53] going to alaska some whale comes up and
[1:13:56] gets you
[1:13:59] you think about this jonah was really
[1:14:02] forsaken but he was not alone
[1:14:08] we're not alone we may feel it
[1:14:11] but we need to understand call on god
[1:14:14] who is amongst us he is our strength
[1:14:18] he is our fortress he is our refuge
[1:14:21] he's our present help in a time of need
[1:14:24] i don't want to wait till tomorrow for
[1:14:26] what i can have for today
[1:14:28] he's a present help
[1:14:32] everyone first paul
[1:14:36] when he made a decision to serve christ
[1:14:38] everyone
[1:14:39] thought he was a madman paul you've gone
[1:14:42] mad
[1:14:43] even gamelia didn't say to to to to
[1:14:47] uh paul or saul um you just
[1:14:50] that a boy you just keep you know you
[1:14:53] keep
[1:14:54] you know serving jesus because
[1:14:57] gamalia was the one that taught him
[1:15:00] everything that he believed beforehand
[1:15:05] so everybody of his old life forsoot
[1:15:08] paul
[1:15:09] think about it because he was mad
[1:15:14] and then when he began to serve christ
[1:15:17] did you know
[1:15:20] others began to forsake him as well
[1:15:25] second timothy 4 10 says for demons have
[1:15:28] forsaken me
[1:15:30] having loved this present world so here
[1:15:32] is a man
[1:15:34] that was once walking with paul
[1:15:39] and forsook him and took a change for
[1:15:42] loving the present world
[1:15:44] you talk about forsaken he was in prison
[1:15:49] he was beaten to death he was stoned he
[1:15:51] was whipped
[1:15:53] i don't think he felt like he had a big
[1:15:55] following
[1:15:57] i don't think he felt like he had a big
[1:15:59] church
[1:16:02] big popularity but he wasn't
[1:16:06] alone
[1:16:10] god was with him god was in him
[1:16:15] god left his peace with paul
[1:16:19] god left peace for paul in his day and
[1:16:22] we have peace
[1:16:24] for us in our day
[1:16:27] david was left alone he was forsaken by
[1:16:30] everybody was mocked deserted spit upon
[1:16:33] talked about
[1:16:34] all his men left him but god
[1:16:37] never forsook him
[1:16:40] despite all his human flaws and problems
[1:16:44] david still had a heart for god
[1:16:48] the lord gave david peace through all
[1:16:50] his tribulations
[1:16:52] psalms chapter 9 verse 9 the lord also
[1:16:55] will be a refuge for the oppressed
[1:16:58] a refuge in times of trouble
[1:17:02] and they that know thy name will put
[1:17:05] their
[1:17:05] trust in thee for thou lord
[1:17:10] has not forsaken them that seek
[1:17:13] thee what a key keep seeking the lord
[1:17:17] and the lord is right next to you
[1:17:22] psalms 37 verse 25 i have been
[1:17:25] young and now am old
[1:17:28] yet have i not seen the righteous
[1:17:31] forsaken
[1:17:32] nor his seed begging bread
[1:17:36] god does not forsake his children
[1:17:42] from the very beginning
[1:17:48] god has always remembered those that are
[1:17:51] left behind
[1:17:54] he thought about his disciples
[1:17:59] he looked down from the cross to his
[1:18:02] mother he says mother behold thy son
[1:18:04] son behold thy mother god is concerned
[1:18:08] for us that are left behind
[1:18:11] god has help for us god has grace for us
[1:18:15] god has strength for us god has not
[1:18:18] forsaken us
[1:18:19] amen psalms 29 verse 11 the lord
[1:18:23] will give strength unto his people
[1:18:26] the lord will bless his people with what
[1:18:29] with
[1:18:29] peace the lord will bless
[1:18:33] his people with peace psalms 55 and i'm
[1:18:36] sorry
[1:18:36] i'm just going through this kind of
[1:18:38] quick and you just have to kind of soak
[1:18:40] it in today psalms 55
[1:18:42] 18 he have delivered my soul
[1:18:46] in peace he have delivered
[1:18:49] my soul in peace from the battle
[1:18:52] that war that was against me
[1:18:56] the lord delivered my soul in peace
[1:19:00] from the battle that was against me now
[1:19:02] we all go through battles
[1:19:04] it's the greatest battle over fault was
[1:19:06] in our minds
[1:19:09] and god will deliver us
[1:19:12] amen in peace
[1:19:18] he's not going to take away the trials
[1:19:21] necessarily
[1:19:23] he just said that he give us peace
[1:19:27] through the trials
[1:19:29] no matter who or what is warned against
[1:19:31] us god will deliver us in his peace
[1:19:34] we don't want to look outside
[1:19:38] for peace scrambling for
[1:19:41] how i can help this situation
[1:19:44] just look to jesus he is
[1:19:48] he is our peace amen amen
[1:19:52] isaiah chapter 26 verse 3 thou will keep
[1:19:54] him in perfect peace
[1:19:56] whose mind is stayed on thee
[1:19:59] because he trusteth thee now remember
[1:20:02] being in school and the teacher telling
[1:20:06] me to pay attention
[1:20:10] watch this movie stay in tune
[1:20:15] and my mind would wander sometimes uh
[1:20:19] listening to a lecture sometimes being
[1:20:22] in church
[1:20:23] [Laughter]
[1:20:25] and and if your mind wanders you're not
[1:20:28] going to get the benefit
[1:20:29] of what's what's coming towards you
[1:20:33] and we know peace is out there peace is
[1:20:36] left for us
[1:20:39] and it's human nature to want peace
[1:20:43] in every situation we talk to people all
[1:20:45] the time in the world
[1:20:46] they don't know god they don't know uh
[1:20:49] but they want they want peace inside
[1:20:54] they don't know the lord so they don't
[1:20:56] know how to look to the lord and they
[1:20:57] don't know how to keep their mind stayed
[1:20:59] on the lord
[1:21:02] but the blessings that we have in this
[1:21:04] message and being
[1:21:05] taught by god through the ministry
[1:21:08] that god sent in this age to a prophet
[1:21:12] we understand the realness of the word
[1:21:16] and that if we follow the word
[1:21:19] we will get word results
[1:21:22] thou will keep him in not just a little
[1:21:25] piece
[1:21:26] but a perfect peace whose mind is stayed
[1:21:29] on thee
[1:21:29] because he trusteth in thee now when i
[1:21:32] think about all my problems and i'll
[1:21:34] tell you
[1:21:35] i got more problems i feel that all of
[1:21:38] you put together
[1:21:42] you know how that goes my problems are
[1:21:44] worse than yours
[1:21:51] the answer is not solve all the problems
[1:21:55] the answer is keep your mind on the lord
[1:21:58] he'll direct us he'll show us
[1:22:01] if all these people that we talked about
[1:22:04] went through such
[1:22:05] terrible things and peace kept them
[1:22:08] us going through the terrible things
[1:22:10] that we're going through i believe
[1:22:11] there's a peace that can keep us
[1:22:14] and trusting in the lord is the only
[1:22:16] thing that will open the door
[1:22:18] to peace hebrews chapter 11 verse 35
[1:22:26] others were tortured not accepting
[1:22:29] deliverance
[1:22:30] that great chapter of faith
[1:22:33] that they might obtain a better
[1:22:34] resurrection and others had
[1:22:37] trials of cruel mockings
[1:22:40] oh and scourges yay moreover of bonds
[1:22:44] and imprisonment
[1:22:46] they were stoned they were sold asunder
[1:22:48] they were tempted they were slain they
[1:22:50] were
[1:22:50] with the sword they wondered about
[1:22:52] sheepskins and goat skins
[1:22:55] being destitute afflicted and tormented
[1:22:58] of whom the world is not worthy they
[1:23:00] wandered in deserts and in mountains
[1:23:02] in the dens of caves of the earth what
[1:23:05] got
[1:23:06] them through
[1:23:09] what got them through
[1:23:19] yes it was faith it was faith
[1:23:22] in god they kept their mind on god
[1:23:26] that's what faith does to you faith does
[1:23:29] not give you
[1:23:30] all the answers how to solve the
[1:23:32] problems they still got solid asunder
[1:23:35] they still had to go through uh
[1:23:39] living in caves and they still went
[1:23:42] through things that will never ever have
[1:23:44] to go through
[1:23:48] but god kept them
[1:23:51] god had a peace
[1:23:55] god did not take his peace from them
[1:23:59] he left them with peace in their
[1:24:01] situation for their hour
[1:24:04] i may go through something tomorrow
[1:24:10] and your peace that you have today
[1:24:13] or my peace that i have today
[1:24:17] may not be there tomorrow just i'm just
[1:24:20] being honest with you
[1:24:24] i'm going to have to look for peace
[1:24:25] tomorrow
[1:24:27] i'm going to have to trust in the lord
[1:24:29] tomorrow i'm going to have to
[1:24:30] believe him for tomorrow because each
[1:24:33] day
[1:24:34] is the day of salvation each day we have
[1:24:37] to
[1:24:37] call on the lord
[1:24:45] what about daniel he prayed 21 days
[1:24:48] why didn't the angel say hey i heard you
[1:24:50] the first day you should have just shut
[1:24:51] up
[1:24:51] stopped you got to keep on pressing on
[1:24:57] we don't got answers for life situations
[1:24:59] in our life
[1:25:00] nobody knows where we're going nobody
[1:25:02] knows what we're feeling nobody knows
[1:25:04] what we're struggling
[1:25:05] and that's okay because we have a god
[1:25:08] that has a peace for us today
[1:25:10] we have a god that can make up the
[1:25:12] difference in our life
[1:25:14] that's all that matters
[1:25:18] he's with us i'll say today god has
[1:25:21] given us a peace
[1:25:23] second corinthians chapter 4 verse 7
[1:25:25] we're getting ready to close
[1:25:27] very soon but we have this treasure
[1:25:31] in earthen vessels that's what they had
[1:25:35] inside of them to go through everything
[1:25:37] they went through
[1:25:38] that the excellency of the power may be
[1:25:41] of god
[1:25:42] and out of us we are troubled on every
[1:25:46] side
[1:25:48] yet not distressed we are perplexed but
[1:25:50] not despair we are persecuted but
[1:25:52] not forsaken i wanted to read this for a
[1:25:55] moment because
[1:25:57] we will always feel forsaken by people
[1:26:02] but god will never forsake you
[1:26:11] cast down but not destroyed
[1:26:18] we have it it's inside of us
[1:26:22] when god said peace i'll leave with you
[1:26:24] he never said i'll leave it at the
[1:26:26] huntington bank
[1:26:29] and he never said you'll find it in that
[1:26:31] book you're reading
[1:26:33] or that tv or that
[1:26:36] whatever peace is in christ
[1:26:42] psalms 119 verse 165 great peace
[1:26:45] have they which love thy law and nothing
[1:26:49] shall offend them can you imagine
[1:26:53] going through the things that they went
[1:26:55] through and they weren't offended
[1:27:00] they were in love in love with god
[1:27:04] in love with the word and
[1:27:08] your great peace that comes from that
[1:27:10] when you when you love the word
[1:27:12] you love god
[1:27:15] you don't love the word you don't love
[1:27:17] god
[1:27:20] and it's it's a growing process there's
[1:27:23] things that there's still many things
[1:27:26] that god wants
[1:27:27] to tell me but i can't bear it yet
[1:27:31] i'm having a hard time brother i'm being
[1:27:33] faithful with what god's given me
[1:27:37] think about it
[1:27:44] brother john i want more peace
[1:27:49] psalms 34 14 says seek peace and pursue
[1:27:53] it
[1:27:54] pursue it
[1:27:58] sometimes it's just not going to drop
[1:28:00] there
[1:28:01] sometimes you just got to reach out and
[1:28:03] say lord i'm coming to you for peace
[1:28:06] ephesians 2 verse 14 says that jesus
[1:28:10] christ is our peace he is our peace he
[1:28:12] is the
[1:28:12] prince of peace he is the peace maker
[1:28:15] amen
[1:28:17] isaiah chapter 9 verse 7 of the increase
[1:28:20] of his government and peace
[1:28:25] an increase of the government and peace
[1:28:28] there shall be no end
[1:28:32] god has left us peace in this day
[1:28:36] in this hour for us there's peace today
[1:28:40] is there's peace for us now i can't give
[1:28:43] it to you
[1:28:44] and you can't give it to me i can
[1:28:48] comfort you
[1:28:49] and i can make you feel good you can
[1:28:51] comfort me
[1:28:52] and make you feel good not just say it i
[1:28:54] have been so
[1:28:55] blessed by some of the saints
[1:29:00] unworthy to be associated with such
[1:29:04] beautiful people on the planet i do
[1:29:06] believe the bride
[1:29:07] is the best wonderful people on the
[1:29:10] planet
[1:29:12] amen amen that's who god chose to marry
[1:29:17] but there comes a time that you need
[1:29:21] something that will hold you
[1:29:24] and that can only come from god he is
[1:29:27] our peace
[1:29:28] and we need to stay focused on giving
[1:29:31] god the honor where all peace comes from
[1:29:33] amen
[1:29:34] we're going to close here with this if
[1:29:37] that's true
[1:29:38] no it's not true but it's it's getting
[1:29:40] truer
[1:29:41] as we get to the end philippians chapter
[1:29:45] 4 verse 6.
[1:29:47] be careful for nothing but in everything
[1:29:51] by prayer and supplication with
[1:29:52] thanksgiving
[1:29:54] let your request be made known to god
[1:29:57] don't leave
[1:29:58] anything up for chance don't leave
[1:30:01] anything up for assumption
[1:30:03] don't leave anything up for what god
[1:30:05] can't handle this one
[1:30:06] no in everything by prayer and
[1:30:09] supplication now notice
[1:30:11] with thanksgiving let your requests be
[1:30:15] made known to god
[1:30:17] when you say thank you what you're
[1:30:20] really saying to god is i trust you
[1:30:23] and you're showing it by your spirit
[1:30:26] by your attitude and if you do that
[1:30:30] the bible says in verse 7 and the peace
[1:30:32] of god
[1:30:33] which passeth all understanding shall
[1:30:36] keep your hearts and minds
[1:30:38] through christ jesus amen finally
[1:30:41] brethren
[1:30:42] whatsoever things are true and honest
[1:30:45] and just and pure and lovely
[1:30:49] and of a good report if there's any
[1:30:51] virtue
[1:30:52] if there's any strength in these
[1:30:54] thoughts if there's any praise about
[1:30:56] them
[1:30:57] think on these things if it doesn't pass
[1:31:01] the word test
[1:31:04] get that thought out of you that's why
[1:31:06] i'm telling you the devil would like to
[1:31:08] take advantage of every situation
[1:31:10] and take you further than what it's
[1:31:12] meant to be
[1:31:17] those things which you both learned and
[1:31:19] received and heard and seen
[1:31:21] in paul do and the god of peace
[1:31:25] shall be with you can you say amen to
[1:31:27] the word

[1:31:40] yea and it is now come that ye shall be
[1:31:44] scattered every man to his own
[1:31:46] and shall leave me alone and yet i am
[1:31:50] not alone because the father is with me
[1:31:52] these things have i spoken unto you that
[1:31:55] you might have peace
[1:31:57] so it's okay that's what jesus was
[1:32:01] saying
[1:32:01] it's okay
[1:32:05] because you're not alone
[1:32:10] i've spoken these things tonight that
[1:32:12] you might have peace
[1:32:14] that in christ you would have peace
[1:32:18] in the world you're going to have this
[1:32:19] stuff
[1:32:21] it doesn't speak anything about covet in
[1:32:23] the bible
[1:32:26] but we just need to be of good cheer
[1:32:28] anyways
[1:32:30] if he overcame in his situation and all
[1:32:32] these that we read about overcame
[1:32:34] we're going to overcome we're going to
[1:32:36] make it through
[1:32:38] peace i leave with you my peace i give
[1:32:41] unto you
[1:32:42] not as the world giveth give i unto you

[1:32:47] neither let it be afraid god has left us
[1:32:50] peace today

[1:33:04] in me you might have peace
[1:33:07] so let's just agree
[1:33:10] with the lord and take his advice and
[1:33:12] and take

[1:33:47] with the the hardships of our
[1:33:52] of doubts and fears that are associated
[1:33:54] with our trials

[1:34:13] and we know that that view that comes
[1:34:16] with those that that natural view
[1:34:21] are things that cannot please you
[1:34:25] because without faith we can't please

[1:54:06] she
[1:54:11] amen yeah the devil wants to separate us
[1:54:15] there was a situation i love that love
[1:54:17] that testimony just
[1:54:18] another simple one last night there was
[1:54:20] a situation as late at night
[1:54:23] and and someone needed prayer and i just
[1:54:25] i grabbed my wife's hand and we said a
[1:54:27] simple prayer over the situation
[1:54:29] and just heard a wonderful testimony
[1:54:31] today and i just knew when we were
[1:54:33] praying we got done the way that my wife
[1:54:35] squeezed my hand
[1:54:36] i just knew that she you know really
[1:54:40] was trusting in that prayer and
[1:54:43] i just loved that simplicity because it
[1:54:44] wasn't a long prayer but it was it just
[1:54:46] meant from the heart
[1:54:48] and um you can reason
[1:54:51] uh well somehow whatever the lord's got
[1:54:54] to take care of but
[1:54:55] it's like our brother said god wants us
[1:54:57] to to
[1:54:58] activate and call on him and and take
[1:55:00] that step he's depending on us
[1:55:02] to do that amen we're going to say
[1:55:05] something brother yes
[1:55:07] i i know the lord
[1:55:11] ivan
[1:55:14] i know with god
[1:55:31] just out in the store just the other
[1:55:34] last week on the store i i didn't
[1:55:38] i didn't feel that i didn't feel the
[1:55:40] urge or not
[1:55:41] just to talk to him i just felt
[1:55:45] a push like this i got an actual push or
[1:55:48] pushed me over there
[1:55:50] and pushed me over there he was bending
[1:55:52] down looking at something and i walked
[1:55:54] through
[1:55:54] it says can i talk to you he said sure
[1:55:56] you talk to me
[1:55:57] i said can i pray for you and he walked
[1:55:59] through it
[1:56:01] he didn't want me to pray for him but
[1:56:03] the lord
[1:56:04] nudged me again and said go and ask him
[1:56:06] to pray for him again
[1:56:08] so i didn't i didn't get mad
[1:56:11] i just i just
[1:56:14] i said can i pray for you please he says
[1:56:18] sure you can pray for me so i prayed for
[1:56:21] him
[1:56:22] and he got out and he went to his car he
[1:56:24] was heaven i think he was having a bad
[1:56:25] day or something i don't know what he
[1:56:27] was having with
[1:56:28] some sort of bad day was heaven but
[1:56:31] he had a kind of a flower kind of an
[1:56:34] angry look on his face but when i got
[1:56:36] done praying for him
[1:56:37] he had a smile on his face
