it is wonderful to be with one another amen it's more wonderful to be with God's people amen but there's nothing like being in the presence of God because he's here all things are possible and so we we just have to remember that for our need and we just you know often the devil wants us to um to decide to judge what we think is going to happen to be accurate in our our asset of how how things are going to go whether we're praying for somebody or what's going to happen during the service how are we going to feel the presence of God and we just need to believe that's it and and just take a stand with believing and trust God and and not have to listen to the enemy when he tries to trick us with that because all is he's trying to do is get us to doubt doubt right that's all he's trying to get us to do is doubt turn with me if you would to the book of St John chapter 3 today we want to entitle this message the power of God's love and I was blessed to hear that song such love tonight amen amen uh before we begin reading the words of Jesus in in um St John chapter 3 Let's look um to God in just a word of prayer before we begin to service Heavenly Father we want to thank you for your presence Lord the power that's in your word you said that you would be present in the midst of just two or three that would be gathered in your name and Lord we thank you that you've always been true to your word you there will never be a time never was a time never will there be a time that you you had not been where two or three are gathered in your your name father this gives us confidence today Lord that the invisible God is amongst us that the angels are encamped about the train we believe is filling the temple Lord we are your believing children now we're coming to you in prayer to ask your blessings upon this service that you would prepare our hearts to receive your word Lord that we might be filled with comfort with strength Lord that we might be about your business when we leave the building today come and have your way inhabit our Praises receive our worship Lord as we say Amen to the word of God for we commit the service into your hands now we thank you for all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen as we know Nicodemus and Jesus had this talk and I want to pick up on verse number 12 and Jesus said if I have told you Earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if I tell you Heavenly things and no man have ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and he's here he's standing on Earth saying he's in heaven showing that God and Jesus are the same now look at this as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness what was that serpent for that lifting of the serpent it was to bring healing to the children of Israel and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life amen God bless you may be seated for God so loved the world that he gave he didn't make a deal with mankind he gave himself basically he sent out his love to mankind by sacrificing his life that we could have life Jesus said even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many I want to say that in saying the message is the power of God's love God's love has so much power that it can Minister it doesn't always have to be ministered onto but it can Minister and I want to give you faith and confidence that you can minister to others amen Jesus said in John 10:10 I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep it took power to give it's true that you can't kill God he he he cannot die he will never die but he created a body by the spoken word and and he put his life in that perfect body now that perfect body was what God was requiring because that's what he told Eve the day you eat the day you'll die and life was required and he loved us so much that he didn't want us to die he had a vision for us and so he took upon himself that he would bear the burden and he created that body he he tasted death for every man the Bible says and he gave himself a ransom for money for many Jesus said no man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it up this commandment have I received of my father so it takes power to lay down her life it takes a denial of our s it takes a giving up of our will it takes character I'll say it like this in Simplicity it takes the love of God our love is only so far it's only going to suffer so long it's only going to take so and finally it's going to say I quit our love quits always but God's love never quits it endures all things it believes all things it Bears all things it goes not only the Second Mile the third mile the fourth mile it keeps going it never never stops and this power is true love love was the motivation that God had behind his giving for God so loved the world that he gave you know he wasn't looking for anything for himself he was looking for us think about that our love when we go to love some body we're looking for something in return I better get a handshake I better get a I better get something out of this deal that I'm giving of myself otherwise I ain't got time for you I'm gonna go do what I want to do but God came down when we did not even know about him care about him we're just in our own life didn't want to be bothered it took God to get our attention am Ephesians 2 tells us that at one time ye were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the Covenant of the promise having no hope and without God in the world that was our condition Ephesians 2 turn with me if you would or put up on the board Ephesians 2 verse one we we were absolutely dead in our trespasses and sins we were goners we're we're heading right to hell we walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversations in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and by Nature the children are wrath even as others this was the condition of every single person that came to Jesus Christ and that is still the condition of every single person who doesn't come to Jesus Christ you don't grow out of this you just you just learn to be a little bit better of a deceiver right the older you get the more you know how to trick people we were helpless we were hopeless nothing but torment and Hell stood in front of us to come but verse but verse four says but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us my aren't you so glad he didn't send some little letter Down to Earth on a plane or something and just say I love you I love you it wouldn't have done a thing he had to come down to earth and manif man EST his love and he did and and that love was full of Mercy it was rich in Mercy the treasures of his Mercy is so rich even when we were dead in sins have quickened us together with Christ ah when I think of that that's that that statement quickened together with Christ remember Christ is in heaven we're on Earth We're Earthly beings he's a Heavenly being and he does something to our lives he does something to our nature that puts us in the same plane that Christ is the same love the same nature the same character there's a a quickening that happens and then he says by Grace you're saved and has raised us up together notice together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus well we know God is love brother Brandon said when he went behind the curtain at time he said nothing but perfect love would would be able to enter there because he said that's all that was there that was his description of heaven and so when we're caught up into Heavenly places we're caught up in his love come on we're caught up in the love of God and and that should do something to us because now we're sitting together we're no longer we're here and he's there it's no it is it's no longer us trying to put peacock feathers in we become like Christ Our nature becomes like him something happens inside of the believer notice Paul said for God's great love God's great love Jesus said no greater love has a man than this than a man laid down his life for who his friends now notice when he came to every one of us we hated him we I don't know how long you did but I didn't jump at the gun and and say Yes Lord I want to lose my will and do yours I put them off I ignored but his he called me his friend because he knew down the road I would love him he called me friend before I called him friend wherewith he loved us when we were dead inside of God's great love was this Priceless Riches of mercy and mercy is not giving us what we do deserve we all deserve judgment we all deserve to go to hell there isn't just some there isn't just certain people that deserve to go right we all deserve to go but there's something that stepped in the way for you and me and that's called Mercy it stepped right there in the way and God had mercy on us and we're here today saying thank you Lord for the mercy you've given us inside God's great love was the Priceless Riches of his grace and that was giving us what we don't deserve we don't deserve eternal life we don't deserve Joy and peace and and love and we don't deserve heaven we don't we'll never deserve it that's why we should always feel in debt to God that was a problem with Lucifer he felt that something was old to him look at the trouble I got him into when we take time to consider what God did for us individually it should fill us with a renewed gratitude on a daily basis that's why we need to keep our eyes on Calvary we need to be thankful until God completes the work inside of us don't be just satisfied with with what God did that he paid the price for your salvation at Calvary but God has a greater interest involved and that is he wants to see his nature inside of you he wants to take out your old nature and put his in you and what's standing in the way brother Randon said we're we're our greatest enemy second Peter 1 says that if we give all diligence to keep adding Christ to our lives then we'll remain fruitful in growing is that what it says but if a Believer doesn't have the mindset of continuing to add to their lives in a spiritual way then they are spiritually blind and Cann not see a far off and is even forgotten that he was purged from his own sins me we can forget about Calvary pretty fast when we stop adding Christ to our our need to go to church our need to pray our need to get in the taste our need to get closer to God our need to reach out to other people when we lose that then we just become a regular old churchgoer what's the remedy he said give diligence to make your calling and your election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall I say let's give diligence let's keep adding let's look at our life and be honest what did I do wrong today what do I need a character changing and let's get serious with God Amen notice now what this love does in the human heart it quickens us together with Christ it raises us up makes us to sit with him in Heavenly places we're not the same anymore we have a hope at one time we had no hope but now we have a hope and I'll say it like this when you're caught up into a realm of heavenly love yeah now notice that love is it's without respect to persons it's not looking in anything into return it's it's a place of perfect love and I'll say you talk about security there's Security in the love of God there's no security in the love of John Martin I I'll just be honest with you somewhere down the line John Martin is not Jesus Christ can I say it like that but Jesus Christ will always be Jesus Christ we're in the midst of becoming more like him coming into His Image so our eyes stayed on the word our eyes stayed on what really perfect love is but there is security he will never fail you he will never leave you Romans 8:35 says who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or dest or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril I don't care what what we go through who shall separate us from the love of Christ there is only one person that can separate you from the love of Christ and that is you you getting in the way of letting God perfectly love through you amen when you're you're caught up into this realm where you know that you are you are loved by the greatest person someone that will he'll never he'll you you you're in the palm of his hand no man can pluck you from the father's hands when you know you're there it don't matter what's happening down here it just doesn't matter because you're being kept up here as it is written as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long so get used to the tribulation get used to the stress get used to the persecution for these things are there they're they're they're God is working in together to kill us all day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter but you know it doesn't matter nay in all these things we're more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels principalities Powers things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from what the love of God the love of God now notice where that love is it's in Christ Jesus the love of God is isn't in John Martin the love of God is in God is in Christ Jesus who is in John Martin do you understand because John Martin cannot uh peacock the love of God you can't you cannot get warmed by a painted fire you either got the heat coming out of you it's either real or it's not it is willing to lay down its life or it selfish is all get out you with me are you are you getting what I'm trying to say because you know so often we you know we yes we have love and and yes we have God but look here is the word to tell you where you're standing because if you're laying down your life that's God if you're giving of yourself that's God but if I'll do this but I don't want to go too far because you know let's identify what that is is that God you know Jesus taught us 7times 70 you know some Christians only want to use that scripture for their benefit come on are you with me I'm going to quote the word if it's going to be benefited to me but don't I don't want to be accountable to actually laying down my life stimes 70 for somebody else I am telling you that love that you're possessing you'll soonly be separated in some test or trial we need the love of God nothing but perfect love can enter in there and we can't be satisfied with what we have we got to press on for more brother Brom says get to the place where you can love everyone even your enemy get to that place it takes work it takes effort it takes a vision it takes a heart to want to get where God wants us to get instead of just I love God are you with me there is power in God's love to lift us up into a Heavenly realm to where we are secure to where we can say nothing shall separate us from the love of Christ there's nothing to fear when you're filled with God's love when you don't have God's love it's easy to get scared because we're down here and understand we live in this world we have to live in this world right we have to deal with problems but we're not of the world we've been quickened and yes we got to Die daily we got to get in his presence daily but you know fear is not part of the believer's overcoming armor fear is is is something to stand in the way from being an overcomer now here's the sad news fear is not going away fear is increasing in the world fear is here to stay the Bible says that in the last days Jesus said that men's Hearts would be failing for fear right it's not going away people are being succumbed by the bombardment of fear it's a realness but fear is not a part of the believer God is not taking fear out of the world we've got to face it head on we can't just whistle through the graveyard right we've got to have a genuine confidence that God is with us we've got to get back up on the horse when we get bucked off we've got to say I shall not be moved I remember when I was young your how do I say that I think last year I was I feel like I was young last year you know what I'm saying I remember getting bucked off a horse one time and it hurt where I landed how I landed and I was laying there on the ground and I was being laughed at by those around and you want to know something I was intimidated by the situation by what that horse did to me I did not have this overwhelming feeling oh you know what I want to get back on that horse because I want to get thrown again but I'll say say it like this the Bible says if a righteous man falls seven times seven times he'll get back up amen there's just something inside of a believer that isn't going to stay down in the mud that God brought him out of I'll tell you I know this what we call the end time there are people who are not going to come into it there are people are going to come into it that's all they're going to do and there's people that are to come in and they're going to become it they're going to be Overcomers there's going to be a bride that comes out of this message they're going to take the word of God seriously too many people have lowered their standards of well if I just make it to church or or if I just do this and they feel content with that when God has called us to a Heavenly place a place of perfect love we got to Shake the Dust off get back up it's okay to do that it is not okay to stay down and fake it you're only hurting yourself and those around you I think people need you people need you but if you're so caught up in your own life how can you you help others so in the midst of everything that go is going on in your life that will go on in your life simply fear not fear not it's a choice Jesus said fear not it's the father's good pleasure to give you the the the kingdom when the angel would always come he would say fear not we have a choice I like that I don't have to fear I I can be fear free let's go to church for a moment Psalms 23:1 it's the psalm of David the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want what a good way to come to church with a good attitude God already knows what we have need of so just seek first the kingdom and all the things shall be added amen he maketh me me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside Still Waters I I just I you know I remember the prophet telling me that a Christian he can't wait to get to the house of the Lord something inside of him he can't wait to get there you know what that is that's he making me lay down in Green Pastures that's that's god in me uh uh putting me before Still Waters because otherwise think about it if that desire isn't there is no different than when we were in the world no different I mean just because we're a Christian we're saved that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have a hunger and a thirst for more of the word right there's a reason there's a reason he he's making us like down in Green Pastures because the he wants to get us at a place where we can become just still enough to hear from him I made mention that any spirit that would lead you to miss church is not the leadership of the Holy Ghost the leadership of the Holy Ghost is to come together all the more as you see the day approaching now that's God's spirit that's his leadership all the more we need to be getting together he restoreth my soul wow isn't that beautiful he leadth me he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake that means we're going to be going down some right paths amen some some some some better paths that we're in you may say your Soul's been restored but God saying I'm still working on you amen all may be well with your soul but God is still working with you amen so when you look at one another when you look at me as your pastor I want you to know God is still working on me amen yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death getting back to this I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me we can walk through any situation without fear if we can walk through the valley of the Shadow death if we can walk through to the other side if we can walk through this this Valley of deny in ourself and giving God the steering wheel of our life if we can give up the our will we can certainly stand and tell the devil I don't fear you I am not being moved by what you're bringing to my mind God is love and love is with me I've been caught up into a Heavenly realm I will fear no evil thy rod and thy staff they Comfort Me Jesus said as many as I love I rebuke and chasen so when God takes the rod and he he brings a correction and honestly let's just be honest I've been corrected by human beings and I have felt horrible after correction but you know even in God's correction there's love if he told us to speak the truth in love I think he lives it so I'm just saying the rod of Correction is nothing to fear There's an actual comfort in it I mean when when certain people you know would go to correct you try to try to say something behind your back or something like that they're not even they don't even have love but when God is trying to correct us from the pulpit that's love there's love behind that he's caring about our soul so David he said I will I will fear no evil there's no evil about this situation so whether God's Rod of correction is coming to us it's coming from a a a a heart of Love or he's giving us his promises as a rod a staff to lean on and say I Take God at his word I'm leaning upon this either way it's coming from a god of love whether it's promises or this is the Commandment I want you to do are you with me amen thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies so get over it God is not taking the enemies away he didn't say pluck the tears out wait keep them there you know we're going to grow we're going to mature we're going to become more like Christ we're going to Bear the fruit of God at the same time that others who choose not to get serious with God but I'm going to tell you this enemy who that real enemy is it's our ungodly worldly nature that's the real enemy so we come to church we had a bad day we flew off the handle we got upset and we come right in church out of obedience to to Jesus Christ we sit there in the midst with this greatest enemy that we ever had you know what happens God prepares spiritual food for your spiritual life he anoints your head with the mind of Christ be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind and God begins to renew your mind he doesn't just want to forgive us for what happened today he wants to show us what we need to do to be real true Overcomers tomorrow he fills our unworthy vessel with his oil so we express joy unspeakable and full of Glory I mean I believe in a cup running over I believe we ought to have that if it ain't running over we got to get some in there get some more in there we've all been guilty of pouring something into a cup and we poured too much right and come many times he had a cup somebody poured coffee at a restaurant poured it into your cup whoa what' you do that for whoa but you know what we want God to fill our cup we're longing for him to fill our cup because there's where the real Joy is at in the presence of God surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord you know whenever I can make it there's something going on here there's a real love relationship here surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever David said one time one thing if I desire to the Lord that why seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple and he begins to deal with this fear that's around and he says though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise up against me in this will I be confident confident in what I am going to meet God in his Tabernacle I know I know in whom I believe I know he's going to meet me there because that's where he dwells I'm not necessarily meaning a a building here what I am meaning is we ought to be abiding in the Tabernacle of the lord always amen amen for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock now I believe he has a revelation that's higher for every one of us a rock that is higher than us and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord when we receive the mind of Christ we are literally lifted up above our enemy but if we dwell with that carnal mindset even in church I am telling you you are not lifted above your enemy in fact you become an enemy of God because the carnal mind is enity with God Amen so we need what we need to do is stop feeding fear stop feeding fear because you can't stop it from coming but you can stop feeding it just starve it the more you commune with fear the bigger it gets the more you listen to a spirit of fear it gets a greater hold on you am and we just got to stop God has not given me the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind and you know sometimes you just got to talk to the devil why because he talks to you now now now understand I don't really believe in having conversations with the devil but I want want to say this when we allow the devil to talk to us I think we need to talk to him you understand I'm saying if you gone through the course of the whole day and you're just listening to this stuff that the devil's telling you I think you need to take a stand in you because you got to confess it with your mouth but honestly if you haven't been listening to the devil I wouldn't give the devil's sent I wouldn't give him anything but when you sit there and you listen to the devil you know what you're doing you're entertaining him and you just got to take a you just got to say you know what I'm going to do what the word says I'm gonna think on these things I'm Gonna Keep My Mind stay on him because before you know it you'll be thinking evil now God has put within the believer something that can withstand and fear and that's his love the Bible said that God's love cast out all fear the power of God's love will cast out all fear now now my love your love doesn't cast out all fear now we've seen this before some some mother some father trying to bring Comfort to their child because they're afraid of something and they grab them and they hold them and they say oh everything's going to be okay and somebody just got shot somebody just got killed and they're saying everything's going to be okay we as humans we canot give our love to somebody that's going to cast out all fear but what you can give is God's love now that love can cast out all fear as Christ laid down his life for us he called us to lay down our lives for others and there's power in the love of God if you want more power we simply just need to seek more of the Holy Ghost because the love of God is shed abro in Heart by the Holy Ghost which is given to us fear has no place inside the believer's heart in fact with the love of God you can say I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me but with fear you sometimes maybe can't feel he can get out of a wet paper bag are you with me you know what I'm saying can't seem to hand on anything so we need to discipline oursel to put the word of of God first in our life I can do all things through the love of God through Christ he's the one that strengthens me I'm not able to take you through but I do believe that God through the office that he ordained can do it and you know it's all about I we so bad want to be like Christ right and I'm all for that but I am not for trying to make us like Christ we just need to become Christ to be honest I just get full more of God not try to not try to make ourself more like God but recognize we need to die out so we could become more like Christ brother Bon said in the message the everpresent water from The Rock he said and when we die our souls will go under the altar of God he said where I had where I was privileged to see a few mornings ago as you know in the vision where the Bible speaks of our spirits will go to God who gave it and our bodies shall return to the dust of the Earth but someday when the scripture is fulfilled our spirits will be released from God and pick up our souls and the soul to the body and the power that will raise us up is right in us now we got something in us that we don't realize we are now in Heavenly places we are now in the power of the Resurrection if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters of God would create them a world out there and go live a private life on it you you have the power in you to do it if you got a shadow of the power of God in you you've got power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it he says there you are now this is important because I want to I'm talking about the love of God if we've got power in us to go create a world and we know God is not in his word for us to go do that you understand but it is in his word for us to lay down our lives like he did for others so we got that power to do that you understand where I'm going with this to build your faith that's what the power is in the church now but it is controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it it's a law of Faith Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours every place that The Souls of your feet can set upon by faith God gives it to you amen he said it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you see what I mean the power is control by dot dot dot if you are a son of God a daughter of God that's that never leaves you oh I love that that never leaves you have a bad day it's still there it's with you at all time all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there I just say if you've got God you've got love and if you got love you got all the power that you need because there's no greater power no greater power because that power actually came down and saved you and me we have the scripture to love one another we've got the power to do that there's power in God's love power to overcome power to be patient power to be longsuffering power to be forbearing power to to go the second mile to to forgive others we got that power in us but just like we don't recognize that we have that power to create a world and go live on it we've got the power inside of us to create an atmosphere inside of us that we can love we can just get rid of our love and love with the love of God and it makes a difference God's love has power to lay down if God laid down his life then that same love inside of us can give us Grace as it did Jesus right father if it's possible let this cup pass from me he laid he said that he says that's why the father loves me because I lay down my life I mean if we want to find greater favor with God we got to lay down our life and I'll just say like this we've got if we've got power to lay it down we've got power for the resurrection amen our life our love barely lays down its own life for ourselves you know a lot of times we just get lazy we don't care most of the time we're looking for somebody else to lay down their life for us right fix this do this do this but John said in 1 John 3:16 hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren I want you to think when was the last time you laid down your life I am not asking you when was the last time you did something for somebody because that's not what the scripture says it's easier for me to go do something than for me to lay down my life it takes the love of God in a human being to be willing to lay down their life for others but this is the standard this is what God has for us God's love inside of us is so powerful it can esteem others better than himself it can bear all things endure all things overcome all things it can bless them that curse you that persecute you that say all matter of evil against you the love of God in you can say I forgive you but you know what our love has to kind of let's figure this out because they kind of you know I remember they did that to me you know and I just I just know I just know they're going to do it again so you know what I'm just going to leave it between them and God you know what you just said God's not in you and you don't even realize it because God in you is the same yesterday today and forever he's never going to tell you to forgive somebody 7 time 70 if he ain't going to do it himself in fact I'll use you as an example how many times have you fallen and look you're still here with the testimony that God forgave you that his blood is still as powerful well what was that blood that that blood was motivated by a love it's the love that was behind that blood that forgave us and set us here today just perfectly clean in the sight of God and God is just saying I want you to do that for one another I want you to do it for one another I I I don't want you to do it to where you think they're they're worthy of it but I want you to do it for those that you don't think are worthy that's right for those that don't use you why that you could be just like your heavenly father children just like your father I'll say this love is real just as the love of God quickened us together with Christ made us raise together caus us to sit together in Heavenly places with Jesus it changed our life basically did it not it was the love of God that changed our life that Same Love inside of us has the same power to help to lay down his life for others and to help others who are in a need of healing as Moses was lifted up in the wilderness so shall the son of man be lifted up if I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto me I'll tell you let God inside of you love be lifted up anybody can love those that love them Jesus said any anybody can be a friend to a friend but to love those that need a perfect love I I'll just say when you do conect with somebody that you can love with a perfect love you are sitting in a place that very few people sit God did not call us to be people down here on the planet that all we do is walk around with some badge saying I'm a Christian or I'm in the message God has called us to live a life he called us to live the message the prophet came to tell us what the real message is this is the real message he opened the book to us it's an open book we know what it means when he tells us to lay down our life we we must lay down our life so Christ can live inside of us God's love is shed abroad by the Holy Ghost I'll say every time we have an opportunity to get more Holy Ghost we ought to seek it I think this thing of well you know I'll just seek the Lord in my home and then you're at home it don't happen and then you say when I get to church I'll do it and then you get to church and you don't do it I tell you we need to take time is running out I'm running out of time to change I'm I'm running out of time for my nature to change and I need to take advantage I need to yield my life to him brother Bram taught us when love projects He said Sovereign Grace takes over I want to say it like this when love projects God takes care of the situation when love goes out and it's it's projected brother brandham says then it meets the object of what that love was intended for and meets the need all we have to do is to project love not as selfish love not I just want to do my bare bones minimum but give your all because it takes all to heal people it took god- giving everything to get healing for our souls now we can't save anybody but God in us can and they that win souls is wise and I say they that heal they that are willing to be lifted up in other words not their love but God's love in them God took the first step towards us when he went to Calvary we didn't even know God we didn't know know we doing he just had a vision and he took the first step towards us and he died for us and he he showed us that we need him we need salvation is only through Jesus Christ and he revealed himself to us and we came to know him through the love of God right it was his love that forgave us that we got to know God and he filled us with that love and I remember at the beginning I tell you I wanted to tell everybody I wanted to tell everybody what happened to me my life was changing and I'll tell you when others need you God is not asking you to wait till they come to you asking for help God is asking you to go out to them and lay down your life for them just like he did that's what it means Christ in you will do the same thing that he did 2,000 years ago he's the same yesterday to his character is not going to change now this I want to say after God revealed himself after he revealed himself he took the first step that he saved us you know what he said now if you want more of me you're going to have to take the first step you're going to have to draw nigh draw nigh unto God and he'll draw nigh unto you because it's a relationship it's not all God do for me it's us it's us doing for God and when we go draw nigh to God God is there's something inside of God that's saying you know I want you to be more like me I want you to do this this is what I'm going to have you do and he speaks that to you in prayer he shows it to you when you're when you're hearing the word when you're listening to a message something is being spoken and then you just say yes Lord and you know what that is when you obey that you know what you're doing you're drawing nigh to God drawing night to God isn't just praying that's the beginning but when he speaks to you and tells you what to do and you do it that's you draw a n to God God promised to draw a n to you take that first step towards others some having compassion making a difference the love of God constrains us it's a love relationship Jesus said a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that you love one another and by this this love all men uh shall all men know you that you're my disciples in other words you're part of the family it's that one characteristic that knows that you are attached to God is the love of God is being able to love like God loves and I'll tell you this is a challenge for us but what I want us to do is I want us to actually start trying to do it and you got to stretch it I mean if you want to build your muscles you got to stretch right you want to get stronger you got to start exercising faith is the same way I'm gonna say this love is the same way love ain't going to be a gift it's not if it was then why don't we all have it you you you you've got to exercise it in other words you wait till the next time somebody doesn't do just something perfect but genuinely love them it's okay if they don't love you back what matters is that you're exercising loving like Jesus did because that's what he said John 158 herein is my father glorify that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples as the father have love me so have I loved you continue in my love so that's what we just saying if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I kept my father's Commandments and abide in his his love now these things have I spoken unto you that your joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you and greater love have no man than this in other words we're going to keep practicing brother Dennis until we lay down our lives for our friends you just keep practicing it until you can do it you can't find a greater love than this if you want to prove how much of God's love you have well I say do not use your mouth use your life let your life bring forth the fruit that God is asking for amen Greater Love have no man this and a man laid on his life for his friends you are my friends if you do whatsoever I have commanded you you got just a couple more minutes has anyone seen the Paris Olympics this year one who's not participating in this um event two three four five okay thank you it's been some pretty stiff competition pretty stiff competition in these Olympics have you ever watched Olympics before you you've got the the the best of the best and they're competing against one another who who can win all these so many different types of events I mean some of them I've never even heard of before but they're competing it's stiff competition it's even comments are even going on the internet about downgrading others and how great certain ones are just trying to make others feel like less than what they are because they won are you with me and and and Olympics is is is about the gold it's about the it's about the silver it's about the bronze it's about it's about who's got the most is it is it is it is it is it China is it is it America is it Russia I don't think they're in it this year but you understand I'm trying to say it's who has the the most who's the greatest you know what I really love I love the spe Special Olympics we've all heard the stories we've seen the clips these these kids that are got something wrong with their lives that they they they they're not as normal as is what we would say you and I are and they'll just they'll line up on the race getting ready to go wait for that gun and they all take off just as fast as they can and you know it's like there's it it's it's it's just not the same as the the Paris Olympics but they're going they're going so fast and they're they're getting ready to cross the line and they they notice one of their fellow Runners has fallen and instead of just finishing the race right there and winning they stop and they go back you know what they do they forget about winning and they're picking up someone else who had fallen they get them up and they walk welcome to the Finish Line you know these people who we call special I'll tell you what makes them special is they don't have so much self centeredness inside of them they don't care about themselves as much as people who are out without problems and I think that's the same way it is with those who are filled with the love of God it's not about themselves it's about others Jesus said in Matthew 20:25 but Jesus called them on called them unto him and said you know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that that they that are great Authority upon them but it shall not be so among you we're just getting it out of our discip iple ship okay but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister and whosoever be the be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to minister unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many see it wasn't just the the job of Jesus to give his life a ransom for many God is calling us to give give our life for others just simple everyday stuff lay down your life for others we've got to bring them to Christ that's the job we got to get them across the Finish Line we got to see them through and you know who it it's you think about it the ones that came back to get this are the only ones that were thinking about others we got to think about others and it's so much easier to do when you're not thinking about ourselves amen amen let's stand together I think of that story and I'm thinking that is a real fire that's a real fire you know when you feel the love of God it does something to warm your heart we don't ever want to underestimate the power of God's love to minister healing to others I tell you I've experienced it I have seen it and it is real and I want more of it amen amen let's sing that that chorus make me a servant a servant of love that's a good way of looking at that a servant of love Paul said he was a prisoner of love and amen make me a servant humble and me Lord let me lift up those who are we and may the prayer of my heart always be make me a servant make me a servant make me a
