TRANSCRIPT
========================================
she had a very terrible attack today in her face one that she hasn't had in such a long time a very long time years i think she made mention and just put her a little bit uh under it can really wear on you mentally amen pain in the face is is like the most terrible terrible thing she's reminded me a couple times of it being like a suicide illness and i know she'd want to be here tonight but she's not filmed well amen well we're going to continue on questions and answers tonight and have a little a bible study around a question let's look to the lord in prayer and ask his blessings before we start our heavenly father we thank you that you've given us strength and health to be here in church knowing that others haven't been able to make it and lord we want to give you thanks for that

meet with her today with faith we ask give you praise now for all this we ask in jesus christ's name amen amen second corinthians chapter number three and we're going to read the first six verses there do we begin again do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistles of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in fables of tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through christ to god's word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who has made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life amen god bless you you may be seated we say amen to the word of god amen we want to have for a subject overcoming walls when witnessing overcoming walls when witnessing and the question our fifth question here is how to overcome a wall when you want to witness to someone but you always seem to hit a roadblock to actually speak to the person about the lord i'm going to read it again how to overcome a wall when you want to witness to someone but you always seem to hit a roadblock to actually speak to the person about the lord do you want me to read it again are you going to say amen okay i'm paying attention to you i just want you to know that i'm not up here by myself we're together now i will say this um i love these questions um because they help us get get answers to become better for the lord now some questions um can be taken a couple of different ways or a few different ways so the more specific we could be about our questions so more will be able to accurately answer them for us so keep that in mind next time we do have uh questions and answers and if i do say something that when we do bring up one of the questions that you ask because i really don't know who's for the most part they are unless somebody says something um and we don't quite hit it right you know please come and talk to me we can have another chance to get what you really mean but as we were reminded last wednesday the way we conduct our lives and how we handle situations in front of others is a witness to others brother branham made mention this statement and questions and answers he said just live your sermon let your life be your pulpit let your life be your pulpit so we all of a pulpit at that point to minister from we're ministering out from us amen but the brother or sister here is referring to actually speaking to a person about the lord so we talked about our life being a witness but this person is actually talking about speaking to this person about the about the lord this person has a desire to witness but there's a road block there is a wall that's standing in the way from them actually doing the witnessing the answer to how to overcome this depends on what the actual roadblock and wall is for instance if the robot is a temporary thing just like when we see roadblocks in on roads the road is is is cut off for a little bit you can't go on it they're doing repair work eventually the road's going to be opened up so a roadblock it could be something temporary and something that is out of our control they got the road shut off we just can't be going through we've got to respect the signs we've got to wait so if this is a situation we have to wait till god removes this the road block it could be somebody's on a different shift you can't quite get with them every time you try you they're they're they're away they think something is keeping uh that's out of your hands keeping you from making the connection and so it's a robot it's a wall and brother branham taught us that we have to just let god open the door let god make the time right uh and and he will if you keep that desire there you keep praying uh he will take care of his part because he's wanting us to do our part ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heavens so there is a a right time for it verse 11 he have made everything beautiful in his time also he set the world in their hearts so that no man can find out the work of god that god maketh from the beginning to the end so every god's got everything under control now while you're waiting for the block to be removed get on to another road and witness to somebody while you're waiting it is the will of god for us to witness to the world and not only that the whole world or the whole heaven is behind us witnessing to the world jesus said work while it's day for the night cometh when no man shall be able to work i i think spirits are getting so dark and heavy and hard it's just hard for people to get motivated you know they're too swallowed up in their own life and their own problems and just their own desires that it it's hard to really work efficiently for the lord and it's getting harder by the day we're living in the closing hours of time we see that iniquity is abounding and love is diminishing as the bible said waxing cold believers are not able to bear the complete word or as we learned endure sound doctrine so it's just getting harder in this age we're told that we're living in perilous times people are mocking your stand for the word they belittle you they make fun of what you believe and as some uh become more relaxed we're becoming more of an oddball because they're wondering why you aren't so relaxed and liberal you're holding on to the word so you're more of an oddball than we were 20 years ago as some believers are fighting over their reputation you just look at a lost brother or a sister and you're trying to help them and and and it's it's just it's just it's odd because people got their own different views and i i i'll say brother mark uh was bringing up a message that brother brandon preached about the door to the doors and brother branham said hard question have you opened every door uh to the lord because most brother brandon makes a statement that most everybody would like uh god to be their their savior and to to keep them from a hell of fire but who is interested in allowing god to control their lives and i think that's where there is such a difference in this hour but but souls are at stake amen we need to be witnessing one soul is worth ten thousand worlds and when brother brennan went beyond the curtain of time and he saw those souls they kept coming to him and they kept saying oh my precious brother it wasn't just one or two but it seemed like everybody viewed brother branham as not just hey bud hey bro but he was a precious brother i want to say today i don't think we should be waiting till we get to the other side to be sharing our precious brother to one another our precious sister to one another i think we ought to feel the same way he felt a love there that he couldn't completely understand he couldn't completely explain it and it moved him to give more of his life to god by having that experience it caused him to change that one visit there made him a different person in the message the rejected king brother adam said there's no way to explain it there's no way i just can't do it but whatever you do friend lay aside everything else to get perfect love get to the spot where you can love everybody even your enemy and everything else so we see this little parties wanting us to go after perfect love but but not just so we can just uh feel that we don't have hate towards anybody not for that purpose just to say we've overcome uh hating somebody no there's a reason for it he said that one visit there to me has made me a different man i could never never never be the same brother branham as was whether the planes are rocking whether the lightning is flashing whether the spy has a gun on me whatever it is it it doesn't matter he said i'm going to press the battle by the grace of god for i preach the gospel to every creature and every person that i can persuading them to that beautiful land yonder so now we're starting to see the motive of love it's not about me it's about hey whatever you do don't miss it lay everything you got going in life lay it aside put it aside and focus on this one thing get to a place where you got perfect love you can love everybody because you will have a burden to get everybody into heaven you want to be a better witness he said it may seem hard it may take a lot of strength i said i don't know how much longer we got and a quote it is the perfect love that will cause us to persuade people to that place in heaven that's why we need to get the love of god amen it's the only way we'll be an effective witness we need to start laying more things aside not saying i've left things aside or i've left more aside than my neighbors or more aside than so and so in the church let's compare ourselves what what brother branham said do we have perfect love if we don't have it then we need to start laying more stuff aside it's like when the boat is you've heard about there's so much stuff in the boat you got to like start getting stuff out of the boat to survive i think we got to just start letting more stuff go so we can get more perfect love amen amen second corinthians chapter 5 verse 11 knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men want to be a better witness get to know the terror of the lord the seriousness of god the repercussions of the lord that will cause you to want to persuade men more to be more of a witness verse 14 says for the love of christ constrainteth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead knows we're not our own anymore we belong to god we're witnessing for him he bought us and by god has become our master we used to be our own master well we thought we were but we're really belong to the devil doing exactly what he wants but now since god bawled us we have a new master yes we're set free from the flesh we're set free from the devil but we have a master that's jesus christ whatever he says we do now if we don't want to do what he says we don't want to do what the devil says we're still doing what the devil wants us to do as long as we're not doing what god wants us to do now outside of your heart your time is the greatest asset that you can give back to god people will give their heart to god but they won't give their time they won't give their money they won't give their resources to extend god's kingdom for his eternal purpose but they say they give their heart when christ redeemed you at calvary he purchased not only your salvation but he purchased your heart which is your life your time your talents your resources everything that you have now belongs to god a new owner amen amen um i am pretty sure i'm pretty sure usually when you buy a company you buy all of it you take the assets and you take the bills you buy the name you buy the whole shebang christ wants all of you amen and he he deserves all of us because he gave all of him for us in the message the queen of sheba brother ben says i'm just telling you that it's not only worth your money it's worth your time your life your devotion and everything you are if it's right your testimony all that you are it's worth every bit of it because it cost what he had to bring it to you colossians chapter 3 verse 1 if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affections on things above none of the things are we have a choice here friends we have a choice where we're going to put our affections our desires what we're going to do with them we either set them on things above or we set them on things of the earth we have to live down here we have to work down here but we don't have to set all of our affections down here for you are dead and your life is hidden with christ so we need to seek things which are above don't feel like you have them seek them seek those things which are above where christ is at where christ is at it's a the right there that there's a responsibility that we all if we don't do that we're either feeling like we already are there no need to seek more or we're just being too lazy either way we don't want to do that in the message god manifesting his gifts brother man says if god is god he's worth everything you are if christian religion is right it's worth everything that you can do for it support your church support your pastor amen amen support your missionaries do everything that's in your power to do and give god the best that you got too often we can make church all about us now church is for us but it's not only for us so bring somebody to church that's where you really prove what you think about church we've been commanded by the chief commander to go yell amen and to all the areas of the world and win souls be a witness to the rest of the world it's not just the pastor's duty it's all of our duty brother brad says do everything that's in your power to do and give god the best you've got if the door is closed right now to one person turn your thoughts towards witnessing to another person don't put all your eggs in one basket keep pressing on for another soul do everything in your power to do god will bless you if you do now one thing we can do to bring more people to church and it's a great way to show our support to the church is when we bring somebody come and see come and see well i'm sick of telling people come and see they don't listen to me so i'm just going to come myself you're losing the vision without a vision the people perish i understand it's not easy but we don't have anything in the scriptures where jesus told his disciples hey just lay loath you know take it easy if that nobody listens to you brother branson in the message why he said they ought to support that church with everything they got in them with their ties with their offerings with anything they're called to do be willing and happy if your pastor asked you to do something in your church you should do it so i was going to get that in bold letters and and make sure that you know when you come in the office this is the first thing that you see not only be willing but he said be happy i love that put your heart into it we believe here in a body ministry it's not just the pastor brother branson the message do you now believe he said now to the laity we can't have a church lest we've got the laity you know the pastor can't do it all it's got to take some members in the church of course we're not all up here at the pulpit but we don't need to be to be of a good church that's functioning what we've got to believe is we what we've got to do is believe what's being said at the pulpit brother said the message god provided away he says go to church every day every day that you can every day that they have service go attend your church be real loyal just stand by your church stand by your pastor help him out with everything you got give him spiritual support fast and pray for him and have faith in him god will lead the church on to that glorious day that we're looking forward to come amen if some of these quotes require responsibility but if we let the devil in the church there will be division it's true our vision here at sunderlight should always be maintained amen and that's for souls to be saved amen this must be our number one priority is to win souls and they that win souls is wise if we move away from this priority we're going to eventually die spiritually i'm just saying it like it is too often as individuals we lose that vision we make church only about us and letting our burden for others kind of slip away brothers we can feel like churches for me to support me and my family and my needs and my wants church should be comforting me and encouraging me and helping me and praying for me and giving to me well that's good that you have a clear a clear view of what church should be for you but we can become so wrapped up in ourselves that we don't use what god has given us to multiply jesus gave us a good parable for that amen don't be afraid of losing what god's given you the only way that you'll lose it is by keeping on holding to it give your time and god will multiply you we don't want to get our priorities out of order brother man says we come to church to find out where we're at with god not to not to prove that we've always been right where we need to be with god notice i'm going to come to church and i'm just going to only thing i want to hear from from the pulpit is that i'm right yes i understand that we come to receive great blessings from the lord that's why we come to church but a great blessing is being able to move forward in god's will god is wanting us to move forward he told the children of israel when they were crying when they were ready to die when they were facing death when everything was against him there was no hope and god told moses to tell him tell the children of israel to move forward amen and they're like what do you mean move forward there's nowhere to go believe believe in your situation i don't care what the roadblock would be i don't care what the hurdles would be i don't i don't care what the wall would be move forward it's got to be that way the reason that we can feel like church has come short of us is simply because we've made church too much about us and not enough about him jesus said when you seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness then all other things will be added to us we've got to put god first we got to be interested in what he wants us to do instead of feeling that we always know what he wants us to do how is church going to ever become personal to you if you're already doing what he wants you to do and you're never open to what he wants to show you god unquestionably will use this ministry to bring about perfection i believe that way beyond me god will not let this ministry come short of making a way for us to make a rapture i just don't i just i don't believe that god is faithful to his word and as long as we do not become the head of this church god is going to have his way in the church the problem we should be concerned about is wanting a ministry that fits our flesh that's what we should be worried about a ministry that caters to what we think focus yourself more on the ministry that god has given you since you become a christian what is that the ministry of reconciliation we should be interested in reconciling others to christ you want to get the the heart of god be concerned about others [Music] christ manifested in your flesh reconciling others to christ you taking what you hear from god here and go live in it out there that's what needs to be happening we must get back to god's eternal purpose that's the vision that this church started with years ago by the grace of god we're going to finish the course with this same vision we're not going to get away from it we're not going to go on to something that we think is different or or greater or better the thing that needs to become greater and better is we need to die out and let christ have more of his way but we need to keep the same vision we need to be in love with souls that don't know christ yet in love with our enemies i hope you join forces with me now i'd like to take a different look at these so-called roblox that we seem to hit how to overcome a wall when you want to witness to someone but you always seem to hit a roadblock to actually speak to the person about the lord now what if this wall is only a wall in your mind what if this roadblock is inside of us what if it's a mental roadblock you ever had said that i just like had a mental breakdown a metal black i can't remember what i was going to say what i was going to do why i came in the room while i called you or it's a psychological wall right what if it's a spiritual battle that's happening inside of us keeping us from witnessing being effective it certainly could be and if it is i want you to go through again if you haven't if you already have the series the enemy within because this is really what's happening there is the battle is inside of you the more we can detect what's really happening in our minds the more we're going to be able to defuse the devil and the more we learn to humble ourselves the more we will defuse the devil he won't have anything to work through because we won't be listening to him and eventually we're going to be able to destroy him give him the word and kick them out amen so there is a lot in that now understand that we probably know the basics of this but we need to be practicing it more the more we practice it the better we'll become at it we're in a a constant spiritual warfare whether we know it or not we're in it and we must as soldiers learn to detect the enemy the greatest enemy that we have inside of us so when we hit a mental wall or a psychological roadblock what we're doing is we're facing emotional changes that are happening inside of us for instance we start out with the desire to witness then when it comes time for the rubber to meet the road our emotions keep us from moving forward the desire to witness is there but other thoughts have changed our intentions to move forward now psychological role block is a system of inter-related emotion changed ideas feelings memories and impulses that usually repress and that gives rise to abnormal or pathological behavior i didn't make that up that's something i pulled off the internet but the gist of it is that there's an emotional change in our feelings and our thoughts in our memories and it usually represses something that we once intended to do and gives rise to abnormal behavior so we end up not witnessing like we should be witnessing so what's happening is when we are away from the situation we can easily identify our desire oh yes i went to church i want to be a greater witness i listen to this message i'm just i'm really wanted to win souls for the lord and then when you step into the arena and you engage you're getting ready to engage in this witnessing because of thoughts coming into your head your feelings and emotions go over here and you're thinking all these things and all sudden you don't follow through you start acting abnormal like what am i doing here oh yeah i'm sorry you start backpedaling are you with me have you ever have you ever experienced this okay and this is simply because of negative thoughts that the devil puts in her head he puts thoughts in her head that are very negative these thoughts repress our true desire to witness and gives rise to acting abnormal we could say like paul said when i would go to do good evil is present or how to perform that which is good i can't find it so there's that battle going on right these thoughts that we get from the devil usually generate from some sort of fear some sort of fear about something fear of failure fear of rejection fear being turned down mocked laughed at fear of being looked at at a in a condescending way fear of losing a friendship or or a closeness with somebody and these many fears will manipulate us into an abnormal behavior keeping us from moving forward so i want to keep things simple and trying to find the answers to this don't you god is always hiding in simplicity in other words we will find god and the answer to our situation in a place that we don't think it is all right it's true just like he's coming an hour we think not he's usually hiding in a place we don't think right oh this i don't think i'm really going to get the answer here really god loves hiding in places you don't think right and he's constantly doing that he's not just with the way that we think his thoughts are higher than our thoughts his ways are higher than our ways he's wanting us to humble ourselves and trust him amen and that's where we'll find the true answers for our situations he's hid right in front of us right in front of us god can take simple things and confound the wise why we often miss the answers is because our pride says this is too difficult of a situation for the answer to be so easy yeah that's right so i won't even pay attention to what's being said in church right now because my situation is much more difficult and it takes somebody with a lot more you know intelligence i think the answer must be much more difficult for my situation or else i would have figured it out by now [Music] whereas humility says i could be wrong about how the answer should come i will seek it in a more simple way i will look for where my pride doesn't want me to go i will trust the lord amen second timothy chapter 1 verse 7 timothy battled a spirit of fear just like we all do and paul makes this grand statement in verse 7 for god have not given us a spirit of fear but a power and of love and of a sound mind amen are you happy and thankful for that and he said be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of the lord see that can bring a fear yeah you get ashamed of how you got to dress how you got to act that you got to go to church let you go to church you got to do things that the pastor i should do don't be ashamed of that testimony nor of me in my condition because he was in prison but be thou a partaker of these afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god there's power that comes to the rise when you're in the afflictions of the gospel god is with you so yeah you're suffering but yes you got power i would like to take a a quick look at these if i could power love and a sound mind we are needing power to keep the devil's thoughts from emotionally changing our direction when we go to witness we're needing a power we're needing a power to keep the devil from building psychological walls inside of us that really aren't there but we're believing they're there too often we try to witness without the holy ghost i got this handle i know what i'm going to say i've been thinking about it acts chapter 1 verse 8 but ye shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem judea sumerian the other most parts of the earth god has not given us the spirit of fear but of power so the holy ghost is a power to witness when we're being led of the holy ghost to witness we will have power to overcome anything the devil throws at us and we won't be using excuses all the time is the difference between us witnessing and trying to do our best versus lord i'm serious about this fill me up the holy ghost so i can get your job done amen we need power to overcome the spiritual warfare that's happening inside of us second corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal so what are we going to do we've got to pull down the strongholds we do that through god in other words i am not going to believe these lies that are being spoken to me these thoughts that are leading me to fear and all of a sudden i just can't move forward casting down it's just an imagination and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god well that could be as simple as well i just don't got time to witness i'm so busy and bring into captivity every thought to witnessing for christ you see i'm just kind of applying this scripture in this manner i hope that's okay and having a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled god wants us to witness so we got to revenge that disobedience be ready to take that devil on and say it doesn't matter i ain't letting anything stand in my way i'm going to be obedient to what the lord wants me to do we really need the power of the holy ghost and life to follow through peter and all the the disciples were good examples of that they wanted to be some great witness for the lord and they they came to church you know so gung-ho in the flesh and wanted to be great and show who was what and when it came down to it they couldn't stand the test they couldn't be the witness that they really wanted to be and it's so glad that we don't have to learn that same thing we can just get serious about waiting on the lord and get the power of the holy ghost just get serious about that amen well brother john i already have the holy ghost so what's my problem the problem is we need the power of the holy ghost in our flesh that's what the problem is it's not a matter of do you have the holy ghost or don't you have the holy ghost it's a matter is the power of the holy ghost permeating out of your body and if it is you got what you need and if it isn't ask for god to come and have his way is that it's that simple amen don't make it complex god is hidden in simplicity paul got to the place with the holy ghost where he said none of these things move me he was willing to suffer and go through everything nothing was a roadblock or a a a a wall to him he let them do whatever they wanted to do to him and he still stayed there as a witness testifying of the power of god how it can change a man's life what greater witness could that be i'd rather have that than ever stand behind a pulpit i'd rather have it than ever stand behind a pulpit it's the life of christ in human flesh again we not only need power to overcome but we need love amen it's not giving us the spirit of fear but a power and of love the love of god romans chapter 5 verse 5 tells us that the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by what the holy ghost god has not given a spirit of fear but a power and of love it comes love comes with the holy ghost you know the problem so much with that doctrine that got hatched out if i got the holy ghost because i spoke in tongues or i did this or i did that what about i love what if i can love my enemy because the love of god is should have brought in our heart by the holy ghost which is given unto us i i didn't give our sister uh a number of scriptures at the end because i just wasn't ready for him but so we're going to put her to the test second corinthians chapter 5 verse 14. ii corinthians chapter 5 verse 14 for the love of christ constrainteth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead are we dead are we alive and that he died for all that they which live should not hands forth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again that's where i want to get to wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth no we him we we we know him no more so i want to say this we know christ by the spirit that lives inside of us by knowledge not by understanding but by a living experience we can't know christ outside of a born-again experience yes we can get certain revelations and we can have certain experiences and we can testify that our shoes didn't wear out and that he gave us water out of the brook and we can have experiences but those things that happened to them never made them so solid that they were going to go into the promised land so those things are not what we're looking for the bride is not looking for that right we're looking for christ inside of us because he's going to take us into the promised land he's going to take us into a rapture he's going to perfect us he's going to bring us to the statue of a perfect man he's going to get us on top therefore if any of us are in christ we're different we're absolutely 100 percent different we're a new creature all the old things you're passed away behold all things have become new we're no longer doing the witnessing amen in the message a man running from the presence of the lord brother bran said this statement it's a constant burning of the fire and the love of god in the heart that sets you a fire and puts you out yonder with people making converts to christ i'll say it's hard to witness without the love of god something has got to allow you to stand there and get the tomatoes thrown at you get all different things happening to you but you just want to bring them to christ it's a love of god that's it's in your heart it's a constant burning brother branham said it isn't just well i'll take five minutes i'll take 10 minutes and then the rest of the day i'll just do what i want to do you just can't get rid of it now i'll say if it's not there you we just need to spend some time with god amen with the thought process of god i want you to become more in my life i want to have more of your holy spirit i want your holy spirit to have more of the preeminent i want to be about the father's business i want to get back where i was at one time with you this is what has to happen amen we shouldn't have to wait to ask to come to the altar what we should do is be listening to what the holy ghost is telling us well i'll just do it when i get home okay i want you to do when you get home but are you doing it when you get home right get it do it to the point where you're you're constantly on fire you're bringing people to church you're witnessing to everybody this is what needs to happen one of the things that they overcame the devil with in revelations chapter 12 remember they overcame by the blood of the lamb the word of the testimony and they love not their lives unto death so you've got either your love is for yourself right parts for christ there's the battle to whom you spend your time with where you're going love not your lives unto death that's hard amen that's right that's really truly hard we're all bombarded with i'm just going to give this a little bit i'm going to do this one thing and i feel like i've got my days duty-in second timothy 1 7 for god have not given us the spirit of fear but a power and of love and a sound mind amen god gives us a sound mind he gives us a stable mind a controlled mind by the holy ghost a sound mind comes from god not double minded not one minute i want to witness in the next minute there's a roadblock right true now the reason i'm saying it like this is we need to stand up against the devil who one minute we want to go in the right direction and in the next minute our our emotions are changing our our thoughts are changing our feelings are changing and we can't even figure out what's going on god is not the author of confusion god has given us a sound mind we understand that we may get rejected we understand we may get tomatoes thrown at us we understand the negativity and the consequences that are moving that come along with being a witness but it doesn't stop us from witnessing i don't know if i'm ready for that yet okay okay okay just let god know when you want to be because that's what he's called us to lay it all down that one visit behind the curtain of time made brother branham a different man amen just ask god to give you a little visit come and visit with you come and show you the value of one soul i'm sure if we were all able to go there and we saw somebody there that we won to the lord and they said you know if it wasn't for you i wouldn't have been here today think those thoughts you you notice none of them said you know you had to go through a lot to get me to get here but i finally got here it's over the battle's over my precious brother oh my precious brother we wouldn't be here without you focus on the result not what you got to go through to get there amen it'll be worth it all right our opening scripture not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves for our sufficiency is of god so when we're thinking about witnessing and we're thinking about this psychological wall or this this uh hurdle in our mind it's not us doing the witnessing right it is god in us doing the witnessing so our sufficiency isn't of ourselves to do it we just gotta learn to get out of the way and trust god trust god that he will use us to bring forth the beautiful love and grace of jesus christ to others who also have made us able ministers we're able we're able to win we're able to witness not of the letter but of the spirit see the holy ghost inside of us the letter kills but the spirit gives life we've all witnessed that we've all been guilty of that we use the letter we use the the truth of the word but we're not using the love of the word supposed to speak the truth in love so we need the spirit that's what gives life in our witnessing amen and i tell you when you've got the love of god in your heart you've got the spirit of god you've got the power of god nothing is going to stand in your way because you really don't care what people think about you you don't care what's going to happen to you because of what you're doing the only thing that you're focusing on is how you can help that person that's all that matters because that's what god looks at god is not looking at is it going to hurt jesus when he goes to the cross or is it going to hurt paul to get these stones thrown at him no he came out right out and said it pleased the father to ruse him he told paul hey you're going to suffer many things to be a witness for me so we can expect it because it isn't about how easy our flesh gets it it's about winning that one person whatever it takes to the lord i tell when i stand before the lord i don't want to be guilty of not caring for souls being so stuck in my own life that i thought what i'm doing is more important i don't want to be i don't want to be there i'll be guilty of a lot of stuff but i don't want to be guilty of that right brother branham said that the word is going to become flesh again i like how first john chapter 3 says it and this is not the king james version but if you want to put that up first john chapter 3 verse 2 my beloved now are we the sons of god and hitherto it have not appeared what we are to be doesn't appear as it appeared but we know that when he shall appear we shall be in his likeness and we shall see him as he is and everyone that has this hope in him he purifies himself as he is pure well this sounds like the very same desire that god had in the beginning when he made man let us make man in our image he has the same desire to see his image in humans so while he's wanting that what are we wanting the word will become flesh again the only question that remains to be seen is who will let the word of god drop from their head to their heart because up here there will not be any manifestation but when it drops down here it becomes a love affair we are not sufficient of ourselves to witness anything by ourselves but our sufficiency is of god and god has made us able ministers to witness no matter what stands in our way no excuses you've heard uh the bigger they are the harder they fall i'm determined i've made up my mind i'm going through amen psalms 1 8 or psalms 18 verse 26. no obstacle is too great or a roadblock too great nor a wall too great psalms 18 verse 26 we are we're done we're not gonna be long tonight okay so if you haven't got anything out of the whole service you've got just a few minutes to do it's just a little warning right with the pier thou will show thyself pure but with the forward thou will show thyself forward for thou will save the afflicted people but will bring down high looks for thou will light my candle the lord my god will enlighten my darkness for by thee i have run through a troop and by my god have i leaped over a wall it's not standing in our way as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord has tried he is a buckler to all those that trust in him for who is god save the lord or who is a rock save our god it is god that girdeth me with strength and maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet like hein's feet he sitteth me upon the high places he teacheth my hands to war think about that he's teaching us tonight how to war so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms amen they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength amen thou has also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand have holded me up and thy gentleness have made me great his gentleness thou has enlarged my steps under me that my feet did not slip i have pursued my enemies that's inside of you i have pursued my enemies and have overtaken them neither did i turn again to they were consumed amen god bless you let's stand together i hope some things have been said to help overcome the walls when witnessing amen let's sing lord i have started i'm going through i am going through
