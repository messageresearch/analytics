he lives amen may the Lord bless you richly we appreciate brother John allowing us to come up this way we always enjoy coming don't seem like we get up this way enough but every time we do we enjoy it and thank you for the food and the room and all that was done to to make us feel welcome while we're here may God richly bless you if you have your Bibles this morning turn with us to the book of Luke want to read from Luke Chapter 2 uh starting at verse 8 and may the Lord just help us this morning be our prayer the Bible says this and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone around about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for and you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths lying in a manger and and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will towards men and it came to pass as the Angels were going away from them into heaven that the Shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us aren't you glad the Lord has made it known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and a babe lying in a manger and Mary might have said something like this how did you know we were here said the angel told us what to look for that's right may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word I want to speak to for a few minutes this morning if it's all right on if there had been no Christmas if there had been no Christmas Heavenly Father we love you today today Lord thank you so much for all that you've done for us we submit oursel in this congregation into your hands For Your Glory bless your children this morning we ask in Jesus name Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated you know I guess it was the week before Thanksgiving that I first started hearing the songs in the stores the songs of the Season It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year year Christmas and Christmas to so many people means so many things Christmas to some means a Santa Claus and reindeer and elves to others it means family and Gatherings and food and laughter to others it's a depressing time because of memories of better Christmas has G by or because they don't have the means to provide gifts for their family and their friends but is that all Christmas really is is just a festive holiday just some kind of an event but you see all real Christians knows what the world has made Christmas isn't Christmas at all Christmas is not a celebration but it should be a day of worship Bible readers know that the word Christmas is not even mentioned in the bible but the birth of Jesus is mentioned and we understand that the prophet was not against the true meaning of Christmas but he was against commercializing it for he had this to say about Christmas now it looks like everybody's singing songs about a white Christmas and praying for the same and we may have it it looks like this keeps up we may have the white Christmas and Christmas is the time of year he said I just wish it could be Christmas all the time everybody seems to be so friendly around Christmas time wanting to help one another and everything and everybody down on the street saying how are you brother and other times of the year they won't even speak to you so it'd be good if it stayed Christmas wouldn't it Christmas all the time and the fact of all air and everything there is he says there's something about it that the world tries to make it an exmas you know they try to take Christ out of the whole thing and we know that to be true I was just getting off the plane here at Detroit just a couple of days ago and as I exited the plane the stst there said happy holidays because to say Merry Christmas is Politically Incorrect but no matter what they try to do to Christmas God is still God of Christmas it's somewhere hasn't he the prophet said he sure has he's got something about it that's just the very name and the thoughts of the birth of the Lord Jesus the world puts a Santa Claus in its place and the the world has made it an exmas and the world has made it a happy holiday but not to Christians to the Christian it's still Christmas we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved all these other things are falling apart America is falling apart Europe is falling apart Asia is falling apart this is more true now than it was when the prophet said it back in the 60s world has fallen apart but we are in a kingdom Hallelujah an eternal Kingdom that it cannot be moved for Christmas is every day I told Brother John when I was a young man started preaching they said if you say what the prophet said you'll do well I told Brother John I find out the more I say what the prophet said people get mad at you true but this is what he said where Christmas is every day living in the presence of the king amen don't have to guess about it it's the truth it's God's truth it's God's complete truth he said how I love him for this how good he is to us he said so I appreciate all your prayers and by God's help and Grace a very Merry Christmas to every one of you remember my saying this is not Santa Claus this is Jesus Christmas is for Jesus you see Christmas Means Christ Christmas Means Christ and we were writing last night showing the kitties all the house is decorated and everything which is awful nice but I thought if I had anything on my house that I ever wanted to write it would be a neon sign saying trusting Christ will be in your Christmas that's right put Christ back in Christmas now we all know that Jesus was not born in December the prophet Tau us that he was born sometime in early April or May but the prophet said what difference does it make whether whether it's the December or whether they do it in July or August or whenever it might be that they would designate a time set aside he said it's still a sacredness of remembering that God gave us the hope that we have within us what is Christmas Christmas is the fulfilling of a promise that God made us the Bible said You shall bring forth a son and that shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins all this was done that it might be fulfilled which is spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth the son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God With Us amen remembering what Christmas did for us and as I was thinking about this and this thought of Christmas then this thought came to me what if there had been no Christmas anybody ever think of that if there had been no Christmas and that's my thought this morning for just a few minutes if there had been no Christmas you say wait a minute brother darl the prophet of God said Jesus never pointed to his birth he pointed to his death the cross and that's exactly the truth Amen in fact the prophet said he never even pointed to Christmas but you see he could not die in the flesh if he wasn't born In the Flesh and if there had been no Christmas that would have been no Calvary amen if there had been no Christmas there would have been no burial if there had been no Christmas there would have been no Resurrection amen if there had been no Christmas there had been no lifting of the curse off of humanity for God the Creator created the first Adam without father or mother that's right and if there had been no Christmas there would have been no second Adam because of the Fall there had to come a second Adam who would be created without an Earthly father or mother you said oh brother darl what about she was an incubator that carried God's seed amen so there had to come someone without an Earthly father or mother that would be on the same basis as the first Adam to restore us back again if there had been no Christmas there would have been no breaking of the room oh my amen think about that if there had been no Christmas there had been no breaking of the womb to lift the curse off of mankind Jesus born of a woman made fashioned like sinful flesh and there to take the sting of death he had to die like a mortal to take away our sins and on that first Christmas morning when Christ was born what was it God the Creator created a second Adam the love of God that God had for Adam in his race how God unfolded himself and became a Christmas package Christmas Means Christ and when Adam left the garden because of sin God said Adam I'll bring you back I'll bring you back home you'll be home by Christmas Hallelujah for Christmas Means Christ and by Christ Adam I will bring you back home amen had first Christmas Shepherds in their fields I received a visitation from angels that told him of this great gift that was given to the world and where they could find the place where the word was made flesh deity revealed in humanity you will find him in a Manger wrapped in swaddling cloth that package didn't look like much it had no beauty that we should desire him but the greatest thing that was ever wrapped in human flesh was w in it God himself wrapped his own self in a Christmas package and sent it to the World the greatest Christmas gift did not come from Amazon Hallelujah it came from God Amen the first one the greatest one the only true original Christmas package if there had been no Christmas this package would have never been delivered Emmanuel God With Us making a way to be God in us for he just didn't want to be above us he just didn't want to be with us but he wanted to be in us if there had been no Christmas there would have been no peace where he said Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your hearts be troubled neither let it be afraid if there had been no Christmas there would have been no love for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that so whoever so believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life and this was manifested the love of God towards us because God that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him amen if there had been no Christmas there would have been no savior a savior for my unbelief amen and your unbelief a savior to save us from ourselves yes we needed saving from ourselves where God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved amen if there had been no Christmas there would have been no second birth Christmas is not a pagan celebration to us it's a sacred hour if there had been no Christmas there had have been no Resurrection there'd been no Christmas there'd be no love there'd be no peace there'd be no Hereafter for the believer if there' been no no Christmas if there had been no Christmas there would have been no fulfillment of the coming of Messiah spoken by the prophets of old if there had been no Christmas there would have been no super sign for what did Christmas give us it gave us an everlasting sign Jehovah God became man and took our stock crossed himself from God and become a man there's the sign the prophet said he was God he was he was God and became a man not rich man but a poor man this is the super super sign you asked for a sign God said I'll give you a sign a super sign what was the Super sign God manifested in flesh and what is that super sign in this hour God manifested In the Flesh of his bride amen making himself the same yesterday today and forever amen I'll give you one an everlasting son he could have come otherwise as I said a baby but why did he become a baby when that first little toothless mouth opened in the manger on that first Christmas morning in his little manger crib and the first little yell that went from his voice that was God crying Jehovah crying a man come from God and was a man ever WI a man come to the world with nothing but still man what was he trying to do what was he purposing he cried like a baby in the manger he played like a boy on the street he T like a man but yet he was Emmanuel this is the super sign God dwell in in the creation that he created this is the super sign God dwelling in the creation that he created oh my that's the super sign it shall be a sign unto you and on that first Christmas morning what did it do it was an eternal sign to the believer God With Us the super sign he said do you see it God made manifest God presented himself to the world as a fugitive he going to come some other way but he chose to come this way right if there had been no Christmas there would have been no revealing of the name of God Moses said in Deuteronomy the Lord thy God shall raise unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy Brethren liken unto me unto him shall ye hearken but he never gave us his name Isaiah said For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the everlas Las in Father the Prince of Peace therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and call his name Emmanuel God With but none of them gave us his name but on that first Christmas what happened an angel came with a message revealing the family name of God behold Thou shalt be conceived in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus oh that great person of the Lord Jesus he was Jehovah God enveil in flesh the Bible said whatever you do in word indeed do all in his name the Bible said the whole family in heaven it's named Jesus the whole family on Earth it's name Jesus we pray in his name we teach in his name we die in his name we're buried in his name we're baptized in his name resurrected in his name go to heaven in his name that's the name and his bride is named mistress Jesus amen he'll take a people out of the Gentiles for his name's sake and if there had been no Christmas where would we be today where would we be right here at this moment if there had been no Christmas we'd have been alienated from God with no way back that's right lost in the darkness of Le oosa for if there had been no Christmas there would have been no light for Jesus said as long long as I'm in the world I am the light of the world but there but there was a Christmas oh thank God there was a Christmas not a sled not a reindeer not a Santa Claus not a myth not a celebration not a holiday but a reality a promise kelp it's good tidings of great joy what shall be to all people a sacred power of worship for what God has done for us listen you may not get much for Christmas this year your family might be able to buy you much for Christmas this year but I'm telling you if you can receive what I'm telling you this morning you will receive the greatest gift that anyone could ever receive you don't you don't have to turn it back you don't have to send it back because it don't fit because it's a wrong Hallelujah it'll fit everyone of us amen clothed in his righteousness amen what is Christmas it is the Fulfillment of what God promised Adam in his race he shall bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall save his people from their sins and all this was done might it when it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying bold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son shall call his name Emmanuel which is interpreted god with us because there is a Christmas there is light there is hope there is peace there is love there is Joy there is a promise for the Hereafter because there is a Christmas there is a Reconciliation you Jesus the Bible says in second Corinthians and all things are are of God who hath reconciled us unto himself by Jesus Christ and have given to us hath given to us the Ministry of reconciliation for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and you that were sometime alienated enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled thank you Jesus alienated alienated means to make unfriendly hostile indifferent especially where he was attached forly existed especially where an attachment formally existed you were once attached but you were alienated from the attachment separated how how was we separated by Adam's fall we were alienated separated where we were formerly attached that's why Jesus said all that my father ha given me will come and no man can pluck them out of my hand Amen to reconcile means to completely reconcile the back again to bring back to a formal Harmony that you was once in harmony but you were alienated the fellowship was broke but God said Heath reconciled us through Christ amen and now we can be reattached amen amen hallelujah how could this be accomplished how to be brought back to a formal state of Harmony how could that be because there is a Christmas Christmas is Christ God became flesh to reconcile us back to himself the three throw mystery God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in his church altogether to bring back the original Adam and Eve that by Christmas he would bring us all home because everyone one knows there's no place like home for Christmas amise the Lord thank you Lord hallelujah to bring back the original Adam and Eve again a man and woman which are one made out of the same blood and the same spirit and everything else because there is a Christmas you who are separated can be reunited you can be brought back to his side again and now we're in a kingdom a Heavenly Kingdom Heavenly places with an eternal King enjoying an eternal life by an eternal word going to an eternal heaven to forever be with him living in the presence of the king oh my oh my I'm so glad to be one of them aren't you this morning I'm so glad to be dead in Christ and to be alive in the kingdom of God this is not my home we seek a kingom om we seek a king we've already come in the Kingdom the prophet said we're seeking the king to come and the King quickly will come to his kingdom hallelujah hallelujah matter of fact the prophet of God said the only thing lack and I see the coming of the Lord is the Readiness of his church we are in a kingdom an eternal Kingdom that cannot be moved where Christmas is every day because there is a Christmas we get his presence amen play on words not presence presen amen because of Christmas that's right we get his presence Jesus I'm so glad I feel his presence amen this morning you that were separated can now be reconciled by Jesus Christ and we can stay in his presence to return back to the harmony of the father restored fellowship with God his bleach has cleansed us has made us free what a Christmas present amen from our father thank you Jesus because there was a Christmas there was a sacrifice because there was a Christmas there was a Calvary because there was a Calvary there was a death because there was a death there was a burial because there was a burial there was a resurrection and when Christ rose from the dead he said because I live am ye shall live also Merry Christmas what a Christmas present this morning because there was a Christmas there is this Revelation that it's no longer Jesus in a manger but it's Jesus in US amen and I say to you my brother my sister let's make room this Christmas season for Jesus amen don't leave him in a Manger a brother told me if I was going to put a manger scene out in my front yard I just go out there and lay down myself because that's where he's at Christ dwelling in me Christ dwelling in you let the word that was formed in Mary be formed in you receive the real true and only Christmas package Jesus Christ if there had been no Christmas where would we be this morning but oh I'm so glad that there is a Christmas amen not a happy holiday not a Santa Claus not a reindeer but a real Christmas not a celebration but a worship take the time to thank you Lord for what you done for me in this busyness of this time of year everybody rushing here and there just take a moment slip out on your back porch somewhere slip out under the tree in your prayer room amen just take a moment and thank him for the real true Christmas package didn't come from Amazon like I said didn't come from eBay didn't come from Walmart came from God I want to close with this poem I hope I didn't keep you too long but this poem I just think it's so good says if that was no Christmas then where would I be if God's Christmas present wasn't placed on a tree if there had been no Christmas there'd been no guiding star there had been no Angels announcing no wise men from afar if there had been no Christmas there had been no peace on Earth there'd been no Shepherds coming to worship the Christ child's birth if there had been no Christmas what more can I say no hope for man no love today but there is a Christmas I know it's true not Christ in a Manger but Christ in you there is a Christmas God keeps his word I've seen his star his voice I've heard come see Jesus he's on the Earth today he is the truth the life the way yes there is a Christmas my heart proclaims Christmas is Christ and Jesus is his name amen prise the Lord amen do you love him this morning have you received this package it may not look like much to the world I remember when I was a boy we was raised real poor and I wanted a football for Christmas it's all I wanted and I remember this particular Christmas that package was under the tree with my name on it as a kids you know how we were I ripped the paper off and on the box was something else and I was so disappointed cuz I was wantan the football yeah and I remember my mama looking at me and I guess she saw the disappointment on my face and I'll never forget my mama God Rest her soul she said look in the box when I opened it up it was a football and that's what it is with Christ it didn't look like much to the world they didn't want it but if it could only looked in the package and seen what it really was do you love him this morning may the Lord bless you this Christmas season let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord I'm not ashamed of the tears this morning that's on my face because I've always believed you squeeze a man's heart and the juice comes out of his eyes and Lord I'm so grateful this morning what Christmas really beats or the world is so commercialized it they so took it off the rails and made it something that it's not Lord they come to a place in this nation that they can no longer wish one another a Merry Christmas because it's not politically correct so they say a happy holiday but oh God I'm so glad this morning that I'm gathered with wise men and wise women who have seen your Star Lord in the west and we have come to worship you that you have sent the seventh angel messenger that seventh star that was in thy right hand Lord
