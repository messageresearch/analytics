the peace you give us Lord amen amen praise the lord it's good to be with my precious brothers and sisters of the same faith amen and I'll tell you that's important amen because there's only one faith only one Faith well God bless you today if you would turn with me to our opening scripture in the Book of Romans chapter 9 I'm going to start with verse number six good to have brother Mark back amen we've missed you brother Mark as I've repeatedly told you amen amen we want to talk about election and maybe do a couple services on it it's a very a very delicate subject in fact the prophet told us uh that he warned the ministers to stay away from that word predestination and so um but I feel that it's important because the enemy is the author of confusion and he he wants to get in there so I just I Believe by the grace of God we can we can help the elect amen amen so before we begin reading let's approach our heavenly father dear God we're not uh equipped or uh where we don't have what it takes Lord to bring this great subject and we approach you with fear and trembling just knowing what your Prophet had said and how easily these things can be taken by the enemy and bring a confusion into people's mind but Lord you're able by the Holy Spirit to take Thy word and rightly divide this great subject and we pray that you would come and put your blessings upon this this series Lord and we pray that you would give us a a clear understanding Lord of what you would have us as your elect to do to get ready for a Rapture because that's what it's all about father bless the reading of your word now and your quotes and all the things that would be said I pray that you would bless the hearers Lord those that would be hear this this evening and those that would be watching on the live stream and those that would perhaps go back to the archives I just pray that you would bless the hearers of the word father we thank you for these things now we give you praise in advance in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Romans chapter 9 starting with verse 6 and I like what Schofield said here right before verse 6 he says it's the distinction between Jews who are mere natural descendants from Abraham and Jews who are also of the spiritual seed and the word says starting with verse number six not as though the word of God had taken unto the fact for they are not all Israel which are Israel neither because our uh they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed for This Is The Word of Promise at that at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand out of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated amen God bless you may be seated now these are some pretty we think of God as being a a fair loving God which only does good and there's all true statement but how could that same God say I hated Esau and how could he say that um some of the children of Abraham were were not uh uh uh uh uh of of of of the seed and and and he also makes the statement that they which are the children of the flesh are not the children of God so these are like really strong statements brother Branham says in the message why he says my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they don't follow it depends on what's the on the inside of you drawing moving it's the elect always that God speaks to and sends his message to so we can see that when God is bringing forth his word he is speaking to the elect right and the elect will catch it I want us to all of us ask this question today how do we know we are elected how do we know is it because we are in a message church we feel that we've we're elected because we heard the message and we believe the message is true does that make us elected and so that's what this series is going to be for it's going to if not all Jews are Jews not all believers are are Christians and not all that are in the message are elected and so what determines that there are certain things that that we all understand like this there are certain things that the Bible tells us that the elect will do and it's by that that we know whether we're elected that's it forget about how you feel right forget about what you think forget about how God is used you none of that matters what matters is our is our life lining up with the word right first John 5 13 says these things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the son of God that ye may know that you have eternal life and that ye may believe in the name of the son of God so the things that are written in the Bible lets us know whether we have eternal life or not and I believe it's the same way for the elect to whether we know that we're elected because there is a false sense of security about feeling elected so Jesus told us in John 5 39 search the scriptures friend them you think you have eternal life but they are they that testify of me and again the scriptures that we're going to get into are going to tell us whether we're elected or not now we here's the here's the the terrible thing about our feelings our feelings tells us that we're elected no matter what but the scriptures don't say that the scripture says this is what the elect will do this is what the elect won't do right and that's more important than how I feel about myself well the first thing I want to say is we have nothing to do with being elected by God or the elected of God or the chosen of God we have nothing to do with it not one single thing Jesus said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you it has nothing to do with our works but it has everything to do with God First Peter chapter 1 verse 1. First Peter chapter 1 verse one we're just going to try to a little Foundation here Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to The Strangers scattered throughout pontus galatia caspadonia Asia berthania now he says elect according to the foreknowledge of God the father so these strangers this the elective God is scattered they're just scattered all over the world and he's speaking to them Peter is speaking to the elect that are scattered according to the foreknowledge of God in other words God knows them now look there are electrical in the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit the elect go through a process of sanctification that's all there is to it unto what does it take them to that that sanctification takes him to the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied oh I just love these scriptures and um we we God knows whose or his we sit there and we question who's who but God knows and they're scattered throughout the world and God has called you and he's called me to go hunt them down now we can't go up to somebody and say you're elect you're not you're like you're not we don't know but he's called us to bring them the gospel if they are left they will receive the Gospel and they will come out of whatever they're in I'll and they will walk in the light of the word that's just it that's what the elect does they continue to walk in the light as he is in the light he says if you uh uh I know you believe but if you if you you want to be my disciple you got to continue to walk in the word Ephesians 1 verse 4 and 5 here Ephesians verse 1 4 and 5 according as he has chosen Us in him when did this happen before the foundation of the world so way before Adam and Eve way before the world was created that we are we we have been chosen that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love see how the elect we know what the elect will end up being because that's it just we're predestinated to it having predestinated us onto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure of his will now God is going to see his elect through somehow or some way they're predestinated the elect has been predestined to be without spot or wrinkle or any such thing now the point I want to bring here and this is to me a powerful point there will be many things that God will do that only he can do for his elect in other words you can't do it [Music] but he will do that for you because you are his elect and I'm talking about Mighty things he will deliver you out of things because you can't do it I just think that is so beautiful that our God loves us that much to pick us up through the sands of time and take us through situations to deliver us yeah as amazing grace goes through many dangers and tolls and stairs I've already come his grace have brought me safe this far and Grace will lead me home the scripture says he's going to shorten the days or or or we wouldn't make it so another thing that God is going to do that we couldn't do just for us he's doing it just for the elect now there are many things that you will have to do that only you can do and he won't do them for you and just because we're elected doesn't mean we don't have to do them because without us doing those things we can't make it this is how serious it is I'm going to give you an example here II Timothy 2 18. and 219 second Timothy 2 18 19. who concerning the truth have aired saying that the resurrection is passed already and overthrowing the faith of some so we see here that you know Paul is trying to tell Timothy to avoid uh vain babbling and and things that that are not edifying because they take you away from the truth and there was a couple people who were trying to bring some things that were not true and it overthrew the faith of some now think about that they it overthrew the faith of something in other words they have faith at one time following but then they got listening to the wrong things and they got off path now look at verse 19. nevertheless the foundation of God it stands sure has this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his now here's the part we have to do or we can't make it and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity you know there are certain things that God will do for you because you just can't do it but there are certain things he expects his elect to do and we have to do it and this is just one of them our opening scripture we talked about the elect go through the process uh or one of the scriptures that opening scriptures but go through the process of the sanctification of the spirit unto obedience that is something that we have to do God won't do that for us we have to be willing to do what he tells us to do God ain't going to go through that process for us we have to go through it now the devil makes people think they're saved when they're really not there's a lot of people he said many will come to me in that day he makes people think they got the Holy Ghost when they don't he makes people think they're elected regardless of the life that they're living in other words you've heard the whole thing I don't care if I'm wrong or not I'm I still believe what I believe you know they'll do whatever they have to do defend their religion and we're not about defending whether we're in the message or not in the message or the lect or not we're about finding out is my life lining up with the word that's what's important for the bride that's what's important for the elect they're concerned about where they're standing with God you know sometimes we can have the spirit of of uh you know we're unwilling to be um unwilling to be challenged by anybody and a person that's unwilling to be challenged by another person to me is a person who who who doesn't even not willing to take a good look into the word to make sure that he's lining up correctly that's how I feel about that subject because you never know when God is is is using somebody to speak to you now brother Brian said in the message thy loving kindness he says oh what a miserable thing it is the devil perverts those things he makes you think you're living when you're dead and the scripture talks about it but he's saying here the devil makes people feel and think certain things and it's up to us to take a look at the reality is is my life is it is it paralleling with that word says I what the elect should be doing and these services are going to be dedicated to helping us see and Inspire us to follow the word of what the elector going to do instead of just being comfortable with just saying I'm alive uh you know because you can go on that path for so long that you don't even care about anything else in the message the invisible Union of the Bride brother Branham says this Miss Grace I'm going to talk about you know the Bible declares said to the elect lady that if you notice elect it comes from the word elected lady one lady amongst all the other ladies was elected and that's what I just want to say to me if I'm truly elected if I am the bride I ought to be the most grateful person in the world because I had nothing to do with it it was him that chose me and it should put me in such a space as a place that I'll do whatever you want me to do Lord so trying to really decipher whether we're elected or not can be confusing have has anybody ever battled that before absolutely you can know if you're elected by faith only it's by faith what brother John you just got done telling me that my my life has to line up with that word that's exactly it you have to believe that that word is really requiring you to live that life It Is by faith it's the only you have to believe so much that you bring your body under subjection to what that word says first Thessalonians 1 4 says knowing brother beloved your election of God knowing Brethren beloved your election of God I believe you can know I believe you can really really know not just feel not just say but really really know Galatians 3 7 says know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham so here it is you're a Seed of Abraham through faith because that is the seed it it wasn't well we'll get into it but it wasn't of uh the efforts that Sarah and Abraham made you know to get a son and and and that was going to be the seed because that wasn't of I believe what your word says Lord I believe that your promise said this that was the seed are you with me second Peter chapter 1 verse 10 wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and your election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall but if you don't do them what's going to happen what do you tell Cain what God tell Cain hey if you do good you'll be accepted but if you don't sin lies at the door not all that are called Jews are Jews not all Israel is Israel not all Christians are Christians and not all that call themselves bride are the elect of God truth all right let's go to our opening scripture now and then we're gonna I just want to take my time with this if I could Romans 9 verse 7 neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called hmm hmm it's called John chapter 8 verse 31. Jesus is is telling the Jews which had believed on Jesus to a point but not all the way but to a point he said if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and look what they said here they they answered him we be Abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how says Thou ye shall be made free see they didn't even realize that their own lustful desires inside of them they were a prisoner to their their own nature right true and Jesus answered them verily I say unto you whosoever committed sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son to buy it for forever if the son therefore shall make you free shall be free indeed verse 37 I know he says I know you're Abraham seed but you seek to kill me because my word have no place in you so he's he's responding to them that are saying we are Abraham's seed and he said yes I know you're Abraham seed but you seek to kill me so now he's going to get into rightly dividing which CD is of the flesh or of the spirit he says I speak that which I have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father and of course they weren't you know they were they were not thinking they were they were still thinking Abraham they answered and said unto him Abraham is Our Father and Jesus saith on him if Abraham if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham so I can see where these these Jews were literally just going more confused and more confused as the message was going on [Music] because they they they they already claimed they were Abraham's seed Jesus already said yes you're Abraham seed um uh and and now Jesus is is is speaking about uh uh who who their father is it's almost like when if it was just like this when when Jesus uh when God was speaking to uh the the the these the serpent about um his seed and the and uh the the natural seed uh that that that he laid inside of of of Eve and the other seed that was inside and it talked about those two seeds having enmity with one another and you can see that the natural seed is always fighting against the spiritual seed always there's there's there's just like nothing in them to have peace they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus said If Abraham uh if he were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that have told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham so now he's he's making it clear this this the natural Seed of Abraham just like the the the the 12 uh Patriarchs the the the the the the the the the the children of um Ishmael if I could say it like that are constantly fighting against Israel and it's no different today when we're in the flesh we know this if we're not in the spirit we'll get end up getting a little snippy at somebody true you you don't see somebody that's in the spirit wanting to get down on somebody it just don't don't don't happen so Abraham he carried two seeds with inside him the scripture says one father and it was Isaac and Ishmael one was conceived through the desire of the flesh you might say we talked about permissive and perfect will of God in our men's meeting we might say Well they're they're intention was to bring forth the promise of God but yet it was the permissible God and it it took their flesh their desire of their flesh to bring it to pass where is the the promise of God just like we're chosen we're elected we don't have nothing to do with it God's going to bring forth uh Isaac and we don't have nothing to do with it God just told Abraham he says I'm going to visit Sarah about a year from now or however that scripture went I'm going to do it I'm going to visit her at the time appointed and she's going to have all Abraham dad to do was keep believing keep believing keep believing that's all we got to do is elect keep believing keep believing amen so the other was conceived to believing the promise of God now even though God did greatly bless Ishmael naturally he was never the predestinated seed of God he was never the predestinated child of God think about that God greatly blessed Ishmael naturally just bless them they had they their descendants to this day have so much money have so many nations have so much so much naturally but yet he was never a predestinated child of God that's why we can never look at whether we're in God's favor because we're being blessed or not it has nothing to do with it Isaac was the elected child of God now if you think about it Israel suffered a lot more than any of those Nations and they're the elect of God so I think you're probably going to be in God's favor more if you're suffering for the right reasons Romans 9 verse 8. that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed so I want to say this with this statement here laughs if you're comfortable being in the flesh take a look at this scripture let it provoke you let it inspire you let it let it get you out of the flesh let it get you to start praying more get in the spirit more because the promise is not to the children of Flesh and here's the probably the biggest trick that the devil plays on people is I'm still alive no matter if I walk in the flesh or not we can't please God so somewhere down the line we've we've we've we must take this word more serious and not be looking for a preacher that's going to make us feel elected regardless of the life we're living uh teachers with engineers and just wanting our favorite type of of ministry that makes us feel what about just Lord lay it on me the way it is for this verse 9 for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son Isaac came into existence by the perfect will of God through the spoken word of God Ishmael came into existence by the will of the flesh through the works of the flesh it was not the perfect will of God allowed it but you talk about all the problems that it caused and to this day they're being caused right so the will of the flesh is absolutely the worst thing for us they which are the children of the flesh are not the children of God so we can be a child of God and walk in the flesh but I'll say it like this the Holy Ghost is going to straighten you out because that's the job of the Holy Ghost he's leading guide you into all truth he's not going to sit there and Pat you on the back and say well you don't have to worry about that until next service no he's he's wanting us to come into the maturity of what the seed or the elected are supposed to be they are going to be without spot or wrinkle we're going to be just like him when he comes all right Romans chapter 8 verse 5. Romans 8. verse 5 says for they that are after the flesh they do mind the things of the flesh so their mind is just on what they want but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit so just think about your your mind where your mind has been where's your mind been are you looking to manifest more Christ are you just kind of like hoping that somehow going to church is going to somehow do that for you it's nothing about church attendance making you what you ought to be it's talking about where your mind is at on a regular basis and I I understand that we all go through tremendous trials all of us do and we got so many things to bother us to distract us we got so many things trying to to get us to make goals but you know if you don't make your a number one goal with God I want you to make me the manifested bride of Christ I want you to make make sure that I know that I'm doing everything I can to be ready in that hour if that is not your main goal you're easily going to be distracted from our purpose and what we've been predestinated to for to be calmly minded is going to end up in death but to be spiritually minded is what life and peace and peace it was not able that killed Cain Abel was a man of peace Isaac was a man of peace it was those that were in the flesh they were the ones that didn't mind like these Jews these Jews didn't mine hey let's kill Jesus he don't agree with us all right because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God indeed neither indeed can be the carnal mind is enmity against God I wonder why that is because I don't believe the kernel mind has the ability to trust God [Music] I don't believe it has the ability to trust God it has its limits I'll Trust You Lord as long as I see this but as soon as I don't see this for it is not subject to the word neither indeed can it be oh my that is so scary we must come subject to the word amen so then they that are in the flesh they can't plea can they cannot please God we might say this Brothers they can't be in the perfect will of God can't be in the perfect will of God it's permissible of God but not the perfect but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwelleth in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his no I wanted no we all know we all feel that I have God's holy spirit is that true so as long as we feel that we have God's holy spirit this verse doesn't concern us right I mean that that's that feeling well I got the holy spirit because you can you can be the elect and be in the flesh and that can get kind of comfortable but the thing is you know brother Brandon talked about that Spirit can he kind of leave you because you can grieve it and then you're just there left still elect so I like to say it like this if if I see that the the the fruit of the spirit is just bubbling out of me then I can have confidence on his but if I don't see that happening and I just whatever my flesh wants to do but I'm still going to be claiming on the elect all I'm doing is deceiving myself the scripture says he that reads the word knows the word chooses not to do it deceives himself right that's the scripture and if Christ be in you now I like this here's the evidence if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin and the spirit is life because of righteousness so there is something inside you that's dead and I and it wouldn't be like somebody that you would see in a coffin not that kind of dead right so there's something else that has to be dead inside of us it would have to be our will our will would have to be dead and Jesus the way he explained it to us he said that we have to actually deny ourselves daily it's not a One-Shot deal so if we don't do it that day we're alive the flesh speaking of are you with me all right but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead he should also Quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of them the body ye shall live now they're remember the scripture there that we go through a process of sanctification we have to choose to crucify our flesh that can't that can't that can't be oh I you know I'm just going to do what I want until you know the I go to church and and and and and the preacher looks right at me points his finger at me and says you're doing wrong [Music] and then I'll try harder that's not dying out daily so something that we we need to do now I'm going to say this is how the Holy Spirit leads every one of us verse 14. as for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God I believe the Holy Ghost leads us to crucify our flesh leads us to die out so that Christ can live through us now not only did Abraham carry two different seeds but also his son Isaac carried two different seeds one was God's seed and one was of his flesh Romans 9 10 not only this Romans 9 10 not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by what by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth I'll tell you if you heard God called you you're my elect we ought to be the happiest people in the whole world brother Brandon said in the message Ephesians Church age he said again there were two children from the Flesh of the same parents there were twins of Isaac and Rebecca and one of the elect and one was the elective God and the other was a reprobate both worship God in every single case there was worship of God involved in every single case the evil hated the righteous and persecuted the righteous in some cases the evil destroyed the righteous but notice they were planted together they lived together they both made claims upon God and worshiped God I mean what more could we do than to stand and say yes God saved me I'm the elect of God I and worship there's got to be something that makes us different and I'm so glad God sent a message in this hour to help us rightly Define because throughout brother Bynum's Ministry he would talk about those two seeds that they were both religious they both went to church so we can't look and just look at one another and say Well they're the religious I can't look at myself and say I'm religious I I need to I need to look at what at the part of my life is it lining up with the word that the Alexa they will do that's what's important so it was said it was said verse 12. now it was said of Unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated God knew God knew who who was going to serve them God knows everybody who's going to serve them or not I think God is the only one who could say uh so and so I loved and and so and so I hated Jacob and Esau are a perfect type of every spiritual believer today who is first born in the flesh by the will of the Flesh of a mother and a father who then must be born again the second time by the will of God to do the will of God and that's the type because Esau was born first he had the birthright he was supposed to get it but Jacob the supplanter did some deceiving with some help with his mother who knew and and stole the birthright and that's what we have to do the natural man the natural man ends up serving the spiritual man in every one of us when we die out we're no longer serving the flesh but we make brother bam says the spirit inside you makes your body obey so I'll just say like this the older man serves the younger right because he was born first at our birthday and then whenever we were born again praise God so in other words we were in bondage to our flesh at one time serving our own lustful desires and when the new birth started then the flesh had to start serving and obeying the will of God or what we said because remember it has to go through free Miller agency so the Elder nature serves the younger the firstborn ends up dying out the body which is used to serve sin now ends up serving the second nature which is God thus giving way to receive the birthright blessings for the firstborn and that's eternal life all right so let's just kind of go through this in Romans chapter six I told you I'm really taking my time because there's just so many good types and and things in here Romans 6 verse 15. What then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace God forbid know ye not to whom uh know you not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servant you are to whom you obey whether a sin unto death or obedience unto righteousness but God be thanked that ye were the Servants of sin we were all Esau's but ye have obeyed from the heart oh I love that you have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin he became Servants of righteousness servants now we instead of us just wanting others to do things for us we now start doing things for others I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have you did your members servants to uncleanness uh and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness so I see the elect of God they see that and they say that is what I need to do and you know I'll say uh let me just try to word this different the elect read that and they say I have to do that there's something in them that's calling there's a deep calling the word is calling them to fulfill the word they there's no longer a choice that's the thing about the elect of God they don't have a choice in the matter they will manifest the word they just know they just believe it to do it all right so he says here for when ye were Servants of sin ye were free from righteousness you could basically just do whatever you want to do what fruit had ye then and those things were of ye are now ashamed for the end of those things is death but now being made free from sin ye became servants to God ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord I just love this set of scriptures here in Romans because it really shows how the uh Elder serves the younger and and I I brother Marty was sharing about how his dad at one time used to uh drink and and do the things uh of the world and God got a hold of his heart and um it just changed his life completely now as that change was going forth uh Marty being younger than his dad of course he looked at him he says you know Dad just doesn't seem to be fun anymore just doesn't seem to be fun anymore because a change had happened and now instead of just yielding to do whatever you wanted to do the new nature was taking over and he was he was in control if I could say it like this because we have a chance to obey God if we want and he decided I'm gonna I'm gonna start doing the things that I should do and and and and and brother Marty his testimony of his dad was he was a changed man is a wonderful man he is a good man he he did uh become so much better than what he was same body the same body that he was born with but the nature had changed all right I just want to read some quotes here because I believe that brother Branham was not only the messenger to the laodicean church age not just to call people out of denominations but he was the prophet to the elect to me that's like a step a step higher and that you know brother Branham talked to us about the voice that was in The Voice and I believe that there's a voice in this message just to the elect so brother brother Brian said in Ephesians Church age he says even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called God's truth by deceivers um he will do this for even as John was the messenger of Truth to the elect so is this one the last Messenger to the elect and word born bride isn't that beautiful in the message Oneness brother Brandon says oh my what is it he's got his Oneness his two his two his true Oneness showing himself among them out of every denomination bringing his elect together from all kinds of churches from everywhere bringing out his children falling right in line with his word not just coming out of a denomination and getting together and saying the denominations are wrong but coming together and lining up with the word the purpose of coming out of the churches was to get in line with the word not just to say the churches were wrong now the coming of the Lord Jesus is so imminent the coming of judgment he's calling he's elected together in Oneness with himself now this is this is a beautiful quote all you got to do is just where you you are the Elite where do you put yourself with this quote he's calling his elect together in Oneness with himself the same kind of a Ministry he had you know how I sh how I sharped nope shaped in the church ages here not long ago and the big tower that was built called The Pyramid but the headstone was never put on it remember how the lutherans came the westlings came in the minority and then down to the Pentecost and now what is he doing he's calling from that what did he do he called out the elect to make the lutherans he called out of the elect out of the lutherans I like that he called out the elect to make the Lutheran no he called out the elect out of the lutherans to make the Le to make their wesleyans he called out of the elect out of that to make the Pentecostals now he's calling the elect out of the pentecologist out to make the headstone to come into it a very same kind of ministry dropping in right a right in on it calling his children from all denominations and all walks of life so notice with the calling of the Pentecostal says do it's to come to the Capstone Capstone which we know us we know is perfect love what has he done he has placed with them a true teachers true prophets who stay with his word the Bible says my sheep hear my voice Jesus said if that was his voice then it's his voice now and anything contrary to that voice it's not sheep food and the Sheep won't fall what he said they won't follow it all right I got one quick quote and then we're closing because this is something hard that you just can't spend a lot of time if you're not you know well rested and really into it this isn't a Thai Italian Church age brother Brian says they received from him the revelation of the word for each period this word revelation brings the elect of God out of the world and into full Union with Jesus Christ so how is the devil deceived so many people he's got them to think I've come out of the world I've come out of the the denomination I must be elect no no Brother Band says there was they came out a mixed multitude [Music] but there was only two elect two million came out of Egypt only to elect so the most important part to me of this is we have to come into a full Union with Jesus Christ and Joshua and Kayla they were of another spirit they were the only ones that were willing to stay with the promise we're more than able to take the land we're the others they just they went to church and they murmured and they complained and this was a problem and that's a problem everything they went through they never seemed to have faith to just believe even talking about you know I'd be better off I was back in the world Stand Together are you getting something out of this this definitely I'm trying to provoke us and I honestly wish we could take like an hour break and come back because there's some breaking up the the ground of maybe getting real comfortable about just feeling that we're alike because what we're going to get into next is that if a person is elected of God there's certain criteria that will take place in that person's life and and that's what we all need to be you know measuring up to see not so much how the preacher's making me feel or how I'm feeling that day but just taking an honest look because they're not they're not real uh hard to figure out things they're they're they're they're simple things but the the elect they will be doing it they will be doing it amen let's let's just bow before we sing some choruses our heavenly father we come to you Lord just asking you to come and reveal these beautiful truths to our heart Lord we don't want you to uh two two do anything but help us Lord help us if we're exactly where we need to be Lord we just want to thank you for that Grace today we'll need it tomorrow Lord if there's certain areas that we just haven't been paying attention to remembering when your Prophet had that vision and he saw the a lot the Bride come out of this age when some would get out of line he would just scream back get back in line Lord I pray that as we go through these scriptures coming Lord that you would help us to hear that scream that that scream personally to us to get back in line Lord we just we want to become one with you just in every aspect we want our life to to line up we want this beautiful Union and Lord we know that it must go beyond our feelings but Glory just we must live a totally dedicated life to you help us Lord we we stand in need of your grace and of your help Lord we thank you for putting within us your elect to make it and we also thank you for putting within us a determination to do the things that you have called us to do so Lord we thank you today for for you for your watching over your elect your your protectedness you're taking care of us and you're going to see us through regardless of all the the demons and all the uh the lies that are are told to our mind the distractions and all the the weird things that are happening in this message and all the false doctrines and everything that's going on Lord you will bring forth a true bride amen and we just thank you for Lord we want to thank you for protecting our little church oh God thank you thank you Lord and thank you for protecting our our our lives our minds and helping our homes and and giving us that love one for another Lord you shed it abroad in our heart by the Holy Ghost thank you Lord Jesus I pray Lord neither not be any any confusion that would come forth from these Services Lord but may there be a clarity Lord May there be a determination in every one of our hearts Lord of what you are truly calling us to we thank you for this now we praise you and give you the honor for we humbly ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
