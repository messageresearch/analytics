[5:51] are still faithful, Lord. You will keep
[5:53] your word. And this morning, we come
[5:55] this morning that we might worship you
[5:58] in spirit and truth. Lord, that we might
[6:00] hear the word you prepared for us.
[6:03] Father, may you just be our guest.
[6:05] Forgive us of our sins, our
[6:07] shortcomings. Heavenly Father, I pray
[6:09] that you'll just watch over us. May you
[6:11] find this a welcoming atmosphere,
[6:13] Father, for your spirit. In Jesus
[6:16] Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Amen. You
[6:19] may be seated. Praise the Lord. We have

[29:20] and you wanted to wear something pretty
[29:22] halfway decent, right? I mean, you

[29:27] right? Think about you have a
[29:30] chance. You have a chance to make your
[29:34] crown as bright as you want it to be.
[29:41] The more souls that you get attached to

[29:47] be.

[35:37] in the midst of us, Father. And we are
[35:40] more than two and three this morning.
[35:43] And we believe Lord that you are in our
[35:46] midst here. Father, thank you Lord for
[35:48] your presence. Thank you Lord for your
[35:50] mercy and grace. Lord as we meditate
[35:53] upon your word this morning. Not my word
[35:58] man's word will fail but your words are
[36:01] eternal life father. But Lord, as we
[36:05] stand here, Father, in your presence,
[36:08] meet the needs of your children, Father.
[36:10] Amen. Lord, I am I'm just a empty vessel
[36:13] here, Father, trying to just stand here
[36:17] in your name with your strength. Lord, I
[36:21] want to take away myself from this place
[36:24] so that you can come in and deal with
[36:26] our lives today, Father. Lord, many have
[36:30] come
[36:31] expecting. Lord, few of them have come
[36:34] to
[36:35] try how this service is going to be.
[36:39] Many have come to experience the power
[36:41] of the Holy Ghost. Father, Lord, you
[36:44] meet their needs according to their
[36:46] desires,
[36:47] Father. Lord, we thank you Lord for this
[36:50] wonderful morning. Let your name be
[36:52] glorified and name be magnified. We
[36:56] thank you. All glory, praise go to you.
[36:59] Amen. I pray this prayer in the name of
[37:01] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[37:05] God bless you saints. Uh greetings to
[37:07] everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus
[37:08] Christ. It's good to be in the house of
[37:11] the Lord this morning. Thank the Lord
[37:14] for bringing me again another time and I
[37:17] would like to also thank uh the man of
[37:19] God, brother John Martin for uh giving
[37:23] me this place and uh you
[37:26] know speak to the church this morning
[37:30] you know uh pray for me. I need your
[37:32] prayers. So let us read from the word of
[37:36] God in the book of uh Galatians.
[37:40] Galatians chapter 5 verse
[37:50] 22-2. Galatians
[38:03] 5:22-2. But the fruit of the spirit is
[38:07] love,
[38:08] joy, peace, longsuffering, and
[38:12] gentleness, goodness, and faith,
[38:15] meekness, temperance. Against such there
[38:18] is no law. And they that are Christ have
[38:23] crucified the flesh with the affections
[38:26] and lust.
[38:29] If we live in the spirit, let us walk,
[38:33] let us also walk in the spirit. Amen. I
[38:36] would like to emphasize on the 25th
[38:39] verse. If we live in the spirit, let us
[38:43] also walk in the spirit. May the Lord
[38:46] bless the reading of his holy word. You
[38:48] may be seated. Thank you very much.
[38:50] Thank you for your patience. Thank you.
[38:53] Thank you for coming to the house of the
[38:55] Lord this uh morning, you know. It's the
[38:58] Lord's day. Amen. It's the day of the
[39:01] resurrection, you know. And uh there's
[39:04] no other place where we can be but here,
[39:08] you know, and I thank the Lord that you
[39:10] could make it today. And I could make it
[39:13] for almost many miles, you know,
[39:16] thousands of miles from India, you know,
[39:18] over the seas. But I thank God for his
[39:21] protection and for his grace and mercy.
[39:24] Uh the Lord is good to us. The work of
[39:27] the Lord is still continuing in India.
[39:30] The harvest is plenty but the laborers
[39:32] are few as the word of God says. But you
[39:35] know the harvest, the sole harvest is is
[39:39] going on in India. The more the
[39:42] persecution is on the rise, the more the
[39:45] people are coming to the light of this
[39:47] message, the light of this word. You
[39:50] know what is the light? The vindicated
[39:54] spoken word of God is the light of this
[39:57] day. You know, we believe this is the
[40:00] only book which can save us. Amen. I
[40:04] baptized 48 new souls since January 1
[40:09] till till I came to America. I thank the
[40:12] almighty God for giving his uh such a
[40:16] grace and keeping his grace upon me and
[40:19] giving his mercy on me. you know uh
[40:22] without his grace I wouldn't be able to
[40:24] achieve uh this many souls you know I'm
[40:28] just trying to do my job all glory to
[40:30] God only you know uh bring greetings
[40:33] from the orphans and the leprosy people
[40:36] in the three different colonies we take
[40:38] care and also uh bring greetings from
[40:41] the elderly and the widows the HIV
[40:45] infected and affected women and children
[40:48] and uh the saints in the church and
[40:51] especially uh from my family you know
[40:54] the Lord blessed me with uh three
[40:56] daughters one son one daughter-in-law
[40:59] one son-in-law and two grandchildren you
[41:02] know so and one wife you know so that's
[41:06] the good part you know so uh thank the
[41:10] almighty god for his grace and for his
[41:12] love towards us you know pray for us uh
[41:16] we are in the midst of constructing a
[41:18] church and uh pray that the Lord would
[41:21] uh help us to finish it, you know. So,
[41:24] he has been good to me. Uh and uh he is
[41:28] been good to me. He is always will be
[41:30] good to me, you know. So, that's what I
[41:32] believe. That is what faith is, you
[41:34] know. So, I'd like
[41:36] to just tell you one thing that I have
[41:38] not come here to judge anybody, you
[41:40] know. I have just come here to uh
[41:44] comfort and encourage my brothers and
[41:46] sisters, you know, because God is our
[41:49] judge, you know, and I'm just here
[41:51] standing as a vessel trying to, you
[41:54] know, speak what the Lord wants me to
[41:56] speak, you know, and um we are here to
[42:00] also receive. Amen. receive from God.
[42:03] You know, uh receive what is good. You
[42:07] know, if you don't like it, keep it
[42:09] aside, you know. But, you know, in
[42:11] India, we say, you know, like we we put
[42:14] curry leaves in our in our curries and,
[42:17] you know, in in our food, you know. So,
[42:20] sometimes some people like curry leaves,
[42:22] some of them don't, you know. Well,
[42:24] United States have banned people from
[42:26] the third world countries bringing curry
[42:29] leaves into into America. You know, he
[42:32] says you can get a gun inside and you'll
[42:34] be free. But if you bring curry
[42:37] leaf, that really I'm saying, you know,
[42:40] oh the dog, the sniffer dogs, they come
[42:43] beside your suitcase and you're in
[42:45] trouble, you know. So, so I don't want
[42:47] to be in trouble, you know. So uh you
[42:50] know I say you know if you don't like it
[42:53] just keep it aside you know don't murmur
[42:57] don't complain you know just keep it
[43:00] aside you know but everything what I'm
[43:03] going to speak is from the word of God
[43:06] not man's word because man's word will
[43:08] fail you know so we are talking about
[43:11] bearing much
[43:13] fruit if I'm not pronouncing it properly
[43:16] you know so it's bringing much fruits
[43:18] you know another another option is
[43:21] always there for thank god for
[43:23] dictionaries you know we need to bring
[43:25] in more fruits or bear more fruits you
[43:29] know the word of the lord if you read in
[43:32] the book of
[43:33] Galatians from 19 to
[43:36] 21 you know it talks about the man you
[43:41] know trying to be wicked or trying to go
[43:44] after the lust of the flesh fornication
[43:46] adultery and all those things you know
[43:49] but when it comes to 9 22 to
[43:53] 25 it talks about the fruit of the
[43:57] spirit you know so we all need to be in
[44:01] this category you know amen from the
[44:04] words 22 to 25 you know the fruit we are
[44:07] talking about has nine different facets
[44:10] you know uh or you can say attributes or
[44:12] qualities you know and every Christian
[44:15] has them all you know all N you know
[44:18] when you were born when you came into
[44:20] this world God placed this in your life
[44:24] you know you know that's why you need to
[44:27] be
[44:28] fruitful you need to multiply you know
[44:31] spiritually I'm saying you know and you
[44:34] need to bless and be blessed you know it
[44:37] is very important that we need to bring
[44:40] in fruit you know the word of God
[44:43] says you shall know them by the fruit
[44:46] you know Right? And it is very important
[44:49] to bear fruit in everyday life
[44:52] especially the Christian life. You know
[44:55] the fruit we are talking as I said it
[44:57] has got nine different facets or
[45:00] attributes or qualities and every
[45:02] Christian has them all. Nine but
[45:05] remember it is all of the fruit for all
[45:08] of the saints not some of the fruit for
[45:12] some of the saint. Amen.
[45:15] Now don't get that idea that you can
[45:17] somehow produce this fruit. I mean
[45:20] depending on changes in your mood
[45:25] sometimes we change mood and we want to
[45:27] show more love. You know when we don't
[45:30] have a good mood we don't show them love
[45:32] but no this is not what it is talking
[45:34] about. Now don't get the idea that you
[45:36] mean somehow produce this fruit. I mean
[45:39] you cannot simply decide that you're
[45:41] going to be more loving, joyful and kind
[45:44] person
[45:46] because this fruit is not produced by
[45:48] flesh.
[45:50] Now you'll say how do we firm up the
[45:52] fruit of love or joy or kindness or
[45:54] whatever fruits needs firming up. You
[45:57] know that's just it. You cannot do it.
[46:00] You know how does it happen? How does it
[46:03] happen in your life? How does it happen
[46:05] in anybody's life? And the only answer
[46:08] you can find it is in the Bible.
[46:11] Amen. Amen. Can I get some amen? Amen.
[46:15] It is only found in the Bible. You know,
[46:18] I'm not used to speaking to statues in
[46:21] my country, you know. So, I'm I'm used
[46:25] to speaking to people and and the people
[46:27] giving response saying amen and
[46:29] hallelujah. You know, because this is
[46:31] God's word. You know, you cannot produce
[46:35] fruit in the flesh. Amen. Amen. By the
[46:39] flesh. But the only answer you get in
[46:43] the place is the Bible. You know, John
[46:46] 15:4 says, "Abide in me and I in you."
[46:50] Right? As the branch cannot bear fruit
[46:53] of itself except it abide in the vine,
[46:56] no more
[46:58] can except ye abide in me. Amen. Amen.
[47:02] I'd like to read it again. He said,
[47:04] "Abide in me and I in you. As the branch
[47:07] cannot bear fruit of itself, except it
[47:11] abide in the vine, no more can he except
[47:15] he abide in me." This is what Christ
[47:18] himself personally saying to us today.
[47:23] John 15:8 says here in my father
[47:26] glorified that he bear much fruit so
[47:30] shall ye be my disciples.
[47:33] In another place he said if you want to
[47:36] be my disciple love one another as I
[47:39] loved you. You know here he says my
[47:42] father is glorified. Amen. When we
[47:44] produce more fruit when we bear more
[47:48] fruit our God is glorified. Amen.
[47:52] Hallelujah. When we bear much fruit, our
[47:55] God is glorified. And when he is
[47:58] glorified, he will make us his
[48:00] disciples.
[48:02] How many of you want to be his disciple
[48:04] today? I want to be. Amen. We all want
[48:07] to be his disciples. We all want to be
[48:09] his children. We all want to in some of
[48:13] the other way we want to bear fruit.
[48:16] Amen. You know, it is it is a desire of
[48:20] a man, you know.
[48:22] But the prophet of God said man is
[48:24] halted between two desires. One is the
[48:26] desire of the soul and one is the desire
[48:29] of the body. You know desire of the soul
[48:33] is verses 22 to 25 and desire of the
[48:37] body is verses 19 to 21. You know
[48:43] we are
[48:44] halted between two
[48:47] thirst. Thirst for this world and thirst
[48:49] for God. But the word of God says, "As
[48:52] the day penteth for the water brooks, so
[48:56] my soul longeth after thee."
[48:59] We need to thirst after God. We need to
[49:02] long after him. You know the fruit you
[49:06] bear is in direct relation to your
[49:10] abiding in Christ. You know
[49:13] what you need to do to bear more fruits
[49:16] is abide in him and bear. Amen. Abiding
[49:19] and bearing. Abiding and bearing. You
[49:22] must abide in order to bear. And if you
[49:25] are not abiding, you will not be
[49:27] bearing. Amen. And our motive for
[49:30] bearing much fruit is not to just to
[49:32] live with it, but to bring glory to God.
[49:37] We read the word here in my father is
[49:40] glorified when you bear much fruit. You
[49:43] know
[49:45] Paul as I mentioned as Paul has
[49:48] mentioned about the works of the flesh
[49:51] in verse 19 to 21 in the same chapter
[49:54] but now it turns our focus to the fruit
[49:56] of the spirit in verse 22 to 25. And let
[50:00] me say that if your life is described in
[50:03] verse 19 to 21 you need to either get
[50:06] right or you get left out.
[50:11] It's hurting. Amen. But it's the truth.
[50:15] If you are in this category of
[50:19] 19-2, either you get right or you are
[50:22] left out, you know. But if your life is
[50:25] described in this category of verse 22
[50:29] to 25, then continue to bear more more
[50:34] more fruit.
[50:37] You're doing it. Continue.
[50:40] You're bringing fruit, more
[50:45] fruits. God, God's desire is always to
[50:48] get more from you as the same we have
[50:51] towards God. You know, every time we
[50:54] want to say Lord give, give, give, give,
[50:56] give give. But on the other hand, even
[50:58] the Lord is saying you also do that. You
[51:00] know, you
[51:03] give, give and it shall be given. You
[51:08] know it's you know we we know the law of
[51:12] that gra you know science I don't know I
[51:15] don't have much education but it is to
[51:17] every every action there is an equal and
[51:20] opposite reaction
[51:23] we need to react we need to respond
[51:28] we need to bear much fruit more fruits
[51:32] you know in our
[51:34] life the first list it describes a lost
[51:39] person. The second list describes a
[51:42] saved
[51:44] person. One person lives by the flesh
[51:46] because they are led of the flesh while
[51:48] the other lives by the spirit because
[51:50] they are led by the spirits of and my
[51:54] Bible says as many as are led by the
[51:56] spirit of God are the sons and daughters
[51:59] of God. Amen.
[52:01] The mark of growing Christian is
[52:03] determined by the kind of fruit we will
[52:07] bear.
[52:09] Matthew 7:16 said, "He shall know them
[52:11] by their fruits." Matthew 7:20 said,
[52:14] "Wherefore, by their fruits he shall
[52:17] know
[52:20] them." Now, don't be under impression
[52:23] that there are nine fruits of the
[52:25] spirit. No, there are not nine fruits of
[52:29] the spirit, but rather the fruit of the
[52:33] spirit.
[52:35] The fruit of the spirit produces nine
[52:38] qualities,
[52:40] nine manifestations of graces. Yes.
[52:44] Hallelujah.
[52:46] It's not nine fruits. It's one fruit
[52:50] with nine manifestations with nine
[52:53] graces with nine qualities.
[52:57] Do we hear the difference? Amen. You
[53:00] know in the Greek New
[53:02] Testament clearly uses the singular when
[53:05] it says but the fruit of the
[53:09] spirit. Now take a cluster of grapes for
[53:12] example.
[53:14] The grapes are all of the same wine,
[53:17] right? And yet some of the grapes on
[53:20] this wine may be shrivel,
[53:23] shrunken, while others may be scrawny,
[53:26] small, sour,
[53:29] splendid, and yet they all come from the
[53:32] same wine.
[53:35] So don't get the idea that God somehow
[53:37] divides the fruit of the spirit among us
[53:40] to make sure all the bases are covered.
[53:46] We should not be under that
[53:49] impression. I truly believe that the
[53:52] Lord is going to speak to someone.
[53:57] God doesn't believe in divide and rule.
[54:03] God doesn't believe in separating.
[54:08] God doesn't divide the fruit of the
[54:10] spirit among
[54:13] us. God gives some of you the fruit of
[54:16] love while giving others the fruit of
[54:19] joy, the others the fruit of kindness
[54:21] and so forth. No, no, no. He's given
[54:23] every Christian, every saint, all the
[54:26] nine qualities,
[54:29] all the nine attributes. Amen.
[54:32] You cannot go through this list and say,
[54:34] I like this one and I'll pick it.
[54:38] I like this one. After all, joy is
[54:40] wonderful. I'll take some peace. That's
[54:43] always good. But that self-control can
[54:46] just stay on the shelf.
[54:50] It's all of the fruit for all of the
[54:54] saints, not some of the fruit for some
[54:58] of the
[54:59] saints. They all grow from the same
[55:03] branch.
[55:04] The wine is
[55:06] one. The branches
[55:12] are You might say, "Brother Bo, what
[55:14] should we do now?
[55:19] What shall I do? My answer is just bear
[55:22] more fruits.
[55:26] Just bear more fruit. Bring in more
[55:28] fruits.
[55:30] John 15:1 and2 says, "I am the true wine
[55:33] and my father is the husband
[55:36] man. Every branch in me that beareth not
[55:39] fruit." Remember this. Every branch.
[55:42] It's good to listen, you know. Amen. Oh,
[55:45] it's a good sermon, brother Bo. It's a
[55:47] good sermon, brother John.
[55:50] It's good to the
[55:51] ears. But remember, this should not b
[55:55] should not be only in this area. It
[55:58] should go deep down into our hearts.
[56:02] Now listen to this very carefully. Every
[56:04] branch in me that beareth
[56:07] not fruit, he taketh away. And every
[56:11] branch that beareth fruit, he purgth
[56:16] it. That means bearing fruit is not
[56:20] easy. The prophet of God said when the
[56:22] bride is growing, the bride will be
[56:26] criticized. When the bride is growing in
[56:28] his
[56:29] grace, he will have growing pains. She
[56:32] will have growing pains.
[56:35] Do you believe that? When we grow, when
[56:37] our children grow, when we have grown,
[56:39] we had growing
[56:41] pains. But when we have growing pains,
[56:45] when we grow in his kingdom, when we are
[56:49] in the process of bearing much fruit,
[56:51] remember that's the growing pains of his
[56:54] grace.
[56:58] Look at this again. Every branch in me
[57:00] that beareth not fruit, he taketh away.
[57:03] And every branch that beareth fruit, he
[57:07] purgth it. Means the more fruit, the
[57:10] more purging.
[57:12] More fruit, more purging.
[57:15] God is on a purging business.
[57:22] There's a gardener in the garden.
[57:26] What he will do when he likes some
[57:28] flower, he plucks
[57:35] it. If you are bringing
[57:39] fruit, God wants more.
[57:44] Today you gave a
[57:45] basket, tomorrow you want two baskets.
[57:54] Only God is not only the giver. My
[57:56] brothers, my sister, even we are givers.
[58:00] We need to go on giving. We need to
[58:03] bring more fruit. We need to bear more
[58:06] fruits.
[58:10] As we began in reading in Galatians
[58:14] 5:22, but the fruit of the spirit is
[58:19] love. Hallelujah. And the fruit produced
[58:22] by the Holy Spirit in the life of a
[58:24] surrender saint is not erotic love nor
[58:27] it's filio love. It is agape
[58:32] love. The same kind of love that caused
[58:35] Jesus to die on the cross for us while
[58:39] we were yet
[58:40] sinners. Christ died for us while we
[58:44] were yet sinners. This is a selfless
[58:47] love, not a self-centered love. And a
[58:50] person who has got self-centered love
[58:53] will fail and fall.
[58:56] What we need is a selfless love towards
[58:59] God, selfless love towards Christ,
[59:02] selfless love towards the world,
[59:04] selfless love toward our family. Yes.
[59:11] That's why selfishness should not creep
[59:14] in.
[59:16] Neither in the relationships, neither in
[59:19] your family, neither in the church,
[59:24] nowhere. What we need the same kind of
[59:27] love that Jesus caused. It caused Jesus
[59:31] to die on the cross for us while we were
[59:35] yet sinners. It is the truth. We were in
[59:39] guilt and shame and we were lying in the
[59:41] pool of blood. And what did God do? He
[59:44] passed by us and he didn't pass us but
[59:47] he came to us. He draw us near.
[59:50] Hallelujah. And he hold us into his
[59:53] mighty
[59:54] hands. I have loved you with an
[59:56] everlasting love and I have drawn you
[1:00:01] near. What kind of love we are talking
[1:00:04] about? This is a selfless love not a
[1:00:07] self centered love. And it is the first
[1:00:09] and the foremost
[1:00:12] fruit. You know when Paul is talking
[1:00:14] about this
[1:00:17] fruit of the spirit, love is the
[1:00:20] foundation. Without love, there is no
[1:00:23] joy, no peace, no longsuffering, no
[1:00:26] kindness, no goodness, no faithfulness,
[1:00:28] no gentleness, no
[1:00:31] self-control, no
[1:00:36] meekness, the restoration of the bride
[1:00:39] tree. So this little palmer come around
[1:00:42] to take off the fruits. The first thing,
[1:00:45] the first fruit it took off was
[1:00:47] brotherly love. That's right. There's no
[1:00:51] more brotherly love in the church.
[1:00:55] There's no love in the family. There's
[1:00:57] no love between the husband and wife and
[1:00:59] the
[1:01:01] children. What is happening? The
[1:01:05] devil is eating away this first fruit
[1:01:09] called love which is the
[1:01:12] foundation. That's the one thing that
[1:01:14] kills the church right there. That's the
[1:01:17] one thing that kills the family there.
[1:01:20] When brotherly
[1:01:23] love, when love is out of the church,
[1:01:26] when love is out of the
[1:01:28] family, it's not a church. It's not a
[1:01:31] family.
[1:01:35] Yes
[1:01:36] sir. The next fruit it took of he went
[1:01:40] on taking all the
[1:01:43] nine one after the
[1:01:46] other. Remember love is the first fruit
[1:01:48] on the tree. Then he took away joy,
[1:01:52] peace, longsuffering, goodness,
[1:01:54] meekness, faith, patience in the Holy
[1:01:56] Ghost.
[1:01:59] Now the next question is how we can bear
[1:02:03] much
[1:02:05] fruit.
[1:02:07] How? Bible has got the answer.
[1:02:11] John 15:4 and 5 says, "Abide in me and I
[1:02:14] in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit
[1:02:16] of itself except it abide in the vine,
[1:02:18] no more can he except he abide in
[1:02:22] me. I am the vine. He are the branches.
[1:02:26] He that abideth in me, and I in him, the
[1:02:28] same bringeth much forth, much forth
[1:02:32] much fruit. For without me, you can do
[1:02:37] nothing. Brothers and sisters, you and I
[1:02:39] cannot do
[1:02:41] anything. You cannot do nothing without
[1:02:44] God.
[1:02:47] Go how far you want to go. But remember,
[1:02:50] there is always a U-turn.
[1:02:54] If there's no U-turn, that means you are
[1:02:56] falling
[1:02:58] up in the
[1:03:00] valley. No, but
[1:03:03] Christ is selfless
[1:03:07] love. He died for us on the cross of
[1:03:10] Calvary. He loved us so that you and I
[1:03:14] can be here today.
[1:03:17] And if you think that you have gone a
[1:03:19] little bit astray, little back out of
[1:03:23] line and the prophet saw that vision,
[1:03:26] you know, he said, "Get back in the
[1:03:30] line." Oh, it's time to get back in the
[1:03:33] line. It's time to get back. It's time
[1:03:37] to come back to the pavilion. It's time
[1:03:39] to come back to the Pentecost.
[1:03:42] It's time to come to the old time
[1:03:44] religion, old time singing, oldfashioned
[1:03:47] gospel.
[1:04:00] The family came for two weeks and they
[1:04:03] left and I called them. I said, "Why you
[1:04:05] not coming?" He said, "Pastor
[1:04:11] your church doesn't have rock and
[1:04:16] roll. I said, well, I might not have a
[1:04:20] rock and roll music, but I rock and I
[1:04:26] roll. My rock is Christ.
[1:04:31] And when his spirit comes upon me, I
[1:04:33] roll.
[1:04:36] I am a holy roller.
[1:04:42] What is happening? People are looking
[1:04:44] for you know fancy fancy screens,
[1:04:49] fancy music, fancy musicians,
[1:04:53] popular
[1:04:56] singers and by this they think they are
[1:04:59] doing good to God to the church.
[1:05:02] They are bringing fruit. No, no, no.
[1:05:09] Is everybody here?
[1:05:16] Oh, I was reading this word. My
[1:05:18] brother's my
[1:05:21] sister. Brother John asked me, "How did
[1:05:25] you
[1:05:26] sleep?" I didn't have an answer. He has
[1:05:29] the
[1:05:32] answer. You know, I'm not used of dogs
[1:05:35] at home.
[1:05:39] That bothers me you know because we are
[1:05:41] not used to living with the dogs in our
[1:05:45] homes in India. All our dogs are in
[1:05:47] stray, our cats, everything, you
[1:05:50] know. And brother John, let me tell you,
[1:05:53] it's it's just like I'm caged in I'm not
[1:05:56] coming out of the room because of the
[1:05:58] scare, you know, fear of that dog, you
[1:06:01] know. No matter how how much brother uh
[1:06:04] Mike says, sit down, sit down, sit down,
[1:06:07] the dog wants to come near to
[1:06:10] me. He likes my skin.
[1:06:16] But you know sometimes God puts you in
[1:06:19] that situation so that you can pray
[1:06:21] more,
[1:06:22] you can meditate more. Brother, sister
[1:06:24] sisters, as I was meditating upon this,
[1:06:26] you know, he says abide in me and I in
[1:06:29] you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:06:33] itself, no matter how much you do,
[1:06:37] no matter how much intellectual you are,
[1:06:42] how much strength you have,
[1:06:46] you cannot bear
[1:06:49] fruit except you abide in the wine.
[1:06:55] No more can he except you abide in me.
[1:06:59] Why? He said, "I am the vine. Ye are the
[1:07:02] branches. He that abide in me. I in
[1:07:05] him." See how many times abide in me, I
[1:07:08] in me, me in you.
[1:07:11] I and my father, me and you are one.
[1:07:22] He that abideth in me, and I in him, the
[1:07:25] same bringeth forth much fruit. For
[1:07:27] without me he can do
[1:07:32] nothing. So clear. But sometimes still
[1:07:35] we run around the bush.
[1:07:38] We play hide and seek.
[1:07:41] No, it's very plain. It is very simple.
[1:07:45] You abide in Christ and Christ will
[1:07:48] abide in you and you will bear much
[1:07:50] fruit.
[1:07:53] Not one month, not three months, not six
[1:07:56] months, all season.
[1:08:06] One day God Almighty Jesus Christ when
[1:08:09] he was upon the
[1:08:11] earth, he desired to have fruit. He was
[1:08:17] hungry. The the tree was green.
[1:08:21] Everything looked good.
[1:08:24] But when he looked for the fruit, there
[1:08:26] was no
[1:08:32] fruit. What did he
[1:08:35] say? From henceforth you will never bear
[1:08:39] fruit. And he
[1:08:41] cursed. And the next morning when the
[1:08:44] disciples were going back the same way,
[1:08:47] the disciples asked him,
[1:08:52] "Lord, you just spoke yesterday and it
[1:08:55] is gone this
[1:08:58] morning." But remember, he doesn't do it
[1:09:00] with you and me. He's a God of patience.
[1:09:06] He will wait. He will wait. He will
[1:09:08] wait. He will wait. He will wait.
[1:09:18] And if he still doesn't listen, you know
[1:09:21] what the word of God says? He will hand
[1:09:23] you over to the
[1:09:27] mammon. But he is a god. He is a
[1:09:30] merciful
[1:09:32] God. We sing that song. It's
[1:09:35] mercy rewrote my
[1:09:39] life. It's mercy. God's mercy rerode my
[1:09:47] life. What else we can have? If it
[1:09:52] wasn't the grace of God, the mercy of
[1:09:55] God, how can we bear much fruit? Abide
[1:09:58] in wine. Abide in
[1:10:01] Christ. Now listen, the wine doesn't
[1:10:04] bear fruit. Can we see Jesus? The wine
[1:10:07] doesn't bear fruit. Wine only energize
[1:10:10] the branch and the branch bear the
[1:10:12] fruit.
[1:10:14] When he was here on the earth, he said,
[1:10:15] "I am the wine. He the branches and now
[1:10:18] the wine does not bear fruit. The wine
[1:10:21] only energizes the branch and the branch
[1:10:24] bears fruit." Do you know what? Do you
[1:10:27] know that if you went to a pumpkin
[1:10:30] wine, what will you get? A pumpkin. If
[1:10:34] it's a fertile wine, to a watermelon,
[1:10:37] you get a watermelon. You go to a grape
[1:10:39] wine, you get
[1:10:41] grapes. When you come to the church, you
[1:10:44] ought to find Christ.
[1:10:48] Why do you come to
[1:10:49] church? To find Christ. Why do you come
[1:10:52] to church? To find out your mistakes,
[1:10:56] not the pastor's mistake.
[1:11:01] Not to try the pastor, not to try the
[1:11:04] deacons, not to try one another. No, you
[1:11:07] come to church to find Christ.
[1:11:10] Amen. You come to church to find out
[1:11:13] your weaknesses.
[1:11:17] Your flaws, your shortcomings.
[1:11:22] If there is any
[1:11:24] place which is the best correction
[1:11:28] facility, it's not in
[1:11:31] Fenton or not in Ann Arbor, not in
[1:11:34] Detroit. This place
[1:11:39] the church is the best correction
[1:11:42] facility. Amen. And if you're not
[1:11:45] corrected here, you will never be
[1:11:46] corrected anywhere.
[1:11:50] To a watermelon, you get watermelon. You
[1:11:52] go to grape wine, you get grapes. When
[1:11:55] you come to church, you are to find
[1:11:57] Christ. But what do you do on his
[1:12:00] wine? It's a question mark. What is
[1:12:03] happening in the world today?
[1:12:06] He says you find
[1:12:08] denominations fussing,
[1:12:10] fighting,
[1:12:12] arguing, everything else but the fruit
[1:12:15] of Christ.
[1:12:17] Jesus said the words that I do shall you
[1:12:20] do also. A little while and the world
[1:12:22] won't see me no more. Yet he shall see
[1:12:24] me for I will be with you even in you to
[1:12:28] the end of the world.
[1:12:30] That's why the Bible said he's the same
[1:12:32] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:12:38] the door inside the door. I am the wine.
[1:12:40] You are the branches. The wine doesn't
[1:12:42] bear fruit. It purges the branches and
[1:12:45] the branches bear fruit. If it is good,
[1:12:47] healthy
[1:12:49] branch. If a lot of wines is wrapped
[1:12:52] around it and iss wrapped around it,
[1:12:56] it's cut off all the circulation and it
[1:12:59] won't be nothing.
[1:13:04] You can't bear
[1:13:07] fruit if the wine is
[1:13:10] entangled. So many isms, so many things,
[1:13:14] so many programs in the church. Amen. We
[1:13:18] have only one
[1:13:19] program, the word of God.
[1:13:27] You might say, "Brother Bo, I'm
[1:13:29] confused.
[1:13:30] I'm in state of panic. I'm state of
[1:13:32] shock. What should I do now? Bear much
[1:13:37] fruit. And what you need to do bear much
[1:13:41] fruit. Blind my eyes. That's the way a
[1:13:43] Christian is. When you are planted in
[1:13:45] Christ, the only thing you have to do is
[1:13:48] go to drinking.
[1:13:52] It gets vitamin out of the water.
[1:13:55] And the Christian gets his vitamins from
[1:13:58] the word.
[1:14:01] Then what you do? Drink. Drink more and
[1:14:04] spread out. Push out. Push out.
[1:14:06] Salvation. Push out through the Holy
[1:14:08] Spirit. Push out till the crippled arm
[1:14:11] come straight. Just keep drinking.
[1:14:13] Drink.
[1:14:16] Planted by the inexhaustible fountain of
[1:14:19] life. Jesus Christ is the inexhaustible
[1:14:23] fountain of that
[1:14:24] life. Drink till you can't drink no
[1:14:27] more. Drink until you get become drunken
[1:14:30] that you forget all your theology and
[1:14:32] believe God and drink it where drink
[1:14:35] till you are well and just keep on
[1:14:38] drinking.
[1:14:40] Amen. The more you drink, the more
[1:14:43] you'll bear the results. The more you
[1:14:46] drink, the more you'll bear
[1:14:50] fruits. We are talking about bearing
[1:14:52] much
[1:14:54] fruit. Why? How?
[1:15:01] When isn't our lord good?
[1:15:05] What happens when you drink from the
[1:15:07] inexist inexhaustible fountain of life?
[1:15:09] Lord shows the father and it suffice at
[1:15:11] the what you have to do with the tree.
[1:15:14] You take the tree and you plant it in
[1:15:15] the ground and then you have no have to
[1:15:18] water it and as you water it, it doesn't
[1:15:20] do nothing but drink drink. It has to
[1:15:23] drink more than its portion.
[1:15:27] not satisfied with Psalms
[1:15:31] 23. That has become a
[1:15:34] habit. Many
[1:15:37] Christians, many people, many believers,
[1:15:40] they only read the family altar in the
[1:15:42] morning and then say it's done.
[1:15:48] Just read one scripture, one psalm. If
[1:15:51] the psalm is too big, make it into
[1:15:53] three, four quarters.
[1:15:58] Why? We don't have time.
[1:16:04] The morning we get down from the bed
[1:16:06] instead of the Bible we have phone in
[1:16:08] our hands.
[1:16:12] Check your screen time.
[1:16:17] You will know how much fruits you are
[1:16:18] bearing.
[1:16:22] I know it's hard brothers and sister but
[1:16:24] this place is very dangerous.
[1:16:29] I can't be good to you and I can't be
[1:16:31] hot to you.
[1:16:32] No. I don't want to be
[1:16:40] partial. We have limited
[1:16:43] God in every aspect of our life.
[1:16:51] I mean if you believe in
[1:16:55] tithing that means you have to give 2
[1:16:58] hours 40 minutes every day.
[1:17:06] Am I right brother? You need to give God
[1:17:11] 2 hours 40 minutes and more because he
[1:17:15] talks about more fruit.
[1:17:17] That's good. Not limited time fruit. No
[1:17:21] limited season. No fruit after
[1:17:29] fruit. Look what happens when it drinks,
[1:17:32] drinks, drink. It has to drink more than
[1:17:34] its portion. And more it drinks, the
[1:17:37] bigger it swells
[1:17:39] out. It just pushes out limbs. Then it
[1:17:42] pushes out leaves. Then it pushes out
[1:17:45] blossoms. Amen. Then it pushes out
[1:17:51] pushes out apple. Is that right? And
[1:17:53] that's the way a Christian is. We are
[1:17:56] planted together in Christ Jesus who is
[1:17:59] the inexhaustible fountain of life. We
[1:18:02] are planted in Christ and we just drink
[1:18:05] and drink and drink
[1:18:08] and push out and everything we have need
[1:18:11] of this earthly journey.
[1:18:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:18:18] I want to see you all in heaven.
[1:18:21] But if you don't want to see me, that's
[1:18:22] your
[1:18:27] problem, brother. We are on an earthly
[1:18:30] journey. This is not United States is
[1:18:33] not your citizenship.
[1:18:35] India is not my citizenship. Our
[1:18:38] citizenship is heaven. Yes, we have a
[1:18:41] permanent citizenship there.
[1:18:44] And we need while we are on this
[1:18:47] earth, we are in the
[1:18:50] need on this earthly journey. What is
[1:18:54] that? Divine healing, the power of God
[1:18:56] and all the other things in every
[1:18:58] individual in earth that receive the
[1:19:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Why?
[1:19:03] For you are planted in Christ.
[1:19:05] Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost baptism. Yes,
[1:19:08] sir. and everything you have need of
[1:19:10] this life's journey even the rapture is
[1:19:12] right in you
[1:19:17] then filled with the Holy
[1:19:20] Ghost. Do you
[1:19:22] know natural tribes
[1:19:26] spiritual? You know God vindicates us as
[1:19:30] he vindicates
[1:19:33] nature. As he vindicates nature he
[1:19:36] vindicates you. You must be born again.
[1:19:39] When you are born again, God vindicates
[1:19:40] you. That's how God vindicates all of
[1:19:43] his
[1:19:45] nature. By what? By the
[1:19:48] fruits. That's the way he vindicates his
[1:19:51] ministry. That's right. All of his
[1:19:53] servants are vindicated. The same way he
[1:19:55] vindicates
[1:19:56] nature. How do you know it's a peach
[1:19:59] tree? Because it brings peaches.
[1:20:02] How do you know it's an apple tree? It's
[1:20:04] bearing apples.
[1:20:06] How do you know it's a Christian?
[1:20:08] Christian science bear from it.
[1:20:12] Christian life comes out of it. How do
[1:20:14] you know he's a teacher? The word comes
[1:20:16] from him. Amen. How do you know he's a
[1:20:19] prophet? The word comes through him.
[1:20:21] Bears records vindication. It proves
[1:20:24] itself.
[1:20:26] How does it become when it dies and
[1:20:30] becomes one?
[1:20:36] And Paul said, "I die
[1:20:41] daily." Is there anybody who can say
[1:20:44] like Paul, I die
[1:20:46] daily. Is there anybody who can say like
[1:20:49] Paul said, "Follow me as I follow
[1:20:55] Christ." That's right.
[1:20:58] When we die and become a new creature in
[1:21:01] Christ Jesus, it gets us with our
[1:21:04] calling. We stay with our calling. The
[1:21:07] fruits of the spirit follows us when we
[1:21:10] are his servants. When we are born
[1:21:11] again, the fruit of Christ life follow
[1:21:14] us. That's right. How do you know it's a
[1:21:16] peach tree? It God's speeches. How do
[1:21:19] you know he's Christian? He acts like
[1:21:22] Christ. He walks like Christ. He talks
[1:21:25] like Christ. He lives like Christ above
[1:21:27] sin. Victorious. Nay, in all things we
[1:21:30] are more than conquerors.
[1:21:34] What does he do?
[1:21:37] See what I've done. Christ didn't do
[1:21:40] that. He gave all praise to the father.
[1:21:43] That's right. That's how you know. By
[1:21:46] their fruits you shall know
[1:21:48] them. Verily, verily I say unto you,
[1:21:51] except a man be born again, he cannot
[1:21:54] even understand the kingdom of
[1:21:59] God. You know, if you and I are filled
[1:22:02] with the Holy
[1:22:04] Spirit, bearing fruit is not a strange
[1:22:06] thing to you. Have faith in God. If you
[1:22:10] have been planted, rooted, and grounded
[1:22:12] in Christ, you will bear the fruits of
[1:22:15] Christ. You have to. Amen. If you got
[1:22:18] that experience, the fruit's no strange
[1:22:20] to
[1:22:24] you. Do you know winning someone to
[1:22:27] Christ is also one of the fruit?
[1:22:32] You know when when when when one person
[1:22:34] comes to the throne of
[1:22:36] God, 10,000
[1:22:39] words, the angels in heaven
[1:22:42] rejoice. And winning someone to Christ
[1:22:44] is also bearing fruit.
[1:22:48] hidden life with Christ. Notice it was
[1:22:51] after it was refreshed. After it
[1:22:54] yielded after the tree was refreshed,
[1:22:56] yielded these blossoms had to yield
[1:23:00] fruit. There's many people who has been
[1:23:02] Christian for years and never won
[1:23:05] another soul to Christ.
[1:23:08] They have never give a public testimony
[1:23:10] of their salvation in church or before
[1:23:13] people or on the streets or never
[1:23:16] testified to a sinner,
[1:23:18] woman or man in the work or somewhere.
[1:23:21] They can't yield fruit. Why? They can't
[1:23:24] get quite long enough. You got so many
[1:23:27] things to
[1:23:30] do. Brother, how are you? I'm
[1:23:33] busy. Sister, how are you? I am
[1:23:37] busy. We have learned the art of doing
[1:23:40] nothing.
[1:23:44] What? We have learned the
[1:23:47] art of doing nothing.
[1:23:55] What we need to do if we need to bear
[1:24:00] wolf planting the wine and where to
[1:24:03] plant it, we need enough sustaining
[1:24:07] moisture. A plant that's been in the
[1:24:09] desert place and doesn't have enough
[1:24:11] sustaining moisture, it will bear little
[1:24:14] naughty fruits. God is not interested in
[1:24:17] little naughty fruits.
[1:24:20] It doesn't look like the fruit that
[1:24:22] should come from the wine.
[1:24:25] My brother, sister, that's what it is
[1:24:27] with the churches today.
[1:24:30] The sinner comes in after maybe at home
[1:24:32] coming under conviction goes and reads
[1:24:35] his Bible and goes to the church and
[1:24:37] instead of finding great delicious
[1:24:39] apples right or great fruit the life of
[1:24:44] the Lord Jesus being reproduced in the
[1:24:46] church it's it finds what the unbeliever
[1:24:49] finds in the church little naughty worm
[1:24:56] eaten petty
[1:24:58] fruits petty thoughts.
[1:25:02] That's why brother John I always tell
[1:25:04] wherever I go when a newcomer has come,
[1:25:07] a visitor has
[1:25:09] come, go talk to them,
[1:25:13] love
[1:25:15] them, tell them you care for them, you
[1:25:17] love for them. You know, but what is
[1:25:19] happening? I have seen in my life,
[1:25:20] brother, people think I'm from a third
[1:25:23] world country. They can do whatever they
[1:25:24] want to. I'm not trying to be hard but I
[1:25:27] want to tell you they have formed
[1:25:30] groups as soon as the prayer is
[1:25:33] over. There are people they don't even
[1:25:36] want to shake hands of the visiting
[1:25:37] minister.
[1:25:41] When a newcomer comes they don't want to
[1:25:43] even shake hands.
[1:25:47] What they want is oh my dear how are
[1:25:49] you? You look so pretty.
[1:25:54] It's
[1:25:55] good. But first when a visitor has come,
[1:25:59] you show them the love.
[1:26:02] You appreciate that they have come.
[1:26:06] You appreciate a minister that he has
[1:26:08] come from so many miles or different
[1:26:11] place. I'm not trying to be hard, but
[1:26:15] I'm telling the truth.
[1:26:20] Some of them are so stiff like brother
[1:26:22] John they don't even look at you when
[1:26:24] you stand at the door.
[1:26:36] What is this? You are bearing fruit but
[1:26:40] it's a naughty fruit.
[1:26:43] It's a petty small
[1:26:45] fruit which should not come out from the
[1:26:50] wine but it has
[1:26:52] come shriveled shrunken
[1:26:56] warm eataten.
[1:27:03] When I read that, tears started pouring
[1:27:06] into my
[1:27:07] eyes. Said Lord maybe sometimes I have
[1:27:10] done that, neglected my brothers,
[1:27:12] neglected my
[1:27:18] sisters and we call ourselves
[1:27:27] believers. We must bring forth of of his
[1:27:31] fruits.
[1:27:32] Not our
[1:27:34] fruits. We must bring forth of his
[1:27:37] fruits in his
[1:27:39] season. Wisdom versus faith. Yes, sir. I
[1:27:43] love that. Don't you? Bring forth of his
[1:27:46] fruits in his
[1:27:47] season. Again, he says, "Bring forth his
[1:27:50] fruits." What fruits? The fruit of what?
[1:27:53] His
[1:27:54] fruits. His fruits. What fruits? His own
[1:27:58] fruits. What fruit is it? The Bible say
[1:28:02] all of it's here. The fruit of love,
[1:28:06] it's here in the Bible. Joy here, it's
[1:28:09] in the Bible. Holy Ghost, it's in the
[1:28:11] Bible. Power, it's in the Bible. Divine
[1:28:14] healing, it's in the Bible. Promises of
[1:28:17] God, it's in the Bible. What is all
[1:28:19] that? That's our fruits.
[1:28:22] Here it is. Even if he's planted in
[1:28:24] this, this is planted in the right kind
[1:28:26] of
[1:28:28] soil. In
[1:28:30] faith, what does faith do? Faith begins
[1:28:34] to grow
[1:28:35] it. Amen. He shall be like a tree that's
[1:28:39] planted by the waters. Bring forth his
[1:28:42] fruit in the season. Which fruit? His
[1:28:46] fruit. We need to be bearer of his
[1:28:50] fruit.
[1:28:51] What kind of fruit will it bring forth?
[1:28:53] John 14:12 said, Jesus said, "He that
[1:28:55] believeth on me, the works that I shall
[1:28:57] do, he do also." Why? The same words in
[1:29:01] him. He was in the word. That's right.
[1:29:04] And if he abide in me and my words in
[1:29:06] you, ask what he
[1:29:13] will. There is anybody who think this
[1:29:16] I'm not able to bear
[1:29:19] fruit we need to we need to look into
[1:29:23] that no fruit bearing we need to have
[1:29:29] restoration it's time to
[1:29:32] restore and the Lord said I will restore
[1:29:35] unto you all
[1:29:39] things not one thing which he likes
[1:29:42] which he can do which he can't do know
[1:29:45] all
[1:29:46] things. No fruit. We need to get back to
[1:29:51] restoration.
[1:29:57] There's no love in the relationship. Get
[1:29:59] back to
[1:30:04] restoration. If your brother, your
[1:30:05] sister is mad at you, get back to
[1:30:08] restoration. If you don't do that, God
[1:30:11] will not even answer your prayers.
[1:30:15] But before we can ever start bearing the
[1:30:17] fruit of his spirit, we will have to
[1:30:20] restore back all the things that the
[1:30:22] insects have eaten of.
[1:30:26] We'll have to go back and find out what
[1:30:29] the insects had
[1:30:34] eaten. Which insect?
[1:30:40] The insect which had destroyed your
[1:30:42] peace, crush it down.
[1:30:47] If the insect has divided you, your
[1:30:49] friendship, crush it down. Remove it.
[1:30:53] Amen.
[1:31:03] Is it too hard?
[1:31:06] It is
[1:31:07] hard but we need to take
[1:31:12] it. This is a correction
[1:31:21] facility. If you're not bearing the
[1:31:23] fruit, get back to
[1:31:27] restoration.
[1:31:29] Check what insects have we eaten. What?
[1:31:34] We'll have to go back and find out what
[1:31:36] that insects has
[1:31:39] eaten. Oh, praise the Lord. Before this
[1:31:42] wine of the Lord, the grape wine, he is
[1:31:44] the wine. We are the branches. And
[1:31:46] before we can ever find out or the
[1:31:49] church can stand in its formal and
[1:31:51] original power, we will have to go back
[1:31:53] and find out what the insects
[1:31:57] eat. And that church will have to be
[1:32:01] restored back to that or it will never
[1:32:03] stand in its power and glory of its
[1:32:06] first standing.
[1:32:10] You know the first standing is always
[1:32:12] the first standing
[1:32:14] brother. You believe it or
[1:32:19] not. If you want to come back to the
[1:32:23] original
[1:32:25] standard, you need to get back to
[1:32:29] restoration. What you need to do? Check
[1:32:32] what the insect
[1:32:36] have. You know what? If the fruit is not
[1:32:40] bearing, if the tree is not bearing the
[1:32:42] fruit, you know where the problem is?
[1:32:45] Says not only the fruit, the limbs,
[1:32:48] everything is eaten. Even the bark of
[1:32:50] the tree is also
[1:32:55] gone. What did the insect do? It has
[1:32:58] eaten the
[1:32:59] bark. And what is the bark? It's a sap
[1:33:03] line. And what is a sap line? It means
[1:33:06] lifeline.
[1:33:07] If the bark is tore off a tree, we got
[1:33:10] to get bark. Get bark back
[1:33:14] again. Grow the bark first.
[1:33:17] You can't have apples till you grow the
[1:33:20] bark.
[1:33:21] For the bark is the sapline. The sapline
[1:33:24] is the lifeline. And Jesus Christ is
[1:33:28] that lifeline. Amen.
[1:33:35] What we need
[1:33:38] today, we need to be
[1:33:40] convinced. We need to confess. And we
[1:33:43] need to believe.
[1:33:48] Now I am saved. Jubilee year. When you
[1:33:52] are thoroughly convinced that Jesus
[1:33:53] Christ is the son of God and in your
[1:33:56] heart, not in your imagination, but in
[1:33:59] your heart, something echoes down there
[1:34:01] and said, "Now I am saved. That's all
[1:34:04] you need right there, brother. Confess
[1:34:06] it out. Let your words go out and then
[1:34:09] watch. Watch your life from then on." No
[1:34:11] more than a corn could bear cockal
[1:34:14] burs. Neither could that man bear evil
[1:34:17] fruits. He will have to bear good fruit.
[1:34:21] Jesus said, "He that heareth my words
[1:34:23] and believeth on him that sent me has
[1:34:25] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:34:29] condemnation, but is passed from death
[1:34:31] unto life." That's because you
[1:34:35] believed. Not imagine, but you believe
[1:34:37] it. It become a thought in your heart.
[1:34:41] The next thing you are express it as a
[1:34:43] confession. He that will confess me
[1:34:46] before men him I will confess before my
[1:34:48] father the holy angel. Then something
[1:34:51] anchors. That's the reality.
[1:35:00] Zlo I want to live with this
[1:35:03] quote
[1:35:05] investments and that word in you
[1:35:08] produces the life of Christ.
[1:35:12] The life that's in you shows what you
[1:35:16] are. Listen to this. Your life testified
[1:35:19] so loud in you until your testimony is
[1:35:22] not heard.
[1:35:25] They know what you are by the life you
[1:35:28] live and the things that you do.
[1:35:32] Amen. God doesn't want us to be
[1:35:35] wishy-washy.
[1:35:37] I don't want to be called, you don't
[1:35:39] want to be called a wishy-washy
[1:35:40] Christian. Born again on Sunday, gone
[1:35:46] again from Monday to Saturday, gone
[1:35:49] again into the world, doing the things
[1:35:51] of the world. and on Sunday you act like
[1:35:54] a
[1:36:00] Christian doesn't like wishy-washy
[1:36:08] Christians. Isn't it beautiful, brother
[1:36:10] John? Your life testified so loud in you
[1:36:14] until your testimony is not heard.
[1:36:18] They know what you are by the life you
[1:36:20] live and the things you do. Now I want
[1:36:22] to tell you no matter how fathomless you
[1:36:25] go and dig it and bury it, one day the
[1:36:30] truth has to come out.
[1:36:33] Even the lies have to come up.
[1:36:39] They know what you are by the life you
[1:36:41] live and the things that you do. If the
[1:36:43] life of Christ is in you, then therefore
[1:36:47] the works of the life of Christ you live
[1:36:50] because that's his life living through
[1:36:52] you. You are just in a vessel to carry
[1:36:56] on the work of God. A
[1:37:01] vessel. Amen.
[1:37:06] That's why we read, "But the fruit of
[1:37:08] the spirit is love, joy, peace,
[1:37:13] longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
[1:37:16] faith, meekness, and
[1:37:19] temperance. How will bear that fruit
[1:37:22] abide in me? And I in you, as the branch
[1:37:25] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[1:37:28] abide in the vine, no more can he except
[1:37:31] he abide in me.
[1:37:34] Herein is my father glorified that he
[1:37:37] bear much fruit so shall he be my
[1:37:41] disciples. Do you know that we
[1:37:43] Christians have
[1:37:45] characters? Character is victory. What
[1:37:48] is the beauty of the church is the
[1:37:50] character of the people.
[1:37:52] I would like to just close with this.
[1:37:55] Talk about Christian character.
[1:37:58] When we talk about Christian character,
[1:38:00] we have to manifest nine
[1:38:03] graces means nine
[1:38:08] fruit. What is the manifestation of nine
[1:38:11] graces? The first three love, joy,
[1:38:15] peace. That's a character as an inward
[1:38:19] state that should be inside of us. Love,
[1:38:23] joy, and peace.
[1:38:25] The next four longsuffering uh next
[1:38:28] three long uh longsuffering gentleness
[1:38:32] and
[1:38:33] goodness that's a character in
[1:38:35] expression towards one
[1:38:38] another. I'll repeat it again. We have
[1:38:42] to display or manifest nine graces in
[1:38:46] our life. Love, joy,
[1:38:49] peace. That's the character of an inward
[1:38:52] state. longsuffering, gentleness,
[1:38:55] goodness. That's the character in the
[1:38:58] expression towards man.
[1:39:01] Faith, meekness, and
[1:39:03] temperance. These three are towards
[1:39:08] God. In you, out of you, and to God.
[1:39:12] Amen.
[1:39:14] These are the manifestations of nine
[1:39:16] graces. Love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:39:20] gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
[1:39:24] and
[1:39:26] temperance. Love, joy, peace should be
[1:39:28] in you. Longsuffering, gentleness,
[1:39:31] goodness, it's for others. Faith,
[1:39:34] meekness, temperance, it's towards
[1:39:38] God. What shall we do
[1:39:42] now? Let us bear fruit. Amen.
[1:39:47] One
[1:39:48] basket, two
[1:39:50] baskets, no
[1:39:53] plenty. Bear much
[1:39:56] fruits, bearing much fruit every day in
[1:40:00] and out
[1:40:03] season. Are you blessed by the word of
[1:40:06] God?
[1:40:07] I pray that this will be a great
[1:40:09] blessing to you.
[1:40:13] If there is anything that I have hurt
[1:40:15] you in my speaking, please forgive me
[1:40:18] for that. It's nothing
[1:40:22] intentional. But we need to keep on
[1:40:24] bearing the fruit so that our God may be
[1:40:30] glorified. God bless you. Thank you very
[1:40:32] much for your patience. Remember us in
[1:40:34] your prayers. Remember the ministry in
[1:40:36] India. Thank you, brother John. Praise
[1:40:39] the Lord.
[1:40:41] [Applause]
[1:40:52] [Applause]
[1:40:55] wants to keep bearing more
[1:40:57] fruit. Amen. It's a challenge for us. I
[1:41:00] think we were challenged this morning.
[1:41:03] It's easy to say, "I
[1:41:05] believe." It's easy to say, "Have a
[1:41:08] relationship with God." And it's another
[1:41:11] thing for it to be vindicated by the
[1:41:12] fruit that we
[1:41:14] bear. And I believe we were challenged
[1:41:17] to make sure that we are bearing fruit.
[1:41:21] Jesus himself told us by the fruit we're
[1:41:25] going to know who's
[1:41:27] who. And so it doesn't matter our
[1:41:30] testimony what we say. It
[1:41:33] matters what we're bearing when we're
[1:41:35] going through test and trials.
[1:41:39] that shows what's where if we really
[1:41:41] have the love of God, if we really have
[1:41:43] peace inside, whether we have joy or if
[1:41:46] we have to make sure everything is just
[1:41:50] right for us to be happy.
[1:41:53] I I think about
[1:41:56] uh the three Hebrew children and just
[1:42:00] the different situations in the Bible
[1:42:03] where you can still have peace, love,
[1:42:05] and joy and things not going right in
[1:42:08] your life.
[1:42:10] Yeah. You can be out of you can be out
[1:42:13] of money and still be the happiest
[1:42:14] Christian in the world. Amen.
[1:42:17] You you can you can be hated by somebody
[1:42:20] and still be in love with them
[1:42:24] because the love of God is without
[1:42:26] respect to persons. Amen. If it's inside
[1:42:29] you, that means God is inside you. Let's
[1:42:30] stand together
[1:42:32] and let's sing I believe Jesus
[1:42:41] saves. How many believe Jesus saves?
[1:42:43] Amen.
[1:42:48] Amen. I am coming to Jesus for
[1:42:54] rest. Rest such as the pure if I
[1:43:00] know my soul is a thirst to be
[1:43:06] blessed, to be washed and made wider
[1:43:10] than snow.
[1:43:13] I
[1:43:14] believe Jesus
[1:43:17] saves and his blood washes wider than
[1:43:23] snow. I
[1:43:26] believe Jesus
[1:43:29] saves and his blood washes wider than
[1:43:33] snow.
[1:43:36] Incoming my sin I
[1:43:40] deplore my weakness in poverty
[1:43:45] show. I long to be saved ever
[1:43:51] more to be washed and made wider than
[1:43:55] snow.
[1:43:57] I
[1:43:59] believe Jesus
[1:44:02] saves and his blood washes wider than
[1:44:08] snow. I
[1:44:10] believe Jesus
[1:44:13] saves and his blood washes wider than
[1:44:17] snow.
[1:44:20] To Jesus I give up my
[1:44:24] all. Every treasure and idol I
[1:44:29] know. For his fullness of blessing I
[1:44:35] call. Till his blood washes wider than
[1:44:40] snow. I
[1:44:43] believe Jesus
[1:44:45] saves and his blood washes wider than
[1:44:51] snow. I
[1:44:54] believe Jesus
[1:44:56] saves and his blood washes wider than
[1:45:01] snow.
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:04] Amen. Mercy rewrote my life.
[1:45:07] [Music]
[1:45:10] Oh
[1:45:12] mercy rewrote my
[1:45:18] love,
[1:45:20] mercy rewrote my

[1:45:36] mercy rero my
[1:45:42] love.
[1:45:44] Mercy rero my
[1:45:49] love. God's

[1:45:57] Oh, I should have fallen. My soul cast
[1:46:04] down but
[1:46:07] mercy rerow my life. One more
[1:46:12] time.
[1:46:14] Mercy rero my life. Just thank him for
[1:46:20] it.
[1:46:22] Mercy rro my life.
[1:46:27] When I look back, oh, I should have
[1:46:31] fallen. My soul cast down but
[1:46:37] mercy rerow my
[1:46:42] life. Oh
[1:46:46] pleasing, let me be
[1:46:50] pleasing to you.
[1:46:53] Let

[1:46:58] do be
[1:47:01] pleasing to
[1:47:03] you.
[1:47:05] [Music]
[1:47:07] Praying. Let
[1:47:10] everything I
[1:47:13] pursue be
[1:47:16] pleasing, oh
[1:47:17] Lord, unto you.
[1:47:21] [Music]
[1:47:27] pleasing. Let me be
[1:47:31] pleasing to
[1:47:33] you. Let
[1:47:35] everything that I
[1:47:39] do be
[1:47:41] pleasing to
[1:47:44] you. Praying.
[1:47:49] Let
[1:47:50] everything I
[1:47:54] pursue be
[1:47:56] pleasing, oh Lord, unto
[1:48:03] you. Amen. Amen. Maybe we could just
[1:48:07] have that flute play that as we go to
[1:48:10] the Lord in prayer. If we could just
[1:48:12] have every head
[1:48:13] bowed. Amen. Pleasing.
[1:48:16] Pleasing. Amen. And we just heard a
[1:48:19] beautiful word
[1:48:20] today, a word to to take us up
[1:48:26] higher. Amen. I just want us
[1:48:29] to look to the Lord as we go to him in
[1:48:33] prayer and just believe that that God
[1:48:37] wants us to truly bear not just part of
[1:48:41] this fruit now, but all of it. Amen. Our
[1:48:45] heavenly father, we come to you as a
[1:48:48] body of believers here
[1:48:51] today, Lord, desiring that in everything
[1:48:55] we would be pleasing to
[1:48:57] you. Lord, we don't believe that we
[1:49:00] heard from a man
[1:49:02] today. Our faith is much higher than
[1:49:05] that. We believe we heard from you. We
[1:49:09] heard from your heart and your desire
[1:49:12] that that that the whole world, those
[1:49:15] that we come in contact with, they would
[1:49:18] see all the fruit of the spirit bearing
[1:49:21] in
[1:49:23] us. And God, we know that can only
[1:49:26] happen by you living inside of us. So
[1:49:30] God, we invite you in. We invite your
[1:49:34] spirit. We invite your word in as as uh
[1:49:38] your prophet said, the only way that we
[1:49:40] can bear the fruit is have the word of
[1:49:42] God living and abiding inside of us.
[1:49:46] Your holy spirit. God, I pray Lord for
[1:49:49] every believer here, every believer
[1:49:51] watching, Lord, every believer
[1:49:54] listening, Lord, that you would grant to
[1:49:56] them whatever whatever parts of the
[1:49:58] fruit, Lord, that they're desiring to
[1:50:01] have, Lord, whatever part they're
[1:50:03] looking to extend, to bear more fruit,
[1:50:08] Lord, to those that are desiring just to
[1:50:10] have more of it in their life. I pray
[1:50:12] for everyone that you would grant to
[1:50:14] them that you would be glorified in
[1:50:16] their body. Amen. Oh granite, Lord, that
[1:50:18] they would bear much fruit and and Lord,
[1:50:21] that you would be pleased with them,
[1:50:23] Father. Oh God, we are your bride and
[1:50:26] Lord, we just want to be found pleasing.
[1:50:29] We receive your word today. We receive
[1:50:32] it into our heart and we're taking it
[1:50:34] home with us and we're going to apply
[1:50:36] it. Lord, we thank thee for all these
[1:50:39] things now. We pray then.
