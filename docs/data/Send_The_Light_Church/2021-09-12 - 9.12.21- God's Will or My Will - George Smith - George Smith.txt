think about it he wants to think about everything else but we just want to keep focusing that one day he's going to call us [Laughter] amen to that kick them in the face on the way out amen god bless you uh you you cannot be seated um good to see brother bruce sister down but i want to say amen to that amen um i want to thank you for your prayers for the new church and for the getting the occupancy permit um there are some things that we need to change um like the the door handles instead of being around like this they have to be levers and because it has to be ada compliant so even though the real good door handles that we got right now to change them and there's like 16 doors so there's quite a few doors that have to be changed um we have to change one of the toilets because we got to get the toilet handle on the other side and just in case and so we're going to do it and we'll do whatever we got to do and we're thankful honestly that we don't have to do more than what we have to do but it may delay and if we may not get in shall we say to the first week maybe of next month so we may have one more prayer meeting here but that'd be okay amen so i want to say thank you thank you for your prayers i believe in them amen i think when brother ron snuck in he didn't know i was there but i was there when he snuck in to see the place we had a whole boatload of people there working but we're thankful for everybody that's been attached in some way and i'll say it like this you've all been attached to prayer amen yeah so thank you um it is a great honor and a great privilege to have brother george smith with us it is really impossible to know all that brother george is doing because he's helping so many people in so many areas for so long but just know that when you're praying for brother george and you're giving for the missions for brother george that it's it's helping somebody somewhere amen amen and uh he's helping in areas that that and i'll just say you can see god orchestrating his missionaries because they don't all do the same thing go to the same places and all you know help the same person and um i want you just to get behind what our brother tells us today and and just ask god to open the vision help you to see more so when you are praying it isn't just you're in a room that's dark and doesn't seem like the words are going past the ceiling but that there's they're going to be affecting someone out there somewhere around the world we uh we appreciate brother george and that he's just so down to earth and um we just we love them and look up to him and pray that you're blessed this morning let's sing only believe as our brother comes to give us the word of life amen [Music] believe all things are possible only believe [Music] all things are possible only [Music] god bless you may be seated it's good to be in the house of the lord again today and know that he's with us yeah we've had a a restful time here in michigan they didn't put me to work but i'm not leaving until tomorrow so who knows but anyway brother john has done his best to uh make him comfortable and uh you know even the dog loves me so that's a lot right there but this morning having the one service we're going to uh take our time and and try to say something be a blessing to everybody you can't remember at all that's why we're making a you know dvd back there take it home chew on it some more but it's good to uh be in michigan in this time of the year when the weather's pleasant i've been here other times and you know but god makes us you know he makes us to where we can just be flexible yeah i'm not a fair-weather missionary so if you have your bible let's turn into psalms 143 just for a few places here to get our our bearings for this morning's service the title today is my will or god's will yeah let's stand together as we read the scripture psalm 143 and verse 8 where the word says uh 143 yesterdays cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning for in thee do i trust cause me to know the way wherein i should walk for i lift up my soul unto thee deliver me o lord from my enemies i flee into thee to hide me teach me so teaching means we've got to pay attention teach me to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness quicken me o lord for thy name's sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble and of thy mercy cut off my enemies and destroy them that afflict me that afflict my soul for i am thy servant now a few pages to the right we have proverbs 14 proverbs 14 and verse 12 where the word tells us there's a way which seemeth right unto a man but the way thereof are the ways of death so your way might not be the best way you know we nobody wants to go to hell we try to do right but we need to find god's will now way over farther we find the book of jonah it's a little ways before malachi one of the minor prophets here and we can hopefully learn something from brother jonah this morning jonah chapter 1 and verse 1 now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of amitai saying arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me heavenly father we thank you for your mercy today we thank you that you've woke us up there's many people never got out of bed today they went straight to the mortuary thank you lord that you've put a will in us to be together to fellowship to worship you to pray to sing and lord to sit under the sound of the gospel one more time bless your people here today bless those that might hear it later on the on the dvd or whatever lord we're in your uh stead here we're trying to say what is right bless your people help us in jesus name amen maybe seated so what we have here our scene is jonah was an israelite okay he was a jew and he lived in a little town called geth hepper just north of nazareth up in galilee and he was the first foreign missionary now if you doubt anything i said well write on a piece of paper and give it to john he'll give you the answer but we have done some research and we we uh we try to speak what's true so he's the first foreign missionary and in the new testament that's called an apostle it's one that is sent out and even our prophet said that's the highest calling you know when the the callings in ephesians 4 11 doesn't start with prophet surprise surprise starts with missionary okay our prophet says in the message end time in 1954 i believe every christian is obligated now not so much that you have to go over to the old country and preach but if you can't go you can help somebody else to go now see i'm saying things that you guys have heard for years because this is the only church i know of it's called send the light tabernacle and you're interested in getting the light over there the dark places so we're just reviewing a few things he says everybody should hear the gospel at least once okay i want to do my part he says there's something about missionary work that i just love it and just to know that what you're doing comma you're doing god's will when you're giving to missions amen in other words you can't go wrong so missionary work isn't so much traveling you know way far away um you know where they don't speak your language and eat some food that doesn't you know you can't identify it and so forth uh you know now they do have kfc in most places in fact we were over in africa several years ago and my son was with me and and they had bought some kfc and i'm brought to the dinner and we were enjoying it and these poor people you know they just didn't know they said well do they have that or where you live yeah colonel sanders right down the road there so it isn't a matter of going you know just roughing it as such but missionary work is living for others right here now we assume because everybody's got a bottle in their house that they they know what's going on oh that's not true no no people don't have a clue sometimes so everybody wants eternal life all the catholic nuns want eternal life all the people from salt lake want eternal life and no one's no one wants to be uh eternally separated from god you know and they all want to go to heaven they just don't want to go today put it off you know yeah so um the scripture says in proverbs 28 29 18 without a vision the people perish but with the vision with the missionary vision we're living for others you know we we we see farther away and we're not trying to make everybody you know a reader of william branham no just trying to shed the light it'll hit with with uh uh eagles others just bounces off i mean you experiencing it with your own relatives no matter what you say they're not interested so you just live your life that day on calvary 1960 he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for you now what must we do the first thing i want to say is jesus never lived for himself amen his life was spent for others that is perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and do good things that's fine but when you live your life just to yourself you don't have and you're not expressing eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved that when he came as the lamb of god he lived and had eternal life because he lived did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day on calvary and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others and when you read through the four gospels you'll see that jesus didn't spend time with the high and mighty he spent time with people we would maybe not even let in this church hit the road but he spent time with those people he lived for others now the missionary work that we're involved in we're going to cover this part first and we'll go on into jonah but um in acts 11 29 we have um where that we have the basis here for what we're trying to accomplish uh let's see acts 11 29 then the disciples every man according to his ability determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in judea that was up in jerusalem which also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul that is the basis for missionary work that we're even trying to accomplish today you see and for example we have i don't know how much you've read about it or heard about it but in venezuela it's right at the top of south america it used to be the crown and the best economy of entire south america we lived there one time and uh sure they had difficulties and it was hot and all that but they had an economy that was going forward but then in 1999 they elected a socialist president and today they're over i i don't even know the number today but it's well over four thousand percent inflation you can't it can't grow you can't have an economy like that so what happens um you've got people that are you know they've got jobs you know but they're paying them in the local currency which is basically worthless now a church of 150 people some of them have jobs no hardly anybody drives to church because the gasoline is so bad it ruins the injectors and the converter and everything else so they don't buy the cheap gas it used to be five cents a gallon oh that was nice yeah i drove there you know you got changed in the thing here by the in the console keep the change fill it up you didn't think about gasoline and it was good so now it's four dollars a gallon and it's it's not good gasoline okay so these people walk to church there's no bus service they walk and in this 150 people this is just an example there's there's probably in venezuela alone there would be over 100 churches but this one church just for an example would uh take up the tithes and offerings now when they uh go to buy something or pay for the light or whatever it's got to be dollars not that the country is dollarized because there's no dollars in the bank you can't go get dollars out of the bank out of the cash machine but that is what they trade in you know the market everything is in dollars so out of this 150 people at the times and offerings there might be twenty dollars worth we can't do much they've got a this one church has a um uh it's like a it's gonna call it a bus but it's like our airport shuttle you know a small bus well the bearings wore out in the rear tires the rear axle so i'm talking to the brother and he he wouldn't he wouldn't ask for anything he would never ask for anything but he's telling me a sad story about these bearings that they bought and they were made somewhere and they didn't work and you know they can't run this thing they would try to get some good gas and go get some of the people well anyway i said we can help you we've got you know you know auto parts right here so i got the exact number and the picture and all that and invested i think 200 for that then we ship them to miami then we have a brother in miami who has a shipping company yeah it's a believer and he sends it and it'll be at their door within a few days and they can get this thing running so there is a solution so when you when you give it goes to things like that things that can actually be tangible yeah now in some cases we're keeping people off the street if we don't help them they're going to be sleeping under the you know trees buying food not everybody obviously but there's a few families that need help and so in venezuela they they they get together the brothers ministers get together once a month so the first monday of the month they get together they share their needs and so forth and um they're doing fine you know spiritually but we try to help them one brother had a uh he's on his bicycle and somehow he got hurt in an accident and his his wrist was you know immobile so he goes in and whatever operation they did didn't work right so now he's got infection and the infection's got to disappear before they go in and get it right so he goes in tomorrow check that out so i asked them okay how much for the operation because you know they're real careful they don't want to beg and but i got to get some numbers you know is it two thousand what is it six hundred dollars well fine you can't even get in the door here at a hospital six hundred dollars so so i said okay you get get the infection out we've got six hundred dollars ready to go now how do we send money to venezuela good question thank you for asking they don't have money gram they don't have anything it's cut off from the real world because they want to be like cuba i've been to cuba there's nothing to replicate it's all gray there's no no color no nothing and so and so since 1959 or 60 they've you know been cut off and they said well we're suffering because america well there's 195 other countries that you could trade with you know but anyway um the uh the system is is really bad because they want to be like cuba it's all socialist the only thing that keeps it running is a little bit of oil money because they've let the system they've not kept the pipes clean and everything and they um they have um drugs yeah a lot of drugstore too that's cash you know and that keeps things going well it's bad news so we're trying to help them just stay above water so they can at least breathe and um you know be able to eat so there's many other things we can tell you about venezuela but it's just that it's very bad and we're helping also the money so how do we get money to them so i have a an account with chase bank being a veteran we get some benefits and so um uh down there there's you know a guy he's a pharmacist or he has some kind of company he's a friend of a friend of a friend so um he has an american many people have an american bank account miami so from my chase account i can transfer for free into whoever i sure don't know him but he's trusted by them and then once i put the money in then i said okay here's the transfer number so much is in that account right well then that goes to person a or b and so for three percent commission well everybody's got to eat you know so for three percent they will get their money and they can go on with their business and that's how we get money in it looks like money laundering well thank you mr biden that's because of our sorry government things like that happen then we have for example peru which is very very bad with the covert people dying just all kinds of things and it's just right there i mean this is 21st century but see we live one way and you don't have to go very far from right here to see that people are suffering i mean when i come through the airport in detroit on wednesday here's these people you had thought we were in tehran i mean they're all dressed they got the you know 17 bags because there's a direct flight to to amman jordan yeah boom you're there i've been over there and so yeah peru is very bad as far as that we're trying to help some of them and um and then for example in malawi malawi is in the middle of africa below the equator it's down you know in the lower half very poor people but they're very happy in the lord and i was over there in uh 19 when you could still travel a brother from south africa came we met there and traveled around saw a lot of churches this one church we were in there was easily 500 people now they didn't have nice chairs they didn't know no backs it was it was blocks and a board and that's where you sit and nobody's moving around they're paying attention but they only had okay so here's 500 people and there's no glass in the windows you know it's all open air and uh and they have two light bulbs one's way back there and one's right here well guess what light bulbs attract bugs so i'm talking through this you know through an interpreter so i'd say something so while he's speaking for you know five seconds bug comes from so thankfully it was while he was talking had mouth closed and he got caught in mustache but these people pay attention they're happy to be part of the you know of the gospel and so i noticed a very few people had bibles and so i asked well how come people well they can't afford them well we're going to buy them bibles what language do you need so they wrote down so many in each language went to town sure enough there's a bible society oh yeah we have those those languages so we bought the bibles every house has a bible now amen how can you preach to people don't have a bible so one by one another church we were in malawi uh they had um uh probably 120 people or so and the interesting thing is they don't put the babies way over there no they have a they have a rug right here in the middle of the floor and that's where the children they're right there and they're paying attention they're under the sound of the gospel mother's right there looking deacons are looking they pay attention okay interesting and so uh after i left come to find out that the brother that had you know donated the land for this church uh he wanted it back he was very militant he said this is mine now we're gonna do things this way and if you don't like this stay out so the majority of the people are out under a tree okay and so uh they wrote to me and said look we have uh their money's very different from ours but we've got you know two-thirds or more of the purchase price for this piece of ground we need a little bit of help so we can finish buying that ground and get church up and so they needed like a thousand dollars well by the time i got you know through shuffling and finding a thousand dollars the catholic church bought the piece of property okay i thought don't worry god's got something better for you you know and um god didn't want you downtown he wants you out here so they started looking so outside of town they found a place uh in our measurement probably like three acres and so it's just it's just rough i mean nothing's ever been there and they said yeah this this will probably work so we helped them that bought the land well then they had to you know scrape it off to build a have a building site and they're all excited but we're going to have our own place and so they said we're going to we're going to call this george smith tabernacle i said no i don't think so now we're going to call this walking in the light tabernacle ah yeah we like that so they went and registered the name and so then i mean you imagine a church about the size of this whole building here and they're out there digging the foundation with pick and shovel and we're gonna publish a letter here this month hopefully and show you the pictures but anyway they're digging the foundation i didn't tell them what size to build they know what they need we just said we'll help you and so um they um they dug the foundation got the concrete in got the bricks now they they don't have a uh when they deliver the bricks it's not like here the semi comes up and a little loader comes off no truck parks all the bricks fly off now you got two piles of bricks now these bricks are fired so they're not breaking but there's the piles and jobs over there so we gotta have people so they have all kinds of people to help and they got all they got it up and um and they got the roof on and just this week they're pouring the concrete floor and they've already done the plumbing the electric and it's just very different from what we do we don't have any officials like you guys have coming around you know change that you got to wonder but anyway they're they're moving along and that's going to be done in the next 30 days or so only thing they got to do now is to uh put the what you call plaster on the walls and plant some trees they'll be in business they're very anxious to get in because they've been meeting under a tent and it's hot of course right now it's kind of cool over there but anyway they're doing fine and so the brother said boy it should be nice if we had air conditioning well they don't understand air conditioning air conditioning has got to be a tight building you're going to condition this there not everything around so i explained that to him and said look i know it's hot in the summertime but look about putting some fans on the wall you know to keep the air moving oh yeah a good idea yeah because even if you could afford air conditioning okay so let's say that this church is air conditioned well that's the only air conditioning they know so they're going to sit in this nice room but then they're going to go out there they're going to come back somebody's going to get sick you can't be you know going back and forth well anyway um they're um they're about to finish that church it's been a long project probably over a year now but they're they're very very humble people they're very honest and we need such and such so the bank transfers to their account they go build we need this much and it's for this huge church you'll see it when we get to publish but it's probably if you squeeze the people in you probably get 800 people in there um we're going to be under 50 000 to build it roof and all and everything well um so it's out there out of town a little ways well the neighbors you know people live in the other farms around there they're wondering what's that building over there you know so they come around they've been baptizing people every day so they're going to fill it up with the neighbors yeah god you know he knows where the eagles are amen and we don't have to go you know convince some people it's just if it's real you know so the book of acts is still being written amen you know it's the only book in the bible that's not finished it goes on and on and on and we're we're a part of it now the um the other thing that we've been doing is the uh the church age book has been it's been around since 65. well the spanish translation has been out since about 1970. and when i translate it into spanish yes i'm bilingual so you know the story it's on online but um i took the liberty to to break down some paragraphs put numbers on them and bring in the scriptures so that you could you could see when you're reading it you know well that was fine everybody's been enjoying that since 1970. but then the english people started seeing this well how come our book doesn't look like that you know and so i talked to my brother-in-law and said look these people want this and he told me years ago saw that never works you know people already got the page numbers memorized we're not going to mess with that okay then about less than 10 years ago the brother some other brothers were telling me look our grandchildren are not reading this it's one long paragraph and they're not you know they're not reading it we need it like the spanish book looks and so i wrote to them again and i'm just telling you this so you'll know that we're not doing stuff under the table and i wrote to both of my brother-in-laws and i said look here's the english here's the spanish there's a demand for the english book to look like the spanish book so that you can read it easier not change any words just you know format it a little differently they said no no we're gonna leave it the way dad left it fine i said look when i initially approached him i said look uh i can get this ready and send it to you you print it and sell it or and then if if we do that then you know it's your job it's your book but or i the second choice is i can get it ready and i'll print it and i'll take you know send it out and i'll send you a dollar and a half for every book we sell well not anybody with a business brain you know no no we're not going to touch that we're going to leave the way dad left it okay well it just so happens at that same time they made a decision to go from one dollar a book that they were selling to 750 book every language every country well those people can't afford that so once they answer that way i just prayed for 10 minutes and we've launched out on our own program don't send them nothing because you know contracts contract but they didn't accept it so the book has been going out you people have seen it everybody loves it and uh brother berry coffee has contacts in china big precious you know they do volume over there so we sent him the the first was the spanish text they printed it sent initially printed twenty thousand because sent five thousand mexico city five thousand to honduras and 5 000 to colombia on the west coast another 5 000 were going to uruguay but they couldn't get their stuff together so those 5 000 went to honduras so they got 10 000 and they're distributing it they're getting it out you know happy to be a part of something it comes to them free all they got to do is distribute it and so because of covid then there was no communication with the with the countries i mean you couldn't just go over like chicago you had to there was no no passage well there's a missionary brother was down there in honduras and he was going to go to nicaragua so i said well hey since you're going how about going over there and getting you know a couple boxes of books and taken to nicaragua because they can't go through oh yeah okay so they got i think six boxes so they get to the border and they're gonna go through oh no no no you know we can't do that in fact we're gonna charge you five dollars per book just to get it in well we'll just back up and rethink this so they go back well of course the guy's on the other phone the side of the border they got cell phones they're waiting for this brother and they said well uh well we got some guys here with some horses we'll send them across the river it's not very deep and you guys can load them up and get them across that way sure enough wrap them all in plastic put them on the horses and they went through and the guys over there i think they gave them 10 cents a book to get them in so there's ways and uh so then we printed the english book and it's going to different countries that aren't going to get it any other way there's no other possible way to get this book in their hands but for us to step in get the book printed get it sent to each country that can you know spread from there and um they they're happy with the book you know so uh we have a little video clip here we want to show you this let me just tell you the books came into the west coast of of uh colombia and then they got to be sent to these other places i see that guy he's carrying two boxes of books that's uh 60 pounds worth yeah so down there someplace is the is the border and they snuck them across into ecuador and then they load them in this they're they ordered 40 boxes so they'll load them into this truck and they will be distributed throughout ecuador they don't have simple ways of doing things you've got to sneak it in pay somebody a little bit of money and um so yeah even the women were carrying them so these were these were bundled up in china sent to colombia now they're in ecuador and these guys are they're workers you know yeah they're willing to help and even though the sisters were carrying some some of those boxes but yeah they're now look they're carrying 60 pounds on their back going uphill amen i saw you carrying those bags of feed the other day this weighs more but anyway that's that's one way of getting it into the next country they don't have the facilities that we have you know so the brother in colombia he's all set up with the government with the permits and stuff so he can get more uh currently they're printing another 20 20 000 in china to send some to mexico city and to honduras and to colombia and to chile because from chile it's more of a first world country and they can print i mean they can they can ship it out to the neighboring countries so yeah these brothers are just expressing their their gratitude and they're happy to be a part of it so these are our brothers you know yeah and they want me to come down there and i can't go right now because of the situation but we can stay here and get stuff to them and so now we're working on the seal book to get it printed in china and get it distributed just like that so english and spanish it'll be it'll be a little more readable and i must add because of the fact brother branham never wanted his material to go out just verbatim word for word he knew his limitations he said what if this gets into the hands of people at princeton or somebody and think we're a bunch of ignoramuses he wants it readable you know and so uh the seal book has been reprinted several times but it just needs to be combed through take some light sandpaper and make it readable without changing any any uh meaning so that's what we're doing and thanks to brother john in his upper room where he stuck me i was able to have some quiet time except when you know the dog needed attention and so we're making some progress so pray for us on that approach to the seal book and um there's you know like say many other things going on people have emergencies and we try to help where we can and what you people have done every month has been a big help because sometimes we don't know lord we don't know the program you know we live right now and yesterday's gone we can't change what happened yesterday but we said what we did what we ate that's gone we don't know about tomorrow amen you know you don't have any guarantee get your head on the pillow tonight but we live now so we we operate in the present and that's what we're trying to do is do what we can now and god always supplies our needs okay let's get on with brother jonah because uh i'm sure you all had a good breakfast two cups of coffee and we're not in a hurry to go are we okay okay got a commitment so jonah had a direct commission from god go preach to the enemy their wickedness has come up before me i can't stand it anymore go preach repentance there was only one serious problem jonah was jewish and the people of nineveh were gentiles very serious segregation so we brought the level so that we can let's see if we make a stick here you know i was in africa one time and they gave me a pulpit and it was like a like a music stand you know solid steel and just a sharp edge like this uh what i'm gonna do well guess what this is magnetic so just stuck it on but anyway you all get the picture put it right here where you can see it um the uh the thing with jonah he was out of balance because they had very serious segregation now all through the bible i hate to say it but all through the bible they had segregation arabs lived here the jews lived here everything was fine but the great american way we're going to put them all together might work better it hasn't worked out too good so um now nineveh was the capital of assyria which is currently northern iraq they were very wicked sinful people very cruel violent city of over 120 000 people a large city took three days to walk around it okay and these assyrians up there were constantly tormenting and oppressing the israelites they didn't start in 1948 it started 3 000 years ago they've been trying to put out this light ever since so god was sending his prophet right into the jaws of danger okay to face the enemy go cry against it it's time for repentance warning before judgment so god always warns before judgment when jesus was walking over in israel he went all these towns and villages preaching and healing the sick and three villagers in particular weren't paying attention they didn't realize the value they just didn't believe and so he blasted them real hard it's betsaida korotsim and capernaum okay and he said what he said life went on people you know did their thing but 60 years later when they had forgotten what he said because you know they didn't they didn't write it down and there was very few if any eyewitnesses left 60 years later god sends the earthquake and destroys those three towns the only life there is today is in capernaum because the catholics own that little piece of land and they've made a bit of a tourist thing out of it so you can come see where it was but the fact is that god does care for his own and what he says is correct even the the tour guides over there just the regular israel people they say you better believe the bible look what jesus said and those three places are a pile of rocks everything else in israel has been reconstructed you know people live there not in those three places so fast forward and we're over here in 2021 but our prophet spoke in california uh choosing a ride in 1965 and you know the blast he gave there and he says it it'd be a piece three to four hundred miles wide that's pretty big chunk 1200 miles long it's gonna break off and there's no repair no fema no nothing you know so it's coming amen so why is that important to us because in first corinthians 10 11 all these things happen to them for examples and are written for our admonition who's our who's us upon whom the ends of the world are come that's us that's not the days of paul no not even days of william brown it's our days now is the end time we are the end time generation the end of the ages is at the door so whatever we're going to do we've got to do now and so the world is falling apart jesus told us over in luke 21 uh 28 when you see these things happening look up there's no repair you're not going to fix it don't waste your time don't waste your money look up we're leaving so that's where we're at now so once again we have a message of warning before judgment okay simple and to the point only believe repent or perish with the unbelievers you have a choice okay you can choose and uh you know comply with the unbelievers and uh be careful i know you got to work but you can be a christian you know so we need a shaking we need a a to shake off the shackles of unbelief the shackles of the attitude of no concern and who cares we need a trimming off just like some of those trees over pastor's house see if i stayed another three days i'd be out there with with my buddy here and we'd get us a trailer and we'd cut some of that stuff and put it in the trailer and go burn it you know so that we can you know see out got a lot of stuff growing there but we need cutting away and cutting away of the lazy idle no interest attitude and we need a cutting away of the idolatry because it's big it's far beyond time for an aspirin or alka-seltzer a pat on the back you're going to be okay we're not going to be okay we need major surgery we need the truth not another cute little sermon no we can't afford to continue to play church it's high time that we actively seek the presence of the lord in our individual lives it's nice while we're here but we can't stay here we've got to go out there got to go face those people so we we gear up here to go out there you see so we need to get in our individual closet how we can please him and find god for god's will for our individual lives now first john 4 20 says if a man says i love god because everybody loves god no problem and hates his brother or starts narrowing down if a man says he loves god and hates his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he can see how can he love god whom he can't see so however we treat each other believer to believer you see that's the way we treat god that's why we manifest to each other that's the way we love god okay so he's watching our reaction to these situations to these tests they see all the problems that we have in america don't worry about the rest of the world everything's going wrong right here god could solve all of that by sunrise tomorrow yeah he could get it all arranged kill these people but these people he could do it all right but he lets it go and go and go and he watches our reactions you see that's right yeah now jonah was god's man of the hour okay he had a clear cut decision from god um a commandment from god go cry against their sin and their corruption i know about the segregation i know all about your fears and your doubts go anyway verse three but oh got a problem but jonah rose up the next morning to go to tarshish from the presence of the lord and he went down to joppa down to the port and he found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the pharaoh and went down into it to go with them unto tarshish second time from the presence of the lord it's not looking too good brother not looking good now he wasn't just anybody okay he was god's prophet of the hour he was god's mouthpiece but it's looking bad he didn't break relationship he was still god's man he broke fellowship and that happens to us we stay home we start getting cold and indifferent sorry bunch you're still god's child and you will pay for that wrong decision just like he paid but if you're god's child he will bring you back if you're not we'll let you go you know so brother brahm says anointed prophets make wrong decisions sorry to break your bubble but they're humans that's true so here he goes down to the coast down where the boats are and um he finds one going the wrong way you know tarshish and so he uh he gets his money out you know pays his fare going on vacation and uh now these people operate in the boat there are no dummies they're they're watching the weather they got you know they got grain that they're taking to rome it could be the boat could be a hundred feet long carrying 300 tons of grain that's a lot of valuable stuff you see so they're if it's stormy they just stay put so it looks good they take off and they get out there a little ways in the mediterranean and the storm comes we didn't see this coming and it starts getting bad they start pitching stuff off the boat so it won't sink and uh and they said where's that tourist we got where's that guy let's see he wasn't wearing his prophet suit he didn't have you know elder or whatever no he was just he looked like the rest of them just like peter when he snuck into the yard there to get his hands warm by the enemy's fire they didn't know who he was until he said thank you for the t you're from galilee you're one of them never heard of him big liar he had the keys you know another another message but anyway um where's that tourist so they get him up there look at this mess well guys i know what the problem is i'm the problem now it's real simple you throw me over everything be fine really try it well god had a fish prepared now we're not going to worry about what size it was and what his name was but the fish was coming right along the boat he was following the boat you know god was directing him so when they threw jonah overboard he barely got wet because right into it now he's in the stomach of the fish yeah it was a special fish because it had oxygen okay that was the only benefit there was no light no nothing and all of a sudden it says right there in the bible had seaweed you know around his neck he's in bad shape okay it's soft everywhere oh man this is this is weird he didn't know how long he's going to be in there he thought might be from now on he didn't know right and so but the thing is there's no surprises with god it's a special fish and everything he touched you know was was you know soft and oh you can imagine he couldn't see symptoms were everywhere next time you think you got it bad for whatever reason get your bible out uh-huh you got it we got it pretty nice here so he had plenty of time to focus on the decisions he made in chapter three here in verse three but jonah arose to go from the presence of the lord oh now we're going to cover this don't worry we're not we're not going to leave him in hell we're going to he comes back so he learned right away to keep his mouth shut i mean you can imagine bad enough yet smell it you know and so um he decided these symptoms are all lying vanities now he could touch he could taste he couldn't see he could hear he could smell but god gave him oxygen okay and he prayed earnestly he didn't see thank you lord for the hamburger goodnight no a little more than that right no no because he was on unforeseen circumstances well i thought it was going to be different according to my calculations i mean how many times have you heard that well yeah brother john i seen the way i got it figured out well solomon said it's all vanity yeah so save the save the effort so the symptoms are very real and he had to ignore the present reality and focus his mind on the word of god he didn't have an ipad didn't have a cassette recorder didn't have spoken word book he had nothing only what he'd stored see so um he he got very serious about praying and he didn't know it was only going to be three days brother brahm says the devils tremble when the weakest of saints goes to their knees what a power and privilege has been given to the church of the living god when you fall to your knees in prayer even the devils tremble to the weakest of them think of it and the weakest christian here tonight can defeat satan anywhere anyplace anytime under any circumstances with thus saith the lord amen just believe it here god sends mighty prophet elijah into the most you know fantastic age of all ages they didn't have cell phones in but they got a lot of other stuff they had nice cars and you know 1965 had some good stuff but he sends profit with only believe that was the size of his message he didn't come to combat all the science no so why was why was jonah in this situation now it looks like so apparently is the key word key word here apparently he shirked away apparently he evaded his duty he ran from responsibility he ran from the presence of god he ran from the will of god and opted for his own will i want to do it this way you see remember my will or god's will only the fellowship was broken not the relationship so every one of you had to make a decision today amen now you're looking at one person i hope everything's straight you know but i'm looking at all the different colors some are smiling some are thinking about walmart some are thinking about lunch you know i'm not a prophet but i know people so you made a choice some people are still on the couch with their favorite friend the remote you know but we have three kinds of believers in every group so jonah made a choice and he was willing to pay the price and go his own way that's right okay now we're going to get to hear how serious it is here in a minute he just didn't have any idea how high the price was going to be see he chose to go the opposite direction okay so we're in fenton and god says go to toronto and he says i think i'll go to indianapolis instead 180 degrees basically and so um he probably thought well you know there's probably centers over in tarsus i'll go preach over there not so much hassle you know and god would have blessed the word regardless but obedience is far better than sacrifice okay and um uh i'm sure that we all have testimonies to that effect but you see if we look at the the catholics the baptist charismatics they're all using the same bible yes right you know got a little bit of twist to it but it's the same word of god and many are being blessed many are being healed there's miracles because they believe they're approaching god that's the only channel they know you know and then they see some of us our weirdo people blasted them bro around said your neighbors don't care what brother branham said they want to see the reality of the word god honors faith and he has provided a way some of us are tuned in you know so over here in thirsting for life 1960 the prophet says and this great pillar of fire the angel of god the logos that went out of god that led the children of israel to the wilderness when it came amongst the people the day of pentecost it separated itself and great looks of fire began to come down on each one as a pillar fire began to break up god dividing himself among his people oh that ought to tear the heart out of anybody god tearing himself apart that he might divide himself a little bit to each one of us so then he says he says can you see why i'm standing for the unity of every church now we know that's not exactly the end of the story that's a comma there yeah he wasn't trying to get all the people together unity of every church every full gospel church okay starts narrowing down every believer we're trying to get the believers together we ought to be of one heart one mind one accord no matter how much we differ in scriptures or our favorite quotations today he says that might be one might see it this way or that way has nothing to do with it but in principle we ought to stand one great mighty army of god marching on because each one of you in your peculiarity okay i don't have a beard john doesn't have a mustache you know the women wear dresses we're all peculiar you know i'm looking at all the peculiar you're looking at one person so he says um because each one of you in your peculiarity god has proved that is ignoring your doctrine oh man why'd you have to put that in there we made our doctrine perfect he says he can ignore it forget it he says god has proved that he's ignoring your doctrine because he gave you the holy ghost and the bible said he gave them the holy ghost that obeyed him acts 5 32 now if i obey him in my peculiar way and you obey him in your peculiar way he gave us both the holy ghost so we ought to be christian brethren and sister enough to arm up together that doesn't mean a single file that's across this way arm up together and march on for one great purpose the gospel and that's what we said in the early part about the missionary work it doesn't matter your doctrine doesn't matter you've got to be christians but see to us who who have accepted god's plan for the 21st century he's revealed to us the mysteries of the kingdom and that's that's just what it it maps out in the church age book okay there's there's truth reached time but like in the fifth age with martin luther christ alone because they were into candles and beads and all kinds of stuff we've got the same thing today look there's people in south america burning candles to william brandon's picture because they're just catholics with another you know picture so god doesn't hold those people out there accountable for what you know he has trusted you with his secrets the fullness of the revelation see god has a perfect will and he's got a permissive will okay and for every one of us brother ram says we try to work on god's permissive will and he will permit it but also if we take his permissive will though it's not right he will make his permissive will work out to glorify his perfect will he will bring you into line it's going to cost you you made a choice but he'll bring in the lamb so another place he says we must submit ourselves to his will and his and to his word don't question it believe it see we're back to only believe don't try to find a way around it just take it the way it is somebody wants to go around get some other way and when you do you find yourself going on you find yourself you find god blessing you but you're working in his permissive will and not his perfect divine will so i faced questions in a lot of places and thank god that he didn't anoint the pastor to tell me watch us have questions and answers well that'll be your problem but i've been in many places in english or spanish and they have questions one time i was speaking to a group of people it was like a fellowship meeting so at three o'clock it was my turn and it was going to be couples only so i'm supposed to give them some you know wise words since i was married 40 years surely i know something you know so we're talking and here comes questions there right now they want to they want to answer no time to go check it out what's the answer to this so the only one i remember um this sister wrote a little question she said brother george um i've been living with this man for 27 years okay so they're not married strike one and um and lately he's been kind of mean to me in fact he says i've been sleeping in another room for 10 months and we got three sons two are married one's on the way out the door you know and uh okay so she's hurting and she says what shall i do well i gotta have an answer i said you go home pick your stuff up and leave you don't owe nothing there's no paper there's no you're not married i don't know what she did i said he's gonna kill you if you stay there so i don't know what she did but so i don't run from questions okay and so people ask me how can i know god's perfect will okay real simple god's word god's spirit and god's will always run in parallel they never cross god's word is his will his spirit anoints you to read it and understand it so the word the spirit and the will always run in parallel they agree and they run in harmony some people have a portion of the word memorized you know their favorite quotes right to the letter but somewhere the wires are crossed and they display a contrary spirit not good there's no harmony with the rest of the word and that results in fruit that is contrary to the word john 4 23 jesus said now god is looking for people that will worship god in spirit and in truth not all spirit and not all truth we've got extremes but he wants it balanced in spirit and in truth exactly they asked brother brown a question 1961 how do you feel is the best way to find the lord's will in some important matters that's a good question all of our things i mean you got important matters right right yeah facing stuff he says i tell you dear friend the best way to find the will of god in some important matters is prayer well we already knew that that's like naming water what's this i got better water where i live okay prayer now here's the way i do it i take it before the lord and it's always been my strength i wait upon the lord see what he says and i just let myself be neutral oh neutral are you kidding we want our red car we don't want no so neutral is very difficult for us especially america don't take either side so if i was in your place and didn't have these visions okay so he did have a bit of a handicap right and i didn't have these visions from the lord i would just wait upon the lord if i was you now lord you show me what to do show me what the decision to make here and then the way you feel led to do it okay so now you're aiming in a certain direction then just wait a little bit wait yes americans don't wait we want it now i know a guy down north carolina and and he's a big coffee drinker but if he goes by starbucks and there's four cars he goes across the street not gonna wait no so he says if you you pray and you start going a certain direction just i would just wait upon the lord and um and then wait a little bit longer and then wait how many times you got to wait yeah and see which side he's really leading you you know you say now father in my heart you know it doesn't matter i want to know what you want to do about it amen now you can be there's another thing we got to put in here brother brown says you can be too humble and be a tool of the devil you play thing of the devil you got to stand firm but you got to know what you're doing okay so with jonah god did make his permissive will to turn around to accomplish his perfect will it did work out this special fish delivered joan on the shore and the word of the lord came to him once more now we have heard brother brahm tell this story many times and so when i listen and you know he says now check it out with the word well i already read the book of john a few times it didn't quite add up so i thought what are we going to do here we got none of over here we've got tarshish over here and the fish is in the mediterranean now for that story to even be true the fish has got to go out through spain come all the way around africa and come up and go up this river i got a problem here so then i heard him say yeah i read that in the book oh thank you okay so you read that in the book sounds good but it's not true because over here in the bible in verse one and two of chapter three okay he's been in the fish this is already the third day and the word of the lord came into jonah the second time i see up here on in chapter 2 and verse 10 and the lord spake unto the fish yeah that can happen and it vomited out jonah upon the dry land any of you that raised kids you know what it's like when you're on a long trip and they get sick and you know it comes to stuff well that's what jonah looked like he's covered in whale vomit total i mean hair everything now on dry land now he's rolling in the sand not good the only thing he can do is go down to car wash and you know get some new clothes and go so chapter three and verse one and the word of the lord came unto jonah the second time arise go to nineveh great city and preach to it the preaching that i bid thee so if this story about the fish or what brother bran read if that was even true why would it say the golden interview he's there walked out and okay well it didn't happen that way he's vomited out close to where he got on the boat in israel now he's got to get cleaned up and go where he's supposed to go in the first place okay so um the the moral here is that he had a second chance now god could have let the fish just die you know be done with it no get another chance get yourself together go preach against the sin and so forth so you might not have a second chance see some there's decisions in life you make it once it's for life now marriage is like that that's why you got to be sure yeah when you find her be sure yeah it's for life it's not until summertime now a long time ago in um 1955 i might have said this the other night about the ten commandments okay so so anyway they watched the movie in 1955 and brother brown's taking the family home and so rebecca is like nine years old and she's crying what's the matter honey you know what's to her it was like a newsreel you know and so she said well dad you see where the where the on the film there that the moses said now all you saw on the lord's side come here it's over watching those people go well she was watching those people that stood behind and they went down you know that's what she was focusing on and they didn't have a chance he said let this be a lesson to you when god says something you do it now not when everything lines up you know take a vote now and so that's what you know jonah he had a second chance those people didn't have a second chance so after he got cleaned up he went and preached under powerful anointing you read all through chapter three it records the reaction of the people to the preaching of the word of god the greatest revival recorded in history the entire city of 120 000 turned to god stayed back the wrath of god they made a choice repent or perish with the unbeliever but guess what the other part of the story that you probably didn't know about 150 years later they entirely departed from god just like the us of a this was a different country 150 years ago way different if you want a real blessing go study the um the facts about the welsh revival it was only a few months 1904 1905 long or whatever it was just a few months very very different from today so these people 150 years later completely departed from god they forgot about the mercy the forgiveness and god permitted the babylonians to come down in the year 621 bc and utterly destroy the city now they didn't have dynamite they didn't have missiles you know bulldozers no so devastating was the destruction that the ruins were only discovered about a hundred years ago 2500 years later oh here's where nineveh was obliterated we don't know what they did and so um such a hatred to destroy even even schofield he says a lot of good things he says such is the way of god light rejected brings destruction amen now brother abraham said this over 1956 he said now this year i believe you know they're going to make a decision so forth life goes on he has a powerful ministry you know all things happen now here we are all these years later and we're seeing the fulfillment he warned back there you've lived long enough i've lived long enough to see that hey it's true he always warns first and we're seeing the prophecy fulfilled now everywhere you look you cannot look in your phone without seeing hatred malice perversion it's everywhere you know so jonah was in fact a crucial part of a very large picture now i know some of you got spare time and you like to work puzzles right i don't have that kind of time my daughter oh she loves puzzles she gets the most she'll get a you know a whole ocean in one boat you know i put that together kind of stuff i don't have the kind of time but um he was part of a much bigger picture so when you're putting together a puzzle especially one with you know houses and trees and whatever well there's colors that you don't like there's part of it okay it's part of the picture find it put it in there so he was part of a much bigger picture so much so that it was repeated by our lord once in matthew chapter 12. so when you don't fully understand why brother john chose a certain color for the walls over there just leave it alone when you don't understand an issue or something that's going on be careful it could be part of a bigger picture it's there for a reason you know and god allows these scenes to play out in order to bring our reactions to the surface be careful amen god has not called me or any of you to straighten everything out years ago when i was working over in jeffersonville with billy paul you're 75 way back there someplace uh so i forget what was going on but i said you know what really if i was god i just wipe off the whole thing and start over well it's a good thing i wasn't you know but god didn't call me to straighten it all out and and straighten out the things that i think are not in order it would seem that god's man god's prophet of the age god's anointed messenger it seemed like he was backslidden and stepped out of the will of god it seemed that way it seemed that way because we as mortals with our little bitty chicken brains we're very small creatures that we are we don't have all the facts we don't know why you know we make knee-jerk reactions with partial information amen now when you go through the airport here's people walking through the airport a little thing in there and they're just talking along there's nobody around you know but they're talking so if i listen long enough i can make a a judgment on what's going on because i've only heard half the conversation you know and that's the way we are we only know part of what's going on we make these judgments and very few people of any given age of any given generation recognize the real value of the message of god during their day okay hindsight oh you can see it all hindsight yeah simeon you know lived near the temple in fact he lived right next door in uh in the scripture and he was old and he thought he was going to die but god said to him now son you're not going to die until you've seen the salvation until you've seen this sign that i'm going to give you so every time there was baby dedication he'd go out there and he'd look no no sign today go back to bed we don't know how long it went on but one day he's out there he saw the sign that god told him to look for so he goes right up to mary so only simeon and joseph and mary knew what was going on rest of them no big deal and so he let me have the baby okay mine eyes have seen thy salvation i can depart in peace you know and um but uh he was only a few that recognized god in present tense now 1957 questions and answers this city of jeffersonville or we could put fenton or whatever city at the day of the judgment we'll answer a great price someday for there have been hundreds and hundreds of outstanding healings done right here that's right right here signs and wonders and the appearing of the angel down here at the river and the papers blasting it and still people don't believe why is it he says this is 1957. you got to get the picture here's a small tabernacle a pulpit looks like he's made out of orange crates you know and um sound system not working real good and across the river from jeffersonville was the capital of tobacco whiskey all that was going on over there big baptist seminary big presbyterian seminary big catholic seminary just across the river so here we are he says why is that someday i'm going to leave here uh i'm 48 years old this was in uh october of 57. why didn't the world recognize that picture why don't they catch those things right quick why don't they catch these other things why don't they catch these prophecies you know they can't do it but one day i'm going to leave this world and when i leave they will recognize it now those of you that know a little bit of math are coming up on 56 years you've been gone some of you young people will realize that after i'm gone this day this scripture has been fulfilled the harvest time 1964. but what did the lutherans do after the death of martin luther they met satan and made a denomination and died never did anything else just a bunch of people right down the street two tapes that you need to listen to carefully uh are the two tapes from april of 1963. this is the first time after the seals he's in a different atmosphere not the pressure of the people's christian businessmen deal he's in albuquerque new mexico april 63. world falling apart and god in simplicity i believe in the world falling apart he says you might not believe that but this is taped listen to it a few years from today if there is such and then you will know whether it's true or not whatever he was talking about just before this one day when the evening lights are breaking and it's too late then you'll say that man could have been right but it's too late then just exactly like jesus said when he was here on earth quote god sent you prophets down through the ages every time the world system religious system had fallen apart and what did you do with each one god sent the prophet you all killed them put them in the grave exactly and then in about another generation you wake up and realize that was a prophet and then what you do you garnish the tomb you know make it look nice what do you do you make a tradition of his life and that is exactly what israel had done moses they made a tradition of his life yesterday they were all in their synagogues around the world and they had a portion of moses that they read prophet said prophet said okay still going on he says moses made a tradition of his life that's the way we do with martin luther john wesley and other men huh wonder who that could be we're always looking back making a tradition of their life garnishing their tomb and their message was for another day by the time you wake up that day's done live by you're in another day the whole system has worked that way since the beginning man-made systems certainly so we got to face the music will brother brahms be like being exception to this rule i don't think so we've got people burning candles we've got people doing all kinds of things but there's a few of us that are looking at the word and we see that all this that he said is simply the manifestation of the word of god so simple you know so people just now are realizing the value of the message we've had the warning and when you don't understand something you don't have all the facts be careful psalm 46 10 be still and know that i am god so jonah was god's prophet but as human he looked for the easy way the way of no pressure everybody to agree with him yeah that's nice pat him on the back many times will god god will indicate his will to us in different ways then we go discussion with the relatives and what do you think what do you think i should do you know looking for a consensus looking for a vote people to agree with us we're looking for the easy way like jonah did brother brown says you have to struggle to do the will of god sometimes it's not always easy but it will produce the best results it's only 20 minutes 12 relax we've got time so today we have many message believers i call them book carriers a lot of people are simply carrying the books and they're willfully that is by their own self-will climbing onto boats headed for somewhere different they look like they're going in the same place it looks yeah they got the same kind of dress they look good yeah and um uh the boats are going a different way you see uh different fl from what god has ordained in his word now god told jonah to go northeast and he fled from the presence of god and went southwest exactly opposite today they're the boats that are available they're not going 180 degrees they're only one two degrees off you don't even notice it until it's too late you can't swim back you know uh go listen to anointing once at the end time you'll see that only too late are we finding out oh this is going to a different port this is yeah they're over there we're over here we've got a problem and then we begin to check out well this isn't even the old ship of messiah and it just kind of looks like it you know so we can have a we can have a leading we can have a doctrine we can have a promise right out of the pages of the bible okay but if it's not in the proper season flowing in the will of god in the economy and the plan of god for the hour you will be fleeing from the presence of the living god just one degree off thinking and believing that you're right i know a bunch of those people you'll be choosing your will and not god's will right not having rightly divided the word of truth not paying attention to the ministry that god puts in place you know and there will be a price to play so it's very dark in laodicea brother braham says over here in revelations chapter four now he says they're so um they say well we don't we don't believe in saying hell in the pulpit we need men of god who won't hold back now everybody can't be a preacher but you've got a voice if you if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher just live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of god that will bring reproach to them that reject it just live your sermon that's why even your sisters we don't believe in having you up here it's just scripture you know that's why brother brown left the baptist church because they wanted to put them in one of the things so as you go to the store you got your hair you got your dress you're preaching and those that you know okay they've sealed their doom right there he says the preacher is called to preach his and live it also if you can't live it then stop preaching it oh i'd like to bring that down on a few friends of mine but you're supposed to live your sermons oh how we need in jeffersonville thousands of lived voices in other words people that actually it blooms out you know he says the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's the thunder against the enemy the devil doesn't care how loud you can holler how much you can jump or whatever but what hurts the devil to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything you want to him call him anything he's just as sweet as he can be moves right on that throws him that's the thunder that shakes the devil now a long time ago like 900 years there was a man a preacher in italy called francis of assis the people that were in the catholic church probably remember well and so even in switzerland they had him on the on the money you know so brother brown said he was a gospel preacher and he said preach always use words when necessary brother brandon said the same thing live your sermon you see so they you know we all got these cell phones we know everything just zip it just live your sermon and when they ask a question that's because it has struck a chord and then you can open your bible because you've been in this church for years and you can show them the five comings of elijah oh i hadn't seen that what's there part of god's program you know and then they ask another question and you just let it out you've been bottling up for years just let it out we got a couple of tracks back there very good so if we turn our back on the word maybe not openly you know like jonah but only by indifference maybe by a bad attitude you know like john the baptist dad you know when he was there at the church just a little bit of fear okay nine months so if we just if we turn our back on the word we're fleeing from the presence of god just slightly we'll be following an antichrist spirit and an antichrist doctrine be careful and soon you will be anointed with arrogance selfishness self-righteous respective persons none of which comes from god so if we deviate one degree off a true center we can't hit the target i was with my son in africa and he knew that those guys had guns so he didn't take a gun but they had a big hunt organized so here we are in the back of the toyota you know bouncing along through the wilderness and they see an animal okay he doesn't know nothing about this gun but we've got to try it out so he shoots well he knew that he was high animals gone so what's he do well he's a hunter so he takes piece clean x puts it on a bush out there at 50 yards comes back over here dials the scope down to what he thought it should be shoots it goes over there or they all run with him you know they've never seen anything like that so wonder they kill anything and so he um he sees okay we almost got it so he comes back he dials it again you know and now they're out and he shoots they're all going to run again so aren't you coming no i know what he knows what he's doing it hit this time i'm sure well he was the hero wow you can actually make this gun hit where you want it to hit oh man but if it but if it's not zeroed in who knows where it's going to hit you know we don't have to be 180 degrees off just one degree you see and we assume that we're right we assume that he's with us you know like mary and joseph they've been down to the to the temple in jerusalem for the bar mitzvah and because jesus was raised jewish you know just facts and um and so they're all on the way home nazareth is a long ways away so they come to the first evening and they're gonna set up camp and get things ready big family and so mary says uh uh joseph where's the boy well i don't know and it's your turn to watch him well he wasn't there they assumed he was with them but he wasn't there so they didn't sleep too good that night and they went back and they found him but see they assumed he was with him they had left him behind they ventured off into make-believe leaving behind the promise of god for the hour and many are doing the same thing today thinking god is with them because they calculated a certain way we've got to be careful now when you read that story in the new testament about mary and joseph and you know leaving jesus behind look at her sorry attitude when they when they found him she didn't hold honey we're so glad well we missed you so much no she said baby why'd you do this to me you made me look bad yeah yeah that's what it says so we're almost done here um 1964 looking unto jesus it's possible today that good men fine men walking with christ reading his word still don't recognize that this is the hour that certain things of this bible must be fulfilled yes sir they're all in these big churches right now it's the hour that we're living in the time is at hand when these things must be done it's written and this must it must be fulfilled because god promised it yes our eyes must be opened to see it now you can look at the word the pharisees had that word drawn out they had their things on the wall yeah this way and messiah and they had it all figured out exactly how he was coming they believed they were right nobody wants to be wrong even if people get caught by the police out here they they well maybe he'll let me buy i think they're kind of right no they're wrong see they believed they were right and here he was born and walked amongst them and they condemned him when he told him you all need to search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life right amen and they testify of us search the scriptures we are moses precise disciples they could trace their lineage all the way back no and um if you would be moses disciples you would know me because he wrote of me the lord your god shall raise up a prophet like in me a lawgiver and so forth and the people will hear see if they would have known moses writings they would have known him they thought they knew moses writings but they didn't know it and they were blinded to that so just a few words from him like that what they do well who's this guy think he is he's got a devil comes to teach us what school did he come from you know all that but they failed to look and see that the very god that promised the word was vindicating it right there through the person of jesus christ he was the light of the hour he was the light for the people to walk in the only word of god and only the word of god produces light only god's word produces light it's not anywhere else not james dobson or nothing it's the word so god's word produces the sunshine god's word produces the earth god's word produces the air everything is the word of god made manifest everything that's got a reality to it amen when he was here he said i am god and besides me there is no other so when you look at this earth that we you know we take care of and we farm it and we cut it we were so in love with our environment but if you stand out here in space and you're looking at it what's holding it up this ball is is over here you know it's all working perfectly they can tell you exactly when the eclipse will start you know in 2030 all this is perfect man can't do that our finest watch it goes bad so it's all god's word so look around be you know sensitive discern your surroundings be thankful for what you have you know check it up because our life our doctrine and our experience has to match god's word not your imagination not explanations because we cannot afford to live uh any longer in a glare we got to have god in reality live for today yes prepare for tomorrow from terry's because we're on a journey we're going someplace okay now this has two purposes and i hate to tell you one purpose to stay level the other one is to stay awake so um we're going somewhere there's a gate to the resurrection that's where we're headed you know we will get there so um we have certain spirits amongst our malachi 4 ranks we got religious tourists okay accumulating souvenirs and arguing about the details of the text you know and burning religious candles but they have no relationship with jesus christ author and finisher of our faith and we all have a choice you can go the way of the crowd or you can stick with the word you know so what do we have here a couple more quotes here pay attention uh 1957 stand at the door and knock well that's the way it is today with people who call themselves christians you say oh i belong to church that's good but you see the reason there's so much trouble ah here we go the reason there's so much trouble in the church the reason there's so much confusion in the church so much discontentment in the church doesn't sound good does it is not because jesus is not there it is because that jesus can't gain access to the places he wants to go we have those little bitty compartments oh no don't touch that no you can come in jesus that's far enough i'll go to church otherwise i'll run my own business jesus wants to be supreme ruler of your being and the only way he can bless you is when he becomes your lord lord is rulership ownership you know he wants access to your entire life open your heart another place he says and when jesus comes in he wants to be welcomed right but we have those little secret doors little bitty doors in our heart that we don't want jesus in over to the right hand of the human heart after he gets in there's a little bitty door called pride oh i'll receive him as savior but don't tell me how i have to dress and the way i have to do if i have to let my hair grow if i have to stop smoking cigarettes or quit going to the pool hall etc etc i don't want nothing to do with it he says don't worry he won't stay too long very dangerous so you have a choice so if jesus isn't lord of all your life see he is calling you he's giving you another opportunity sunday september 12th see so all you gotta do is yield to yes yes lord i'll drop all my stuff i'll follow i'll get in the word whatever you show me you see we can pray with you he can change your will your desires and put you on the right road to fulfill his will the word says in first corinthians 2 9 but it is written i have not seen ear has not heard neither has entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him but god has revealed them unto us by his spirit he's given us a prophet he's given us life to live and and you're healthy i mean how many people you know are sick laying in bed we can we can get out to the house of the lord so thank you for your attention and if you have any questions we'll be standing around for a while but there's a lot of the missionary stuff that we can't even you know remember all of a sudden but uh if it's stuff that you uh don't understand we're here to help you god bless you for the job [Applause] very rich i really really appreciate everything that you had to say um and he said it just like it is he's not her brothers didn't play favorites and i should say the lord through him he's not a respecter of persons and he wants to see us through the lord wants us to mature to become a church that's without spot without wrinkle that has been laying in the presence of the son not worrying about who's the best who's who's this that or the other just am i representing the manifestation of christ amen and um if you want to make a commitment to the lord today i rather gave today's date said this is the day i say whatever the lord has spoken to you make a commitment say yes to him this word that came forward today wasn't just information this is our lord speaking to us about our relationship so if you'd like prayer our brother be happy to pray with you just be happy and uh let's stand together and let's sing he is lord he is lord just obey the lord just between you and him this is just a church where we all feel the same way which is i want more of the lord amen he is lord he is lord he has risen from the dead and he is low every knee shall [Music] that jesus christ is amen one more time he is lord he is lord he is lord he has risen from the deadly floor [Music] every knee shall bow every time god says that jesus christ is lord he's my lord he's my lord he has risen from [Music] every [Music] amen don't you want to be pleasing to the lord [Music] that i do be pleasing to you praise let everything i pursue be pleasing o lord [Music] let me be pleasing to you let everything that i do be pleasing to you praise [Music] amen let's just sing it one more time let it be your prayer please let me be pleasing to you let everything that i do be pleasing to you pray let everything i pursued [Music] amen let go and let god is [Music] is [Music] your night turn today is [Music] to jesus i surrender all to him i freely give i will ever love and trust him
