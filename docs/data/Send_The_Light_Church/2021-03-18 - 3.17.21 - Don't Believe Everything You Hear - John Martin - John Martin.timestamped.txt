[35:22] amen amen
[35:25] well um i was continuing
[35:30] on our series um
[35:33] with walking with our walk with the lord
[35:39] um and had been studying and
[35:42] tuesday morning about 3 30 quarter to
[35:46] four
[35:48] i was waking up and i never want to get
[35:49] waking that early
[35:52] because i i get up early anyways uh
[35:55] about 4 30 or 5.
[35:58] and uh of course with the time change
[36:01] then getting up
[36:02] at you know quarter to 3 30 quarter to
[36:04] four
[36:05] um it's really what 2 30
[36:09] quarter to three so i laid there and i
[36:11] tossed and i turned and
[36:14] finally i said okay that's not working
[36:16] i'm just gonna read
[36:18] so i read i started to read and things
[36:20] began to
[36:21] open up and i thought certainly this is
[36:24] not the direction the lord wants me to
[36:26] go so then i got down on my knees and i
[36:28] began to pray
[36:30] and then it
[36:34] it just began to open up and i says okay
[36:36] lord your will
[36:38] so
[36:42] um it's kind of been a quick study
[36:44] because it's only been since tuesday
[36:49] so i came home from work early and i'm
[36:51] studying some more and as i'm laying
[36:53] there studying
[36:56] they kept coming to me asked brother
[36:58] mark
[36:59] to lead the men's meeting
[37:03] they came to me a few times
[37:06] and i didn't yield to it
[37:10] and then we came downstairs and brother
[37:12] mark rosario came over today to do
[37:14] some work and he was there just for a
[37:17] minute and trans
[37:19] communicating with the family and then
[37:23] then he left and so i get in the car and
[37:25] i'm driving down the road and
[37:27] and it came to me again call brother
[37:29] mark and ask him to lead the men's again
[37:31] it wasn't uh for any reason it was just
[37:34] there so
[37:37] i just said okay and i called brother
[37:38] mark and i said brother mark how do you
[37:40] feel about leading the men's meeting
[37:42] he says it'd be be honored to be happy
[37:45] to do that i'll do that
[37:47] and so he's leading the
[37:50] the he starts the men's meeting and he
[37:53] he says okay
[37:54] for opening scripture i want to turn to
[37:57] first john
[37:58] chapter 4 verses 1 through 4.
[38:05] well i had already handed a piece of
[38:07] paper to ann before this time
[38:10] with our opening scripture first john
[38:12] chapter four verses one through four
[38:15] so i'm just gonna say the lord is in
[38:17] this through and through
[38:19] and i don't have nothing to do with it
[38:22] but the lord does
[38:24] the lord does so i'll turn with me if
[38:26] you would to first john chapter 4
[38:31] and i just i i didn't want to say
[38:33] anything brothers during it i just sat
[38:35] there in
[38:35] awe just wondering what the lord
[38:39] would do
[38:42] starting with verse one beloved believe
[38:46] not every spirit but try the spirits
[38:50] whether they are of god because many
[38:52] false prophets are gone out into the
[38:54] world
[38:56] hereby know ye the spirit of god every
[38:59] spirit
[39:00] that confesseth that jesus christ has
[39:02] come
[39:03] in the flesh is of god and every spirit
[39:07] that confesseth not that jesus christ
[39:09] has come
[39:10] in the flesh is not of god and this is
[39:12] the spirit of antichrist
[39:14] where you have heard that it should come
[39:16] and even now already
[39:17] is it in the world and now already is in
[39:21] the world ye are of god little children
[39:24] and have overcome them
[39:25] because greater is he that is in you
[39:27] than he that is in the world
[39:29] amen god bless you you may be seated
[39:33] well happy st patrick's day to those
[39:37] that
[39:38] celebrate st patrick's day i know our
[39:40] sister kathleen does
[39:42] and usually when it
[39:45] comes to saint patrick's day i think of
[39:46] her and i think i got to wear green
[39:49] and
[39:53] so i wish her sister could be with us i
[39:56] know that she would desire to be
[40:00] uh ann told me earlier today she had
[40:02] read
[40:04] uh or heard that if you're going to
[40:06] believe anything
[40:08] if you're going to believe everything
[40:10] that you read then you should just read
[40:11] the bible
[40:13] i thought well that makes sense because
[40:15] on google you have that tendency of just
[40:17] believing every fact that you look up
[40:21] and if you're going to believe
[40:22] everything that you hear then we should
[40:24] just start listening to the prophet more
[40:26] amen i like to entitle this don't
[40:29] believe
[40:30] everything you hear don't believe
[40:33] everything you hear and for a subject
[40:35] test
[40:36] your thoughts because your opinion could
[40:38] be wrong that's right
[40:40] amen and so as we read our opening
[40:43] scripture here believe not
[40:45] every spirit but try the spirits
[40:48] whether they are of god now i want to
[40:50] say this it would be nice
[40:52] if every one of us have things going on
[40:56] in our life and we really want
[40:57] god to move in them and we don't all
[41:01] have the same thing going on because
[41:02] we're not all
[41:03] but they are things and we want god
[41:07] to tailor as it were a word for us on
[41:11] those things
[41:13] we always do but i'll say this and i
[41:16] believe this with all my heart
[41:18] god has never left leading and guiding
[41:21] us
[41:21] with the message from this pulpit
[41:26] on my heart i believe that god has
[41:30] always sent a word to direct us
[41:36] because if he didn't that he would be a
[41:38] liar
[41:39] and god does not lie the thing is
[41:43] it doesn't usually come the way that we
[41:45] would like it to come
[41:47] but i do believe that god is in his word
[41:49] i do believe
[41:50] he's in the ministry way beyond us way
[41:53] beyond our understanding
[41:54] way beyond he's the one building the
[41:56] church
[41:58] and he loves you more than any human
[42:00] being can love you
[42:02] and he is directing us through the word
[42:06] and i believe that's where we can find
[42:08] him for the directions for our life
[42:11] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[42:13] the spirit
[42:15] try the spirits whether they are of god
[42:18] because many false prophets are gone
[42:20] into the world that word try means test
[42:23] or examine
[42:24] amen and a lot of times
[42:29] thoughts just come into our head and we
[42:31] never take time to test them
[42:33] we're so used to just oh this is right
[42:38] and come to find out a lot of times
[42:40] they're not right
[42:41] amen and i mean we backslide 100 times a
[42:44] day
[42:45] how does that happen the devil tricks us
[42:51] the spirit
[42:56] the way that we test or examine the
[42:58] thoughts that come into our
[42:59] our mind is give it the brother taught
[43:01] us the word test
[43:03] it's got to agree with the word not just
[43:06] part of it
[43:07] but from cover to cover because usually
[43:09] we can find
[43:10] something to agree with it but it's not
[43:13] going to match everything
[43:15] just like you think on these things if
[43:17] it's
[43:18] true well the devil always wants to tell
[43:21] us a little truth
[43:24] but then he throws in the other stuff
[43:26] and it's not a it's not a good report
[43:28] all of a sudden we're thinking things
[43:29] that are not a good report
[43:30] right and that that's how it happens and
[43:33] we need to
[43:34] to give it the word test
[43:37] and the bible says that every spirit
[43:39] that confesseth that jesus christ has
[43:41] come in the flesh
[43:42] is of god and of course we know that
[43:45] the corporate body jesus has been here
[43:48] in the flesh
[43:49] we cannot deny that but even
[43:53] the devils believe that
[43:56] at that time they said are you you come
[43:58] to torment us at this time we know
[44:00] that thou art the son of god so
[44:03] this really is referring to
[44:07] um every spirit that won't manifest
[44:11] christ
[44:11] in your flesh is an antichrist spirit
[44:14] amen that's why we have to try the
[44:17] spirit
[44:18] that word confess means to give in
[44:22] to or to yield to
[44:26] to give into or to yield to it means to
[44:29] you've entered a covenant a compliance
[44:32] or an agreement with so every spirit
[44:37] that comes to you that hasn't given into
[44:40] christ
[44:40] yielded to christ entered into covenant
[44:42] with christ it isn't compliant to the
[44:44] word is it
[44:45] in agreement with the word is antichrist
[44:50] amen now the bible says the devils
[44:52] believe
[44:54] and tremble why do they tremble
[44:58] they tremble because they have not
[45:01] entered into that covenant
[45:03] they haven't submitted to they don't
[45:05] agree with they're not compliance with
[45:07] christ
[45:09] and that's why they're scared
[45:12] they don't want to manifest christ
[45:14] they're not loved with christ
[45:16] and perfect love would cast out the fear
[45:18] that they're having but they tremble
[45:21] they don't want to be subject to christ
[45:23] they don't want to suffer for christ
[45:24] they don't want to love like christ they
[45:26] don't want to submit to christ
[45:28] but they believe
[45:31] the only thing they want to say is i
[45:33] believe
[45:34] they don't want to give in they don't
[45:36] want to yield to the word
[45:38] demonic spirits don't want to be subject
[45:41] to christ
[45:41] nor to the law of christ or the word of
[45:44] god
[45:46] for an example we know that christ came
[45:49] not to do away with the law but to
[45:51] fulfill the law
[45:53] in galatians chapter 5 verse 14 says for
[45:56] all the law is fulfilled in one word
[45:57] even this that thou shalt love thy
[45:59] neighbor
[46:00] as thyself
[46:03] so demonic spirits don't want to love
[46:06] they don't want to serve they just want
[46:08] to say they believe
[46:10] all right so the verse right before
[46:13] verse 13 says for brethren you have been
[46:15] called unto liberty
[46:17] only use not your liberty for an
[46:19] occasion to the flesh
[46:21] but by love serve one another and a lot
[46:23] of times our flesh wants to take
[46:25] liberty for itself
[46:29] and those are demonic spirits amen
[46:36] false prophets that word
[46:40] false prophets religious uh imposter
[46:44] that's what that is demonic spirits
[46:47] speak to us all the time
[46:50] in various ways most assuredly
[46:54] we'll hear from the devil when we get
[46:56] down to pray
[47:01] the brother man said the weak as
[47:03] christian when he gets down on his knees
[47:05] makes the demons tremble that's right
[47:08] amen
[47:12] they know they're in trouble if god gets
[47:16] calmed down on the scene
[47:17] amen in that prayer time
[47:23] oh here comes the name of jesus right
[47:26] now what's going to happen to us jesus
[47:28] is going to come on the scene
[47:29] and they tremble so what do they do
[47:31] everything they can
[47:33] to stop you from getting in contact with
[47:35] god
[47:36] amen by faith
[47:40] and when you set off to pray it seems
[47:42] like every other thought
[47:44] wants to be preeminent in your mind at
[47:46] that time
[47:48] your mind becomes bombarded with the
[47:50] chores of the day with a load of laundry
[47:52] a honeydew list
[47:54] got an appointment got to go to the
[47:56] store or problems that you have to deal
[47:58] with
[48:00] things that you want to get done
[48:02] distractions of all sorts
[48:04] when you get down to pray
[48:11] why
[48:14] because the devil doesn't want you
[48:16] getting in contact with god
[48:19] because god is the only thing that can
[48:21] destroy
[48:22] the devil
[48:25] the bible says that christ
[48:28] was manifested in the flesh god was
[48:31] manifested first that he might destroy
[48:33] the works of the devil
[48:35] amen and when christ becomes manifested
[48:37] in our flesh it will just
[48:39] break all the bands of satan all the
[48:41] chains of satan
[48:42] amen we need christ in this flesh
[48:51] can you imagine
[48:57] we're going to just do just a little
[48:58] second role play if we could i'm going
[49:00] to make
[49:01] brother mark god so he's sitting on his
[49:04] throne
[49:05] and i'm going to come and i'm going to
[49:06] approach the lord
[49:09] in prayer and
[49:12] god's been just waiting all day to hear
[49:16] from me
[49:17] because i've just been so busy kept
[49:20] putting it off
[49:21] maybe the night before i didn't pray and
[49:23] finally mornings come and i'm going to
[49:25] pray
[49:27] but god is ready he's excited to hear
[49:29] from me
[49:30] that's right and he's his arms are open
[49:34] he's ready to receive me finally i got
[49:35] time for god
[49:37] and god's happy about it and i get down
[49:40] on my knees
[49:41] and i begin to thank him to praise him
[49:46] and start off maybe praying
[49:50] for somebody and after about a sentence
[49:54] my mind begins to wander
[49:59] but i began literally having a
[50:01] conversation
[50:04] with that thought that's in my mind and
[50:06] i guarantee that thought didn't come
[50:09] from god
[50:12] so who am i having a conversation with
[50:15] you understand what's happening amen
[50:18] we've got to try the spirit and how many
[50:20] times
[50:21] i'm supposed to be praying for the
[50:23] sister i'm supposed to be praying about
[50:24] this situation
[50:26] this person's got cancer it's real
[50:27] important and my mind's going over here
[50:34] and we blow it off this is not a big
[50:38] thing
[50:42] the devil speaks to us so often
[50:47] and god is just sitting there and i
[50:49] thought you come to
[50:50] pray to worship to just ask me in my use
[50:53] my name
[50:55] and it's like you start having a
[50:57] conversation with another person and
[50:59] god's just sitting there
[51:00] i thought you're talking to me come on
[51:03] now
[51:04] think about how god feels we think
[51:06] everything god understands god
[51:07] understands yeah god understands but
[51:09] what god wants and he deserves amen
[51:13] he wants us to try the spirit
[51:18] to see whether it's of god
[51:21] because if we start calling it out
[51:24] we can enter into the spirit of prayer
[51:27] and worship
[51:28] enter into everything else you've heard
[51:30] the song shut in with god
[51:31] in a secret place
[51:38] every one of these things that are
[51:41] coming to our mind
[51:44] they're just weapons that the devil uses
[51:46] towards us
[51:49] to keep us from entering into the spirit
[51:51] and using the name of jesus the way we
[51:53] should
[51:55] they're demonic spirits at a time that
[51:58] seems
[52:00] that we're going through it harmless or
[52:01] they're just thoughts but what the
[52:04] devil's doing is trying to institute
[52:07] a confusion in our mind amen
[52:12] he's the author of confusion all these
[52:14] spirits are just trying to cause
[52:16] confusion
[52:16] they don't care if you're thinking about
[52:18] work don't think about what your plans
[52:20] are
[52:21] thinking about what you want to do for
[52:22] the day you don't care
[52:26] he wants the devil wants to get us in
[52:28] some carnal trap to
[52:30] while i just spent my time praying
[52:31] that's good and i'll go on my day
[52:36] spirits that are sent to disrupt your
[52:38] prayer and bring disorder
[52:41] to your mind to to to your life
[52:45] sometimes these weapons can seem like
[52:48] strongholds you ever like
[52:49] want to pray about something and this
[52:50] thing that's bothering you keeps coming
[52:52] to you
[52:54] and just no matter how much you try to
[52:57] get away from it and pray it just
[52:58] all suddenly just keeps coming back to
[53:00] you those are strongholds
[53:06] can't get them off your mind the devil
[53:09] just keeps reminding you of that
[53:11] negative situation
[53:14] and he's trying to build a real case to
[53:18] get you
[53:18] to start imagining things
[53:22] and we've got to take control of our
[53:24] minds take authority that god
[53:26] has given us to because your mind
[53:30] is free more agency you can do what you
[53:32] want to do with it
[53:33] but it is like a muscle if you're used
[53:35] to thinking negative things all the time
[53:37] it's hard to be positive when you want
[53:39] to be
[53:43] we got to cast down imaginations and
[53:46] every high thing that exalteth itself
[53:49] against the knowledge of god and bring
[53:52] it into captivity
[53:53] every thought to the obedience of christ
[53:55] now that's what has to happen
[53:56] when you're in prayer amen
[54:00] because these thoughts are trying to
[54:03] exalt
[54:05] themselves above god
[54:09] above the time that you're spending with
[54:11] god and worship him
[54:12] and giving him the praise that he's he's
[54:14] worthy of
[54:17] you know i have to get something in
[54:19] about st patrick every st
[54:20] patrick's day right this is a prayer of
[54:23] saint patrick
[54:25] this is where we want to get to i think
[54:27] in
[54:29] how we want to pray is just entering in
[54:30] where everything is just out
[54:33] he says i take for my sureties the power
[54:35] of god to guide me
[54:37] the might of god to uphold me the wisdom
[54:39] of god to teach me
[54:41] the eye of god to watch over me the ear
[54:43] of god to hear me
[54:45] the word of god to give me speech the
[54:47] hand of god to protect me
[54:49] the way of god to go before me and the
[54:51] shield of god to shelter me
[54:53] amen christ be with me christ before me
[54:56] christ behind me christ within me
[54:59] christ beneath me christ above me christ
[55:02] at my right
[55:03] and christ at my left christ in my heart
[55:06] of every man who thinks of me
[55:08] christ in my mouth of every man who
[55:10] speaks to me christ in my eye that's
[55:13] christ in every eye that sees me and
[55:15] christ
[55:16] in every ear that hears me
[55:23] i think that's when we get into prayer
[55:26] we should get it get
[55:27] go with all of our heart don't let the
[55:29] devil use his
[55:31] little tricks try that spirit call it
[55:34] out
[55:35] i'm not going to do it just enter into
[55:36] prayer
[55:38] god will honor that
[55:42] now through the course of the day these
[55:44] spirits continue to worm their way
[55:47] into our mind try to take
[55:52] over the control panel
[55:55] maneuver the levers and most of the time
[55:58] we don't even recognize
[56:00] it's happening until
[56:03] you know something bad happens shall we
[56:05] say
[56:06] because they're just thoughts right
[56:07] they're just thought they're harmless
[56:11] but if we could take heed to these
[56:13] scriptures
[56:15] and believe not everything that we hear
[56:18] but try the spirit we would see what's
[56:20] of god and what is not
[56:22] amen no we don't have a lot of examples
[56:26] of demonic spirits talking
[56:28] to people like we have a lot of
[56:30] scriptures
[56:31] that talk about god talking to a lot of
[56:33] people
[56:34] but we don't have a lot of scriptures
[56:36] that talk about demons talking
[56:38] about talking to people but what we do
[56:40] have
[56:41] is a lot of scriptures
[56:44] that show that demons have been talking
[56:46] to people
[56:47] [Laughter]
[56:50] the result of it
[56:56] remember the time that the disciples
[56:58] wanted to call down judgment
[57:00] upon some people and jesus said you
[57:04] don't know what spirit you're of
[57:06] right amen see they were a demonic
[57:09] spirit that got on them
[57:11] that made them think like that
[57:15] and they didn't even recognize it
[57:17] because they were so
[57:20] uh south religious
[57:24] ignition they were just gonna take
[57:27] charge
[57:29] because this is the word
[57:32] but they didn't have the spirit of the
[57:34] word
[57:36] it was out of context it was out of
[57:38] place
[57:40] their thought process was antichrist and
[57:42] they didn't even know it
[57:45] it was the spirit of air
[57:48] let's look at matthew chapter 16 verse
[57:52] 21.
[57:55] matthew 16 verse 21 from that
[57:59] time forth began jesus to show unto his
[58:03] disciples
[58:04] how that he must go unto jerusalem and
[58:07] suffer many things
[58:08] of the elders and the chief priests and
[58:10] scribes and be killed
[58:12] and be raised again the third day
[58:16] so he's shown them many
[58:19] things that's gonna have to suffer that
[58:22] was his whole
[58:23] purpose of communicating here
[58:27] and this was the manifestation of christ
[58:30] in the flesh
[58:31] that's what this was amen
[58:35] and and peter honestly he was believing
[58:38] just the opposite
[58:40] believers don't do this believers don't
[58:42] suffer like this believers don't have to
[58:44] go through this
[58:45] and peter's thought process was
[58:47] antichrist
[58:49] and he didn't even know it now this is
[58:52] the key because
[58:52] he didn't try the spirit and then
[58:56] brother bruce
[58:57] come and he preached about those two
[58:58] that walked to emmaus
[59:00] and jesus called him out and he says oh
[59:02] you you fools
[59:03] and slow to heart to believe all that
[59:05] the prophets have said
[59:06] you've got to try the spirit amen
[59:09] verse 22 then peter took him and began
[59:12] to rebuke him
[59:14] saying be it far from thee lord this
[59:16] shall
[59:17] not be unto thee i'll just say
[59:21] believe not every spirit believe not
[59:23] everything you hear
[59:25] because peter heard that and he believed
[59:29] it
[59:31] so he's spoken he's gonna straighten out
[59:34] he's gonna straighten out the ministry
[59:38] he's gonna he's gonna you know we're not
[59:40] gonna have a ministry in this church
[59:41] that talks about suffering
[59:46] but he turned and he said unto peter get
[59:50] thee behind me satan thou art
[59:53] in offense to me unto me for thou savers
[59:56] not the things that be of god but the
[59:57] things that be of men
[1:00:00] there it is try the spirit and see if
[1:00:03] it's of god
[1:00:05] or if it's of men if it's men it's going
[1:00:08] to be what's pleasing to you
[1:00:09] right it's true if it's going to
[1:00:12] and that's what satan wants to do he
[1:00:14] wants to savor you
[1:00:17] like he did eve this is this is good for
[1:00:20] you
[1:00:22] peter believed that jesus was the christ
[1:00:26] the son of the living god
[1:00:27] but the spirit that was on him would not
[1:00:29] enter into a covenant
[1:00:31] of total surrender to christ
[1:00:34] because when you enter that covenant you
[1:00:36] submit
[1:00:38] you're willing to do whatever jesus
[1:00:39] asked you to do
[1:00:45] and that's why
[1:00:48] jesus had to slice that thing call it
[1:00:51] out right there
[1:00:52] you're not willing to suffer that that's
[1:00:53] wrong that's of the devil
[1:00:59] every spirit that confesseth not that
[1:01:01] jesus has come in the flesh is not of
[1:01:03] god
[1:01:05] i am not going to suffer christ
[1:01:08] is not in that flesh
[1:01:12] it's not and this is what i want to say
[1:01:15] i've never believed in the ministry
[1:01:18] the one thing that the prophet taught us
[1:01:22] is
[1:01:25] churches wanted to stand behind
[1:01:28] i this is the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:01:31] the bible doesn't come out and say
[1:01:33] this is the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:01:39] so we know it's not tongues
[1:01:44] we know it's not just putting your name
[1:01:46] on the book
[1:01:50] but he always pointed us that our flesh
[1:01:52] needs to be manifesting
[1:01:54] the word that's right
[1:01:59] it's about holding ourselves accountable
[1:02:01] to living the word
[1:02:02] amen anybody can say i got the holy
[1:02:04] ghost because i
[1:02:05] did this i did that but that means
[1:02:08] nothing
[1:02:09] what means everything is that our flesh
[1:02:12] is manifesting
[1:02:13] christ amen and satan is always trying
[1:02:17] to get us
[1:02:18] to savor things that are pleasing to us
[1:02:21] that's why it's so hard to say what
[1:02:23] makes this age the most evil age the
[1:02:25] most deceptive age is because you got
[1:02:26] everything at your fingertips that you
[1:02:28] could want
[1:02:31] and the holy ghost is always trying to
[1:02:33] get us to set our affections on things
[1:02:35] above
[1:02:36] it's like two different spirits then
[1:02:39] jesus then said jesus
[1:02:41] unto his disciples if any man will come
[1:02:44] after me let him deny himself and take
[1:02:46] up his cross and follow me
[1:02:49] for whosoever say shall save uh
[1:02:52] whosoever shall save
[1:02:54] i'm sorry for whosoever will save his
[1:02:57] life
[1:02:58] shall lose it and whosoever will lose
[1:03:01] his life for my
[1:03:02] sake shall find it and i think it was in
[1:03:05] the book of mark he also said for the
[1:03:07] gospel's sake as well
[1:03:08] for what is a man profited if he shall
[1:03:11] gain the whole world lose his soul
[1:03:12] or what shall he a man give in exchange
[1:03:16] for his soul so before we can
[1:03:20] before he came to christ we we were
[1:03:23] totally into ourselves
[1:03:26] we didn't know about surrendering
[1:03:27] anything except if we
[1:03:29] yet obey mom and dad if you didn't you
[1:03:31] get grounded
[1:03:32] you don't obey the the the laws of the
[1:03:35] land you go to jail that's about all we
[1:03:37] we really knew but after we
[1:03:40] entered into the covenant with christ
[1:03:44] satan is still trying to get us to get
[1:03:47] interested
[1:03:48] in ourselves
[1:03:52] to savor the things that are pleasing to
[1:03:54] our flesh and in this last
[1:03:55] age he has convinced the church world
[1:03:57] now
[1:03:58] to become lovers of their own self more
[1:04:00] than lovers of god
[1:04:02] amen it's like they've entered a
[1:04:04] covenant with themselves
[1:04:07] so we're living in in perilous times
[1:04:11] it could be like a newspaper the
[1:04:12] perilous times
[1:04:14] and we hear about it all the time
[1:04:21] but after paul or
[1:04:25] after jesus gets done rebuking peter
[1:04:31] and and pretty much
[1:04:34] calls uh peter who he just gave the keys
[1:04:36] to
[1:04:38] and that satan was using his vessel
[1:04:43] using his vessel calling it out
[1:04:46] he says i'm not the only one that's
[1:04:48] going to suffer if you're going to
[1:04:49] really follow me if you're going to be
[1:04:50] my disciple you're going to have to do
[1:04:51] the same thing
[1:04:54] these are the thoughts of god
[1:04:59] and satan has always come to us with
[1:05:02] thoughts
[1:05:03] that you don't have to surrender
[1:05:05] everything to god as long as you're in
[1:05:08] the message
[1:05:10] as long as you say you believe
[1:05:13] just don't enter that covenant of total
[1:05:15] surrender amen
[1:05:20] god has called us to separate amen
[1:05:23] to try the spirit separate from the
[1:05:25] spirit that's trying to get you to
[1:05:27] please yourself
[1:05:29] and he's calling us to please him and to
[1:05:31] serve him amen
[1:05:34] jesus was not trying to make peace with
[1:05:37] the spirit that was on peter
[1:05:41] jesus didn't play around with that
[1:05:42] spirit he used
[1:05:44] his sword peter
[1:05:47] don't believe everything you hear
[1:05:51] you could be wrong with your thought
[1:05:54] amen
[1:05:55] test your thought your opinion might be
[1:05:58] wrong
[1:06:00] matthew chapter 10 verse 34 think not
[1:06:02] that i come to send peace on the earth
[1:06:05] i came not to send peace but a sword
[1:06:09] for i have come to set a variance
[1:06:11] against his father and his daughter
[1:06:12] against her mother
[1:06:14] and the daughter in law against her
[1:06:16] mother-in-law
[1:06:18] and a man's foe shall be of his own
[1:06:20] household
[1:06:24] and he that loveth father or mother more
[1:06:26] than me is not worthy of me
[1:06:28] and he that loveth son or daughter more
[1:06:30] than me is not worthy of me and he that
[1:06:32] taketh not up his cross and followeth me
[1:06:34] it's not worthy of me
[1:06:35] so he's bringing a separation this
[1:06:38] covenant
[1:06:38] is between me and you right amen
[1:06:42] you don't put anything between this
[1:06:43] covenant now this is important because
[1:06:45] when we're getting these thoughts
[1:06:47] on a regular basis
[1:06:51] did that brother mark saying or amends
[1:06:52] me that our thoughts speak louder
[1:06:58] in heaven to god and his mind than our
[1:07:00] our words do
[1:07:01] down here our thoughts are important we
[1:07:05] got to try
[1:07:05] that spirit because it's trying to
[1:07:07] seduce us
[1:07:09] it's trying to get us to lay back
[1:07:14] amen
[1:07:19] it cost everything we have to enter in
[1:07:21] the covenant with god
[1:07:23] amen and it will continue to cost us
[1:07:26] everything if we're ever going to
[1:07:28] manifest christ
[1:07:31] we are not able to enter that covenant
[1:07:34] if we love anyone
[1:07:35] including our own will more than god
[1:07:38] amen
[1:07:39] in other words christ will not manifest
[1:07:40] in our lives if we refuse to pick up our
[1:07:42] cross
[1:07:44] as much as we want in our life if we
[1:07:47] don't pick up our cross
[1:07:48] we're not going to manifest christ
[1:07:54] the things that we we see that's
[1:07:57] so beautiful about christ is that he
[1:08:00] died for us he suffered for us
[1:08:03] that that i could be free
[1:08:07] that's the greatest thing for god so
[1:08:09] loved the world that he gave
[1:08:12] and the thoughts that come into our head
[1:08:14] from the devil
[1:08:15] but the antichrist doesn't want us to
[1:08:18] manifest that spirit
[1:08:20] of laying down our life of serving of
[1:08:23] giving
[1:08:24] of reaching out to lost souls it wants
[1:08:26] us to just be just
[1:08:28] this message believer that that knows
[1:08:30] everything
[1:08:34] and that's all that matters
[1:08:38] brother mark read a scripture in the
[1:08:40] bible
[1:08:41] during our men's means that
[1:08:45] knowledge puffed up right but love
[1:08:48] edify it that's right amen and and love
[1:08:52] the love of christ can only be seen in
[1:08:55] us if we're dead
[1:08:56] otherwise you're seeing our love now in
[1:08:59] luke chapter 14 jesus makes it
[1:09:01] clear three times that we cannot enter a
[1:09:04] covenant of discipleship
[1:09:06] without a full surrender to him this is
[1:09:08] how important this is
[1:09:10] and in verses 26 27 and 31 but i would
[1:09:14] like to start
[1:09:15] with just reading luke chapter 14 verse
[1:09:17] 26 if any man will come after me and
[1:09:19] hate not his father mother
[1:09:20] wife children brother sister jay and his
[1:09:24] own life also he cannot be my disciple
[1:09:27] amen and whosoever does not bear his
[1:09:29] cross and come after me
[1:09:31] cannot be my disciple no
[1:09:35] covenant there now here jesus trying to
[1:09:38] explain what happens if you start off
[1:09:40] with the lord you start i'm going to
[1:09:41] make this come and i'm going to get
[1:09:43] baptized
[1:09:43] i'm going to i'm going to say i
[1:09:45] surrender to you lord but you do not
[1:09:47] continue to build
[1:09:48] verse 28 for which if you intend to
[1:09:50] build a tower sitteth not down first
[1:09:52] and counter the cost whether it have
[1:09:54] sufficient to
[1:09:56] finish it lest happily after
[1:09:59] ye have laid the foundation and not able
[1:10:02] to finish it
[1:10:03] all that behold it began to mock him
[1:10:08] saying this man began to build
[1:10:11] and was not able to finish
[1:10:16] so what is the cost the cost is
[1:10:19] are you are you going to give all that
[1:10:22] you have
[1:10:22] your heart rate that's the cost
[1:10:26] because many people are willing to get
[1:10:27] baptized they're willing to say
[1:10:30] i repent of my past i'm going to get
[1:10:32] baptized
[1:10:33] and i'm saved
[1:10:38] that's starting that's starting your
[1:10:40] building but what are you really
[1:10:42] building you're building christ
[1:10:44] the name of the lord is a high tower
[1:10:47] amen and you've got to finish that tower
[1:10:49] amen you got to come to
[1:10:51] statue of a perfect man you can't stay
[1:10:53] there in the foundation
[1:10:55] got to continue to build amen
[1:10:58] amen amen
[1:11:02] verse 31 and hear jesus explaining the
[1:11:06] same
[1:11:07] thing in a third way first he just come
[1:11:09] out and said it then he gives this
[1:11:11] little uh uh like picturette thing
[1:11:15] with with a tower and and now he's
[1:11:18] talking about an army but he's really
[1:11:20] saying the same thing
[1:11:21] the exact same thing but another way for
[1:11:23] us to catch it
[1:11:25] or what king going to make war against
[1:11:28] another king sith
[1:11:29] not down first and consulteth whether he
[1:11:32] be able with ten thousand
[1:11:34] to meet him that cometh against him with
[1:11:36] twenty thousand
[1:11:37] or else while the other is yet a great
[1:11:40] way off
[1:11:41] he sendeth an embassage and desire the
[1:11:44] conditions of peace so likewise
[1:11:46] whosoever you he be of you that
[1:11:49] forsaketh not all that he have
[1:11:51] that's right he cannot be disciple
[1:11:54] so why is this so important why is why
[1:11:58] is
[1:11:58] jesus talking about this
[1:12:02] the devil knows that if you surrender
[1:12:05] everything
[1:12:06] he has no no he's helpless with you he
[1:12:09] can't do nothing with you
[1:12:10] that's true but if you just hold on to
[1:12:13] your will
[1:12:14] you hang on to what's pleasing to your
[1:12:16] flesh well he's got a crack in the door
[1:12:21] and that's why it's important that you
[1:12:23] understand that these thoughts that are
[1:12:24] coming into you
[1:12:25] are going to lean one way or the other
[1:12:27] amen
[1:12:31] we can't fight against god
[1:12:35] either will surrender to his will or we
[1:12:38] can't enter in that
[1:12:39] covenant of a discipleship amen
[1:12:44] now we maybe don't know that right off
[1:12:46] the bat when we come to christ right
[1:12:48] but after a while we grow and we learn
[1:12:51] many things i like to say to you but you
[1:12:54] can't bear it now
[1:12:55] but after the holy ghost comes right
[1:12:59] we got to go on to perfection that's
[1:13:02] what the bible says
[1:13:03] jesus expresses his view for the person
[1:13:06] who loses their taste for the things of
[1:13:08] god in other words for the person who
[1:13:10] stops
[1:13:10] building amen the person who starts and
[1:13:13] then stops
[1:13:14] verse 34 salt is good but if
[1:13:17] the salt have lost his
[1:13:21] savor wherewith shall it be seasoned
[1:13:25] it is neither fit for the land nor yet
[1:13:28] for the dunghill but men cast it out
[1:13:30] and he that have ears let him hear
[1:13:34] if you lose your savior
[1:13:37] if you lose i surrender all i surrender
[1:13:40] to you lord
[1:13:41] that's right if you lose that that's
[1:13:44] right
[1:13:45] god can't use you
[1:13:50] amen
[1:13:53] so get behind me satan thou art offense
[1:13:56] for thou
[1:13:57] savers not the things that be of god
[1:14:00] and here jesus is saying look i'm going
[1:14:02] to go to jerusalem i'm going to be
[1:14:03] suffering all these things
[1:14:06] i'm doing it for a purpose that souls
[1:14:08] could be saved
[1:14:09] amen well we've got to do the same thing
[1:14:12] we got to surrender so souls can be
[1:14:13] saved
[1:14:14] now that's the things that are savoring
[1:14:16] to god
[1:14:17] right but if our life loses its salt it
[1:14:20] loses his savor
[1:14:22] and we just become pictures on the wall
[1:14:25] of people in a pew
[1:14:27] not a living epistle not going out there
[1:14:30] and winning souls
[1:14:32] we let the the the the news
[1:14:36] that are around us consume our mind our
[1:14:38] thoughts and all of a sudden
[1:14:40] we become conformed to the way that
[1:14:41] they're thinking and we
[1:14:43] we we miss out
[1:14:47] we got to try the spirit
[1:14:52] now when the tower is finished being
[1:14:54] built
[1:14:56] we would consider that complete
[1:14:59] in other words we finally reached
[1:15:02] our initial intention when we started to
[1:15:05] serve christ
[1:15:06] is that right and for the believer that
[1:15:08] would be the image of christ coming
[1:15:10] into the complete image of christ and
[1:15:12] that would be a perfect
[1:15:14] love a perfect word a perfect love it's
[1:15:18] the same thing
[1:15:19] i'm not mean to two different things
[1:15:24] god so the word he so loved the world
[1:15:28] that he gave
[1:15:31] and every spirit that doesn't confess
[1:15:33] that jesus christ has come in the flesh
[1:15:37] as antichrist
[1:15:40] so i want you to think about this
[1:15:42] perfection
[1:15:44] matthew chapter 5 verse 48 be ye
[1:15:47] therefore perfect even as your father
[1:15:48] which is in heaven
[1:15:49] is perfect
[1:15:53] so this is where we got to get to that
[1:15:56] image what we initially started out for
[1:15:58] jesus describes the perfection of our
[1:16:00] father that's in heaven as
[1:16:02] one that loves your enemy
[1:16:05] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:16:08] them that hate you
[1:16:09] pray for them that despitefully use you
[1:16:11] and persecute you
[1:16:12] now that's where we need to be in our
[1:16:14] heart amen
[1:16:15] in our spirit in our mind this is what
[1:16:17] we need to manifest
[1:16:19] be a real reality
[1:16:23] that ye may be the children of your
[1:16:25] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:16:27] the sun to rise on the evil and on the
[1:16:29] good
[1:16:29] and he saith reign on the just and the
[1:16:31] unjust
[1:16:33] and there is no reward to love somebody
[1:16:36] but not everybody
[1:16:41] that's loving with respect to persons
[1:16:43] and don't even the publicans do that
[1:16:45] amen so don't believe everything that
[1:16:48] you hear
[1:16:50] it's okay not to love this person it's
[1:16:52] okay not to pray
[1:16:53] it's okay not don't let this person use
[1:16:55] you
[1:16:58] really don't let that person use you
[1:17:05] what sounds right don't believe
[1:17:07] everything you hear
[1:17:10] how are you about to pray for somebody
[1:17:12] if you don't let them use you
[1:17:14] you're supposed to pray for those that
[1:17:16] tell me if you don't let that person use
[1:17:18] you somebody will
[1:17:21] and the closer you get to god the more
[1:17:23] people use you
[1:17:24] that's true the more you lay down your
[1:17:26] life amen
[1:17:28] they use the prophet left and right
[1:17:30] money
[1:17:31] the gifts the the bring more people to
[1:17:34] church
[1:17:35] they use them a lot
[1:17:41] but you know when somebody uses you you
[1:17:44] can just pray for it fulfill the
[1:17:45] scripture
[1:17:47] now you can do something that's
[1:17:49] perfection
[1:17:51] that's what i love about let's get back
[1:17:52] to first john chapter 4.
[1:17:59] beloved believe not every
[1:18:02] spirit
[1:18:06] but try the spirits try the spirits
[1:18:12] whether they are of god because many of
[1:18:14] the spirits
[1:18:15] that come to our mind many of the
[1:18:17] thoughts that come to our mind
[1:18:21] they're of the world amen
[1:18:24] hereby know ye the spirit of god
[1:18:27] every spirit that confesseth that jesus
[1:18:30] christ is come in the flesh
[1:18:32] is of god and every spirit that
[1:18:33] confesseth that jesus christ
[1:18:36] confesses not that jesus christ is come
[1:18:38] in your flesh
[1:18:39] is out of god and this is the spirit of
[1:18:42] antichrist where
[1:18:43] you have heard that it should come and
[1:18:44] even now already
[1:18:46] is it in the world that's right
[1:18:51] now you're of god little children
[1:18:55] and you have overcome them now these are
[1:18:58] spirits now these are not a bunch of
[1:19:00] people
[1:19:00] walk around saying i'm a prophet
[1:19:04] because we don't have many of them
[1:19:07] don't how many people know those
[1:19:09] prophets run around
[1:19:10] these are spirits these are thoughts
[1:19:12] that come into your mind amen
[1:19:15] but the bible says you've overcome them
[1:19:18] because you have something greater
[1:19:20] inside of you
[1:19:22] you have the holy ghost inside of you
[1:19:25] and you're able
[1:19:26] to try the spirit by the holy ghost
[1:19:30] the holy ghost won't let you just sit
[1:19:32] there and spend all day thinking on
[1:19:34] negative things amen
[1:19:36] i know that's going to hurt but it's the
[1:19:38] truth
[1:19:40] because there's a god that's greater
[1:19:42] than the devil that lives inside you
[1:19:44] and you've got to yield to that amen
[1:19:48] and he says here in verse 5 they are of
[1:19:50] the world therefore they speak of the
[1:19:52] world
[1:19:53] and the world hear them and that's the
[1:19:54] same thing peter was doing
[1:19:57] no no we're not going to hurt ourselves
[1:20:01] that's of the world
[1:20:05] they they speak of themselves
[1:20:08] and the world heareth them we are of god
[1:20:12] and he that knoweth god heareth us and
[1:20:15] he that is not of god hearth not us
[1:20:16] hereby
[1:20:17] know he the spirit truth and the spirit
[1:20:20] of
[1:20:22] air they are of the world therefore they
[1:20:25] speak of the world so everything the
[1:20:27] devil is talking to you
[1:20:29] is about your flesh that is the world
[1:20:31] amen
[1:20:32] it's your nature it's your carnality
[1:20:34] it's everything that your
[1:20:36] your flesh is into
[1:20:44] you know we used to do this thing um
[1:20:48] where it was to help people not think
[1:20:51] negative
[1:20:53] because some people just have negative
[1:20:54] thoughts so much
[1:20:57] and i told a couple people i said you
[1:20:59] just take a rubber band put on your
[1:21:00] wrist and you just every time you get
[1:21:02] you you you finally realize that you got
[1:21:04] negative thought you take
[1:21:05] and you pop that rubber band on your
[1:21:07] wrist and just kind of give yourself a
[1:21:09] little spanking on your wrist
[1:21:11] boom now and you know a couple of times
[1:21:14] it's not a big deal
[1:21:16] but after a while it begins to hurt and
[1:21:18] then you realize how many times you have
[1:21:20] negative thoughts
[1:21:22] that you don't think you're having them
[1:21:24] and it's the same way
[1:21:26] when you have selfish thoughts thoughts
[1:21:28] about yourself thoughts of the world
[1:21:32] we're in the world amen but we're not of
[1:21:34] the world
[1:21:37] and it's up to us god's not going to try
[1:21:39] the spirit for us
[1:21:43] we got to be the one to try the spirit
[1:21:44] we got to be the one to take the time
[1:21:46] to think about what's going on in our
[1:21:48] brain
[1:21:50] beloved let us not let us love
[1:21:53] one another right now we're just
[1:21:57] here we are we're he's he's trying to
[1:21:59] separate now the two spirits again
[1:22:03] the spirit of the world the spirit of
[1:22:05] god
[1:22:06] believe not every spirit
[1:22:09] let us not let us love one another for
[1:22:12] love is of god and everyone that is
[1:22:14] that everyone that loveth is born of god
[1:22:17] and knoweth god
[1:22:22] he that loveth not he really doesn't
[1:22:25] know god
[1:22:26] that's true for god is love
[1:22:30] that's right here it is in this was
[1:22:33] manifested manifested
[1:22:37] the flesh it is confessing it
[1:22:42] and this was manifested the love of god
[1:22:44] toward us because
[1:22:45] god sent his only begotten son into the
[1:22:47] world that we might
[1:22:49] live through him
[1:22:53] here in his love not that
[1:22:56] we love god but that he loved his first
[1:22:58] and he sent his son to be the
[1:22:59] appreciation of our sin beloved if god
[1:23:02] so loved us
[1:23:04] we ought to love one another he's
[1:23:07] showing us
[1:23:07] what our flesh should be manifesting
[1:23:11] not saying i believe but our our flesh
[1:23:14] should be manifesting the love of god
[1:23:18] amen
[1:23:20] turn with me to saint john chapter 8
[1:23:22] verse 39
[1:23:24] we're going to come back to this
[1:23:28] saint john chapter 8 verse 39 they
[1:23:30] answered and said unto him
[1:23:32] abraham is our father
[1:23:35] and jesus saith unto them if
[1:23:39] ye were abraham's children
[1:23:43] your flesh would manifest it that's
[1:23:45] right
[1:23:46] you would do the works of abraham amen
[1:23:49] it would be manifested inside of them
[1:23:51] what did
[1:23:52] abraham do he surrendered his will to
[1:23:55] god
[1:23:56] he gave up everything amen he loved god
[1:24:00] so much and he became
[1:24:01] obedient to the complete word of god
[1:24:04] he kept surrendering kept surrendering
[1:24:06] he refused to love his family
[1:24:09] lot more than god he separated
[1:24:12] from his own family mother father sister
[1:24:15] brother
[1:24:15] just like we read yet he never lost his
[1:24:19] burden to intercede for lot
[1:24:21] he manifested his love towards lot in
[1:24:23] many different ways
[1:24:25] he loved lot as himself
[1:24:30] so he says if you were abraham's
[1:24:32] children you would do the works of
[1:24:34] abraham in other words these religious
[1:24:36] people
[1:24:37] who said they believed in god did not
[1:24:39] manifest the love of god
[1:24:41] right verse 40 but now you seek to kill
[1:24:45] me
[1:24:46] a man that have told you the truth
[1:24:49] which i have heard of god this did
[1:24:53] not abraham amen jesus was looking at
[1:24:57] the manifestation
[1:24:58] of their flesh
[1:25:02] and when you see
[1:25:06] somebody seeking to kill somebody's
[1:25:10] influence
[1:25:13] this did not
[1:25:17] abraham do right
[1:25:20] this is not the works of abraham it's a
[1:25:23] wrong
[1:25:24] spirit amen it's an
[1:25:27] antichrist spirit when you're seeking to
[1:25:30] kill someone's influence it's a wrong
[1:25:32] spirit it's an antichrist spirit this
[1:25:35] did not
[1:25:35] abraham and we're the children of
[1:25:38] abraham if anything he should be
[1:25:40] interceding like lot did
[1:25:43] are you going to destroy the whole city
[1:25:44] for for
[1:25:46] uh when there's 50 when there's 40 when
[1:25:49] there's 30 when there's 20 when there's
[1:25:50] 10
[1:25:51] my nephew's down there
[1:25:54] he didn't kill his influence oh well he
[1:25:56] should have pitched his tent towards the
[1:25:57] world
[1:26:01] i'm we're talking about trying the
[1:26:03] spirits we're trying to become more
[1:26:05] spiritual
[1:26:06] amen that's what this is about
[1:26:10] verse 41 jesus said you do the deeds of
[1:26:14] your father
[1:26:16] and they said then said they to him
[1:26:20] we be not born of fornication like you
[1:26:23] are
[1:26:24] starting this little drama fight
[1:26:28] we have one father even god
[1:26:33] the antichrist spirit actually got them
[1:26:35] to believe
[1:26:36] without it being manifested in the flesh
[1:26:39] they were they were believers in god
[1:26:42] but they did not try the spirit
[1:26:46] to love the lord they got with all the
[1:26:47] heart with all their soul with all their
[1:26:48] might
[1:26:49] to love thy neighbor as thyself they
[1:26:50] didn't want they didn't try the spirit
[1:26:52] they didn't need you because
[1:26:53] they were so much religious believed
[1:26:56] amen
[1:26:58] i don't need to try the spirit i know
[1:27:00] i'm right
[1:27:02] verse 42 jesus said unto them if god
[1:27:04] were your father
[1:27:07] you would love me
[1:27:11] wow didn't that we just read that in
[1:27:12] saint john
[1:27:14] if you're born again you love amen
[1:27:18] if you really really know god if god is
[1:27:22] your father
[1:27:24] i don't care how bad you think i am you
[1:27:26] would love me
[1:27:29] for i proceeded forth i proceeded fourth
[1:27:33] and came from god neither came i myself
[1:27:35] but he sent me
[1:27:36] and if you want to know if god is your
[1:27:38] father love jesus
[1:27:42] and love one another amen
[1:27:46] then you know there's no other scripture
[1:27:48] there's no other scripture
[1:27:51] by this shall all men know that you
[1:27:54] are his disciples that you're into this
[1:27:56] covenant with him
[1:27:58] that you're sold out is when you can
[1:28:01] love your enemy
[1:28:03] because anybody can stand for part of
[1:28:05] the word
[1:28:06] at any given time but not the whole word
[1:28:11] if you're standing for the whole word
[1:28:13] the whole
[1:28:14] law is fulfilled in this one word that
[1:28:16] you love one another
[1:28:19] right that you love your neighbor
[1:28:24] as you love god you you love your
[1:28:26] neighbors yourself
[1:28:29] that's the fulfillment that's the
[1:28:31] perfection
[1:28:34] now if you love with the human love that
[1:28:36] doesn't go all the way to there
[1:28:39] then you're picking and choosing who
[1:28:40] you're gonna love when you're going to
[1:28:41] love and
[1:28:42] not really pray for them with your uh a
[1:28:45] heart that's full of compassion
[1:28:47] and you can't say that is the
[1:28:49] manifestation of the love of god
[1:28:51] that's the christ because you're leaving
[1:28:53] out part of the word
[1:28:55] right you see what i'm saying here
[1:28:58] verse 43 43 why do you not understand my
[1:29:01] speech even because you cannot hear
[1:29:04] my word amen hear of your father the
[1:29:07] devil
[1:29:08] and the lust of your father you will do
[1:29:12] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[1:29:14] abode not the truth because
[1:29:16] there's no truth in him when he speaketh
[1:29:20] a lie
[1:29:20] he speaketh of look it of his own
[1:29:24] for he's a liar and the father of it he
[1:29:27] speaks of his own it's all about
[1:29:29] pleasing self amen the lust of lucifer
[1:29:33] was to do his own will
[1:29:36] he taught it to the angels to do the
[1:29:38] same thing you just have whatever you
[1:29:39] want
[1:29:40] he taught to eve he teaches us to do the
[1:29:43] same thing
[1:29:45] and if he doesn't get what he wants what
[1:29:48] does he do
[1:29:50] he murders jesus said he was a murderer
[1:29:54] from the beginning how many souls
[1:29:56] has satan murdered how many souls
[1:30:00] is satan sending to hell
[1:30:04] by telling them a lie oh
[1:30:08] you're not gonna you're not gonna die
[1:30:10] you're gonna be just like god you'll be
[1:30:11] fine
[1:30:13] he's a murderer
[1:30:18] was this not the same spirit that was
[1:30:20] manifested in cain
[1:30:21] who murdered his brother when he didn't
[1:30:24] get what he wanted
[1:30:25] amen is this not the same spirit that is
[1:30:28] manifested inside of us
[1:30:30] when we're killing somebody's influence
[1:30:32] because we're not getting the attention
[1:30:33] we want
[1:30:34] right amen now i'm just speaking the
[1:30:36] truth now
[1:30:39] amen just because we don't take it that
[1:30:41] far
[1:30:42] doesn't mean it's still not the same
[1:30:43] spirit amen
[1:30:45] so we we don't want to believe
[1:30:48] everything that we hear
[1:30:50] the devil is trying to catch us
[1:30:54] the spirit of anarchists will try to get
[1:30:56] us to dominate one another
[1:31:01] dominating a home
[1:31:04] buy them the head anyways
[1:31:10] dominate work
[1:31:14] dominating the church dominate
[1:31:17] amen
[1:31:20] eventually will begin to bite and devour
[1:31:23] one another
[1:31:25] to prove who's the who's better better
[1:31:28] than the other person
[1:31:30] amen the spirit of christ will try to
[1:31:33] get us to serve
[1:31:36] and love one another amen but the flesh
[1:31:39] really isn't interested in esteeming the
[1:31:41] others better than ourselves
[1:31:44] so don't believe every spirit and don't
[1:31:47] believe a spirit that's trying to
[1:31:49] get you to dominate don't believe
[1:31:52] everything you hear because it's not of
[1:31:55] god
[1:31:55] you should know the spirit of the holy
[1:31:58] ghost
[1:32:02] even the bible says when there's you
[1:32:04] know the prophet the spirit of the
[1:32:05] prophets is subject to the prophets
[1:32:07] there's a there's a there's not only an
[1:32:10] order but there's a submission there
[1:32:17] it's so beautiful the spirit of christ
[1:32:20] is so perfect and so beautiful
[1:32:22] amen it's we who begin to
[1:32:26] mix things up and and take things into
[1:32:29] our control and we
[1:32:30] lose the real spirit of christ manifest
[1:32:33] in the flesh
[1:32:35] mark chapter 10 verse 35 and james and
[1:32:38] john the sons of zebedee come
[1:32:39] unto him saying master we would that
[1:32:41] thou should
[1:32:42] do for us we would that thou should just
[1:32:46] do for us
[1:32:47] whatsoever we shall desire
[1:32:51] isn't it like us
[1:32:54] this is what i want lord and he said
[1:32:57] unto them what would you have that i
[1:32:59] should do for you
[1:33:01] and they said unto him grant us that we
[1:33:04] may sit one
[1:33:05] on the right hand the other on the left
[1:33:06] hand like glory and jesus said to them
[1:33:08] you
[1:33:09] know not what you
[1:33:13] ask i wonder how many times we've asked
[1:33:17] for something that we don't know what
[1:33:19] we're asking for can you drink the cup
[1:33:23] that i drink of course we know this is
[1:33:24] talking about suffering right
[1:33:26] amen and be baptized with the baptism
[1:33:29] that i am baptized with
[1:33:32] that's why they didn't know what they
[1:33:33] were asking they thought it was just
[1:33:36] gonna be easy to get there
[1:33:40] and they said unto him we can and jesus
[1:33:43] said unto them
[1:33:44] ye shall indeed drink of the cup
[1:33:47] you're gonna drink of it
[1:33:50] that i drink of and the batches i'm
[1:33:52] baptized with what shall you be baptized
[1:33:55] but to sit on my right hand and on my
[1:33:57] left hand is not given
[1:33:59] it's not mine to give but it shall be
[1:34:02] given to them to whom is prepared
[1:34:04] amen and when the ten heard it
[1:34:07] they began to be much displeased
[1:34:11] with james and john because now
[1:34:15] they thought they were special they
[1:34:18] received this thought
[1:34:20] that was as much uh antichrist
[1:34:24] as the thought of we're not going to
[1:34:26] suffer
[1:34:28] is the same same thing
[1:34:32] this spirit began to spread in the
[1:34:34] church
[1:34:36] and the other ten were so
[1:34:39] now they were just a little displeased
[1:34:41] they were they got on the phone and they
[1:34:43] began to talk about somebody in the
[1:34:45] church
[1:34:48] oh yeah we won't mention any names
[1:34:55] but they just
[1:34:59] everybody just started talking about us
[1:35:01] james and john they they thought they
[1:35:02] think they're special they're better
[1:35:03] than us and we're
[1:35:04] we're we're walking the same roads we're
[1:35:06] doing the same things that jesus asked
[1:35:08] and
[1:35:09] and it it's just not fair and they they
[1:35:11] begin
[1:35:13] to develop they began to believe
[1:35:17] every thought that was coming into their
[1:35:19] head they didn't stop and say this isn't
[1:35:21] right
[1:35:23] they just they just yielded to it
[1:35:26] and jesus called to them i love this
[1:35:30] mercy and grace jesus called to them and
[1:35:33] saith unto them
[1:35:34] you know that they which are
[1:35:37] are accounted to rule over the gentiles
[1:35:40] they
[1:35:40] exercise this type of spirit
[1:35:44] and their great ones exercise authority
[1:35:46] upon them
[1:35:47] but so shall it not be among you
[1:35:51] we're just not going to do that in our
[1:35:53] church
[1:35:54] but whosoever wants to be the greatest
[1:35:56] among you
[1:35:58] just let him minister now that doesn't
[1:36:01] mean the pulpit here
[1:36:02] just want to make that clear
[1:36:07] to me clean the church is important very
[1:36:09] important
[1:36:13] you can minister in a lot of different
[1:36:14] ways
[1:36:16] but anytime that you've got some sort of
[1:36:20] popularity or something that's attached
[1:36:22] to it man it's
[1:36:23] dangerous it'd be better
[1:36:27] to serve and get nothing out of it
[1:36:29] that's true service
[1:36:30] amen and that's what jesus is telling us
[1:36:36] here
[1:36:38] whosoever you that be the chiefest
[1:36:41] shall be the servant of
[1:36:45] just a few people that you talk to now
[1:36:47] and then hear it this way that no
[1:36:50] all servant of all
[1:36:53] and whoever talked to you oh i'm servant
[1:36:55] i'm a servant
[1:36:58] what do you want i want to serve you how
[1:37:00] can i serve you
[1:37:02] for even the son of man came not to be
[1:37:06] ministered unto
[1:37:07] you know what you owe me i've done this
[1:37:09] for you
[1:37:10] but to minister and to give his life
[1:37:14] a ransom for many amen
[1:37:17] so jesus is telling the disciples this
[1:37:18] is the example i've laid for you this is
[1:37:20] what i'm doing
[1:37:21] i didn't come i'm the i'm the i'm the
[1:37:23] one that created everything and i didn't
[1:37:25] even come
[1:37:26] to get served
[1:37:30] but you want to be my disciple you want
[1:37:32] to serve me and this is how you do it
[1:37:33] you lay down your life like i did
[1:37:37] now these is how you try the spirit
[1:37:41] because there's a motive behind the
[1:37:42] spirit that comes into your mind
[1:37:51] we're talking about trying the spirit
[1:37:54] christ in the flesh will manifest
[1:37:58] as a servant for many
[1:38:01] not as one who's always manifesting
[1:38:04] that they want to dominate
[1:38:08] now i've seen this that some
[1:38:11] spirits can play it both ways
[1:38:15] they can sometimes be a servant and
[1:38:17] sometimes dominate
[1:38:20] now look when you're in charge you have
[1:38:23] to take charge
[1:38:26] but god has not called us to dominate
[1:38:28] sometimes
[1:38:29] and then sometimes to serve it's not if
[1:38:32] you can play the servant
[1:38:33] it's if you can live a servant right
[1:38:35] amen if you can
[1:38:36] live it out on a regular basis
[1:38:40] christ in the flesh will manifest as a
[1:38:43] servant to all
[1:38:44] as someone who loves all
[1:38:47] without respect to persons love them
[1:38:51] enough
[1:38:51] to serve them don't love them enough to
[1:38:55] say
[1:38:55] god bless you go on your way love them
[1:38:58] enough to serve them
[1:39:00] so don't believe everything you hear
[1:39:02] let's try to wrap this up
[1:39:05] how we doing on time
[1:39:08] let's just read it real quick then real
[1:39:11] real quick
[1:39:12] we left off let's start with with verse
[1:39:14] number 11
[1:39:15] beloved if god so loved us we
[1:39:18] all also to love one another
[1:39:22] no man have seen god at any time if we
[1:39:25] love one another
[1:39:26] god dwelleth in us and his love is
[1:39:28] perfected in us
[1:39:30] hereby know we that we dwell in him and
[1:39:33] he and us
[1:39:33] because he have given us his spirit so
[1:39:36] his spirit inside of us is
[1:39:38] just manifesting that love
[1:39:41] manifesting the word and and we have
[1:39:43] seen and do
[1:39:44] testify that the father sent the son to
[1:39:47] be the savior of the world
[1:39:48] and whosoever will confess that
[1:39:52] whoever will confess that that jesus is
[1:39:55] the son of god
[1:39:56] god dwelleth in him and he in the world
[1:39:58] so how's the world gonna know he said
[1:40:00] by this shall all men know this is
[1:40:03] this manifestation now because we've got
[1:40:06] to try the spirit
[1:40:07] if you look at this whole book of john
[1:40:09] it's about love
[1:40:13] and we have known and believe the love
[1:40:16] of
[1:40:17] the love that god have to us god is love
[1:40:21] and he that dwelleth in love dwelting
[1:40:23] god and god in him
[1:40:25] and herein is our love made perfect
[1:40:30] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:40:32] judgment
[1:40:34] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:40:39] how is he
[1:40:42] loves his enemy rain falls on the just
[1:40:45] and the unjust
[1:40:46] prays for them that despitefully use
[1:40:48] them that's where jesus
[1:40:50] told us perfect love is
[1:40:53] and we can have that in this world right
[1:40:56] now
[1:40:57] we can manifest that right now amen and
[1:41:00] when
[1:41:00] if we do manifest perfect love right now
[1:41:03] in this world
[1:41:04] we can have boldness on the day of
[1:41:05] judgment because
[1:41:07] as he is so are we in this world
[1:41:10] it's so beautiful there is no fear
[1:41:14] you can go and approach the the with
[1:41:17] boldness on the day of judgment there
[1:41:18] will be no fear why
[1:41:20] because the perfect love that's inside
[1:41:22] of you that you've been manifesting
[1:41:24] it cast out all fear amen because fear
[1:41:28] have torment
[1:41:29] and he that feareth is not made perfect
[1:41:31] in love
[1:41:32] we love him because he first loved us if
[1:41:35] any man say i love
[1:41:36] god and hate his brother he
[1:41:39] is a liar
[1:41:43] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[1:41:45] he have not seen
[1:41:47] how can he love god who he has not seen
[1:41:50] and this commandment have we from him
[1:41:52] that he
[1:41:53] who loveth god love his brother also
[1:41:58] did not we read here that no man is
[1:42:00] seeing god at any time
[1:42:04] no man has seen god any time but
[1:42:07] if christ is living in you and loving
[1:42:09] through you
[1:42:10] they see god in you
[1:42:14] they see god in the flesh again that's
[1:42:16] god's desire it's his yearning
[1:42:18] amen we've got to try the spirits make
[1:42:21] sure
[1:42:22] that we're just not letting anything
[1:42:23] float in our mind and giving it
[1:42:25] you know okay or free reign we'll never
[1:42:28] manifest the love of god
[1:42:29] well we gotta slice it right here if not
[1:42:32] it'll become our thoughts and it'll
[1:42:34] become our words and our actions and
[1:42:36] before you know it would develop this
[1:42:38] attitude that's antichrist and don't
[1:42:39] even realize what happened
[1:42:41] amen amen let's stand together
[1:42:44] god bless you god bless you
[1:42:48] god give you
[1:42:52] a great desire to try the spirits
[1:42:58] this this may have not been
[1:43:02] shall we say a message that is like wow
[1:43:05] so perfectly flowery
[1:43:09] spoken and makes you feel good they
[1:43:11] never are at least for me
[1:43:14] um
[1:43:17] but i believe god's been in the heart of
[1:43:20] this message to the church
[1:43:24] we by us trying the spirit we are
[1:43:27] getting our thoughts in order
[1:43:29] and when our thoughts are in order we
[1:43:31] will better love one another
[1:43:33] when we're texting somebody when we're
[1:43:36] when we're talking on the phone
[1:43:38] when we're when we're and the worst
[1:43:40] thing you want to do is is
[1:43:43] talk to somebody face to face
[1:43:46] but inside your heart you feel different
[1:43:48] than the words that you're saying
[1:43:54] it's not the love of god amen
[1:43:57] and i tell you you can't
[1:44:01] just turn light switch on and manifest
[1:44:03] christ it takes a lot of dying out
[1:44:06] a lot of giving a surrendering
[1:44:10] and and as you're going to do that
[1:44:13] thoughts are going to come to your head
[1:44:15] and you do you got to learn to try the
[1:44:16] spirits test your thoughts
[1:44:18] before you continue thinking on them
[1:44:25] you could be wrong your opinion could be
[1:44:27] wrong about what you're thinking
[1:44:28] give it the word test quick
[1:44:32] if it's building yourself up if it's
[1:44:34] cutting somebody down get rid of it real
[1:44:36] quick
[1:44:37] i mean start you know write down a
[1:44:40] a list when you go home sometime write a
[1:44:43] list
[1:44:43] of how you can quickly check a thought
[1:44:46] with the word
[1:44:49] instead of just everything like oh i
[1:44:52] think is okay
[1:44:53] that's it's we'll never grow in that
[1:44:56] department then amen
[1:44:58] amen let's bow in prayer heavenly father
[1:45:01] we come to you
[1:45:02] lord with just as sincere hearts as we
[1:45:04] know
[1:45:05] we're so unworthy of you so unworthy
[1:45:08] of your grace of your mercy all the
[1:45:10] times lord that
[1:45:11] our thoughts have just gone off in a way
[1:45:14] that
[1:45:16] ended up not being righteous and holy
[1:45:18] and pure
[1:45:20] and and good sound thoughts from heaven
[1:45:23] above
[1:45:24] lord because we so full pride that we
[1:45:28] didn't want to try the spirit that we
[1:45:29] could be wrong
[1:45:31] lord we're asking today lord the very
[1:45:33] purpose in which you sent
[1:45:35] this message to us today that you would
[1:45:38] you would grant the fulfillment of it
[1:45:40] that we would begin to exercise
[1:45:44] these scriptures more and that we take
[1:45:46] more account and more
[1:45:48] thought into the things that we think
[1:45:51] to consider that maybe the things
[1:45:55] that we're thinking
[1:45:58] aren't from you the enemy is has slipped
[1:46:01] in there
[1:46:02] they could be as simple as thoughts that
[1:46:05] would try to
[1:46:07] down downgrade us
[1:46:10] make us feel uh it causes us to feel
[1:46:14] that you don't
[1:46:15] care about us you don't love us
[1:46:19] when you couldn't love us anymore
[1:46:26] never changed your mind and your opinion
[1:46:28] about us
[1:46:30] you you have an expected end for us but
[1:46:33] lord
[1:46:34] our flesh is so full of emotions and
[1:46:37] feelings and ups and downs and
[1:46:39] god we need you we need you we pray lord
[1:46:43] as we
[1:46:45] we practice trying the spirit
[1:46:49] god help us hold our hand open our eyes

[1:46:54] this lord that our thoughts may be more
[1:46:56] pleasing to you
[1:46:57] amen
[1:47:00] our words and our actions can be more
[1:47:02] pleasing to you

[1:47:53] place of
[1:47:54] perfection lord where when people look
[1:47:56] at our lives they could see
