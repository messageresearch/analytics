TRANSCRIPT
========================================
um so if it cuts out then I'll run over there and grab one of those mics if you'll turn with me this evening to Hebrews 11 turn it on I thought you guys already did turn it on there you go how we doing okay praise the Lord amen amen amen amen so I just want to say this I don't normally say things too much I but I certainly have appreciated brother John's messages and so it puts me in a bad place I mean I I prayed and prayed pray I came out told sister Donna Monday I says we're in trouble yes so if the Lord doesn't inspire you then you're just aurer and we never want to be just a lecturer amen we're not here to lecture we're not here to the the secret thing that goes on is that we try to give you something that you can take home and then when you're in the midst of battle my testimony won't help you that that won't help you but the word of God is forever settled in heaven and if you hear the word and hide it in your heart he's a present tense God and he's a present help in a time of trouble and his word will do all those things for you so praise the Lord enough of that Hebrews 11 we want to start with verse 13 these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country for truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is is a Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city amen let's bow our heads for a word of prayer dear Lord Jesus Lord we've sung the songs of Zion Lord father we've brought our offerings we've laid them at your feet Heavenly Father we pray that you'll receive us and that you'll come tonight father that you'll break the bread of life Lord that you'll feed us from your word you'll bless those that aren't here father those that are sick and Afflicted remember Billy Paul Lord remember brother Johnson remember brother Donnie and his daughters passed on now and remember the son-in-law and the grand children Comfort Lord Jesus sister Hope's family Lord Heavenly Father thou knowest all things we just pray that you'll just be merciful to us and gracious may you just come and be our guest tonight we love you father in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen you may be seated amen verse 15 says if indeed that they had remembered from there from whence they had came forth they would have had a season to have returned so tonight I just want to talk to you about the choice is yours we find out here that um that it says in verse 13 it says so they all died in the faith not having received the promise but they saw them a far off so they they never the thing that God had given to them they never possessed it they possessed it in faith and they but they saw it a far off and they knew that God could not lie so they they were able to chase after that amen and he said and they were persuaded of them and they embraced them the promises of God and they confess that they were strangers and pilgrims in the earth and they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country but the question in verse 15 was it says and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had an opportunity to have returned if they were mindful of where they came from they may have returned to that brother Brenham says so he says you have a choice as a Christian you have a choice of the church here in America so far that we can go to that your American privilege to choose any church that you want to belong to that's a choice you don't have to go to any of them if you don't want to but if you want to change from the Methodist to the Baptist or the Catholic to the Protestant or so forth there's nobody can tell you or make you come to any certain church that's that's our freedom that's what our democracy is every man can choose for himself freedom of religion and that's a great thing God help us to keep it as long as we can and you you have also a choice now you can choose this church you can choose whether you in this church whether you would choose a church that will guide you to your Eternal destination you can choose a church that has a certain Creed that you might think that Creed is just what you want or another church that has their Creed and then there of course there's the word of God and you have a choice of that also you have to make a choice there's an unwritten law Among Us for choosing amen so the choice tonight is yours we go forward it said here in Hebrews it said these all died in the faith they died in the faith they didn't receive some of them didn't receive the the promise that they were looking for but they embraced it anyways and if they had been mindful of where they came from if they had really had a draw on them they would have sought an opportunity to return to it right and and you tonight if you still have a mind The Choice is still yours amen amen back here in verse eight because we're going to talk about Abraham first it says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed he was called to go to a place and he was promised and we'll get into that the promise was that he would possess the land yet while he was alive he never possessed the land amen and he went out not knowing where he went and by faith he sojourned in a Land Of Promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God and you'll notice there if you flip back and you look at the end of verse 16 he says God is not ashamed to be called their God for Heath prepared for them a city amen amen so let's go back here to Genesis 11 praise the Lord amen Genesis Genesis 11 oh verse 27 it says now these are the generations of Tara Tara begat Abram nahor and Haron and Heron begat lot so this is Abraham's father and Heron died before his father Tara in the land of his Nativity and er of the cheles and Abram and nahor took them wives the name of Abraham's wife was Sarah and the name of nahor's wife milka the daughter of Heron and the father of milka and the father of isca but Sarah was Barren she had no child so they were living in the ER of the cheles they they you know they were they were people like us you know when you get old or get old but when you come to maturity and you graduate from school days are over with you you go out you get a job you try to make a way in the world you if if you so desire you go you you look for a wife Lord and and you you look to have a family you have all these desires and terara had his three sons but his one son died and they dwelt there in ER the child EES and in verse 31 it says and Tara took Abram his son and lot the son of Heron his son son and Heron was dead and Sarah his daughter-in-law his son Abram's wife and they went forth with them from ER the cheles now they left the other son in ER the cheles but they they left out of there and that to go into the land of Canaan and they came unto Heron and dwelt there and the days of Terror were 2005 years and terara died in Haron now the Lord had said on the Abram get theee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I've been pondering I've been thinking about a lot of these things lately I've been thinking if the Lord is soon to come what is it that I expect to meet when I meet God himself what is he going to be like because my imagination says he's going to look like that but is that what he's going to be like I know he saved me but have I really met the visible person of Jesus Christ so when the Lord spoke to Abram how did he do that Abram was just you know there dwelling alone with his thoughts you know maybe maybe he was just starting out as a a sheep herder and he was working and that and the but the Bible says the Lord said unto abrahamabraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee he never told him where he was going he there was no way for him to Google it to see if they had good economy there he couldn't see whether they had food there or what the jobs were like because he didn't know where he was going but the choice was his he could look at the country where he currently lived and he could consider the things that he had or he could follow this gwing thought that was in his heart of someplace else that was better that God was calling him to he says and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and when I will make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed was he talking to a man at the supermarket who was it that was talking to him because he never came and saw him until after Sarah just before the promise was going to be made and the Bible says that when he was in the The Plains of mamory and he was sitting there there was sheep herders and they saw three men come up till that time God never came to him visibly so when he said I heard the voice of the Lord what was that amen and Jehovah jari brother Brenham says notice but Abraham was just an ordinary man and he came down from Babylon and he dwelt there in the land of shinar and perhaps well and I thought this is this is a funny statement that he makes he says perhaps his diet was go in the morning pick up some berries from the bushes go back out kill an animal have his Noonday meal and some eat some more berries for supper and so forth he's just living life like brother Marty got up got your degree got a job found a place to work got up every morning started the car went to work had the boss yell at him said I won't fail that no more CU I don't like to get yelled at then you know and and brother ROM's trying to show you that Abraham was just an ordinary man but he had a choice amen he had married his half sister and her name was Sarah and while Abraham just being an ordinary man God chose Abraham by election not because he was different from from any other man but because because that God's election has to stand sure now I want you to look here at Romans 9 and I want you to think every one of us in this room tonight we are reflection of Abraham Amen in Romans 9 and verse 7 it says neither because they are the SE of Abraham are they all children okay there is nobody sitting in this room that can claim to be the Seed of Abraham we just don't have the DNA makeup we don't are they all children but in Isaac shall the seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh they are not the the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed and that's where we all come in amen and This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth so Abraham he only had God only expected one thing out of Abraham what was going to be the result of his choice was he going to consider the land where he lived at was he thinking well maybe I can follow God maybe maybe this this maybe I can make this thought or whatever this is this thing that's trouble in me that's causing me to do something it's causing me to separate me I'm going to separate from my family I'm going to separate from my Kindred and I'm going to follow this I don't I don't know what to call it this impression this inspiration I'm going to follow it and brother brandom said that was God and it was God's election Amen brother brandom went on a say he says but God called Abraham not because he was good but because God chose Abraham Jesus said you've not chosen me but I have chosen you at some point we have to believe that at some point that has to become a reality that you are not here of your own choosing amen he says I you have not chosen me but I have chosen you Jesus said no man can even come to the father or come to me except my father draws him first why are you out here tonight is because you're interested why aren't you over at a ball game is because you love God more than you love ball games and that's the reason you're here God called you and put a different desire in your heart and Abraham he's just a normal that's why we went and read the lineage and that he's just a normal common brother Keith that's what he is just a common guy but God spoke to him and when God speaks to you you have a choice are you going to follow that and you can try not to follow it but I'm telling you the way of a transgressor is hard God wins because if he elected you you're coming and that's the believer's confidence no matter whatever happens God is coming Abraham we don't know exactly how many years Abraham wrestled with that thought you know he wrestled with that thought and think about Mo this is going to this is really going to upset a lot of things if I leave my family and I take my wife and and I go and people are going to ask me they're say what are you doing well I'm quitting my job I'm I'm going over here why are you going over here well I just kind of feel that's what I should be doing and I believe God will well who is this God show me this God where is he where can I find him what house does he live in what does he look like is he black is he an Indian is he is he up is he a some guy up on top of a mountain somewhere where is this God but see Abraham couldn't show people God he could only show them what he believed and when he believed then he became what the message that was given to him that's true when the Bible said when God said to Abraham he said Abraham come and follow me go to a country that I have called you to when Abraham went and started to do that he manifested that word that was in his heart that he couldn't share with anybody he was live in it and when he lived it became a written epistle read of all men amen amen so he says God called you and put a different desire in your heart but on this election God chose Abraham not because he was an educated man not because he was a smart man but because that God saw something in Abraham before the foundation of the world and that's the reason you are a Christian tonight is because that God saw something in you before the foundation of the world and put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the world was ever formed how are you going to lose how can you do it amen amen how can you come up short if God be us who can be against us amen and yet you have a choice you can be mindful you know some people they have they struggle with that but a lot of most people that I know of that truly get saved that their family isn't a question they're they once they find God they're sold out amen they're sold out so we want to take a look at a couple examples that's just Abraham and when I was looking um through my notes and that Abraham there too many scriptures so let's let's take a look at Moses so in Hebrews 11 Paul writes about Moses and he makes this comment verse 23 he says by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraa and they were not afraid of the king's commandment you think about that do you just read it you know but amram and jabed that was his parents they were of the the lineage of Levi they were both Levi so they were they were people that had been brought up to to serve the temple but they were in a Strange Land there there was no Temple they were they were just of the tribe of Levi but yet God before the foundation of the world he had already called the tribe of Levi to be his servants to be to take care of his temple in that so how many parents were there when Moses was born that were praying for a deliverer we're praying God send us a deliverer we got we got the clock we got the calendar we got it figured out we can look at the signs today and we can say we see we're in the hour we see we're in the time Lord come quickly but we don't know what time we don't know the hour but yet we have a choice because we're born In the Flesh and our family still pulling on us if we were mindful of the country from once we came we may find opportunity to return to it because the choice is yours that choice will always be yours amen he says so by faith when he was born he was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment so it was against the law in Egypt at that time to have a male child at that time when a male child was born it was under federal government law that the midwives were to kill the male child child they were to kill all the male children that's what they had to do but here was some parents that prayed to God and somehow when Moses was born they said just think about it they spend all this time praying that God would send a deliverer they have a child and they say oh this child this is child is for the downfall of our family because we're going to have to tell the authorities or the authorities are going to find out about it and then they'll kill it and that'll break my wife's heart that'll break my heart and they hit him they hit him for three months every day thinking don't cry now because the police are going by don't don't let the neighbors know because if they if anybody finds out because my neighbor just across the street from me he had a male child and I saw the police come and kill that baby because all the Jews all lived in one area and here I am saying mine's a proper child mine's a different kind of a child that's good amen verse 24 says by faith Moses when he came to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the approach of Christ's greater riches than the treasures in Egypt yet Christ hadn't even showed up yet how could that be how could he esteem The Riches of Christ greater when Christ hadn't showed up how can you do that by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the words of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible and through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinking of blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them and by faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians ass saying to do were drowned Amen brother brandham says in spoken word his Original Seed this is really he says remember Moses was born for the work today everyone that's sitting here if you're a Christian brother brandham said God saw something in you before the foundation of the world and started to draw you to himself when his time came he started started to draw you to himself because he saw something in you Jes and then you had a choice whether the things of the world or whether your friends your family whether you would be mindful to turn back to that but brother brandom says Moses he was born for the work he had to wait on God for the extra gift for the job he had to go back and wait and for the time appointed by God a certain Pharaoh had to be on the throne and the people had to be waiting for bread of for the bread of life before God would send him back just think about that Moses so Moses's parents they put him in the ark and they took him down and they put him in the bull rushes and pushed him out in the Nile not knowing what was going to happen not knowing but believing that the voice that they heard that this is the child this is the believer what is it that draws you to the word of God people have the Bible on the I mean well nobody people don't have the Bible anymore in their living rooms or in their bedrooms if they don't even put the Gideon Bibles in the hotels anymore we we don't we don't want to offend anybody we don't want you know that's so we don't have the Bible anywhere but yet God God Drew you to his word when you read it you said something inside started to stir something inside started to do something to you and and you had a choice to make you had a choice am I going to am I going to do this or and and Moses so when Moses's parents pushed him out to sea and then he floated up the Nile and he floated right in into Pharaoh's daughter's bath house where she was taking a bath which to the carnal mind is the absolute worst place for the deliverer to go because you know that the the children of the king are going to follow the king's commandment not unless you following the Unseen God because the Unseen God did something very miraculous because he watches over his word he watches over it if that's his deliverer then he's got to bring it to pass so he takes that baby and he raises him up and in teaching on Moses brother Brenham said he said even even so much that Moses's Sister Miriam when she was there she went to Pharaoh's daughter and said do you need a wet nurse and she said yes yes I do says I got one and she went and got the mother of the baby that they had just pulled out and even if you go back and look at the scriptures and then we got to go fast cuz so even if you look at the the pharaoh's daughter said right there she looks at her servant girl she says oh look at this beautiful baby must be a Hebrew that was her own words must be a Hebrew but she says I will take him and raise him as my own wow and every night when Mama sat down and nursed that baby of hers right she said Moses you're the one you're the one when he got older she said let me tell you about your father Abraham I didn't know I had a father Abraham yes you do let me tell you about God who's god Jehovah amen he he fills all space and time amen and and Moses grew up grew up the word being placed in him being placed in him being placed in him but see that isn't how God works that's good it filled him and filled him up and and and you know Mom said you got to be good you got to follow the rules you guys because we don't bring a reproach on our God God and we want you to do good in school and he became a great General and he became a great man of authority and he was he could even teach the Egyptians and one day he got up he he got he got so he came to maturity and when he got to maturity that call that was in his heart not just words on a page because words on a page won't change your heart but there was something on the inside of Moses that God placed there amen amen and proving his word brother bam said so Moses looked out the same window that Pharaoh did he looked out the same window he saw the same people that Pharaoh looked out upon them and Pharaoh looked at them and he said you know this is a cursed people a people that had nothing but a bunch of fanaticism and they have some God and nobody's even seen it in this God dwells in the desert nobody knows where he is and these people are crazy they got all these rules and things and they they they just but when Moses looked out there he could hear his mom given the promise of God 400 years I will deliver my people with a mighty hand Moses you're the guy you're the guy Moses you're the guy and Moses Moses acted on that but he completely failed brother brandham said he completely failed he was born for the work but he had to wait for God for the extra gift to do the job am sir when he killed the Egyptian he thought for sure that the people would rejoice and say yes but they didn't they looked they had a law thou shal not murder they looked at him and said what now you going to kill us like our task Masters do and he fled he fled from Pharaoh he fled he went out into the desert and God left him in the desert with his thoughts while he sat down and thought about all the things he could have done or should have done or maybe he maybe if IID have done this it would have turned out different maybe if I'd have done that maybe if I oh if I'd only done only only brother sister he if he'd have been mindful of the country that he had come from he would have sought an occasion to go back the choice was still his but he didn't consider pharaoh he didn't consider the riches he didn't consider all the good things he had and when the right Pharaoh was in the right place and the right things were in the right place and the hearts of the people were in the right place then God came down in a pillar of fire and spoke to Moses and Moses could say now the God that I thought I heard I have now seen him face to face and whatever he says do if he says take off my shoes I'm taking my shoes off amen and he went back amen amen praise the lord they're a bunch of Fanatics they were a bunch of slaves and their God letting them be slaves proves that he's not even God what kind of a God is that what kind of a God would take the heritage of Abram the I'll bless everybody that blesses you and I'll curse anybody that curses you God took that seed that blessed seed of the promise and let them all go down into Egypt and starve and become slaves God's ways are pass finding out and then right in the midst of the whole thing he was raising up the very man God does things in such peculiar ways right up under them not a theologian not a teacher not a priest not one of their holy men but just an ordinary man born for the job amen I want you to notice that Moses when Moses saw the pillar of fire then he had a connection with God and he he had to obey that word everywhere it went he had to obey it but when he went to the Red Sea when he got the children of Israel now they saw 10 Miracles and the children of Israel when they came out with Moses and they were the Seed of Abraham because God's promise to Abraham was thy seed didn't say some of them are make Believers some of them are unbelievers he said thy seed all of them will dwell in a foreign land and after 400 years I will bring them out with a mighty hand and he brought them out with a mighty hand and when they got to the Red Sea if you go and you look at it when they got to the Red Sea the very first thing that that Collective seed said you brought us out here to die they looked right back to the country they had come from and they hadn't even been gone for two days they looked right back and they would have sought a way back but God who is great in Mercy and his grace is great he delivered them he took them not very far and when they they ran out of food they they cried and what did they do they look back to the country where they came from they said you know when we when we lived in Egypt there was a 7-Eleven on every corner and a general dollar and we could buy food we could buy bread milk we could have whatever we wanted now we're out here in the desert and you're trying to kill us they were looking back at where they came from the choice tonight is still yours that choice is yours are you looking back to where you came from or you looking towards the promise amen when they went down and they ran out of water they got to the water they they ran out of water they said Moses we need water and what did they do they looked back to where they came from they looked back they continually looked back and when they got to cadesh barnea in numbers 14 after the spies had gone over and saw the promised land and came back the children of Israel they wept all night long because they said we can't fulfill the word you can't fulfill the word but God can that's what Abraham Abraham couldn't make the world bless him Abraham couldn't own the land Abraham couldn't bring Abraham Abraham couldn't change Sarah back to have that baby he knew it Sarah knew knew it and that's why they had the Bond woman God wants you to believe the word against all circumstances he wants you to believe the promise and no matter what happens you keep walking towards that promise even if you die in faith they possess the promise amen though they couldn't see it but if you're mindful of the country where you came from the trials will get hot enough you'll leave you will leave cuz we haven't even gotten hot yet amen let's move on and take a look at Ruth amen praise the Lord amen and Ruth verse 5 it says and Maan and chillan died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband now that's a bad place to be this lady she had left Israel she had gone off off out of the promised land and her husband had died her sons had died which means she has no inheritance she has nobody to fight for her to get her inheritance because it's all under the men so now she's left by herself with her two daughters-in-law amen and she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people and giving them bread so she's pretty carnal she just wants some place to eat she wants a place to live she wants some peace in her life wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters-in-law with her and they went on their way to return into the land of Judah and Naomi said unto her daughters-in-law go return each to her mother's house the Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me Naomi is telling them take a look what you're leaving because the choice is yours go back where you know it'll be easier go back where your family is go back and the Lord grant and she even tries Naomi gives them tries to give them a blessing the Lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of your husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept so they were actually it was this was a hard decision for them and they said under her surely we will return with thee unto thy people so at the first time that she talked to them about where they had come from they all said no we're good Naomi what you told us about the promise of God we believe it we'll leave our Our World Behind we'll leave everything behind and we'll follow you and they go on a journey and after a while Naomi says to him again turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands turn again my daughters go your way for I am too old to have a husband if I should say I have hope if I should have a husband also tonight and should also bear Sons would you Terry for them till they are grown would you stay for them from having husbands nay my daughters for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me and they lifted up their voice and they wept again and Oprah kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth clave on her her Oprah considered where she came from and said you know what maybe this message is a little bit too hard for me maybe this is just a little you know you guys are a little bit too fanatical for me I think I'm going to go back where it's a little safer and she left but Ruth Ruth said no and behold thy sister-in-law is gone back under her people and unto her Gods return Thou after thy sister-in-law and Ruth said I've already made up my mind stop trying to tell me to go back ENT treat me not to leave thee nor to return from following after thee for where thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God Amen and I imagine God on his throne he's high and lifted up when he heard that testimony said who said that who said that right amen because God respected Ruth for her decision for her choice when brother Brenham was reaching Revelations chapter 5 he says now here's the four stations or the four Junctions in Ruth and Boaz the first is Ruth deciding how many ever heard me preach that message let's see your hands now well all of you I guess I've had it here and had it on tapes and so forth Ruth first she had to decide whether she was going to go into the land or not when Naomi she had to make a decision she had to make that choice not knowing what laid before her we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow we don't know what's going to happen next week we don't know we don't know amen quickly let's go over here to Matthew 4 let's take a look at some other people what choice are you going to make so I already made my choice well God will will try you on that Amen in Matthew 4 verse 18 it says Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two brothers Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for there were Fishers and he said unto them follow me and I will make you Fishers of Men and they straightway left their Nets and followed him what an what how insane is that what if you were down at Walmart and some guy just walked up to you and said hey follow me no right exactly but the the whole story isn't in Matthew we're going to look at all of them but and going on from then he saw two other brothers James the son of Zebedee and John the brother in a ship with Zebedee their father mending their Nets and he called them and they immediately left their ship and their father and followed him amen well let's see how Mark Rec records this Mark 1 verse uh 14 now after that Jesus was or John was put in PR prison Jesus came under Galilee now now here's an interesting thing John was the messenger for the hour because the scripture says that the whole city of Jerusalem and all the coast round about went out to hear John even even the king liked to Herod liked to hear John and they all went to hear John and in the midst of ter now Jesus's Ministry hadn't even started yet he had come down one day he had been baptized Jesus said behold or John said Behold the Lamb of God that take away the sin of the world and after John was thrown into prison now if you're a Believer you're going to be real careful about saying you're following John the Baptist cuz your Leader's in prison Jesus came unto Galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel amen and now as he walked by the Sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting aned into the sea for for they were Fishers and Jesus said unto them Come Ye after me and I will make to you make you to become Fishers of Men and straightway they forsook their Nets and followed him and when he had gone a little farther then he saw James the son of zebede and John his brother who were also in the ship mending their Nets and straightway he called them they left their father zebedy in the ship with the hired servants and went after him as soon as they heard the voice gone Not Looking Back amen but Luke Luke brings out something that's even better than that because you remember brother brandom said we already read the quote where brother brandham said that Moses was the man born for the job but he couldn't do the job until God gave him the extra gift to to make it work up till then he was just following amen he was just following but when he met the pillar of fire that changed him Amen in Luke 5 verse one it says and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of Ganer and he saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen had gone out of of them and were washing their Nets and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's and he prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and he taught the people out of the ship so Simon sees this guy he comes down and there's this big crowd of people and they're pressing to hear him and he says to Simon he says Simon can I borrow your boat and he goes yes he says says so push out a little ways and he sat down and he taught the people and Simon's probably sitting there men in his net but he's listening amen now when he had left speaking off he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and let out your net for a drop and Simon answering said unto him master I'm a professional fisherman I know the sign the seasons the phases of the moon I know when the fish are biting and when they are not ask brother Ry because he's a good fisherman me I don't know I mean cast and if I then go over here that's me I have toiled all night and have taken nothing nevertheless I heard something that you said and it's stirring my heart it's stiring stirring me I don't know why it's stirring me I know I I follow Jehovah I go to the temple every week I do the sacrifices I pay my arms I do all the right things he says but there's something there's something at your word I will do it and when he had done this they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break and they beckon under their Partners which are in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they begin to sink and you know who her Partners were the sons of Zebedee James and John and when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus's feet knees saying depart from me for I am a sinful man oh Lord he had changed from just a man who came to ask his boat he called called him Lord and he said the first thing when you get in the presence of God that's a problem we don't get in the presence of God when Moses got in the presence of God he couldn't speak and he was a real good speaker but when in the presence of God well I can't speak I don't he's asking about his degrees is I don't have any degrees I don't know now these people won't believe a word I said that won't do anything and God had to prove to Moses throw down your staff put your hand in your bosom and when God had proven that to Moses that this was God and it was God that was fulfilling his word then Moses went down and took over the country amen amen verse 9 says for he was astonished and all that were with him at the drought of the fishes which they had taken and so was also James and John the sons of Zebedee which were partners with Simon and Jesus said unto Simon fear not for henceforth Thou shalt catch men and when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed him if they had been mindful of the country where they came from they' have said hot dog we have hit the mother load tomorrow I'm going out fishing and God probably would have gave him fish that's true you see but they weren't mindful of the fish they were mindful of what happened they were not mindful of what they could get out of following Jesus they they saw God in flesh amen amen now I want you I want to compare this with Matthew 9 amen or Matthew 8 if we go to Matthew 8 verse 19 it says and a certain scribe came and he said unto him master I will follow thee wheresoever thou goest he had made up his mind he was he had already he recognized who Jesus was and he says I'm I'm ready to go let's go and Jesus said unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have Nest but the son of man hath not we to lay his head and that scribe took a look at the word took a look at the word being made flesh and then looked back to the country where he came from and slowly found opportunity to leave amen and another of his disciples a disciple he'd been fall on him for a little while said un him Lord suffer me first to go and bury my Father and Jesus said unto him follow me and let the dead bury their dead but the call on his family his family had such a draw on him that he turned and he went back that's a lot difference see there was something different about Peter Andrew James John barthol Thomas ma Matthew Luke there was something different about all of those people God had called them in Luke 9 praise the Lord in Luke 9 verse 23 and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what if a man it's Vantage if he gains the whole world and he loses himself or be Cast Away for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his father's and the Holy Angels amen amen let's look at one more example Mark 10 amen Mark 10 verse1 17 it says when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneel to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life he was so sure that he wanted to follow Jesus Christ he had urgency his request wasn't well I'll just wait till it's convenient that I can get and be in his presence he saw him and he ran and he showed respect he knelt down in front of him and he said Master what can I do to inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one and that is God he says Thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defend fraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said on him master all these have I observed from my youth he's a much better man than me much better I knew God didn't dwell in the Presbyterian Church I knew he wasn't there but when some people came and talked to me they said oh Bruce they told me about speaking in tongues and and this guy that was a drug dealer getting his life changed and everything else they looked at me and they said you need that and I said you know I I I believe that I believe what you said but I'm having way too much fun it's not my time but one day he passed by he passed by my Shore amen amen and Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up thy cross and follow me and he sat down and he counted the cost well he was really excited about coming to church because he ran in the doors every time the doors were open he was right there amen Lord I'm here I'm here what can I do to have eternal life but you back one thing and when he considered where he came from and what God was asking him for the price was too great and he found a way to go back brother brandham said he said that Rich Young Ruler he still stayed in church he still stayed in church fact he probably built a church probably had his name on the Pew probably did a lot of great things but he had turned down the one that could change his heart amen amen this young fellow he identified himself with his own church the price was too great so if you remember his last identification where we identified this young ruler that the opportunity to come and follow Jesus he went ahead and took his church and he went on he was a good boy said he kept the Commandments done all these good things he knew just as good as any of the rest of them so he just take that idea he rejected to follow Jesus in his last identification we find him in hell was crying to Lazarus to come and bring him some water now the warning tonight the conclusion Tonight is the last example because it's the most outstanding and that's John 21 John 21 it says and after these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of tiberias and on this wise showed he himself there were together Simon Peter and Thomas called dius and Nathaniel of Canaan in Galilee and the sons of zebon that's Jame and John and two the other his disciples and Simon Peter said unto them I go fishing yet he had admitted that he was willing to die for Christ he had admitted that nothing would ever nothing nothing could happen to me I'll follow you I'll follow he was faithful beside him for three and A2 years some of us have been faithful longer than that Amen brother brandham said he said how they were so disappointed they were so disappointed when they saw him die they didn't understand the word being manifested even though the word had been preached to them Jesus had told them from Palm Sunday he said I have to go to Jerusalem I'll be turned over to wicked men they will scorge me they will crucify me they will hang me I will die I will raise three days later amen and yet they could not comprehend that word they were just like Moses they were the word for the hour but they needed the goods to make it live because Simon Peter said unto them in verse three he says I go fishing he considered his old ways and he went back to that he went back to the country that he had come from that's where Jesus had found him now in our carnal Minds we would say oh God would be done with us but God wasn't Jesus wasn't done with him Peter might have been done but Jesus wasn't and Peter's influence was so great that all those disciples in verse two followed Peter and they went forth and they entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing but when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus so often while this is going to play out people are going to be dying in the faith not receiving the promises right brother Marty didn't receive the promise Donnie Reagan his daughter passed away then receive the promise what if Billy Paul passes away how many prophecies are people going to say oh but I thought he said I thought he said I thought this would happen I thought that would happen I thought this was going to happen if you consider the place you came from even today the choice is yours today brother Marty the choice is yours you can consider the country you came from you can say there's nothing to this nothing to it I'm going back brother renam said they were so disappointed they had went away to their fishing nets Peter said I go fishing and the disciples said well we'll just go with you and they did and they were all together tore up and disappointed there they had watched they took his body down they wrapped it in some linen they laid it in the grave and they said well that's the finish of that fanatic how the world was against him they said he was a Holy Roller he was insane he was a fanatic so forth but he said he was God he looked like him he acted like him he proved he was God that's right and Jesus said unto them children have you any meat and they answered him no and he said cast your net on the right side of the ship and you shall find I wonder if Simon even recognized his voice when he said that but when he put the fish when he put the net in there and he saw those fishes his eyes came open he came open you know he is the first one to jump out of the [Laughter] boat he jumped out of the boat and ran to him and that's the best part the choice tonight is yours oh you might get discouraged and you might decide there ain't nothing to this message but if God has elected you before the foundation of the world Jesus will have a message for you because you could say oh look Peter Peter backslid back Peter you know he blasphemed I can show you in the scriptures he said he blasphemed he cursed he said I don't know this man but God never rote him off he never rote him off even if he went back to his old ways he never rote him off because when he he came down and he ate the fish Jesus looked at him and said Peter he says I got a message for you I got some Lambs Do You Love Me Do You Love Me Above All Else tonight do you love him above all else if they close the doors do you still love me if they outlaw us do you still love me do you still love me if your family and everybody turns against you do you still love me if there's no songs there's nothing the choice is yours tonight the choice is yours amen if they were mindful of the city that they'd come out of they'd have sought an opportunity to go back I ain't going anywhere any let's bow our heads dear Lord Jesus Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your love we thank you Lord for your mercy that can't be exhausted Lord we're Sinners we're we're trapped in these bodies but Heavenly Father you place something down inside of us Lord that every time we hear the word it leaps it jumps Elizabeth said the first time she said that the name of Jesus was mentioned and it hit my ears my baby that had been dead no evidence none all the prayers nothing happened but as soon as it heard it the right time the right place the right hour it leapt amen we are looking for that day we're looking for that day for that Holy Spirit Lord it'll come one more time it'll shake the foundations of the church it'll shake the foundations of the Believers Lord Jesus and until that time we'll keep singing your Praises we'll keep worshiping you huj Lord Jesus we're looking for you to fulfill your promise because it's your word you chose us you brought us here you saved us you set us on a Solid Rock Lord Jesus take us the rest of the way we love you father we commit this service we commit these Believers we commit all of them into your hands for your safekeeping we love you father in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen
