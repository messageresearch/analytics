another our motive is to meet with Jesus and he promised to be we're just two or three are gathered together in his name and I know he's here because you brought him amen amen you brought him and we have a a bigger bomb fire now than we would just in our homes alone because there's more of us and so we can believe for great things to happen in our lives amen well God bless you this morning turn with me if you would into the book of Acts Acts chapter 20. I just want to say thank you to those that have been praying for us I know that in general you try to always pray this has been a kind of a busy week for us and uh preparing to to to leave and so I just want to say thank you for your prayers for us it makes a difference amen amen before we begin reading here let's just look to the Lord in in a word of Prayer our heavenly father we thank you Lord for this little room that we could come and gather together and to Worship You from our heart to to praise you to be with brothers and sisters who feel exactly the same way they love you and Lord we we can feel that and Lord your word declares how good it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity and Lord we have this in common that your blood makes us white as snow covers us and takes our sins and doubts and fears away it heals our bodies Our spirits and our souls and Lord we just want to praise you this morning Lord father as we about Lord to look into your word Lord only you can break the bread of life to us only you can open our eyes to see in our hearts to understand and and to see you in this word and father we want to become this word amen so we pray Lord is this as as the word Goes Forth this morning that it would find a resting place in each of us we would be able to leave here today with a part of you Lord that we didn't have when we walked in the doors Lord certainly we want our hearts to burn within us but Lord we want it to keep burning keep burning and keep burning Lord for we need you every day bless Thy word now Lord as we give you praise and honor wait furtherance on thee in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen we're going to start reading here in verse number 17 and this is when Paul is coming back uh uh from his he preached the gospel a lot and he was coming to the the Elders of Ephesus the most uh spiritual church if I could say uh and this is the message that he that he has and starting with verse number 17 I hope you have your Bibles with you amen amen and from uh maltus he sent to Ephesus and called the Elders of the church and when they were come to him he said unto them ye know from the first day that I came on into Asia after what matter I have been with you at all seasons notice he's he's the same person winter spring summer and fall serving the Lord with all humility of mine amen with many tears and temptations which he befell me which befell me by the lane and weight of the Jews and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have showed you and have taught you publicly and from house to house testifying both to the Jews and also to the Greeks repentance towards God and Faith toward the lord Jesus Christ and now behold I go Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there say that the Holy Spirit witnessed in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me well that would just kind of make me want to avoid going there but none of these things move me neither count I my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy in the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God and now behold I I know that ye all among whom and now behold I know that that ye all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more wherefore I take you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of all men in other words he said it all for I have not Shone to declare unto you all the god counsel of God take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost have made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall grieve his wolves enter in the among you and Sperry not the flock also of your own self shall men rise speak in perverse things to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn every one night and day with tears and now they're now Brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified I have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel yea yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me I have showed you all things how that Soul laboring you ought to support the weak to remember the words of Our Lord the Lord Jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all and they all wept Shore and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him souring most of all for The Words which he spake that they should see his face no more and they accompanied with him unto the ship amen I want to take our text from verse number 27 for I have not Shone to declare unto you all the counsel of God Amen God bless you may be seated this morning how many appreciate the Lord Jesus in your life man where would we be without him for a little subject we want to talk about our Tendencies to shun part of the part of the word now we're going to say some things that obviously are not for you they may be for somebody else so where the shoe fits you wear it and where it don't fit you can't wear it right right right so um we're just thankful for every part of the word that God has revealed to us and that we're living and that we're declaring that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday David forever he's alive he still lives in the heart of his people there are people that believe the gospel from cover to cover amen but we've all been guilty of shunning part of the Gospel when someone has spoken it to us amen our flesh is enmity with the spirit of the Gospel the Bible tells us it it doesn't want to die out and there's usually something that God is dealing with all of us with in our lives because it's the job of the Holy Spirit to lead and guide our character into all truth not just leading God or lives or make sure we're into the correct Doctrine but the holy spirit is leading our soul into having the proper characters that we might be in the image of God one of the greatest parts of the Gospel that a lot of men shun is when Jesus declares that a a major part of us has to leave in order to have a personal walk with him and that's basically our will amen we have got to uh basically hate or love less everybody on the planet even our own family members and and put him first or we can't be his disciple amen we we we got the Bible Jesus said even hate our own lives amen and and um we we got a bear own pick up our cross or we we can't have this personal relationship with him and yet our our life our body is always looking uh for another way to have a relationship with God and still hold on to the things that we want to but we can't make a Rapture with shunning part of the Gospel if Jesus spoke it it's required of us the Bible says that the word of God is forever settled in heaven it cannot change no more than God can change the Locust the word Jesus Christ we're taught is the same yesterday today and forever and since God cannot lie that means the word cannot lie the word can't fail Jesus can't fail it will never return void whatever God has spoken it will come to pass we can say from cover to cover this is the whole Council of God there's nothing missing in it it is given to us that we may know that we have eternal life it is given to us so we know how to live by amen amen Paul told Timothy in second Timothy that the scriptures are able to make thee wise onto salvation through faith you got to have faith and you got to believe it that all scripture is given by the inspiration of God and it is profitable we all want profit don't we you don't ever invest in something without hoping to get profit for it yes you wouldn't invest in it all scripture is given by the inspiration of God and it is profitable for a Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect right amen not a dead statue but thoroughly furnished onto all good works it's not just for us to know is for us to do good works by Jesus said for man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God it is the whole Council of God in Revelations chapter 22 verse 19 says I want you to read this with me that's why it's up on the board if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book amen we don't want to take anything away amen but that's not only it look at Verse 18 for I testify unto every man they heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add his ideas his thoughts his opinions unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book so we need to be careful about our interpretation amen our opinions and our ideas we must stay with the word and only the word it must be the word from cover to cover it is the whole counsel of God now in a world full of people's ideas what's right what's wrong what's what's wrong with this I like what our brother said I I probably made mention if I did I'm sorry but he just we we're living in a time where everything's okay but everything isn't okay but in this world where everything seems to be okay we have a word to tell us what really is okay and what is not okay the Bible says the word of God is given to us as a lamp for our feet and a light for our path Jesus said in John chapter 12 verse 46 he said I am come into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not stay as he is Amen in other words he should not abide in the darkness that he's in and any and if any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not for I came not to judge the world but to save the world that is no different than you talking to your children coming into the room and saying to them I'd like you to do your chores and if you don't do your chores that's fine but one day when I come back from vacation you're going to answer he said he in verse 48 he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words have one that judgeth him the word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day we don't have to accept the word but the word will judge us at the Judgment bar so the word comes to us with a responsibility amen we can't get rid of it whether we accept it or not we're going to be judged by it in second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 10 we're just laying a foundation this morning for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things which he's done in his body according to what you have done whether it be good or bad we can't avoid it see we're all going to the Judgment seat of Christ now the wise the wise will appear before the Judgment seat of Christ here at church now the foolish they will deflect a void and not yield to the word and they'll have to face the word at the white Throne judgment where you can't just leave and you know kind of go do what you want to do after church you won't bound to do that you will have to face the word then verse 11 knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men we persuade men because we care about other people you're not going to persuade somebody you don't honestly don't care about them I'll be honest with you but we are made manifest unto God and I trust also made manifest in your conscience so the word of God is a two-edged sword it cuts in both directions it cuts towards you and away from you in other words the word of God is for your life and it's for the life of others the sword is not just to cut the devil up event all right but it's to cut your will out of your life that God's will could be done to help others see that they're not walking in the whole Council of God knowing the terror of the lord we persuade men by using the whole counsel of God now here's the thing when you speak the word to somebody it needs to be spoken by the Holy Ghost Amen in other words speak the truth in the love of God not speak the truth in the love of a human because the love of a human has limits it can't it you know something can bother you so much that you just can't take it you're done with it you're going to just give them a piece of your mind well they need the mind of Christ they don't need your mind so you need to speak the whole counsel of God with the whole spirit of God Amen so the word of God comes with a responsibility to obey it and to help others obey it so we need to walk in the light of the word and we need to persuade other people to walk in the light of the word this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ we can't do nothing about it we can't just pick and choose what we're going to take we need the whole counsel of God amen now we live in a world of Darkness complete darkness Jesus said in John 3 19 and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and men they love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil amen for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light and neither cometh to the light lest his deed should be reproved in other words people love to stay in a place of no accountability they don't want to be accountable they want to deflect talk about anything else but don't talk about what they need to be accountable to in fact let's talk about the things that I'm doing so why do people want to stay in that place of not being accountable because they actually love that place that Darkness they love being their own head nobody telling them what to do they love the choice of Darkness rather than light verse 21 but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that is D that is these may be manifest that they are wrought of God see when we choose when somebody tells us something and we choose to walk in it it is proving that you love God it shows that you're walking with him that you love truth but when you try to deflect from it you're shunning the gospel now we're living in the very hour where people are shunning the gospel more than they ever have of course there's more darkness in the earth than there ever has been it they're shunning out of our schools our our workplaces our governments our churches Paul said now the spirit speaketh expressively that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits in doctrines of devils can you believe the devil is religious enough to have a Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall turn unto Fables people are wanting the gospel to preach the way they want it to be preached that has never been meant how the gospel should God intend the gospel to be preached never God don't cater it to anybody but God is interested in us coming under subjection from cover to covered for the whole counsel of God so if we don't want to talk about this we'll talk about that God just wants us to walk in the light [Music] we're living in perilous times Christians today are becoming more in love with pleasures love for God is slipping now despite the dark world that we're living in and despite that the love that people have for the world we have a responsibility to declare the counsel of God to them and not just part of it but all the counsel of God that is our responsibility and it's been given to us by God that is not just the church telling you this is what you need to do I'm sorry but this is what God is telling me and you to do but a lot of times we hold back from sharing part of the Gospel [Music] maybe we're afraid of rejection losing a friendship I'm not sure which shoe is going to fit you but we're going to find one maybe we're afraid of even being ridicued Fiona shame despised or looked down upon has anybody ever felt this before all right so we all got the shoes fit now we can just let that go we're always being tempted by the devil to avoid or deflect from our god-given responsibilities we've all been tempted to hold back from sharing the whole counsel of God with somebody because we're afraid of just what they're going to think right right when it comes to a personal responsibility to help others we have a tendency to shun those responsibilities like that's not my job or they don't listen to me anyways somebody besides me needs to tell them or that's really the job of the pastor can you imagine that you're so good to define the pastor's job that's pretty good that God has inspired you to know what the pastor should be doing yet you can't come under subjection to the pastor we can become too selfish like Cain avoiding or deflecting his responsibility am I My Brother's Keeper the Holy Ghost is what equips us and leads us into action to start declaring the whole Council of God and helping others we just got to get used to loving one another enough to try to help somebody yes it isn't about you just going around telling people how wrong and how bad they are but it's having such a burden for their soul a burden for their character that you just want to help them get to Christ Paul did not hold back he knew it took all the word to make it and that's why he gave all the word and he wasn't afraid to being persecuted was he wasn't afraid to be in stone or beaten with rods he wasn't he wasn't afraid about trouble every side that he turned no matter who he taught you there was going to be trouble he wasn't afraid of being perplexed or cast down that's what the scripture tells us and it didn't matter that the Holy Ghost was even witnessing in every city saying bonds and afflictions abide me Paul was always bearing about in his body the dying of the Lord Jesus he said none of these things removed me neither count I my personal life dear unto me so that I might finish my course with notice Joy Joy not oh I gotta do this but there was a joy in his heart and the ministry which I've received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God wherefore I take you to record this day I am pure from the blood of all men how do you get pure from the blood of all men you don't hold back anything you let them know everything that God has told you to tell them for I have not shown to declare unto you all the counsel or the will of God you know I understand that as soon as you step into this scripture here about declaring the whole word of God you're going to lose friendships you're really going to lose friendships and you're going to lose family members but it is the truth all right because Darkness and Light Clyde when the light turns on Darkness scatters and and if people love Darkness they're going to get out of this light so Satan is not done with the temptation of trying to offer your will to do whatever you want in this age it's the age of Rights but God has called us like he's called Paul to declare the whole Council of God amen the word shun means to withhold if you look that up to withhold under or out of sight to cower to shrink to conceal to reserve to draw back to keep back or to withdraw from to avoid evade Escape elude prevent to dodge to deflect well we got a lot of words should not be a problem understanding Paul did not withhold the truth he didn't keep back part of it because well they just couldn't take it he didn't conceal it or re reserve it neither did he cower down or Shrink from his responsibility he said for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the Council of God and I'll tell you where would you and I be today if 14 books of his letters were were not written we wouldn't know how to have church order we would not have Deacons if if it wasn't for the 14 books there would be a something missing that God wanted us to know and that's why it's in the word I'm so glad I'll tell you everyone that goes on the other that makes another side that comes up to brother random they're going to say I'm glad that you came and you gave me the word hey amen because that's the only ones that make it the ones that take all the word amen amen I thought of this letter when I was reflecting on this statement that Paul made for I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole counsel of God it was written by a young preacher in Zimbabwe Africa following his Martin for his faith in Jesus Christ he says I quote his letter verbatim and I might have read this in the past in the other Church maybe I think I did he says I'm part of the Fellowship of the unshamed I have the Holy Spirit power to die has been cast I have stepped over the line the decision has already been made I am a disciple of his I won't look back let up slow down back away or be still my past is redeemed my present makes sense my future is secure I'm finished and I'm done with low living sidewalking smooth knees colorless dreams tame Visions worldly talking cheap giving in dwarf goals I am no longer I no longer need preeminence prosperity position promotions plods or popularity I don't have to be right first tops recognized praised regarded or rewarded I now live by faith lean in his presence walked by patience and uplifted in prayer and I labor with power my face is set my gate is fast my goal is heaven my road is narrow my way is rough my companions are few my guide is reliable my mission is clear I cannot be bought compromise deterred lured away turn back deluded or delayed I will not flinch in the face of sacrifice hesitate in the presence of the enemy Ponder at the pool of popularity or mean mender at the Maze of mediocracy I Won't Give Up shut up let up until I have stayed up stored up prayed up and paid up preached up for the cause of Christ I am a disciple of Jesus I must go till he comes give till I drop preach to all know and work till he stops me and when he comes for his own he will have no problem recognizing me my bat my banner will be clear I'm a part of the Fellowship of the unshamed Paul was sold out hooked Line and Sinker we might say he wasn't ashamed of the Gospel he not only accepted his responsibilities but he welcomed it he pursued it he not only uh accepted it but he embraced it he felt in debt to his responsibility in debt to God in debt to do his will now there's a difference people don't do things if they don't a lot of times people don't do things until they feel indebted the Commandments of God are not Grievous but if you have to do something that you don't want to do it becomes Grievous and this this message just being preacher we've never believed in manipulating anybody or forcing anybody in church to do something or not to do something it is a personal relationship between you and Christ you make the decision of what you want to do and what you don't want to do but we believe the word from cover to cover and when you're sold out to that word you're in debt to the word Paul said in Romans chapter 1 verse 14 he said I am debtor both to the Greeks and to The Barbarians to the wise and to the unwise so as much as in me is I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also I just wonder are we ready to preach the word wherever we go whoever we're talking to whoever we're texting are we ready amen for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek I'm so glad for the person that came to me and shared the gospel name it because I know there's a lot of people that are ashamed and don't want to talk about it they kind of justify well God just has to deal with them yeah God has to deal with them but why don't you let God use you to lay some seeds well I'm afraid that you know they're going to think I'm strange I'm an oddball that I'm not the person who they thought I was I just say you're ashamed of the Gospel and you don't know it you've got to pick up this word pick up this sword and love their soul more than that there's so needs to mean more to you because it does to God than your personal relationship does with them Paul wasn't worried about popularity and having friendship and having more people in his church amen he was interested in their soul being in the image of Christ and it takes the whole word of God for that I don't believe he coward or shrinked verse 17 for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it written the just shall live by faith not think not know but live Hallelujah this is a gospel that is supposed to be lived amen for the raft of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness so you see the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil always has a little bit of Truth people are walking around with a little bit of Truth they're holding the truth but but in a heart that's not righteous and it's our job to give them the light come on now amen I'm not saying make an enemy out of everybody I'm just telling you declare the gospel I know that the enemy's probably not uh being favorable this message I'm I'm trusting that the holy spirit will get the word the way it is to our hearts all right verse 19 because that they which may be known of God is Manifest in them for God have showed it on to them we still need God to show them we do but let God use you let God use you to give them the word to lay that seed we ought to always be feeling in debt to God enough to go share the word with others that's why Jesus said his last commission was go yelled preach the gospel whatever I've taught you teach them from cover to cover don't don't just stop don't be lazy don't say I'm too busy I don't got time it's not my calling I just only time I got is to enough to come to church is that all you got for God said oh you love him we're running out of time what difference does it make what you get on this planet [Music] we need to win a soul it's worth more than anything you could make [Music] first Thessalonians chapter one verse 1. honestly this is this the very scriptures that this whole message came to me on Paul and silvanus and tamalthius so there's three of them here unto the Church of the Thessalonians so let's just put our name there unto the Church of Fenton Michigan which is in God the father and in the Lord Jesus Christ Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ we give thanks to God always for you all making mention of you in our prayers remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our father knowing the Brethren beloved your election of God for Our Gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you okay so now here is Paul is making this statement Paul Savannah's into mothius they had not just a word but they lived a life they had power to live the word and and it just got done describing what the word does it lives for others the greatest power that I feel we could have is the power to lay down our life to live for somebody else because it's our will that's always wanting something it isn't trying to justify what we want is okay friends that don't mean nothing the whole thing is doing God's will amen if I was out there and say Amen to that the whole thing is wanting to do God's will to win a soul that's where his his purpose is on Earth and look at this and you became followers of us notice he said us and of the Lord somebody is following you somebody is following you and you're following somebody it's the truth and ye became followers of us and of the Lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost of course if you're going to receive this word You're Gonna Lose Friends that's right if you you sisters you you when you came to the truth I'm sure you cut your hair all the time and when you come to the message and you start letting your hair grow out you will just have friends Fall Away you start wearing dresses you men stop telling jokes like you used to friends will just fall away and there's affliction but you know there's joy in the Holy Ghost so this word when it proclaimed out of your life the gospel is proclaimed out you will get people following you to Christ that's what this scripture is telling me here the fruit of you declaring the gospel is that Souls will come through your ministry amen I believe that with all my heart and look at this verse 7 so that ye were examples to all that believed in Macedonia and acchaiah so the gospel came to them they received the gospel they became Follies you know I'm going to follow Paul I'm going to follow Timothy I'm going to follow and I'm going to follow not like this wherever they go I'm going to follow their example and I'm gonna go over here and I'm going to start spreading the gospel like they did the whole Council of God look at verse 8 now for from you sounded the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia in I don't want to say that a Kaya but also in every place your faith to God word is spread abroad so that you don't there we need not to to speak of anything there's there's just things happening because of you for they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how that you turned from Idols to serve the living and the true God when you get people to turn from the things of this word world and turn to God that means you had an impact in their life and to wait for his son from Heaven whom he raised from the dead even Jesus which delivered us from the Wrath to come now I just want to talk a little bit about these examples because you know the examples are kind of close to one another Jesus did say in the last day the two Spirits would be so close and that if it were possible it deceived the very elect now we're all following someone right and behind that someone is a spiritual voice it's it's leading us if it's God it's leading us to the straight narrow and if it's not of God it's leading us to compromise it's not going to lead us to the bar it's going to lead us to compromise just Veer off a little bit and the Thessalonian Church chose to follow Paul and the Lord in the Church of Fenton has chosen to follow Paul and the Lord amen this is the gospel that is preached here and it it shall forever be preached here we as individuals choose this same gospel that's preached here or we choose to follow something compromised we either follow Paul and the Lord or we fall apart of Paul and the Lord so as an example I want to give here to kind of drive this home and it's the children of Israel they followed the prophet of that hour which was Moses and the Lord out of Egypt yes God LED them to the Red Sea and the way of the wilderness God literally LED his children by day and by night and through this whole journey he actually was teaching them how to trust him now they they didn't they didn't listen very well but he was still teaching he was still teaching them God was faithful to meet all their needs during this time even though they murmured and they complained he still gave them water and and Mana right and didn't Paul say these are the things that we should be content with amen did he say that God LED them to the promised land more than once they were truly followers of the Prophet Moses and the Lord can you say Amen to that they were followers but let's look at number 32 and see what happened at the end of them that were following number 32 verse 11. surely none of these men that came up out of Egypt from 20 years old and upward shall see the land which I swear unto Abraham and Isaac and unto Jacob because here it is because they have not holy followed me or we just went through all the ways they followed him and that was amazing they were following but they were not holy following they took part of the Gospel but they didn't take the whole gospel they shunned part of the Gospel well we know there were two there were two that proclaimed it we're more than able to take it because if you go back and you look at the reading they came back from the promise and said oh yeah it's a land that fills with milk and honey and it's it's just like it says but we know God's real we've seen the power of God but to have that life in me to where I'm sold out living for God every day just can't do that the giant want in my life is too great so I'm going to look for a spiritual I'll just say it like this a religious way to compromise I'll still go to church I'll still pay my ties but to live for others I'm afraid I'm afraid I'll lose my life that's why the children of Israel didn't want to take the promised land they were afraid they were going to lose their life if they knew that they knew that they knew that they were not going to lose their life they would have went in but they were afraid and that's why Jesus said if you don't give up your life you could gain the whole world you're still going to lose your soul I believe we're blessed God's children followed the Lord and the prophet of the hour but not completely not entirely they followed to a point but you know to a point they became ashamed they were ashamed it wasn't worth giving their all it wasn't worth surrendering everything to follow what the prophet said it wasn't even worth fighting for you know a lot of times we we read the message of the hour we listen to the tapes and we cherry pick what we're going to talk about what we're going to emphasize what we're going to say that is important when really the whole word is important the whole message is important but we need to have that that heart to want all the counsel of God to have a heart to be part of the fellowship of the unshamed I want to be with Joshua and Caleb amen look I may not be able to preached like him but I'm going to support him I'm going to live my life the better very best I can I don't know who I was telling I think I might have been telling this Brother Joseph over here I can't remember but you know I just I don't imagine Jesus being a fiery evangelistical preacher evangelist I just don't but yet it's part of the fivefold ministry he chose it to be part of it amen see what was important was the word Joshua and Caleb were attracted to the word that was the absolute for them and the bride is attracted to the word not how the word is delivered not the excitement of the word because I don't care how exciting it is you still got to go out there and deny yourself and live for others so have all the good time you want in here I'm okay with that I wouldn't want to stop it but don't let it stop at the doors and go live any way you want to live give your life and go win the soul for Jesus let that word sink down deep in your soul because that's what it's for the children of Israel who follow the prophet and who were blessed along the way never receive the original blessing that God had promised which was the Promised Land they were ashamed to follow the lord wholeheartedly Jesus said in Mark 8 38 whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words and this adulterous and sinful generation of him also amen this God who loves us shall be ashamed shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with his holy angels you know I am ashamed of my life I am ashamed of the mistakes I've made I am ashamed that I haven't taken time when the Holy Spirit whispered talk to this person I'm ashamed of that I am ashamed of myself but I am not ashamed of the Gospel it is perfect it's pure it's holy it's righteous it's correct it's right even when it tells me I'm wrong it's still right amen I'm not ashamed of that I'm not ashamed of Jesus Christ no wonder Jesus gave us good advice when he told us we need to deny ourselves because it's the only thing that stands in the way of us living the word is ourself now even though God's children follow the lord the Bible says with many of them he was not pleased the Lord's anger was kindled the Bible says against Israel and he made them to wander in the wilderness for 40 years until all the generation that had done evil in his sight of the Lord was consumed and none of the men that came out of Egypt from 20 years old and upward shall see the land which God had promised to Abraham's seed because they had not wholly followed me verse 12 save Caleb the son of June uh the Canaanite kuzanite kanzanite kensan Joshua those are the two guys right there for they they were different they holy follow the lord that's the only difference in those two verses they were all they all went to church they all were under the cloud all all experience the same thing the Bible tells us that Joshua Caleb had another spirit that Spirit Led them to follow the lord all the way amen where the spirit that the other ones had was a compromising spirit amen amen it's like a lot lot chose the easier path well to us lot is just the easier path in a city for us to go put our house towards it's the easier path that we're all tempted to take every day and this gospel is not easy it's hard but that's the calling and the bride I think accepts it because our light Affliction for a moment isn't worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in US we just got to keep our eyes on the prize and your your hardship to win One Soul you'll never regret it you'll never regret it up there you'll never say you know what I wish I would have took on another job I wish I would have got that that that third house that that new car it'll net you'll there won't be one person in heaven that says that even if you love hunting [Laughter] where brother Branham compared it just to a pig become a human would you want to go back and be a pig no matter what great things we could have down here there's nothing that can be compared to winning one soul to the Lord we have to hurry time is slipping away the children of God or the children of Israel were ashamed they were ashamed of the Gospel they were stand up they were ashamed to stand up and say like Joshua and Caleb we're more than able to take it the lamb they wanted to kind of sit back and let somebody else build the atmosphere in the church right you know I do my part you do well maybe God's calling you to do more I think Joshua and Caleb stood stuck out like a sore thumb amen who are we to say I've done my part tell me who how do you know God don't want you to do more maybe that's what we're waiting on is for you to do your part maybe maybe the children of Israel they were ashamed some of them might have been ashamed to to pay their ties maybe they were ashamed to really come to church early enough to prepare their heart because because if we can't be ashamed amen we need to take the sword and allow that sword to cut our will to follow the pattern that God sent in a prophet in this age and we need to get serious about following it and not just following the part we want to and think and call ourselves a Christian that is not a Christian a Christian will take the whole word and when you say I am taking the whole word then I know it's cutting you I say that's a Christian not a modern Christian but old-time religion that's what we need we need old-time religion so the question this morning is are we setting the example of holy following the Lord are we studying the example of just following the Lord I didn't hear one Amen on that [Laughter] we all feel like we're following the Lord but are we holy following them it's easy to say we are but are we are you are you telling this gospel to Every Soul that you can or you holding back because you're afraid to lose a relationship or because you're you don't want them to look at you kind of strange we should care more about a relationship with God than one another don't shun part of the Gospel don't shun part of the message don't be ashamed declare it take a stand we need to keep running this race and I'll tell you you need patience because you're going to get up tomorrow you've got to do it all again you're gonna have to go through it again we need to keep pressing towards the mark amen we need to be looking for the predestinated we don't know who they are right God doesn't did God ever tell anybody here who was predestinated to go to them their predestinated give them the word no he wants us to preach it to Every Creature just preach the word get it out there we didn't we need to make our church better we need to be an example here that we're holy following this message the word of God from cover to cover we need to be interested in helping those who are who are not how do I do that Brother John it starts with One Thing Called Love love I love I love God and he wants me to help them and I'm going to help them in love I am not going to correct them in my self-righteous indignation that'll do more harm than good but I am going to get down and I'm going to wash my feet washed their feet I'm going to get my hands dirty I'm going to declare unto them the whole counsel of God ye which are spiritual go to such a one in the spirit of meekness considering yourself we gotta we got a responsibility here in church and we got a responsibility outside the church we got a responsibility to one another we got a responsibility to our lives we got a responsibility to this word that we give it to somebody and if God gives you another few days to live what are you going to do with it are we going to live it for ourselves are we just going to Humble ourselves before the Lord and say God have your way with me amen let's Stand Together my my my my my I want you to know I got many scriptures but you know what you can do you can just go home and read the Bible and you'll see those scriptures you know Paul told thank you Paul told Timothy to be an example to the Believers we have such an opportunity to help one another but I'll say it like this when you come to those doors every service have a motive to help somebody amen something about God that we reap what we sow if you just put the kingdom first he just seems to bless you but if you come in with selfish Spirits just all about yourself about your life because look I'll be honest with you I I feel I have so many needs that I I don't even got time to help anybody seriously but our life isn't for ourself and our needs we're always going to have needs we're always going to have something that we want and need help with that's just the way life is but if we spend our time helping others that touches the heart of God that's missionary work and it's always in the will of God living for others May the Holy Spirit help us amen amen amen let's just go before the Lord amen let's sing that little chorus must Jesus bear the cross alone amen just try to forget everything else and just really focus on him for a few minutes as we worship Him amen must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free [Music] there's a cross forever everyone and theirs across for me yes [Music] [Music] my crown to where for theirs a crown for me [Music] upon the crystal pavement down at Jesus let's be with joy I'll cast my Golden Crown and his dear name repeat oh precious cross o glorious Crown all Resurrection Sunday ye angels from the stars come down and Bear My Soul away amen [Music] it's an honor it's an honor if Jesus was here and he said would you do this for me we would we'd gladly do it well he left us his word and it's an honor to pick up her cross and follow him amen let's sing Let Me Be A Shining Light [Music] let me be a shining love I O Lord as the world around me darkened let me be a Shining Light oh Lord give me strength for each new day my faith is found a resting place oh Lord it is in your precious words my faith is found a resting place days oh Lord May
