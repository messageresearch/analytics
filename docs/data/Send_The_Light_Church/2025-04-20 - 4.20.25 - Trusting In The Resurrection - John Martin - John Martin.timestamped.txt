[8:00] the tomb, paid bunch of people to tell a
[8:02] bunch of lies. They went off and told
[8:05] everybody, "Well, their disciples are
[8:06] going around. They're a bunch of
[8:07] cannibals. They take a bit of cut his
[8:09] toe off and here eat his toe. That's
[8:11] he's eating his flesh, drinking his
[8:13] blood." They made all kinds of stories.
[8:15] And then they said, "Oh, Mary's better
[8:17] than Jesus. If you pray to Mary, she'll
[8:19] go cuz the son will do whatever his
[8:21] mommy says.
[8:24] But I'm glad the tomb now is empty.

[8:42] Brother Orlando said he said he saw
[8:44] sister Don and I walking up in the
[8:45] parking lot. said, "You guys are
[8:47] giggling like a bunch of newslyweds." I
[8:48] said, "What? What? What's the
[8:52] problem? What is the problem? He's alive
[8:57] forever more. He's conquered death,
[8:59] hell, and the grave. Took all my sins,
[9:03] all my doubts, my fears, and I got a
[9:06] bunch. He got right here written down.
[9:11] But his blood has washed that all away."

[9:16] the Lord. Amen.

[40:03] disciples that he has risen from the
[40:05] dead, and behold, he goeth before you
[40:08] into Galilee. There shall ye see him.
[40:12] Lo, I have told you. Amen. And then
[40:15] Romans chapter 8, one verse there, verse
[40:18] number
[40:21] 11. But if the
[40:24] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[40:28] the dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[40:32] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[40:35] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[40:37] dwelleth in you. God bless you. May be
[40:42] seated. Uh the last few services we've
[40:45] been talking about trust and trying to
[40:47] build our trust in God and his word.
[40:49] This morning we want to entitle this
[40:51] message trusting in the
[40:53] resurrection. Trusting in the
[40:57] resurrection. And when we look at this
[41:00] verse in Matthew,
[41:03] um, come see the place where the Lord
[41:06] lay, go tell the disciples that he is
[41:10] risen. What does it mean to each of us
[41:13] that God is risen? Amen. It's really the
[41:16] question that I think would be good to
[41:19] to ponder. I at one time an angel said
[41:23] um that you will find the babe Jesus
[41:27] laying in a manger.
[41:29] One time Jesus was laying in a boat
[41:32] getting some
[41:33] rest. One time Jesus said, "Verily,
[41:36] verily I say unto you, before Abraham
[41:38] was, I am." Amen.
[41:41] And at one time Jesus was laying in the
[41:44] tomb and an angel said over 2,000 years
[41:47] ago, "Come see the place where the Lord
[41:50] lay."
[41:52] Today we could ask the question, "Where
[41:53] is the Lord laying now?
[41:56] Where is he at? Where is he dwelling?"
[42:00] Stephen, a deacon in the church, was
[42:04] speaking to the Sanhedrin Council in
[42:06] Acts chapter 7 verse 47.
[42:10] He was just a deacon, but he was
[42:13] speaking the truth to the Sanhedrin
[42:17] Jewish Council. And he said, "But
[42:19] Solomon built him a house. How be it,
[42:21] the Most High dwelleth not in temples
[42:23] made with hands, as sayeth the prophet.
[42:26] Heaven is my throne, and earth is my
[42:29] foottool. What house will you build me,
[42:32] sayaeth the Lord, and what is the place
[42:34] of my rest?
[42:37] Have not ma have not my hand made all
[42:39] these things?
[42:43] Amen. And then he says
[42:46] here, you stiff necked and uncircumcised
[42:50] in heart and ears, you do always resist
[42:53] the Holy Ghost, as your fathers did, so
[42:56] do ye.
[43:00] Amen.
[43:03] And I'm just wondering
[43:05] sometimes
[43:06] how how much God wants to come and rest
[43:10] inside of us.
[43:13] Wants to come and find a dwelling there
[43:15] just
[43:16] to to give rest to our
[43:20] souls. He said he would give us rest,
[43:23] but we need to labor to enter into that
[43:25] rest.
[43:27] the Holy Ghost is trying to find a rest
[43:29] or a dwelling in the heart of men. And
[43:31] Jesus is is knocking on the door to come
[43:34] in. Amen. and and and Satan, you know,
[43:38] he comes he comes to church,
[43:40] he comes every time we read the Bible,
[43:43] listen to
[43:45] tapes, he comes and he tries to provide
[43:49] us with a watered down gospel,
[43:54] that uh Christ did it all at
[43:57] Calvary, which we sing he did it all. He
[44:01] paid it all, right? it it's not by
[44:04] works. We believe that,
[44:07] but that doesn't mean that we don't have
[44:10] to die out and receive God into our
[44:12] lives.
[44:14] And so, the enemy wants us to to focus
[44:17] on what Christ has done. And and it's
[44:21] important that we do, but it's also
[44:23] important that we move on, that we trust
[44:26] in what the resurrection was all about.
[44:28] Amen. Brother Brandham said in the
[44:31] message the doctor on Dr.
[44:34] Moses, if your heart's really right
[44:37] before God and you're taught right and
[44:41] believing right and walk up there with
[44:45] assurance, something's going to happen
[44:49] because God's more willing to give you
[44:51] the Holy Ghost than you are willing to
[44:53] accept it.
[44:54] True.
[44:58] So, we know we're not waiting on God.
[45:00] That's all there is to it. The law
[45:03] having a shadow. Brother Ram says, "Now
[45:05] look, if he's so merciful to heal that
[45:07] little girl, which she has to die
[45:11] someday, this body
[45:14] um how much more is he willing to give
[45:17] you the Holy Spirit that you're
[45:19] hungering for it to let you live
[45:21] forever?" So, we see the we we see
[45:23] brother Bram's trying to show us that if
[45:25] God is willing to do that for your body,
[45:27] knowing that one day your body's going
[45:29] to die anyways. It's just a temporal
[45:31] blessing. How much more does he want to
[45:33] give you the Holy Ghost?
[45:36] Said, "Why are you standing? You know
[45:38] what I believe? 10,000 years ago, maybe
[45:41] before the foundation of the world, God
[45:43] put your name on the Lamb's Book of
[45:45] Life, and that's what's pulling on you
[45:48] tonight." He said that's what's powing
[45:50] in your heart is what he put there
[45:53] before the foundation of the world.
[45:55] That's the word of God that spoke that
[45:58] can't fail. That's right.
[46:02] Amen. End time evangelism. Brother
[46:04] Brandham says he wants to bless you. He
[46:06] He's ready. He's pressing. Can you
[46:09] imagine taking all the water in the
[46:11] earth, the seas and everything and pound
[46:15] it in one 4ft pipe and put it up there?
[46:20] He says the pressure would be on the
[46:23] bottom of it trying to find a little
[46:26] crevice to to leak its way through.
[46:30] That's like the pressure of the Holy
[46:32] Spirit trying to come down on every
[46:34] life.
[46:38] Amen. I mean, if we get a revelation of
[46:41] this right here, we can just go home. I
[46:42] mean, we could just start praising the
[46:44] Lord and say, "God, fill me because I
[46:46] know what's standing in the way."
[46:48] Imagine the amount of pressure that
[46:50] would be at the bottom of that pipe and
[46:53] the power that our will has to say, "No,
[46:55] Lord, I don't want to come in. I want my
[46:58] will."
[47:03] The resurrection will not do nothing for
[47:06] the people who do not like God in their
[47:08] heart.
[47:12] So we must we must trust the
[47:14] resurrection inside of us that God wants
[47:17] to come inside of us and do what number
[47:20] one our flesh don't want done. I
[47:21] understand that. Our flesh don't want
[47:25] him to come in and and and
[47:27] control. And you can't wait for it,
[47:30] too. Look, I'm at this age and it hasn't
[47:33] happened yet,
[47:35] right? It it hasn't. That when Jesus
[47:38] said die daily, he meant die daily. And
[47:41] there there's no shortcuts. It wasn't
[47:42] until you're 20 and then you're off the
[47:44] hook.
[47:47] And in order for God to keep working in
[47:50] our lives the way we desire him to in a
[47:52] supernatural way, we have to be willing
[47:54] to die out and let the Holy Ghost come
[47:56] in. We've seen that let the Holy Ghost
[47:59] come in.
[48:01] Province, too often people resist the
[48:02] Holy Ghost. And Stephen said, "You stiff
[48:05] necked, stiff necked." I'd hate to be in
[48:07] that sermon. And uncircumcised in heart.
[48:11] Amen. In other words, the heart never
[48:13] changed. Right. Right. And
[48:16] ears. You do always resist the Holy
[48:19] Ghost as your fathers did. So do you.
[48:21] And God knows who comes in the church
[48:24] and kind of just sits there and resist.
[48:28] Like this is not what I want to hear.
[48:31] Well, they they didn't want to hear
[48:32] Stephen either.
[1:20:57] That really was God speaking to me.
[1:21:00] And it makes you like to pay attention.
[1:21:02] Maybe that was for me. Maybe I need to.
[1:21:04] Wow, I should have been listening more.
[1:21:06] That's how we should be every service.
[1:21:10] God is calling us not to be
[1:21:13] um some pew warmer in church.
[1:21:18] He wants us to be an active bride
[1:21:20] member. Active like worshiping him in
[1:21:23] spirit and truth, hungering and
[1:21:25] thirsting for righteousness, wanting to
[1:21:27] be more like him. Who do you think God's
[1:21:29] going to pick to be his bride? I think
[1:21:31] we should listen to the to the choosing
[1:21:33] of a bride, and we'll find out what kind
[1:21:34] of bride God is looking for.
[1:21:41] Someone that's just not claiming to be
[1:21:43] the bride. Remember the other ladies in
[1:21:45] that? They were saying, "Oh, no. He's
[1:21:47] going to choose me." They all had the
[1:21:49] attitude, "Oh, I'm bright. He's choosing
[1:21:51] me."
[1:21:52] But it was that
[1:21:54] humble little
[1:22:00] lady who just did her job, didn't want
[1:22:03] to be noticed, took a back seat.
[1:22:08] God's got his eyes on us. Amen.
[1:22:11] Praise the Lord. Turn with me if you
[1:22:12] would to First Corinthians chapter 15.
[1:22:17] If the word of God doesn't re
[1:22:19] resurrect in us, how will we be
[1:22:23] resurrected? Because he's only coming
[1:22:25] back for the word.
[1:22:36] 15. I want to start with verse number
[1:22:38] one. This really all goes together
[1:22:43] today. You know, I even had some
[1:22:45] thoughts. I'm not saying they were of
[1:22:47] the Lord, but I had some thoughts that
[1:22:50] we get out of service early
[1:22:53] today. I really wanted to, but I got
[1:22:56] like half my notes to go yet. And I I
[1:22:58] had half to start with. Amen.
[1:23:02] Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you
[1:23:06] the gospel which I preached unto you,
[1:23:09] which also you did receive, and wherein
[1:23:11] you do stand. And by the way, you are
[1:23:13] saved. By which also you are saved, if
[1:23:18] if you keep in memory what I preached
[1:23:21] unto you, unless you have believed in
[1:23:23] vain. That's the word.
[1:23:27] For I delivered unto you first of all
[1:23:29] that which I also received. How that
[1:23:31] Christ died for our sins according to
[1:23:33] the
[1:23:34] scriptures. And that he was buried and
[1:23:36] he rose again the third day according to
[1:23:38] the
[1:23:39] scriptures. And that he was seen of
[1:23:41] Cphus then of the 12. After that he was
[1:23:44] seen above the 500 brethren at once of
[1:23:48] whom the greater part remained unto this
[1:23:51] present. But some are fallen asleep.
[1:23:53] After that he was seen of James. Then of
[1:23:56] all the
[1:23:58] apostles, at last of all he was seen of
[1:24:01] me also, as a one born out of due
[1:24:05] season, due time. For I am the least of
[1:24:08] the apostles, but I am not me to be
[1:24:11] called an apostle, because I persecuted
[1:24:14] the church of
[1:24:16] God. But by the grace of God, I am what
[1:24:18] I am. And his grace which was bestowed
[1:24:21] upon me was not in vain, but I labored
[1:24:26] more abundantly than they
[1:24:29] all. Yet not I, but it was the grace of
[1:24:33] God which was uh with me. Therefore,
[1:24:36] whether it is were I or they, so we
[1:24:39] preach, and so we believe. Now if Christ
[1:24:43] is preached that he rose from the dead,
[1:24:47] how say some among you that there is no
[1:24:50] resurrection of the
[1:24:53] dead? Now he is speaking of the actual
[1:24:57] resurrection. But I want you I want this
[1:25:01] scripture to be to each of you
[1:25:02] individually. I want you to ask the
[1:25:04] question because Christ should be
[1:25:07] resurrected in our lives. Amen.
[1:25:11] Now if Christ is preached that he rose
[1:25:14] from the
[1:25:15] dead, how say some among you that there
[1:25:18] is no resurrection of the I I don't want
[1:25:22] some of our lives to say that he hasn't
[1:25:24] resurrected in us.
[1:25:27] But if there be no resurrection of the
[1:25:28] dead, then Christ is not risen inside of
[1:25:32] us. And if Christ be not risen in us,
[1:25:34] then is our preaching vain? And your
[1:25:36] faith is also vain. Amen. Yay. We have
[1:25:40] found false uh we are false found false
[1:25:42] witnesses of God because we have
[1:25:45] testified of God that he has risen
[1:25:47] raised up Christ whom he raised not up.
[1:25:50] If so that the dead rise night not. For
[1:25:55] if the dead rise not then is not Christ
[1:25:58] risen? Uh then is not Christ risen. And
[1:26:01] if Christ be not raised your faith is in
[1:26:04] vain. Ye are yet in your sins. and they
[1:26:09] also which are fallen asleep in Christ
[1:26:11] are
[1:26:13] perished. If if in this life only we
[1:26:17] have hope in Christ, we are of all men
[1:26:21] most
[1:26:27] miserable. Now I want to say this. How
[1:26:29] many has accepted Jesus
[1:26:32] Christ? How many has accepted Jesus
[1:26:34] Christ as your savior?
[1:26:39] I want to ask this
[1:26:41] question. Is this enough?
[1:26:55] Brother said in the message, God's
[1:26:57] provided way. He says, "Now remember,
[1:26:59] you just accepted Christ. Now God will
[1:27:01] give you the Holy Ghost in confirmation
[1:27:03] of your faith." Yes.
[1:27:06] In the message, God perfecting his right
[1:27:09] says, "But God gave Abraham the seal of
[1:27:13] circumcision as a confirmation that he
[1:27:15] received his faith." The Bible said
[1:27:17] today that we're sealed into his kingdom
[1:27:19] by the Holy Ghost, and if you say you
[1:27:22] believe and God hasn't given you the
[1:27:25] Holy Ghost,
[1:27:26] he hasn't confirmed that he's even
[1:27:29] received your faith yet. Amen.
[1:27:34] I think we're doing the the right thing
[1:27:38] by accepting Christ into our life,
[1:27:40] making a public confession, get
[1:27:45] baptized, but I believe that we should
[1:27:47] continue on seeking the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:50] Amen. And be active in it. Not have to
[1:27:53] be pushed to go in the prayer room. Not
[1:27:56] to be pushed to come to the altar. not
[1:27:58] being pushed to be dedicate your some
[1:28:01] time in your homes and and fast and and
[1:28:04] get into the message and get filled with
[1:28:06] the word and and get a better attitude
[1:28:09] and and become more humble and more
[1:28:11] reverent before God in the church.
[1:28:15] Should be real.
[1:28:18] It should be more real to us.
[1:28:22] Romans 8:10. And if Christ be in you,
[1:28:24] Romans 8:10, and if Christ be in
[1:28:28] you, the body is dead
[1:28:31] because of
[1:28:33] sin. But the spirit is life because of
[1:28:37] righteousness. But if the spirit of him
[1:28:39] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:28:41] in
[1:28:43] you, then he that raised up Christ is
[1:28:45] going to do the same thing to you.
[1:28:50] And this is the scripture that we need
[1:28:52] to like
[1:28:53] Post on her refrigerator. Post on her
[1:28:56] visor. Post on her mirror in our
[1:28:58] bedroom. Post it. Post it. Post it till
[1:29:01] we become challenged.
[1:29:05] And when we become challenged, then
[1:29:08] we'll begin seeking what we need to do
[1:29:10] to get more of the Holy Ghost. Because
[1:29:13] this this body needs to be quickened
[1:29:15] right here. Amen. I want to be
[1:29:17] quickened. I want to love like God
[1:29:20] loves. I want to forgive like God
[1:29:21] forgives.
[1:29:23] I want to have joy in the middle of my
[1:29:25] trials. I I don't want to be just having
[1:29:28] joy when I at certain times. Amen. But
[1:29:32] all times,
[1:29:34] I I I I want to I want to be merciful.
[1:29:38] I want to be longsuffering. I want to be
[1:29:40] gentle and and meek and and and and
[1:29:43] temperant. Yes. And I want I want the
[1:29:46] life of Christ.
[1:29:49] And that comes only by the life of
[1:29:51] Christ. Amen.
[1:29:55] And and we're going to be put through
[1:29:56] the test, too.
[1:29:58] Now, now, now the thing is, I would
[1:30:01] never, not a person in here, I would
[1:30:03] ever say that you don't have the Holy
[1:30:06] Ghost. I would never say that. I would
[1:30:09] never say that.
[1:30:14] But if I can convince you to seek more
[1:30:16] of God, you'll never regret it. Amen.
[1:30:20] You'll never regret it.
[1:30:26] Look at verse 12 here. Therefore,
[1:30:28] brethren, we are debtors, not to the
[1:30:31] flesh, to live after the flesh.
[1:30:36] We're a debtor one way or the other.
[1:30:38] We're either a debt to the flesh and
[1:30:41] we're going to just do what our flesh
[1:30:42] wants to do or we're a debtor to God to
[1:30:46] live for God to do to let the spirit of
[1:30:48] God have its way inside our life.
[1:30:52] Brother Brandham said in the message
[1:30:53] Abraham he said he give the Holy Spirit
[1:30:55] for action. Yes. For service. He give
[1:31:00] the Holy Ghost for action. For service.
[1:31:04] Amen.
[1:31:05] If our lives are not serving the body,
[1:31:09] we're not reaching out for a new soul.
[1:31:12] Absolutely.
[1:31:14] I I question what spirit you're saying
[1:31:17] you have. Amen. Because Hebrews 13:8
[1:31:22] says that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:31:23] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.
[1:31:28] Just as Jesus was after the 12 disciples
[1:31:32] got the Holy Ghost, they started doing
[1:31:34] the same thing.
[1:31:36] And Paul came later, Saul came later, he
[1:31:40] started doing the same thing.
[1:31:42] And everybody's got the Holy Ghost since
[1:31:44] then is doing the same thing. Amen. Now,
[1:31:48] if we come short of that, I I just say
[1:31:51] like this. We need either be quickened.
[1:31:53] We need a a a time with God to get back
[1:31:55] on the track or we got to come to grips
[1:31:58] that maybe I don't got enough Holy Ghost
[1:32:01] because God set the Holy Ghost for a
[1:32:03] purpose. Amen. In the
[1:32:06] message
[1:32:07] um the great warrior and we're finishing
[1:32:10] up. He says you say, "Well, I'm a
[1:32:12] believer." Well, if God's never given
[1:32:14] you the Holy Ghost, you're not a
[1:32:16] believer yet. That's true.
[1:32:20] See, I could never say that you don't
[1:32:23] got the Holy Ghost, but I didn't say the
[1:32:25] prophet couldn't say it.
[1:32:28] That's right. For God's under obligation
[1:32:32] to give you the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:34] When he said, "Repent, be baptized in
[1:32:36] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:32:38] remission of your sins, and you shall
[1:32:39] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost,"
[1:32:40] God's under obligation to do it.
[1:32:44] For it's to who? The apostles. No sir.
[1:32:47] Peter said it's for you and your
[1:32:50] children and them that are far off, even
[1:32:53] as many as the Lord our God shall call.
[1:32:55] Amen. So no matter how far it is, it's
[1:32:58] for every believer.
[1:33:01] Oh, theologians smear and putty over
[1:33:03] that.
[1:33:06] And and that don't make any difference
[1:33:08] because she's she's sprouting up
[1:33:10] everywhere now. And I'm so happy for the
[1:33:13] Lord Jesus and for his people.
[1:33:17] All right, just two more quick two more
[1:33:19] quick quotes here in the message
[1:33:21] approaching to God. The approach to God,
[1:33:23] brother Brand says, "De out to self."
[1:33:27] Come through the blood of Christ. Amen.
[1:33:30] Then you can approach the father and he
[1:33:31] will give you the Holy Spirit.
[1:33:35] That will make you a believer.
[1:33:38] Because if it's not, that's because it's
[1:33:42] not you that's believing anymore. It's
[1:33:43] the Holy Spirit in you and your nature's
[1:33:48] changed
[1:33:50] in the mar in the message marriage of
[1:33:52] the lamb brother says and then if you
[1:33:55] haven't received the Holy
[1:33:57] Ghost pray God give you the Holy Ghost
[1:34:00] and fill you and make you a member of
[1:34:04] the bride.
[1:34:05] Remember by one spirit we're all
[1:34:07] baptized into the body. We need the Holy
[1:34:10] Ghost. Let's stand together. God bless
[1:34:11] you.
[1:34:19] So the the good news was there's good
[1:34:22] news and bad news. The good news
[1:34:26] was we were able to get through all the
[1:34:28] notes. Amen. The bad news
[1:34:31] is it went the whole hour.
[1:34:35] We weren't able to get out sooner. I was
[1:34:37] really hoping that I wanted to do
[1:34:39] something for the church, right? I
[1:34:40] wanted to
[1:34:43] just I believe the Lord is
[1:34:46] pleased
[1:34:47] in the message getting across that we
[1:34:50] need more
[1:34:53] just God wants
[1:34:55] to feel more loved and
[1:34:59] desired. And I'll just say like this,
[1:35:02] whatever God has spoken to
[1:35:04] you, you you're the only one that can
[1:35:06] make the difference.
[1:35:09] you you take the word get serious with I
[1:35:12] know you'll never regret
[1:35:14] it and I understand that maybe you tried
[1:35:16] in the past and you didn't get what you
[1:35:18] were looking
[1:35:21] for but that only means that God wants
[1:35:24] you to continue on whatever reason that
[1:35:27] he has
[1:35:29] but don't give up don't stop short you
[1:35:32] keep believing keep seeking you got
[1:35:34] breath keep doing it because obviously
[1:35:37] we justen many people have have gone on.
[1:35:40] We only got a all of us only got a
[1:35:42] certain amount of time that we have
[1:35:44] left.
[1:35:45] And I don't think we can get a enough
[1:35:48] Holy Ghost. Uh uh
[1:35:53] but I believe we can get to a place of
[1:35:54] complacency and we just we want to stay
[1:35:57] stay away from that. Amen. Let's bow our
[1:36:02] hearts in in a word of prayer. I wonder
[1:36:04] if there would be anyone here today that
[1:36:05] says, "Brother
[1:36:07] John, I want to make a commitment today.
[1:36:10] And I believe with my heart is strong
[1:36:12] enough, sincere enough. I want to make a
[1:36:14] a commitment to seek more of the Holy
[1:36:17] Spirit in my life, this resurrected
[1:36:20] power. And I want you to pray with me
[1:36:23] that I would receive more of this." God
[1:36:25] bless these hands. Amen. Almost just all
[1:36:29] the hands, almost all the hands are
[1:36:31] raised here today. God, God I believe is
[1:36:35] pleased with all of our hearts. Amen.
[1:36:37] Heavenly Father, we come to you with
[1:36:40] sincerity. We thank you for your bride
[1:36:43] here, Lord. They have received the
[1:36:47] message
[1:36:49] today. They want to
[1:36:52] trust in all that this resurrection has
[1:36:56] for them.
[1:36:59] And Lord, as they have put this this
[1:37:03] foot forward in their heart, as your
[1:37:07] word says, "Draw nigh to me, I'll draw
[1:37:09] nigh to
[1:37:10] you." Lord, I pray that you would meet
[1:37:14] them. And Lord, that you would give to
[1:37:17] them doublefold as they would give to
[1:37:19] you just because you're such a good God.
[1:37:23] It would be so encouraging, Lord, that
[1:37:26] whatever effort, Lord, that they would
[1:37:28] put forth, that you would just double it
[1:37:30] back to them. Yes. And that Lord would
[1:37:33] encourage them to to do a little bit
[1:37:35] more and that that relationship could
[1:37:39] just
[1:37:40] grow and that power could be more
[1:37:43] manifested. And Lord, we want to be
[1:37:45] filled with so much power that it
[1:37:47] wouldn't matter what you would want us
[1:37:49] to do, we would just be willing to do
[1:37:50] it. Amen.
[1:37:53] we wouldn't have to worry about any of
[1:37:56] the pressures of this
[1:37:57] life, but we would just follow
[1:38:01] you. Please bless us, Lord, as we seek
[1:38:04] to become more like you and to have our
[1:38:06] nature more like
[1:38:08] you, Lord. We're holding on to this
[1:38:10] scripture. We're holding on to the
[1:38:14] promise that same power that resurrected
[1:38:19] you from the
[1:38:21] tomb. It's going to quicken our mortal
[1:38:23] bodies, too. Amen. We're going to be
[1:38:26] changed in the twinkling of an
[1:38:29] eye. We're going to fly away one
[1:38:32] day. This
[1:38:36] um mortality is going to put on
[1:38:38] immortality.
[1:38:42] Lord, we're trusting you and we're we're
[1:38:45] praising you, Lord, for your promise
[1:38:48] today. We pray these things and thank
[1:38:51] you for these things now in Jesus
[1:38:53] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's
