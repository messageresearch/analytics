[23:46] alarm. Though tempest may blow and the
[23:50] storm clouds arise, obscuring the
[23:53] brightness of
[23:55] life, I'm never alarmed at the overcast

[24:38] alarm. I know that he safely will carry
[24:42] me through no matter what evil
[24:46] be. Why should I then
[24:49] worry? This may blow if Jesus walks
[24:53] close to my side.

[25:32] earth some sweet day. Our trials will

[26:23] Everything else will fall. It'll fail.

[26:29] right. Because Jesus said he prayed for
[26:31] it.
[26:34] Amen. So cards are all stacked in
[26:36] stacked in our favor.

[38:16] was my daughter Ann. She just said it'd
[38:20] be just nice to hear
[38:23] uh something on this. And so, she's the
[38:26] one that kind of inspired this a couple
[38:29] weeks ago. Before we begin reading,
[38:32] let's just ask the author to help us
[38:35] today. Heavenly Father, we come to you,
[38:38] Lord, with open hearts. We've emptied
[38:43] out by your grace. Lord, your blood has
[38:46] covered
[38:46] us. We stand here
[38:49] washed. Now, Lord, we need to be filled
[38:52] with you.
[38:54] And we know, Lord, that the enemy is out
[38:58] to get us, but you're out to see us
[39:01] through.
[39:03] We pray that this time that would be
[39:05] taken would be used to equip us to be
[39:10] able to face the enemy, to recognize
[39:13] him. And I ask that you would bless
[39:15] every brother, every sister here, those
[39:18] that are watching in the live stream,
[39:21] Lord, that we might be better equipped
[39:24] that we might be able to uh with our
[39:28] lives serve you and not be distracted or
[39:30] hindered by the enemy.
[39:33] Bless your people. We ask that you would
[39:35] accompany thy word with revelation to
[39:38] our hearts. We'll be ever grateful for
[39:40] these things. we humbly pray in Jesus
[39:43] precious name. Amen. Amen. Amen. 2
[39:47] Corinthians chapter 2 starting with
[39:48] verse number
[39:52] five. But if any have caused
[39:56] grief, he have not grieved me, but in
[40:00] part that I may not overcharge you all.
[40:05] Just bear with me. sufficient to such a
[40:08] man is this
[40:10] punishment which was inflicted of
[40:13] many. So that contrite ye ought rather
[40:17] to forgive him and to comfort him, lest
[40:20] perhaps such a one should be swallowed
[40:23] up
[40:25] with over much sorrow. Wherefore I
[40:29] beseech you that you would confirm your
[40:31] love toward him. For to this end also
[40:35] did I write that I might know the proof
[40:37] of you. Whether you be obedient in all
[40:40] things. To whom you forgive anything, I
[40:44] forgive also. Amen. For if I forgive
[40:46] anything, to whom I forgive it, for your
[40:49] sake forgive I it in the person of
[40:54] Christ. So when you forgive anybody,
[40:57] that is you're standing as Christ would
[41:00] inside of you. That's right. That's how
[41:03] powerful Christ is. But if you don't
[41:05] forgive, that's not Christ. Are you with
[41:08] me?
[41:11] Lest Satan should get an advantage of
[41:14] us, for we are not ignorant of his
[41:18] devices.
[41:19] God bless you. May be
[41:22] seated. Well, according to Revelations
[41:25] 12:9, we know that there was a great war
[41:28] in heaven. And the the Bible says the
[41:30] great dragon was cast out, the old
[41:32] serpent called the devil and Satan,
[41:35] which
[41:36] deceiveth the whole world. He was cast
[41:39] out into the earth, and his angels were
[41:41] cast out with them. And if the whole
[41:44] earth or the whole world is deceived,
[41:47] then they're also lost. That's right.
[41:50] They're
[41:52] lost. 2 Corinthians 4:3, we're just
[41:54] laying a foundation here. 2 Corinthians
[41:56] 4:3 says, "But if our gospel be hid,
[41:59] it's hid to them that are lost, in whom
[42:02] the God of this world has blinded the
[42:06] minds of them which believe not in their
[42:09] hearts, lest the light of the glorious
[42:12] gospel of Christ should who's in the
[42:13] image of God should shine upon them."
[42:16] So, we notice that this battle that went
[42:18] on in heaven, the angel and the devil,
[42:20] they were they were cast out. They went
[42:22] on the earth and all of a sudden their
[42:24] job is to deceive the whole
[42:26] world and it happens in the minds of
[42:29] people.
[42:31] And so we're talking about the Satan's
[42:34] strategies and and how he uses the
[42:36] devices. It it happens in our minds. A
[42:40] lot of times when we think about the
[42:41] problems that we have in life, it's with
[42:43] our boss, it's with a family member,
[42:45] it's with a neighbor, it's with somebody
[42:47] in the church, it's uh the
[42:50] government, it's my it's my
[42:54] doctor. It and and and we don't realize
[42:58] that the battle is in our mind. Amen.
[43:02] Now the dictionary definition of device
[43:04] is a plan, a method, a means, a tactic
[43:11] or a trick with a particular aim to
[43:14] accomplish something, a device,
[43:17] something that is used to get something
[43:19] an end result.
[43:21] Satan has a lot of them. in the Greek
[43:25] here that we just read the scripture out
[43:26] of uh Satan's devices are all if you
[43:29] look it up they're in our minds just
[43:32] what it says in the Greek it's in our
[43:35] minds in our thought in our intellect in
[43:38] our perception of things this is where
[43:40] the devices are at so when we look and
[43:43] we got problems everywhere in life we
[43:45] got problems with people I am sorry you
[43:49] are not looking at Satan's devices there
[43:52] Satan's devices places are in your own
[43:54] mind. They're not in the mind of others.
[43:57] That's right.
[43:59] You know, brother Brandon makes this
[44:00] statement, Satan can't do anything
[44:01] except he's got somebody to work
[44:03] through. And if he can get me to think
[44:06] something about you,
[44:09] he's got me.
[44:11] So the the see the key is to not let the
[44:14] devil have his his control here.
[44:18] I got to be aware of Satan inside my
[44:21] mind. In the message, how can I
[44:25] overcome? Brother Brandon said, overcome
[44:27] means to recognize the devil in every
[44:30] one of his tricks.
[44:33] We were always aware when the devil was
[44:36] speaking to our minds, then we would be
[44:37] able to overcome and say, "No, we're not
[44:39] doing
[44:40] that. I know I know he hit me. I know
[44:44] she she hit me. I know she she said this
[44:47] against me. I know
[44:49] that, but I'm not allowing the
[44:54] devil to mess up my mind because of what
[44:57] happened. Therefore, I'm going to turn
[44:59] the cheek. I'm going to give a soft
[45:00] answer. I I'm I'm going to approach this
[45:04] with the mind of Christ. God did not
[45:07] call me to uh rightly divide the evil
[45:10] that's coming out from other people
[45:12] around me.
[45:14] He just called me to be Christ. Amen.
[45:20] less Satan should get the advantage of
[45:23] us for we are not ignorant of his
[45:26] devices. And the message the contest
[45:28] brother Brandham says now this con this
[45:30] great contest has been going on for many
[45:32] years. It started in heaven and Satan
[45:34] was kicked out into the earth and then
[45:36] he became an enemy to God's people and
[45:39] since then he used all his strength and
[45:41] his strategy to pull God's people across
[45:45] the fires or into his fires. Amen. So we
[45:50] see his strategy is to keep us from
[45:53] heaven.
[45:56] I don't know how many times I've heard
[45:57] this. If you if you just born and die,
[46:00] you're head you're going to hell.
[46:02] you're heading right towards the fires
[46:04] without doing anything because what
[46:07] we're doing is we're fighting against
[46:09] the devil who says you're okay the way
[46:11] you are. It's a strategy. It's a device
[46:13] of Satan when we need to realize, humble
[46:16] ourselves that our nature must be
[46:17] changed. We must come into the nature of
[46:19] Jesus Christ in order to escape. Amen.
[46:23] We can't just say some words, I I'm
[46:27] sorry, get baptized and say I'm saved.
[46:29] It doesn't work like that. A nature has
[46:31] to be changed. We're born into the body
[46:33] by the spirit of Jesus Christ and it
[46:35] must be manifest in our life. 2
[46:38] Corinthians chapter 10 tells us, "For
[46:40] though we walk in the flesh, I just want
[46:42] you to think about your natural life
[46:44] now. For though we walk in the flesh, we
[46:46] do not war after flesh." Think about the
[46:48] last time that you battled with
[46:50] somebody. Now, in all honesty, you
[46:52] shouldn't have to look that far ago,
[46:54] right? I mean, it happened just
[46:56] recently.
[46:57] For though walk in the flesh, we do not
[46:59] war after the flesh. For the weapons of
[47:01] our warfare, they're not
[47:04] carnal, but they're mighty through God
[47:06] to the pulling down of strongholds. Yes.
[47:10] Now, this is all happening inside of us,
[47:14] casting down imaginations and every high
[47:16] thing that exaltth itself against the
[47:18] knowledge of God, and bringing into
[47:20] captivity every thought to the obedience
[47:24] of Christ. What is what are what is what
[47:26] is the scripture telling us here? The
[47:27] scripture is telling us that every
[47:28] thought that we have that comes into our
[47:30] head is not of God. That's what that's
[47:33] telling us. But for some reason, when we
[47:35] function during the day, every man seems
[47:37] right in his own eyes. This is the way I
[47:39] think. This is the way I see it. This is
[47:40] the way it is. And he's not humble
[47:42] enough to say, "I could be wrong in what
[47:43] I'm thinking."
[47:47] We don't do that. How you going to cast
[47:48] it down?
[47:50] casting down imaginations every high
[47:52] thing that exaltth itself against the
[47:54] knowledge of God and bring into a
[47:57] captivity every thought until it comes
[48:00] to the be the obedience of Christ. Now
[48:04] you know what people allow thoughts to
[48:09] be whatever they're going to be. As long
[48:12] as I don't say them, I don't tell them,
[48:13] I don't have to worry about them. But
[48:15] the scripture is telling us that we need
[48:18] to bring our thought in obedience to the
[48:21] word.
[48:23] So we do have a responsibility with our
[48:25] thoughts.
[48:26] Even though we keep them from one
[48:27] another, we still have an obedience to
[48:30] the word with that thought.
[48:32] And so we should think that our thoughts
[48:35] need to be right with God. And having in
[48:38] a readiness to revenge all disobedience
[48:40] when your obedience is fulfilled. Notice
[48:44] this is it's no longer me fighting
[48:46] against Bob. It's not me having a
[48:49] problem with Bob. The battle is inside
[48:52] of me.
[48:54] So all of Satan's devices start in our
[48:57] mind because the decisions are made in
[49:00] the mind. And we've heard this before.
[49:03] Satan will like to get uh I'm going to
[49:07] take um James here right now because
[49:10] he's close to me. I think I can start to
[49:13] pick on him a little bit. It's going to
[49:15] be okay now. I've trained
[49:17] him. But if I got a problem, if I see
[49:20] something I don't like about James and I
[49:22] start, you know, James, I just I I just
[49:25] I don't like it when you do that. And he
[49:27] says, "Well, it's I can do that if I
[49:29] want to." And and he keeps doing it and
[49:31] I don't like it. Well, Satan just sits
[49:34] back and says, "I accomplished what I
[49:35] wanted to." They're just they're they're
[49:38] just going at it.
[49:42] See, but it's not James.
[49:44] It's the devil telling me that you need
[49:46] to deal with this like this
[49:50] in the message, the unity of God in the
[49:53] one church. Brother Brandham says in the
[49:55] Garden of Eden, it proved that the devil
[49:57] chose the head of man to work in, but
[50:00] God chose his heart.
[50:04] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, day
[50:06] forever. Brother Brandon says in the
[50:07] Garden of Eden, Satan chose his part of
[50:09] man, his head, his
[50:11] intellect, but God took his heart. But
[50:15] see, your heart, your faith will make
[50:17] you believe things in your mind that
[50:20] knows nothing about it. Amen. So, you
[50:23] cast down the reasonings by faith. You
[50:26] cast it down. No matter if he spits in
[50:29] your face, no matter what he says, what
[50:31] she does, no matter what happens, no
[50:34] matter what the eyes, the mind sees, the
[50:38] heart says, I will stay with the word.
[50:41] Stay with the word. See, you must be
[50:44] positive. You must stay there until you
[50:46] are positive. Then when you're positive,
[50:48] then there's nothing that can turn you.
[50:52] Now you're talking about stability. a
[50:55] mind. That's why the Bible says a
[50:56] double-minded man is unstable and knows
[50:58] all his ways because there's he no
[51:01] matter if he's standing with the truth
[51:03] at one
[51:04] moment something else can come into his
[51:06] mind and he's over here. So you can't
[51:09] depend on it. Imagine that you depended
[51:12] on your
[51:13] mail but you never knew if the mail was
[51:15] going to
[51:17] come. Sometimes it did, sometimes it
[51:20] didn't. Sometimes you you you go to the
[51:22] doctor and your appointment. Sometimes
[51:24] he's there. He says, "Oh, yeah. I I I
[51:27] just took the day off. I mean, this this
[51:30] would be good to upset people.
[51:33] So God wants to see stability. The only
[51:36] thing that's really stable in this world
[51:37] is God. Yes. The only thing that's
[51:39] stable is God. And if you want to become
[51:41] more stable, become more God.
[51:44] That's good, right? It's not you. It's
[51:48] God in you that makes you unstleness is
[51:51] the devil in you." Amen. That's right.
[51:55] In the greatest battle ever fought,
[51:56] brother Brandham said with this great
[51:58] battle started on earth. There had to be
[52:00] a mutual meeting place. There had to be
[52:03] a place selected for the battle to begin
[52:05] and for the battle to rage. And the
[52:08] battleground begins in the human mind.
[52:11] Notice it begins
[52:13] there. There is where the battle starts.
[52:16] The human mind was chosen for the battle
[52:19] place where it begins. And that is
[52:21] because that decisions are made in the
[52:24] mind, the head.
[52:26] So if you got a problem with somebody,
[52:28] you got a problem with the church, you
[52:29] got a problem with the pastor, pastor,
[52:31] you got a problem with some of the
[52:33] people in the church. I am telling you,
[52:36] the battle is here. It's not with
[52:38] people. And the quicker we can get that,
[52:41] the quicker we can start attacking the
[52:43] devil that's inside of us rather than
[52:45] the people that's around us.
[52:51] If the devil can convince me that I that
[52:54] that Bob is really doing bad and
[52:58] irritating
[53:00] me, then I'm going to make a decision to
[53:03] stand against him when I should be
[53:06] making a decision to help him.
[53:09] Right?
[53:11] All right. So he said, "Brother says,"
[53:14] he says, "Where you where you got to
[53:16] meet the enemy is in your
[53:18] mind, not with somebody else you're
[53:21] talking to. You meet the enemy in your
[53:23] mind." Well, I don't got a problem with
[53:24] my mind, Brother John. Yes, you do.
[53:29] The problem is in your mind. It isn't
[53:30] with the person you're talking to. We've
[53:33] got to get that straight.
[53:36] You've got to make the choice. It meets
[53:39] you. And he says, "I want this little
[53:42] girl here who's very sick to be sure to
[53:44] listen now to this real closely."
[53:47] Decisions are made in the mind, the
[53:50] head. This is where Satan meets you
[53:53] because God made it that way. So if we
[53:56] want healing, we want deliverance, we
[53:58] want we want God's promises, we we need
[54:00] to have a mind that stays positive upon
[54:03] the word.
[54:05] Not just I believe here, I believe in
[54:08] God here, but we let our mind be
[54:09] negative. it doesn't work.
[54:13] Now, we've heard this the statement,
[54:14] ignorance is blessed.
[54:19] But ignorance is not blessed.
[54:22] Not recognizing the devil in your mind
[54:24] and your thoughts will never make you an
[54:26] overcomer.
[54:29] James 4:1 says, "From when once comes
[54:31] wars and fightings among you, come they
[54:33] not hence of your own lust?" And that
[54:35] war in your members is a question. Don't
[54:38] you don't you recognize what's going on
[54:40] inside of you? James 1:14, "But every
[54:44] man is tempted when he's drawn away of
[54:45] his own lust and enticed. It has nothing
[54:48] to do with the other people."
[54:50] Don't blame what's on the radio. Don't
[54:52] blame the government. Don't blame
[54:54] because they didn't bring you the right
[54:55] food. It's nothing to do out there. The
[54:57] battle is here. Amen. Ignorance is not
[55:01] blessed.
[55:02] We've got to recognize the devil in our
[55:04] minds, in our thoughts in order to
[55:07] overcome. Amen. So, we need to pull down
[55:10] the strongholds.
[55:12] Pull them down right here. You know, a
[55:14] lot of times we want to pull other
[55:15] people down.
[55:17] Pull the strongholds down in us. Strong
[55:21] thoughts that are bothering us. That's
[55:23] what a strong a strong There are bother.
[55:26] I just can't get this off my mind. Pull
[55:28] it down. Amen. God has given you the
[55:30] ability to pull it down. Cast down
[55:33] imaginations. Cast them down.
[55:36] Just I mean, go cast it down.
[55:40] I was almost going to do that with a
[55:42] bottle of water, but I knew that
[55:43] wouldn't work real good.
[55:45] But you got to you got to be serious
[55:47] with the devil because if you play with
[55:49] him, you're going down. So, you got to
[55:52] cast down imaginations. Satan has the
[55:55] ability to present to our minds
[55:58] something that don't exist.
[56:00] Come on. How many times How many times
[56:03] has somebody said something to you and
[56:05] you thought they meant this but it was
[56:07] really that? True, right? And because
[56:11] you thought it was that, you got mad at
[56:13] them.
[56:14] It's very true. He has the ability to to
[56:18] make your mind think things that are not
[56:21] real. And why does he do that? because
[56:23] he's trying to get you so messed up, to
[56:26] get you off track so he can conquer and
[56:29] divide because Christ is not around a
[56:31] nature that's vicious.
[56:35] So, we got to cast down prideful
[56:37] thoughts. I'm right. We got to cast down
[56:40] lazy thoughts. I don't have to, selfish
[56:43] thoughts, hateful thoughts, uncaring
[56:47] thoughts,
[56:49] entitlement thoughts. Yeah, there's so
[56:52] many thoughts that we need to be aware
[56:54] of in our mind.
[56:56] You know, too often we look at other
[56:58] people as they are the problem.
[57:02] I have yet to have people come to me and
[57:04] say, you know, I got a real problem with
[57:06] myself.
[57:10] But that's where the problem is. And you
[57:11] got to spend all this time trying to
[57:13] convince them where the real problem is.
[57:14] And they say, "You just don't
[57:16] understand.
[57:17] You just don't understand what I'm going
[57:19] through.
[57:21] I think is we're not recognizing the
[57:22] enemy in our mind.
[57:25] Every high thing that exaltth itself
[57:28] against the knowledge of God and bring
[57:29] it into captivity, every thought to the
[57:31] obedience of Christ. Why? Because
[57:33] decisions are made in the mind.
[57:37] Decisions are made in the mind. And I'll
[57:39] tell
[57:41] you, we certainly would not want to take
[57:46] Reese and put him in
[57:50] charge of the entire uh we entire
[57:55] Michigan. He's in charge of
[57:59] everything. He's not quite equipped
[58:04] yet. We certainly wouldn't want to give
[58:06] an adult who's got
[58:09] a lot of
[58:11] smarts, maybe can handle be being uh uh
[58:16] a a mayor or something like that. But
[58:19] yet in his mind, he's so here, there,
[58:23] everywhere. He's spinning. There's no
[58:26] you don't even know. You can't trust
[58:27] what he's going to do in the next 10
[58:28] minutes
[58:30] because there's there's nothing there to
[58:33] control.
[58:36] I'm telling you this this this message
[58:38] is so important in the aspect that we
[58:40] need to gain greater control in
[58:42] happening what's happening in our mind.
[58:44] We just need to decisions because a a a
[58:47] decision being made from somebody that
[58:49] is all over the place is going to be
[58:51] like a a like a landmine going off.
[58:55] But if you could just be
[58:59] settled established in your
[59:02] mind is there. You know what to do with
[59:04] every thought that comes in. Then you
[59:06] can make the right decisions. Then you
[59:08] can overcome. Yes. Then you can move
[59:11] forward. Amen. Brother Bon says this is
[59:14] where we meet Satan is in our mind.
[59:19] So next time you got a problem with
[59:21] somebody, remember the problem is
[59:24] happening in your mind. I understand you
[59:28] got problems with people. I understand
[59:30] that. that is that's not the problem
[59:32] that you should be thinking about,
[59:37] right? Because persecution is going to
[59:38] come, affliction's going to come, all
[59:40] that's going to come. You can't do away
[59:42] with it. That's the way God made it.
[59:45] But what we need to be focusing on is
[59:46] what's being spoken to our mind
[59:49] because that is where we can be an
[59:52] overcomer. We may be we can't stop. Hey,
[59:55] look, could anybody stop the things that
[59:57] were happening in the world?
[1:00:01] You can't stop necessarily other people.
[1:00:04] The focus needs to be how you handle it,
[1:00:08] how you view it,
[1:00:10] what does the word say you should do in
[1:00:12] this
[1:00:13] situation. Does the word say that you
[1:00:15] should do this or do
[1:00:17] that and and and you got to care enough
[1:00:20] to even try to investigate that, right?
[1:00:24] You you can't it's not going to be
[1:00:25] handed to you. I mean, remember the last
[1:00:28] time that you had a a real problem with
[1:00:31] somebody, a real problem? I mean, they
[1:00:33] were yelling at you and they just
[1:00:36] stopped in the middle of yelling at you
[1:00:37] and said, "Oh, can I help
[1:00:40] you?" No, they don't care about helping
[1:00:43] you right now. They're upset at you. So,
[1:00:45] you're not going to get help from the
[1:00:47] person that you are looking at is your
[1:00:51] enemy at this moment.
[1:00:54] But that's just a disguise.
[1:00:57] Their real problem is happening right
[1:00:58] here.
[1:01:01] So what do I do in this
[1:01:03] situation?
[1:01:05] Well, number one, don't let the devil
[1:01:07] have his way in your mind.
[1:01:10] Let the Holy Ghost
[1:01:12] in. Satan's devices are released in our
[1:01:17] mind. They're released.
[1:01:21] He has a strategy to get us away from
[1:01:25] obeying the will of
[1:01:28] God. Now, you know, you got some problem
[1:01:31] and it may seem real minor and it has
[1:01:34] nothing to do with your salvation, but
[1:01:36] the fact that he's trying to get your
[1:01:38] nature not to be the nature of
[1:01:41] Christ, this is his strategy. Because
[1:01:44] you notice this, when you get upset
[1:01:46] about something, all of a sudden you
[1:01:48] don't feel like trying about doing
[1:01:49] anything,
[1:01:51] right? Because it affects your affects
[1:01:53] your your mindset. You've let the enemy
[1:01:55] in and before you know it, you don't
[1:01:57] even care anymore.
[1:02:00] And you know what you're going to say?
[1:02:01] It's all because of you. You did it. You
[1:02:04] made me do this. Right?
[1:02:11] Often Satan wants us to think that we're
[1:02:14] fighting against other people, against
[1:02:15] flesh and blood. Ephesians 6:12 tells
[1:02:18] us, "For we wrestle not against flesh
[1:02:20] and blood, but against principalities,
[1:02:22] against powers, against the rulers of
[1:02:24] darkness of this world, against
[1:02:25] spiritual wickedness in high places." So
[1:02:29] we must recognize the devil in our minds
[1:02:31] more and more and just cast down the
[1:02:34] reasoning. Cast down the imaginations.
[1:02:36] Cast down every thought that wants us to
[1:02:39] think that we got a problem with
[1:02:40] somebody. I'm I I I this is the way I
[1:02:43] like I like to look at it. If this
[1:02:45] person acting like a devil, I just like
[1:02:47] to say in my mind and he's acting like a
[1:02:50] devil. That's it. But don't you realize
[1:02:53] what he said toward you? I know what he
[1:02:54] said towards me. The devil's always
[1:02:57] accusing me. I don't care who. He uses a
[1:02:59] lot of people. He uses a lot of people
[1:03:01] to accuse me.
[1:03:03] It's still the devil.
[1:03:05] Still the devil. The devil anointing
[1:03:08] people to attack.
[1:03:14] But that doesn't give us a right to
[1:03:16] attack them.
[1:03:18] And if we do, we're just a pawn. We're
[1:03:20] just we we we ju just a
[1:03:23] pawn. So we're not fighting against
[1:03:26] people. We're fighting against spirits.
[1:03:28] And the more that we understand this,
[1:03:30] the more spiritual we can be when we're
[1:03:32] in a
[1:03:32] situation. Verse 13 says, "Wherefore
[1:03:35] take upon you the whole armor of God
[1:03:37] that you may be able to withstand in the
[1:03:39] evil day, having done all to stand." Put
[1:03:42] on the whole armor of God. Verse 11
[1:03:44] says, "Put on the whole armor of God
[1:03:46] that you may be able to stand against
[1:03:49] the ws of the devil." Amen. Now, notice
[1:03:53] this this great chapter about putting on
[1:03:55] the armor of God. It isn't there telling
[1:03:57] you this is how you talk to somebody
[1:03:58] that's being mean to you,
[1:04:02] right? It's not that kind of counseling.
[1:04:04] What it is is it's everything is on the
[1:04:06] in it's for the inside man because the
[1:04:09] battle is on the inside. It's the
[1:04:10] spirit. You're you're battling in the
[1:04:12] spiritual realm. You're not battling in
[1:04:14] the flesh. The thing is if you if you
[1:04:17] allow that spirit to come out of your
[1:04:19] flesh, then you're starting to battle in
[1:04:21] the flesh.
[1:04:25] But how are we put on the whole armor of
[1:04:27] God? We try our
[1:04:30] thoughts. We recognize that the devil is
[1:04:33] trying to confuse us to tr he's trying
[1:04:36] to get us bothered. He's trying to get
[1:04:38] us upset. He's trying to get us off
[1:04:39] track. He's trying to get us to doubt
[1:04:41] God. He's trying to get us to get so
[1:04:43] distracted involved with other things
[1:04:45] that we just don't recognize the it's
[1:04:48] the devil in us. Amen. I hate to say
[1:04:50] this. You know, we don't like to think
[1:04:52] the devil is in us.
[1:04:55] We're such a vessel of God. You know, I
[1:04:58] got the Holy Ghost. Yes, but we can get
[1:05:00] the devil in our mind.
[1:05:03] How do we know it? Just look at how you
[1:05:04] act. That ain't God. You can say you got
[1:05:08] God, but it'd be better to manifest you
[1:05:10] got God. You understand? In order to do
[1:05:13] that, then you've got to have control up
[1:05:15] here. You got to have the mind of Christ
[1:05:18] here.
[1:05:19] You got to battle spiritually here.
[1:05:21] Amen.
[1:05:25] And our opening scripture, one of
[1:05:27] Satan's devices is to get people not to
[1:05:30] completely forgive others. That's what
[1:05:32] our opening scripture is.
[1:05:35] This starts in our mind. Thoughts come
[1:05:36] into our mind about others. Well, they
[1:05:38] did this to me. They made me feel like
[1:05:40] this. This is what their intent was. He
[1:05:42] says a lot of stuff. Well, I'm not, you
[1:05:45] know, I'm not going to let that happen.
[1:05:46] I'm not going to, you know, I've been
[1:05:47] hurt too many
[1:05:49] times. And the devil gets in there and
[1:05:52] he makes gives you a reason why not to
[1:05:56] forgive somebody from your heart.
[1:06:01] Cuz he
[1:06:02] knows God will not forgive
[1:06:06] you. He knows God will not forgive you
[1:06:09] if you don't forgive others. Right? If
[1:06:12] you Jesus said, "If you forgive not men
[1:06:14] their trespasses trespasses, neither
[1:06:17] will your father forgive your
[1:06:19] trespasses." Right? To the point he says
[1:06:22] seven time.
[1:06:26] So his whole thing about you feeling bad
[1:06:30] or ill towards what somebody did to
[1:06:33] you is
[1:06:35] not
[1:06:37] about it. It's not about proving to you
[1:06:42] that this person is so bad, right? That
[1:06:45] he's not worthy of your grace and mercy.
[1:06:47] It's not
[1:06:48] that. The devil wants to poison you.
[1:06:53] With
[1:06:55] ill with with when you don't forgive
[1:06:57] somebody, you know what you're doing?
[1:06:58] You're putting yourself above that
[1:07:00] person. Amen. And God says, "You think
[1:07:02] I'm going to allow you into this kingdom
[1:07:05] of mine when I forgave you and you can't
[1:07:08] forgive somebody who's done much less to
[1:07:10] you than what you've done to me?"
[1:07:15] It's like we we operate like carnal
[1:07:18] carnal, right? It needs to be seven
[1:07:20] times 70. It doesn't matter. You did it.
[1:07:22] Forgive you. Just move on. Act like it
[1:07:26] didn't happen. Don't sit there and say,
[1:07:28] "Well, you know, I'm not gonna forget
[1:07:30] this.
[1:07:32] You've did it to me. You've did it to me
[1:07:34] now seven times."
[1:07:37] Come and tell me somebody's done it
[1:07:40] seven 491 times and then I I'll listen
[1:07:45] to you because I don't have scripture
[1:07:48] for that one. But I got the spirit in
[1:07:50] which Christ is speaking to me. 7* 70.
[1:07:53] is just have the same spirit of Christ
[1:07:57] always forgive. He's still forgiving us
[1:07:59] every day, but we get so used to it
[1:08:02] entitlement. Oh yeah, God, cover me with
[1:08:04] your blood. Forgive me. Yeah, we just go
[1:08:06] on.
[1:08:08] Take the blood for granted.
[1:08:11] Never feeling, God, I need to do better.
[1:08:14] I need to serve you better. I need to
[1:08:17] try harder. I need to love that brother.
[1:08:18] I need to love that sister. I need to
[1:08:20] reach out. That is I need to give back
[1:08:23] to the church how much the church has
[1:08:25] given to me. I need to pray for the
[1:08:26] church how much the church has prayed
[1:08:28] for me. We're so selfish.
[1:08:32] And all happens in our head.
[1:08:36] We don't recognize the
[1:08:38] enemy. It's part of Satan's strategy to
[1:08:41] provide believers with a reason to hold
[1:08:44] something against somebody.
[1:08:49] But with God, there's no respect to
[1:08:51] persons. The Bible says, "We've all
[1:08:53] sinned, come short of the glory of God."
[1:08:55] 1 John 1:8 says, "If we say we have no
[1:08:59] sin, we deceive our own self, and the
[1:09:03] truth is not in us." Verse 10, "If we
[1:09:06] say that we have not sinned, we make God
[1:09:09] a liar, and his word is not in us.
[1:09:15] But if we confess our sins, he is
[1:09:16] faithful and just to forgive us of our
[1:09:18] sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:09:20] unrighteousness.
[1:09:23] I think we just need to recognize that
[1:09:25] we're human.
[1:09:28] We have battles up here and we lose
[1:09:30] them.
[1:09:32] And then if we're not careful, see,
[1:09:34] brother man said like this, the battle
[1:09:36] starts here. But where's the devil
[1:09:37] trying to get?
[1:09:39] He's trying to get you to get ill in
[1:09:41] your heart. But see, the love of God
[1:09:43] thinkketh no evil. It doesn't think ill
[1:09:47] of its neighbor.
[1:09:49] It it it it automatically if Christ is
[1:09:53] in the heart, it's just going to I
[1:09:54] forgive you. Let's go. Let's go forward
[1:09:58] together. Oh, you know, Brother John,
[1:10:00] it's not that easy. It's not that easy
[1:10:02] because the Holy Ghost is not where it
[1:10:04] needs to be. You think God struggles
[1:10:07] with unforgiveness?
[1:10:10] It's real clear. If you confess, he will
[1:10:12] forgive you. He's a faithful and just
[1:10:15] God.
[1:10:18] But if you choose, if you choose to hold
[1:10:22] things against people, then don't expect
[1:10:24] me to change my word for you because I
[1:10:26] don't love you more than my word. His
[1:10:29] word is first.
[1:10:33] God is no respector of persons.
[1:10:38] So, Satan will always provide us logical
[1:10:41] reasons to get
[1:10:43] us not to forgive
[1:10:46] somebody. And that's just a
[1:10:50] device, a strategy that he
[1:10:54] uses because he's never going to come to
[1:10:57] you and say, "You know what? If you just
[1:10:58] if you if you would just uh please hold
[1:11:02] something against Bob, just hold
[1:11:04] something against him. And I just want
[1:11:06] you to know when you're doing it, you
[1:11:07] know, God is not going to forgive you.
[1:11:08] He's never going to tell you that. He's
[1:11:10] just going to give you a reason why not
[1:11:13] why not to love and help Bob
[1:11:17] and say, "You know what? You're better
[1:11:18] than
[1:11:19] him. You're better than Bob. You know,
[1:11:23] you would never do that to Bob. Bob is
[1:11:25] bad. He's a bad boy."
[1:11:30] And then you think, "Yeah, I am pretty
[1:11:31] good. I would never lower myself to do
[1:11:33] that.
[1:11:35] and you're all puffed up. You know,
[1:11:36] that's just a device of Satan. It's a
[1:11:38] religious spirit. The Pharisees had it.
[1:11:41] Amen. And you can see it a mile away.
[1:11:43] You don't even have to hear somebody's
[1:11:45] word. You can see it right on their
[1:11:46] body. Oh, brother John. Yes. I'm saying
[1:11:50] it because it's the truth. Just because
[1:11:51] I never tell you doesn't mean I don't
[1:11:53] see it.
[1:11:55] You know, we're written epistles, right?
[1:11:56] Of all men. The way we act, the way we
[1:11:59] behave, the way we respond about things.
[1:12:01] What about our faithfulness? It all
[1:12:03] declares where we're standing with the
[1:12:05] word.
[1:12:10] We want to uncover Satan's
[1:12:13] devices. For a moment, let's just take a
[1:12:16] a root for an
[1:12:18] example. This has got some
[1:12:21] history. This came from a
[1:12:24] plant that
[1:12:27] um Cheryl had given her mom back in 79.
[1:12:32] is a rubber tree and it it had grown
[1:12:36] whatever the eight foot many times hit
[1:12:38] the ceiling and then it would get
[1:12:40] trimmed
[1:12:41] and a part of it would is is now today
[1:12:44] in Texas with Elizabeth. A part of it is
[1:12:47] went to Pennsylvania. U a part of it is
[1:12:52] um in Jackson and we got parts of that
[1:12:54] plant all over. And you've ever taken a
[1:12:58] a a plant and cut a leaf off of it and
[1:13:02] stick it in water and you start to grow
[1:13:04] roots. Yes. Okay. You you take those
[1:13:06] roots, they get good enough and you
[1:13:07] stick it in dirt and I'll tell you, get
[1:13:09] a plant. This is just another plant from
[1:13:12] that one plant in 79. And it started
[1:13:15] with just some roots. That shows you the
[1:13:17] power that can be inside of a root.
[1:13:24] Powerful. Amen. Satan has the ability to
[1:13:28] just take one little grudge
[1:13:31] and cause it to grow into so many
[1:13:33] different problems,
[1:13:35] one little thing, and before long you'll
[1:13:39] develop ill against somebody and it'll
[1:13:42] just stay there every time you see them,
[1:13:44] every time you think of them, every time
[1:13:46] his name is brought up, it'll just be
[1:13:48] there
[1:13:49] and it can linger and become a stigma
[1:13:52] and affect the way that you view things,
[1:13:57] right? Because the Bible tells us if we
[1:13:59] got hatred in the heart, we're blind. We
[1:14:00] can't see straight. But you know what?
[1:14:02] It can also affect those that are around
[1:14:04] you. Amen.
[1:14:06] I read one time that a corrupt soul
[1:14:09] affects all its neighborhood.
[1:14:14] Hebrews 12:14, "Follow
[1:14:17] peace with all men and holiness, without
[1:14:22] which no man shall see the Lord. And
[1:14:25] this word follow, it means to pursue. It
[1:14:28] means to press towards. It doesn't mean
[1:14:32] to. You're going this way and all of a
[1:14:34] sudden peace. Oh, oh, I'm supposed to go
[1:14:36] that way. No, you keep your eyes on it.
[1:14:38] You pursue it. You press into it. You
[1:14:41] follow it. Peace means a lot to you
[1:14:45] because it means a lot to God.
[1:14:49] For some people, the only way they get
[1:14:51] peace is if somebody makes it for them
[1:14:54] and says, "Here, I'll do this for you.
[1:14:56] I'll get underneath you.
[1:14:59] I'll do all the work. You be happy now."
[1:15:03] It's the only time they have peace. They
[1:15:05] don't know how to make it. But blessed
[1:15:07] are the peacemakers.
[1:15:09] For they shall be called the children of
[1:15:11] God. There is something to make peace.
[1:15:13] It takes work. It does.
[1:15:16] You take something that is not going
[1:15:18] good and you make it peaceful.
[1:15:23] Too many people don't care to even
[1:15:25] pursue peace with certain individuals.
[1:15:29] Want to add that
[1:15:31] because it's the old respect a person
[1:15:32] thing.
[1:15:34] But in all thy ways please the Lord.
[1:15:36] He'll even make thy enemies to be at
[1:15:37] peace with you, right? Follow peace with
[1:15:40] all men in holiness without without
[1:15:43] which no man shall see the Lord. Verse
[1:15:45] 15, looking diligently, lest any man
[1:15:49] fail of the grace of God, lest any root
[1:15:53] of
[1:15:54] bitterness spring
[1:15:56] up and trouble you and thereby many be
[1:16:02] defiled.
[1:16:05] So, I brought this plan in because I
[1:16:07] want you to realize that your little
[1:16:09] little uh thing that you're so bothered,
[1:16:13] been bothered with about somebody isn't
[1:16:16] doing much harm, but it's doing a lot of
[1:16:18] harm. Yes. That springing up, it means
[1:16:21] puffed up and
[1:16:23] germinated. Trouble. Anybody ever
[1:16:25] trouble you? That means annoy you. Yeah,
[1:16:27] we've been annoyed. and thereby many be
[1:16:31] defiled or contaminated just by what's
[1:16:34] inside of you. You don't only
[1:16:36] contaminate yourself, you contaminate
[1:16:38] others around you just by allowing a one
[1:16:42] rote of bitterness. Amen. It has the
[1:16:45] ability to grow. That's what we don't
[1:16:47] realize. We got this one thought in our
[1:16:49] mind and we think it's not a big deal. I
[1:16:51] got problems with so many people. It's
[1:16:52] just not. You know
[1:16:55] what? If you want to have joy in your
[1:16:58] heart, you got to get the devil out.
[1:17:03] Right? I'm gonna tell you, the Holy
[1:17:04] Ghost is joy.
[1:17:07] It's joy. It's love. It's joy. It's
[1:17:10] peace.
[1:17:12] When you got God, you don't got that
[1:17:14] other garbage. Don't tell me you got God
[1:17:17] and you got that garbage. It don't work
[1:17:19] like that. I don't care what you say,
[1:17:20] how much you believe it. It's a lie
[1:17:23] because it's not the word. It's one
[1:17:26] thing to to fall. It's one thing to make
[1:17:28] mistakes. But you stay down there and
[1:17:30] keep that spirit. You don't got the Holy
[1:17:32] Ghost.
[1:17:38] This gospel is to bring us up higher,
[1:17:41] not to give us a cloak so we can make it
[1:17:43] to heaven and do what we want to do.
[1:17:47] Look
[1:17:48] diligently. Look diligently
[1:17:50] inside. Make sure there's nothing there.
[1:17:53] a little little bitty
[1:17:56] root. It has the
[1:18:00] ability to do great
[1:18:02] damage to your home, to your church, to
[1:18:05] your
[1:18:10] workplace, to the guy or girl in the
[1:18:12] drive-thru window when you get the food.
[1:18:18] You didn't give me what I wanted.
[1:18:22] Ever walk away and you didn't get what
[1:18:24] you wanted? All of us have.
[1:18:27] I'm going back up the line.
[1:18:29] [Music]
[1:18:31] I paid. I'm
[1:18:36] busy. Somebody run you off the road or
[1:18:38] just kind of cut in front of you. I've
[1:18:40] had Why don't you just lay the horn on
[1:18:42] them?
[1:18:47] Little grudges are just a device of
[1:18:50] Satan.
[1:18:52] It's Satan's strategy to get us to to
[1:18:54] have a grudge and and keep it there long
[1:18:56] enough to it germinates and becomes a
[1:18:58] stigma that every time we see them, we
[1:19:00] think of what happened.
[1:19:03] That is not the Holy Ghost. That is not
[1:19:05] a bedding ground that tells me the Holy
[1:19:07] Ghost is reigning there.
[1:19:12] And I don't want to make the Holy Ghost
[1:19:14] or Christians something that the Bible
[1:19:16] says it's not.
[1:19:18] I'd rather bring my thoughts under
[1:19:20] subjection to the word instead of well,
[1:19:24] you know, this is a little bit different
[1:19:26] story.
[1:19:30] 1 Peter 5'8, be sober, be
[1:19:32] vigilant, because your adversary, the
[1:19:35] devil, is a royal lion, walketh about
[1:19:36] seeking whom he may
[1:19:39] devour. You know, another device,
[1:19:41] there's a lot of devices. We're not
[1:19:43] going to be able to get through
[1:19:44] everything, but here's a big one.
[1:19:46] Overconfidence is a device of Satan. Oh
[1:19:48] yeah, that's true. If the devil can get
[1:19:51] you overconfident, then you'll miss out
[1:19:54] on having more of God's grace. Right?
[1:19:56] Because he resists the proud. He gives
[1:19:58] more grace to the humble.
[1:20:01] Matthew 7:22, many shall say to me in
[1:20:03] that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
[1:20:06] prophesied in your name? In thy name
[1:20:08] cast out devils, and in thy name did
[1:20:10] many wonderful works. I mean, these men
[1:20:12] were confident. These women and men,
[1:20:14] these believers, these churchgoers, they
[1:20:16] were confident. They used the power of
[1:20:18] God. It worked right through their
[1:20:19] hands, through their mouth. They laid
[1:20:21] hands on people. They their mouth was
[1:20:23] used by God. And they were so
[1:20:28] confident. They were overconfident.
[1:20:33] Overconfident. He says, "Then will I
[1:20:35] profess to them, I never knew you.
[1:20:37] Depart from me, ye that work iniquity."
[1:20:40] Overconfidence is a device of Satan. He
[1:20:44] wants you to be confident when you
[1:20:46] should be saying working out your own
[1:20:48] salvation with fear and trembling.
[1:20:54] The church of Leodysia is overconfident
[1:20:57] because thou sayest, I am rich increased
[1:20:59] with goods and have need of nothing.
[1:21:03] Need of nothing. You know that is
[1:21:05] a you know you know how often I see that
[1:21:09] spirit in need of nothing. When you try
[1:21:12] to help somebody when you try to tell
[1:21:15] them what they need to do this is the
[1:21:18] this is what the word says
[1:21:21] and they say no thank you.
[1:21:28] That's saying in need of nothing because
[1:21:30] Jesus is not talking about natural
[1:21:32] things because you're increased with
[1:21:33] good, you're rich. He's not talking
[1:21:35] about the natural. He's talking about
[1:21:36] the spiritual.
[1:21:39] We get so filled our minds with the
[1:21:41] natural life that we live in that we're
[1:21:42] just spiritually blind. We're we're
[1:21:44] naked. We're wretched. We're miserable
[1:21:46] inside. There's no joy. There's no
[1:21:48] peace. We don't want to live for
[1:21:52] others. And we don't even see what's
[1:21:54] going on.
[1:21:58] overconfident, a
[1:22:00] device of
[1:22:04] Satan. Philippians chapter 3:12. I love
[1:22:07] Paul because Paul was a man who had just
[1:22:10] about everything. Had so much that God
[1:22:12] had to give him a little thorn in the
[1:22:14] flesh kind of keep him in his place.
[1:22:18] But I love his spirit. I love the spirit
[1:22:20] of Paul.
[1:22:24] Verse 12, Philippians 3:12. Not as
[1:22:27] though I've already attained. He wasn't
[1:22:29] overconfident. Either was already
[1:22:31] perfect, but I follow after. I pursue.
[1:22:35] If that I may apprehend that which also
[1:22:38] of also I am apprehended Jesus Christ.
[1:22:41] He's apprehended me, but I want to
[1:22:42] apprehend him like he's apprehended me.
[1:22:46] Brethren, I do not count myself as
[1:22:49] apprehended.
[1:22:52] But this one thing I
[1:22:54] do, I forget all my great victories that
[1:22:56] I had in the past that make me feel
[1:22:58] overconfident.
[1:23:01] And I reach for those things that I
[1:23:02] don't have yet.
[1:23:04] In other words, I want to come to the
[1:23:06] statue of a perfect man. I want to come
[1:23:08] in the image of Christ. I've been
[1:23:09] predestinated to be in the image of
[1:23:12] Christ, and I'm pressing towards that.
[1:23:14] See, the spirit is not about look at
[1:23:17] what I got. The spirit is about what I
[1:23:20] need to get.
[1:23:24] God gives you another day. He gives you
[1:23:26] another day to to be what he wants you
[1:23:29] to be to do what he wants you to do.
[1:23:34] He said, "I press toward the mark for
[1:23:37] the prize of the high calling of God in
[1:23:39] Christ Jesus." And then he says, "Let us
[1:23:41] therefore as many as many be perfect
[1:23:45] have the same
[1:23:46] mind. And if anything be otherwise,
[1:23:49] minded God shall reveal it unto you."
[1:23:51] Then he I love this statement right
[1:23:52] here. Nevertheless, where into you've
[1:23:54] already attained, let us walk by the
[1:23:56] same rule. Let us have the mind the same
[1:23:58] thing. In other words, there are certain
[1:23:59] things that you have attained to, right?
[1:24:02] There was a time in your life that you
[1:24:04] didn't pay tithes
[1:24:09] faithfully. But then you got the
[1:24:12] revelation, God deserves the first of my
[1:24:14] life.
[1:24:16] And then from that moment forward, you
[1:24:18] begin to pay the tithe. At this point, I
[1:24:20] can say to you that you have attained to
[1:24:23] that. But he says the things that you
[1:24:26] have attained to have the same mindset.
[1:24:28] Maybe God wants me to do a little bit
[1:24:30] more. Maybe God wants me to give a
[1:24:32] little bit more. Amen. Maybe I need to
[1:24:35] press in a little bit more.
[1:24:37] I need to pray over the offerings with
[1:24:39] more of a sincere heart.
[1:24:44] It's all about the
[1:24:46] spirit that's behind. That's what I love
[1:24:49] about Paul here. He's telling us what a
[1:24:51] real true genuine believer who is a a
[1:24:54] prophet, right? He's a prophet of the
[1:24:57] New
[1:24:58] Testament. He writes 14 books of the
[1:25:01] Bible that millions of people claim
[1:25:03] promises out
[1:25:04] of he has this humble
[1:25:07] attitude and and we can't see that. We
[1:25:11] can't see. He said, "Follow me as I
[1:25:14] follow Christ."
[1:25:17] I believe he followed Christ. He's he's
[1:25:19] following Christ to be more in his
[1:25:21] image. Brethren, be ye followers
[1:25:23] together of me and mark them
[1:25:26] which walk. So in other words, you need
[1:25:30] to pay attention who's who's walking
[1:25:32] like like Paul
[1:25:34] is as you have us for an example. I
[1:25:38] mean, if you got somebody at, you know,
[1:25:40] at school, boys, girls, if you got
[1:25:42] somebody at school that's actually being
[1:25:44] bad, you know, stealing stuff off the
[1:25:46] desk and pulling the fire alarm when
[1:25:49] nobody's
[1:25:50] looking, you do not want to follow their
[1:25:53] example.
[1:25:56] And so, there's certain examples that
[1:25:57] you do not want to
[1:26:00] follow. If you see somebody hitting
[1:26:02] somebody, you don't want to follow that
[1:26:03] example. If you see somebody yelling at
[1:26:05] somebody, you don't want to follow that
[1:26:07] example.
[1:26:08] You
[1:26:12] don't keep it going. Keep the example
[1:26:15] going because we have the word as an
[1:26:18] example. We have Paul as an example
[1:26:21] here. For many walk of whom I told you
[1:26:24] often and telling you now weeping. Look
[1:26:27] at this heart that's coming out of Paul
[1:26:30] that they are enemies of the cross of
[1:26:33] Christ. Paul could literally say, "I can
[1:26:36] identify those who are
[1:26:40] selfish and they're
[1:26:42] enemies of the
[1:26:44] cross whose end is destruction, whose
[1:26:47] God is their belly, whose glory is their
[1:26:49] same, who mind earthly things." They're
[1:26:52] not even interested in the image of
[1:26:56] Christ. Don't want to be
[1:27:01] overconfident. All right? It is okay to
[1:27:04] say, "I'm an overcomer and be happy
[1:27:06] today in the service." I just want to
[1:27:07] know
[1:27:09] that. Here's the thing. We We got to get
[1:27:13] mad at the devil. We shouldn't be
[1:27:15] feeling bad about oursel for listening
[1:27:16] to the devil, but we need to get mad at
[1:27:19] the devil who's tricked us.
[1:27:23] This This word isn't against you. This
[1:27:26] word is for you. It's against the devil.
[1:27:31] What was the last voice that that
[1:27:35] brother Brandon heard when he went
[1:27:36] beyond the curtain of time in the
[1:27:38] message? The rejected king, he's he's
[1:27:41] beginning to tell the story. It was
[1:27:42] about 7:00 in the morning. He's laying
[1:27:45] in his
[1:27:46] bed. He expresses that he said this
[1:27:50] incident that he's going to tell, he
[1:27:52] said it has changed his life and he can
[1:27:53] never be the same. This one incident
[1:27:55] that happened. So it's pretty powerful.
[1:27:58] He said he was laying there and he just
[1:27:59] looked up. He heard something
[1:28:02] saying, "You're just
[1:28:05] starting. Press the
[1:28:08] battle. Just keep pressing." Now, he's
[1:28:10] 55 years old when this when this
[1:28:15] happens. He only lives five more years
[1:28:17] after
[1:28:18] this. But the voice said to him, "You're
[1:28:21] just starting." This is so profound to
[1:28:23] me.
[1:28:24] so profound of all the great things that
[1:28:27] have happened in his life and the voice
[1:28:29] is saying you're just starting but press
[1:28:31] the battle and keep pressing. So that's
[1:28:33] the message. He's laying there and he
[1:28:35] hears this and then he shook his head a
[1:28:37] minute. He thought well I probably was
[1:28:39] just thinking this. You know a person
[1:28:42] can imagine things. I'm just probably
[1:28:44] imagining. That's what he
[1:28:45] said. And then it said again press the
[1:28:48] battle. Keep pressing. Keep going. And I
[1:28:51] said, "Maybe I said it." And he put his
[1:28:57] lips within his teeth and put his hand
[1:29:00] over his nose. And there it came again.
[1:29:03] Amen. Just keep pressing. He says, "If
[1:29:06] you only knew what was at the end of the
[1:29:09] road."
[1:29:11] Vision. Vision. Why we're serving the
[1:29:13] Lord. Why we're here today. Why we gave
[1:29:15] our heart to Christ. Because there's
[1:29:17] something at the end of the road. Amen.
[1:29:20] And I heard something say, "Would you
[1:29:22] like to see beyond the curtain of time?"
[1:29:25] And brother Brandon says, "Ah, it would
[1:29:26] be such a help if he did." He had an
[1:29:29] amazing experience of perfect love. We
[1:29:30] know about
[1:29:32] that. And at the end of it, he asked the
[1:29:34] question at the end of all it. He says,
[1:29:36] "Do I have to return back now?" He
[1:29:40] didn't want to go back. And the voice
[1:29:43] said to him,
[1:29:45] "Yes, but keep pressing on."
[1:29:49] Amen. So he hears this laying in bed
[1:29:51] before he goes beyond the curtain of
[1:29:53] time. And he hears it when he's in
[1:29:56] heaven. The same message. So I'm here to
[1:29:59] tell you God is speaking. Amen.
[1:30:03] Is you hear you see a man, you see a
[1:30:06] voice, but you need to understand that
[1:30:08] God is here speaking. Amen. And who's
[1:30:11] going to receive it? the sheep.
[1:30:14] My sheep hear my voice and they follow
[1:30:18] me. The others just walk out of church
[1:30:20] and
[1:30:21] good sermon. Liked it. Thanks.
[1:30:24] I don't care if it's a good sermon. What
[1:30:26] I care about is we receive the word of
[1:30:28] God and it changes our life because
[1:30:30] that's what it's supposed to do. Amen.
[1:30:32] We know we had some some wonderful
[1:30:34] service here of
[1:30:37] late. So beautiful. That's what the word
[1:30:40] is for. The word is to change our lives.
[1:30:46] And we got to the only way our lives are
[1:30:48] ever going to be changed. Brother Ram
[1:30:50] taught us is through free more
[1:30:53] agency spoke about it in the in the
[1:30:56] message know if it not. And he he speaks
[1:30:58] about the outside body has five senses,
[1:31:00] five gates. The inside which is he calls
[1:31:03] it the spirit in this message. He said
[1:31:06] it also has five gates. But he says on
[1:31:08] the inside of that is the soul and
[1:31:11] there's only one gate. He says that's
[1:31:13] free more
[1:31:15] agency and that's where you make the
[1:31:17] choice to either believe the word or no
[1:31:20] I don't. And it's on and that statement
[1:31:23] I'm going to tell you it is that
[1:31:25] statement that makes determines whether
[1:31:27] your nature changes.
[1:31:31] Because if you believe it with all your
[1:31:33] heart you will pursue it.
[1:31:36] But if you just believe it
[1:31:38] intellectually, your your nature will
[1:31:40] never change.
[1:31:42] So it's Satan's strategy to get us to
[1:31:44] relax. It is God's strategy to say,
[1:31:46] "Press in." Amen. So notice the tactic.
[1:31:50] I don't feel like it. I I'm late. I'm
[1:31:52] tired. I just don't You know, that's
[1:31:53] Satan. Recognize Satan in your mind.
[1:31:55] Yes.
[1:32:01] Satan's device is to make you feel
[1:32:04] saved.
[1:32:06] so saved that today is not the day of
[1:32:08] salvation.
[1:32:12] So saved that I I don't have to do
[1:32:14] anything. And then Jude tells us, I want
[1:32:16] to put you in remembrance of a group of
[1:32:18] people that were saved at one time, but
[1:32:20] because they didn't continue in their
[1:32:22] salvation that he destroyed them.
[1:32:27] That's where he said, "Beloved, I give
[1:32:28] all diligence to write unto you the
[1:32:30] common salvation. It was needful for me
[1:32:31] to write unto you and to exhort you that
[1:32:33] you should earnestly contend for the
[1:32:35] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:32:37] saints. And who is Jude talking to when
[1:32:40] he's saying all these things in verse
[1:32:42] one? He's he's saying he's talking to
[1:32:44] the
[1:32:45] sanctified to them that are sanctified
[1:32:47] by God to them that are preserved in
[1:32:50] Jesus Christ and called. And he's
[1:32:52] telling this group of people who's
[1:32:54] called who's sanctified who's preserved.
[1:32:56] He's telling them that you need to
[1:32:58] contend for the faith. Amen. You need to
[1:33:01] press into all that God has for you. And
[1:33:04] he gives so many examples. But you know,
[1:33:06] Satan's advice is to get you so relaxed.
[1:33:09] You know, you're saved. You're in the
[1:33:11] message. Just relax now. All you need to
[1:33:14] do is go to church once in a while.
[1:33:17] Hop in here and there. Show yourself.
[1:33:21] Make your conscious feel okay.
[1:33:23] It's a device of Satan and it happens in
[1:33:26] our head. Nobody tells you that. Nobody
[1:33:29] preaches that. Satan
[1:33:33] does. The device of Satan is to get us
[1:33:37] to murmur and to
[1:33:41] complain. Yeah. Give me something.
[1:33:43] Brother Brandon says, "You you you you
[1:33:46] come to church with that spirit on you."
[1:33:48] He says, "Satan will give you plenty to
[1:33:50] look at.
[1:33:52] There's plenty. And I'll say there's
[1:33:54] probably more about me
[1:33:59] than
[1:34:04] anybody. But it it doesn't deter me from
[1:34:08] sharing the truth.
[1:34:10] Doesn't move
[1:34:11] me. Philippians 2:12, "Wherefore, my
[1:34:14] beloved, ye, as you've always obeyed,
[1:34:17] not in my presence only, but now much
[1:34:19] more in my
[1:34:21] absence. Work out your own salvation
[1:34:23] with fear and trembling." That's the
[1:34:24] part that's missing, people.
[1:34:27] don't feel they need any more fear of
[1:34:29] the Lord. They don't need to tremble. In
[1:34:32] fact, what they do with their life is
[1:34:33] they want to make you fear. They want to
[1:34:36] make you
[1:34:38] tremble. And God is calling us to make
[1:34:41] sure that we're pleasing him. Right? For
[1:34:44] it is God which works in you both to
[1:34:45] will and to do of his good pleasure. Do
[1:34:47] all things without murmuring and
[1:34:49] disputings. All things. All things.
[1:34:55] washing the clothes, washing the dishes,
[1:34:58] washing the car, washing whatever you
[1:35:01] do, do it without murmuring. Do without
[1:35:03] complaining. Don't don't come to church
[1:35:05] and say he went two minutes after an
[1:35:07] hour.
[1:35:10] No, not a no complaining. Do all things
[1:35:12] without murmuring and complaining. It's
[1:35:14] a device of Satan.
[1:35:19] Do you know busyness is a device of
[1:35:21] Satan?
[1:35:24] People get so busy that they're too busy
[1:35:27] to work for the kingdom of God.
[1:35:30] Too busy to help at
[1:35:32] church. Too busy to help somebody at
[1:35:36] church. They just use church. Too busy
[1:35:39] to be
[1:35:41] faithful. Some people are literally
[1:35:44] ignorant of what the word faithful
[1:35:46] means.
[1:35:48] In other words, they justify their ex
[1:35:51] they
[1:35:52] justify their
[1:35:56] excuses and still call it
[1:35:58] faithful. Now, there's a difference
[1:36:01] between the ox being in the ditch and
[1:36:05] finding a lot of
[1:36:08] oxes. Come on.
[1:36:12] I am telling you busyness is just
[1:36:15] getting you away from God. God never
[1:36:18] intended us to be so busy that we can't
[1:36:22] keep him first.
[1:36:27] It's a device and the thing that happens
[1:36:30] in our head. We we He's got the ability
[1:36:33] to make us think that we're
[1:36:36] okay. Not being content is a device of
[1:36:39] Satan.
[1:36:41] desiring more money, more things, more,
[1:36:43] more,
[1:36:45] more. Paul told
[1:36:49] Timothy in chapter 6 verse 8 of 1
[1:36:52] Timothy, "And having food and remnant,
[1:36:55] let us be therewith content."
[1:36:58] Can we do that? Yes.
[1:37:01] But they that will be rich fall into
[1:37:05] temptation and a snare, and into many
[1:37:08] foolish and hurtful lust, which drown
[1:37:11] men in destruction and
[1:37:14] predition. For the love of many is the
[1:37:18] root of all evil, which while some covet
[1:37:21] after, they have aired from the faith
[1:37:23] and pierced themselves through with many
[1:37:25] sorrows. I just want to ask anybody
[1:37:27] here, does anybody here, would anybody
[1:37:30] here like to have more
[1:37:33] money? And those of you that did not
[1:37:36] raise your hand,
[1:37:39] um, you know that's not
[1:37:41] true. You know it's not true. We all
[1:37:45] would like to have more money. So, we
[1:37:48] all have to face this. Am I going to be
[1:37:51] content with what I have or will I
[1:37:54] pursue more?
[1:37:56] And here's the thing. If you're going to
[1:37:58] pursue anything or follow after
[1:38:00] anything, it should be God.
[1:38:02] You know, God is ma able to make all
[1:38:04] grace abound to us.
[1:38:06] So this not being content, it's just a
[1:38:09] device of Satan.
[1:38:11] And there's so many and it happens in
[1:38:13] our mind. It don't happen anywhere else.
[1:38:15] And I just if we can just say, God, I
[1:38:19] want you first. Amen. I want you uncover
[1:38:24] the devil in my mind. Help me to
[1:38:26] recognize the devil in my mind. Help me
[1:38:28] to overcome the devil in my mind.
[1:38:31] It's not my brother, not my sister, but
[1:38:33] it's me, oh Lord, standing there in need
[1:38:34] of prayer. Amen. It isn't need me
[1:38:37] wanting to have more money for this one.
[1:38:39] All I need to do is just want to do more
[1:38:42] for Jesus.
[1:38:44] All right, let's stand together. God
[1:38:46] bless you.
[1:38:47] We We weren't able to finish. But you
[1:38:51] knew that was going to happen, didn't
[1:38:56] you? Satan has a strategy against us to
[1:39:00] keep us away from
[1:39:01] God. But don't let him get the advantage
[1:39:05] over you. Don't per Don't let him
[1:39:08] provide your mind with
[1:39:11] something to get you off track. In other
[1:39:14] words, learn the devices of Satan. Don't
[1:39:17] be ignorant of the devices of Satan. I
[1:39:20] believe that God will see us through.
[1:39:23] Amen. This this message, saints, it was
[1:39:26] there to help us uncover the enemy. It's
[1:39:30] not for us to feel bad about
[1:39:32] anything. But if we don't recognize the
[1:39:35] enemy using us, then he'll continue to
[1:39:37] do it, right? We're the only one that
[1:39:40] can put a stop to it.
[1:39:45] Amen. Let's sing. When the battle's
[1:39:49] over, we're in a battle, but when it's
[1:39:53] over, we're going to wear a
[1:39:56] crown. Am I a soldier of the cross, a
[1:40:03] follow of the lamb?
[1:40:07] And shall I fear to own his claws or
[1:40:13] blush to speak his
[1:40:16] name? And when the battle's over, we
[1:40:20] shall wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a
[1:40:24] crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. And

[1:40:41] crown. Wear a bright and shiny
[1:40:46] crown. And when the battle's over, we
[1:40:51] shall wear a crown in that new
[1:40:56] Jerusalem. Must I be carried to the
[1:41:02] skies on flowery bed of
[1:41:06] bees while others fought to win a prize
[1:41:12] and sailed through bloody
[1:41:16] seas. And when the battle's over, we
[1:41:20] shall wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a
[1:41:24] crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. And
[1:41:28] when the battle's over, we shall wear a
[1:41:31] crown in that new
[1:41:36] Jerusalem. Wear a
[1:41:38] crown. Wear a
[1:41:41] crown. Wear a bright and shiny crown.
[1:41:47] And when the
[1:41:48] battle, we shall wear a crown in that
[1:41:52] new
[1:41:55] Jerusalem. Are there no foes for me to
[1:42:01] face? Must I not send the blood?
[1:42:06] Is this thou word a friend to grace to
[1:42:12] help me unto
[1:42:15] God? And when the battle's over, we
[1:42:19] shall wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a
[1:42:23] crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown.
[1:42:26] When the battle is over, we shall wear a
[1:42:30] crown in that new
[1:42:35] Jerusalem. Wear a
[1:42:37] crown. Wear a
[1:42:40] crown. Wear a bright and shiny
[1:42:45] crown. And when the battle's over, we
[1:42:49] shall wear a crown in the new Jerusalem.
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:42:56] I must fight if I would rain. Increase
[1:43:02] my courage,
[1:43:04] Lord. I'll bear the toil, endure the
[1:43:09] pain,
[1:43:11] supported by thy
[1:43:14] word. And when the battle's over, we
[1:43:18] shall wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a
[1:43:22] crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown.
[1:43:25] When the battle's over, we shall wear a
[1:43:29] crown in that new
[1:43:34] Jerusalem. Wear a
[1:43:36] crown. Wear a
[1:43:38] crown. Wear a bright and shiny
[1:43:43] crown. And when the battle's over, we
[1:43:47] shall wear a crown in the new Jerusalem.
[1:43:53] [Music]
[1:43:56] Amen. How many believes you're going to
[1:43:58] wear a crown
[1:44:01] in this particular place? You cannot
[1:44:04] wear it unless you overcome.
[1:44:07] Right.
[1:44:10] Character is not a
[1:44:11] gift. It's a victory.
[1:44:14] Amen. And and what do we ought to
[1:44:17] overcome? Not the person we got a
[1:44:18] problem with, but it's our character
[1:44:21] that can't love them in their situation.
[1:44:25] Amen. Amen. Amen, brother John.
[1:44:29] Amen. Let's sing. We've been made more
[1:44:32] than
[1:44:34] conquerors by the grace of God. Sing it
[1:44:37] like you're an
[1:44:39] overcomer. We've been made more than
[1:44:46] coner. Overcomers in this
[1:44:52] love. We've been made
[1:44:58] victorious through the blood of Jesus
[1:45:04] Christ. We've been made more than
[1:45:11] coner overcomers in this life.
[1:45:18] We've been made
[1:45:23] victorious through the blood of Jesus
[1:45:28] Christ. We've been
[1:45:31] made
[1:45:35] coner overcomers in this life.
[1:45:41] We've been made
[1:45:46] victorious through the blood of Jesus
[1:45:52] Christ. Amen. In this life, in this
[1:45:55] life, we're overcomers. Amen. Not the
[1:45:57] life to come, but this life. Amen. And
[1:46:00] how we do it? Through the blood of Jesus
[1:46:01] Christ. That's the token. That's the
[1:46:04] Holy Ghost in you. So, let's just sing
[1:46:07] that. That the Holy Ghost come in
