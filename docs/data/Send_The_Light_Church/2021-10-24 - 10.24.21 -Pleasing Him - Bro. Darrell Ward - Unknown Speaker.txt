because the word is searching for a good betting ground amen a prepared heart one that can that's only for the word because if we try to mix it then it won't bring forth all the fruit that's intended to so we don't want anything to be in a heart just only your word amen god bless you today in the name of jesus amen i want to just want to welcome brother bill sister sue and their church from celine to join with us today we love them we love you all god bless you and thank you for being with us sharing this time with us it's just good to be together pray that the lord will bless you i just want to speak just a second to the send the light group here today we're going to dedicate this church to the lord we want to dedicate every block every brick every chair we wanted every room especially the septic field is ever going on there we need help but the true church is sitting in these seats and if we can just dedicate ourselves to him we'll take care of the church we'll wash one another's feet we'll meet needs in the body today is an opportunity to to rededicate our lives i'll say to you those of you that feel that you have it hook line sinker you're all sealed up and everything's good please pray for me pray for me i need it i want more holy ghost i want more wisdom i need help because i know every day i can't make it without so pray for me amen we appreciate brother daryl coming such a wonderful servant of god he gives three sermons in one sermon and we don't have three services we had we're having nine he gives his self for god's children for you let's just open our heart i think that's the greatest thing that we that any minister of god wants us to open our heart to the word of god and let it come in and let him have preeminence in our church amen let's stand to together as we just pull on the word to our last service and just don't have preconceived ideas just yield to him and and obey whatever he tells you to do today amen let's sing only believe as our brother comes to give us the word of life today [Music] all things are possible only believe [Music] all things are possible believe lord i believe lord i believe [Music] how happy we are this morning to know what to believe amen amen well here we are last service it seems like things move so quickly don't they you just you come in and the meetings start and before you know it they're over we have certainly enjoyed being here this weekend and we took this service today just to focus on the dedication of the building and the dedicational service and so we trust it to be a blessing to you and i can just say amen and we could close because what the song leaders has expressed and what brother john has expressed is exactly what i'm going to express this morning the dedication of not just the building but the dedication of ourselves we're living in a time of such uncertainty friends you look at these young people here on the front row if time stands they are the church not only tomorrow but the church of today and we want to have a place that our our families can come to that they can get help and satan has all kinds of traps and all kinds of snares set for the people is that right there's the things on the internet and the social medias and the drugs and alcohol and just all kinds of traps and so we need a place that our young people can come to that they can learn and know the the the tactics of the enemy amen because we are in a battle whether you believe it or not we're in a battle amen and but we know who the victory is and so that's what we want to do today is not only just dedicate this building to the lord but to take a time to rededicate our lives and uh you know uh i was looking someone sent me a little video clip yesterday i was telling brother john about it and a precious friend of mine brother tim schultz and just last march i did brother tim's meetings down in noah missouri i was in claremore oklahoma and brother tim and his wife sister joanna came over for those services there in in oklahoma there in june and so sent me a little clip of the july meetings down in arkansas and brother cliff farmer then was singing i'll praise you in the storm and they just kind of panned across the audience and sitting on the platform was brother tim schultz and i was looking at that and it just it just moved my heart because you see brother tim got covered and they buried him last week and i thought how quickly things can change in our lives and i looked at him sitting there on that platform they were singing that song and he was worshiping the lord and i thought he didn't even know he had less than 90 days on the earth how much time do you have i've lost so many friends this year and last year from covent if he's looking over 60 some ministers of this message that's died from covet how much time do you have and are you ready are you ready if it was to happen this evening they just read the announcement i got a i got a text this morning please pray for brother buckles in indiana desperate situation coven i think on the prayer request because someone if i understood it right drowning yesterday evening what if the sun don't come up for you tomorrow are you ready but we're here and you know every person in this building this morning every person here god knew you would be here before the foundation of the world you know god knew you'd be wearing that little thing around your neck before he ever formed the stars he knew you'd have that on your neck this morning that's the kind of god we serve him so you're not here just to fill up a seat so while we're here let's examine ourselves this morning and let's rededicate our lives to him that if the sun don't rise on me in the morning that there'll be a time i'll see you again that's when we all gather into daddy's house because truly we will gather there this message was sent to gather us into our father's house so if we see each other no more on this side let me make preparation and let you make preparation that we'll meet again at another dedicational service may the lord bless you if you have your bibles this morning turn with us to the book of hebrews i trust that was okay i just i didn't really plan to say all that it just came on my heart while we were standing here but with those thoughts in mind let us go to the word of god this morning and we want to thank our precious brother martin for allowing us to come and as we said last night and i didn't say it just to be said it but i really mean it that he could have got a great man to come and dedicate his service and he allowed me to come and so we're really thankful for that and we appreciate that and we pray that something will be said this morning that'll just make us sit and think you know sister told me last night she said i was just about ready to run the aisle i said you should have ran the aisle amen but you know whether you run the aisle or not but let's just take this time and just examine our lives this morning in the light of his word i want to read from hebrews chapter 11 verse 5 and 6. do you love him this morning oh isn't it wonderful to be a christian amen you know why you're turning there when i was young we was raised poor i remember coming home from school and come home and they had repossessed my mama's living room furniture because we couldn't afford to pay but we had a hard time growing up so when i was young i joined the army so i could get the gi bill so i could go to college because my parents couldn't afford to send me to college so i joined when i was 16 went on active duty when i was 17 year old and i joined the army because i i wanted to see the world i'm poor you know so i joined the army i went to oklahoma for my basic training and they sent me to north carolina and i live in tennessee north carolina's one state over i spent all four years of my military service in north carolina you can't make that up so i got out of the army and i was 21 year old and i found the lord as i gave you my testimony last night in an old building down in jonesburg tennessee and since i joined god's army i've been in 32 countries i just found out i was in the wrong army amen hebrews chapter 11. now let's read verse 5 and 6 may the lord bless you this morning oh it just feels so good in here the bible says this by faith enoch was translated raptured that he should not see death that sounds real good to me and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him amen let us bow our heads i want to speak to you for just a few minutes this morning on pleasing him pleasing him heavenly father thy word is true we commit ourself the pastor brother john this congregation into your hands for your glory in jesus name god bless you saints you may be seated this morning now this weekend has been set aside for dedicational service for a church that god has given you and what a lovely place that it is you know david in the bible he wanted to build god a house and he said it's not right that i should live in a cedar house and the one who gave it to me lives in a tent and nathan the prophet he told david do all that is in thine heart for god is with thee and i was thinking about that and i thought you know when god gives you a revelation then carry it out and may god help all of us to do that that when god places something in our heart and we feel that it's god leading us and moving us may god give us courage to carry that out you know it's hard when you've been in a building 20 some years to all of a sudden move from that building to a new building but if god is putting it on your heart to move to a new building with bigger room there's something that god wants to do then let's carry that out to the best of our ability and we feel that if god's leading us to do a certain thing then we want to give a hundred and ten percent of our effort to do the best job that we can do and god has moved this church in this direction he's gave you a place to worship then there's something that god wants to be and to do and we want to get behind that with everything that's within us you see it's not just up to brother john to make this church work it's up to every one of you not just the pastor not just the song leader it's not just a song leader's responsibility to create an atmosphere that god can come into but it's every person in this building's responsibility in a dedicational service you know it's a time to just pull aside and just to take inventory of what it is we're striving for what it is that we're wanting to achieve and the dedication of the new church we want to take a time to take breath and just to thank god for the church and for the word and for the blessings that god has given us and what a beautiful place it is and you know i enjoyed the old place it was always nice to go there but my we've got plenty of room to shout and run the aisles and you didn't hardly have room to breathe over there but so the lord certainly gave you some room to spread your wings a little bit so this morning we we we we want to come on this theme of what we can do to make our church and ourselves more dedicated you know you start off in this new church let it be a time of reconnecting let it be a time of recommitment let it be a time of renewal a time of fresh starts and i don't care how long you've served god there comes every time in our life that we need to hit the reset button amen because we're we go by human you know we get into a rut we do the same thing sometimes every day and we'll sit in the same seat every service but let's take this time to hit the reset button and make a re-commitment and just look at our lives and lord is there something i'm doing that's displeasing to you or have i've lost the vision of what it is that i want to achieve and so let's take this time to reset the button amen amen a time of fresh starts we know our church is only as dedicated as the people who go to it this church will only be as effective as the people that go to it you want an effective church then you've got to have an effective people to go to it you want to pray in church you've got to have a praying people that go to that church amen you know brother ben told the story of the master violinist and i know you've heard the story and they had an old violin that they wanted to auction off they wanted to sell it and nobody would buy it and they put it up on the auction block and he finally got down to that he said would someone just give me a dollar and someone said i just get it off the block nobody wants it and so he said and finally this old fellow grey-haired man stepped up out of the audience and he said just a moment and he reached over and he took the vial in he said let me have it he put some rosin on his bow and he struck it a few times and he began to play nearer my god to thee and as he began to play the violin tears began to roll off the faces of the people that was setting in the audience and the auctioneer catching that moment he began the auction again he said now who will make a bid on this and someone said a thousand and someone said two thousand someone said three thousand five thousand now how did that violated go from the audience who thought it was worthless just a piece of wood get it off the block to being worth something that was worth thousands of dollars what was the difference here it is the master the old greyhound fellow that come and picked up the violin he was the one who made it amen amen he was the one who built it and he knew what was in it amen he knew how to get out of it what was in it the violin was only the expression of the master who built it he had within himself all this music all these sounds that he wanted to express so he created himself an instrument amen that when he designed that violin he knew the sounds that he wanted it to make and when he picked up and struck the bow across the strings the violin became the very inspiration of the master you see the very heart the very passion of the violinist was expressed through the violin he built that violin to be an instrument that he could express himself through and when christ the bridegroom came on the scene he was the very heart of god expressed on the earth a body that god could express himself through then how did he bring christ here by the word of the prophets and then how will he bring his bride here by the word of the prophets so the bride's very actions and the very character of the bride of christ everything about this bride will be the result of the prophetic utterance because she is the spoken word bride christ was a spoken word groom and she is a spoken word bride you say why because the same word that speaks for the gloom speaks also for the bride now how did he identify well how did he identify christ the bridegroom when he came by a man with the spirit of elijah upon him who came out of the wilderness is that true john the baptist then how will he identify his bride he promised in malachi 4 the same thing amen before he destroyed the earth like it was in the days of solomon he would send elijah to restore the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father and as the bridegroom was built by the word to be a body to express god on the earth so will the bride of christ be a body that will be the expression of god on the earth a body has now prepared me then during these meetings if we could become the expression of what god thinks a church should be then these meetings will not be in vain we don't want a church to be just a gathering place but we want it to be the best it can be a man a place of water in a barren land a place of light in the midst of darkness a place of rest for the weary let's labor to have a church that god would be pleased to come to that his spirit would be welcome in where the sick can be healed the dead could be raised and the power of god can transform lives hallelujah where the holy ghost can have preeminence a church not led by man but a church that's led by god can we have a church like that i say yes we can amen satan hates the book of revelation you know why it exposes him he hates the book of revelation of jesus christ in the church he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not satan knows that more than 90 of the people on the earth today he knows that a whole lot more than 90 of theologians amen he knows that since god is immutable in this nature he's just as immutable in his ways and satan knows assuredly the original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action is the true church that jesus claims as his own all else is false now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and perilous we do not want a church like that it exposes satan the book of revelation exposes satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word he wants you to lose the importance of the preeminence of the word in this church right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and what she can do the greater works amen she will be an invincible army amen if they get the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit deserve to withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless be for her we could have a church here in fitting michigan that satan is powerless before this church that's the church i want to go to amen i can go to i can join any lodge i'm not interested in being in a lodge i want to be in a church where god is moving amen satan will be deathly thought today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them you see i don't want to church according to your opinion i'm not really interested in your opinion i'm sorry you said why did you say that because i'm not interested in my opinion amen amen but i want a church according to god's desire that's what we want here not what i think it ought to be not what you think it ought to be but what does god think it ought to be what's god's desire for the church to be you see it's so very important to understand what it is that god desires for his church because we want to please him amen we want to please him and we want god to be pleased oh my that's what he said about jesus you know what he's saying he's pleased to dwell in him this is my son whom i'm pleased to dwell in oh god let me be that way that god would say that about me that god would say that about you that's my daughter that's my son amen and i'm pleased to dwell in them we want god to be pleased with our worship we want god to be pleased with our conduct we want god to be pleased with our walk you say why is that so important that god's pleased brother darrell because according to our scripture enoch was raptured that he should not see death the order to get the more that means to me amen that he should not see death and was not found because god translated or god raptured him for before his rapture enoch had this testimony that he pleased god enoch raptured because he pleased god and the prophet of god told us that enoch was the anti-type of the type how very fortunate enoch was that he was typing you behold hallelujah because god showed in enoch's life what he wanted to do in your life hallelujah then if enoch please god and god raptured him then if you please god god will rapture you amen amen without faith it's impossible to please god and where does faith come faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god amen without faith is impossible to please god for he that cometh that god must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him we please god by keeping his word amen jesus himself when he was here on the earth and he said he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone john 8 29 for i do always listen what jesus said i do always those things that please him jesus's walk upon the earth pleased god amen peter 1 17 for we receive from god the father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory that this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased jesus said as the father has sent me so send i you and the father that sent him with him and was in him and the jesus that sends you goes with you and is in you even to the end of the world so that we may do those things which please him so let's start this new church let us go forth with a desire to have a church that god would be pleased to come to that his spirit would be welcome in not what i desire for the church to be or what you desire for the church to be unless our desire matches god's desire so what does god desire for his church god promised it in the last days he'd sent elijah to restore our hearts back to the faith of the fathers and what kind of faith did they have they had a resurrection faith because they seen him alive they seen him dead and they saw him alive again then what kind of church would god desire he would want to restore church back to the original faith amen so that if peter or paul was the race from the dead this morning and come walking in this church and said on the back view that paul and peter could say amen to what i'm saying to you because the same word they preached we are preaching it today i wouldn't want to go to a church that peter and paul or one of his disciples was to walk was raised from the dead and walk in here and they'd say what in the world is he saying amen i remember when brother brown went beyond the curtain of time he said are all these brandons or all these you're converts and he said no they said no he said she said is all these brandons that said no these are your converts they said i want to see jesus and say well not yet there'll be a time before he comes yet but he'll come to you first and you'll be judged by the word that you preach and and if you're received then they'll be received also and i said to him i said will paul have to stand like this and he said yes paul stands too with his group that he preached to and i said i preached the same message paul preached and said the millions of people raised their hands and said we are resting on that amen hallelujah god's desire god wants a church you can lay his hands on i don't care how little it is well brother we don't have a large crowd it's not in the crowd i'd rather have two that was on fire for god than two 000 that slept every service because those two could do more in fit in michigan than 2 000 sleepers it's not how big we are what if we have a thousand god could come to no god will come to any sins sincere heart amen he said well two or three are gathered in my name i will be in their knits amen well what we need is a good clean washed church a real clean cut 100 out for god out with no shame no backwardness we don't care what the world says we've got god that's all we care about let him laugh at us let him make fun of us amen we'll be shouting the glory when we leave the earth amen what the world says i don't care what the world thinks about us we've got god that's all i care about he's in our hearts and we worship him in spirit and in truth that's what god wants in his church god wants a church that's born again filled with the holy ghost and power and signs and wonders following his church that's what god wants and if that's what god wants that's what i want and that's what you should want this morning amen i born again holy ghost filled church with signs and wonders following amen remember i said i think christ ought to know how to set up a church he was the god of heaven made flesh among us and when he was here on earth he said these signs shall follow them that believe and my name says cast out devils speak with new tongues take up serpents drink deadly things that shall not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never fail that's how he set it up and that's how it ought to be amen then we have no right to change the formula if it works for the first church it'll work for us people arise oh that's for another day but no matter what they say god's truth sells on and forever it'll be the same amen because nothing can stop the word amen it'll move because it's god's word the word will never diminish heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail he said in isaiah 55 we started out these meetings with it that he said that my word will go out it will not return unto me void but it will accomplish that which i please amen so this church that god set up that's the church that pleases his heart amen god wants a clean heart and a clean hands he wants a cleaned up church that he can show himself in when god spreads forth his great wings and shows his power that he's the same yesterday today and forever the eagles can say yes lord that's what i want i'm fighting for it i'm coming for it sure he's the same yesterday today and forever that's what god wants god wants eaglets god wants messiahs he wants men and women who have signs and wonders anointed ones he wants a church that's filled with the holy ghost a church reflected him the same yesterday today and forever god didn't die he just bored himself a kingdom hallelujah he got some messiahs that he could get himself in and express himself through amen every word he says they say amen to it that's right amen they look like him they act like him they believe it amen they got the conductor moving right on out with signs and wonders following that's the messiah like a great symphony they follow the conductor when he goes up they go up when he goes down they go down amen whatever he does they follow if he holds out the note they hold out the note that's the kind of church that we want let him that christ be the great conductor of the symphony that he has put together oh my that we would follow the leading of the holy spirit amen sons of god who are led by the spirit of god messiah lives tonight he isn't dead he's alive forevermore he probably said do you believe that what did he say it would be it would be light in the evening time brother sister i don't care how dark it gets how evil it gets there will be a light because god said so i don't care how evil it gets there in fit we're living now in a lawlessness nation did you see the other day where they closed four pharmacies in san francisco walgreens closed four pharmacies because people was walking in just emptying the shelves and carrying it out and the police rest them and they go before the court and the court says it's a misdemeanor and lets them go crazy crazy we live in a time now that the the criminals are the right and the cops are wrong well priest brother i think i believe we will it's the god's truth that's crazy when they make the cops the bad guys and the criminals the good guys well maybe you like that but you won't like it when they steal your gas oh yeah you'll be all in there amen amen it's no matter how dark it gets no matter how evil it gets and friends just look how much it's changed in the last two years look how far our nation has slipped in just the last eight years but no matter how dark how lawless how evil it gets there will be light at the evening time amen because god said so amen amen hallelujah probably said to go through seven days seven church ages without finding the real living god they've run off in little ism's god gave luther justification and he ran off with it gave wesley sanctification and he ran off with it the pentecostal speaking of tongues and they ran off with it but god wants to call us together in a unity of the power to bring back the fullness of the holy ghost into the church again with all spiritual gifts operating in every local body amen hallelujah we can be a body here friends that the spirit of god and the gifts of god can operate in this local body oh god call us to a unity hallelujah amen not to unite on some man's ideal not to unite on some organization but to unite ourselves under the leadership of the holy spirit amen everybody finding the place in the body let the toes find their place let the hands find their place let every part of the body find this position and stay there amen operate the body will be hurt oh my how does the moon and the sun the constellations stand in the sky they never get out of orbit how the everything in heavens and the constellation if one of those stars would move you go out and out and say i seen a shooting star said no you never saw a shooting star you saw a weather light or a meteorite's what it is a star don't move if the star would move we would move with it everything in heaven is in so much harmony it holds one another together let me say friends let us be in such harmony with the sun the s-o-n let us be in such harmony that we hold one another together you see you're not heavy you are my brother and i was put here to be my brother's keeper amen amen what if we was all to be that way this morning if we would make that commitment today amen that we're going to hold this church together by the unity of the holy spirit that we can all be in harmony with the word amen and there's only one way to do that there's only one way we could ever do that and that's let god be his own interpreter of his word if we'll just let god interpret his word the prophet god said how does god interpret his word by bringing it to pass oh my amen it's like geronimo you know geronimo apache jericho he jumped turkey creek down san carlos i preached our many times among the apaches precious people been there where they helped geronimo prisoner 25 years they chased this man 25 years he eluded not only the mexicans but the united states calvary and when they finally surrendered they never captured geronimo he surrendered and when he did you know how many he had in his band that eluded the united states cavalry 37 people and most of those were women and children he only had like eight warriors and yet he was able to elude them all those years so they use the white mountain apaches you go down to arizona they'll tell you that the white mountain apaches got the better land because they helped the government round up geronimo so they gave them the better land out there you got san carlos think much there friends so they brought geronimo in and the white mountain the patches read your history the white mountain apaches the scouts that they used to track because they said it takes apache to catch apache so they they recruited these white mountain apaches to track down geronimo so when they brought them in they lined these these scouts up sergeants and corporals and privates they lined them up and they placed them under arrest took the weapons away from them stripped them of the rank put them on the same train with geronimo where they shipped them fort pickens florida that are next to destin long way from arizona while they was on that train one of the white mountain apaches you know what he said to geronimo he said you was right not to trust the white eye everything he told us was a lie and one of jerome's warriors spoke up you know what he said he said i'll hate you as long as there's breath in my body i'll hate you so why didn't you leave us alone we were living the way this great spirit gave us to live this was our land why didn't you leave us alone why didn't you track us like dogs i'll hate you as long as i live i'll hate you and the cinderella spoke up and said do not hate him there's too few of us left to hate one another hallelujah and i say friends do not let them divide us you stay united on the word there are two few of us left to fight among ourselves let's hold one another together the prophet said god wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants your thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to feel every bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself or to your thinking just so surrendered in god till his word just lives right through you you don't know nothing else but god's word just stay right with his word his word is life amen we see it that the spoken word we are god's word made manifest we are god's word made manifest that's how he wants his church is to manifest himself you see god wants us to be like that violin that violin could make its own music that my land didn't have its own thoughts it was completely surrendered to the master and all god wants he don't want my thinking he just wants my skin he don't need my ability he just needs my surrender if i can surrender to him he can take me into his hands and he can bring the tune out of my life hallelujah amen he wants a group of people in fit michigan that he can express himself through amen god wants to work in his church how sad it was that day they had the great feast and they invited jesus to come but where did they put him in the corner completely ignored him and we say come lord jesus come to our church and then we ignore him let's not do that let's not put him in the corner let's not put him back there where the bathrooms are out of order let's make him the center of the attraction let's lift him up in the midst of our congregation for he said if i be lifted up i will draw all men unto myself hallelujah hallelujah god wants to work in this church he said i'll be with you always even to the end of the world the works i do shall you do also saint john 12 14 the works i do shall you do also even more than this shall you do because i go to my father you got a beautiful building it's really nice he gave you all this we can come too amen and may everyone who comes here may they not just see the beauty of the building but may they see the beautiful characteristics of jesus christ in every person that comes here may it not just be the building that we consecrate this morning but let it be our lives that we consecrate that we consecrate a place to our lord a consecrated people and a consecrated building we see there's a beautiful structure and we appreciate god for it but really the true beauty of the church is not just the nice carpet and the nice seats and they are comfortable to set into but the beauty of the church is the character of the people and i trust that this place will always be a house of god's beauty when eliza went to find a bride for isaac he wasn't looking for a pretty face or a pretty set of eyes you know girls will see a handsome young man with a head full of hair and they said oh my just got to have him about three years later all that beautiful hair that they loved is in the sink and that 28 inch waist is 82. amen brother now you don't believe me ask my wife amen amen but don't let the beauty of the church just be let to be the character the character when the other went to find a bride for isaac he wasn't looking for a pretty face or a pretty set of eyes but the prophet said he was sweating it out he was looking for a character that would match the character of isaac and god has always counted character over members and elies are sweating it out until he felt that character who he could get he trusted god the character for what a character for isaac the bride which the church is a type of you know that but the real saints of god today they look for the character of the vindicated word that was the natural seed of abraham this is the royal seed of abraham here this morning if eliezer the messenger hunted the bride trying to find character that if that man has come a messenger to the last day if he has come trying to find a bride for christ he will not be looking for denominational membership but he will be looking for a character that's willing to serve and the beauty of this church will not just be the way it's decorated or the colors of the walls but the beauty of this church will be the character of the people who go here let it be set up with us that people would say you know you know what god told me one time he said the greatest compliment he ever got in his life he said he was at work one day and somebody he worked with come up to him and said you know he said we don't believe like each other he said but i want you to know every time i get around you i feel the presence of jesus christ and i thought oh god what a testimony that would be that if one said every time i get around you i feel jesus christ let's be known as hell ah that's not that's that group over there they was over there and they moved over here and they got that build and they've got this down historical place over here yeah it's that friends let them say i tell you one thing i don't know exactly what they believe but every time they're in walmart i see jesus that's my desire friends it's always been my desire my ministry this is someone could see jesus you want to preach that my two girls that they wouldn't just see their daddy as a preacher but that they would see christ in my life if i have sowed jesus christ to my wife and to my children i have not failed in my purpose for being with the earth if you was to die this day what would they say about you tomorrow i tell you what that guy was a real worker he knew how to make a deal really that's what you want to be known for well i'll tell you one thing there's nobody can throw a football life really that's what you want to be known for you can throw a piece of pigskin what really matters in our lives i don't know who these kids belong to but whoever's parents these kids are what do you want them to see what do you want them to see they will see fussing and fighting and carrying on living like the world acting like the world dressing like the world speaking like the world that's the heritage we want to leave our children i say no friends let's leave my heritage then i saw christ in my mama i saw christ in my daddy i saw christ where i went to church i saw jesus let this church be known not just for the nice building that you did a real good job redecorating but let it be known that the beauty of the character of jesus christ you remember the slave owner and he had this slave that we know slavery is wrong it's wrong then it's wrong now god made man man made slaves it's wrong but in that day when they had this slave and everybody wanted to buy this what makes him so special did you feed him different nope feed him with the rest of them you give him better clothes nope he wears what the rest of them were you give me one of them celia masterpedic beds with the control nope sleeps out there on the straw tick like the rest of them what makes him so different what makes him so different he said i wonder that myself until i found out where he come from his father is the king of the tribe and though he's away from his homeland with no hope of ever going back he never forgot who he was that he conducted himself as royalty hallelujah he conducted himself under the aspect of his father amen you see it wasn't his robe that made him royalty if he had one they took it away from you it wasn't his ring you see that right there that makes me three my daddy's the king it wasn't his ring if he had a ring that took it away from him what made him royalty it wasn't his ring it wasn't what he wore what made him royalty it was his bloodline hallelujah and what makes us royalty today it's the bloodline of almighty god amen you see he was reflecting the character of his father's kingdom that when you seen him you saw his father and let us live such a life that when they see us they see our father he was a priest his father was the king and when god made flesh when god was made flesh became the messiah then if we could yield ourselves to be anointed like he was we become messiahs little lights that's what the church is supposed to be is lights in the evening time there shall be light what is that light it is you right jesus said i'm the light of the world and then he said you are the light of the world in the evening time in a time of gross darkness there shall be light because my people will be manifested on the earth that's what the church is supposed to be lights little anointed ones that's god's church his standing light is the light of the messiah risen christ in his people the anointed ones carrying forth his light into all the church ages sometimes it goes completely out then it comes back again god's anointed one god's messiah church if messiah means anointed one and means king then if the church is anointed by the messiah spirit it becomes a lesser but still a messiah because it has his light reflecting his power reflecting his glory reflecting his dominion so it is messiah oh how it reflects his kingdom in his domain it shall be light about the evening time it's you it's me we are the evening time light and as we rededicate ourselves this morning let's go forth reflecting the kingdom of our father to be rededicated and recommitted you call this church send the light but i say don't just send it be it be the light that's sinned whatever you do in missions whatever you do over the world let it represent what you really are don't be a hypocrite and send that and be something else don't send the light and be something else but if you're going to send the light be the light amen little messiahs you see house men brother john was talking coming down the road in marriage and divorce burban said if you want to see what a man really is look at what that man marries then if christ is going to take a bride that'll represent what he is he would have to choose a character that reflects his own character she'll be born of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit she is him expressed saints of god disboarded as we come to a close i kept you along last night i tried to make it short this morning as we come to a close let us be that violin let's let the master this morning take our life into his hands and let him rosin up the bow of the holy spirit and let him come across the strings of our life that our life would sing out amazing grace how sweet the sound i once was lost oh let the master take you in your hands god gave you that life that you have this morning he gave you that life we have one life to live then whether we're six or eight or 12 or 60 or 80. if we've wasted 70 years if we've wasted 80 years let's from this point let the rest of our life mean something to let the rest of our lives mean something that someone could walk up to your coffin and say i tell you one thing i saw jesus and john martin i saw jesus and mark i saw jesus and bill bailey oh god i saw jesus he wasn't too smart said half of his words wrong but i saw jesus in that man amen so this time of dedication this morning friends let's rededicate our lives not just the building but our lives to him do you love him this morning where do you stand in god's light this morning when god sees you what does he think of does he see himself does he see a church member does he see a hypocrite does he see a deceiver a liar what does he see but god help us this morning he said brother what can i do about it there's only one thing you can do surrender that life to him for as i said god don't need my ability he certainly don't need my education all he wants is my heart amen let us bow our heads this morning heavenly father lord we thank you for these words today thank god i i wasn't just speaking to these people lord you know my heart i was speaking to myself that oh god that my life would be pleasing to you going 34 years i've been traveling i've left my wife and my children home many times i've missed birthdays and he piano recitals but lord what would all that mean if i come to the end of the road and i failed lord i failed to represent you so oh god today lord we don't just dedicate this building to you but we dedicate ourselves lord come into my heart lord jesus shine your light through me forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings forgive us lord for our ideals and our opinions that's contrary to your word but lord may we be like enoch who was not because you took him lord amen because before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased you oh god may our lives be pleasing to you today granted lord whatever has bowed this more than i i wonder friends i never point you out and embarrass you i would never do that but if you're here this morning just take a moment the sister cheryl is playing it softly i surrender all just take a moment and reflect upon your life have you really done that which pleases him or have you drifted have you got your eyes off of him and owned to the world as we said one night's month service this week as low as peter had his eyes above jesus the storm had no effect on him it was only when he looked at the waves that he began to sink into the water and i say to you this morning if you've got your eyes on the world and you've tried to cater after them where is it going to lead you friend it'll lead you exactly where it leads them to destruction but oh if you can get your eyes upon him this morning if you could turn your eyes upon jesus and surrender to him and let him lead your life where will it lead you it'll lead you like it led enoch into a translation of not even seeing death he was not because god took him if you're here this morning and the word has spoke to your heart and you want to rededicate your life to him you want to surrender your heart to him or whatever you would find yourself this morning he's here for him would you just slip up out of your seat just stand and just raise your head and say lord remember me lord i want to be like you i want to give myself away i want to give myself a way that you can use me take my heart lord take my think everything that i am lord into your hands i surrender to you this morning i'm not even gonna look around i don't know if you're standing or not standing but i'm gonna pray this prayer and you pray with me heavenly father lord i believe thy word is true god i want you to be the leadership of my life i give myself and my family and my children and all that i have into thy hands oh god oh father used me like that violin just take me into your hands lord i surrender to you today i plead the blood of the lamb of god take my mistakes and my failures and dip them in the bleach of thy blood never to be remembered against me no more and from this time forward let me walk dear god in the footsteps of my savior oh god i give myself away i give myself away to you this morning that you can use me granted lord god grant it lord jesus today if mother standing it father standing if the children stand in it the pastor of oh god i'm standing myself this morning

could be found and blinded eyes could be open lord i know you still do it god when my daughter was blind and the doctor said she'd never see but you came to that hospital room and touched her lord and opened the eyes of a blind child today she sees better than me that's the love you have for us god you can empty out wheelchairs you can raise the dead you can cast out devils you can do all things oh

itself and i've grown to really love them a lot it's it's not hard to give to of being could see jesus in you in spite of your past it's quite yourself despite whatever is going on that we can manifest jesus christ the world that we live amen and i believe that this ministry will help me make a rapture amen and that's important because there's a lot of ministries in this ministry it will help meet jesus amen praise the lord [Applause] you know when it gets right down to us and what we're saying comes from the inside it actually is changing our countenance seeing the inside of a person and may the lord always have that ability as we yield ourselves to god that he can do what he wants to in our life because he wants to do greater things he has a vision for us that is beyond our vision amen amen i'm just going to ask your brother oh one more and then we're gonna have brother bill come up and close in prayer yes my precious brother no you're good brother take your liberty praise god um wonderful
