TRANSCRIPT
========================================
scripture that will be read that you'll bring it to life lord as only you can lord i pray you just bless the service lord from the opening prayer to ending prayer lord and just speak to the hearts lord just move me plum out the way lord and let your voice be heard lord and once again we thank you lord for all the mighty things that you will do tonight lord we ask all these things in your wonderful most precious holy name in jesus christ and we pray amen let's open up to john chapter 3 and we'll read verses 1 through 9 actually i like to hear uh pages turn in the bible so probably a very familiar scripture we've all read probably thousands of times say amen when you're there all right so it says there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know they are a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god so until you're born again you can't even see the kingdom of god the kingdom of god isn't known by intellects it's known by revelation it's known by the changed nature verse 4 nicodemus says unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born nicodemus is was looking at it as a carnal way jesus was talking spiritual carnal can't understand spiritual spiritual has to understand spiritual that's why when we come into the house of the lord we can't come in our flesh because you come in your flesh you can never receive anything from god and god is looking for a hungry and willing heart i want you to last let's sit in too long let's finish these up uh jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of spirit should be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter to the kingdom of god not just water it has to be water and spirit that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit of spirit spirit marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeneth and now hears the sound thereof but can this not tell once it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit nicodemus answer to say unto him how can these things be god bless you may be seated so the title of this uh this message is god's program um god has a program and satan has a program and satan's program is to stop you from getting to god's program and satan's program will always be a counterfeit of god's program if he can't get you to be an atheist he'll get you to be a lukewarm believer which is still in the same boat as that because god said it would be hot or cold and so in god's program there's a certain thing before you can get into god's program you have to be born again because otherwise you'd be just like the folks in matthew 7 many would come to me that day and say lord lord did we not do these things and they probably read their word every day they probably prayed every day but he did not know them workers of iniquity so just going to church wednesdays and sundays is not going to get the job done you have to come your heart has to be prepared for each service don't just start preparing saturday night to go to sunday but soon as wednesday's service is over we should be preparing our hearts to hear from the lord i think in this day and age we've gotten so lazy in times past there will be all night prayer meetings there'll be fastings but i think we've gotten away from that we've got this that's how you keep the unity in the church is praying and fasting together i remember brother brandon mentioned sometimes that after service brothers and sisters would cry because they had to leave one another just imagine the unity and closeness that they had with the lord jesus and that's what we're lacking in churches today and we need to get back to that get back to the abc's get back to the basics because that's what that's what got the job done this is the same holy spirit in the book of acts it's the same holy spirit today and should be doing the same thing in our lives as it did in the book of acts as it did in the 60s the 70s the 80s it's the same holy spirit i think i think we just gotten lazy with all amazon two-day prime and fast food all these things have making us lazy and we want everything right now now now now welcome to the scripture where it says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength it doesn't give a time period it says they that wait upon the lord praise let's go to john 10. so i was uh so it was funny so i was in maine and i've been working on a sermon for a long time it was called satan's program and i was sitting in church on sunday at spoken word tabernacle and then my whole sermon has changed into a guy's program i wasn't planning on doing it and so i was like okay lord and then uh that that same night this the lord just began this inspiration this hit i was in my bed and and this just as a sermon came about uh so praise god on that so he knows what's best so i'm thankful for that so we'll start with verse 1 and john 10. verily verily i say unto you he that enter not by the door into the sheepfold but climbs up some other way the same as a thief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door is a shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out and when he put forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice verse five in a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of a stranger so it is really important that we keep in prayer that's your lifeline your connection not every voice that comes to you is of god that's why it's important to be able to sit still and hear his still small voice verse six this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood it not what things they were which he spake unto them then said jesus unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep so he is the only door that you can go through if you miss it you didn't go through the right door there's many there's many good people christians so-called christians that will miss it they thought they went through the right door but they went through the back door of the cellar we have to make sure every day that we're going through the right door and that's jesus christ he says all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them verse 9 i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved so if you enter into that door you shall be saved if you're not saved you didn't enter into the door be saved and shall go in and out in the fine pasture verse 10 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and destroy he says i am come that they might have life they might have it more abundantly so he wants to give you life and give you more abundantly but if you're not going through the right source the right door then you'll get a counterfeit and i don't want to counterfeit because if you go if you go to a a store or a bank and give them counterfeit they're not going to accept it so we'll make you think the lord is going to accept your counterfeit praise your counterfeit offering we're not here just to do the motions or raise my hand or the motions to say this or that but the lord wants the real thing here to have you be honest and not do it then you need to be a fallacy and put a put on so he says i am the good shepherd and the good shepherd give his life for the sheep amen i actually want to um go back to john 3 actually you don't have to turn in there that's something i want to read at the bottom so it says uh regeneration is what we're kind of talking about today the necessity of the new birth see the necessity it's a necessity to have a new birth grows out of the incas sorry it goes by the the natural man to see or to enter in the kingdom of god however gifted moral refined the natural man is absolutely blind to the spiritual truth so it shows me if i come in the flesh into church i'm gonna be blind to what god is trying to tell me and it's gonna become head knowledge and head knowledge will not get anything done because if you know to do something just have the knowledge of it but don't do it what's the use of you even knowing it it's no point let's go to matthew 19 uh 28-30 matthew 19 20 30. praise god so what's up with verse 27 uh then answered peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken all and follow thee what shall we have therefore verse 28 and jesus said unto them verily i say unto you that you which have followed me in the regeneration so look that word regeneration up reproduction the act of producing anew another definition in theology a new birth by the grace of god that change by which the will of the natural enmity of of man to god and his law are subdued in the principle of supreme love to god and his law or holy affections are implanted in the heart so these it can't be a bunch of do's and don'ts for you his judgments he said he wants to write the laws upon your heart and the part upon your mind somebody shouldn't have to tell you every day that you have to worship the lord or you have to keep quiet in the sanctuary or you have to this god's place is a holy place we need to be treating this place holy if you want god to move you need to keep church order going as well because god is god demands respect and we need to be respecting them and if we can all come to the unity of that of the respect and the sanctuary in the household of god this imagine the things that he can do not only in the sanctuary but in your lives as well see god wants to move but the thing is he demands respect reverence him i remember reading the old testament that when he was on that mountain even the animal person that touched him they would had to die and he's still the same guy he's still holy as that amen he says be holy as i am holy praise god let's keep going um follow me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory you shall also sit upon the twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel and everyone that has forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my namesake shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life so as i'm reading this we need to be surrendering more and more of our life to him if we want to follow the regeneration because regeneration isn't you give your heart to god and that's it but it's a constant process every day grinding pressing into the kingdom of god this is something you have to press into it's not something that's just given to you i remember and i think it's in john forgive me if i'm wrong he says the kingdom of heaven heaven has suffered violence and the violent take it by force so if if you're if you're getting to the real thing the devil is going to stop you because he knows when he gets that real thing then he's defeated if you get to the life source then he has no power over you but the thing is if you think you can do it by your strength then the devil is going to defeat you 10 times out of 10. you have to be connected to that life source you have to be a tree that's planted by the rivers of water you know it's the rivers is plural but the water is singular because there's as many rivers but as one water that it connects to and we have to be connected to that one body of life and we have to make sure that we're rooted and grounded in him because if a tree is not rooted and grounded then it's going to be blown up blown away so if you're so rooted and grounded when that strong wind comes it's going to shake your roots and just cause you to get deeper and deeper and deeper that's we have to get established in the word of god we have to get established in this message of the hour because it's the same thing it's no different it's the vindicated word of the hour praise god let's keep going let's go to titus 3 3-5 and time just runs away huh titus 3-5 so it says in titus 3 5 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration reproduction the act of producing a new you were we were once living in a sinful nature and when he came in and abode all things are becoming new and all things need to become new every day because you're still in these fleshly bodies and there's still a war a constant war against flesh and spirit and you have to make sure you're feeding on the right things on a daily basis because just because you wake up and say i'm a christian it's not going to do anything you have to crucify your flesh that's what being a christian is being a christian isn't proclaiming that you're always a christian being a christian is living a life a separated life i'm not here to be like my co-workers at work i'm here to be separated and used by the lord because people people shouldn't have to hear you say your christian nations by the way you talk the way you conduct yourself it's the way you live the way you act that's what that's going to really show who you are let's keep going praise god so i was noticing something something a while ago i was noticing but um just a personal experience alone with god won't get the job done because how many people in the world and denominations have had a personal experience with god but they're still living an economic life so if you look at peter's life and disciples life they they had a personal experience three and a half years but when when it came time he still denied jesus three times but the thing is when peter got come fully converted and got filled with the holy ghost he wasn't denying christ anymore he wasn't using profanity anymore he was a different changed person so a personal experience alone won't get the job done you have to go into a full conversion you have to make sure that you're sealed away in the kingdom of god because you can be justified and have a portion of the holy ghost you can be sanctified and have a portion of the holy ghost but if you stop there you're gonna miss it god isn't coming for a a part a part way bride a part-time believer bride but he's coming for a bride that adorns herself a bride that's made herself ready see the bride of christ isn't gonna just sit down and wait for everybody else to get ready but she every day she's gonna be getting ready every day she's gonna be seeking the lord every day she's gonna be pressing into the kingdom of god no matter the no matter the circumstances no matter how busy your schedule is she's going to make time for the lord every time so i don't care how busy we are in this world all those things they're temporal they're not we're not taking them with us only thing we're taking with us is our walk with christ our character what's done for christ is what's going to last that's the only thing that's going to matter in this world so so a full conversion so uh sunday uh brother ben was speaking about uh so say if i go to canada and have 100 us dollars and i want you know a conversion in the canadian dollars a hundred now if they only give me 99 of my 100 i did not get a full conversion so if you only go in 99 say if you're one percent away from getting the holy ghost and stop at 99 this isn't a math test it's not about how close that a is it's about going into a full conversion you get that 400 percent that lost sheep he didn't stop at all the 99 but he went to get that one lost one he he didn't stop he went all the way so it makes think you and i he didn't go halfway to calvary he went all the way to calvary so if he has to go all the way to calvary and crucify his flesh and deny himself what makes you think you and i that we don't have to go all the way as well so a full conversion is a must so we can't just assume that we're converted we have to make sure that you have the real thing you want to make sure that you have the seal of god because there's going to be many people on that day that thought that they had the seal of god but they just had a portion of him and he's not looking just for a portion but he's looking for a sealed away believer and when you get the holy ghost get more when you get more get more keep getting more keep feeling that keep trimming that lamp and keep filling it with the oil i look at the word or the conversion is it personal you must forgive me so con conversion turning away from something and going towards something else so if you're truly converted you're not going to have one eye in the world and one eye on christ you're gonna you're gonna put your hand on the plow you're gonna keep going and not look back like a lot's wife she looked back this one look that one look changed her whole life and she became stone so what is there to look back to there's only death and destruction back there so i'm not going back i don't know about you but i'm not going back and i'm blue [Music] let's go to galatians 2 20. so it says i am crucified with christ so looking like me that i have to have a daily crucifixion nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me so if you want christ to live in you daily you have to deny yourself you have to crucify yourself you're willing to lay your life down for one another for strangers and people are going to walk right over you that doesn't stop you still from laying your life down people walk right over jesus they even wash his feet the very god of heaven they didn't wash his feet they didn't stop that they didn't stop that lady from washing his feet i want to be like her just imagine that privilege just to wash the master's feet and by serving one another you're washing the master's feet don't forget that not even a cup of cold water given in his name is he gonna forget about it so it says but i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me so that's how when the holy spirit is radiating your life brother branham said the holy ghost can't wait for the doors to get open so why aren't we having that same type of attitude the holy ghost can't wait for doors get open so why are we barely just walking in barely coming in 30 minutes praying oh i made it now we should be hungry and desperate to hear the word of god we should be hungry and desperate god just doesn't speak to speak he speaks for a perfect purpose there's something in your life that we're lacking and he wants to make it anew he wants to refine it he wants you to cultivate it so if you're just barely making it in how can you ever get connected with god i think a lot of times we just make excuses why why i couldn't prepare for service on wednesday and sunday god doesn't want to hear excuses and i don't want to hear my own excuses because they may they may sound good to me but they don't sound good to anybody else but what excuses do is excuses make you lazy and we become lazy it becomes a bad habit you have a feel bad eating habit guess what happens it didn't start this on day one but it started countlessly day after day after day after day and the thing we got to break these bad habits anyone can break that bad habits the holy ghost but you got to be willing to put the work in be willing to recognize it and be willing to walk in all the truth that god has given you let's go to ezekiel 36 26 we can't just know about god you can't just know about them well brother bruce knows them that's good enough i kind of know him but we must experience god for yourself you can't really can't up like even i know you children it comes to the point where you guys have to have your own personal walk with god mom and dad can't have it for you to a certain extent they can but when you become of age you gotta strive for that personal walk start now while you're young don't wait until you hit teenage years but you start now there's nothing in this world that is worth i've been in the world it will chew you up and spit you out and have no remorse and do it again so you children you keep serving god give god all your heart on a daily basis i guarantee he's gonna bless you tremendously he honors faithfulness let's go to ezekiel 36 let me get there 26-27 so probably very familiar scripture a new heart also will i give you a new spirit will i put within you a lot of people tend to stop at just the new spirit they put within them but it is more see thing is the heart that you had was stoning he wants to give you a heart of flesh so a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you now take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh and then i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk into my statues and to keep my judgments and do them so now when it becomes that part you aren't trying to do them yourself right it's a natural it's organic like how vegetable is organic so it becomes a natural thing that you don't have to put it on you're doing it because you love the lord you'll be pleasing on to him but the thing is you can't just stop at just getting a new spirit you have to go on to getting that seal of god and the thing is i'd rather have i'd rather have the seal of god and not know it and keep pressing towards it than to think that i have it but i really don't i rather have that any day of the week because the thing is if you always have an eye no spirit i know everything god can't do anything for you because god god isn't in that that's not type of attitude that god's in it's not the right attitude to have so like i said we must make that decision like i said before we must experience god for ourselves we must make that decision to turn from death unto life so we'll read psalms 34 8. so things you have to taste the lord for yourself you have to experience you have to have experience with the lord for yourself the thing is don't just stop with a one-time experience but you have a testimony every day 34-8 so it says o taste and see the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him oh fear the lord ye his saints for there is no want to them that fear so we shouldn't be wanting things that we don't need see a lot of times we want things but we really don't need it see i want in need of two different things so one is i need more of you god i need it the thing is you you have let me rephrase that a need is you need god but the thing is just having that knowledge of i need god isn't going to get the job done unless you're willing to put the work in because if you want more of god there's more of god for you it's it's as much as you want but the thing is don't stop short because right now god is trying to speak to to you to me but if we're not in the right mindset we're thinking about we're going to do tomorrow for work or how long is brother mark going to preach for us he's going to go over an hour you know i'm going to write him off then we're not going to be able to receive these things see the see the lord isn't in these time frames that we're in you know god is in these time frames well i gotta you know i gotta go to work in five minutes no he's he's saying we go to pray to say lord i'm not here to make a timeline i'm just here to meet with you i don't want to leave until i i hear your voice speak back to me and a lot of times we make prayer until like a time i'm gonna pray 20 minutes i'm guilty of it oh i'm gonna pray five minutes ten minutes don't make a time limit get in your knees and just start praying and start pouring your heart out to god labor into the presence of god go to luke 11 24. see and people just and people think just because something has changed in their life they have received the seal of the holy ghost but if you just stop by sanctification you have not received the seal of god yet god wants to feel you see god can deliver you of things but you still not have the holy ghost and we'll read that i believe in luke 11 24 i believe i'm not mistaken 11 24 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and finding none he saith i will return unto my house once i came out and when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnished then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first so we could say this man was he had sanctification he was cleaned up but he never went on to receive the holy ghost and there the spirits that went into were worse so we can't just stop at sanctification we have to go all the way to the baptism of the holy ghost we can't just see a lot of times people a lot of times people get baptized and come up a wet center my brother brother brandon said that a lot of times people aren't truly repenting see you don't just don't get baptized and get baptized so jesus did say you must be in water and in spirits you think it's got to go on to receive the spirit of god amen because if you just get baptized that's a beautiful thing but if you're never going to receive the spirit of god you can't say the day of judgment lord i got baptized in your name correctly while you know these baptists and other people didn't he's going to say why didn't you go in to receive the holy ghost it isn't about how much better you are than somebody compare yourself with the word of god don't compare yourself with others god isn't looking for how much better you are than this drunkard in the world or this prostitute in the world he is not looking for that he's looking what are you going to do with the truth that he's giving you too much given much is required we at now um let's keep going we'll go to matthew 26 next 26 69. i actually don't want to go there but i just i just uh kind of paraphrase it so that's the time when peter when uh jesus told peter that he's gonna deny him three times and three different occasions he denied him and just want to go to show you that he wasn't fully converted yet and so the thing is we have to make sure don't don't assume because as soon as the venturing authority you make sure you hit full conversion because if you only have full conversion you can never be the soldier that god wants you to be in this program like i said god has a program for your life and it's not up all about your life it's about what you can do for god why was the holy ghost given was to continue the works of god not to continue your works in your life but to continue the works of god that's what the holy ghost has give that's what the holy ghost is going to do in a person's life look at look at paul's life in peter's life paul thought he was following god's program he thought he was following god's program and we met he met him on damascus in acts 9. he realized that he wasn't following god's program but if paul would have stopped there he wouldn't have followed god's program but notice he went on to receive the holy ghost if he stopped just at that personal experience he would have missed it but he went on to receive the holy ghost let's go to acts nine we'll read that verses one and saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughtering against the disciples of the lord went unto the high priest just imagine he he thought he was right in his own eyes every man is right in his own eyes that he thought he was doing the thing that was the right to do and desired of him letters to damascus how many times a week we get caught up in that that type of mentality that oh this is what the lord want me to do and come to find out it's not but after we do that we don't think about it anymore we don't think about how we got tricked we just kind of forget about it and then and then later don't get caught in the same rut again so you have to look and be aware of what what's going on how did that voice trick me what what was i listening to because you want to call god a liar that's why there's so many voices especially in this this day and age this last day and age to lay you to see an age there's so many voices you got techno technological voices phone voices tv voices you got all these things it's going in your ear and if you're not in the right spiritual connection the right mindset you're going to be fooled and tricked every time that's why it's so important to be sober and to be what vigilant because the adversary is roaming like a lying seeking whom he may devour verse two and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto jerusalem as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there shine round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saw why persecuted thou me and he said who art thou lord and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecute us it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and he trembling in the stone and said lord what will thou have me to do and the lord said unto him arise and go into the city and it shall be totally what thou must do verse seven and when the men which journey with him speech is hearing a voice but seeing no man and i saw a rose from the earth and when he was eyes were open he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into mass he's going to jump down to 11. so he talked to ananias talked to the lord and told him and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire in the house of judas of one called saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth verse 12 he have seen in a vision a man named ananias coming and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight then ananias answered lord i have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy saints in jerusalem and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon his name the lord didn't even acknowledge it but the lord said unto him go thy way for the chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and the kings and the children of israel for i will show him how great things he must suffer so we go to here and we see paul is filled with the holy spirit then he's baptized so once again we're going to see how the life of paul changes we'll go to verse 20. and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god but all that heard him were amazed and said it's not this he that destroyed them so they noticed a direct change in his life because he was filled with the holy ghost and he was not the same saul but he was now paul he was he was a different he was a different and when he met with the lord he didn't stop at the personal experience but he went on to receive the baptism of the holy ghost and we see him later in philippians he said oh that i may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings so suffering is key to know the lord your flesh is going to suffer if you want to truly know the lord except for big time you have to give up your time your will your sleep sometimes give up a lot of things what are you willing to give up amen but all that hurt him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on his name in jerusalem and came nearly for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief priest but saul increased the more in strength and confounded the jews which dwelt at damascus proving that this is the very christ and after that many days were fulfilled the jews took counsel to kill him so he was speaking the truth i remember jesus was saying woe unto woe and all men speak good of you so i think a lot of times we try to fit in we're not here to fit in we're from a different kingdom we're from a kingdom above so we're not here to fit into everyday joes we're here to stand out we have a purpose and supposed to be part of god's program so time is running short make sure you have the real thing the real seal of the holy spirit not a counterfeit not not not a fake without it you're going to miss what the lord is calling you to if you've not received the seal of the holy ghost i'm pleading with you brother and sister don't miss it god is not looking for how much you give to the poor how nice you are all those things are wonderful and i think man i'm going to second page i believe you should do them you should do all those things but you think that's going to take the place of the holy ghost then you're wrong but when god comes back he's coming back for all those sealed with his spirit in egypt the blood wasn't applied properly in the land properly he didn't care if you're a hebrew or not he is a certain thing you had to follow he had that seal that blood had to be applied that blood is not applied in your life you're gonna miss it it doesn't matter how good you were to the pastor how good you were to the church doesn't matter how many uh meals on wheels things you did how many toys for tots you did no that's going to matter if you don't have the seal of god so go to matthew 25. very familiar scripture so we look in here in matthew 25 there's there's virgins there's a wise and the foolish and mind you they were both clean they lived pure lives but one they had a difference one had the seal of god and one thought they had enough and the one that had to seal a god they kept getting more of god while the ones that thought they had to seal they thought they could just just know about god and i can you know have prayers and you know and to do this every once in a while and i'm living clean you know i'm not like these other people out here i'm not stealing robin banks but the thing is if they thought wrong because they missed it and we'll take pick up in verse 1. then shall the kingdom of heaven be like unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise and five of them were foolish they that were foolish took their lamp and took no oil with them that's dangerous but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom terry they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise ants are saying not so let sabrinian be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him so the thing is you have to make sure you're ready and you can't say oh no i'm not ready yet can can you hold like five more minutes so i can get some more oil no no no no get ready right now today because tomorrow's not a promise so you want to make sure you plant your potatoes but still live like he's coming today because he's not going to wait because you weren't ready yet when it's time it's time and while they went to buy the afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not and they live clean lives but he didn't know them watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh so you don't know the day or the hour he's coming so be ready today and persuade others to be ready knowing the terror of the lord we persuade men so we're gonna go to matthew 7. i kind of paraphrased that a little bit but saying this just because you heal the sick and cast devils out doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna make it because remember judas he was given those things as well he walked with jesus for three and a half years treasurer all these things he saw miracles healings all these things he saw but he missed it and he could say i had a personal experience with jesus i walked with him i saw him break bread and fishes and loaves and all these things when it came down to get the real thing he didn't have it he sold out for 30 pieces of silver he sold out and he stayed for a long time but he didn't have the real thing so not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of of my father which is in heaven that's god's program many many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in that name and in thy name have cast out devils in that name done many wonderful works and then i'll profess unto them i never knew you depart from me that work iniquity so they knew to do something they didn't do it so they thought that they can go through the back door because we read it earlier if you go through the door you're going to be saved but obviously they didn't go through the door because they weren't saved he said depart from me so it's so important for you every day to be cultivating your walk with the lord every day for you to be seeking with all your heart even pray hards when it's hard is to pray that's the time where victory is going to happen where something really is going to happen it's so easy to pray when everything's in line you get all the time in the world you know nothing's going wrong but what's your prayer life like your prayer life to me is really going to show me we can pray when it's hardest to pray when everything's going around you your wife's yelling at your husband's yelling at you uh you about to foreclose on your home that's the type of things that's really going to show if you have the real thing because it doesn't matter it shouldn't matter the circumstance in your life you should always be looking to him no matter what this is from the greatest bad ever fought no matter how good you are how more you are how truthful you are those things are respected but jesus said except a man be born again see there's something's got to something happen inside it has to happen inside here anything that's on the outside if it's happening outside the inside first is not going to do you any any beneficial it has to start in the inside first you know jesus on the inside working on the outside inside first and outside if you if you do that that's artificial put on for down in your heart you desire to do it anyhow it can't be artificial it's got to be real and there's only one avenue that you can come down and that's by the way a free more agency you have to make the choice daily come into the soul by your thoughts as a man faith in his heart so he is if you say to this mountain move and don't doubt in your heart but believe that you would have have said will come to pass you can have what you said you get it there you are there's the battleground if you only get that started first so when you come to church and say lord i have to receive you i'm going to receive from you i believe you're going to get it don't but the thing is if you don't have the preparation to back it up don't say it because the thing is god isn't saying well don't wait 30 minutes before service and start praying for the lord to speak to you at that point you need to start three days before then so a great revival here not long ago up there in one of these eastern states they claim to have 30 000 converts and six weeks later they couldn't find thirty people holding out it was just a cold dried-eyed confession grind requires death and regeneration that's what the matter this man was a believer the devil walked right out and openly confessed jesus christ and said who you are the son of god they wasn't saved they were devils so devils tremble they even believe that there's one god but they're not even more saved than at all they're not saved at all so just because you believe that jesus christ is the son of god it doesn't mean anything unless you receive it into your heart right and and that blood is applied and your heart is circumcised see your heart has to be circumcised so you think it's not the circumcision of flesh and foreskin anymore it's the circumcision of the heart if your heart never gets circumcised then you're never going to be a soldier in god's army he's that's what that's what god's looking for let's go to proverbs 14 12. see thing is god wants to give you his seal but the thing is he's not going to give it out if you're not willing to fully surrender your life and fully turn away from your ways see the thing is that nature that we were born with god could not coexist with that he refused to coexist with that so that's why he had to give you a new spirit in order for his spirit to be able to live with your spirit but if you never get that new spirit you can never get the holy spirit but if you stop at that new spirit then you're still going to miss it so my thing is you have to go all the way all the way 14 12. let me get there hold on one time proverbs 14 so it says there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death that's scary so there's only one there's two ways you can go the straight and narrow or the broad way the brawl is going to be really appeasing to your flesh it's going to feel good while they're straight and narrow it's going to be hard it's not going to be easy it's going to be many sleepless nights friends are going to turn their back on you family members are going to talk turning back on you i've been there there's going to be a lot of rejection those that live golly will suffer persecution so it shouldn't come as no surprise if everybody's liking you then something's going on wrong because you should be suffering persecution in some shape or form people people are going to mock you all the time for living a godly life and people are going to stab you in the back talk behind your back that's okay i'ma pray for them pray for them that despitefully use you bless them that curse you that's the love of god right there love of god doesn't back bite love of god doesn't count wrongs and talia love god for gifts love is let's let's go to that actually it's not my notes let's go to that first first corinthians 13. i think that's something very important see the thing is that's what the holy ghost is love right god is love that's what the holy ghost is going to do in your life so we'll go verse 1 though i speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity i am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and have all knowledge and though i have faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing so you can have all those things your prayers can be answered have faith to move mountains but if charity is not there they profit you nothing and we'll keep going down there and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profits me nothing charity suffereth long is kind charity envy not charity vaulted not himself up is not puffed up charity has no pride charity lifts others up it looks as other's condition like jesus had compassion and a multitude does not behave itself unseemly seek it not her own so love doesn't seek how she can get something out of it love seeks how i can help this person build up how can i how can i point this person to the love of god it rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things and endureth all things check this out charity never faileth your love will fail my love will fail it has limits but god's love does not have limits but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether it be tongues they shall cease whether it be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought i was a child when i became a man i put away childish things i think it's time for us to grow up we can't keep doing the same thing we're doing expecting the same results we got to unite together as a body we can't it's not an individual you know body walk yes it's an individual walk but we got to come together as a body the left arm can't say i don't need you like brother ron said you can't just wake up and say i don't need you left foot you need your whole body to work properly so why can't we come together and pray together that's how that's how you if you want god like i said before church order starts with all of us can't be talking in the welcome room in the couches i said it we can't be talking back there having a conversation in powwows you need to be seeking the the either god in the sanctuary or in the prayer rooms is it the back there in a couch room isn't for us to just talk and have conversations on your phone no no no prepare your heart for the lord because you could be hindering somebody receiving from the lord and it's just the lord's sanctuary even a kid running can affect the next service even getting up during the song service you can affect the lord moving i was planning on saying this but it it needs to be said because we preach church order and like we forgot about it we shouldn't be forgetting about church order it's important how you expect god to move if you're not following the abcs literally abc's something we shouldn't have to remind all the time we should be inc think about each think about others don't affect somebody else's walk with the lord they're trying to receive something and say if we can unite together on this imagine the things that god can do in the sanctuary imagine the things god can do in his house that prophecy we can all come together and pray for one another and come together it's all about unity when in an upper room peter didn't say well wait a second let me make a sandwich real first let me go to the bathroom first no they stayed there and when that holy spirit fell look what it did holy spirit following through the same thing and here tonight here today but you have to be willing to crucify yourself you'll be willing to go the extra mile don't wait for brother bruce to do it or for me to do it you do it you be that example you set the atmosphere amen let's keep going like i said before god is not coming for a halfway ready bride he's not coming for a halfway believer nor a part-time he's coming for a full-time believer we'll go to revelations 19 19 7. there we go so the bride of christ she's not going to make excuses the bride of christ is going to follow everything that the master shepherd tells her everything that her husband tells her she's going to follow no matter how no matter how hard it is she wants to please him she wants to be just like him and the fact she will be like him so 19 7. so it reads let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready so if you're not ready today make yourself ready right now strive for it press don't wait till tomorrow cause you might not wake up tomorrow i might not wake up tomorrow it might be my last term when i preach who knows but i want to go out trying to stir things into your remembrance i want to go out making sure that you guys have a fighting chance so it's high it's high time for us all to awake time is of the essence like i said before don't assume you have something just keep striving for more the holy ghost on a daily basis don't stop seeking more as and i think of many women today would ever stop step into the light of the holy spirit under the unction of god's spirit in light of god's word everything that god has promised will illuminate to you and be real again read that again i think if men and women today would ever step into the light of the holy spirit under the unction of god's spirit in the light of god's word everything that god has promised will illuminate to you and be real again it's how simple it is it's from the arrow of god's deliverance shot from a bow while the reason moses failed in the first place here's what the matter was it was a lack of having what the burning bush had that's right and what's our failure today is lacking having what the holy spirit has and the holy spirit has all good things for us if we receive the holy spirit and all then all things are possible and not only possible but promise to us jesus said ask the father anything in my name and i'll do it if you abide in me my words abide in you ask what you will and it'll be given to you when we step into the light of god's word with the unction of the holy spirit just to shine the light on it brother the impossible becomes little things amen so then dear people you hearing shiva report let this be a warning to you if you believe me to be god's servant the best thing for you to do around life tabernacle and everywhere is keep an old-fashioned prayer meeting going keep keep the unity of the spirit keep the looking up and watching for the coming of the lord keep all worldliness out of you no matter how bad it hurts circumcised by the holy ghost will cut away the worldly things now begin to see a lot of worldliness creeping into you so now get that out no matter how bad it is life tabernacle i'm talking to you when i was reading that i was just like you're speaking to me because it's so easy for the world just to creep in and you not know remember a couple more quotes and uh we got five minutes moses heard his father-in-law moses was hurting his father-in-law's sheep jethro on the backside of the desert and one day an angel passed him in a burning bush now an angel came down to bring the message to moses and otherwise was to be his god men are they can't you can't guide yourself there's two ways that's your way and god's way and when you're in your way you're out of god's way you can't mix your way in god's way together either you're following god or not following god don't try to switzerland you either you pick god's way or your way each day you wake up you have a choice whether you want to serve you can either go god's program or a satan's program and don't try to sugarcoat a well you know no either guys or satan's if you choose not to crucify your flesh for the day satan's program all day if you choose to crucify your flesh truly crucify your flesh you're gonna go god's program so he was uh see he was called a sheep we're liking the sheep oh and we finish this and we're in your own way you're out of god's way you have to forget your own way to find god's way a man cannot lead himself he was called his sheep we're liking the sheep there's anybody around here knows anything about raising sheep when the sheep gets lost it's perfectly helpless it'll stand and bleed until it dies that's all it's helpless and we without a leader are helpless and christ is our leader and god was moses leader though he sent an angel i send my angel before thee to keep being away and to bring me to the place which i promised the angel was to be his leader so the lord wants to be the leader of your life he wants to guide you direct your paths but the thing is don't just think prosperity of the natural means you have a good walk with god you want prosperity of the soul as our pastor preached god wants to restore you from the inside out right and if you're not getting restoration of the soul then you're missing god's program the thing is this life isn't about living your own life to yourself being a monk it's about going out and finding souls it's about going out and helping one another building cultivating call your brother and sister sometime i know i'm guilty i don't call enough let's let's spend time get to know help build each other iron sharpens iron that's how a church that's how our church is built upon one another caring enough i think sometimes we get so caught up in our lives i'm too busy to call brother so-and-so i'll do it next month next week and a year goes by and then the same thing another year's go by and then we don't see some people in here a lot of people should be here now shouldn't see all these empty seats go call them see what's wrong with them spend some time with them don't scold them because not in church but find out why they're not something could be happening you could help them with pray about it say lord how can i help brother and sister so and so they're part of the body i need i i need them they're the arm i can't be without them so now dear people you're here in shave report let this be a warning to you i think i read this already and i tell you don't let the world creep into you don't let the world get into your church's brother i pray it out fast it out until god comes down and takes a hold that's right keep the joy of the lord among the saints keep them prayed up and guard every little place again and guard every little place if noah seen a leak in the ark why he put some pitch in it and that's about the best thing i know to keep the leak out of the world is stop the leak is the best thing i know to do only way to do it that's prayer prayer stops the leak prayer changes things that's how important prayer is if you don't have a prayer life you don't have a walk you know that sounds bold but it's the truth can't just pray three times just you can't just pray monday tuesday wednesday and just take the rest of the four days off but a prayer life is a seven day a week affair and like i said don't just check the box but the thing is you have to be willing to die out let that flesh rot while you're in prayer let that flesh know who's boss you bring that flesh under subjection it doesn't control you you control it there's something wrong and you got to get the world out before christ can come in he just won't associate with unbelief and things of the world it's matching time you know that's true it's a matching time amen that must have went home that's right listen this is true i'm gonna tell you my brother i don't care whether my shoes match my trousers or my trousers match my coat i want my experience to match god's bible that's the matching time if you want to match something match your experience with paul amen that's what we need today is a matching time with paul's faith in the bible that's our example real matching time don't try to match your neighbor oh match something to say to the bible if you're a saint act like a saint dress like a saint talk like a saint pray like a saint believe like a sin shout like a saint be like a satan live like a saint die like a saint and go to heaven like a saint i'm read one more and i'll shut up separating time this borderline believing is halfway lukewarm do you know what the bible said that that day would come the latest in church he's uh he said you'll just be lukewarm and make god sick at his stomach he said he spew you from his mouth delayed the seeing this enough religion to make you sick we're still longing for things of the world i better not do that oh brother if we wanted to do that i'll do it but i know tonight that there is a good old-fashioned baptism of the holy ghost that makes you love god so well you don't care do it anymore amen that's just a second give me one second all right one second all right but we strike short oh if we never go over to the church we'll join the church and we'll think that's all right that's all right brother don't think short of nothing of god's blessings the bible said jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever strike it amen don't be afraid god said so i'm the lord that healeth thee strike it god says so it's the arrow of deliverance is brought to the church tonight so if you want the lord to move in this house what are you going to do for the lord what things are you going to stop doing we have to come together collectively as a body see the thing is a house needs all his parts to function and so i need all of you guys to unite with me let's start taking church orders serious let's start taking preparation serious let's start praying more at home for the service and start praying for more for the lord to con we can receive from the lord and it has don't just make don't just think about it but make it put into action because you can have something in your mind but never put into action so each one of us have to put this into action be willing to start checking on one another start praying for one another more don't just say oh just bless for the ron and just go on because brother ron could be dealing with something he's praying for or i could be doing something brother bruce can we deal with something brother jonathan brother sister gabrielle like i say we we need to be praying more for one another earnestly earnestly our loved ones earnestly there's still souls out here we need to be getting and if we're so caught up in our lives we're never going to be able to get to him because god we're a million miles from what god wants us to be we move so fast sometimes we're always trying to get into this get into that get into that and god gets like a little bit god doesn't want a little bit he wants to be the center of your life he wants to be number one he doesn't cut the distractions out there's things distracted in your life cut them out only distraction's going to do is going to take you away from the mark so even a man's best is vanity so it shows me i can't do it alone i need the lord i need all the lord he's my you gotta remember i'm running around with saying something that's so profound you gotta be thankful the more thankful you can be in this life the more you can look back to calvary and realize your strength comes from the lord if the lord takes his hand off you like he did to job satan can do anything to you it's by the lord's grace and mercy that satan does not destroy us don't forget that it's the lord's hands that's over you he's giving me the money he's blessed you with a house over here roof over your head we're talking earlier there's believers who don't even have a roof over their head to worship but yet they're willing to walk miles and miles to attend every service they're wearing the snowmobile because they know they're coming for god but but here in america we get so lazy we can't even make it to every service this is your post of duty this is responsibility it's our job each one of us don't just plop in the seat become prepared come ready let it stand amen we'll bow our heads oh lord uh we're just so thankful for your word tonight lord lord i know it's a definitely a hard message lord but i know we all needed i needed it lord and lord i pray is we would leave these your house lord that we wouldn't forget what you spoke to each one of us lord i don't know what you spoke to them lord but i pray that they their ears were open to hear from you lord and i pray that each heart was just touched lord because they heard from you lord i pray they didn't hear from me because lord i have nothing to offer them lord but lord you have life to offer them lord and if anybody uh just feel they've been cold and formal to the lord just make a rededication in your heart to them if you feel like you could you've been putting god on the back burner and been distracted just lift your heart to him because i'm right with you i need to rededicate myself as well and lord this this world is just filled with so many twists and turns lord and forgive us lord for not always keeping our eyes on you lord but from this day forward lord we want to make a declaration a promise to keep our eyes on you lord because these days are getting shorter and shorter and satan knows he has about a short time and we want to make sure that we have the real thing we don't want to counterfeit we want a full conversion and lord i pray there's anybody listening on a live stream tonight or even in church tonight that doesn't have the seal of the holy ghost i pray lord that they would seek it lord until they would get it lord they wouldn't stop until they get perfect love your prophet said that nothing without perfect love will enter in so there's nothing short of that we need that seal lord or i pray tonight lord that you just fill us lord so full with your holy spirit lord that we wouldn't even think about this life anymore lord we'll just think about living for you lord this life is so important lord we have to find the purpose that you've given us lord and lord we don't want to just just walk around aimlessly lord we want to find that direct purpose you have the position that you have and lord you've given us a position and duty to be be a church lord i pray that we would just honor that position and duty by coming prepared lord because if an army if an army was getting ready for battle and everybody would just halfway prepare and how would they ever win a battle so how do we expect to win a battle if we come halfway prepared because lord you give us specific instructions to put the whole armor of god on the lord i pray that we would put the whole armor of you on daily lord that's the only thing that's going to combat the wiles of the enemy the shield the sword the breastplate we alert our coins up lord and lord there's so many things i know many times i've missed the mark lord and i missed what you wanted me to do lord and lord from this day forward lord i i'm dissolving dedicating lord to spend more time in prayer with you lord not just garbage time prayer but i want to spend true sincere time in prayer lord no matter how tired i am no matter how busy i am let us all make that decoration let us all change let us all just our nature just change day let us make that that solemn dedication from death on to life there's no greater thing than serving you lord not all the money in the world couldn't compare to it lord and lord as we're here today lord we want to just give ourselves to you and we just love you and thank you lord jesus christ name we pray amen let us sing
