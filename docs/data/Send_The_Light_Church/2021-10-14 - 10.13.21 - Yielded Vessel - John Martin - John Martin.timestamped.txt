[0:00] the terrible thing about being gifted
[0:05] because he liked that other angels were
[0:08] looking up to him
[0:12] instead of realizing
[0:14] that
[0:15] god had created me that way and the only
[0:17] way i'm here and not there is because
[0:19] god created me here and not there
[0:27] so no wonder he drew a third of the
[0:29] angels away from god
[0:33] just with his
[0:36] his brightness i mean
[0:39] can you imagine some
[0:41] hobo some
[0:43] um
[0:44] um
[0:46] bomb
[0:47] some person comes in here with
[0:50] or comes into knocks at your door at
[0:52] your house i'm saying
[0:54] and he has
[0:56] a bent up car
[0:59] and he comes in he says i want to be a
[1:02] financial advisor for you
[1:06] you're going to say no thank you
[1:09] no thank you i'm a little bit better off
[1:11] than you are
[1:13] if satan was just this black and dark
[1:16] when he was up in heaven i don't think a
[1:18] third of the angels would have went with
[1:20] him
[1:22] he had an ability
[1:25] he was gifted
[1:27] and all around him could see it
[1:30] lucifer enticed the most subtle beast
[1:34] to bring forth a seed that would be more
[1:38] intellectual than his
[1:41] limited abilities because remember this
[1:43] more subtle beast was nothing
[1:45] like
[1:47] uh
[1:49] adam and eve were created in god's image
[1:52] so he had the ability
[1:55] to convince
[1:56] that if you just
[1:59] uh
[2:00] if you just here he goes if you just you
[2:03] just have this act you all know what i
[2:05] mean because this thing's going on uh uh
[2:09] and and and you do this you'll be able
[2:11] to bring forth a seed that is more uh
[2:14] smarter than the one that you are
[2:17] and he knew that and that this
[2:20] lucifer had the ability to do that and
[2:22] this most self to obese he just lent
[2:23] himself over to the idea
[2:27] but then he comes along and he works on
[2:29] the other end with eve
[2:32] because the most left obese just you
[2:33] know
[2:35] had to be anointed with the same
[2:37] anointed
[2:39] to convince eve
[2:44] don't you know that
[2:46] you're going to be in control of your
[2:49] destiny and have all the many kisses you
[2:51] want to have
[2:53] you can have them whenever you want to
[2:54] you can be in control
[2:58] and that was
[2:59] brother brandon said she lusted for
[3:02] knowledge
[3:08] and he was telling her something
[3:10] different than what the bible what god
[3:12] was telling think about that that's why
[3:15] it's dangerous to want to hear something
[3:17] new all the time
[3:19] the only thing we should want new is
[3:21] christ new in me because it what i what
[3:23] i do have isn't getting the job done it
[3:25] ain't getting rid of the devil in my
[3:27] life and knowledge about new things just
[3:29] don't do it
[3:37] paul knowing
[3:39] how powerful
[3:42] how powerfully deceitful satan was and
[3:45] still is
[3:46] expressed his concern in second
[3:48] corinthians chapter 11 verse 3 he says
[3:51] but i fear
[3:53] lest by any means as the serpent
[3:56] beguiled eve through his subtlety so
[3:59] your mind should be corrupted from the
[4:01] simplicity that's in christ
[4:05] you know all she had to do was just
[4:08] believe
[4:10] the word
[4:11] that's all she had to do
[4:14] but satan today has the ability to
[4:18] convince us that we don't have to do all
[4:20] the word
[4:22] and he does that because satan has a
[4:25] gift he has gifts he has abilities today
[4:28] and he uses them
[4:30] in our mind he gives us he shoots
[4:33] thoughts in there
[4:38] second corinthians chapter 11 verse 13.
[4:42] for such
[4:44] are false prophets
[4:46] deceitful workers
[4:48] transforming themselves into the
[4:51] apostles of christ
[4:54] and no marvel for satan himself is
[4:57] transformed into an angel
[5:00] of light
[5:03] the bible says that satan
[5:05] corrupted his wisdom
[5:07] by a reason of his brightness he his his
[5:11] when god made him god made him perfect
[5:13] his wisdom was peaceable gentle easy to
[5:17] be true without partiality it was god's
[5:20] wisdom
[5:22] but because of his brightness
[5:26] it corrupted his wisdom into central
[5:30] devilish respect to persons trying to
[5:33] get something out of somebody
[5:35] you catching what i'm saying
[5:37] there's two different kinds
[5:41] he was more beautiful more brighter than
[5:44] all the other angels that god created
[5:47] verse 15 therefore it is no great thing
[5:50] if his ministers also
[5:53] be transformed
[5:55] as ministers of righteousness
[5:59] whose end shall be according to their
[6:04] works so his ministers look like
[6:08] ministers of righteousness think about
[6:10] this statement that we're hearing today
[6:14] god gives him a gift i mean we know
[6:17] the beatles we're gifted elvis presley
[6:21] was gifted there's many people gifted
[6:24] and they yield to that gift
[6:27] but they don't yield their life to god
[6:30] and so a minister can can minister just
[6:33] absolutely
[6:34] wonderful and beautiful
[6:37] there's just something there you'll
[6:39] you've got to be in tune
[6:41] you've got to be in to with the holy
[6:42] ghost
[6:46] yielding to our gifts and our abilities
[6:48] can have absolutely nothing to do with
[6:50] yielding our lives to god
[6:54] this message is about us yielding
[6:57] our vessel to god
[7:00] look at the concern paul had for those
[7:02] who were going to be left behind after
[7:04] he left in acts chapter 20 verse 29
[7:08] keeping in this same vein here you know
[7:10] me laying a long foundation
[7:13] acts chapter 20 verse 29 for i know this
[7:16] that after my departure shall grievous
[7:19] wolves enter in among
[7:22] you
[7:24] not sparing the flock
[7:28] grievous woofs right
[7:30] in sheep's clothing
[7:33] they're going to enter right in amongst
[7:35] us
[7:36] and they do not care about the souls of
[7:39] others
[7:40] not sparing the flock
[7:43] they have something else in mind
[7:45] he said also
[7:47] of your own selves
[7:50] among us
[7:53] shall men arise
[7:56] speaking perverse things
[8:00] for what purpose
[8:03] just like satan
[8:05] drew a third of the angels the bible
[8:07] says to draw away disciples after them
[8:11] now notice this is a spirit
[8:15] it's not like oh it's obvious
[8:19] badge
[8:20] no they're spirits
[8:27] therefore
[8:29] watch
[8:30] and remember that by the space of three
[8:32] years
[8:34] i ceased not to warn everyone
[8:39] night and day
[8:41] with tears
[8:43] this was a real situation a real thing
[8:46] it wasn't just oh here i just stick this
[8:48] little prayer request on our little app
[8:50] and you know
[8:52] no this was a real thing it taught him
[8:55] in tears of night and day it was a real
[8:58] thing
[8:59] because he cared
[9:01] he cared for the flock
[9:08] we can't look at gifts
[9:11] we can't even look at our own gifts
[9:14] we can't look at our own callings
[9:16] our own abilities
[9:18] we have to look at our life
[9:20] we have to look at the life that we're
[9:21] yielding to god every day
[9:23] that's what's important that's what god
[9:25] is interested in
[9:30] we can yield our gift to god the one
[9:33] that he gave us and not yield our heart
[9:36] to god
[9:38] think about that
[9:40] we all want god to use us
[9:42] right
[9:43] god use me god use me
[9:46] what about god have my heart
[9:51] because when god uses us we got a chance
[9:53] of somebody recognizing it
[9:56] we got a chance of feeling good
[9:58] but god used my heart lay down your life
[10:00] for somebody that everybody nobody will
[10:02] ever ever know
[10:06] the bible tells us that gifts and
[10:08] callings are without repentance
[10:10] but relationships
[10:12] i'm going to say but with relationships
[10:14] there's going to be lots of repentance
[10:17] jesus said be zealous and repent
[10:20] just just keep it part of your order
[10:24] always remember it's more important whom
[10:26] you surrender to
[10:28] than what gift you surrender to
[10:32] romans chapter 6 verse 16 romans chapter
[10:35] 6 verse 16 know ye not that to whom you
[10:38] healed yourself servants to obey
[10:42] his servant
[10:44] ye are to whom you obey
[10:47] whether of sin unto death or unto
[10:49] obedience unto righteousness
[10:52] didn't we sing a song
[10:54] today
[10:56] if you want to be great
[10:58] learn to be the servant
[11:03] whom
[11:04] whom think about whom
[11:06] there's just one of two trees
[11:08] we can be talking to hundreds of people
[11:10] we can be exercising lots of different
[11:12] gifts but whom is just one or two
[11:14] spirits
[11:15] are you with me tree of life
[11:17] tree of knowledge
[11:20] now notice
[11:21] we will always have a choice in whom we
[11:23] yield to
[11:27] now yielding to god
[11:28] isn't very easy
[11:31] when we haven't died to ourselves
[11:35] james said
[11:36] that the nature that's inside of us it
[11:38] lusteth for what it wants all the time
[11:41] it doesn't it just you can't turn it off
[11:44] you got to just crucify the old man
[11:47] jesus said we have to deny that nature
[11:50] if we're truly going to follow him
[11:53] the book of romans records that our
[11:55] carnal mind is an enemy of god
[11:59] and when we don't care enough to die out
[12:02] that we're in our flesh and when we're
[12:03] in our flesh we can't please god
[12:06] i mean these are some
[12:07] i know we like to just label i'm a
[12:09] christian i'm in the message i love god
[12:12] and let's just stay with that
[12:14] but this this this is
[12:17] we're digging in
[12:19] we're digging in the bride will be a
[12:22] totally yield vessel to god and only for
[12:25] god
[12:28] we could have a desire to yield to god
[12:31] but not as strong enough
[12:33] to actually
[12:34] do it now this is important we all have
[12:36] a desire to you to god but if that
[12:39] desire is not strong enough we just
[12:41] simply ain't going to do it
[12:44] how many times you hear you you talk to
[12:46] people oh yeah i like i i'd like to go
[12:48] to church i like to do i like to do that
[12:50] i i want to pray more i want to be more
[12:52] spiritual i want to help i want i want
[12:54] to want to want to want to
[12:57] that's not good enough
[13:01] it's not good enough to say well
[13:03] i desire to yield my life to god
[13:07] imagine for a moment if the three hebrew
[13:10] children said i really i really want to
[13:12] yield my life to god but i'm afraid if
[13:14] i'm going to suffer and die so
[13:18] it wasn't good enough that they just had
[13:20] a desire to you to god that's got to be
[13:23] strong enough that you're willing to
[13:25] suffer you're willing to die you don't
[13:26] know what's going to happen but you know
[13:29] god's with you
[13:32] now i think we're just very very
[13:35] soft brother branham said in this age
[13:38] just soft
[13:41] don't get don't want to hurt you know
[13:44] just don't step on anybody's toes be
[13:46] careful how you speak and
[13:49] i believe in talking with grace i
[13:51] believe in being a a christian and
[13:54] loving i believe that
[13:57] but i'm talking about we ought to have
[13:59] enough grace when somebody doesn't do
[14:00] something just right we ought to still
[14:02] better love them amen
[14:05] we also better treat them in such a way
[14:07] as if they never did anything wrong
[14:17] if they
[14:19] said you know what god knows my heart
[14:22] god knows i don't i don't want to serve
[14:24] other god but i can't die i can't do any
[14:26] good down here if i if i die you know
[14:28] what they would have did they would have
[14:30] bowed to the wrong god
[14:33] when we miss church and we can be here
[14:36] we're bowing to the wrong god
[14:40] when we have time to listen to a tape to
[14:42] read our bible to pray to go out witness
[14:44] to somebody and we choose a comfortable
[14:47] way we're bowing to the wrong god
[14:56] when you want to yield yourself to god
[14:59] it requires such a strong love for him
[15:02] that nothing can distract you from
[15:04] obeying his will
[15:08] we can have all sorts of gifts and
[15:09] abilities and a very little strength to
[15:12] yield her life to god because it's quite
[15:14] simple
[15:16] quite simple for all my
[15:18] christian
[15:20] uh
[15:21] life i
[15:22] before i was even a pastor
[15:26] for years i would see people that would
[15:29] just be so excited about doing specials
[15:35] it was just
[15:37] it was it was just something
[15:40] about being up in front of somebody
[15:42] doing a special
[15:45] but i just can't imagine
[15:47] how they would feel if god says i just
[15:50] want you to go do this thing
[15:55] doing it for the same god
[15:59] trying to bring him glory
[16:02] but why are we excited about giving god
[16:04] glory in front of people
[16:07] what is that that's the same thing
[16:09] lucifer had
[16:11] yes
[16:13] it's no different
[16:15] it's not about you and our gifts it's
[16:17] about yielding our lives
[16:23] usually it's easy and enjoyable
[16:27] to yield herself
[16:30] with a gift
[16:33] but when it comes time to lay down our
[16:35] lives for the cause of the word
[16:39] it comes
[16:40] quite difficult
[16:42] quite difficult i don't i don't got time
[16:45] to do that i'm busy
[16:48] you know what i
[16:50] i asked somebody two years ago to come
[16:52] to church and you know they just don't
[16:54] seem to want to come
[16:57] what are we called to
[17:05] john described
[17:10] this word coming into us as sweet
[17:16] amen amen amen amen to the word but
[17:19] bitter when it became a part of his life
[17:23] it's much harder to live this word
[17:25] than to to agree with it
[17:27] when a minister is preaching it from the
[17:29] pulpit
[17:32] yielding has everything to do with the
[17:35] choice that you're making what direction
[17:37] you're going to go
[17:39] often we don't yield to the lord
[17:42] because of our feelings our emotions our
[17:43] attitudes or our understanding
[17:48] now this i don't under i
[17:51] what do you mean be nice to this person
[17:53] who's being mean to me i don't
[17:54] comprehend that
[17:58] it's i mean hey look the publicans you
[18:01] know they're nice to those that are nice
[18:03] to him
[18:04] see if the feelings and emotions and
[18:06] everything lines up then it's easy
[18:09] to you to do what we would consider the
[18:11] right thing
[18:13] but oftentimes we don't yield to the
[18:14] lord because our our feelings our
[18:17] emotions things disagree with us inside
[18:20] internally
[18:21] so therefore we just kind of shrug it
[18:23] off
[18:25] proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 says trust in
[18:27] the lord
[18:28] with all thine heart
[18:30] and lean not to thine own understanding
[18:35] we will either
[18:37] lean or yield
[18:40] towards our understanding or towards the
[18:42] lord
[18:44] one or the other
[18:47] in all thy ways acknowledge him
[18:50] and he shall direct thy paths
[18:53] if we're looking for more direction
[18:56] in our lives it's real simple choose to
[18:59] trust
[19:01] this is what the scripture says
[19:03] we're not used to that we're used to
[19:05] just
[19:07] getting the answer without trusting
[19:11] we must choose to yield to god's way of
[19:14] doing things
[19:15] and his way of doing things he wants to
[19:17] be first
[19:20] you when you trust him you're yielding
[19:22] to him
[19:25] verse 7 be not wise
[19:27] in your own eyes don't try to figure it
[19:30] out
[19:32] but fear the lord and depart from evil
[19:38] it's evil for you to figure it out
[19:44] it is not evil
[19:46] for you not to know
[19:48] and to trust
[19:51] in god's time he will show you
[19:54] he will lead you
[19:56] he will make it known
[19:58] he just he's he's more interested in you
[20:01] learning to trust him
[20:03] than you are figuring out so you can go
[20:05] on
[20:07] are you with me
[20:08] it's all about a relationship
[20:12] remember when the lord showed peter
[20:15] that god was no respecter persons
[20:18] right that he was it wasn't just for the
[20:20] jews
[20:22] but it was for the gentiles first it was
[20:24] like no no i'm not going to ever eat
[20:26] anything bad i'm not going to pray
[20:28] anything wrong in me
[20:33] what would happen if he leaned to his
[20:34] own understanding
[20:37] he heard the word
[20:39] and he yielded to the word
[20:43] and he became the word
[20:47] remember when the lord was teaching
[20:49] brother brother brandon the same thing
[20:51] early in his ministry
[20:53] that god was no respecter persons
[20:56] when god told him to go preach
[20:58] the word go to the pentecostals and and
[21:01] go no we're not going to be associated
[21:04] with that
[21:05] remember that
[21:08] god is always teaching us not to be a
[21:10] respecter persons
[21:13] but look what happened he yielded to the
[21:16] wrong thing
[21:17] and look what it caused him
[21:20] that one
[21:21] we think it was well
[21:23] it was the will of god he went against
[21:25] the will of god how many times do we go
[21:27] against the will of god
[21:29] it's the grace of god that we're all
[21:31] families aren't destroyed
[21:36] god does not want us to be a respecter
[21:38] persons
[21:42] when the lord wanted brother branham to
[21:43] stop shooting deer for other brothers
[21:45] and sisters
[21:48] he could have leaned to his own
[21:49] understanding but no he yielded to what
[21:52] god said
[21:54] with his life and it was hard because he
[21:56] still had brothers and sisters coming up
[21:58] to him would you get me a deer you're
[21:59] going out there i know you're a good
[22:00] deer you know i don't i i'm just a widow
[22:02] i
[22:04] the lord said no
[22:09] we have a chance every day to you to the
[22:11] lord
[22:16] remember when the ministers wanted to
[22:18] know
[22:19] more about brother branham's gift that
[22:21] he used
[22:24] brother branham he yielded or leaned to
[22:27] his own understanding and he began to
[22:29] try to teach them
[22:33] and it got it got him in trouble
[22:36] all of a sudden there was impersonators
[22:38] everywhere
[22:40] come on up here i'll just pray over you
[22:45] yeah i got the same thing that
[22:50] yielding to the gift but wouldn't want
[22:51] to lay down their life
[23:02] just being a teacher at heart i've
[23:04] always
[23:05] wanted to try to help people understand
[23:10] brother brown was a great teacher
[23:15] he leaned to his own understanding and
[23:17] he tried to teach certain things
[23:21] that god told them
[23:24] to
[23:25] i'll say immature christians
[23:30] and god told them he says you can't
[23:32] teach pentecostal babies spiritual
[23:34] things think about this
[23:38] god called them pentecostal babies
[23:41] that you can't well we think spiritual
[23:43] is just you know
[23:45] slain in the spirit one end to the other
[23:47] and speaking in tongues and
[23:53] i wonder
[23:55] why god called him babies
[24:00] first corinthians chapter 2 verse 14
[24:03] first corinthians chapter 2 verse 14 but
[24:05] the natural man receiveth not the things
[24:08] of the spirit of god for they are
[24:10] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[24:12] them why
[24:14] because they're spiritually discerned we
[24:16] have to be careful
[24:17] of trying
[24:18] to
[24:20] tell somebody something that they're not
[24:23] ready for
[24:27] how many times have you told somebody
[24:29] left right up down backwards front words
[24:31] every possible way they say yes i get it
[24:34] yes and they just don't get it
[24:41] the things have to come from god
[24:43] revelation comes from god
[24:48] remember when brother branham expressed
[24:52] that the jews knew the sign of a messiah
[24:57] and that he just he felt you know to go
[25:01] and tell those jews because he had so
[25:04] many people were rejecting in the
[25:06] gentile realm
[25:07] his gift
[25:10] he said all the jews they know this they
[25:13] know the sign of a messiah
[25:16] they'll receive it
[25:17] and he was in his thoughts and mind and
[25:20] heart and desire he leaned towards going
[25:23] there and giving them that sign
[25:27] and it wasn't until he was getting ready
[25:28] to get on the plane
[25:30] that god said
[25:33] don't go
[25:36] it's okay that we get off in 15 other
[25:39] directions that we shouldn't be going
[25:41] but understand that god is there
[25:43] speaking and it's our responsibility to
[25:46] yield to him
[25:48] to be a united vessel one that's
[25:51] adaptable ready to change instant in
[25:53] season and out of season ready ready for
[25:56] the service of the lord
[25:59] it's not about us just
[26:01] prepping and preparing for some special
[26:04] thing that i'm going to do this one time
[26:07] no it's 24 7. lord make me a vessel and
[26:12] use me for your glory and honor every
[26:14] day god wants to use a united vessel
[26:19] i just brought out all these things that
[26:21] happened to brother branham's life to
[26:22] show you that he wasn't exempt from this
[26:26] when god's trying to teach us this it
[26:28] isn't because we're down here and
[26:30] brother branham was up there no he went
[26:31] through the same experiences
[26:35] we just need we need to be real we can't
[26:37] just say i'm a universal because my name
[26:39] is john martin and i go to said the
[26:41] light church and i'm in the message
[26:43] that don't mean one thing
[26:46] don't mean one thing
[26:49] what's my life doing every day what am i
[26:52] yielding to every day
[26:55] am i yielding a vessel to him
[27:00] yielding has everything
[27:02] to do with choosing the direction
[27:06] that you're going so brother i was going
[27:08] to go this way
[27:10] and god said no go this way
[27:12] he healed it to it is that simple
[27:16] god will let us go
[27:18] in our way that we think is right
[27:23] for a season
[27:26] and then he'll stop it
[27:30] and
[27:31] er
[27:33] every way of a man is right in his own
[27:36] eyes
[27:38] that's the thing that
[27:41] we
[27:42] we need to be so careful with every
[27:44] single day we we feel we got the right
[27:46] thing to do we're going in the right
[27:47] direction
[27:52] to stay and remain humble i could be
[27:54] wrong about this
[27:57] that's a united vessel
[27:59] a vessel that says i could be wrong is a
[28:02] healed and vessel to god
[28:05] a vessel that's got it all figured out
[28:12] god doesn't make any one of us do things
[28:17] he will not be guilty of having any
[28:19] robots in heaven
[28:21] forcing anything
[28:24] but
[28:25] god will put us in situations to help us
[28:27] understand that we need to make another
[28:29] decision
[28:31] and jonah to me is a perfect example of
[28:34] that
[28:36] jonah had yielded to his way
[28:38] i'm out of here i'm not dealing with
[28:39] this responsibility
[28:43] and god put him in a situation
[28:47] that he decided to choose
[28:51] god's way
[28:53] i'm he's thankful for that
[28:56] our own understanding is limited
[28:59] it's lacking
[29:01] it's often distorted with emotions
[29:04] and our own agenda sometimes we got our
[29:06] own agenda we want to try to manipulate
[29:10] therefore it can be evil
[29:14] our own understanding can be evil
[29:17] and often is that's why the scripture
[29:20] says be not wise in your eyes fear the
[29:21] lord and depart from evil
[29:28] we can see it lucifer and he did a bad
[29:29] thing
[29:30] can we see it in ourselves
[29:34] because we're putting the same spot
[29:37] eutene has everything to do with
[29:40] choosing what direction you're going to
[29:41] take that's why
[29:42] it's always better to only believe
[29:44] instead of saying
[29:47] do you you know you got to understand it
[29:50] i'll never forget this brother brother
[29:52] johnson was sharing his testimony when
[29:54] he was being introduced to the prophet
[29:57] and he couldn't deny the miraculous
[29:59] things that were happening he was very
[30:01] high in the pentecostal ranks
[30:03] and he went to seek in the lord to find
[30:05] out
[30:07] what god wanted to do about this
[30:09] decision that had to be made about
[30:11] brother branham and he said well
[30:13] some say
[30:14] that
[30:16] he's just a a false prophet and
[30:20] and um he's just
[30:22] uh
[30:24] way off the deep end and some say that
[30:26] this fella he's god
[30:34] and
[30:36] lord
[30:39] is this man
[30:41] true i don't understand these things
[30:43] that he's saying
[30:45] and god spoke to him
[30:47] and said
[30:52] do not say i do not understand
[30:55] say i
[30:56] believe
[31:00] we don't have to understand we don't
[31:01] have to lean to that understanding of
[31:04] all we need to know is what does god
[31:06] believe it and yield to it
[31:09] i'm so glad when i came to this message
[31:12] i was not bombarded with having to prove
[31:15] everything that the prophet said
[31:19] i was stupid enough to believe it
[31:25] believe in the lord thy god so shall thy
[31:28] be established believe in his prophets
[31:30] and so shall you prosper
[31:34] believe
[31:36] believe
[31:37] don't lean to understanding
[31:39] a lot of times
[31:41] i
[31:42] i mean
[31:44] as you know i've had workers work for me
[31:45] and brother ron you've probably
[31:47] experienced this and me as parents maybe
[31:49] of all under of experiences to some
[31:52] degree
[31:53] when you ask somebody to do something
[31:55] if you have to
[31:56] tell them and explain to them why every
[31:59] time
[32:02] and then try to convince them that this
[32:04] is the right thing to do
[32:08] so imagine god don't owe us an
[32:09] explanation
[32:11] he don't have to explain everything
[32:17] just believe he's coming soon
[32:20] only belief
[32:24] let's talk about some ways
[32:26] to help us yield ourselves to the lord
[32:29] eating is as simple as making a choice
[32:32] yet it's as difficult as the temptation
[32:34] that sits before you
[32:36] if we have just to make a little choice
[32:38] we'll go to church on wednesday
[32:40] well that's easy to serve that's easy to
[32:42] yield to that
[32:44] if god says
[32:45] you know you're going in
[32:47] you're being faced with the fiery
[32:48] furnace god hasn't spoken to you what
[32:50] are you gonna do
[32:52] that becomes more difficult so think
[32:54] about the difficult trials that you have
[32:57] think about the times that you're
[32:58] getting screened at yelled at
[33:01] threatened
[33:02] think about these moments
[33:06] is the choice you have to make at that
[33:08] moment
[33:11] we all love god
[33:15] homie loves god
[33:18] but do we all love him the same degree
[33:22] do we
[33:23] no we don't
[33:29] but i believe shadrach meshach and
[33:31] abednego loved god
[33:33] with all their heart
[33:36] because they were able to yield their
[33:38] bodies
[33:39] in the most difficult
[33:41] situation
[33:44] now
[33:45] we're all in the process of becoming so
[33:48] in love with god that would do anything
[33:50] at any time at his will
[33:54] we're in that process
[33:56] and we're talking about how we can
[33:58] become
[34:00] a more yielded vessel for him
[34:05] in any of the ten commandments
[34:08] they don't say love god
[34:10] another ten commandments you cannot see
[34:12] where it says love god
[34:16] but it's the only way that you obey him
[34:18] in every situation
[34:22] deuteronomy 5 7 says thou shalt have no
[34:25] other gods before me this is the first
[34:27] commandment thou shall not have any
[34:29] other gods before me in order for me to
[34:31] fulfill that i have to love him
[34:34] why because my nature wants to love
[34:37] anything else that it wants
[34:41] so it's going to take love for that
[34:43] now lucifer
[34:45] wanted to be god
[34:47] isaiah 14 verse 12 says how are thou
[34:50] fallen from heaven oh lucifer's son of
[34:51] the morning for thou hast said in thy
[34:53] heart i will exalt my throne above the
[34:55] stars of god i will ascend above the
[34:57] heights of the cause i will be like the
[34:59] most high
[35:06] he
[35:08] wanted to do what he wanted
[35:10] therefore he became
[35:12] his god
[35:16] just by the mere fact of him doing what
[35:18] he wanted to do
[35:22] now we were born with the same nature
[35:25] and that's to do our will
[35:28] and when we do our own will
[35:30] we have put ourselves above
[35:33] god
[35:37] so if you don't want to turn the cheek
[35:40] you don't want to pray for those that
[35:41] despitefully use you
[35:43] you don't want to lay down your life for
[35:45] others
[35:46] i mean the list is endless
[35:50] you're putting yourself above god
[35:54] now
[35:54] this message is about becoming a united
[35:57] vessel
[35:58] now we're in the midst of this situation
[36:01] all these things are happening to us we
[36:03] we know what's right we know what's
[36:04] wrong we try to do good evil as
[36:06] president how do i get myself to yield
[36:09] to god
[36:12] god gave us an antidote to become a
[36:14] united vessel
[36:17] jesus never said
[36:19] you'll be fine with just a desire
[36:22] he says i love you i love the world
[36:24] you'll be fine he never said that
[36:27] he never said just keep trying turn over
[36:29] a new late make another resolution
[36:31] no sir
[36:33] he said you got to get bored again
[36:39] now it's important for us to search the
[36:41] scriptures to learn what that really
[36:43] means to be born again
[36:46] the new birth starts with accepting
[36:48] jesus christ into our lives
[36:51] by repentance
[36:53] and baptism
[36:54] confession jesus christ is my lord
[36:58] but the new birth ends
[37:00] with christ in complete control of your
[37:04] will
[37:08] so we we we have defined the beginning
[37:11] we have defined the end
[37:16] now
[37:18] in uh
[37:21] brother mark brought out that
[37:24] god placed a seed inside of us
[37:27] in our men's meeting
[37:29] and that seed was a germ of god
[37:32] and until that is fully
[37:34] manifested it's not where it needs to be
[37:39] so when we repent we get baptized
[37:42] in in the
[37:43] if we died that one moment we'd be born
[37:46] again as much as we could be
[37:50] job said i will not be satisfied with
[37:53] this until i awake
[37:55] over here in his likeness
[38:01] so to get from there to there something
[38:03] has to happen
[38:04] god isn't lacking the preaching isn't
[38:06] lacking the message isn't lacking
[38:09] the gifts that god has given us isn't
[38:11] lacking what's lacking a united vessel
[38:14] that's what's lacking getting
[38:16] here learning
[38:19] to you to the lord
[38:22] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17
[38:24] says therefore if any man be in christ
[38:26] he's a new creature all things are
[38:27] passed away behold all things are become
[38:30] new
[38:31] how many
[38:35] can say
[38:37] that all things have become new all
[38:40] things
[38:41] all things i know most
[38:44] but all
[38:46] verse 18 in all things are of god
[38:51] all things in other words his will
[38:53] is completely being done
[38:55] every decision you make
[38:57] every direction you go every plan every
[38:59] goal
[39:00] all things are of god you have no
[39:02] control
[39:07] you're no longer in control of your life
[39:09] but god is
[39:12] who reconciled us to himself by jesus
[39:14] christ and he's given them to us a
[39:16] ministry
[39:18] now he's given us another responsibility
[39:20] no wonder we don't got time to get it
[39:22] done
[39:24] because we're still hanging on to our
[39:25] will but if you give up your will you've
[39:27] got time for god's ministry
[39:34] i just want to say this so you
[39:36] understand the new birth is an ongoing
[39:38] process in our lives
[39:43] yes
[39:44] it's there it's done
[39:46] but
[39:47] no it's not it's still happening
[39:51] because we need a balance so often we
[39:54] were comfortable with saying i'm born
[39:55] again i'm a born-again christian
[39:59] how about i'm in the process of growing
[40:02] every day like i wasn't yesterday
[40:05] i'm a new better i'm a new creature
[40:07] today than i was last week
[40:11] this to me is evidence
[40:13] of truly being born again
[40:20] even if we have been sealed with the
[40:22] holy ghost unto the day of redemption
[40:24] we are still in the process of all
[40:27] things becoming god's will for our lives
[40:31] until all things are of god
[40:34] i wish the whole
[40:36] congregation would have said amen to
[40:38] that because that to me just takes away
[40:41] every excuse that we have
[40:44] of not giving our all to jesus christ
[40:46] and pressing in for more of him
[40:51] if you're wanting to see more of god in
[40:53] your life
[40:54] we've got to get away from all the
[40:55] iniquities that are in our life
[41:06] psalms 51 tells us that we were
[41:09] born in sin shapen in iniquity formed
[41:13] into
[41:14] the evil creatures
[41:18] shape in other words
[41:20] um
[41:25] when we're born we're really
[41:28] not born doing iniquity
[41:30] because we don't know better yet we got
[41:32] to get to that age of accountability so
[41:34] as we're creeping up to that age we hit
[41:36] that age and after that age we're
[41:39] learning
[41:40] to be formed
[41:42] i was talking to a banker today's ahead
[41:44] of a bank and they merged with another
[41:46] bank
[41:48] and he told me
[41:50] he says
[41:52] 7 out of 10 businesses
[41:55] work their business under the table
[41:59] 7 out of 10.
[42:03] he said no i don't say nothing but i see
[42:04] it they tell me and this is what they're
[42:06] doing
[42:07] think about that
[42:09] born and sent shapen in iniquity
[42:13] simply and jesus said in the last days
[42:15] iniquity would abound what is that not
[42:18] doing what you know you should do
[42:23] and because of that the love of many
[42:26] would wax cold
[42:29] iniquity is here it's in our lives it's
[42:31] just it's being willing to look at it
[42:34] what are the things going on in my
[42:36] lifetime just does it matter
[42:42] ephesians tells us that we all had our
[42:44] conversations in times past fulfilling
[42:48] the lust of our flesh
[42:51] but in second timothy chapter 2 verse 19
[42:53] the bible says never left the foundation
[42:55] of god sure having this seal the lord
[42:58] knows them that are his
[43:01] the lord knows
[43:03] now if you think
[43:05] you're his
[43:08] let everyone that nameth the name of
[43:10] christ do what depart from iniquity
[43:15] i'll tell you if i had to do this so
[43:17] many times
[43:19] i am a perfect candidate of this
[43:24] now when we think of iniquity we think
[43:26] of like some really bad things
[43:32] but if we want to be a united vessel to
[43:35] god
[43:36] we've got to
[43:37] we got to depart from certain things
[43:41] draw nigh to god he'll draw nigh to you
[43:46] we try to make it in and become the
[43:48] model christian through knowledge we're
[43:50] going to miss it
[43:51] because we've got to take these things
[43:53] that we're hearing and put them into use
[43:55] the next day
[43:57] and be eager lord you know when i'm
[43:59] being tested i want to pass this test
[44:04] the way to speed up this process in our
[44:06] life is to become a united vessel put
[44:09] away
[44:10] the things that you know
[44:12] that you don't think is that important
[44:15] god wants you to be doing
[44:18] put away that attitude
[44:20] put away the thought process this is not
[44:22] a big deal it's not a not a big thing
[44:27] fall more in love
[44:29] with jesus that's all i can say fall
[44:31] more in love with jesus
[44:33] that's the only way we're going to yield
[44:34] to them more i mean we can come to
[44:37] church and think it's a law i got to get
[44:39] here a half hour early so i'm here a
[44:40] half hour early
[44:42] or we can come here with a love get in
[44:44] the prayer closet get ahold of god
[44:47] get ready for the word so the word can
[44:49] fall on some good ground
[44:51] my my heart is not good because my name
[44:53] is john martin
[44:57] my heart is good if i empty out of my
[44:59] junk i get everything out i humble
[45:01] myself i repent i'm zealous i say lord
[45:04] take and squeeze every bounce of the
[45:06] world out of me
[45:09] then the word can fall on good ground
[45:13] god will not change us unless we hate
[45:16] ourselves
[45:18] thank you brother mark you may have to
[45:20] say amen for the whole church it's a
[45:22] little bit quiet today
[45:33] we've got to hate ourself
[45:36] to let the love of god come in
[45:40] they do work simultaneously
[45:44] change doesn't happen by coming to
[45:45] church
[45:46] doesn't happen by just listening to the
[45:48] word
[45:49] or you fill in the blank put it whatever
[45:50] you want to put in there
[45:52] change is a result formed from a love
[45:55] affair between you and god
[45:58] he said if you love me keep my
[46:00] commandments well i'm not going to come
[46:02] here today and preach to you
[46:04] the 12th commandment
[46:07] to get you to obey it so you can prove
[46:09] to god
[46:10] that you love him
[46:13] no we got to do the first ten
[46:16] but if you do the 11th commandment
[46:20] which really what jesus said was the
[46:21] first commandment
[46:24] which is what we're talking about is
[46:25] loving the lord
[46:31] it's a love affair
[46:34] where we put
[46:37] our love for what we want aside
[46:40] and we take up
[46:43] a love for what god wants us to do
[46:46] that's the way you become muted look we
[46:48] all can be just specialists and yield
[46:51] into a gift
[46:52] god gave me this gift and i'm going to
[46:54] yield to it
[46:56] what good will that do
[47:01] let's say
[47:03] brother jason
[47:04] had a gift of speaking in tongues
[47:08] and he could yield to that gift and
[47:10] speak in tongues
[47:14] what are we going to do spend 24 hours
[47:16] speaking in tongues
[47:20] that's yielding the gift we're talking
[47:22] about you in our life this is a
[47:23] completely different thought process
[47:25] here today
[47:27] deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 5 says and
[47:29] thou shalt love the lord thy god
[47:32] with all thine heart with all thy soul
[47:36] and with all thy
[47:38] might
[47:41] that's a lot
[47:45] now god will not come by every 10
[47:48] minutes of your life and tell you don't
[47:49] forget love me don't forget love me
[47:51] don't forget love me
[47:52] you've got to make it to choice today
[47:54] what direction you want to move
[47:56] what direction you want to yield to
[47:59] and these words which i command thee
[48:01] this day shall be in thine heart this is
[48:04] the problem do we take the word home
[48:06] with us do we go home and say sweetheart
[48:09] this is what the word of god said this
[48:11] is what we need to do this is what i
[48:13] want our home to be we need to get
[48:15] filled with the love of god
[48:19] and thou shalt teach them diligently
[48:21] unto thy children
[48:22] and thou shalt talk of them when thou
[48:24] sittest in thy house and when they'll
[48:26] walk us by the way when they'll lie us
[48:28] down and when that rises up
[48:30] love love love love that's it
[48:35] be good if we could just turn off
[48:37] all the other stations in our life
[48:40] and turn on
[48:43] loving the lord with all we have
[48:46] and thou shalt bind them
[48:48] for a sign
[48:50] upon thy hand
[48:51] and they shall be as frontlets between
[48:54] thine eyes and
[48:55] thou shall write them upon the post of
[48:57] the house and on their gates
[49:00] this love is the key to being able to
[49:03] become a more yielded vessel without it
[49:07] what are we going to do to at most yield
[49:10] our gift
[49:11] yield the gifts that god gave us that's
[49:13] that's it
[49:16] and the reason we're doing that is
[49:17] because we get something out of it but
[49:19] when you yield your life you don't get
[49:21] nothing out of it you're it's an
[49:23] expression of love to god
[49:29] there has to be a hate for yourself it's
[49:31] so strong
[49:34] and a love for him so strong
[49:37] it it can't be just i'll just try to
[49:39] love god a little bit more it'll never
[49:41] become united
[49:44] jeremiah chapter 29 verse 12 says then
[49:47] shall ye call upon me
[49:50] and ye shall go
[49:52] and you shall pray
[49:54] and i will hearken on you
[49:58] and you shall seek me
[50:00] and you shall find me
[50:02] when you shall search for me
[50:04] with all your heart
[50:10] we've got to yield
[50:12] the rest of the heart that we're not
[50:14] yielding to
[50:16] the rest of the life that we're not
[50:17] yielding to
[50:20] why is it a struggle
[50:22] when god speaks something to our heart
[50:26] and we just kind of ignore like not a
[50:28] big thing
[50:29] what's going on there
[50:32] we shouldn't have to like have a sit
[50:34] down meeting about something
[50:39] because we're having sit-down meetings
[50:41] with jesus
[50:44] it shouldn't have to be so like apparent
[50:46] that you know obviously there's a
[50:48] problem no
[50:50] a still small voice speaks to me right
[50:52] here he's wanting me to depart from this
[50:54] he's wanting me to clean up this he's
[50:56] wanting me to do this
[50:58] that's what a united vessel is
[51:02] it's not just
[51:04] going through the motions making it to
[51:05] church doing our daily thing a routine
[51:08] you know such a routine you know a
[51:09] routine you know what that is
[51:11] it's a denomination
[51:16] i believe that we need to daily pray
[51:21] but we need to make sure that we stay
[51:23] there long enough to get in his presence
[51:26] are you with me
[51:29] the bible says that god is love
[51:33] if you want to make
[51:34] more contact with god
[51:36] yield yourself to love
[51:40] god is attracted to love
[51:43] he just wants the love affair he doesn't
[51:45] want a bunch of
[51:47] oh i'll let him into the kingdom because
[51:49] they're obeying me
[51:51] he's got tons of angels for that
[51:54] he created him for that he's looking for
[51:56] a love affair somebody that's just like
[51:58] him
[52:02] he will prove you
[52:03] to see how much you're going to love him
[52:09] the thing i love about god is he doesn't
[52:11] care how many times you fall
[52:13] he's a merciful god
[52:16] he's full of compassion
[52:18] his mercies are new every day
[52:22] he knows our humanity he knows our
[52:24] frailness
[52:25] he don't care how many times
[52:28] we fall
[52:30] he cares if you're going to get up and
[52:33] keep loving him
[52:37] he cares if you're going to yield to him
[52:40] that's what a united vessel does
[52:44] yield your life like the three hebrew
[52:46] children did
[52:47] no matter what the cost was
[52:50] that's what that example was for
[52:53] they yielded their bodies
[52:57] to
[52:58] death paul did that he was facing death
[53:03] he wasn't scared
[53:07] sometimes we're afraid to
[53:11] love somebody
[53:12] because we're going to get hurt
[53:17] what where are we to be
[53:20] we're at the end of the age
[53:22] we're his bride
[53:24] there needs to be a greater expectation
[53:26] out of ourselves
[53:29] not to please the pastor
[53:32] not even to please one another
[53:34] but you having a vision to be his wife
[53:38] visual like yourself as someone that can
[53:41] stand there and be willing to suffer for
[53:44] him
[53:49] shadrach meshach and abednego they
[53:52] yielded their bodies that they might not
[53:55] serve nor worship any god except their
[53:59] own we're faced every day
[54:01] you know we're never going to be tempted
[54:03] to go to a satanist church
[54:08] we make gods out of so many things we
[54:10] don't need to go there
[54:15] turn with me to romans chapter 12. we
[54:17] have the same
[54:18] choice
[54:20] that they had
[54:21] before they went in the furnace and
[54:23] we're going to close with this
[54:25] to yield our bodies
[54:29] verse 1 romans chapter 12 i beseech
[54:32] you that means i invite you
[54:35] and i call you that's all god can do
[54:38] it's up to us what we're going to yield
[54:41] i beseech you therefore
[54:43] brethren
[54:45] by the mercies of god
[54:47] that you present your bodies
[54:49] a living sacrifice
[54:52] holy and acceptable unto god which is
[54:57] the reasonable service
[54:59] i mean you ever go to a restaurant and
[55:01] say how was the service oh it was
[55:02] reasonable
[55:04] you're like well i ain't very good i
[55:06] don't know if i'm going to go there but
[55:07] if you say yeah it's a great service
[55:11] and here it's
[55:13] it's the reasonable thing that we could
[55:15] do for god
[55:17] is is to yield our vessel to him
[55:20] and be not conformed
[55:23] to this world
[55:24] god is inviting us to a love affair
[55:29] he'll never cross through our agency
[55:32] we've got to make the choice but be ye
[55:34] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[55:36] that you may prove what is the good and
[55:39] acceptable and perfect will of god
[55:44] yielding our vessel to christ is the
[55:47] hardest thing to do
[55:50] when we don't love him
[55:52] enough
[55:57] i'm not interested in us becoming better
[55:59] members
[56:00] that's not what this message is for
[56:03] this message is not so i can see you
[56:04] shine a little bit more at church
[56:08] this message is for you when you're not
[56:10] here
[56:11] between you and god
[56:13] because if we learn we learn to yield
[56:16] our life not just a certain aspects of
[56:20] our life
[56:21] or a certain talents or abilities
[56:24] but we yield our life to him
[56:26] he can do great things brother brandon
[56:29] said he could turn the world upside down
[56:31] with just one man
[56:33] yielded to him
[56:35] i
[56:36] want us because of because we're family
[56:40] to be a united vessel
[56:42] for the lord
[56:43] i want him to take us and if he wants to
[56:45] go do something that i don't feel like
[56:47] doing he should have liberty to go do
[56:48] that with my life
[56:51] i i don't want to just sit here in the
[56:53] blessings that god's given us when
[56:55] there's others out there that need to
[56:57] hear the truth
[56:58] what am i going to stand before the lord
[57:00] and say well i did my part
[57:03] who am i to say what my part is
[57:08] if god gives me another day of life
[57:11] he may want me to do something i've
[57:12] never done before
[57:18] so it behooves us
[57:21] to step away from depart from evil
[57:24] depart from our own way of doing things
[57:28] depart from iniquity
[57:30] and just
[57:32] love him
[57:33] hate ourselves love him
[57:35] learn to yield learn to yield
[57:41] you got something you have a hard time
[57:42] with spend a lot of time with him
[57:45] work
[57:46] on yielding to the lord through those
[57:48] times
[57:50] i don't want to stand there and face a
[57:52] fire i don't want to stand there and
[57:54] have some guy like this and say you take
[57:56] this or else
[57:59] we are going to face the these beautiful
[58:01] doors are going to be shut one day
[58:05] i don't know how it's going to happen
[58:07] when it's going to happen
[58:08] but i want to learn to yield my life
[58:10] today to god i want to have i want to
[58:12] have a right nature i want to better
[58:15] handle things the right way i want to
[58:18] better love my enemies i can't do it in
[58:21] my own abilities i've got to yield
[58:22] myself to god
[58:26] god has greater things
[58:30] better things
[58:32] the things that accompany salvation from
[58:34] his bride i believe let's stand together
[58:37] i told you that was the last scripture
[58:38] but i had one look but colt
[58:41] brother adam said in the message it
[58:43] wasn't so from the beginning brother man
[58:45] it says
[58:46] not because your father was something
[58:48] it's what are you
[58:50] every man's got to be born again
[58:53] and this sinful nature
[58:56] killed in him
[58:59] killed in him
[59:01] and a new man born in him
[59:05] which is christ jesus the son of god
[59:08] he's the new man that's born in us
[59:12] not what we're used to i repented got
[59:15] baptized i'm born again
[59:17] no born again is christ in me now
[59:21] i i want i want brother mark to say
[59:24] brother john i see christ in you
[59:28] we want people to seek not just three or
[59:30] four people but everybody
[59:33] right it's easy to get three or four
[59:34] people to see it see that in you but we
[59:37] want everybody
[59:38] i think that's what
[59:40] brother branham is referring to he says
[59:42] he says
[59:45] every man's got to be born again there's
[59:47] a sinful nature killed in him and a new
[59:49] man born in which is
[59:51] christ jesus the son of god then you
[59:54] surrender
[59:55] yourself
[59:56] completely to
[59:58] christ and christ comes in
[1:00:02] and writes a book of acts through you
[1:00:07] how i know that's the truth my friend
[1:00:10] how i know that's the truth
[1:00:12] i've said it if you can only healed
[1:00:16] yourself
[1:00:17] it's a choice
[1:00:20] it's not a it's
[1:00:21] a choice
[1:00:22] we all have the same choice to yield
[1:00:26] may god bless us as we leave here
[1:00:30] learning
[1:00:31] to yield amen listening that little
[1:00:33] chorus learning to lean
