any relation but uh from pawy Oklahoma uh my my pastor is my father brother the W Martin so they they send their greetings and the Saints there um I don't think we I've met any of y'all but y'all might may know my uncle Jonathan Martin he pastors there in Lima brother Craig boers old church and brother uh Isaiah Brooks I've got another Uncle Shawn Martin there in Virginia that's pastoring so th those are my uncles I don't know if you know them or not but that's that's the connection there and so my my family ain't with me uh she's a originally from Ohio by the Wayne Lawson's church and so we were up visiting family and ministering around and so she's there with her family so they're not with me but I brought my chauffeur this is my brother-in-law brother Caleb Collins he's from Michigan and so his family brother Chuck Collins from from this area so he was gracious enough to to drive me up here from Ohio so but we bring greetings in the name of name of the Lord uh I know we may not know each other but we serve the same God got the same message and we've got the same Supernatural amen if you have your Bibles this morning let's open our scriptures to Matthew 26 and 26 it's an honor to be ministering this morning I was not expecting to minister I was just going to try to slip in and be in service with y'all but uh but here we are so I do appreciate the opportunity to be ministering I pray something could be said to be a blessing I'm just a simple preacher but but I love the Lord with all my heart amen Matthew 26 and 26 and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins are you thankful for that can we bow our heads this morning dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord how honored we are father to to come into your house Lord and thank you for the opportunity for to have a place God that we can come and feel your presence draw near us God God I know there's there's new faces father I'm I'm new to the people lord they're new to me but I ask that you help us to all just get comfortable Lord may we rely on your spirit God and as the word would come forth God I ask that you would speak to the needs Lord speak to the hearts God where we're a needy people Lord all of us have decisions that need to be made made Lord all of us have problems we're facing Lord battles we're going through I ask that you would come in a in a sweet way this morning God may your spirit walk the aisles Lord and touch needs and circumstances like only you can father Lord I lay myself aside Lord and surrender to you I ask that you would speak this morning we lay this service into your hands in Jesus name amen you may be seated this morning uh my subject is going to be a positive token and brother would tell us that we live off of dead substance right he says whatever we eat something had to die in order for us to live he says if you eat a hamburger the cow had to die if you eat bacon in the morning the pig had to die he says even for the vegetarians if you eat vegetables or fruit it had to Die the if you drink milk the bacteria had to die and so naturally to live we have to live off of dead substance and brother Brandon would tell us that's the same thing uh spirit as well we have we live off of dead substance something had to die in order for us to live and we would see through the Old Testament that they would come to the Tabernacle and would slay a lamb and that lamb was taking the punishment for their sins and the blood would pour upon them and would cover their sins that they would commit or would have committed already but you would notice that there would be forgiveness under the blood of bulls and goats but there was no separation there was no remission the Bible would tell us in Hebrews 10:1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come not the very image of those things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect in other words it was a shadow of a good thing to come but not the image but when the image would come it would be the Perfection that it was pointing to you know so when the blood of Christ would come it would not just forgive the sins but it would bring a remission because there in the in the Old Testament if you would come for telling a lie and say Lord I'm sorry for telling a lie the blood would pour upon you you know and you would be forgiven but you would live with the you would leave with a sin nature right then you would come back the next year I'm sorry for telling a lie the next year I'm sorry for telling a lie it would be a cycle because it was only a shadow of the thing to come but when the blood of Christ come it wasn't a cycle it wasn't a shadow but it was the very image to bring a separation and the word remission means separated released from prison or bondage so the blood of Christ would not just forgive you but it would separate you that whenever you would leave you would leave a different person so I don't believe we got to we have to be in a cycle you come this morning saying God I'm sorry for doing this next Sunday God I'm sorry for doing doing this next Sunday I'm sorry for doing this and it's a cycle but the blood of Christ has come to break the cycle that you can live in a remission a separation and I think it's pretty incredible that it was sin that would separate man from God but sin separated from man brings you back to God and I believe that's what the what the blood of Christ has done and I like how the Bible would put it that under the blood of bulls and goats there's a remembrance made for sin every year but under the blood of Christ the Bible would say this because that the worshipper once purged should have no more conscience of sins in other words under the Old Testament blood there's a remembrance you remember there's there's still a nature of it but under the blood of Christ there's no more conscience so the very desire that would be there to sin is now gone but we would see that it wasn't the literal blood of Jesus but it was the life of the blood because if all you see is the chemical the blood of Jesus you're going to remain in the cycle but if you see the life of it which is the token the Holy Ghost and that brings you out of a cycle out of a tradition out of an idea to a life that the very life that was inside of Jesus Christ can come back upon the believer you know brother Brandon going talk about what would I do if I had two drops of the blood of Jesus y'all remember him talking about about that he says if I had it in a charger or in a cup he said I would walk so reverently I would walk so humbly because I didn't want to spill it because it was the blood of Jesus and but he says there's somebody something in front of me that is more important than the blood of Jesus it's the purchase of the blood of Jesus we might not have the literal blood today but we've got the purchase of what the blood has bought the blood has bought our forgiveness our freedom our separation and we're setting here today not with the lital blood but with the life that has purchased it and that's what I love about this message it has brought us out of a form into the life of it because we're thankful for the cross but what has it done for me you know I was listening to the rising of the Sun and brother brandom says we we all celebrate Easter but what has it done what does Easter mean to me you know and so the cross is more than just a crucifix but it has done something for us the blood is more more than just a story or a song but it has done something for us and brother Brandon would tell us that it was God releasing his life whenever he was upon the cross and the blood cell was broken it was God releasing himself to come back into a body again and so the cross is more than a crucifix it is the life of God being released to bring a separation from the very desires of sin and the Bible would tell us in Hebrews 10:1 17 and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more like I said earlier it's not just a forgiveness it's a separation so when God looks at you he don't see sins he sees the blood when God looks at you he don't see faults and mistakes a and generational curses but whenever he looks at you he sees something that was a part of him to bring you back to him you know brother Brandon would say when he looks at you he don't see you he sees your representation which is the blood he says he hears your voice but he sees the blood and I'm so thankful that we had a blood that was a perfect blood to bring a perfect loosening you see men have been trying to live good lives they've been trying to be good Christians but there was no possible way in a human nature to do it but the blood of Christ the life of the blood the Holy Ghost has brought us something that we don't have we're not just Christians on Sundays or on Wednesdays but it's the token that has brought the positive into the negative to bring to bring forth the Life of Christ oh brother Brandon would say this and since it is the blood of God it is a perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosening us from the power and and bondage and defilement of sin then the loosening is perfect and complete there was now therefore no condemnation who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect is a God that justifies declares us righteous who is he that condemneth and there it is his death gave us the blood the blood has loosed us there was now no condemnation how can it be there was nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us we are free we're Guiltless don't listen to the man listen to the word you were loosed by the blood and I say Amen to that we're not listening to a man we're listening to the word that has said we are loosed by the blood and I don't I I don't know any of you this morning maybe you've got marital problems or or addictions or or failures you're are loosed by the blood don't listen to condemnation don't listen to failures don't listen to past mistakes there is something that is brought a brought a separation a remission from the very desire of sin oh my and I like how we how he puts that don't listen to the man listen to the word you were loosed thank you brother you were loosed by the blood and so the blood a perfect blood would give us a perfect loosening and so now I'm no longer known by my own nature but a new man that's taking place on the inside something that's taken place and I like how brother Brandon would put it he would say I'll never be perfect in your sight and you'll never be perfect in my sight but what about God's sight and that really done something for me because if you ever get the revelation of that you'll look at each other in a different way you won't be looking at the mistakes you be looking up the problems you won't be looking up the failures cuz all of us have mistakes all of us have failures but what is God looking at God ain't looking at your mistakes God ain't looking at your failures he looks at your representation the blood of Jesus Oh Hallelujah and brother brandom he would preach multiple messages called the token and he would say that God he would he would uh show his longsuffering and kindness to pharaoh and all of his people he would send them a prophet he would send them signs he and behind those signs was a message and he says he sent the pillar of fire and he says the message was let my people go right let my people go and now Pharaoh would not listen to the message that God had given him so now brother Brandon would say that now God is making a separation he says God got fed up with him because they were not listening to the message that he had sent them so now we know the Bible would tell us that the death angel was going to come through the land right and what was to separate the Israelites from the Judgment that was coming upon the land was the token right and the blood was to separate them from the Judgment that was coming upon the land and I don't believe that the Judgment was for the Israelites it was for the Egyptians right and I don't believe the judgments that are upon the Earth today is not for you it's for the world the Bible would tell us that we're living in the time where scripture is being fulfilled the Bible has told us that there were 200,000,000 demons that has been released out of the river Euphrates the Bible would tell us that there's going to be signs in the Suns there's going to be a distress of Nations men's hearts are failing them for fear these are plagues and judgments that are upon the Earth but I don't believe we have to be pled with fear we're living in the day of nervousness we're living in the day of fear but the Brandon would say the number one illness is fear it's nervousness it creat to depression and anxiety we're living in the day where that judgment is upon the Earth but it's not for you you don't pertain to the judgments that is for the earth that is for the world but what separates me brother Josh is there's a positive token there is something that can separate you from what is upon the Earth cuz we know the Bible would tell us that they were to slay the lamb there in Egypt they were to slay the lamb they would take the blood of that Lamb with hisp they would apply the blood and put it over the doorpost of their door right and then whenever the death angel would be striking he would come to that door and could not enter Because the token was applied and I say this is the time not to throw away the Holy Ghost this ain't the time to cancel the Holy Ghost this is the time to accept it for my family for my home for my church for my marriage whatever it is the death angel is striking the land it's not a natural death it's a spirit spiritual death right you can be sitting in a church the Bible would tell us that Jesus would say that there's the woman that is dead while she liveth where how's that possible she's alive naturally but she's dead spiritually and that that is the place today we're living in a Christian Nation you know I'm from Oklahoma they're in the Bible Belt we got churches on every corner you know everybody's Christians but where is the life they're dead why they live it's judgment that is upon the Earth but there is a Life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is separating you from the spiritual death that has overtaken the land today oh Hallelujah but you would notice that they were to apply the blood with hisp and brother Brandon would tell us that hisp wasn't anything special it was just a common weed that was among Palestine right and it was something so common that I'm sure phoh would have overlooked him could you imagine being Pharaoh sitting there and hearing seeing the Jud judgement coming through the land and he knew the Judgment was coming the messenger told him that the the death angel was going to strike the firstborn you know and here he was sitting maybe he would see the neighbor son die or maybe he would look across and had a had a his sister or or brother maybe they had a family member died and he is wishing and maybe his mind is thinking and turning how can I escape the Judgment that is coming through the land but it at the same time that this was taking place over in Goan there was a separation that was taking place Pharaoh did not have the secret ingredient it was the common Faith inside of the token because brother Brandon would tell us that hisp is the type of common Faith something so simple that it is overlooked but that the the common Faith applying the token is separating you from the Judgment that is upon the earth oh man we're living in a in a society where it's all out chaos right it's so chaotic nowadays and they're thinking maybe a new president will help maybe more money will help maybe maybe a new politician will help maybe this here is going to help and they fa to realize the right among them is the common faith that has been restored or what did Malachi 4 and5 say I'm going to send you Malachi the Prophet Elijah the prophet that is going to turn your faith by your hearts back to the fathers right it's something that has taken back to the original that is going to produce the same life oh Hallelujah in the midst of death in the midst of chaos there is a life inside of this token Oh Glory to God it's the world is looking for something big to bring certainty but right among them is something so common oh Hallelujah that's why we don't look the politicians for certainty oh come on we don't look for a big bank account to bring certainty we don't look for a new house to bring certainty we don't look for a new car to bring certainty or a girlfriend or a boyfriend but we look to one thing that is what the blood has purchased you know the blood has purchased your sound of Mind where you don't got to live in anxiety the Devil comes and Whispers that you got to be got to be anxious you got to be nervous but that's a curse that the devil has put upon the human race but the blood has purchased a sound of Mind where you don't got to live in a nervous condition there's a token that can separate you from the Judgment that is upon the earth oh Hallelujah but you see the token is is the evidence of what has already been purchased right how many's ever flown before you know and you and the first thing you do is you make sure your ticket is purchased right then you go and you go to the counter but you don't give them your money at the airport you say I need the token right I need the ticket you can't buy the token at the counter the token has got to be purchased for way ahead of time the only thing that takes place at the airport is you got to apply what the money is already paid for oh Hallelujah so when you get to the airport you don't go to security you don't go check in your back first you don't go to your gate you're not eligible for any of those things yet until you apply yourself with the token then once you get in and you know I I just got back from chech Republic about a month or so ago and so when whenever I got to the airport I told them my confirmation number I told them where I was going my my stops you know and then they would identify me with my schedule that was going to take place then once I was identified with the schedule then I could check in my bag then I could go through security I could find my gate it didn't matter the hiccups I was checked in with what my money had already purchased and oh my the Supernatural is not eligible to you until you identified with what the blood has paid for oh Hallelujah that's why we don't got to live in a nervousness a nervousness because if you got the Holy Ghost your sound of mind has already been paid for and the Holy Ghost identifies you with what was already paid for oh Hallelujah no brother brother Brandon would talk about uh he would talk about if I was hungry and somebody noticed if I was hungry and he they would come up and say what do you need brother Brandon he says well I need five cents and I can go get me some bread he says if somebody gave me 5 cents he says now I can Rejoice all the more now because I've got the purchase of that bread I might not have it yet but I've got the purchasing power so now I can Rejoice cuz all I got to do is go claim what the 5 cents is already paid for oh Hallelujah that's why you can rejoice in the midst of the trial in the midst of the circumstance in the midst of the negativity there's a token that has identified you you might not see the results yet but the results is right around the corner you remember Daniel he would pray for three weeks trying to get an answer from God but he kept on persisting he kept on fighting he kept on pressing and this ain't the time to give up this ain't the time to lay down this is the time to press this is the time to fight this is the time to take up the word of God and say by your stripes I'm Healed I claim my my my sound mind I claim my children I claim my marriage whatever it is I claim it cuz what happened after Daniel pressed for 21 days then the angel of the Lord come down it says I was coming the first day but the prince of the power of the air withstood me but I had to fight through it oh Hallelujah maybe your Miracle is right around the corner but you got to press for it oh come on now maybe your answer is right around the corner but you've got to press for it you know on the other side of the press is always the victory you remember uh it was uh it was the man that had the the the infirmity in his body that he was laying in his bed and it was the four friends they would pick him up you remember pick up his bed they knew where Jesus was and they would pick up his bed and they would get to the house but the Bible says they couldn't get into the house because of the press the pressure was too great but they didn't give up you know what they done y'all know what he what what those four friends done they climbed onto the roof God give us some friends like that that ain't willing to lay down ain't willing if you see somebody that's discouraged I'm willing to fight for you the Bible says they climbed on top of the roof and they started to take the shingles apart youall remember the story they took the shingles apart and they lifted him down they lowered him down to the presence of Jesus what if they would have given up in the pressure they wouldn't have seen the miracle and if you give up in the pressure you won't see the miracle but on the other side of the press on the other side of the fight is the miracle that is coming down your road oh the Bible would tell us of the the woman with woman with the blood issue you remember that that story the Bible says that she spent all of her money on Physicians and nobody could help her but she knew Jesus was coming by a way and the Bible says she couldn't get the Jesus because of the press the Press was too great but she knew this was her Miracle this was the Supernatural and if she could just fight through the pressure then she could see the results in the Bible where the brand would tell us maybe she had to Elbow her way around maybe she had to crawl up to the ground and the Bible says all she could touch was the Hemm of His Garment but she was willing to press for it cuz she knew that was her Miracle oh and little church your Miracle is not a Million Miles Away Your Miracle your Revival whatever it is is right here among us maybe you got to fight for it maybe you got to press for it maybe you got got to lay some things down some bitterness some gossip maybe you got to throw some things out in order to see the Revival oh hallelujah it's right here Among Us oh my but the Supernatural is identified whenever the token is apply oh my so the the token applies what the Holy Ghost had what the per what the what the blood has already purchased us but the Brandon would say there you are the blood the blood the blood not the blood chemistry but the to the Holy Ghost the life of the blood that comes what does that life do it comes and confirms what the token has been purchased for the token what the blood bought for you he says the the blood purchased your Redemption but the token is the evidence of it Oh The Blood purchased your Redemption but the token is the evidence of it and he says the blood he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon on him with their stripes we were healed see or blood blood blood then when the token comes it shows that what you've been identified with that sacrifice and the devil can't keep you from it oh that's a revelation that we can grab a hold of once the token is applied it it identifies you with what the blood has purchased and it's the evidence and the devil can't keep you from it oh and I say devil get out of my way I'm marching on you remember the story by the brandom tells about the king like got the messenger and says here I'm giving you a message but I'm going to give you my scepter and the scepter if anybody gets in your way show them the scepter and say you got the king's message get out of the way and brother brandom says this at the end of that story he says Satan get out of my way I've got the king's message and I say Satan we've got the king's message we don't just got a message we've got the scepter we've got the token of the Holy Ghost that identifies what the scepter is purchasing us oh I say devil get out of the way Gloom get out of the way we're living in an atmosphere of Gloom it's easy to get depressed it's easy to get in the Blues as brother Brandon would say but we're living in a time where the blood has purchased something that we can acquire that we can grab a hold of and say Satan get out of our way oh Hallelujah and brother Brandon would tell us there's a difference between the blood and the life there's a difference CU you can have the blood chemical and fail to get the life right so brother brandom says there's a difference under this Covenant there's a difference between the blood and the life he was saying how in Egypt they had to have the chemical blood because the the the the lamb didn't have a soul on it remember him talking about that he says the lamb didn't have a soul and so the life C that lamb couldn't come on them to make them perfect so they needed a sybol they had to take the blood and that was symbolizing that something had taken their judgment you know but but the brandom says but that's not the case we there's a difference between the blood and the life we don't need the chemical blood but we need the life of the blood and I like up with the brown and a put it he would say the Bible would tell us there when Mary asked how can this be I know not a man and the Bible would say the angel told her that the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you and we know what happened the Holy Ghost would overshadow her and would create a blood cell right would create something the life of it inside of her womb and we would know them brother Brandon would tell tell us that that little blood cell would create another cell create another cell create another cell until Jesus was then made born he would come alive and then he would come forth and brother Brandon would tell us that whenever he was upon the cross he says whenever his blood was spilled the chemical blood went into the elements of the ground and it went back to the elements but the life of it the Creator the blood cell come back to the church oh Hallelujah that is what is separating us is not a chemical blood but the life of the blood that is what is separating us oh and I like how brother Brandon would say it he says every believer can be wrapped in the blood cell with him he he says and the church is wrapped into the blood cell of the life of Jesus Christ not just the blood cell but the blood cell of the life so the very life that created the blood cell that is what you are wrapped in you know if you are wrapped by something you for in order for somebody to get to you they got to go through the wrapping right so before if you're wrapped in the life of the blood cell before the enemy can get to you he's got to go through the blood oh come on now and he can't get through the blood because there's a separation remember the Death Angel and the Bible would tell us in Exodus that the Bible the uh the Lord was speaking to Moses and would say when the Destroyer comes if the blood is applied he cannot come into your house there was a separation cuz he couldn't get through the blood oh and the devil can come and torment you but he can't get to your soul oh he can get to your flesh he can get to your spirit man but he can't get to the soul that is anchored wrapped by the life of the blood oh Hallelujah you know brother Brandon would tell us that he says the devil don't make us do anything because in order for him to get inside of you he's got to he's got to repent be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost and then he's your brother oh Hallelujah so if you're wrapped in the life of the blood that means the devil can't get to you he can tempt you he can torment your mind but there's nothing he can do to turn you around oh what a glorious thing if we're wrapped he can't get to us you know you know speaking on flying you I I always get nervous going through security I don't know why I don't know if anybody else ever feels that if you flown every time I go to security I get nervous and I've I've even got that pre-check thing where I don't I don't even take off my shoes I don't take my belt off I don't take my computer out I all I got to do is walk straight through the scanner you know and I still get nervous it's because I think that they're going to turn me around but they can't because I've got the token oh we get nervous of the enemy of the devil of spirits cuz we think that he can turn us around but he can't turn you around if you've got the token oh but you know there are some things that security can do you know many times I I I've lost my back too many times and so I I do carry-on bags if it's somewhere local you know I do carry-on bags and sometimes I forget about my shampoo how many's ever done that you can't take the big shampoo on on the plane with you you know and so sometimes my bag is going to be going through I've already went through it I'm sitting there waiting on my bag and it's always it's depressing watching your bag it comes through the scanner and then it stops and it shoots over and you're like oh man now here's a hiccup you know they can't turn me around I've already come through but there are some things they can do they always say Okay whose bag is this it's my bag all right come over here you know the scanner is picking something up is it okay if I open it yeah you can open it they open it up oh look here's this bottle of shampoo is way too big what do you want us to do with it I'm like well do you want to take it back to your car do you want us to throw it away I said I ain't going back to my car I've come too far oh so in other words I can either return with it or they can just throw it away they can't turn me around but they can throw some things out that I am carrying on oh man the devil can't turn you around but he's just a tool in God's hand that is tripping some things off of you that he don't want on you oh bitterness ain't going to make a Rapture gossip ain't going to make a Rapture lust ain't going to make a Rapture so the devil can't turn you around but he can chip some things off of you and I say we've come too far to turn around we've come too far to let bitterness turn us around and go back we've come too far to let depression turn us around and take us back but I say it's time to go forward oh man I've got a plane in mind I've got my plane number my flight number my gate and I ain't going back I've got my destination in mind and I said just throw it away let me get on my plane throw it away and I say Lord throw some things away I had missing my plane but you know then uh it was a a few years ago me and brother Andrew Glover we was going to England and is preaching some meetings up there and we've got our we got our ticket our token you know and we got through our gates we made it we flew out of Rono we flew from Rono to Atlanta then we had a we had a layover there in Paris and we get there in Paris and our token our ticket got us through security it got us through customs you know we got through customs we find our gate we get to our gate you know we're sitting there for a couple hours and they start boarding the plane and then you know we get to the gate and we give them a ticket and they say you don't got a ticket we said yeah we do we got a ticket no you don't got a ticket we said yeah we do we got said no you don't go go over there to the information desk and they'll give you a ticket you know go go talk to them we had a ticket that brought us that far but then they cancelled it and expected us to make our destination without our ticket oh I'm preaching now too many times we try to cancel the Holy Ghost and say we don't need a move of God no more we don't need it we don't need this anymore we don't need that it's just emotion it's just sensation what the devil is doing is trying to cancel your ticket and expecting you to make the Rapture oh I'm preaching now but this ain't the time to cancel it this is the time to enforce it and say God we need the Holy Ghost more than ever before we need the Holy Ghost in our churches more than ever before we need our young people filled with the Holy Ghost more than ever before Oh but you know the the Revival starts more before you come to church yes come on it's parents hope this is okay it's parents I don't know about nobody here this morning so I'm just preaching it's parents that create the Revival at home you're the bride's Revival your pastor ain't the bride's Revival you're the bride's Revival you're the one that gets the Revival up the home you're the one that gets the children together and you pray you're the one that turns on a message you're the one that reads devotions with them it's you creating a Revival that when they come to church they're they're they're familiar with the spirit of God moving and so they say yep that is what I'm wanting oh you know I'm I'm sort I'm I'm not too very handy with uh construction but I can sort of do a little bit to get me by and I was I was remodeling my house and any I would give y'all some advice don't every remodel a house that you're living in that was the worst mistake that I have ever made in my life so anyways I'm remodeling my house you know I I did an addition this was how bad this remodeling was you can walk in our kitchen and see the stars we took the whole roof off our kitchen we're expanding our kitchen you know and so anyways we're finally getting done with it we're getting close we're putting the tile down and I I don't know if anybody's ever done tile you put the tile down you know then you start to grout it and you put the grout upon it and what you have to do is when you put the grout on you go with a few square feet and then you got a sponge and a bucket of water then you go when you wipe up you wrap the tile down and it picks up the access ground okay and so then I I did I was going to town you I have my bucket of water I had two sponges I'm going at it you know and I get done I looked and the floor's still dirty and I thought oh my goodness I got it again I went and cleaned it all up I got back the floor still dirty and I was getting mad at my sponges I was ringing them out I was squeezing them out I would go and wipe it down again and I thought what is going on then I thought hit me the water's dirty it ain't the sponges fault it's the environment that I'm putting those sponges in come on parents children are sponges people are sponges and Revival happens at home you can pick up your children and put it in in an environment of Gossip in an environment of bitterness that's what they're going to soak up so when they come to church that's what they push out I couldn't be mad that my floor was dirty I was the one putting it in the environment so you know what I had to do I dump that environment out oh I'm preaching now I dumped it out got some more water but you notice it took more than just one dumping a Revival is a multiple cleansing you can throw one thing out maybe there's more things in the closet you can throw that thing out maybe there's more thing in your heart you can throw that out maybe there's something else so the floor didn't get clean after just one refilling but I had to dump the water out I'll go clean then I'll dump the water out some more then I'll go and clean some more I'll dump the water out again so it's a process a Revival don't happen overnight but it's saying Lord show me your way if I got to throw some things out I'm going to throw it out I want a separation I want a separation I'm living in the Earth but the Abraham would say I'm walking through this I'm just I'm just a Sojourner I don't this ain't my home I'm looking for a place whose Builder and maker is God I'm I'm I'm living here but I'm not a part of it we're not a part the Bible would say we're a royal priesthood A peculiar Nation a chosen people the word peculiar is strange we're not meant to fit in hey come on I know what that's what peer pressure is peer pressure want you to fit in peer pressure want you to belong but as you're trying to belong you're throwing away your morals you're throwing away you're throwing away your convictions you know no back home we're we're there in Oklahoma in the west you know the wild west and so we still got horses that come through town and things you know people ride for fun and we've got a we got rodeos that take place I don't know there's any rodeos up here and on but there's rodeos that in our town and it's always funny because everybody's a cowboy at rodo time right every the guy that normally wear shorts that has his flipflops now he's got his boot cut jeans on he's got his his boots on he got his cowboy hat and boy howdy now he's a cowboy but inside he's a city slicker so what he done he he threw his identity away to fit in with the identity that he is coping with oh and that's what peer pressure does as a Son of God God places an identity on the inside that belongs to him but when you go to school you go to work you start to you try to cope with the identity and so you're throwing away morals you throw away convictions and you're just like the city slicker throwing off your flipflops you know taking off your shorts and putting on your boot cut jeans there's nothing inside of him that is a cowboy and let me say young boys you can run you can try see in but if you're a Son of God you can try to run but there's always a part of God on the inside that you can't do away with the devil might throw Addictions on them the devil might throw Temptations on them but if you're a Son of God God's got you and I see that's for anybody in here you may try to run and hide but if go if you're a part of the Jin seed of God God is always going to have you oh Hallelujah and so what happens after the rodeo they go back to the shorts they go back to the flip flops and oh man if you you can try to run but if you're a jean seed of God the soul the seed on the inside is going to Blossom it may take time it may take scars it may take some circumstances you know but God's going to get you amen so it's the token that connects you with the purchase of the blood brother brandom says listen close while I make these closing remarks if Satan tries to hand you some of this stuff like sickness you know what to do just show him the token I'm a purchased product my healing has been paid for I'm a product of God because I have the token of the Holy Ghost you cannot keep me off of this highway you cannot keep me from my health I present the token and show you that by his stripes I was healed here is the resurrection of Jesus Christ right in me now to prove it to you oh there is a real thing there is the token ain't that powerful here in me now is the resurrection of Jesus Christ in me now you remember Elisha the Bible would tell us of when Elijah he got on the Chariot of fire and his mantel fell down girl remember that remember that in the Bible and and Elisha would pick up the Manel and would say where is the god of Elijah right and the same signs remember because it was Elijah that would split the Jordan River then Elisha now was doing the same things and so the same Authority that Elijah would had now Elisha has and now the Bible would tell us that it was years later Elisha was dead and his bones were in a cave youall remember that story and there was a battle that was taking place and there was a somebody that had died in the Battle and then there was two comrades they were picking him up y remember and were taking him back to their back to their lines I think and they and the enemy was coming so they picked up the dead body and just threw them in the cave yall remember that and as soon as the body got in the cave it had touched the bones of Elijah of Elisha and he came back to life and come running out could you imagine being those two guys that throws him in there he's dead they watched him die and they turn around and here he comes running out I would be running with them say there's no way and you know sometimes we see people that you seems like a hopeless case oh they're too bitter they're too this they're too that don't give up on them let them touch the bones of the quickening power oh what it was was inside and I like it brother the brown I put it he says death can't even kill the quick in power Elisha was dead but the quickening power was there to raise him back up after Resurrection oh if you've got the quickening power you may go to the way of the grave but that quickening power the token will rise you back up on Resurrection morning oh this ain't the time to lay down and give up there's a promise because of a token oh there is a real thing there is a real thing and I like brother Brandon how he puts that there is a real thing there is is a real Holy Ghost it's not just Sensations it's not just emotions it's not just speaking in tongues I've never spoken tongues before that that mean I don't have the token come on now too many of us try to try to you know we got to do this we got to do that and what you're doing is you organized in the Holy Ghost oh you may never dance you may never speak in tongues but if the nature of God's on the inside you might not can point back to speaking in tongues but if your life has changed that is something you can point back hallah oh Hallelujah but how come it's in the evening time that the that the Holy Ghost has come under Fire you know that we can't the Holy Ghost ain't for us today it's because that we've had a message in this generation that has opened up the book right that has loosen the seals and under the seals was your inheritance it was your Redemptive rights and it's the holy ghost that identifies you with what the book says you know the Bible would tell us that uh the blood of Abel would speak out against Cain youall remember that whenever God would come and ask Cain where was your brother am I My Brother's Keeper you remember that and the Bible says the God spoke to Cain and says you're the the blood of Abel cries out against you it cries out against so he was speaking of condemnation but then the Apostle Paul would say the blood of Jesus speaks better things than that of Abel and so the blood of Abel spoke out against Cain but the blood of Jesus speaks for you it don't speak condemnation it speaks Grace and then brother Brandon would say this he says the New Testament the blood speaks better things the blood is speaking then the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is his word oh then he would saying in another place that's the life that's in you speaks from the shed blood Amen brother I wish everybody could see that if you can see what it is it's the life that's in you see the blood is identifying you with it so the life that is in you identifies you with what the blood speaks so if this message speaks of a Rapture the life that is in you identifies you with it oh Hallelujah me brother Brandon would say this word is like a jigsaw puzzle right he says you can't put the pieces together without the Holy Ghost the Bible would tell us that the Holy Ghost is a spirit of truth that will guide you into all truth right so without the spirit of Truth you can't be guided into all truth you can learn truth but you can't be guided you're going to get it all mixed up but the Brandon would say it's like having a he says you without the Holy Ghost you'll have a cow inside of the tree eating apples y remember that remember how you put that so in other words that's impossible for that to happen and that's what that's what happens without the Holy Ghost it's impossible to understand it but with the spirit of Truth when truth comes it ident if I with it and says yes that is mine it's speaking of me oh Hallelujah so whatever the blood speaks the token enforces and I like that brother Brandon would put he says in in a court he says whenever a court writes out a word the the penalty is such and such he says the law of the Court enforces the word of the Court oh it ain't the judge that is enforced and get it's the law of the court that enforces it and that's the way it is with the random says when God speaks something that is the law and the Holy Spirit here enforces the law regardless of the conditions regardless of the conditions if God's word says something the token inside enforces it oh that's why it's so important to have the Holy Ghost right it enforces what the blood says no matter the cond the condition and brother Brandon would say this who are you sickness who do you think you are Satan who do you claim to be every claim that you had was cancelled at Calvary you're a bluff you have no rights we defy you in the name of Jesus Christ as a holy ghost filled body who are you Satan who do you claim to be every claim was canceled at Calvary oh every claim you know so the devil had claims on you right like in the Old Testament it was the it was the claim of the devil that made them go around in cycles and sin and sin and sin and sin the sin had a claim on their life but when the blood of Christ come with remission it canceled the claim that was upon the life and here brother brandom says Satan who do you claim to be every claim was broken so the claim can be broken but unless you're unless that that the claim of God now is enforced by the Holy Ghost the claim can be broken but you will still live under that claim that's true come on now you know if you paid something you know if if I if I uh uh if I bought my ticket to go to Czech Republic but I never went there and I claimed ticket it's just going to lay there right even though it's purchased unless they identify with it it's going to lay there unused and the claims of the devil has been broken but unless you identify with what the blood paid for the claim is going to still lay there and you're going to act under the claim that has already been broken you remember brother brandom talks about the crow he says the crow somebody tied up the crow and drove steak into the ground youall remember that he says that Crow he would see the other the crows would start to fly over and they would say come on Johnny Crow come with us and he would go and he would start to fly but then the Rope would pull him back down y'all remember that said the next day the crows would take off he would try to go with them but the Rope would bring him back and this happened year after year after year and then there was finally a man that felt sorry for the crow he would come and he would cut that rope right and so now the crow was free but he was still walking in that cycle Oh Come on he was still walking in that cycle because he thought that still had a claim on him but even though something purchased the freedom from the claim and then there would go the crows you know they would say come on Johnny Crow and he would run he would stop because he was so used to being claimed and too many of us are so used to being claimed by nervousness that whenever something happens we get nervous but the claim has been broke we get so used to being claimed by Rebellion so used to being claimed by sugar diabetes or high blood pressure or whatever it is that whenever something pops up we just surrender to the claim but the claim has been broke there's no claim that the devil hasd on us under the token oh Hallelujah because the devil had claims on our marriages he had claims on our minds he had claims on our children you know brother the Brandon would talk about the abstract and the title deed he says if you have the tital deed that don't mean you have everything thing because there can be leans on the title deed you remember I'm talking about that but he says what you need is the abstract to the title deed and that clears every lean that is against you he says then once you have the abstract he says that gives you permission to give to get everything that the title deed declares and he says the Holy Ghost is the abstract that that that it cancels every claim that is against you and you know brother the Brandon would talk about the he would say this here and it put my name in The Book of Life but was born through a man and a woman and subject to sin and guilty of it but when I believed on it I received the deed but when the Holy Ghost came it was the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it if my father done it if my grandmother done it like the little epileptic child I prayed for a few minutes ago that come from the grandparents the epilepsy fell down upon the child but when the ab ract came it struck it off admitted everything ain't that incredible the generational curses are a real thing yes it is come on now generation this this little girl got this EP epilepsy spirit because of grandparents and it was a it was a generational curse and generational curses can go through marriages well this one your your great your great grandpa struggled with his marriage your grandpa struggled with the marriage and you think your parents now you think you have to struggle with your your marriage it's a generational curse or maybe pornography was sent down from generation to generation to generation it's a claim that the devil has on you but brother brandom says but when the abstract come it didn't matter how strong the epilepsy was when the abstract come it struck it off it separated her it didn't matter how long that generational curse was in the family when the positive token come it separated her from that generation curse and I'm here to say there's a separation that has taken place oh man there's May been something high blood pressure may have went from your great-grandfather grandfather your father to you but there's a separation that can take place this morning let the abstract come and break every claim that the devil would put upon your life oh hallelujah it's claims that have already been broken your children are yours come on now your children are yours but the devil going to put claims on them but those claims are broke your Offspring is yours you know my my my dad would always speak over us you know and he would say when Even in our rebellious years God didn't give me Serpent seed God didn't my my children are Sons and Daughters of God my my brother would go out and he would get in the drugs he would get in the alcohol he would get into a gang he would go out with women but in the midst of it all dad would still say I don't got serpent seed it didn't matter how what the devil claim that he had the daddy knew that the claim was Broken Hallelujah the claim was broken but random would say this then when we pray we must have the token to present with our prayers as I said now believe for ourself and apply the token to the whole family like in Egypt Jericho or in Acts 16-31 we find out but Paul told the Roman Centurion believe thou when all thy house shall be saved and apply it to your family if you got an unsaved child lay the token right on top of him and say Lord God I claim him stay right there if you got a mother or a loved one that's lost lay the token on them and say Lord God I claim them and brother bandam is making a personal he ain't saying saying God you claim them he says you claim them come on now you claim them it don't matter what the devil claims to have with the abstract the claims are off amen praise God oh the the token speaks better things amen better things so it don't matter what the evidence is against you it speaks better things you know what and I love the story of Rahab you know Rahab would start to intercede for her family because the Bible would say in Joshua 2:12 now therefore I prayed you swear unto me by the Lord God since I have showed you kindness that you also show kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token yeah oh a true token but you notice that she was saying my father's house it was just yeah sa my family you know but then the next verse the 13th verse and that ye will save aive my father my mother my brethren my sisters all that they have and deliver our lives from Death now here is something this is somebody that was getting desperate not just my family but now I'm going to intercede I've got some names on my mind oh not just family but my mother my father my sister my brothers that's the way we should be when we intercede is I'm not just you know babbling words yeah help the church but I'm going to intercede help the pastor help the deacons help the song leaders it's under the true token oh and it was Rahab saying give me something true oh that should be the hearts The Cry of our hearts give us something true give me something true for my boys give me something true for my girls I want something true that will keep them in the hard times oh we're living in the day man where where it's pornography and drugs and alcohol and smoking that is taking over the land but give me something true that will keep them in the time of pressure and I believe we've got something true we've got a separation that can keep them in the hardest times oh why did Rahab want a true token cu the Bible would tell us a few verses before that in Joshua 2:9 and she said unto the men I know the Lord God the Lord ha given you the land and that your terror is Fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the Lord God how the Lord dried up the the water of the Red Sea for you and when you came out of Egypt and what you did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of Jordan sihon and OG whom you utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and Earth beneath then it was the very next verse give me a true token she knew what God can do we know what God can do we've seen we've heard testimonies the book of Acts we've heard testimonies help God deliver from the fiery furnace and out of the the Lion's Den and out of the the the the well you know we've heard of these stories here rank was saying we heard how your God split the Red Sea we heard how your God delivered you from the amalekites and destroyed the inhabitants give me a true token amen and save my family my brother my sister my mother my father and you notice what happened she should have been a statistic cuz the Judgment was coming upon the city what did the what did God tell Joshua March around the walls seven times amen or seven days and on the seventh day March seven times and then the walls are going to come down the Walls where was rahab's house on the wall so she should have been another statistic oh I'm feeling good this morning you should be another statistic that generational curse should Ru your life like the rest of your family you should be another statistic but there's a true token that has brought a separation it's something positive in the middle of the negative oh Hallelujah and there she was standing with the token in the window and you notice that that token May brought judgment on her right cuz could you imagine people walking by and saying what is that making fun of her scoffing but the very thing that brought judgment upon her saved her from the Judgment that was coming don't be ashamed of this word don't be ashamed of the Holy Ghost it is the thing that is going to save you from the Judgment oh Hallelujah so here the walls were Fallen here she was should should have been another statistic and here she would stand and say wow here I am I'm saved than you notice that it was The Messengers that would give her a promise right and it was the token that would that would bring to pass the words of the messenger am oh and it's the token that is bringing to pass the words of our messenger am come on now what the what the blood is speaking the token is bringing to pass oh Hallelujah give me a true token token amen give me a true token give me a few more minutes and and I'll bring this down to a close but we needed something to speak better things and this is where I got my title brother Brandon must say no there is no devil who can stand before it there is nothing that can stand before it because God has accepted it you hold the token in your hand that the price is paid oh it's a positive token it's a positive token but you know we're living in the middle of negativity right you can't even go down the road you know you go down the road hey how you doing some random person well this here went wrong that went wrong this here went wrong it's negativity right how many's ever experienced that then you're sorry you even asked right you know nobody's positive nobody has good days anymore nobody has a good year anymore this went wrong that went wrong it's negative we're living in a negative world but there's something positive it's a positive token and brother Brandon and the rising of the sun he would say now the Sun at the rising of the Sun Well there was the time when the world was laying in utter Darkness without form and void it was all covered in water and was laying there in a dark dismal gloomy atmosphere gloomy and and the spirit of God moved upon the water and said let there be light and God had a reason to do that for down beneath the water there were seeds that he had planted and it had to have the sunlight to make it live and I really like that that there was seeds that God had already planted the sun didn't bring the seeds come on the Sun just brought the life what God already put there this message didn't make you a son and daughter of God it just brought to life what was already there but there was a gloomy atmosphere that was over the seed oh Hallelujah brother brandom said there had to be light and he continues on to say and the first light that was ever given upon the Earth was God's God spoken word and he says he said let there be light and there was light that turned Darkness into light in order to bring forth the creation of Joy oh I just whenever I read that that really spoke to me it was a gloomy atmosphere that was over the Earth but he had there had to be a light to bring forth the seed to take the creation or to turn the darkness the gloominess the depression into a creation of Joy oh we're not meant to be depressed all the time we're not to meant we're not meant to be in gloominess all the time we're not meant to be under a heavy load and heaviness where all we can see is this problem and that problem this word has brought us the creation of Joy where we can have a joy unspeakable full of Glory oh Hallelujah the reason for bringing light was cause under that gloomy atmosphere was siege to bring forth the creation of Joy oh your joy is still laying there your peace is still laying there maybe it's a gloomy atmosphere that is over your life over your home over the church I don't know but there's a creation of Joy this morning oh it is the rising of the Sun brother Brandon would preach the rising of the Sun and said whenever Jesus would come forth you know the Bible says it was at the rising of the Sun that the ladies were going to the going to the supper remember that scripture and he says it was a dual Sunrise it wasn't just the Su incoming gun but it was the S and coming out of the grave and oh man we're under another Resurrection he says what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is the word that was in denominations has been lifted up again and what is th word doing pushing past the gloominess pushing past the the the gloominess in the atmosphere of doubt and unbelief to bring forth Joy Hallelujah you see it's the Troubles of life that can bring us down the Troubles of life when that those troubles can bring this atmosphere you know it was Martha the Bible would say here in Luke 10 and 41 Jesus answered and said unto her Martha Martha thou wart careful and troubled about many things so what did this troubless do here stood Jesus right God made flesh whatever Martha had need of all she had to do was ask amen right how many's ever have man if I could just get get in front of if I was only in Jesus day I know my brother would be healed or if I was only there I know I could be healed it's something that we have on our mind you know but here Martha was in front of Jesus but because of the troubles what did she do she missed her visitation yes did oh cuz because surely if she would have really realized she would have been like Jesus I need help Jesus I need healing or Jesus I need help with this situation I need peace I need Joy but because of the troubles and man I've been here before because of the troubles we sit in church and yeah that person needs it oh I know what they said last oh that one needs this oh hdden preacher it's because of the troubles you're missing your visitation I'm preaching now and that is the way Martha was here Martha stood in the presence of deity but because of the troubles you're troubled about many things she was saying yeah Martha Mary's this Mary's that Mary's doing that and here Jesus is saying Martha you're troubled but Mary's choosing the good thing the same troubles may have been troubling Mary it was troubling Mary could you imagine being being Mary she should have been back there helping and she should have been doing this she should have been doing that but she chose the right thing so I'm not missing my visitation but oh it can be a Sunday morning or a Wednesday night kind maybe it's an evangelist or the pastor getting up don't miss your visitation because of troubles don't allow troubles to bring bring gloominess that you miss out of the creation of Joy oh cuz troubless brings on evil thoughts the Bible would tell us in Luke 24:38 and he said unto them why are you you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your heart this is on the boat remember whenever the disciples was there upon the boat and the storm came up against them youall remember that and the Bible says they went up to Jesus and says Master do you care that we perish what happened their thoughts turned to the negative and now they're thinking Jesus was against them oh come on now so many times troubles can turn us around where we think the word's against us we think the pastor against us we thank the deacons against us we thank the evangelists against us why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your heart here Jesus stood up and said peace be still and what did the the disciples say what manner of man is this they should have known who he was but the troubles oh I hope you hear me now the troubles persuaded them that they could not see who was really there oh when God accompanies this word brother brand will tell us the angel of the Lord accompanies this message always the Bible tells us where two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in the midst but troubles can turn us around and we say why has God left us why has God forsaken us does God even love me anymore it was job that says that says the lord giveth and the lord taketh away but Blessed Be Thy holy name David yeah the Lord slave me yet I will trust him if I make my bed in hell thou W there if I send to the heights thou W there it was somebody that wasn't isn't allowing the troubles oh Hallelujah to bring a gloomy atmosphere don't allow the troubles to bring a gloomy atmosphere troubles it can be hurts I'm sorry just give me a few more minutes it can be hurts but the brand I'm going say this you're in the need of prayer too cuz you got a heavy heart but God knows the secrets of the heart do you believe it he can tell me what is your heaviness is about it's because you want a baby I see two Dark Shadows you've had two miscarriages in your time that is correct it was two miscarriages two hurts that brought on this gloominess it can be hurts it can be scars it can be something that happened 20 years ago that can bring up an atmosphere of Gloom amen but here stood a prophet that was saying God can heal you of that and we later on brother Brandon would cast those those darknesses out you know the Bible would tell us of King Bazar y remember the Bible says he was had he was troubled and and his countenance be to change and you know that is that that really struck me that whenever he was troubled his countenance begin to change it was because of the troubless how many's ever been around like a chilled guy that never gets upset never gets mad but then you see him sometime and he he he just blows up and something L up to that right some kind of trouble started to change his countenance CU he's now he's normally not that way we had a we I worked with a guy you know like man this guy never gets mad the boom he he blew up it was something it was troubles that changed his countenance and the Bible says in Daniel King bshar he was troubled and it changed his countenance but what would happen the Bible would tell us that it was the queen that would say there's a prophet Among Us there's Daniel that is the dissolver of the doubts he can answer the hard sentences he has understanding in Revelation it was somebody there that could bring a peace in the troubless oh mother Brandon would pick that up and would say it was the prophet there and the Holy Ghost today is the prophet y'all remember that he says the Holy Ghost today and he the dissolver of the doubts he's here to heal the troubles he's here to put the pieces back together he's here God hasn't forgotten the token he's still here you remember brother Brandon will talk about the rainbow and says here we are thousands of years later and God still Honors that token you know we was driving this morning and seeing the rainbow and and I thought it was great cuz I had these thoughts on my mind you know when does the rainbow appear whenever it's raining whenever there's clouds in the sky and the the Thunder is blaring and the lightning flashes and it start and the it gets gloomy when it rains right and it gets gloomy but in the midst of that gloominess the Sun starts to shine through the clouds and here appear a rainbow to let you know I haven't forgot my token let our musicians come tonight and maybe you're in a gloominess this morning but let the sun shine through and see I remember my token I haven't forsaken you I haven't forgots in you I know you may be tired

shines in our hearts in other words the same word that said let there be light in the beginning is the same word that I shine light in the end time in our hearts brother Brandon would say it brought it brought order out of chaos and now here God has brought order in our chaos maybe our marriages were chaotic maybe our lives I don't know but the word of breath brought a creation of joy you believe that this morning amen let's bow our heads this morning dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord thank you for shining a light Lord giving us something positive Lord we're in a negative World negative
