[33:28] amen let's look to the Lord in a word of

[33:35] thank
[33:35] you for the
[33:38] blood amen that gives us
[33:41] access Lord to you that we can become in
[33:46] harmony with you we ask Lord
[33:50] Jesus that there would be nothing in the
[33:53] service today that would hinder any of
[33:55] us from being able to not only hear from
[33:59] you but to be connected with you to be
[34:01] able to receive uh for what promises
[34:04] we're standing upon today amen Lord we
[34:08] ask that you'd remove every Spirit of
[34:11] Doubt every every Spirit of of of of
[34:15] what has
[34:16] transpired uh today of what is going to
[34:20] transpire uh tomorrow and help us to see
[34:24] what you're doing uh in in our hearts
[34:27] and our midst at this time father we ask
[34:29] you bless the reading of the word all
[34:33] things be spoken Lord May It Be You may
[34:36] you give me the grace to stand out of
[34:38] the way that you may speak and help your
[34:41] people we pray now in Jesus Christ name
[34:44] amen amen Mark chapter 4 we're going to
[34:47] read three verses there starting with
[34:49] verse number
[34:51] 10 and when he was
[34:53] alone they that were about
[34:56] him uh with the 12 asked of him the
[35:01] parable and he said unto them unto you
[35:04] it is given to know the mystery of the
[35:09] kingdom of God but unto them that are
[35:12] without all these things are done in
[35:17] Parables that seen they may see and not
[35:21] perceive and hearing they may hear and
[35:24] not understand lest at any time they
[35:26] should be converted Ed and their sin
[35:28] should be forgiven them amen God bless
[35:32] you may be
[35:34] seated well we see here that God
[35:39] purposely uh when he speaks he's
[35:43] speaking to a group of people that he
[35:46] wants them to understand and to another
[35:50] group that he doesn't want them to
[35:52] understand amen um now a loving God why
[35:55] would a loving God want
[35:58] this well we know the world is full of
[36:03] people who want to be saved and yet be
[36:07] able to live the life that they want to
[36:09] live down here and God knows who those
[36:12] people are we don't so we preach the
[36:16] word when we share the word with others
[36:18] when we come to church when we're
[36:20] listening to the tape the word is
[36:22] preached as if all who hears it are the
[36:26] seed but we know that some don't quite
[36:29] catch it amen now that word mystery it
[36:33] means
[36:35] secret it's secret just like the Bible
[36:38] says in in in the last days that uh
[36:42] during the the seventh angel when he
[36:44] begins to sound the mystery of God would
[36:47] be finished or the secret of God would
[36:50] be finished amen a mystery is something
[36:55] uh the dictionary tells us is something
[36:57] that is difficult or sometimes
[37:00] impossible to understand or
[37:04] explain Paul said that he
[37:07] spoke the wisdom of God in a mystery
[37:11] amen and and and tonight we want to talk
[37:14] about two Mysteries and I I there's
[37:17] going to be a lot of things um and
[37:20] pardon me wish we'd break it up into two
[37:23] but I just need you to be strong with me
[37:26] because um I want to I think this could
[37:30] help all of us and the two Mysteries I
[37:32] want to talk about is the mystery of
[37:33] iniquity and the Mystery of godliness
[37:36] because they they're kind of opposing
[37:38] forces amen now the uh the mystery of
[37:43] iniquity iniquity if you Webster defines
[37:46] it as a gross Injustice or a wicked act
[37:52] a gross Injustice or Wicked act and it
[37:58] when we would think about that we would
[37:59] think about somebody that would be doing
[38:01] something that would just go be doing
[38:03] something wrong right a wicked act but
[38:06] there is a little bit more to that
[38:09] definition and brother Bram said in the
[38:11] message the angel of the Lord he said
[38:13] iniquity is something that you know that
[38:17] you ought to do and you will not do it
[38:22] amen so the actual Wicked act now
[38:25] becomes not doing the will of the lord
[38:28] it's an actual Wicked act to not do the
[38:30] will of the Lord
[38:33] amen and there's a mystery in this
[38:36] remember the Bible talks about balum he
[38:38] was rebuked for his iniquity the dumbass
[38:41] speaking with a man's voice forb The
[38:44] Madness of the Prophet right so when we
[38:46] think about balum was his iniquity
[38:49] because he went after the money he
[38:53] wanted the reward was that the
[38:56] iniquity no the iniquity was he forsook
[38:59] what God told him to do
[39:03] right amen and that's how the the the
[39:06] devil gets all of us he places some sort
[39:08] of reward right right puts a reward out
[39:15] there balam fell in love with the ra
[39:19] with the wages of

[39:24] brother Brandon but brother Gideon sent
[39:26] me this quote
[39:28] couple hours ago and he wanted to greet
[39:30] everybody I just got a a a sentence here
[39:35] a little bit before he gave it to me and
[39:37] he said in in the last age which is our
[39:40] age we'll find this in Samar Church age
[39:43] he says we find the blackout of the word
[39:47] the complete apostasy ending in the
[39:50] Great Tribulation amen he says if you
[39:53] are true seed if you are truly B
[39:57] baptized with the Holy Ghost right you
[40:00] will esteem his word above necessary
[40:07] meat
[40:08] and you learn to live by every word that
[40:13] proceeds out of the mouth of God he uses
[40:16] that word
[40:18] yearn in other
[40:20] words it's no longer well I hope I don't
[40:23] come to church and hear something that
[40:24] makes me you know no you want to hear
[40:28] everything that God wants you to do
[40:31] there's a yearning there amen and he
[40:33] said this is my Earnest prayer for all
[40:35] of us may we hear what the spirit is
[40:37] bringing from the word for us today turn
[40:41] with me if you would to Ezekiel 28 I
[40:43] want to go to the beginning of where
[40:45] this iniquity really all
[40:47] started Ezekiel chapter 28 verse 12 I
[40:51] want to say uh I want to welcome uh
[40:54] Debbie sister Patricia's mother-in-law
[40:58] our stepmom I'm
[40:59] sorry um to be with us today God bless
[41:03] you it's a joy to see you we think of
[41:06] you from time to
[41:07] time uh are you still living in Florida
[41:10] yes okay so you got some floods down
[41:12] there we heard of sou of you amen well
[41:18] we need to always be in prayer one for
[41:20] another amen amen Ezekiel 28:12 says son
[41:24] of man take up a lamentation upon the
[41:26] king of tyus and say to him thus sayith
[41:28] the Lord God thou seals up the s full of
[41:31] wisdom and perfect in Beauty now this is
[41:34] describing Lucifer I want to catch this
[41:38] it's the sum when we think of the sum
[41:41] it's the the entirety the wholeness and
[41:44] it said seal it in other words it's
[41:47] complete it was full of wisdom and it
[41:50] was perfect in Beauty amen we just heard
[41:53] a minister come and preach for us it was
[41:55] really good everything that God created
[41:57] was good amen eler was good as
[42:02] well he was good he was perfect in
[42:05] Beauty when God created a body for
[42:07] himself the Bible says there was no
[42:09] beauty that we should behold but when
[42:11] when God created Lucifer he wasn't only
[42:14] beautiful he was perfect in Beauty you
[42:18] could look at him and say he was
[42:20] different than everybody
[42:21] else perfect in Beauty he was full of
[42:26] wisdom so what does that mean that means
[42:28] he was pure Peaceable gentle full of
[42:34] Mercy full of good fruits without
[42:36] partiality without hypocrisy we could
[42:39] say Lucifer was full of the goodness and
[42:43] the love of
[42:45] God brother John where are you getting
[42:48] this from I'm getting this from the
[42:51] Bible he was perfect he was the pentacle
[42:54] above all the other Angels amen
[42:58] we're talking about the mystery of
[43:01] iniquity verse 13 thou has been in Eden
[43:05] the Garden of God every precious stone
[43:07] was thy covering the Sardis topz Diamond
[43:10] burel onx jaser a sapphire Emil con uh
[43:14] carbunco and gold and the workmanship of
[43:17] thy tablets and thy pipes was prepared
[43:19] in thee in the day that thou was created
[43:22] Thou Art the anointed cherub that
[43:25] coverthe soul God did this he knew what
[43:28] he was doing thou was upon the holy
[43:31] mountain of God thou was walked up and
[43:33] down the midst of the stones of fire
[43:36] thou was perfect in thy
[43:39] ways from the day thou was
[43:42] created
[43:43] till iniquity was found in him what a
[43:50] mystery what a
[43:52] mystery he was perfect and then there
[43:56] was iniquity
[43:57] what what
[43:59] happened it's a mystery but it affects
[44:02] all of
[44:03] us he was absolutely perfect until
[44:07] iniquity was found inside of his
[44:10] heart at one time iniquity wasn't there
[44:13] and then the next minute it was there a
[44:16] mystery of
[44:18] iniquity and we're going to talk about
[44:20] how it works because it happens to all
[44:22] of
[44:24] us amen amen
[44:28] amen amen I say that again amen amen it
[44:33] happens to all of us
[44:35] amen now until this point there was no
[44:38] evil or no Wicked act to do yet iniquity
[44:41] was found in
[44:43] Lucifer so what happened in his heart in
[44:46] his heart he made a decision I am going
[44:49] to stop doing what God wants me to do
[44:53] that was it God wanted him to to worship
[44:56] Him right to to put him first in his
[45:00] life and to be an example to the other
[45:04] angels and to help them in in giving God
[45:08] first place in heaven that was the will
[45:11] of
[45:12] God and he's he in his
[45:16] heart didn't want to do that no
[45:19] more now he didn't go out and go do some
[45:24] what we would call a wicked thing he
[45:26] just kind you know I don't think I need
[45:28] to do that I think I can just sit here
[45:31] and let everybody else
[45:34] worship amen I'm just you know I'm just
[45:38] choosing I just kind of want to do my
[45:42] thing come on I hope you can see this
[45:44] amen there was a turning point a turning
[45:49] point as soon as he entertain the
[45:51] thought of not doing God's will is when
[45:54] iniquity starts for not just him but for
[45:58] all of us as soon as we decide I don't
[46:03] need to do that I don't need to make
[46:05] that right I don't need to prepare I
[46:08] don't need to I don't need I don't you
[46:10] you you we read the message we listen to
[46:13] the tapes but yet we don't need to do it
[46:16] now you tell me if that's not iniquity
[46:21] amen when Jesus himself said to whom
[46:24] much is given much is required amen
[46:27] but we're going to see why it doesn't
[46:29] seem like it's that big a deal and this
[46:31] is it's just very very tricky Isaiah
[46:34] chapter
[46:36] 14:2 so this is what was happening in
[46:39] his heart how art thou fallen from
[46:41] Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how
[46:43] art thou cut down to the ground which
[46:45] this weaken the Nations and he's doing
[46:47] it big time
[46:49] today he's weakening the Nations more
[46:51] than he ever
[46:53] has for thou has said in thine heart
[46:56] this is where the iniquity was found I
[46:58] will Ascend into the heaven I will exalt
[47:02] my throne above the Stars I will sit
[47:04] upon the Mount of congregation in the
[47:06] sides of the north I will Ascend above
[47:08] the heights of the couds I will be like
[47:11] the most high now when we think of God
[47:13] we think of someone who's in control
[47:16] amen created
[47:17] everything well he pedal his idea to Eve
[47:21] that you can control your life you can
[47:24] make your own decisions she went for it
[47:28] the same thing that he pedals to
[47:31] us Lucifer had free more agency that's
[47:36] right and that's what makes conceiving
[47:39] iniquity in our lives so dangerous so
[47:42] easy for
[47:44] humans no wonder James reminded us to
[47:47] make sure that we really are searching
[47:50] for the will of God in our lives amen he
[47:53] said go to now ye that say today we're
[47:55] going to go here in this city and
[47:58] continue there a year and buy and sell
[48:01] and get gained say you don't know what
[48:03] the tomorrow is going to be our lives of
[48:06] vaporous smoke it comes for a little bit
[48:09] then it leaves you ought to say if the
[48:11] Lord will
[48:14] amen we're going to live and and we're
[48:16] going to do this and we're going to do
[48:18] that he says but if you don't do that he
[48:21] says now you rejoice in your Bings all
[48:25] such praise the Lord is
[48:28] evil all such rejoicing is evil when you
[48:31] I'm going to do this
[48:34] H and then he ends it with this in verse
[48:37] 17 James 4 if you want to write it down
[48:40] 4:17 therefore to him that knoweth to do
[48:44] good and doeth it not to him it is sin
[48:48] amen I'll say it's
[48:52] iniquity now Lucifer did not get kicked
[48:56] out of heaven as soon as he conceived
[48:58] iniquity in his heart
[49:01] right and God is not going to c k kick
[49:04] us out as soon as we get iniquity in our
[49:06] heart soon as we conceive it he's not
[49:09] going to kick us out I'm going to say
[49:11] there's a transition
[49:12] period a time where there's more than
[49:16] one desire in our heart mixed feelings
[49:18] mixed emotions mixed ideas mixed
[49:21] desires but eventually the desires for
[49:25] anything else but but God in your heart
[49:28] will take over God in your life remember
[49:32] that statement I know it's a strong
[49:34] statement but we we listen to the devil
[49:39] too much and think it's okay to have
[49:42] these things in our
[49:44] life a little this is not that bad I'm
[49:47] telling you desires outside of God are
[49:50] dangerous amen very
[49:52] dangerous David said the Lord is my
[49:55] shepherd I shall not want that's that's
[49:57] just it
[49:58] amen keep God first amen Jesus said he
[50:03] also that receiveth seed among the
[50:07] Thorns is he that heareth the word and
[50:10] the cares of this world and the
[50:12] deceitfulness of riches they choke out
[50:15] the word right and he becometh
[50:18] unfruitful
[50:20] amen you would think the word is greater
[50:22] and it's Prevail look when it comes to
[50:25] free more agency if you don't choose God
[50:28] from your heart you're on your
[50:30] own God is not going to take you you've
[50:34] got to get to a place where you get
[50:36] those other things out of your life and
[50:38] it's got to be your
[50:39] choice I thank
[50:42] God that we can come to church and hear
[50:44] the word and make a choice what we want
[50:46] to do that's what I'm thankful for that
[50:49] we have a
[50:51] chance second Timothy tells us that in
[50:54] in this age I'll say it in every Church
[50:56] Church there are lovers of pleasure more
[50:59] than lovers of God there's a
[51:02] mixture and and and and God's not going
[51:04] to
[51:06] Prevail because when we first came to
[51:09] God we gave up Pleasures we gave up the
[51:12] world we invite them back
[51:15] in what's where's that put God we're
[51:18] choosing them above
[51:20] God now another mysterious element to
[51:24] iniquity is that God allows it to be in
[51:27] our lives without
[51:30] dealing uh dealing with it
[51:33] harshly in other words if we we come to
[51:36] church and we're in tune with him we're
[51:39] prepared we'll hear the
[51:42] word and it may be just a still Small
[51:46] Voice he won't knock us over the head
[51:50] bring this overwhelming conviction just
[51:52] a little word and if we don't yield to
[51:55] it we could walk out the door and think
[51:58] everything's okay
[52:01] amen must be okay with
[52:04] God and this is what's so
[52:08] dangerous God allowed Lucifer to take
[52:11] his time in heaven to walk up and down
[52:13] the midst of the stones of the fire talk
[52:16] to all the Angels pedal his idea of
[52:19] doing your own will instead of God's and
[52:23] God never stopped him and God will never
[52:26] stop stop
[52:27] us because it's free more
[52:30] agency free more
[52:32] agency the Angels Jew said which kept
[52:35] not their first estate but left their
[52:38] own habitation I'm going to show you at
[52:41] the end how we're going to get out of
[52:42] iniquity we're going to get out of it
[52:44] but you need to see that we're choosing
[52:46] to go in it and God ain't going to just
[52:48] stop you you want to live like that you
[52:50] want iniquity in your life he'll ow
[52:54] it Ezekiel
[52:56] 28:16 says by the multitude of thy
[52:59] merchandise they have filled the midst
[53:02] with violence and thou is sinned
[53:05] therefore I will cast thee as profane
[53:07] out of the Mountain of God I will
[53:09] destroy the oh covering cherubin from
[53:11] the midst of the stones of fire thy
[53:13] heart was lifted up because of thy
[53:14] Beauty thou was corrupted thy wisdom
[53:18] notice corrupted thy perfect wisdom
[53:22] that's from above by the reason of thy
[53:25] brightness you thought you were
[53:27] something
[53:30] special when we look at our abilities
[53:33] that God has given is as if something we
[53:36] created in ourselves we can be tempted
[53:38] to be lifted up in our hearts as
[53:42] well thou has corrupted thy wisdom by
[53:45] the reason of thy brightness now instead
[53:48] of him having pure
[53:51] wisdom his wisdom became polluted it
[53:54] became selfish full of conf
[53:57] confusion instead of him being
[54:01] Peaceable his wisdom became corrupted
[54:04] with better envy and and
[54:07] strife instead of being gentle it became
[54:11] full of violence he was just violent
[54:13] with his body violent with his mouth
[54:15] violent with his
[54:17] intentions yet it was wisdom it was just
[54:20] the wisdom that been perverted from the
[54:24] wisdom of God to now the Wis wisdom of
[54:28] Satan instead of being full of Mercy he
[54:31] was once full of Mercy he became defiled
[54:34] and he his he started having
[54:36] partiality oh I like these third of the
[54:39] Angels more than these twoth thirds are
[54:41] you with me amen full of
[54:44] hypocrisy all by the reason of his own
[54:47] brightness and his own ability he took
[54:50] this god-given reason and corrupted it
[54:53] to the wisdom of Satan
[54:57] look at me angels there's none like me I
[55:01] can do my own will and God won't even
[55:05] kill me look he's over there he hasn't
[55:07] killed me he knows what's going on he's
[55:10] allowing
[55:12] it a lot of times we think God ain't
[55:15] doing nothing mean to me it's okay that
[55:18] I'm doing
[55:19] this see there's a transitional period
[55:22] to where he allows things to happen
[55:28] before the the blade comes down what is
[55:31] that thing
[55:32] called verse verse uh 18 thou has
[55:36] defiled what thy
[55:40] sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
[55:42] iniquities and by the iniquity of thy
[55:45] traffic I mean there's so much there's
[55:48] so much iniquity in the churches we
[55:50] talked about it in our men's meeting
[55:53] today there's so much sin and iniquities
[55:56] in the church it's like a traffic
[56:00] jam you can't hardly go and and and set
[56:05] your foot in a church and find the the
[56:07] purity of the word of God
[56:11] there I mean we are blessed the problem
[56:14] that we have is we're standing in the
[56:15] way of receiving from
[56:19] God he pedal his iniquities right inside
[56:23] the
[56:24] church we don't have to do God's Will
[56:27] and we can still be the Bride of Jesus
[56:29] Christ I'm in the
[56:32] message see this all is happening now
[56:35] inside the heart it's not something we
[56:37] verbally say but it happens inside the
[56:40] heart the mystery of iniquity is working
[56:43] right inside the churches
[56:46] today 2 Thessalonians 2:7 write this one
[56:49] down 2 Thessalonians 2:7 for the mystery
[56:53] of iniquity doth all ready work now
[56:58] notice this only he who now lth will let
[57:04] until he be taken out of the way notice
[57:06] that Freemore
[57:08] agency iniquity is going to stay inside
[57:11] somebody who lets to stay inside
[57:15] somebody until the appointed
[57:18] time the mystery of iniquity doth
[57:21] already work the mystery that you can be
[57:25] fre forgiven of your sins cleanse wash
[57:29] set
[57:30] aside for the service of God and at any
[57:35] given time find iniquity inside of
[57:40] you it happened to Lucifer and it
[57:43] happens to
[57:49] Believers it's a
[57:52] mystery Jesus said that in our day the
[57:55] inqu would abound it would escalate it
[57:59] would increase so much that it would
[58:01] cause the love of many people to wax
[58:05] cold indifferent self-centered I don't
[58:08] need
[58:09] them are you with me all because of one
[58:13] thing iniquity inside the person's heart
[58:17] no other
[58:20] reason because I don't I don't care if
[58:22] the whole world is evil God in you won't
[58:24] make you be indifferent
[58:27] come on you know we just get to a place
[58:29] where we don't want to be with the
[58:31] Believers we don't want to help the body
[58:32] we don't want to step in and do what we
[58:34] could do to help we're
[58:38] just I'm glad God was not like that
[58:41] towards
[58:42] me I'm glad he stepped in and helped me
[58:47] the churches are full of
[58:50] people who want a basically a one-sided
[58:53] relationship
[58:56] come on how come I'm not hearing more
[58:58] amens
[58:59] now a one-sided I want the blessings of
[59:02] God I want God to help me I want God to
[59:04] meet my
[59:07] needs what about doing what God wants us
[59:10] to do
[59:13] am you got people that rely on what
[59:16] they've achieved they rely on the gifts
[59:18] that God has given them they rely that
[59:20] they're in a message Church they rely
[59:22] that they believe every part of the
[59:23] Bible mentally
[59:27] Jesus said not everyone that saith Lord
[59:29] Lord is going to enter
[59:31] in doesn't matter what wonderful things
[59:33] that we did he said I will profess to
[59:36] them I never knew
[59:38] you depart from me ye that what
[59:42] work iniquity so you're working not
[59:46] doing what you know you should be
[59:50] doing not doing not going to the bars
[59:52] and you
[59:54] know drinking pot and taking drugs not
[59:59] that just not
[1:00:02] doing what Christ asked you to do last
[1:00:05] service the last time you read the Bible
[1:00:08] the Last Time You Prayed and conviction
[1:00:10] came you knew it was
[1:00:14] him that little bitty
[1:00:18] thing that started in Lucifer
[1:00:23] grew to something that we all hate
[1:00:31] today brother uh Marty brought the
[1:00:36] message in the men's meeting today and
[1:00:37] it it was on
[1:00:39] pride and
[1:00:43] really pride is what makes us say I
[1:00:46] don't need it's not that important I
[1:00:47] don't need to do
[1:00:49] that we're we're taught by Jesus himself
[1:00:52] that we have to live by every word of
[1:00:53] God every word
[1:00:56] so it's a mystery of iniquity it does
[1:01:00] already work it doesn't matter how many
[1:01:03] past victories we had how many
[1:01:04] deliverances how many Works we've done
[1:01:07] how many times we've been forgiven
[1:01:09] iniquity can find its way into the heart
[1:01:12] of a Believer if we do not follow the
[1:01:20] word in fact once iniquity is set in it
[1:01:24] can become more more
[1:01:28] stubborn it'll be easier not to do
[1:01:32] things you miss a couple Services all of
[1:01:35] a sudden it's easy to miss a couple
[1:01:38] Services where at one time you make a
[1:01:41] decision I'm GNA put God I'm gonna every
[1:01:43] time those doors are
[1:01:45] open do you know iniquity weakens a
[1:01:50] person Psalms 31:10 if you want to write
[1:01:53] it down Psalms 3110 for my life is spent
[1:01:56] with grief and my years with sign my
[1:02:00] strength faileth because of my
[1:02:07] iniquities my bones are consumed my
[1:02:10] strength faileth because of mine
[1:02:14] iniquity brother baham said in the power
[1:02:16] of transformation he said what is
[1:02:18] Iniquity David said if I
[1:02:21] conceive iniquity in my heart God will
[1:02:26] not hear me think about that just the
[1:02:31] conception just just
[1:02:34] now making that little thought I don't
[1:02:36] need to do that I don't need to make
[1:02:38] that right I don't need to be nice I'm
[1:02:40] just gonna be in different as soon as
[1:02:43] you conceive that the word of God tells
[1:02:46] you God will not hear your prayers amen
[1:02:49] now that's strong
[1:02:57] the brandham said and you if you want to
[1:02:59] write that down that's Psalm 6618
[1:03:01] iniquity is something that you know that
[1:03:03] you ought to do and you won't do it you
[1:03:05] know better but you won't do it see it's
[1:03:08] iniquity what iniquity does in a
[1:03:10] person's heart is it
[1:03:12] keeps
[1:03:14] you it keeps God from moving in your
[1:03:20] behalf you know you got to make sure
[1:03:23] that all the iniquity is out that's
[1:03:24] number one just get it
[1:03:27] out brother man makes a statement God is
[1:03:30] not obligated to to to tell you anything
[1:03:32] more to reveal anything to more to you
[1:03:34] until you first walk in the light that
[1:03:36] he gave you and to me when I sin when I
[1:03:39] sin I make a mistake I I um conceive
[1:03:43] iniquity into my heart if i and God
[1:03:46] speaks to me if I don't make that thing
[1:03:48] right how can I expect God to do
[1:03:51] anything more for
[1:03:54] me that's what the word is for the word
[1:03:56] comes and it it's a light to our path it
[1:03:59] shows us how to live we're not looking
[1:04:02] for a church that fits our idea we're
[1:04:04] looking for the word so we can know how
[1:04:06] to fit God's
[1:04:08] ideas Jesus said in Luke 6:46 why call
[1:04:12] me Lord Lord and do not the things I
[1:04:18] say good
[1:04:20] question he's really not Lord is he if
[1:04:24] we're not doing what he tells us to to
[1:04:25] do he's really not
[1:04:31] Lord how many loves your
[1:04:35] tongue good how many sometimes hate your
[1:04:41] tongue wow James said even so the tongue
[1:04:45] is a little
[1:04:47] member and it boasts great things behold
[1:04:52] how great a matter a little fire
[1:04:54] kindleth and the tongue is a fire a
[1:04:58] world of
[1:05:01] iniquity right out of the mouth so is
[1:05:05] the tongue among our members that it
[1:05:07] defileth the whole body and sth on fire
[1:05:11] the course of Nature and it is set on
[1:05:14] fire of
[1:05:17] hell just
[1:05:21] this you ever say something and you're
[1:05:24] just like oh you just felt so yucky
[1:05:26] afterwards that is the Fulfillment of
[1:05:29] the scripture
[1:05:30] here it just defiles your whole
[1:05:33] body every every kind of the Beast the
[1:05:36] birds and serpents and things in the sea
[1:05:38] is tamed and have been tamed by mankind
[1:05:41] but the tongue can no man
[1:05:43] tame no man can do it it's an unruly
[1:05:45] evil it's full of deadly
[1:05:48] poison Bible talks about a man that
[1:05:50] cannot Bridle his
[1:05:53] tongue see it takes the Holy Ghost to
[1:05:56] come inside and I want to get to that
[1:05:59] that that's the power through the the
[1:06:01] the mystery of godliness can take take
[1:06:04] care of that but he says therewith we we
[1:06:07] bless God even the father and therewith
[1:06:09] we curse
[1:06:10] men which are made after the similitude
[1:06:13] of God out of the mouth it precedes
[1:06:17] blessings and
[1:06:19] cursings my brethren these things ought
[1:06:22] not to be but we allow them
[1:06:26] we allow it you know what we say we say
[1:06:29] hey we're all
[1:06:32] human hey you know everybody does it to
[1:06:36] me we we just we we make every excuse
[1:06:40] instead of saying Lord come inside of me
[1:06:43] and control this tongue tame this tongue
[1:06:45] I can't do it but I know you can Lord
[1:06:48] fill me with your spirit see it's got to
[1:06:50] go through free more agency and I'm
[1:06:53] sorry if you're too proud that you can't
[1:06:55] call on God and say God take this evil
[1:06:58] thing out of me and fill me with more of
[1:06:59] your spirit God how can God come
[1:07:02] inside he wants you to humble yourself
[1:07:07] right the mystery of iniquity doth
[1:07:10] already work only he who now
[1:07:17] lth today if you will hear his voice and
[1:07:20] Harden not your heart see if somebody's
[1:07:23] got a hard heart
[1:07:27] it's because they hardened it they
[1:07:30] rejected the
[1:07:33] word I don't let anybody control my
[1:07:36] heart
[1:07:40] nobody
[1:07:42] look many
[1:07:46] times we've let the wrong things in our
[1:07:48] heart we've been
[1:07:51] hurt our heart belongs to
[1:07:54] God God will never hurt
[1:07:58] you he may want you to suffer to help
[1:08:01] somebody but that ain't hurting you
[1:08:03] that's just doing the work of the Lord
[1:08:06] right we may have to crucify our flesh
[1:08:09] so God can have his way but that ain't
[1:08:11] hurting
[1:08:12] us but sometimes we let the wrong things
[1:08:15] into our
[1:08:16] heart and then we become
[1:08:20] hardened and the biggest thing that we
[1:08:22] let in our heart is our will nobody's
[1:08:25] going to tell me I can't cut my hair I
[1:08:27] can't listen I can't do this nobody's
[1:08:29] going to tell
[1:08:34] me we just Lord not my will thy will be
[1:08:42] done the key to get rid of iniquity is
[1:08:45] just not asking for
[1:08:48] forgiveness it's taking a stand against
[1:08:50] it in your
[1:08:51] life we are so used and look I thank God
[1:08:55] for the
[1:08:57] blood but brother Brandon brought us a
[1:09:00] message that should open our eyes it's
[1:09:02] called the
[1:09:04] token and when it's the Life of Christ
[1:09:07] that comes into a Believer it's no
[1:09:09] longer you anymore it's God in you
[1:09:13] Christ in you the hope of
[1:09:16] glory now the word can become
[1:09:19] manifested so I say this if you want
[1:09:22] iniquity out of your life you've got to
[1:09:24] take a stand against
[1:09:26] it take a stand against
[1:09:29] it don't let Disobedience stain your
[1:09:32] life don't say it's not that big a thing
[1:09:35] everybody does
[1:09:36] it well maybe everybody ain't going in
[1:09:39] the
[1:09:42] Rapture second Timothy 2:19 nevertheless
[1:09:46] the foundation of God standeth sure
[1:09:49] having this
[1:09:50] seal the Lord knows them that are his
[1:09:54] and let everyone that nameth the name of
[1:09:56] Christ depart from iniquity that's free
[1:10:01] more
[1:10:03] agency it doesn't say be
[1:10:06] delivered it says depart make a
[1:10:10] choice I want to start doing everything
[1:10:12] God wants me to
[1:10:14] do you know I don't care if they call me
[1:10:16] a goody goodie a Holy Roller I don't
[1:10:19] care what they call me I want to do what
[1:10:21] God wants I yearn to do the word of God
[1:10:24] I'm a real believer
[1:10:27] I've heard the voice of
[1:10:29] God I love that Psalms 32:1 write this
[1:10:33] one down David said blessed is he whose
[1:10:37] transgression Is Forgiven whose sin is
[1:10:39] covered blessed is the man unto whom the
[1:10:43] Lord imputeth not
[1:10:46] iniquity and whose Spirit there is no gu
[1:10:51] so blessed is the man who the Lord will
[1:10:54] not take in
[1:10:57] we know that there's many people that
[1:10:58] are come in in in that day and say Lord
[1:11:01] Lord didn't we prophesy cast out devils
[1:11:03] and do all these works in your name but
[1:11:06] he still is taken invatory of their
[1:11:09] iniquity but there's a group of
[1:11:13] people a group of people who depart from
[1:11:16] iniquity yeah they still committed it
[1:11:19] David still committed it but he departed
[1:11:22] from it he just didn't say Lord forgive
[1:11:25] me but he departed from it and the Bible
[1:11:28] says blessed is the
[1:11:31] man whom the Lord will not impute
[1:11:37] iniquity I love
[1:11:40] that how many love the
[1:11:45] word in the message the former and
[1:11:48] latter Reign now for those that have not
[1:11:50] said very much during the service the
[1:11:53] the rest of the service is your your
[1:11:55] turn is your
[1:11:58] turn in the message former letter r
[1:12:00] brother brand says now you and I can
[1:12:03] have no more God in
[1:12:06] us than what we can yield ourself
[1:12:13] wow did you know I can be full of God
[1:12:16] today and grieve the Lord
[1:12:19] tomorrow and he can stay away from me as
[1:12:22] long as I do my own
[1:12:27] thing you got to abide in the
[1:12:30] vine it's not one of these things where
[1:12:33] you know we we we repent get baptized
[1:12:36] and we're so sealed up with the Holy
[1:12:37] Ghost that nothing we can do is
[1:12:42] wrong I want I'm stressing this because
[1:12:46] brother Brandon really makes a
[1:12:50] point you and I can have no more of God
[1:12:53] in us than what we can
[1:12:56] ourselves as much as brother brandom can
[1:12:58] get out of the way God will come in but
[1:13:02] as long as William brandom is there God
[1:13:05] has no way of getting
[1:13:07] in and it's the same with you he said
[1:13:11] it's getting ourselves out of the way
[1:13:14] not looking the way we think not doing
[1:13:17] the way we think but letting him do our
[1:13:21] thinking let him do our looking and
[1:13:24] listen to the Holy
[1:13:29] Spirit The Mystery of iniquity does
[1:13:34] already work no matter how long you've
[1:13:37] been in the message iniquity can set in
[1:13:39] any
[1:13:41] time no matter how far along you are in
[1:13:45] God the latter however you want to say
[1:13:48] it iniquity can set in any time no
[1:13:51] matter if you have a heart just like
[1:13:54] David did for God iniquity can set in at
[1:13:58] any
[1:14:00] time for the mystery of iniquity death
[1:14:03] already where only he who now lth will
[1:14:07] let we're in
[1:14:09] control we're in control so as long as I
[1:14:13] let it in my life it's
[1:14:17] there when I say I don't want it there I
[1:14:20] want to do what the Lord wants me to do
[1:14:23] then it gets out he see God works
[1:14:26] through free more agency he doesn't have
[1:14:29] robots iniquity is nothing to play
[1:14:32] around
[1:14:34] with the mystery of iniquity is that
[1:14:37] something
[1:14:38] perfect can become contaminated amen
[1:14:42] that's the
[1:14:44] mystery at any time by allowing
[1:14:46] ourselves not to obey some part of the
[1:14:50] word get away from that thinking of well
[1:14:53] I follow most the word that's all you
[1:14:55] know God you know he's grading on a
[1:14:59] curve iniquity is so mysterious it has
[1:15:04] power to take a
[1:15:06] Sanctified life and pervert it with just
[1:15:10] a wrong
[1:15:13] attitude but what else has a mysterious
[1:15:16] power is godliness I want to try to take
[1:15:18] the rest of the service and talk about
[1:15:21] this so please pray for me 1 Timothy
[1:15:24] chapter 3 verse1 15 the mystery of
[1:15:29] godliness the first half was stay
[1:15:34] away from what can bring you down and
[1:15:36] discourage
[1:15:38] you and this half is what we need to
[1:15:42] yield ourselves to so that Christ can
[1:15:44] become manifested in our life and he
[1:15:47] says here in 1 Timothy 3:15 but if I T
[1:15:50] long that thou mayest know how thou
[1:15:53] oughtest to behave thyself in the house
[1:15:54] of God which is the Church of the Living
[1:15:56] God the pillar and the ground of the
[1:15:58] truth and without
[1:16:00] controversy no debate great is the
[1:16:04] mystery of
[1:16:06] godliness God was manifest In the
[1:16:12] Flesh wow you know when iniquity is in
[1:16:15] our life that's Satan manifested in the
[1:16:21] flesh but when godliness
[1:16:25] is manifested is in your life and it's
[1:16:27] in your life God has manifested you
[1:16:30] sisters praise God you don't cut your
[1:16:32] hair that's God manifested In the Flesh
[1:16:36] right you Brothers you don't toss and
[1:16:39] swear and your mouth profanity and you
[1:16:41] keep yourself pure that is God
[1:16:43] manifested In the
[1:16:46] Flesh God was manifested justified in
[1:16:49] the spirit seen of angels preached unto
[1:16:51] the Gentiles believed on in the world
[1:16:54] received up into Glory the mystery of
[1:16:58] godliness is when God can come inside
[1:17:01] your flesh your flesh and manifest
[1:17:05] himself instead of you get out of the
[1:17:08] way John
[1:17:11] Martin I've made a decision it's in my
[1:17:13] heart I made a decision I just want God
[1:17:15] there I want him in my life that's
[1:17:19] it I don't need no special
[1:17:23] oils I don't I I don't need to go on a
[1:17:25] 40-day fast don't misunderstand
[1:17:27] me I just need to make a decision I
[1:17:30] really want God preeminent in my life I
[1:17:33] want God to take control
[1:17:35] right and I know it's not a One-Shot
[1:17:38] deal I pray this prayer today and is
[1:17:39] good for the rest of the month it don't
[1:17:41] work like
[1:17:42] that because Satan is trying to get
[1:17:44] other Desires in your heart trying to
[1:17:47] bring confusion to your
[1:17:49] life if iniquity can come inside of us
[1:17:52] at any time and corrupt us that means
[1:17:54] godliness can come inside of us anytime
[1:17:56] and clean up our life clean up our
[1:17:58] habits clean up our our Behavior the way
[1:18:01] we talk to one
[1:18:02] another God can come inside us any
[1:18:07] time and
[1:18:10] manifest
[1:18:13] godliness I like
[1:18:15] that if Satan can come in God can come
[1:18:22] in if Satan has power to do it
[1:18:26] through deception trying to get us
[1:18:28] things that we don't really shouldn't
[1:18:31] have that means God can come inside of
[1:18:34] us and take
[1:18:39] control it's the mystery of
[1:18:42] godliness all right 2 Timothy 3:1 this
[1:18:46] know that in the last days perilous time
[1:18:48] shall come just stay with me for men
[1:18:50] shall be lovers of their own self this
[1:18:52] is what's happening in the church today
[1:18:54] Covetous bolsters proud blasphemers
[1:18:56] disobedient appearance unthankful Unholy
[1:18:59] without natural affection truth Breakers
[1:19:00] false accusers incontinent Fierce
[1:19:02] despisers of those that are good
[1:19:04] traitors hey High minded lovers of
[1:19:06] pleasure more than lovers of God now
[1:19:07] look at this verse five having a
[1:19:10] form of
[1:19:13] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:19:16] from such turn away now notice a form of
[1:19:19] godliness is missing something just like
[1:19:22] hope is missing the sub
[1:19:27] that faith
[1:19:29] has well a form of godliness is missing
[1:19:32] something that real godliness
[1:19:35] has godliness has power yes it is the
[1:19:40] power of God inside of
[1:19:43] you but a form of
[1:19:47] godliness doesn't have power so it can
[1:19:50] act like the devil anytime it wants to
[1:19:52] come on it can be boastful and proud and
[1:19:56] all these things that we made
[1:19:58] mention godliness is a power that
[1:20:01] manifests Christ inside each and every
[1:20:03] one of
[1:20:05] us but just a form of godliness will
[1:20:08] deny that power to manifest Christ it'll
[1:20:10] talk talk talk but it won't manifest
[1:20:15] it second Peter chapter 1 verse 3 and 4
[1:20:20] I want to read according as his divine
[1:20:23] power power the Holy Ghost have given
[1:20:26] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:20:28] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:20:33] of him that called us to glory and
[1:20:35] virtue whereby are given unto us
[1:20:38] exceeding great and precious
[1:20:43] standing
[1:20:47] standing exceeding great and precious
[1:20:50] promises that by these precious promises
[1:20:53] we might be
[1:20:56] partakers of the divine nature if I
[1:21:00] could say it like this
[1:21:03] godliness look this is a mystery but you
[1:21:06] take the word of God and you believe it
[1:21:09] if God said you can live holy that that
[1:21:12] God can contain your mouth and you
[1:21:14] believe it you stand on that
[1:21:18] promise if God says you're healed I
[1:21:20] don't care what your body says stand
[1:21:23] there whatever the word says you stand
[1:21:26] on the
[1:21:27] promise the very fact that you're
[1:21:29] willing to believe against your feelings
[1:21:32] against your emotions against time
[1:21:35] that's time lapse that there's been
[1:21:37] since you started believing the fact
[1:21:39] that you're still believing to me is
[1:21:41] evidence it's
[1:21:44] evidence because real Faith don't
[1:21:47] stop it keeps believing it keeps
[1:21:51] believing the mystery of God's divine
[1:21:55] nature manifested inside of you if we
[1:21:59] were just if we honestly just I know
[1:22:01] that a lot of us we go through a lot of
[1:22:04] Trials and tests and we we just feel
[1:22:08] like we're
[1:22:09] always
[1:22:11] behind always
[1:22:15] behind and I don't mean it wrong but I
[1:22:19] believe Paul faced the same
[1:22:22] thing the Apostle Paul
[1:22:25] he knew he
[1:22:27] was behind in the aspect of where he
[1:22:31] needed to be he said I press towards the
[1:22:35] mark so I understand what it means to
[1:22:38] feel like you're not on Victory Lane I
[1:22:42] understand
[1:22:42] that but we need to have a
[1:22:47] confession a
[1:22:50] confession I I am not going to listen to
[1:22:53] the devil I am not going to entertain
[1:22:55] things that are outside of this
[1:22:57] word I am going to be faithful to the
[1:22:59] slightest little thing this word says
[1:23:02] every day I will make all my wrongs
[1:23:04] right
[1:23:06] amen this is the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:09] if you make that choice the mystery of
[1:23:12] godliness before you know God will
[1:23:14] become manifest in your flesh but you've
[1:23:16] got to take a
[1:23:19] stand get
[1:23:22] desperate desperate
[1:23:26] all right brother bam said the message
[1:23:27] is the absolute without
[1:23:29] controversy he said 'great is the
[1:23:31] mystery of godliness for God was
[1:23:32] manifested in the flesh seen of angels
[1:23:35] received up in glory he was God he come
[1:23:38] to take Sinners place yes sir and when
[1:23:41] God raised him up on the third day it
[1:23:43] was for our justification therefore
[1:23:46] exalted at the right hand of the Majesty
[1:23:48] on high he is in he is an intercessor to
[1:23:51] make intercessions for our weakness
[1:23:55] yes now notice this this is the same
[1:23:58] sentence to make intercession for our
[1:24:02] weaknesses which we all got these right
[1:24:05] here's how we deal with them as we
[1:24:07] confess it to him and die out to
[1:24:12] ourself placing his word back inside of
[1:24:17] us he said the
[1:24:20] promise and our faith makes the word
[1:24:24] live
[1:24:26] yes I I I know it's
[1:24:29] simple but this is this is the mystery
[1:24:32] of God becoming manifested in their
[1:24:33] lives that's right amen and our faith
[1:24:37] makes the word live because Christ is in
[1:24:40] us the quickener to the
[1:24:43] word I can't Quicken the word he
[1:24:46] quickens the word he quickens us he
[1:24:49] makes it live inside of US 1 Timothy
[1:24:52] chap 6:3
[1:24:55] If any man Teach
[1:24:57] otherwise if any man Teach otherwise and
[1:25:01] consent not to Wholesome words even the
[1:25:06] words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to
[1:25:09] the doctrine which is according to
[1:25:13] Godliness he is
[1:25:15] proud knowing
[1:25:17] nothing but dotting about questions and
[1:25:21] Stripes of words whereof cometh Envy
[1:25:24] Strife railings evil
[1:25:26] surmisings perverse disputings of men of
[1:25:30] corrupt Minds destitute of the truth
[1:25:32] supposing that gain is
[1:25:35] godliness but such withdraw thyself from
[1:25:38] such turn
[1:25:40] away but
[1:25:42] godliness with
[1:25:44] contentment is a great gain where should
[1:25:48] we be putting our
[1:25:50] emphasis how can I how can I please him
[1:25:53] a little B more am be content with
[1:25:57] that I'll tell you that'll bring his
[1:26:01] promises that'll make
[1:26:04] you that'll Supply every need you put
[1:26:08] God first he said he would Supply every
[1:26:12] need amen
[1:26:18] now God can take a human being in any
[1:26:21] state any condition any evil situation
[1:26:23] if he turn turns his free moral agency
[1:26:26] towards God towards obeying the word of
[1:26:28] God no matter how wrong he's done God
[1:26:31] will take that person and
[1:26:34] mysteriously will begin to manifest
[1:26:36] himself in that
[1:26:39] person all because he's turning towards
[1:26:43] God that's all God
[1:26:45] wants there's nothing you can do to make
[1:26:48] up for the evil you've
[1:26:50] done
[1:26:52] nothing nothing just turn turn turn a
[1:26:55] little closer get get a little closer to
[1:26:57] God say God I yearn for more of your
[1:27:00] word look we're living in an age where
[1:27:03] the devil is throwing every desire he
[1:27:05] can towards you so you just don't have
[1:27:08] time for
[1:27:12] God all right are you with me all right
[1:27:17] Colossians 1:24 I know this is a lot but
[1:27:19] I hope down the road when you get time
[1:27:23] and think about this it'll be a blessing
[1:27:24] to
[1:27:25] you first or Colossians 1:24 who now
[1:27:30] rejoice in my sufferings of course we
[1:27:32] all have to be all of us are going to
[1:27:34] suffer when we turn towards the Lord
[1:27:37] because we got to give up the flesh
[1:27:39] right so now rejoice in my sufferings
[1:27:42] for you fill up that which is behind of
[1:27:44] the afflictions of Christ in my flesh
[1:27:46] for the body's sake which is the church
[1:27:48] wherefore I made a minister according to
[1:27:50] the dispensation of God which is given
[1:27:51] to me for you to fulfill the word of God
[1:27:54] even the mystery which had been hid from
[1:27:58] ages and from Generations but now is
[1:28:00] made manifest to his Saints to whom God
[1:28:04] would make known what is the riches of
[1:28:07] the glory of this mystery among the
[1:28:10] Gentiles which is Christ in
[1:28:14] you it's the hope of
[1:28:18] glory we're not there yet Saints today
[1:28:21] is the day of
[1:28:22] salvation I mean if God would take us
[1:28:24] today we can say we're ready we feel
[1:28:26] we're ready to go but look it don't
[1:28:29] matter what I've done in the past it
[1:28:31] don't put me there it's where I'm
[1:28:34] standing today it's where my heart is at
[1:28:37] today I've got to make sure I have not
[1:28:40] conceived iniquity that it's important
[1:28:43] to me to do the will of God in my
[1:28:47] life all right verse 28 whom we preach
[1:28:51] warning every man
[1:28:54] and teaching every
[1:28:56] man in all
[1:28:59] wisdom for what purpose that we may
[1:29:02] present every man perfect in Christ
[1:29:07] Jesus wherein to I also labor striving
[1:29:11] according to his working which worketh
[1:29:13] mightily in
[1:29:15] me oh if we had time to get into
[1:29:18] Ephesians chapter 5 if you want to read
[1:29:20] that
[1:29:21] sometime it's talking about it's starts
[1:29:24] out where wives should be subject to
[1:29:26] their
[1:29:27] husbands and and that the husband is the
[1:29:29] head of the wife showing a position in a
[1:29:32] place but yet they're one they're one
[1:29:36] Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone and
[1:29:39] then he talks about the church the
[1:29:40] church is subject to God subject to the
[1:29:44] Holy
[1:29:45] Ghost they get the the their leadership
[1:29:49] from the Holy Ghost but the real
[1:29:52] mystery is that that Christ and the
[1:29:55] church are
[1:29:59] one the mystery of
[1:30:04] godliness the mystery of godliness
[1:30:07] unfolds as each Christian lets God have
[1:30:10] more of the preeminence in their life
[1:30:12] and I just want to read this verses in
[1:30:13] Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of
[1:30:16] the body the church who is the beginning
[1:30:18] the firstborn of the Dead that in all
[1:30:20] things he might have the preeminence
[1:30:24] God wants the
[1:30:27] preeminence
[1:30:29] remember at one time when God created
[1:30:34] Lucifer God had preeminence in his
[1:30:38] life and when God first saved us we
[1:30:41] surrendered our life we
[1:30:44] repented we gave him preeminence things
[1:30:47] begin to change I got rid of my my my
[1:30:50] cigarettes I got rid of my my drugs I
[1:30:54] got rid of my uh Records I got rid of my
[1:30:58] long hair I got rid of my girly
[1:31:02] clothes things begin to
[1:31:05] happen but you know what the mystery of
[1:31:08] iniquity it still
[1:31:10] works things can creep in any
[1:31:15] time
[1:31:17] anytime but God is here to let us know
[1:31:21] there's a mystery of godliness if we
[1:31:24] just let God have preeminence in our
[1:31:26] life starting right now forget the past
[1:31:29] right now give God preeminence and
[1:31:31] you'll see before you know it you'll
[1:31:33] have the joy of the
[1:31:35] Lord you'll have peace you'll be able to
[1:31:38] love everybody no matter if they slap
[1:31:40] you across the
[1:31:41] face it's a truth everybody could be
[1:31:45] against you but God is right there for
[1:31:49] you amen all right
[1:31:54] see time you know I just want you to
[1:31:57] understand brother
[1:31:59] Mark he stopped 15 minutes
[1:32:02] early and I
[1:32:04] know he'd gladly give me that 15
[1:32:09] minutes in the message the leoan church
[1:32:11] age brother Ram says now I said a moment
[1:32:14] ago that the false Vine came into full
[1:32:17] Fu in this age her fruit would mature
[1:32:22] and ripen that is correct
[1:32:24] this evil spirited Church full of
[1:32:27] iniquity will be revealed as the mustard
[1:32:30] seed that grew into a tree that lodged
[1:32:33] the fowls of the air at her head will be
[1:32:37] the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity
[1:32:40] all this is true and if this is true
[1:32:44] then it must also be true that the bride
[1:32:48] uh the bride church WIll mature and her
[1:32:52] rightness will be the
[1:32:54] identification with her Lord by the
[1:32:56] means of the word and her head who will
[1:32:59] come into her is the mystery of
[1:33:03] godliness now you want to know what's
[1:33:05] special about this
[1:33:07] quote my message was already done when I
[1:33:10] found this
[1:33:12] quote I just love that brother
[1:33:15] Marty which indeed is Christ and as the
[1:33:20] false church with all cunning and
[1:33:23] diabolical power made up of political
[1:33:26] force physical Force Demons of Darkness
[1:33:29] come against the True Vine the True Vine
[1:33:31] with the fullness of the spirit and the
[1:33:34] word will do the acts and the power that
[1:33:37] Jesus did then is she near as The
[1:33:40] Headstone becoming like him through the
[1:33:42] word Jesus will come that bride and
[1:33:45] groom will be forever United as
[1:33:49] one isn't that
[1:33:51] beautiful you write it down 1 John
[1:33:54] 3: 1 through3 it does not yet appear but
[1:33:57] we know when he shall appear we shall be
[1:34:00] like him it's going to
[1:34:02] happen in the message
[1:34:05] Shalom and I'm I'm
[1:34:08] closing I'm in the midst of closing I
[1:34:11] don't want to interrupt that with saying
[1:34:13] I've
[1:34:14] closed brother Brenham said in the
[1:34:16] message Shalom without controversy
[1:34:19] that's argument great is the mystery of
[1:34:20] godliness for God was manifested or made
[1:34:23] known in the flesh isn't that wonderful
[1:34:25] God now God is a man and he's identified
[1:34:28] himself today in the church in the born
[1:34:31] again Christian God identifies himself
[1:34:36] that he remains God and the outside
[1:34:39] world will only know God as they see God
[1:34:45] in you and I and how many times have you
[1:34:49] said that in the men's
[1:34:51] meeting that's the only way
[1:34:54] that they'll know God is when we are
[1:34:58] written
[1:34:59] Epistles Epistles of the scripture we
[1:35:02] are R of all men and the life that we
[1:35:05] live reflects the life that's inside of
[1:35:08] us a man is identified by The Works that
[1:35:11] he
[1:35:12] does so our works should be good see
[1:35:15] always good because we are representing
[1:35:19] our Lord Jesus
[1:35:21] Christ the only way that we can
[1:35:25] eradicate iniquity from our lives is to
[1:35:29] let Christ come inside of us in a great
[1:35:33] greater measure now the thing is if I
[1:35:35] just start I a't done it yet outwardly
[1:35:39] but I just conceive it inside of my
[1:35:43] heart already I have put up a barrier
[1:35:47] between me and
[1:35:49] God and God will not hear my prayer now
[1:35:52] that's just what the scripture says
[1:35:54] says I believe if we repent of the thing
[1:35:58] that he's speaking to us hey you should
[1:36:00] you really do need to pray you really do
[1:36:03] need to read you really do need to
[1:36:04] listen to tapes you really do need to
[1:36:06] make things right if we listen to that
[1:36:09] we repent we listen to that that means
[1:36:11] God will hear our prayer
[1:36:16] am that's how we can become more like
[1:36:20] Christ last quote from the Samaran
[1:36:22] Church age he said if you are a
[1:36:26] Christian you will get back to what the
[1:36:28] spirit is
[1:36:29] teaching he said that's it the word of
[1:36:33] this
[1:36:34] age every Messenger to every age will
[1:36:38] preach the word every fresh and true
[1:36:42] Revival will be because men have gotten
[1:36:45] back to the word for their age The Cry
[1:36:48] of every age is to rebuke you have left
[1:36:51] the word of God repent and come back to
[1:36:54] the
[1:36:54] word from the first book in the Bible to
[1:36:57] the last book in Revelations there is
[1:37:00] only one reason for God's
[1:37:04] displeasure leaving the word and there's
[1:37:08] only one remedy to regain God's favor
[1:37:12] and that's come back to the
[1:37:14] word let's stand
[1:37:16] together two great Mysteries iniquity
[1:37:20] and
[1:37:21] godliness as Lucifer
[1:37:24] perverted a third of the angels from
[1:37:27] godliness to
[1:37:28] iniquity Christ is going to
[1:37:31] restore his seed from iniquity to
[1:37:38] Godliness through the power of the holy
[1:37:40] spirit amen I believe that with all my
[1:37:46] heart amen let's sing that I'm going to
[1:37:48] live the way he wants me to
[1:37:51] live just let's make that commitment in
[1:37:54] our
[1:37:59] heart I'm going to
[1:38:02] live the
[1:38:05] way he wants me to live I'm going to

[1:39:53] brother brenon often rededicated himself
[1:39:56] to the
[1:39:59] Lord wanted to make sure there was
[1:40:02] nothing
[1:40:05] there job look all the time that he
[1:40:08] spent even praying for his children for
[1:40:10] their
[1:40:13] sins I believe in this area that
[1:40:16] whatever time that we have to steal away
[1:40:18] to spend time calling on God God is
[1:40:22] there anything
[1:40:24] inside of me that you want me to take
[1:40:25] care of I believe that time that you
[1:40:28] spend doing that is your it's the weight
[1:40:31] in in in gold as as they say it would be
[1:40:35] worth anything that you else can do with
[1:40:38] that time we need our hearts are
[1:40:41] deceptive no man can know our heart we
[1:40:45] it needs it takes the word of God to to
[1:40:48] to uh discern our heart and and to let
[1:40:51] us know what what crept in
[1:40:55] unawares
[1:40:56] Amen in
[1:41:04] the of
[1:41:10] jeh God
