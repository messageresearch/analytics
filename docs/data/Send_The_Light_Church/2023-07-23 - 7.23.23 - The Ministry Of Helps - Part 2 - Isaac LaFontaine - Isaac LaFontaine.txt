really appreciate that worship service amen I believe my my heart's prepared I believe it's it's ready for the word and the word is our direction for our life you know when the minister is standing up and he says something God can speak to our situation without speaking about our situation and so that's why we've got to have ears to hear what the spirit is saying and I believe God's word is that real and and if we can just be prepared for that I believe we can receive more from the Lord amen well we've been praying about part two for a while Amen brother Isaac come on up here and uh we're we're grateful that that day has arrived and I I'll say this I hunger for our church to to grow in in character in in maturity as well as in Souls and um I just want our brother take his Liberty he said he felt real at home last time we want that to continue yeah good thank you God bless you good morning and can I use the pulpitter okay I'm just gonna let this one set aside okay I'm not very polished at this for sure I'm just uh if I don't have to hold anything then that's probably better can we just bow our heads for a second before we begin dear heavenly father thank you Lord Jesus for this this message Lord God that's about to come forth in this this content is so exciting to me Lord what you have in your scripture God that just jumps right out and jumps off the page sometimes and it's so simple Lord God that we can just walk right in it Lord Jesus and and these little uh these little nuggets of wisdom Lord God that you lay in your word and then when you find one you end up finding another and you Lord you've given us an eyesight to begin to see Lord Jesus these things as they come out at us Lord Jesus and I pray father that it would help to strengthen the body of Christ here Lord God at this church and I pray dear heavenly father that it would just Inspire these that are here God to to move forward and that when you return Lord God which we believe is very soon that you'll find us working together and loving one another and working for the kingdom as we're Lord Jesus and you'll find us ready and happy and working together and trusting one another and and father just exactly just the the the just the exactly the way it should be Lord God in our hearts father with the fruits of the spirit God in the action and all of the Ministries within the body of Christ just working together Lord God peace and love Lord God so that anyone that would look upon God would could see and know as your scripture says that they are Christians by their love dear heavenly father I pray you bless the service today God help me to work through the the information that I have here Lord that you gave me and I pray father that you'd help me to disseminate it in a way that they would be able to understand nor God you have your way in this service Lord God whatever is to be said or done Lord God you take complete control of that now in Jesus name amen amen y'all may be seated for a moment I'm gonna get caught up here where I'm at get that PowerPoint presentation up there we go okay uh last time so what I think what we'll do is just do a quick review of what we said last time and then we'll pick up from the the really exciting part that we we have as part two here so last time we'll just go through these slides real quick the ministry of helps this was the scripture we were referencing where it does talks about healings helps governments diversities of tongue these these other the ones up front here the apostles prophets and teachers we we fully aware of those as being Ministries in the body of Christ but some of these other ones here a little bit harder for us to Define sometimes what does it really mean to to be in the ministry of helps or that part of the body of Christ so we're trying to identify some of those things as we went forward and uh this is a definition of help to make it easier for someone to do something by offering one service or resources pretty simple right and then I asked you what is a Christian and then I said what does a Christian do since we've been given this tremendous gift of the blood of Jesus on our lives what does that invoke what does that cause us to do in in return is it something that we just continue to take in I think we say that we're saved we're baptized we're filled with the Holy Spirit what but what actions are there and we talked about the scripture that talks about faith without works is dead we talked about that somehow there's going to be some action that we partake in rather than just the reading and the praying and continue to take in co-worked we're coming to church and attending church is is great but then there's some things maybe we can do and this is a little bit difficult because immediately when we start talking about things that you can do everybody gets a little bit defensive like we're all very busy people in this day and age right so is he trying to get volunteers to come to the church and clean the lawn or what is he trying to do here what's I'm not trying to pull a fast one on you there are some specific things that you can do that have a spiritual impact on the church on your community on the other believers within the body and on your life and I'm telling you that I told my my mom sold story that when she was saved there was just an understanding that when you're saved you're saved to serve in some way I go to a church uh on Sunday mornings at 8 A.M usually and I'd run sound for them and it hasn't conflicted with my own uh post of Duty at my church so I've been doing it for years it's uh Pastor Marvin Winans from Detroit comes all the way to Toledo and pastors little church down there it's a little Pentecostal independent church perfecting Church Toledo and one of the things they say that I really latched on to and like is he said we the the minister said the pastor says we don't uh let's see we don't have or what kind of members do we have here and the congregation says working members we only have one kind of member and it's working members so they they start things off with the mentality that we're going to be working together as a body from the very beginning so this this uh mentality that you're just going to sit and receive the word and then go home or Fellowship a little bit and we're thinking about what restaurant we're going to afterwards those things we're just going to start to put that out of our minds a little bit preparing you for a different type of thinking it's so easy to fall into that this day and age is trying desperately to get you to have some restful thoughts and your mind is going to take the path of least resistance so whatever it can do to rest or to stay back and not have to engage itself it's going to do your body's going to do the same thing so in order for someone to get healthier or to lose weight and I know this personally personally from the struggle of trying to lose weight if you're going to move the ball forward in anything in any discipline in life natural or spiritual it's going to take an amount of effort equal to and above the status quo you're gonna have to move forward somehow uh we work as unto the Lord we work for the kingdom of God we've talked about the Dead Sea being that it takes in tremendous amounts of water but there's no Outlet to it it's an unhealthy place right it's just full of salt you can float on the surface of it because the salt content is so high we don't want to be Christians that are that way a healthy a healthy Christian walk has the intake of everything that we're taking in we're reading and we're praying and we're doing these things but there's also an outlet a way that we can release some of that and we can talk to somebody else about what's going on we can fellowship and share what's on our hearts and and uh confess our faults one to another there's a lot that is engaged in that but we do not want to be an intake only Christian right we talked about the pulpit we talked about complexes holding us back from doing things maybe that the Lord is calling us to do um and uh God doesn't consult you on your complexes he didn't consult shamgar before he said thou Mighty Men of Valor remember in scripture here's the guy hiding and scared to death from all them Philistines coming in and God says the angel shows up and says Thou Mighty Man of Valor I got a word for you here and he's like can you kind of keep it down a little bit don't tell anybody this but God doesn't consult your complexes before he calls you to do certain things so we can begin to set our complexes aside and we can even set aside some of the false humility that we might have Upon Our Lives where we say well I don't want people to think I think anything great of myself so I'll just kind of stay humble and stay God opens God opens doors by giving you a gift that makes a way for itself scripture says your gift will make a way for itself so if you sit back trust God and just begin to move forward and love him and do what the sign says behind me continuously looking for Revelation in your life those doors are naturally going to go if you submit your gift to the Lord he's going to be able to use that so there's two sides of this complex is some one thing that'll hold us back the other side or this is a quote that we had how can I do this for the Lord or the blank for the kingdom if I can't even do this so we'll put some we'll fill the blanks in here this is one of those situations where it's a catalyst anything you put in those anything you put in those blanks is wrong anything you put in there it wouldn't matter what the because of this I can't do this how can I do this for the Lord if I do this Lord he may call you to do something completely out of your comfort zone and completely out of your skill set he asked Moses to go do things and Moses probably thought in his own mind well I've got all of this training and I've got all of this ability and then he puts them on the back side of the desert and erases all of that from him and brings him back a stuttering person to release to get his people free so with this in mind these blanks that you put in this is our complex is talking this is our mentality talking his ways are higher than our ways he thinks higher I have a gift of blank even if you know what your gift is some of you we haven't realized what it is yet right but you say you have a gift or something but I used it out in the world I used it for other things that were wrong so I'm not going to do that mostly this is along the lines I talked about the musicians who had been out in the world playing music and singing and dancing and doing things out in the world and they don't want to make any connection to whatever that was out there because they associate everything that they were doing psychologically this happens to people they associate everything that they're doing all those connections have to do with a sinful life and the things that they want to try to forget and disappear and walk away from as part of repentance so uh they're afraid to bring those things in here but you understand God didn't give you that at Birth that gift for you to use it out there he gave it to use here so the fact that you used it out there can be repented of and left behind and you can bring that gift here and say Lord now I lay this before you I consecrate this gift unto you how can you use this for the kingdom and he will do that and then uh this was the uh the tale the story of the talents and what we to what degree you used the talents that God gives you I was talking a little bit about this is what your gift and reward will be back uh when you're when you're done using the gear so there's some connections there we don't really need to go into that too much I have a gift of it but I use it for the world okay that's the same thing the other the complexes isn't the one thing remember the second thing that we got to watch out for is apathy sometimes we're just under complex sometimes we're just under laziness it's just I'm just tired I work too much it's enough for me just to get my family in the house of God every week and that's about all I can do and trust me I sympathize it is a busy world and and we do that so hopefully by the time we get near the end of this here it's not going to feel like I'm overwhelming you or asking you to do greater things and I'm not here to do that what I'm here to do is to say there's some work to be done for you and God's the one that gets to place you in that place what I'm trying to get you to do is adjust your thinking so that you're ready to do it when he calls on you that's the only Point okay so we need to stop disqualifying ourselves and others based on our past present or future based on our family history based on our complexes and based on our apathy based on what happened last week God may call you to do something that is out of character for you or the people around you I'm in eternity let's keep moving here uh great quote by Raven Hill I love this quote opportunities of a lifetime must be seized within the lifetime of the opportunity essentially saying this from a standpoint of when God calls on your heart God will call on your heart for a certain thing those calls will eventually get quieter and quieter and quieter if you don't respond just the truth there's opportunities that come your way there's callings that come your way and if you don't move on those callings if you decide to do something else God will say like he did with Balaam okay go ahead and these people are asking you you remember the story of Balaam where the people came and asked them to go and curse these people and here's a prophet of God saying I can't curse those are God's people I can't go down there and curse God's people and they said yeah but we're going to give you a lot of money and a lot of houses and a lot of stuff uh let me ask the Lord right and he goes back and asks the Lord and God says absolutely not what are you thinking no those are my people I'm paraphrasing God didn't say it just that way but uh then Balaam says guys I can't go I can't do it and uh have a nice day and they said yeah but wait a minute here's some more princes that we have here's some more money here's some more houses here's all of this stuff and he goes let me go ask the Lord again God's word on the subject was already spoken those are my people you're not going to go and curse those people and balaam's going hey maybe a 10 curse maybe I can go up and just give a little tiny curse and then all of this this is great I could have an in-ground swimming pool it'd be a great witnessing tool and uh you know he's trying to reason with God this is there any way possible that this thing can happen and uh God finally goes okay go ahead so did God change his mind okay this is the point that I'm making here is that there's opportunities that will come and we'll go and there's a lifetime of that opportunity that exists within the perfect will of God and we want to be as much as we possibly can right in the perfect will of God we don't want to have to make him wait we want to be ready so a lot of it requires for us to prepare our thinking and to be ready when the Call Comes okay so what do we do as Christians and then we talked about the the seven things and I'm going to roll right through these because I got a list of them coming up then this is where that the entire scripture we read the entire scripture this is where it talks about the gifts within this the the spiritual gifts within the church it also talks about let there be no Schism or no division between the Brethren uh this also talks specifically about there being one one spirit and we are all subject under that Spirit we all work by that same individual spirit and that's how there can be such sweet harmony in what we do there can be a lot of moving parts to something but we're all moving towards one goal and I've got a great example of that in our kids days program that I noticed this year we went to we have a vacation bible school that we host at our church and when we were a little church we had almost 100 people that they weren't all wouldn't always come all at the same time so we had enough room in our little church and I it's great to see almost all the seats full today you guys are growing and doing I mean just moving in the right direction here this is really exciting and uh and just make room because as people come they're going to feel the spirit of the lord they're gonna feel that warmth and want to come and visit anyway the the uh at the kids days program the we used to do this and we try to do it as big as we possibly can you know for the kids and we try to bring horses out so they could do horseback riding and we did these big presentations where we'd find a bunch of spotlights and Flash them around and try to make as exciting as we could these dramas and things like that where we would dramatize a great message and the only the only message we ever had the entire vision of the thing that my sister began sister Sharon the only Vision that she had is this one statement we just want to bring the little kids in and we want to teach them that God is good and the Devil is bad and if we can get that anchored in their head as a big Stone anchored in their minds and anchored in their hearts if we can do that then everything else in life can fall on that thought and they can come back to that point and just so they understand that God is good the Devil is bad and so it's a really simple message that we have so for all these years 25 years we've been doing this this year uh and we've just been blessed because we we got the new building and when I walked through the building with my dad before he passed away he was looking around and he had more Vision than the rest of us he said we got to get this building and everything and it's just we were looking around like we will never I thought we'd rope off the back side of that building and not use it for years and I'm telling you now that I was telling you before as well by the grace of God people are coming and not just people moving from church to church uh to you know Christians from here and there but P brand new people are coming in and there's tattoos all over them and they're I mean they're coming straight out of the world with all these things and they're just being bathed in the refreshing word of God and there's great things happening now they're bringing their children to these events and everything and but it's just a great time I walked around at that kids days program and I couldn't believe how we have a chat thing that we use on Telegram and all the different departments have their rooms that they're that they're doing things in and I stay completely in what Anne does with the audio video things and so that's my little world and the music and everything I had no idea the second day of the event I go walking outside and we're spread there's horses in a petting zoo in a village they built in a village outside and all of these people working in Harmony and we have testimonies coming back that they're like everybody was on the same page everybody was in harmony I had no clue what the other people in the church were doing that we had you know 300 kids and parents and everything there but it was just in in Harmony and that's a testament to there being one spirit and if we're all using our gifts in our way and we're just churning away working at it we can look around and realize that God is being uh glorified and lifted up in what we do so just a little testimony and I I think he can do that anywhere he can do that here as well because it's the same Spirit we got down in Ottawa down there Ottawa Lake it's not there anywhere Petersburg Michigan is the Same Spirit we can all rally around here amen okay so that's the description we go through it there this is a great quote that I ended on last time so let's whatever we have let's use it for the kingdom of God's sake every Talent we have let's put it in the kingdom of God and uh that's just I love that quote just take those talents and just put them in the kingdom of God let's use them for that okay so this is where we're going to pick up today these are the seven things that I I I kind of got through and I picked out seven things last time here so here they are and I'm working on your mind here okay I'm working on a way of thinking that's different than what the world the natural thing number one preparing yourself you're saved to serve getting that mentality and locking that in there you want to begin to prepare your mind to be used of the Lord so the farmer prepares the field for rain putting the seed in there and he preps for it so preparing yourself getting ready reading your Bible and praying and being ready getting organized writing the vision down writing down your resources how can we move forward what what are we going to do together what do we want to accomplish there's all kinds of things that you can accomplish there's a group of people within the church with brother Paul that wanted to give a Christmas bonus to several uh the evangelists that travel around the country as evangelists and so we wanted to do something special by giving them a Christmas bonus one year and I think they've continued doing that actually and it's just something special that they wanted to do so throughout the year they'll do things and raise funds and everything like that so that they can give a Christmas bonus to those I mean ministers don't usually get Christmas bonuses but there you go it's something that that they wanted to do and it may seem like a really small thing to the people around you and you might get criticism for it but whatever those things are to do working in tune with the other body the members of the body around you that's great and with your pastor uh get tuned up if you need to learn something if you need to research something study that's always very good to do to prepare yourself to do the best job you can for the Lord all this can happen before you even know what he wants you to do right all of this can be you preparing so that when the Call Comes you're ready uh this number four is kind of my thing that I threw in I would have people probably argue with me on this point begin before you're completely ready I would not wait until everything is perfect to begin because if you wait for Perfection and everything to line up you may be waiting a long time now there is God's time for things so when he puts his Blessing on something it tends to move a little quicker than it would just with us standing behind it pushing it but there's nothing wrong with us if it's a noble thing and if it lines up with some of the things we're going to talk about here in just a little bit go ahead and get behind and begin to prep and begin to try this stuff out and learn some trial and error and things like that pray that the Lord will put his Blessing on it and when he does bring that there you're already in motion and going in that direction and if the Lord shows you that maybe that wasn't it he'll have your retool or he'll have it laid on his heart that's this isn't the thing great do what the prophet said pull that old Shell out of the gun put another one in Ram it in there and let's pull the trigger and see what happens next don't ever get discouraged let's just keep moving forward okay number five share and expand this is a way for you to begin to you should talk a lot about this because you learn a lot about your own Vision by bouncing it off people and getting their response from it and don't get discouraged if they look at you and they just don't see it don't do that I had a very prominent missionary brother brother I have hold in high regard and I told him when we started our foundation years ago we started the LaFontaine foundation and the idea was we were a family of musicians so we wanted to help musicians around the world so one of the things we did was we were putting sound systems and instruments together to send to the Philippines to to give churches a new sound system or or new instruments or whatever so when we would travel over there we would go over and do some concerts and gain you know get people to come together and then we'd find out what the needs were the churches and we'd go and get a truckload of instruments from somewhere in Manila and then we'd go and deliveries to the churches or have them meet us and pick them up so we thought it was great the greatest thing in the world is just really excellent I mentioned it to this brother and he goes I kind of feel like that's a waste of time I don't know that you guys should be doing that it takes up resources and and these other things and I just was like I thought boy that takes the wind out of my sails but then we were doing a good work and we were doing what God laid on our hearts and I I'm not a I'm would not be a good missionary probably because I you know Motel 6 is about as rough as I get uh if I've got a you know so the mission field would be a little scary for me so anyway the with all of that said uh don't be discouraged I mean Take Good Counsel and sometimes it's going to be positive sometimes it's going to be negative if you do anything for the Lord matter of fact if you do anything at all start a business or anything there are going to be people that are going to criticize you and it's not necessarily that you have to grow thick skin in fact I recommend that you don't grow thick skin because thick skin tends to inoculate you from being open enough to the body of Christ to be able to to to communicate and to confess your faults one to another and to open yourself up to be able to be a part of the body who can get close to other people if you develop thick skin from hurts and pains that you've had before then what happens is you built that wall and you never really allow yourself to be um what's that word I'm looking for the right word uh it's just you don't let yourself be soft and vulnerable that's what it is vulnerable enough to be to somebody who can love one another like that so anyway uh we'll move forward uh learn to encourage others become a compliment artist because you'll find out that you want to have that reciprocated this is talk about the vision first ask questions about things and then learn to encourage others uh mirror the support that you like to desire to have back okay that Matthew 7 12 is the scripture has to do with you we've all heard it's the Golden Rule do unto others as as you would have them do unto you so treat people the way you'd like to be treated then number seven is to meet the need of someone else if you're moving along you're churning and everything and things are a little stagnant so what helps a little bit to grease the skids and to get things going a little bit is look around at someone else that needs help and jump in with their Vision it'll keep you exercised and keep you going in the right direction I think and you'll find that eventually your mission starts to move forward as well from doing that okay so Ministry of helps part two that was the that was the review are you ready to go all right good Proverbs 23 7 as he thinks in his heart so is he as a man thinketh in his heart we've heard of this before this is a tremendous scripture it's small but it is huge as he thinks in his heart so is he so whatever you think in your heart so is he is that what scripture's saying how far can we take this honestly because how you think is determined how far you go in the Lord how far you'll go with your mission how far you go with your vision how far you go with your family how far you go with your business there's no qualifications put on this that I can see as he thinks in his heart so is he so our thoughts are going to be extremely important Philippians 4 8 says finally my brethren whatever things are true whatever things are noble whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are of good report if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy meditate on these things so it's asking you to find the stuff that is pure to extrapolate from Life pull out of life the things that are lovely and the things that are good report and is this completely opposite to the culture or what our social media culture has us constantly looking for something negative that we can find and we can post how upset we are about it and then once we post it we get all these other posts of people that say wow you're right or no you're wrong and I can't and they're ready to fight over these things constantly and so I'm going to mute this here real quick because I'm I'm getting all of the the messages from our church up there that's just begun my my tech Cruise has a text message here anyway so sorry about that um but meditating on the things of God this is so important and finding the things that are positive it's asking us to do that this is a this is an uphill battle I think we can do it let's train our minds to look for the things that are praiseworthy and the things that are virtuous Romans 12 2. do not be con uh conformed to the world but be transformed how by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God we want the perfect will of God and the way that you prove that the way you find that perfect will of God as you begin have to use your mind to put to renewing by the mind so what it's saying here is you can re you can be transformed even your transformation as a believer has to do with is it the renewing of your spiritual walk is it the renewing of if I just get a new Bible or if I would read enough quotes or if I listen to enough tapes or do missionary work or you know there's a lot of things that we can put in here and it's asking us to renew be transformed by the renewing of our mind refreshing the way we think about things and looking and proving in our minds what is good and acceptable and that's the perfect will of God that will find the perfect will of God but it has to do with us changing and renewing our minds so our minds are very important how we think about things is very important Colossians 3 2 set your mind on things above not on things of Earth there's tons of scriptures like this second Corinthians 10 5 casting down arguments and every okay now this one is this is fighting language here right so it's giving you some good advice but this one has got some pretty militant Works behind us you're going to go out and you're going to grab this thing and you're going to cast it down this argument you're going to take the high places that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and you're going to take this thing and you're going to bring it into captivity you're going to tie it up and you're gonna drag it and you're going to make it captive to The Obedience of Christ so this is telling us that there's probably going to be a struggle involved with training this thing to to find The Obedience of Christ so this is some pretty strong language and I think if we can if we can you know Buck ourselves up a little bit and get ready for a fight when it comes to our mind our mind is just naturally not going to let us it's the flesh right so we're going to fight against this thing a little bit so let's be ready for the fight that's not I think this is going to be an easy thing okay this is a great quote remember the brand I'm here it says uh and may I stop here just a moment to say this this is a huge statement he's about to make and I'll go on record because the recorders are going them tapes are rolling back there that any Divine promise in God's word if you take the right mental attitude towards any how many any of God's Divine promises will bring it to pass regardless of what it is if God promises it and you show the right mental attitude God will fulfill his promise to you listen to this statement right here that promise is good to a few people that promise is good to people who have the Holy Spirit that promise is good to people who don't have a problem with alcoholism right This Promise is good to anyone who will look at it in that respect this this can save the whole city this can save everybody you should be talking to anybody you come in contact with about this right here you realize that the book that we call the Bible is full of divine Promises of God and you can have access to every one of them for no other reason but having one an attitude the right attitude about it and you have to change nothing you have to give up nothing for that it's tremendous you'll turn all those promises on for that right there alone now that I believe that once that begins to happen in your life and their lives that they'll turn to Christ for that and the the other things will come along sometimes we think we've got to get them in the water first and get them baptized get them down to the altar do all of these things and and and these things but right here it's talking about having the correct mental attitude first this has to be conquered before we can do all of the other things so let's not get the cart before the horse here let's make sure that we're getting things right first becomes first comes the relationship with the Lord and the right mental attitude towards it love that quote are you ready to think like a Christian in the ministry of helps you ready all right so we're going to go forward a little bit this is going to be much shorter than the last time guys I I was so happy to get to this point before but uh I don't think it'll take nearly as long as I did last time and I don't I don't mean to do that but I felt like I went long before so here we go in uh in thinking with the ministry of helps in mind okay the five purposes of the New Testament Church and this is stuff that I just pulled out from looking at scriptures I grabbed five things that are the purpose sort of the purpose of what a church does and what a church is and the reason I grabbed this is because as we begin to conduct our minds into what are we going to do for the Lord what what's the best thing to do I felt like we should probably put some boundaries on what we can start to look at so we begin to define the battlefield a little bit here right so we're going to figure out what is the church supposed to do number one what does the scripture say the New Testament Church does and what's its purpose and what is it into and that way when we begin to brainstorm we're beginning to get ideas of what we can do for the Lord that we start to see that okay does this align with what the Bible says that a church does or the body of Believers does so that's why that's the reason for this so I've got five different ones I'm sure there's more purposes Matthew 28 19 uh 20. through 20 says go ye this is the Great Commission right we're we're used to this the Great Commission is if you're a Believer and you've given your heart to the Lord You're this is your commission this is you go ye into all the world teach all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all the things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even to the ends of the world Amen so he's with you on this Quest all the way along we're going to fulfill the Great Commission so as we're thinking of things that we can do for the Lord we're thinking in terms of this is going to help frame up what we're doing if what you're coming up with in your Concepts and what your pastor is working with in the group starts to work together somehow helps with this or fits in line with the Great Commission you're right where you need to be amen it's exactly where you want to be right uh the second purpose is to worship God this is not a private worship only this is Daniel opening the drapes getting on his knees and praying when the government said not to okay this is a public display I love one of my favorite books to read and I still go back to it a lot is the Haley's Bible Handbook and I don't know if you've ever seen him before but there's a lot of historical pictures he has the scriptures and the references and then next to it he has all of the archaeological information of all the findings and everything like that through the history of everything it's one of my favorite books because I love history like that so uh in Haley's Bible Handbook there's quotes and everything like that and he talks about in the beginning of it in the forward he talks about some of the things we do as Christians then he said one of the things you do as an act of worship is you go to church you do it publicly so your neighbors and everybody else can see that I may not agree with every single thing that that Pastor is going to say there but I'm gonna I'm gonna show my colors I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna go to church because that's what a Christian does as he goes to church uh and and I agree that sometimes it's nice to have those resources to go to church online sometimes but that is a that is a really cheap replacement for being here rubbing shoulders with the body of Christ very cheap replacement if you have to do it I understand but if you can get somewhere where the body of Christ is you need to be there with them first Peter this is uh but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a royal priesthood a holy nation I love this one A peculiar people will identify with that that you should show forth show forth so people can see it show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light so as you're developing these plans to do something for the Lord you're in context here looking it does this show forth the Praises right of him that has shown me from Darkness Into The Marvelous Light is am I showing him and what I'm doing can they see me when they're looking at me are they looking at you the Lord that's what we want to know uh and then John 4 this is uh but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him there's another uh point at another scripture in Romans that talks about I got behind over here guys not supposed to let me get behind moving on to uh in Romans 8 it talks about uh how all of creation is groaning everything in the entire world there's this groaning happening and it says here that the father is seeking he's looking he's looking where's this manifestation of the true worshipers it's it's it's got to come sometime and I'm hoping that that I don't pass on in this life without seeing the manifestation of these true worshipers I believe that I'll get a chance we'll get a chance to see him right here in this generation I really believe that this scripture if you don't know what's happening here this is when Jesus walks up to the well and the woman at the well is there and he's talking to her and he says go get your husband he asked for a drink she says you're not supposed to be talking to me you're a Jew and I'm Samarian and he says go get your husband she says no I don't have one of them and he says you're right you don't but you've had five of them right this all this discussion is happening here and she goes I think you're a prophet you're you're seeing things that only a prophet would see and then she talks about her people the Sumerians worshiping way back in the day in the mountains primitive worship up in the mountains and they were saying back then that they had the truth up in the mountains and she says now you Jews are saying you got to go down to to uh worship down in Jerusalem and uh but what is the truth here and he says yeah you're right you Worship in the mountains and we're the Jews were the people of God and we're down in Jerusalem and worshiping and he says but I tell you and this is where he picks it up that there's coming a day there's coming a time and like Romans says all creation and the father is seeking this moment when the true worshipers and they're going to worship in spirit and in truth and it's just a this a huge scripture because it's saying someday there's coming people that are going to get it right for all of church history we've had to have little course Corrections and we've had to have Messengers come on the scene and help us to get corrected back and and Luther come and he'll nail that thing up there because the church got off course and it helps to course correct a little bit some people just go off and continue in the in the Folly that it was in the organized church but there's a little course correction God in his grace Jehovah God and his love for us continues to send a man with a course correction so that we can stay on and he did it for us in the last day and guess what there's no more of them coming so we've got to grasp on to what he said and we've got a course correct we've got to stick to it yes and stay right with it and we got to realize that sometimes we got off track a little bit and sometimes people that came out of those denominations when brother Branham came and preached come out of her my people they came out of there but they drug along with them a lot of their Pentecostal and Methodist ideas and they brought him right in here with us and it's time for us in the last day respectfully I see this to begin to shed some of those denominational ideas that have been keeping us from this manifestation of the sons of God it's time for this manifestation of the sons of God the Father seeketh all right number three we should Fellowship in all of the these couple scriptures you can write those down I'm going to move along through this a little bit Acts 2 as the church was being established there and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in the breaking of bread and in prayers they continue to be together this scripture here is well known to us and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works love it I love it I'm going to poke you a little bit I'm going to make it a little bit uncomfortable for you until you love me and we're going to provoke you to good word that's what I'm here doing today I'm provoking you to find some good works and do them with one another amen uh so not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching is the day approaching let's get together then amen let's strengthen one another uh the this is the fourth purpose so going back to that for just for a second if if you're if what you're going to do for the Lord and what you're going to do for the body of Christ is in tune with getting together and fellowshipping like that it's a it's usually an indication that it's going to be edifying to the body of Christ so that's a good thing and all of this is subject to you praying about it the spirit of God moving on your heart and again like I said if you're trying something that's not quite working or you talk to the pastor about it and the pastor goes well let's let's see if we can retool it this way or maybe wait on that let's pray about that or something like that in tune with the leadership of the body and in tune with what the leadership of the spirit of God is if you're putting those things in place this is good indication that you're on the right track if you can align it with these some of these Scriptures it helps a lot so uh our purpose also as a body of Christ is to minister to provide Minister another word for minister or Ministry is to be a an assistant to be a help okay one of the one of the definitions of minister is servant to administer okay so uh in the uh Ephesians 4 here and he gave some Apostles where we were okay he gave some this is another one of the uh references to what he gives to the church Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of this why did he give it why do you give all those people for the perfecting of the Saints wait a minute you guys can't be perfect can you the perfecting of the Saints is this true it says right here I don't know our our goal is perfection right when we step from this body to the other body that Perfection is coming so let's start getting ready for it amen uh for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body of Christ make sure that what you're doing is aligned with edifying the body of Christ very important fifth one is to love really really important here's the Capstone okay John 13. I better read this over here a new commandment I give you that ye love one another as I have loved you uh that you also love one another that as I've loved you that you also love one another by this you shall know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another this is how people know that you're a disciple of Christ they can sense and they can see on display not privately not quietly but right out there on display amen you can see that you love one another uh incidentally if they can see openly that you love one another then if you don't they can see openly that you don't conversely right so if they sense that if people sense that then they're going to find fault in that and if they're going to criticize that in you okay so we show love to one another not because we're trying to run away from showing hate towards one another but because it's the right thing to do we want love in our hearts and we want love for everybody in our hearts I asked my mom what time what's the most important thing for a Believer and she said the most important thing what we're supposed to do as Christians is to love everybody we're just supposed to love everybody and uh so here we go let's go to the next one First Corinthians 13. uh though I speak with the tongue of men and of angels and have not charity love I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol I know a little something about tinkling symbols I'm a drummer so and I play trumpet in junior high and it's as bad as you think it it was it's terrible uh and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all the Mysteries and all the knowledge if I've got it all and though I have all the faith so that I could remove mountains and I have not charity I am I'm okay I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor I'm a rich guy and I'm given to all kinds of people I gave more in the plate Brother John I'm the one that helped build this church with my funds and give my body to be burned I am sacrificial if I have not charity it profit me nothing some tough statements there so we want the love of God and all that we do your motivation for everything moving forward inside the body of Christ should be I want to express love in some way to somebody amen okay that was a slide that I was going to do some some other things that would have taken us too long so that Fortress of you maybe we'll do that another time uh okay this is a great quote from brother Brandon said we know that in the drama they change masks they come from one thing to another and that's what you did he start he's praying in this situation he's talking to the Lord that's what you did you came from the spirit of God the great Jehovah and you put on a mask of a human being this is a great quote because it starts to lead I didn't put the whole quote here because I just wanted to talk about this part there are some times where you're going to play a role in this drama and it may or may not be a comfortable role for you to play at the time but if it's fulfilling a need for the body of Christ then play that role to the best of your ability until God plugs somebody into that role because sometimes he's going to call on you to do something else you all have heard of ministers that have well here's a situation with me I'm not even a minister I'm I'm a uh I'm a sound guy I work in the ministry of helps within the body of Christ this is what I do and I love I serve the Lord with all my heart I try to learn everything that I possibly can I go to classes and I do whatever I can to make sure that I'm doing the best job I know how to do in that capacity for the body of Christ but there's sometimes that God will use you to do something that's really out of the ordinary for you like this like I'm standing here talking to you so uh you'll you've all heard ministers that are evangelists sometimes and I've heard my dad who's a great evangelist Minister and then sometimes he would step into the role of a pastor and he would or a teacher and he would teach something and for that moment there he was being used he was wearing a different mask so to speak and God was using him in a different way so don't be afraid to play a role if you need to play a role for something the the Disney company has something that they do with uh and I'm not getting political here that's I know they're going there's a lot of things going on with the Disney Corporation so I'm just uh making a point here that their their employees that work at all the Disney World places in Disneyland they don't call them employees they call them cast members so the the point that they make is when you come to work and you put on the customer you put on your uniform when you step into public out from behind whatever or up the stairs from whatever tunnel or whatever you come out of but when you step into public you're playing a role for the happiest place on earth now I I think about that sometimes and I'm walking down Main Street USA maybe at Disney World I'm looking around at these people and they're just every one of them are bubbly and they're happy and they're giving it balloons and Candy to my kids and I'm looking and doing are they really in this good mood I mean they gotta be having some rough days Sometimes some people just got divorced or some people just went through a terrible breakup or some people just went through a terrible thing with their family or I just lost my dad or I just lost my mom I I wrecked my car I had two flat tires on the way to work but you don't get to bring any of that on stage you're a cast member so you can leave all of that backstage and when you step forth in public you are ex you're you are the example you're living an example and I want you guys to know that too that the world is watching you they are watching you and you have you don't need mine but you have my permission and you have permission from the Lord to drop all of that stuff off we leave all that at the Lord At His Feet and say I do not have I don't have you don't have the capacity to carry the burden as it is so trying to pick up all of this stuff and carry forward you by now you should know that that's probably not the best thing to do leave those things behind put on the whole armor of God he put the mask on you fit it on you and that way you can go forth and what people see is wow how come you're so strong it's not you being strong it's that God gave me a mask to wear here and he gives me the permission to leave all of my stuff backstage I never have to bring it on stage with me you never have to see you never have to see the weakness now I can say brother I really need prayer I have this weakness can you pray with me absolutely with the other actors you get backstage and you pray about things and you work in the backyard on things and maybe even you argue a little bit in the backyard or you got in front of me there you upstaged me a little bit maybe you shouldn't do this or that and you may have to work a bunch of stuff out with the director but when you step on stage you're playing a role for the for the world and for the Lord to see how faithful you are in whatever role that he has so anyway we'll keep moving forward here okay uh yeah here's another one so this is a little bit further down in the same quote actually speaking like this father we know that we uh and he's I think you're still praying you guys uh father I don't remember to replace it yeah father we know that this tape goes all over the world uh and here is fine little group sitting here today this visible audience here in Phoenix Arizona or Phoenix oh God 15 years of hard preaching and scolding and God thou knowest the reason the reason is love all of this work and everything I do and that he's giving the Capstone here in Shalom he's telling all of that work basically comes down to love here's another one it's a symphony see you'll find it comes to a junction everybody is all wondering I call it a junction I don't know music a musician is here why he would uh forgive me and I'm a musician I forgive you brother Brandon uh of my rude way but it's we're beating out got to have something to act I'll it'll go real low way down you wonder what it is see if you can get into the rhythm of it you understand it that's the only way you'll ever understand God is get into the rhythm of it as a Christian drummer I really love that quote um and I will say this that what he's talking about here I'll go ahead and expound a little bit as a musician not to add to what he's saying or anything like that but what he's talking about is the way that the music ebb and flows okay music is a series of tension and release all music is so you're creating a moment of a crescendo where you take the emotion of the people and you bring them high to a certain point and then there's a release of that Crescendo it's called a decrescendo where you come back down from that so music flows and you this emotional up and down and this is what he's describing if you stay locked into the rhythm of it watch the conductor stay right in it because he's going to take you up high he's going to take you really low where you barely can hear and there's one little violin that's just scratching across those strings real slow like that and Boeing really and then it'll take you up to where it's just almost too loud for you to even handle just the motion okay so God's gonna allow these things to happen he's going to play your life like this and you've got to follow and stay right in line and the great thing about it is is as a conductor oh this is the quote uh it's a symphony is this where yes it's a symphony see you'll find it comes to a junction and everybody oh this is the quote we just did yeah so it's a it's a symphony and if I show you this picture here of a conductor in front of the symphony orchestra the spirit of God is our conductor and I don't know if you've ever watched a symphony before but when a conductor is standing and he's looking at the musicians of everybody out there and he's got Violence Section one Violence Section two and the violas and the cellos and then the bases go around behind and the trumpets are back there French horns are way over on this side back there tubas and everything from back in there all the percussionists are way back over there there's a harp that sits over here and when you look at an orchestra they usually sit all of those places and that conductor will move his arms and everybody has music to watch they're watching the music but in their peripheral vision up here while they're watching the music they can see the conductor and the conductor's calling them to go louder with more demonstrate movement and softer with less movement and dynamics of playing it so they're playing the notes on the page out of your scripture you've got all the the word the notes on the page but the letter of the law is harshness if you just sit and look at the music and play it but where you get it is the movement of the Spirit by watching the conductor and if he's giving you that direction that's there you're sure you're paying you're playing the same notes that everybody else that ever took a lesson could play on the Note but it's not that it's how you're playing it and all of that emotion comes from our conductor which is the spirit of God each one of you watching the conductor in his movement in motion and what you'll find out is over time what I've found out is that when God's moving in a certain way I can begin to react to it like Lord in within the body of Christ and I'll start to make adjustments even to my staff or to people that are that I'm working with in in the body of Christ and say maybe we should do this a little bit and I think maybe we should move this camera over here because it and I'll start to make motions in that direction and you watch as something else is happening over in the church and because I move that technical camera over in that direction something happened in the church there and motion went that direction we didn't talk about that we didn't plan on it at all but it was God saying I want this to happen this way and he's moving that direction now that's a very maybe in your eyes a poor example or a simple example but this is the world I live and I say thank you Lord that he cares enough about where I face the lens on a camera or or how someone is used in that way this is us watching the conductor and being ready to go and the ups and downs emotion of it is so very very important I want to demonstrate something can I go over here to the piano real quick all right I'm going to demonstrate something you guys can sing along with me if you want all right hello hello all right so then sings my soul my savior God sing along [Music] How Great Thou Art [Music] real big then sings my soul my savior God to thee How Great Thou Art how great thou all right good job I stopped playing when at the worst moment [Music] this cord right here is the tension it's the big it's the highest moment in the song How Great Thou if I stopped right there everybody go brother I what are you doing you're leaving us on the Cliffhanger right crying out for resolve [Music] they call that the root note it takes you back to the root of the song so there's times when there's going to be tension and there's going to be moments where you're working towards something and it's going to call for some resolve to come back to some calmness God will always allow the music to come back to calmness so with Grace we go through the moments of tension we allow him to take us through the moments of attention because we have faith that he'll always bring us back to our root amen amen amen y'all sing a special this morning good job okay so final thoughts we all grow through different stages of our development spiritually and naturally this is natural typing the spiritual so to speak we're all babies and toddlers at some point in our lives for some of you for some of you it was a really long time ago I'm just kidding so there's one of my favorite books is this is back when I was in the business days uh there's a book that's called uh and he's a Christian man um The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and one of the things he talks about in there is the maturity continuum and how we mature through life then he put he puts it in Stephen Covey he's the guy who wrote the book he puts it in three stages that I really love and I use this in my other training with the musicians and everything too these first couple stages that you see up there the babe and the toddler and maybe the first three stages is a state of dependence absolute dependence if you walk away from a baby when it's a baby and it's completely dependent on you for its substance it's life if you walked away from it it would perish it wouldn't be able to live a toddler probably the same thing the little kid there I think if you just dropped him off the side of the road and drove away he'd probably go knock on a door somewhere and he'd find a way to feed himself and and so forth Maybe but then you get to that stage in the middle there and you've entered into a new stage because you you start feeling good you get your first job and you get some experience under your belt and you're kind of going along and it's like wow I I can pay my own bills and this is where you usually see kids moving out from their parents house and a lot of times they're there's some tension there with that happening because not only the parent is having to get used to the idea that this kid is thinking on his own and he's not always thinking good thoughts he's not always doing the right thing but and you're watching this happen but you also watch the kid is also saying I have to do my own thing I have to break away from how my mom and dad did things and I have to begin to create my own life so there's this part of life that's called Independence it's absolutely necessary to get to the stage of Independence because if you didn't you would just stay dependent on your family all them years and we have some of those people some examples of those guys they're 40 years old and they're still living in their parents basement playing video games or whatever else nobody likes to deal with people like that we realized that they got they got stuck in a dependent stage and they didn't grow so it's not pretty when someone doesn't mature right so this person in the in in this middle stage the middle guys there they go through a stage there of Independence where they're making their own money they're buying their own cars in their own houses and they're making their bills all by themselves if they stay in the independent stage into the older years they tend to cause problems with relationships they they tend to hurt people's feelings a lot of times you find guys that end up getting divorced in these stages girls and guys because they stayed in an independent stage I'm My Own man I do things the way I do things nobody's going to tell me what to do nobody wants to mess with me because I've learned my way and a lot of times through hurts and pains and suffering that they've gone through they've let it give them thick skin and they've let it build up walls to where that this person hurt me this pastor hurt me this person hurt me I'll never let anybody have that place in my life again and they'll build a wall up and they'll say I'm going to be protected from this I'm My Own man nobody tells me what to do and they stay right there in their independent stage a lot of times these are the guys that are talking about the good old days they're 54 years old and they're still talking about the catch that they made in high school on the football team and they're bragging about man I was the best I still hold the state record for whatever you know and uh they're stuck right they're stuck in that stage because that was the moment that was their moment and nothing exciting has happened since then I want to ask them what what did you do last week you know did this anything has anything happened between them but they get stuck and they're latched on to that independent stage because they don't want anybody to hurt them and they don't want anybody to take over but the real mature person will grow beyond that independent stage into something called interdependence or interdependence and uh it looks like this you grow from dependence where you say you you do it for me to Independence where I do it and then you grow to an interdependent stage where you say we will do this together and so when we're talking about the ministry of helps and I promise that's all the business psychology that I'll talk about but when we talk about the Ministry of Health we talk about spiritual growth into maturity it's the same situation here where we grow from we're just a baby in Christ and we're dependent upon I need to talk to people I need the pastor to pray for me I need this and I need this in a very needed time and a dynamic and functional Body of Christ will minister to all three of these stages there'll be people that are babies in Christ at the same sitting in the same Pew sitting down the road from you will be somebody who's in the independent stage I realize now I can read the Bible God can give me Revelation on things I feel really good about this but they didn't grow they maybe don't stop or they do stop before they get to the interdependent stage which means we are a body with an understanding this may be the biggest understanding that you have to have your actions and your thoughts will affect everybody in this room you are not independent you're not no matter what you want if you want to act independent if you want to say nobody else I'm not letting anybody into my little bubble you can say that all you want to but you will not mature in Christ or in natural things until you get to the place where you realize I am part of a body of Believers I am part of a community I am part of a country I'm part of a family and when those things that's why I love that you guys have the name the word family and the title of the church because family is something that uh you know you may hate each other from time to time it's like all right this drive me crazy but it's family and it's like this we're gonna stick together no matter what if somebody gives us trouble we might fight in the backyard but when we come out we're we're united front we're together so the maturity the the higher level of maturity is get to the point where you start to realize that every action whether you hear or not whether you're at work or not wherever you are in your private life and in your public life everything that you do will affect this body spiritually because you are connected to the body of Christ very very important lesson we are together when things go well or when things go wrong we're together criticism damages the whole body when one hurts or when one is in glory or when one is having great times we all have great times we Rejoice with one another and when somebody's had going through a hard time we put ourselves right there in that magazine we go with them right criticizing damages the entire body and sometimes we frame up criticism in well I'm just trying to correct a problem in the body I'm just trying to correct a problem that I see in that person's life Okay so I've I don't know that I've read every word in the Bible I probably have once or twice I look everywhere and I really don't see that unless God lays something on your heart that there's some kind of Correction if somebody's not looking for asking for your opinion then you you if you're going to go to them with correction it better be drenched in love it better be drenched in purpose hey I saw you doing this and listen uh I went through this and I just I love you and I you know I wouldn't want you to be hurt and I realize that you're not me you know what I mean it's just making sure it's done the right way because if you're going in any way and you're you're touching someone who's an open or a raw nerve at a moment at a certain time then you're you're walking on thin ice for two reasons number one you could hurt the person themselves but God is dealing with that person actively moving that person along in the con in the maturity Continuum at some point and if You Hinder the work that God is doing because you feel like that you have the authority to go and make a correction I'm going to take a list of quotes over to this sister because I think she's doing this or I'm going to take this over to this brother because I'm going to correct that person if you've got to talk to the pastor about something like that maybe do that but we somehow have got it in our minds that there's a reward for finding fault right that's true there's no award show coming that's going to give you some statue because you figured out what was wrong in somebody else's life there's no reward for finding fault there's no reward for you correcting in fact there's no precedent for you as a body of Christ for you as a person in the body to feel like you need to take it upon yourself to go correct somebody else's life we love one another whatever stage we are we support one another if someone asked for help we're there if they don't ask for help and we think they need help we start on our knees for that person we pray for them and we stay there with them and we've had we're here for you what do you need what can we help with okay it's a completely different concept than what the world than than what denominationalism says where we're not going to have that in this church boy we're not going to have somebody representing that around here we're going to clean house my legalism so criticism damages the entire body criticism of the pastor criticism of pastor's wife criticism of anybody within the body damages legalism is self-righteousness what it is and it is poison to the entire body if we let it it will poison the entire body legalism is is you thinking that you're living on a little bit higher level than that person over there and you may be that might be the truth it's none of your business because God is moving that person too and you're moving the right direction so if you do feel like you're on a level then go to that person and say I love you I love you right where you're at and I pray that you love me back pray for me I'll be praying for you if you ever need anything let me know I'm happy to help you but for you to take the the legalist mentality would be like I've been where you're at buddy I've been there and I won and I've I'm I'm over it now or whatever and it's cut it's how you approach these things can be the difference of life and death you're because your existence and because your spiritual walk is so connected to the other believers if you were to go and do something that would harm that person it's like drinking poison yourself you're hurting yourself because that's a connected part of the body of Christ you wouldn't go and say oh man I've got a sliver in my finger I hate that give me a knife I'm going to cut this finger off you just wouldn't do it this is my body I'm not going to hurt myself because a sliver hurt me or because I'm hurting at that moment you just wouldn't do that you're not going to amputate right so why would we go to a member of the body of Christ and say listen you need to get this right in your life and I've been there and you you got to watch out for this and that because it's and it's just this harshness that comes from if there's a right way to do this interdependence is maturity that will keep you from saying many many things the right mental attitude will also do a couple of things having that maturity and that interdependence will will many many many times close your mouth it'll have you saying less than you've ever said I just this has been my experience and it's been my experience as I fellowship with other people that are growing to this maturity level you find yourself talking less and less and less and there are things that you have to be self-aware of my friends there are things you have to be self-aware because there are times when you're going through certain things you're having a certain time at work or something like that where you're going to give yourself license to be in a certain mood or to say certain things to people around you and you're going to feel like you give that license because I've been hurt in this situation there are women that are going to go through stages of life and menopause and things like that and you there's some irrational thought processes that happen in those times it's a very difficult time of life so during those times you have to Bridle your tongue you have to it's just a hard thing to do and guys go through it just as much as the girls do it's not a it's not a girl or a woman or a man thing necessarily bridling the tongue is the ultimate battle to be won is trying to keep those things from going on now there's tons of stimulus that's coming stimuli they call it or whatever but there's tons of things that are happening to you all the time and there's thoughts flying over your head like brother Brandon said you the the the fly over your head but you can't let him make a nest right so on any given day if you can imagine that the entire world is influencing me and buffering up against me constantly and then I take this information in I have a decision to make do I pass that information on to everybody down from me or do I make it stop right there just because something terrible is happening to you and just because something terrible is being told to you and you have information about something doesn't mean that you have to move it you can act let your mind act as a filter because like the scripture says think on things that are good think on things that are holy think I think so when it hits that filter and you're like as a believer in Christ I'm not going to let that pass on this is how this is how this is how you kill uh the the spirit of rumors it happened hey did you hear about this this is what I heard about really you heard about that oh walk away okay walk away uh because we're Rumor Mill is dependent on you passing the rumor on but if you filter it out and you stop the rumor right there it doesn't continue on you do you're not obligated to have a reaction to all of the action that's happening to you you're not obligated to pass any of that along you can filter it out and say whatever Things Are Holy whatever things are just whatever things are of good report I'm going to meditate on those things and when the bad report comes I'm going to flush it out and I'm going to continue to speak faith and love on this side so filter out those things interdependent and getting to a place of maturity so that your actions you know that they're going to affect the body of Christ will filter out a lot of those things from your conversation our primary function as a body of Christ is to love one another it's your primary function Above All Things your primary function as a body is to love one another very good the spirit of God is alive and well and can speak for himself some people don't like this but the when Jesus died on the cross three days later rose again so was he dead or alive at that point he was alive again he was no longer dead hasn't been dead since then and isn't dead now he walked out of there he went to the Mount Transfiguration and was taken into heaven dead or alive then in the book of Acts divided up his spirit and sent it on 120 Believers in the upper room dead or alive in Dead or Alive beings alive still alive still communicating still talking still delivering his love still delivering his word still alive but for some reason nowadays people have forgotten that he can speak for himself he can speak to you and he can put an influence in your life and he can do things he can he can put things together let's let God continue to be our our director let him direct trust that his spirit is going to lead you into all things amen love one another trust the spirit of God to be a leader for you uh we are together correction must be drenched in love and purpose it really should if you're going to make a correction I would talk to the pastor about it I would talk to some other people about it and then when you go tremendous amount of Love humility and and purpose listen I I man I love you and I see this thing and I just want to uh you know what what do you need from me how can I help you and is there anything I can do you know just drenched in love and purpose we are together now and for always sometimes we forget that we're not going to spend Sunday and Wednesdays with these people we're going to spend eternity together so preparing ourselves for that eternity together means we better get used to one another and used to the idea that boy there are some personalities that just don't match up there's there's a couple I'm not going to say their names but there's a couple guys in the church that we don't have a lot in common as much as we would try we don't have a lot in common so we sit in a room for a few minutes and we talk about the things that we have in common and then it's like well we just better talk about the Lord because there's nothing else we got right and uh so we're not going to be Bosom Buddies it's not that you're going to be like this is my best friend ever you may not have those type of people that are within the body right there by you you might have some of them who knows you might you might develop good relationships with them I don't think you should require that of every relationship that's in the body and you'll be fake about it but you certainly have common ground in the fact that you are the pot you are the body and I am part of the body and we want what's good for one another because when you're healthy I'm healthy and so I'm connected to it so you say this in your mind to and I say this to all of you as uh as part of the body of Christ with you I want you to know that I am committed to your success I'm committed to you being on the other side of Glory with me I'm committed to the work that you're going to do for the Lord you have my complete commitment in what you do for the Lord and your everyday walk and when you walk into work I'm I'm right there with you I'm committed to you I'm part of the body with you wherever you go you've got me with you I'm backing you up and you've got him with you everywhere you go you never have to go anywhere alone again ever you never have to go through a pain or a suffering without all by yourself my prayers my strength if you just let me know or let somebody in this body know we're right there we are together and if this if we can just get that mentality then the tasks whatever we choose to do and I I've tried my very best not to come here and articulate a bunch of ideas of things that you can do because if you get this right if you get the mentality right then God will lay on your heart whatever this vision is here and as that vision is articulated by the pastor and by the Holy Spirit as that vision is there if you have this right and you're together as a body of Believers the wheels start to move and it's really really exciting and really enjoyable so I really pray and and hope that that this is a help to you and I just pray that you guys will be just as dynamic as you possibly can here and I love you very much and brother John I'll just turn it back over to you God bless y'all I have enjoyed this [Applause] I absolutely love that that was so practical practical and one of the hardest things is learning to work together it is so easy to figure out what's right what's wrong who's right who's wrong but there is a lacking in that maturity of how to fix how to take what's wrong and in love take care of it to as our brother was speaking there in Galatians chapter six if you see a brother overtaken fall you which are spiritual go to him in the spirit of meekness he taken the right spirit with you because and the purpose the purpose is to restore sometimes we're just we're so bothered at what they did to us that we just want to crack that thing because I'm hurt and you bypass the way to help restore and so I believe we heard from the Lord without doubt without question I'm looking forward to part three so I hope he starts working on it and come back because we need this we need this and we we need to start implement it take take what you feel is lacking in your life and just start working on that part wherever you're at on on the thing because I like what our brother said if we just get the mentality right if we get the functioning right well then whatever God would ask us to do I mean it wouldn't be a surprise if to me what our brother said wouldn't be a surprise if God asked us to do something out of her wheelhouse something that we're not comfortable we're doing I just want God to have his way and most of the time God can't have his way because we're in the way we think it should be done like this or that's the pastor's job or or you know that wouldn't happen if they wouldn't have done that you know before you know it we got a bunch of but a group of people that don't know how to handle things and we don't want that this was to help us to function the way that we should and I believe that this this was from the Lord this was so practical and this was really what we needed and I I just pray that we all can have this yearning to have this kind of unity and love to work together in the kingdom of God and and not have so much of an independent Spirit about well we're going to do it my way and this is the way I see it we got too much of that we we're stuck in that middle Zone we get I love that word I wrote it down interdependence that's where the maturity is at I love it God bless you let's stay in together we're really really appreciated that message amen let's just bow on a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your precious word today Lord our our brother made mention that this is out of his wheelhouse to bring this word to us what an example for all of us to be able to be used in a way that we're not thinking and God we just want to thank you for the willingness that you put on brother Ike's heart to to come here and to help us without that willingness Lord we wouldn't have what we have today we wouldn't have been able to hear and Lord we just pray that you would bless him for being obedient Lord that you would reward him for giving to us give back double fold to him and I pray that this word that we received today Lord will become a real manifestation that we could see the fruit of it down the road Lord we all receive this engrafted word we receive it Lord we receive it into our hearts receive into our minds Lord we were walking away with the right mental attitude and Lord we just are trusting you that the Great uh or uh director of this Symphony would just bless this church with such Harmony that we could just sing a Melody Lord of of through action and our lives of of a perfect love one towards another to see Souls saved and working together and whatever you would have us to do as a as a body of Believers here granted Lord we commit ourselves into your hands and just ask you to direct us all now and we give you the glory and praise for it in Jesus wonderful name we pray amen amen amen let's sing uh when we all get to heaven when we all get to heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be amen [Music] sing his mercy and his grace in the Mansions bright and blessed [Applause] and we all get to heaven for the day of rejoicing there will be [Music] Jesus Christ [Music] will overspread the sky but when traveling Days Are Over got a shadow not a son when we all to heaven [Music] Jesus Will Sing and Shout the victory let us let us stay true and faithful trusting service [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the day of rejoicing there will be when we are CG Jesus Will Sing and Shout the victories [Music] [Music] will open we shall tread the streets of gold and we all together [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus Will Sing and Shout the victory [Music] amen well I feel like preaching let's sing he abides the Bible says God is not the author of confusion and if he's directing the church there won't be confusion in it and so that's just one way to know whether we're in line where we need to be so always step back and make sure that what you're doing is causing more of a unity and more of a working in the direction of his the purposes those five purposes that he I hope you took notes and you wrote those things down amen amen may he he abide in US amen I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk Pilgrim Way for the hand of God in all my life I see and the reason of my bless yes the secret all is this that the comforter abides with me [Music] foreign [Music] I heard how Jesus died upon the tree and I fell down at his feet and there came a piece so sweet now the comforter abides with me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] for the spirit let's control Jesus satisfies my soul since the comforter Popeyes with me [Music] [Applause] [Music] there's no thirsting for the things of the world if we live [Music] [Music] rejoice [Music] amen one more time [Music] [Applause] [Music]
