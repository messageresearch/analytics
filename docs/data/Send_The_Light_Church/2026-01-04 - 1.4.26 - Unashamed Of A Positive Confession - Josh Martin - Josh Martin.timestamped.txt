[0:02] So humble yourself and see what God will
[0:06] do.
[0:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many wants
[0:13] to see what God will do?
[0:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:17] You know, he he said,
[0:20] you know, how many likes holding God to
[0:22] his word?

[5:32] Hallelujah. Without him, I could do
[5:35] nothing.
[5:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:37] Without him,
[5:40] I could do nothing. [singing]
[5:46] Without him, [singing]
[5:49] I'd surely fail.
[5:54] Without him, I would be drifting
[5:58] [singing]
[6:01] like a ship
[6:03] without
[6:05] a sail.
[6:09] Oh Jesus.
[6:12] Oh Jesus.
[6:16] Do you know him today?
[6:20] Please don't turn him [singing] away. Oh
[6:24] Jesus.
[6:27] Oh Jesus.
[6:31] Without him how lost I would be.
[6:38] Without him
[6:41] I would be dying. [singing]
[6:45] Without him I'd be enslaved.
[6:53] Without him, I would be hopeless.
[6:59] But with Jesus, thank God, I am saved.
[7:07] Oh Jesus.
[7:10] Oh Jesus. [singing]
[7:13] Do you know him today? Please don't turn
[7:18] him [singing]
[7:19] away. Oh Jesus.
[7:24] Oh Jesus. [singing]
[7:28] Without him how lost I would be.
[7:34] So I asked him to be my pilot. Amen.
[7:42] His word my compass and guide.
[7:49] Till I'm safely
[7:51] anchored in glory.
[7:56] Without him, I'd be drifting the tide.
[8:03] Jesus.
[8:06] Oh Jesus.
[8:09] Do you know him today? Please don't turn
[8:14] him away. Oh Jesus.
[8:19] Oh Jesus.
[8:23] Without him how lost I would be.
[8:29] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[8:34] I'd be lost.
[8:37] You know when it says
[8:39] don't turn him away.
[8:42] I'm guilty of that.
[8:49] We all need prayer.
[8:53] That's why we have amazing grace. Amen.
[8:59] Amazing
[9:02] grace, how sweet the sound that saved
[9:08] [singing]
[9:09] a ranch like me.
[9:14] I once was lost but now I'm found. Was
[9:22] blind [singing]
[9:23] but now I see.
[9:28] It was grace that taught my heart to
[9:34] fear and grace my fears relieve.
[9:42] How preious
[9:45] did that grace appear
[9:49] the hour I first believe. [singing]
[9:56] Through many
[9:59] dangerous
[10:00] toils and snares I have already
[10:07] come.
[10:10] His grace had brought me safe thus far.
[10:17] And grace will lead me home.
[10:24] When we've been there 10,000
[10:29] years, bright shineing
[10:32] as the sun,
[10:37] we've no less days to sing God's praise
[10:44] than when we first begun.
[10:51] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[10:56] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[11:01] Praise God.
[11:04] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[11:09] Praise God. Praise God. Praise God.
[11:14] Praise God.
[11:17] Hallelujah.
[11:19] You know that's my eternal song.
[11:25] Amen. Well, I just like to change your
[11:27] order of service. Amen. But once again,
[11:29] I'd like to thank everybody for coming.
[11:32] How many is looking forward to the new
[11:34] year?
[11:35] Amen. You know, like I I I was
[11:38] commenting to brother John this morning.
[11:40] I says, "I'm one day closer.
[11:43] One day older, but I'm one day closer to
[11:45] him."
[11:47] That's I'm excited about that.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, let's just remember all
[11:52] those that aren't here. Amen. With
[11:55] sicknesses going around and everything
[11:57] else like that, let's just keep them in
[11:59] our hearts and our our prayers. Amen.
[12:03] Uh we're having a just a quick
[12:05] announcement here. Um
[12:08] see, Brother John sitting up here, which
[12:10] you all probably didn't know. We have
[12:12] Josh Martin's going to be um doing the
[12:16] service for us today. And I pray that uh
[12:19] through
[12:21] this next part of the service, you just
[12:22] ask God to just prepare your heart for
[12:25] the word and I believe God will meet you
[12:29] where where you are. Amen. So, let's
[12:32] just keep that in our hearts. Amen. also
[12:35] for the Christians in Iran uh for God's
[12:38] protection for them. Uh there's a lot of
[12:41] persecuting going on. Um
[12:44] but God's doing wonderful things too.
[12:47] You know, sometimes we have to go
[12:49] through the fire of uh refinement,
[12:53] but God's always true to his word. Amen.
[12:57] Also, let's uh just remember that
[12:59] there's the new calendars are out there
[13:01] on on the glass counter for the new
[13:03] year.
[13:04] and um
[13:06] just to grab one, grab it to somebody,
[13:08] use it as a uh tool to just testify and
[13:13] um you know, share the gospel.
[13:16] I mean, we don't have we don't have much
[13:19] time left. So, let's use the time
[13:22] wisely. And I think that's uh we just
[13:25] had a service on wisdom and I I believe
[13:27] that is probably one of the wisest
[13:31] things we can do. So, let's just
[13:33] remember that. Uh, let's just stand.
[13:36] Amen. Uh, before we go in prayer, I just
[13:39] uh I know we're welcome to see our
[13:42] brother Marty here with us. Uh,
[13:45] especially Charlie. Amen. And all those
[13:47] that's come this morning. Um, brother
[13:50] Marty, could you uh just give us a good
[13:53] word of uh testimony there?
[15:01] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, let's give the Lord the
[15:07] credit for that one. And also your
[15:10] prayers, right? So God works on the
[15:13] behalf of his people and we just pray
[15:16] that uh you know through the course of
[15:18] this new year that we can just give him
[15:20] more credit because he's he's worthy.
[15:26] I mean we're here,
[15:30] right?
[15:32] Every every second we breathe.
[15:38] So, let's just remember all those that
[15:39] are live streaming this year. And uh
[15:42] just pray that uh God would bless him
[15:45] also. And uh obviously u Jonathan's not
[15:50] here. I don't know if he's sick, but
[15:52] let's just lift him up in prayer. Lift
[15:54] all those up in prayer. Our sister
[15:56] Linda, our brother Ben, everybody else
[15:59] that's not here. Uh Sister Elizabeth, uh
[16:02] Murphy, amen. Just all those that are in
[16:06] need. And um even sometimes when you're
[16:09] not in need, you're in need. I'm always
[16:12] in need of him. So let's just go on one

[24:37] be marching in.
[24:41] And we're going to be free from sin.
[24:45] And brother Brandham told us that sin
[24:47] was unbelief.
[24:49] We're going to be free from all
[24:50] unbelief.
[24:53] And I'm so glad today that we can be in
[24:55] the house of God with faith in the word
[24:58] of God as it is our absolute. And it's
[25:01] not just God's absolute, but it's our
[25:03] absolute as well. And the more that we
[25:06] can believe, the more our nature gets
[25:09] changed.
[25:11] And and that's what's going to put us in
[25:13] a rapture is a is a completely born
[25:16] again experience.
[25:18] And that is a changed nature. Amen. Um,
[25:22] how many here today
[25:26] um
[25:28] wants to put forth a greater effort to
[25:31] see that change in 26 than in 25. It
[25:34] just seems to be a little bit of more of
[25:36] a desperation.
[25:37] Um, I think we're I think we're feeling
[25:40] closer to the coming of the Lord and
[25:43] rightly so. I think it's put inside of
[25:46] uh the believer to get ready. there's
[25:49] something inside of him. You know, no
[25:51] man knows the day or the hour, but you
[25:53] you know, Jesus told us about the season
[25:55] and sensing. So, I believe that he's
[25:58] calling us. I'm Well, I'm excited um to
[26:01] have brother Josh Martin with us today.
[26:04] He was supposed to be here next Sunday,
[26:06] but he's going to Nicaragua two weeks
[26:08] from yesterday. And he asked if he could
[26:11] just change it. and we just of course um
[26:15] so it's a little sooner than we
[26:16] anticipated and we've just um we're just
[26:19] have been blessed by the ministry that
[26:21] he has been giving us so far as he's
[26:24] come.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; It's been uh encouraging. It's been
[26:27] right in line with the message in the
[26:29] word and um I'm just looking forward to
[26:34] the ministry of the word today and I'm
[26:37] looking forward to receiving it.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; Right. I want to go from my ears into my
[26:43] heart into a manifestation
[26:46] uh in the days to come. So let's um put
[26:50] our heart into receiving the word. Not
[26:53] not um not just saying a let's start
[26:55] with saying amen,
[26:57] [laughter]
[26:58] &gt;&gt; but let our heart just you know receive
[27:01] it. Amen. I hope everybody had a merry

[29:13] this morning. Lord, I receive. I don't
[29:16] want to just say I believe it and not
[29:18] receive it, but I want to receive it.
[29:20] Brother Brandham, he would he would tell
[29:22] us that if Christ was here in this suit
[29:24] and tie, he couldn't do nothing for you.
[29:26] He couldn't heal your body. And he would
[29:29] say, "How come?" Because he's already
[29:31] done it. And so, we're just receiving
[29:33] what he's already done for us there at
[29:35] Calvary. Are you thankful for the
[29:37] blessings of God that he's bestowed upon
[29:39] us? Has he been good to you?
[29:41] &gt;&gt; I trust y'all have had a a good year so
[29:44] far. We're just a few days in it, but
[29:46] the same Lord that was faithful last
[29:48] year, I believe is going to be faithful
[29:50] this year as well. If you would have
[29:52] your scriptures, Mark 8 and 38, just
[29:56] have a simple thought this morning, but
[29:58] I pray it'll bless you and encourage you
[30:00] in some way. It is good to be here this
[30:03] morning. Uh like like uh brother our
[30:06] pastor was saying uh we were supposed to
[30:08] be here in a in uh next week, but uh I'm
[30:12] be going to Nicaragua here pretty soon.
[30:14] So I had to move some things around. Um
[30:16] so I appreciate y'all allowing me to
[30:18] come this week instead. So I covered
[30:21] y'all's prayers when I go to Nicaragua.
[30:23] I'll be there for about 12 days. Be
[30:25] doing a youth camp and be ministering at
[30:27] some of the local churches there. So,
[30:29] we're praying that the Lord will bless
[30:31] the trip and and give us a a successful
[30:34] journey. And I bring greetings before I
[30:36] forget from my home church, brother
[30:38] Wendel Martin and the saints there, New
[30:39] Life Outreach, they send their greetings
[30:41] to y'all this morning. But Mark 8:38,
[30:45] the Bible would say, "Whosoever
[30:47] therefore shall be ashamed of me and of
[30:50] my words in this adulterous and sinful
[30:52] generation, of him also shall the Son of
[30:55] Man be ashamed, when he cometh in the
[30:58] glory of his father with the holy
[31:00] angels." Can we bow our heads this
[31:02] morning? Dear gracious heavenly father,
[31:05] Lord, how grateful we are for your
[31:07] presence that we feel this morning,
[31:09] Lord. God, we're thankful for this
[31:11] opportunity that we've that you've given
[31:13] us, Lord, to come into your house and to
[31:15] to worship you, Lord. And we ask, God,
[31:18] that you would just feel welcome here
[31:20] among us, Father. Lord, we don't want to
[31:22] just invite you, but we want to make
[31:23] sure you feel welcome. We want to
[31:25] entertain your presence, Lord. We want
[31:27] to, God, make sure that, Lord, we open
[31:31] up our hearts, Lord, and our and our
[31:33] minds, Father. Whatever you would have
[31:34] for us this morning, we want you to have
[31:37] your perfect way, Father. God, you see
[31:39] this little thought that's upon my
[31:41] heart. I ask that you would anoint it.
[31:43] Father, may inspiration strike the
[31:45] heart. Father, we ask that there be a
[31:48] heart to receive what you have for us
[31:49] today in Jesus' name. Amen. You may be
[31:53] seated here this morning. Uh my my
[31:56] thought today would be unashamed of a
[31:58] positive confession. And I spoke a
[32:01] little bit on these lines when I was
[32:03] here a few weeks ago. So I hope I don't
[32:06] repeat myself uh too much this morning.
[32:09] But whosoever is ashamed of me and of my
[32:12] words in this adulterous and sinful
[32:15] generation, I will be ashamed of him.
[32:17] And brother Brandon, he would put this
[32:19] as a present day scripture. And that's
[32:22] what I love so much about the message of
[32:24] the hour is he's letting us know where
[32:27] we are at today. Not something of the
[32:29] past or or necessarily something to
[32:31] come, but he was letting us know where
[32:34] we're at today. That God didn't just
[32:36] work in the past. And God ain't just
[32:38] going to work in the future, but God is
[32:40] working today in the individual lives of
[32:43] his children. And brother Brandon, he
[32:45] would tell us that that Noah's message
[32:48] wouldn't work for Moses's day and Moses
[32:50] message wouldn't work for when Jesus was
[32:52] upon the earth. And so it always takes a
[32:55] certain uh certain messenger or a
[32:58] message to pinpoint where we are today
[33:01] that that we're not worshiping under a
[33:04] place of yesterday, but it's a present
[33:06] day revelation that we can come and
[33:09] worship God. And and I believe this is a
[33:12] present day scripture where we don't
[33:14] have to be ashamed of what God has done
[33:16] for us in this generation. And brother
[33:19] Brandon would say, you notice there in
[33:21] the in the message ashamed, he says, you
[33:23] notice there's so much of that today,
[33:25] especially on the subject that I'm
[33:27] speaking of, ashamed of the word. Now,
[33:30] he and the word are the same. He says,
[33:33] "In the beginning was the word, and the
[33:35] word was with God, and the word was God.
[33:38] And the word was made flesh and dwelt
[33:40] among us, the same yesterday, today, and
[33:43] forever. So whosoever is ashamed of me
[33:45] and my word, and he and his word are
[33:48] one, so be being ashamed of his word in
[33:52] this sinful present generation." So he
[33:54] puts it a present day scripture and he's
[33:57] letting us know that being ashamed of
[33:59] Christ is being ashamed of his word. And
[34:02] and we're living in a time where it's
[34:05] easy to become ashamed of things. We're
[34:07] living in a in a day where where nobody
[34:10] nobody is satisfied. You know, nobody
[34:13] likes the way they look. You know,
[34:14] there's there's there's so many
[34:16] complexes in the in the world today that
[34:19] there's some that have complexes about
[34:21] being too short. Other ones have
[34:22] complexes about being too tall. You
[34:24] know, some is too white, some is too
[34:26] dark, some is some is too skinny, some
[34:29] is too chubby. It's complexes that that
[34:32] the devil puts upon us to make us
[34:35] unsatisfied with the way God has made
[34:38] us. And it's easy to become unsatisfied
[34:41] with the word that God has given us. And
[34:44] and we know what happens when you're
[34:46] unsatisfied with something. You begin to
[34:48] nitpick at it and you you try to find
[34:50] the faults in it. You try to find the
[34:52] the failures in it, you know. And and
[34:55] we're living in in a time if you don't
[34:57] like your blue car, you can get a black
[34:59] car if you don't like that. The black
[35:00] car, you can get a red car. And there's
[35:02] many options out there that if you're
[35:04] unsatisfied, there's options out there
[35:07] you can find. You know, some people
[35:09] their house is too small, so there's a
[35:10] bigger house for them. It's too big.
[35:12] There's a smaller house for them. But
[35:14] Jesus would tell us that that we're not
[35:17] to live by bread alone, but by every
[35:19] word that proceedth out of the mouth of
[35:21] God. So, while there's options out there
[35:24] naturally, God only gives us one option,
[35:27] that's the word of the Lord. And brother
[35:30] Brandon would tell us that the
[35:31] brightest, thus sayaith the Lord, or she
[35:34] keeps still. And that doesn't mean the
[35:36] Lord's going to prophesy through you.
[35:38] May maybe through a vision or something,
[35:40] but he's prophesying through you by the
[35:42] word that he's already sent you. You
[35:45] remember uh the Apostle John, he would
[35:47] be on the aisle of Patmas and he would
[35:48] get caught up in the spirit on the
[35:50] Lord's day and and he would see would
[35:53] start to see visions and things and when
[35:55] the book would become open he would hear
[35:58] a voice to tell John go take the book
[36:00] eat the book and what what would the
[36:02] voice tell him? Prophesy again which is
[36:05] your type John was a type of the
[36:08] believer in Christ. So the the voice
[36:11] wasn't telling John to have its own
[36:13] prophecies, but he's letting John know
[36:16] you're partaking of the book. And what
[36:18] you're eating of, that's going to be
[36:20] your confession. That's going to be what
[36:23] you will say. So I believe the bride is
[36:26] a prophetic group of people. Brother
[36:28] Brandon would say it's a prophetic class
[36:30] of people. And what that means is you
[36:32] have eyes to see what God is doing in
[36:35] the present generation. cuz we can see
[36:38] what God done through Noah. We can see
[36:40] what God done through through Abraham.
[36:43] And and that's what the Pharisees and
[36:45] the Sadducees would have. You know, God,
[36:48] we're the sons of Abraham. We're this
[36:49] and we're that. And here Christ would
[36:51] say before Abraham was, I am. So they
[36:55] could see what God was what God done,
[36:58] but could not see what God was doing.
[37:01] But I believe there's a prophetic group
[37:03] of people upon the earth that hasn't
[37:06] just seen what God can do, but they're
[37:08] seeing what God is doing today. And I
[37:11] believe that he is still the same
[37:13] yesterday, today, and and forever. The
[37:16] same God that could split the Red Sea
[37:19] for Moses is the same God that can split
[37:22] Red Seas in our spiritual walk. Brother
[37:24] Brandon would tell us that the natural
[37:26] seed of of Abraham would would would
[37:29] defy kingdoms. They would defy them that
[37:31] they would conquer fire. They would
[37:33] conquer water. But the spiritual uh
[37:36] people of Abraham might not be fighting
[37:39] a natural army or the Bible would tell
[37:41] us WE'RE NOT FIGHTING FLESH and blood,
[37:43] right? So we might not need a natural
[37:45] Red Sea split. But the SAME GOD THAT
[37:48] SPLIT the Red Sea for the natural people
[37:50] of Abraham is splitting spiritual Red
[37:53] Seas for the spiritual group group of
[37:56] children of Abraham. So we see what God
[38:00] is doing in this present generation. And
[38:03] I believe that the Bible would tell us
[38:05] that we're living in a time of famine.
[38:08] And the Bible would say in Amos 8:11,
[38:10] "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord
[38:13] God, that I will send a famine in the
[38:15] land, not a famine of bread, nor a
[38:17] thirst for water, but for hearing of the
[38:20] words of the Lord. And they shall run
[38:23] from sea to sea, from the north even to
[38:26] the east. They shall run to and fro to
[38:29] seek the word of the Lord and shall not
[38:32] find it." And what I think is so
[38:34] powerful about this scripture is
[38:36] whenever you think of a famine, normally
[38:39] you think of something uh you there's
[38:41] not enough food or you've ran out of
[38:44] water. So the resource that that you're
[38:46] needing is non-existent. And so there's
[38:49] a hunger because there's nothing there
[38:52] to to to give a to give food or to give
[38:54] water. But here the Bible is saying that
[38:57] this famine is a different famine. It's
[39:00] not for bread nor for water. And he in
[39:02] the Bible even say that the word of the
[39:05] Lord is going to be here. But this
[39:07] famine is they can't hear the words of
[39:11] the Lord. And here they are the
[39:13] wandering from sea to sea, from church
[39:15] to church, from from denomination to
[39:18] denomination looking for the word of the
[39:21] Lord, but they can't find it. And what I
[39:23] think is so incredible is brother
[39:25] Brandham would ask the question, are we
[39:28] sufficiently impressed with the word
[39:31] that is in our midst? In other words,
[39:33] ARE WE SATISFIED WITH IT? BECAUSE HERE,
[39:36] brother Brown, I mean, he would preach a
[39:38] word and and he wouldn't he wouldn't
[39:40] draw circles, but he would make bigger
[39:41] circles. He would preach for the the
[39:43] denominational brothers, but they would
[39:45] not have an ear to hear the word for the
[39:48] present generation. So they were seeking
[39:51] to and fro LOOKING FOR THE WORD, BUT YET
[39:54] THEY WAS NOT SATISFIED with the word
[39:57] that God had GIVEN THEM. BUT I BELIEVE
[40:00] THAT THE BRIDE IS SATISFIED with the
[40:03] word that God has given us IN THIS
[40:06] GENERATION BECAUSE WE'RE IN A FAMINE.
[40:08] It's either the word or it's nothing.
[40:11] And I believe this word has an authority
[40:14] to change lives. I I BELIEVE IT HAS AN
[40:17] AUTHORITY TO GIVE REVIVALS. IT HAS
[40:19] AUTHORITY TO TO SAVE REBELLIOUS
[40:22] CHILDREN. IT HAS AN AUTHORITY IF YOU'RE
[40:25] WILLING to be satisfied with it. And
[40:28] it's incredible because the Bible would
[40:30] tell us about a famine whenever whenever
[40:33] Ahab was the king. And you can look at
[40:35] first kings 18 and5. And Ahab said unto
[40:38] Oadiah, "Go into the land under unto all
[40:42] fountains of water, unto all brooks.
[40:44] pre-adventure we may find grass to save
[40:47] the horses and mules alive that we lose
[40:50] not all the beasts. It's incredible
[40:53] because while this is going on, uh the
[40:56] Elijah would be in a cave somewhere by
[40:59] the word of the Lord and he'd be getting
[41:01] food and brother Brown would say that
[41:03] food was his strength. And so while he
[41:06] WAS GAINING STRENGTH FROM THE WORD of
[41:09] the Lord here that the king Ahab was
[41:12] sending out his servants just in that
[41:15] word pre-adventure means a just in case
[41:17] or or happen that we might find grass.
[41:20] HE'S SENDING OUT HIS SERVANTS TO FIND
[41:22] life because his donkeys were dying, his
[41:25] mules were dying, his sheep was dying.
[41:28] In other words, the things that was
[41:31] important TO HIM WAS DYING BECAUSE it
[41:34] was a famine. And we're looking at at
[41:37] America today there. It's a they're
[41:39] claiming to be a Christian nation.
[41:41] There's there's a church on every CORNER
[41:43] ALMOST, BUT YET BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT to
[41:46] them, THEIR CHILDREN are dying. The
[41:48] churches are dying. THE MARRIAGES ARE
[41:51] DYING. AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
[41:53] SOMETHING. BUT YET, THE BRIDE IS
[41:55] SATISFIED WITH THE WORD OF THE LORD. And
[41:58] it's in A SECRET PLACE WITH ALMIGHTY
[42:01] GOD. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE because the
[42:03] Bible would tell us in Psalms 23 and
[42:06] two, he maketh me to lie down in green
[42:08] pastures. He leadeth me beside still
[42:12] waters. So while Ahab, Hallelujah. So
[42:15] while Ahab was sending OUT HIS SERVANTS
[42:18] TO FIND WATER, SENDING OUT HIS SERVANTS
[42:20] TO FIND GREEN GRASS, HERE ELIJAH WAS IN
[42:24] A SECRET PLACE AND SO IS THE BRIDE.
[42:27] WHILE THE WHILE THE CHURCH world is
[42:28] LOOKING FOR THE FOUNTAIN OF LIVING
[42:31] WATER, WE HAVE been we have been MADE TO
[42:33] LAY DOWN BESIDE STILL WATERS. WHILE
[42:36] THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT CAN
[42:38] FIX LIVES. WE HAVE BEEN LYING DOWN IN
[42:41] THE GREEN PASTURES OF THE WORD OF
[42:44] ALMIGHTY GOD. SO WHILE THEY'RE LOOKING
[42:46] FOR SOMETHING, THE BRIDE HAS ALREADY
[42:49] FOUND IT. HALLELUJAH. WE'RE NO LONGER
[42:51] LOOKING, BUT WE ARE EATING AND ARE
[42:54] SATISFIED WITH WHAT GOD has given us.
[42:57] Because the Bible would tell us there in
[43:00] Joel 2 and 25, I will restore to you the
[43:04] years that the locust had eaten, the
[43:06] cankerworm, and the palmer worm, and my
[43:09] great army which are sent among you, and
[43:12] you shall eat in plenty, and be
[43:14] satisfied. And praise the name of the
[43:17] Lord your God, that have dealt
[43:19] wondrously with you, and my people will
[43:22] never be ashamed." I think it's
[43:25] incredible because while one prophecy is
[43:28] saying there's going to be a lack of
[43:29] hearing the word and it's a it's a
[43:32] famine, there's another prophecy saying
[43:35] we're going to eat in plenty. So, we're
[43:37] going to fall under one of those groups,
[43:39] right?
[43:40] &gt;&gt; I don't want to fall under the group
[43:43] that is unsatisfied with the word and
[43:46] looking FOR SOMETHING. I WANT TO be the
[43:48] one that is eating in plenty. And it's
[43:51] incredible how that the the prophet
[43:53] Joel, he will link being satisfied with
[43:56] not being ashamed. SO ONCE YOU'RE
[43:58] SATISFIED with something, YOU'RE NOT
[44:01] GOING TO be ashamed of it. You see, and
[44:03] that's WHERE THE DEVIL FIGHTS us many
[44:05] times is to get us UNSATISFIED WITH WHAT
[44:09] GOD has given us. To get us unsatisfied
[44:11] with the church God has given us or the
[44:13] or or the tapes God has given us. AND
[44:16] WHEN THAT HAPPENS, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE
[44:19] UH WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE ASSURANCE
[44:21] of the word of the Lord to speak the
[44:23] word of the Lord. You see, I believe
[44:25] that the SPOKEN WORD IS INSIDE OF THE
[44:28] BRIDE TODAY THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE THE FINAL
[44:30] VOICE TO THE FINAL GENERATION. AND I
[44:33] BELIEVE that the WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD
[44:36] CAN TAKE CONTROL OF A PERSON THAT when
[44:39] you speak THE WORD OF THE LORD, GOD
[44:41] HONORS THAT WORD. BUT THE DEVIL'S what
[44:44] the devil's tactic is is to MAKE YOU
[44:46] UNSATISFIED WITH IT THAT YOU'VE GOT NO
[44:49] ASSURANCE TO SPEAK THE word of the Lord.
[44:52] Oh, hallelujah. Because if you think
[44:55] THAT GOD CAN'T HEAL, YOU'RE NOT GOING to
[44:57] speak the word of healing. Right? If you
[44:59] don't think God can save, you're not
[45:01] going to pray the the a prayer of
[45:03] salvation over your children or or pray
[45:05] that God fills THEM WITH THE HOLY GHOST
[45:07] if you don't think God can do it. BUT IF
[45:10] YOU'RE SATISFIED AND BELIEVE WITH AN
[45:13] ASSURANCE THAT GOD CAN DO IT, THEN THAT
[45:15] BECOMES YOUR CONFESSION THAT IT MIGHT
[45:18] LOOK HOPELESS, IT MIGHT LOOK BLEAK, BUT
[45:19] THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD SAYS MY
[45:22] CHILDREN CAN BE SAVED THAT THEY CAN BE
[45:24] FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. THEN THAT
[45:26] BECOMES YOUR CONFESSION. HALLELUJAH.
[45:29] THAT BECOMES YOUR CONFESSION. INSTEAD of
[45:31] saying, "I don't know if it can happen.
[45:33] I don't know if God CAN DO IT." THAT
[45:35] DOES AWAY WITH THE NEGATIVITY AND IT
[45:38] BRINGS ON A POSITIVE WORD AND SAYS I
[45:41] KNOW GOD CAN DO IT. HALLELUJAH.
[45:44] FROM ME IN MY HOUSE. I'M GOING TO STAND
[45:46] UPON THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD BECAUSE I
[45:50] AM SATISFIED WITH IT. AND it's
[45:52] incredible because because this word is
[45:55] something we can eat upon. While the
[45:57] world is looking for something, we're
[45:59] being satisfied by the word of almighty
[46:02] God. And and the Bible would tell us in
[46:04] Matthew 24 and 28, for whoosoever the
[46:08] carcass is there, the eagles will be
[46:10] gathered together. And I think that's
[46:13] incredible because there's an attraction
[46:16] that comes with the word of the Lord.
[46:18] You know, we have uh we uh we we like to
[46:20] play basketball back home and we have
[46:22] some young young boys and some young
[46:25] adults that that likes to play ball and
[46:27] I'm still young myself. I'm only 27. So,
[46:30] I like to get out there and play
[46:31] basketball with them from time to time
[46:33] and and there's a group chat that
[46:35] they've got together and on that chat is
[46:38] only the ones that are interested in it,
[46:40] right? So, whenever somebody wants to
[46:42] play, hey, y'all want to play tonight or
[46:43] you want to play tomorrow night? AND IT
[46:45] SENDS OUT AN invitation to the ones who
[46:49] would be interested in it. You see, we
[46:51] we have a a brother at our church,
[46:53] Brother Torrance, and he's in his 80s,
[46:55] and and he's not on that group chat. you
[46:58] and I'm sure you WOULD KNOW WHY. THERE'S
[47:00] NO INTEREST IN PLAYING BASKETBALL,
[47:01] RIGHT? AND SO HERE THE BIBLE SAYS WHERE
[47:04] THE CARCASSES THERE, THE EAGLES WILL BE
[47:07] GATHERED TOGETHER. In other words,
[47:09] there's an attraction there BECAUSE
[47:12] THERE'S A SEED THERE. THERE'S A DESIRE
[47:14] THERE. AND SINCE THERE'S A DESIRE THERE,
[47:17] THE WORD IS GOING TO SATISFY THAT DESIRE
[47:21] THAT IS ON THE INSIDE OF THE BELIEVER.
[47:24] OH, HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY YOU MAY HAVE
[47:26] BEEN THROUGH SOME HARD TIMES. YOU MAY
[47:28] HAVE BEEN THROUGH DISCOURAGING TIMES,
[47:30] BUT YET YOU'RE STILL SATISFIED WITH THE
[47:33] WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD IS BECAUSE THERE'S
[47:36] AN ATTRACTION ON THE INSIDE THAT SAYS,
[47:39] "WHERE WOULD I GO? FOR THOU HAST THE
[47:42] WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE." WHAT IS IT? IT'S
[47:44] A DEEP CALLING TO THE DEEP AND THERE'S A
[47:48] DEEP TO RESPOND. HALLELUJAH. WE'VE
[47:51] TASTED OF THE HEAVENLY things of
[47:53] Almighty God. And I believe the meat of
[47:56] the word satisfies the taste of the
[47:59] eagles. And and brother Brandon would
[48:01] say then he's tasting of the heavenly
[48:03] things. And he's he's got the whole word
[48:05] of God in his heart. He sees that
[48:08] manifested before him. And his whole
[48:11] soul is wrapped into it. And the world
[48:14] and all things is dead around him. HE'S
[48:17] TASTED OF THE HEAVENLY things of God.
[48:20] How many can testify of that? I'VE
[48:22] TASTED OF THE HEAVENLY THINGS OF GOD.
[48:24] And and it's incredible because he says
[48:27] that he's tasted of the heavenly things
[48:29] of God and he's wrapped his whole soul
[48:32] into it. SO ONCE YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH
[48:35] SOMETHING, YOU'RE WILLING TO ANCHOR
[48:37] everything upon what you're satisfied
[48:39] with. You know, and I I remember uh as a
[48:43] kid, and it might might not have been
[48:44] popular up here, I don't know. But did
[48:46] y'all ever hear the the the dinar? Yeah.
[48:49] It was a a foreign currency and and it
[48:51] was years ago. I was a little kid like
[48:53] and I remember there was our barber, you
[48:56] know, oh, Elden and and we he would cut
[48:58] our hair and every time we'd go in
[48:59] there, he he would talk TO MY DAD,
[49:01] WENDLE, DID YOU GET YOU SOME DINAR YET?
[49:03] YOU KNOW, AND HE WAS SO CONVINCED THAT
[49:06] THIS WAS THE GENUINE THING. HE WAS
[49:08] WILLING to pay pay MONEY FOR IT AND AND
[49:10] he would he and it's been years LATER
[49:13] AND NOTHING'S HAPPENED YET. WHAT WAS IT?
[49:16] He was convinced by it BUT HAD NO
[49:18] ASSURANCE OF IT. HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE
[49:21] THERE'S AN ASSURANCE THAT THE BRIDE OF
[49:23] CHRIST CAN HAVE. AND WHEN WE'VE TASTED
[49:27] OF THE HEAVENLY THINGS and we're willing
[49:29] to wrap everything into it, willing to
[49:32] wrap our children into it, willing to
[49:34] wrap our church into it, WILLING TO WRAP
[49:36] OUR HEALTH INTO IT, OUR FUTURE INTO IT,
[49:39] THE RAPTURE INTO IT, we've wrapped
[49:41] oursel into it because we've tasted of
[49:44] it. And it's the taste I was looking
[49:47] for.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, brother Brandon would
[49:51] would preach a message called uh a
[49:53] thinking man's filter, you know, and he
[49:55] he would talk about how he was in the
[49:56] woods, right? And he would see a
[49:59] cigarette carton, right? And it was the
[50:01] slogan a smoking man's filter, a smoking
[50:03] a smoking man's taste. I think that's
[50:05] how the phrase would go. He would look
[50:07] at it and would say, "Well, the phrase
[50:09] ain't necessarily wrong, but what it
[50:11] stands for is wrong." He would he would
[50:13] change IT TO WHAT TO what was uh he he
[50:16] would I think in man's filter a holy
[50:19] man's taste and HE WOULD TALK ABOUT HOW
[50:21] THAT how that that's the that the per
[50:23] the people that smoke is looking for a
[50:26] certain taste right he would say that if
[50:29] they wasn't looking for a certain taste
[50:31] give them a stick and they can suck on
[50:33] the stick but they wouldn't be satisfied
[50:35] with it he would say suck ON YOUR FINGER
[50:37] HE SAYS THEY SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY
[50:40] just sucking on something, but they're
[50:42] looking for the taste of the nicotine,
[50:45] RIGHT? SO, NOT ANYTHING COULD GIVE THAT
[50:47] CERTAIN TASTE. SO, even though they
[50:49] could suck on a stick or suck on their
[50:52] finger, IT WOULD NOT SATISFY THE TASTE
[50:55] THAT THEY WAS LOOKING FOR. AND SO, THE
[50:57] BRIDE WOULD HAVE A CERTAIN TASTE THAT IT
[51:00] WAS LOOKING FOR. THAT'S WHY YOU MAY HAVE
[51:02] been in in a denominational setting or
[51:04] may have been in a in a trinitarian
[51:06] church, but you WERE STILL LOOKING FOR
[51:09] SOMETHING MORE. AND WHENEVER THOUGH THE
[51:11] THE THE WORD OF THE PRESENT DAY WOULD
[51:14] COME ACROSS YOUR PATH, THAT WAS THE
[51:16] TASTE THAT YOU WAS LOOKING FOR AND IT
[51:19] WILL SATISFY YOU IN THE TIME OF FAMINE.
[51:22] AND IT'S FOOD THAT WE CAN EAT ON. AND
[51:24] AND it's incredible because brother
[51:26] Brandon would tell us that the healing
[51:28] is the children's bread. AND HE WOULD
[51:30] TELL US THAT THAT IN IN IN the message
[51:33] spiritual food in due season, he can say
[51:36] we CAN EAT OFF OF OUR HEALING. WE CAN WE
[51:38] can eat off the word of the Lord and and
[51:41] so it's NOT JUST A PHRASE THAT THE WORD
[51:44] of the Lord is our food, BUT IT'S A
[51:46] REALITY. WHATEVER YOU EAT IS WHAT YOU'RE
[51:49] GOING TO BECOME. IS THAT RIGHT? You
[51:52] can't eat a dozen donuts every day and
[51:54] and and YOU NOT BECOME THAT, RIGHT? OR
[51:57] OR YOU CAN'T EAT A SALAD EVERY DAY OF
[51:59] YOUR LIFE AND AND NOT LOSE WEIGHT. IS
[52:01] THAT RIGHT? And and I guess it's been
[52:04] about two years ago, I guess. No, last
[52:06] year, I believe. And it was I I lost
[52:08] some weight. I lost about 40 lbs. And
[52:10] and what I had to do was change my diet,
[52:14] right? How many's ever been there? I I
[52:17] love my honey buns. I love my bread and
[52:19] my milk. But in order for me to see a
[52:22] change in my life, I had to see I had to
[52:25] CHANGE MY DIET. OH, I'M PREACHING NOW.
[52:28] MANY PEOPLE WANT TO SEE A CHANGE in
[52:30] their spiritual life, but ain't WILLING
[52:32] TO CHANGE THE DIET. YOU ARE WHAT YOU
[52:35] EAT, RIGHT? YOU WHAT YOU SPEAK IS WHAT'S
[52:38] IN THE HEART. AND SO IF you want TO
[52:39] SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD, THE WORD OF
[52:42] THE LORD HAS TO BE IN THE HEART.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Come on. Now, you know, and I hope this
[52:47] is okay, brother.
[52:50] I I was preaching one time and I I I
[52:53] stated the message and then that that's
[52:55] what I preach, you know, and the pastor
[52:57] came up to me afterwards and was like,
[52:58] "WHERE DID YOU GET ALL THAT?" IT'S IN
[53:00] THE MESSAGE, you know, and I the first
[53:04] time I had I had preached at a place and
[53:07] and they were sort of giving me a hard
[53:09] time about reading notes and and we want
[53:11] something fresh, you know, and and but
[53:14] but yet at THE SAME TIME, I'VE GOT
[53:16] SOMETHING TO SAY, YOU KNOW, I'm only
[53:19] GOING TO SPEAK WHAT I'M EATING ON,
[53:21] RIGHT? And I heard a story one time
[53:23] about a about a boy that would have a
[53:25] test coming up and and I hope this is
[53:27] okay this morning. I'm just preaching,
[53:29] you know, and and this boy had a test
[53:31] coming up and he would pray to God and
[53:33] say, "Lord, HELP ME TO PASS this test
[53:36] and and he would believe that God was
[53:38] going to help him." So, you know what he
[53:39] would do instead of studying? He would
[53:41] go play with the friends and he would go
[53:43] do this and do that and and the test
[53:45] came about and he he whatever came to
[53:47] his mind, he was putting down AND AND HE
[53:49] FLUNKED IT, RIGHT? And he and he and he
[53:51] cries to the Lord, "God, I thought you
[53:53] was going to help me do the test and I
[53:55] thought you WAS GOING TO HELP ME ON IT."
[53:56] And the Lord would speak back to him and
[53:58] say, "Yeah, BUT I COULDN'T BRING NOTHING
[54:00] BACK TO YOUR REMEMBRANCE." IN OTHER
[54:02] WORDS, YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING, TOO.
[54:04] YOU GOT TO STUDY AND THEN THE LORD CAN
[54:07] BRING THAT BACK TO YOUR MEMORY. COME ON
[54:09] [screaming] NOW. SO, YOU CAN'T EXPECT
[54:11] RESULTS WITHOUT EATING ON SOMETHING. BUT
[54:14] AS YOU EAT ON THE WORD OF THE LORD, WE
[54:17] REST IN THE WORD OF THE LORD. AND THEN
[54:19] GOD IS DUTY BOUND TO BACK UP THE WORD OF
[54:22] THE LORD. CUZ SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO
[54:25] CHANGE OUR DIET, CHANGE WHAT WE'RE
[54:26] THINKING ON, CHANGE WHAT WE'RE WATCHING,
[54:28] CHANGE WHAT WE'RE LISTENING TO, CHANGE
[54:31] WHO WE'RE FELLOWSHIPPING WITH. AND AS
[54:33] WE'RE DOING THOSE THINGS, WE'RE TASTING
[54:36] THE HEAVENLY THINGS OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AND
[54:39] WE'RE EATING ON SPIRITUAL FOOD IN DUE
[54:42] SEASON. OH, BROTHER BRANDON would say,
[54:44] "THIS IS THE SEASON FOR THIS FOOD." SO
[54:47] THE STORED UP FOOD, BROTHER BRANDON
[54:49] WOULD TELL US THAT that the Lord would
[54:50] tell him to store up food, right? and he
[54:52] to MAKE TAPES. BUT THAT FOOD WASN'T FOR
[54:54] TOMORROW. THIS IS THE SEASON FOR THE
[54:57] FOOD. THERE'S NOT ANOTHER CHURCH AGE
[54:59] COMING. THERE'S NOT ANOTHER CHURCH AGE
[55:01] MESSENGER COMING. BUT THE STORED UP FOOD
[55:04] THAT GOD GAVE US IS FOR THIS SEASON IN
[55:07] TIME TO FIX MARRIAGES, TO HELP CHILDREN,
[55:10] TO GIVE REVIVAL IN A HOME, IN A CHURCH,
[55:14] IF YOU'RE WILLING TO BE SATISFIED WITH
[55:16] IT. HALLELUJAH. AND I SAY I'M SATISFIED
[55:20] WITH IT. BROTHER BROWN, I'M GOING TO SAY
[55:22] this here in the message. Spiritual food
[55:24] in due season. But thanks be to God.
[55:26] We've got hidden food, spiritual food
[55:29] that we're living on. The goodness and
[55:32] mercy of the revelation of Jesus Christ
[55:36] in these last days. WHAT ARE WE LIVING
[55:38] ON, BROTHER JOSH? THE revelation of
[55:40] Jesus Christ.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Not just an imagination, but it's a
[55:45] reality of who he really is. And and I
[55:48] believe that that THE BRIDE IS SATISFIED
[55:50] WITH IT. AND THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US in
[55:52] Psalms 37 and 19, they shall not be
[55:56] ashamed in the evil time, in the days of
[55:59] the famine, they shall be satisfied. And
[56:03] so as a as we're moving on now, you
[56:06] know, Brother Brandon would say this
[56:07] here and here we are privileged tonight
[56:10] to see the message of God, the angel of
[56:13] God. And I and I love that quote because
[56:15] he's talking about how the world is in a
[56:18] famine. He's talking about how they're
[56:20] going to and fro seeking. He would say
[56:22] the true word of the Lord. And and it's
[56:25] incredible because brother Brandon would
[56:27] say in one place that that uh he would
[56:30] say that there's many truths out there,
[56:32] BUT HE SAYS JESUS is the true heavenly
[56:36] born truth. So there's many truths out
[56:39] there. And and and I heard a story one
[56:41] time on how that the the greatest
[56:43] robbery, the greatest train robbery that
[56:46] ever happened was by a false light.
[56:49] Y'all have heard that BEFORE THAT THE
[56:50] GREATEST ROBBERY THE TRAIN ROBBERY WAS
[56:53] BY SOMETHING THAT LOOKED genuine but it
[56:55] was false. And and you see brother
[56:57] Brandham says there's truths out there
[57:00] but there's only one HEAVENLY BORN TRUTH
[57:02] THAT IS JESUS CHRIST WHICH is Ruth the
[57:05] word right? heavens and earth WILL PASS
[57:07] AWAY, BUT MY WORD WILL NEVER FAIL. SO,
[57:10] THERE'S MANY TRUTHS OUT THERE THAT WE
[57:12] CAN EAT OF, but I don't WANT JUST THE
[57:15] TRUTH. I WANT HEAVENLY BORN TRUTH. YOU
[57:17] SEE, BECAUSE WE CAN WE WE CAN PARTAKE OF
[57:20] TRUTHS, BUT WHAT DOES GOD THINKING ABOUT
[57:22] IT? RIGHT? We're living in a day that
[57:25] that we can do what WE WANT. THAT'S
[57:27] TRUE. BUT WHAT DOES GOD say about it?
[57:29] Right?
[57:30] Like I was saying earlier about
[57:32] complexes, you know, and complexes can
[57:34] point out truths, right? You're too shy,
[57:37] you're too this, you're too that, WHICH
[57:38] CAN BE A TRUTH. BUT WHAT IS THE HEAVENLY
[57:41] BORN TRUTH SAYING? WE DON'T WANT TO GET
[57:43] WRAPPED UP IN JUST ANYTHING THE DEVIL
[57:46] THROWS AT US. BUT I WANT TO PARTAKE OF
[57:49] THE HEAVENLYORN TRUTH. You see here,
[57:51] brother Brandham, in the quote I I had
[57:53] just read, he would say that that while
[57:55] they're looking for the true word of
[57:57] God, he says, "Here we are privileged
[57:59] tonight to see the message of God, the
[58:03] angel of God." And and it's incredible
[58:05] because we would know what that word see
[58:08] means. It means to understand, right? He
[58:10] God Jesus would tell who was it? Uh
[58:13] Nicodemus I would think unless you're
[58:15] born again, you cannot see the kingdom
[58:17] of God. And brother Brandham must say
[58:18] the word see means to understand. So
[58:21] here we are privileged. Well the world
[58:24] is looking for the true word OF GOD.
[58:26] WE'RE PRIVILEGED TO UNDERSTAND THE WORD
[58:29] OF GOD. SO WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT IT.
[58:32] WE'RE UNDERSTANDING IT. THAT'S WHAT I
[58:34] LOVE ABOUT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS
[58:36] IT'S A YOUNG PERSON THAT CAN UNDERSTAND
[58:38] THESE THINGS. YOU MIGHT NOT BE BE ABLE
[58:40] TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER, BUT YOU CAN
[58:42] UNDERSTAND WHAT GOD IS DOING in this
[58:45] generation. YOU KNOW, AND IT'S
[58:47] incredible to think that that even if
[58:49] this message was false, we're living a
[58:51] great life, RIGHT? AIN'T THAT POWERFUL
[58:54] THAT THAT EVEN IF BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS A
[58:56] FALSE PROPHET, EVEN IF this message is
[58:58] from the PITS OF HELL, WHY BOTHER US IF
[59:01] WE'RE LIVING A GOOD LIFE, RIGHT? I'M not
[59:03] a drunk, I'm not an alcoholic, I'm not
[59:06] out cheating on my wife, I'M NOT, YOU
[59:08] KNOW, DOING THESE THINGS. SO EVEN IF IT
[59:10] IS FALSE, IT'S PRODUCING SOMETHING IN
[59:12] ME. IT'S A HEAVENLY BORN TRUTH THAT WE
[59:16] CAN PARTAKE OF AND EXPECT RESULTS IN OUR
[59:20] LIFE. AND I BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE HAS
[59:22] RESULTS. IT AIN'T JUST SOMETHING THE
[59:24] MESSAGE IS GOING to produce a rapture.
[59:26] And I believe it's GOING TO DO THAT. BUT
[59:28] I BELIEVE IT CAN CHANGE US DAY BY DAY.
[59:30] IF THERE'S THINGS WE'RE NOT HAPPY WITH,
[59:32] I BELIEVE THE WORD CAN CHANGE US. IF
[59:35] THERE'S THINGS WE WANT TO GET RID OF, I
[59:37] BELIEVE WE CAN FEAST UPON THE WORD OF
[59:39] THE LORD, GIVE IT TO GOD, AND WATCH GOD
[59:42] COME ON THE SCENE AND CHANGE SITUATIONS
[59:45] AND AND CHANGE LIVES AND AND BRING A
[59:47] FIRE ON THE INSIDE OF PEOPLE, INSIDE OF
[59:50] CHILDREN, INSIDE OF HOMES. AND I BELIEVE
[59:53] THAT THAT THE WORD OF THE LORD, IT CAN
[59:55] BRING RESULTS. AND it's incredible
[59:58] because we're not looking for something,
[1:00:01] BUT WE'RE SATISFIED WITH WHAT GOD HAS
[1:00:03] GIVEN US. AND it's incredible because
[1:00:06] brother Brandham, he would tell us in
[1:00:08] the message ashamed, he would say, I
[1:00:10] want to take a little text from there.
[1:00:12] If if it'll be called that, called
[1:00:14] ashamed. You know, I like that.
[1:00:16] Whosoever is ashamed of me and of my
[1:00:19] words, I'll be ashamed of him. Now, the
[1:00:21] word ashamed could be translated
[1:00:24] embarrassed. He says, you know
[1:00:26] something, you're faced with something
[1:00:28] that you're embarrassed about being
[1:00:29] ashamed. He says, "Then another thing
[1:00:32] about being ashamed does, it shows
[1:00:34] you're not you're not sure of what
[1:00:36] you're talking about. If you don't know
[1:00:38] what you're talking about and have the
[1:00:40] assurance that you know what you're
[1:00:42] talking about, you can't tell anybody."
[1:00:45] He says, he says, "You can't tell
[1:00:47] anybody. If you have the assurance, you
[1:00:49] can tell anybody because you're not
[1:00:52] ashamed." And so being ashamed is to be
[1:00:55] embarrassed. And and we're living in a
[1:00:58] time, as I mentioned last time, we're
[1:01:00] living in the most deceitful age. And
[1:01:01] brother Brandham, he would tell us that.
[1:01:03] And and I mentioned last time how that
[1:01:06] it's hard to believe what's true
[1:01:07] anymore. You know, what what's AI or or
[1:01:10] what's genuine and and and I believe
[1:01:13] that that that is a design of the devil
[1:01:16] to take away the assurance of the word
[1:01:18] of the Lord. Right? because you know and
[1:01:20] and I've been even saying like pictures
[1:01:22] of pictures of uh uh like brother
[1:01:24] Brandham on social media and you can
[1:01:26] tell it's an AI picture you know it's
[1:01:28] too clear and and but but what's
[1:01:30] incredible is the message came before AI
[1:01:34] right so before the devil can scruple
[1:01:37] things up God already so when brother
[1:01:40] Brandham would tell us before you can
[1:01:41] have a counterfeit there has to be a
[1:01:43] genuine
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; is that right you you and I mentioned it
[1:01:47] before you've never seen a counterfeit
[1:01:49] fit $7 bill. Has anybody ever seen a
[1:01:52] counterfeit $7 bill? How come there's
[1:01:54] not a genuine out there? Right. But
[1:01:56] there's there's counterfeit dollar
[1:01:58] bills, $5 bills, $10 bills, $100 bills
[1:02:01] is because there's a genuine out there.
[1:02:04] So if this is the most deceitful age and
[1:02:06] there's lies that is graping grasping
[1:02:09] the hearts OF THE PEOPLE, THERE'S GOT TO
[1:02:11] BE A GENUINE OUT THERE. THERE'S GOT TO
[1:02:13] BE A HEAVENLY BORN TRUTH THAT CAN ALSO
[1:02:17] GRAB A HOLD OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND PRODUCE
[1:02:21] THAT LIFE. AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT if
[1:02:24] the devil could ever get us to lose the
[1:02:26] assurance of the word of the Lord, he's
[1:02:29] got us whipped. And brother Brandham, he
[1:02:30] would tell us that whenever Jesus Jesus
[1:02:33] was upon the earth that the preachers
[1:02:35] were jealous of him. And he would say
[1:02:37] that and they were trying to destroy the
[1:02:39] influence of Jesus. And he says, "So is
[1:02:41] it today." They're trying to destroy the
[1:02:44] influence of this message before the
[1:02:47] people. He says, "IF THEY CAN DO THAT,
[1:02:49] they've got this whole thing whipped."
[1:02:51] SO THE DEVIL IS OUT WITH with this mo
[1:02:54] most deceitful age to destroy the
[1:02:57] assurance or the influence of the word
[1:03:00] of the Lord THAT WHENEVER YOU HEAR A
[1:03:03] WORD OR HEAR A MESSAGE preached across
[1:03:05] the PULLPIT OR OR HEAR YOUR PASTOR
[1:03:07] PREACHING THE WORD AND THE AND THE
[1:03:09] PROMISES OF GOD AND YOU HEAR IT, BUT if
[1:03:12] you've lost the ASSURANCE OF IT, YOU'RE
[1:03:14] NEVER GOING TO STAND UPON IT. AND THAT'S
[1:03:17] WHAT THE DEVIL WANTS TO DO. He wants YOU
[1:03:19] TO AMEN THE WORD. He He's okay WITH YOU
[1:03:21] QUOTING THE WORD, BUT HE DON'T WANT YOU
[1:03:23] TO HAVE THE ASSURANCE OF THE WORD OF THE
[1:03:26] LORD. AND WHAT THE DEVIL WANTS TO MAKE
[1:03:28] US be is LIKE A BUNCH OF CATHOLICS. You
[1:03:31] know that only the priest can understand
[1:03:33] the word. ONLY THE PRIEST CAN HAVE A A
[1:03:35] REVELATION of the word. And and you
[1:03:37] remember how that started, right? That
[1:03:38] the the Bible was only in a certain
[1:03:40] language, right? And and that that's why
[1:03:43] many of the of the the old uh the old
[1:03:45] patriarchs and the the the Protestants
[1:03:47] they were they were burnt to the stake
[1:03:49] was because they were trying to bring
[1:03:51] the Bible into an English language,
[1:03:54] right? Y'all remember that? BECAUSE THAT
[1:03:56] WAS BY DESIGN OF THE DEVIL TO keep the
[1:03:59] word from the people and just keep it TO
[1:04:02] A HOLY MAN. SO INSTEAD OF HIM TRYING TO
[1:04:05] DESTROY THE BIBLE OR DESTROY THE
[1:04:07] MESSAGE, he tries to destroy the
[1:04:09] influence of it. He can't KEEP IT FROM
[1:04:12] YOU, BUT HE WANTS TO DESTROY THE
[1:04:14] ASSURANCE OF IT WHERE IT'S BACK TO JUST
[1:04:16] A HOLY MAN BELIEVING IT. BUT I BELIEVE
[1:04:19] IT'S MORE FOR IT'S IT'S NOT JUST FOR A
[1:04:21] PREACHER, NOT JUST FOR A SONG LEADER,
[1:04:23] BUT IT'S FOR LEOTY THAT CAN HAVE THE
[1:04:26] ASSURANCE OF THE WORD OF THE LORD. AND
[1:04:29] IN EVERY SITUATION, YOU'RE UNASHAMED TO
[1:04:32] SPEAK THE WORD BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE
[1:04:35] ASSURANCE OF THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:04:38] HEAVENS AND EARTH MAY PASS AWAY THAT
[1:04:41] THIS WORD THAT I'M CONFESSING IS NEVER
[1:04:43] GOING TO FAIL.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH MY. I THINK IF we ever
[1:04:48] get a get a revelation of that, it would
[1:04:51] change our confession cuz we we I I
[1:04:54] believe that people fail to realize the
[1:04:56] importance of your confession. Brother
[1:04:59] Brandon, he would tell us in many
[1:05:00] places. He says, "God can never do
[1:05:03] anything for you until you confess it."
[1:05:05] He says, "You got to receive it, believe
[1:05:07] it, THEN CONFESS IT." AND AND THAT'S
[1:05:10] SOMETHING MANY TIMES THAT IT'S hard to
[1:05:12] do that, ain't it? We're living in A
[1:05:14] NEGATIVE WORLD. HOW MANY KNOWS WHAT I'M
[1:05:16] TALKING ABOUT? You you you can't even go
[1:05:18] to the store and you can ask the clerk,
[1:05:20] "HOW YOU DOING? OH, IT'S BEEN A BAD
[1:05:22] DAY." You know, UH THIS WENT WRONG, THAT
[1:05:24] WENT WRONG. WHAT IS IT? IT'S A NEGATIVE
[1:05:25] WORLD. And and it's easy to come under
[1:05:28] the gloom and under the clouds. Brother
[1:05:31] Brandon must say it's an erotic age,
[1:05:32] right? It's the greatest battle ever
[1:05:34] fought and a trap in the mind. And
[1:05:37] that's WHERE THE DEVIL'S FIGHTING. And
[1:05:39] it's easy to get beat down by the clouds
[1:05:41] OF DEPRESSION, THE CLOUDS of negativity
[1:05:45] that we're looking at the word of the
[1:05:46] Lord instead of through the through the
[1:05:48] filter of faith. We're looking at the
[1:05:50] word of the Lord through the filter of
[1:05:52] negativity. Looking at the word that,
[1:05:55] you know, it can't do this, it can't do
[1:05:57] that. But no matter how negative we may
[1:06:00] get, the word is still positive. THAT'S
[1:06:02] WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT IS UNBELIEF don't
[1:06:05] hinder God, IT HINDERS YOU. NEGATIVITY
[1:06:07] DON'T HINDER THE WORD, IT HINDERS YOU.
[1:06:10] So instead of instead OF LOOKING THROUGH
[1:06:12] THE EYES OF NEGATIVITY, I say we can put
[1:06:15] on THE LENSES OF FAITH IN THE WORD OF
[1:06:18] GOD AND WATCH GOD COME ON THE SCENE. YOU
[1:06:22] KNOW WHAT'S INCREDIBLE, brother Brandon?
[1:06:23] He would preach a message called Why
[1:06:25] Christ? And he that's a powerful
[1:06:27] message. And I was listening to it on
[1:06:30] the way here and and I believe that many
[1:06:32] times our perception is negative
[1:06:36] which influences our speech right and
[1:06:39] and it's incredible because brother
[1:06:40] Brandham he would talk about Moses and
[1:06:42] would say Moses he chose to go with it.
[1:06:45] Why his faith he saw the promise he saw
[1:06:49] the end time he saw over in tomorrow and
[1:06:53] let his faith loose. Ain't that
[1:06:56] powerful? Brother Brandon was said that
[1:06:58] that Pharaoh would look out a window and
[1:07:00] would see mudbers, right? Moses looked
[1:07:02] out the same the same window and seen
[1:07:05] the promise. YOU SEE WHAT WAS IT? The
[1:07:07] perception was different. One perception
[1:07:10] was negative. The other PERCEPTION WAS
[1:07:12] POSITIVE BY THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:07:15] AND AND MANY TIMES we get into the
[1:07:17] trenches, we get into a battle, we get
[1:07:20] into a hard time. And all we see is
[1:07:22] present. All we see is the troubles. All
[1:07:24] we see is the hard times. Brother
[1:07:26] Brandham says, "Moses, look into
[1:07:28] tomorrow." [laughter] HALLELUJAH. HE
[1:07:30] MIGHT NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS GOING TO
[1:07:32] HAPPEN, BUT he was looking at THE
[1:07:34] PROMISE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. And brother
[1:07:36] Brandham would say in that message, he
[1:07:38] would say, "Moses didn't pay no
[1:07:40] attention to what he saw." And he says,
[1:07:42] "Only if people can do that today. Don't
[1:07:45] pay any attention to what you see. ONLY
[1:07:48] LOOK TO WHAT GOD SAYS." AND IT'S
[1:07:51] INCREDIBLE THAT THAT can become a
[1:07:53] reality THAT OUR PERCEPTION CAN BE A
[1:07:57] POSITIVE PERCEPTION, RIGHT? BECAUSE a
[1:08:00] man don't have to change for you to
[1:08:02] think different of him, right? And and I
[1:08:04] think I've used the example here before
[1:08:07] that that somebody can spread a lie
[1:08:09] about somebody and and though that lie
[1:08:11] not be true, you can look at somebody
[1:08:14] different because their influence has
[1:08:16] been marred, right? you know uh you know
[1:08:19] I say I you know say I come to you and I
[1:08:22] say you know brother John he has a
[1:08:23] second wife in a different country this
[1:08:25] here's happening that's happening and
[1:08:27] some may say that's not true but people
[1:08:30] that might not know him well that might
[1:08:32] mar his influence to him and even though
[1:08:35] even though he SAYS THAT'S NOT TRUE
[1:08:36] that's a lie but somebody that don't
[1:08:38] know him too very well it can change the
[1:08:41] way that people see him and that can
[1:08:44] happen with the word of the Lord that
[1:08:46] the word of the Lord are still true. It
[1:08:48] still HAS THE POWER TO HEAL, THE POWER
[1:08:50] TO TO DELIVER AND FILL WITH THE HOLY
[1:08:52] GHOST. But if the devil can give you a
[1:08:54] false conception of it, it can change
[1:08:57] the way you see the word of the LORD AND
[1:09:00] INSTEAD OF LOOKING TO THE PROMISES OF
[1:09:02] GOD, you're looking to the to the
[1:09:05] situations that you're walking through.
[1:09:07] And and it's incredible that that our
[1:09:10] confession can be a word-based
[1:09:12] confession. And and you you you can
[1:09:14] remember that whenever whenever Jesus he
[1:09:16] would open up the the the eyes of the
[1:09:18] blind man and and the Bible says the
[1:09:21] Jews would go to them would would come
[1:09:23] to him would say how did you get your
[1:09:24] sight and he would say that that the man
[1:09:26] come open my eyes and they would go to
[1:09:28] his parents and would say is this your
[1:09:30] son that was blind and and the parents
[1:09:32] would say yep that's my son and they
[1:09:34] would ask them how is it that he got HIS
[1:09:37] SIGHT AND WHAT WOULD THEY SAY ask him
[1:09:39] he's of age he can speak for himself
[1:09:42] I love that. They were ashamed TO SAY
[1:09:44] IT, BUT HE WAS OF AGE. OH, [screaming]
[1:09:48] HALLELUJAH. AND I BELIEVE THE BRIDE HAS
[1:09:50] COME TO A MATURITY. She's been ripening
[1:09:53] UNDER THE WORD THAT SHE'S EATING AND
[1:09:55] SHE'S BECOMING the word. And then she's
[1:09:58] NOT ASHAMED TO SPEAK OF THE WORD.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE WOULD SAY THAT
[1:10:03] THAT the the the that the Jews would
[1:10:05] come back to this man and would see how
[1:10:07] is it you got your sight in. AND IT'S
[1:10:09] INCREDIBLE because this man looked at
[1:10:11] him and said, "I've already told you. If
[1:10:13] I tell you again, will you believe on
[1:10:14] him also? Will you worship him?" THEY
[1:10:17] SAID, "HE'S A SINNER. He's done this.
[1:10:19] He's done that." He stops and he starts
[1:10:21] preaching on a sermon. HE SAYS, "I DON'T
[1:10:23] KNOW IF HE'S A SINNER OR NOT. I DON'T
[1:10:25] KNOW. ALL [screaming] I KNOW IS I WAS
[1:10:27] BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE HIM. ALL I KNOW IS
[1:10:31] THERE WAS AN INFLUENCE. THERE WAS AN
[1:10:33] ASSURANCE. THERE WAS AN ANOINTING BEHIND
[1:10:36] THAT WORD THAT COULD CHANGE MY LIFE. AND
[1:10:39] I'M NOT ASHAMED TO SPEAK OF IT.
[1:10:42] HALLELUJAH. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE because
[1:10:45] he would begin to preach to it. In John
[1:10:47] 9 and 30, the man answered and SAID UNTO
[1:10:50] THEM, WHY HEREIN IS A MARVELOUS THING
[1:10:53] THAT YE KNOW NOT FROM WHICH he is? And
[1:10:56] yet he OPENED MY EYES. NOW WE KNOW THAT
[1:10:58] GOD heareth not sinners. But if any man
[1:11:01] be a worshipper OF GOD, AND DOETH HIS
[1:11:04] WILL, HIM he heareth? SINCE THE WORLD
[1:11:07] BEGAN, WAS IT NOT HEARD THAT ANY MAN
[1:11:10] OPEN THE EYES OF ONE THAT WAS BORN
[1:11:12] BLIND? IF THIS MAN WAS NOT OF GOD, HE
[1:11:15] COULD DO NOTHING. He's preaching to him
[1:11:17] in the next verse, JOHN 9:34. AND THEY
[1:11:21] ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO HIM, "THOU WAS
[1:11:23] ALLTOGETHER BORN IN SIN, AND DUST THOU
[1:11:26] TEACH US?" AND THEY CAST HIM OUT. AIN'T
[1:11:29] THAT POWERFUL [laughter] THAT HERE he
[1:11:30] was STANDING FOR THE PRESENT WORD AND
[1:11:33] THEY WHERE HE WAS CAST out of the
[1:11:35] church. But you know what would happen?
[1:11:37] That's not the end of THE STORY. THE
[1:11:38] BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT WHEN JESUS
[1:11:41] HEARD HOW THEY CAST HIM OUT, THE BIBLE
[1:11:43] SAYS JESUS WENT LOOKING FOR HIM.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; OH, [screaming] HALLELUJAH. SO WHILE HE
[1:11:48] WAS PUSHED OUT OF ONE CIRCLE, CHRIST
[1:11:51] COME LOOKING FOR HIM. AND SOMETIMES WHEN
[1:11:54] YOU'RE TAKING A STAND FOR THE WORD OF
[1:11:56] THE LORD, FRIENDS MIGHT PUSH YOU AWAY,
[1:11:59] FAMILY MEMBERS MIGHT PUSH YOU AWAY, BUT
[1:12:01] DON'T WORRY, THE ONE THAT GAVE THE WORD
[1:12:04] IS COMING TO LOOK FOR YOU TO GIVE YOU A
[1:12:06] WARM EMBRACE. HALLELUJAH. AND IT'S
[1:12:09] INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THIS MAN DIDN'T EVEN
[1:12:12] know who Jesus was. HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
[1:12:14] HIS NAME. ALL HE KNEW WAS THAT MAN
[1:12:17] CHANGED MY LIFE. BUT WHEN JESUS COME TO
[1:12:20] HIM, HE WOULD SAY, "YOU come and worship
[1:12:22] me in these things." AND AND HE SAYS,
[1:12:24] "WHO IS THE LORD?" AND WHO IS THIS? HE
[1:12:26] SAYS, "I AM HE." AND THE MAN FELL DOWN
[1:12:29] AND WORSHIPED HIM. WHAT WAS IT? WELL, HE
[1:12:32] WAS CAST OUT OF ONE PLACE. GOD COME
[1:12:35] LOOKING FOR HIM. HALLELUJAH. WE MIGHT
[1:12:37] NOT FIT IN MANY PLACES. YOU MIGHT NOT
[1:12:40] FIT IN IN MANY PLACES, BUT THERE'S ONE
[1:12:42] PLACE YOU DO FIT IN WITH, AND THAT'S THE
[1:12:45] WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AND IT IS A FRIEND
[1:12:48] THAT STICKETH CLOSER THAN A BROTHER. YOU
[1:12:51] MIGHT FEEL LIKE YOUR WORLD IS UPSIDE
[1:12:53] DOWN, THAT IS FALLING APART, THAT YOU'RE
[1:12:55] ALL STANDING ALL ALONE. BUT THERE IS
[1:12:58] STILL A WORD THAT HAS AN ANOINTING THAT
[1:13:01] CAN COME AND GIVE ENCOURAGEMENT. HE'S
[1:13:03] STILL EL SHADI, THE STRENGTH GIVER. HE
[1:13:06] IS STILL JEHOVAH GYRA, OUR PROVIDER.
[1:13:09] IT'S SOMEBODY THAT IS A REALITY IN OUR
[1:13:12] LIVES. HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE THIS WORD
[1:13:16] UH HAS A REALITY BEHIND IT THAT CAN
[1:13:18] TRANSFORM SITUATIONS.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE SAME WORD THAT WOULD BRUTE
[1:13:24] OVER THE earth in THE BEGINNING WHENEVER
[1:13:26] GOD WOULD SAY LET THERE BE LIGHT AND
[1:13:28] SOMETIMES we get discouraged by time.
[1:13:31] Sometimes we don't see how we don't see
[1:13:33] situations changing and we start to fall
[1:13:35] apart. But you know but the Brandon says
[1:13:38] that whenever God said that there'll be
[1:13:39] light. There may have been billions and
[1:13:41] billions of years, BUT HE SAYS HE SAID
[1:13:44] IT, SO IT HAD TO [laughter] HAPPEN.
[1:13:46] SOMETIMES WE GET DISCOURAGED BY THE
[1:13:48] PROMISES OF GOD BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SEEING
[1:13:51] ANY CHANGE. BUT I SAY JUST REST ASSURED,
[1:13:54] REST ASSURED THAT WHATEVER WORD HE
[1:13:57] PROMISED, IT CANNOT RETURN UNTO HIM
[1:14:00] VOID. AND THE WORD WOULD BROOD over the
[1:14:03] earth. AND BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY
[1:14:05] THAT that it brought CHA BROUGHT ORDER
[1:14:07] OUT OF CHAOS. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE
[1:14:09] word of the Lord is still bringing order
[1:14:12] IN OUR CHAOS. YOU MIGHT FEEL LIKE YOUR
[1:14:14] WORLD IS FALLING APART, BUT THE SAME
[1:14:17] WORD THAT WOULD BROOD OVER THE EARTH can
[1:14:19] brute over SOME MORE EARTH. WHAT ARE
[1:14:21] YOU? YOU'RE AN EARTHN VESSEL, RIGHT?
[1:14:23] YOU'RE MADE OF THE EARTH, BUT YET THE
[1:14:25] SAME WORD THAT BROUGHT ORDER CAN BRING
[1:14:28] ORDER IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR BACK'S AGAINST
[1:14:31] THE WALL, BUT THAT SAME WORD CAN BROOD
[1:14:34] OVER YOUR HEART.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND IT CAN
[1:14:39] ACCEPT US IN. OH MY. THAT'S THAT'S
[1:14:42] WHAT'S SO INCREDIBLE is this man didn't
[1:14:44] go looking for Jesus. Jesus came looking
[1:14:46] for him.
[1:14:48] HALLELUJAH. AND SOMETIMES WE FEEL LIKE I
[1:14:52] CAN'T EVEN FIND GOD. WHERE IS HE? I'VE
[1:14:54] LOST HIM. I CAN'T EVEN I DON'T EVEN
[1:14:56] KNOW. LIKE IT WAS JOB THAT WOULD SAY IF
[1:14:58] I KNEW WHERE HE WAS, I WOULD GO AND TALK
[1:14:59] TO HIM. I WOULD KNOCK ON HIS DOOR. HE
[1:15:02] DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS. BUT ON HIS
[1:15:04] DEEPEST OF THE THE THE THE DEEPEST OF
[1:15:06] THE TRIAL HE WAS IN, THERE WOULD BECOME
[1:15:09] A THUNDER THAT WOULD BEGIN TO ROAR. AND
[1:15:11] EVERYBODY ELSE HEARD THUNDER. BUT JOB
[1:15:14] HEARD A VOICE SAYING, "WHERE WAS YOU,
[1:15:16] JOB?" IN OTHER WORDS, BEFORE THIS
[1:15:19] PRESENT CONDITION, YOU WAS WITH ME.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND AFTER THIS PRESENT
[1:15:24] CONDITION, YOU'RE GOING TO BE WITH ME.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE FEEL LIKE WE DON'T KNOW
[1:15:29] WHERE GOD IS. BUT LET ME JUST SAY THIS
[1:15:31] HERE. START FEEDING UPON THE WORD OF THE
[1:15:34] LORD. START [screaming] MEDITATING UPON
[1:15:36] THE WORD OF THE LORD. UH AND WATCH THE
[1:15:38] SPIRIT OF GOD. DROP DOWN IN A HOME.
[1:15:42] HALLELUJAH. DROP DOWN IN A VEHICLE. DROP
[1:15:44] DOWN IN A IN A BEDROOM WHERE YOU FEEL
[1:15:47] LIKE NOBODY HEARS YOU AND WATCH GOD COME
[1:15:50] ON THE SCENE. HALLELUJAH. OH, I KNOW
[1:15:53] WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I'M NOT JUST
[1:15:55] PREACHING SOMETHING. I'M LETTING YOU
[1:15:57] KNOW THERE'S A REALITY BEHIND THIS WORD
[1:16:00] THAT IS A FRIEND THAT CAN BE THERE IN
[1:16:03] THE LONELIEST OF TRIALS.
[1:16:06] HALLELUJAH. The loneliest of times, but
[1:16:09] we got to make sure we're dwelling upon
[1:16:11] him. You see, that's a hard time is
[1:16:13] getting our perception back positive.
[1:16:16] Oh, hallelujah. to get our perception
[1:16:18] from the negativity to the positive and
[1:16:21] and getting our confession from being
[1:16:23] negative things to positive things and
[1:16:26] and it's hard because we're living in a
[1:16:29] negative world and and and negativity
[1:16:31] has a voice. You know that brother
[1:16:34] Brandham says but faith has a voice and
[1:16:37] he says faith's voice is positive. Oh my
[1:16:40] brother Brandham is saying this here but
[1:16:42] if you only if you just rely on hope you
[1:16:44] hinder faith. Now, hope looks for
[1:16:46] something way off. But faith claims a
[1:16:49] right now. See, faith says God said so
[1:16:52] and it's mine that settles it. See, I
[1:16:54] don't care if I'm still crippled, if I'm
[1:16:56] still blind, if I'm still sick. That has
[1:16:59] nothing to do with it. I believe it
[1:17:02] anyhow. It's mine right now. GOD SAID
[1:17:05] SO. That settles it. See? And he says
[1:17:07] that's faith. But hope says God said so.
[1:17:11] I'm expecting it someday. You see, I'm
[1:17:14] expecting it someday. And as long as
[1:17:16] SATAN CAN PUT YOU OFF TO ANOTHER DAY,
[1:17:19] that's just as good as he wants. That's
[1:17:21] right. You'll never get it. JUST BELIEVE
[1:17:24] THAT YOU'VE GOT IT NOW. HE SAYS IT'S
[1:17:26] YOUR personal property. Faith is the
[1:17:29] substance of things hoped for. The
[1:17:31] evidence of things not seen is not
[1:17:33] right. FAITH ACTS NOW. IT'S POSITIVE. HE
[1:17:37] SAYS, "OH MY, I TELL YOU, SICKNESS,
[1:17:39] everything else when faith steps in,
[1:17:41] IT'S LIKE A SNOWBALL ON A hot stove. It
[1:17:44] just melts away. Everything goes away
[1:17:46] from faith cuz faith stands up and takes
[1:17:49] over rule. When faith speaks, EVERYTHING
[1:17:53] ELSE KEEPS STILL." THAT'S RIGHT. SO
[1:17:56] FAITH HAS A VOICE. DOUBT HAS A VOICE.
[1:17:59] FAITH'S GOING TO SPEAK POSITIVE. DOUBT
[1:18:02] IS GOING TO speak negativity. Oh, but I
[1:18:04] said, let faith speak through our lives.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; It was be the Apostle Paul that would
[1:18:10] say this here. Uh uh uh he he 10:23, let
[1:18:15] us hold fast the profession or brother
[1:18:17] Brandon said that's confession or the
[1:18:19] confession of our faith. SO HOLD FAST
[1:18:23] THE CONFESSION OF OUR FAITH. And it's
[1:18:26] incredible because brother Brandon and
[1:18:28] there's many quotes he he would talk
[1:18:30] about how faith is positive and how the
[1:18:32] symptoms can't even speak at all when
[1:18:35] godly faith speaks. AND THAT'S
[1:18:37] INCREDIBLE BECAUSE WE ALL GET SYMPTOMS,
[1:18:39] don't we? Brother Brandman, he he would
[1:18:42] preach about Jonah and would say
[1:18:44] sometimes you feel like you're you're
[1:18:45] going through hard times and you're
[1:18:47] going through symptoms. He says none of
[1:18:49] us have symptoms like Jonah had. Right?
[1:18:52] He would say Jonah was in the belly of
[1:18:54] the well. He looked over there was
[1:18:56] Wells's belly. HE LOOKED OVER HERE,
[1:18:57] WELLS BELLY, seaweed wrapped around his
[1:19:00] neck and and that was a bad situation,
[1:19:02] wasn't it? Could you imagine? And what's
[1:19:04] incredible is Jonah was running from the
[1:19:07] presence of God.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Right. And here you think condemnation
[1:19:12] would have been beating us hard, beating
[1:19:13] us hard, beating us hard. But yet Jonah
[1:19:16] would look at those vanities and even
[1:19:18] though those vanities had negative
[1:19:20] voices, you know what he would say?
[1:19:22] These are lying vanities.
[1:19:25] Oh my. They may have been true, but they
[1:19:28] weren't heavenly born truth. YOUR
[1:19:30] SITUATIONS MIGHT BE TRUE, BUT THEY'RE
[1:19:32] NOT HEAVENLY BORN TRUTH. IT WASN'T SO
[1:19:35] FROM the beginning. And you know what
[1:19:37] Job WOULD DO OR JONAH WOULD do in Jonah
[1:19:40] 2:9, "But I will sacrifice unto thee
[1:19:43] with the voice of thanksgiving." So, you
[1:19:46] know what Jonah done? And he's teaching
[1:19:47] us how to do the same thing. He looked
[1:19:50] at the vanities. He looked at the
[1:19:52] situation and he would begin TO DROWN
[1:19:54] THEM OUT WITH THIS PRAISE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:58] AND YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? YOU
[1:19:59] KNOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM, THE THE BIBLE
[1:20:02] TELL US THAT SOLOMON WHEN HE WAS
[1:20:03] DEDICATING THE TEMPLE, y'all remember
[1:20:05] that would say, "If there's ANY MAN
[1:20:07] THAT'S EVER IN NEED OF HELP, may he look
[1:20:09] towards this temple, right? And Lord,
[1:20:11] may you save him." And so HERE JONAH
[1:20:13] WOULD LOOK ONCE MORE TOWARD THAT TEMPLE.
[1:20:16] AND YOU WOULD THINK ABOUT IT. HE'S IN
[1:20:17] THE BELLY OF A WHALE UNDER THE OCEAN.
[1:20:20] SEAWEED WRAPPED AROUND HIS NECK. HE
[1:20:22] DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY HE'S AT, WHICH
[1:20:24] DIRECTION HE'S GOING. BUT YOU KNOW, HE
[1:20:26] WOULD LOOK towards the temple. You know,
[1:20:28] brother Brandon would tell us it WAS
[1:20:29] INSPIRATION.
[1:20:31] IT WAS INSPIRATION THAT WOULD TURN HIM
[1:20:34] TO the direction towards the promise of
[1:20:36] God. BUT YOU KNOW HOW inspiration came?
[1:20:40] When he looked at the vanities and says
[1:20:42] they were lies.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; COME [screaming] ON NOW. AND AS HE G AS
[1:20:46] HE AS HE TURNED AWAY FROM THE SYMPTOMS
[1:20:49] AND STARTED TO PRAISE GOD, THEN THE
[1:20:52] SITUATION could change. THEN INSPIRATION
[1:20:56] COULD STRIKE THE HEART AND POINT HIM
[1:20:58] THROUGH the right direction of his
[1:21:00] answer. You want to get an ANSWER FROM
[1:21:02] GOD, DO AWAY WITH THE NEGATIVITY. START
[1:21:06] WORSHIPING GOD. START DWELLING ON
[1:21:08] POSITIVE THINGS AND WATCH INSPIRATION
[1:21:11] STRIKE THAT HEART. HEY, YOU WANT A
[1:21:13] REVELATION OF THIS MESSAGE? TURN ON THE
[1:21:15] TAPES AND MEDITATE on the word of THE
[1:21:17] LORD. COME ON NOW. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID
[1:21:19] MEDITATING ON THE LORD BRINGS HIM NEAR
[1:21:22] YOU. HE SAYS WHILE YOU'RE THINKING ON
[1:21:24] HIM, THAT'S WHEN HE COMES. AND SO WE CAN
[1:21:26] BE LISTENING TO TAPES, BUT ARE WE
[1:21:28] MEDITATING ON HIM? BUT AS WE'RE
[1:21:30] MEDITATING ON HIM, INSPIRATION CAN
[1:21:34] STRIKE THE HEART AND BRING ANSWERS.
[1:21:37] HALLELUJAH. BRING WHAT YOU HAVE NEED IN
[1:21:40] THAT SITUATION. WHAT IS IT YOU
[1:21:43] AND I don't believe in psychology. I I
[1:21:45] trust y'all don't either. That the Holy
[1:21:47] Ghost is not a psychologist,
[1:21:50] right? The Holy Ghost is a reality, not
[1:21:52] something that is reading looking OVER
[1:21:54] AND JUST GUESSING that that the the Holy
[1:21:56] Ghost IS A REALITY, BUT OUR THOUGHT MA
[1:21:59] OUR THOUGHT LIFE DOES MATTER. You know,
[1:22:01] brother Brown, he he he would say this
[1:22:04] here. He he says, "NOW, I WANT TO ASK
[1:22:05] YOU A QUESTION. WHAT GOOD DOES IT do us
[1:22:08] to come to church and sit in a meeting
[1:22:11] and ponder and maybe be discouraged
[1:22:13] because we didn't get a prayer card,
[1:22:16] maybe be discouraged because of some ill
[1:22:18] thing a neighbor did or discouraged one
[1:22:21] about one little matter or the other. He
[1:22:24] says that keeps Christ away from you. He
[1:22:27] says it's when you're thinking on him.
[1:22:30] HE SAYS WHAT GOOD IS IT TO come to
[1:22:32] church but you're thinking on other
[1:22:33] things. You're thinking on your
[1:22:35] problems. You're thinking on the
[1:22:36] situations, you're thinking on this,
[1:22:38] you're thinking on that. And it's
[1:22:40] incredible because brother Brandon, he
[1:22:42] would say, so he want to change from
[1:22:43] hope today to positive faith. There's
[1:22:46] only one way to get positive faith, and
[1:22:48] that's by positive thinking OF POSITIVE
[1:22:51] THINGS. MY so and here, brother Brown,
[1:22:54] he he he he would sort of bring a he
[1:22:57] would bring an answer to it that we're
[1:22:59] not just thinking positive, but we got
[1:23:01] to think on the right thing. He would
[1:23:03] say this, too. You hear so much today
[1:23:05] about positive thinking. You just put
[1:23:07] your mind on anything and think positive
[1:23:09] on it. He says the devil can do that.
[1:23:12] There's only one thing that rules over
[1:23:14] that. THAT'S GOD'S WORD. IF YOU'RE IF
[1:23:17] you are thinking contrary to the word,
[1:23:19] forget your thinking. Think on the word.
[1:23:22] So, brother Brandham says in order to
[1:23:24] get positive faith, we got to think on
[1:23:26] positive things. It's thinking on the
[1:23:28] positive word of God.
[1:23:32] Is that okay? We're not JUST THINKING
[1:23:34] POSITIVE THING. I HOPE I GET A MILLION
[1:23:36] DOLLARS. I hope I get a I hope I get a
[1:23:37] nice car. Hope I get this. Hope I GET
[1:23:39] THAT. BUT WE'RE THANKING ON THE word of
[1:23:41] the Lord. AND AS WE'RE THINKING ON THE
[1:23:44] WORD OF THE LORD, WHAT WE'RE THINKING on
[1:23:46] positive things, it starts to bring in
[1:23:48] inspiration, which is a positive faith
[1:23:51] that points to the word of the Lord. And
[1:23:55] and and I love this quote here and and I
[1:23:57] won't keep you much longer this morning.
[1:23:58] Brother Brandon will say, "We got our
[1:24:00] minds on too many things of the world.
[1:24:02] If we would throw those things off of
[1:24:04] our mind and think about him and his
[1:24:07] soon coming. He says, "There be more
[1:24:09] revelations and powers in the church."
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Woo! Buddy, who's the church? You're the
[1:24:16] church.
[1:24:18] I'm sure you may have heard this. And
[1:24:19] I've heard my my my my dad's a pastor
[1:24:22] and so I've worked close with him and
[1:24:24] and traveling around a little bit. And
[1:24:26] one thing I always hear here, brother,
[1:24:29] is the reason I left the church is
[1:24:31] because he wasn't feeding me. And I've
[1:24:34] heard that so much. And and here,
[1:24:35] Brother Brandham would say, "If you
[1:24:37] THINK ON THE RIGHT THINGS, THERE'LL BE
[1:24:39] more re revelations in THE CHURCH."
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. He can be bringing
[1:24:44] revelations to you, but are you thinking
[1:24:46] on the right things? Oh, I'm preaching
[1:24:48] now. And you say, "Brother Brad, I'm
[1:24:49] going continue on, but we keep thinking
[1:24:51] about things. What am I going to do
[1:24:53] tomorrow? What will I do next week? What
[1:24:56] will he say? Will I hold my job? Will
[1:24:58] this be? And this is powerful to me.
[1:25:00] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS ALL THOSE THINGS
[1:25:02] are in the hands of God. Think on
[1:25:05] Christ.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; AND THAT REALLY SPOKE TO my heart
[1:25:08] because we can be thinking on problems.
[1:25:11] Is this going to happen? Is that going
[1:25:13] to happen? Can this be fixed? Can can
[1:25:15] are my bills going to be paid? And I've
[1:25:17] been there.
[1:25:19] I'm preaching from experience. I'm not
[1:25:21] perfect. I've been there. But here,
[1:25:22] brother Brandham says all of those
[1:25:24] things are in the hands of God. In other
[1:25:27] words, WHY THINK ABOUT THAT? THINK ON
[1:25:29] HIM.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; INSTEAD of thinking about how CAN IT BE,
[1:25:32] THINK ON THE one who can change the
[1:25:34] situation.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Come on. Your mind can never you you
[1:25:37] thinking on problems ain't going to
[1:25:38] CHANGE IT.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; BUT THINKING on the right things,
[1:25:42] THINKING ON THESE THINGS, THINKING ON
[1:25:44] POSITIVE, A POSITIVE WORD CAN ALSO BRING
[1:25:48] A CHANGE.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Oh my. It's incredible
[1:25:52] because what we fellowship on is what
[1:25:55] our what our speech is going to be. So
[1:25:57] as we're thinking on him or meditating
[1:25:59] on him, that's going to influence our
[1:26:02] speech. So if we're feeding on the
[1:26:04] spiritual food IN DUE SEASON, THAT'S
[1:26:07] GOING TO BECOME our confession. That's
[1:26:09] going to become what we're saying. And
[1:26:11] it's incredible that you can remember
[1:26:13] Peter. Peter would be whenever Christ
[1:26:15] was he he was about to be crucified and
[1:26:17] and and the Bible says he was standing
[1:26:19] by a fire and and there was some people
[1:26:21] that would come up to Peter and would
[1:26:23] say you're one of his disciples and
[1:26:24] Peter says no I don't know the man and
[1:26:26] they SAYS YES YOU'RE HIM THEY THAT WOULD
[1:26:28] SAY your speech belelleththy or
[1:26:31] betrayeth him and you know what WOULD
[1:26:33] HAPPEN THE BIBLE SAYS I KNOW NOT THE MAN
[1:26:36] AND HE WOULD BEGIN TO cuss what was he
[1:26:39] doing he was unashamed OF THE SPEECH BE
[1:26:43] AND WHERE WAS HE GETTING the speech? He
[1:26:45] was fellowshipping with Christ.
[1:26:48] And what's incredible to me is he would
[1:26:50] begin to speak the devil's language
[1:26:53] because he was ashamed to be identified
[1:26:55] with a positive word. And sometimes we
[1:26:59] can get there. You may say, "I NEVER
[1:27:00] CUSSED IN MY life and I never will." But
[1:27:02] you know, brother Brandon would say,
[1:27:04] "Speaking negative is the DEVIL'S
[1:27:05] LANGUAGE."
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; OH [screaming] MY. SO WE'RE LIVING IN A
[1:27:09] NEGATIVE WORLD WHERE EVERYBODY'S
[1:27:11] NEGATIVE. NOBODY HAS A GOOD DAY. And let
[1:27:14] let me just say this. You and you can
[1:27:17] hear, you know, I've been through this.
[1:27:19] I've been through that. Let me just give
[1:27:20] you a news flash. We're all going
[1:27:22] through things
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; AND YOU YOUR YOURS MIGHT BE HARDER THAN
[1:27:26] MINE. I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT WE ALL HAVE
[1:27:28] BATTLES. WE ALL HAVE TROUBLES. AND SO
[1:27:31] INSTEAD OF SPEAKING THE DEVIL'S
[1:27:32] LANGUAGE, SPEAK GOD'S LANGUAGE.
[1:27:35] OH, MICHAEL. SOMETIMES WE can get
[1:27:37] ashamed to speak the word of the Lord in
[1:27:40] our problem, in our situation, or or
[1:27:43] whenever you're fellowshipping with
[1:27:44] somebody and and they're speaking
[1:27:46] negative and hell, this is wrong. And
[1:27:47] and sometimes it's it's easier to get in
[1:27:50] with them saying, "Oh, I know this went
[1:27:52] wrong. Oh, REALLY? THIS HAPPENED."
[1:27:54] SOMETIMES it's easier to do that than TO
[1:27:56] SAY, "BUT HEY, LET ME TELL YOU A
[1:27:58] TESTIMONY." YOU SEE, SOMETIMES WE'RE
[1:28:00] EMBARRASSED TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE WANT
[1:28:03] TO FIT IN. BUT I SAY, DON'T be ashamed
[1:28:06] OF THE HEAVENLY LANGUAGE OF GOD. BUT
[1:28:09] WHENEVER YOU'RE IN THAT SITUATION,
[1:28:11] TESTIFY of who you've been
[1:28:13] fellowshipping with.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU DON'T GOT TO GET IN THE
[1:28:17] GLOOM WITH THEM. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO
[1:28:18] GET IN THE GLOOM, DON'T GET IN THERE
[1:28:20] WITH THEM. PULL THEM OUT OF IT. COME ON
[1:28:22] NOW. DON'T LET THEM PULL YOU IN THE
[1:28:23] DISCOURAGEMENT. PULL THEM OUT OF THE
[1:28:25] DISCOURAGEMENT. HOW DO I DO THAT? BY
[1:28:27] SPEAKING POSITIVE OVER THEIR SITUATION.
[1:28:31] OH MY. WHAT? WELL, WHILE LAZARUS WAS IN
[1:28:33] THE TOMB OF DISCOURAGEMENT AND A TOMB OF
[1:28:36] NEGATIVITY, IT WAS MARTHA. IT WAS MARTHA
[1:28:39] THAT WOULD SAY, "BUT EVEN NOW, YOU CAN
[1:28:41] SPEAK THE WORD, AND I KNOW GOD HEARTH
[1:28:43] THEE IN HIS NEGATIVE SITUATION." SHE
[1:28:46] REFUSED TO SPEAK THE DEVIL'S LANGUAGE
[1:28:49] AND WILL SPEAK A POSITIVE WORD THAT
[1:28:51] [screaming] EVEN NOW YOU CAN PULL HIM
[1:28:53] OUT OF THAT.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; OH, YOU WANT TO HELP SOMEBODY SPEAK
[1:28:57] POSITIVE THINGS TO THEM? DON'T GET IN
[1:28:59] THERE WITH them and say, "Oh, I know."
[1:29:01] And I get it. There's got to be wisdom
[1:29:03] with it. YOU DON'T WANT YOU WANT TO BE
[1:29:05] SYMPATHETIC, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT
[1:29:07] THERE IS A TRUTH behind speaking the
[1:29:09] word of the Lord IN SITUATIONS, AND THAT
[1:29:12] CAN BRING A SUNSHINE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:15] BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE IN THE
[1:29:17] MIDDLE OF A BATTLE, YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO
[1:29:19] LET YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS STILL A SUN
[1:29:22] UP THERE. SOMETIMES THE CLOUDS AND AND
[1:29:25] AND UP THIS WAY UP UP NORTH, MAN, you
[1:29:27] never see the sun around here in the
[1:29:28] winter times it feels like. But yet the
[1:29:31] sun's still there. THERE MIGHT BE
[1:29:33] CLOUDS, BUT THE SUN IS STILL THERE. AND
[1:29:35] ONE DAY IN THE SPRINGTIME, THE THE
[1:29:38] CLOUDS ARE GOING TO GO BACK AND AND THE
[1:29:40] SUN IS STILL GOING TO BE THERE. AND YOUR
[1:29:42] YOUR POSITIVE WORDS CAN BE a springtime
[1:29:45] to an individual that is in the midst of
[1:29:48] a WINTER MONTH. HALLELUJAH. AND ALL THEY
[1:29:51] SEE IS CLOUDS. ALL THEY SEE IS DEATH.
[1:29:53] ALL THEY SEE IS HOW ALL THE THE THE
[1:29:55] FLOWERS HAVE DIED. THE TREES HAVE DIED.
[1:29:57] BUT YET YOUR POSITIVE WORD CAN PUSH BACK
[1:30:00] THE CLOUDS. AND THAT SON CAN COME IN A
[1:30:04] SITUATION AND BRING LIFE ONCE AGAIN.
[1:30:07] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:30:08] IT'S UNASHAMED OF A POSITIVE CONFESSION.
[1:30:11] I'M GOING TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD.
[1:30:14] They must say I don't know what to say.
[1:30:15] You know, brother Brandon was saying,
[1:30:16] you know what confession is? He is he
[1:30:18] says saying the same things. He was
[1:30:21] saying our confession is saying the same
[1:30:23] thing that the word of GOD SAYS. YOU MAY
[1:30:25] NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY. QUOTE HIM A QUOTE.
[1:30:27] SEND HIM A QUOTE. HEY, I LOVE DOING
[1:30:29] THAT. WHENEVER I'M STUDYING AND I COME
[1:30:31] ACROSS a quote that I like or encourages
[1:30:33] me, I put it on our family chat, YOU
[1:30:35] KNOW, OR SEND IT TO SOMEBODY. AND WHAT
[1:30:37] IS IT? IT'S A POSITIVE SUN RAY. WHEN
[1:30:40] SOMEBODY MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH CLOUDS
[1:30:42] AND DISCOURAGEMENT, I CAN SEND SOME
[1:30:44] SUNLIGHT TO THEM. HALLELUJAH. THAT CAN
[1:30:47] BRING LIGHT IN THEIR SITUATION.
[1:30:49] Glory to God. Let me just say this here
[1:30:52] and say that your situation is never
[1:30:54] hopeless.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; It's never helpless.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Whenever God's on your side,
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; whenever you've got some words of the
[1:31:02] Lord and it's incredible because brother
[1:31:04] Brandham was saying one place that
[1:31:06] confession means stone, right? And and
[1:31:09] you we can look how in in the Bible and
[1:31:12] how that there was a in the book of
[1:31:13] Judges, I believe, that that there was
[1:31:15] an an invading uh army that that was
[1:31:18] coming into this land and was wiping out
[1:31:20] the warriors, wiping out all of the
[1:31:22] king's men. And and there was some some
[1:31:25] people that would go into a tower. And
[1:31:27] the Bible says that the king and his and
[1:31:29] this army would go to the tower, break
[1:31:32] the door down, and would destroy the
[1:31:33] tower with everybody in it. But there
[1:31:36] was a certain woman. The Bible says, a
[1:31:38] certain woman would go to a strong
[1:31:40] tower. Not just a tower, but a strong
[1:31:42] tower. And you remember what the Bible
[1:31:44] says, the name of the Lord is a strong
[1:31:46] tower, and the righteous run into it and
[1:31:49] are safe. Not just a tower, it's a
[1:31:52] strong tower. We haven't been just given
[1:31:53] truth. We've been given heavenlyorn
[1:31:55] truth. And so this certain woman would
[1:31:58] run into the strong tower and and the
[1:32:00] Bible says that this invading king would
[1:32:03] come to this tower and would beat on the
[1:32:05] door but couldn't get into the tower
[1:32:07] because he couldn't couldn't get through
[1:32:09] the door. And what would Jesus say? I'm
[1:32:10] the door of the sheep. No man could come
[1:32:13] in unless he gets through me. So once
[1:32:15] we're in a strong tower, Christ is the
[1:32:17] door. Once we're in heavenly born truth,
[1:32:20] Christ is the door. And the Bible says
[1:32:22] that the certain woman, certain woman, a
[1:32:25] faith woman will LOOK OUT OF THE TOWER
[1:32:27] AND WOULD see the king sitting there.
[1:32:29] And the Bible says she grabbed a piece
[1:32:31] of a millstone, a piece of a stone,
[1:32:33] piece of a confession, WILL LOOK DOWN AT
[1:32:36] THAT KING, would throw the millstone
[1:32:38] down and would kill that king. This the
[1:32:41] king that was taken over home after
[1:32:43] home, marriage after marriage, church
[1:32:45] after church, life after life, preacher
[1:32:48] after preacher, home after home. There
[1:32:51] was a certain woman with a confession
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; and she did even have the whole
[1:32:55] millstone. The Bible says she had a
[1:32:57] piece of a millstone. You might not be
[1:33:00] able to quote the whole Bible. You might
[1:33:02] not be able to quote the whole seals or
[1:33:04] you might not be able to understand
[1:33:06] everything. But take what you do KNOW
[1:33:09] JUST THE PIECE OF THAT CONFESSION
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; AND SAY THE SAME THING.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Remember that boy that would
[1:33:16] pray and he was saying his ABCs? Y'all
[1:33:18] remember that? And the man says, "What
[1:33:20] are you doing?" He says, "I don't know
[1:33:21] what to say." So, I just figured I would
[1:33:23] give him the whole alphabet, and he can
[1:33:25] put together what my HEART'S SAYING.
[1:33:27] SOMETIMES YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY,
[1:33:29] BUT JUST CONFESS. Speak the word over
[1:33:32] every situation.
[1:33:34] HALLELUJAH. SPEAK THE WORD AND GOD comes
[1:33:37] on the scene. You know, brother Brandon,
[1:33:40] well, the Bible tells us actually that
[1:33:42] death and life is in the power of the
[1:33:44] tongue, right? And I think it's
[1:33:47] incredible that that while we're living
[1:33:49] in the day of negativity and while while
[1:33:51] the churches are dying that there's a
[1:33:53] group of people that's alive by the word
[1:33:56] of God, right? By the tongue of Almighty
[1:33:59] God. And we can grab that word and speak
[1:34:02] life in our situations. Grab that word
[1:34:05] and confess life in every situation.
[1:34:08] It's incredible because the power of our
[1:34:11] words is a genuine thing. and and as our
[1:34:14] musicians come and and the Bible would
[1:34:16] talk about how that Job as he was on his
[1:34:19] ash sheep and how that how that he he
[1:34:21] couldn't his friends were saying he was
[1:34:23] a secret sinner and how that he he he he
[1:34:26] had done some wrongs and and as the Lord
[1:34:28] would come in the in the thunder and
[1:34:32] begin to speak to Job and Job would then
[1:34:34] off his ass ash sheep would look at his
[1:34:36] friends and would say will this vain
[1:34:38] babbling end will it cease he says if
[1:34:41] you was in this situations
[1:34:43] He says, "I wouldn't use my words
[1:34:44] against you." He says, "I would use my
[1:34:46] words to strengthen you." Hallelujah.
[1:34:50] And he was giving us some insight that
[1:34:52] our words can either tear down or it can
[1:34:54] build up. It can either discourage or it
[1:34:58] can either encourage the power of life
[1:35:00] and death is in the tongue. You remember
[1:35:02] whenever whenever David was bringing the
[1:35:04] ark of the covenant back to the back to
[1:35:06] Jerusalem and how he was dancing, right?
[1:35:08] and and his clothes he danced out of his
[1:35:10] clothes and and his and his wife Michael
[1:35:14] Michelle was was there and was watching
[1:35:16] him and would say he's a disgrace and be
[1:35:18] and he was he would come back to the
[1:35:20] home. He would she would begin to chew
[1:35:22] him out, you know, and and what would
[1:35:24] happen because of her words, she would
[1:35:27] no longer be able to produce a child.
[1:35:29] Well, her words brought death. Oh, but
[1:35:32] at the same time, your words can bring
[1:35:34] life. He's saying, "I believe our our
[1:35:37] words can bring life in situations."
[1:35:39] Let's bow our heads this morning.
[1:35:42] Dear gracious heavenly father,
[1:35:47] Lord, we're thankful for your
[1:35:50] Lord, your never failing presence, Lord,
[1:35:53] and never failing promises,
[1:35:56] Lord, that we can confess it with an
[1:35:58] assurance, Lord. not a hope so, but with
[1:36:02] a faith.
[1:36:04] Lord, I know that we might not
[1:36:05] understand how it's going to happen. We
[1:36:08] might not know what tomorrow holds, but
[1:36:10] we know who holds tomorrow.
[1:36:13] And Lord, I ask that if there's some
[1:36:16] here that might be fighting
[1:36:17] discouragement.
[1:36:19] Their back might be against the wall.
[1:36:21] Maybe feeling like they're alone and
[1:36:23] forsaken.
[1:36:25] Lord, may they [snorts] may they look
[1:36:27] above the clouds and see that there's a
[1:36:29] word. There's a God
[1:36:32] that are shining light in every
[1:36:33] situation.
[1:36:35] In every negative situation, there is
[1:36:37] still a positive word.
[1:36:40] Lord, I ask that you would strengthen
[1:36:41] your people this morning. Lord, how we
[1:36:44] love you. We appreciate your goodness
[1:36:46] and your mercy in Jesus name.
[1:36:50] Amen.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing that? You know that
[1:36:56] song He knows my name. Um that's Can we
[1:37:00] sing Amazing Grace?
[1:37:03] It's amazing
[1:37:07] grace.
[1:37:09] How sweet
[1:37:11] the sounds
[1:37:13] that saved a rich
[1:37:18] like me.
[1:37:22] I once was lost,
[1:37:26] but now I'm found.
[1:37:31] I was blind,
[1:37:33] but now
[1:37:35] I see. I want to read you this quote
[1:37:37] here as I turn it to our pastor. Brother
[1:37:40] Brandham says, "Faith looks at God's
[1:37:43] worst and it esteems it greater and more
[1:37:46] valuable than the best that the world
[1:37:49] has." Oh my. So the worst day with God
[1:37:52] is better than the best day in this
[1:37:54] world.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; It looks at God's worst. I say let that
[1:37:58] be our confession. Let that be our our
[1:38:01] expectation. Let that be the way we look
[1:38:03] at things. And may that be when we look
[1:38:06] at situations, we're saying, "This might
[1:38:08] be bad, but I'm going to look at it the
[1:38:10] way God is looking at it, and I'm going
[1:38:12] to speak life into that situation."
[1:38:15] Amen. Let's sing it again as we turn it
[1:38:16] to our pastor now.
[1:38:19] Amazing.
[1:38:41] I'm found.
[1:38:43] was blind, but now I see. Let's stand
[1:38:49] together.
[1:38:51] Was grace that taught my heart to fear
[1:38:59] and grace my fears
[1:39:03] relive.
[1:39:07] How preious
[1:39:09] did that grace
[1:39:13] appear
[1:39:15] the hour I first believe
[1:39:23] through many [singing]
[1:39:25] dangers.
[1:39:28] This is a positive testimony here. I
[1:39:31] have
[1:39:33] already
[1:39:35] come.
[1:39:38] His grace have brought me safe thus far.
[1:39:46] And grace will lead me home.
[1:39:54] And we been there 10,000
[1:40:00] years.
[1:40:02] Bright shineing
[1:40:04] as the sun.
[1:40:09] We no less taste to sing God's praise.
[1:40:17] And when we first began,
[1:40:25] praise God. Praise God. Praise God.

[1:41:15] confess it out loud to God. God is here
[1:41:18] to do exceed above. All that we would

[1:42:22] that come out of our mouth, LORD. BLESS

[1:42:27] Bless the actions, Lord, that we we
[1:42:29] have, Father, that they may produce life
[1:42:32] around us, Lord Jesus. I pray that you
[1:42:35] turn our homes around, Lord. Turn our
[1:42:37] our our lives around. Turn our
[1:42:39] relationships around, Lord. Uh turn our

[1:43:36] brother Josh, when you came into the
[1:43:38] room, you saw I had a computer there,
[1:43:40] didn't you?
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Well, I was starting
[1:43:45] uh to work on the message, and the only
[1:43:48] part I got was there has to be a change.

[1:44:00] God to pass. You know, we're just we're
[1:44:03] in a battle. We're fighting it. Don't be
[1:44:06] discouraged. You're not the only one
[1:44:08] battling, but we just got to get back

[1:44:14] it. And God will move in our behalf.

[1:44:59] brother.
