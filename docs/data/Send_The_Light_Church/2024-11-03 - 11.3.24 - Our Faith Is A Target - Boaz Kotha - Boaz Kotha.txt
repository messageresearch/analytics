about the rest of you but praise the Lord Brother Dennis is going to give us a testimony before I take up the prayer request I mean I could do the testimony but you know when I had a stroke and a heart attack they gave me a short time to live I come to church and I put a prayer request out they laid hands on me they all prayed and God heard and answered the prayer I lived for a while with half a heart workking last week when I wasn't here I was at the doctor's office doing all the stress tests and everything he come into the office and he said brother Dennis 97% your heart is now I run up I grabbed him I hugged him I gave him a little cheek kiss he turned red then we looked up and he says it wasn't me it was God above directing us and I want to thank each and every one of you for your prayers I've never felt so good I'm ready to go work for the Lord thank us younger ones need that energy now I don't know if you know this or not but if your heart muscle starts to die it doesn't come back that's right so it's truly americ Miracle amen amen so we're thankful for that testimony amen amen so this morning as we take up their prayer requests um ree says please pray for me that God would give me strength to make it while I'm at school amen uh brother Johnson I was going to bring him today but he's actually not sleeping well at all so he called me while I was on my way over there and so he and sister Johnson are home we want to remember them um we want to remember uh sister Gabrielle says please remember Charlie and Debbie Debbie is having surgery and they'll be in Arizona for a month Charlie has hurt his back and is experiencing a lot of pain amen want to remember uh sister Sano from the Philippines to remember all the Saints there that have lost their houses and things due to the extreme weather events I think that's the new way to say it remember those Believers in Spain they didn't get much of a warning and it just kind of washed everything away it's a great thing to have God on your side it's a great thing to put your trust in somebody bigger than you you so when the Trials come and the tri the weather and everything is going against you you can say he's my pilot he's the captain of my ship so we want to remember the Saints in the Philippines also the Believers in Israel [Music] Ukraine there's many things amen um let's also continue to remember those that are dealing with cancer sister Elizabeth Bob Koba brother Ron Spencer there's many others God knows all those things amen he knows the secrets in your heart he knows the cries the needs you have and I'm grateful for that so let's all stand together just join our voices amen know strling lordess Lord Lord we just commit everything in your amen amen you may be seated amen so brother Marty has a public service announcement we also have another one while he's walking up here brother Ron says uh he's looking for someone to help clean the church while he's having surgery um and if you can see him that would be great amen thank you um just this is just a quick reminder you know as the weather gets colder you know what happens everybody stays inside and you know what happens with that germs spread around more quickly and we do have a a significant number of people here who who are uh really sub you know their their health is such that uh they can get sick very easily and uh it could uh the consequences are are greater than let's say a normal healthy person but we have a number of them and also us olders as we get older and you young people it's going to happen to you eventually um you know you start your immune systems are broken down a little more so all I'm really asking is if you're sick please stay home and uh that would be a benefit to all of us and if your children are sick please keep them home it can be a hassle I know because you know it could spread around but it's just much better if we just keep them home and we just minimize the possibility of uh of catching cold flu covid you know the whole thing so we do have the online service and uh that's what that's for so I would appreciate if everybody would do that praise the Lord Rock of Ages he's my Clift amen Rock of Ages cleft for me let me hide myself in thee let the water and the blood from thy wounded side which flow be of sin the double cure save from wrath and make me pure could my tears forever flow could my Zeal no longer know those for s could not atone thou must save and thou alone in my hand no price I bring simply to thy cross I cling while I draw this fleeting breath when my eyes shall close in death when I Rise to world's unknown and behold they on thy Throne Rock of Ages C for me let me hide myself in thee Rock of Ages cleft for me let me hide myself in the let the water and the blood from thy wounded side which Flo be for sin the double cure save from wrath and make me pure amen amen let's all Stand Together amen and ask brother John if you'll pray over the offering amen

amen the House of Prayer amen that that song We were singing he turned the water into wine what a I believe that is a very good type for us today that the word that we're going to hear today with our natural ears can be turned into a supernatural Revelation for our soul and and he's here to do exceedingly above that for our lives amen and and it it all has to do with the hunger right so and as the service is going on just Lord F me more F me more you don't have to just if you didn't do it enough at the beginning it's okay we still got the whole service to hunger for God amen amen let's stand we

brother John for giving me this place and uh let us see what the Lord has in store for us today you know good to see you all everyone of you and uh the Lord made it able to so that I could come once again you know and uh things are getting very bad uh in India with the situation of persecution uh it's rising every day you know so please remember our nation and our our people the Bride of Jesus Christ in India amen we need your prayers amen greetings and uh uh love from the orphans the widows the elderly and the uh lepers and from the church back home you know the Lord has been good to me and uh this is my 33 years of preaching this word preaching this truth and doing the missionary service for a long time now and sure appreciate all your love and your prayer as well as the support which you have been giving or sending to us from time to time God bless you all let us turn our Bibles to the Book of Luke 22 verse 31 and 32 Luke chapter 22 verse 31 and 32 I'm just standing here to encourage my brothers and my sisters you know amen uh because the word of God says encourage one another exalt one another and comfort one another so so let us uh look to the author of Faith you know and author of our life our Lord Jesus Christ Luke 2231 and 32 and I'll be also reading from Luke 188 Luke 22 3132 and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan had desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren amen Luke 188 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall you find faith on the earth may the Lord bless the reading of his holy word you may be seated thank you so much I would like to talk on a a subject or a title called our faith is a target you know amen we have been targeted or our faith is targeted from both ends one is from God and one is from the enemy amen the enemy is targeting our faith as well as God is targeting our faith he's checking how much faith we have today you knowen when 2,000 years ago when he was upon this Earth and as he was ascending into heaven or going back to Heaven you know he said I will not leave you comfortless but I will send you a comforter you right amen and that's a a uh word which can strengthen us so much you know that we have a comforter today and that is nothing but the Holy Ghost amen without Holy Ghost we can't go far enough in our life you know sometimes we as human beings we try to uh walk with without God in this world you know there are times in our life knowingly unknowingly we try to walk leaning upon our own understanding right very but I want to tell you that we can't go far you know that's right and I believe in the eyes of God in the plan of God there is always a uturn you know you know you can't go so far but you know at one point you have to make a uturn and come back to where you left God Amen whether it is a month ago or a 6 months ago a year ago or maybe 10 years ago but at one point of Al we have to make a urn amen whether it is young people or middle-aged or old we all have to come to a realization that we need to come back to the Pavilion amen the prophet of God said that this is the time that we need to make ourself you know coming towards the Pavilion where we left God we have to come back to Pentecost you know we have to come back to the oldtime religion we have have to come back where we have left God Amen because without God we cannot do anything amen this is a a very terrible time the age we are living in you know the other day I was uh preaching on you know in India you know on the shaken Nest you know and a mighty Wing you know amen thank God we are shaken you know sometimes he tries us he he tests us you know and there is a time that he will allow the enemy to test us you know but in everything in every walk of of our life God is present with us amen as I always say you know I would rather walk in Low Valley or dark hour of my life or the dark valleys in my life with Jesus Christ than to walk in light alone you know I don't want to be alone and so are you you know it's our desire that we want to have the Lord in our every step in our every Walk of Life we go through battles in our life we have so many trials ups and downs in our life you know but thank God for the Holy Ghost today that he has given to us you know that it will correct us it will take us into the right path it will direct us you know amen and I truly believe you know whenever we are in need of anything the only place where we can rest upon is in the presence of God the house of God is the house of correction amen if you are not corrected here there is no other place in the world where you will be corrected you know thank God for the word of God today you know that has become a light unto our feet you know it has become lamp to our lives you know to lead us and to guide us you know during this taking time during this trying times of our life I think we need to come to a place of resting and that's the word of God Amen if you see the life of uh Simon Peter here you know a man who was used by God a man who walked on the water a man who did Miracles a man who followed Christ in every walk of his life who ate with him who sat with him who lived with him who saw Miracles who did Miracles but at one time before Christ was going to be crucified you know the Lord was dealing with Simon he said Simon do you love me and Simon said yes I love you he said feed my sheep right and then again he said Simon do you love me he said yes Lord I love you he said feed my sheep you know yes and the third time time again he asked Simon Simon do you love me he says feed my sheep you know yes and again he asked Simon really do you love me we come to a point sometimes you know I feel as I speak now is is as if God is trying to question me do I really love him do I really serve him do I really walk with him you know coming to church is not serving the lord no everybody comes to the church the good the bad the evil you know the prophet said three kinds of Believers you know make believer unbeliever and believer and God is not worried about a Believer and neither is worried about the unbeliever true right but he is more worried about a make believer right because you don't know when he will change his colors you know right but thank God that God has put us in a place today that we are called to be his bride we are called to be his children you know amen and we need to understand today we need to realize who we are today where we came from yes there is a great blessing when we really serve the Lord and love the Lord amen in spite of persecution in spite of ups and downs in in my country I still always strive and ask God Lord keep me in your perfect will I want to serve you till the last breath of my life till the last drop of my blood you know I want to thank God for his grace and mercy today I I think we need to come to a a point of realization do I really serve God do I really love him you know because if we don't come to that realization you can come to the church for the next 10 years and it's not going to help you all you'll be doing is warming up the pews and just go after 1 hour or two hour you know but I want to tell you today that we need to have a a close a personal relationship with God when Peter said when Peter was asked do you really love me Peter humanly speaking he said yes I love you you know just by his mouth you know he said I love you Lord you know I serve you I I'm I'm with you wherever you are I with you but when he when he you know pressed into it he said do you really love me he said you know it everything Lord amen and I truly believe that today God knows every heart yes from the beginning Till the End Amen roow God knows everyone amen what we are who we are what kind of life we are living yes I always say you know it is not important to be holy in the four walls of the church no everybody can be holy in the four walls of the church amen but it is when we are all by ourself whether it is our schools our College our homes our bedrooms or our workplace our business whatever it is today it is important that how we are living with God Walking with God many people say Hey brother are you in the message you know many people question me you know when I go to a new place the first thing they will ask me are you in the message you know if they repeat it twice or Thrice then I tell them it is not important to be in the message but the message should be in US amen the prophet said live the message not talk the message live the message amen and if we have the power of the holy spirit in our life if we have that Authority if you have that personal experience of Walking with God I want to tell you brothers and sisters you don't need to be taught amen today sometime the man of God or The Shepherd of the house of God needs to teach the ABCs all the time but I want to tell you if you can have a personal experience with God God is not looking for a group relationship he's not looking for a church relationship he's looking for an individual relationship today the self-existing god The God Who exist The God Who is omnipresent Omni poent omnicient the Lord who is a Shepherd you know I like that statement the Lord is my shepherd I shall not warn there was a Sunday school teacher who said to a 4-year-old girl he said go and learn Psalms 23 and next Sunday I'm going to ask you and everybody was sitting in the Sunday school you know and that little girl was asked she says why don't you repeat or tell what Psalm 23 is she stood up and she says the Lord is my shepherd and that's all I want and she sat down that's true the Lord is Our Shepherd and that's all we want you amen praise the Lord all the next five verses are in that one line the Lord is my shepherd that's all I want amen and if there is anything today that we need more and more of God that he must be the shepherd of our life yes we must love him we must serve him amen sometimes I I I realize I I wonder how come Peter who has been walking so close with God a man who walked on the water there's nobody in the whole world in the history of the world a man who walked on the water that was only Peter you know but look at his condition today the Bible says Simon Simon behold Satan I desired to have you right if he can have Peter that means he can even have you he can even have me he can have any one of you right he says the Satan had desired to have you that he may sift you as a wheat yes I have not seen it in in America people sifting the wheat but you know in my country back home you know yes even today you during the Harvest time they stand on the heap of rise or grain or corn or anything or wheat or anything it is and they try to take that you know pan and you know try to Swift the wheat you know why do they do that to keep the Shu away from the grain from the seed and sometimes as the word of God says the devil will try to sift you as a wheat the devil will try to test you and God allows it you know we have an example of job you know God said where were you you know I have been going from to and fro over the Earth you know you know and God said did you did you had a chance to meet my servant job look at the confidence God had in job amen amen my brothers my sister you know it should be we should come to such a point that God must have confidence in us and we should have confidence in God whether we go through ups and downs or trials in our life it doesn't matter if we can have confidence in God's faithfulness yes God also must have confidence in us he says Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but look at the goodness of God he says but I have prayed for thee amen that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren this is the time in Simon's life he's saying I'm going to be crucified I'm going to be gone but before that you will tell lies three times before the crows you will deny me Peter that's why he asked that question do you love me do you love me do you love me do you love me at one point Peter said you know everything everything the Lord himself knew that before the crows he will deny him three times amen he will reject him but the goodness of God is he says Peter I have prayed for thee what if the Lord comes to you your your bedside today when you are going through tough trials in your life and if he comes and says John I pray for you I have prayed for thee am oh brother Roger I have prayed for you if I can tell my brother if my brother tells me brother boas I'm praying for you how much comfort we get amen but it's God himself the creator of the world the savior of the world the ruler of the world he says Peter I have prayed for thee amen why he prayed for Peter so that his faith will not fail right that means today our faith is at Target amen thank you the devil is after us the devil is after every one of us and so is the Lord he's trying you he's testing your faith today amen thank God for the word of God he said I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on earth when he comes back he's not going to ask you how many million dollars you have earned your business right true he's not going to ask you or see or look at your Cadillac or your you know nice house and a nice Bungalow no he's not coming to look at our status but he says when I come will I find Faith Hallelujah Hebrews 11 talks about without faith it is impossible to please God brothers sisters our faith is a center of the target which God does shoot when he tries us and if any other Grace if any other grace shall Escape untried certainly faith shall not the grace in our lives can escape from the test or from The Trial but the faith cannot be Faith must be tried right then only know God will know who we are and what we are he loves to sometime put you to trials and troubles so that he can know how we function when we are tried and tested we are human beings it's a human nature when When Trials comes in our life we are frustrated we go Haywire we don't know where we are we don't know what we are doing but my brothers my sister that that's the only time we need to be silent we need to rest upon God's word we need to rest upon God Amen instead of running from pillars to Poe it is good to wait upon God Amen when we wait upon God then only we will get strength you know Faith must be tried and even if it's the fness heated seven times blessed be the man who can endure the the audial that's what CH spon said he said our faith must be tried and even if it is the forness heated seven times he said blessed is the man who can endure it prophet of God said you will stumble if you don't have faith God's provided way of healing he says you might go through a life living a good Christian Life you might belong to some church you might have a fine membership you might be a more of a moral character and all of that but brother that still isn't Christianity what is Christianity Christianity is when the Holy Ghost has taken full possession full possession of what your wealth no full possession of you and you are led by the Holy Spirit amen he says no matter how good how moral how good a church member you are Prophet said Kane was just as good as any church member yes Kain was very religious believed in God made sacrifices built a church built altars made done all the things that's religious and God still refused him amen amen so was isau Esau was a fine cultured gentlemen right amen sometime we also are good gentlemen we are also cultured it doesn't matter in the eyes of God how much cultured you are how much of a fine gentleman who we are all he wants us to see is do we really love him today do we really want to serve him is there a Zeal in our heart is there a desire in our heart that no matter what may come or go if you can love God and serve God praise the Lord if you look in this chapter Peter has been Justified he's a man who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ he would even preach the gospel but Jesus told him after you are converted then strengthen your brothers amen see after you converted what is conversion conversion is the holy spirit that moves the old nature out and the new nature comes in which is the Holy Ghost AM and when a man has truly been Bond of the spirit of God he has everlasting life that's why Jesus said so he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me ha everlasting life right and shall not come into condemnation or judgment but has passed from Death unto life amen brothers sisters sometimes our own walk seems to be so perfect in our own eyes that's right the prophet of God said he said I may not be perfect in your eyes you may not be perfect in my eyes but what about God's eyes amen today we judge everyone easily yes yes sometimes we judge the book bites cover but God doesn't do that no what he is looking at is the inward man the inner man today he doesn't look at the outer of a person right we do it but God looks into the inner self of a person amen we need conversion today we need total transformation Israel and the church he says conversion not by any fleshly demonstration or emotion right but something that's happened in here that's change your whole opinion change your whole nature amen Lord you are converted not you but Christ has come into you and converted you your nature is dead in the old man and you are born again and you are a new man amen right but you look at many people today the situations of many people today Sunday they are Bor again and Monday to Saturday they are gone again right true that's true true I might not know you I might not know you what you do the whole week you might not know what I'm doing but God knows everything whether you're born again only on Sunday or born again the whole week God looks into every step every walk of our life amen that's the true conversion whether anybody with me or not whether my parents are with me or not whether my pastor is with me or not whether my friends are with me or not I am converted amen yes I will live faithful to my God I will live faithful to my husband I will live faithful to my wife I'll will live faithful to my parents to my church and that is what God is looking for today I like this word he says you are converted not you but Christ has come into you and has converted you your nature is dead in the old man amen and you are a new creature a born again Christian you are a new man watch amen what was the Holy Ghost given for there the prophet of God is trying to explain the life of Peter he says oh my dear friends from around this country in this little city he said if I could only with my human voice Place into your heart the importance of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost it would be the most wonderful Revelation that you ever had in your life he says let me make that clear about you are not converted it says Peter had been saved he believed on the Lord followed him Jesus told him who he was had him to follow him he gave him the power against unclean spirits and Sanctified him but after all of that and Peter become the chief spokesman of that group as the Catholic would want to call it the bishop of the church or the pope or whatever it is the headman of the church yet Jesus said the night of his betrayal lovest thou me Peter and he said Lord you know I love you feed my sheep he said that three times and Peter said you know I love you till I go with you to the end and I will go with you unto death he said before the has crowed three times before the crows you will have denied me three times he said but Peter I have prayed for you amen listen that's not all of it I have prayed for you and after you are converted then strengthen your brethren amen don't you all know don't I know that don't the bible say that Judas did Miracles yes did but was he really converted no he walked with God he was on the table yes he saw every Miracle Jesus did he himself did Miracles amen today we think oh if I'm close to my pastor I will go to heaven no if I go every Sunday to church I will go to heaven no my brothers my sister coming to church service every Sunday will not take you to heaven amen it's the power of God the Holy Ghost which is in you amen which will give us the quickening power yes to meet God in the Rapture I truly believe God is speaking to someone today amen it might be me yes that's true thank you Lord there are times I sit down and I say Lord I really need conversion Total Transformation right we are humans yes amen we tend to do mistakes amen we tend to walk away from the presence of God from the word of God true true every day we need God is his grace his mercy upon Our Lives Israel the same message Israel and the church he said Judas was with him that's right Judas was just as a big a duck was in the puddle yeah he was shouting and rejoicing he followed the church right on down till it come to Pentecost amen amen amen that's why I said in the beginning the Lord wants us to come back to Pentecost amen he says but when it come to Pentecost to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he refused it and he betrayed Jesus and that was the Antichrist amen and that's the spirit today will come right down and teach justification by faith and everything and move right on down to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then show its colors yes true that's exactly Judas walked with Christ amen he sat with Christ he ate with Christ he did Miracles he saw Miracles but the problem is he could not wait till the day of Pentecost am that's what Jesus is tell telling Peter until Thou Art converted walking with him did not convert him amen eating with him did not convert him amen doing miracles did not convert him walking on the water oh my brothers my sister what if you walk like Peter walked on the water you will not be here you will be in Heavens oh I walked on water I walked on water I walked on water for God walking on the water did not mean anything he said Peter until thou are converted totally amen hallelujah what is God looking today he wants a total transformation yes that's right Total Transformation not 99.99 no he wants Total Transformation amen sometimes we are like cat brother John how does the cat drinks the milk it closes the eyes and drink the milk thinking nobody's watching me it happens in my country brother I don't know whether it happens you all have pets as cats as pets but you know in India we don't have dogs and cats as pets because they are all stray dogs and Stray Cats but somehow the cat enters into the house when nobody's around and the cat's eyes is on that that bowl of milk on the kitchen platform and it comes slowly and drinks the milk closing the eyes seeing nobody's watching me and that's how we tend to sin sometime that's how we tend to go walk away from God that's how many people today have so many relationships right thinking nobody is Watching God is not watching no my brothers my sister God Is Watching amen he's watching our every step yes every word we speak every step we make in our life God is looking at our walk amen God is looking for transformation watch the 10 virgins that went out all of them were virgins five of them were foolish five had oil in their lambs what is the oil the Holy Spirit see that's right they were all virgins lived good clean lives right you say well brother I don't go to dances I don't go to shows that's just the moral thing yeah amen what does God need today from us he wants us to have a total transformation total conversion what else he wants us from he wants us to walk in the Supernatural live in the Supernatural Amen in the same message isra in the church it says unless there has been a supernatural it says unless there has been a supernatural not because you shouted not because you spoke with tongue not because you jumped up and down not because you did this but something supernatural has happened in here amen that's Chang you and put you a seal up in God you are anchored when we are anchored nothing can shake us when we live under the supernatural nothing can shake us when we live amen walk in the Supernatural nothing can shake us amen have you ever realize my brothers my sister in spite of doing everything why many of us we don't have victory in our life the word of God doesn't say like that if you look into Isaiah 45 verse 2-5 he says I will go before thee and make the Crooked places straight I will break in pieces the gates of brass and cutting a th the bars of iron he says I will give Thee the treasures of Darkness amen and hidden Riches of the secret places that thou mayest know that I the Lord which call thee by thy name name the god of Israel it says for Jacob my servant sake and Israel mine elect I have been called even thee by name I have surnamed thee though thou has not known me he said I am the lord and there is none else there is no God beside me I guarded thee thou has not known me God wants to bless us all amen but there are times in our life we don't know where we are who we are and what we are doing right yes amen we don't have victory in our lives we are still struggling we are in pain we are going through ups and downs in our life God Comforts Us by his word but still we are not being comforted we are still looking for victory there are times in our lives sometimes you feel like we are in the prison bars let me tell you brothers and sister no life without Holy Ghost it's not a life amen no life without the anointing it's not a aive we need to live a life with anointing of God we need to live the life with the Holy Ghost right we need anointing of God we can't survive without the anointing of Goden what is the anointing is the spirit of God as mentioned in Acts 1 18 he says but he shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and he shall be my Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all judia and in Samaria and the unto the uttermost part of the earth amen today why do we lack power of God because we don't live under the supernatural today the devil is attacking the children of God with his anointing right do you believe there is two anointing on the same ground the anointing of God and the anointing of the devil amen we are in the spiritual Garden of Eden both spirit of God and the spirit of devil both are present there two anointing on one ground but thank God for his word amen thank God for his promise he says the Lord has promised us in the last days he will pour out his Spirit his anointing Over All Flesh right what God had he poured it all in Christ what Christ had he poured it in us and the Lord wants to bless us yes brothers sisters we need success we need victory in our life we need to live under the anointing of the supernatural the prophet said in the message the supernatural he said oh if you could say that about our churches today I would to God that you could come under the influence that I live under and my church lives under for we believe that God Is A Healer we believe that God is a savior we believe that God gives the Holy Spirit and I would to God that I live under the anointing if you can only testify or witness is the Lord my friend my brother I live under that anointing amen God wants us to live in the Supernatural the prophet said there are many people today that doesn't know that Jesus Christ is still alive they don't know that he still rules and Reigns true they don't know that the blood of Calvary for all the all sufficient see he purchased the the cross for your transgression and for your healing they don't know that that's the real today yes what we need to do we need to live in that Supernatural we need to live under that anointing so that we can strengthen someone else we can live for someone else what is eternal life the prophet said it is living for others how will you live for others how will you comfort others how will you strengthen others when you you yourself were totally transformed totally converted amen when that 120 gathered in that Upper Room when that true conversion happened do you believe it was the same Peter before the Pentecost no when that fire struck him yeah when he was filled with the Holy Ghost he was a changed man right yes sir what God spoke about him he said until thou be converted then strengthen thy brother my brothers my sister not only him but everyone who was present in that Upper Room who were they they were World Changers they changed the destiny of the whole world Amen why because they came in an encounter with the Holy Ghost that's right and that's what we need today we need to come into encounter with the Holy Ghost you might say brother boys I I was encountered with the Holy Ghost 25 years ago oh that was 25 years ago that was 25 weeks ago my brothers my sister we need Holy Ghost now we need Holy Ghost every day yes we cannot depend on the victory of yesterday we need Victory now we need Victory tomorrow amen we need transformation every day he sore by himself he said then you're here to fulfill it just walk unconscious of fear unconscious of criticism unconscious unto the world walk with God not paying any attention right or left hand just keep on moving if something comes up in the church walk with God hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep on Walking with God Amen trials and tests will come in our life the trials will shake us I have seen brother John the devil is not after everybody he's only after the people who are in this message I'm telling you especially the pastor's family he's after me and my family I want to tell you sometimes he shakes us I want to tell you it's the goodness of God the grace of God am I always say you know I always tell my wife you know she ask me how can you withstand this kind of trial and trouble you are going through so many responsibilties too much on your plate no I always say first it's the grace of God and I said then everyone is many of them is praying for me amen amen that's true you don't realize we don't realize but there are times the prayers who are praying for us is keeping us safe grace of God is there but I'm praying for you you are praying for me you are praying for me I'm praying for you and that prayers Works look at that same Peter he was in the prison the next morning he was going to be given to Herod but what was the church doing the church was praying amen my brothers my sister prayer there are three things which we need to do today one is prayer two is prayer three is prayer so that our shackles will be gone we will be out of the prison bars right and the devil always want you to be in that prison he doesn't want you to have freedom amen and if you want freedom today we need to live in the Supernatural the atmosphere of the supernatural job was tried and but thank God he was tested he received the double portions of God's blessing amen he SW by himself he said you will have your ups and downs you will have your ups and downs don't worry you got to go through Brier patches over sharp rocks over Bluffs down over the hillside up through the mountains over Waters but walk with God yes sir yes there's so many Hills to climb upward you heard the whole song but how little it seem when you get to the end of the way you know every ups and downs every trials in our life in your life whether it is big or small or huge or massive at the end of the road when you look back everything seems to be very little for the victory which God has given to us yes amen for the reward which God has given to us which he has set for us we will have our upside downs we will be sifted as the wheat we will be shaken our Nest will be shaken amen but thank God for the Mighty Wings thank God for that Mighty Wings which God will take us through yes amen job was tested Peter was tested Joseph tried and tested and was blessed he did nothing wrong but was persecuted and hated by his own Brothers to the point of they sold him to slavery amen but one thing good about Joseph his situations changed but his spiritual position was always intact yes from Father's out to the pit pit to the slavery slavery to Piper's house Piper's house to the prison from prison to the throne his situation changed drastically but his spiritual position remained intact as he was faithful in his father's house he was faithful in the prison and in the throne that is all we are talking about no matter what you go through in your life today you need to be steadfast in your faith I always brother every morning I pray that prayer when I get up in the morning he said Lord no matter how many trials and test you will take me through or you will allow the enemy to take me through I want to keep my faith amen I Don't Want to Lose My Faith right Joseph situation changed but his spiritual position remained Inta look at Jesus Matthew 4:10 he says he took him to the highest Pinacle he said worship me I'll give you everything what did Jesus say away from me Satan for it is written Worship the Lord your God and serve him only God has given us the armor the invisible armor and we all need to put it on so that we can fight the enemy in the battle and I want to tell you brothers sisters out of life's experience I'm saying the more the Devil comes to you in force with the same Force you approach the devil amen one little step behind will destroy you but thank God for the Holy Ghost today amen I can boldly say I got the Holy Ghost amen we should be in that position today yes Lord thank you for giving me the Holy Ghost it is the Holy Ghost which can do great things in our life that's why we sing that song it's the Holy Ghost and Fire that's keeping me alive amen keeping me alive keeping me alive it's the fire of God it's the spirit of God it's the power of God it's the anointing of God which is trying to keep us alive today keep us walking in God Amen we need total conversion we need total transformation you know what First Corinthians 55 says it talks about the disobedient to be handed over to the enemy that's true if we don't pay attention to the warnings of God God himself will hand over us into the hands of the Mammon hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh flesh so that his Spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord brothers sisters we should be aware of the Trap today the Trap of the enemy the Trap Of Satan 2 Corinthians 2:1 says in order that Satan should not out with us for we are not unaware of his schemes right his devices we are not ignorant of his devices he wants to sift you as a wheat but thank God for the grace of God thank God for prayers thank God the prayers of our parents am brother John if I today holding this word of God is because of the prayers of my parents thank you Lord my friends which with whom I studied in Bombay most of my friends they are in world today they're in the big Mafia M underworld gangs few of them have been shot dead killed now and then when I go to Bombay if they come to know that I've come they come to meet me they tell me if you have any need just give us a call we will help you I always boldly tell them I have a great help amen amen and my Help Cometh From God Amen that's true brother sometimes I I miss my father and mother today they used to always pray for us children my daddy would cry out said Lord as I walk with you you let my children walk with you that's why this word of God this word of the spirit is in my hands today if I am able to make a change or a difference in the life of the poor people or people under me it's just because of the prayers of my parents it's God's grace am it's the Holy Ghost which has converted me which has transformed me which is allowing me to bring a change in somebody's life we cannot be ignorant of the schemes of the enemy look at another example about Paul and his life he was also tried so many times all his life if there was anybody who got more trials and test that was Paul but look what he says in the midst of all this he says I have kept the faith Paul lost his head they cut that off but it didn't touch his faith I got gooseb brother when I was reading that Paul lost his head they could touch his head but not his faith that's why he boldly said I have kept the faith I have fought a good fight amen he rejoiced in three things this great Apostle to the Gentiles what are those three things he said I have fought a good fight I have finished my course and I have kept the faith are we in that position today to say that I have fought a good fire the other day brother John I went to a a cemetery a graveyard and there were people whom I know I saw their graves everybody has engraved I have fought a good fight of faith and you know I've kept my faith and when you see their life they were big drunkards they were worldly people they were they were big Sinners they did not even care for the church for the word of God they did not live right but when they are dead the family members have engraved yeah but if you can really sit and think are we in a position today to say what Paul said think about it I think all the time I have fought a good fight finished my course and I have kept the faith what did all the rest amount to he said I count it all zero I count it all nothing I count it all as D Paul won the race Paul gained the prize Paul has the admiration of Earth today and also the admiration of Heaven the whole earth is rejoicing about Paul today the whole Heaven also rejoiced about Paul why do we not act as if it paid to lose all to win Christ why are we not loyal to truth as Paul was you know we don't have his mathematics that's true what he counted we can't count it the same way he counted differently from us we count the things gained that he counted loss we must have his faith and keep it if we could wear the same Crown before I close I want you to think on this lines are we fighting that good fight are we in that race or are we going to finish that course how are we keeping the faith my brothers my sisters Prophet said we are living in the end time and the Revival fires are burning low yes amen puru and is say Revival doesn't last very long but this has been going for years because it's last Revival I believe and that we are right at the end time but he says but we can see the Revival fire is burning down low the interest of the people everybody is tired going to sleep interest is gone and to see this much interest among the people here it Thrills me and know that there is still fire burning and he says let's fan it tonight just have as we can with the word and the word when you fan it will produce the Holy Spirit right the rushing Mighty Wind that will start the fire burning again he says may the Lord grant it to you what we need today I can sit here for the whole day and talk to you but what do we really need what more we need from God we always pray for Lord this give me this give me that give me this give me that but seldom we say Lord give me the Holy Ghost right seldom we say Lord let me walk with you Faithfully let me love you let me serve you Faithfully true our list is so big brother John from night morning to night we can say Lord give me this do this do this do this we Are Always On Demand let us sit down and think and say Lord I want to walk with you no matter anybody walk with me or not I want to walk with you nobody anybody love you or not I want to love you I want to serve you I want to be faithful to you even if my husband walks with you or not walk with me or not I want to walk with you my wife walks with me or with you no matter I will walk with you my parents my children God is looking for a total conversion Total Transformation and what God wants us to have is the power of the holy spirit amen God wants us to live under that anointing so that every shackle Every Chain will be broken today my brothers my sisters there are chains powerful chains we are tied of we can't see but we are chained and that's that those chains needs to be broken amen nothing can break it except the power of the Holy Ghost until and unless we live in that Supernatural walk in that Supernatural live in that Supernatural we can't be a blessing to anybody how many of you want to be blessed blessing to others I want to be a blessing to someone but before I could be a blessing I myself should have that blessing before I could comfort somebody with the word of God I need to have the word of God in my life David said I hid Thy word in my heart oh God until and unless you become the fountain of Living Water how can you give water to somebody how can you quench The Thirst how can you fulfill The Thirst of somebody God wants total conversion today when he comes he's not going to look for anything else all he's going to see is will he finds Faith that's very important without faith it is impossible to please God he's not after anything he's after our faith the Lord he has chosen the heart but the devil he has chosen our mind yes amen that's the greatest battle today the battlefield of mine the coming of the Lord is very near my my brothers my sisters let us keep our faith intact I really like that word they could touch his head Paul's head but they could not touch his faith the devil can touch your body today look at Job even though the worms that's true eat away all my flesh yet I will that should be our position today no matter what may come or go right no matter how many situations change in my life amen Lord I will serve you amen I will walk with you Faithfully let us have a total conversion Total Transformation and let us live in the Supernatural right that is my humble message to the Bride of Jesus Christ the Church of the Living God Amen as the church Banner says send the light amen I really like that that name of the church send the light how can you send the light if your life is in darkness right yes if you need to send the light you yourself needs to become that light what is light the Vindicated spoken word of God Amen is the light of this hour true so true the prophet said don't live in the glare of another light don't live in the glare of another age walk in the light because Jesus is that light amen I pray that we will all meet him in the Rapture I want to see you all in heaven amen but if you don't want to see me that's your problem I really want to see you all am let us walk with him Faithfully with all our heart and serve him and love him every day may the Lord bless you thank you so much for your love and for your prayers and for your kind sacrifices from time to time thank you brother John for your love and for your prayers God bless you all [Applause] amen amen let's Stand Together how may appreciate that word amen I really believe God is calling us and even though service is over and we're going to sing and go home I just say if God has spoken to your heart is dealing with you and you have a desire for a greater conversion I want you to come forward I want us to pray together our brothers here and I I think if we just put our foot down and say Lord this is the direction I want to go not just today but with my life amen I I I believe God will meet you you take one step towards God God will step towards you because you know coming up here won't bring the conversion right but bringing up here will will start a direction to bring the full conversion you understand what I'm saying don't put off tomorrow what we can do today it's easy to go home and just get you know get back in that life where we're doing our our things that we do and we're not really maybe thinking about the things that we were just subject to we're subject to the word today but we want that word to become more real to us amen and and and and I I just believe by faith that if you come towards God God come towards you and give you more of that Holy Spirit which will bring more of the conversion amen amen let's sing that that uh chor
