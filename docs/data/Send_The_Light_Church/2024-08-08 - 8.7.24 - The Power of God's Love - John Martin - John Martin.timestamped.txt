[32:31] Jesus is
[32:33] here
[32:35] Jesus is
[32:37] here all things are
[32:41] possible
[32:43] Jesus is
[32:46] here amen he's the he's the Difference
[32:50] Maker
[32:52] amen it is wonderful to be with one
[32:56] another amen
[32:58] it's more wonderful to be with God's
[33:01] people amen but there's
[33:04] nothing like being in the presence of
[33:08] God because he's here all things are
[33:11] possible and so we we just have to
[33:14] remember that for our need and we just
[33:17] you know often the devil wants us
[33:22] to um to decide to judge what we think
[33:26] is going to happen
[33:29] to be accurate in our our asset of how
[33:34] how things are going to go whether we're
[33:37] praying for somebody or what's going to
[33:39] happen during the service how are we
[33:40] going to feel the presence of God and we
[33:43] just need to
[33:44] believe that's it and and just take a
[33:48] stand with believing and trust God and
[33:51] and not have to listen to the enemy when
[33:54] he tries to trick us with that because
[33:56] all is he's trying to do is get us to
[33:57] doubt doubt right that's all he's trying
[33:59] to get us to do is doubt turn with me if
[34:01] you would to the book of St John chapter
[34:04] 3
[34:04] today we want to entitle this message
[34:07] the power of God's love and I was
[34:09] blessed to hear that song such love
[34:11] tonight
[34:14] amen
[34:19] amen uh before we begin reading the
[34:23] words of Jesus in in um
[34:28] St John chapter 3 Let's
[34:30] look um to God in just a word of prayer
[34:34] before we begin to service Heavenly
[34:37] Father we want to thank you for your
[34:41] presence Lord the power that's in your
[34:45] word you said that you would be present
[34:48] in the midst of just two or three that
[34:51] would be gathered in your
[34:53] name and Lord we thank you that you've
[34:55] always been true to your word
[34:58] you there will never be a
[35:01] time never was a time never will there
[35:04] be a time that you you had not been
[35:08] where two or three are gathered in your
[35:10] your name father this gives us
[35:12] confidence
[35:13] today Lord that the invisible God is
[35:16] amongst
[35:18] us that the angels are encamped about
[35:21] the train we believe is filling the
[35:24] temple Lord we are your believing
[35:26] children now we're coming to you in
[35:28] prayer to ask your blessings upon this
[35:30] service that you would prepare our
[35:32] hearts to receive your
[35:34] word Lord that we might be filled with
[35:38] comfort with
[35:40] strength Lord that we might be about
[35:42] your business when we leave the building
[35:45] today come and have your way inhabit our
[35:48] Praises receive our worship Lord as we
[35:51] say Amen to the word of God for we
[35:53] commit the service into your hands now
[35:56] we thank you for all these things
[35:58] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[36:03] as we know Nicodemus and Jesus had this
[36:06] talk and I want to pick up on verse
[36:09] number 12 and Jesus said if I have told
[36:13] you Earthly things and you believe not
[36:18] how shall you believe if I tell you
[36:20] Heavenly
[36:22] things and no man have ascended up to
[36:26] heaven but he that came down from heaven
[36:30] even the son of man which is in heaven
[36:34] and he's here he's standing on Earth
[36:38] saying he's in heaven showing that God
[36:41] and Jesus are the
[36:45] same now look at this as Moses lifted up
[36:49] the serpent in the
[36:52] wilderness what was
[36:54] that serpent for that lifting of the
[36:58] serpent it was to bring healing to the
[37:01] children of Israel and as Moses lifted
[37:04] up the serpent in the wilderness even so
[37:07] must the son of man be lifted
[37:10] up that whosoever believeth in him
[37:13] should not perish but have everlasting
[37:15] eternal life for God so loved the world
[37:20] that he gave his only begotten son that
[37:23] whosoever believeth in him should not
[37:27] perish
[37:28] but have everlasting life amen God bless
[37:31] you may be
[37:33] seated for God so loved the world that
[37:37] he gave he didn't make a deal with
[37:39] mankind he gave himself basically he
[37:43] sent out his love to mankind by
[37:46] sacrificing his life that we could have
[37:50] life Jesus said even as the son of man
[37:54] came not to be ministered unto
[37:58] but to minister and to give his life a
[38:01] ransom for many I want to say that in
[38:04] saying the message is the power of God's
[38:07] love God's love has so much power that
[38:10] it can
[38:13] Minister it doesn't always have to be
[38:16] ministered onto but it can Minister and
[38:19] I want to give you faith and confidence
[38:22] that you can minister to others amen
[38:25] Jesus said in John 10:10 I am come that
[38:28] they might have life and that they might
[38:30] have it more abundantly I am the Good
[38:32] Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his
[38:34] life for the
[38:36] Sheep it took power to
[38:40] give it's true that you can't kill
[38:44] God he he he cannot die he will never
[38:49] die but he created a
[38:52] body by the spoken
[38:56] word and
[38:58] and he put his life in that perfect body
[39:03] now that perfect body was what God was
[39:06] requiring because that's what he told
[39:08] Eve the day you eat the day you'll die
[39:11] and life was
[39:12] required and he loved us so much that he
[39:16] didn't want us to die he had a vision
[39:19] for us and so he took upon himself that
[39:24] he would bear the burden and he created
[39:26] that body he he tasted death for every
[39:28] man the Bible says and he gave himself a
[39:32] ransom for money for
[39:35] many Jesus said no man taketh it from me
[39:38] but I lay it down of myself I have power
[39:42] to lay it down and I have power to take
[39:44] it up this commandment have I received
[39:47] of my father so it takes power to lay
[39:51] down her
[39:52] life it takes a denial of our s it takes
[39:56] a giving up of our will it takes
[39:59] character I'll say it like this in
[40:01] Simplicity it takes the love of
[40:05] God our love is only so far it's only
[40:09] going to suffer so long it's only going
[40:11] to take so and finally it's going to say
[40:13] I quit our love quits always but God's
[40:17] love never quits it endures all things
[40:20] it believes all things it Bears all
[40:21] things it goes not only the Second Mile
[40:24] the third mile the fourth mile it keeps
[40:26] going it never never
[40:30] stops and this power is true love love
[40:34] was the motivation that God had behind
[40:37] his giving for God so loved the world
[40:41] that he gave you know he wasn't looking
[40:45] for anything for
[40:49] himself he was looking for
[40:52] us think about that our love when we go
[40:56] to love some body we're looking for
[40:58] something in return I better get a
[41:01] handshake I better get a I better get
[41:03] something out of this deal that I'm
[41:05] giving of myself otherwise I ain't got
[41:07] time for you I'm gonna go do what I want
[41:08] to
[41:10] do but
[41:13] God came down when we did not
[41:17] even know about him care about him we're
[41:21] just in our own life didn't want to be
[41:23] bothered it took God to get our
[41:25] attention am
[41:28] Ephesians 2 tells us that at one time ye
[41:33] were without Christ being aliens from
[41:35] the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[41:38] from the Covenant of the promise having
[41:40] no hope and without God in the world
[41:44] that was our
[41:45] condition Ephesians 2 turn with me if
[41:48] you would or put up on the board
[41:49] Ephesians 2 verse one we we were
[41:53] absolutely dead in our trespasses and
[41:55] sins
[41:57] we were goners we're we're heading right
[41:59] to hell we walked according to the
[42:02] course of this world according to the
[42:04] prince of the power of the air the
[42:05] spirit that now worketh in the children
[42:07] of
[42:10] Disobedience among whom also we all had
[42:14] our conversations in times past in the
[42:17] lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires
[42:19] of the Flesh and of the mind and by
[42:22] Nature the children are wrath even as
[42:25] others this was the condition of every
[42:29] single person that came to Jesus Christ
[42:32] and that is still the condition of every
[42:34] single person who doesn't come to Jesus
[42:37] Christ you don't grow out of
[42:40] this you just you just learn to be a
[42:42] little bit better of a
[42:44] deceiver right the older you get the
[42:47] more you know how to trick
[42:50] people we were helpless we were hopeless
[42:54] nothing but torment and Hell stood in
[42:57] front of us to come but verse but verse
[43:00] four says but God who is rich in Mercy
[43:05] for his great love wherewith he loved
[43:10] us my aren't you so glad he didn't send
[43:13] some little letter Down to Earth on a
[43:15] plane or something and just say I love
[43:19] you I love you it wouldn't have done a
[43:23] thing he had to come down to earth and
[43:26] manif man EST his
[43:28] love and he did and and that love was
[43:31] full of Mercy it was rich in Mercy the
[43:35] treasures of his Mercy is so rich even
[43:39] when we were dead in sins have quickened
[43:43] us together with
[43:47] Christ ah when I think of that that's
[43:50] that that statement quickened
[43:54] together with Christ
[43:58] remember Christ is in
[43:59] heaven we're on Earth We're Earthly
[44:02] beings he's a Heavenly being and he does
[44:06] something to our lives he does something
[44:09] to our nature that puts us in the same
[44:13] plane that Christ is the same love the
[44:16] same nature the same
[44:18] character there's a a quickening that
[44:22] happens and then he says by Grace you're
[44:24] saved and has raised us up together
[44:28] notice together and made us sit together
[44:32] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus well
[44:36] we know God is
[44:39] love brother Brandon said when he went
[44:41] behind the curtain at time he said
[44:43] nothing but perfect love would would be
[44:45] able to enter there because he said
[44:47] that's all that was there that was his
[44:50] description of heaven and so when we're
[44:53] caught up into Heavenly places we're
[44:55] caught up in his love
[44:58] come on we're caught up in the love of
[45:01] God and and that should do something to
[45:04] us because now we're sitting together
[45:07] we're no longer we're here and he's
[45:11] there it's no it is it's no longer us
[45:15] trying to put peacock feathers in we
[45:17] become like Christ Our nature becomes
[45:20] like him something happens inside of the
[45:24] believer notice Paul said for
[45:28] God's great love God's great
[45:33] love Jesus said no greater
[45:38] love has a man than this than a man laid
[45:42] down his life for
[45:44] who his friends now notice when he came
[45:46] to every one of us we hated
[45:51] him we I don't know how long you did but
[45:55] I didn't jump at the gun and and say Yes
[45:57] Lord I want to lose my will and do
[46:02] yours I put them off I
[46:08] ignored but his he called me his friend
[46:12] because he knew down the road I would
[46:16] love
[46:20] him he called me friend before I called
[46:22] him friend
[46:27] wherewith he loved us when we were
[46:35] dead inside of God's great love was this
[46:40] Priceless Riches of
[46:42] mercy and mercy is not giving us what we
[46:46] do
[46:47] deserve we all deserve judgment we all
[46:50] deserve to go to hell there isn't just
[46:52] some there isn't just certain people
[46:54] that deserve to go
[46:57] right we all deserve to go but there's
[46:59] something that stepped in the way for
[47:01] you and me and that's called
[47:04] Mercy it stepped right there in the way
[47:07] and God had mercy on us and we're here
[47:09] today saying thank you Lord for the
[47:11] mercy you've given us inside God's great
[47:14] love was the Priceless Riches of his
[47:19] grace and that was giving us what we
[47:22] don't deserve we don't deserve eternal
[47:24] life we don't deserve Joy and peace and
[47:27] and love and we don't deserve heaven we
[47:31] don't we'll never deserve
[47:34] it that's why we should always feel in
[47:37] debt to
[47:42] God that was a problem with Lucifer he
[47:46] felt that something was old to
[47:50] him look at the trouble I got him
[47:53] into when we take time to consider what
[47:57] God did for us individually it should
[47:59] fill us with a renewed gratitude on a
[48:02] daily
[48:03] basis that's why we need to keep our
[48:06] eyes on Calvary we need to be
[48:10] thankful until God completes the work
[48:14] inside of us don't be just satisfied
[48:18] with with what God did that he paid the
[48:21] price for your salvation at
[48:24] Calvary but God has a greater interest
[48:27] involved and that is he wants to see his
[48:30] nature inside of you he wants to take
[48:32] out your old nature and put his in
[48:35] you and what's standing in the way
[48:37] brother Randon said we're we're our
[48:39] greatest
[48:41] enemy second Peter 1 says that if we
[48:45] give all diligence to keep adding Christ
[48:48] to our lives then we'll remain fruitful
[48:51] in growing is that what it says but if a
[48:54] Believer doesn't have the mindset of
[48:57] continuing to add to their lives in a
[49:00] spiritual way then they are spiritually
[49:03] blind and Cann not see a far off and is
[49:06] even forgotten that he was purged from
[49:09] his own
[49:11] sins me we can forget about Calvary
[49:14] pretty fast when we stop adding Christ
[49:18] to our our need to go to church our need
[49:20] to pray our need to get in the taste our
[49:22] need to get closer to God our need to
[49:24] reach out to other people when we lose
[49:28] that then we just become a regular old
[49:33] churchgoer what's the
[49:35] remedy he said give diligence to make
[49:39] your calling and your election sure for
[49:43] if you do these things you shall never
[49:47] fall I say let's give diligence let's
[49:51] keep adding let's look at our life and
[49:53] be honest what did I do wrong today what
[49:56] do I need a character changing and let's
[49:58] get serious with God
[50:03] Amen notice now what this love does in
[50:07] the human heart it quickens us together
[50:09] with Christ it raises us up makes us to
[50:12] sit with him in Heavenly places we're
[50:14] not the same anymore we have a hope at
[50:17] one time we had no hope but now we have
[50:19] a hope and I'll say it like this when
[50:22] you're caught up into a realm of
[50:25] heavenly love yeah now notice that love
[50:28] is it's without respect to persons it's
[50:31] not looking in anything into return it's
[50:35] it's a place of perfect love and I'll
[50:38] say you talk about
[50:42] security there's Security in the love of
[50:45] God there's no security in the love of
[50:47] John
[50:49] Martin I I'll just be honest with you
[50:52] somewhere down the line John Martin
[50:57] is not Jesus
[50:58] Christ can I say it like that but Jesus
[51:02] Christ will always be Jesus
[51:04] Christ we're in the midst of becoming
[51:06] more like him coming into His
[51:09] Image so our eyes stayed on the word our
[51:12] eyes stayed on what really perfect love
[51:14] is but there is security he will never
[51:17] fail you he will never leave
[51:19] you Romans 8:35 says who shall separate
[51:22] us from the love of Christ shall
[51:25] tribulation or dest or persecution or
[51:28] famine or nakedness or Peril I don't
[51:31] care what what we go
[51:37] through who shall separate us from the
[51:40] love of Christ there is only one person
[51:42] that can separate you from the love of
[51:44] Christ and that is
[51:47] you you getting in the way of letting
[51:51] God perfectly love through you amen when
[51:56] you're you're caught up into this realm
[51:59] where you know that you are you are
[52:01] loved by the greatest
[52:03] person someone that will he'll never
[52:06] he'll you you you're in the palm of his
[52:08] hand no man can pluck you from the
[52:10] father's hands when you know you're
[52:13] there it don't matter what's happening
[52:15] down here it just doesn't matter because
[52:18] you're being kept up
[52:20] here as it is written as it is written
[52:23] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[52:25] long
[52:26] so get used to the tribulation get used
[52:29] to the stress get used to the
[52:31] persecution for these things are there
[52:35] they're they're they're God is working
[52:37] in together to kill us all day long we
[52:40] are counted as sheep for the slaughter
[52:43] but you know it doesn't matter nay in
[52:45] all these things we're more than
[52:48] conquerors through him that loved us for
[52:51] I am persuaded that neither death nor
[52:53] life nor angels principalities Powers
[52:56] things present nor things to come nor
[52:59] height nor depth nor any other
[53:03] creature shall be able to separate us
[53:07] from what the love of
[53:11] God the love of God now notice where
[53:14] that love is it's in Christ
[53:22] Jesus the love of
[53:25] God is isn't in John
[53:28] Martin the love of God is in God is in
[53:33] Christ Jesus who is in John
[53:35] Martin do you
[53:38] understand because John Martin cannot uh
[53:41] peacock the love of
[53:44] God you can't you cannot get warmed by a
[53:48] painted fire you either got the heat
[53:51] coming out of you it's either real or
[53:52] it's
[53:53] not it is willing to lay down its life
[53:56] or it selfish is all get
[53:58] out you with me are you are you getting
[54:02] what I'm trying to say because you know
[54:04] so often we you know we yes we have love
[54:07] and and yes we have God but look here is
[54:10] the word to tell you where you're
[54:14] standing because if you're laying down
[54:16] your life that's
[54:18] God if you're giving of yourself that's
[54:21] God but if I'll do this but I don't want
[54:24] to go too far because
[54:26] you know let's identify what that is is
[54:28] that
[54:31] God you know Jesus taught us 7times
[54:37] 70 you know some Christians only want to
[54:41] use that scripture for their
[54:43] benefit come on are you with me I'm
[54:46] going to quote the word if it's going to
[54:47] be benefited to me but don't I don't
[54:49] want to be accountable to actually
[54:52] laying down my life stimes 70 for
[54:54] somebody else
[54:56] I am telling you that love that you're
[54:58] possessing you'll soonly be separated in
[55:02] some test or trial we need the love of
[55:05] God nothing but perfect love can enter
[55:08] in there and we can't be satisfied with
[55:09] what we have we got to press on for more
[55:11] brother Brom says get to the place where
[55:13] you can love everyone even your enemy
[55:16] get to that place it takes work it takes
[55:18] effort it takes a vision it takes a
[55:20] heart to want to get where God wants us
[55:22] to get instead of
[55:25] just I love
[55:31] God are you with
[55:34] me there is power in God's love to lift
[55:38] us up into a Heavenly realm to where we
[55:42] are
[55:44] secure to where we can say nothing shall
[55:48] separate us from the love of
[55:50] Christ there's nothing to fear when
[55:54] you're filled with God's
[55:58] love when you don't have God's love it's
[56:03] easy to get
[56:06] scared because we're down here and
[56:08] understand we live in this world we have
[56:10] to live in this world right we have to
[56:12] deal with
[56:14] problems but we're not of the
[56:17] world we've been quickened and yes we
[56:20] got to Die daily we got to get in his
[56:22] presence daily but you know fear is not
[56:25] part of the believer's overcoming
[56:31] armor fear is is is something to stand
[56:35] in the way from being an
[56:38] overcomer now here's the sad news fear
[56:40] is not going
[56:42] away fear is increasing in the world
[56:45] fear is here to stay the Bible says that
[56:49] in the last days Jesus said that men's
[56:52] Hearts would be failing for fear right
[56:56] it's not going away people are being
[56:58] succumbed by the bombardment of fear
[57:01] it's a
[57:07] realness but fear is not a part of the
[57:13] believer God is not taking fear out of
[57:16] the world we've got to face it head
[57:19] on we can't just whistle through the
[57:22] graveyard right we've got to have a
[57:25] genuine
[57:27] confidence that God is with
[57:30] us we've got to get back up on the horse
[57:34] when we get bucked off we've got to say
[57:37] I shall not be
[57:39] moved I remember when I was young your
[57:43] how do I say that I think last year I
[57:46] was I feel like I was young last year
[57:48] you know what I'm
[57:51] saying I remember getting bucked off a
[57:53] horse one
[57:54] time and it
[57:57] hurt where I landed how I
[58:01] landed and I was laying there on the
[58:03] ground and I was being laughed at by
[58:06] those
[58:07] around and you want to know something I
[58:09] was
[58:11] intimidated by the situation by what
[58:13] that horse did to
[58:15] me I did not have this overwhelming
[58:18] feeling oh you know what I want to get
[58:20] back on that horse because I want to get
[58:22] thrown
[58:24] again but I'll say say it like this the
[58:27] Bible says if a righteous man falls
[58:28] seven times seven times he'll get back
[58:31] up
[58:33] amen there's just something inside of a
[58:37] believer that isn't going to stay down
[58:39] in the mud that God brought him out
[58:43] of I'll tell you I know this what we
[58:47] call the end
[58:49] time there are people who are not going
[58:52] to come into it there are people are
[58:54] going to come into it that's all they're
[58:56] going to do and there's people that are
[58:58] to come in and they're going to become
[58:59] it they're going to be Overcomers
[59:02] there's going to be a bride that comes
[59:03] out of this message they're going to
[59:05] take the word of God seriously too many
[59:07] people have lowered their standards of
[59:09] well if I just make it to church or or
[59:11] if I just do this and they feel content
[59:14] with that when God has called us to a
[59:16] Heavenly place a place of perfect
[59:24] love we got to
[59:26] Shake the Dust
[59:28] off get back
[59:31] up it's okay to do
[59:35] that it is not okay to stay down and
[59:37] fake it you're only hurting
[59:42] yourself and those around
[59:45] you I think people need
[59:49] you people need
[59:51] you but if you're so caught up in your
[59:54] own life how can you you help
[59:59] others so in the midst of everything
[1:00:02] that go is going on in your life that
[1:00:04] will go on in your life simply fear
[1:00:09] not fear not it's a choice Jesus said
[1:00:12] fear not it's the father's good pleasure
[1:00:14] to give you the the the kingdom when the
[1:00:16] angel would always come he would say
[1:00:18] fear not we have a
[1:00:20] choice I like that I don't have to fear
[1:00:25] I I can be fear
[1:00:28] free let's go to church for a moment
[1:00:31] Psalms 23:1 it's the psalm of David the
[1:00:34] Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[1:00:39] what a good way to come to
[1:00:41] church with a good
[1:00:44] attitude God already knows what we have
[1:00:47] need of so just seek first the kingdom
[1:00:50] and all the things shall be added
[1:00:53] amen he maketh me me to lie down in
[1:00:58] Green
[1:01:01] Pastures he leadth me beside Still
[1:01:04] Waters I I just I you know I remember
[1:01:07] the prophet telling
[1:01:10] me that a Christian he can't wait to get
[1:01:16] to the house of the
[1:01:18] Lord something inside of him he can't
[1:01:22] wait to get there you know what that is
[1:01:26] that's he making me lay down in Green
[1:01:29] Pastures that's that's god in me uh uh
[1:01:33] putting me before Still
[1:01:35] Waters because otherwise think about it
[1:01:38] if that desire isn't there is no
[1:01:40] different than when we were in the world
[1:01:42] no
[1:01:44] different I mean just because we're a
[1:01:46] Christian we're saved that doesn't mean
[1:01:48] that we shouldn't have a hunger and a
[1:01:49] thirst for more of the word right
[1:01:52] there's a reason there's a reason he
[1:01:55] he's making us like down in Green
[1:01:56] Pastures because the he wants to get us
[1:01:58] at a place where we can become just
[1:02:01] still enough to hear from
[1:02:04] him I made mention that any spirit that
[1:02:08] would lead you to miss church is not the
[1:02:10] leadership of the Holy Ghost the
[1:02:13] leadership of the Holy Ghost is to come
[1:02:16] together all the more as you see the day
[1:02:19] approaching now that's God's spirit
[1:02:20] that's his
[1:02:22] leadership all the more we need to be
[1:02:24] getting together
[1:02:27] he restoreth my
[1:02:30] soul wow isn't that
[1:02:34] beautiful he leadth me he leadth me in
[1:02:37] the paths of righteousness for his
[1:02:40] name's
[1:02:43] sake that means we're going to be going
[1:02:45] down some right paths
[1:02:46] amen some some some some better paths
[1:02:49] that we're
[1:02:51] in you may say your Soul's been restored
[1:02:55] but God saying I'm still working on
[1:02:58] you amen all may be well with your soul
[1:03:02] but God is still working with you amen
[1:03:07] so when you look at one another when you
[1:03:09] look at me as your pastor I want you to
[1:03:12] know God is still working on
[1:03:15] me amen yay though I walk through the
[1:03:18] valley of the shadow of death getting
[1:03:20] back to this I will fear no evil
[1:03:26] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[1:03:31] staff they comfort
[1:03:35] me we can walk through any situation
[1:03:38] without
[1:03:40] fear if we can walk through the valley
[1:03:43] of the Shadow
[1:03:45] death if we can walk
[1:03:48] through to the other side if we can walk
[1:03:52] through this this Valley of deny in
[1:03:56] ourself and giving God the steering
[1:03:58] wheel of our
[1:04:00] life if we can give up the our
[1:04:04] will we can certainly stand and tell the
[1:04:06] devil I don't fear
[1:04:10] you I am not being moved by what you're
[1:04:13] bringing to my
[1:04:15] mind God is love and love is with me
[1:04:18] I've been caught up into a Heavenly
[1:04:21] realm I will fear no evil thy rod and
[1:04:26] thy staff they Comfort Me Jesus said as
[1:04:28] many as I love I rebuke and chasen so
[1:04:33] when God takes the rod and he he brings
[1:04:35] a correction and honestly let's just be
[1:04:42] honest I've been corrected by human
[1:04:48] beings and I have felt horrible after
[1:04:54] correction but you know
[1:04:56] even in God's
[1:04:58] correction there's
[1:05:01] love if he told us to speak the truth in
[1:05:06] love I think he lives
[1:05:08] it so I'm just saying the rod of
[1:05:12] Correction is nothing to fear There's an
[1:05:15] actual comfort in
[1:05:17] it I mean when when certain people you
[1:05:20] know would go to correct you try to try
[1:05:23] to say something behind your back or
[1:05:25] something like that they're not even
[1:05:28] they don't even have
[1:05:31] love but when God is trying to correct
[1:05:33] us from the pulpit that's love there's
[1:05:36] love behind that he's caring about our
[1:05:42] soul so David he said I will I will fear
[1:05:47] no
[1:05:48] evil there's no evil about this
[1:05:51] situation so whether God's Rod of
[1:05:57] correction is coming to us it's coming
[1:05:59] from a a a a heart of Love or he's
[1:06:03] giving us his promises as a rod a staff
[1:06:07] to lean on and say I Take God at his
[1:06:09] word I'm leaning upon this either way
[1:06:12] it's coming from a god of love whether
[1:06:16] it's promises or this is the Commandment
[1:06:18] I want you to do are you with me amen
[1:06:23] thou preparest a table before me in the
[1:06:26] presence of my
[1:06:28] enemies so get over
[1:06:32] it God is not taking the enemies
[1:06:35] away he didn't say pluck the tears out
[1:06:40] wait keep them there you know we're
[1:06:42] going to grow we're going to mature
[1:06:43] we're going to become more like Christ
[1:06:45] we're going to Bear the fruit of God at
[1:06:47] the same time that others who choose not
[1:06:51] to get serious with
[1:06:54] God but I'm going to tell you this enemy
[1:06:57] who that real enemy
[1:06:59] is it's our ungodly worldly
[1:07:02] nature that's the real enemy so we come
[1:07:05] to church we had a bad
[1:07:08] day we flew off the
[1:07:10] handle we got
[1:07:13] upset and we come right in church out of
[1:07:16] obedience to to Jesus
[1:07:19] Christ we sit
[1:07:21] there in the midst with this greatest
[1:07:25] enemy that we ever had you know what
[1:07:28] happens God prepares spiritual food for
[1:07:30] your spiritual
[1:07:32] life he anoints your
[1:07:35] head with the mind of Christ be not
[1:07:39] conformed to this world but be
[1:07:40] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:07:42] and God begins to renew your mind he
[1:07:45] doesn't just want to forgive us for what
[1:07:47] happened today he wants to show us what
[1:07:49] we need to do to be real true Overcomers
[1:07:52] tomorrow
[1:07:55] he fills our unworthy
[1:07:58] vessel with his oil so we express joy
[1:08:01] unspeakable and full of Glory I mean I
[1:08:04] believe in a cup running
[1:08:06] over I believe we ought to have that if
[1:08:09] it ain't running over we got to get some
[1:08:11] in there get some more in there we've
[1:08:14] all been guilty of pouring something
[1:08:16] into a cup and we poured too
[1:08:18] much
[1:08:20] right
[1:08:24] and come many times he had a cup
[1:08:27] somebody poured coffee at a
[1:08:30] restaurant poured it into your
[1:08:34] cup whoa what' you do that for
[1:08:37] whoa but you know what we want God to
[1:08:40] fill our
[1:08:41] cup we're longing for him to fill our
[1:08:44] cup because there's where the real Joy
[1:08:47] is at in the presence of God surely
[1:08:50] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[1:08:52] the days of my life and I will dwell
[1:08:56] in the house of the
[1:08:59] Lord you know whenever I can make
[1:09:04] it there's something going on here
[1:09:07] there's a real love relationship
[1:09:11] here surely goodness and mercy shall
[1:09:14] follow me all the days and I will dwell
[1:09:17] in the house of the Lord forever David
[1:09:20] said one time one thing if I desire to
[1:09:23] the Lord that why seek after that I may
[1:09:24] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[1:09:27] days of my
[1:09:28] life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:09:31] and to inquire in his
[1:09:33] Temple and he begins to deal with this
[1:09:36] fear that's
[1:09:38] around and he says though a host should
[1:09:41] encamp against me my heart shall not
[1:09:45] fear the war should rise up against me
[1:09:48] in this will I be confident confident in
[1:09:51] what I am going to meet God in his
[1:09:55] Tabernacle I know I know in whom I
[1:09:58] believe I know he's going to meet me
[1:10:00] there because that's where he dwells I'm
[1:10:03] not necessarily meaning a a building
[1:10:06] here what I am meaning is we ought to be
[1:10:10] abiding in the Tabernacle of the lord
[1:10:12] always amen amen for in the time of
[1:10:14] trouble he shall hide me in his pilion
[1:10:17] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[1:10:19] hide me he shall set me up upon a rock
[1:10:23] now I believe he has a revelation
[1:10:26] that's higher for every one of us a rock
[1:10:29] that is higher than us and now shall my
[1:10:31] head be lifted up above my enemies round
[1:10:33] about me therefore will I offer in his
[1:10:36] Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing
[1:10:39] yay I will sing praises unto the
[1:10:44] Lord when we receive the mind of Christ
[1:10:47] we are literally lifted up above our
[1:10:51] enemy but if we dwell with that carnal
[1:10:54] mindset even in
[1:10:56] church I am telling you you are not
[1:10:59] lifted above your
[1:11:01] enemy in fact you become an enemy of God
[1:11:04] because the carnal mind is enity with
[1:11:07] God Amen so we need what we need to do
[1:11:10] is stop feeding
[1:11:13] fear stop feeding fear because you can't
[1:11:16] stop it from coming but you can stop
[1:11:19] feeding
[1:11:21] it just starve
[1:11:24] it the more you commune with fear the
[1:11:27] bigger it gets the more you listen to a
[1:11:30] spirit of fear it gets a greater hold on
[1:11:32] you am and we just got to stop God has
[1:11:36] not given me the spirit of fear but of
[1:11:39] power and of love and of a sound mind
[1:11:43] and you know sometimes you just got to
[1:11:44] talk to the devil why because he talks
[1:11:46] to
[1:11:48] you now now now understand I don't
[1:11:51] really believe in having conversations
[1:11:54] with the devil but I want want to say
[1:11:56] this when we allow the devil to talk to
[1:11:59] us I think we need to talk to
[1:12:01] him you understand I'm saying if you
[1:12:04] gone through the course of the whole day
[1:12:05] and you're just listening to this stuff
[1:12:07] that the devil's telling you I think you
[1:12:08] need to take a
[1:12:10] stand in you because you got to confess
[1:12:12] it with your
[1:12:15] mouth but honestly if you haven't been
[1:12:17] listening to the devil I wouldn't give
[1:12:19] the devil's sent I wouldn't give him
[1:12:21] anything but when you sit there and you
[1:12:24] listen to the devil you know what you're
[1:12:25] doing you're entertaining
[1:12:27] him and you just got to take a you just
[1:12:30] got to say you know what I'm going to do
[1:12:32] what the word
[1:12:33] says I'm gonna think on these things I'm
[1:12:36] Gonna Keep My Mind stay on
[1:12:40] him because before you know it you'll be
[1:12:43] thinking
[1:12:48] evil now God has put within the believer
[1:12:53] something that can withstand and
[1:12:57] fear and that's his
[1:13:00] love the Bible said that God's love cast
[1:13:03] out all
[1:13:04] fear the power of God's love will cast
[1:13:08] out all fear now now my
[1:13:11] love your love doesn't cast out all
[1:13:17] fear
[1:13:19] now we've seen this before some some
[1:13:24] mother some father trying to bring
[1:13:27] Comfort to their child because they're
[1:13:30] afraid of something and they grab them
[1:13:33] and they hold them and they say oh
[1:13:36] everything's going to be okay and
[1:13:38] somebody just got shot somebody just got
[1:13:42] killed and they're saying everything's
[1:13:45] going to be okay we as humans we canot
[1:13:50] give our love to somebody that's going
[1:13:52] to cast out all fear but what you can
[1:13:56] give is God's
[1:13:58] love now that love can cast out all
[1:14:03] fear as Christ laid down his life for us
[1:14:07] he called us to lay down our lives for
[1:14:11] others and there's power in the love of
[1:14:14] God if you want more power we simply
[1:14:18] just need to seek more of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:20] because the love of God is shed abro in
[1:14:22] Heart by the Holy Ghost which is given
[1:14:24] to us
[1:14:26] fear has no place inside the believer's
[1:14:29] heart in
[1:14:31] fact with the love of God you can say I
[1:14:35] can do all things through Christ who
[1:14:37] strengthen
[1:14:39] me but with fear you sometimes maybe
[1:14:43] can't feel he can get out of a wet paper
[1:14:45] bag are you with me you know what I'm
[1:14:47] saying can't seem to hand on
[1:14:51] anything so we need to discipline oursel
[1:14:53] to put the word of of God first in our
[1:14:56] life I can do all things through the
[1:15:00] love of God through
[1:15:02] Christ he's the one that strengthens
[1:15:05] me I'm not
[1:15:07] able to take you
[1:15:11] through but I do believe that God
[1:15:14] through the office that he ordained can
[1:15:17] do
[1:15:18] it and you know it's all
[1:15:21] about I we so bad want to be like Christ
[1:15:24] right
[1:15:25] and I'm all for that but I am not for
[1:15:28] trying to make us like Christ we just
[1:15:30] need to become
[1:15:32] Christ to be honest I just get full more
[1:15:35] of God not try to not try to make
[1:15:38] ourself more like God but recognize we
[1:15:40] need to die out so we could become more
[1:15:42] like
[1:15:44] Christ brother Bon said in the message
[1:15:46] the everpresent water from The Rock he
[1:15:48] said and when we die our souls will go
[1:15:52] under the altar of God he said where I
[1:15:55] had where I was privileged to see a few
[1:15:58] mornings ago as you know in the vision
[1:16:02] where the Bible speaks of our spirits
[1:16:03] will go to God who gave it and our
[1:16:06] bodies shall return to the dust of the
[1:16:08] Earth but someday when the scripture is
[1:16:11] fulfilled our spirits will be released
[1:16:13] from God and pick up our souls and the
[1:16:18] soul to the body and the power that will
[1:16:21] raise us up is right in us
[1:16:29] now we got something in us that we don't
[1:16:34] realize we are now in Heavenly
[1:16:38] places we are now in the power of the
[1:16:42] Resurrection if there wasn't a law to
[1:16:46] that Sons and Daughters of God would
[1:16:48] create them a world out there and go
[1:16:52] live a private life on it
[1:16:56] you you have the power in you to do
[1:16:59] it if you got a shadow of the power of
[1:17:03] God in you you've got power to do it God
[1:17:05] is omnipotent see what I mean the power
[1:17:09] that's in you will make you could speak
[1:17:12] a world into existence and go live on it
[1:17:16] he says there you
[1:17:19] are now this is important because I want
[1:17:22] to I'm talking about the love of God if
[1:17:25] we've got power in us to go create a
[1:17:27] world and we know God is not in his word
[1:17:30] for us to go do that you understand but
[1:17:33] it is in his word for us to lay down our
[1:17:36] lives like he did for
[1:17:38] others so we got that power to do that
[1:17:42] you understand where I'm going with this
[1:17:43] to build your faith that's what the
[1:17:46] power is in the church now but it is
[1:17:49] controlled by a law and that law is not
[1:17:52] keeping a bunch of Commandments it it's
[1:17:55] a law of Faith Jesus said all things are
[1:17:57] possible to them that believe and if you
[1:18:00] can believe it whatever God will lead
[1:18:03] your soul to believe that is yours every
[1:18:08] place that The Souls of your feet can
[1:18:11] set upon by faith God gives it to you
[1:18:14] amen he said it's yours you possess it
[1:18:16] if you can find the key to this law of
[1:18:19] faith that opens it to you see what I
[1:18:22] mean the power is control by dot dot dot
[1:18:26] if you are a son of God a daughter of
[1:18:28] God that's that never leaves you oh I
[1:18:32] love that that never leaves you have a
[1:18:34] bad day it's still there it's with you
[1:18:37] at all time all the time but your faith
[1:18:41] gets away from it but it's still
[1:18:45] there I just say if you've got God
[1:18:49] you've got
[1:18:50] love and if you got love you got all the
[1:18:53] power that you
[1:18:55] need because there's no greater power no
[1:18:59] greater power because that power
[1:19:01] actually came down and saved you and
[1:19:07] me we have the scripture to love one
[1:19:10] another we've got the power to do that
[1:19:14] there's power in God's love power to
[1:19:16] overcome power to be patient power to be
[1:19:19] longsuffering power to be
[1:19:21] forbearing power to to go the second
[1:19:24] mile to to forgive others we got that
[1:19:28] power in us but just like we don't
[1:19:31] recognize that we have that power to
[1:19:33] create a world and go live on
[1:19:35] it we've got the power inside of us to
[1:19:38] create an atmosphere inside of us that
[1:19:41] we can love we can just get rid of our
[1:19:44] love and love with the love of
[1:19:47] God and it makes a
[1:19:50] difference God's love has power to lay
[1:19:52] down
[1:19:57] if God laid down his life then that same
[1:20:00] love inside of us can give us Grace as
[1:20:03] it did Jesus right father if it's
[1:20:06] possible let this cup pass from me he
[1:20:09] laid he said that he says that's why the
[1:20:11] father loves me because I lay down my
[1:20:14] life I mean if we want to find greater
[1:20:17] favor with God we got to lay down our
[1:20:18] life and I'll just say like this we've
[1:20:21] got if we've got power to lay it down
[1:20:24] we've got power for the
[1:20:25] resurrection
[1:20:27] amen our life our love barely lays down
[1:20:32] its own life for
[1:20:34] ourselves you know a lot of times we
[1:20:36] just get lazy we don't
[1:20:39] care most of the time we're looking for
[1:20:41] somebody else to lay down their life for
[1:20:44] us right fix this do this do
[1:20:48] this but John said in 1 John 3:16 hereby
[1:20:52] perceive we the love of God because he
[1:20:56] laid down his life for us we ought to
[1:20:58] lay down our lives for the
[1:21:00] Brethren I want you to think when was
[1:21:02] the last time you laid down your
[1:21:07] life I am not asking you when was the
[1:21:10] last time you did something for somebody
[1:21:13] because that's not what the scripture
[1:21:19] says it's easier for me to go do
[1:21:21] something than for me to lay down my
[1:21:23] life
[1:21:29] it takes the love of God in a human
[1:21:31] being to be willing to lay down their
[1:21:33] life for
[1:21:36] others but this is the standard this is
[1:21:38] what God has for
[1:21:40] us God's love inside of us is so
[1:21:44] powerful it can esteem others better
[1:21:46] than
[1:21:47] himself it can bear all things endure
[1:21:50] all things overcome all things it can
[1:21:53] bless them that curse you that persecute
[1:21:56] you that say all matter of evil against
[1:21:58] you the love of God in you can say I
[1:22:01] forgive
[1:22:02] you but you know what our love has to
[1:22:06] kind of let's figure this out because
[1:22:09] they kind of you know I remember they
[1:22:11] did that to me you know and I just I
[1:22:13] just know I just know they're going to
[1:22:15] do it again so you know
[1:22:17] what I'm just going to leave it between
[1:22:19] them and God you know what you just said
[1:22:22] God's not in you and you don't even
[1:22:24] realize it
[1:22:26] because God in you is the same yesterday
[1:22:28] today and forever he's never going to
[1:22:30] tell you to forgive somebody 7 time 70
[1:22:33] if he ain't going to do it himself in
[1:22:34] fact I'll use you as an
[1:22:37] example how many times have you
[1:22:43] fallen and look you're still here with
[1:22:45] the testimony that God forgave you that
[1:22:48] his blood is still as
[1:22:50] powerful well what was that blood that
[1:22:53] that blood was motivated by a
[1:22:57] love it's the love that was behind that
[1:23:00] blood that forgave us and set us here
[1:23:04] today just perfectly clean in the sight
[1:23:07] of God and God is just saying I want you
[1:23:10] to do that for one another I want you to
[1:23:12] do it for one
[1:23:14] another I I I don't want you to do it to
[1:23:16] where you think they're they're worthy
[1:23:18] of it but I want you to do it for those
[1:23:20] that you don't think are worthy that's
[1:23:22] right for those that don't use you why
[1:23:25] that you could be just like your
[1:23:26] heavenly father children just like your
[1:23:32] father I'll say this love is
[1:23:37] real just as the love of God quickened
[1:23:40] us together with Christ made us raise
[1:23:42] together caus us to sit together in
[1:23:44] Heavenly places with Jesus it changed
[1:23:47] our life basically did it not it was the
[1:23:51] love of God that changed our life that
[1:23:53] Same Love inside of
[1:23:55] us has the same
[1:23:59] power to help to lay down his life for
[1:24:03] others and to help others who are in a
[1:24:06] need of
[1:24:10] healing as Moses was lifted up in the
[1:24:13] wilderness so shall the son of man be
[1:24:16] lifted
[1:24:17] up if I be lifted up I'll draw all men
[1:24:21] unto
[1:24:22] me I'll tell you let God inside of
[1:24:26] you
[1:24:28] love be lifted up
[1:24:31] anybody can love those that love them
[1:24:34] Jesus
[1:24:35] said any anybody can be a friend to a
[1:24:41] friend but to love
[1:24:44] those that need a perfect
[1:24:49] love I I'll just say when you do conect
[1:24:54] with somebody that you can love with a
[1:24:57] perfect love you are sitting in a place
[1:25:00] that very few people
[1:25:03] sit God did not call us to be people
[1:25:07] down here on the planet that all we do
[1:25:09] is walk around with some badge saying
[1:25:11] I'm a Christian or I'm in the
[1:25:13] message God has called us to live a life
[1:25:16] he called us to live the
[1:25:18] message the prophet came to tell us what
[1:25:21] the real message is this is the real
[1:25:23] message he opened the book to us it's an
[1:25:26] open book we know what it means when he
[1:25:29] tells us to lay down our life we we must
[1:25:32] lay down our life so Christ can live
[1:25:34] inside of
[1:25:40] us God's love is shed
[1:25:44] abroad by the Holy Ghost I'll say every
[1:25:48] time we have an
[1:25:49] opportunity to get more Holy Ghost we
[1:25:53] ought to seek it
[1:25:57] I think this thing of well you know I'll
[1:25:59] just seek the Lord in my home and then
[1:26:01] you're at home it don't happen and then
[1:26:03] you say when I get to church I'll do it
[1:26:06] and then you get to church and you don't
[1:26:07] do it I tell you we need to take time is
[1:26:10] running out I'm running out of time to
[1:26:13] change I'm I'm running out of time for
[1:26:16] my nature to change and I need to take
[1:26:19] advantage I need to yield my life to him
[1:26:22] brother Bram taught us when love
[1:26:25] projects He said Sovereign Grace takes
[1:26:27] over I want to say it like this when
[1:26:29] love
[1:26:30] projects God takes care of the
[1:26:35] situation when love goes out and it's
[1:26:38] it's projected brother brandham says
[1:26:41] then it meets the object of what that
[1:26:44] love was intended for and meets the
[1:26:48] need all we have to do is to project
[1:26:52] love not as selfish
[1:26:55] love not I just want to do my bare bones
[1:27:00] minimum but give your all because it
[1:27:04] takes all to heal
[1:27:09] people it took god- giving everything to
[1:27:13] get healing for our
[1:27:16] souls now we can't save anybody but God
[1:27:18] in us
[1:27:20] can and they that win souls is wise and
[1:27:23] I say they that heal they that are
[1:27:24] willing to be lifted
[1:27:27] up in other words not their love but
[1:27:30] God's love in
[1:27:34] them God took the first step towards us
[1:27:39] when he went to Calvary we didn't even
[1:27:41] know God we didn't know know we doing he
[1:27:42] just had a
[1:27:44] vision and he took the first step
[1:27:46] towards
[1:27:48] us and he died for
[1:27:50] us and he he showed us that we need him
[1:27:54] we need salvation is only through Jesus
[1:27:58] Christ and he revealed himself to us and
[1:28:02] we came to know him through the love of
[1:28:04] God right it was his love that forgave
[1:28:08] us that we got to know God and he filled
[1:28:11] us with that love and I remember at the
[1:28:13] beginning I tell you I wanted to tell
[1:28:17] everybody I wanted to tell everybody
[1:28:19] what happened to
[1:28:21] me my life was changing
[1:28:26] and I'll tell
[1:28:28] you when others need you God is not
[1:28:33] asking you to wait till they come to you
[1:28:36] asking for
[1:28:38] help God is asking you to go out to them
[1:28:42] and lay down your life for
[1:28:46] them just like he
[1:28:48] did that's what it
[1:28:50] means Christ in you will do the same
[1:28:53] thing that he did 2,000 years
[1:28:56] ago he's the same yesterday to his
[1:28:59] character is not going to change now
[1:29:00] this I want to say after God revealed
[1:29:03] himself after he revealed himself he
[1:29:05] took the first step that he saved us you
[1:29:06] know what he said now if you want more
[1:29:08] of me you're going to have to take the
[1:29:09] first
[1:29:10] step you're going to have to draw nigh
[1:29:13] draw nigh unto God and he'll draw nigh
[1:29:16] unto
[1:29:18] you because it's a relationship it's not
[1:29:22] all God do for me it's us it's us doing
[1:29:25] for God and when we go draw nigh to God
[1:29:29] God is there's something inside of God
[1:29:31] that's saying you know I want you to be
[1:29:32] more like me I want you to do this this
[1:29:34] is what I'm going to have you do and he
[1:29:35] speaks that to you in prayer he shows it
[1:29:37] to you when you're when you're hearing
[1:29:39] the word when you're listening to a
[1:29:40] message something is being spoken and
[1:29:42] then you just say yes Lord and you know
[1:29:44] what that is when you obey that you know
[1:29:46] what you're doing you're drawing nigh to
[1:29:48] God drawing night to God isn't just
[1:29:51] praying that's the
[1:29:52] beginning but when he speaks to you and
[1:29:54] tells you what to do and you do it
[1:29:56] that's you draw a n to God God promised
[1:29:59] to draw a n to
[1:30:02] you take that first step towards others
[1:30:05] some having compassion making a
[1:30:07] difference the love of God constrains
[1:30:12] us it's a love
[1:30:16] relationship Jesus said a new
[1:30:18] commandment I give unto you that you
[1:30:20] love one another as I have loved
[1:30:22] you that you love one another and by
[1:30:27] this this love all men uh shall all men
[1:30:30] know you that you're my disciples in
[1:30:33] other words you're part of the
[1:30:37] family it's that one characteristic that
[1:30:40] knows that you are attached to God is
[1:30:43] the love of God is being able to love
[1:30:47] like God
[1:30:49] loves and I'll tell you this is a
[1:30:51] challenge for us but what I want us to
[1:30:53] do is I want us to actually start trying
[1:30:56] to do
[1:30:58] it and you got to stretch it I mean if
[1:31:01] you want to build your muscles you got
[1:31:02] to
[1:31:03] stretch right you want to get stronger
[1:31:06] you got to start
[1:31:08] exercising faith is the same way I'm
[1:31:11] gonna say this love is the same way love
[1:31:14] ain't going to be a
[1:31:18] gift it's not if it was then why don't
[1:31:20] we all have
[1:31:22] it you you you you've got to exercise it
[1:31:26] in other words you wait till the next
[1:31:29] time somebody doesn't do just something
[1:31:31] perfect but genuinely love
[1:31:35] them it's okay if they don't love you
[1:31:38] back what matters is that you're
[1:31:41] exercising loving like Jesus did because
[1:31:43] that's what he
[1:31:45] said John 158 herein is my father
[1:31:48] glorify that you bear much fruit so
[1:31:50] shall you be my disciples as the father
[1:31:53] have love me so have I loved you
[1:31:55] continue in my love so that's what we
[1:31:58] just saying if you keep my Commandments
[1:32:00] you shall abide in my love even as I
[1:32:02] kept my father's Commandments and abide
[1:32:03] in his his love now these things have I
[1:32:06] spoken unto you that your joy might
[1:32:08] remain in you and that your joy might be
[1:32:10] full this is my commandment that you
[1:32:13] love one another as I have loved you and
[1:32:15] greater love have no man than this in
[1:32:18] other words we're going to keep
[1:32:19] practicing brother Dennis
[1:32:22] until we lay down our lives for our
[1:32:26] friends you just keep practicing it
[1:32:28] until you can do
[1:32:32] it you can't find a greater love than
[1:32:38] this if you want to prove how much of
[1:32:41] God's love you have well I say do not
[1:32:45] use your
[1:32:47] mouth use your
[1:32:49] life let your life bring forth the fruit
[1:32:52] that God is asking for
[1:32:54] amen Greater Love have no man this and a
[1:32:58] man laid on his life for his friends you
[1:32:59] are my friends if you do whatsoever I
[1:33:04] have commanded

[1:33:57] internet
[1:33:59] about downgrading others and how great
[1:34:01] certain ones are just trying to make
[1:34:04] others feel like less than what they are

[1:34:20] the most is it is it is it is it is it
[1:34:23] China is it is it America is it Russia I
[1:34:26] don't think they're in it this year but
[1:34:27] you understand I'm trying to say it's
[1:34:29] who has the the most who's the
[1:34:33] greatest you know what I really love I
[1:34:36] love the spe Special
[1:34:39] Olympics we've all heard the stories
[1:34:41] we've seen the
[1:34:43] clips these these kids that are got
[1:34:46] something wrong with their
[1:34:48] lives that they they they they're
[1:34:51] not as normal as is what we would say
[1:34:54] you and I
[1:34:55] are and they'll just they'll line up on
[1:34:59] the
[1:35:00] race getting ready to go wait for that
[1:35:02] gun and they all take off just as fast
[1:35:05] as they
[1:35:06] can and you know it's
[1:35:09] like there's it it's it's it's just not
[1:35:14] the same as the the Paris
[1:35:17] Olympics but they're going they're going
[1:35:19] so fast and they're they're getting
[1:35:22] ready to cross the line and they they
[1:35:24] notice one of their fellow
[1:35:27] Runners has
[1:35:29] fallen and instead of just finishing the
[1:35:33] race right there and winning they stop
[1:35:36] and they go
[1:35:37] back you know what they do they forget
[1:35:41] about
[1:35:42] winning and they're picking
[1:35:46] up someone else who had
[1:35:50] fallen they get them up and they walk
[1:35:53] welcome to the Finish
[1:35:56] Line you
[1:35:58] know these
[1:36:01] people who we call special I'll tell you
[1:36:03] what makes them
[1:36:05] special is they don't have so much self
[1:36:10] centeredness inside of
[1:36:12] them they don't care about themselves as
[1:36:15] much as people who are out without
[1:36:20] problems and I think that's the same way
[1:36:22] it is with those who are filled with the
[1:36:24] love of
[1:36:26] God it's not about themselves it's about
[1:36:29] others Jesus said in Matthew 20:25 but
[1:36:33] Jesus called them on called them unto
[1:36:36] him and said you know that the princes
[1:36:38] of the Gentiles exercise dominion over
[1:36:40] them and they that that they that are
[1:36:43] great Authority upon them but it shall
[1:36:47] not be so among
[1:36:50] you we're just getting it out of our
[1:36:53] discip iple ship okay but whosoever will
[1:36:56] be great among you let him be your
[1:36:59] minister and whosoever be the be Chief
[1:37:02] among you let him be your
[1:37:06] servant even as the son of man came not
[1:37:09] to minister unto but to minister and to
[1:37:12] give his life a ransom for many see it
[1:37:15] wasn't just the the job of Jesus to give
[1:37:19] his life a ransom for many God is
[1:37:22] calling us to give give our life for
[1:37:25] others just simple everyday stuff lay
[1:37:28] down your life for
[1:37:31] others we've got to bring them to
[1:37:34] Christ that's the job we got to get them
[1:37:37] across the Finish
[1:37:39] Line we got to see them
[1:37:42] through and you know who it it's you
[1:37:45] think about
[1:37:47] it the ones that came back to get this
[1:37:50] are the only ones that were thinking
[1:37:52] about others
[1:37:55] we got to think about others and it's so
[1:37:59] much easier to do when you're not
[1:38:01] thinking about ourselves amen amen let's
[1:38:04] stand
[1:38:06] together I think of that story and I'm
[1:38:08] thinking that is a real
[1:38:12] fire that's a real fire you know when
[1:38:15] you feel the love of
[1:38:18] God it does something to warm your
[1:38:21] heart we don't ever want to
[1:38:23] underestimate the power of God's love to
[1:38:26] minister healing to others I tell you
[1:38:29] I've experienced it I have seen it and
[1:38:32] it is real and I want more of it amen
[1:38:37] amen let's sing that that chorus make me
[1:38:39] a
[1:38:43] servant a servant of love that's a good
[1:38:46] way of looking at that a servant of love
[1:38:50] Paul said he was a prisoner of
[1:38:52] love and
[1:39:00] amen make
[1:39:02] me a
[1:39:05] servant
