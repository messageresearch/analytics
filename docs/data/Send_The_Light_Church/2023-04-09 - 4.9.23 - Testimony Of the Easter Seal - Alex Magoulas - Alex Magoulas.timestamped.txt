[2:22] rodeo clown or something at the circus
[2:24] amen he is not interested in being a
[2:26] stand-up comedian he's not interested in

[2:30] dollars a thing because you know what he
[2:32] can he can Inspire somebody to feel good
[2:34] about themselves he's not interested in

[2:41] a crown of crown of thorns on his head
[2:43] said prophesy unto us listen it's not
[2:46] that he lacked the ability

[3:12] first place we wouldn't be celebrating
[3:13] today man
[3:17] so if we're going to live Godly in
[3:18] Christ
[3:19] we have to surrender ourselves
[3:23] to the plan of God as well Amen brother
[3:25] said that seed's got to die and listen
[3:27] not just die it's got to rot out
[3:31] some of you all looking too much of this
[3:32] hust still he needs to rot out a little
[3:34] bit more mine looks particularly alive
[3:35] this morning amen I had some
[3:37] Mediterranean food last night I tell you
[3:39] what it's it's doing something but I
[3:41] don't know if it's rotten I don't know
[3:43] it's kind of stirring in there a little
[3:45] bit amen
[3:46] listen this thing that we carry around
[3:49] it's got to rot out because it's not fit
[3:51] for the kingdom that's why you're not
[3:53] taking it with you hey man
[3:55] what praise the Lord somebody help me
[3:57] out Mr we get so worried all the time
[3:59] how am I going to make a Rapture you're
[4:01] not gonna make it by your flesh you're
[4:03] not going to make it by what you do in
[4:04] your flesh listen your flesh ain't fit
[4:06] to go on the Rapture that's why you're
[4:07] getting a new body you're not doing it
[4:09] by your flesh it's not by power it's not
[4:12] by my it's by his spirit
[4:14] what's his Spirit The Same Spirit that
[4:17] raised Christ from the dead he shall
[4:20] also Quicken not just in the
[4:22] resurrection but now
[4:25] but now here today in your life he sound
[4:29] quick in your motor bodies what is it
[4:32] brother Graham said he'll throw this
[4:34] Mortal body into subjection this body
[4:37] that used to do the things of the world
[4:39] he's brought it subject by the power of
[4:42] the Resurrection
[4:43] in you amen amen subject to the word of
[4:46] God
[4:47] I want you to understand when Jesus died
[4:49] even his death was according to the word
[4:50] of God Amen to just die willy-nilly he
[4:53] died according to the word of God the
[4:55] scripture tells us that when he died he
[4:57] was he was he was buried according to
[4:59] the scriptures amen he died according to
[5:01] the scriptures and he raised it again
[5:03] according to the scriptures amen
[5:07] praise the Lord
[5:09] Jesus had the power to lay down his own
[5:11] life
[5:12] and take it up again now praise God you
[5:15] don't have to even do that
[5:17] it's not your job to raise yourself up
[5:19] but the spirit that's in you will do it
[5:23] you believe that amen let's see that's
[5:25] not your job to raise yourself listen
[5:26] you've got one job as a Christian amen
[5:28] it's the same thing Jesus did you've
[5:31] just got to die in the right place
[5:33] hey man if you can die in the right
[5:35] place listen Abraham understood if I die
[5:37] and I get buried in the right place I
[5:40] will raise again
[5:41] when his wife's Terror died he went and
[5:43] bought a field from the sons of hath
[5:45] because he knew one day in Jerusalem
[5:48] there'd be a resurrection
[5:50] he wasn't worried about honey he said
[5:52] you know what if I bury her in the right
[5:54] place if I plant myself in the right
[5:56] place God will raise it up
[6:00] when Joseph was done in Egypt and he
[6:02] knew that God's people would be in Egypt
[6:04] for 400 years they're going to lead
[6:06] coffin
[6:07] he said don't you bury my bones down
[6:10] here in Egypt when you go back because
[6:12] you will
[6:13] amen somebody help me out because you're
[6:16] going back because God said you're going
[6:18] back and when you go back you bury me
[6:21] there where my fathers are buried
[6:23] because they believed there was going to
[6:24] be a resurrection and when Christ died
[6:27] on the cross and the earthquake the
[6:29] Bible says that the graves of them would
[6:31] slept there were open
[6:34] why would why did they raise back up
[6:36] they were buried in the right place
[6:38] and man it's not just that you die you
[6:40] die out to the word if you'll hide your
[6:44] life with Christ in God
[6:46] if you'll die out to yourself and be
[6:48] buried this old life that's why Paul
[6:50] could testify I am crucified with Christ
[6:54] I'm not just crucified I'm crucified
[6:56] with Christ when he was crucified I'm
[7:00] identified with that crucifixion when he
[7:02] was married I was identified with that
[7:04] burial and praise God when he rose again
[7:06] that's the resurrection I'm identified
[7:08] with because he lives ye shall live also
[7:14] I'm I
[7:17] so you've got a job you're going to die
[7:19] out the right way you gotta rot out amen
[7:21] listen the more you can get out of the
[7:23] way the more God can have his way
[7:26] I mean you want to see more of God where
[7:28] listen people want to see God all the
[7:30] time well you know what I want I want to
[7:31] see him right here listen if you can't
[7:33] see him here don't go looking for him
[7:35] somewhere else
[7:37] that's the problem people are looking in
[7:38] the desert they look in the bed chamber
[7:40] they're looking for Christ if I can find
[7:41] the right church if I can find the right
[7:43] preacher if I can find the right
[7:44] Ministry I'm looking where God's I want
[7:46] to find where God's at you ought to be
[7:48] able to see him in the mirror
[7:50] maybe not the one in your bathroom but
[7:52] this one you ought to be able to see him
[7:53] in your own life if you can't see him in
[7:56] your own life stop looking for him
[7:57] somewhere else
[7:58] amen reach it hey man
[8:05] well praise the Lord brother it's really
[8:07] hard you know you're talking about dying
[8:08] out yourself brother that's really hard
[8:10] for me to do well how hard was it for
[8:11] Jesus
[8:14] the guy could have called for a legion
[8:17] of angels
[8:18] he could have cleaned the place up he
[8:20] had the ability listen he didn't he so
[8:24] wanted to avoid it he sweat great drops
[8:26] of blood you know you've done that
[8:27] lately
[8:28] listen it's really hard brother it's
[8:30] really hard to submit myself to God like
[8:32] that what do you think it was for Christ
[8:36] you and I don't have an excuse today
[8:39] well listen that that thing you're
[8:41] talking about is just too hard for me
[8:42] well it's impossible with men
[8:45] it is impossible with men but With God
[8:48] all things are possible
[8:50] amen praise the Lord
[8:54] it's like I said if you don't see him in
[8:55] your own life
[8:56] don't look from somewhere else listen
[8:58] that's the very essence of Christianity
[9:01] Amen brother bam says this in the Easter
[9:03] seal he says notice the very essence of
[9:05] this Resurrection is to tell and to show
[9:09] and to prove that Jesus is raised up
[9:11] from the dead he's not dead can I get a
[9:14] witness
[9:15] he's a living he lives here he's in US
[9:22] listen if he's not alive and you don't
[9:23] do you no good
[9:25] he's got to be alive in you for it to do
[9:27] something for you today amen
[9:29] he said I'll be with you even in you a
[9:33] little while in the world sees me no
[9:35] more yet ye shall see me how are you
[9:38] going to see him
[9:39] for I will be with you even in you until
[9:43] the end of the world
[9:46] listen if you ain't got that you ain't
[9:48] got nothing
[9:51] that's everything
[9:52] everything you've got doesn't matter how
[9:54] big your house is it doesn't matter how
[9:56] much you go to church it doesn't matter
[9:58] what your tithing account looks like it
[10:00] doesn't matter what your ministry is if
[10:01] you ain't got this you're you're you've
[10:04] got nothing
[10:05] you're poor you're wretched you're
[10:07] miserable you're blind you're naked and
[10:10] you probably don't even know it
[10:14] see people do this there you know people
[10:16] they try to they try to validate the
[10:18] historical accuracy of Jesus and I'm not
[10:22] against that or anything but you know
[10:24] that's what it is well we need to find
[10:25] some history we need to find some
[10:26] documents that that prove the historical
[10:28] accuracy about Jesus Christ and what he
[10:30] did and this and that but you notice
[10:32] Jesus isn't worried about validating his
[10:34] own historical accuracy
[10:36] hey man when he rose from the grave and
[10:38] he went to his disciples he wasn't over
[10:40] there trying to verify the time in the
[10:41] place of his birth well here's a birth
[10:43] certificate here's some information I've
[10:45] got some records here
[10:47] praise the Lord let's listen the
[10:49] question is birth
[10:50] hey man will they do it today with the
[10:52] prophet well you know he's born three
[10:54] days this way and this I'm not thinking
[10:56] what in the world you're going to fight
[10:58] about him not having a birth certificate
[11:00] because he's born in 1909
[11:02] it's like my wife's Grandpa was born in
[11:04] 1930 he had to get in in Ohio I don't
[11:06] know how it is here but now you have to
[11:07] have your your birth certificate when
[11:09] you get your driver's license we ain't
[11:11] got one he was born in a house or barn
[11:13] or something or whatever 1930.
[11:15] he listen he had records from being in
[11:19] the service he had records from all the
[11:21] stuff that said no we need the birth
[11:22] certificate I'm thinking the man's here
[11:24] you sent him off to war do you use them
[11:27] for everything else but we don't know if
[11:29] he's really born here I'm thinking oh my
[11:30] goodness
[11:32] they don't mind using you but as soon as
[11:34] you want something
[11:36] yeah well listen we need some
[11:37] documentation that you were born in the
[11:40] United States
[11:43] listen Jesus wasn't worried about trying
[11:44] to get in the BMV get himself a driver's
[11:47] license he wasn't pulling all these
[11:49] papers listen Joseph and Mary not my
[11:51] biological parents and this and that I'm
[11:53] I'm not listen people said that they
[11:54] said he was a legitimate child they call
[11:56] him a Piezo Bob they call him every kind
[11:58] of name and he's not worried when he
[12:01] comes to his disciples at the
[12:03] resurrection listen I need to document
[12:05] all this so there's some historical
[12:07] evidence about me later on that's not
[12:10] how he chose to prove that he was alive
[12:12] again
[12:14] amen he did not choose to say listen I
[12:16] got some photographs from when I was on
[12:18] Mount Transfiguration and the cloud came
[12:21] down that it wasn't a Thor rocket or it
[12:23] wasn't exaggerated This Cloud was really
[12:25] there he wasn't worried about all that
[12:29] that's not how he's going to prove the
[12:31] resurrection amen because you've got
[12:33] like I said you got the same arguments
[12:34] today what about this event and what
[12:37] about this timeline and what about this
[12:39] amen and listen they'll argue with you
[12:41] till you're blue in the face because
[12:43] they want to disprove it amen
[12:46] like I said if Jesus was not exempt from
[12:48] it we're not going to be
[12:50] [Music]
[12:52] like I said I'm not against apologetics
[12:53] people they want to find physical
[12:55] evidence of things in the Bible I say
[12:57] well that's great that's fine amen they
[12:59] can show you the tomb that Jesus was in
[13:00] and things that tie into the Bible
[13:02] that's fine that's wonderful
[13:04] all those things are true and they're
[13:06] important but listen Believers are going
[13:09] to believe it anyway
[13:10] and unbelievers are not going to believe
[13:12] it no matter what you show them
[13:14] hey man
[13:15] praise the Lord
[13:17] so when Jesus rose the first day of the
[13:19] week he was proving the resurrection
[13:21] that he is the resurrection how is he
[13:24] going to prove the resurrection he's
[13:26] going to continue to do what he's always
[13:29] done
[13:30] because only he could do the things he
[13:32] did so he said you know what the works
[13:34] that I do you're going to do also and
[13:37] greater than these how you do because
[13:38] I'd go to the father because listen you
[13:40] can get two historians and they can
[13:43] argue about physical evidence well
[13:44] listen I hate carbonated this for this
[13:46] state well this carbon date says six
[13:48] months difference and they can fly and
[13:50] they can argue about physical evidence
[13:51] all they want
[13:53] but listen when you got somebody that
[13:55] was dead and they raise again
[13:58] it's really hard to argue that
[14:00] when God takes a person that's to get an
[14:03] incurable disease and they get the
[14:05] doctors don't even know how to argue
[14:06] that well I don't know what to make of
[14:07] it
[14:08] hey man listen when God does things that
[14:11] man can't do and he continues today to
[14:13] do things that man can't do that proves
[14:16] the resurrection
[14:18] we've tried so much to prove it by
[14:20] everything else we try to prove my
[14:22] psychology and intellect and Science and
[14:24] all these things but God ordained for us
[14:26] to prove it one way by doing the things
[14:29] that he did
[14:33] come on brother my my
[14:37] when he proved the resurrection he
[14:38] validated everything the word had ever
[14:40] said about him amen and I want you to
[14:42] understand the bad Theology of his day
[14:44] didn't stop him
[14:46] I'm in the wickedness of the Roman
[14:47] government didn't stop him
[14:49] amen amen your interpretation these
[14:52] men's interpretation of the Resurrection
[14:54] didn't stop him the stone didn't stop
[14:56] him the seal didn't stop him Devils
[14:59] couldn't stop him nothing stopped him
[15:01] amen
[15:02] listen if the resurrection is in you you
[15:05] don't need a bunch of excuses for why
[15:06] it's not the same you've got evidence
[15:09] we've got tangible evidence today of the
[15:12] Resurrection your life is hid with
[15:15] Christ and God
[15:16] it's no longer I that live Paul said
[15:18] it's no longer you if you've been there
[15:21] you're a witness it's not me Christ
[15:24] lives in me
[15:27] amen amen hallelujah
[15:30] man I think about the disciples like I
[15:32] said they had doubts that day
[15:34] they had no Direction they didn't know
[15:36] what they were going to do but that
[15:37] morning when they approached the grave
[15:38] they saw the stone had been rolled away
[15:43] amen why the sea was broken when the sea
[15:47] was broken and they ran they saw you
[15:49] know what he's not here
[15:51] praise the Lord now listen listen to the
[15:54] angel there was an angel that testified
[15:56] I love this there's an angel and that
[15:58] seal was broken there was an angel
[15:59] testifying he's not here amen listen
[16:02] Christ didn't need to move the stone
[16:04] back to leave the tomb you understand
[16:05] this the guy could walk through walls at
[16:07] this point he can just appear wherever
[16:08] he wants he doesn't have to move the
[16:10] stone back to leave he moved the stone
[16:12] back for us
[16:14] I want you to look and see he's no
[16:18] longer here
[16:20] my my
[16:23] he wrote it back for a testimony for our
[16:25] sakes because of that seal that was
[16:28] there that said he was dead it was
[16:30] broken and the stone was rolled back
[16:32] he's not there it's a testimony he's
[16:34] alive
[16:35] he's just not alive there
[16:40] amen
[16:41] well we have the same thing in this day
[16:43] amen
[16:44] you know it's it's interesting to me I
[16:46] saw this church billboard or whatever it
[16:48] is outside one time and they've they had
[16:50] the quote there from the angel I think
[16:52] was the Book of Luke we said he's he has
[16:54] risen he's not here I'm thinking well I
[16:56] don't want to go to church there
[17:00] I want to go where he's at
[17:03] hey man if he's not here in this Garden
[17:05] I don't want to be here I want to know
[17:08] where he is
[17:10] so I want to understand now is the
[17:12] sealed testify being broken that Christ
[17:15] is alive it lets you know where he's not
[17:17] at he's not in this tomb amen unless a
[17:21] denomination and man's ideas and crazy
[17:24] they veiled Christ throughout seven
[17:26] Church ages and this book this book of
[17:28] redemption was sealed with Seven Seals
[17:31] but when these seals were broken who
[17:33] broke the seals who lose the seals it
[17:35] was Christ
[17:37] and was it testified testifies where
[17:39] he's not at
[17:40] amen it's amazing to me when I was a
[17:41] young believe when I listened to the
[17:42] seals and I'm reading it I'm like what's
[17:44] this all about what the devil's done
[17:45] that first white horse rider is the
[17:48] spirit of antichrist you know what it's
[17:50] doing is testifying where he's not at
[17:52] don't look for him where he's not at
[17:55] amen that's what God's trying to tell
[17:56] you listen these things where this has
[17:59] happened God's telling you don't look
[18:01] for him there
[18:03] amen praise the Lord amen oh my I tell
[18:06] you what
[18:07] the seals have testified he's not in the
[18:10] Tomb the same thing like I said with
[18:11] with that you know uh where Satan is
[18:14] Satan always wants to be where God's at
[18:16] but you know he he can he can go to
[18:18] church listen Satan can go to church
[18:20] hey man
[18:22] Satan can get into politics he can get
[18:25] the preachers he's getting all kinds of
[18:26] things but there's one thing Satan can't
[18:28] be he can't be the word
[18:30] he can't be the word amen
[18:32] and listen you and I if we're born again
[18:34] by the spirit of God if that seed
[18:36] remains in us then you and I are part of
[18:38] this word and this word is our absolute
[18:41] amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[18:44] you know brother Branham it's
[18:45] interesting because you you know that
[18:48] first seal he talks about the white
[18:49] horse rider brother Brandon himself I
[18:52] love this he himself taught for years it
[18:54] was the spirit of Christ you know the
[18:57] and brothers and the teachers they
[18:58] taught that that was uh I got here he
[19:00] said the teachers taught it was the Holy
[19:01] Spirit conquering in the first stage but
[19:04] when the seals come and the seals are
[19:05] open I said but my revelation
[19:08] my Revelation by the holy spirit amen
[19:12] it's not that way my Revelation by the
[19:15] holy spirit is that Christ and the Holy
[19:18] Spirit is the self same person only in a
[19:21] different form
[19:22] and then what was that white horse right
[19:24] here it was the spirit of antichrist he
[19:27] had a bow but no arrows amen and that
[19:29] first seal revealed where Christ was not
[19:32] at he's not in man-made religion
[19:35] amen he's not in denomination he's not
[19:38] in organization that's why brother
[19:40] Brandon can say listen I was against
[19:42] denomination all those years I didn't
[19:43] know why now I know
[19:45] God's not in it now that doesn't mean
[19:48] the people it's the spirit you're not
[19:50] against the people actually you're for
[19:52] them you're for them that's why you're
[19:54] against the thing that's bound them
[19:56] organize religion amen listen there's
[19:59] all kinds of organized religion when
[20:01] that seal broke it let you know he's not
[20:03] here
[20:04] just like that church billboard he's not
[20:06] there
[20:07] that second seal that second that red
[20:09] horse rider Politics the power of
[20:12] government entering in it's amazing to
[20:14] me how many message Believers their
[20:15] hopes are right on the next election yes
[20:18] it astounds me we'll sit there and we'll
[20:20] argue about politics well listen if so
[20:22] and so gets voted in and so-and-so and
[20:25] this and that listen it doesn't matter
[20:27] who gets voted in this country's done
[20:29] for that's thus save the Lord
[20:33] America's not going to have some big
[20:35] sleeping Revival we're not going to
[20:37] bring it back
[20:38] listen a prophet wouldn't even pray for
[20:40] it anymore and we think we vote the
[20:42] right kind of a guy and listen I love
[20:44] paying lower taxes I love it before 14
[20:47] inflation said in my my money was worth
[20:49] something I love it amen praise God
[20:51] that's fine but listen my Hope's not
[20:54] built in there those things are going to
[20:57] listen anything that can be shaken is
[21:00] now being shaken there's only one thing
[21:03] that can't be shaken you and I as
[21:05] Believers have received a kingdom which
[21:08] cannot be removed
[21:10] if you're looking for God in politics
[21:12] he's not there
[21:15] quit looking for him there he's not in
[21:18] it
[21:19] well praise the Lord you think about
[21:21] that third seal there they were
[21:23] merchandise he's certainly not
[21:24] merchandise young man praise the Lord
[21:26] you know what what's interesting to me
[21:28] God God put a little something in that
[21:29] third seal for you amen because the
[21:31] devil and the powers the Antichrist they
[21:33] were selling everything they were
[21:34] selling wheat and barley but you know
[21:35] what God Said but don't you touch that
[21:37] oil and don't you touch that wine
[21:40] so listen if you if you sit under a
[21:42] Ministry you go to church that touches
[21:43] the all on the line you listen God's Not
[21:46] There
[21:47] amen listen I heard it years ago I'm sat
[21:49] in a church and they said you know what
[21:50] the spirit of God In Our Generation it's
[21:53] not like it wasn't brother Brandon's
[21:55] really I thought he was the same
[21:58] yesterday today and forever well now
[22:00] listen the anointing is now lifting off
[22:03] the people and the spirit of God's just
[22:04] lifting off the Earth that's not the
[22:06] same I thought that's interesting and I
[22:08] heard a brother his brother Isaiah
[22:09] Brooks is actually preaching about he
[22:11] was preaching one day he was talking
[22:12] about the wise and the foolish version
[22:13] he's talking about this very same thing
[22:15] he said you know some people say that
[22:17] the anointing is lifted but we look at
[22:19] about the five why's the five foolish he
[22:21] said maybe it's lifting off of you but
[22:24] we find it doesn't lift off the wise
[22:26] just lifts off the foolish that's the
[22:29] wise version she's got as much oil and
[22:31] extra she's got oil in her lamp and oil
[22:34] on your vessel and any Ministry or any
[22:37] man that would say the spirit of God if
[22:39] we don't have the spirit of God's day
[22:41] like they did back there he's lying to
[22:43] you God's not in that God's in the place
[22:46] that says he's the same yesterday today
[22:49] and forever
[22:50] my God still raises the dead he still
[22:52] heals the sick he still prophesies he
[22:55] still gives Visions if you take any if
[22:57] you take up deadly servants not saying
[22:59] you should go find some now
[23:01] listen they won't hurt you why because
[23:03] he said it's the same
[23:07] any voice that would tell you what's
[23:09] what brother Bram said any voice that
[23:10] would say he's not the same today as he
[23:13] was it's a voice of discrepancy God's
[23:16] not in that
[23:18] don't look for him there
[23:21] amen they want to see where Christ was
[23:22] listen he was in the Tomb go check it
[23:24] again he's still not there why check it
[23:26] at third time why check it at all
[23:29] the FDA listen if the angel told me it's
[23:31] empty that was good enough for me
[23:32] [Applause]
[23:34] the angel this out this day this
[23:36] messenger said he's not in these things
[23:38] you know what that's good enough for me
[23:40] the Seal's been broken someone listen I
[23:42] didn't roll that stone back right hey
[23:45] man it was the angel
[23:47] he sat on top the thing amen listen he's
[23:50] gone
[23:53] my mind
[23:57] you know what it's it's interesting to
[23:59] me
[24:01] president talks about Peter gave a he
[24:04] gave out a prescription the day of
[24:05] Pentecost
[24:06] I said you know if a doctor would mess
[24:07] with that he's he's writing you
[24:09] something to kill you amen right and
[24:12] that's what you've got today you've got
[24:13] men saying you know what he's not the
[24:14] same he was back at Pentecost he's he's
[24:15] not the same things are different listen
[24:17] that man's killing me whether he
[24:19] realizes it or not amen if he was a
[24:21] doctor we would revoke his license
[24:23] hey man I don't care how many n85 masks
[24:25] you wear or how many vaccines what you
[24:28] need today is a double dose of the Holy
[24:29] Ghost amen if you ain't got that amen
[24:31] you've been sold a lie
[24:36] hurt not the oil and the wine what is
[24:37] the oil it's his Spirit what's the wine
[24:40] I love it brother it's not just wine
[24:42] it's not just Revelation it's the
[24:44] stimulation of Revelation amen listen if
[24:47] you Revelations stimulates you a little
[24:49] bit you ought to be so happy you got the
[24:51] good stuff I mean you got the kind of
[24:53] stuff Jesus gave out the third day Cana
[24:55] and then you ain't got that flat wine
[24:57] that you get from the cheap Dollar Store
[24:58] hope you're not buying that anyway
[25:00] you got the good stuff this Revelation
[25:03] it's got some stimulation in it amen
[25:06] this will change your life amen oh
[25:08] that's that new wine the kind that makes
[25:10] you smile all the time
[25:12] my my well now why would you see that's
[25:15] the problem I said brother Graham said
[25:16] people get just enough religion to be
[25:18] miserable
[25:20] hey man
[25:21] well if Christ isn't raised from that we
[25:23] would be of all men most miserable
[25:26] in other words if he is raised you're
[25:28] not supposed to be the most miserable
[25:30] people on the face of the Earth and
[25:31] that's exactly how some Believers are
[25:33] you think they were the most miserable
[25:34] people in the world and I'm thinking but
[25:36] he's alive you're not supposed to be
[25:38] miserable you should be excited because
[25:40] he lives that means you live also
[25:44] well praise the lord well I'm now I'm
[25:46] just ranting
[25:47] you pray for me
[25:49] brother bam says this rising in the sun
[25:52] it's familiar quote to us hopefully but
[25:54] brother Brown says this he said he
[25:56] speaking of Christ he is the one who
[25:58] opened those seals he is those seals for
[26:01] the whole word of God is Christ and
[26:03] Christ is the seals that was open What's
[26:06] the opening the seal isn't revealing
[26:07] Christ notice the very seven angels
[26:10] which represent the seven churches all
[26:13] completed we couldn't even see it why
[26:16] because it was veiled hey man it's veil
[26:18] by all these things where he's not at
[26:20] they did I love this see he made his
[26:23] enemies testify they took the picture
[26:27] not us talking about the cloud there in
[26:30] the in
[26:31] 1963. there he is standing there Supreme
[26:34] judge showing that he is Alpha and Omega
[26:38] the beginning and the end what
[26:40] identification
[26:42] quickening power did that to us
[26:46] notice quickening power lets us see his
[26:49] coming quickening power snatch us from
[26:52] death to life quickening power gives us
[26:55] discernment to know what's wrong with
[26:57] you and what to do what you've done what
[26:59] you ought not to have done what you
[27:01] should have done what you will be
[27:02] quickening power all these things
[27:05] could that be why people miss it today
[27:07] they ain't got enough quickening power
[27:09] right it's like I said a few moments ago
[27:11] some people say we don't have that kind
[27:12] of power then how are you going to see
[27:14] it only cricketing Power lets you see
[27:17] the Revelation in the first place we've
[27:19] got to have it
[27:21] listen we can't just get a little bit
[27:23] we've got to have so much people want it
[27:26] from us
[27:27] I hope the wise virgin walk up or the
[27:29] foolish version walk up to you listen I
[27:31] want what you got listen I got just
[27:33] enough for me
[27:34] listen I got something for me and man
[27:37] you ought not to be going to get it from
[27:38] somebody else you ought to have so much
[27:40] virtue coming out of your life people
[27:43] want what you got
[27:46] right oh my
[27:48] God our lord Jesus is so full of
[27:50] quickening power he was all of it
[27:53] together he was so full he said you
[27:55] destroy this body
[27:58] I'll raise it up in three days talk
[28:00] about confidence
[28:03] in quickening power
[28:05] destroy this body this Temple I'll bring
[28:08] it up in three days why did he say that
[28:11] he knew that it was written of him see
[28:13] it was written by the word of God which
[28:15] cannot fail
[28:18] the word said I will not suffer my Holy
[28:21] One to see corruption neither will I
[28:23] leave his soul in hell and he knowed
[28:26] Hallelujah he know that quickly power
[28:28] would raise him up there wouldn't be one
[28:31] cell corrupt
[28:35] I'm saying this for a reason Jesus
[28:37] didn't just have quickening power he had
[28:39] confidence in it he had so much he said
[28:41] if you tear my body you destroy this
[28:43] Temple
[28:44] listen the them man that killed him then
[28:47] saw his confidence that's why they put a
[28:49] seal on the tomb they said we remember
[28:51] he said this we remember his confidence
[28:53] how he boasted they would raise on the
[28:55] third day
[28:57] that's how much confidence he has it
[28:59] we've barely got enough confidence for
[29:01] one trial
[29:02] we've barely got enough confidence to go
[29:04] to church half the time oh I just don't
[29:06] know if God's gonna show up I just don't
[29:07] know if God's with me this man had
[29:09] enough confidence he died with it it
[29:11] arose again
[29:13] well Hallelujah
[29:16] said you destroy this Temple I'll bring
[29:17] it back in three days why it was
[29:19] prophecy the word of God of Prophecy if
[29:21] it's true word of God cannot fail and
[29:24] the same prophecy the word of God that
[29:26] said he'd raise him up says that we
[29:28] are already raised with him
[29:32] that's why you have confidence
[29:34] because the same word that said he would
[29:35] raise says you already are
[29:41] yeah
[29:42] no wonder he said fear not
[29:46] and it is written that the spirit that
[29:48] is in US was in him now in us also
[29:50] quickens our Immortal bodies is fear not
[29:52] friend the s o n is up
[29:56] the Sun is up amen that's why we're here
[29:59] today we believe in a sunrise not the
[30:01] kind you see 365 days a year we believe
[30:03] the Son of God is up
[30:05] and listen he's up today
[30:07] I believe that's why we're here because
[30:08] if you lift him up he said I'd draw all
[30:10] men unto me
[30:11] listen I didn't draw myself here I
[30:14] didn't draw you hear God Drew you here
[30:16] today the Son of God the son of man has
[30:18] been lifted up We've Got Confidence that
[30:21] the same power that raised them up has
[30:24] already raised us up
[30:26] that means if that same powers in you
[30:28] that same power heals the sick that same
[30:31] power cleanses the leper amen that same
[30:33] power in your life cast out devils
[30:37] listen Jesus is so full of quickening
[30:39] power he'd walk into the building and
[30:41] the Devils would throw themselves on the
[30:43] ground and we act like we're afraid to
[30:46] go in our house we're afraid to do this
[30:48] I tell you what I get so frustrated some
[30:49] believe it's got just enough quickening
[30:51] power him to fill a thimble I mean they
[30:53] got this stuff quickly power to be
[30:55] miserable amen well the devil did this
[30:56] to me and the devil did that and I hear
[30:58] it all the time with the devil and the
[31:00] devil I'm thinking maybe you ought to be
[31:01] scared when you walk in the room
[31:04] man they're begging Jesus to go into a
[31:06] bunch of pigs when he showed up and then
[31:08] you are not the tale today you are the
[31:11] head you have been exalted far above
[31:14] amen somebody say far above far above
[31:18] all principality and power and might and
[31:21] Dominion I'm so tired of beat up
[31:23] Christians oh I'm just fighting the
[31:25] devil this week and the devil this and
[31:26] the devil man he don't even want to come
[31:28] around when you get enough quickening
[31:29] power in you then he wants to run the
[31:31] other way
[31:33] I still believe
[31:35] hopefully not the only one I still
[31:37] believe a man can so completely serve
[31:40] God
[31:40] till the devil don't know what to do
[31:43] with him
[31:44] and I ain't sitting here trying to fight
[31:46] him every day listen he's defeated
[31:50] amen listen you don't defeat him you
[31:52] remind him he is defeated
[31:54] listen the devil torments you he tries
[31:56] to bother you you don't sit there and
[31:58] toggle the war with them
[32:00] that's where people mess up well listen
[32:02] I'll show him and I'll do this you don't
[32:04] have to fight him he's all ready
[32:06] defeated you do what Joshua did you put
[32:09] your foot on his neck and you remind him
[32:12] and you remind the enemy and you remind
[32:14] your circumstances listen this
[32:16] uncircumcised Philistine this enemy of
[32:19] God is already defeated I will not fight
[32:22] with you I will not contend with you I
[32:24] will tell you to leave because the Bible
[32:26] says if you submit yourself to God and
[32:28] you resist the devil he will flee from
[32:31] you
[32:36] I tell you what
[32:38] well praise the Lord
[32:40] submit yourselves to God see that's what
[32:42] nobody wants to do
[32:44] right you know we make great um
[32:48] we make great lofty
[32:51] ideas out of the idea of Liberty because
[32:53] we come from a country that's found on
[32:55] the idea of Liberty right and the Bible
[32:56] talks about Liberty you know we love
[32:58] Liberty amen we love to have Liberty in
[33:01] church we love to have Liberty and
[33:02] preaching we love to have Liberty in our
[33:03] homes but you know we talk so much about
[33:05] Liberty and our idea of Liberty is we're
[33:06] going to run around we're going to shout
[33:08] we're going to do all these great things
[33:08] we're going to have a good time
[33:10] but you know you can do all that and not
[33:12] have what I'm talking about
[33:15] hey man
[33:16] if you've got real Liberty they can
[33:18] throw you into jail
[33:19] like they did Paul and Silas you can be
[33:22] in shackles in the middle of the night
[33:24] you can be beat up and you're the freest
[33:26] person that's ever been
[33:27] because you're free from yourself you're
[33:29] free from sin you're free from Death
[33:31] you're free from Fear
[33:33] it doesn't matter what your natural
[33:35] circumstances you know there's one thing
[33:37] that's greater than Liberty submission
[33:42] listen the Bible says there's lots of
[33:43] people that promise Liberty
[33:45] oh we got we have Liberty in church we
[33:47] have Liberty they promise Liberty but
[33:49] they're the Servants of corruption
[33:51] and Paul says
[33:53] or maybe it's Peter the Bible says
[33:57] the Bible says you've got Liberty but
[33:59] don't use your Liberty as a cloak of
[34:02] maliciousness
[34:03] in other words you can take all these
[34:05] things to disguise a wrong motive you do
[34:07] all the wrong things amen but you submit
[34:10] yourself to God when you've got Liberty
[34:12] and you choose to submit to God that
[34:15] Christ did in that Garden that's real
[34:18] power
[34:19] and the prophet said a man that's fully
[34:21] surrendered to God is omnipotent
[34:24] oh I want Power surrender
[34:27] quit surrender to everything else
[34:29] questioned your misgivings and unbelief
[34:32] surrender to God
[34:33] listen this Bible says things about you
[34:36] and you and I it's not a job to validate
[34:38] the historian or the accuracy of it
[34:40] listen he proves it by doing it
[34:43] if this Bible says you're holy then
[34:45] guess what you're holy
[34:47] this Bible says you're righteous then
[34:50] guess what you're righteous this Bible
[34:52] says you can heal the sick guess what
[34:54] you can heal the sick
[34:55] this Bible says you've passed from Death
[34:57] In The Life guess what that means what
[34:59] it says
[35:03] quickening power lets us see it say we
[35:06] need the quickening power today
[35:08] you know I say this often can you
[35:09] imagine trying to describe color to a
[35:12] man that was blind his whole life you
[35:14] couldn't do it
[35:15] amen
[35:16] until he has the sense to perceive it
[35:19] you can explain it and talk about all
[35:21] you want it doesn't mean anything
[35:24] until he's experienced it and that's the
[35:26] problem with church is we've tried to so
[35:28] explain this Bible and so explain this
[35:30] message and we lead them to all kinds of
[35:32] intellectual ideas and all of our
[35:34] understanding that's not our job to do
[35:36] that our job is leading to Christ where
[35:39] they have a sixth sense and then when
[35:41] you see a man that's born again will see
[35:44] the kingdom of God
[35:46] amen we need less explanation about it
[35:48] and we need to show people
[35:50] the essence of their resurrections to
[35:52] tell
[35:53] and to show
[35:54] amen you cannot educate people into an
[35:57] Awakening
[35:59] no amount of propaganda will create an
[36:00] Awakening for them amen they've got to
[36:03] experience quickening power for
[36:05] themselves
[36:07] amen we have Christians here today
[36:10] we're Christians they praise the Lord
[36:13] we got a few here we gotta hopefully
[36:14] much
[36:16] what changing quickening power did that
[36:19] you didn't do it listen I know what I
[36:21] was
[36:22] I'll guarantee you right now I didn't
[36:23] fix that you can't you can't fix a lot
[36:26] of ways
[36:27] well praise the Lord
[36:29] amen quickening power did that to you
[36:31] amen yes
[36:32] the seal this and there was a seal over
[36:34] your life of sin and death amen this
[36:37] flesh it was hiding something in it when
[36:40] you were in the world when you were
[36:41] sinning when you were doing the wrong
[36:43] things there was something hidden behind
[36:45] this flesh amen there was a
[36:47] predestinated seed that was laying there
[36:50] sin and death and circumstances in the
[36:53] flesh it hit it but one day when the
[36:56] light of this word struck that seed
[36:59] I mean it it removed that old Power from
[37:01] your life the Bible says we've been
[37:03] circumcised with a circumcision not made
[37:05] with hands amen it broke that seal over
[37:08] your life and now you've got a seal not
[37:10] from the world not from your first birth
[37:12] you've been born again and you're sealed
[37:14] by the Holy Ghost until the day of
[37:16] redemption
[37:18] the seal testifies there was a dead man
[37:21] here
[37:22] amen oh my help me out somebody I was
[37:24] dead in sins of trespasses I wasn't
[37:26] alive I thought I was alive I thought I
[37:28] was living I didn't know what life was
[37:29] but when Christ came Christ who is our
[37:33] life came and he revealed the mystery
[37:35] that had been hid through my life it had
[37:38] been hid Through the Ages but it's been
[37:41] revealed now and you and I it's Christ
[37:43] in you he's the hope of glory
[37:46] [Music]
[37:48] the Seal of my life testifies there was
[37:50] a dead man here
[37:52] that guy's gone
[37:54] he's gone never to return again but
[37:57] Christ lives there now and the life that
[37:59] I live in the flesh I live by the faith
[38:02] of the son of God
[38:04] my mind I you know I could sit here and
[38:07] go on about these seals but you know
[38:08] brother Graham talks about the opening
[38:10] the seals what happens when a seal is
[38:11] opened it thundered it thundered and
[38:14] what is a thunder it's the voice of God
[38:17] you know what are you tonight this
[38:19] morning what are you you're the voice of
[38:21] God to this generation that seal in your
[38:24] life now you are brother Graham said
[38:25] Living Voices you're thundering out what
[38:29] are you thundering out rage and we're
[38:31] going to show the politicians with
[38:33] sweetness humility
[38:36] train amen you get smart on the cheek
[38:38] you turn the other cheek listen lots of
[38:41] people can work miracles but they can't
[38:42] turn the other cheek
[38:44] help me out somebody I know a lot of
[38:46] people man they they can prophesy they
[38:48] can do this and that but they can't they
[38:49] can't ever admit they're wrong
[38:51] they can't ever say they're sorry
[38:53] what's real power anyway
[38:56] it's power over yourself
[38:58] and listen Balaam could prophesy
[39:01] but he couldn't give up his love for
[39:03] money
[39:04] now who's in charge of bailam in his
[39:06] money that's his God
[39:09] praise the Lord
[39:11] I'm speaking something to you now
[39:13] a lot of people can do all kinds of
[39:15] things
[39:16] they have no Mastery with their own
[39:18] selves
[39:20] they had no Liberty from their own
[39:21] nature
[39:23] what good is it all anyway
[39:25] amen thundering voices this is the
[39:29] thunder that shakes the devil brother
[39:30] REM said sweetness
[39:32] humility
[39:35] yeah you know I was just talking to a
[39:37] brother the other day this isn't in here
[39:38] so if I butcher it forgive me but you
[39:40] know it's like that time
[39:41] Brother Bear was dealing with the IRS
[39:45] and uh
[39:47] you know one day he just got so fed up
[39:49] with it they were calling you told
[39:51] sister me tell them I'm not here well
[39:52] Bill you're here I'm going out the back
[39:53] door tell him I'm not here none of us
[39:55] have ever been there before I'm sure
[39:57] situation like that well I'm not really
[39:59] here trust me
[40:01] mentally you're as far away as you want
[40:02] to be from it amen you know he went out
[40:05] that door and he said you know
[40:07] a little you you watch how little
[40:09] synonyms and there comes his boy and uh
[40:12] I forget what it was but he he reminds
[40:14] his dad the whole thing oh like you had
[40:16] mom tell the IRS
[40:18] you know brother Berman he recognized
[40:20] you know what somebody's watching my
[40:22] life
[40:22] my life's speaking something you're
[40:25] you're living Epistles today you're the
[40:27] you're the voice you're the thunder in
[40:29] your own life it's speaking something
[40:32] you know and the reason the reason I'm
[40:33] bringing this up like I said this is
[40:35] totally whatever but
[40:37] brother bran went to that man
[40:39] he apologized to him
[40:42] now think about this I I
[40:46] I'm not sure I know a lot of people
[40:47] would do that in the message
[40:51] brother Ryan went to the IRS agent
[40:54] the tax collector
[40:57] and he apologized said you know what and
[40:59] he told me he did and this is the part
[41:01] that strikes me the most you know that
[41:03] man said you know brother brand am I uh
[41:05] Mr Branham I respected you a lot before
[41:08] now he says but I think even more of you
[41:10] now
[41:13] think about that
[41:15] this man he did the wrong thing brother
[41:16] Bram did the wrong thing but he went and
[41:18] made it right and that so impressed this
[41:21] man
[41:22] because I think even more of you now
[41:25] we're so worried about our reputation
[41:27] sometimes
[41:29] why don't people think I did this and
[41:30] that listen they'll think more of you if
[41:31] you're honest amen
[41:34] that means something more to the world
[41:36] because they say you the world will look
[41:38] at your life say you know what if God
[41:40] can do that for them
[41:41] you can do it for me
[41:43] it's not this perfect portrait that we
[41:46] always present
[41:47] well I've always done this and I don't
[41:48] do this and I never struggle with this
[41:51] it's when we have that kind of thunder
[41:53] in our life
[41:55] that humility listen that humility my
[42:00] God help us all amen
[42:03] amen the Bible said he humbled himself
[42:05] Christ
[42:06] to the cross
[42:08] he didn't have to do that for you and I
[42:11] chose to take on that lowliness and
[42:14] we're always trying to one-up one
[42:15] another
[42:16] well I've got a bigger Ministry and I've
[42:18] got this and I've got that friends
[42:19] Christ and he doesn't have to do all
[42:21] that
[42:22] Eternal life's living for others amen
[42:24] right
[42:25] right I don't know I just I just I was
[42:27] thinking about that I don't know why I
[42:28] just I felt go that way but you know we
[42:30] miss it many times that's what real
[42:31] power is
[42:33] the the greatest anointing that ever
[42:35] struck the face of the Earth
[42:37] brother bam talks about Jesus got up he
[42:38] read the scroll where it was written of
[42:40] him the Lord has anointed me to preach
[42:42] the gospel to bind up the broken heart
[42:44] to heal the sick he set the Bible down
[42:47] in gracious words proceeded from his
[42:49] mouth that's the greatest anointing
[42:53] Brother Brad says you know if people
[42:54] talk about power but they don't really
[42:55] know what power is
[42:58] right why are you saying all this all of
[42:59] a sudden this is real power you might
[43:02] sit here and look at your own life say
[43:03] well I'm not I'm not successful like the
[43:05] word I'm not like so and so I don't
[43:06] listen that listen Christ I said it
[43:08] already once he's not trying to perform
[43:10] for others
[43:12] your life is not about how much you
[43:13] impress other people that's not eternal
[43:16] life
[43:17] Eternal life's not trying to measure up
[43:19] to somebody else listen Christ died and
[43:21] rose again that's why we're here today
[43:24] listen he didn't do that so you could be
[43:26] better than the Joneses
[43:28] he didn't so you could be he who he
[43:31] ordained you to be before the foundation
[43:34] of the world you be who Christ made you
[43:36] to be that's his reward
[43:39] you'd be who God made you to be
[43:43] why am I well I'm sorry I just Cobble
[43:46] this all together all of a sudden here
[43:47] but Lord I hope the Lord
[43:50] show you what I'm trying to get out I
[43:51] hope you see my heart amen
[43:54] it's in humility
[43:56] it's an esteeming others better than
[43:58] yourself
[43:59] it's more than just raising the dead
[44:01] although that's great
[44:03] I better be because we're all gonna have
[44:05] to raise up sometime
[44:06] [Laughter]
[44:08] that's what we're depending on Amen
[44:10] but he didn't raise from the edges
[44:12] because he wanted to it was the life in
[44:14] him that did it and that life testifies
[44:16] to these things I'm talking about I
[44:18] believe we've seen that life in the
[44:19] seventh angel in this generation I
[44:21] believe I'm seeing that life in some of
[44:22] you in us today yeah hopefully you see
[44:25] it in me I want you to see listen I want
[44:28] you to be able to see it in yourself
[44:30] I want you to be able to look in the
[44:31] mirror and say you know that's the Son
[44:32] of God that's a daughter of God I see
[44:35] Christ in my life I don't see him in my
[44:37] flesh I see past the Veil
[44:40] the veil that was a ranch by the power
[44:43] of God at rent The Veil it showed where
[44:46] he's at he's not in denomination he's
[44:48] not in all these things he's in you and
[44:49] I if we believe this word
[44:52] that's right that's what brother Ram
[44:53] said I I took this word that's why it
[44:56] was against domination he said I took
[44:57] this word as my absolute when you've
[45:00] made this your absolute you'll see
[45:01] Christ in every scripture you'll see
[45:03] Christ in your own life
[45:06] listen that's worth more than all the
[45:07] money in the world
[45:09] because that'll get you out of the grave
[45:12] amen
[45:14] the world is gathered together many
[45:16] places I did I saw something you know
[45:18] I'm in the breakfast thing there and
[45:19] there's the pope piece he's doing his
[45:21] thing because he was sick or something
[45:22] good Friday or whatever I'm thinking oh
[45:24] glory to God well the pope showed up
[45:26] you've got a whole
[45:28] billions of people looking to this man
[45:30] for leadership and he's as far off the
[45:32] word as anybody you might as well sell
[45:34] drugs in the alley or something
[45:37] no I mean yeah
[45:39] I don't know why you guys made me ran
[45:41] about everything I don't know what this
[45:42] is this is like I'm not trying to bully
[45:45] pull no but I mean it's just this
[45:46] Antichrist can be
[45:48] right amen and all kinds of people
[45:49] they've gathered to celebrate Easter the
[45:52] day that Christ rose from the dead and
[45:54] I'm thinking every day is Easter for you
[45:57] and I that's what the prophet said we've
[45:59] entered into our Easter it's just one
[46:01] day you know what today is for me it's
[46:03] just one day closer to the Rapture
[46:05] that's what it is for me this raps her
[46:08] is the culmination of what took place
[46:10] when he raised again from the third from
[46:13] the grave on the third day that you and
[46:16] I are going to live because he lives
[46:18] That's My Hope
[46:20] that's my Easter that I am our it's
[46:23] listen it's already begun
[46:27] so one day we're gonna have a Rapture
[46:28] listen we've heard a shout yes
[46:31] it's already going on don't miss it
[46:34] that's how I wish I lived back then
[46:35] you're living in the greatest moment
[46:37] that's ever been on the face of the
[46:38] Earth don't miss it he's alive today in
[46:41] you he's looking to take a people the
[46:45] manifestation of the sons of God is upon
[46:48] the scene to bring a resurrection don't
[46:51] miss it
[46:52] oh if we lived in the days of our
[46:54] fathers you're living today
[46:56] you get to see the things that Kings and
[46:59] Priests and and wise men they longed to
[47:02] see this day
[47:04] they wanted to see it we're trying to go
[47:06] backwards they were trying to get here
[47:07] right
[47:10] don't miss it it should be this close
[47:14] this is where Easter's at
[47:16] God made mountains God made planets God
[47:18] made galaxies God made he made stars
[47:22] that are multiple times bigger than our
[47:24] son and our sons multiple times bigger
[47:27] than this Earth God made all these
[47:29] things
[47:30] and yet where did God choose to dwell
[47:32] there's a little room in your heart
[47:34] about the size of a of all the places
[47:37] God could have dwelt
[47:39] of all the places God could have been so
[47:41] you know what
[47:43] that's what I want there's just a little
[47:45] spot there that's just enough it's it's
[47:47] just God's size enough for me to live
[47:49] there
[47:51] and we're so busy chasing after what we
[47:54] think is great things listen God living
[47:55] in you is as great as it gets amen
[47:58] if that's not great to you what is
[48:02] we esteem every we esteem people esteem
[48:05] all kinds of things
[48:06] God wants to live
[48:09] in just a little listen he'll live as
[48:11] much of it as you give him amen but he's
[48:13] got a little bow there if that's not
[48:15] greatness what is
[48:17] that's what brother Brown said that's
[48:18] what makes God so great he's so humble
[48:21] they would live in you and I of all the
[48:23] things
[48:24] not a star not Jupiter not a mountain
[48:28] in your heart
[48:29] amen
[48:32] how historical is the resurrection to
[48:34] use my question I want to close with
[48:36] today
[48:37] how historical is the resurrection to
[48:39] the Pope
[48:40] it's two thousand year old Resurrection
[48:41] that's how historical it is
[48:43] some people it's 150 years ago when
[48:45] their denomination started
[48:47] their gods stopped there
[48:50] gold God did this great thing in the
[48:51] Methodist Church what's he done since
[48:52] then nothing
[48:56] some people's Resurrection was 20 years
[48:59] ago at an altar call
[49:01] and that's that's that's where they
[49:02] that's where they met him and maybe
[49:04] that's where they left him
[49:05] how historical is the resurrection to
[49:08] you today I I say I don't want to even
[49:10] be historical to me I want to live in it
[49:12] now
[49:13] don't ever let this Easter become a
[49:16] historical event to you it doesn't
[49:17] matter how far back you place it when
[49:19] you make it historical you've missed the
[49:21] essence
[49:23] is to show and to tell he's alive right
[49:26] now today
[49:28] April 9th 2023 I won't tell you the time
[49:31] because then you'll start thinking about
[49:32] it
[49:33] I I am rapping up but don't make it a
[49:36] historical event
[49:38] no matter how far if it's yesterday
[49:39] you've missed it
[49:41] don't leave God yesterday don't leave
[49:44] him back there 10 years ago or 20 years
[49:46] ago oh I remember when God used to do
[49:48] this and I remember when I first came to
[49:49] God but what's he doing today in your
[49:51] life is he still are you still letting
[49:53] him have the preeminence today
[49:55] amen
[49:56] listen he's not back there he's right
[49:59] here he's the I am amen
[50:03] don't make him the I was
[50:05] and don't make him the I will be you
[50:07] know I believe one day we're going to
[50:08] have a great thing he's the I am
[50:11] he's great today
[50:13] it's great and you today brother bam
[50:14] says this
[50:16] our message therefore this is in the
[50:17] greatest news flash in history praise
[50:19] the Lord
[50:20] our message therefore is truly the
[50:22] greatest news flash that history has
[50:23] ever known there's been all kinds of
[50:25] make beliefs and so forth but the
[50:27] message the church has is the greatest
[50:29] news flash that's ever struck the world
[50:31] yes sir we buried him dead but he's up
[50:34] and alive again he wasn't just buried he
[50:38] was buried dead but he's alive again

[50:45] facts he is not dead but he is Alive
[50:48] forevermore what a message what a flash

[50:58] the hearts of everybody they come into
[51:00] contact with he is not dead but alive

[52:59] I'm not saying you ain't got trials but
[53:01] I got good news for you listen that's
[53:04] what gospel is it's good news we've got
[53:06] so much bad news we feel everybody's
[53:08] ears with
[53:09] it but I will remind you no matter what
[53:10] you're going through not saying you're
[53:12] not going through stuff but yet greater
[53:15] is he that's in you
[53:16] than he that's in the world
[53:19] news flash I got troubles but news flash
[53:22] God is still greater this mountain shall
[53:25] be removed by the same God he's alive
[53:28] today
[53:34] they don't believe it that's the reason
[53:35] they don't make headlines I'm gonna
[53:36] finish this quote
[53:37] and you're going to listen to it sorry
[53:40] that's the reason they don't believe it
[53:42] but to the believer it makes a headline
[53:43] in the heart of the believer yes
[53:45] when he sees it and recognize it it
[53:47] Thrills him above everything that could
[53:49] ever be done it throws a headline that
[53:52] flashes everything else of the world
[53:54] dead as soon as he ate as soon as they
[53:56] see he is alive and with his church what
[54:00] a thrilled is to the believer greatest
[54:02] headlines that could ever be headlined
[54:04] right here is our message
[54:06] the Easter message
[54:08] but
[54:11] but we allow Easter from One Day in the
[54:13] year that's our Easter One Day in the
[54:16] year is an Easter every day in the year
[54:19] ought to be an Easter every day should
[54:22] be a thrilled day of the Resurrection
[54:23] but they've got mixed up with colored
[54:26] eggs and corsages and new Bots and
[54:28] rabbits and therefore Easter is just a
[54:30] propaganda
[54:33] amen but to the believer that knows day
[54:36] by day they live in an Easter because he
[54:39] has risen from the dead He's Alive
[54:40] forevermore in their hearts making
[54:42] himself known to his church day by day
[54:44] these signs
[54:46] shall follow them that believe
[54:49] amen
[54:50] if you need evidence
[54:53] of the Resurrection today
[54:55] I pray that you can look in a believer's
[54:57] life here if not your own say you know
[54:59] what
[55:00] Something's Happened listen I pray
[55:02] there's enough evidence
[55:04] that Christ is in me that if I were
[55:06] going to trial they'd find me guilty of
[55:08] being a Christian
[55:09] I pray that it would be a unanimous
[55:11] decision by the jury that man is a
[55:15] Christian amen I hope I'm I hope I'm so
[55:18] past denying it I couldn't deny it if I
[55:20] wanted to amen I want everybody to know
[55:22] everybody ought to know that Jesus Lives
[55:25] amen we ought to get outside and tell
[55:28] somebody

[55:31] you want to celebrate you should go
[55:33] share it with somebody that's how you
[55:34] celebrate it let them know you know what
[55:36] he's the same today

[56:17] live like we believe it amen
[56:20] no if we don't live like we believe it
[56:21] we say we do that's just hypocrisy
[56:24] I mean if our words and our actions
[56:26] are not consistent I I told the I told
[56:29] the kids years ago I was talking about
[56:30] somebody I said well this person's
[56:33] I said their behavior is inconsistent I
[56:35] was taught my wife I said that's that's
[56:37] the nice way of saying they're a
[56:38] hypocrite
[56:40] so by the way you're talking about well
[56:41] Jesus called people hypocrites
[56:44] um
[56:45] our lives and our words and our actions
[56:47] should always be consistent
[56:49] amen
[56:50] you know
[56:51] I could start here for about an hour and
[56:53] talk about fake news
[56:55] and we all laugh because it's a big
[56:57] thing nowadays you know they go to print
[57:00] whatever is going to make money they go
[57:01] to print whatever and some people over
[57:03] here say this is fake news and vice
[57:04] versa
[57:08] I don't want our lives to testify like
[57:11] fake news organizations amen
[57:13] let's not say one thing and do another
[57:16] okay let's not live one thing and say
[57:18] another amen
[57:21] do you believe he's alive today
[57:23] do you believe it by the power of the
[57:25] Resurrection that's in you that when you
[57:27] go out here I want you to remember that
[57:28] Christ is in you and Christ does the
[57:30] same things today I'm not asking you to
[57:32] empty out the graveyard today although
[57:34] that power does lie within you
[57:36] it does lie within you see we laugh but
[57:38] it's true
[57:40] amen it's going to empty out not every
[57:42] well actually it will empty I agree at
[57:44] one point
[57:45] listen everybody that's ever died is
[57:47] going to raise just not all for the same
[57:48] reason
[57:49] someone to life and someone to judgment
[57:51] but that power whatever who whatever
[57:54] you're doing in your life it's in you
[57:56] it's not in this building it is
[57:58] currently but when you leave this
[58:00] building guess what it goes out because
[58:02] it's in you and I
[58:04] okay we're not going to church we are at
[58:07] the church
[58:08] and I want to remind you that's what
[58:09] Easter is really about today Christ is
[58:11] in you and he does the same things and I
[58:14] want to remind you in the midst when you
[58:16] go to your next trial that might be five
[58:18] minutes from now I don't know
[58:19] might be three minutes from now whatever
[58:21] you're going through remember greater is
[58:23] he that's in you
[58:25] and he that's in the world
[58:27] amen let's bow our heads
[58:31] Heavenly Father we're
[58:34] such a privileged people today
[58:38] Lord I pray you just take this
[58:41] this broke up thought it went a
[58:42] different way than I I thought it would
[58:44] but I'm trusting that something was said
[58:46] to to be a help to your people
[58:50] Lord may we not be like that hog that
[58:52] had all them apples drop on his head and
[58:54] didn't know where his blessings were
[58:55] coming from
[58:57] well we are certainly a blessed people
[58:59] probably everyone here could acknowledge
[59:01] that we're blessed people
[59:03] but Lord many times we live below our
[59:05] privilege we fail to realize just how
[59:07] blessed we really are
[59:09] but I pray today Lord that it would just
[59:12] stir our hearts Anew with the great
[59:15] thrill of this Resurrection Lord I lay
[59:17] in bed this last night just thinking
[59:19] about how how easy it is to get
[59:22] distracted
[59:23] how easy it is to make it a historical
[59:25] event
[59:27] how easy it is to look back and say that
[59:29] God has done certain things in our lives
[59:33] it's easy to get that way and not look
[59:35] to what you're going to do today
[59:38] well we get distracted so easily we we
[59:40] have many cares in this life and if
[59:42] we're not careful the cares of this life
[59:45] will drown in them
[59:48] it'll it'll sap
[59:50] from our lives the joy and the
[59:53] stimulation of the blessings of God
[59:57] Lord I pray we just take a little time
[59:58] today
[1:00:00] time everybody to reflect that you're a
[1:00:02] very present help
[1:00:04] your present help in time of trouble
[1:00:06] you're with us today
[1:00:09] you're in us today
[1:00:12] many times we forget like the disciples
[1:00:14] you're in our boat
[1:00:16] when we go through the storms of life we
[1:00:19] begin to panic and we become concerned
[1:00:21] Lord I pray you'd help us to be mindful
[1:00:23] may you stir our Pure Minds by way of
[1:00:26] remembrance you're in the ship with us
[1:00:28] today
[1:00:29] you're in the hearts and the lives of
[1:00:32] these your children today
[1:00:34] Lord if there'd be needs here today Lord
[1:00:36] I I pray that people understand I I'm
[1:00:40] not trying to marginalize that need I'm
[1:00:43] just trying to exalt the one that can
[1:00:44] answer it
[1:00:45] look we are a needy people
[1:00:48] we go through many things in life we
[1:00:50] have many things that we could cry out
[1:00:52] and complain about and no doubt many of
[1:00:55] them are valid Lord we I I would never
[1:00:57] want to take that away from people
[1:00:58] you're David he complains to you he
[1:01:01] cried out to you about things in the
[1:01:03] scripture
[1:01:04] but Lord beyond that we testify you are
[1:01:07] more than able
[1:01:08] to help us in the time of trouble
[1:01:10] Lord you are greater than any adversary
[1:01:13] any opposition that we would face you
[1:01:16] overcame hell death in the grave
[1:01:19] if you overcame those things you can
[1:01:22] overcome in us today whatever we go
[1:01:25] through we are more than sufficient
[1:01:28] for the challenge of this hour
[1:01:30] through Christ Jesus
[1:01:32] we are more than able
[1:01:35] to fulfill the word of God
[1:01:37] through Christ Jesus today what I pray
[1:01:40] you take this little group of people
[1:01:42] just the cream of the crop just just
[1:01:44] some real wonderful people lord they're
[1:01:46] wonderful because you live in them
[1:01:49] Lord there are great people because the
[1:01:51] great God lives in them
[1:01:53] the holy God on the Holy Mountain made a
[1:01:55] holy people here today
[1:01:57] we thank you for that we want to just
[1:01:59] give you all the praise and glory we
[1:02:01] thank you Lord we're so happy
[1:02:03] we're so happy to know that you're risen
[1:02:05] from the dead not just today but every
[1:02:07] day Lord when we're in the darkest trial
[1:02:10] of our life
[1:02:11] we're in the worst situation Lord we
[1:02:13] want to give up
[1:02:15] Lord I'm so thankful you didn't give up
[1:02:17] on us
[1:02:18] Lord you could have walked away from the
[1:02:20] cross
[1:02:22] you could have walked away from all
[1:02:23] these things but you chose to suffer and
[1:02:25] die from us and when you Rose again on
[1:02:28] that third day you rolled back that
[1:02:29] great stone and you broke that seal as a
[1:02:32] testimony for our sakes
[1:02:34] because you wanted us to know you want
[1:02:37] us to tell a Dying World Jesus Christ is
[1:02:40] alive
[1:02:41] may that be the very theme of our lives
[1:02:43] in the very Cry of our hearts this day
[1:02:46] and every day I pray that the tomb is
[1:02:48] still empty
[1:02:49] he's not in a tomb Lord you're not in a
[1:02:52] tomb you're not a man's ideas but you're
[1:02:55] in our hearts because we believe your
[1:02:57] word
[1:02:58] Lord may this word be ever ever greater
[1:03:01] ever more real to us Lord may we not
[1:03:03] slack may we not slide back from it may
[1:03:06] we press forward
[1:03:08] Lord we thank you for a rapture we thank
[1:03:10] you for the Blessed hope of the church
[1:03:14] the very culmination of all these things
[1:03:16] that were spoken of that you would take
[1:03:18] a people that have passed from Death
[1:03:21] unto life and they would not taste of
[1:03:23] even physical death but you would
[1:03:24] Quicken these mortal bodies we shall not
[1:03:27] all sleep but we shall all be changed
[1:03:29] Hallelujah
