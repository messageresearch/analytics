========================================
I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe when Jesus is here he's here Jesus is here Jesus Jesus is here all things are possible Jesus is here Jesus Jesus is here Jesus Jesus is he all things are possible Jesus is here oh God bless you I greet you in the name of our precious Lord and Savior Jesus Christ this counter an honor and a privileges to to be here just to be with you guys once again I just want to thank brother John for the opportunity to be here and just for his confidence and just praying for the Lord just to speak to us tonight and to speak in a mighty way and change lives this is power heads and we invite the author dear Lord Jesus uh any man could turn these pages but only you Lord can bring the word to life I pray Lord that you just bring the word to life in such a mighty way Lord let the word just find a resting place in our hearts Lord let it just come and heal our souls Lord I pray Lord that as we would just hear from you Lord that our ears would be open Lord and that you'll just help us Lord not to only hear this word but to live this word Lord I pray Lord you move me Plumb out the way Lord that I won't even know the things that would be said Lord because you'll be uh taken over lord we just give all things in your preeminence have your way Lord take every Spirit under your control Lord and move in your way you would see fit Lord in Jesus Christ and we pray amen like to open up to opening scripture in Matthew chapter 4. in verses 18 through 20 very very familiar scriptures so Matthew 4 18 through 20. and please say Amen when you get there and it says in Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee saw a two Brethren Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were Fishers and he said unto them follow me and I will make you Fishers of Men amen God bless you let me the word just bless his word he may be seated and we're going to turn to Mark chapter one and we'll read verses 16 through 20 in Mark chapter 1. so it says the Bible says now as he walked by the Sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrea's brother casting a net into the sea for they were Fishers and Jesus said unto them Come Ye after me and I will make you to become Fishers of Men notice they had a choice it says Come Ye after me and they have to they had to make that choice just as we have them had to make that choice as well when we came to Christ and they straight away they forsook their Nets and followed him and we had gone a little far the events he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother who also were on the ship mending their Nets and straightway he called them and they left their fathers everybody in the ship with the higher servants and went after him and we'll go to one more scripture reading in Luke chapter 5. and reverses one through eleven only a little bit of foundation so chapter 5 verses 1-11 and it came to pass that as a people pressed upon him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of guessing heart and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their Nets and they entered into one of the ships which was Simon's and he prayed to him that he would thirst a little farther from land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship now when he left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a drought and Simon answering said unto him Master we have toil all the night and have taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net amen and when they had done this they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break and they bake it onto their Partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help and they came and filled both the ships so they began to seek I can relate in verse 8 what Simon Peters is going to say when Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus knees and saying depart from me from a sinful man oh Lord for he was astonished and all that were with him at the drought of fishes when they had taken and so was also James and John the sons of Zebedee which were partners with Simon and Jesus said unto him fear not from henceforth thou shall catch men and they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed him now notice that we look at each rendition in Luke and Matthew and Mark they all had that same choice to follow Jesus or not and the title of our sermon is the power of decision and so at each instance Peter Andrew John they all had a choice whether it's a follow Jesus or Not Jesus never forced them to make that decision but he said come after me and just as the words being preached the Lord is saying come after me because he wants to speak to each one of us and now we all made that that decision when we gave our heart to Christ praise the Lord but we each day we have a decision whether we serve God or not for the day that's why Jesus said you must crucify daily you must deny yourself daily before you even pick your cross up so we don't realize how great our our power of decision is in our life because one bad decision can ruin your life years to come uh just like as we see many scriptural examples in the Bible of the power of decision and we're getting more into uh in the children of Israel later in the sermon praise God so I I this song I Really we like this song we all know what a friend we have in Jesus I'm reading a couple lines from it all our sins and griefs to Bear what a privilege to carry Everything To God In Prayer notice that the peace that we often forfeit so a lot of times we'll make a decision and not pray about it we'll just think oh it sounds good but we don't weigh the consequences of it because each decision that you make in your life is going to have consequences when you serve Christ it had positive consequences you may have lost some friends you may have lost some family members they made a cause separation but I believe that's the greatest decision that a Believer can ever make is to give his heart to Christ and to say Lord be the captain of my ship and so that's a beautiful decision but each day like I said before you have that decision whether you serve God or not because God is looking for a believer that he can fully use on a daily basis and you I can't make the decision for you but the Bruce can't make a decision for you you have to make that decision every day the things that you feed on you're making a decision to feed on them so if you're feeding on the things of God that's a good decision but if you're choosing to feed the things of the world then that's a bad decision it may not hurt you at that very moment but it will begin to affect you spiritually eventually praise God so I looked the word forsake it means to quit or leave entirely so when the Lord is asking us to forsake something they say maybe maybe you're a basketball player or whatever it was maybe you really loved music you had records like brother John said he's asking us to forsake that very thing and it says to quit or leave entirely see if you truly forsake something you can't hold on to it and still try to serve God Jesus told us it was impossible you can't serve Mammon and God at the same time so when the Lord is asking you to to leave something to give something up the best thing for you to do is to make that decision to do it right then and there because once again God is looking for obedience he's not looking for you to question him his every single move in your life a lot of times we may not get the answer right then and there but he says asking believe me trust me that's always asking for us to do notice like I said before Jesus is gave them a choice as he's given us a choice to let him into his heart and see that picture right there right now he's knocking at the door of our hearts and you have to make that decision to open that door it's up to you it's up to in my life it's a personal walk it's not a two-person walk but it's a personal walk with you and God that's the only two people can be on that road praise God let's keep going so I looked the word decision the action or process of deciding something or resolving a question and conclusion or resolution reached after consideration so a decision when we make a decision it could be your financial the first main decision is your Eternal destination that's the first decision that we had to make as Believers when you made Christ your first choice you chose your Eternal destination and now the next one is a church now you prayerfully went about choosing a church because God wants us to be in church for a reason not just because it sounds good but that's the chosen place he spoke to speak to us in church that's where we find out where we're at with God another thing we chose is a career a career is a very important thing you don't want this any old career but you want the career that God has for you and then another important thing is a spouse you don't want to just marry any old body but you want to make sure that you're going into what God has for your rib that's very important and there's going to be many more decisions that we're going to have to make in our life and not every time we're gonna have you know weeks and weeks to pray for a decision sometimes you got to make a decision right then and there it's so important to have the minded Christ at all times if you have the mind of Christ it's going to help lead your decision because Jesus he had the he had the mind of Christ he was Christ and he looked at every decision he made it was pleasing to the father because why he wanted to please the father he said I do nothing but what the father shows me so he had that plea yes he had he had a choice Jesus also had a choice he had the power of choice he had the choice not to go to Calvary for us but he made that choice because he loved you and me more than he loved staying here on Earth with his disciples he would so love to stay with his disciples and spend time with him but he knew that he had a greater higher calling that God was calling him to praise God so there's going to be many decisions you have to make in your life that's why it's so important to go about it prayerfully I can't I can't say it enough even when witnessing to somebody you want to make sure you're going about it prayerfully because if you're witnessing to them then you're not going to get the job done but if it's God through you witnessing him the job's going to get done and so that's why it's so important to prayer is so key in your life in fact prayer is the greatest weapon that God has put in the hands of mankind as a true sincere prayer to offer to God that's what God is looking for you're looking for in a prayer not how well and elegant you sound but is it really coming from the heart are you really pouring your heart out to God you know that's what it comes down to I'm reading a couple quotes how do you know your boundary line is not set tonight to make your decision for Christ so maybe some people out here listening on the live stream who maybe are on the boundary line but still we still had that same decision tonight are you gonna turn him away from the last time there's a line drawn a Plumb line and God sets his boundaries God is in his nature God is in his Universe moving among his people God moves out we look at it and see and behold how great his handiwork is what he does and how he works as nature to bring mankind to him I've seen him in tornadoes seen him in great things how that God moves so we we kind of put God in a box sometimes we think that God can just speak to us this this way but God speaks in so many ways he's in nature he's omnipresent he's everywhere so don't just think God uh can just speak to you this in X Y and Z but just be open God is he can use a billboard he can use he uses his word amen amen so one more quote and we'll keep it going and go to James chapter one she's on the evasion the hour is here now yes an hour of decision to an hour of decision not to come to church but an hour of decision whether we're going to serve Christ or stay lukewarm now we all made the decision to come to church tonight but did you make the decision not to just sit in a seat but to receive from God that's a decision right there because we can make a decision to go to church Wednesdays and Sundays praise God but if your heart's not in it then you're making that's a bad decision what if you're hard Senate you've made a good decision because God isn't calling us as to warm seats but he's calling us to live the word that he's preaching to us that's what he's calling us to and if we make it anything less than that we miss the reason why God set churches up for a reason he set the church is up for a reason to put us in order to help us to perfect us he's given us a five-fold Ministry for a reason to perfect the Saints because we're preparing for a rat in fact the Raptors happening right now everything every decision you make is either going to bring you one step closer to it or one step behind it so that's how it's so important if we can just get this decisions down each decision is so important in your life in fact one bad decision can affect not just you but your whole family around you we see that in when Aiken I was in the nose but Aiken he uh chose to steal some gold and it affected the whole Army of Israel they cannot win a battle think about that one decision that he made he probably thought oh is this a little gold here but in reality it affected those around him and he actually had to pay with his life for that decision now I'm not saying that that's going to happen to you but I'm gonna say in this that one wrong decision can impact your family from years down the line that's why it's so important to think about the decision you're going to make make sure it's a good decision I don't want it just to sound like a good decision but go about it prayerfully because it can not only affect your family but your church brothers and sisters as well that's how important it is one bad decision let's go to James one as I said James want to read chapter verses one through eight I I just think about how many times that we just forfeit the peace in our life by not Consulting God we try to handle all these things by ourselves and try to juggle it by ourself and and God didn't intend for it to be like that he intended for him to be the center of your life he wants to be the center of your decisions the center of everything at your job at your home at your work in your car God wants to be everything in your life but you have to make that decision to put him there you have to put him first on a daily basis don't just put him first on Wednesdays and Sundays but put them first seven days a week 24 hours a day that's what he's calling us too so James chapter 1. James a servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad greeting my brethren counting all Joys when you fall into diverse Temptations I want to just point this out notice that he says counter all Joys so you have to make that that choice to be joyful in your diverse Temptations because it says it says in the scriptures telling me my brother accounted all Joys when you fall into diverse Temptations then it gives you why knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience see God has a purpose when you're going through your trials when everything around you feel like it's falling apart is for a reason God is this this isn't doing this to do it but he's doing it with a perfect purpose he's trying to it's potential inside of you he's trying to to mind that potential he's trying to perfect that potential inside of you because God sees something in you that we can't see sometimes and if God's living inside of you he wants to live more inside of you this as a minor is uh has gold he's trying to beat that goal to see his image so God is trying to see more of his image inside of us he wants to give us more patience he wants the fruits of the Holy Ghost to to work in our life on a daily basis not not just once a month not just twice a month but 31 days out of each month sometimes it's 28 29 days you know what I mean that's what God is looking for verse uh verse 4 but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and empowering wanting nothing see a lot of times we want to get out of a trial but is this uh this is I was in the men's meeting a couple weeks three weeks ago and this uh Minister said I never forget a lot of times we're looking for a miracle for our you know in our trial but God's looking for growth that we we want to get out the trouble one guy just to wave his hand and just take us out but God is looking for growth he's looking to build something inside of you that's that it's not there but he's trying to build it inside of you praise God he said verse five if any of you lack wisdom let them ask of God that give it to all men liberally in a bravest not and it shall be given him but let him ask nothing uh let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavers like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways so we can't have a double mind when we're making a decision well we can't say oh man this feels good to my flesh but you know you gotta we got to cut that out because not every decision you're gonna make is gonna be easy not everybody's going to agree with the decisions you're going to make now if it's from the Lord that's okay if everybody doesn't agree with it because some somebody the Lord can speak to directly and it's a personal walk but we say once again the Lord can speak to directly and not speak to another person about what you got to do but so if if it lines up with the word and if if it's thus saith the Lord in the word then go for it but if it's shaky then I would I would definitely go by the prayerfully praise God let's keep let's go to First Corinthians 10. so now we want to get into the children of Israel just that that great decision they had just look at the children of Israel they had uh they had God literally sent a prophet and delivered them from the Egyptians and we see all the mighty things that God did for them but they could never come to Grass to take God at his word fully and give their heart to god so let's go to First Corinthians 10. 1 through 15. so it says moreover Brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers under the cloud and all pass through the sea we're all baptized unto Moses and the cloud and in the sea and it all eat the same spiritual meat and it all drank the same spiritual drink for they drink of that that spiritual rock that was uh followed them and that rock was Christ now notice they are all experienced the same things that Joshua and Caleb did they all saw everything that it's not one thing they didn't see together amen but notice there was only two that made it to the promised land out of the million out of two million no notice that and it just like uh I'm gonna took this class in college a long time ago and uh this statement I'll never forget they said how two kids can be raised in the same home same morals everything raise right and one can turn out bad and one can and one turns out good and it shows you that you have free more Agency for a reason that you make that choice whether you want to and the thing is a lot of times your decisions will be influenced by your your friend's Circle the people that are in your life well actually they can influence your decisions so if you choose to hang out with with people that bring you down and aren't going places then guess what eventually you will start thinking like that and it's so important who are you surrounding yourself with are you surrounded with yourself with people who are building you up and are going places spiritually and and naturally because it's a balance as well or are you surrounding yourself with uh people that make you feel better because you're better than them you see what I'm saying because they're either they're going to influence you are going to influence them so influence is a big part in decision making because you're very influenced by the wrong Spirit you're going to make the wrong decision now the children of Israel they were influenced by the wrong spirit because they saw God time and time again making things happen making a way with their sameth no way but they were spoiled brats and they didn't want to take God of his word they didn't want to play their part because we play a part in our walk with God we don't just sit down and just rest we gotta fight for every inch we gotta fight for every single inch yes the land is yours but you gotta fight for it tooth and nail because the devil does not want you to get to the source of God he knows when you get to that Source he is he is powerless he has no power over you he's powerless praise God let's go verse 4 and did and did all drink the same spiritual drink for the drink of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrowing the Wilderness now these things were our examples now in this Bible isn't just some some uh book with just cool stories in it no this Bible this is real life this really happened it's really happened it says we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted how many times do we lust we we ask and we receive not because we we ask amiss a lot of times we make these decisions because all it feels good it feels good to my flesh I got stimulation but that's what God isn't asking us to make feel good decisions because I believe when you make a decision towards Christ your flesh shouldn't feel good because your your flesh is enmity against God your flesh hates to serve God right so if you're making a decision that's pleasing to God your flesh is definitely going to have a rebuttal rebellion and it's our job to crucify that verse seven neither be I idolaters as some of them were now we think I doubt idolatry is just you know uh making this microphone you know a god but in reality anything you put before God it can even be the business that God blessed you with I'm gonna say one more time it can even be the job that God blessed you with can become an idol in your life something that God has blessed you you can put before him and that's not right it's not right even a a brand new car that God has given you the finances to be able to buy it you could put that before God even your family your children your wife your husband you can put that before God even though that he blessed you with it so we have to have a balance of how we're doing things because God does not want to be second place not third not fourth but he wants to be first place no matter what and God isn't looking for your excuses he's not looking for my excuses he's looking for a believer that will put him first if you want growth in your life put God first on a daily basis every decision that you make every thought that you have even the scripture says put every thought into The Obedience of Christ that's what it tells us to do every thought not just some thoughts here and there but every thought challenge your mind challenge the way you think because the way you think is going to be you're going to become that so if you think uh if you think that should you amount to nothing then eventually you will amount to nothing but if you can take God in every single word the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass it starts with the right mental attitude if your attitude is horrible and bad you you can never get anything from God how can God speak to you you can't and it's like the children of Israel they had a bad attitude notice that every time they would come against some trial some roadblock in their life they would have a bad attitude and that's what stopped them from going into the promised land yeah yeah they they could say uh a man from Heaven every day my clothes didn't wear out but when it came time to enter into the Holy Ghost they couldn't enter in because they were found wanting verse 8 neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand verse nine neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents verse 10 right here neither murmur yes some of them also murmured how how often do we really challenge ourselves when we start to murmur I think sometimes we just let it happen and say well I think it's okay in this instance you know a lot of things are happening to me at work and I think it's okay if I murmur and complain a little bit no but it's sitting right here neither murmur yes some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer so you begin to murmur you lose sight of being grateful and thankful to God because you're complaining a complaining spirit is contagious it is it's very contagious now also uh now all these things happen unto them for end samples and they're written for admonition that means gentle reproof counseling against the fault instructions and duties caution and Direction upon whom the ends of the world are come so this right here was written for us to look at it not just to read it and just put it down but to actually study it read it so if the children of Israel had a same bad attitude then we can wind up in a similar situation as them not trusting God and wonder why our life is a shambles see a lot of times our life's in shambles because we aren't taking God at his word see it's one thing to say you believe but it's another thing to really believe I can say all day I believe but if my life is not lining up with God's word and that and it's not God's word lineup but your life but your life lying up with God's word that's the key you gotta mold to the word of God not the word of God mode to you see a lot of times people want to uh they want a gospel they wanna one of Jesus that that just supplies all their needs and they do nothing do it they accept them as Savior and oh I go to I'll go to church Jesus on Sunday but you know uh anything else outside of that other six days out the week I want to live for myself how do you ever expect your life to get in order I never will notice the children of Israel had a choice whether to take God of his word or doubt God that or doubt that God could take him to the promised land notice that the children made a decision based solely upon emotions they were always constantly basing their decision upon emotions that's why they complained and murmured all the time because they were looking at their emotions they weren't looking at The God Who Could solve their problem but they were looking at the circumstances around it a lot of times if you get your eyes off of God you will begin to look at the problems in your life that you can't overcome them but God has called us to be Overcomers we said to Satan before it's not you necessarily and overcoming but it's you getting out the way so God can overcome it in your life because within ourselves we don't have the power to overcome but through through Jesus Christ I can do anything is no mountains too big no Valley's too low God is a god of small problems and big problems a lot of times we don't come to God because we think our problem is too small that you know God does God cares about it all it matters to the master I love that song it matters to the master your small promise matter and your big problems matter to God he's a God who cares about your needs he's a God who cares about your current situation right now if you need peace he wants to give you peace if you need healing he'll he his fountains open tonight amen see and they made their decision upon emotions and not by faith faith says God said the land is ours and your life God is saying the land is yours those giants in your land don't be scared of them don't be David wasn't scared he said don't let this uncircumcised Philistine defile the armies of the Living God he didn't care he had Bulldog Faith he knew what God did in his life with the lion and the bear that he's going to do the same thing to his uncircumcised Philistine because he knew it was the will of God he didn't have no fear not one bit now notice Joshua and Caleb also had those same choices they could have doubted God or took God his word and we said before they saw all the same things the other ten spies saw they saw all the things God did to bring them to this very point they experienced the mighty hand of Jehovah just says the others did and we'll pick our reading up in numbers 13 26-33 numbers 13 26-33 and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron into all the congregation of the children of Israel Into the Wilderness of Quran to Kadesh and brought back the word unto them and to all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the Lamb and they told them and said we come into the land whether thou Sinners us and surely it flows with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and every great uh and moreover we saw the children of anech there I want to stop right here and actually go to Exodus 23. I just want to see that they they forgot that quick of what God promised them and going to the land I want to say I always want to just show that how quick they forgot so Exodus 23 and go to verse 20. behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring me into a place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not God was given a warning right then and there he says beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I'll be an enemy unto thy enemies notice that promise he gave them and yet they forgot that he said it's simple it's so simple he said but if thou shall indeed obey his voice you want to type that to us right now if you obey God's voice be obedient to him he's going to do these things for you he's going to help you conquer those giants he's going to help you overcome the person at work that hates you hates you to the Bone amen and Amy's an adversary until I adversaries for my angel shall go before thee and bring me into the amorites and the high tights and the presides and the Canaanites and the halftites and jezebites and I will cut them off verse 24 thou shall not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shall utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images notice god promise them that and they they went over to the land and saw all these things and they forgot it how could they forget the most important thing that God told him right there he said the land is yours he promised in the land and when God made a promise he even he when God makes a promise is going to happen simple as that he may not give you a time frame or how it's going to happen but you take him at your word it's like brother Roger and sister Trisha they were promised the baby look what happened God one thing God can not do he can't fail you can't verse 26 or verse 26 there shall nothing you know verse 25 I'm sorry and you shall serve the Lord your God he shall bless thy bread and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee you still doing that tonight amen there shall nothing there shall nothing cast their young nor Barren in thy land the number of thy days I will fulfilled I will send my fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom Thou shalt come and I will make all thy enemies turn their backs onto thee man I'm reading this I'm just like wow they miss this they they they don't remember this but Joshua and Caleb did I'll tell you that they caught the vision that God had they caught The Vision by faith and the same thing we have to do is catch that same vision by faith because God wants to take the Giants out your life but you have to be willing to recognize that he can destroy any Giant in your life and don't just live with the Giant but conquer that giant in your life and I will send the Hornets before thee which shall drive out the have lights and the canines look at all these things God promised to do and the High Tides but for before Thee I will not drive them up before thee in one year unless the land become desolate and the Beast of the field multiply against it by little and little I will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land I I just look God's faithful and notice a decision that the children of Israel made Joshua and Caleb had to bear the consequences of it but guess what I'll tell you one thing they did not murmur complain one time they didn't they were like okay hey we still believe God he's going to take us to the promised land he promised on where we at we were at um let's finish numbers uh 13. I'll go back to numbers 13. I think we're at verse 28 I believe I mean time just flies huh first uh verse uh 29 or verse 28 nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled in every great and wherever we saw the children of annex there notice the excuses if you begin to make excuses in your life that means you're doubting God you will start doubting God eventually if your life is just filled with excuses you will doubt God and not even realize it that's how dangerous that that spirit is and the Amica is the world on there land of the South and the high tides and jezebites and amorites and they they forgot God said I'm going to get you out this land I'm gonna I'm gonna get these people off the land for I'm gonna help you see I think what they wanted was they wanted to just sit back and relax and God just destroy everything they didn't want to do anything and same thing we feel that same way in our life when we got Giants in our life addictions Deliverance whatever it is we think that God should just you know wave some magic wand and say it'd be gone but God is looking for you to get serious about that thing in your life says draw nigh to God and he'll draw an eye to you it doesn't say you lay down in your bed and he's going to draw an eye to you and you do nothing it doesn't say that you gotta play you play a part you have to put the work in just like if I'm working out if I work out one one time a month and I eat fast food three times a day am I ever gonna get in shape no same thing with faith if you just take God sometimes at his word you're never going to have faith in fact it's impossible to please God without faith you can't please him without faith it's impossible you see you have them children of Israel they didn't make it they're carcasses in the wilderness I love Caleb right here and Caleb Still the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are able to overcome it they had that Vision they had Faith they knew that God could move but the men went up with him and said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we there is doubt and God right there doubting God's Mighty hand the very God that created heavens and earth they're doubting that they can't they can't they can't overcome that and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there we saw the Giants and Sons of anak which come of the giant so we're in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we are on their site let's go to 14. Chapter 14 verse one and all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the whole congregation said unto them would God that we have died in the land of Egypt or would God we had died in the world of this wilderness and wherefore hath the Lord just noticed that wow after God has done all these things for him the Brazen serpent all these things gave them water out of a rock fed him with Mana oh Red Sea parted and just drowned the Egyptians all those things that were done but yet they always talked about oh we should go back to Egypt you know it's always it's like to me that their heart never left from Egypt that they were still in some of some of the Believers uh the make-believers they were their heart was still in Egypt but Joshua and Caleb's heart was to God they knew that what God did that he could keep doing things like that and they didn't serve God just because of the Miracles and the signs they serve God because they loved him and they believed him notice they walked in with us for 40 years that's love to me because they could have said oh they could have said Joshua kept saying oh but I got to be these game-sane people they I didn't make this decision God you saw me I made this choice but that'll be Pride you know God doesn't work with pride and they said one to another let us make a Captain Let Us return into Egypt then Moses and Aaron fell on their face before all the assembly congregation the children of Israel and Joshua the son of none and Caleb the son of Jeff forgive me if I said that wrong which were the them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto all the company the children of Israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land if the Lord I love us if the Lord delighted us then he will bring us into the land and give it to us a land which flows the milk or honey only Rebellion ye not against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bred for us their defenses is departed from them and the Lord Is With Us fear them not but all the congregation bathed them Stones uh stoned them with stones and the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of the congregation for all the children of Israel and the Lord said to Moses how long will this I'm gonna stop right there actually because time is uh flying but uh we want to just notice Joshua and Caleb saw with the eyes of faith not with the eyes of doubt they knew that their current situation that they're in that God can get him out of it so tonight we may be in a certain situation in our personal lives like we feel like we we're in a box and we can't get out we feel like uh the enemies trapped Us in prison I'll tell you tonight you don't have to feel like that anymore God is still a deliverer he still wants to delivery out of the the problem you're in like I said before don't look at your problem as a children of Israel did but look at it with eyes of faith that Joshua and Caleb did God made a way for them it may not have been right that moment but they knew that God was going to make a way even says in scripture they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they should met up with wings as eagles they show run and not be where they shall walk and not faint so notice there's no time table upon that it says they that wait so it could be a month it could be an hour it could be two weeks I don't know a year it could be but you keep believing God's word it's like sister Kathleen she's believing for God's healing I don't know why I don't know why what God does things he does but I know one thing he does it perfect he knows what he's doing it's not his first time around the block he knows God knows what he's doing so sometimes God does certain things for somebody else we may go through certain situations in our life to help somebody else down the road it could be five years down the road God knows what he's doing in your life give him control of your life let him be the captain of your ship let's go to Genesis 12. and go to chapter one or Genesis 12 1-5 I want to just uh talk about the father of our faith he had a great decision he had to make in his life very great decision so we'll go to verse one now the Lord had said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred I always want to end from my father's house into a land that I will show thee now notice this this decision he had to make so like in 75 years old he had loved ones he loved dearly he might even had plans to retire one day or maybe he was retired I don't know or maybe he had all these things he had planned out in his life you know I'm gonna do this for a certain amount of years I'm gonna live here then I'm gonna die at old age and notice this voice spoke to him God spoke to him and he hearkened to that voice never hearing God before in fact he was an idol worshiper as we we could come to the conclusion in the word that he was an idol worshiper but he was willing to make that great decision that changed his life and impacted not only him but us right he's the father of our faith instead of Abraham had to make that mindless decision we're going to have to make decisions similar to that in our life let's keep it going and I will make of thee a great nation I Will Bless thee and make thy name great and thou shall be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that cursed thee and in these shall all families of the earth be blessed so Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him now notice he didn't have to weigh it and say well I kind of love my family I kind of want to do this but he said God I'm taking out your word he didn't know where was going to take him he didn't know where to go he just walked by faith see eyes of Faith doesn't have to know where God is taking them but eyes of Faith believe that that God is going to direct their footsteps as they walk because he might only light you lights your way one or two steps at the time but that's okay now if he if God showed you every single thing then it wouldn't be a faith walk there's probably things in our lives that we question man why am I going through this my thing to you don't question God that's like a slap in his face don't question god notice Abraham didn't question God at that moment he could have said God who are you uh you know why why do I got to do this but no he just said God I'm going to do this so Abraham departed as the Lord has spoke unto him and lot went with him and Abram was 75 years old when he departed out of Iran and Abraham took Sarah his wife and a lot of his brother's son and all their substance they had gathered and the souls they had gotten haran they went forth to go into the land of Canaan into the land of Canaan they came maybe tonight you're looking for God to speak to you for a certain situation but is everything in your life in order is a question if you notice Abraham had to separate from lot and we'll read that real quick we'll read that uh verse Chapter 13 Verse five and a lot also went with them Abraham had flocks and hers intents in Atlanta was not able to Bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was not was great so they could not dwell together there was a Strife between the herdmen of Abraham's cattle and the Herdman of lots cattle and the canine and the Press tights dwell in the land and Abraham said in a lot let there be no Strife I pray thee between me and me and between my herdmen and thy Herdman for we are brother it's not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me if thou will take the left hand and I will go to the right or if thou depart in the right hand then I'll go to the left and lot lifted up his eyes beheld all the plane of Jordan and it was well watered now a lot made his decision based upon the the appealing of the land his lifestyle he he he had appealed onto him everywhere before the Lord destroyed Solomon and gomor even as a garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt as the land of his or then lot shows him all the plain of Jordan and lot Journey East and they separate themselves the one from another notice this and then notice after he separated himself and the Lord said unto Abraham after lot was separated from him see God is looking for us to separate from certain things he's asking to separate from how do you expect God to speak to you if you're not being obedient to him if he's telling you to leave something or leave somebody or whatever it is or to leave from your selfishness or to to choose him as your your savior in your lord then why are we expecting God to answer us if we're not doing the things he's asking us to do that's like brother Ron you're so when your your kids were growing up and you asked them to do chores and you say for instance you'll give them allowance they didn't do their chores but they're still expecting an allowance same thing with God how do we expect God to move in our lives if we're not following God the way he's telling us to we can't just make it up we can't just make up as we go we got to follow that's what Saul tried to do in in the Old Testament King Saul tried to do that well I sacrificed these things uh because I wanted to give it to you as a burnt offering and Samuel said obedience is greater than sacrifice that's what the Lord Delights in he doesn't enlightened how much you can do over here and there and there if you're not being obedient to him okay it's good to sacrifice but if you're if you're not being obedient to God it will do you no good listen to God don't make him repeat itself multiple multiple times just listening to God Saul had a chance and he he squanders opportunity praise God now the power of decision he's a decision you would say some more time will make will not only impact you but it'll impact your family and it may not I don't have a feeling right now but every decision that I make will impact my future defense my future family every fight every bad financial decision I make will impact my future family every bad funny decision that we make is going to impact those around us it may not hurt you right now but eventually it can the power of decision is so important they said well that's why it's so important to pray on decisions that we have to make don't just assume you're making the right decision take the time and ask the Lord is this your will for my life if you make the wrong decisions we will have to pay the consequences we see so many examples in the Bible Samson yes he was an elective of God but he gave his heart to Delilah and he had to pay with his life David David had to make David had consequences just because you are an elect child of God doesn't give you a free passage to make any old kind of decision you you want and not expect consequences in your life there's going to be consequences if you choose to to make a wrong decision knowingly make a wrong decision you're going to have to pay for that that decision and God is still gracious he will still help you but you still have to go through that so my my plea to you we all have made bad decisions in our lives okay raise is everybody being truthful all right we all made bad decisions in our life so let's stop making bad decisions let's start making decisions that will please let's start getting the mind to Christ all the time every day don't just wait until you got to make a big decision to get the mind of Christ but get the mind of Christ every day and something you got to fight for you got to strive for because the devil does not want you to get it he doesn't let's go to Galatians 5. so for instance so if I'm planting a garden and I plant all the seeds I till the ground make everything look nice but if I make the decision to not to water and take care of it guess what's going to happen I'm a Reaper I'm gonna sow I'm gonna get nothing so same thing in your life if you choose to reap little in your spiritual walk with God then guess what you're going to get little if you choose to reap nothing you're going to get nothing God isn't just going to just you know do everything for you yeah yeah He blesses the Justin unjust yes I believe that 100 amen but I don't want to just be blessed in that situation I want to be blessed in here my soul needs to be prospering in order for your soul to prosper you have to reap a lot a lot of work comes into your soul prospering it's not just something that just happens overnight but it's an everyday rugged life of grinding being disciplined being faithful to God if you're faithful to God he'll be faithful to you go to Galatians 5 or I think relation six I'm sorry so it says be not deceived God is Not Mott for whatsoever a man's soul that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall the flesh reap corruption be that soul to the spirit shall the spirit reap life Everlasting and let us not be wearing and well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not it's a promise it's a promise right there that's why it's so important we said before to have the mind of Christ Christ always wanted to please the father his life was a life of being a servant he wanted to help others he wanted to serve others and if he's our perfect example we have to do the same thing that's why the mind of Crisis isn't a isn't a take it or leave it but something you need to be striving for on a daily basis that's what Christ had except for God Knows Your Potential inside of you he does you have potential if you have the Holy Ghost Inside of You he wants that to grow see he doesn't want us just to be like a seed a seed has to get germanized and it starts to grow and eventually if that seeds of trees and grow into a tree so God is expecting us to be trees that's why I say it's like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water water is singular and the river is is plural because the water because the rivers are connected to One Source that's God we've got to be we got to be a tree we got to grow into a tree for maturity we need to God expects us to have fruit I don't want to if I have an apple tree I expect it one day to what to Bear apples so God expects us to Bear him fruits of the Holy Spirit right yeah and in order for us to do that and to keep preaching our potential we must die to ourselves die to your will to your thoughts your ideas and your plans I know we all have plans we got all planned out we want to do this and that with our lives but sometimes God is going to Halt those plans and you got to be willing to submit to that because if you're not willing to submit to that you will be most miserable I promise you if God has to drag you he'll drag you except Abraham probably had plans for his future right had hopes he had all figured out what he's going to do with his life but he was willing to forsake it all he was willing to make a choice make a decision that decision not only affected him but affected us after did it not and each trial you go through you have two choices one you can claim what it says in First Peter 1 verses 327 and keep putting the board please First Peter 1 chapter 3 through or chapter one verses three through seven blessed be the god of our father Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy has been guiding us unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead amen to inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and fadeth not away reserved in Heaven For You Verse 5 please who are kept by the power of God through faith notice that who are kept by the power of God through faith you play a part unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time verse 6. when ye greatly rejoiced thou now for a seat though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold Temptation no more time weathering ye greatly Rejoice read that with me weather in ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaveness through manifold Temptations so it's telling me not to complain not to look at it as a bad thing in my life but says greatly rejoice it's verse 7 please that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perish it though betrayed with fire be found unto the praise and honor and Glory at the peering of Jesus Christ that's what the trials are there for now for anything it's not because you're a bad kid but even says the lord loves you if he rebukes him chasing you if he lets the devil move in your life with situations like that it's for a reason and the devil doesn't even realize he's being used as a tool to help you to be in more of the image of God think about that the devil is being used as a tool to help you to get you more in the image of Jesus Christ because if you're looking at the trial how hard it is then you're never going to grow because character is a victory some of you had to fight after every time you got to fight that that character is not just something that's given so you got to fight for it let's go to Second Corinthians uh chapter 12. verses 9 through 11. praise God so go to verse 9. and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee imagine if we went to every trial like that imagine he said for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my affirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me I want to get there and I believe by faith I'm going to get there I rather glory in my affirmities that the power of Christ may be rest upon me verse 10 please therefore I take pleasure check this out in affirmities in reproaches when's the last time have you took pleasure in your infirmities and your approaches and your necessities and persecutions therefore I take pleasure and infirmities and reproaches and Necessities in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am made strong that's the time when when that strength when you feel weak and wore down Christ is being lifted up let him give you strength to carry on don't look at the trial how hard to look at God through the trial Lord where are you trying to mold and shape to me help me to be in the right position that I could receive what you want me to receive notice the attitude compared to that versus the other attitude or you can murmur and complain like the children of Israel did mermian complaining will get you nowhere instead just trust God he knows what you need you have a choice to look at the trial or how hard it is but look at Jesus he will get you through trust the process do you want to go around the mountain once or do you want to go around mountain twice you have the choice so either you can go one time or you can go twice you pick or you can go three times you can keep on going till you get it I'd rather just get it the first time than I have to keep going over and over I don't want to walk 40 years in the wilderness when I could have just you know have a two-day Journey you know just saying so there is gold in your life God wants to see and that and that is God Is His Image in you him being manifested in you so each choice you make is either going to lead you to more of his image being manifested or not let's go to Romans 8 and we'll close here and I can get five more minutes may I so Romans 8 almost done Romans 8 um 18-23. so it says so next time you're going through a trial and you just feel like everything is going wrong just remember this for I reckon that the suffering thing sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US praise God for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestations of the sons of God they're waiting for us all of us that's what they're waiting for for the creature was made subject to Van Vanity not willing but by the reason of him who have subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption unto the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know we know that we uh the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain until now not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even ourselves are grown within ourselves are waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption of our body so we go through a trial think about that it's not it's not even worthy to be compared of what you're going to inherit what you're going to receive think of every trial you go through you're growing to be more like him that's why I say with the Rapture is happening right now you don't just magically become in this image at that very moment but every decision every trial that you're making is shaping you he's using it to shape and mold you so you can be ready the the battle is we're still fighting we can still get Victory God is still calling us higher God isn't calling us to sit back and recline but he's calling us to take what's rightfully ours more of him he said blessed are they who hunger and throw us at the righteousness for they shall be filled amen I'm read a quote and we will close actually I think yes the time has now come now where he got to make a decision I put this challenge to anybody to accept God's word maybe some here listening tonight maybe for the first time I don't know but take God at his word no matter what's wrong with you if you make your heart right with God and promise God that you'll serve him and then he'll take him at his word don't pay no attention to the results you have then just believe and God will bring it to pass whatever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them and they shall be given to you you shall have them if you believe you'll receive them you see what what I mean the hour is here um Lord willing uh next time I Minister actually do a little series on the power of decision uh so it's just like kind of like the the foundation of it but I just felt my heart just to continue this so this the the main thing guys are going to get the power of your decision is so important it's not only going to affect you but it's going to affect those around you so if we would Rec it's going to affect your walk with God it's going to affect everything around you so next time we make a decision let's go about it prayerfully let's think about it don't just make these willy-nilly decisions yeah it may sound good for the moment but it can affect you in the long run doesn't matter how old you are in fact when you're I believe when you're a kid you should start making this make a good decisions listen to your parents because when you choose not to listen to your parents you're creating that bad habit and as you get older you're not going to start listening to God because God has placed your parents in your life for a reason for you to listen to them to respect them honor thy father and thy mother for a reason so you want to start start off good when your mom and dad's ask you to do something just do it don't question it because when you get older you can start questioning God it is it starts it starts as a habit and it becomes something you can't can't overcome if you just just cut off at the head right now maybe you guys have been disrespectful it's okay make that change right now I don't think you can respect too much I don't think I don't matter how old you are I don't think you can respect too much respect is a lost art I want us let's be respectful as we can because how you treat others is how you're going to treat God it's the truth it's the truth praise God there's a let us stand amen I just uh we'll bow our heads dear Lord Jesus we uh are they so thankful Lord that you're alive and well Lord we're so thankful Lord that you're still moving in the hearts Lord of Believers we're so thankful Lord that you're still calling us higher Lord and Lord as we come here today Lord we don't want to miss what you've spoken to us Lord we don't want to leave it here at church but Lord we wanted to follow us in our hearts Lord let it find such a deep resting place in our hearts Lord that we can't even not think about it Lord I pray Lord that we would just not only be here as we said before be doers of this word Lord I pray forgive us Lord for decisions that we made this week that we didn't think about or we made bad decisions Lord we want to just make a declaration Lord From This Day Forward we want to just go prayerfully about things so we want to have the mind of Christ when we're in in situations Lord because it's not going to come a time where we can always pray for three days under a week but Lord You're Going to require us to make a decision right then and there Lord we want to make sure that we have the mind of God when we're making that decision Lord and I pray you just forgive us Lord for anything that we've done today Lord that was displeasing unto you Lord I pray you just washed Us by Your Word Lord cleanse us with your blood Lord help us Lord when we go through a trials that we wouldn't complain but Lord we'll remember what it says in Romans 8 Lord that our suffering is not worthy to be comparative what we're going to receive on the other side Lord and Lord Jesus we thank you for the trials may we from this day forward Lord will glory in our infirmities well glory and our persecutions knowing Lord that you're moving in our life Lord you even said in your word those that live Godly will suffer persecution so it should come by no surprise to us Lord when we come in those situations Lord that we're living pleasing unto you for getting persecuted for the right things Lord and Lord as we come here today we come before you in Faith Lord just asking all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen can we sing fill my cup fill my
