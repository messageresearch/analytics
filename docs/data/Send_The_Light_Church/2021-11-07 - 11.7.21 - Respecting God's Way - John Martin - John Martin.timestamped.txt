[30:42] it's been a a rough road for each one of
[30:44] us
[30:46] a lot of ups and downs
[30:48] a lot of training
[30:51] the
[30:52] school of hard knocks as it were
[30:56] lord you're
[30:58] bringing us into the character of
[31:00] yourself
[31:02] that's not easy
[31:04] but we want to thank you today for
[31:06] keeping us through it
[31:08] lord when we want to at times give up or
[31:10] just
[31:13] sit by in the
[31:15] in the
[31:16] back seat and as it were and not
[31:19] not press in
[31:20] lord you still had mercy on us
[31:23] you still want to see us through
[31:26] or from the depths of our heart we say
[31:27] thank you this morning
[31:29] pray that your presence would come and
[31:31] just direct your thoughts in this
[31:34] service today and that you'd help us to
[31:37] know
[31:39] lord what your will
[31:41] is for our lives we pray bless the
[31:44] reading of of the word and
[31:46] lord the the quotes and the things that
[31:48] would be spoken may you inspire each and
[31:51] every one of them to our hearts that we
[31:54] might hear from heaven today
[31:56] commit the service with all of our needs
[31:58] may there be a faith rise in our heart
[32:00] no matter what the need would be in our
[32:01] lives
[32:02] lord that faith would rise that we could
[32:05] claim the promises of god today
[32:08] we've committed all to you give you the
[32:10] praise now for we ask it in jesus
[32:12] precious name amen
[32:15] amen first corinthians chapter 14
[32:18] starting with verse number 32
[32:23] verse 32 and 33 read like this and the
[32:26] spirit of the prophets are subject to
[32:29] the prophets for god is not the author
[32:31] of confusion
[32:34] amen but a peace
[32:36] as in all churches of the saints
[32:39] and then verse 40. let all things be
[32:41] done decently
[32:43] and in order
[32:44] god bless you may be seated
[32:49] um
[32:52] i'm going to follow brother mark and ask
[32:54] you a question before i start
[32:58] how many has seen our church
[33:01] grow
[33:02] in unity the last six to nine months
[33:07] keep your keep your hands up if you
[33:08] would have felt the love of god
[33:12] growing in our church
[33:15] has felt a good spirit in our church
[33:19] okay praise the lord god has certainly
[33:21] blessed us
[33:23] psalms 133 verse 1 says
[33:26] behold
[33:27] how good and how pleasant it is
[33:31] for brethren
[33:32] to dwell together in unity
[33:35] now look how he compares the unity
[33:39] of brotherhood
[33:40] in verse two and three it is like the
[33:43] precious ointment upon the head
[33:46] that ran down the beard even aaron's
[33:50] beard
[33:51] and went down into the skirts of his
[33:54] garments
[33:56] so the unity of his whole body was just
[34:00] there saturated with this ointment
[34:03] precious ointment amen unity is precious
[34:06] and then he says the same in verse 3
[34:09] this unity is as the dew of hermann
[34:14] as the dew that descended upon the
[34:16] mountains of zion
[34:18] for there the lord commanded the
[34:20] blessings
[34:22] even life forevermore
[34:27] it's
[34:28] it's from
[34:30] the unity in which god commands his
[34:33] blessings
[34:35] think about it
[34:39] how many times have we heard brother
[34:40] brandon talk about if he could just get
[34:42] everybody in one mind one accord there
[34:44] one be one feeble one among us now if
[34:48] you could just get my revelation if you
[34:50] just recognize i'm the prophet if you
[34:52] could no
[34:53] just get in the unity
[34:59] remember when god spoke to our church
[35:02] he said there shouldn't be any isms and
[35:04] schisms
[35:05] that we should pray for one another love
[35:07] one another
[35:08] and he wanted us to be united in him
[35:12] and he said if we would do this that we
[35:14] would see things that we've never seen
[35:16] before
[35:16] [Music]
[35:18] god has certainly blessed us
[35:22] but brother branham said satan won't
[35:24] allow it to stay that way
[35:27] now i want you to understand what we're
[35:28] up against we're not up against one
[35:31] another
[35:32] we're up against a devil who will not
[35:35] allow us to stay unified
[35:38] in the message christ is the mystery of
[35:40] god revealed
[35:41] brother brahm says love one another
[35:43] above everything love one another
[35:47] no matter what the devil tries to say
[35:50] he says now you're all one great big
[35:52] sweet group now
[35:54] but remember my warning see satan won't
[35:57] let that stay that way
[36:00] no sir he'll shoot everything
[36:05] in other words he's not going to stop
[36:06] he's he's going to do his job until he's
[36:09] put in
[36:10] hell come on
[36:16] god wants us to better handle the devil
[36:18] here
[36:20] he wants us to know where to to put him
[36:23] under our feet
[36:25] wants us to have the character that we
[36:27] need to kick him out
[36:31] he'll shoot everything if he has to
[36:33] bring somebody in to make his target
[36:36] he'll bring some critic or unbeliever
[36:39] and sit him down and cause him to
[36:41] fellowship with you under the quietness
[36:44] and things
[36:45] and then he'll shoot that guy with some
[36:47] kind of poison stuff
[36:52] i don't know but
[37:03] and he'll start through the church with
[37:05] it he says don't you take sides with it
[37:09] don't you have anything to do
[37:12] with anything else
[37:16] you stay right loving sweet kind to one
[37:19] another pray for that man
[37:22] that he'll be saved to or that woman or
[37:26] whoever who it is he says just pray for
[37:28] them
[37:29] and stick one with another
[37:32] amen and stay with your pastor see he's
[37:35] a shepherd
[37:36] you give him respects
[37:38] he'll lead you through because he's
[37:39] ordained to do so
[37:41] he's ordained of god to do so
[37:43] now do you remember that
[37:46] congregation says amen
[37:49] the enemy will come and when he does
[37:52] just clean that much closer together
[37:56] and the one that the devil is using for
[37:58] an enemy will either
[38:00] get out
[38:02] or come in
[38:04] and be one of you
[38:07] showing
[38:08] the importance of sticking
[38:11] together
[38:13] he says don't
[38:15] never plan or talk or make yourself
[38:18] clannish
[38:20] he said we are one
[38:22] i couldn't say
[38:24] left hand i'm mad at you
[38:27] i'm gonna take you away because you're
[38:29] not
[38:30] a right hand
[38:32] he's my left hand and i want him to stay
[38:35] there
[38:37] even the little tip of my finger
[38:40] i want to stay right there every little
[38:42] part of my buddy's body stay right there
[38:45] and god wants us as a body of believers
[38:48] to stay right exactly with one another
[38:52] right with one another
[38:55] wow this is a responsibility that means
[38:57] i have to try the bible says endeavor to
[39:00] keep the unity of the spirit you know
[39:02] most people have the attitude well if
[39:04] you don't agree with me that's fine i'm
[39:06] still going to stay where i'm at
[39:08] not caring about unity there's no care
[39:11] about unity
[39:13] well how can we be of god and not care
[39:15] about unity amen that's right amen
[39:19] amen it'd be different if we're talking
[39:21] to some person who's anti-god right
[39:25] understand
[39:27] but we're believers
[39:30] and you know we don't we're not all
[39:32] going to agree with the same thing we
[39:33] don't eat the same food we don't drive
[39:34] the same cars we don't wear the same
[39:36] clothes we don't desire the same foods
[39:39] we're different people but we should all
[39:41] be unified in christ
[39:44] no matter what
[39:47] he says now you've got tapes on that
[39:49] you've got tapes
[39:51] on what we
[39:52] believe
[39:54] you've got tapes on discipline in the
[39:55] church
[39:57] how we behave ourselves in the church
[39:59] how we got to come here together and sit
[40:01] down in heavenly places he says don't
[40:03] stay at home if god is in your heart
[40:06] you can't hardly wait for them doors to
[40:09] get open out yonder
[40:11] to get in here to fellowship with your
[40:16] brothers
[40:18] now if you don't feel that way
[40:20] then i tell you it's time you got to
[40:24] praying
[40:27] in other words we we always must have
[40:29] that and if we're not feeling that then
[40:30] we just got to spend more time with god
[40:34] amen
[40:35] now for this morning's
[40:36] message i want to for a subject i want
[40:39] to talk about maintaining respect
[40:41] through spiritual growth we are a young
[40:44] church in one sense
[40:48] because we've got new believers and and
[40:50] i'll be honest with you we're always
[40:52] growing amen and everything that god's
[40:55] trying to show you show us is new to us
[40:59] even though we've been in the message a
[41:00] while
[41:01] so we need to maintain respect through
[41:03] spiritual growth and i want to entitle
[41:05] this message respecting god's way
[41:10] through unity
[41:12] respecting god's way of unity
[41:18] oftentimes god is misunderstood he has
[41:20] been misunderstood
[41:22] brother branham said he was
[41:23] misunderstood
[41:25] we can be misunderstood as well
[41:28] sometimes things happen in our church
[41:32] that are misunderstood
[41:34] and they don't seem right to us
[41:37] sometimes things are handled in a
[41:39] particular way
[41:40] that maybe would seem odd
[41:43] wouldn't seem right
[41:46] it would be no different in our homes
[41:48] it's happened in our homes
[41:50] in our businesses
[41:52] sometimes you can't make it through the
[41:53] drive-thru without them getting your
[41:56] order right
[41:57] because of some misunderstanding
[42:01] i don't know how many times i've said
[42:02] something i've had somebody on the phone
[42:04] they've heard me
[42:05] and they come back and they say
[42:07] something just completely different
[42:09] and the person on the fold heard me
[42:11] the correct way
[42:12] so our minds could be in other places
[42:14] this is why when we come to church we
[42:15] need to be prepared we need to be in the
[42:17] spirit
[42:20] i thought it would be important
[42:23] for our church to know
[42:25] a little bit more about me
[42:28] perhaps a better understanding
[42:30] of why i might do the things that i do
[42:33] and say the things that i say
[42:36] i want the church to know what's behind
[42:38] my decisions
[42:41] why i do what i do
[42:45] i'll say this i'm always looking for the
[42:48] unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
[42:51] whatever is happening in this church
[42:56] you have to put a priority somewhere
[43:00] so i'm watching a person's spirit much
[43:02] more than i'm listening to their words
[43:06] it's not that i disrespect what you're
[43:07] saying
[43:08] i'm just
[43:11] just the way i've been built amen right
[43:15] i pay attention to people's spirits
[43:21] first thessalonians chapter 5 verse 12
[43:25] says and we beseech you brethren to know
[43:28] them which labor among you
[43:31] and they're over you in the lord and
[43:33] admonish you so i want it's important
[43:36] for you to know me now i'll be honest
[43:38] with you i don't want to know one of
[43:40] your sins
[43:42] ever
[43:43] ever
[43:44] your fault your i don't
[43:48] we have
[43:50] a blood
[43:51] amen for that situation
[44:00] and i'm not eager to tell you all of
[44:02] mine i'm just like you
[44:05] but i will say this
[44:07] i got just as many as you
[44:09] can
[44:12] but i want you to know
[44:13] me
[44:15] i want to know you
[44:17] we're
[44:18] god is growing our church
[44:20] people are going to come in
[44:25] and we need to know
[44:30] how we ought to be in church
[44:32] in the body
[44:37] that word admonish
[44:39] means
[44:40] to put in mind that is to caution to
[44:43] warn to reprove
[44:45] gently
[44:48] so i looked at that word reprove that
[44:49] word reprove means to disapprove of
[44:52] strongly to criticize correct especially
[44:56] gently
[44:58] so know them that labor among you are
[45:01] over you
[45:02] that they they have a job that really
[45:05] isn't pleasant
[45:08] first we're to know them and then verse
[45:10] 13 and to esteem them
[45:12] very highly in love
[45:14] for their work's sake and be at peace
[45:17] among yourselves
[45:20] they have a job to do
[45:22] it's hard to esteem anyone who corrects
[45:25] you or disapproves of you strongly
[45:29] but if you know that they're committed
[45:31] to building your character and watching
[45:34] over your soul then it's much easier to
[45:36] esteem them
[45:38] much highly for the for the lord's work
[45:41] amen
[45:43] and he ends it be at peace among
[45:46] yourselves
[45:49] be at peace
[45:50] it's hard to be
[45:51] at peace with somebody
[45:53] if you're not in peace
[45:55] and with yourself right
[45:58] it's hard to be a peacemaker
[46:00] if that peace is not so strong inside of
[46:04] you
[46:06] i don't want to sing peace like a river
[46:08] i want peace like a river
[46:11] because then i can be a
[46:12] peacemaker now we exhort you brethren
[46:16] warn them that are unruly comfort the
[46:18] feeble minded support the weak be
[46:19] patient towards man this is a lot of
[46:21] stuff to do
[46:23] and see that none render evil for evil
[46:26] unto any man
[46:29] but ever follow that which is good both
[46:32] among yourselves and to all men amen
[46:38] now the scriptures declare that the
[46:40] spirit of the prophets is subject to the
[46:43] prophets
[46:46] major prophets
[46:48] are a mouthpiece of god we're taught
[46:50] that
[46:52] minor prophets
[46:53] are also a mouthpiece of god
[46:57] god has chosen the foolishness of
[46:59] preaching to save men so preachers are a
[47:02] mouthpiece of god
[47:05] god will also
[47:06] use the mouth of somebody's testimony
[47:10] revelations chapter 19 verse 10 says and
[47:12] i fell at his feet to worship him and he
[47:14] said unto me see thou do it not right
[47:18] from other fellow servant and of thy
[47:20] brethren that have the testimony of
[47:22] jesus worship god for the testimony of
[47:26] jesus
[47:27] is the spirit
[47:29] of prophecy
[47:32] so god can use the mouth of someone's
[47:35] testimony of jesus
[47:38] even to be a spirit of prophecy
[47:44] we also understand that god uses some to
[47:47] speak with tongues
[47:51] so god has
[47:53] um
[47:54] a variety of ways
[47:57] to speak
[47:59] amen we just can't put god in a box
[48:04] he has
[48:05] a body ministry
[48:09] god can even have more than one
[48:11] mouthpiece on the scene at a time
[48:15] more than one prophet
[48:17] we see this during elijah and elisha
[48:23] now
[48:24] the thing is
[48:28] god is not going to have more than one
[48:30] prophet on the scene
[48:32] with
[48:33] the message for the people at the same
[48:35] time
[48:37] because that would cause confusion
[48:41] but trying to get to a point here
[48:43] god can have more than one preacher
[48:45] among us it's true amen he can have more
[48:48] than
[48:49] one testimony being given
[48:51] he can have more than one person
[48:53] speaking in tongues
[48:56] but if god has more than one among us if
[48:59] god is truly in control of each one
[49:02] being used all things will be done
[49:04] decently and in order and there will be
[49:07] no confusion
[49:10] amen
[49:14] the holy ghost inside of us as long as
[49:16] he's in control there will be harmony
[49:19] god will work in harmony
[49:31] we know that god has an order
[49:35] and he has ordained and called a
[49:38] fivefold ministry for our perfection for
[49:41] our benefit
[49:43] but we also know that satan has
[49:45] ministers that appear as ministers of
[49:47] light the bible says
[49:49] amen but their job is simply to keep us
[49:53] from perfection
[49:56] not so strong that they just gonna take
[49:58] us off the deep end
[50:01] just to keep us from pressing in keep us
[50:04] from
[50:05] uh to the complete image of jesus christ
[50:07] the complete character to keep us from
[50:10] perfection that's their job
[50:14] they
[50:15] they have other agendas
[50:20] and to achieve those agendas that they
[50:22] have
[50:23] satan works through
[50:25] confusion
[50:28] brother branham
[50:29] we've heard that you know brother
[50:31] brandon said that there's
[50:33] there's a lot of mape believers right
[50:35] right
[50:36] but did you ever hear brother branham
[50:37] say we've got a lot of make-believe
[50:40] preachers
[50:42] and a lot of make-believe prophets
[50:45] he said it the rising raising jerry is
[50:48] his daughter
[50:51] wow this is strong and and very very
[50:56] like
[50:57] i need to be careful
[51:03] i don't believe god's fivefold ministry
[51:05] that's ordained to bring a bride to
[51:07] perfection is going to bring confusion
[51:10] to her
[51:15] just don't think that right god is not
[51:17] the author of confusion
[51:20] somehow that five-fold ministry is going
[51:23] to work in harmony
[51:26] if it's you to the lord
[51:28] amen
[51:31] god knows what he's doing
[51:33] amen
[51:34] man only thinks he knows what he's doing
[51:37] but god knows
[51:39] god has placed pastors in the church
[51:42] more than just
[51:44] for preaching
[51:45] that's true amen that's good
[51:48] they're actually play a
[51:53] uh
[51:54] acute role
[51:56] a crucial role
[51:59] and that role is to take us through
[52:01] amen
[52:03] the brahm didn't say that of any of the
[52:04] other
[52:07] four offices
[52:11] but the officer the office of a pastor
[52:16] isn't good enough alone
[52:20] that's why we got a five-fold ministry
[52:22] brother brandon says rapturing faith
[52:23] lies in the tapes
[52:25] so we're not going to make a rapture
[52:27] just staying out of the tapes right
[52:29] that's good staying with the other
[52:30] four-fold see everyone has their place
[52:34] pastors they actually are the burden
[52:37] bearers of the church
[52:40] they carry things that most sheep are
[52:42] not even aware of
[52:45] they see things that most sheep do not
[52:48] see
[52:50] they are shepherds
[52:51] of their flock of sheep
[52:54] they pay close attention to what the
[52:56] sheep are feeding
[52:58] on just take a regular shepherd
[53:02] that's right if a shepherd cares about
[53:04] that sheep he's he's interested that
[53:06] they're not eating a bunch of weeds
[53:09] or grass with the weeds
[53:13] brother branham said in the message what
[53:15] it takes to overcome all unbelief
[53:18] he said so each of you who has a godly
[53:20] pastor has a gift from god in your
[53:22] church
[53:23] a shepherd pastor it means a shepherd
[53:26] to watch over
[53:28] the flock
[53:30] to teach them the word of god so you see
[53:32] that
[53:33] the pastor has a different role than
[53:35] just preaching you know some people who
[53:37] don't understand that they they they
[53:40] just look at it as a as a
[53:42] as a pastor who who
[53:45] he just he's just a preacher of the
[53:46] church
[53:50] and and some uh some of those you know
[53:52] they just they just want your money
[53:56] not truly understanding the role of the
[53:58] pastor yes it's to teach the word of god
[54:00] but they also have to watch over the
[54:02] flock
[54:05] first peter chapter 5 verse 1
[54:08] reads the elders which are among you i
[54:11] exhort
[54:13] who am also an elder
[54:16] and a witness of the sufferings of
[54:18] christ
[54:19] and also a partaker of the glory that
[54:23] shall be revealed
[54:25] feed the flock of god
[54:28] which is among you
[54:33] taking the oversight thereof not by
[54:36] constraint
[54:39] but willingly
[54:41] not by filthy looker but of a ready mine
[54:47] a pastor
[54:49] should never ever be forced
[54:53] to be a pastor
[54:58] he should do it willingly amen
[55:01] god loveth a cheerful giver because the
[55:02] pastor is truly if you ever remember
[55:05] brother i'm talking about what a pastor
[55:07] is typed to is a lily
[55:08] pastor lily
[55:10] and people just come and take from them
[55:12] all different the birds the bees they
[55:14] just they come and take a pastor's job
[55:16] is is a total giving job
[55:20] he's got to do it willingly
[55:22] not for money
[55:24] right that's right it's true
[55:27] should not be i i thank god that i can
[55:29] stand here today by the grace of god
[55:32] that i've never taken a penny
[55:35] from any of you
[55:37] or from anyone
[55:42] i'm grateful that god has provided me a
[55:45] job
[55:46] amen and you've heard me before i'm
[55:48] grateful for my son
[55:50] who's helping me
[55:54] i'll just pray that god would raise him
[55:57] up not only to
[55:59] handle trust you too well
[56:02] but to handle the things that god has
[56:04] for him
[56:07] so not
[56:08] for filthy luker but of a ready mind
[56:13] neither as being lords
[56:17] that's really good control freaks
[56:21] over
[56:23] god's heritage
[56:28] so here we're supposed to take the
[56:30] oversight
[56:33] with the right attitude willingly for
[56:35] the right reasons a ready mind
[56:38] to control things
[56:42] but not as a lord amen
[56:45] wow
[56:46] you know what it's going to take the
[56:48] holy ghost
[56:52] you're going to have to be a man of
[56:54] patience
[56:55] lots of
[56:56] patience
[56:58] because you just can't go up to somebody
[57:01] and say
[57:08] no
[57:09] the way that you do it
[57:11] is an example where's our where's our
[57:13] scriptures
[57:15] they're not working are they
[57:18] this is how you do it
[57:19] you're an example
[57:22] just like jesus was amen he went down
[57:25] there and washed the feet and amen
[57:28] he's the one that
[57:30] lay down his life for his brethren
[57:34] that's the truth
[57:37] the example
[57:39] is important
[57:43] now the example that we set
[57:46] is not an example where we're like
[57:49] perfect in everything that we do
[57:51] right
[57:52] but the example
[57:54] on how we handle things when we haven't
[57:58] done the perfect right yeah that's right
[58:01] that's good
[58:02] it's good because no man can stand
[58:03] behind the dust and say i'm so perfect
[58:05] we'll call my example
[58:15] and when the chief shepherd shall appear
[58:18] we shall receive a crown of glory that
[58:20] faith out of the way
[58:22] likewise you younger submit yourselves
[58:24] to the elders see respecting god's way
[58:26] of unity
[58:28] yeah all of you be subject one to
[58:30] another and be clothed with humility for
[58:31] god resisteth right
[58:35] now did you know you could be proud and
[58:37] be sitting in church that's true
[58:39] so this is not just unbelievers
[58:42] this is not the world
[58:46] god's talking about a spirit that can
[58:47] get on anybody at any time for any
[58:49] reason
[58:52] and no matter how much we're a son of
[58:53] god if that spirit is on us god is
[58:55] resisting us yes
[58:59] for god resisted the problem by giving
[59:01] grace to the humble humble yourselves
[59:03] therefore under the mighty hand of god
[59:05] that he may exalt you in due time how
[59:08] many wants to be exalted in christ
[59:10] the answer is through humility amen
[59:14] that's right that's right get so low
[59:17] that god says there's someone i can use
[59:18] that's what he had to do with moses
[59:20] that's what he had to do with saul
[59:24] that's what he had to do with jonah
[59:27] and that's what god has to do with us
[59:30] the pastor is the shepherd
[59:32] of
[59:33] the flock of sheep
[59:37] they shepherd the
[59:39] responsibility of the flock
[59:42] and that responsibility is to lead the
[59:44] flock towards the character of christ
[59:50] it's it's much deeper than what we think
[59:53] right because sometimes we come to truth
[59:55] well i just want to see what's being
[59:56] preached if it's you know what i've been
[59:57] praying about see if it's like you're
[59:59] just going to help me get what i'm
[1:00:00] looking for and you know we got our own
[1:00:03] theme going on
[1:00:05] i'm not against it but what i'm trying
[1:00:07] to say it's much greater it's a much
[1:00:09] greater situation than that
[1:00:12] god is not interested in how well
[1:00:15] trusted tools doing right right that's
[1:00:18] the truth
[1:00:20] he's interested in how good my character
[1:00:22] is doing
[1:00:24] so there's got to be a priority is that
[1:00:26] that god don't care about trust you how
[1:00:28] could i ever think those thoughts he was
[1:00:29] the one that put it there right yeah
[1:00:32] sure he's interested in it but he's not
[1:00:34] interested in it above what
[1:00:36] he's really looking for right right it's
[1:00:39] to see his character in us
[1:00:44] not what we know
[1:00:46] but what we're living amen
[1:00:50] as i said i don't care about anyone's
[1:00:51] fault sins mistakes failures
[1:00:54] but i'm concerned as a pastor
[1:00:57] is how much we're moving in the
[1:00:59] direction of god's character
[1:01:02] that's what i'm looking at when i'm
[1:01:04] looking at everyone's spirit
[1:01:08] if that isn't your bullseye for your
[1:01:11] life
[1:01:13] things are just going to seem out of
[1:01:14] place
[1:01:16] to you
[1:01:17] amen
[1:01:18] amen come on amen
[1:01:20] please catch that
[1:01:22] amen
[1:01:23] ultimately the responsibility of the
[1:01:25] church falls back on the pastor right
[1:01:28] it's true
[1:01:30] now if you can imagine being in a church
[1:01:32] where there was an order
[1:01:34] and everyone did what they thought they
[1:01:35] wanted to do
[1:01:37] then you can imagine what it would be
[1:01:38] like to be in church without a pastor
[1:01:43] a lot of confusion a lot of chaos
[1:01:45] now we're all god sheep of his
[1:01:49] heritage amen
[1:01:51] but in god's great pasture remember this
[1:01:53] there's no confusion
[1:01:56] there's order
[1:01:58] god will not offer any confusion
[1:02:01] but he will offer peace as in all
[1:02:05] churches of the saints
[1:02:10] sometimes we get so strong and trying to
[1:02:12] bring our opinion and and bring what we
[1:02:15] want to do and we we think we're so
[1:02:16] right that we're not thinking about what
[1:02:19] we're causing
[1:02:22] jonathan knows this i've in at work we
[1:02:26] we teach
[1:02:27] that we don't want
[1:02:29] to try to correct problems with while
[1:02:32] creating new ones
[1:02:35] it's not the way god does it right
[1:02:39] can you imagine being a surgeon and
[1:02:41] we're going to take out this little bit
[1:02:42] of cancer and as we're get taking out
[1:02:44] this little bit of cancer that's wrapped
[1:02:46] around these organs and we cut through
[1:02:48] this and oops i got the cancer out but
[1:02:50] yeah the man is gonna die now because of
[1:02:52] what you did just other organs
[1:03:02] in order for things to remain
[1:03:05] in a
[1:03:06] right state in any church
[1:03:09] god raises up shepherds who will take
[1:03:11] the oversight thereof
[1:03:14] they look diligently into the flock
[1:03:17] into what's happening in a spiritual
[1:03:20] realm
[1:03:23] they're not just responsible for the
[1:03:25] preaching but to make sure that there
[1:03:27] isn't
[1:03:28] confusion entering the door
[1:03:36] confusion is a sure sign
[1:03:38] that god is missing
[1:03:42] just look at every time there's been
[1:03:44] confusion between you and your wife
[1:03:46] you and your children
[1:03:48] you and some relative
[1:03:50] right you and your neighbor
[1:03:52] you never feel good about it
[1:03:54] something is missing right man it's true
[1:03:58] of course pride says it's them
[1:04:02] i said it clearly
[1:04:04] i don't know what's wrong with them
[1:04:07] no concern for the unity
[1:04:09] only concerned about getting your point
[1:04:11] across
[1:04:15] i know a very respected pastor in this
[1:04:18] message we might say he's one of the top
[1:04:23] i believe
[1:04:24] it well known and respected by most
[1:04:29] when he has a visiting minister to speak
[1:04:32] at his church
[1:04:34] if he leaves that church with questions
[1:04:38] among the body he simply doesn't have
[1:04:41] them come back again
[1:04:47] think about that statement
[1:04:58] it isn't that he doesn't believe he's
[1:05:00] called
[1:05:01] right
[1:05:02] doesn't believe he's not gifted right
[1:05:05] it just means that he's not yielding his
[1:05:07] gift or himself
[1:05:09] completely
[1:05:11] to the lord
[1:05:13] because god is not going to alter
[1:05:14] confusion in any church
[1:05:23] it's something that we ought to be
[1:05:24] concerned about when we're trying to
[1:05:25] help somebody
[1:05:30] it's not about the point that you're
[1:05:32] bringing
[1:05:39] god
[1:05:40] god's true ministry
[1:05:42] won't alter confusion
[1:05:45] the spirit of the prophets are subject
[1:05:47] to the prophets you're subject one to
[1:05:49] another
[1:05:50] amen
[1:05:56] the shepherd watches over the flak
[1:06:01] they're responsible for the overall
[1:06:03] decisions
[1:06:06] they're seeing things in like i said a
[1:06:08] more acute way because they're watching
[1:06:11] for things in a spiritual realm
[1:06:15] amen
[1:06:16] and that's what that pastor did he was
[1:06:18] watching what was happening in a
[1:06:19] spiritual realm he knows this just
[1:06:21] doesn't work
[1:06:22] when this stuff happens it's not good
[1:06:24] for the church
[1:06:26] it's not healthy for the church when
[1:06:27] there's confusion among the body right
[1:06:30] it's true
[1:06:31] so let's put an end to it here's how we
[1:06:32] put it into it we just stop it right
[1:06:36] it's good
[1:06:37] because from one pastor to another
[1:06:39] evangelist or a teacher you don't sit
[1:06:41] there and try to
[1:06:43] prove he's wrong
[1:06:45] you knock on the door and
[1:06:47] you try to share
[1:06:50] but you know what if i know i was going
[1:06:52] to be preaching somewhere
[1:06:54] i'm sure when brother mark stood up here
[1:06:56] and he was preaching he he spent some
[1:06:58] time with the lord wanting to make sure
[1:07:00] that everything was going to be exactly
[1:07:02] the way that it needed to be
[1:07:05] and a preacher is not interested in the
[1:07:07] flock
[1:07:12] in the unity of the flock let me say
[1:07:13] this correctly in the unity of the flock
[1:07:16] you're not respecting the
[1:07:26] pulpit there are things that are going
[1:07:28] to be happening in the church but a good
[1:07:30] shepherd watches the spirit of the
[1:07:32] things that are happening
[1:07:34] first john chapter 4 verse 1
[1:07:36] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[1:07:39] the spirits whether they are of god
[1:07:41] because many false prophets are gone
[1:07:43] until the same thing the prophet said
[1:07:46] try the spirit
[1:07:47] well the spirit of god is not going to
[1:07:48] bring confusion
[1:07:50] in fact it's going to separate the
[1:07:51] confusion it's going to dissolve god is
[1:07:54] a dissolver of doubts not one that in in
[1:07:57] authors them
[1:07:59] come on
[1:08:01] i don't care what you know what how much
[1:08:03] you think you're right if it's not the
[1:08:05] right spirit i can't say it's of god
[1:08:08] amen
[1:08:09] no i'm not saying that where the bible's
[1:08:10] just trying the spirit it's the same
[1:08:12] trying the spirits don't try the person
[1:08:14] that's the right he's not the person
[1:08:16] it's not the person
[1:08:20] it's the spirit on the person
[1:08:22] at any time we can be in the spirit we
[1:08:24] can be in the flesh
[1:08:26] hereby know ye the spirit of god every
[1:08:29] spirit that confesses that jesus christ
[1:08:31] has come in the flesh is of god and
[1:08:33] every spirit that confesseth not that
[1:08:35] jesus has come in the flesh
[1:08:37] is not of god and this is the spirit of
[1:08:39] antichrist wherever you've heard that it
[1:08:41] should come and now already is in the
[1:08:45] world
[1:08:46] i'll say it like this jesus in our flesh
[1:08:48] is not
[1:08:49] going to author confusion
[1:08:53] amen amen so if you see something's not
[1:08:56] happening in a relationship
[1:09:00] in church
[1:09:02] i'm telling you need to step back and
[1:09:04] look at is jesus really
[1:09:07] having his way in your flesh
[1:09:15] this order that the bible teaches
[1:09:18] and the prophet also taught it about
[1:09:20] speaking in tongues
[1:09:23] it's for each and every one of us
[1:09:25] and as soon as we set foot in the church
[1:09:27] we have a personal responsibility to
[1:09:30] keep order
[1:09:31] the pastor is just watching it all right
[1:09:37] but can you imagine if you all came in
[1:09:38] here with your own you know what i'm
[1:09:40] going to start doing things here my way
[1:09:43] can you imagine
[1:09:45] what would happen in the church
[1:09:48] there wouldn't be any
[1:09:50] the unity would go off the tubes
[1:09:53] there'd be lots of isms and schisms
[1:09:55] before you know it it would just be a
[1:09:57] total mess would it not
[1:10:01] but the spirit of the prophets the
[1:10:02] subject thrives we need to be subject
[1:10:04] one to another
[1:10:06] we need to respect one another amen
[1:10:10] we're all sheep of god's great pastor
[1:10:12] there's no big eyes there's no little
[1:10:14] use
[1:10:15] i also want to say this there is no
[1:10:17] respecter of persons
[1:10:20] of
[1:10:21] personalities
[1:10:22] or gifts
[1:10:24] we are all one in christ
[1:10:27] but to keep there from being confusion
[1:10:29] we must respect god's way of unity
[1:10:34] amen now even though all the martin clan
[1:10:36] is one family
[1:10:38] our children were duty-bound to obey
[1:10:41] their mother
[1:10:44] and their mother
[1:10:46] is still duty-bound to over her husband
[1:10:52] they are all duty-bound to keep order
[1:10:56] and yet
[1:10:57] they're all one family
[1:11:01] see god is not going to alter confusion
[1:11:04] i'm sure we've all experienced our
[1:11:06] children when they wanted their way bad
[1:11:08] enough if they didn't get what they want
[1:11:09] from daddy they go to mama
[1:11:13] and what does it do
[1:11:14] causes confusion amen
[1:11:18] same thing in the church can't get what
[1:11:19] i want from the pastor
[1:11:23] yeah right
[1:11:24] i'll go to the missus
[1:11:26] what does it do it can cause confusion
[1:11:30] the best thing is you got a problem with
[1:11:31] daddy spend time with daddy
[1:11:34] when daddy talk to
[1:11:38] daddy well god i wish our church had
[1:11:41] this
[1:11:43] pray about it maybe god will give it to
[1:11:45] us
[1:11:46] amen he does everything beautiful in his
[1:11:48] time
[1:11:51] sometimes we try to take carnal control
[1:11:53] of situations
[1:11:57] it's no different
[1:11:59] in a church
[1:12:02] than a family
[1:12:04] no different on a job we've all had
[1:12:07] job experiences that were very confusing
[1:12:12] more than one person telling you what to
[1:12:13] do
[1:12:16] not sure who you should be listening to
[1:12:18] what should be done first
[1:12:21] but a well-managed company has a good
[1:12:24] structure in place
[1:12:27] to keep all the confusion out they have
[1:12:30] good headship
[1:12:32] all that implies employees know who
[1:12:34] their boss is
[1:12:35] they know where they get their
[1:12:36] instructions from
[1:12:39] same as in a courtroom
[1:12:41] when court is in session
[1:12:43] no matter how much somebody wants to
[1:12:45] talk if they get out of order the judge
[1:12:47] will
[1:12:48] hit his hammer he'll say order in the
[1:12:51] court if you keep that up i'll throw you
[1:12:53] out for contempt
[1:12:55] amen
[1:12:56] because order is necessary
[1:12:59] contempt of court is essentially seen
[1:13:03] as a form of disturbance that may impede
[1:13:07] the functioning of the court right
[1:13:11] we don't want a form of disturbance in
[1:13:14] our church
[1:13:15] that may impede the functioning of god's
[1:13:18] court right amen that's right that's the
[1:13:20] truth
[1:13:21] now everyone that's ever been in the
[1:13:23] court and he got out of order and he
[1:13:25] wanted to talk did you know he thought
[1:13:27] he was right
[1:13:35] think about it
[1:13:37] just because we feel we're right
[1:13:41] god does everything decently and in
[1:13:43] order amen
[1:13:45] now it's no different with a spiritual
[1:13:47] church god is the head of the church
[1:13:49] and the sheep respect god's headship
[1:13:52] amen god's way of unity
[1:13:55] now in the carnal church while that's
[1:13:56] different
[1:13:58] in a carnal church there's fussing
[1:14:00] there's fighting
[1:14:02] there's arguing
[1:14:04] isms schisms backbiting
[1:14:07] talking behind people how many knows of
[1:14:09] this
[1:14:10] how many's heard of this
[1:14:12] there's divisions there's contentions
[1:14:15] in a carnal church
[1:14:18] paul said in first corinthians 1 12 he
[1:14:20] says that every one of you saith i'm a
[1:14:22] paul i'm apollos i am of cephas i am of
[1:14:26] christ yes i like this preacher yeah i
[1:14:29] like that preacher
[1:14:30] i like the way he says it i like the way
[1:14:32] he views it
[1:14:34] paul asked the question real easy is
[1:14:36] christ
[1:14:37] divided right no
[1:14:40] right
[1:14:40] is christ divided he's talking about
[1:14:42] unity right
[1:14:44] is he divided
[1:14:46] who cares what you're off
[1:14:49] i only care what your spirit is
[1:14:53] i'm listening to the spirit of things
[1:14:55] much more than i'm listening to words
[1:15:00] when we talk like that we're trying to
[1:15:02] bring our carnal order to god's church
[1:15:08] right just like being out being in court
[1:15:11] what about this you know he's lying what
[1:15:13] are you on
[1:15:14] sit down
[1:15:16] that's really good
[1:15:18] bringing a carnal order
[1:15:22] sure we got all opinions
[1:15:26] somewhere down the law road a spiritual
[1:15:28] church trust god amen
[1:15:32] amen
[1:15:35] when someone gets the wrong spirit on
[1:15:37] them
[1:15:38] it will always cause some sort of
[1:15:40] confusion
[1:15:42] i always remember brother johnson said
[1:15:44] you go one day
[1:15:46] without praying
[1:15:48] the wife knows about it
[1:15:50] she's the closest to you
[1:15:53] kids don't know yet till the second day
[1:15:57] second day you go without the lord the
[1:15:59] kids know
[1:16:01] that you haven't been praying amen
[1:16:05] dogs still don't know that that third
[1:16:06] day
[1:16:07] i'm telling you you'll get so mad and
[1:16:09] angry and rude you'll kick the dog
[1:16:19] we're not
[1:16:20] a carnal church
[1:16:27] eventually
[1:16:28] a wrong spirit will cause wrong things
[1:16:31] in the church
[1:16:32] may not happen right away but it will
[1:16:37] but we're not a carnal church
[1:16:39] with a carnal order
[1:16:41] we don't walk as men
[1:16:43] we are a spiritual church with spiritual
[1:16:46] order
[1:16:47] and it is our personal responsibility to
[1:16:49] learn how to walk in the spirit be
[1:16:51] subject to the word of god
[1:16:54] now look what happened to the children
[1:16:55] of israel when they were liberated from
[1:16:57] the egyptian world
[1:17:00] you would think they would have been so
[1:17:02] grateful
[1:17:04] they would have just done anything jesus
[1:17:06] asked
[1:17:09] jesus was even following them he was
[1:17:11] leading them and follow him and
[1:17:13] protecting them
[1:17:14] and and giving them serious diary shoes
[1:17:17] providing food just did everything but
[1:17:19] you know what
[1:17:21] they had the hardest time following
[1:17:22] god's leadership
[1:17:24] they didn't respect god's leadership
[1:17:27] through moses
[1:17:29] they murmured they complained and they
[1:17:32] wanted different leadership
[1:17:34] and if they didn't get it they were even
[1:17:36] thinking about
[1:17:41] leaving amen
[1:17:44] so even though we're all god's sheep and
[1:17:46] his pastor god has set in order for his
[1:17:50] sheep
[1:17:52] and the scriptures teach us that paul
[1:17:55] set
[1:17:56] the same order in all the churches yes
[1:17:58] amen
[1:18:00] think about it we got to have the same
[1:18:02] order that paul said
[1:18:04] not a new age order
[1:18:06] not a modern order
[1:18:10] god's order he's the same yesterday
[1:18:12] today and forever
[1:18:15] he brought order in respect to god's
[1:18:17] house
[1:18:20] brother brown didn't only say that every
[1:18:21] believer ought to have a home church
[1:18:24] he talked about the love and attitude
[1:18:26] they should have when they
[1:18:28] about their church
[1:18:31] he says their love their attitude it
[1:18:34] should be in such a way that they can't
[1:18:35] wait till the doors are open
[1:18:41] that's a loving attitude thing amen
[1:18:44] he taught us our true purpose when we
[1:18:48] get to church
[1:18:50] is to find out where we're standing
[1:18:53] with the great shepherd
[1:18:57] because all through the week
[1:19:00] i know that i'm right
[1:19:01] i know i'm doing the right thing god is
[1:19:04] with me oh yeah every decision i
[1:19:06] make right couldn't be wrong
[1:19:09] no need to work it out with fear and
[1:19:10] trembling
[1:19:12] so we humble ourselves in church and
[1:19:15] find out where we're really at with god
[1:19:19] amen amen
[1:19:22] a believer wants to know
[1:19:24] that he's in order with his shepherd
[1:19:28] the humble want to make sure but the
[1:19:30] proud they already know when to get the
[1:19:31] church
[1:19:32] and god resists that spirit
[1:19:35] that's why a lot of times we can come to
[1:19:36] church we feel we don't get anything out
[1:19:38] of it
[1:19:40] it ain't because of the preacher
[1:19:44] i know my god
[1:19:45] can feed us
[1:19:47] through anything
[1:19:53] because god is much greater than the
[1:19:55] preacher
[1:19:59] but god is going to bless you with the
[1:20:01] wrong spirit
[1:20:03] he's not going to reward you
[1:20:05] with something out of order up here
[1:20:09] and down here
[1:20:10] that's right i'm sorry he's not right
[1:20:12] it's true it's up to you to humble
[1:20:14] yourself
[1:20:16] be subject
[1:20:19] lord i need you
[1:20:21] i promise when i leave here i walk with
[1:20:23] you amen
[1:20:30] god is an order of things brother man
[1:20:32] said in the message trying to do god's
[1:20:34] service without being his will he said
[1:20:35] now you pastors should never tell a
[1:20:38] prophet what to do
[1:20:42] that's why any man that would say the
[1:20:44] prophet was wrong in this
[1:20:52] that's what i feel about that
[1:20:57] are you evangelists
[1:20:59] tell a pastor
[1:21:03] see each one has his office
[1:21:06] if it's perfectly identified
[1:21:13] god is not going to offer confusion
[1:21:15] that's what the prophet is telling us
[1:21:17] here
[1:21:21] an evangelist who has been here many
[1:21:24] times
[1:21:26] he's well respected and i respect him
[1:21:29] had told me of a situation that he had
[1:21:32] he was asked to come to a a certain
[1:21:34] church
[1:21:35] and preach for them
[1:21:39] and feeling
[1:21:41] led to go
[1:21:42] he said he would come and he got there
[1:21:45] early and the pastor wanted to
[1:21:48] uh
[1:21:49] have
[1:21:50] to see him before service they had
[1:21:51] little
[1:21:52] food and coffee or whatever it was and
[1:21:55] the pastor said to this evangelist now
[1:21:57] he said now
[1:21:58] i don't want you uh preaching about uh
[1:22:02] two souls and the return ministry in the
[1:22:05] tent and a number of what i call false
[1:22:08] doctrines
[1:22:15] think about that
[1:22:17] can you imagine the pickle he was in
[1:22:22] now i know some preachers would have
[1:22:23] said i'll preach whatever god tells me
[1:22:25] to preach
[1:22:28] all right
[1:22:29] or if i can't have liberty to preach
[1:22:31] what i want i'm not going to preach out
[1:22:32] of love
[1:22:35] i've seen it many times i've i've seen
[1:22:37] it in our men's meeting
[1:22:43] brother brandon said respect another
[1:22:44] man's pulpit
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:49] it's not about what you want to say what
[1:22:51] you want to testify
[1:22:53] what you want it's not about that
[1:22:57] god is not going to alter confusion
[1:23:02] some preachers don't exercise the spirit
[1:23:04] of respect
[1:23:07] and i'll tell you there's times that we
[1:23:08] need to learn to exercise among one
[1:23:11] another
[1:23:13] the spirit of respect so much more than
[1:23:16] the spirit of i'm right
[1:23:20] but this
[1:23:22] evangelist
[1:23:25] he did preach
[1:23:27] the gospel from that pulpit
[1:23:29] and never
[1:23:31] ever
[1:23:33] preached against the false doctrines
[1:23:35] right
[1:23:36] right he respected that man's pulpit yes
[1:23:39] he preached the word of god
[1:23:41] amen
[1:23:42] he became so respected that they asked
[1:23:45] him to come back and back and back and
[1:23:48] you know what he did a lot of good
[1:23:51] all through the respect of unity
[1:23:58] not a spirit i'm gonna prove that
[1:24:00] they're wrong and i'm gonna say it like
[1:24:01] this and if there's one scene in there
[1:24:03] they'll come out i don't care about the
[1:24:04] rest of them
[1:24:11] sometimes we get so caught up
[1:24:14] in thinking that we're the shepherd
[1:24:18] god is the shepherd
[1:24:19] that's right
[1:24:21] god is not going to offer more confusion
[1:24:24] by trying to unconfuse somebody that's
[1:24:27] true amen that's right well i'm going to
[1:24:29] straighten them out
[1:24:30] and bring more confusion
[1:24:34] let all things be done decently and in
[1:24:37] order always always always respect
[1:24:39] another man's pulpit and respect the
[1:24:41] church
[1:24:43] respect one another's testimony respect
[1:24:46] one another song respect one another in
[1:24:48] the men's meaning respect respect
[1:24:51] respect you can never go wrong
[1:24:53] respecting amen
[1:24:57] well i felt real strong in my spirit
[1:25:01] it just it's
[1:25:04] everybody wants to be that prophet that
[1:25:06] comes out of the wilderness
[1:25:08] eating
[1:25:10] locusts and wild honey and
[1:25:12] lay the axe to the tree
[1:25:26] if you're a prophet okay
[1:25:29] if you're a prophet okay
[1:25:32] but if you're not get an order
[1:25:34] stay in order keep in order
[1:25:37] not just today
[1:25:38] a month a year two years five years ten
[1:25:42] years from now
[1:25:44] when i'm dead and gone i hope that this
[1:25:46] church remains in order
[1:25:51] because that's what god wants
[1:25:56] think about when god first
[1:25:59] saved you i remember when he first saved
[1:26:02] me
[1:26:03] he talked about the most important thing
[1:26:05] with me
[1:26:06] and that was the sin
[1:26:08] of my nature
[1:26:12] i knew that if i was to die without him
[1:26:13] i'd go directly to hell right
[1:26:16] now when he saved me and he cleansed me
[1:26:19] of all my sin and my my my past was
[1:26:22] literally erased erased he can't even
[1:26:26] remember i remember because god tell
[1:26:28] satan tells me about it right but he
[1:26:30] can't remember it's erased from him
[1:26:34] at that moment if i died i would be
[1:26:36] saved
[1:26:38] as soon as i step into the next day
[1:26:42] i've got more
[1:26:44] sins
[1:26:47] more backslide that's the word
[1:26:50] and god he sees me i know the thoughts i
[1:26:53] think towards you saith the lord
[1:26:55] to give you an expected end i want to be
[1:26:57] in his image yes
[1:27:00] but he doesn't come to us the first day
[1:27:02] and just
[1:27:10] no
[1:27:12] he takes us one step at a time
[1:27:15] he knows what he's doing to get us in
[1:27:18] order he knows when we get saved we're
[1:27:20] not perfectly in order with our
[1:27:23] character
[1:27:26] he's still working on me
[1:27:29] [Music]
[1:27:31] to make me what i ought to be
[1:27:35] yes i'm safe but he's still working on
[1:27:37] me
[1:27:38] why we need to press towards the mark
[1:27:41] so when things aren't right in the
[1:27:42] church and you see somebody that's out
[1:27:45] of order something just isn't right you
[1:27:46] know hold your horses
[1:27:50] let it be done decently in order
[1:27:53] show
[1:27:54] the church you've got character
[1:27:58] don't
[1:28:06] no
[1:28:08] preaching
[1:28:09] without respecting another man's pulpit
[1:28:12] is not liberty
[1:28:13] in the holy ghost
[1:28:15] right
[1:28:16] that's what most people would consider
[1:28:17] it
[1:28:19] liberty without respect is the same
[1:28:21] thing as power without character
[1:28:23] it's satanic and i'll say it again
[1:28:25] liberty without respect to satanic
[1:28:29] i've never heard another man say it but
[1:28:31] i believe with all my heart
[1:28:33] amen god is not going to offer more
[1:28:36] confusion by us trying to unhave liberty
[1:28:39] to unconfuse somebody and bring more
[1:28:41] confusion
[1:28:44] now if i would go to say something that
[1:28:46] would be contrary to the scriptures from
[1:28:48] this pulpit
[1:28:49] like
[1:28:50] it's okay for a sister to stand behind
[1:28:52] the pulpit and preach the word of god
[1:28:55] let's say i would go to say that
[1:28:57] right
[1:28:58] it would bring confusion
[1:29:04] for us to handle it in just any way we
[1:29:06] want
[1:29:08] how should
[1:29:10] we correctly handle the situation
[1:29:14] should someone stand up in the church
[1:29:15] and just call it out and say that's
[1:29:16] wrong pastor
[1:29:20] should the long should the song leader
[1:29:22] stand up
[1:29:24] the next service
[1:29:26] and say brother john
[1:29:28] what's wrong for what he said
[1:29:33] should somebody just stand up after
[1:29:34] service raise their hand and just say
[1:29:37] you know i think you
[1:29:38] i just want to say a little testimony
[1:29:40] but god pressed it on my heart i feel
[1:29:41] real grave night i feel brother john was
[1:29:43] wrong
[1:29:46] come on this is an important question
[1:29:52] i don't believe that's the right way to
[1:29:54] handle something
[1:29:55] it would bring more confusion to the
[1:29:57] situation
[1:30:00] the correct way would be to go to the
[1:30:02] pastor
[1:30:04] show him in the scriptures
[1:30:06] and in the message where he is wrong
[1:30:09] alone
[1:30:11] now it would be good it would be good
[1:30:14] if he can't if he doesn't receive that
[1:30:17] then it'd be good to take another
[1:30:18] brother with you
[1:30:22] see what you're trying to do is correct
[1:30:24] the problem without offering more
[1:30:26] confusion i'm going to tell you why most
[1:30:28] people offer more confusion because
[1:30:30] they're more interested in getting
[1:30:31] pumped up to prove that somebody was
[1:30:33] wrong than they ever are about trying to
[1:30:35] help somebody
[1:30:38] the spirit is wrong right you you know
[1:30:41] you can have
[1:30:42] mixed
[1:30:44] motives in everything that you do yeah
[1:30:46] that's i'm gonna work for god but i'm
[1:30:48] gonna work for me
[1:30:50] i'm gonna preach for god but i'm gonna
[1:30:51] preach for me
[1:30:55] i'm gonna help somebody and help my
[1:30:56] reputation at the same time
[1:31:03] when you go to the pastor alone
[1:31:07] and you talk to him
[1:31:08] directly
[1:31:10] see true love covers
[1:31:15] can you imagine if
[1:31:18] if whoever beside me just some preacher
[1:31:21] some
[1:31:22] preacher up here a different pastor
[1:31:24] would stand up here and he would just
[1:31:26] talk about all well just me let's
[1:31:28] sorry
[1:31:30] if i'm going to tell everybody about
[1:31:32] your faults
[1:31:36] how is that going to make you feel
[1:31:39] that's just not the way god does things
[1:31:45] god handles things in an order
[1:31:48] and he that covereth a multitude of sin
[1:31:51] let him know that he'll he'll save amen
[1:31:55] that love that covers it it saves
[1:31:59] humility
[1:32:03] we're supposed to be building respect
[1:32:05] with one another
[1:32:07] and we don't care about somebody's
[1:32:10] faults being talked about
[1:32:13] right
[1:32:14] come on what's wrong with that spirit
[1:32:17] see you don't got to be a preacher to do
[1:32:18] things wrong
[1:32:21] [Laughter]
[1:32:23] but the preacher
[1:32:25] the the pastor he sees the spirits
[1:32:30] he's got to deal with them
[1:32:34] now when i do something wrong
[1:32:36] i want you to come to me
[1:32:40] come to me
[1:32:42] tell me
[1:32:43] what is wrong
[1:32:46] if i say i don't want to hear you i
[1:32:48] don't want to talk to you
[1:32:50] then go tell somebody
[1:32:54] okay with that
[1:32:57] but a pastor should get back up and say
[1:32:59] i was wrong it is wrong for women to
[1:33:02] preach behind the pulpit
[1:33:05] their place is in their home
[1:33:08] the scripture says it here brother
[1:33:10] branham said it here i was wrong and
[1:33:12] that would be nothing wrong for a pastor
[1:33:14] to do that right
[1:33:16] because pastors are not perfect
[1:33:23] they shouldn't portray to be perfect
[1:33:25] either
[1:33:28] but it eliminates any confusion see it's
[1:33:30] done decently in order right now he's
[1:33:32] the one that tells the church
[1:33:44] preaching and pastoring
[1:33:46] is different
[1:33:50] it's often been said by visiting
[1:33:53] evangelists that come here
[1:33:56] an evangelist can come in and preach
[1:33:57] whatever he wants and he leaves it for
[1:33:59] the pastor to take care of
[1:34:00] how he's heard that from a number of
[1:34:02] evangelists
[1:34:05] because they they have the mindset that
[1:34:08] they don't have to worry
[1:34:12] their job is to stir the people
[1:34:16] get them on fire for god
[1:34:21] there's certain evangelists that you you
[1:34:23] you feel
[1:34:25] certain ministers look every pastor
[1:34:27] has
[1:34:31] comfortable feelings about other
[1:34:33] ministers
[1:34:34] they're in a pastor i know of
[1:34:37] or an evangelist i know of
[1:34:39] or a teacher i know of that hasn't said
[1:34:42] those things
[1:34:44] think about that here you got all of
[1:34:46] god's fivefold ministry
[1:34:49] and every one of them feels
[1:34:50] uncomfortable about another
[1:35:00] it's got to be that way
[1:35:03] it's got to be that way there are there
[1:35:05] are some
[1:35:07] that aren't mature yet
[1:35:10] some that don't care yet
[1:35:12] right right about the unity that's true
[1:35:15] brother branham said there's a lot of
[1:35:16] make-believe
[1:35:18] ones
[1:35:20] the bible says that the uh there's
[1:35:22] minister
[1:35:23] and the enemy as ministers of of
[1:35:27] that light
[1:35:27] as ministers of light but their motive
[1:35:30] is not to get us to perfection
[1:35:33] so you understand it's okay
[1:35:37] a shepherd
[1:35:39] has
[1:35:40] to be on guard
[1:35:42] because he's protecting the sheep
[1:35:46] it's normal it's not abnormal
[1:35:51] a pastor has to feel comfortable
[1:35:54] with who's behind here
[1:35:58] you want to be sitting there and on pins
[1:35:59] and needles what's going to be said
[1:36:04] because of other agendas being mixed in
[1:36:08] with
[1:36:10] what should be being done
[1:36:13] because a lot of times you know we're
[1:36:15] looking at only one part of our motive
[1:36:17] right
[1:36:19] and that's right to speak the truth
[1:36:21] right
[1:36:22] you husbands you want to speak the truth
[1:36:24] to your wives your wives do you want to
[1:36:25] speak the truth to your husband
[1:36:28] sometimes we forget the other motive i'm
[1:36:29] going to prove i was right just like
[1:36:31] last time
[1:36:33] yeah right
[1:36:34] right
[1:36:35] it's not about that's true
[1:36:38] the motive has to be love
[1:36:40] that's it i love
[1:36:42] i love we're family
[1:36:44] i already one single person in here i
[1:36:47] don't want to make it
[1:36:49] amen
[1:36:50] i love every single one and i want us
[1:36:53] all to grow up
[1:36:55] in christ
[1:37:01] now a pastor needs a lot of patience
[1:37:05] and helping the church to grow
[1:37:07] and i understand
[1:37:08] the difficulty of functioning
[1:37:11] in a church where everything is not just
[1:37:13] perfect
[1:37:18] i've had seven children
[1:37:20] nine of us
[1:37:22] oh my heart
[1:37:24] jonathan can testify
[1:37:27] i'd go i'd go to five different places
[1:37:29] to buy five different types of
[1:37:31] food
[1:37:32] to try to make everybody happy
[1:37:38] and you that have had two children
[1:37:41] you know how difficult it is
[1:37:44] to keep unity
[1:37:47] difficult we're a family but you all
[1:37:49] can't have your own way
[1:37:52] so patience is needed
[1:37:55] i have two companies and 15 employees
[1:37:58] i deal with their family issues we got
[1:38:00] vendors and customers
[1:38:03] i understand the difficulty
[1:38:06] how hard it is
[1:38:09] to function in order
[1:38:11] when you got
[1:38:13] people with their own ideas i understand
[1:38:16] how hard it is sometimes to come into
[1:38:18] work and create an atmosphere a right
[1:38:21] atmosphere in my shop
[1:38:24] when everybody has had a bad weekend
[1:38:31] now if that was my shop
[1:38:33] i could care less what happens in there
[1:38:36] but it's not mine
[1:38:38] i've only been a steward over it so now
[1:38:40] i'm responsible for that atmosphere
[1:38:44] not by constraint but willingly
[1:38:49] now i got to create an atmosphere there
[1:38:52] one that respects god
[1:38:54] don't have to go to church don't have to
[1:38:56] be a believer that you better respect
[1:38:58] right
[1:39:00] no pinups no wrong talking no arguings
[1:39:02] no talking behind people's back we don't
[1:39:04] do that here and when it pops up
[1:39:08] i don't say uh you know whatever that's
[1:39:09] just you know work
[1:39:14] i don't want to be
[1:39:16] face the lord with
[1:39:19] making me a steward or something and not
[1:39:21] really caring
[1:39:26] so i understand the difficulty
[1:39:29] of keeping a unity in a church when
[1:39:32] there's different spirits floating
[1:39:33] around
[1:39:34] amen
[1:39:36] if we all
[1:39:37] could be under christ
[1:39:40] checking our spirit being subject one to
[1:39:42] another respecting god's way of unity
[1:39:46] we would have much less problems and
[1:39:48] here's the reward god said i'll bless
[1:39:50] you with
[1:39:51] things that you've never seen before
[1:39:54] amen it don't happen by accident and it
[1:39:56] don't happen by having our most favorite
[1:39:58] preacher here
[1:40:03] it happens when we get mature and
[1:40:05] serious enough to say you know what i
[1:40:06] need to i need to be looking inwardly
[1:40:08] instead of outwardly
[1:40:10] i have learned a lot
[1:40:12] at work
[1:40:13] if you really want things better you
[1:40:15] make them better
[1:40:17] you be the leader you be the inspiration
[1:40:21] not telling people what to do
[1:40:23] tell you if if you did not know me and
[1:40:25] you walked into
[1:40:27] our shop
[1:40:29] you would never ever ever know
[1:40:31] i was the boss
[1:40:33] you would never know as the owner
[1:40:35] never
[1:40:38] i do not make my people ever feel like
[1:40:41] i'm the boss ever ever
[1:40:44] in fact i serve them
[1:40:46] i get underneath them and i be an
[1:40:48] example how they need to be to one
[1:40:50] another
[1:40:53] ain't no different in church
[1:40:56] amen
[1:41:02] church members have their own ideas
[1:41:06] new members we know don't have a lot of
[1:41:08] understanding
[1:41:10] religious members
[1:41:12] they have a lot of you know it all
[1:41:15] understanding
[1:41:17] attitudes basically
[1:41:19] to understand the difficult the
[1:41:21] difficulty of keeping order in the
[1:41:24] church
[1:41:24] it may not be the way that you would do
[1:41:27] it
[1:41:28] we may not understand pray
[1:41:34] pray
[1:41:35] because there's certain things that i
[1:41:36] believe have to be
[1:41:39] trusted
[1:41:43] the scripture teaches us when you're
[1:41:45] going to have a
[1:41:46] some deacon in the church you don't want
[1:41:48] a novice right
[1:41:50] well he's a believer he repented he gave
[1:41:52] his heart to god he justified he loves
[1:41:54] god it doesn't mean anything
[1:41:56] this is good this is really good it has
[1:41:58] to be
[1:42:06] not proven to
[1:42:08] just
[1:42:09] your favorite
[1:42:11] five people
[1:42:20] so
[1:42:20] what we want above everything
[1:42:23] is god in charge
[1:42:26] now i'm going to stop there because it's
[1:42:28] late
[1:42:29] and
[1:42:32] i'm about
[1:42:33] about
[1:42:34] eight pages short
[1:42:38] and i had the brothers
[1:42:39] told the brothers i said brothers pray
[1:42:41] for me he says i
[1:42:43] i
[1:42:45] i don't know if i should just go and
[1:42:46] extend a time or
[1:42:48] or cut it
[1:42:50] i
[1:42:51] i don't usually say those things you
[1:42:53] know i don't
[1:42:55] i usually don't tell my wife that but
[1:42:57] when i told her that she said
[1:42:59] what
[1:43:02] she got in other services you know but
[1:43:04] the thing is
[1:43:05] it's an important subject homie's going
[1:43:07] to be here next service
[1:43:12] okay
[1:43:13] those that will not be here
[1:43:15] just
[1:43:16] you can just
[1:43:18] watch it
[1:43:20] but this is for the for the furtherment
[1:43:23] of our church amen it's good to know who
[1:43:26] you're laboring with
[1:43:28] now understand it's not about how many
[1:43:30] sins i've committed
[1:43:33] whether it's on the scale of you being
[1:43:35] good enough or not good enough
[1:43:37] because if it was true none of us should
[1:43:39] be in church
[1:43:41] okay so it's on the basis of what we
[1:43:43] want to do
[1:43:45] we want to build our character into the
[1:43:48] image of christ
[1:43:50] and so whatever is lacking let's just
[1:43:52] pray one for another that god would put
[1:43:55] us in his order
[1:43:58] that we may grow up together in love i
[1:44:01] believe somebody's homies
[1:44:04] has been
[1:44:06] um
[1:44:08] this service right here has really
[1:44:10] helped your understanding let me just
[1:44:12] see your hands
[1:44:13] god bless you
[1:44:14] okay
[1:44:16] all i want to do is eliminate confusion
[1:44:20] bring order
[1:44:22] so so god can have his way amen let's
[1:44:24] stand together
[1:44:27] thank you for your patience
[1:44:28] and and brothers thank you for praying
[1:44:30] for me i just feel
[1:44:32] very
