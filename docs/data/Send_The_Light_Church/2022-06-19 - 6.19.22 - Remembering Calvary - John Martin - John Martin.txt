until jesus christ be fully manifested in us amen i say god bless you happy father's day somewhere all of us are connected to a father and if our fathers are not living we certainly have respect for fathers and we can be a father to everyone i remember being raised by a single parent that was my father he had to be my mother and my father sometimes we have to fill the gap and today for thinking about our heavenly father for our father's day message we want to uh have a subject of remembering calvary because he he is everything to us he's our father our mother our sister our brother and uh we want to honor him today this is our communion service we haven't had one in such uh a long time uh i would say we could always put put that on me but it should be more often than what we've been having that i will say um and the house should be full i want to say that as well um but that's those of us that are here um i believe god is very pleased with that amen let's look to him in prayer and then we'll begin with our opening scripture in john father as we approach you at this time we're certainly grateful for what you've done for us at calvary lord for if that had not transpired or we wouldn't be here with the same desire that we have today there'd be some false pretense of just trying to make it in our works but we know that lord we're here because you've changed our lives you've cleansed us from our sins you've took away our old nature you have put within us your holy spirit your nature and you're drawing us to a place that we can be in your image and in your likeness and we thank you for the great work of the holy spirit that's going on in each one of us today we thank you that we could come and honor you today to to glorify you to to remember you today father we ask that you would prepare our hearts lord if they're not prepared for your word that we might grow in your word that we the lord would be able to leave here are better people and closer drawn not only to you but to one another bless this communion service that we be closer one to another we commit all things into your hands now give you praise and honor in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen for opening scripture is it would be in saint john chapter 19. and we're going to start with verse number 14 through 23. this great day of calvary and it was the preparation the passover in about the sixth hour and the sick he and he saith unto the jews behold your king but they cried out away with him away with him crucify him but pilate saith unto them shall i crucify your king and the chief priest answered we have no king but caesar oh my my the decision that they made there then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified and they took jesus and led them away and he burying his cross went forth into a place called the place of the skull which is called in the hebrew golgotha where they crucified him and two others with him on either side one and jesus in the midst and pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross and the right the writing was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews this title then read many of the jews for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in hebrew in the greek and also latin then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate right not the king of the jews but that he said i am the king of the jews oh my just a constant belittling of the king of glory pilate answered what have i what i've written i have written then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also his coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout they said therefore among themselves let us not rend it but cast lots for it uh whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled would say if they parted my garment among them and for my vesture they did cast lots these things therefore the soldiers did now there stood by the cross of jesus's mother and his mother sister mary and the wife of cleopas and mary magdalene and when jesus therefore saw the mother and his disciples standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son and then he said to his disciple behold thy mother and from that hour the disciple took and took her onto his own amen god bless you may be seated so he can see here jesus is teaching that we need to continue on helping one another whatever whatever we can do i am am i allowed to just take one little break i keep forgetting but our little brother james chanult has a baptismal certificate and i want all of us to just give our little brother a hand clapping he was baptized in january 10th of 2021 and so we want him to come and get this and finally we know that this doesn't mean everything but i love the idea that it's you know could be hanging up or somewhere you could look that can always remind you amen god bless you what it's the greatest decision we can make is a decision for jesus christ amen well we got this little sign behind us here and it says golgotha is 5993 miles from fenton and brother roger rodriguez got this for us the first time he came to visit us but it was at that distance that jesus died for us at that location something transpired there for you and i and we are blessed today because of the love that he had for us and as we go through the service today we just we want to reflect on the lord we want to reflect on what he did for us isaiah chapter 53 says he is despised and rejected of man a man of sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid it as it were faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he had borne our grease think about that 5993 miles away and he and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him straight string smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his tribes we are healed jesus did this for us they might have mocked him they they might have thought they were in control of crucifying him but jesus made it real clear that no man takes my life but i give it if he wouldn't have gave it freely we would not be saved today so it was through the giving the suffering the pain that he went through it was for you and i the scripture says in verse 6 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord had laid upon him the iniquity of us all so before we really came to christ we were just doing our own thing going our own way didn't even care about the lord and i'll tell you it is such an evil spirit to have upon us that after we come to the lord we still want to do our own thing still want to go our own way we need a greater experience with god something that holds us to him because that's the way it was meant to be he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened down his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and his sheep before this shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth now imagine if you're suffering and you open your mouth there's a good chance you're going to express something negative a murmur like shouldn't be not fair but jesus didn't want any of that he kept his mouth closed he didn't yield to the feeling of what was fear but he committed himself to the father amen he was taken from prison and from judgment who shall declare his generation for he was cut off at the land of the living for the transgressions of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich his death because he had done no violence neither was deceit was there any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he put him to grief when thou shall make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed and he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hands jesus died for us in our condition in the worst possible condition we didn't know god we didn't care about god we didn't want nothing to do with god in fact i remember the time that i was being i would be introduced to the lord i didn't want nothing to do with god i didn't want to give up my will i was very happy in the driver's seat doing what i wanted to do but the more that i learned that without him i will utterly be lost the more that i paid attention to what had to be said he became sin that we could be set free he became everything that we were collectively the sin of the whole world was upon him he didn't leave some out he didn't leave some of your sin out he didn't leave some of the people out he died for the sin of the whole world that's why if you have a heart to to repent a heart that believes in god's grace there is no sin that god will not forgive today now we're not going to talk about blaspheming the holy ghost that jesus said that that won't be forgiven but too often the devil tricks us gets us to a place where we think what does it matter because i did this thing in the past and we need to take a stand and and confess that god's blood is stronger than our sins is stronger than our unbelief and that if he could forgive us um for the sin that we've done in the past and the the evil nature that we were born with how much more is god going to see us through we got to stay under the blood and keep under the blood and and that's why we got to remember calvary he became us that we could become him and we're in that process of doing that we don't believe it happens by burning candles or or by giving money to the church or doing good works it happens in a process of when god speaks to you you obey his commandments and some supernatural things transpire in life we become more in his image mourn his likeness it's the hard way it's there's no easy magical thing about this it's a relationship god himself paid the debt of our sinful nature the one that we were born with all because of the unbelief that eve had in the garden romans 5 verse 19 says for as by one man's disobedient many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous now when eve did it it was just a repercussion that sin had entered into the world and everybody that was born was born in sin now when jesus became the supreme sacrifice for the world that doesn't happen automatically right it doesn't there has to be a turnaround a a repentance an acknowledging of sin uh uh i want to to to to oh to do the will of god i want to be born again there has to be that transpiring in order for for us to become the righteousness of god to take on the righteousness of god and there's there's too much thinking that well eve did what she did called we did god did what you know he did not work now we're just automatically going to heaven and it's not the truth calvary was the fulfillment of the law james chapter 2 verse 8 says if he fulfilled the royal law according to the scripture thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself you do well this is exactly what jesus did for us at calvary he fulfilled the law now we heard the law said the day you eat there is the day you'll die but there was a part of god that had never been yet manifested and it was the giving of self for somebody else and this is what calvary is all about and this is what communion service is all about verse 9 but if you have respect to persons you commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors now notice this jesus died for the whole world no respect to persons but if we respect one person more than another person we're i'm being called a transgressor this is what puts me in a spot not worthy for communion this one thing it's not well i didn't pay my tithes it's not i haven't been faithful reading my bible or faithful listening to the tapes or i how has your spirit and your attitude been because the scripture says if i have respect to persons i'm not fulfilling the law the royal law there's other laws but you're not fulfilling the royal law i'm really not loving a person like myself i can never ever have an excuse of not to respect somebody in my humble opinion this moment in time called calvary is where the most incredible act was ever manifested the most incredible act was ever manifested when we look at god's creation and his creative power that he made the mountains and all the animals and we really stand in awe of god's creation but when we look at the power of god's love to forgive to redeem and to bring man back then we see the greatest manifestation of god we think it may not be that big a deal but it's a big deal try loving somebody that you don't feel is worthy yes god created the whole world and and the beauty and we the whole world is in awe of god's creation but if it had not been for calvary man would never know the greatest love this act of calvary was so dynamic it is what changed our life because of that now god can come and live inside of us and we can love others brother branham went so far as saying what lies within you is a creative power that you could create a world and go live on it if it was just us standing and looking at the the animals and the nature and the things that god created that still wouldn't be in us so i want you to stand in awe today of calvary i want you to remember what jesus did for you in the message love brother brandon said and the reason i chose this tonight is because my theme has always been love i think love is the most powerful force that the world has because god is love and there's no more powerful force than god for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son now it wasn't just the birth because imagine him being born but never dying he it was that death that brought us victory because that death paid the penalty of our sin not just our past sin but our present sin today not just our present sin but the sins that we will commit calvary needs to be just as exciting and real to us as it ever was and we need to wake up tomorrow thanking god for calvary that's right amen everything centers around calvary amen right in the middle of the chaos that satan caused in the garden god's great love prophesied a way back in genesis 3 15. right in the middle of the chaos god or putting things back in order and trying to straighten things out he said i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel god from the foundation in the world was preparing a way for you and i and nothing was going to stand in the way of it genesis 22 verse 8 here's abraham speaking of calvary and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they both of them so they went both of them together god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering jesus said in matthew 20 verse 18 behold we go to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed and chief priests and the scribes and they shall condemn him to death everything was centering around calvary and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock to scourge and to crucify him and the third day shall rise again even after his resurrection jesus talking to his two disciples in luke 24 25 we have a lot of scriptures today i hope that's okay with you then jesus said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory everything evolves around calvary and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them and all the scriptures the things concerning himself himself acts chapter 2 verse 22 ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man approved to god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of you as you yourselves also know him being delivered by the determined determinate counsel and the foreknowledge of god you have taken and by wicked hands you have crucified and slain whom god are raised up having lose the pains of death because it is impossible that he should be holding of it you can't kill god you can't kill god's love you can shun it you can run from it you can try to make it one-sided but god's love will always prevail god's love will be throughout eternity there's never going to be a day in heaven where you won't see the love of god judgment day you will see the love of god his bride will be sitting with them on the judgment seat that's that means there's somebody that loved god when they had a chance and those that are not there did not move forward in loving god when they had a chance the love of god will always be manifested you wake up in the morning that's the love of god you want to do something for somebody that's a love of god calvary was a mystery to the world even even to lucifer first corinthians 2 8 says which none of the princes of this world knew for had they had known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory they thought they were going to do away with the son of god but what they did is open the door for you and me to come in god knows what he's doing we may think things can get out of control we may think things are not right but this world is completely going insane but god is still in control first peter chapter 1 verse 18 for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and a gold from your vain conversation received by the tradition of your fathers wow how many times have we thought well i go to this church i take the communion i go in the confessional box i did my catechism i acknowledge this this uh priest this minister as the one to speak to me the word of god traditions because that's the way i was raised and when i left that to go searching for another i wouldn't be satisfied until i found him now we were not redeemed by naturally going through the motions of things but with the precious blood of christ as a lamb without blemish and without spot and i'll just say this we could pour the literal blood of jesus christ upon us we could drink the literal blood of jesus christ and it would not change our nature but the spirit that was in that blood if it comes upon the conscious in the heart of man something changes within them this is why we need to believe in the blood when we come to church and we sing those songs i had like three songs written down that we were going to sing at the church and i i guess i should ask brother ron what songs he's singing because he's saying all of them who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in god that raised him from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in god seeing you have seen ye have purified your souls how do i do that how do i get clean in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfain love of who the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently now that's a lot of words to put in one verse that talks about purifying your soul purifying your soul has a lot to do with you loving your brother everything points to calvary brother john johnson brought to us exodus chapter 12. god spoke to moses to take a land to kill it take of the blood and strike it on the two disciples then the upper door post of the house where they shall eat it so here back in exodus was pointing to calvary isn't that beautiful i just love what was brought out exodus chapter 12 read about four verses with me start with verse 11 and thou shall eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand and you shall eat it with haste it is the lord's passover this this this coming to church is is not something to be some lazy boy sit back and it doesn't matter as long as you make it this should be a place of reverence and respect and i'll tell you if you're doing it in your homes you have no problem doing it in church for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord so god is going to judge the entire world every man-made religion every man-made will everybody's saying i'm going to do what i want to do i'm going to come to church when i want i'm not going to come when i don't want and nothing matters god is going to judge that brother he is our brother he's our king jesus said the queen of sheba will raise up in this generation and condemn the generation because of what she did do we believe enough to come to church faithfully do we or do we just believe in the gifts of god this place ought to be packed and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when i see the blood i'll pass over you and the plague shall not be unto you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt i want you to think about this brother branham said our tolkien was the spirit of god's blood that was shed at calvary and that when it comes into us then the spiritual death angel passes over us when god lives in you it's no longer you now it's christ in you and the death angel can destroy anything but what is it of god it's that simple that's why we need to be pulsating living out breathing walking the holy ghost in our life it ain't just something we talk about at church or once in a while at home we need to to be living out the holy ghost and this shall and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and you shall keep it as a feast to the lord throughout your generations and you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever we're talking about communion here we're talking about remembering calvary that's what communion is all about it's remembering what jesus did for us it's remembering his suffering it's remembering he was broken for us that he he took our place as brother as you saying he paid a debt he did not owe i owed a debt i couldn't pay what was that that was love manifested that's what that was jesus tried to point his disciples to cow to calvary in john chapter 6 verse 53 then said thence then jesus said unto them verily verily i say to you except you eat my eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you now we're talking about the same thing here the same thing that we just read in exodus everything from exodus to calvary it pointed to jesus christ giving his life and here jesus is talking to his disciples to the 70 disciples if i could say it like that he said except you you accept me as the the offering for you you'll die in your sins and how you accept this offering is my spirit into you it ain't just something that's done far away it's something that's right here here inside of me that's why when you're sharing jesus christ with somebody today it's afresh it's just as real as the day that he was crucified because it needs to be that way to that person and it needs to be the same way to us when we're sharing it now we're told that they couldn't stomach eating all the word and drinking the holy spirit like a lot of people they can't take the whole word they can't take the holy the whole the holy spirit they they don't mind spirits they just don't want the holy one in john chapter 6 verse 66 and from that time many of them many of his disciples went back and they walked no more with him think about that how many people have come for a while and they decide to walk away now the thing is i don't think any of those disciples i don't think anybody that walks away ever thinks they're leaving god they don't ever think that or they never would the devil has got them to think that they could still serve god their own way but the bottom line is when you walk away from the obedience of this word you're walking away from jesus christ the same thing the children of israel did they they walked with jesus for 40 years jesus was amongst them their shoes and were out they they had healings among them but they didn't continue to walk with the word and and and we know how god felt about them now look at verse 67 then said jesus unto the twelve will you also go away you're you're my disciples too are you going to go away like them then simon peter answered lord to whom shall we go thou has the words of eternal life nope peter may have not been able to say i have a complete revelation on eating your flesh and drinking your blood but he knew what he said was the truth and it's okay maybe not to understand everything but it is not okay not to say amen you've got to say amen to the word you've got to believe the word you've got to take in the word you don't have to wait to understand it to say amen you wait till you believe it that's that's why brother man says the holy ghost says amen to every word because it wrote the word now peter didn't want jesus to go through this thing called calvary was his own disciple even jesus's own flesh didn't want to go through with it his flesh didn't want to go through with it so can i understand that sometimes we don't want to suffer for the lord sure i can but we must yield ourselves to god times we don't got to go we don't feel like going to church we still need to go to church we don't feel like praising god we don't feel like giving our lives more for god we still have to do it because he's worthy he went to calvary for us how could we not live for him how we ought to be the center of our lives what paul said in first corinthians chapter two verse two he says for i am determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified that's it jesus christ and him crucified it is the center of paul's life it wasn't just a sunday wednesday thing or just some holidays or or just uh when we're talking about it on on good friday or east or something like that galatians chapter 2 verse 20 he says i am crucified with christ i am not i was i am i'm staying crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but now it's christ with he lives in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me there it is he loved me and he gave himself for me this is about what remembering calvary's about he loved you enough to die for you amen that's right calvary was the fulfillment of the law we knew one part the day you eat thereof is the day you'll die and it is the truth but there is a fulfillment to the law and that's the giving of yourself for another oh we need a revelation of that because god has put that same power within you it's his spirit living in you laying on your life for another person that's why one soul is worth ten thousand worlds just you laboring to bring one soul in is worth 10 000 of these planets with everything that we hold so dear to us god's divine love god never wants us to forget calvary nor to forget what it should produce in our lives i believe that the scars that jesus bore that were made at calvary are there today and will be an eternal witness for you and i to see now that's just what i believe i believe that's how much it means to him that we remember calvary when we look at them we'll be reminded of the god's greatest love that he died for us how often have we forgot something somebody did for us we forgot their their forgiveness we forgot their mercy we forgot their love we forgot the many things they did for us god don't want you to forget what he did for you amen remember when jesus approached thomas after he was risen thomas come here put your your finger in my hand put your hand in my side it was it was in a different body yet his finger was there his wound was still open do you believe that remember john crying when no one was worthy to open the book and so a voice said that weep not behold the lion of the tribe of juba the root of david he has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and he said in revelations 5 6 and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne the four beasts in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain now you think about this if i you went out to the house and you saw we used to have sheep but now we got goats and when you look at the goats brother mark has looked at our goats more than anybody here outside of ann and cheryl because he has been so kind to help us with cleaning the stalls and taking care of them but if he had ever looked at one of those goats as it had been slain he would see the evidence of a slain goal it would there be blood there it would be limping dragging a leg something would be there indicating that it had been slain zechariah chapter 13 verse 6 and one shall say unto him what are these wounds in thy hands then he shall answer those with which i was wounded in the house of my friends i believe that god does never want us to forget what he done for us an eternal reminder reminds me of this story that someone gave and it might have been brother alex of course we've heard it many uh times about the the one uh girl who was so embarrassed with her mother because she just had this she looked gross on her face and it just was not a natural looking mother wasn't pretty at all to look at she was always embarrassed of the look and didn't want anybody to know that was her mother but then it was at the end that she realized that her mother went into the house when she was a baby and got burnt her old face was burnt but she saved her little girl's life i think god wants us to remember what he did for us that he went into the pits of hell and he paid the price he took away the keys of hell death in the grave for you and i yeah he's got scars but they're there to remind us of his love the love that he gave for us the love today that he has for us he never wants us to forget calvary that he suffered that he bled that he died paul was not in the upper room when jesus had the last supper with his twelve disciples but he still had a revelation of it do you believe that galatians one verse 12 says for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ this is such a a a fearful scripture to me because we come to church and the lazy way is to be taught by man sit there and listen to whatever the preacher's saying and try to be taught but it will do you no good to be taught by man you've got to be you've got it's got to be revealed to you by the holy ghost and that has everything to do with your heart preparation and your hunger to hear from god and looking beyond the veil whoever's talking amen first corinthians chapter 11 verse 23 5 received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night which he was betrayed he took bread and when he was and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do what in remembrance in remembrance he wants us to remember the suffering how often we've come into church just so la da da de daddy doesn't matter doesn't matter if you're doesn't matter if you're a reverend nothing matters doesn't matter how you talk to anybody it was a serious moment for him in fact it was before the foundation the world he was thinking about it in fact it's part of his eternal purpose to get all his family together and calvary that suffering is what is the center of everything and he's bringing the words that jesus spoke when he's in the upper room take eat this body which is broken for you do this do in remembrance of me in the same manner also he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till i come god wants us to show the death he does and the best way that we can show it is actually when we're laying down our life for somebody that's 24 7. amen that's where you show the lord's death talk about it talk about what jesus did for you at home when you're in the car when you're at the dinner table when you're driving you know we can talk about a lot of things but i think he wants us to remember what he did for us you do show the lord's death till he comes in other words keep doing it god wants us to remember calvary his sufferings and his pains all that he went through just to save us hebrews chapter 2 verse 2 i just want to read this real quick before we go back looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him he endured all that he had you and i in mind he was willing to die for you and i he despised the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god wanting us to remember calvary despised it he didn't care what he had to go through the price that he had to pay sometimes if we you know this is the way sometimes that we act about reaching out to somebody we tell them something if they don't listen we quit but that ain't what jesus did for you that is not the attitude that jesus had for us he went all the way he gave all the way that's why his word says that we need to present our bodies a living sacrifice and to prove what is that acceptable and perfect will of god for our lives that good acceptable perfect will of god for our lives wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord how many have been thinking about this scripture and we should we should because if we eat the bread and drink the cup unworthily we're guilty of what calvary was all about if you reject calvary there's no more sacrifice for sin but he's honing in on what we need to do and it if it's okay i'd like to just spend a little bit of time with this but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup so examine examine take a look at yourself i'm not saying you're bad i'm not saying you're good what i'm saying is take a look take a look examine um we know what the word examine means sometimes we pull something out of the oven and it's so burnt we have to examine whether it's edible did the burn the beans burn at the bottom of the pan sometimes we pull things apart in our cars and and we got to examine examine it sometimes we pull furnace filter out of the furnace and see if it's dirty examine it and we need to examine ourselves always for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself to himself not to somebody else but to yourself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sick among you and sleep we're going to get back to that for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brother when you come together to eat tarry one for another so when we take a look at this communion we have to analyze worthy or unworthy and in one way we're all unworthy we're all unworthy and in one way we're all worthy because his blood makes us worthy but in another way the way i want us to focus on is god is looking at the attitude that we are presently living with that's what these scriptures are it's not about whether his blood can cover us because that's not what he's speaking of and he's not speaking about like in romans that we've all sinned come short of the glory he's speaking of the attitude that we live with on a daily basis here it's not if if we been reading the bible listening to tapes paying our tithes it's really been about how we've been treating one another that's what it's been about it's it's how have we been treating one another have you been treating others just like christ treats you have you been loving others the way that christ has loved you we just went through that series the bible says not discerning the lord's body that's where it's happening it's not discerning the lord's body what does that really mean brother john discerning is something that happens inside of us it means we separate or withdraw from someone or oppose or discriminate to contend to differ to doubt to judge or to be partial now that's what it means not deserting the lord's body god doesn't want us having an attitude that wavers or staggers in how we truly feel towards someone there is no excuse for having a respect to persons towards somebody so this is what it really means to see if we're worthy or not worthy it's not that i live a little bit better life than sister lori or sister lori lives a little bit better life than brother mark that is not what it means it means how am i treating everyone not most people not 90 of the people in the church not everybody but the pastor not everyone but the song leader not everyone but everyone because a little leaven a little not treating some a little talking behind somebody's back that is where you're not discerning the lord's body and that's what makes us unworthy because calvary took that away count we took all of our sin away who are we to start judging somebody the devil's always trying to help you to discern the lord's body the problem is we listen to the devil we should stop listening to him he's he tells us to judge discriminate somebody to oppose somebody then we find ourselves being partial withdrawn or starting to separate from a certain ones in the church i'll tell you god sees all through that because the discerning happens inside of us we can put on a pretty face on the outside but i'll tell you god's looking at the heart so i want to ask you today are you worthy god is looking at how we're treating one another as being worthy or unworthy when we listen to the devil we're always judging someone just in our thoughts and when we listen to the lord we're always judging ourselves but if the lord ever shows us anything this is just the nature of the lord he wants you to lay down your life and go help that person because that is the business of the lord it's to help that's what the whole life of jesus was about laying down your life and we need to be exercising that not just i don't mean it wrong it's not about just being friends with one another and finding something to fellowship about that's wonderful but i'll tell you if you can't find some something in my life to lay down your life for you better be looking harder because we have an opportunity to do what if jesus was here sitting next to you his goal would be to try to help you it wouldn't be pat you on the back and saying you don't have to do anything more and it wouldn't just be about you know how's the fishing going when jesus asked do you have any meat he had something in mind about teaching at that time you know where is the burden one for another where is it where is the concern well i'm just so busy brother john it's so busy and you know i just believe it's between you and god well then what is our job and discerning what is our job god wants us to tarry one for another pray care carry one another's burden god wants us to wait with an expectation with one another that god is going to help this person not become partial not to separate not to withdraw not to say well i'm not part of now i'm talking about how god's looking at you i'm not talking about how i'm looking at you this is either the word or it's not we've got to learn to discern the body and we're the body and it's not just in here it's out there what makes us worthy is how we're willing to suffer for one another write that down what makes you worthy is how much you're willing to suffer for one another are we suffering for one another like christ suffered for us are we walking worthy of calvary or is calvary just some something we claim some picture on the wall is that same spirit that was at calvary inside of us now did we eat the blood do we do we drink did we drink the blood do we eat the flesh because when god sees the blood brother brandon says you can say all you want i've been baptized i'm a christian i'm this i'm the message that didn't matter it had to be on display the display is the life of christ inside of a believer and we've been discerning that our brother and sister has a problem that god wants us to help or we only been discerning that somebody's got a problem and we're not going to touch it that just kind of sounds like the devil doesn't he like point at you when you do something wrong you you i'm condemning you you should have done that christians don't do that and he just leaves him alone and that god when we do something wrong he just keeps dealing with us dealing with us until we repent get right with god and we we're back in in fellowship with him we need to have unconditional love for our brothers and sisters we've got problems god's love needs to be burning inside of us to help them why because we believe they belong to christ we discern the body that they belong to christ not they don't belong to christ so i'm not going to now we would never say that but because we just don't want to deal with them we're not discerning the body that's what this means remember the woman caught in adultery the bible says the very act i believe jesus said to her accusers whosoever is worthy he said without sin but who's ever worthy let him cast the first stone now notice it was who was ever the oldest first drop their stones if you live another day there's a good chance you're going to sin another day help us lord now how long we've been in the message what makes us worthy is when the spirit of christ is living in us discerning the body being christ to one another it's it's simple keep it simple i mean most churches out there they find a place they like they like the pastor they like the music they like the fellowship they like but there's nothing around becoming christ it's not their main motive and their main goals it's somehow it happens through a period of time without dying out without suffering without coming subject to the word brother branham said in the message a man running from the presence of god he said christianity is an everyday rugged life living for god in this present world it's a constant burning of the fire and the love of god in the heart that set you a fire and put you out yonder with people making converts to christ now to me you're discerning the lord's body outside and in if the love of god is burning in your heart for one another i believe you're discerning the lord's body but if you're backbiting and saying things and thinking things and being partial and not having and having some sort of respect to persons i'll tell you today according to the gospel you're not discerning the lord's body now we're all guilty but i say it like this what is your attitude because if you're serious about walking this word all you have to do is ask god to forgive you where you come short and don't put it under the rug and it's not a big deal and it happens to everybody no start exercising discerning the lord's body start exercising it start holding yourself accountable to laying your life down more for one another this is something that happens every time you're talking to somebody walk away i'm going to pray for you we're going to get together i'm going to help you sometimes we get together with people they stop coming to church think about that what's going on you may not want to hear this but it's the truth god is calling us to discern amen that's what makes us worthy is when we're actually representing christ to every single person now you've got a much bigger chance to be a light to somebody whose darkness is great the greater the darkness the brighter you shine and the less dark it is the harder it is colossians chapter 3 verse 8 but now he also put off all these put off these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth so put it away just just get get rid of it don't lie put off the old man with his deeds and put on the new man right verse 12 put on therefore as the elect of god now what you're putting on here is jesus christ holy and beloved bells of mercy kindness humbleness humbleness of mind meekness long suffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man ever crawl against another even as christ forgave you so also do ye that's discerning the lord's body that's not only discerning the lord's body but that's what makes you worthy of calvary when you can forgive just like christ forgave you and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of god ruin your hearts to the which you're called into what one body and be thankful oh how beautiful this is john 13. i want to end with this john 13. i know this is a lot is this too much sometimes we we need to examine ourself through the word and not examine ourselves by how we view ourselves because usually we view ourselves as a pretty good joe but i'm not a good joe i'm not even a good john i need the blood of christ john 13 verse 1 now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that the hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end that's what we need to do and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given him all things into his hands that he was come from god and he went to god now most people when they they know that their boss or what's going on they want to act like it they want to express it they want to prove that they're the head honcho but not jesus even though he knew all things were in his hands he was a servant and he raised up from the supper and he didn't try to straighten judas out he didn't throw judas out of the church it's just the opposite he laid aside his garment and he took a towel and he girded himself after he had the communion the fellowship you know what he did he started serving those he had fellowship with i wonder we you know we we go for the fellowship and we forget the serving i know this this message these messages they're not for everybody they can't stomach them but it is bride food it is bride food and after that he poureth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded and then cometh he to simon peter the one who acted so sure of himself amen always seemed to know and he said lord does not wash my feet trying to straighten up the ministry again jesus answered and said unto him what i'm doing you don't know but afterwards you're going to know i love that what i love about this scene is that jesus knew all along that they didn't know what they were what what what he was doing but it didn't stop him from carrying out what god had put on his heart to serve them and he had a faith and a confidence in his disciples that one day they were going to catch it but you know it wasn't before they got the holy ghost but when they got the holy ghost they caught it they started serving before that it was every man for himself but afterwards they started rolling up their sleeves getting out there and washing one another's feet love believeth all things peter said unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i wash thee not thou has no part with me now i just want to ask a question here what do you think jesus meant when he said that if i wash thee not was he referring to a complete cleansing at calvary or was he referring to something else just posing as a question here as we as we move forward if you don't let somebody deal with your spiritual dirt what you're really saying is you have no part with the word with jesus this is why it's important to have a humble spirit see peter was coming across as some proud you're not going to do that to me i know i know that i know i'm uh you're you're greater than me and i i know that uh uh i know my feet are dirty i i i can wash my own feet i don't need you to tell me and jesus is saying hey if you don't let me do this you don't even have a part with me and we don't let somebody talk to us about the word and try to try to help you help one another you're actually saying i don't have any part with the word simon sayeth unto him lord not my feet only but my head my hands and my head what a pendulum peter was one end to the other end jumping from one extreme to the other you know all because he was looking through natural eyes he just just he couldn't focus spiritually in the middle jesus saith to him he that is washed this is where the answer that question comes he that is washed needeth not save to wash his save and he is not saved to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all so here he's making this statement you're clean now he says in john 15 don't turn there 15 3 you can write it down he says now you are clean through the word that i've spoken unto you how important it is to come to church and let the word clean you not just say why i trust in the blood and it doesn't matter the word the spirit word is the blood and so here they're they're clean he says but you still need a washing we should never get offended at the word when it comes forth never you need more peace you need to love god more the holy ghost will use not only this pulpit but he will use people around you to help get the dirt off of you and this dirt comes from the areas that you walked the things that you've been into the things that you've been uh involved with they they bring a dirt upon you and it's our job to get the dirt off somebody now we're going to be much more successful handling somebody's feet if we're doing it gently we don't want to take some steel wool brush start making them bleed we have to learn to have a meek spirit to just care about helping the only motive help and start exercising how many feels that you know we need to exercise that more yes and if you don't feel that that's okay but i'll stay with it until i'm on the other side i believe it's the spirit of christ it's an ordinance that we need to keep now we're going to be doing foot washing we're going to be doing communion but these are these are just symbolic or our natural type to what we need to be doing spiritually when we're washing someone's feet it's like baptism it's an outward expression of an inward work and when we're when we go to wash one another's feet today we need to be thinking about really helping this person lord show me what i can do how i can help this person be just a little bit cleaner not just tell them jesus didn't sit there and say everybody on the front row you got dirty feet you know what you boys need to do he didn't say wash one of his feet and he didn't say wash your own feet he started washing and then he said he said we don't got time it's time is passing away then he said i i'm your lord and i'm washing your feet if i'm your lord and i'm doing it you ought to better do it to one another i'll ask you today whose feet have you watched washed spiritually when is the last time you got somebody and said i wanna in my in your heart don't say it out loud now i wanna help you i wanna help you get the dirt off i want to help you get closer to the word to obey the word it's part of discerning the lord's body it's really what this whole thing's about we're taking communion but what is it about this is what it's about he's calling us up higher spiritually he wants us to remember what calvary was all about as you die out to yourself to wash somebody's feet it's calvary being exhibited in front of that doesn't the scripture say that uh i'm just gonna read it's not my notes and then we're gonna just quit after this one scripture and i believe it's in it's either first or second corinthians yes let's go to second corinthians chapter four we are troubled on every hand verse eight yet not distressed we are perplexed but not despair persecuted but not forsaken cast out but not destroyed always bearing about in our body the dying of the lord that the life also of jesus might be made manifest for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you so when you're washing something sweet what you're doing is you're working life into somebody they may not appreciate it they may not care but it's still our job it's still our job and god is looking for for us to wash one another's feet to remember this is what jesus did for us is right before he went to the cross right before calvary you don't understand it now but you will well we understand it now and now we can put it into practice like like when we communicate with one another we fellowship with when we can have different motives motives now different objectives to find a way to help somebody get closer to the lord isn't that beautiful it's so beautiful to me let's stand together and we're going to let our brothers um get our uh our water ready praise the lord when you get time read the rest of that because it ends up ends up this whole thing ends up with him saying love one another as i have loved you by this
