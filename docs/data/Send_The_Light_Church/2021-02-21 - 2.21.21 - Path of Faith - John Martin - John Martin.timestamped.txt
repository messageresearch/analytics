[3:47] way um Galatians chapter 3 starting with
[3:50] verse uh number one through five and
[3:53] then we'll have a word of
[3:55] prayer oh foolish
[3:57] Galatians who have bewit te you that ye
[4:01] should not obey the truth before whose
[4:04] eyes Jesus Christ had been evidently set
[4:07] forth crucified among

[4:13] receive ye the
[4:15] Spirit by The Works of the law or by the
[4:20] hearing of Faith that's right are you so
[4:23] foolish having begun in the spirit have
[4:25] you

[4:31] have you suffered so many things in vain
[4:34] if it be yet in
[4:36] vain he therefore that minister to you

[4:43] you do do he by The Works of the law or
[4:50] by the hearing of Faith that's right
[4:52] amen let's bound a word of prayer
[4:54] Heavenly Father Lord as we bow before
[4:57] you reverently
[5:00] not worthy Lord to be in your presence
[5:04] not worthy that our troubles would be
[5:06] vanished not worthy that our hearts
[5:08] would be mended not worthy Lord to look

[5:23] the new mercies today Lord we thank you
[5:27] that you've put a desire in our heart
[5:29] it's still strong today to want to be in
[5:32] your house to want to be in that place
[5:35] to behold the beauty of the Lord would
[5:38] you come in a special way in the way
[5:41] that
[5:42] only
[5:44] only can be revealed to
[5:48] us Lord we we cannot give one another
[5:54] understanding we cannot uh even give one
[5:58] another truth in the way that it would
[6:02] stick only you can do that Lord we pray
[6:05] that you'd come in that special way and
[6:07] give revelation of your word to each of
[6:10] our hearts Lord Lift us up into that
[6:13] Heavenly realm Lord that we may sit with
[6:16] you and Lord know that we're in the very
[6:19] Presence of Jehovah today be with those
[6:22] that are in their homes Lord Lord uh we
[6:26] pray that thou would meet with them in a
[6:29] very special way the same Lord as you
[6:32] would here be with the sick and
[6:34] Afflicted Lord we commit every need now
[6:38] to you and trust you for the furtherance
[6:39] of this service for we humbly pray and
[6:42] give you the honor for these things in
[6:44] Jesus precious name amen God bless you
[6:47] you may be
[6:50] seated uh we want to entitle this
[6:52] message the path of faith for a subject
[6:55] continuing by hearing the voice of God
[6:57] personally amen we can wander off the
[7:01] path of Faith quite quickly it doesn't
[7:04] take much to distract people to get them
[7:07] to lean to their own understanding to
[7:11] look at their circumstances and and and
[7:13] and make a different Choice a different
[7:15] decision to allow their imagination to
[7:18] get the best of them to get judgment or
[7:21] to get angry or hold grudges to feel the
[7:24] need for attention or self-importance
[7:27] or the feeling need of of esteeming
[7:31] ourselves rather than esteeming
[7:33] others Pride can really be a
[7:37] distraction our knowledge and intellect
[7:40] can be a distraction yes sir sometimes
[7:42] all it takes is some little trial to get
[7:44] us off the path of Faith but that's when
[7:48] we need it most trials really prove
[7:51] where we're at every single one of us is
[7:54] going through different situations
[7:59] different things are going on in our
[8:01] life different set of
[8:03] circumstances we're all going through
[8:05] different tests and different
[8:07] trials the pressures that we're feeling
[8:10] are evolving from different aspects of
[8:14] this
[8:15] life but it's the preaching of the
[8:17] Gospel that brings us together in Christ
[8:21] amen it's where the harmony of the word
[8:23] shows us the path of faith that we
[8:25] should be
[8:27] onen Psalms 119 104 says through thy
[8:32] precepts I get
[8:35] understanding through thy mandates
[8:38] through thy commands I get understanding
[8:41] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet amen a
[8:45] light unto my path it's this word that
[8:49] helps us see the different things that
[8:51] are going on in our life the different
[8:53] set of circumstances that are coming the
[8:55] pressures that are ti how just to handle
[8:57] them how to deal with them what
[8:59] decisions to be made in
[9:02] them the word gives us light for our
[9:05] past so we can walk the path of
[9:11] faith we don't want to lean to our own
[9:16] understanding brother Ram said in the
[9:18] message God hiding himself in Simplicity
[9:20] then revealing himself in the same he
[9:22] said and Faith takes its final resting
[9:25] place on the word of God that's right
[9:28] there is where it Finds Its resting
[9:31] place he says you understand amen its
[9:34] resting place is on the
[9:37] word in the message atonement brother B
[9:40] said the first thing we wish to draw
[9:41] your attention to is the infallibility
[9:43] of God's word God keeps his word to the
[9:46] letter that's right he does and tonight
[9:49] we want to fasten our thoughts on that
[9:51] that God keeps his word we can rest
[9:53] assure of anything that God has said in
[9:55] his word to be the truth and Faith does
[9:58] not rest upon the shifting Sands of
[10:00] man's
[10:01] ideas or man's theology but it has its
[10:05] final resting place on the unmovable
[10:08] Rock of God's Eternal
[10:10] word amen we don't come to the house of
[10:13] God to prove our ideas that we think
[10:18] about trying to get it to to to prove
[10:20] that we're right in a way of
[10:22] thinking but we don't even come here to
[10:25] really rally behind of what we already
[10:26] agree upon either that's good amen
[10:28] that's right
[10:30] a thought a simple thought that God
[10:32] keeps his word
[10:34] amen we come more prepared than ever
[10:38] because we need our faith to rest on God
[10:41] speaking to us personally for our lives
[10:43] our situations what's going on in our
[10:45] homes and our jobs and our neighbors and
[10:48] our families we need to hear from God
[10:50] about those things that's right so we
[10:53] need a Living Word am and we need a
[10:56] living faith amen
[11:01] connecting with the realness of the
[11:03] Living Word that will give you faith for
[11:07] your
[11:09] path amen it will give you faith for
[11:12] your circumstances your questions your
[11:15] directions faith for what you need to do
[11:17] what God wants you to do that's right in
[11:20] the book of Hebrews remember chapter 4
[11:23] the children of Israel when they came to
[11:26] church and they heard the god preach the
[11:29] word heard the word of God being
[11:30] preached they did not mix it with faith
[11:35] right so it didn't do them any good it
[11:37] was no profit to them they came to
[11:39] church and left the church there was no
[11:40] profit it's so we've got to hear from
[11:43] God
[11:44] personally this this word that's being
[11:47] preached it's got to be just for me
[11:50] Amen brother Brandon said if if you're
[11:52] the only one that makes it in this city
[11:54] make sure you're that one you've got to
[11:56] have that attitude I'm the one amen
[11:59] because I'm committed to God that much I
[12:02] want God that
[12:04] much a Living Word brings a living
[12:08] faith we know that this word is either a
[12:12] dead letter to us and won't produce a
[12:15] thing for our lives or it's alive to us
[12:18] and it's bringing change to our lives
[12:21] creating God's character inside of us it
[12:25] depends on where we're
[12:26] at not where God is
[12:31] at I came to church and I didn't see
[12:37] God Amen we should bring him he was
[12:42] hanging on the cross and they didn't
[12:43] even know
[12:45] it they were walking on the road to
[12:48] Emmas and they didn't know
[12:51] it but when we get into The Presence of
[12:54] Jehovah you really get in the presence
[12:57] of and you are hungering for God to have
[12:59] his way things happen in your life in
[13:01] your circumstances in your situation
[13:04] because we serve a living God he is a
[13:07] present help in a time of
[13:10] trouble he's here to help us
[13:13] today all depends on where we're at
[13:17] either our spirit is proud narrog
[13:19] judgmental doubtful slow to believe or
[13:22] our spirit is humble and hungering to
[13:25] manifest a perfect love amen for the
[13:28] world to see amen
[13:30] a prepared heart will be able to catch
[13:33] the voice of God as the word is being
[13:37] preached I want you to catch that a
[13:40] prepared heart will be able to catch the
[13:42] voice of God as the word is being
[13:45] preached did not the prophet say there's
[13:47] a message in the message there's a voice
[13:50] in The
[13:51] Voice God is is here to speak to us
[13:55] individually right but we've got to
[13:58] focus on
[13:59] this is a real real sanctuary of God a
[14:03] real place that God we come to meet with
[14:06] God personally we don't we don't just
[14:08] come and show our badges that we're in
[14:09] the message or that we know so much or
[14:12] we just want to be heard or anything
[14:14] like we come with reverence and respect
[14:16] God I need to hear from you I need a
[14:18] change Lord I have a situation I need
[14:22] healing I need
[14:25] deliverence but to the heart that's not
[14:27] prepared the word is not alive to them
[14:29] personally therefore the word cannot
[14:32] bring forth a living faith to them and
[14:36] that's what you need for your situations
[14:38] we need a god with skin on it we need a
[14:40] living
[14:41] faith that's right leaving them without
[14:44] light for their
[14:46] path just another
[14:50] service us lordes how could the prophets
[14:53] say we never leave a service the
[14:56] same a lot of times we feel the same
[14:59] when we
[15:00] leave brother BR said that we're either
[15:02] closer to him or further away is it
[15:05] possible do you think the devil wants
[15:07] you to feel that you're close to God
[15:09] when you're not absolutely look at Leota
[15:12] the whole church the whole church is in
[15:14] need of nothing right right so I'm sure
[15:17] the devil's pretty good at letting us
[15:19] feel that we're closer to we're just as
[15:21] close to the god when we're further away
[15:25] but we can know whether we're closer
[15:27] when you accept the word being preached
[15:30] you can know of assurity that you are
[15:32] closer to God than when you
[15:39] came closer if you accept the word into
[15:43] your
[15:43] heart further if we just agree with the
[15:49] word I want that to sink in it's good in
[15:53] other words we can agree with the word
[15:55] and never accept it into our
[15:57] hearts the devil's
[16:02] they know it's true but they don't
[16:04] accept it personally for their lives now
[16:07] this is
[16:08] important it this word this preaching it
[16:11] needs to become personal to us the bride
[16:14] is getting ready because they are
[16:16] receiving the word
[16:20] personally need to keep our eyes on the
[16:22] goal amen what is your goal today that's
[16:27] right everyone doesn't have the same
[16:28] goal
[16:30] go I know Paul's
[16:33] goal God has predestinated his L to be
[16:38] conformed into the image of his son
[16:40] that's what Paul said amen Paul wanted
[16:45] to press towards the mark for the prize
[16:47] of the high calling in Christ Jesus
[16:49] that's
[16:51] right and the prophet preached the same
[16:56] thing I know the goal that the prophet
[16:58] pointed to was whatever you do lay
[17:01] everything
[17:03] aside until you get perfect
[17:07] love he showed us what priority
[17:10] was
[17:13] priority I want you to understand this
[17:16] perfect love was not just a
[17:20] characteristic of
[17:22] God and this perfect love that we're
[17:24] supposed to be getting is not just a
[17:26] characteristic of a person
[17:30] this is the manifestation of Christ in a
[17:35] person you do not have to be born again
[17:38] to love somebody or
[17:41] something but you must be born again to
[17:43] love
[17:48] everybody because there's something in
[17:50] the old nature that doesn't want to love
[17:54] its
[17:57] enemy to me it is the word being made
[18:00] flesh
[18:01] again even in a world where hate is
[18:04] soaring and the love of many is waxing
[18:06] cold love of God can still be projected
[18:10] by the bride they're the only
[18:13] ones everybody else
[18:15] is they've
[18:17] left that
[18:20] aside they're not interested in perfect
[18:23] love they think it's like it's going to
[18:26] happen automatically in that Rapture Day
[18:29] like you just you know it's going to be
[18:31] gifted to you it will not be gifted to
[18:35] you it's a choice that you make when
[18:38] you're being cursed at when you're being
[18:40] slammed when you're everything's being
[18:43] said behind your back and you choose to
[18:45] love that is character this in itself
[18:48] will bring to pass that Divine love
[18:52] making that
[18:53] choice it's easy to lash back when being
[18:57] lashed against amen that's true
[19:01] brother the word is the most important
[19:04] do you say Amen to
[19:06] that it's not different than perfect
[19:12] love 1 John chapter 2 verse
[19:15] 5 but whosoever keepeth his
[19:19] word in him verily is the love of God
[19:23] per perfected look at that who so
[19:27] keepeth his word in him him is the love
[19:30] of God
[19:32] perfected so if we say we keep his word
[19:36] and we're
[19:37] not
[19:39] loving perfectly and we know what
[19:42] perfect love is right love your enemy
[19:44] spitefully use you Jesus told us amen
[19:48] told us that this is how his heavenly
[19:50] father is he wants us to be just like
[19:51] his Heavenly Father
[19:55] amen when you can keep that word
[19:59] and love despite what somebody's doing
[20:01] to
[20:03] you right that's the highest
[20:12] pennacle hereby know we that we are in
[20:18] him in other words you're able to love
[20:22] one another as yourself that's what
[20:24] Jesus wanted you're able to love your
[20:27] enemies like Jesus
[20:30] said how in the world are you ever going
[20:33] to become what God has called you to
[20:35] become if you keep making light of what
[20:39] God has called you to
[20:41] do or making excuses of why you can't do
[20:46] it come on you we're either going to
[20:50] Rally behind the word or we're going to
[20:52] Rally behind that we're
[20:53] human that's good of course we're human
[20:57] of course we're going to make mistakes
[20:59] akes but we either got to be testifying
[21:02] that we can overcome or they're Giants
[21:05] right amen that's
[21:07] right somebody's got to believe this
[21:10] word now I want to say this it's
[21:11] important that you understand that you
[21:13] must believe the word before it's
[21:17] manifested you don't wait till you're a
[21:20] fully manifested Son of God you love
[21:22] everybody to stand up and say I'm a
[21:24] Believer it ain't going to
[21:26] happen You' got to say I'm a first and
[21:29] when you fall you'll get back up and
[21:31] when you fall you'll get back up but you
[21:33] say I will love my enemy I will overcome
[21:37] cuz I'm a
[21:39] Believer God is looking for your faith
[21:43] to come to that place amen you got to
[21:46] stay in the path of Faith amen thank you
[21:49] Jesus he that saith he abideth in
[21:53] him ought himself
[21:57] also to walk even as he
[22:02] walked
[22:04] wow and how did he
[22:09] walk he walked in perfect love did he
[22:12] not who else could say father forgive
[22:16] them they don't know what they're doing
[22:19] right who else could come inside Stephen
[22:23] and say the same
[22:25] thing God in you will do the same thing
[22:28] yes he is the same yesterday today and
[22:31] forever they looked at the prophet and
[22:33] they lied to his face but he still loved
[22:37] him anyways and it was a real love it
[22:40] was a genuine love that's
[22:44] right Hebrews 5:2 who can have
[22:47] compassion on the ignorant and them that
[22:49] are out of the way
[22:54] who and them who curse you and despise
[22:57] you and and despitefully use you who can
[23:00] have
[23:02] compassion if you love them that love
[23:04] you what's your reward right God isn't
[23:07] giving you any you're not getting any
[23:10] war from
[23:11] God some having compassion Jud said
[23:15] making a
[23:17] difference what will make a difference
[23:19] in somebody's life when they see the
[23:21] love of God
[23:25] manifested the importance of walking in
[23:28] the path of a living faith Romans 14:23
[23:31] says for whatsoever is not of faith is
[23:36] sin that's the importance of walking in
[23:38] the right path we've got to have faith
[23:42] amen we must contend for the faith that
[23:46] was once delivered by God
[23:50] himself through the through the
[23:52] disciples right through the apostles
[23:54] through
[23:55] the but it was God who delivered the Fai
[23:58] Faith this morning if you're going to
[24:00] get Faith it comes from God it don't
[24:03] come from the
[24:05] pulpit it' be best if we just took our
[24:08] eyes off the pulpit get our eyes on
[24:10] Jesus this morning amen we must keep
[24:13] fighting the good fight of Faith amen
[24:15] because anything short of that will be
[24:17] sin we must hunger to hear the God speak
[24:21] to us personally
[24:24] amen we can read the Bible and still not
[24:27] hear his voice
[24:28] still say it's his
[24:32] word do you know you can hear the voice
[24:34] of God not be reading the
[24:42] Bible we must labor to enter into to his
[24:44] rest we must be more prepared to hear
[24:47] the word than just to show up for
[24:50] church how is God going to honor
[24:54] that I mean all the other churches are
[24:59] showing up for
[25:01] church the word spoken to us personally
[25:04] will lighten our path give us Faith to
[25:09] walk where we should be walking for our
[25:11] certain
[25:13] situations otherwise God could still be
[25:15] speaking to us we'd be so much in the
[25:18] flesh and we won't even hear what the
[25:19] spirit is saying to the
[25:23] church Paul walked in the path of Faith

[25:42] own salvation amen with fear trembling
[25:46] Philippians chapter 2 verse 13 says for
[25:48] it is God which worketh in you both to
[25:51] Will and to do of his good pleasure so
[25:53] why is God speaking to you

[26:33] all truth the spirit of truth right not
[26:37] the dead letter amen not just some some
[26:41] quote some some read the scriptures but
[26:43] the spirit of that word is what leads us
[26:46] and guides us into all
[26:50] truth Thy word may personally alive to
[26:54] us is a lamp to our feet and a light to
[26:57] our path yes Thy
[27:00] word personally I've got to come in
[27:03] connection with the spirit of the word
[27:05] this
[27:06] morning I don't want to sit here outside
[27:10] of the spirit I don't want to sit in
[27:12] this presence of God and not recognize
[27:14] it I don't want to be in God's presence
[27:16] and not hear and speak to me personally
[27:18] I want ears to hear what the spirit is
[27:21] saying to me today CU I am the church by
[27:25] the grace of God I am the church today
[27:28] and God promised that he that has ears
[27:31] to hear Let Him hear what the spirit is
[27:34] saying to the
[27:35] church you don't want to take God for
[27:40] granted when you're pressing into a
[27:42] Living Word not a dead letter when
[27:44] you're hungering and thirsting for The
[27:46] Living Word of God God promises to fill
[27:49] us amen that's right he keeps his word
[27:54] yes he promised that's right brother
[27:58] Brandon said that God keeps every word
[28:00] of God to the
[28:02] letter but we have to believe it we have
[28:05] to keep focus on them keep trusting keep
[28:10] believing don't
[28:12] deviate from the path of
[28:16] faith we must find faith for our
[28:20] lives not just Faith or Rapture brother
[28:24] bam says how are we going to get Faith
[28:29] for big things when we don't even have
[28:31] faith for little
[28:35] things we can't expect to make it off
[28:38] the tree of
[28:41] knowledge it's through faith that we get
[28:43] the
[28:45] victory it's not our own understanding
[28:47] the knowledge about our situation what
[28:50] we think's best but it was when God
[28:52] gives you a word for that situation and
[28:57] you know it's God speaking to you you
[29:00] can Bank on it 1 John chapter 4 chapter
[29:03] 5 verse number four 1 John chapter 5
[29:06] verse number four for
[29:08] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[29:14] world and this is the victory that
[29:18] overcometh your
[29:20] world even our
[29:24] faith our faith
[29:30] you want to overcome your
[29:33] situation hear from
[29:35] God hear from God get desperate about
[29:38] hearing from God you could listen to a
[29:41] brother Bram tape every day in your life
[29:44] and if you don't have the right attitude
[29:47] the chances of you hearing from God are
[29:49] slim because the word of God falls on
[29:52] four types of ground my
[29:55] friends and it only brings for
[29:59] forth uh when it's on a good fertile
[30:02] ground and will
[30:05] last I don't even want the the ground
[30:08] that brings forth the word for a while
[30:09] and then after a while I get
[30:13] offended I want the word that takes me
[30:15] through amen I want the ground where the
[30:18] word can fall and take me through all
[30:20] the
[30:21] way I want to overcome all things the
[30:24] Bible says that to him that overcometh
[30:26] while Grant to sit with me on my throat
[30:28] even as I've overcame and sat with my
[30:30] father and his throne Hallelujah
[30:33] hallelu that's who the Rapture goes to
[30:36] yes we've got to overcome
[30:39] Amen to go ahead and say you know I just
[30:42] want to escape all this stuff and get
[30:44] out of
[30:45] here come
[30:48] on we've got to believe for our
[30:51] situation I'd rather go out believing am
[30:55] than try to be a prophet and predict
[30:57] what my future is going to
[31:00] be big deal big deal you have the
[31:03] revelation of
[31:05] that i' rather show God I trust
[31:11] him when we're born of God we're living
[31:14] a new life by the will of God think
[31:18] about
[31:19] that we're interested in the will of God
[31:22] we're seeking it we're we're hungering
[31:25] for it we're not just asking God to let
[31:27] let it be his will for this that and the
[31:29] other
[31:33] right because we're born again we're
[31:35] born of God we're living by the faith of
[31:38] the son of man and his faith becomes our
[31:42] faith when his word becomes personally
[31:47] revealed to
[31:48] us spoken to us personally that's why I
[31:52] say at this moment as you're sitting in
[31:54] your seat you're hearing this word being
[31:56] preached let it be a con prayer in your
[31:58] heart God let me hear from you today
[32:01] Lord I know why others thou are calling
[32:04] do not pass me by I I need you Lord I
[32:07] need to hear from you
[32:11] today this is the victory that
[32:14] overcometh the world even our faith we
[32:18] need faith for our personal lives we
[32:20] must understand we cannot get Victory
[32:23] any other
[32:25] way don't bother trying
[32:29] without faith it's impossible to please
[32:31] God let alone get the
[32:34] victory we'll never get a lasting
[32:36] Victory without faith you may get
[32:38] something you want for now you know
[32:40] Satan has taught us humans how to
[32:44] manipulate a
[32:46] situation how to manipulate people how
[32:50] to even try to manipulate
[32:55] God you can't
[32:58] you
[32:59] can't Satan tries to manipulate
[33:05] God God knows what he's doing God's in
[33:08] control God is in control no matter what
[33:11] happens
[33:13] amen we rest in that
[33:18] amen it's always been through the real
[33:22] substance of faith that God has done
[33:26] anything amen we we all should say Amen
[33:28] to that Hebrews 11:3 through faith we
[33:32] understand that the worlds were framed
[33:34] by the word of God through faith we
[33:38] understand that the worlds were framed
[33:40] by the word of
[33:41] God so that the things which are seen
[33:44] were made not made of things which do
[33:46] appear so let me ask you who did
[33:49] that was that Bob the
[33:54] Builder were they using Tonka toys and
[33:57] caterpillar
[34:00] no Jesus Christ spoke the word through
[34:04] faith it came into
[34:10] existence when God said let there be
[34:12] light all of Heaven knew there was going
[34:14] to be
[34:16] light there was not a doubt in the
[34:18] Angel's
[34:19] Minds Heaven and Earth will pass away
[34:22] but my word will never pass
[34:25] away now Satan can't do that
[34:29] Satan can't speak the word in
[34:32] create he's a liar he's a deceiver he's
[34:36] a perverter of that which is the
[34:40] truth so when God said repent and be
[34:43] baptize every one of you and you shall
[34:46] reive the gift of God right think about
[34:52] that don't separate the holy ghost from
[34:55] God am amen
[34:59] God is interested in implanting himself
[35:01] inside of
[35:02] you not just give you a little
[35:07] gift some gifts are without repentance
[35:09] and some you got to repent but I tell
[35:12] you you want God it's got to be by
[35:15] choice it's got to be by
[35:19] choice believe it and you shall receive
[35:22] it it's through faith that we receive
[35:25] the Holy
[35:26] Ghost we've got to stand the path of
[35:28] faith for our lives we can't deviate
[35:31] from it we can't allow doubts and
[35:33] imaginations and human in like to lead
[35:36] us away from God right right because
[35:40] that's what it's doing
[35:43] amen the devil wants you to kind of
[35:46] bring perfection in the
[35:52] flesh why do many people get baptized
[35:55] but never follow through to get the Holy
[35:57] Ghost
[36:00] because the word doesn't stay personal
[36:02] to them that's
[36:04] why it doesn't remain real to them it's
[36:09] through faith the path of faith that we
[36:11] receive all the promises of
[36:14] God stay in the path of faith if you're
[36:18] off get back online amen if you're
[36:22] deviating pinch your conscience if
[36:25] you're leading to your own understanding
[36:27] get back to hearing the voice of God
[36:30] personally amen amen that's right
[36:33] Galatians chapter 3:2 are opening
[36:35] scripture this only what I learn of you
[36:38] receive ye the Spirit by The Works of
[36:40] the
[36:41] law or by the hearing of
[36:47] Faith did you receive the Spirit by some
[36:54] works or did you hear
[36:58] am are you so foolish having begun in
[37:04] the spirit are ye now made perfect by
[37:08] the flesh have we gotten so far away
[37:11] from that personal walk with God that we
[37:14] got to intellectually try to figure
[37:16] everything out and get something
[37:21] done let's not be foolish am
[37:29] we're going to receive more Holy Spirit
[37:31] through the hearing of
[37:33] faith not through
[37:35] works not through church
[37:40] attendance it's through hearing from
[37:44] God we're going to be perfected through
[37:47] the hearing of Faith
[37:49] amen I love that question have you begun
[37:52] in the spirit are you now made perfect
[37:54] by the flesh are we going to get perfect
[37:56] faith perfect love for a perfect Rapture
[38:00] to a perfect God and a perfect heaven
[38:03] through the works of the
[38:06] flesh when you hear God's voice then and
[38:10] only then will you be able to follow him
[38:13] into all
[38:16] truth how many thankful for the truth
[38:18] that you have today
[38:20] amen don't stop
[38:23] here God has more for
[38:25] you that's why we come here
[38:28] is for the more
[38:30] truth
[38:32] now brother brandom never brought us a
[38:35] new
[38:37] message he didn't bring
[38:40] us
[38:42] uh another
[38:45] book he brought us the opening of God's
[38:48] book amen so we don't come for something
[38:52] new something exciting something
[38:55] entertaining we come to hear God's speak
[38:57] to us for our lives that's why we're
[39:02] here it needs to be
[39:04] personal second Peter chapter 1 verse4
[39:07] whereby are given unto you and me
[39:13] exceeding great and precious
[39:16] promises that by these ye might be
[39:21] partakers of the divine nature of God
[39:29] we got precious
[39:32] promises it's on the path of faith that
[39:34] we're able to partake of God's divine
[39:37] nature amen I want to
[39:41] escape all the junk that the devil has
[39:44] come in you know he's planned a lot of
[39:46] junk towards
[39:47] us he's got things in his mind and the
[39:51] demons have things in their mind that
[39:53] you don't even know about yet yes sir
[39:55] they're coming it's true brother
[39:58] we and we've got to put on the whole
[40:01] armor of God we got to be serious when
[40:03] we come into God because God may be
[40:05] wanting to give us a word to help us
[40:11] tomorrow it's through faith in God's
[40:14] precious promises that we can gain the
[40:16] victory 1 John chapter
[40:19] 3:8 he that committeth
[40:23] sin or
[40:25] unbelief is of the devil
[40:28] right for the
[40:30] devil sinned from the beginning he
[40:34] disbelieved that God was
[40:38] God he said I will be like the most high
[40:44] he didn't believe that God was
[40:46] God he sinned from the beginning for
[40:48] this purpose the Son of God was
[40:51] manifested that he might destroy the
[40:54] works of the devil and we know he did
[40:57] that at
[40:59] Calvary but today I need Christ
[41:02] manifested inside of me to destroy the
[41:04] works of the devil inside of me this
[41:08] doubt this unbelief need to possess the
[41:10] the gates of the enemy inside of me
[41:13] these evil thoughts and
[41:17] things it's not what goes in the belly
[41:21] it's what comes
[41:23] out it's not what thoughts that just hit
[41:26] you it's what you sit you think about
[41:28] and you you meditate on and you allow to
[41:31] Fuster inside of you that's what becomes
[41:34] sin and we need God manifested in our
[41:37] flesh to destroy the works of the
[41:42] devil give it to me Lord I'm hungering
[41:46] for it
[41:48] Lord Galatians chapter 3 verse number
[41:51] six even as Abraham believed God that it
[41:54] was accounted to him for righteousness
[41:56] know ye therefore that they which are of
[41:59] Faith the same are the children of
[42:01] Abraham so today yes all you have to do
[42:04] is believe right you are a a direct
[42:09] descendant of Abraham if you believe
[42:12] amen and the scripture foreseeing that
[42:15] God would justify the Heathen
[42:18] through faith through
[42:22] faith not works through faithe
[42:27] before the the gospel unto Abraham
[42:29] saying in thee shall the Nations be
[42:32] blessed so then they which be of Faith
[42:36] are blessed with faithful
[42:38] Abraham for as many as are of the works
[42:41] of the law are under the
[42:43] curse don't try to get perfected in your
[42:48] know it
[42:51] all for it is written cursed is everyone
[42:54] that continueth not in all things which
[42:56] are written in the book of the law to do
[42:58] them we can't we can't do everything
[43:02] this flesh can't fulfill the word that's
[43:05] right you just start one day just go one
[43:08] day watch how many times you you think
[43:13] evil love of God think no evil against
[43:15] his
[43:16] neighbor but that no man is justified by
[43:19] the law in the sight of God it is
[43:21] evident that just shall live by
[43:24] faith now I
[43:27] don't want
[43:29] faith that my brother
[43:33] Bob who's doing all sorts of
[43:38] evil I wantan to I'm not g to look for
[43:41] faith that that this brother who's doing
[43:44] evil is not going to do
[43:47] evil that may or may not ever happen in
[43:51] this
[43:52] lifetime but I if I can hear from God
[43:55] how to love this brother yes amen how to
[43:59] manifest Christ in front of this brother
[44:02] how to show him that he is loved of God
[44:05] regardless there might be a chance there
[44:09] might be a chance now for that man to be
[44:12] saved right so that's what I want to
[44:15] hear from I want to hear how I can
[44:18] manifest Christ
[44:23] amenes amen and the law is not of Faith
[44:28] but the man that doeth them shall live
[44:30] in them Christ have redeemed us from the
[44:33] curse of law being made a curse for us
[44:35] for it is written cursed is everyone
[44:37] that hangeth on a tree and The Blessing
[44:40] of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles
[44:42] through Jesus Christ that we might
[44:44] receive the promise of the spirit
[44:47] through
[44:49] faith through faith I want the Holy
[44:52] Ghost start believing for it I want more
[44:55] Holy Ghost start believing for it
[44:58] it is mine it is mine claim
[45:03] it Abraham had to go 25 years he didn't
[45:07] sit around like a bump on a
[45:10] log right is
[45:14] right whatever you're Desiring You Must
[45:19] Believe for through faith Brethren I
[45:22] speak after the manner of
[45:25] men though it be
[45:27] but a man's Covenant yet it be
[45:32] confirmed no man disol or added there
[45:37] too and to Abraham and his Seed where
[45:40] the promises made he saith not and to
[45:43] seeds as of many but as of one and to
[45:46] thy seed which is Christ and this I say
[45:50] that the Covenant that was confirmed
[45:53] before of God in Christ and the law
[45:57] which was 430 years after cannot disol
[46:02] that it should make the promise of none
[46:05] effect for if the inheritance be of the
[46:07] law there's no more a promise but God
[46:09] gave it to Abraham by promise wherefore
[46:12] then serveth the
[46:16] law it was added because of
[46:19] transgressions to the seed should come
[46:22] to whom the promise was made and it was
[46:25] ordained by angels in the hand of a
[46:27] mediator now a mediator is not a
[46:29] mediator of one but God is
[46:32] one in the law then against the promises
[46:35] is the law then against the promises of
[46:37] God God forbid for if there had been a
[46:40] law given which could have given life
[46:42] verily righteousness would have been by
[46:45] the law now noce had given life we were
[46:48] all dead sin trespasses and the law
[46:50] could not bring us to
[46:55] life today
[46:58] Church
[46:59] attendance cannot bring you
[47:02] life tithe pain cannot bring you
[47:06] life hearing the word naturally cannot
[47:10] bring you life it only bring you more
[47:13] condemnation you'll have more knowledge
[47:16] of what you should be doing and not
[47:18] doing
[47:20] it what we need is the spirit of life
[47:23] here today and only you can bring that
[47:25] only your hunger your thirst can bring
[47:28] that amen see you in your heart you
[47:31] create the atmosphere for God to come
[47:34] and be real to you
[47:37] amen you don't put it on the song leader
[47:40] you don't put it on the
[47:42] preacher you put it on
[47:54] yourself verse 22
[47:58] but the
[47:59] scripture have concluded all under sin
[48:02] that the promise of faith of Jesus
[48:04] Christ might be given to them that
[48:09] believe
[48:11] believe
[48:13] believe you I want to walk around saying
[48:16] I believe even if there's a t of
[48:19] Doubt Lord I believe help thou my
[48:24] unbelief don't wait till it's all gone
[48:26] to say you're a Believer let God know
[48:29] what side you're on let those demons
[48:31] who's lying to you let them know what
[48:33] side you're
[48:43] on but before Faith came we were kept
[48:47] under the law shut up shut up into the
[48:52] faith which should afterwards be
[48:55] revealed where of the law was a school
[48:58] Master to bring us unto Christ that we
[49:01] might be justified by faith but
[49:06] after faith has come we are no longer
[49:08] under the school Master we are all the
[49:11] children of God Amen by faith in Christ
[49:16] Jesus that's
[49:18] powerful don't let a demon in hell don't
[49:22] let any thought come into your head to
[49:24] tell you any different amen what is the
[49:27] evidence I
[49:29] believe I
[49:31] believe you can't prove to anybody and
[49:36] what does it matter anyways it is
[49:38] between you and
[49:40] God don't even go there with the
[49:44] devil just stay with the path of
[49:48] faith and we got to stay on that path
[49:51] amen for as many of you have been
[49:53] baptized in Christ have put on Christ
[49:56] there's neither Jew or Greek there's
[49:59] neither Bond or free there is neither
[50:01] male nor female for all
[50:03] our one in Christ
[50:07] Jesus I don't think Jesus is a
[50:15] racist the very thought that somebody
[50:18] would even talk about it shows
[50:19] something's wrong right that's just how
[50:22] I feel that's
[50:25] right I had somebody in my
[50:28] driveway let me just finish this last
[50:30] verse if ye be Christ then are ye
[50:32] Abraham's seed and heirs according to
[50:35] the promise I had something in my
[50:37] driveway
[50:38] yesterday and he was telling me about he
[50:41] got a new job and L lot of stuff there
[50:44] but his not important to talk about what
[50:48] I want to get to is something I thought
[50:50] was
[50:51] important his brother's in the National
[50:54] Guard and the government told
[50:57] him and others
[51:02] obviously that they do not want you to
[51:06] build up an immune system to this virus
[51:11] I can confirm that they want you to get
[51:15] the
[51:20] vaccine don't take God's provided way
[51:27] right that we were born with to fight
[51:30] off hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[51:33] and thousands and millions of viruses
[51:35] since we were a
[51:38] baby don't they don't want you to do
[51:41] that it's difficult but it's true I'm
[51:45] concerned about that amen I'm concerned
[51:48] about
[51:51] that why in 2021 of all my life that's
[51:55] the first time I've ever heard that
[52:03] I want you to
[52:06] know we've read a lot of extra verses
[52:09] there in Galatians chapter
[52:16] 3 but it's through
[52:20] faith man wants us to
[52:23] put our confidence and our understanding
[52:26] in a man-made
[52:30] thing God made us
[52:34] perfect I'll stay with god well what if
[52:38] you die I'll be happy that I stayed with
[52:40] God you know the thing is the thing
[52:44] is the people with the vaccine cannot
[52:47] guarantee me that I'm going to
[52:51] live and there there hundreds are dying
[52:57] yeah after they take
[53:00] it so what are they offering they're
[53:02] offering their idea their man-made
[53:08] idea I say we need to hear the voice of
[53:10] God personally for
[53:12] us we just got
[53:14] to this is only the beginning the Bible
[53:17] is telling us there's coming a time you
[53:19] won't be able to buy or sell unless you
[53:21] take a mark right amen we've got to hear
[53:24] the voice of God we got to know where
[53:25] we're standing
[53:29] Ephesians
[53:32] 2:8 for by grace are ye saved amen don't
[53:39] forget these next two words through
[53:43] faith through faith we can't be saved
[53:46] without
[53:47] faith it is not of yourselves it is the
[53:51] gift of God did you notice you cannot
[53:53] get this gift unless you believe am amen
[53:58] I can guarantee next
[54:00] Christmas when I go under the Christmas
[54:02] tree which I don't
[54:07] have but there's going to be a gift
[54:09] there for
[54:13] me but that ain't how God hands
[54:15] out eternal
[54:18] life he don't hand himself out like that
[54:22] because that's what eternal life is it's
[54:24] God himself amen fight for amen you've
[54:28] got to believe
[54:31] it you don't earn it you don't work for
[54:34] it you humbly submit to the word of
[54:39] God for
[54:42] we are his
[54:44] workmanship so when you look if there's
[54:46] anything that you have ever seen good in
[54:50] me if I say the word
[54:53] if we can rest assur it's all because of
[54:57] Jesus
[55:00] Christ I can point you to the person I
[55:04] was without Christ and there's nothing
[55:07] to brag about
[55:11] right nothing I'd wish on my children
[55:14] that's
[55:17] right I can show you the workmanship of
[55:19] my
[55:20] hands my thoughts my
[55:24] mind headed straight to him
[55:29] said you're my son he picked me
[55:32] up put me on the right path the path of
[55:35] Faith he said this is my word read it
[55:38] this is what you will become this is
[55:40] which I ordained you to become
[55:43] predestinated you to be conformed to
[55:46] this word
[55:48] amen for we are the workmanship his
[55:51] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[55:55] good works
[55:58] now it's not us but Christ in us doing
[56:01] the
[56:02] works which God have for ordained that
[56:05] we should walk in them it's important
[56:09] that you keep working for the
[56:11] Lord 2 Timothy chter 3:1
[56:15] 15 and that from a
[56:18] child thou has known the holy
[56:22] scriptures which are able to make thee
[56:25] wise
[56:27] unto
[56:28] salvation through faith which is in
[56:32] Christ Jesus
[56:34] notice Paul never preached to
[56:40] Timothy once saved always
[56:46] saved I remember laying on my bed when I
[56:49] was a boy reading the book of
[56:52] Revelations and scared scared scared
[56:59] yeah they were able to make me wise unto
[57:06] salvation but you know what I'm not
[57:09] there
[57:10] yet I'm going to keep pressing in
[57:13] amen you know we I I think the devil
[57:16] brother Mike I think the devil has done
[57:18] more damage with
[57:22] predestination trying to tell people
[57:23] they're saved no matter what you just do
[57:25] what you want to do then they go out in
[57:26] the
[57:28] world I think there needs to be more
[57:30] preaching cuz I'm telling you the elect
[57:33] won't be
[57:36] deceived they won't be deceased so what
[57:38] do we got to preach predestination to
[57:40] them all the time that's so
[57:43] good but the devil has taking this thing
[57:47] and he's getting people who are not sold
[57:49] out to God and getting them back out in
[57:52] the
[57:54] world well if I'm pretty out
[57:59] come it's a
[58:02] truth all scripture is given by the
[58:06] inspiration of
[58:08] God and it is profitable for Doctrine
[58:11] for reproof for correction for
[58:14] instruction in
[58:17] righteousness that
[58:19] we may be
[58:21] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[58:25] good
[58:27] works I think we need to continue on
[58:30] this path of Faith
[58:33] amen oh praise the
[58:43] Lord what if I told you I wanted to go
[58:46] through the book of Hebrews chapter
[58:48] 11 I'm just going to go super duper
[58:53] fast I just talk a moment on the path of
[58:56] Faith from the book of Hebrews chap
[59:01] 11 it's a substance it's a real
[59:06] substance the elders obtain a good
[59:09] report verse four says by faith Abel
[59:13] offered unto God a more excellent
[59:15] sacrifice than
[59:17] Cain that doesn't mean Adam and
[59:24] Eve gave them an instruction book of
[59:28] how and what to
[59:31] offer this means God spoke to them
[59:36] personally verse five by faith Enoch was
[59:40] translated God spoke to him personally
[59:44] had a testimony that he pleased God
[59:46] verse six without faith it's impossible
[59:49] to please him verse seven by faith Noah
[59:52] was warned of God of things not not yet
[59:57] here
[59:59] yes we don't know what's coming in
[1:00:06] 2022 but God can warn us
[1:00:10] amen that's why we come here is to hear
[1:00:13] from God
[1:00:15] personally see now notice I want you to
[1:00:17] put your name in this
[1:00:20] book your name we're going to hear all
[1:00:22] these other people's names but you're a
[1:00:25] child of Abraham that's right amen
[1:00:27] you've got to hear God speak to
[1:00:31] you verse eight by faith Abraham when he
[1:00:34] was called to go out into a place not
[1:00:38] knowing where he even went it was by
[1:00:42] faith he went out I don't know where I'm
[1:00:44] going God just calling me I'm
[1:00:46] going but it was real to
[1:00:50] him and Sarah just had to
[1:00:53] say I trust you
[1:00:57] she didn't she didn't have the old
[1:01:00] Revelation Abraham come follow
[1:01:04] me she was following Abraham and Abraham
[1:01:07] was following the
[1:01:09] spirit verse n by faith he sojourned in
[1:01:13] the Land Of
[1:01:15] Promise by Faith by the voice of God
[1:01:18] spoken to him personally verse 11
[1:01:21] through faith also Sarah received
[1:01:24] strength to conceive seed now notice
[1:01:28] both Abraham Sarah going through trials
[1:01:31] both had to hear from
[1:01:36] God Amen verse number 17 by faith
[1:01:40] Abraham when he was tried he offered up
[1:01:43] Isaac can you
[1:01:46] imagine having to go through
[1:01:48] that it was by faith though God God
[1:01:51] speaks to us sometimes things that are
[1:01:53] very hard to do very hard to give up
[1:01:56] very hard to but it's still God and
[1:01:59] we've got to follow through with it
[1:02:02] because it was that thing that Abraham
[1:02:06] did that God Justified him in a way that
[1:02:10] he couldn't without it he was justified
[1:02:13] by faith but he after he did that he
[1:02:16] stayed his head says now I know
[1:02:20] Amen in other words God is looking for
[1:02:22] us to show forth Works Faith with
[1:02:25] without works is still dead
[1:02:28] justification is not good enough for the
[1:02:30] bride we've got to have the works of
[1:02:32] Christ
[1:02:33] Hallelujah we've got to follow
[1:02:38] through by faith verse 20 Isaac bless
[1:02:43] Jacob and
[1:02:45] Esau concerning things to come now if
[1:02:48] you
[1:02:49] remember
[1:02:52] Isaac thought he was doing just the
[1:02:54] opposite of what he was doing
[1:02:58] but by faith in other words he didn't
[1:03:00] stop and say oh I made a mistake let's
[1:03:02] get this thing back and let's rechange
[1:03:05] this he said the will of the Lord be
[1:03:07] done right amen he trusted God was in
[1:03:11] control amen amen so sometimes the The
[1:03:17] Voice doesn't necessarily come before
[1:03:19] the
[1:03:20] action in this in this time it came
[1:03:24] after it happened
[1:03:27] by faith Jacob when he was dying he
[1:03:30] blessed the sons of Joseph amen by faith
[1:03:34] verse 22 when he died when Jose by faith
[1:03:37] when he died he made mention the
[1:03:40] departing of the children of Israel and
[1:03:41] gave commandment concerning his bones
[1:03:45] had a personal revelation verse 23 by
[1:03:48] faith Moses when he was born he was hid
[1:03:50] three months of his parents in other
[1:03:52] words God gave his parents a revelation
[1:03:55] amen
[1:03:56] amen amen spoke to their
[1:04:01] hearts didn't come out in in in pharoh's
[1:04:07] newsletter verse 24 by faith Moses
[1:04:11] refused to be called the son of
[1:04:14] Pharaoh's daughter I wonder today how
[1:04:17] many is going to stand and refuse uh to
[1:04:20] be called the the devil slave and listen
[1:04:22] to him speak that you can't overcome
[1:04:25] that you can't make it through that you
[1:04:27] can't uh be a believer today that you're
[1:04:30] not going to get healed today that
[1:04:31] you're not going to get filled with the
[1:04:33] Holy
[1:04:35] Ghost we got to take a stand against the
[1:04:39] devil take a
[1:04:43] stand I love verse 25 choosing rather to
[1:04:47] suffer the Affliction with the people of
[1:04:51] God than to go out and enjoy the
[1:04:53] pleasures of sin for just a season
[1:04:56] amen verse 27 by faith he forsook Egypt
[1:05:01] I trust today that you're forsaken
[1:05:03] everything in this
[1:05:04] world through faith he kept the Passover
[1:05:08] keep the Passover verse 29 by faith they
[1:05:12] passed through the Red Sea everybody's
[1:05:14] got a red
[1:05:16] sea amen but it's by faith don't cry
[1:05:20] about it stand up amen take a stand amen
[1:05:24] I'm going through I'm going through I'll
[1:05:27] take the way with the Lord's despise few
[1:05:29] amen by faith the walls of Jericho fell
[1:05:33] down
[1:05:34] amen by faith the Harlot Rahab perished
[1:05:39] not she a
[1:05:41] harlot heard the voice of God speak
[1:05:45] personally you know what she did when
[1:05:46] she heard she didn't go tell her other
[1:05:51] friends she followed the voice of the
[1:05:54] Lord amen you don't need anybody's okay
[1:05:57] today just fall through with what God
[1:05:59] told you verse
[1:06:02] 32 and what shall I more say for the
[1:06:06] time would fail me to tell of Gideon and
[1:06:09] and of Barak and Samson and Jeff jeffu
[1:06:13] Jeff Jeff of David also and of Samuel
[1:06:18] and of the prophets there's a lot of
[1:06:19] them who through faith
[1:06:27] dealt with all their own personal
[1:06:33] situations really this was their
[1:06:35] personal
[1:06:37] situations it was through faith that
[1:06:40] they subdued kingdoms wrought
[1:06:41] righteousness obtain promises stop the
[1:06:44] mouths of lions quench the violence of
[1:06:47] fire escape the edge of the sword out of
[1:06:49] weakness was made strong wax violent and
[1:06:52] fight turned the Flight of the armies of
[1:06:53] the aliens
[1:06:56] I'm telling you if they did that through
[1:06:58] faith don't you think God can give us
[1:07:00] faith today for our lives to help us
[1:07:02] from where we're at to where he's
[1:07:04] calling us
[1:07:07] to that's why this is written in here
[1:07:10] it's for us to believe that God is the
[1:07:13] same yesterday today and forever God's
[1:07:15] with me God's speaking to me God's going
[1:07:17] to deliver me God's going to lead me
[1:07:19] he's going to T me in a
[1:07:23] Rapture women receive their dead rais to
[1:07:25] life again and others were tortured not
[1:07:28] accepting Deliverance that they might
[1:07:30] obtain a better resurrection and others
[1:07:33] had trial of crew mockings and scorings
[1:07:37] yay moreover of bonds and
[1:07:39] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[1:07:41] saw on the sun they were
[1:07:43] tempted were slain with the sword they
[1:07:46] wandered about in sheep skins and goat
[1:07:48] skins being destitute Afflicted
[1:07:49] tormented of
[1:07:51] whom the world wasn't even
[1:07:58] worthy
[1:08:00] now they thought when they were doing
[1:08:04] this to
[1:08:05] them that they were
[1:08:09] unworthy so we don't we honestly don't
[1:08:12] want other people's opinion about
[1:08:15] us it'll just distract you from what God
[1:08:19] thinks about
[1:08:22] you they wandered in deserts and
[1:08:25] mountains and dens and the caves of the
[1:08:28] earth and these all having attained a
[1:08:32] good report
[1:08:35] through hearing from God personally what
[1:08:39] to do in their
[1:08:44] situation get desperate to hear from God
[1:08:47] get
[1:08:50] desperate it's if you hunger and thirst
[1:08:53] I've got to hear from you Lord God will
[1:08:56] come he promised to
[1:08:59] amen
[1:09:01] amen I don't want to be personally a
[1:09:05] dead Church to
[1:09:08] God I want to be a church that's
[1:09:11] alive one that's singing the Praises
[1:09:14] that's rejoicing always every day I get
[1:09:17] up I think of this scripture this is the
[1:09:19] day that the Lord hath made I will
[1:09:22] rejoice and be glad in it regardless of
[1:09:24] what's going out there I choose to
[1:09:27] rejoice in the day that God gave me I
[1:09:29] choose to praise him with the breath
[1:09:30] that I have I choose to glorify him in
[1:09:33] my thoughts I choose the way of the
[1:09:37] [Music]
[1:09:40] Lord through faith receive not the
[1:09:44] promise God having provided some better
[1:09:46] thing for us that they without us should
[1:09:48] not be made perfect isn't that
[1:09:51] beautiful all these Believers heard
[1:09:54] God's voice spoken to them personally
[1:09:56] inside their
[1:09:57] heart they received it they act upon it
[1:10:00] regardless of the great trials they went
[1:10:02] through and now your situation a lot of
[1:10:05] times may seem what do I do Lord you I
[1:10:08] don't seem to hear from you I just going
[1:10:09] to do what I want to do don't do
[1:10:12] that don't do
[1:10:15] that humble yourself to wait on the
[1:10:18] Lord wait on the Lord they that wait
[1:10:22] upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[1:10:24] you'll hear from God and when you hear
[1:10:26] from God you'll be to stand up by faith
[1:10:28] overcome that situation know what to do
[1:10:31] give a word for that hour whatever it
[1:10:34] might
[1:10:39] be if it's okay with you I'm gonna have
[1:10:42] to bypass some
[1:10:48] stuff you're going to have to endure a
[1:10:50] lot of
[1:10:51] stuff but it's no different than our
[1:10:53] brothers and sisters that have gone
[1:10:54] behind us
[1:10:55] amen the Bible says my sheep hear my
[1:10:58] voice amen we hear the voice of
[1:11:03] God not I agree with what's being
[1:11:06] spoken it's not good enough that won't
[1:11:08] take you
[1:11:09] through because there's a lot of people
[1:11:11] smarter than me they're going to come
[1:11:14] along and talk you out of what you heard
[1:11:17] but if you hear it from God nobody no
[1:11:20] devil in hell can talk you out of it in
[1:11:23] this dark hour that we're living we need
[1:11:25] need to hear the voice of God am
[1:11:30] amen you're blessed
[1:11:32] today can I give you just a few
[1:11:34] encouraging scriptures yes all right
[1:11:37] Matthew Chapter 13
[1:11:42] ver14 and in them is fulfilled the
[1:11:45] prophecy isaas which saith by hearing
[1:11:48] you shall hear and shall not understand
[1:11:51] in seen you shall see and not perceive
[1:11:58] that's those were the two walking in the
[1:11:59] road of
[1:12:01] mass but you know God came
[1:12:03] by and he opened up their understanding
[1:12:07] amen for this people's heart is wax
[1:12:10] gross and their ey ears are dull of
[1:12:13] hearing and their eyes have they
[1:12:17] closed don't go to sleep in church lest
[1:12:20] at any time they should see with their
[1:12:23] ears and hear with their ear
[1:12:25] uh I'm sorry see with their eyes and
[1:12:27] hear with their ears and should
[1:12:29] understand with their heart and should
[1:12:30] be converted and I should heal them amen
[1:12:33] he said but blessed are your
[1:12:36] eyes for they see and your ears for they
[1:12:41] do hear this scripture here is so
[1:12:43] powerful for verily I say to you that
[1:12:46] many prophets and righteous men have
[1:12:47] desired to see those things which you
[1:12:49] see and have not seen them and to hear
[1:12:51] the things which you hear and have not
[1:12:53] heard them
[1:12:56] We Begin
[1:12:58] walking by the hearing of
[1:13:01] Faith we're not going to quit now and
[1:13:04] try to make it the rest of the way with
[1:13:05] our own
[1:13:07] understanding we're going to get back
[1:13:10] I've got to hear the voice of God
[1:13:12] because when you first heard the voice
[1:13:14] of God it wasn't some man coming to you
[1:13:17] and telling you this is
[1:13:22] God something inside was speak speaking
[1:13:25] to
[1:13:26] you I'm not saying a word wasn't
[1:13:30] planted because God chose the
[1:13:32] foolishness of preaching but I am
[1:13:34] telling you that there something took
[1:13:36] place in your heart that was separate
[1:13:38] from man and that was God speaking to
[1:13:40] you that we' started this walk in the
[1:13:43] faith and we got trials coming that I
[1:13:45] don't even know what they
[1:13:48] are but we're not going to get perfected
[1:13:51] in this message through our flesh
[1:13:55] we've got to St this path of Faith amen
[1:13:58] Hebrews chap 10:35 cast not away
[1:14:02] therefore your confidence with have
[1:14:04] great recompense of re reward for if
[1:14:07] need a patience that after you have done
[1:14:09] the will of God you might receive the
[1:14:13] promis for yet a little while and he
[1:14:16] that shall come will come and not tar
[1:14:18] now the just shall live by faith but if
[1:14:23] any man draw back
[1:14:26] If any man decides he's going to try to
[1:14:28] hit
[1:14:29] perfection without the hearing of Faith
[1:14:32] the Bible says my soul shall have no
[1:14:34] pleasure in him that's good that's
[1:14:37] really good but we are not of them that
[1:14:38] draw back under predition but of them
[1:14:40] that believe to the saving of the soul
[1:14:45] that lies before us
[1:14:47] amen Hebrews chapter 3 ver14 for we are
[1:14:50] made partakers of Christ if we hold the

[1:15:39] through their situations through faith
[1:15:41] and by
